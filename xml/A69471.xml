      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have often heard it <U+017F>poken to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of an Eminent Peer in the la<U+017F>t Reign, That for an hour or two together he made the mo<U+017F>t agreeable Conver<U+017F>ation in the World; but if, upon parting, any one of the Company happened to reflect upon what he had heard, he could not remember the lea<U+017F>t particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, <U+017F>aving that he had <U+017F>pent <U+017F>uch a portion of Time very deliciou<U+017F>ly. 'Twas a happy Faculty for the Man; for he did his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s by it, and partly ow'd his Promotion to this Talent. I <U+017F>hall pronounce no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e upon him but thus, That perhaps (as <hi>Tully</hi> <U+017F>aid in almo<U+017F>t a like ca<U+017F>e) he was a better Gallant than a Wi<U+017F>e Man <U+017F>hould be: At lea<U+017F>t, this way of con<U+017F>uming Time, argued a great Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e in Mens Minds, when they could be contented to feed upon Air, and were <U+017F>o <U+017F>queami<U+017F>h as not to be able to bear the whol<U+017F>om Diet of <U+017F>olid Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e. 'Tis too apparent that the <U+017F>ame Humor is <U+017F>till

predominant in the<U+017F>e our days, wherein Gaming makes the whole Conver<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t the Gentry, who, like rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Animals, meet together but to prey upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whil<U+017F>t old Stories, or News, and (for want of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <U+017F>o innocent) Detractions, Deri<U+017F>ions, and Abu<U+017F>es are the only things that furni<U+017F>h talk to the Plebeians. Thus we live, and yet pretend to be Rea<U+017F>onable Creatures; whil<U+017F>t true and <U+017F>olid Rea<U+017F>on is almo<U+017F>t as ob<U+017F>curely di<U+017F>cernable in our Commerce, as Sen<U+017F>e and Motion are in Sponges and Oi<U+017F>ters.

               </note> which is the ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of the actions of an <hi>Animal,</hi> to whom alone it hath been a<U+017F><U+017F>igned, in regard no other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be<U+017F>ides becomes weary in its Operations: For all Animals, even the lowe<U+017F>t degree of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ects, <U+017F>leep; although <U+017F>uch who have hard eyes and <U+017F>cales, <U+017F>leep more ob<U+017F>curely then the re<U+017F>t; and Birds more lightly then four-footed Bea<U+017F>ts which <U+017F>uck, becau<U+017F>e they have a le<U+017F>s and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brain, and con<U+017F>equently le<U+017F>s need <U+017F>leep, who<U+017F>e u<U+017F>e is to moi<U+017F>ten and refre<U+017F>h that part. Hence Man, having of all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals the large<U+017F>t Brain, hath al<U+017F>o need of the longe<U+017F>t <U+017F>leep, which ought to be about <U+017F>even hours. Wherefore I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Plato,</hi> in his fir<U+017F>t Book of Laws, would have his Citizens ri<U+017F>e in the night to fall to their ordinary employments; for this di<U+017F>turbing of their re<U+017F>t were the way to make a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Fools; the Brain, by watchings acquiring a hot and dry intemperature, which begets igneous <U+017F>pirits, who<U+017F>e mobility not permitting the Mind to con<U+017F>ider the <U+017F>pecies impre<U+017F>s'd upon them, is the cau<U+017F>e of un<U+017F>teady and impetuous <U+017F>allies of the Mind; as, on the contrary, <U+017F>leep too exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive fills the ventricles of the Brain (wherein the Soul exerci<U+017F>es her Faculties) with abundance of vapours and humidities, which offu<U+017F>cating and troubling the <U+017F>pecies, the Mind thereby becomes <U+017F>lothful and dull.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, That Privations are under<U+017F>tood by their Habits; and therefore Sleep, which is a privation of Sen<U+017F>e, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66371:10"/>
be better known than by the functions of the outward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, which <U+017F>o long as an Animal exerci<U+017F>es it is <U+017F>aid to be awake, and to <U+017F>leep when it cea<U+017F>es to employ the <U+017F>ame. And being Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ation is perform'd by means of the animal Spirits, refin'd out of the natural and vital, and <U+017F>ent from the Brain into the Sen<U+017F>ories, which Spirits receive the <U+017F>pecies of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible object, and carry it to the Inward Sen<U+017F>e, the common Arbiter and Judg of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal objects; hence, when tho<U+017F>e Spirits happen to fail, or the Common Sen<U+017F>e is bound up, the other external Sen<U+017F>es cannot di<U+017F>charge their offices: Upon which account the Philo<U+017F>ophers have defin'd Sleep, <hi>The ligation of the Fir<U+017F>t Sen<U+017F>e</hi>; or, <hi>The re<U+017F>t of the Spirits and Blood:</hi> And the Phy<U+017F>itians, <hi>The ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sen<U+017F>es for the health and repo<U+017F>e of an Animal</hi>; hereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing it from the ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of the outward Sen<U+017F>es in Swoonings, Falling-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, Apoplexie, Lethargy, Carus, Coma, and <U+017F>uch <U+017F>orts of morbifick and praeternatural <U+017F>leep, produc'd by cau<U+017F>es acting rather by an occult and <U+017F>omniferous property, then by exce<U+017F>s of cold or moi<U+017F>ture; otherwi<U+017F>e Winter, Ice, and the colde<U+017F>t things, <U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>leep; Wine, Annis, Opium, Henbane, and abundance of hot Medicaments, <U+017F>hould not be Narcotick, as experience evinces them to be. But natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <U+017F>leep is produc'd by vapours elevated from the aliments into the brain; which moreover performing in us the office of a Vento<U+017F>e or Cupping-gla<U+017F>s, draws to it <U+017F>elf tho<U+017F>e humid vapours, conden<U+017F>es them by its coldne<U+017F>s, and re<U+017F>olves them into a gentle dew, which falling upon the ri<U+017F>e or beginning of the Nerves, ob<U+017F>tructs the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the animal Spirits, the in<U+017F>truments of Sen<U+017F>ation and voluntary Motion, which it hinders; though not Motion, <U+017F>o much as Sen<U+017F>ation; becau<U+017F>e the Nerves of the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Brain, de<U+017F>tinated to Motion, being harder, do not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily imbibe tho<U+017F>e vapours, as tho<U+017F>e of the fore-part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinated to Sen<U+017F>ation: But when the Heat and Spirits, whereof there had been an ab<U+017F>umption, are again <U+017F>ufficiently repair'd, they move anew toward the Brain, where they re<U+017F>olve tho<U+017F>e dews which <U+017F>topp'd the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and hindred the commerce of the vital Spirits with the animal; whereupon we naturally and without violence awake: So likewi<U+017F>e, the violence of an extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecal object importunately <U+017F>triking the external Sen<U+017F>es, obliges the Soul to <U+017F>end other Spirits to the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the few remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, and which before this <U+017F>upply apprehend objects on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confu<U+017F>edly.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Sleep is not the Quie<U+017F>cence of the animal Spirits, for the<U+017F>e are active, and form Dreams whil<U+017F>t we <U+017F>leep; nor of the vital, which have no relaxation or re<U+017F>t <U+017F>o long as the Animal hath life; much le<U+017F>s of the natural, Nutrition being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd be<U+017F>t during <U+017F>leep, which is the cau<U+017F>e why <U+017F>leeping fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens. Neither is the Brain's humidity the cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>leep, as 'tis commonly held; but the defect of vital heat in the Heart, in a <U+017F>ufficient degree for performing the functions of the outward
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66371:10"/>
Sen<U+017F>es. Moreover the <U+017F>udden <U+017F>eizing and abruption of <U+017F>leep, which we ob<U+017F>erve, cannot be produc'd but by a very movable cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>uch as the gro<U+017F>s vapour of aliments is not; but the vital heat is, being carried into all parts of the body in an in<U+017F>tant: Whence it is that we ob<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame to be more pale during <U+017F>leep, (as having le<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>aid heat) than during Evigilation.</p>

            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That Sleep being not only a depravation but a total privation of actions, <U+017F>ince a thing exi<U+017F>ts but <U+017F>o far as it acts; at the <U+017F>ame proportion that we love our own Being, we ought to hate Sleep, and love Watching.

The Poets them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>eem willing to imprint in us a horror of Sleep, when they feign it the Son of Hell or <hi>Erebus,</hi> and Night, the brother of Death, the father of <hi>Morpheus,</hi> and that his Palace was amid<U+017F>t the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the <hi>Cimmerians.</hi> Moreover, the mo<U+017F>t imperfect Animals <U+017F>leep more then others, which is the rea<U+017F>on <hi>Zoophytes,</hi> or Plant-animals, as the Sponge, Coral, and Oi<U+017F>ters, <U+017F>leep continually; Snails, and <U+017F>ome Flys, three or four months; Bears, longer then other Animals; and among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e, Birds, as partaking more of the nature of Heaven, <U+017F>leep le<U+017F>s then four-footed Bea<U+017F>ts: A Child, <U+017F>o long as it approaches a be<U+017F>tial life in its Mothers belly, and for the fir<U+017F>t years, <U+017F>leeps more than when 'tis grown to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and being again become by Age a Child, <U+017F>leeps more than formerly, till he comes to the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>leep of death, which reduces him to nothing.

Bodies; and its quality, Heat, is the mo<U+017F>t active of all. Among<U+017F>t living things Man is the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t, ina<U+017F>much as he renders him<U+017F>elf ma<U+017F>ter of all the fierce<U+017F>t Animals, which he knows how either to <U+017F>ubdue or tame. Among<U+017F>t men Kings are the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince they di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of our Goods, Lives, and Wills. Moral agents are different in force and activity, according to the divers con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <U+017F>ubjects upon which they act, and make a different im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Hone<U+017F>ty alone acts upon very few <U+017F>pirits; Plea<U+017F>ures, upon mo<U+017F>t; Intere<U+017F>t, upon all: Neverthele<U+017F>s <U+017F>ince they act only by the opinion which they produce either of an hone<U+017F>t, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or delightful Good, this Opinion and Imagination mu<U+017F>t be the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t of all moral agents. Among<U+017F>t the actions of the Imagination, which are the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, that of Love is the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>erves for a foundation to all the re<U+017F>t; it being true, that we fear, de<U+017F>ire, and hate nothing, but <U+017F>o far as we love <U+017F>ome other thing; <U+017F>o that he who can be free from this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, would be exempt from all others. Among<U+017F>t Tran<U+017F>cendents Truth is <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t; not that which is ill defin'd, <hi>The conformity of our <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nder<U+017F>tanding with the thing known</hi>; <U+017F>ince there are things above us which <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s the reach of our capacity, and yet cea<U+017F>e not to be true: But this Truth is a property and affection of Entity, wherewith it is convertible; and, con<U+017F>equently, cannot be truly defin'd, no more then the other Tran<U+017F>cendents; <U+017F>ince a Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires a Genus, which being <U+017F>uperiour, and more common, cannot be a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd to Entity, or Truth, which is the <U+017F>ame with Entity; otherwi<U+017F>e there <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>omething more general then Entity; which is ab<U+017F>urd. And although the nature of this Truth is not di<U+017F>tinctly known, neverthele<U+017F>s the virtue of its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects is very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible; for it acts every where, and in all; yea, above the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t things in the world, who<U+017F>e actions depend upon the verity of their E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, which they <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e. And as this Verity is the Principle of the actions of all Agents, <U+017F>o it is the End and Fir<U+017F>t Mover, which gives ri<U+017F>e to all their inclinations, whereby they all tend towards one Good, which is nothing el<U+017F>e but Truth, which gives weight and value to Goodne<U+017F>s: But the force of Verity appears principally in that it acts upon the mo<U+017F>t excellent thing in the World, to wit, the Under<U+017F>tanding, which it convinces by its light, wherewith it extorts con<U+017F>ent; and this <U+017F>o much the more as the Under<U+017F>tanding is perfect; as we <U+017F>ee in the Under<U+017F>tandings of the Wi<U+017F>e and Learned, who more ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>uffer them<U+017F>elves to be overcome by Truth, than the Vulgar; and in tho<U+017F>e of Angels and Intelligences, who likewi<U+017F>e yield to Truth. And becau<U+017F>e Verity and Entity are the <U+017F>ame thing, therefore God, who po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es Entity Originally, is al<U+017F>o the Prime Verity, which our Lord attributes to him<U+017F>elf in the Go<U+017F>pel, when he <U+017F>aith, <hi>That he is the Truth and the Life.</hi> For whereas Truth is oft-times altered and clouded in the world, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produces Hatred, the mo<U+017F>t infamous of all Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions; 'tis a defect not found but in di<U+017F><U+017F>olute Spirits, who cannot <U+017F>upport

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That in the Gowt, as in all <U+017F>orts of Fluxions, four things are to be con<U+017F>ider'd; the Matter which flows, the Place whence it comes, the Way by which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es, and the Parts upon which it falls. As for the fir<U+017F>t, the Gowt hath <U+017F>ome Matter; not being, as <U+017F>ome hold, a <U+017F>imple <hi>Intemperies,</hi> which could not <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t <U+017F>o long, nor cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch pungent pains, much le<U+017F>s a tumour, as it happens <U+017F>ometimes in the part afflicted, which cannot proceed but from the affluence of Matter: This Matter <U+017F>ome affirm to be Wind, or Flatuo<U+017F>ity, with as little rea<U+017F>on; for then it might ea<U+017F>ily be re<U+017F>olv'd, and would cau<U+017F>e only a pain of di<U+017F>ten<U+017F>ion. Mo<U+017F>t hold that 'tis the four Humours, arguing from the diver<U+017F>ity of Symptomes of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and the various manner of curing; <U+017F>ome being eas'd by hot Aliments and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, others by cold: And la<U+017F>tly, from the different colour of the tumours, appearing <U+017F>ometimes red, white, or of <U+017F>ome other colour, by rea<U+017F>on of the blood, phlegm, or other humours which produc'd them: But though a very acute pain may in this malady, as it doth in all others, attract the humours which abound in the body, and <U+017F>o cau<U+017F>e a tumour; yet this humour which makes the inflation, cannot be the cau<U+017F>e of the Gowt; <U+017F>ince at the beginning, and before the parts are inflated, the pains are very great; but cea<U+017F>e and dimini<U+017F>h upon the appearing of the Tumour. Some have held it to be Blood alone; others, Melancholy; <U+017F>ome, Bile, in regard of its mobility and activity; many, following the authority of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> that 'tis a cold, phlegmatick, and <U+017F>erous humour, and that every Gowt is cold. <hi>Mercurialis</hi> ob<U+017F>erving that Blood could not cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch great pains, that Melancholy was too heavy and thick to be active, Bile too <U+017F>ubtile to de<U+017F>cend, and Phlegm too cold to excite <U+017F>uch pungent pains and <U+017F>udden motions, which cannot proceed from a cold cau<U+017F>e; conceiv'd it was Phlegm mingled with Bile, the latter <U+017F>erving as a Vehicle to the former, and that former to precipitate and make this latter de<U+017F>cend.

I conceive it to be a <U+017F>alt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, <U+017F>ubtile, and picquant, partaking of the nature of Salts, which are all corro<U+017F>ive; which acrimony and mordacity of this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66371:13"/>
humour is caus'd by the Salt or Tartar contain'd in its <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, or deriv'd to the Aliments (whereof the humours are produc'd) from the Earth, which is full of <U+017F>uch Salt, Nitrous, or Tartareous Spirits, without which it would be unfruitful and barren, as is <U+017F>een in Earth whence Saltpeter is extracted, which can never produce any thing. This Nitrous Spirit being all drawn out of the Earth by the Plants which <U+017F>erve us for food, and not being tameable by our heat, much le<U+017F>s convertible into our <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance (for an Animal is nouri<U+017F>h'd with what is <U+017F>weet, and hath had life, wherewith the<U+017F>e Mineral Spirits were never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided) if the natural Faculty be <U+017F>trong, it expells them with the other unprofitable Excrements of the fir<U+017F>t concoction, and Urine and Sweat; and <U+017F>ometimes forms the Stone in the Kidneys, Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or other Parts: But if it happens, either through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the expul<U+017F>ive Faculty, or the quality of the Matter, or <U+017F>ome other defect, that this Tartareous Spirit is not expell'd, then it is carry'd with the Blood into the Parts, and being unfit for nutrition, tran<U+017F>pires by the Pores, if it be <U+017F>ubtil enough; or el<U+017F>e, in ca<U+017F>e it be thick, and cannot be re<U+017F>olv'd, flows back into the great Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and thence into the Joynts, where <U+017F>ometimes it is coagulated into knots and grits, and turn'd into a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, like chalk or plai<U+017F>ter, (which <U+017F>hews, that the four Humours are not the matter thereof, <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>ame do not <U+017F>uppurate) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering then the Gowt incurable, and the Reproach of Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, becau<U+017F>e they find no Cure for it; no more than for that of old Men, tho<U+017F>e who have a dry Belly, and who live di<U+017F>orderly: But 'tis curable, <U+017F>aith <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in young people, in <U+017F>uch as have no gritts or hardne<U+017F><U+017F>es form'd in the Joints, tho<U+017F>e who are laborious, obedient, and to whom <U+017F>ome great Evacuations ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, many having been cur'd of it by a Dy<U+017F>enterie. As for the Place where it is form'd, and the Way whereby the Matter which cau<U+017F>es this Evil, de<U+017F>cends; mo<U+017F>t, with <hi>Fernelius,</hi> conceive 'tis the Head, not the internal part of the Brain, who<U+017F>e Excrements are ea<U+017F>ily voided outwardly by the No<U+017F>trils; or inwardly, by the <hi>Infundibulum</hi> or Tunnel, and other Cavities; but the outward part between the skull and the skin; which being too thick and compact to give i<U+017F><U+017F>ue to the phlegmatick and <U+017F>erous humours there collected, being begotten of the Excrements of the Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Veins, which are expanded over all the<U+017F>e Parts, tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>erous and thin humours glide down between the Skin, and other Fegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, into the Joints: But the Place of this Nitrous Matter above-mentioned, are the <hi>Vi<U+017F>cera</hi> of the Liver and Spleen, which generate this Matter two ways. 1. By the vitio<U+017F>ity of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments impregnated with this Nitrous Spirit, which they plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attracted from the Earth; whence it is that Wine, which hath more of this Spirit and Tartar then any other Aliment, is, by con<U+017F>ent of all, very hurtful to the Gowt. 2. By their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vitio<U+017F>ity; namely, a hot and dry <hi>Intemperies</hi>; whereby, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead of concocting, they adure the Blood, and <U+017F>o fix that <U+017F>alt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66371:14"/>
<U+017F>ero<U+017F>ity, which is the Salt or Tartar extracted out of its <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance: Unle<U+017F>s you had rather <U+017F>ay, That as in the Kidneys of Per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>ubject to the Stone, there is a certain arenaceous or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidifick con<U+017F>titution, proper for producing the Stone; <U+017F>o in the <hi>Vi<U+017F>cera</hi> of tho<U+017F>e who are <U+017F>ubject to the Gowt, there is a particular arthritical di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, apt to beget that tartareous matter which produces it. The Way whereby this Matter is expell'd is the Veins and Arteries; the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els manife<U+017F>tly <U+017F>welling when the fits of the Gowt begin. Moreover, as this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e unexpectedly invades, by a <U+017F>udden afflux of the Matter; <U+017F>o it <U+017F>uddenly changes place, e<U+017F>pecially by means of Refrigerants and Repercu<U+017F><U+017F>ives, which drive the Gowt from one Foot to the other, or into the Hand, and other Parts; which cannot be done but by the Veins and Arteries. La<U+017F>tly, The Parts upon which this Matter falls, and which are about the articulations, are membranous and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, becau<U+017F>e the Membranes being the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject of Touch, ought to be al<U+017F>o of Pain, a Symptom thereof.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the greate<U+017F>t difficulty was, Why this matter rather falls upon the Joints than other Parts, which are not incommoded therewith, neither the Nerves nor the Veins through which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es, no more than the Membranes and <U+017F>en<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parts; be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e which are about the Joints: The cau<U+017F>e whereof may be, That as in health the Parts by a <U+017F>trange proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty attract <U+017F>uch humours as are fit for their nutrition; the Lungs, bilious Blood; the Spleen, melancholy Blood; the Kidneys, <U+017F>erous; the other carnous Parts, temperate Blood: <U+017F>o in <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, and ill con<U+017F>titution of the Body, <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e Parts attract from all the re<U+017F>t certain humours wherewith they have mo<U+017F>t affinity: So in the new Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e call'd <hi>Plica Polonica,</hi> the vi<U+017F>cous and gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous humour which produceth it, is chiefly carri'd to the hair, which it knotteth and inta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gleth together; and to the nails of the Hands and Feet, which it makes hard and black: And in the cure of Fracture of Bones, the Stone call'd <hi>O<U+017F>teocolla</hi> taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly is carried towards the broken Bones, and cau<U+017F>es them to re-unite. In like manner, the Humour producing the Gowt hath <U+017F>ome affinity with the Bones of the Joints, e<U+017F>pecially with their Epiphy<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the Gowty have wherewith to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them<U+017F>elves; not <U+017F>o much for that they foretel the changes of the Air and Sea<U+017F>ons, as for that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is a token of health, and an evidence of the <U+017F>trength and vigour of Nature, which from the noble Parts drives the vicious humours upon the Joints. But among<U+017F>t its antecedent cau<U+017F>es, the Air is not to be forgotten; e<U+017F>pecially the hot and moi<U+017F>t Air of the Spring, thaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Humours lately congeal'd by the Winter; to the vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity of which Air, is that popular Gowt to be referr'd of which <hi>Athenaeus</hi> <U+017F>peaks in the <U+017F>econd Book of his <hi>Deipno<U+017F>ophi<U+017F>ts</hi>; which la<U+017F>ted twenty years, and afflicted two thirds of Men, Women, and Bea<U+017F>ts; although <U+017F>ome attributed it to the want of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66371:14"/>
which fail'd during tho<U+017F>e twenty years, and which, they <U+017F>ay, are good again<U+017F>t the Gowt, becau<U+017F>e they loo<U+017F>en the Belly, and correct the heat of the Stomach. Women, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> <U+017F>aith, are exempt from the Gowt, <U+017F>aving in the <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of their Evacuations; Children, before the u<U+017F>e of Venery; and Eunuchs, always; although the intemperance and luxury of all of them hath produc'd contrary experiences, as well in this Age as in that of <hi>Seneca</hi>; which made the Poets <U+017F>ay, That the Gowt was the Daughter of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi>; the fir<U+017F>t, engendring plenty of crude humours; the <U+017F>econd, debilitating the heat, and cooling the Body; which being render'd laxe, the humours fall more ea<U+017F>ily upon the Joints. And to <U+017F>hew the oddne<U+017F>s of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; Anger, Fear, and Joy have oftentimes both given and cured it, the Humours being extreamly agitated by tho<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions.</p>
            <p>Upon the Second Point it was <U+017F>aid, That Wi<U+017F>edom being a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Habit mix'd of Science and Virtue,<note place="margin">

               </note> Poverty gives much more di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to either than Riches; the Mind of a Poor Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more capable of Knowledg than that of a Rich; either for that Nature compen<U+017F>ates the want of the Goods of Fortune with tho<U+017F>e of Nature; or becau<U+017F>e Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity and Hunger <U+017F>harpens and renders them more <U+017F>ubtile; or el<U+017F>e becau<U+017F>e being free from the cares and pains caus'd by the con<U+017F>ervation or acqui<U+017F>ition of Riches, they have a more calm Spirit, and more capable of the Sciences, which require quiet and tranquillity of Mind. And as for Virtue, who<U+017F>e paths are <U+017F>o thorny, Poverty hath al<U+017F>o many more acce<U+017F><U+017F>es thereunto than Riches, not only in the Law of Grace, in which our Lord <U+017F>aith, That <hi>'tis ea<U+017F>ier for a Cammel, or a Cable, to pa<U+017F>s through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; whereof neverthele<U+017F>s the gate is the practice of Virtues: but likewi<U+017F>e in the moral <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of this pre<U+017F>ent life, in which Poverty and affliction, according to the Scripture, gives Under<U+017F>tanding and Prudence, teaches Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Sobriety, and Cha<U+017F>tity (its in<U+017F>eparable companion) di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines us to Patience, and to <U+017F>uffer couragiou<U+017F>ly the mi<U+017F>eries of Life, the frequency whereof renders the Mind invincible. On the contrary, Riches are amo<U+017F>t always accompanied with Vices mo<U+017F>t repugnant to Wi<U+017F>edom; as, among<U+017F>t others, with Pre<U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, Vanity, Voluptuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, and Delicacy; the fir<U+017F>t of which is oppo<U+017F>ite to Science; for Pride proceeds only from Ignorance; the <U+017F>econd to Virtue, which the Poet calls ma<U+017F>culine and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Moreover, Nature <U+017F>hews us of what quality Riches are; for the <U+017F>and that produces Gold is always extreamly barren and naked of all <U+017F>orts of Fruits; and <U+017F>o are the Minds of tho<U+017F>e that po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s it; and 'tis ob<U+017F>erv'd. That rich Nations, and <U+017F>uch as live in a good <U+017F>oil, are the mo<U+017F>t vicious, lazy, and dull; whereas tho<U+017F>e who are in an unkind Land, are ordinarily more virtuous addicted to Indu<U+017F>try.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:66371:15"/>The Second <U+017F>aid, That as the Goods of Fortune, no le<U+017F>s than tho<U+017F>e of the Body, are referr'd to tho<U+017F>e of the Mind, as the Means to their End; in like <U+017F>ort, the inconveniences both of Fortune and Body are hinderances in acquiring tho<U+017F>e Goods of the Soul, which are the perfection of its two principal Faculties, the Under<U+017F>tanding and the Will; namely, Knowledg and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: For Knowledg, and the Arts call'd Liberal, require a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and liberal, not a <U+017F>ordid and low Soul, like that of a Poor Man (whom <hi>Alciat</hi>'s Embleme very well repre<U+017F>ents, by a Lad with one hand <U+017F>tretch'd up into the Air, with Wings fa<U+017F>tened to it, intimating a de<U+017F>ire to fly higher; but the other hand fa<U+017F>tened to a heavy Stone, hinders him:) For their Spirit being loaden with mi<U+017F>ery, thinks of nothing but of the means how to live, and to be deliver'd from the heavy yoak of Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, which deprives them of the means of having either living or dumb Teachers; yea, makes them de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e all the rigours of Laws, and oft-times abandons them to Rage and De<U+017F>pair, which makes them hate their mi<U+017F>erable life, and renders them ma<U+017F>ters of tho<U+017F>e of others: Hence not only Mutinies, Seditions and Revolts are commonly made by the Poor and Mi<U+017F>erable, lovers of Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein they are <U+017F>ure to lo<U+017F>e nothing, and may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly gain; but al<U+017F>o are almo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ole Authors of Thefts, Murders, and Sacriledges. Whereas Rich Per<U+017F>ons, having from their birth receiv'd <U+017F>uch good In<U+017F>truction as the poor want, are more <U+017F>tay'd in their Actions, and better inclin'd to Hone<U+017F>ty and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which without Fortunes or E<U+017F>tates can never produce any thing great and con<U+017F>iderable; whence, in our Language, Riches are ju<U+017F>tly <U+017F>tiled Means; without a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance whereof, Ju<U+017F>tice can neither render to every one what belongs to him, nor repel the Enemies of the State by a ju<U+017F>t War, whereof Money is the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and principal Strength. Upon this account they are <U+017F>ought after by all the World, and are not only the end of the noble<U+017F>t part of Morality and Oeconomy, (Families, which are the Pillars of a State, not being pre<U+017F>erv'd but by the lawful acqui<U+017F>ition of Wealth; in which, for this rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>ome Politicians place Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but all agree, that they <U+017F>erve for an Ornament thereunto and heighten its lu<U+017F>tre); but tho<U+017F>e who have parted with them cannot live without them, but are con<U+017F>trained to beg of others. And in Policy, whether Riches be acquired or come by <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion, they are always in e<U+017F>teem; as on the contrary, Poverty is di<U+017F>parag'd with reproach, and is a <U+017F>ign either of ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or of Negligence and profu<U+017F>ion. Hence a Poor Man is as unfit to be tru<U+017F>ted with a Publick Charge, as with a <U+017F>um of Money; and 'tis not without rea<U+017F>on, that he who is di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s'd with Poverty is extreamly a<U+017F>ham'd of it, this defect hindring and being a <hi>remora</hi> to all his de<U+017F>igns: Whereas Riches rai<U+017F>e the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, incite to great Attempts, and <U+017F>erve for a <U+017F>pur to Virtue, which thrives by Prai<U+017F>e and Glory, but freezes and langui<U+017F>hes by the Contempt and Deri<U+017F>ion in<U+017F>eparable from Poverty; which

We owe its Invention, by <hi>Pliny</hi>'s te<U+017F>timony, to certain Merchants of Nitre, who having landed in <hi>Phoenicia</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Judaea,</hi> near a Lake call'd <hi>Cendevia,</hi> which is at the foot of Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> whence flows the River <hi>Belus</hi> or <hi>Pagida,</hi> of <U+017F>mall extent; and making their Kitchin upon the Sand of this River, us'd <U+017F>ome clods of their Nitre, as a Trevet for their Kettle; and the heat of the fire melting the Sand and Nitre into Gla<U+017F>s, they took notice of it, and publi<U+017F>h'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, As there are but two things that can open Bodies in order to their <U+017F>eparation, namely, Water and Fire; which is verifi'd by the proofs made by Refiners of Gold and Silver; <U+017F>o there are but two things to <U+017F>eparate, to wit, the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil, and the Fix'd. Fire commonly <U+017F>eparates the Volatil, <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>ulphureous and aqueous things are; and Water <U+017F>eparates the Fix'd, as the Salt from the earthy parts. Of Fix'd things, <U+017F>ome are <U+017F>o in part, as the <U+017F>ame Salt; others intirely, or altogether, as Earth; which is either <U+017F>limy, clayie, or <U+017F>andie, which la<U+017F>t <U+017F>pecies is made of the two former, as is <U+017F>een in Rivers, where the Water having wa<U+017F>h'd away the fat part, nothing remains but the Sand: By which means Nature renders Valleys and low Places more fruitful; and men, by her example, have oftentimes rais'd, meliorated, and render'd low and mar<U+017F>hy places, formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, fit for culture, by <U+017F>tirring the Earth during the Rain and Floods, which by this means carries away all the fat and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous parts from the higher places into the lower, rendring the Mountains and Hills <U+017F>andy, and con<U+017F>equently unfruitful and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. For, as Sand is incorruptible, being neither putrifi'd by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor con<U+017F>um'd by Fire; <U+017F>o neither can it generate any thing, nor be turn'd into any other nature, like other <U+017F>pecies of the Earth, which <U+017F>erve for nutriment of Plants and <U+017F>ome In<U+017F>ects, and for the production of Animals. On the contrary, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erves things buried in it, as appears by Mummies kept in it for two or three thou<U+017F>and years; and Fruits, which are kept no way better than in Sand. Now, as Sand is the Matter of Gla<U+017F>s (for any Sand melted in the Fire vitrifies) <U+017F>o Gla<U+017F>s <U+017F>uits with the nature of its Principle, being, like it, incorruptible and eternal; yea, being it <U+017F>elf one of the Principles of Nature, according to modern Chymi<U+017F>ts, who reckon four; namely, Mercury, re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Water; Sulphur, or Oyl, corre<U+017F>ponding to Air; Salt, to Fire; and Gla<U+017F>s, to Earth; which Gla<U+017F>s is found clean and pure in the centre of all mix'd Bodies, there being nothing but may be reduc'd into a<U+017F>hes, and no a<U+017F>hes but of which Gla<U+017F>s may be made, which they call a <U+017F>hining and not burning Fire, having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with that of Heaven, as the Fire kindled in Sulphur, and any oylie Matter, is both burning and <U+017F>hining; and that which is in Lime and Salts is burning, and not <U+017F>hining, <U+017F>uch as is <U+017F>een in Potential Cauteries, but not (as others have <U+017F>aid) in Coals, which have <U+017F>ome although a weak light. Gla<U+017F>s wants but one thing, and that is the removing its brittlene<U+017F>s or fragility; were it not for which, it would be the mo<U+017F>t precious thing in the World.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66371:16"/>
Of the po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility hereof a certain Arti<U+017F>t having <U+017F>hewn a tryal to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> hath rais'd a de<U+017F>ire in others to make like attempts, which have hitherto been un<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful. Moreover, the Tran<U+017F>parence of Gla<U+017F>s, caus'd by the <U+017F>implicity and tenuity of its parts, is incompetible with the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence which renders things ductile and malleable, which is a tenacious vi<U+017F>co<U+017F>ity, and oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous humidity, from whence opacity proceeds; as appears by Horns and colour'd Gla<U+017F>s, which is le<U+017F>s tran<U+017F>parent then other, by rea<U+017F>on of the unctuo<U+017F>ity of the Sulphur employ'd to give it that extraneous colour.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That <hi>Archimedes,</hi> in his Fabrick of a Gla<U+017F>s-Sphere, was as judicious, in reference to the matter he cho<U+017F>e, as the form; <U+017F>ince the Matter of the Heavens being incorruptible and diaphanous, they cannot be repre<U+017F>ented better than by Gla<U+017F>s, which hath both tho<U+017F>e qualities. Moreover, all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte<U+017F>t Bodies of Nature are of a vitreous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; as, among<U+017F>t others, the fir<U+017F>t of all the Heavens, call'd the Cry<U+017F>talline. 'Tis held, That the glorified Bodies are luminous and tran<U+017F>parent, and (according to <U+017F>ome) of a vitreous Nature; which is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t perfection of every Body, and <U+017F>hall be al<U+017F>o communicated to the Earth at the la<U+017F>t Judgment, to be executed by Fire, which brings Mettals to their highe<U+017F>t degree of excellence; for by the help of Lead, Gold it <U+017F>elf is turn'd into Gla<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> Paradi<U+017F>e is pav'd with <U+017F>uch Gla<U+017F>s of Gold; and in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> God's Throne is made of it; the word <hi>Hamal</hi> being a fit Etymologie for our <hi>E<U+017F>mah</hi> (or, <hi>Enamel</hi>) which is nothing but Gla<U+017F>s. And the affinity or corre<U+017F>pondence of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals with Gla<U+017F>s is <U+017F>o great, that, like them, it is extracted out of Sand, elaborated in a Furnace, receiving the alliances of Nitre, Copper, and the Load-<U+017F>tone, which they mingle in its Mine, to get an attractive quality of Gla<U+017F>s as well as of Iron. With puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd Gla<U+017F>s, call'd <hi>Sal Alcali,</hi> they counterfeit the Diamond, Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, Turcoi<U+017F>e, Ruby, and other precious Stones. The Eye it <U+017F>elf, the noble<U+017F>t part of Man, <U+017F>ymboli<U+017F>es with Gla<U+017F>s, by that cry<U+017F>talline humour wherein the point of the vi<U+017F>ual ray terminates. But as all things in the World, like Fortune which governs them (whom the Poet de<U+017F>cribes of Gla<U+017F>s) are no <U+017F>ooner arriv'd to the point of their perfection, but they are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject to be corrupted; <U+017F>o Fragility is in<U+017F>eparable from Gla<U+017F>s, arriv'd to that high degree; which proceeds from the connexion of the Fix'd and the Volatil, which cannot but be brittle between two bodies extreamly arid, as the a<U+017F>hes of Gla<U+017F>s-wort and Fern are with Sand.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That as Gold is the Ma<U+017F>ter-piece of Nature, <U+017F>o is Gla<U+017F>s of Art, which cannot produce any thing more noble. Hence in <hi>France</hi> the making of it is permitted only to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<U+017F>s or Gentry, as a mark of the noblene<U+017F>s of Gla<U+017F>s, the faire<U+017F>t and cleane<U+017F>t of all Bodies, as partaking the mo<U+017F>t of Light, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<U+017F>t and divine<U+017F>t of all <U+017F>ublunary Bodies, to which alone its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through its imperceptible pores, being by that

means the mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>eful and delightful piece of Architecture; the beauties and proportions whereof cannot be <U+017F>een but by Light, half of which Lattices intercept, but Gla<U+017F>s communicates intire; <U+017F>erving, moreover, to correct the defects of <U+017F>ight in old men, by Spectacles; and of the Countenance, in Looking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es; by means of which, Man perfectly knows him<U+017F>elf. But to judg how Gla<U+017F>s may be malleable, we mu<U+017F>t know that it is compos'd of two Sub<U+017F>tances; the one, Earthy; the other, Gummous, <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for cement to unite tho<U+017F>e dry parts, who<U+017F>e connexion in any Body what<U+017F>oever is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, but by aerious humidity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Earthy parts would fall to du<U+017F>t. Now to remedy the brittlene<U+017F>s of Gla<U+017F>s, 'twere expedient to find out two Matters who<U+017F>e union might be clo<U+017F>er, or to link them together bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by <U+017F>ome more humid and oleaginous Matter than the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, which would no more hinder the tran<U+017F>parence of Gla<U+017F>s than it doth that of <hi>Talk,</hi> which is wholly oleaginous in its <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, and neverthele<U+017F>s diaphanous and flexible. The Fire likewi<U+017F>e, being very <U+017F>harp and violent, con<U+017F>umes almo<U+017F>t all the moi<U+017F>ture of Gla<U+017F>s, and makes it more brittle, for which rea<U+017F>on it ought to be moderated.</p>

Whites are made commonly of Sublimate, Ceru<U+017F>e, or Spani<U+017F>h-white, wa<U+017F>h'd in the water of wild Tan<U+017F>ey, or of Pearls calcin'd and apply'd as Vermillion, by tho<U+017F>e who account nothing in Nature more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than Beauty.

The Teeth are poli<U+017F>h'd by Powders and Opiates; e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by Acidum of Sulphur, and the Spirit of Vitriol mingled with common Water. The Hair receives <U+017F>uch colour as is mo<U+017F>t agreeable in each Country: In <hi>Italy</hi> mo<U+017F>t Women guild theirs with an ounce of Honey, a drachm of Saffron, and the yolk of an Egg mingl'd in Barbers-<U+017F>uds; or el<U+017F>e they rub the Comb well with Oyl of Ma<U+017F>tick and Tartar.

In fine, there is no part of the Body but receives its Fucus and Colour; only the Eye, like the Soul, who<U+017F>e Mirror it is, is <U+017F>ubject to no alteration of colour; from which Nature hath with good rea<U+017F>on left it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, that being unprepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of any, it might be the judg of true Beauty.</p>

And if the in<U+017F>inuations and prai<U+017F>es, made u<U+017F>e of by Men to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>s them, are nothing but flatteries, why <U+017F>hould not they too reciprocally endeavour to deceive Men, whil<U+017F>t they repre<U+017F>ent for the object of their Lies only the Image of Artificial Beauty?</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Countenance being the Tablet and Mirror of the Soul; as Hypocri<U+017F>ie and Lying in the Soul, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Candour and Sincerity, without which there would be no confidence nor true Friend<U+017F>hip in the World, but perpetual di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations and diffidences; <U+017F>o a Fucus upon the Face is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and the more pernicious in that it is a <U+017F>peaking Lye: For as a Liar <U+017F>peaks otherwi<U+017F>e than he thinks, and hath another thing in his Mind than upon his Tongue; <U+017F>o a painted Face ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears outwardly wholly other then what it really is; unju<U+017F>tly covering, under the plai<U+017F>ter and tincture of a Fucus, its natural imperfections and defects; which to go about to mend, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Wi<U+017F>edom of God, the Author thereof, who di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing all things wi<U+017F>ely, hath perhaps deny'd the advantage of Beauty to certain Per<U+017F>ons, out of fore-<U+017F>ight that they would abu<U+017F>e it; and who otherwi<U+017F>e having imprinted the Character of his Divinity upon our Countenances, the Per<U+017F>on that paints and di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es the <U+017F>ame, <U+017F>eems to be ingrateful, and unworthy of <U+017F>uch a favour; yea, to deprive him<U+017F>elf of all credit among hone<U+017F>t men: For, who will give belief to the Words of one that wears a Lye upon his Fore-head? Be<U+017F>ides that in time tho<U+017F>e Mixtures alter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troy the health of the whole Body; Sublimate (among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t) the commone<U+017F>t of all Co<U+017F>meticks: Not to mention the danger of letting it get into the eyes, and more of <U+017F>wallowing it down, it wrinkles the skin, renders the eyes hollow, blacks the teeth, and corrupts the breath.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>ince Beauty is one of the four gifts of the Body, it ought not to be of wor<U+017F>e condition than the other three, Health, Strength, and Goodne<U+017F>s of the Sen<U+017F>es; but 'tis lawful to pre<U+017F>erve and encrea<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>o far as we can, e<U+017F>pecially that of the Vi<U+017F>age, which being the Mirror of the Deity, <U+017F>hould be carefully adorn'd and embelli<U+017F>h'd; con<U+017F>idering too, that our Lord commands us in the Go<U+017F>pel to wa<U+017F>h our Faces, and <U+017F>uffer'd his own Feet to be annointed with precious Unguents; the u<U+017F>e whereof was common among the Ancients, who annointed the Head, and all the re<U+017F>t of the Body, with Aromatick Oyls and Compo<U+017F>itions, more for Beauty than for Health. And Phy<U+017F>ick, in one of its parts call'd <hi>Co<U+017F>metica,</hi> treats of Fucu<U+017F><U+017F>es, and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Body and Face; which the Law approves in <hi>L.</hi> 21. <hi>ff.

Plea<U+017F>ure, Health, Ornament, and Cleanne<U+017F>s. Moreover, 'twould <U+017F>eem a contempt of that Divine Gift of Heaven<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Beauty, not to pre<U+017F>erve it. And as no man, being to chu<U+017F>e a dwelling-hou<U+017F>e, but prefers a hand<U+017F>om and agreeable one before another; <U+017F>o, if Souls had the choice of their Bodies when they come into the World, they would undoubtedly take the faire<U+017F>t and be<U+017F>t <U+017F>hap'd, becau<U+017F>e they might exerci<U+017F>e their operations be<U+017F>t there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And indeed the Soul is <U+017F>o curious of this Beauty, that as <U+017F>oon as any <U+017F>troke, or other external injury deforms the Body, it cea<U+017F>es not to repair the ruines thereof; and without the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual indu<U+017F>try which <U+017F>he imploys, not only to re-e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h the perpetual deperdition of our triple <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, but al<U+017F>o to cau<U+017F>e re-generation of the con<U+017F>umed fle<U+017F>h, the re-union of parts di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd by <U+017F>olution of continuity, and to reduce to a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation the depravations thereof, there would be more Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters than Men. Why then <U+017F>hould it be a crime for Art, which perfects Nature, to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t her in this work, by taking away what is <U+017F>uperfluous, or adding what is deficient; which are al<U+017F>o the two parts of Phy<U+017F>ick.</p>

hath <U+017F>everal lobes, is woody, yellow within, bitter, ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from its bark, and, like all Herbs hot and dry, (for this is <U+017F>o in the <U+017F>econd degree) it requires moi<U+017F>t places and <U+017F>hadow, and delights to be cultivated. Moreover, 'tis kept in Gardens, as well for its beauty, as for its faculties of curing abundance of Maladies; to which 'tis the more proper, in that it hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuo<U+017F>ity familiar to our Body, who<U+017F>e excrementitious humours (the <U+017F>eed of mo<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es) it potently re<U+017F>olves.

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That this Herb heats, re<U+017F>olv's, deterges, and is <U+017F>omewhat a<U+017F>tringent; whence it is, that its leafs apply'd hot to the head cure the Meagrim and old headach, proceeded from cold or wind; and if the pain be contumacious, you mu<U+017F>t rub the place fir<U+017F>t with oyl of Orange-flowers. Moreover, 'tis us'd for the Cramp, and all other pains ari<U+017F>ing from the <U+017F>ame cold humour; particularly, for that of the Teeth, by filling them with the leaf bruis'd. Its decoction in common Water is good for maladies of the Brea<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>ame kind, as the A<U+017F>thma, and old Coughs, cau<U+017F>ing expectoration of the phlegm which produces it. Al<U+017F>o, Its <U+017F>moak taken by the no<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>wallow'd down by re<U+017F>piration, frequently cures the A<U+017F>thmatick, and <U+017F>uch as have ulcers in the Lungs; by the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on that <hi>Galen</hi> <U+017F>aith, he <U+017F>aw a Baker's Wife cur'd of one, by frequent re<U+017F>piration of a hot and dry Air, which <U+017F>he attracted as <U+017F>he put her bread into the Oven, and took it out again. The leaves roa<U+017F>ted under the a<U+017F>hes, and apply'd hot with their a<U+017F>hes to the Navil, are good for the Wind-collick, and other ob<U+017F>tructions of the Bowels proceeding from the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid cau<U+017F>es; e<U+017F>pecially, for crudities of the Stomach. The Indian women make u<U+017F>e of it to kill worms, making their children take a very little quantity of it with Sugar; but more <U+017F>afely by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leafs to the Navil, and adding a very little of the juice in lotions. The <U+017F>ame, apply'd, helps the Stone-Collick, and is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantageous in <U+017F>trangulations of the womb, being laid like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e upon the Navil; and if Women have their u<U+017F>ual <U+017F>woonings, the <U+017F>moak puff'd into their no<U+017F>trils fetches them again. They al<U+017F>o ea<U+017F>e the pains of <U+017F>woln limbs, and cold Gowts. Scurf, Itch, Child-blanes, and clefts of the heels, proceeding from cold, are cur'd by being rub'd therewith, as al<U+017F>o venomous wounds and bitings: Whereof the Spaniards bear witne<U+017F>s, who <U+017F>eizing upon a part of the Indies, the Cannibals a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted them with enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom'd Arrows, the wounds whereof they cur'd by <U+017F>prinkling them with prepar'd Sublimate; all their <U+017F>tock whereof being <U+017F>pent, the wounded dy'd, till it was found that the juice of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, apply'd, wrought the <U+017F>ame effect. Moreover, the leaves
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66371:19"/>
<U+017F>top the blood of fre<U+017F>h wounds, and agglutinate them. The juice heals old Ulcers, and prevents Gangreens. The Indian Prie<U+017F>ts, ob<U+017F>erving all the<U+017F>e virtues, transferr'd them to the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teries of their Religion: For being interrogated concerning the events of War, they <U+017F>uck the <U+017F>moak of this Herb with long Canes, then <U+017F>uffer them<U+017F>elves to fall down, and being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards awakened, relate wonders to their hearers, giving them to under<U+017F>tand that they have had divine Dreams. They make u<U+017F>e of it likewi<U+017F>e, to recover wearine<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>upport hunger, burning certain <U+017F>hells, and powdering them with equal quantity of the<U+017F>e leaves, of which they make pills, which they lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lower lip and the teeth, continually <U+017F>ucking their liquor, which, if it nouri<U+017F>h not, at lea<U+017F>t it takes away the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of the inconveniences of hunger and thir<U+017F>t; which is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <U+017F>ecret, whereby they travel two or three days together. Po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly by their example our Sailers, and Souldiers who have been at Sea, take Tobacco with <U+017F>o much plea<U+017F>ure, that <U+017F>ince they have once gotten a habit of it, they cannot be broken from it by the <U+017F>evere<U+017F>t Laws: For to alledg the prejudice of exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive taking Tobacco, is of no more moment than what <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t Wine for its abu<U+017F>e; it having been <U+017F>aid by many, That tho<U+017F>e things mu<U+017F>t be excellent which are capable of being abus'd; and this may always be inferr'd from that immutable practice of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, That there is a great familiarity between it and our Nature; <U+017F>ince the Grand Signior cannot hinder his Turks from the u<U+017F>e of it, who neverthele<U+017F>s ab<U+017F>tain from Wine.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That if ever <hi>Pliny</hi>'s condemning and decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Drugs and forreign Roots was rea<U+017F>onable, it was chiefly at the time when the Trade of the Indies tran<U+017F>mitted them to us in <hi>Europe,</hi> and, with their u<U+017F>e, new and unknown Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es: Among<U+017F>t which Medicaments, Tobacco, as 'tis the mo<U+017F>t common, <U+017F>o 'tis the more dangerous, in that a fal<U+017F>e opinion of health and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation gives it credit, although its temperament, hot and dry in a high degree, renders it not only contrary to young and chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick people, and to the <U+017F>tomach, which it provokes to vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but by a peculiar malignity 'tis an enemy to the Brain, cau<U+017F>ing Stupefaction, Vertigo, Lethargy, and a dulne<U+017F>s of all its Powers, and by a violent de<U+017F>iccation <U+017F>poling its natural con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: For 'tis <U+017F>o far from di<U+017F>-inebriating, that, on the contrary, by its <U+017F>harp and biting vapours it fills the head, and intoxicates much more; like <hi>Opium,</hi> the herb of which it re<U+017F>embles; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them <U+017F>erving for any thing but to trouble the Rea<U+017F>on; upon which account Tobacco is a <U+017F>worn enemy to Hellebore, which every one knows is the remedy for Folly, and promotes the good con<U+017F>titution of the Brain. As for the evacuation of phlegm, for which it is e<U+017F>teem'd; be<U+017F>ides that 'tis a dangerous thing to purge <U+017F>uch as are in perfect health, as mo<U+017F>t takers of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco are; 'tis certain, that all <U+017F>ort of <U+017F>moak is bad for the Brain, which it clouds and dulls, by <U+017F>tirring the animal Spirits,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66371:20"/>
and filling the cavities of its Ventricles, which it al<U+017F>o infects by its <U+017F>mell, and pricks its Membranes by its Acrimony, in<U+017F>eparable from every kind of fume; it being found, that men have had black <U+017F>cirrhous <U+017F>pots in the Meninges, produc'd by the vapours of Tobacco they were accu<U+017F>tom'd to take; which Cu<U+017F>tom al<U+017F>o enuring Nature in that manner to evacuate the pituitous excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof the Brain is never de<U+017F>titute, if the u<U+017F>e thereof be at any time interrupted, great accidents happen by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, which had gotten a long cour<U+017F>e that way, and turn'd the Cu<U+017F>tom of it into Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity; which u<U+017F>e. (be<U+017F>ides) being <U+017F>hameful, and proper only to Rogues and Robbers, whom our Arre<U+017F>ts compri<U+017F>e under the name of <hi>Takers of Tobacco</hi>; it <U+017F>eems that the name and effects of this Herb are of as bad an odour as its <U+017F>moak.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the Brain being the <U+017F>ource not only of all cold maladies, but al<U+017F>o of mo<U+017F>t affections of the Lungs, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>cituation and <U+017F>pongy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance makes them the Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of all the <U+017F>uperiour Parts; whence the A<U+017F>thma, Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia, Empyema, Phti<U+017F>ick, Cough, Orthopnaea, and other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Brea<U+017F>t, caus'd by defluxion of humidity falling from the Brain upon the Lungs; Phy<U+017F>ick hath invented three <U+017F>orts of Remedies to divert the cour<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e Excrements, namely, <hi>Errhines, Ptarmicks,</hi> and <hi>Apophlegmati<U+017F>ms. Errhines</hi> compos'd of Rue, Gentian, Celandine, Origanum, and other deter<U+017F>ive Simples, attract the phlegm adhering to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Brain, and evacuate it by the No<U+017F>e. <hi>Ptarmicks,</hi> or <hi>Sternutatories,</hi> which are made of the above-mention'd things powder'd, or of Pepper and white Hellebore, Euphorbium, Ca<U+017F>toreum, and Pyrethrum, by their acrimony <U+017F>timulating the expul<U+017F>ive faculty of the Brain, to excretion of the pituitous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements which are in its Ventricles. <hi>Apophlegmati<U+017F>ms,</hi> us'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Ma<U+017F>ticatories or Gargari<U+017F>ms, or by rubbing the palate of the Mouth, are made of Ma<U+017F>tick, roa<U+017F>ted Rai<U+017F>ins, Hy<U+017F><U+017F>op, Origanum, bark of Caper-roots, Mu<U+017F>tard, Turbith, and <U+017F>uch other things as melt and attenuate phlegm, and make it di<U+017F>til down the Palate of the Mouth. Now Tobacco may <U+017F>erve for the<U+017F>e three U<U+017F>es, being taken either by the No<U+017F>e, or in the Mouth, as a Ma<U+017F>ticatory; but not in <U+017F>moak, which is an enemy to the Brain and Spirits.</p>

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Since Kings are call'd Gods in Scripture, 'twas rea<U+017F>onable they <U+017F>hould be arm'd with Thunder, which might make them reverenc'd by others; there being no better expedient to pre<U+017F>erve Maje<U+017F>ty, than Terrour. And as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of men renders War in the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t Ages as nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary as ju<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o, without doubt, the mo<U+017F>t powerful way of overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be the mo<U+017F>t advantageous and con<U+017F>iderable. This is it which hath made Artillery <U+017F>o e<U+017F>teem'd by Sovereigns, that they have lodg'd it in Ar<U+017F>enals and Magazens with their Trea<U+017F>uries, and given it in charge to great Ma<U+017F>ters, principal Officers of their Crown; making a <U+017F>hew of it to Strangers, as the abridgment of their Power, and a mark of their Soveraignty. Moreover, 'tis by this Cannon-Law that all their Quarrels are decided: The<U+017F>e are the la<U+017F>t Emba<U+017F><U+017F>adors which carry their Commands with exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e ears are <U+017F>topp'd to their other Rea<U+017F>ons, always find peremptory ones in the mouth of their Cannons.

Moreover, by this Invention, which <U+017F>ecures Commerce, the boldne<U+017F>s has been taken to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the World, and de<U+017F>poil it of all its Riches; the Conque<U+017F>t whereof hath been more or le<U+017F>s ea<U+017F>ie, according as its u<U+017F>e was known or unknown to the invaded Nations. The truth is, he that <U+017F>hall make compari<U+017F>on of the ancient Machins, Rams, Slings, Bali<U+017F>ts, or Bows, with any Fire-Arms whatever, will find that theirs were but Childrens-play, in re<U+017F>pect of our true Combates. And <U+017F>o far is this Invention from doing wrong to Valour, that (on the contrary) it advances the <U+017F>ame to its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t point: For if Valour appears only proportionally to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers it incurs, then there is mo<U+017F>t room for the exerci<U+017F>ing of it where the greate<U+017F>t are pre<U+017F>ent. Now the ruine of <U+017F>ome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Per<U+017F>ons, is not con<U+017F>iderable, in re<U+017F>pect of the publick advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to which the good of every one, con<U+017F>ider'd by him<U+017F>elf, is <U+017F>ubordinate; <U+017F>eeing that the<U+017F>e Arms <U+017F>erve as well for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive as the Offen<U+017F>ive, the one and the other being only re<U+017F>pective, regard being had no tho<U+017F>e that employ them; that which <U+017F>erves for defence to one, being offence to the other. And be<U+017F>ides, the Sword, which for <U+017F>o many Ages hath kill'd many more, would be more <U+017F>ubject to this blame. But, on the contrary, the excellence of a Weapon con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in killing and terrifying, <U+017F>ince 'tis an In<U+017F>trument of War, whereof the principal end is to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Enemies; for the fewer are left, the <U+017F>ooner it is ended; and in the <U+017F>peedy razing of their Fortre<U+017F><U+017F>es, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts the beating down of their Pride and Confidence. Wherefore, <U+017F>eing no Invention in the World can be without its inconveniences, one or two cannot counter-balance the good which Artillery hath brought, by the Conque<U+017F>t of <U+017F>o many Kingdoms and Riches; <U+017F>o that if Arms are mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>efull for the pre<U+017F>ervation and amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a State, the Invention of the Gun mu<U+017F>t be the more <U+017F>o, ina<U+017F>much as it is the mo<U+017F>t powerful In<U+017F>trument of War, <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ing all other Arms in execution; and making a Prince not only obey'd during War, but al<U+017F>o re<U+017F>pected and redoubted in Peace, during which 'tis employ'd to te<U+017F>tify the publick rejoycings and gladne<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>

di<U+017F>pute the goodlie<U+017F>t part of the Mechanicks, it follows that the Gun and its Invention is the goodlie<U+017F>t thing of the World. For the excellence of an Engine con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in moving a great weight <U+017F>peedily, and to the greate<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tance that may be, as the Cannon alone doth, who<U+017F>e power would be judg'd impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, did not Experience atte<U+017F>t it: Nor doth its violence depend upon the ordinary rules of Nature, the Principle of the regular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every Body; but 'tis caus'd by the <U+017F>ame Nature con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in a violent <U+017F>tate, in danger of admitting either a <hi>Vacuum</hi> or penetration of Dimen<U+017F>ions; to avoid which, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ometimes breaks the Cannon; or, if the <U+017F>ame be too <U+017F>trong, <U+017F>he violently drives out the iron bullet, which hinders the free eruption of the inflamed matter, which, by rea<U+017F>on of the rarefaction of its parts, requiring 10000 times more place than before, and not finding the <U+017F>ame in the Cannon, i<U+017F><U+017F>ues forth to <U+017F>eek it; by the <U+017F>ame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on that an Exhalation inflam'd in the middle Region of the Air, di<U+017F>engages it <U+017F>elf from its pri<U+017F>on, by breaking the Cloud which holds it inclos'd in its belly, thereby forming the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Thunders, whereof the <U+017F>hots of the Cannon are true Images upon Earth, where nothing comes nearer Thunder; and con<U+017F>equently the Power of God, who oftentimes imploys tho<U+017F>e Arms to puni<U+017F>h the crimes of men: Whence Pagan Antiquity a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd indeed <U+017F>everally a Trident, a Sythe, a Bow a Helmet, a Lance, a Club, a Sword, and <U+017F>uch other In<U+017F>truments, to their fal<U+017F>e Deities; but all attributed Thunder to the mightie<U+017F>t of the Gods.</p>

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That by rea<U+017F>on of Contraries, affections again<U+017F>t Nature, as well as Health, have their <U+017F>eat in the Parts, Spirits, and Humours. The Parts are the <U+017F>eat of Maladies; the Spirits, of Symptoms and lae<U+017F>ion of Functions; and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, of the Morbifick cau<U+017F>es, either antecedent or conjunct. And as the<U+017F>e humours, which are the <U+017F>ource and leven of mo<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, being in a natural <U+017F>tate, are in their proper place, in the quantity and quality requi<U+017F>ite to their Nature; <U+017F>o in a <U+017F>tate again<U+017F>t Nature, they are out of their due place, and offend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in quantity or quality. To the<U+017F>e three defects Phy<U+017F>ick op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>es Revul<U+017F>ion, Alteration, and Evacuation; this latter is done either by evacuating only the bad, by convenient ways in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; or the good with the bad, Blood-letting, which is defin'd an Evacuation of all the humours of the Body, by <U+017F>ection of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. For though the Blood be the Trea<U+017F>ure of Life, the Source of all Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and (if we believe <hi>Galen</hi>) the Seat of the Soul; neverthele<U+017F>s, its corruption, as that of the be<U+017F>t things of the World, being <U+017F>o much the more dangerous as it is the mo<U+017F>t perfect and temperate of all the Humours, it mu<U+017F>t be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently evacuated out of the Body; not only in <hi>plenitude,</hi> where Nature requires nothing but to be di<U+017F>charg'd; but al<U+017F>o in depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Blood, by mixture of the other Humours cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; of which the le<U+017F>s there is, the more ea<U+017F>ily they are <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd by Nature, which wants not <U+017F>trength to re-produce more laudable Blood than that from which <U+017F>he was unburden'd: But regard mu<U+017F>t chiefly be had to the di<U+017F>tinction of Veins, according to the diver<U+017F>ity of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. So the mo<U+017F>t apparent Veins of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66371:22"/>
arms are open'd when the Body is plethorick, without affection of any Part: If it be <U+017F>o by <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Moneths or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, the Vein of the Foot mu<U+017F>t be open'd: If it be by Choler, then that of the right arm: If by Melancholy, then that of the left arm, in regard of the <U+017F>ituation of the Liver and Spleen; as for the various communication of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick, Ba<U+017F>ilick, or Median are cho<U+017F>en. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> opens the Vein of the Forehead call'd <hi>Praeparata,</hi> in pains of the Hinder part of the head; that of the <hi>Occiput,</hi> in fluxions of the Eyes; the <hi>Hypoglottides,</hi> or Veins under the Tongue, in the Squinancy, for derivation; that of the tip of the No<U+017F>e, or great Canthus of the Eye, in its Inflammations; the Jugulares and Salvatella, tho<U+017F>e of the Temples; and, in brief, all others are open'd accord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to the <U+017F>undry intentions of the Phy<U+017F>itian.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That Blood-letting is the greate<U+017F>t of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; there being none <U+017F>ooner communicated to all the Parts, which having need of nouri<U+017F>hment, which is carried to them by the Veins, you cannot evacuate any one <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly, but that motion will be communicated with all the Blood in the other Veins; that is to <U+017F>ay, over all the Body. Its u<U+017F>e was anciently <U+017F>o rare, that <hi>Galen</hi> and the Greeks made con<U+017F>cience of letting Children blood before fourteen years of Age; and <hi>Avenzoar</hi> was accounted too ventrous in Phlebotomi<U+017F>ing his own Son at <U+017F>even. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> appoints it in four ca<U+017F>es; in <hi>Inflammation, Meta<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is, Repletion,</hi> and <hi>Ob<U+017F>truction.</hi> 'Tis above all nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, when the Body is too replete, evidenced oft-times by <U+017F>pontaneous evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations at the No<U+017F>e, and Hemorroids; whether this Repletion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect the <hi>Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> which are too full, and in danger of breaking; or the natural <U+017F>trength, oppre<U+017F>s'd under the weight of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: But it <U+017F>eems to me impertinent and unprofitable in ca<U+017F>e of Cacochymie without Repletion, which requires Purgatives to purifie the <U+017F>anguinary ma<U+017F>s, and not this bleeding Remedy: For, there being three principal <U+017F>eats of Cacochymie, to wit, the <hi>Fir<U+017F>t Region,</hi> the <hi>Veins,</hi> and the <hi>Habit of the Body</hi>; Blood-letting is alike unprofitable to them all. As for the Fir<U+017F>t Region, which is the <U+017F>ink and channel of the humours, Blood-letting cannot reach thither, without emptying all the Blood of the Body; and <U+017F>hould it penetrate thither, it would draw tho<U+017F>e excrementitious humours into the Veins, where they would corrupt the laudable Blood. But Cacochymie re<U+017F>iding in the Region of the Veins, Purgation (which only eliminates the corrupted humours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the good and laudable) is more proper thereunto than Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomie; which, on the contrary, <U+017F>ometimes evacuates the good juice, and not the vicious, when the <U+017F>ame is impacted and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to <U+017F>ome part remote from the open'd Vein. In fine, Blood-letting is as little profitable when the impurity is in the habit of the Body: Whence 'tis too hard to draw the humours into the Veins; but it is more expedient to re<U+017F>olve and make them tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pire by <U+017F>weats, exerci<U+017F>e, ab<U+017F>tinence, and other labours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:66371:23"/>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That Blood-letting is profitable in every vitio<U+017F>ity of the Blood, which either is corrupted in <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and quality, or offends in quantity, or cau<U+017F>eth a fluxion upon <U+017F>ome Part, or pre<U+017F><U+017F>es and loads it, or el<U+017F>e is too much inflam'd: Neverthele<U+017F>s with this precaution, that regard is to be had to the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; the <U+017F>trength, temper, age, <U+017F>ex, habitation, cu<U+017F>tom, and particular nature of the Patient.

Al<U+017F>o, diminution of <U+017F>trength, caus'd by any evacuation or re<U+017F>olution, prohibits bleeding; but not that where the <U+017F>trength is oppre<U+017F>s'd by abundance of humours, which mu<U+017F>t be pre<U+017F>ently eliminated. Children, who need Blood for their growth, as breeding Women do for the nouri<U+017F>hment of their Child; old men, who want heat and Spirits; tho<U+017F>e who have <U+017F>mall Veins, or rare and <U+017F>ofti<U+017F>h fle<U+017F>h; ought not to be let blood but with great precautions. Nor is Phlebotomie to be admini<U+017F>tred in great cold or great heat, nor after great watchings and labours. And although the quantity of Blood depends upon the <U+017F>trength, and the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, yet 'tis <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t to take rather le<U+017F>s; but by no means to imitate the Ancients, who let Blood till the <U+017F>wooning of the Patient, in Inflammations, violent Pains, and very burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; which they <U+017F>ometimes cur'd by this cour<U+017F>e, but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caus'd a cold <hi>Intemperies</hi> to the whole Body, during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of life.</p>

as they are for our profit, or that of others; for our own profit 'tis be<U+017F>t to have a good Judgment, and le<U+017F>s of Memory or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: For the Imagination <U+017F>erves more for Invention, and this to ruine its Author when it is de<U+017F>titute of Judgment; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to make a man admir'd; and Judgment, for conduct and government.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Since the Imagination gives the ri<U+017F>e to all the motions of the Soul, by the <hi>Species</hi> which it <U+017F>upplies to it, wherewith it forms the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions in the Inferior Appetites, De<U+017F>ires in the Rea<U+017F>onable Appetite, namely, the Will; and Notions in the Under<U+017F>tanding, which cannot know any thing but by the phanta<U+017F>ms or <hi><U+017F>pecies</hi> forg'd in the Imagination; it mu<U+017F>t be the mo<U+017F>t excellent of all the Faculties of the Soul. Moreover, the Temper which con<U+017F>titutes it being the mo<U+017F>t laudable, and the Age wherein it prevails being the mo<U+017F>t perfect, its Actions mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ublime; <U+017F>ince being not performable but by help of corporeal Organs, the more perfect the<U+017F>e are, the more will the Minds actions be <U+017F>o too. Now the Qualities of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination have much more conformity to the Soul, according to the Opinion of <U+017F>ome Ancients, of an igneous nature; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, an Entelechie and continual motion, which either cau<U+017F>es or depends on heat, the mo<U+017F>t active quality of all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Brain being impregnate, renders the Spirit more lively, quick in retorts, and in all that they call <hi>Pointe d' E<U+017F>prit,</hi> or <hi>acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>; and in<U+017F>piring Enthu<U+017F>ia<U+017F>ms to Poets. On the contrary, the Judicious, who want this Imaginative Virtue, are cold, heavy, and as tedious in conver<U+017F>ation, as the other are agreeable and welcome: Yea, the Judgment it <U+017F>elf ows all its advantage to it: For if it were equitable, it would regulate it <U+017F>elf only by the <hi><U+017F>pecies</hi> which the Imagination repre<U+017F>ents to it; and if it be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and without having regard to the pieces offer'd to its view, will follow its own <U+017F>entiments, it runs the hazard of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a thou<U+017F>and extravagances and impertinences. Yea, all the Judicious Sciences are ambiguous, and their followers divided; a <U+017F>ure note of their weakne<U+017F>s, as well as of that of Judgment which guids them; <U+017F>ince Ab<U+017F>tracted Truth, its Object being unknown, it mu<U+017F>t leave the <U+017F>ame in perpetual darkne<U+017F>s, unle<U+017F>s it borrow light from the Imagination. Moreover, the Sciences, Arts, and Di<U+017F>ciplines of this Faculty are all plea<U+017F>ant, and as delightful and certain, as tho<U+017F>e of Memory are labile, the Faculty only of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Liars. Yea, the maladies of the Imagination are in <U+017F>uch veneration, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls them Divine, as having mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous effects.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That there is no intire and perfect Good in this World, is verifi'd al<U+017F>o in the Goods of the Mind, which are not often po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd by one <U+017F>ingle man, but every one hath his <U+017F>hare therein: For goodne<U+017F>s of Wit, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in the excellence of his three Faculties, Imagination, Memory, and Judgment, the fir<U+017F>t of which forms the <hi><U+017F>pecies,</hi> the <U+017F>econd pre<U+017F>erves, and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66371:24"/>
la<U+017F>t judges of, and frames its Notions from them; 'tis a very rare thing to find a man po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ing the<U+017F>e three advantages in an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent degree; be<U+017F>ides that, they are incompatible in one and the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject, ina<U+017F>much as they depend upon the contrary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments. The Memory on a hot and moi<U+017F>t, <U+017F>uch as that of Children; which neverthele<U+017F>s mu<U+017F>t not be like water, which ea<U+017F>ily receives, but retains not, all <U+017F>orts of Figures; but it mu<U+017F>t be aerial, and have <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence and vi<U+017F>co<U+017F>ity to retain the imprinted <hi><U+017F>pecies.</hi> The Imagination requires a hot and dry temper, for fabricating and compo<U+017F>ing abundance of <hi><U+017F>pecies</hi>; like that of cholerick and young men, who are inventive and indu<U+017F>trious. The Judgment demands a con<U+017F>titution of Brain cold and dry, like that of melancholy and old men, to hinder the <U+017F>udden eruptions, or <U+017F>allies of the Mind; which therefore rea<U+017F>ons better when the Body is at re<U+017F>t, than when it is in motion, which produces heat, as much an enemy to the operation of the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul, as profitable to tho<U+017F>e of the Sen<U+017F>itive or Vegetative, who<U+017F>e actions are perform'd by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Heat. But the Imagination cannot know any thing without Memory, which furni<U+017F>hes it with <hi><U+017F>pecies</hi>; nor this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, without help of the Imagination; nor the Judgment conceive and judg without the help of both. Neverthele<U+017F>s, as among<U+017F>t Qualities there is always one predominant; <U+017F>o among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e three Faculties, one commonly excels the re<U+017F>t; and the Judgment is the more excellent, ina<U+017F>much as 'tis pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Man; whereas the Imagination and Memory are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with Bea<U+017F>ts. So that the Judgment is our proper good, and is better worth cultivating than the Memory, to which they who wholly addict them<U+017F>elves, are like bad Farmers, who improve others Commodities, and let their own peri<U+017F>h. On the contrary, they who only form their Judgment, acquire the true Trea<U+017F>ures of Wi<U+017F>edom, and may be <U+017F>aid rich of their own Stock: But great Memories are commonly like <hi>Ae<U+017F>op</hi>'s Crow, adorn'd with borrow'd Plumes; and indeed rai<U+017F>e admiration in the weak minds of the Vulgar, but not in tho<U+017F>e who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>olid Truths, the Principle whereof is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

For Dew could not fertili<U+017F>e the Earth, if it were bare Water, de<U+017F>titute of all <U+017F>ort of Spirits; and particularly tho<U+017F>e of Nitre, which is the mo<U+017F>t excellent Manure that can be u<U+017F>ed to improve Land; for the Earth from which it is extracted remains barren, till it have been anew impregnated with tho<U+017F>e Spirits by the influx of Dew, to which they expo<U+017F>e it for <U+017F>ome time, that it may again become capable of producing <U+017F>omething. This purgative virtue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not only Manna partakes (being a gentle purger, of <U+017F>ero<U+017F>ities) but al<U+017F>o pure Dew, which <U+017F>ometimes cau<U+017F>es a mortal Diarrhoea or Lax in Cattle, purging them exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively when it is not well concocted and dige<U+017F>ted by the heat of the Sun, which con<U+017F>umes its <U+017F>uperfluous phlegm; and that deter<U+017F>ive Faculty whereby Dew clean<U+017F>es all impurities of the Body, which it whitens perfectly, cannot proceed but from that nitrous Salt, which, as all other Salts, is penetrative and deter<U+017F>ive. Nor can that a<U+017F>cending of the Egg-<U+017F>hell proceed from any other cau<U+017F>e but the virtue of certain leight and volatil Spirits; which being actuated and fortifi'd by the heat of the Sun-beams, are <U+017F>et on motion; and flying upwards, carry the inclo<U+017F>ing <U+017F>hell with them; which an aqueous humour cannot do; becau<U+017F>e though the heat of the Sun could <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>e, attenuate, and rarefie it, as to render it an aery Nature, which is the highe<U+017F>t point of rarity it can attain; yet it would not <U+017F>ooner attract the <U+017F>ame than the re<U+017F>t of the air; much le<U+017F>s would it rai<U+017F>e up the Egg-<U+017F>hell; but it would tran<U+017F>pire by little and little through the pores of the <U+017F>hell, or be expanded in it <U+017F>o far as it had <U+017F>pace, and at la<U+017F>t either break it, or be re<U+017F>olv'd into fume; Heat imprinting no motion in Water, but only ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying and heating it by degrees; which is not <U+017F>ufficient to rai<U+017F>e up the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el which contains it, <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>ame being full of heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed air, would remain upon the ground.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That all natural things being in a perpetual flux and reflux, to which this Elementary Globe <U+017F>upplies Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make them return to their Principle; Dew may be term'd the beginning and end of all things, the Pearl or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond which terminates the circular revolution of all Nature;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66371:26"/>
<U+017F>ince being drawn upwards by the Sun from the ma<U+017F>s of Water and Earth, <U+017F>ubtilis'd into vapour, and arriv'd to the utmo<U+017F>t point of its rarefaction, it becomes condens'd again, and returns to the Earth, to which it <U+017F>erves as <hi><U+017F>perm,</hi> to render it fruitful, and to be transform'd upon it into all things, who<U+017F>e qualities it a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umes; becau<U+017F>e being nothing but a Quite<U+017F><U+017F>ence extracted from all this Body, it mu<U+017F>t have all the virtues thereof eminently in it <U+017F>elf. Moreover, anciently the ordinary Benedicton of Fathers to their Children was, that of the Dew of Heaven; as being the <hi><U+017F>perm</hi> of Nature, the Fir<U+017F>t Matter of all its Goods, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, recocted and dige<U+017F>ted in the <U+017F>econd Region of the Air: For the <U+017F>ame vapour which forms Dew in the Morning, being that which cau<U+017F>es the Serein in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet the difference of them is <U+017F>o great, that the latter is as noxious as the former is profitable; becau<U+017F>e the fir<U+017F>t vapours which i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of the bo<U+017F>ome of the Earth, being not yet depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their crude and malignant qualities, cau<U+017F>e Rheums and Catarrhs; but tho<U+017F>e of the Morning being re<U+017F>olv'd of Air condens'd by the coldne<U+017F>s of the Night, have nothing but the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s and benignity of that Element; or el<U+017F>e the pores of the Body being open'd by the diurnal heat, more ea<U+017F>ily receive the malignant impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of extraneous humidity, than after having been clos'd by the coldne<U+017F>s of the night.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, Although Vapour be an imperfect Mixt, yet 'tis as well as other perfect Bodies compos'd of different parts; <U+017F>ome whereof are gro<U+017F>s others tenuious. The gro<U+017F>s parts of Vapour being render'd volatile by the extraneous heat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are impregnated, are elevated a far as the Middle Region of the Air, who<U+017F>e coldne<U+017F>s conden<U+017F>es them into a cloud, which is ordinarily di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd into Rain, <U+017F>ometimes into <U+017F>now or hail; into the former, when the cloud before re<U+017F>olution is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd friable by the violence of the cold, which expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the humidity, clo<U+017F>es the parts of the cloud, and <U+017F>o it falls in flocks: and into the latter, when the <U+017F>ame cloud being already melted into rain, the drops are congeal'd, either by the external cold, or el<U+017F>e by the extream heat of the Air, which by Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is augmenting the coldne<U+017F>s of the rain, makes it clo<U+017F>e and harden; which his the rea<U+017F>on why it hails as well during the <U+017F>ultry heats of Summer, as the rigours of Winter. And among<U+017F>t the gro<U+017F>s parts of the Vapour, <U+017F>uch as could not be alter'd or chang'd into a cloud, de<U+017F>cend towards our Region, and there form black clouds, and mi<U+017F>ts or foggs: But the more tenuious parts of this Vapour produce Dew; in which, two things are to be con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. I. The Matter. II. The Efficient Cau<U+017F>e. The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is that tenuious Vapour, <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtil as not to be capable of heat, and too weak to abate it. The Remote Efficient Cau<U+017F>e, is a moderate Heat; for were it exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive, it would either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ume or carry away the Vapour; whence if comes to pa<U+017F>s, that there is no Dew made but during the Spring and Autumn, which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66371:26"/>
are temperate, Sea<U+017F>ons; but never in Winter or Summer, the former congealing tho<U+017F>e Vapours, and the latter di<U+017F><U+017F>olving and con<U+017F>uming them. The Proximate Efficient Cau<U+017F>e is the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the Night, which mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be moderate; otherwi<U+017F>e it congeals them, not into Dew, but white-Fro<U+017F>t, as it turns the Waters into Ice by the extream cold of the Air; which more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over mu<U+017F>t be calm and <U+017F>erene, becau<U+017F>e if beaten and agitated by Winds, the Vapour cannot be condens'd, for the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on which hinders running Waters from freezing, as <U+017F>tanding do; whence al<U+017F>o Dew is more frequent in low places than high. Now as Dew is form'd of Vapour alone; <U+017F>o if together with that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious Vapour, <U+017F>ome terrene but very fine parts be carried up, e<U+017F>pecially towards the morning, there is produc'd a very <U+017F>weet juice, of which Honey is made; and when tho<U+017F>e terrene parts prevail above the humid parts of the Dew, there is made a le<U+017F>s liquid juice call'd Manna, whereof the be<U+017F>t is found in <hi>Calabria</hi>; that of <hi>Brian<U+017F>on,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other places, being through want of heat le<U+017F>s dige<U+017F>ted than is requi<U+017F>ite; or mingled with too many impurities, by the exce<U+017F>s of that which attracted them too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently from the Earth: But the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of this Honey and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na proceeds from a mo<U+017F>t perfect mixture of <U+017F>iccity with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, in a degree which is unknown to us.</p>

Their Memory, caus'd by the moi<U+017F>t con<U+017F>titution of their Brain, and their <U+017F>edentary and <U+017F>olitary life, is further favourable to Study. Moreover, not to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66371:27"/>
<U+017F>peak of tho<U+017F>e of the pre<U+017F>ent Times, we have the examples of S. <hi>Bridgid,</hi> who excell'd in My<U+017F>tical Theologie; <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter of <hi>Ar<U+017F>inous,</hi> in Phy<U+017F>ick; <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> in Politicks; <hi>Hupetia</hi> and <hi>Athenais,</hi> wife to <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius,</hi> in Philo<U+017F>ophy; <hi>Sappho,</hi> and two <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynnae,</hi> in Poetry; <hi>Cornelia,</hi> the Mother of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> and <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> doubly <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Daughter, in Eloquence. Now if it be true, that Politicks and Oeconomicks are founded upon the <U+017F>ame Principles, and there needs as much Knowledg to pre<U+017F>erve as to acquire; then <U+017F>ince Women are in a Family what Men are in a State, and are de<U+017F>tinated to keep what Men get, why <U+017F>hould not they have the knowledg of the <U+017F>ame Maxims as Men have by Study and Theory; ina<U+017F>much as the re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F>s and mode<U+017F>ty of their Sex allows them not to have the experience thereof, by frequentation of the World? Hence, our ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> left to them the Admini<U+017F>tration of the Laws, and other exerci<U+017F>es of Peace; re<U+017F>erving to them<U+017F>elves only tho<U+017F>e of War. And as for other Sciences, <U+017F>ince their <hi>Encyclopaedy</hi> is a World which hath yet many unknown or le<U+017F>s frequented Parts, if Women joyn'd together with Men in the di<U+017F>covery of them, who doubts but a feminine Curio<U+017F>ity would <U+017F>erve to exacuate the point of Mens Wits, di<U+017F>tracted by extraneous Affairs, and make marveilous progre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and find out <U+017F>undry rare Secrets, hitherto unknown.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Women are of them<U+017F>elves prone enough to take the a<U+017F>cendant over Men, without need of giving them that of Learning, which, puffing up the mind, would render them more proud and in<U+017F>upportable than before; the good opinion they would have of them<U+017F>elves, being incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to which they are bound. We read, That our fir<U+017F>t Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> was indu'd with Knowledg, but not <hi>Eve</hi>; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, her <U+017F>ole de<U+017F>ire to become knowing, by eating the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit, ruin'd the whole World. The active life of Hu<U+017F>wifry, to which they are born; the tenderne<U+017F>s of their Bodies, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the labours and <U+017F>weat wherewith Science is acquir'd; the humidity of their Brain, which is an enemy to Science; and the weakne<U+017F>s of their capricious Spirit; are <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>trong Rea<U+017F>ons to prohibit that Sex the Sciences, which require <U+017F>olidity of Judgment, always found wanting in the Writings of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men accounted the mo<U+017F>t Learned: Becau<U+017F>e Judgment is an act of the Intellect, reflecting upon its Notions; which reflection depends upon a dry Temper, contrary to that of a Womans Brain, who<U+017F>e Animal Spirits being ob<U+017F>cur'd by the clouds of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, <U+017F>he hits well <U+017F>ometimes at the fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ay, but not in <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts, which are always weaker than the fir<U+017F>t; a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ure mark of their weakne<U+017F>s: (On the contrary, the <U+017F>econd thoughts of Men prevail over the fir<U+017F>t.) Whence it is that they are heady in their de<U+017F>ires, and violent in their fir<U+017F>t Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, wherein ordinarily they have neither mea<U+017F>ure nor mediocrity: Therefore a Woman always either hates or loves; <U+017F>he never knows a mean.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:66371:27"/>The Third <U+017F>aid, Since the more imperfect a thing is, the more need it hath of being perfectionated; were the Minds of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men weak and imperfect, as is pretended, it would follow, that they have more need of the Sciences to cover their defects. Had our fir<U+017F>t Mother been indu'd with Knowledg, <U+017F>he would not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily have <U+017F>uffer'd her <U+017F>elf to be deluded by the fair promi<U+017F>es of the Devil, who rightly judging, that <hi>Adam</hi> with all his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg would have di<U+017F>cover'd his <U+017F>ubtilties, was aware of medling with him, but <U+017F>et upon the poor, ideot, and ignorant Woman. 'Tis therefore an inju<U+017F>tice to require Women to be more perfect and wi<U+017F>e than Men, and withal to interdict them the means of becoming <U+017F>o: For how <U+017F>hall they be virtuous, if they know not what Virtue is? which being a Habit of the Will (a Faculty of it <U+017F>elf blind, till illuminated by the advi<U+017F>oes of the Intellect, which are acquir'd by the Sciences) 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for them to attain it. Tho<U+017F>e who doubt le<U+017F>t the knowledg of natural things might prejudice the hone<U+017F>ty and mode<U+017F>ty of that Sex, know not that the cognition of bad things, as well as of fal<U+017F>e, is always ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t and laudable; and that the Under<U+017F>tanding is no more <U+017F>oil'd therewith, than the Sun by <U+017F>hining upon dunghils. For though the Will receive tincture of goodne<U+017F>s and evil from the objects to which it tends, yet the Under<U+017F>tanding is not corrupted by the mo<U+017F>t impure and abominable things which fall under its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Yea, <U+017F>ince Knowledg depends upon purity and <U+017F>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; which makes Divines <U+017F>ay, That Angels and <U+017F>eparated Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences are more perfect in their cognitions than Men; it <U+017F>eems, the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e Women can take for <U+017F>ecuring their purity and Cha<U+017F>tity (their only Trea<U+017F>ure) is, to make provi<U+017F>ion of Learning and Knowledg. Moreover, 'tis a thing unheard of to this day, that a Woman was Learned, and not Cha<U+017F>te and Continent; which the Ancients meant to repre<U+017F>ent by <hi>Minerva</hi> the Godde<U+017F>s of Sciences, and the Nine Mu<U+017F>es, all Virgins.</p>

All the<U+017F>e Remedies were fir<U+017F>t found out by Experience, which gave place to the mo<U+017F>t ancient Sect of Phy<U+017F>itians, call'd <hi>Emperica,</hi> invented by <hi>Acron,</hi> and afterwards <U+017F>upported by the two general Maxims of the Methodi<U+017F>ts, of whom <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>alus</hi> was Authour; which were, <hi>To loo<U+017F>en con<U+017F>tipated Bodies</hi>; and, <hi>To <U+017F>top the fluxions of others.</hi> La<U+017F>tly, They have been authoriz'd by Rea<U+017F>on, joyn'd to Experience; which hath given place to the mo<U+017F>t authentique Sect call'd the Dogmati<U+017F>ts, or Rationali<U+017F>ts, and Galeni<U+017F>ts, from their Author; proceeding upon <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Principle, who cur'd Contraries by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries; whereas the Chymi<U+017F>ts (call'd al<U+017F>o <hi>Hermeticks</hi> from <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Tri<U+017F>megi<U+017F>tus,</hi> and <hi>Spagyricks</hi> from the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of their Art, which is to <U+017F>eparate and conjoyn Bodies) cure like Maladies by like Medicaments; which they <U+017F>ay act by a propriety of their whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance again<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; not by their temperament or various mixture of contrary qualities, which neverthele<U+017F>s are alone active; for no action can be between things perfectly alike, in regard one thing acts upon another only in order to a<U+017F><U+017F>imilate the <U+017F>ame; <U+017F>o that if it be already like, there will not be any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Moreover by the rea<U+017F>on of Contraries, <U+017F>ince Health is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd by things of re<U+017F>embling Nature, it follows, That Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es mu<U+017F>t be cur'd by their Contraries. And as Health con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in Mediocrity; <U+017F>o Sickne<U+017F>s, either in Exce<U+017F>s or Defect: On which account, Phy<U+017F>ick is defin'd <hi>Detraction</hi> and <hi>Addition,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it retrenches what is <U+017F>uperfluous, and <U+017F>upplies what is deficient. Now both Exce<U+017F>s and Defect are increas'd by u<U+017F>e of things alike. Wherefore the Chymical Principle being overthrown, all the Remedies founded thereupon ought to be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That tho<U+017F>e two Principles which <U+017F>eem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to the other, are not <U+017F>o, if rightly under<U+017F>tood: For, when the Chymi<U+017F>ts <U+017F>ay, That <hi>Similia curantur <U+017F>imilibus,</hi> they <U+017F>peak not of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, as the <hi>Galeni<U+017F>ts</hi> do, with whom they agree, That the <U+017F>ame are augmented by u<U+017F>e of re<U+017F>embling things; but of the part di<U+017F>eas'd, which (being the Seat of Affections again<U+017F>t Nature) can alone be <U+017F>aid to be cur'd, and not the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; which being only a privation, errour, or di<U+017F>order of the Body, cannot be capable of <U+017F>anation, but only the parts of the Body; which the Dogmati<U+017F>ts, as well as the Chymi<U+017F>ts, cure by Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies like in <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance to the Nature of tho<U+017F>e Parts which they <U+017F>trengthen: For whatever is a Friend to Nature, call'd by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, Morborum Medicatrix,</hi> is al<U+017F>o an Enemy to that which is again<U+017F>t Nature.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Since Remedies are the more excellent, by how much the neerer they come to our Nature; it follows, That Minerals, Metals, and all Fo<U+017F><U+017F>iles, pre<U+017F>crib'd us by Chymi<U+017F>try,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66371:28"/>
having malignant and venomous qualities, are much more dangerous than the ordinary Remedies taken from Animals and Plants, which have life as well as we. However prepar'd, they always leave an evil tincture in the noble Parts, and whole Body, again<U+017F>t which they act with violence; which they have not only of their own Nature, altogether remote from ours; but al<U+017F>o from the Fire, which gives them an extraneous heat, contrary and de<U+017F>tructive to ours; any dry heat being an enemy to the natural, which is humid and benign; and although they make u<U+017F>e of Medicines extracted from Vegetables, yet 'tis with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s; <U+017F>ince their purgative virtue depends on their tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, which is wholly de<U+017F>troy'd by their Di<U+017F>tillations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions: Be<U+017F>ides that, being all hot, they are unprofitable to all acute Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es (ordinarily hot, and always the mo<U+017F>t dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) and noxious in Fevers, which are generally complicated with mo<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. Moreover, all Remedies acting by the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>econd, and third Qualities, which depend on a Matter temper'd after a particular Matter; therefore Mixts <U+017F>eparated from rheir Matter, which <U+017F>erves for a ba<U+017F>e and foundation to the actions of the Form, lo<U+017F>e their former force and virtue, which is more efficacious and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible in a material and gro<U+017F>s <U+017F>ubject, as that of ordinary Remedies is, prepar'd by decoction or infu<U+017F>ion, in <hi>Bolus,</hi> Powder, Opiate, Con<U+017F>erve, Lozenges, or <U+017F>uch other <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Body; than in an E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, Spirit, or the like <U+017F>ubtil and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious Body; which freed from its gro<U+017F><U+017F>er parts, which <U+017F>erv'd to check it, flies like lightning into the Parts of the Body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Morbifick cau<U+017F>e re<U+017F>ides, which it can never <U+017F>ubdue or eradicate, though its virtue <U+017F>hould not pre<U+017F>ently vani<U+017F>h, but be pre<U+017F>erv'd in the Body; which, be<U+017F>ides being accu<U+017F>tom'd to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things, becau<U+017F>e they con<U+017F>erve and compo<U+017F>e it, it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times receives great dammage from too <U+017F>ubtil things; on which account, the Air of the Supreme Region cannot be attracted by the Lungs.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the Characteri<U+017F>tical of a Good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament being to Cure <hi>Speedily, Certainly,</hi> and <hi>Plea<U+017F>antly</hi>; the Chymical, being <U+017F>uch, ought to be not only employ'd, but al<U+017F>o preferr'd above others. The <U+017F>peedine<U+017F>s of their Effect is from their Forms, which alone are active, e<U+017F>pecially when depurated and loo<U+017F>ned from Matter, a Principle purely pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of action. They are al<U+017F>o agreeable and <U+017F>ure, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of their impurities, malignant qualities, bad <U+017F>mells and ta<U+017F>tes, by means of the various degrees of Fire; whieh if it communicate an <hi>Empyreuma</hi> or Burntne<U+017F>s to the<U+017F>e Medicines, <U+017F>o it doth, not only to vulgar Remedies prepar'd by Fire, but al<U+017F>o to all our Meats and Aliments. Be<U+017F>ides, many of the<U+017F>e Chymical Remedies are prepar'd with a moderate heat, as that of a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, A<U+017F>hes, <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> which cannot give them <U+017F>uch <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreuma:</hi> And <U+017F>hould they all have it, yet being but an extraneous and adventitious heat, 'tis ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eparated from them, either of

it <U+017F>elf in time, or <U+017F>peedily by ablutions, wherewith even Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate <hi>Mercury</hi> is render'd very gentle, and <hi>Antimony</hi> void of all malignity. What is objected of the violence wherewith Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Metallick Medicines act, by rea<U+017F>on of their di<U+017F>proportion to our Nature, is as little con<U+017F>iderable; <U+017F>ince <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the ancient Phy<U+017F>itians, us'd <hi>Euphorbium, Hellebore, Scammony, Turbith, Colocynthis,</hi> and <U+017F>uch other mo<U+017F>t violent Remedies, which are <U+017F>till in u<U+017F>e; and <hi>Galen</hi> employ'd <hi>Steel, Sandarach,</hi> burnt <hi>Bra<U+017F>s,</hi> and the like Medicines, taken from Minerals wholly crude, and without preparation, which was unknown in his time. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> u<U+017F>es crude <hi>Mercury</hi> in his Pills again<U+017F>t the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereous Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, whereof this Mineral is the true <hi>Panacaea: Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> crude <hi>Antimony; Ge<U+017F>ner, Vitriol; Fallopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Crocus Martis</hi> again<U+017F>t the Jaundies; almo<U+017F>t all Phy<U+017F>itians, <hi>Sulphur,</hi> again<U+017F>t the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Lungs; and <U+017F>uch Patients as cannot be cur'd by ordinary Remedies, they <U+017F>end to Mineral Waters. And <U+017F>ince not only Garlick, Onyons, and Mu<U+017F>tard, which we u<U+017F>e in our Diet; but al<U+017F>o the Juices of Lemmons, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, Berberries, and Cantharides, although corro<U+017F>ive, are <U+017F>till in u<U+017F>e; why <U+017F>hould we not u<U+017F>e Chymical Medicines in <U+017F>mall quantity, purg'd from their corro<U+017F>ion, and taken with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Waters and Vehicles?</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, There is in all natural things a certain fix'd Spirit, the <U+017F>ole principle of their Virtues and Operations; which being <U+017F>eparated from them, they remain only Carca<U+017F><U+017F>es without Souls: As is <U+017F>een in Earth, render'd barren by extraction of its ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Salt; in Wine dead or <U+017F>owre; and in the in<U+017F>ipid phlegm of the <U+017F>ame Wine, <U+017F>eparated from its Spirit by Chymical di<U+017F>tillation, which <U+017F>eparates the good from the bad, the pure from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, the <U+017F>ubtil from the gro<U+017F>s, the form from its more cra<U+017F>s matter; in a word, the Spirit from its Body; which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the virtue of the whole Mixt, reduc'd into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrow Volume, is very active and proper, not only to <U+017F>erve for Aliment to an Animal, which is nouri<U+017F>h'd with this Spirit, the re<U+017F>t being unprofitable, and as <U+017F>uch converted into Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but al<U+017F>o principally for the curing of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, by repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <U+017F>trengthning the fix'd Spirits, which are the true feats of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, as well as of Health; a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e being nothing but the lae<U+017F>ion of the Functions, whereof the Spirits are the Principles; whereas ordinary Phy<U+017F>itians, in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>eparating the virtues of each Mixt, to oppo<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame, as Specifical Remedies to all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, as the Chymi<U+017F>ts do, <U+017F>tifle and de<U+017F>troy them by the confus'd mixture of abundance of Simples and Drugs, whereof their Medicaments are compounded, which by this means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a new temperament and particular virtue, re<U+017F>ulting from the ingredients, who<U+017F>e qualities and properties are abated, or rather extingui<U+017F>h'd; in like manner as of the Elements uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together is made a Compound wholly different from its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Wherefore we may ju<U+017F>tly retort again<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch Remedies,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66371:29"/>
what they charge upon tho<U+017F>e of Chymi<U+017F>try; namely, That they are taken from dead Ingredients, corrupted and depriv'd, by the Fire, of their Radical Humidity, wherein, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted their prime purgative virtue, which is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated; <U+017F>ince when a Nur<U+017F>e takes a Purge, the <U+017F>trength of the Phy<U+017F>ick is convey'd by her Milk to the Child; and we feed <U+017F>he-Goats and Pullen with Purgatives, to render the Milk of the one, and the Fle<U+017F>h of the other <U+017F>uch. However, <U+017F>ince there, are <U+017F>o many incurable Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, who<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es are <U+017F>ufficiently known, but to which no Specifical Remedies are found; Chymi<U+017F>try, which opens the means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the <U+017F>olution of all Bodies, ought to be cheri<U+017F>h'd, and not condemn'd, as it is by the ignorant or malicious, who mu<U+017F>t at lea<U+017F>t acknowledg it one of the members of Phy<U+017F>ick, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Pharmacy, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the choice and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Medicaments, and is part of the Therapeutical Divi<U+017F>ion. But we <U+017F>ay rather, That the three parts of Medicine, or its three ancient Sects, are the three parts of the World, <hi>Europe, A<U+017F>ia,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi>; and Chymi<U+017F>try is that new World, lately di<U+017F>cover'd, not le<U+017F>s rare and admirable than the others, provided it be as carefully cultivated, and re<U+017F>cu'd out of the hands of Barbarians.</p>
            <p>Upon the Second Point it was <U+017F>aid, That Truth is not the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> mo<U+017F>t powerful thing in the World;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Whether the reading of Romances be profitable.</hi>
               </note> <U+017F>ince oftentimes Fables and Romances have more attractives, and no fewer followers than Hi<U+017F>tories; as the Poets meant to <U+017F>ignifie by the Fable of <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> who fell in Love with a Statue. For Romances, which are nothing el<U+017F>e but the Images of a phanta<U+017F>tick Beauty, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s lov'd and idolatris'd by abundance of Per<U+017F>ons; not only for the Eloquence, who<U+017F>e faire<U+017F>t lines are <U+017F>een in tho<U+017F>e fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Books; but for the Gracefulne<U+017F>s and Gallantry of the actions of their Per<U+017F>onages, which may <U+017F>erve for a perfect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Virtue; which having never been found compleat in all points in any Illu<U+017F>trious Man, who<U+017F>e Life is always blemi<U+017F>h'd with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>pot, Hi<U+017F>tory cannot give us a perfect example to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, unle<U+017F>s it be a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by Romances; without which, Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions purely Hi<U+017F>torical, de<U+017F>cribing a naked fact, are but excar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Sceletons, and like the fir<U+017F>t lines of a Picture gro<U+017F>ly trac'd with a Crayon, and con<U+017F>equently di<U+017F>agreeable, if artifice give them not colour and <U+017F>hadows. Thus <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and in our times Don <hi>Guevara,</hi> aiming to draw the Model of a perfect Prince, one in the Per<U+017F>on of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the other of <hi>Marcus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> have heap'd together <U+017F>o many contrarieties to Truth, that they have made rather Romances of them than Hi<U+017F>tories. Thus <hi>Achilles</hi>'s exploits appear far otherwi<U+017F>e in <hi>Homer</hi> than in <hi>Dictys Creten<U+017F>is</hi>; tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> in <hi>Eginard</hi> and <hi>Ario<U+017F>to,</hi> than in the Annals: 'Tis to Romances that they owe half their Glory; and if their Example hath given any excitation to the Readers Spirits, 'tis what the Romances aim'd at, not the Hi<U+017F>tories. The Romancer is the Ma<U+017F>ter and Contriver of his Subject; the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>torian
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66371:30"/>
is the Slave of it. And as by refraction of the vi<U+017F>ual rays, variou<U+017F>ly reflected in a triangular Gla<U+017F>s, is form'd an <hi>Iris</hi> of colours, which although not real yet cea<U+017F>e not to plea<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o by the variety of tho<U+017F>e accidents, variou<U+017F>ly interwoven with the mixtures of Truth and Fiction, is form'd <U+017F>o agreeable a Medley, that it delights more in its Inventions than the Body of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Hi<U+017F>tory; from which Romances borrowing the mo<U+017F>t me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable accidents, may be term'd the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence and Abridgment of the <U+017F>ame, re-uniting all the Beauty, Plea<U+017F>ure, and Profit which they afford: For the<U+017F>e Books <U+017F>erve not only for delight, but profit; the one never being without the other; <U+017F>ince Fair, which is the object of Delight; and Good, of Profit; are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal and in<U+017F>eparable: And the plea<U+017F>ure we take in any thing is an infallible mark of its goodne<U+017F>s and utility; which is <U+017F>o much the greater in Romances, as they in<U+017F>truct with plea<U+017F>ure, artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially marrying Benefit and Delectation. Under <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed Names they freely tax, without incurring the envy or hatred of tho<U+017F>e whom they reprehend. Thus the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable drew from <hi>David</hi> the condemnation of his Crime; which otherwi<U+017F>e po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he would never have own'd, or at lea<U+017F>t would have excus'd in his own Per<U+017F>on. As for the abu<U+017F>e and danger of reading the<U+017F>e Books, for the mo<U+017F>t part fill'd with di<U+017F>hone<U+017F>t Loves 'tis common to them with the be<U+017F>t things of the World, that they may be turn'd to a bad u<U+017F>e: But if the Love be hone<U+017F>t and lawful (as it proves always in conclu<U+017F>ion) the Romances de<U+017F>erve no blame for it; if unlawful, the Lovers have always an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py end; and Vices are never unpuni<U+017F>h'd. 'Tis here that Di<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive Ju<U+017F>tice is exactly kept; not by the blind Judgment of Fortune, but by the judicious choice of the Author; that the Good are always rewarded, and the Wicked puni<U+017F>h'd. For the object of Romances, as well as of Hi<U+017F>tories, is the de<U+017F>cription of humane actions; which being mo<U+017F>t often bad, by rea<U+017F>on of the depravation of Nature, they appear more <U+017F>candalou<U+017F>ly in Hi<U+017F>tory than in Romances. Why therefore do not their Cen<U+017F>ors likewi<U+017F>e pro<U+017F>cribe Hi<U+017F>tories, <U+017F>o much more dangerous, as they afford us many true examples of Sacriledges, Parricides, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Ince<U+017F>ts, the Authors whereof have e<U+017F>caped puni<U+017F>hment. And not to <U+017F>peak of the dangerous Maxims of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>; Who would take the Fables of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and the Prodigies of <hi>Livie,</hi> for more probable things then tho<U+017F>e of Romances? To omit the contrariety of Hi<U+017F>torians of the <U+017F>ame time; <U+017F>o that we may <U+017F>ay, That the true<U+017F>t among<U+017F>t them is the mo<U+017F>t likely.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, If the Platoni<U+017F>ts <U+017F>aying be true, <hi>That there is nothing real in this World; but we perceive only <U+017F>hadows and phanta<U+017F>ms in this life,</hi> which the Scripture compares to a Dream; there will be little difference, as to realty, between a Hi<U+017F>tory and a Romance. And though the one be a meer fiction, yet this will no more infer the de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ing of it, than it doth of a Comedy, becau<U+017F>e the Actors are not the very Per<U+017F>onages; or of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66371:30"/>
a Landskip or Per<U+017F>pective well drawn, only becau<U+017F>e 'tis the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Painter, and not of Nature; who<U+017F>e Works, as excellent as they are, yet yield to tho<U+017F>e of Art, which we e<U+017F>teem above the true and natural, from which the <U+017F>ame are counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; our minds extreamly delighting in Imitations; whence it is that we <U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teem in their Copies and Repre<U+017F>entations <U+017F>uch things who<U+017F>e Originals are di<U+017F>agreeable to us. But that which augments the glory of Romances is, that their declared enemies have not been able to encounter them but by Romances too; as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>I<U+017F>ocrates</hi> could not reprehend the Sophi<U+017F>ters, but by making u<U+017F>e of their Eloquence.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That Romances are commonly either of the valorous Exploits of Knights, or of Amorous pa<U+017F><U+017F>-times. The fir<U+017F>t are for the mo<U+017F>t part ridiculous, and full of Knights Errant, who force Enchanted Ca<U+017F>tles, kill Mon<U+017F>ters, Giants, and Men like Flies. The latter are infamous, contrary to Good Manners, and dangerous to young Per<U+017F>ons, entertaining them in a loo<U+017F>e Idlene<U+017F>s, the Mother of all Vices; be<U+017F>ides the dangerous impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions tho<U+017F>e Lies leave in tender Minds, and which remain therein all their life after. But this belongs to all fabulous Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, that they denote weakne<U+017F>s of Judgment in tho<U+017F>e addicted to them, and a di<U+017F>orderly Wit in their Authors. And <U+017F>ince, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Phy<U+017F>itians, the fir<U+017F>t degree of Folly is to imagine phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tical Opinions; and the <U+017F>econd, to tell them to others; the third (in my conceit) will be, to write them.</p>

For as the Sun may lighten or heat a mans Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, as well as a Man; <U+017F>o may the Stars give their influences to the Figure of a Thing, as well as to the Thing it <U+017F>elf; e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the <U+017F>ubject is fitted thereunto, as the <hi>Tali<U+017F>man</hi> is; not only by its metallick matter, <U+017F>ymbolizing with that of the Star, both in colour and <U+017F>olidity; but e<U+017F>pecially by the Figure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66371:31"/>
on it, which is like the Sign who<U+017F>e influences it receives. For though the Con<U+017F>tellation be not very like that Figure, yet in regard the Qualities of the Animal which the Figure repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ents, are like tho<U+017F>e of the Sign, (whence the Con<U+017F>tellations of the Zodiack are call'd, The <hi>Ram,</hi> the <hi>Bull, &amp;c.</hi> not for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emblance of <U+017F>uch Animals parts with tho<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e Signs) the Figure of the Animals attracts them of the <U+017F>ame Sign much more powerfully by <U+017F>ympathy. And indeed we <U+017F>ee many things have qualities con<U+017F>entaneous to the Figure they bear; as the Stone call'd <hi>Ophites,</hi> for the <U+017F>mall veins which cut it in form of little Serpents, cures their poy<U+017F>on; as al<U+017F>o the Stones of <hi>Maltha</hi> do, which bear the Figure of a Serpents-tongue; and the Herb call'd by that name: The Squill and the Poppy, which re<U+017F>emble the head, a<U+017F><U+017F>wage the pains thereof: Wild Tan<U+017F>ey and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright cure the Eye, whereto they are like. But if it be <U+017F>aid, That 'tis not the Figure that acts in them, but a particular vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue depending on the temper of their Qualities; <U+017F>ince lo<U+017F>ing their Figure either by di<U+017F>tillation or infu<U+017F>ion, (they cea<U+017F>e not to act, yea more effectually than before. I an<U+017F>wer, That in the <U+017F>pirits of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ame active qualities remains always the Form and Figure; as <U+017F>ome Chymi<U+017F>ts have re<U+017F>u<U+017F>citated Ro<U+017F>es and other Flowers, by holding their a<U+017F>hes in a gla<U+017F>s Phial, over a Candle.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That <hi>Tali<U+017F>mans</hi> cannot produce the effects attributed to them; whether you con<U+017F>ider them in their Matter and Sub<U+017F>tance, or in their Figure. Not in the former; for any <U+017F>ort of Matter, as Wood, Wax, Stone, Metal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are made u<U+017F>e of for cutting of the<U+017F>e <hi>Tali<U+017F>mans</hi>; which, be<U+017F>ides, lo<U+017F>e their Name when they produce an effect by the virtue of their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as a Scorpion engraven on a Bezoar-<U+017F>tone would not cure the bitings of that venomous Animal by its <hi>Tali<U+017F>manical</hi> Figure, no more than any other; but 'tis an effect depending on the Stone it <U+017F>elf. Nor do Simples cure by the re<U+017F>emblance between the Parts of our Body and their external Figure (of which we <U+017F>peak here), but by the virtue and property of their Sub<U+017F>tance, which remains when they are powder'd and de<U+017F>poil'd of their Figure; which, moreover, is a Quality indeed, but no active one; being only a certain <U+017F>ituation and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of Parts, and a mode of quantity; which depending on Matter, a purely pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive thing, is as uncapable of any action by it <U+017F>elf, as the Figure which terminates it. But though the artificial Figure of a <hi>Tali<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> could act, it could produce no natural effect, becau<U+017F>e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its power; much le<U+017F>s upon the Will, to incite Love or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, as is pretended. For 'tis a ridiculous and groundle<U+017F>s vanity to imagine a <U+017F>ympathetical Commerce between a Con<U+017F>tellation and a Figure of an Animal, graven upon Copper, or <U+017F>uch other Matter, which is much le<U+017F>s fit to receive the influences of the Stars to which <U+017F>uch Animal is <U+017F>ubject, than the Animal it <U+017F>elf, who<U+017F>e skin <U+017F>tuff'd with <U+017F>traw were more proper to drive away
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66371:32"/>
other Bea<U+017F>ts of the <U+017F>ame kind; there being nothing Living-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures dread <U+017F>o much as the dead Bodies of their own kind.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, It needs not to <U+017F>eek Rea<U+017F>ons and Authorities to prove <hi>Tali<U+017F>mans,</hi> either in Art or Nature; <U+017F>ince Man him<U+017F>elf may be <U+017F>aid to be the <hi>Tali<U+017F>man</hi> and Perfection of God's Works, plac'd by him at the Centre of the Univer<U+017F>e; as of old <hi>Tali<U+017F>mans</hi> were plac'd at the Foundations of Cities: His countenance being a Medal imprinted with all the Characters of the Stars, the two brighte<U+017F>t of which are at the Eyes; <hi>Saturn</hi> at the Eye-brows, the Seat of Severity; <hi>Jupiter</hi> at the Fore-head, the place of Honour; <hi>Mars</hi> at the No<U+017F>e, where Anger re<U+017F>ides; <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Mouth, where Eloquence lies; <hi>Venus</hi> at the Chin, and rounding of the Cheeks, the pourfit of the grace of this Medal, which <U+017F>erves him for an Univer<U+017F>al <hi>Tali<U+017F>man,</hi> in its Beauty to procure Love; in its Maje<U+017F>ty, to cau<U+017F>e Re<U+017F>pect; not only to drive away Flies or Frogs, but to reign over all Animals, by the prerogative of this Face, before which they tremble. Are not his Hands (the Artificers of his Felicity) <hi>Tali<U+017F>mans</hi> noted with the Characters of the Signs and Planets, which the Rules of Chiromancy uncypher? In the Right Hand are his Days and Years, (<U+017F>aith the Wi<U+017F>eman) the <hi>Tali<U+017F>man</hi> of his long life; in the Left are Riches and Honours, the <hi>Tali<U+017F>man</hi> of his good Fortune. In <U+017F>hort, Is not his Soul the <hi>Tali<U+017F>man</hi> of his Immortality; which at the in<U+017F>tant of its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion receiving all the influences of the Deity, and retaining the Image thereof, hath been in<U+017F>erted into this Work, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve it from Thunder and Tempe<U+017F>ts, which can touch only the lea<U+017F>t part of it; but from Corruption and Extinction, to which all other Creatures are <U+017F>ubject.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, He's too <U+017F>en<U+017F>ual that impugns the truth of things, under pretext that they fall not under our Rea<U+017F>on; which though very weak and uncertain, abu<U+017F>ing the principality which it u<U+017F>urps over all the Faculties, hath turn'd its denomination into Tyrannie: Whence if Experiences be alledg'd <U+017F>he denies them, becau<U+017F>e not able to accord them with the weakne<U+017F>s of her Judgment. Witne<U+017F>s what is <U+017F>een in all the admirable works of Nature and Art, in the Magnetical cure of Wounds, and that of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, by Amulets or Periapts; and what <hi>Cicero</hi> and all Antiquity affirms of <hi>Gyges</hi>'s Ring, upon turning of the Stone whereof inwards, he became invi<U+017F>ible; and returning it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was perceiv'd. Such al<U+017F>o was <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Shield, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Per<U+017F>eus</hi> combated the <hi>Gorgons,</hi> which was of Gla<U+017F>s, through which one might <U+017F>ee, without being <U+017F>een; as al<U+017F>o the Rings of tho<U+017F>e Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Charlemain.</hi> For if it be <U+017F>aid of the fir<U+017F>t, That <hi>Olympias</hi> <U+017F>hewing her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>tark naked to him, made him confe<U+017F>s, That the great Beauty of all the parts of her Body was the only <hi>Tali<U+017F>man</hi> wherewith <U+017F>he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted <hi>Alexander</hi>: The <U+017F>ame cannot be <U+017F>aid of the latter; <U+017F>ince after his death the <hi>Tali<U+017F>manical</hi> Ring found under her Tongue caus'd <hi>Charlemain</hi> to love not only her, but al<U+017F>o the Lake of

               <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle</hi> whereinto it was ca<U+017F>t; and that which was found in the Foundations of the Walls of this City of <hi>Paris,</hi> under <hi>Chilperic,</hi> where there was a Fire engraven upon a Bra<U+017F>s-plate, a Serpent, and a Rat; which having been remov'd from the place, the very next day a great Fire happened in the <U+017F>ame City. For if every thing below is as that which is above, and the effects of inferiour things proceed from the various configuration of the Cele<U+017F>tial Bodies, as of the different combinations of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Alphabet are compos'd infinite Books, there may be <U+017F>ome proportion and corre<U+017F>pondence between tho<U+017F>e Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>tial Figures, and <U+017F>uch as are made upon fit and <U+017F>uitable mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials; the knowledg of which <U+017F>ympathetical Corre<U+017F>pondences, is the true Magick; which is, by the te<U+017F>timony of <hi>J. Picus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randula,</hi> the highe<U+017F>t point of humane Knowledg, marrying Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with Earth; as black Magick is dete<U+017F>table, <U+017F>hameful, and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That every thing acts in the World by the fir<U+017F>t or <U+017F>econd Qualities, or by its Sub<U+017F>tance; whence proceed occult Properties and Sympathies: But Tali<U+017F>manical Figures cannot act by any of the<U+017F>e ways; for 'tis certain, that they act neither by heat, cold, hardne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, or <U+017F>uch other fir<U+017F>t or <U+017F>econd Quality, no more than by their Sub<U+017F>tance, which is different in <hi>Tali<U+017F>mans</hi> of Copper, Iron, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Although the Authors of this Art a<U+017F>cribe the <U+017F>ame virtue to all, provided they be graven with the <U+017F>ame Figures, and under the <U+017F>ame Con<U+017F>tellations and A<U+017F>pects of the Starrs, from whom alone they make them derive their, <U+017F>trange virtues; alledging, as a Principle, That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World but hath both its Contrary and its Like, as well in Heaven as on Earth; where we <U+017F>ee not only the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold and the Sun-flower follow the motion of the Sun; the Sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notrope, that of the Moon; the Cock proclaims the approach of the Sun: As al<U+017F>o, on the contrary, Dogs commonly run mad in the Dog-days, and Lions under the Sign <hi>Leo</hi>: But al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome Per<U+017F>ons beheld with an evil eye by <U+017F>ome Planets, others being propitious. So to cure hot and dry Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es they engrave their <hi>Tali<U+017F>mans</hi> under a Con<U+017F>tellation contrary to the Evil, as cold and moi<U+017F>t; having regard to the Signs whereunto every Malady and di<U+017F>eas'd Part is referr'd; which is an Invention of <hi>Paracel<U+017F>us,</hi> who fancies Poles, a Zenith, a Nadir, an Equator, a Zodiack, and other phanta<U+017F>tical Figures in our Bodies, an<U+017F>wering to tho<U+017F>e of Heaven, without the lea<U+017F>t proof of his <U+017F>ayings.</p>
            <p>Upon the Second Point it was <U+017F>aid, Since Man is compos'd of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Body and Soul,<note place="margin">

of <hi>Calena,</hi> at this day <hi>Carignola</hi> in <hi>Campania</hi>; that which burnt for <U+017F>ixteen years together a great part of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and not long <U+017F>ince the I<U+017F>land of St. <hi>George,</hi> which is one of the <hi>A<U+017F>ores</hi>; and divers other fat Lands near the Sea, which continually <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies unctuous matter to the<U+017F>e Conflagrations; whence the mo<U+017F>t remarkable of them are <U+017F>een in I<U+017F>lands, and other maritim pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> who place Fire in the entrails of the Earth, as its Centre, would not be <U+017F>o much at a lo<U+017F>s here, as tho<U+017F>e who with <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> hold, That it is there in a violent <U+017F>tate, and contrary to its Nature, which requires the highe<U+017F>t part of the World. For <U+017F>ince nothing violent can be of long duration, How is it that Fire, the mo<U+017F>t active of all the Elements, hath not hitherto been able to free it <U+017F>elf out of its Pri<U+017F>on, and get out of this <U+017F>tate of confinement? 'Tis better therefore to <U+017F>ay, That Fire being the principal Agent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to all <U+017F>orts of Generations which are made in all places, is likewi<U+017F>e found every where, e<U+017F>pecially in the Earth, where it is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, and is pre<U+017F>erv'd longe<U+017F>t, in regard of the <U+017F>olidity of its Matter: For Fire cannot <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t without Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which <U+017F>erves it for Food and Aliment: Whence the Poets de<U+017F>crib'd <hi>Vulcan,</hi> the God of Fire, lame; intimating its need of fewel and <U+017F>u<U+017F>tenance to <U+017F>upport it; none of which being found under the Orb of the Moon, above the higher Region of the Air, 'tis rea<U+017F>onable to judg, that there is no other Elementary Fire on high but that of the Sun; who by his heat, light, and other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, concurs more perfectly to the generation of all Mixts, than that invi<U+017F>ible and imaginary Fire. 'Tis therefore nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that Fire have Matter to feed upon; otherwi<U+017F>e it dies and vani<U+017F>hes, not only in an Enemy-country, and among its Contraries, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to de<U+017F>troy it; but al<U+017F>o in its own <U+017F>phere or centre, wherever it be, <U+017F>ince it mu<U+017F>t needs act there; otherwi<U+017F>e it would be weaker in its Centre than out of it: But it cannot act upon it <U+017F>elf; for then it <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>troy it <U+017F>elf: But nothing acts upon it <U+017F>elf; and therefore it mu<U+017F>t act upon <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ubject be<U+017F>ides it <U+017F>elf. Wherefore the Matter of all Fire is any oylie, fat, and aerious Body; whence A<U+017F>hes, wholly de<U+017F>poil'd of that unctuous humidity, are incombu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tible. That of Subterranean Fires is of two <U+017F>ort, Sulphur and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen; both which are ob<U+017F>erv'd plentiful in burning places. The Live or Fo<U+017F><U+017F>ile Sulphur, which <U+017F>erves for Matter to the<U+017F>e Fires, is a terre<U+017F>trial fat or oyl, mingled with the <U+017F>lime of the Earth: For, the other <U+017F>ort of Sulphur, found on the <U+017F>urface of Stones, is nothing but the purer part of the former, which being <U+017F>ublim'd by heat, is <U+017F>top'd and condens'd by tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>olid Bodies into a Matter call'd Flowers of Sulphur; by which example Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>try makes the like Flowers. The Bitumen is al<U+017F>o a fat juice; which is either liquid, like Oyl, call'd by <U+017F>ome <hi>Petroleum,</hi> and the <hi>Naphtha</hi> of the <hi>Babylonians</hi>; <U+017F>o inflammable that it attracts Fire at a di<U+017F>tance, and retains it in the Water, which <U+017F>erves it for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66371:34"/>
nouri<U+017F>hment; as is <U+017F>een in that Bituminous Fountain which burns four Leagues from <hi>Grenoble</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and many other, which ca<U+017F>t forth both Flames add Waters at the <U+017F>ame Out-let. There is <U+017F>ome too, of the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of <U+017F>oft Wax; as that <U+017F>limy Bitumen floating upon the Lake of <hi>Sodome</hi>: Some other hard, like the Pit-coal, call'd <hi>Tourbe,</hi> whereof our Mar<U+017F>hes are full; which is the mo<U+017F>t general Matter of Subterranean Fires; to who<U+017F>e violence the Nitre found there, may al<U+017F>o contribute: for as Bituminous Earth makes the<U+017F>e Fires durable, which otherwi<U+017F>e could not <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t <U+017F>o long with Sulphur alone, which pre<U+017F>ently is evaporated and <U+017F>pent: So the Nitre and Saltpeter (wherewith the Earth is every where impregnated, and which hath been before <U+017F>hewn to be the cau<U+017F>e of its fertility) is the cau<U+017F>e of their impetuo<U+017F>ity and violence, which the <U+017F>ituation of places may al<U+017F>o promote.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Earth, as well as the Air, hath three Regions in its profundity; the fir<U+017F>t temper'd and alter'd either apparently or really, according to the various di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the ambient Air: The <U+017F>econd or middle, extreamly cold: The third always hot and burning. And as the Matter of Thunder is a Sulphureous, Nitrous, and Bituminous Exhalation of the Earth, drawn up by the Sun to the middle Region of the Air, where 'tis inflam'd by Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is of the ambient cold (becau<U+017F>e being in the next di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to Inflammation, the lea<U+017F>t concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent circum<U+017F>tance pre<U+017F>ently reduces that Power into Act:) So the inclo<U+017F>ed and difficultly evaporable heat of the Earth, finding the <U+017F>ame ea<U+017F>ily-inflammable Matter there, namely, the Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which i<U+017F><U+017F>ue from that third Subterranean Region upon the opening of Mines, which te<U+017F>tifie by their <U+017F>mell, thickne<U+017F>s, and other qualities, how much they partake of Minerals; the<U+017F>e hot and dry Exhalations a<U+017F>cending to the <U+017F>econd Region of the Earth, there meet with cold Spaces, which being for the mo<U+017F>t part hollow or cavernous, and <U+017F>tor'd with Sulphur, Bitumen, and other fat Earths, become inflam'd by the Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is of cold and the proximity of tho<U+017F>e Materials. And becau<U+017F>e the Earth which feeds the<U+017F>e Fires con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of two parts; the one arid, and the other unctuous; this unctuo<U+017F>ity approaching nearer the Fire, coming to be con<U+017F>um'd, the Fire mu<U+017F>t needs be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>h'd; till the heat, excited by the conflagration of many years, having attracted all the unctuo<U+017F>ity of the neighbouring Earth, and this having by degrees impregnated that dry. Earth which the Chymi<U+017F>ts call <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> it becomes again inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, and continues fir'd till the <U+017F>ame be de<U+017F>iccated again; and <U+017F>o forward in a circle; nothing hindring but that, as Plume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Stone-allume is an eternally incombu<U+017F>tible Wiek, provided it be <U+017F>upply'd with new Oyl when the former is <U+017F>pent, this Earth may do the like: Unle<U+017F>s we had rather, that wi<U+017F>e Nature di<U+017F>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es combu<U+017F>tible matter in the bellies of Mountains, after the manner of <hi>Vitruvius</hi>'s his Lamps, which need filling but once a

Or el<U+017F>e, that Nature (excepting the extraordinary eruptions which <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome happen to the<U+017F>e flammivomous Mountains, and then only when the Fire cannot get i<U+017F><U+017F>ue but by violence) makes what the curious often a<U+017F>pire to, an inextingui<U+017F>hable Fire, or perpetual Light, by re<U+017F>olving again into oyly and combu<U+017F>tible matter that which was evaporated by Inflammation; as Water elevated in vapour by heat, falls down again in the <U+017F>ame form. The Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, Nature, finding Cavities great enough in tho<U+017F>e va<U+017F>t Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to facilitate what Art finds impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>malne<U+017F>s of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which extingui<U+017F>h Fire when it hath not Air, or <U+017F>uffer its Matter to exhale when it hath; although S. <hi>Au<U+017F>tin</hi> and <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi> make mention, the former of a Lamp in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> which could not be extingui<U+017F>h'd or con<U+017F>um'd, though neither Oyl nor Wiek were put to it; and the latter, of another burning Lamp found in a Sepulchre, where it had been fifteen hundred years, but upon admi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Air forthwith went out. Although without recurring to this <U+017F>ubtilty, that of Fire, and its activity, is <U+017F>ufficient to attract or fetch in its <U+017F>ulphureous food; which being only an excrement of the Earth, and like the <U+017F>oot of our Chimneys, is found every where, but e<U+017F>pecially in Mines, which are repair'd in le<U+017F>s time than is believ'd, and who<U+017F>e various qualities make the variety of the<U+017F>e Subterraneous Fires, of their duration, continuity, and interval; which <U+017F>ome have compar'd to Intermitting Fevers, excited in our Bodies by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous heat, which holds the <U+017F>ame place in us as Fire doth in the Earth.</p>

Now if it be true, as 'tis <U+017F>aid, That Life is a Puni<U+017F>hment, and a Summary of Mi<U+017F>eries, Old-age, as neere<U+017F>t the haven and end of Infelicities, is the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>irable. Moreover, being more perfect by experience, and alone fit to judg of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of Ages, which it hath run through, we mu<U+017F>t refer our <U+017F>elves to the goodne<U+017F>s of its judgment, as well in this as in all other Points.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Since to live is to act, the mo<U+017F>t perfect and agreeable of all Ages of Life is that in which we be<U+017F>t exerci<U+017F>e the functions of Body and Mind; namely, Youth (which alone <U+017F>eems fit to di<U+017F>pute the Prize with Old-age) not only in regard of the health and vigour of the Body, wherein it <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>es that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining feeble Age; but al<U+017F>o of the actions of the Mind, which is much more lively in young, inventive, and indu<U+017F>trious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons, than in the aged, who<U+017F>e Spirit wears and grows wor<U+017F>e with the Body; which hath given place to that mo<U+017F>t true Proverb, <hi>That Old-men are twice Children.</hi> For 'tis to give Wi<U+017F>edom a <U+017F>hameful Extraction, and to make it the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of Infirmity, to call that ripe which is rotten, and to believe that good coun<U+017F>els pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed only from defect of natural heat; <U+017F>ince, according to his judgment who hath be<U+017F>t decypher'd Wi<U+017F>dom, this Old-age traces more wrincles in our Minds than Faces; and there are few Souls which by growing old become not <U+017F>owr and rancid, and acquire not many vices and ill habits; of which Covetou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s alone, in<U+017F>eparable from Old-age, (and an Argument of weakne<U+017F>s of Mind, in heaping up with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>olicitude what mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>oon be parted with) is not much le<U+017F>s prejudicial to the State than all the di<U+017F>orders of Youth. But if the Chief Good con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the Sciences, the Cau<U+017F>e of Young-men is infallible; for acutene<U+017F>s of Wit, <U+017F>trength of Phancy, and goodne<U+017F>s of Memory (which wholly abandons Old-men), and ability to undergo pains and watchings, mu<U+017F>t contribute to their acqui<U+017F>ition. And if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>ecret delight we take in exerci<U+017F>ing virtuous Actions, Young-men, who, according to Chancellour <hi>Bacon,</hi> excel in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, will carry it above Old; it being certain, That the be<U+017F>t actions of our Lives are perform'd between twenty and thirty, or thereabouts, which was the Age at which <hi>Adam</hi> was created in Paradi<U+017F>e; as our Saviour accompli<U+017F>h'd the My<U+017F>tery of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption at the Age of thirty three years, which <U+017F>hall be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e the Age at which the Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>hall ri<U+017F>e to Glory, in which every one <U+017F>hall enjoy <U+017F>uch a perfect Youth as we a<U+017F>cribe to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and put off Old-age, which, not much differing from Death, may, like it, be term'd the Wages of Sin; <U+017F>ince, had our fir<U+017F>t Parent per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in Innocence, we <U+017F>hould have po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd a perpetual Youth. Moreover, 'tis at this Age that the greate<U+017F>t Men have appear'd: Few Old Conquerours have been <U+017F>een; if

any, he hath this of <hi>Alexander,</hi> That he a<U+017F>pires to the Conque<U+017F>t of another World, not having long to live in this. Wherefore in<U+017F>tead of pretending any advantage over other Ages, Old-men ought to be contented that we u<U+017F>e them not as tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Cea</hi> and the <hi>Ma<U+017F><U+017F>agetes</hi> did, who drown'd them; or the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ca<U+017F>t them from a Bridg into <hi>Tyber,</hi> thinking it a pious act to free them from life, who<U+017F>e length di<U+017F>pleas'd the Patriarchs, the Scripture <U+017F>aying, <hi>That they died full of</hi> (or, <U+017F>atiated with) <hi>days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Innocence of Children <U+017F>hould make us de<U+017F>ire their Age; con<U+017F>idering that our Lord requires us to be like them, that we may enter into his Kingdom. Moreover, Nature, unable to perpetuate Infancy, hath found no <U+017F>weeter Anodyne for the mi<U+017F>eries and melancholy of Old-people than the <U+017F>ight of Children, and the memory of things done or learnt in their minority; which partakes the more of its <U+017F>ource, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, the le<U+017F>s 'tis remov'd from it.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, Youth hath too many extravagances to be accounted happy; and 'twould be again<U+017F>t the order of Nature if (the Extreams) Infancy and Old-age contain'd more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction than that which holds the Middle, wherein <U+017F>he hath e<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli<U+017F>h'd the Virtue of all things. The weakne<U+017F>s of the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hews that it hath not wherewith to content it <U+017F>elf, but needs <U+017F>upport from others, and is therefore an object of Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which never ari<U+017F>es but from Mi<U+017F>ery. Its Innocence, proceeding only from impotence and imperfection of the Soul's operations, hath nothing commendable; and 'tis as much unable to will as do good: But true Innocence con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the acting of difficult good. If Child-hood fear not the Future, it receives a pre<U+017F>ent Evil with more pain, and is as <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>contents, as incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of con<U+017F>olation, or prudence to avoid them; nor can it by hope anticipate or prolong the enjoyment of a future good. In <U+017F>hort, He cannot be happy who is not con<U+017F>cious of his happine<U+017F>s, as Children cannot be. Then for Old-age, 'tis a <U+017F>econd Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and more to be pitied, in that it always grows wor<U+017F>e, partakes all the defects of Nonage, and hath this wor<U+017F>e, that its de<U+017F>ires, awaken'd by the memory of pa<U+017F>t contentments, upbraid its impotence; and the thir<U+017F>t of getting is at perpetual jar with the fear of leaving: Aches, the forerunners of Death, dayly attaque its patience; and there remains no cure of its Evils, but the extremity of all Evils, <hi>To be no more.</hi> Infancy is therefore like the Spring, which hath only Flowers, and expects Fruits hereafter; <U+017F>o that 'tis an Age of Hope without Enjoyment. Youth hath only Summer-fruits, of little la<U+017F>ting. Old-age is a Winter, without either Flowers or Fruits, po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ing only Evils pre<U+017F>ent, and oblig'd to fear all and lo<U+017F>e all. But Man-hood, betwixt the<U+017F>e two, re<U+017F>embles <hi>Autumn,</hi> denoted by the Horn of Plenty, po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es the felicity of Life, enjoys the Goods acquired, and by hope anticipates tho<U+017F>e to come; it hath a Soul commonly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant with the Body, the Faculties of that making a <U+017F>weet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66371:36"/>
with the Actions of this. On the contrary, the Soul in Child-hood <U+017F>eems not to be well in tune with the Body; in Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>cence 'tis always at di<U+017F>cord with the Appetites of Sen<U+017F>e; and in Old-age it jars with it <U+017F>elf, and by a <U+017F>peedy <U+017F>eparation endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours wholly to break the Con<U+017F>ort, and have its part by it <U+017F>elf.</p>

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That in this matter Experience is rather to be con<U+017F>ulted than Rea<U+017F>on, which falls <U+017F>hort in the examen of

            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That Mineral Waters, though humid to the touch, are de<U+017F>iccative; as appears partly from their compo<U+017F>ition of Mineral, deter<U+017F>ive, and de<U+017F>iccative Spirits; and partly from their effects, which are to heal Ulcers, dry up Scabs and Pu<U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and correct the moi<U+017F>t <hi>intemperies</hi> of the Stomach, and other lower Parts. Some argue them all hot, from their acrimony, virtues of penetrating, inciding, opening, attenuating, provoking Urine and Sweat, clean<U+017F>ing the Reins and Bladder; all ffects of heat. Others account them cold, becau<U+017F>e being drunk they cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering at Mid<U+017F>ummer, correct the heat of the Liver and Reins, cure hot Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, prejudice cold, and generally hurt the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Parts, to which, according to the Aphori<U+017F>m, Heat is friendly, and Cold hurtful: But though actually cold, yet they have <U+017F>ome have <U+017F>ome heat in power; and being compos'd of <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral unlike parts, produce different and <U+017F>ometimes contrary effects: So Aloes and Rhubarb both loo<U+017F>en and bind: All which effects may neverthele<U+017F>s be referr'd to three principal; namely, Refrigerating, Deoppilating or opening, and Strengthning. They refrigerate by their actual coldne<U+017F>s and the acidity of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66371:37"/>
which al<U+017F>o by vellicating the <U+017F>tomach, cau<U+017F>es the great appetite we have during the the u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Waters. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppilate, not <U+017F>o much by their quantity (which hath made <U+017F>ome erroneou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>ay, that the <U+017F>ame proportion of common Water would work the <U+017F>ame effect as the<U+017F>e Medicinal Waters) as by their tenuity, which they have from the metalline Spirits, which make them penetrate and pa<U+017F>s <U+017F>peedily over the whole Body. La<U+017F>tly, they <U+017F>trengthen by their a<U+017F>tringency, (for all A<U+017F>tringents corroborate) which the Chymi<U+017F>ts attribute to their volatil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which, as they <U+017F>ay, joyn them<U+017F>elves to the fix'd Spirits of our Bodies.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the three conditions of a good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament are, To Cure <hi>Speedily, Safely,</hi> and <hi>Plea<U+017F>antly</hi>; as Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters do. They are familiar to us, by their nature of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Medicaments, by their compo<U+017F>ition, which is di<U+017F>cover'd either by letting them <U+017F>ettle, or by evaporating, or by di<U+017F>tilling them; as al<U+017F>o by the <U+017F>mell, ta<U+017F>te, and colour, which becoming black by the infu<U+017F>ion of Galls; <U+017F>hews that there is Vitriol in them. And whereas the longe<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t difficult Maladies proceed from ob<U+017F>truction and cold, the hot or acute being <U+017F>peedily ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, the<U+017F>e Waters are the mo<U+017F>t effectual Remedy of both; for they penetrate, and, like a torrent, open not the great pa<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges only, but al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>mall veins of the Me<U+017F>entery; and heat by their Spirits and Sulphur, which hath a heat very benign and friendly to the principal parts, e<U+017F>pecially to the Lungs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it is a Bal<U+017F>om and Specifical. Above all, they are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in curing Gravel, not only vacuating the gro<U+017F>s and vi<U+017F>cous humours, which are the matter of the Stone, but <U+017F>ometimes breaking and di<U+017F><U+017F>olving the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder; which, among<U+017F>t others, tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Spà</hi> perform, by rea<U+017F>on of their abounding in Vitriol, who<U+017F>e acidity and acrimony produces the <U+017F>ame effect upon Stones in the Body, as that of Vinegar doth upon Egg-<U+017F>hells, Pearls, and Corals.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the u<U+017F>e of Natural Baths, whether hot or cold, may be ea<U+017F>ily practi<U+017F>ed in <U+017F>undry Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; but 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to di<U+017F>cern the occa<U+017F>ions of taking them by the mouth, and their differences. For, be<U+017F>ides that their great quantity (the <hi>Italians</hi> pre<U+017F>cribing above 200 ounces a day, others 25 pound) <U+017F>ometimes overcomes the <U+017F>trength, and extingui<U+017F>hes the natural heat; <U+017F>ome have malignant Qualities, and Enemies to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Life, not <U+017F>o much by rea<U+017F>on of their Metalline Spirits, di<U+017F>proportionate to our Bodies, as of the mixture of Mercury, Pla<U+017F>ter, and other Earths entring into their Compo<U+017F>ition; whence many die by taking the Waters, or come back from them more infirm, by accidents following upon them, as Gowts, weakne<U+017F>s of Stomach, Imbecillity, La<U+017F><U+017F>itude, Livid Complexion, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie, and other more dangerous Evils than that for which they were recurr'd to.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>ixth <U+017F>aid, To the end the u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e waters may prove

healthful, regard is to be had to the Per<U+017F>ons, the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and the Nature of the waters.

otherwi<U+017F>e a Man might be <U+017F>aid more or le<U+017F>s excellent or happy than him<U+017F>elf; there being no Per<U+017F>on but hath need to Receive and power to Give at the <U+017F>ame time, out of the Plenty or Nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity which he hath of <U+017F>omething; For <U+017F>hould he be <U+017F>tor'd with whatever he could wi<U+017F>h, Might not we ask him, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>What ha<U+017F>t thou that thou ha<U+017F>t not receiv'd?</hi> So then, 'tis Reception that hath put him into this happy <U+017F>tate; and if there be any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence in Giving, it proceeds only from having Receiv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Moreover, the three points which make a thing e<U+017F>teem'd in the World, Profit, Plea<U+017F>ure, and Honour, are all on the Receiver's <U+017F>ide: For he mu<U+017F>t have renounc'd all the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>ts of Self-love that can believe there is more Profit and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure in Giving than in Receiving. And as for Honour, although it <U+017F>eem more openly to favour the party of tho<U+017F>e that Give, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s <U+017F>ince Giving and Receiving are Correlatives, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of either mu<U+017F>t be alike; and there cannot be Honour and Virtue in the one, but there mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o in the other; nor, on the contrary, Blame and Ignominy in the Receiver, but it reflects back upon the Giver. And as he who loves, is le<U+017F>s excellent than he who is lov'd, becau<U+017F>e he hath <U+017F>ome perfection in him<U+017F>elf which renders him lovely, which is ordinarily wanting in him who loves; <U+017F>o, between the Giver and the Receiver, the latter being as 'twere the Per<U+017F>on lov'd, may be <U+017F>aid more noble than he who Gives, who is the Lover; for there is no le<U+017F>s Liberality in the one Per<U+017F>on to be willingly oblig'd, then in the other to oblige him; and be<U+017F>ides, Virtue being a habit of the Will, he who Receives with Gratitude, and de<U+017F>ires to Repay with U<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may be <U+017F>aid as virtuous and as liberal in the act of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, as if he gave effectively. But this Virtue, commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Giver, is oftentimes rather O<U+017F>tentation and Vanity, than true Virtue. For either the Man gives <U+017F>uch things as him<U+017F>elf needs, and then 'tis rather Folly than Virtue; or <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>uperfluous, in which ca<U+017F>e 'tis no Virtue for a Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him<U+017F>elf of a u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s thing. Yea, <U+017F>ometimes tis more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious and di<U+017F>hone<U+017F>t to Give than to Receive; for every thing re<U+017F>train'd by the Laws is not only unju<U+017F>t, but vicious and di<U+017F>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t: Now the mo<U+017F>t part of Donations is re<U+017F>train'd, not only by that rule of Givers, who <U+017F>ay, That the Title <hi>De Donationibus</hi> is the Title of Fools, becau<U+017F>e to Give is to Lo<U+017F>e; but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had an expre<U+017F>s Officer call'd <hi>Comes Sacrarum Largitionum,</hi> who was to retrench the <U+017F>uperfluity of their Gifts, and put in execution that <hi>Formula</hi> of our Chambers of Accompts, <hi>Trop donné <U+017F>oit repeté; Too large a Grant is to be recall'd.</hi> Yea, the Donations of private Per<U+017F>ons were retrench'd by the <U+017F>ame Laws; even tho<U+017F>e between Husband and Wife; Legacies, by the Law <hi>Falcidia</hi>; Feoffments, by the <hi>Trebellian</hi>; Liberties, by the <hi>Caninian</hi> Law. But there can be no <U+017F>hame in receiving; <U+017F>ince not only Kings, but God him<U+017F>elf Receives from Men; and the Grandeur of the Me<U+017F><U+017F>iah is not de<U+017F>crib'd by the Prophet, <U+017F>aving

by the Pre<U+017F>ents he was to receive of the Kings of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Saba</hi>; Gifts being a te<U+017F>timony of their excellence to whom they are conferr'd: Whence the Lawyers hold, That a Te<U+017F>tamentary Legacy is a mark of Honour to the Legatee; as al<U+017F>o they call the Fee which Advocates receive, <hi>Honorarium</hi>: And the Wi<U+017F>e-man commands us to Reward the Phy<U+017F>itian by the word of Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. In fine, The praeeminence of Receiving above Giving <U+017F>ufficiently appears, in that our Lord invites us to Give, only by the promi<U+017F>e and hope of Receiving an hundred fold.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Although to Give and to Receive be <U+017F>o dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, that <hi>Seneca</hi> ju<U+017F>tly complains, That we know not how to do either; yet the former is far more excellent, according to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s te<U+017F>timony, who in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> exhorts the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tians to remember the Word of our Lord, <hi>That it is more ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed to Give than to Receive.</hi> For <U+017F>ince, according to the Maxim, A man cannot give what he hath not, nor receive what he hath already; Giving is a <U+017F>ign of Plenty and Perfection, as Receiving is of Want and Imperfection: Whence 'tis nobler to be lov'd than to love, becau<U+017F>e Love is the de<U+017F>ire of a Good which we want, and is found in the Per<U+017F>on lov'd. Moreover, <U+017F>ince an Action is the more excellent, by how much 'tis more virtuous and hone<U+017F>t; Giving, which is more virtuous becau<U+017F>e more difficult than recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as being contrary to our natural inclination of Getting) is al<U+017F>o more excellent. Wherefore Philophers reckon not among<U+017F>t Virtues the habit of Receiving, as being wholly mercenary; but account Liberality and Magnificence a Royal and Divine Virtue: For, if to Receive were an act of virtue, as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> holds, who places Liberality as well in Receiving as in Giving, it had not been a Virtue in <hi>Curius</hi> to refu<U+017F>e the Trea<U+017F>ures of the <hi>Samnites.</hi> But the action of Giving hath been honour'd, not only with the Name, but the Tokens and Ornaments of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Prai<U+017F>e, and Honour; as Ignominy oftentimes adheres to tho<U+017F>e that Receive. Now an Action is the more virtuous, the more 'tis honour'd and commended; and <U+017F>ince many who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive are a<U+017F>ham'd of it, and unwilling to have witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of this action, whereas all that Give derive glory for <U+017F>o doing; there can be no virtue in Receiving, becau<U+017F>e we are not a<U+017F>ham'd of Virtue, but only of Vice.</p>

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Poi<U+017F>ons and Antidotes, Medicaments and Aliments, are not call'd <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olutely, but as compar'd to the Natural Heat: For when <U+017F>ubdu'd and turn'd into the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals Sub<U+017F>tance, they are call'd Aliments; when Nature is alter'd by them, Medicaments; when de<U+017F>troy'd, Poi<U+017F>ons; when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd from their malignity, Antidotes.

The<U+017F>e Poi<U+017F>ons and Antidotes are either Natural or Artificial; tho<U+017F>e more frequent in Southern then in Northern Countries, are communicated by Potions, Powders, Juices, Vapours, Touches, and other dete<U+017F>table means. The Natural differ either in Matter, or in Quantity, or in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or in Operation. The Matter of Poy<U+017F>ons, which is found almo<U+017F>t every where, is either within us, as the Seed and the Blood, which by corruption oftentimes acquire a venomous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; <U+017F>uch as al<U+017F>o is that of the matter of the Epilep<U+017F>ie and Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Womb: Or el<U+017F>e without us, in the Air, Water, and Earth; Fire alone being contrary to Poy<U+017F>on and putrefaction, which ea<U+017F>ily happens to the Air and Water through their great humidity: But the Earth by its excrements and impurities <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies mo<U+017F>t Matter to Poy<U+017F>ons, which are drawn either from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, from Plants, or from Animals. Ar<U+017F>enic, Orpiment, Vitriol, Pla<U+017F>tre, Lime, Sublimate, Borax, Verdegrea<U+017F>e, Quick<U+017F>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Cinabar, Ceru<U+017F>e, and Red-lead, are of the fir<U+017F>t order. To the <U+017F>econd belong Aconite or Woolf-bane, Chamalea or Widow-wayle, Yew, Spurge-lawrel, Thap<U+017F>ia or <U+017F>corching Fennel, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymals, Hellebores, Vomiting Nut, Opium, Night<U+017F>hade, and many other Plants; <U+017F>ome of which have only venomous Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as certain white Violets; others only their Fruits, as the Apples of Mandrake; or only the juice, as Lettice and Poppies; or the Seeds, as Henbane and Spurge; or the Roots, as Aconite and Hellebore. To the third belong <hi>Lepus Marinus,</hi> the Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, the Flie call'd <hi>Bupre<U+017F>tis,</hi> the Scorpion, Viper, A<U+017F>p, Adder, Toad, Tarantula, Shrew-mou<U+017F>e, and divers others; which are venomous either in all their parts, as Cantharides and Spiders; or only in <U+017F>ome, as Vipers in the Tail and Head, the Hart and Fork-fi<U+017F>h in the extremities of their Tails, the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in one of its Claws: Or in their Excrements; as the Gall of the Leopard, the Urine of a Mou<U+017F>e, the Foam of a Mad-dog, the Sweat of an enraged Hor<U+017F>e, and the Blood of a Bull. As for the Quantity; although all Poy<U+017F>ons act in a little volume, yet <U+017F>ome require le<U+017F>s Matter; as Opium acts in le<U+017F>s quantity than Hemlock; this, than the juice of Leeks; and this, than the juice of Lettice. According to Quality; <U+017F>ome are hot, and either inflame, as <hi>Euphorbium</hi>; or corrode, as the <hi>Lepus Marinus,</hi> which particularly invades the Lungs; the A<U+017F>p, the Liver; Night<U+017F>hade and Henbane, the Brain; Cantharides, the Bladder. Others are cold, fixing the Spirits and natural heat, or hindring their free motion; as Opium, and the Salt of Lead. Others are dry; as Lime, Vitriol, and Ar<U+017F>enic, which con<U+017F>ume the Radical Humidity: For Humidity being a quality purely pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive, and of it <U+017F>elf incapable of cau<U+017F>ing pain, there are no Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons <U+017F>imply humid. They differ al<U+017F>o in their manner of acting;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66371:40"/>
the cold kill by con<U+017F>opiting or <U+017F>tifling the Heat; Hellebore by vehement attraction of the Humours: Some corrode the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance; others alter, re<U+017F>olve, or putrifie it. And becau<U+017F>e all Poi<U+017F>ons chiefly attaque the natural Heat, and the Heart; as the Swoonings, Palpitations, and Weakne<U+017F><U+017F>es accompanying them witne<U+017F>s: The Antidotes mu<U+017F>t be Cardiacal or friends to the Heart, <U+017F>trengthening it, and joyning forces with it to expel or <U+017F>ubdue the malignity of the Poy<U+017F>on.</p>

Pre<U+017F>ervation depends on the admini<U+017F>tration of the <U+017F>ix Not-natural things; as the avoiding of Air and Places infected, perfuming them by burning of Wild-Thyme, Mountain-Majoran, Southernwood, Kings Spear, or Cedar; annointing the Body with Ro<U+017F>e-oyl, which is an Enemy to Serpents and venomous Creatures; and eating in Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of Porcellane, and the like, which di<U+017F>cover Poi<U+017F>ons. Simple Pre<U+017F>ervatives are either appli'd outwardly, as the Topaz, Emerald, and other Amulets, worn next the skin; or inwardly, as Bezoar-<U+017F>tone, Bole-Armenick, Lemnian or Seal'd Earth, Vincetoxicum, Turnep, Dittany, Garlick, Rue, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, Pomegranate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of Compounds the mo<U+017F>t famous is <hi>Theriaca,</hi> or Treacle, made of above a hundred Ingredients. When Poy<U+017F>on is already introduc'd into the Body, whether by biting, <U+017F>tinging, breathing, foam; or by the <U+017F>ight, as that of the Ba<U+017F>ilisk; or by the touch, as that of the Torpedo; or by the mouth; regard mu<U+017F>t be had to three things. 1. To <U+017F>trengthen the Natural Heat, that it yield not, but may re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Poy<U+017F>on; and to corroborate the Entrails, for fear they receive any malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. 2.

            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, There are two <U+017F>orts of Mi<U+017F>tions in Nature; one, of Qualities; the other, of Sub<U+017F>tantial Forms. In the fir<U+017F>t, the Qualities being rebated by their mutual encounter, an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able harmony or temper re<U+017F>ults, in which the prevailing Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity bears <U+017F>way, and makes a Temperament hot, cold, dry, or moi<U+017F>t. In the <U+017F>econd, the<U+017F>e Qualities being alter'd, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Forms, which were contrary only by their adver<U+017F>ary Qualities, unite and con<U+017F>pire into one particular Form, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Occult Properties, Sympathies, and Antipathies, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their Forms are found Friends or Enemies. Thus in all Medicaments there is a temperament of Qualities, which is the cau<U+017F>e that Pepper is hot, Lettuce cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a temperament of Forms, which makes Agaric purge Phlegm; Sena, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; Rhubarb, Choler: <U+017F>ome Drugs, Cardiacal; others Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalical, or Splenical. From the mixture of the<U+017F>e Forms ari<U+017F>es the action of Antidotes and Poy<U+017F>on; and not from that of the Elementary Qualities, although they accompany their Forms, being their Servants and Vicegerents: Otherwi<U+017F>e, did Poy<U+017F>ons kill by exce<U+017F>s of heat or cold, Pepper and Cucumber would be Poy<U+017F>on, as well as Opium and Ar<U+017F>enick; and a Gla<U+017F>s of Cold Water would be the counter-poy<U+017F>on of Sublimate: And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s there are many <hi>Alexipharmaca</hi> which agree in fir<U+017F>t qualities with the Poy<U+017F>ons they encounter.</p>

For his Branches and upper Parts being deck'd with Flowers, Leaves, and Fruits, which are the three <U+017F>orts of Goods which attend him; his Flowers (who<U+017F>e whitene<U+017F>s denotes the Innocence of his fir<U+017F>t Age) are the Goods of the Body, which pa<U+017F>s away with his Spring: His Leaves (who<U+017F>e Verdure is the Symbol of Hope, which never leaves him till death, being fading, and <U+017F>ubject to be di<U+017F>pers'd by <U+017F>torms) are the Goods of Fortune: And his Fruits are the Goods of the Mind, Knowledg and Virtue, which are more <U+017F>avory and nutritive than the re<U+017F>t.

The Evils of others not on'y do us ill by Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which is a <U+017F>ort of Grief; but al<U+017F>o their happine<U+017F>s cau<U+017F>es in us Jealou<U+017F>ie and Envy, the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t of all Evils. Be<U+017F>ides, Good is rare, and con<U+017F>equently not communicative; and Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion fills, but <U+017F>atisfies not. Nor is Metaphy<U+017F>ical Good communicable, being an ab<U+017F>tracted not a real Quality: And if Evil ari<U+017F>e from the lea<U+017F>t defect of a thing, and Good only from its ab<U+017F>olute perfection; then <U+017F>ince nothing is ab<U+017F>olutely perfect, Good is not communicated to any one thing here below; but, on the contrary, Evil is found in all.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That which hath no Being cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated: But Evil is not any thing real, and hath not any Efficient Cau<U+017F>e, as was held by the Manichees and Pri<U+017F>cilliani<U+017F>ts, condemn'd for e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing two Principles, one of Good, the other of Evil, independent one on the other. For <U+017F>ince Good con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the integrity and perfection of Parts, and of whatever is requi<U+017F>ite to the Nature of a Thing, Evil is nothing but a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, a defect and want of what is requi<U+017F>ite to its perfection. And, being a thing is communicated according as it hath more or le<U+017F>s of e<U+017F><U+017F>ence, Good, which is convertible with Being, mu<U+017F>t be more communicative than Evil, which is only a Being imperfect.

God, who po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es Beeing and Goodne<U+017F>s primarily, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates him<U+017F>elf infinitely; as doth al<U+017F>o Light, the mo<U+017F>t perfect of all created Sub<U+017F>tances. Moreover, the Nature of Good con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ting in Suitablene<U+017F>s and Appetibility, by rea<U+017F>on of Contraries; that of Evil con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in Unfitne<U+017F>s and Aver<U+017F>ion; and if Evil be communicated, 'tis always under the ma<U+017F>k and appearance of <U+017F>ome Good, which alone is communicative by nature.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Good is more difficult than Evil, which is commonly attended with Profit and Delight, and con<U+017F>equently more communicative.

For explication whereof it mu<U+017F>t be known, that the Cuticle, the chief <U+017F>eat of the Touch, and con<U+017F>equently of Pain, is the expan<U+017F>ion of the Nerves, the conduits of the Animal Spirits, which in Pain either <U+017F>hrink inwards, and <U+017F>o cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>tupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; or being irritated and <U+017F>ent by Nature to the aid of the hurt part, by Sympathy move the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and other ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and membranous Parts: For, as of two Lute-<U+017F>trings <U+017F>et at the <U+017F>ame pitch, the one <U+017F>ounds upon the touching of the other; <U+017F>o in the Harmony of the whole Body, there may be the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ympathy between the Spirits and the Parts; an evidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is <U+017F>een in Tickling and Laughter, which is caus'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the <hi>Diaphragm</hi>; which is the rea<U+017F>on that the a<U+017F>pect of <U+017F>uch as Laugh and Weep is much alike. And becau<U+017F>e in Grief the coarcted Spirits hinder re<U+017F>piration, and free motion of the Heart; ttherefore Nature, to ea<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf, drives them outwards with violence, and with them moi<U+017F>t vapours which partly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pire by the pores, and are partly condens'd in the Brain, whence they flow through the eyes in <U+017F>treams of Tears, which by this means greatly alleviate Grief, as the want of Them and Cries argues its vehemence: Be<U+017F>ides that, they may <U+017F>erve Animals to terrifie their Enemies, or el<U+017F>e to implore the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of their Fellows; as we read of Elephants, that falling into a Ditch they call other Elephants to their aid.</p>

Since then En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is the greate<U+017F>t of all Evils, as Unity is the mo<U+017F>t excellent of all Goods, and the noble<U+017F>t of all Virtues, as having no Vicious Extremity, but being perfect by being boundle<U+017F>s; 'tis a Point of great Wi<U+017F>edom to be able to draw <U+017F>ome benefit from ones Enemies; whereof the principal is, that they oblige us to <U+017F>tand upon our guard, to order our demeanour well, and <U+017F>o to frame our Lives, that they may have no hold again<U+017F>t us: For, as Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip is the Parent of Confidence and Liberty; this, of Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: So Enmity begets Diffidence, and this Circum<U+017F>pection, with a great de<U+017F>ire of Virtue, and <U+017F>hame of Vice, who<U+017F>e turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude makes us blu<U+017F>h more in the pre<U+017F>ence of an Enemy than of a Friend, who being our other Self, complies with our humours and inclinations.

            </p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That if a Man be vicious, 'tis more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that he have Enemies than Friends; the<U+017F>e too ea<U+017F>ily adhering to his debauches; but tho<U+017F>e withdrawing him from them, either by reproaches, or by the example of a contrary life. If he be virtuous, his Enemies make his Virtue <U+017F>hine forth, whil<U+017F>t it <U+017F>erves him for a defence and apology again<U+017F>t all their accu<U+017F>ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and calumnies; and he finds it his intere<U+017F>t to continue his virtuous Practi<U+017F>es, that he may <U+017F>till refute them; whereas the flatteries and compliances of his Friends in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly corrupt him. Be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>eeing a virtuous Man cannot be <U+017F>aid ab<U+017F>olutely perfect, but only to have fewer defects than another, his di<U+017F><U+017F>embling or flattering Friends <U+017F>ometimes know them not; but an Enemy takes notice of them, and blazing them abroad, gives him warning to correct them. Yea, it <U+017F>eems a <U+017F>ign of a virtuous Man to have Enemies: For, be<U+017F>ides that Virtue hath been always envy'd and hated, and the higher a Man is in merit and dignity above others, he hath the more Enemies; re<U+017F>emblance of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners begets Friend<U+017F>hip, and di<U+017F>parity Enmity; and more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compari<U+017F>on are vicious than virtuous: But the vicious being unable to love any but tho<U+017F>e like them<U+017F>elves, hate all who follow not their example, as the virtuous do not, and <U+017F>o have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t part of the World again<U+017F>t them.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That Enmities can produce no good, <U+017F>ince either Vice, or Malice, or Ignorance is the cau<U+017F>e; it not being po<U+017F><U+017F>ible but either he that is hated mu<U+017F>t be vicious, or el<U+017F>e they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66371:44"/>
that hate him malicious or ignorant. For, as Friend<U+017F>hip is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and cannot <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t without Virtue; <U+017F>o neither can En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, without the Vice and Malice of him that hates, or his that is hated, or both together. And as the Effects of Amity are Union, Concord, Security, and Peace; <U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e of Enmity are Divi<U+017F>ion, Di<U+017F>cord, Diffidence, Su<U+017F>picion, Treachery, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and other <U+017F>uch Effects, noxious not only to a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, who cannot draw any benefit from what tends only to his ruine (as all Hatred doth); but al<U+017F>o prejudicial to the Publick, which is totally de<U+017F>troy'd by Enmity, which breaks the bonds of Civil Society. On the other <U+017F>ide, If all were Friends, one man would be a God to another (as that Ancient <U+017F>aid); and all men concurring together by mutual help, to the accompli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one anothers de<U+017F>igns, there would be no more difficulty in Affairs, becau<U+017F>e no oppo<U+017F>ition; and the World would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a harmony of favourable Succe<U+017F><U+017F>es. Contrarily, 'tis Enmity makes one man a Woolf to another, a Stone of offence, and the Daemon of his bad fortune: For, the benefit of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding our own Vices by our Enemies reproaches, is not to be compar'd to that which we receive from the good coun<U+017F>els of Friends, who are better qualifi'd for redre<U+017F><U+017F>ing our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becau<U+017F>e conver<U+017F>e affords the means to know them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the rude cen<U+017F>ures and affronts of an Enemy, being never taken in good part, cannot any wi<U+017F>e contribute to the correction of our Manners. A wi<U+017F>e and virtuous Man, who voluntarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to practi<U+017F>e Virtue in all occurrences, finds ways enough to do it, without waiting to be con<U+017F>train'd thereunto by the injuries and cen<U+017F>ures of Enemies: But the vitious will draw nothing from them but fewel to his rancour and revenge, without being in<U+017F>tructed concerning his faults by the mouth of tho<U+017F>e whom he utterly disbelieves. However, we mu<U+017F>t draw as much profit as we can from our Enemies; and 'tis the only comfort can be had again<U+017F>t Hatred, to make u<U+017F>e of it as an Antidote again<U+017F>t its own Poy<U+017F>on. But then, as 'twould be more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have no Griefs or Poy<U+017F>ons, than to be at the trouble of finding Anodynes and Counter-poy<U+017F>ons; <U+017F>o we may be allow'd to derive <U+017F>ome remedy from Enmities again<U+017F>t their Mi<U+017F>chiefs, and make as much profit of Vice as 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; but 'twould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to have neither Enemies nor Vices.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That Nature <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts only by Contrariety. That, of the Fir<U+017F>t Qualities is the cau<U+017F>e of all the Generations of Mixts in the great World. Man's Life la<U+017F>ts only <U+017F>o long as the Natural Heat acts upon the Radical Moi<U+017F>ture; when their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is ended, he mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily die. His Under<U+017F>tanding hath no better means to obtain Truth, than by contrariety of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; whereof Identity is as di<U+017F>agreeable to the Mind as 'tis to Nature: But his Will hath no more powerful Means to attain to Virtue than Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, which <U+017F>harpens the Courage, and enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles Re<U+017F>oltion. Therefore God has given Man a dome<U+017F>tick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66371:44"/>
the Sen<U+017F>itive Appetite; that it being continually at war with the Will, might <U+017F>erve to exerci<U+017F>e it, and render its Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries more glorious; the Will, as well as the Under<U+017F>tanding, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ru<U+017F>ty when they want exerci<U+017F>ing, which whets and <U+017F>trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens them both. Hence S. <hi>Paul</hi> was not heard when he pray'd thrice to be delivered from the importunity of his Enemy; God judging it not expedient for his good; and having al<U+017F>o permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Here<U+017F>ies in the Church, which the <U+017F>ame Apo<U+017F>tle <U+017F>aith are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary, to the end to prove the Faith of its Members.</p>

               </note> of <hi>Admiration</hi>: thereby intimating our not knowing its cau<U+017F>e: For Wonder is the Off-<U+017F>pring of Ignorance. Among<U+017F>t many other things, Three we find to admire in it; its Matter, Form, and Colours. Its Matter is not a moi<U+017F>t Cloud, as mo<U+017F>t imagine; for (be<U+017F>ides that then we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee Rain-bows more frequently than we do) a Cloud cannot reflect the Sun-beams with that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety or medley which we ob<U+017F>erve therein: For there would be but one colour, if the Cloud were diaphanous; and otherwi<U+017F>e, it will be black and dark. 'Tis not therefore in a Cloud that the Rain-bow is form'd, but in the falling drops of Rain; as we <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome Fountains form one in the Air, by the ejaculation of the Water <U+017F>truck with the Sun-beams; as al<U+017F>o by the <U+017F>purt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Water out of the mouth, oppo<U+017F>ite to the Sun: For an <hi>Iris</hi> is not vi<U+017F>ible, unle<U+017F>s we be plac'd between the dropping Cloud and the Sun. If the Cloud be between our eye and the Sun, it will receive the Rays only on that <U+017F>ide which is next the Sun, and not on that <U+017F>ide which is towards us. Nor will any <hi>Iris</hi> appear, in ca<U+017F>e the Sun be between the Eye and the Cloud: For, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common opinion, it cannot be <U+017F>een higher than three miles; but in this oppo<U+017F>ition of the Sun, the <hi>Iris</hi> will be remote from us above 18 degrees, which make above 1100 miles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing 60 miles to a degree, according to <hi>Ptolomie.</hi> Hence the Rain-bow which appears before Noon, is always towards the We<U+017F>t; as that which appears about or after Noon, is always to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, or the Ea<U+017F>t; at which times we are between the Rain-bow, and the Sun. Hence <U+017F>uch as are in the fifth Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate can never <U+017F>ee one in the South. Now the <U+017F>urfaces of the<U+017F>e
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66371:45"/>
drops of Water (which fall confu<U+017F>edly and di<U+017F>orderly) being irregular, and <U+017F>truck obliquely by the Sun-beams, they make a refraction of his Light, like that which is made by Diamonds cut into Faucets, but more permanent; becau<U+017F>e the drops of Water fall <U+017F>o <U+017F>wiftly and <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ively that they <U+017F>eem continuous. A Rain-bow then is nothing el<U+017F>e but the Light of the Sun, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in this falling Rain, and remitted to our eye by an Angle of refraction, different from that of its incidence; for if it were equal, the Image of the Sun would appear therein too, as we <U+017F>ee it doth in <hi>Parhelia's.</hi> Indeed we may <U+017F>ay, That the Rain-bow is an imperfect and begun <hi>Parhelion</hi>; the Light of the one being reflected regularly, and that of the other in confu<U+017F>ion, and di<U+017F>orderly: And, That its Arch and circular Figure proceeds from the obliquity of the Sun-beams: Or el<U+017F>e, That he being a Spherical Body, ca<U+017F>ts his Rays circularly: Or, la<U+017F>tly, from the Spherical or Parabolical form of the Cloud: Which is al<U+017F>o true in the <hi>Iris</hi> which is form'd in the night by the Moon-beams, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in a Cloud di<U+017F><U+017F>olving into Rain; <U+017F>aving that her Rays, being not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong and luminous as tho<U+017F>e of the Sun, illuminate only the <U+017F>urface of the Water, and therein paint a faint whiti<U+017F>h colour, and not <U+017F>uch an enamel of colours as is <U+017F>een by day in the Solar <hi>Iris</hi>; which colours are nothing el<U+017F>e but an imperfect Light, which cannot be directly reflected to the eye, by rea<U+017F>on of the inequality of the Angles, and therefore at lea<U+017F>t forms the<U+017F>e Colours; of which the three principal are, Yellow, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinous, which is the highe<U+017F>t; Blue, or Green, which is the middlemo<U+017F>t; and Red, which is the lowe<U+017F>t: Among<U+017F>t which there are found divers others which partake of their extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the diver<U+017F>ity whereof proceeds from the divers reception of the Rays in the Parts of the Cloud, differing in opacity; which not being great in the outmo<U+017F>t part, the Sun-beams paint there a Yellowi<U+017F>h colour; but greater in the middle, a Blew or Watchet; and greate<U+017F>t in the inmo<U+017F>t or lowe<U+017F>t part, a Red: as Experience <U+017F>hews us in the like <U+017F>ubjects, wherein Light diver<U+017F>ly modifi'd, repre<U+017F>ents very neer the <U+017F>ame variety of Colours; which although not real (as tho<U+017F>e which ari<U+017F>e from the various mixture of the four Elementary Qualities) yet are not ab<U+017F>olutely imaginary (as tho<U+017F>e are which are <U+017F>een by weak eyes about the flame of a Candle), but are true Colours, ina<U+017F>much as they <U+017F>trike the Sight, which a <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive and corporeal Power, and are alike perceiv'd by all; neverthele<U+017F>s, they are le<U+017F>s material than Elementary Colours, and are neerer akin to Light, not differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <U+017F>ame, <U+017F>aving ina<U+017F>much as it is here received diver<U+017F>ly in the eye, according to the rarity or den<U+017F>ity, <U+017F>ituation, figure, and other qualities of the Object and <hi>Medium.</hi>

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, The Rain-bow (the faire<U+017F>t not only of all Meteors, but of all Nature's Works; being, according to the Cabbali<U+017F>ts, the Throne of God, who, in the <hi>Apocalyp<U+017F>e,</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented Crown'd therewith) doth not le<U+017F>s dazle the Mind than
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66371:45"/>
ravi<U+017F>h the Eye; it being ob<U+017F>erv'd, That the clearer things are to the Sen<U+017F>e the ob<U+017F>curer they are to the Under<U+017F>tanding; and <U+017F>o on the contrary: For it cannot proceed from the different rarity and den<U+017F>ity of the Cloud, which being never alike, but infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly various, <U+017F>hould rather repre<U+017F>ent a thou<U+017F>and different Figures and Colours; whereas the Rain-bow hath always a circular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and the <U+017F>ame Colours. And as there may be found more Clouds in <U+017F>everal places, equally rare or den<U+017F>e, and equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant from the Sun (who enlightens Bodies equally di<U+017F>tant after the <U+017F>ame manner) <U+017F>o there <U+017F>hould be more Rain-bows at the <U+017F>ame time in <U+017F>everal places; which is contrary to experience: For we never <U+017F>ee two uniform Rain-bows at once; the other Bow, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times included in the fir<U+017F>t, being not directly form'd by the Sun-beams, but by reflection of the Rays of the fir<U+017F>t Bow upon a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Cloud; whence the Colours of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>econdary-Bow are not <U+017F>o lively as tho<U+017F>e of the fir<U+017F>t, but are revers'd, the yellow being lowe<U+017F>t, the Green always middlemo<U+017F>t, and the Red uppermo<U+017F>t: For <U+017F>o by the rea<U+017F>on of Catoptricks, we <U+017F>ee that the <hi>Species</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected have a different <U+017F>ituation from the Body which produces them (things on the right hand appearing on the left, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily); and the <U+017F>hadows of Bodies which pa<U+017F>s along the <U+017F>treet entring by a <U+017F>mall hole into a dark Chamber, revers'd.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Experience teaches us, That when Light pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out of a thinner <hi>Medium</hi> into a thicker (as out of Air into Water) if it fall obliquely upon that thicker <hi>Medium,</hi> it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or refracted: But if it pa<U+017F>s quite through <U+017F>uch den<U+017F>er <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> <U+017F>o that 'tis broken as well at its going out as at its entrance (e<U+017F>pecially if the refraction in the<U+017F>e two places be great enough) then this Light is turn'd into Colours. This Natural Effect is a Principle of the Opticks, and is ob<U+017F>erv'd not only in the Rain-bow, but al<U+017F>o in triangular Cry<U+017F>tals, and Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es fill'd with clear Water, and expos'd to the Sun; provided the Gla<U+017F>s be of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Figure revers'd; that is, narrower at the bottome, and wider towards the top. This being premis'd, the Production of the Rain-bow <U+017F>eems to be thus: When a Cloud, already wholly turn'd into Water, and actually falling down in drops of Rain (which reach from the top of the Cloud to the Earth) is <U+017F>hin'd upon by the oppo<U+017F>ite Sun, and the Spectator is plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sun and the Rain, then the Sun-beams pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through tho<U+017F>e drops, are reflected, as by a Mirror, back again, by tho<U+017F>e which are more remote; and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by the <U+017F>ides of tho<U+017F>e which are neare<U+017F>t (becau<U+017F>e from one and the <U+017F>ame part but one perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular Ray can fall upon a round Figure, as that of drops of Water is, all the other Rays being oblique) they mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity be twice broken: Fir<U+017F>t, as they are reflected by the remoter drops, and pa<U+017F>s out of the Air comprehended between tho<U+017F>e remoter, into the other drops nearer us: And <U+017F>econdly, as they i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of the<U+017F>e nearer drops, into the Air which is between them and us. And thus from this different fraction caus'd by the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66371:46"/>
various rarity and den<U+017F>ity of the Air and Water, the diver<U+017F>ity of Colours in the Rain-bow ari<U+017F>eth. For, Water being not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diaphanous, but <U+017F>omewhat of a middle nature, between perfectly Tran<U+017F>parent and Opake, reflects part of the Rays which fall upon its <U+017F>urface, and lets the other part pa<U+017F>s through; as 'tis ob<U+017F>erv'd in Rivers and Ponds, upon which we <U+017F>ee the Suns Image by reflection, but Divers and Fi<U+017F>h behold it by refraction. So 'tis with drops of Water; tho<U+017F>e neere<U+017F>t us reflect part of the Sun-beams towards the Sun him<U+017F>elf, without forming an <hi>Iris,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e reflected Rays meet not other drops to refract them; but when part of tho<U+017F>e Rays, which pa<U+017F>s'd through the <U+017F>mall intervals of the fir<U+017F>t drops, are reflected by the other remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from us, then the<U+017F>e reflected Rays lighting by the way upon the fir<U+017F>t drops between which they had pa<U+017F>s'd, they are broken thereby both at their going in and coming out, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ent the <hi>Iris,</hi> which con<U+017F>equently is form'd by Reflection and Refraction; reflection, by all the drops which receive Light, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the <U+017F>ame towards the Sun; and refraction of the <U+017F>ame Light <U+017F>o reflected, when by the way as it returns it meets tho<U+017F>e other drops of Water, which refract it twice, and give it the diver<U+017F>ity of Colours, which ari<U+017F>eth from the divers reception of the Light into tho<U+017F>e parts of Water, more or le<U+017F>s den<U+017F>e and rare. But now to give account of the circular Figure of this Meteor, which is not only in appearance circular (as <U+017F>quare Towers <U+017F>eem round at a di<U+017F>tance) but is <U+017F>o really; 'tis requi<U+017F>ite to take a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain po<U+017F>ition of the Sun; and by one example 'twill be ea<U+017F>ie to judg of others. Let us <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e then that the Sun is at the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and con<U+017F>equently that all the Rays he <U+017F>ends directly upon the drops of Rain, as well the highe<U+017F>t as the lowe<U+017F>t, are parallel between them<U+017F>elves, and to the Horizon, (for the elevation of a Cloud, how great <U+017F>oever, being incon<U+017F>iderable in re<U+017F>pect of the Sun's di<U+017F>tance from the Earth, hinders not but that all his Rays are always parallel between them<U+017F>elves) which being reflected, as hath been <U+017F>aid, the reflection of them will be al<U+017F>o parallel to the Horizon, or very neer <U+017F>o; for here we con<U+017F>ider only that which is made by the middle of the drop, which is the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t by rea<U+017F>on of its round figure; and this reflection being receiv'd by the <U+017F>uperior part of <U+017F>ome other drop which it finds in its way, and there twice broken, to wit, at its going in and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth; the two Refractions joyn'd together di<U+017F>tort the Ray about 45 degrees; that is to <U+017F>ay, the Ray thus twice broken will make with the lines parallel to the Horizon an Angle of 45. degrees, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> from on high downwards, and falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth. And becau<U+017F>e all the drops make <U+017F>uch a Refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we have mention'd, therefore all <U+017F>uch Per<U+017F>ons as <U+017F>hall be between the Sun and the drops of Rain, <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee the <hi>Iris</hi> of the <U+017F>ame heighth, namely, of 45 degrees (although from <U+017F>everal <U+017F>tations); <U+017F>ome in the lower drops, namely, <U+017F>uch Per<U+017F>ons as are neere<U+017F>t the Cloud; others, to wit, <U+017F>uch as are more remote,

Now the drops make refraction not only by their <U+017F>uperior parts, but al<U+017F>o by their <U+017F>ides and lower parts; whence tho<U+017F>e on either <U+017F>ide of the Spectator, di<U+017F>tant by an Angle of 45 degrees, will make him <U+017F>ee their refraction, and con<U+017F>equently the <hi>Iris</hi> on either <U+017F>ide under equal Angles; which being made on all <U+017F>ides about a right line drawn from the Sun to the Spectators eye, which may be call'd the <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>Iris,</hi> it nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follows, That the <hi>Iris</hi> mu<U+017F>t appear perfectly round about this <hi>Axis</hi>: So that the drops elevated above this <hi>Axis</hi> 45 degrees, will make the upper part of the <hi>Iris</hi> by the refraction of their <U+017F>uperior parts. Tho<U+017F>e on either <U+017F>ide, di<U+017F>tant likewi<U+017F>e 45 degrees, will make the <U+017F>ides of the <hi>Iris</hi> by refraction of their parts which are at the remoter <U+017F>ides; and <U+017F>o of all the drops which <U+017F>hall be about the <hi>Axis,</hi> under equal Angles of 45 degrees. As for other drops neerer or further from the <hi>Axis</hi> and the Spectator, they will repre<U+017F>ent an <hi>Iris</hi> to others who are not in the <U+017F>ame <hi>Axis,</hi> but neerer or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter from the Cloud, and <U+017F>ituate in <U+017F>uch place that tho<U+017F>e drops appear di<U+017F>tant from the <hi>Axis</hi> by Angles of 45 degrees. So that as many Spectators as there are between the Sun and the Cloud, and not in the <U+017F>ame <hi>Axis</hi>; <U+017F>o many <hi>Axes</hi> mu<U+017F>t be imagin'd, about which there are different Arches and Rainbows. Now in this Horizontal Po<U+017F>ition the Bow appears a perfect Semi-circle, who<U+017F>e Center is in the Horizon, at the Point where the <hi>Axis</hi> termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates. But when the Sun is in another Po<U+017F>ition, as elevated <U+017F>ome degrees yet fewer than 45, then the <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>Iris</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Sun through the Spectator's eye, penetrates the Earth; and <U+017F>o the Center (which is always at the end of the <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi>) is below the Horizon; and the portion of the <hi>Iris</hi> which we behold is le<U+017F>s than a Semi-circle, greater than which it never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> hath well ob<U+017F>erv'd. For <U+017F>ince the Bow is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways le<U+017F>s than a Semi-circle whil<U+017F>t the Sun is elevated above the Horizon, it mu<U+017F>t be a Semi-circle when he is in the Horizon, and none at all when he is below the Horizon, becau<U+017F>e he doth not then illuminate the Cloud: Hence 'tis <U+017F>eldome produc'd in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becau<U+017F>e when it rains in that Sea<U+017F>on the whole Heaven is cloudy, and covers the Sun-beams; as neither in the Summer and Spring at noon, when the Sun is higher than 45 degrees, but only at Morning and Evening.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That if <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi>'s definition of the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow be true, who defines it, An Arch con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of divers colours, which the reflection of the Sun-beams repre<U+017F>ents upon a hollow Cloud ready to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve into Rain, we need not <U+017F>eek much for Material, Formal, and Efficient Cau<U+017F>es (for he a<U+017F><U+017F>igns no Final of it; but the Scripture doth, namely, to be a moral <U+017F>ign of the Covenant between God and Men.) Of the fir<U+017F>t there is no doubt, unle<U+017F>s among<U+017F>t blind men, to whom only God can make a demon<U+017F>tration of it; but the re<U+017F>t are very ob<U+017F>cure: To judg
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66371:47"/>
of which we mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve, That the Angle of Reflection is equal to that of Incidence; <U+017F>o that a right perpendicular Line, erected at the common point of Incidence and Reflection, will equally bi<U+017F>ect the Angle comprehended by the Ray of Incidence and that of Reflection; which is not true, unle<U+017F>s when the Ray of Incidence is terminated by a very <U+017F>mooth and opake Body, as that of a Mirror: Whence 'tis infer'd, That a Cloud not having <U+017F>uch evenne<U+017F>s or <U+017F>moothne<U+017F>s will not reflect the Light or Ray at an equal Angle, but will di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate and remit it el<U+017F>ewhere: So that if one part of a Cloud, which is directly oppo<U+017F>ite to the Sun and <U+017F>mooth, reflect the Ray directly; and another obliquely oppo<U+017F>ite to him, di<U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Be<U+017F>ides, if Reflection repre<U+017F>ent any thing, 'tis the <U+017F>ame thing that is oppo<U+017F>ite, not another: But 'tis not the Sun that we behold in the Cloud, but a mixture of Colours, no wi<U+017F>e like, nor <U+017F>o much as an imperfect repre<U+017F>entation of him, as <U+017F>ome have plea<U+017F>ed to affirm: For Reflection would <U+017F>hew us either the Sun, or an imperfect repre<U+017F>entation of him; not in the Cloud, but as far beyond it as the Object (the Sun) is from it. So that we <U+017F>hall explicate <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> better if we <U+017F>ay, That tho<U+017F>e Colours appear by irradiation; and, that the Light diver<U+017F>ly receiv'd, and not reflected, makes the variety of this goodly Spectacle: For they who <U+017F>ay 'tis Refraction, are mi<U+017F>taken; for Refraction only alters the place of the Object repre<U+017F>ented by the <hi>Species,</hi> which is broken by the occur<U+017F>e of a <hi>Medium</hi> of unequal opacity; but doth not produce divers colours, <U+017F>uch as tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Iris,</hi> which I conceive we may more <U+017F>afely admire, with many other of God's Works (indi<U+017F>putable te<U+017F>timonies of his Power and our Weakne<U+017F>s) than vainly <U+017F>eek their Cau<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, He conceiv'd no demon<U+017F>tration more manife<U+017F>t to prove the manner of the Rain-bows production than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of a Phial of Water, which, expos'd to the Sun upon <U+017F>ome <U+017F>olid Body, repre<U+017F>ents the <U+017F>ame Colours with tho<U+017F>e of the Rain-bow: So that the <U+017F>ame thing is done in the Sky when the Sun-beams pa<U+017F>s cro<U+017F>s an aqueous and diaphanous Cloud, and are reflected to the other <U+017F>ide by another Cloud, who<U+017F>e thickne<U+017F>s hath <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>emblance of <U+017F>olidity; and <U+017F>o 'tis not <U+017F>ufficient that <U+017F>uch aqueous Cloud be interpos'd between the Sun and the Eye, but there mu<U+017F>t be al<U+017F>o another oppo<U+017F>ite Cloud, den<U+017F>e enough to reflect tho<U+017F>e Rays of the Sun, who being hollow according to the figure of the Sky, imprints that lucid circular Figure, and gives it the name of a Bow.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That a Rain-bow may be foretold <U+017F>ome time before it happens, when the Wind comes from that Quarter where the Sun is, and a Cloud coming from the <U+017F>ame Quarter pa<U+017F>s over our heads, and <U+017F>hed Rain as it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es: For if the Sun

appears at the <U+017F>ame time, you will <U+017F>ee an <hi>Iris</hi> as <U+017F>oon as the Cloud becomes oppo<U+017F>ite to him; which <hi>Iris</hi> will be the more lively and colour'd, according as the falling Rain was greater, and the Sun happens to be clear; as al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o much more elevated as the Sun is depre<U+017F>s'd. But if the Sun be 45 degrees high, you will <U+017F>ee no <hi>Iris,</hi> the Refraction not being then proper to produce it. If it happens after Rain, it <U+017F>ignifies fair weather, and the Sky clears up, in that Quarter whence the Wind blows. But if the Wind blow from the Quarter oppo<U+017F>ite to the Sun, and drive a Cloud and Rain before it; and if the Sun al<U+017F>o appear at the <U+017F>ame time, then you will <U+017F>ee the <hi>Iris</hi> before the Rain, which we may foretel will fall upon the place whence the <hi>Iris</hi> is beheld, provided the Cloud can <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t any while, and be not too <U+017F>peedily re<U+017F>olv'd all into Rain at the place where it is <U+017F>een; for where ever an <hi>Iris</hi> is <U+017F>een, there it rains.</p>
            <p>Upon the Second Point it was <U+017F>aid, That the Eye and the Ear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> being the Sen<U+017F>es whereby the Mind receives the <hi>Species</hi> of things which it knows; the former is proper for Invention;<note place="margin">

               </note> and the latter, call'd the Sen<U+017F>e of Di<U+017F>cipline, chiefly for Learning. For the Voice, as the Proverb <U+017F>aith, is more powerful than dumb Ma<U+017F>ters; becau<U+017F>e being animated with the ge<U+017F>ture and motion of the Eyes, Mouth, Hands, and whole Body, it makes more impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon the Mind than the dead <U+017F>tyle of Books; which be<U+017F>ides, being In<U+017F>tructors whom we cannot interrogate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our doubts, as we may the living, they leave more <U+017F>cruples in the Readers mind than they re<U+017F>olve: For our cognition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the <hi>Species</hi> and Animal Spirits, the<U+017F>e follow the drift and motion of the Voice, who<U+017F>e accents con<U+017F>equently being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <U+017F>ad, amorous, warlike, or furious, according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the <U+017F>ubject, imprint like affections in the Soul; and this through the near communication there is between the Air and tho<U+017F>e Spirits of the Body, which are al<U+017F>o aerious, and of great mobility. And <U+017F>ince Writing is only the <U+017F>ign of Speech, as this is of the Minds conception, it le<U+017F>s perfectly expre<U+017F><U+017F>es its Author's thought than the Voice, the perfect Image of his Conception, which is call'd the Internal Speech, as the voice is the External; and being the Original from which Writing is drawn, repre<U+017F>ents our Conceptions better than the Copy; as all Exemplars dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat proportionably to their remotene<U+017F>s from their Prototype.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That written Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es are better dige<U+017F>ted, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain them<U+017F>elves better by their own weight, than words di<U+017F>guis'd by the maner of expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or cadence, ge<U+017F>tures, and other <U+017F>leights, which corrupt the <U+017F>implicity of things; whence the Comedian that comforted <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes,</hi> and reviv'd his lo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire of haranguing, made him confe<U+017F>s, That one and the <U+017F>ame ver<U+017F>e of <hi>Homer</hi> was another thing when well and when ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd: And bad Poets fear nothing <U+017F>o much as that others <U+017F>hould read their Works; the Name which them<U+017F>elves give them

cau<U+017F>ing others to judg them different from what they are; and the <U+017F>uddenne<U+017F>s of pronuntiation not allowing the mind <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time to reflect upon them. Moreover, Books flatter much le<U+017F>s, and have more univer<U+017F>al Precepts than Speech, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly affects complai<U+017F>ance, and the gaining of the hearers good will: Particularly in morality, Great Per<U+017F>ons are better in<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and more plainly reprehended for their faults by Books than by Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, which <U+017F>eldom tell them the truth freely, every one fearing the effects of hatred en<U+017F>uing it, which Books care not for. Be<U+017F>ides, No di<U+017F>cipline is harder than Politicks; which being the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of all others, may ju<U+017F>tly give Law to them. And were the way of learning the Sciences by Books longer than that by the Voice, yet 'tis the <U+017F>afer, yea, almo<U+017F>t that alone by which we reap benefit; all tho<U+017F>e that are Learned, having learn'd more by the Reading and Meditation of Books, than by having heard the Voice of their Ma<U+017F>ters in Schools, where often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the noi<U+017F>e is greater than the fruit. For, our Memories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treacherous, we never repeat things <U+017F>o well as we write them; and in ca<U+017F>e of mi<U+017F>takes or omi<U+017F><U+017F>ions, we are a<U+017F>ham'd to acknowledg our faults, but defend them with ob<U+017F>tinacy; whereas we <U+017F>cruple not to correct a Writing, to view and review it, and, according to <hi>Horace</hi>'s coun<U+017F>el, keep it nine years before publi<U+017F>hing. But Words are utter'd as <U+017F>oon as thought; and hence when we <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e fine Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es in Writing, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>h'd all the World in the Chair and at the Bar, we are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a<U+017F>ham'd of having admir'd them: Which perhaps as much or more kept <hi>Cicero</hi> from letting his Orations be read in his youth, as his pretended excu<U+017F>e of re<U+017F>erving to him<U+017F>elf the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of contradicting him<U+017F>elf. Wherefore there being more to be learn'd in a well-dige<U+017F>ted and exact Piece, Writing (which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily <U+017F>uch) mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be more proper for In<U+017F>truction: Which is <U+017F>o true in the Mathematicks, to which alone the name of Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline belongs, that none ever pre<U+017F>um'd either to teach or learn them by Speech alone.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That a good Compari<U+017F>on mu<U+017F>t be of things alike; and <U+017F>o if we compare Speech and Writing, it mu<U+017F>t be in re<U+017F>pect of two things equally perfect in their kind; as an exact Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and an exact Writing. You mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o bring two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of the <U+017F>ame pitch, and they mu<U+017F>t have equal time to learn the <U+017F>ame thing; in which ca<U+017F>e, the circum<U+017F>tances being the <U+017F>ame, there's no doubt but Speech is more advantageous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto than Writing, which is not ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, as the Voice is, without which the latter is un<U+017F>erviceable; he who reads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to under<U+017F>tand any thing, unle<U+017F>s he hath already heard it <U+017F>poken of. Hence one naturally deaf is uncapable not only of the Sciences, but al<U+017F>o of the u<U+017F>e of Rea<U+017F>on, yea, of Speech too: Whereas, on the contrary, <U+017F>ome born blind, and who con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently never read, have neverthele<U+017F>s prov'd very learned. And this prae-eminence of Speech above Writing, appears e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66371:48"/>
in that the latter cannot be expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed without the former. Whence <U+017F>ome ju<U+017F>tly doubt whether dead Languages, even <U+017F>uch as are mo<U+017F>t familiar to us, as Greek and Latine, are not lo<U+017F>t as to their be<U+017F>t part, their pronunciation: So that the Greeks and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi>'s time, would po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly no more under<U+017F>tand us <U+017F>peaking Greek and Latine, than tho<U+017F>e of the pre<U+017F>ent Age: Whence 'twould not be knowing of things, to know them only by Books, by which al<U+017F>o none ever learn'd Languages, but only by Speech.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That this Que<U+017F>tion admits not of an ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute determination, in regard of the different capacities of Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Learners, as al<U+017F>o of the Arts or Di<U+017F>ciplines which are learn'd: For nimble Heads, and impatient of Labour, <U+017F>uch as the Cholerick and Sanguine commonly are, <U+017F>uit better with Vocal In<U+017F>tructions than with Reading; which, on the contrary is more plea<U+017F>ing and profitable to the Melancholy and Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, who take more time for reflection and meditation upon what they read. Again, Such Di<U+017F>ciplines as con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t chiefly in Contemplation, as Divinity, Natural Philo<U+017F>ophy; the pure Mathematicks; together with tho<U+017F>e which require great Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as Hi<U+017F>tory and Law, have more need of Reading. But tho<U+017F>e that con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in Action are better learn'd by Speech, which hath more affinity with action, and <U+017F>ets it out better; Such is Oratory, the practical part of Phy<U+017F>ick and Law, Mechanick Arts, and Handicrafts, which 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to learn by Books, although one may be render'd more perfect therein by them.</p>

Tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ay, 'Tis the place where the Element of Fire tran<U+017F>pires and purges its fuligino<U+017F>ities; or el<U+017F>e, a <U+017F>ort of Fire den<U+017F>er than the Elementary; are as little credible as tho<U+017F>e others who think the Sun <U+017F>ometimes made his cour<U+017F>e in this Milky-way, as he doth now in the Zodiack, in which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s he leaves no print of combu<U+017F>tion or light: Much le<U+017F>s <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophra<U+017F>tus,</hi> who <U+017F>aid, 'Twas the conglutination and <U+017F>oader of the two Hemi<U+017F>pheres; and that at the place where they are united and <U+017F>oader'd together, this brightne<U+017F>s appears different from the re<U+017F>t of Heaven. But I conceive it to be nothing el<U+017F>e but a part of Heaven, more den<U+017F>e, and con<U+017F>equently more luminous than the others. For Heaven having a radical Light, the den<U+017F>er and clo<U+017F>er its parts are, they are the more luminous; as appears by the Stars, which are the den<U+017F>er parts of their Orb, not vi<U+017F>ible in regard of its rarity; and by Water, part of which condens'd by cold, reflects the Light, and appears white, the remainder of liquid Water abiding tran<U+017F>parent.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, He judg'd no Opinion more ridiculous than <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi>'s, who held this Milky-way to be a Meteor <U+017F>hining not in Heaven, but in the Air, where 'tis fed by Exhalations plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <U+017F>upply'd from the Earth, whence they are attracted, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66371:49"/>
fired by the Stars in this place. For if this Milky-way were of the nature of Comets or other lucid Meteors, it could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, but only while its matter la<U+017F>ted; which, be<U+017F>ides, would be more copious in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons then in others, (as in Spring and Autumn, then in the droughts of Summer or fro<U+017F>ts of Winter, which clo<U+017F>es the pores of the earth); and <U+017F>o it would not have the <U+017F>ame permanent po<U+017F>ition and figure, no more then den<U+017F>ity, rarity, latitude and equality of its parts, <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tant that on the <U+017F>ide of <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>iopaea</hi> it always appears alike winding, and likewi<U+017F>e in other places: though we <U+017F>hould grant the earth ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to <U+017F>upply fumes enough for feeding this <U+017F>o <U+017F>pacious circle; which yet the di<U+017F>proportion of this point of the World, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the va<U+017F>t extent of that circumference, palpably prov'd to be in the Firmament, allows not. For (be<U+017F>ides that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ity of Parallaxes would repre<U+017F>ent it under <U+017F>everal Stars to the Inhabitants of <U+017F>everal places, if it were in the air; as it happens to Comets and other aerious impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions; and yet 'tis always <U+017F>een in the <U+017F>ame place and equally di<U+017F>tant from the fix'd Stars) its proper motion from We<U+017F>t to Ea<U+017F>t, whereby it moves one degree in a hundred years demon<U+017F>trats that 'tis in the eighth Sphere, who<U+017F>e particular motion is the <U+017F>ame. And <hi>Galileo</hi>'s Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, which have di<U+017F>cover'd abundance of Stars in this part, convincingly manife<U+017F>t that 'tis nothing but an a<U+017F><U+017F>embly of almo<U+017F>t innumerable <U+017F>mall Stars, which not being great enough to tran<U+017F>mit their light to us di<U+017F>tinctly, the <U+017F>ame is confounded and united together (as 'tis proper to all qualities, and <U+017F>o of Light, to a<U+017F><U+017F>ociate it <U+017F>elf to other light) and thus produces that whitene<U+017F>s which is a weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect light. For 'tis not enough that an object be luminous; it mu<U+017F>t be great and large, or el<U+017F>e near the eye, to be vi<U+017F>ible: the Stars, as well as all other natural agents, having a <U+017F>phere of activity, beyond which their action is not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible: hence the Planets, and of them the Moon, as neare<U+017F>t us, <U+017F>eem greater than the fix'd Stars; who<U+017F>e rayes being weakned by their di<U+017F>tance, cannot come directly to us, as tho<U+017F>e of the Planets do, but twinkle and <U+017F>parkle.</p>
            <p>Now though A<U+017F>trologers make but <U+017F>ix <U+017F>orts of fix'd Stars, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <U+017F>ix different magnitudes; (tho<U+017F>e of the fir<U+017F>t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 170 times greater then the Earth, and tho<U+017F>e of the la<U+017F>t and <U+017F>ixt, 18 times) yet <hi>Tycho Brahe, Americus Ve<U+017F>putius,</hi> and divers others, have di<U+017F>cover'd <U+017F>ome much le<U+017F>s, and le<U+017F>s luminous, then the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t. Nor are they to be credited who have limited their number to 1022, which the Scripture <U+017F>aith is infinite and known to God alone, to whom the Prophet attributes it as a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to number them and call them by their names.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, There are two <U+017F>orts of Milky-ways; one in the Air, and the other in the Heaven. The fir<U+017F>t, of which alone <hi>Aristotle</hi> <U+017F>poke, is a light produc'd by exhalations either fired or irradiated, as in Comets: from which this milky way differs only upon account of its great extent caus'd by the plenty
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66371:50"/>
of Exhalations attracted by a great number of Stars which are neer <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>iopaea</hi> and the Poles, where al<U+017F>o this Way is brighter then in other places. The other Milky Way is part of the Heaven or Firmament, equally dividing the <U+017F>ame in two, as other Circles do; although 'tis rather a Zone or Space then a Circle, as well as the Zodiack, with whom it agrees in that it hath breadth as that hath, and is oblique to the Aequinoctial, having other Poles than tho<U+017F>e of the World: but differs in that 'tis not <U+017F>o broad, the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack having <U+017F>ixteen degrees, and this commonly between eight and ten; for 'tis neither equally broad, nor luminous in all its parts; and its obliquity is much greater than that of the Zodiack, the middle of which recedes not from the Aequinoctial above 23 degrees and a half; but this about 56 degrees and a half towards the North, and neer 63 degrees towards the South. It differs al<U+017F>o from all the great Circles, in that it changes po<U+017F>ition according to the motion of the Firmament; <U+017F>o that 'tis mov'd with two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, namely, that of the Fir<U+017F>t Mover, from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t, upon the Poles of the World, making an intire revolution in one day; and another proper to it <U+017F>elf, from We<U+017F>t to Ea<U+017F>t, upon the Poles of the Ecliptick, in the <U+017F>ame time with the Firmament; which motion the other Circles have not, being either not mov'd at all, as the Horizon and Meridian; or only by the motion of the Fir<U+017F>t Mover, as the Aequinoctial, Ecliptick, Tropicks, and Colures.</p>

               </note>Upon the Second Point it was <U+017F>aid, That the Earth produces Metals to be imployed for <U+017F>everal u<U+017F>es, in order to humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Society; which being founded upon Hope and Fear, Reward and Puni<U+017F>hment, Gold and Iron, the two mo<U+017F>t powerful Metals, are highly in<U+017F>trumental to the e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing of the <U+017F>ame. Gold, which an Ancient call'd the Sun of the Earth, being the Star which gives light to our hope, and the <U+017F>weet influences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And Iron, by its ob<U+017F>cure and livid colour being the dark Star of our fear and of death, whereof 'tis the mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>ual In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But as Fear is without compari<U+017F>on <U+017F>tronger than Hope (for the one tends to the pre<U+017F>ervation of Being, the other only to Well-being) <U+017F>o Iron, the In<U+017F>trument of Terror, mu<U+017F>t likewi<U+017F>e have more powerful effects than Gold, which is only the object of Hope. Moreover, the Law relieves <U+017F>uch as the Ju<U+017F>t Fear of Iron may have con<U+017F>train'd to any thing, as being the greate<U+017F>t violence in the World; but not tho<U+017F>e whom the de<U+017F>ire of Gold or hope of Gain hath engaged to any Affair. And indeed, all Earthly Powers are mea<U+017F>ured only by the point of the Sword: Arms and Iron <U+017F>eem to be the <U+017F>hare of Kings and all the Nobility, as Gold that of Merchants and the Vulgar, from whom all Sovereigns know how to get it when they think fit. Be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>ince Gold hath need of Iron, not only for the digging of it out of the entrails of the Earth, but al<U+017F>o for defending and pre<U+017F>erving it (an evidence of its weakne<U+017F>s) it may be <U+017F>aid the prey of him who knows how to manage Iron be<U+017F>t. And <hi>Solon</hi> had rea<U+017F>on to contemn the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66371:50"/>
of <hi>Croe<U+017F>us,</hi> who made a <U+017F>hew of his riches as of his greate<U+017F>t power; foretelling him that it would become the booty of him that <U+017F>hould have a <U+017F>harper <U+017F>word. And <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> never conquer'd <U+017F>o many places by trucket with Mules laden with Gold, as his Son did whole Kingdoms by the Sword. But what power can we give to Gold, which weakens and enervates its po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ors; as appears by the Lacedemonians, who were ma<U+017F>ters of <hi>Greece</hi> whil<U+017F>t Iron alone was in u<U+017F>e with them, and were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Gold which <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> brought thither. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in <hi>Tacitus</hi> had rea<U+017F>on to believe the Gauls of his time weak in war becau<U+017F>e they were rich. For what is commonly <U+017F>aid, That Gold is the <U+017F>inew of War, is true as to the power of levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and maintaining of men, but not as to the performing of great exploits and enterpri<U+017F>es. Mercenary Souldiers and Venal Souls being ordinarily ba<U+017F>e and of ill qualities; if they do any thing, 'tis forc'd and of little duration, nor do they continue longer then the Gold la<U+017F>ts. Iron, on the contrary, is maintain'd by it <U+017F>elf and its own power. Every one fears to offend <U+017F>uch as have only Iron by their <U+017F>ide, as tho<U+017F>e by whom nothing is to be gotten, but much may be lo<U+017F>t. For to u<U+017F>e Gold for repelling enemies and diverting them el<U+017F>ewhere, con<U+017F>tant experience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>ts it a very dangerous remedy; <U+017F>ince be<U+017F>ides the ignominy of becoming, as it were, tributaries, they are never driven <U+017F>o far but they <U+017F>oon return, more irritated with the thir<U+017F>t of this Gold then they were before with the honour of Victory. In fine, <U+017F>ince men yield <U+017F>ooner to violence then to gentlene<U+017F>s, Iron which con<U+017F>trains and forces is much more powerful then Gold which per<U+017F>wades, but chiefly in War, where the brave<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t generous exploits are perform'd by open force and not by <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>es and treacheries; he not being properly overcome who was willing to be <U+017F>o, and <U+017F>uffer'd him <U+017F>elf to be corrupted: but a Victory gotten by pure Valour, ordinarily takes from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the de<U+017F>ire of returning.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Victory being the end of War, it matters not by what means that end is obtain'd, the ea<U+017F>ie<U+017F>t and lea<U+017F>t bloody of which are <U+017F>tratagems and <U+017F>urprizes; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides being the effects of Wit and Prudence, <U+017F>eem more proper to man then down-right force, wherein bea<U+017F>ts <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s us, and which is oftimes accompani'd with inju<U+017F>tice. Wherefore Gold, whereby all <U+017F>ecret intelligences are contriv'd, <U+017F>eems to have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Iron; as <U+017F>lights in War are more efficacious then open force. As al<U+017F>o it makes le<U+017F>s noi<U+017F>e and hath more fruit; whereas Iron oftentimes equally <U+017F>ubdues and weakens both parties. And Victory, the thing aimed at by War, cannot be call'd <U+017F>uch, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s it be intire. Iron indeed <U+017F>ubdues bodies, not hearts; but Gold wins both together.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That Gold and Iron may be con<U+017F>ider'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <U+017F>imply as Metals, or el<U+017F>e as In<U+017F>truments of civil life. In the former con<U+017F>ideration Gold being of a more perfect nature, hath

al<U+017F>o more power then Iron the mo<U+017F>t imperfect and terrene of all; be<U+017F>ides, its ductility makes it more capable of exten<U+017F>ion then any other; which is an evidence of its perfection. If they be con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as means and in<U+017F>truments de<U+017F>tinated to the u<U+017F>e of life, which is the noble<U+017F>t end whereunto they can be imploy'd; Gold will <U+017F>till have the advantage over Iron; <U+017F>ince, if we credit the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ts, potable Gold is profitably employ'd for health and the prorogation of life; and the <U+017F>ame Metal is al<U+017F>o the bond of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <U+017F>ociety, which cannot <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t without commerce, nor this without money, for which Gold is the mo<U+017F>t proper, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <U+017F>mall bulk the value of all other Metals of lower alloy. Hence we <U+017F>ee the people commonly rai<U+017F>e the price of it beyond what the Prince <U+017F>ets upon it; and 'tis as much de<U+017F>ir'd by all the world, as Iron is abhorr'd; all Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions and Trades aiming at the enjoyment of gold, which <U+017F>eems to be the ultimate end of all humane actions in this life, whatever di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es men a<U+017F><U+017F>ume under the pretexts of honour and vertue, who<U+017F>e lu<U+017F>tre is al<U+017F>o <U+017F>et off by that of Gold, employ'd for this purpo<U+017F>e to crown the heads of Monarchs, and to render divine wor<U+017F>hip more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That as Iron makes Hammers and Anvils which <U+017F>erve to give Gold what form we plea<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o 'tis every where the ma<U+017F>ter of gold, and con<U+017F>equently more powerful in Peace and War, affording Grates, Locks and Keys for <U+017F>ecuring Gold in the former, and Swords for defending it in the latter. For Gold <U+017F>erves only to make the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or envi'd, and inflame the de<U+017F>ires of <U+017F>uch as want it. 'Twas with Iron that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans became ma<U+017F>ters of the Gold of other Nations, and the Portugals conquer'd that of <hi>Peru,</hi> and the Swi<U+017F><U+017F>es overcame the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>; the Hi<U+017F>tory ob<U+017F>erving that all their wealth was not worth the Gold wherewith the Burgundians had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd their hor<U+017F>es bridles.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the end being not only more noble but al<U+017F>o more powerful then the means, Iron, which is commonly employ'd for the getting of Gold mu<U+017F>t be al<U+017F>o inferior to it. And 'tis univer<U+017F>ally acknowledg'd that Gold is the <U+017F>inew of War; it levies and keeps men together, it makes the Cannon move and all its train. 'Tis with Gold that we corrupt Spies, without who<U+017F>e informations all Iron and <U+017F>trength would be oftentimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. Wherefore <U+017F>ince Iron borrows its power from Gold; by the Philo<U+017F>ophical Maxim, it hath le<U+017F>s power then it.</p>

            <p>THe Fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aid, The material cau<U+017F>e of Vapours is aqueous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> humidity; the efficient, external heat; the formal,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the cau<U+017F>e of Vapours.</hi>
               </note> rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; the final, is various, according to nature's different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: but commonly, the elevation of an aqueous body, which remaining in its fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence would weigh more then air, and con<U+017F>equently could not be carried to tho<U+017F>e higher places where 'tis needful for the generation of Mixts, which cannot be done without tran<U+017F>mutation of the Elements into the places, yea, and natures al<U+017F>o, one of another. So Ro<U+017F>es in an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick would evaporate nothing, if they were depriv'd of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, as appears in their dry'd Cakes; nor what humidity may be in them, without heat; which humidity is rarifi'd and carri'd upwards before it de<U+017F>cends, being again condens'd into the water which re<U+017F>ided in the Cake before its <U+017F>eparation by heat; which con<U+017F>equently is the mo<U+017F>t evident cau<U+017F>e of Vapours.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, There are <U+017F>ome vapours that are hot and dry, as appears not only by the <U+017F>moak exhaling from boiling Pitch and other unctuous bodies; but al<U+017F>o by the vapours that i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of the earth, which would never be inflam'd <U+017F>ome in the <U+017F>urface of the earth, others in the middle of the air, and others beyond the highe<U+017F>t region, and even in the heavens, if they were only of the nature of water which quencheth in<U+017F>tead of conceiving fire: as, on the other <U+017F>ide, Rain, Hail, Snow, Dew, and other aqueous and incombu<U+017F>tible Meteors argue that all Vapours (of which they mu<U+017F>t be produc'd) are not hot and dry. Whence I conclude that as the matter of vapours is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <U+017F>o their other cau<U+017F>es are all different, e<U+017F>pecially the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For the degree of heat that evaporates water will not make Oyl exhale; as we <U+017F>ee a great gla<U+017F>s will be <U+017F>ooner evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated then a <U+017F>poonful of the latter; and the Chymi<U+017F>ts make u<U+017F>e of a <U+017F>mall fire or even of the Sun to di<U+017F>till their waters, but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their fire, to extract Oyls. Moreover (as to the material cau<U+017F>es) the vapours of hot and dry bodies are more gro<U+017F>s and earthy; tho<U+017F>e of pure water more <U+017F>ubtle; and (as to the final) aqueons vapours <U+017F>erve to irrigate, unctuous to impinguate the earth.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, 'Tis not credible that heat is the efficient cau<U+017F>e of vapours, <U+017F>ince they abound more in Winter then Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in le<U+017F>s hot Climats then in <U+017F>uch where heat predominates, which have none at all; as <hi>Egypt</hi> and other places, where it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66371:52"/>
rains. If you <U+017F>ay that there are no vapours there, becau<U+017F>e the Suns heat d<U+017F><U+017F>ipates as fa<U+017F>t as it rai<U+017F>es them, you imply heat contrary to vapours <U+017F>ince it di<U+017F><U+017F>olves them and <U+017F>uffers them not to gather into one body.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, Copiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of vapours in cold Sea<U+017F>ons and Regions makes not again<U+017F>t their production by heat; <U+017F>ince the heat which mounts them upwards is not that of the Suns rays, but from within the earth, which every one acknowledges <U+017F>o much hotter during Winter in its centre as its <U+017F>urface is colder; where the matter of vapours coming to be repercu<U+017F>s'd by the coldne<U+017F>s of the air, is thereby condens'd and receives its form. On the contrary, in Summer the earth being cold within exhales nothing; and if ought i<U+017F><U+017F>ue forth, it is not compacted but di<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by the heat of the outward air.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the thorough inqui<U+017F>ition of the cau<U+017F>e of vapours rai<U+017F>es no fewer clouds and ob<U+017F>curities in the wits of men, then their true cau<U+017F>e produces in the air: For if we attribute them to the Sun, who<U+017F>e heat penetrating the earth or outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calefying it, attracts the thinner parts of the earth and water; this is contradicted by experience which <U+017F>hews us more Rain, Storms and violent Winds in the Winter when the Suns heat is weake<U+017F>t, then in the Shmmer when his rays are more perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and as <U+017F>uch ought to penetrate deeper into the earth, and from its centre or <U+017F>urface attract greater plenty of vapours: the contrary whereof falls out. It follows therefore that the Sun hath no <U+017F>uch attractive faculty. Nor is the coldne<U+017F>s and dryne<U+017F>s of the earth any way proper for the production of <U+017F>uch humid <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances as Vapours and Exhalations; the latter whereof being more <U+017F>ubtle, and con<U+017F>equently more moveable (as appears by Earth-quakes, Winds and Tempe<U+017F>ts, which are made with greater violence then Rain, Showers, or Dew) cannot be engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of earth, much gro<U+017F><U+017F>er then water, which is held the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial cau<U+017F>e of vapour; otherwi<U+017F>e, an exhalation being earthy <U+017F>hould be more gro<U+017F>s then a vapour extracted out of water; which it is not. It remains then that the cau<U+017F>e of vapours is the internal heat of the earth which being encreas'd from without by the cold of the ambient air, or exhaling all its pores open'd by the heat of the Sun, produces the diver<U+017F>ity of Meteors. And this internal heat of the earth appears in Winter by the reak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Springs, and the warmth of Caves and <U+017F>ubterraneous places; yea the Sea it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>aid to <U+017F>upply the principle matter to the<U+017F>e vapours, is affirm'd hotter at the bottom, whither therefore the Fi<U+017F>hes retire; and indeed it is <U+017F>o in its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, as appears by its <U+017F>alt, bitterne<U+017F>s and motion, whence 'tis call'd by the Latines <hi>Ae<U+017F>tus.</hi> And as in the bodies of Animals, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours i<U+017F><U+017F>uing by the pores open'd by heat cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>weat, and when tho<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages are <U+017F>topt by the coldne<U+017F>s of the outward air, their <U+017F>ubtler parts are re<U+017F>olv'd into flatuo<U+017F>ities, and the more gro<U+017F>s and humid are carried up to the Brain, by who<U+017F>e coldne<U+017F>s
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66371:52"/>
being condens'd they fall down upon other parts, and produce defluxions: <U+017F>o in the world, which, like us, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of <U+017F>olid parts (earth and <U+017F>tones) of fluid (the waters) and of rapid (which are the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtle and tenuious parts of the Ma<U+017F>s) when the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t happen to be a<U+017F><U+017F>ociated with others more gro<U+017F>s they carry them up on high with them<U+017F>elves, where they meet with other natural cau<U+017F>es of Cold and Heat which rarefies or conden<U+017F>es, and redouble their impetuo<U+017F>ity by the occurrence of <U+017F>ome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tacle in their way: the<U+017F>e Spirits being incapable of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becau<U+017F>e 'tis proper to them to wander freely through the World. Elementary qualities are indeed found joyn'd with the<U+017F>e vapours and exhalations; but are no more the cau<U+017F>es of them then of our animal vital or natural <U+017F>pirits, which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e imbu'd with the <U+017F>ame.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That the general cau<U+017F>e of vapours is Heaven; which by its motion, light, and influences, heating and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Elements, <U+017F>ubtili<U+017F>es them and extracts their pure<U+017F>t parts: as appears by the Sea who<U+017F>e <U+017F>altne<U+017F>s proceeds from the Suns having drawn away the lighter and fre<U+017F>her parts, and left the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er and bitter in the <U+017F>urface, cold and heat conden<U+017F>e and rarefie other, and by this Reciprocation the harmonious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the four Elements is continu'd; <U+017F>ometimes temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earths exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive dryne<U+017F>s by gentle Dews or fruitful Rains, and <U+017F>ometimes correcting the too great humidity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of the air by winds and igneous impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <U+017F>ome of which <U+017F>erve al<U+017F>o to adorn the World and in<U+017F>truct Men. And as the<U+017F>e vapours are for the common good of the Univer<U+017F>e, in which they maintain Generations, and for pre<U+017F>ervation of the Elements, who by this means purge their impurities; <U+017F>o they all contribute to the matter of them. Fire forms mo<U+017F>t igneous and luminous impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions; Air rarefi'd <U+017F>upplies matter for winds, as is <U+017F>een in the <hi>Aeolipila</hi>; and condens'd is turn'd into rain. But e<U+017F>pecially water and earth (the gro<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t Elements, and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject to the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of outward agents) continually emit fumes or <U+017F>teams out of their bo<U+017F>om, which are always ob<U+017F>erv'd in the <U+017F>urface of the Terraqueous Globe, even in the cleare<U+017F>t days of the year, and form the diver<U+017F>ity of paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes. The<U+017F>e fumes are either dry or moi<U+017F>t; the dry ari<U+017F>e out of the earth, and are call'd Exhalations; the moi<U+017F>t are Vapours and i<U+017F><U+017F>ue from the water: yet both are endu'd with an adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious heat either from <U+017F>ubterranean fires or the heat of Heaven, or the mixture of fire. A Vapour is le<U+017F>s hot then an Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becau<U+017F>e its aqueous humidity abates its heat; whereas that of the latter is promoted by its dryne<U+017F>s; which yet mu<U+017F>t be a little <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on'd with humidity, the <U+017F>ole aliment and man<U+017F>ion of heat, which hath no operation upon bodies totally dry; whence a<U+017F>hes remain incorruptible in the mid<U+017F>t of flames and evaporate nothing. But whatever be the cau<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e vapours, they are not only more tenuious under that form, but al<U+017F>o after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<U+017F><U+017F>umption
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66371:53"/>
of their own. So Dew is a more potent di<U+017F><U+017F>olver and penetrates more then common water; which <U+017F>ome attribute to the Nitre wherewith the earth abounds.</p>

But as every virtue con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in a mediocrity, and <U+017F>o hath two vicious extremities, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s and Defect; <U+017F>o this is plac'd between two vices which may be <U+017F>aid equally blamable, <U+017F>ince between the two extremities and the middle the di<U+017F>tance is equal (otherwi<U+017F>e it were not the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that is, not a vertue) and a point in which this vertue con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts hath no latitude. And, though ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s, which oftimes bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows the ma<U+017F>k of genero<U+017F>ity and valour, <U+017F>eems to approach neerer it then Cowardice; <U+017F>ince being only an exce<U+017F>s of Valour, it may be more ea<U+017F>ily reduc'd to mediocrity then the other which partakes not thereof at all; as di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es ari<U+017F>ing from reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ea<U+017F>ier to be cur'd then tho<U+017F>e which proceed from inaniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Neverthele<U+017F>s to <U+017F>peak ab<U+017F>olutely, Cowardice is not <U+017F>o vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as Temerity; for if the one hath a fal<U+017F>e appearance of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the other hath a <U+017F>emblance of prudence and wi<U+017F>dom which is the rule and mea<U+017F>ure of all virtues. And indeed, we <U+017F>ee mo<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>e men are a little cowardly; either their knowledg of things rendring them circum<U+017F>pect:, or experience of Fortune's blindne<U+017F>s and incon<U+017F>tancy making them more di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful of her dealing, which they know is commonly unkinde<U+017F>t to per<U+017F>ons of merit; or el<U+017F>e the value they put upon Being encrea<U+017F>ing their fear of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation; although this fear is common to all Animals, and hath its foundation in Nature, and <U+017F>o is more excu<U+017F>able then the madne<U+017F>s of Temerity, the u<U+017F>ual vice of fools and lunaticks, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly repugnant to our natural <U+017F>entiments. In a political con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration though both are puni<U+017F>hable, yet Cowardice lea<U+017F>t of the two, and is mo<U+017F>t commonly excus'd, as in <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi>; yea <U+017F>ometimes recompen<U+017F>ed, as in that Roman Con<U+017F>ul to whom the Senate gave publick thanks for having fled at the defeat of <hi>Cannae</hi>: Where the temerity of young <hi>Manlius,</hi> though <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>sful, co<U+017F>t him his head by the <U+017F>entence of his own Father.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Cowardice and Temerity mu<U+017F>t not be compar'd together if we would judge which is wor<U+017F>e; for on the one <U+017F>ide the ra<U+017F>h per<U+017F>on compar'd to the poltron <U+017F>eems cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous, and on the other the poltron appears prudent and well advis'd. But they mu<U+017F>t be compar'd with Valour, of which that of the two which partakes lea<U+017F>t is the mo<U+017F>t vicious. Now, Valour con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in two points, to attempt and endure.

He dares neither attempt nor bear up, and <U+017F>o is further from true fortitude then the Ra<U+017F>h; and though they <U+017F>eem totally oppo<U+017F>ite, yet the ra<U+017F>h is oftentimes timerous, and Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity or De<U+017F>pair <U+017F>ometimes renders the verye<U+017F>t coward bold.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, If the Stoicks <U+017F>ay true, that Nature is the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t guide we can follow in all our actions, and that to live well and vertuou<U+017F>ly is to live conformably to Nature; then Temerity which <U+017F>ubverts the <U+017F>entiments of Nature, by whom nothing is <U+017F>ought <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>elf-pre<U+017F>ervation, <U+017F>eems much more vicious then Cowardice, who<U+017F>e fault is only too much indulgence and inclining to natural <U+017F>entiments, in preference of <U+017F>elf-pre<U+017F>ervation above all honours invented by men as incitements to contempt of death, and the means leading thereunto.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid. As right Rea<U+017F>on is the <U+017F>quare of Prudence, Equity of Ju<U+017F>tice, and Moderation of Temperance; <U+017F>o firmne<U+017F>s and con<U+017F>tancy of mind in attempting and enduring, is the <U+017F>ign of Fortitude and Courage, which is a vertue re<U+017F>iding in the Ira<U+017F>cible appetite, moderating fear and ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting chiefly in not fearing dangers more then is fit, e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e of War or which happen unexpectedly. For two kinds of things cau<U+017F>e fear: <U+017F>ome are above us and inevitable; as Tempe<U+017F>ts, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Earth-quakes which a man may and ought to fear <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, unle<U+017F>s we be in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible or <U+017F>en<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s; others are ordinary, vincible, and not to be fear'd by the courageous. To whom three <U+017F>orts of people are contrary; namely, the furious, who fear nothing at all; the ra<U+017F>h who venture at all, ca<U+017F>ting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves incon<U+017F>iderately into all dangers; and the poltrons who never venture upon any. The<U+017F>e tremble before and in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>eem at fir<U+017F>t to have a good heart, but when the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger appears begin to tremble and bleed at the no<U+017F>e: whereas he who is truly courageous attempts no danger incon<U+017F>iderately, but avoids it as much as he can hand<U+017F>omely; but once engag'd, lo<U+017F>es his life therein if he cannot come out of it with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And though this vertue be generally e<U+017F>teem'd by all men, becau<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>erviceable for defence of States, and hath more <U+017F>plendor and <U+017F>hew then any other; yet 'tis le<U+017F>s known and the rare<U+017F>t of all; not many po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ing it free from the intere<U+017F>t of gain or vanity, anger, fear of infamy, con<U+017F>traint and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderations be<U+017F>ides that of hone<U+017F>ty, which alone gives name and value to all vertuous actions. Ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s pa<U+017F><U+017F>es among the vulgar for true Valour, though 'tis further from it then Cowardice; which being the daughter of knowledg and prudence, (as ra<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s is of ignorance and brutality, and oftentimes of vanity) <U+017F>eems to come neerer that virtue then Temerity, which otherwi<U+017F>e is incompatible with all other virtues, as being de<U+017F>titute of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which alone makes them what they are.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, 'Tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to determine of the<U+017F>e two Vices; which are equally oppo<U+017F>ite to their middle vertue,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66371:54"/>
whatever fal<U+017F>e appearance Temerity may have of the contrary. But the prai<U+017F>e and blame of men proceeding commonly, though unju<U+017F>tly, from Succe<U+017F>s; 'tis that al<U+017F>o which makes our actions approv'd and di<U+017F>commended. So that the <U+017F>ame action will be accounted courageous, and as <U+017F>uch applauded in a young <U+017F>tout Captain who gets the better of his enemies, (pro<U+017F>perous Ra<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s being rarely puni<U+017F>h'd); and again term'd temerarious in the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on, if he happens to be wor<U+017F>ted. Yea men e<U+017F>teem and admire that mo<U+017F>t which they lea<U+017F>t expected, as mo<U+017F>t remote from rea<U+017F>on without which the Vertuous acts nothing. Which teaches him to be contented with him<U+017F>elf, and not to make much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of blame and prai<U+017F>e, which are not integral parts of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but only <U+017F>erve to its ornament, as our Hair and Nails do to our per<U+017F>ons.</p>

            <p>BEcau<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t all <hi>Phaenomena</hi> or Apparences caus'd by the Cele<U+017F>tial Bodies, the diver<U+017F>ity of artificial Days is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and known to the mo<U+017F>t ignorant; therefore A<U+017F>tronomers make u<U+017F>e thereof to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the <U+017F>everal habitations of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This diver<U+017F>ity of Days depends upon two Cau<U+017F>es; the obliquity of the Ecliptick to the Equator, and the inclination of the Horizon or the Sphere to the <U+017F>ame Equator. For the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity of the Ecliptick makes the diurnal Parallels, which are Circles parallel to the Equinoctial, de<U+017F>crib'd by the Sun as he is carri'd about the Earth by the motion of the Fir<U+017F>t Mover; the number of which is equal to that of the Days comprehended in half a year. And the obliquity of the Horizon is the cau<U+017F>e that the<U+017F>e parallels are cut by it unequally. Otherwi<U+017F>e if the<U+017F>e parallels were not different from the Equator, or (although different) if they were cut equally by the Horizon (as it happens in a Right Sphere) the Horizon which is a great Circle pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by the Poles of the<U+017F>e parallels, (which are the <U+017F>ame with tho<U+017F>e of the World) both the Days and Nights would be equal: <U+017F>o that where the Sphere is not inclin'd, as in the Right and Parallel Spheres, there is no inequality of Days, nor con<U+017F>equently of Climate (<U+017F>o call'd from its Inclination) but only in the oblique Sphere. 'Tis defin'd, a Region of Earth comprehended between two circles parallel to the Equator; in which there is the difference of half
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66371:54"/>
an hour in the longe<U+017F>t days of the year. It encompa<U+017F><U+017F>es the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>trial Globe from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t, as a Zone doth, which differs from it only as the Zone is broader; whence there are many Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats in the <U+017F>ame Zone. The Ancients having regard only to <U+017F>o much of the Earth as they believ'd inhabited, made but <U+017F>even Climats, which they extended not beyond the places where the longe<U+017F>t days are 16 hours, and denominated from the mo<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable places by which they made them pa<U+017F>s; as, the fir<U+017F>t Northern Climat was call'd <hi>Dia Meroes,</hi> hy <hi>Meroe,</hi> which they began at 12 deg. 43 min. from the Aequinoctial, where the longe<U+017F>t day hath 12 hours three quarters, and which at pre<U+017F>ent is the end of our fir<U+017F>t Climat and beginning of the <U+017F>econd. This fir<U+017F>t Climat pa<U+017F><U+017F>es by <hi>Malaca</hi> a City of the Ea<U+017F>t-Indies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at 4 deg. 18 min. Its middle, from which all Climats are reckon'd, hath 8 deg. 34 min. and its end, 12 deg. 43 min. The other <U+017F>ix Climats of the Ancients pa<U+017F>s'd by <hi>Siene, Alexandria, Rhodes, Rome, Pontus Euxinus,</hi> and the River <hi>Bori<U+017F>thenes. Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> reckons twenty one, as far as the I<U+017F>land <hi>Thule</hi> which lies in 63 deg. of Northern Latitude. Our modern A<U+017F>tronomers make twenty four, from the Aequinoctial to the Polar Circles; in each of which Climats the longe<U+017F>t day of Summer encrea<U+017F>es half an hour above twelve, according as they approach nearer tho<U+017F>e Circles: beyond which to the Poles of the World they place <U+017F>ix more, not di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd by the variation of half an hour but of 30 days. So that there is in all, <U+017F>ixty Climats, 30 Northern and as many Southern, each comprehended by two Parallels: which Climats are ea<U+017F>ily found by doubling the exce<U+017F>s whereby the longe<U+017F>t day <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>es twelve hours; the Product being the Climat of the place. As if you know the longe<U+017F>t Summer day at <hi>Paris</hi> to be 16 hours, double 4, the exce<U+017F>s above 12, and you will have 8, which is the Climat of <hi>Paris</hi>; and <U+017F>o of others. And though there be the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on of Sea<U+017F>ons and other vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in the Southern and Northern Climats, yet <U+017F>ince experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <U+017F>hews us that tho<U+017F>e of the South are not inhabited beyond the 8th, which is about the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> at the farthe<U+017F>t point of <hi>Africa,</hi> (beyond which no Inhabitants are as yet di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, it may <U+017F>eem that the diver<U+017F>ity of Climats is not alone <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for long or <U+017F>hort life, but there are other cau<U+017F>es concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereunto.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ince a thing is pre<U+017F>erv'd by that which produces it, the Sun and Stars, which concur to the generation of all living Creatures, mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o contribute to their pre<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and continuance in life; which being maintain'd by u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ame things (variety and change, though delightful, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mo<U+017F>t manife<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of brevity of life) that Climat which is mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>tant and lea<U+017F>t variable will be the propere<U+017F>t for <hi>longaevity,</hi> and <U+017F>o much the more if it <U+017F>uits with our nature; <U+017F>uch is the fir<U+017F>t Climat next the Aequinoctial, where things being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t always alike, bodies accu<U+017F>tom'd thereunto receive le<U+017F>s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience

thereby then under others, who<U+017F>e inequalities and irregularities produce mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. The natural purity of the Air, promoted by the breath of a gentle Ea<U+017F>t Wind there reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually; and the want of vapours and humidities, which commonly infect our Air, conduce greatly to the health of the Inhabitants; al<U+017F>o when the dryne<U+017F>s and coldne<U+017F>s of their temper makes longer-liv'd, as appears by Ravens and Elephants, the mo<U+017F>t melancholy of all Animals, which are common in the<U+017F>e parts where they live above 300 years.

            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Since Heaven is immutable and always like to it <U+017F>elf, the Earth and Elements alone <U+017F>ubject to change; the length and <U+017F>hortne<U+017F>s of Life <U+017F>eems not to depend on Heaven but on Earth and the <U+017F>everal di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of our Bodies: and the whole World being Man's Country, there is no place in it but is equally proper for his habitation, provided he be born there; becau<U+017F>e the Air he breathes and the Food he eats from his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, altering his Body, at length make his temper <U+017F>uitable to that of the place of his Education; which therefore he loves above any other.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That Heaven remaining it <U+017F>elf immutable, is neverthele<U+017F>s the cau<U+017F>e of motions and mutations here below; its light producing different effects in the Earth according as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible whereof are heat, dryne<U+017F>s, and other qualities which diver<U+017F>ifie the Sea<U+017F>ons and Zones; of which the two temperate, e<U+017F>pecially the Northern <U+017F>eems mo<U+017F>t habitable and proper for <hi>longaevity.</hi> 'Tis al<U+017F>o the mo<U+017F>t populous, and its Natives are not only the mo<U+017F>t healthy and lu<U+017F>ty, but al<U+017F>o the mo<U+017F>t refin'd and civiliz'd of all others. Now of the Climats of this Zone, the eighth, wherein <hi>Paris</hi> lyes, <U+017F>eems to me the healthie<U+017F>t of all, as well for purene<U+017F>s of Air as all other Cau<U+017F>es.</p>

               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:66371:55"/>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the goodne<U+017F>s of Climats depends not <U+017F>o much upon Heaven as the <U+017F>ituation of each place in reference to the Winds, of which the Southern being the mo<U+017F>t unhealthy, therefore Towns defended by Mountains on the South are very healthy, e<U+017F>pecially if they lye towards the Ea<U+017F>t, the Winds whereof are mo<U+017F>t healthy. And this is the cau<U+017F>e of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity ob<U+017F>erv'd in Countries lying in the <U+017F>ame Climat, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience not the <U+017F>ame changes: as the I<U+017F>le of <hi>France</hi> is very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and yet lyes in the <U+017F>ame Climat with <hi>Podolia</hi> (a part of <hi>Poland</hi>) where the cold is extreamly rigorous: and in the I<U+017F>lands <hi>Bornaio</hi> and <hi>Sumatra</hi> men live commonly 130 years and are not black, as the Africans, who<U+017F>e life is very <U+017F>hort, and yet they lye in the <U+017F>ame Climat, namely, under the Aequinoctial Line.</p>

The violent heat of the Climats near the Equator con<U+017F>umes the radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture and makes the natural heat langui<U+017F>h; although under the Line the coolne<U+017F>s of the nights twelve hours long, renders it more <U+017F>upportable: whereas in our longe<U+017F>t Summer-days when the Sun is in <hi>Cancer,</hi> he is no more then 18 degrees from the Horizon and <U+017F>o diffu<U+017F>es his rays upon the vapours hovering about the Earth, which reflecting the <U+017F>ame after a refraction make the nights almo<U+017F>t always light, and con<U+017F>equently hot; there being no light without heat. On the contrary, the Northern parts towards the Pole, receiving the Suns rays only obliquely are very cold and unfit for long-life, combating the heat and de<U+017F>ic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the radical moi<U+017F>ture.

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, The<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ciplines are to be con<U+017F>ider'd either according to their right u<U+017F>e, or as they are practis'd. Phy<U+017F>ick, con<U+017F>ider'd in its right admini<U+017F>tration, is the art of curing Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es and pre<U+017F>erving Health, without which there is no plea<U+017F>ure in the World.

And though Laws and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice <U+017F>erve for the ornament of a State, yet they are not ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to its con<U+017F>ervation, there being <U+017F>ociety among Robbers; and many States having begun and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, Violences and other inju<U+017F>tices, but none without Health, which is the foundation of all goods, pre<U+017F>erving the ab<U+017F>olute Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every thing, and by that means maintaining all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Body and Mind. Wherefore Phy<U+017F>ick is profitable not only to the Body but al<U+017F>o to the Soul, who<U+017F>e nature, faculties, and actions it contemplates. But if the<U+017F>e Arts be con<U+017F>ider'd as they are practis'd now a days, 'tis certain that if there are Mountebanks, Ignorants, and Cheats who practi<U+017F>e Phy<U+017F>ick among<U+017F>t a good number of good Phy<U+017F>itians; there are al<U+017F>o, Champertors, Forgers, and other <U+017F>uch black <U+017F>ouls, who live by fraud, which they exerci<U+017F>e under the ma<U+017F>k of ju<U+017F>tice. We mu<U+017F>t likewi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the bad judgments of certain Nations from the truth. For if the Romans <U+017F>ometimes bani<U+017F>h'd their Phy<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Chirurgians; this might be done out of ignorance, as when they <U+017F>aw the Gangren'd Leg of one of their Citizens cut off. And though they were for <U+017F>ome time without Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itians, yet they were never without Phy<U+017F>ick, at lea<U+017F>t natural.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Law hath the pre-eminence above Phy<U+017F>ick upon account of the great benefits it brings to a State, by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the <U+017F>ame from greater, more trouble<U+017F>ome, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable evils. And good (according to the Moral axiom) being the more divine by how much 'tis more common and diffus'd, it follows that Law is more divine then Phy<U+017F>ick. For by checking our pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions and ob<U+017F>tructing the career of illegal Ambitions and U<U+017F>urpations, it does good not only to private per<U+017F>ons, as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66371:56"/>
doth, but al<U+017F>o to the whole Publick, which is engag'd by particular pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, whence Law-<U+017F>utes, Seditions, Wars, and other evils ari<U+017F>e; which being publick are of more importance then tho<U+017F>e to which Phy<U+017F>ick is de<U+017F>ign'd, who<U+017F>e whole bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is about the four humours, either to keep them in a ju<U+017F>t temper, or reduce them to their natural <U+017F>tate, from which Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch them. Be<U+017F>ides, Phy<U+017F>ick only cures the Body, whereas Law repre<U+017F><U+017F>es the mind's di<U+017F>orders, and even the intentions. La<U+017F>tly, the evils Phy<U+017F>ick defends us from, are of ea<U+017F>ie cure, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible indications; but Law remedies <U+017F>uch as depend upon the thoughts and coun<U+017F>els of men, impenetrable by <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. Moreover, Phy<U+017F>ick regards only particular per<U+017F>ons; but Law maintains a moral union and good intelligence between all the parts of a Commonwealth, namely, men of <U+017F>everal conditions, and keeps every one within the bounds of his own quality and <U+017F>tation; and <U+017F>o is like a Univer<U+017F>al Spirit or Intelligence pre<U+017F>iding over all our motions, hindring ruptures and di<U+017F><U+017F>en<U+017F>ions (the bane of a State) as that doth vacuity, which tends to the de<U+017F>truction of the World.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That as the multitude of Phy<U+017F>itians in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a <U+017F>ign of a multitude of di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es reigning therein; <U+017F>o the multitude of Laws and Judges argues corruption of manners. Wherefore both the<U+017F>e Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions may <U+017F>eem equally u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s to a State free from wicked and mi<U+017F>erable per<U+017F>ons. And indeed we <U+017F>ee many Nations have wanted both: at <hi>Rome</hi> Phy<U+017F>itians were unknown for divers ages, and are <U+017F>o <U+017F>till in <U+017F>ome Countries: and mo<U+017F>t States of the World di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>e very well with the want of Lawyers, who<U+017F>e contrary opinions are as de<U+017F>tructive to the State, and particular per<U+017F>ons, as the number of Phy<U+017F>itians is to the Sick. And as they are mo<U+017F>t healthful who u<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e lea<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o the mo<U+017F>t flouri<U+017F>hing States have fewe<U+017F>t Lawyers; Wrangling, which is the daughter of Law, being the mo<U+017F>t apparent cau<U+017F>e of the diminution of the <U+017F>trength of Chri<U+017F>tendom, where for <U+017F>ome Ages it hath reign'd; either by diverting the greate<U+017F>t num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of its Mini<U+017F>ters from the exerci<U+017F>e of War, the principal means of amplifying a State, or by unprofitably taking up the people in Sutes. And therefore the Spaniards found no <U+017F>afer cour<U+017F>e to pre<U+017F>erve the new World to them<U+017F>elves, then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring all Lawyers entrance into it.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That this made for the Phy<U+017F>itians. For the Spaniards <U+017F>ent many of them to the new World, to di<U+017F>cover the <U+017F>imples there and bring them into <hi>Europe.</hi> Moreover, as 'tis more nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to live and to live in health, then to live in <U+017F>ociety or riches (which are the things Law takes care of) <U+017F>o much doth Law yield to Phy<U+017F>ick in this point, which Gods Word, who commands to honour the Phy<U+017F>itian, <U+017F>aith was created for nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Which as plainly decides the Que<U+017F>tion as that Re<U+017F>olution was worthy of the Fool of <hi>Frace<U+017F>co Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> which he gave in the like Di<U+017F>pute of preference between the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66371:57"/>
Phy<U+017F>itians and Advocates; That at Executions the Thief marches before the Hang-man. Moreover Kings, who are above Laws, <U+017F>ubject them<U+017F>elves to tho<U+017F>e of Phy<U+017F>itians, whom <hi>Julius Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> honour'd with the right of Incorporation into the City. Whereunto add the certainty of this Art (which is the true note of the excellence of a Di<U+017F>cipline) being founded upon natural Agents, who<U+017F>e effects are infallible; whereas Law hath no other foundation but the will and phan<U+017F>ie of Men, which changes with Times, Places, and Per<U+017F>ons.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXVIII. Of Sea-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s.</head>
            <p>NAture hath furni<U+017F>h'd Things with two ways of pre<U+017F>erving the Being <U+017F>he hath given them, namely, to <U+017F>eek their good and flee their evil. Both which, Animals do by attracting what is proper to their nature by right fibers, and rejecting what is otherwi<U+017F>e by tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e fibers, of which the Expul<U+017F>ive Faculty makes u<U+017F>e. So when the Stomack is <U+017F>urcharg'd with too great a quantity of matter, or goaded by its acrimony, the expul<U+017F>ive Faculty of this part being irritated by what is contrary to it, ca<U+017F>ts it forth by yexing, belching, and vomiting. Yexing is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd motion of the upper Orifice of the Stomach which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and opens it <U+017F>elf to expell <U+017F>ome thing adhering to its Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or orbicular Mu<U+017F>cles; which being commonly a <U+017F>harp and pungent vapour, we <U+017F>ee this Hickcock is remov'd by a cup of cold water, or el<U+017F>e by holding the breath; for the coldne<U+017F>s of the water repre<U+017F><U+017F>es the acrimony of the vapour'd, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>train'd Spirits by heat cau<U+017F>e it to re<U+017F>olve and evaporate. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting is al<U+017F>o a deprav'd motion of the Stomack, which contracts it <U+017F>elf at the bottom to drive out <U+017F>ome trouble<U+017F>ome matter; which, if it adhere too fa<U+017F>t, or Nature be not <U+017F>trong enough, cau<U+017F>eth Nau<U+017F>eou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s or a vain de<U+017F>ire to vomit. Belching is caus'd when the <U+017F>aid matter is flatuous and meets no ob<U+017F>tacle. The<U+017F>e motions are either through the proper vice of the Stomack, or through <U+017F>ympathy with <U+017F>ome other part. The former proceeds <U+017F>ometimes from a cold and moi<U+017F>t intemperies. Whence man, the moi<U+017F>te<U+017F>t of all Animals, is alone <U+017F>ubject to Vomiting, except Dogs and Cats; but he only has the Hickcock; and Children, as being very humid vomit frequently. Sometimes 'tis from a faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conformation of the Stomack, as when 'tis too <U+017F>traight, or from <U+017F>ome trouble<U+017F>ome matter, either internal or external. The internal is a pungent humour, and <U+017F>ometimes Worms. In <U+017F>hort, every thing that any way irritates the Expul<U+017F>ive and weakens the Retentive Faculty: So, oyly, fat, and <U+017F>weet things
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66371:57"/>
floating upon the Stomack, provoke to vomit by relaxing the fibres which <U+017F>erve for retention. External cau<U+017F>es are all <U+017F>uch, as either irritate or relax the Stomack; as, <U+017F>tinking Smells, and the <U+017F>ole imagination of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing things, violent winds; exerci<U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch wherein the Body is mov'd by <U+017F>omthing el<U+017F>e, and contributes not it <U+017F>elf to the motion, as going in a Coach or a Ship; for here the Body re<U+017F>ts and al<U+017F>o the parts are relax'd, only the Spirits agitated by this motion act more <U+017F>trongly upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and the<U+017F>e are here more ea<U+017F>ily evacuated by rea<U+017F>on of the relaxation of the fibres then in other exerci<U+017F>es, wherein the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <U+017F>tirs it <U+017F>elf; as riding-po<U+017F>t, or a troat, in which the Nerves are bent, and con<U+017F>equently, all the parts more vigorous, and hence vomiting is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie. 'Tis al<U+017F>o the equality of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which makes per<U+017F>ons, unus'd to go in a Coach, vomit <U+017F>ooner when the Coach goes in a <U+017F>mooth and even field then upon rough ways. The <U+017F>ame hapning upon the Sea, 'tis no wonder if people be <U+017F>o apt to vomit there.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That neither the agitation of the Air, nor the motion of the Body can be the <U+017F>ole cau<U+017F>e of Vomiting, and other Sea-maladies; <U+017F>ince the like and more violent at Land, as Swings, Charets, and Po<U+017F>ts, produce not the <U+017F>ame effects. For we con<U+017F>ider the agitation of the Stomack as the cau<U+017F>e of vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that of the Feet and Legs being but accidental; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience te<U+017F>tifies, that 'tis not the lifting up but the falling down of the Ship that cau<U+017F>es the ri<U+017F>ing of the Stomack. Wherefore I <U+017F>hould rather pitch upon the <U+017F>alt-air of the Sea, abounding with <U+017F>harp and mordicant Vapours: which being attracted by re<U+017F>piration trouble the Stomack, e<U+017F>pecially its <U+017F>uperior orifice, the <U+017F>eat of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive Appetite by rea<U+017F>on of the Nerves of the <U+017F>ixth Conjugation: thus the door being open, the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Stomack, which is al<U+017F>o infected with the malignity of the<U+017F>e vapours, is voided by the ordinary ways: as happens <U+017F>ometimes to <U+017F>uch who only come near the Sea. Indeed the bitterne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>altne<U+017F>s of the humour in the Mouth, which is the forerunner of Vomiting, together with the quivering of the nether Lip, proceeding from the continuity of the inward membrane of the Stomack with that of the Gullet and Mouth, manife<U+017F>ts the vapours which excite it to be <U+017F>alt and nitrous. Whence al<U+017F>o plain water drunk with a little <U+017F>alt, cau<U+017F>es Vomit. Now if this malady happens <U+017F>ooner in a Tempe<U+017F>t, 'tis becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e nitrous <U+017F>pirits are more <U+017F>tirr'd in the to<U+017F><U+017F>ing of the Sea than in a Calm: as they <U+017F>ay, 'tis more frequent in the Torrid Zone, becau<U+017F>e there is a greater attraction of the <U+017F>aid Spirits by the heat of the Climate, which on the other is an enemy to the Stomack, extreamly weakning it, as cold much helps its functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such as go into deep Mines, are <U+017F>eis'd with the like di<U+017F>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to this of the Sea, by re<U+017F>piration of the nitrous Spirits which i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of the entrails of the Earth and are the cau<U+017F>e of its fecundity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:66371:58"/>The Third <U+017F>aid, That <hi>Cato</hi> (who repented of three things, (1.) Of having told a Secret to his Wife, (2.) Of having <U+017F>pent a day without doing <U+017F>omthing, And (3.) of having gone by Sea when he might have gone by Land) had no doubt experienc'd the michiefs of that unfaithful Element: the cruelle<U+017F>t whereof is the Scurvy, a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e complicated with <U+017F>everal others, and who<U+017F>e chief <U+017F>ymptoms, are the ulceration and <U+017F>welling of the Gums and Legs, with pains over all the Body, caus'd by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity and malignity of the Air. But the mo<U+017F>t frequent is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, caus'd by the <U+017F>ole agitation and violence of the Air. For our aerious Spirits not only receive the qualities of the air we breathe, but al<U+017F>o follow its temper and motion, as is <U+017F>een by the Head-ach, <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ing tho<U+017F>e that are beaten by winds in the Country; and by the <U+017F>eeming turning of their heads who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively behold the circumgyration of a Wheel or <U+017F>ome other Body. So the Air at Sea being much agitated puts in motion the Spirits which are of the <U+017F>ame nature, and the<U+017F>e being <U+017F>tirr'd <U+017F>et the humours on work, which incommoding the parts are by them driven out by vomits and other ejections, according to every one's temper and propen<U+017F>ity. For the cholerick and broad-brea<U+017F>ted, vomit more ea<U+017F>ily and <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully then the phlegmatick and narrow-brea<U+017F>ted, who<U+017F>e Organs of re<U+017F>pirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not <U+017F>ufficiently free. Whereunto al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on of the year contributes; for Summer provokes vomit more then Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the humours being more heavy, rather tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But e<U+017F>pecially Cu<U+017F>tom is con<U+017F>iderable herein, which renders tho<U+017F>e that go frequently to Sea not obnoxious to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the Earth con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of three <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances; one Unctuous, which is the inflammable moi<U+017F>ture, call'd by the Chymi<U+017F>ts Sulphur; another Cinereou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, which they call the <hi>Faeces</hi> or <hi>Caput mortuum</hi>; the third humid and incombu<U+017F>tible, which they divide into Mercury and Salt; this latter again into Salt-nitre and Vitriol, of which the Sea being full, the <U+017F>ame is communicated to the fir<U+017F>t Region of the Air contiguous to the Waters; and, in<U+017F>inuating it <U+017F>elf into our Bodies by in<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; produces the <U+017F>ame effects therein, that it doth taken in <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; four Grains of which is a <U+017F>ufficient Vomit. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to al<U+017F>o helps the gentle agitation of the waves, which makes it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate; the examples of others vomiting, and e<U+017F>pecially the fear commonly incident to <U+017F>uch as were never upon the Sea before, who are mo<U+017F>t obnoxious to this trouble. For that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tringes the whole Body, e<U+017F>pecially the inward parts, that it weakens and relaxes the Nerves, e<U+017F>pecially the Fibres which keep the parts in a ju<U+017F>t tenor; and <U+017F>o the oblique Fibres and orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Mu<U+017F>cles (which <U+017F>erve to retain them) being languid, <U+017F>uffer the juices and humours to pa<U+017F>s out.

Hence oftentimes, Anger, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, Panick fright, and <U+017F>uch other Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions <U+017F>ei<U+017F>e upon us without cau<U+017F>e; and Love doth the like frequently, without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent rea<U+017F>on. Yea, we may <U+017F>ay, there is no Love of Knowledg but what took its fir<U+017F>t ri<U+017F>e from that of Inclination, which pre<U+017F>ently makes us enamor'd of the proportions of a Face, which di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>es another that under<U+017F>tands the <U+017F>ame as well as we, but without being any way affected therewith, becau<U+017F>e he finds not in it that corre<U+017F>pondence and <U+017F>ympathetical re<U+017F>emblance that produces a Love of Inclination, which may al<U+017F>o ari<U+017F>e without any knowledge, as in that blind man who lov'd a La<U+017F>s whom he had never <U+017F>een; as al<U+017F>o in <hi>Petrarch</hi> who made <U+017F>o many Ver<U+017F>es upon his <hi>Lawra,</hi> whom he could never behold; The cau<U+017F>e
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66371:59"/>
whereof I <U+017F>hould attribute to the power of the Imagination, which fancies <U+017F>omthing of loveline<U+017F>s where there is none; or el<U+017F>e to the <U+017F>ole action of the Will, which not able to remain neuter between love and hatred (<U+017F>ince its action is to will, and to will is to love) when it meets no cau<U+017F>e of hatred in an object, loves it; and hates it, when it finds nothing amiable therein. For if you a<U+017F><U+017F>ign the rea<U+017F>on of this love to the tran<U+017F>piration of Spirits i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the lov'd per<U+017F>on's body, their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is too volatile to act <U+017F>o far off; and their i<U+017F><U+017F>uing being never alike, (becau<U+017F>e the pores of the <U+017F>kin are more <U+017F>topt at one time then at another) this love would be remarkably alter'd every moment. Be<U+017F>ides, we many times love by an inclination an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent per<U+017F>on for his merit; and many have been enamour'd of Beauties at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight of their Pictures; but love was never produc'd between two blind per<U+017F>ons, notwith<U+017F>tanding any emi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ympathetical Spirits. Moreover, 'tis the Species and not the Spirits that are receiv'd by our Sen<U+017F>es; and <U+017F>o none <U+017F>hould ever love tho<U+017F>e they had not <U+017F>een, but by a Pro<U+017F>pective-gla<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That it imports not much to the cau<U+017F>ing of love, whether the object be really or only imaginarily good; and indeed our minds <U+017F>eem to intere<U+017F>s them<U+017F>elves more in the pur<U+017F>ute and pre<U+017F>ervation of the latter then the former, which maintains it <U+017F>elf by its proper worth. Wherefore if Love of Inclination pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e goodne<U+017F>s in the object, the <U+017F>ame mu<U+017F>t be apprehended either by the Imagination or by <U+017F>ome other Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to which it mu<U+017F>t therefore be approximated either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by it <U+017F>elf, or by it <U+017F>elf. So the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of Honey makes it <U+017F>elf perceptible to the Tongue by it <U+017F>elf: but the proportion of a fair countenance cannot make it <U+017F>elf known but by its <U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which is the picture and repre<U+017F>entation of it. This way, is produc'd the Love of Inclination as well as that of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; only with this difference, that the Species which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the former, act imperceptibly, and more <U+017F>uddenly then tho<U+017F>e that produce the latter, which is more deliberate and rational.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, There are but two <U+017F>orts of Love; one, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and Metaphorical; the other, proper and formal. That precedes Knowledg, and is an In<U+017F>tinct inclining natural things to their proper good: This follows Knowledg as its guide, and is the fir<U+017F>t Expan<U+017F>ion of the Heart, plea<U+017F>ing it <U+017F>elf with the good it likes. And as that is diffus'd over all Creatures, <U+017F>o this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>train'd only to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and rational. The Appetite, whence the former proceeds, is immers'd and incorporated in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every thing, and not di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd from the faculties and powers they have to act. But the latter, ari<U+017F>eth from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite properly <U+017F>o call'd, who<U+017F>e functions or motions are the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, to which as many acts corre<U+017F>pond in the Rational Appetite. The Que<U+017F>tion cannot be concerning that improper
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66371:59"/>
Appetite; for then Stones <U+017F>hould have Love, as well as In<U+017F>tinct, towards their Centre; but of the true and proper Love <U+017F>ub<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to Knowledg, which gives Amability to good, as Light doth Vi<U+017F>ibility to colours. Wherefore they who talk of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Spirits i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the lov'd per<U+017F>on's body into the eyes of the Lover, and <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ing upon the heart, without falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der knowledge, <U+017F>eem ignorant of the nature of Love. For <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uch <U+017F>pirits arrive at the heart without being ob<U+017F>erv'd; yet they mu<U+017F>t come out thence again to be known before they can cau<U+017F>e Love; as we cannot know any thing that is in the <U+017F>oul, unle<U+017F>s it come fir<U+017F>t out thence and become <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible; <U+017F>ince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is in the Under<U+017F>tanding but what pa<U+017F>s'd through the Sen<U+017F>e. So a man cannot know his own face but by reflection from a Looking-gla<U+017F>s without him. For the Soul at our Nativity is like a <U+017F>mooth table or white-<U+017F>heet of Paper, and thence its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive notions during this pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>tate is by Phanta<U+017F>ms <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us by our Sen<U+017F>es. Now the e<U+017F><U+017F>ential rea<U+017F>on of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance which keeps Love <U+017F>ubject to Knowledg, is, that the Appetite, which is the Principle of Love, is only a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion or Propriety of the thing wherein it is; but the Principle of Knowledge is an e<U+017F><U+017F>ential degree of Nature. Hence, Souls are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd by Cognition, not by Appetite: we call the Sen<U+017F>itive Soul, <U+017F>o, from the knowledg of Sen<U+017F>e, which con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes its e<U+017F><U+017F>ential difference; and the Rational Soul <U+017F>o, becau<U+017F>e Rea<U+017F>on, the principle of Knowledg is a degree of Nature: but Appetite is a propriety which follows it. And being there is the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on of Actions and their Principles; as the Appetite <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es a principle of Knowledg, <U+017F>o Love, which is the action of the Appetite, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es actual and clear Knowledg. Hence, there is no love without knowledg. For that we have more phan<U+017F>ie to the one of two per<U+017F>ons playing then to the other, 'tis becau<U+017F>e we di<U+017F>cern <U+017F>omthing in his face, ge<U+017F>tures, or motion that plea<U+017F>es us better. Sympathy (pretended the cau<U+017F>e of this love) may indeed be the foundation of it; ina<U+017F>much as we naturally love tho<U+017F>e like our <U+017F>elves; but it can never make us love till we have found in the thing <U+017F>ome <hi>Je-ne-<U+017F>cay-quoy</hi> of lovely. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the <U+017F>ole cau<U+017F>e of our love, <U+017F>ince 'tis of it <U+017F>elf impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our knowledg, and con<U+017F>equently cannot produce love till the effects of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ympathy, to wit, <U+017F>uch an Air, <U+017F>uch a Motion, and <U+017F>uch a Deportment have pleas'd us. And whereas 'tis <U+017F>aid that from eyes which behold us attentively we perceive <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing come forth that animates us; I an<U+017F>wer, that oftentimes quick fix'd and <U+017F>weet intuitions are tokens of love, from which 'tis no wonder if ours take ri<U+017F>e and growth, as from its proper cau<U+017F>e; <U+017F>ince Love begets Love.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXX. How the <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nder<U+017F>tanding moves the Will.</head>
            <p>'TIs proper to the Under<U+017F>tanding not only to conjoyn things wholly different, but oftentimes to ab<U+017F>tract and <U+017F>eparate <U+017F>uch as are perfectly united in one and the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, and differ only in accidents, which it <U+017F>evers from their <U+017F>ubjects. Hence reflecting upon it <U+017F>elf, it di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hes in its operation two Faculties, to wit, its Cognition and the Rea<U+017F>onable Appetite or Will, although they are one and the <U+017F>ame thing, not only in the Soul, who<U+017F>e e<U+017F><U+017F>ence is <U+017F>imple, but al<U+017F>o in the Intellect; nor are their objects different, Truth, the object of the Under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being convertible and all one with Good, the object of the Will. Hence Civilians acknowledg no Will in tho<U+017F>e that want Under<U+017F>tanding, as Ideots and Children. And as the <U+017F>ame Sun-beam that produces light, cau<U+017F>es heat too by the continuation of its action, or by its re-union in a Burning-gla<U+017F>s: <U+017F>o an object long con<U+017F>ider'd or <U+017F>trongly apprehended by the Under<U+017F>tanding as good, immediately incites and inflames the <U+017F>ame to <U+017F>eek and de<U+017F>ire it. So that the cognition of a thing in the Under<U+017F>tanding is only Theory, which the Will, applying it <U+017F>elf thereunto by de<U+017F>ire, reduces into Practice. As the Theorical habit of an Art differs not from the Practical, and the conclu<U+017F>ion of a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>m is only a dependance upon its two Premi<U+017F><U+017F>es. Wherefore the Will, which is the practice of the Under<U+017F>tandings <U+017F>peculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a re<U+017F>ult of its ratiocination, is not di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd from the Under<U+017F>tanding; and to know good, to de<U+017F>ire and <U+017F>eek means to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s it, are operations continu'd by one <U+017F>ole moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Be<U+017F>ides, to <U+017F>eparate the actions of the Souls faculties, and make them independent one of another, would infer a kind of divi<U+017F>ibility in the Soul: but the Will being only a de<U+017F>ire, every de<U+017F>ire a <U+017F>pecies of motion, and motion an accident; it is <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from its <U+017F>ubject, the Under<U+017F>tanding, whereof 'tis only an affection and propiety. So that the Intellect and the Will being the <U+017F>ame thing, when the former is carried towards an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended good, we <U+017F>ay it moves the Will, as it doth the other powers which it employs in que<U+017F>t of that good, when the <U+017F>ame is external and it cannot attain to it by it <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That to know, to will, and to be able, although of the <U+017F>ame extent in things purely natural (as in a Stone, who<U+017F>e knowledge, de<U+017F>ire, and power to tend to its centre are the <U+017F>ame thing) yet are different actions in rational agents. For oftentimes we know without willing, and will what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do; and <U+017F>ometimes we know not that which we would: Oftentimes we will things not only without, but even again<U+017F>t Rea<U+017F>on; witne<U+017F>s the irregular Appetite of breeding Women
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66371:60"/>
and Green-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s Maids. Wherefore the<U+017F>e actions being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, the Faculties from which they proceed, the Intellect, Will and Motive Faculty, mu<U+017F>t be wholly di<U+017F>tinct; <U+017F>eeing their two adequate Objects, which <U+017F>pecifie Faculties, are con<U+017F>ider'd under divers formal Rea<U+017F>ons, which are the <U+017F>ole Cau<U+017F>es of the di<U+017F>tinction of Faculties. For Entity immaterial and <U+017F>piritual, is, as true and intelligible, the object of the Under<U+017F>tanding; but, as good and de<U+017F>irable, 'tis the object of the Will: which are two wholly different formal Rea<U+017F>ons. Now though the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect and the Will are two different Faculties, yet there is <U+017F>uch a dependance between them that the one can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, and they communicate mutual a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance: the Under<U+017F>tanding <U+017F>upplies Rea<U+017F>ons and Coun<U+017F>els, which the Will cau<U+017F>es the Powers under its dominion to execute: for 'tis a blind Queen, having no knowledg of her own but only what light <U+017F>he receives from the Intellect. But how can it <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>ame, if blind, as 'tis fancied? We an<U+017F>wer, that as all things have a bent and natural inclination to their proper good, though they know it not (as even the Intellect a<U+017F><U+017F>ents to a truth known by ratiocination, but knows not why it a<U+017F><U+017F>ents to a fir<U+017F>t Principle, as, That the whole is greater then its part, and that 2 and 1 make 3; the<U+017F>e being connate Notions) <U+017F>o the Will is carried to the Good propos'd to it by the Under<U+017F>tanding, becau<U+017F>e the goodne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>utablene<U+017F>s thereof engage it to endeavours of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it, wherein its <U+017F>upream Felicity lyes.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Since the Will is a de<U+017F>ire, every de<U+017F>ire a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and every motion from <U+017F>ome other (nothing moving it <U+017F>elf); the Will cannot de<U+017F>ire unle<U+017F>s mov'd by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uperior power and knowledg: For as there is no de<U+017F>ire without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, <U+017F>o, to the end this may not be idle and unprofitable, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath joyn'd an Appetite to it; to wit, a Sen<U+017F>itive Appetite to the knowledg of a Sen<U+017F>ible Good apprehended <U+017F>uch by the Imagination, which is common to Men and Brutes; and a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Appetite (the Will) to the knowledg of an hone<U+017F>t Good apprehended <U+017F>uch by the Under<U+017F>tanding. And whereas imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things cannot be known by them<U+017F>elves but by <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and corporeal, we cannot better judge of the manner whereby the Intellect moves the Will, then by that whereby the Imagination moves the Sen<U+017F>itive Appetite; which is the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of the Object, who<U+017F>e Species being receiv'd by <U+017F>ome one of the outward Sen<U+017F>es, and carried from the Common <U+017F>en<U+017F>e to the Phan<U+017F>ie which reli<U+017F>hes the <U+017F>ame to the full, is then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Sen<U+017F>itive Appetite, which pre<U+017F>ently flyes to it, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes <U+017F>o impetuou<U+017F>ly as that it hurries the Rea<U+017F>on and the Will along with it <U+017F>elf, and con<U+017F>trains them to yield to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of tho<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions which it excites to joyn with it in pur<U+017F>uit of that good, and which itre doubles upon the occurrence of any ob<U+017F>tacle to its de<U+017F>igns. In like <U+017F>ort the Will is carried of it <U+017F>elf to a vertuous action, when the Under<U+017F>tanding repre<U+017F>ents the hone<U+017F>ty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66371:61"/>
of the <U+017F>ame to it; provided it be not otherwi<U+017F>e prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd, and the <U+017F>aid action be not accompani'd with difficulties and thorns, as commonly happens; for then that Sen<U+017F>itive Appetite often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gets the better of Rea<U+017F>on; the Fle<U+017F>h, of the Spirit. There is this difference between the motions of the Will and the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, that the latter nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follows the duct of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which 'tis inclin'd in<U+017F>pite of it <U+017F>elf towards a Delectable Good; but the Will (common to us with Angels) is <U+017F>o mov'd by the Intellect, that neverthele<U+017F>s it always remains mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of its own actions, and can do either good or evil by vertue of its liberty, which alone di<U+017F>criminates Man from Bea<U+017F>t, and gives him right of empire and command, (which the Civilians define, a power of making u<U+017F>e of any thing at one's plea<U+017F>ure;) and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which not only Judgments, Vertues, Vices, Rewards and Puni<U+017F>hments, Prai<U+017F>es and Di<U+017F>prai<U+017F>es, Con<U+017F>ultations and Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations would be u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s; but al<U+017F>o all Laws would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e, Man would be in wor<U+017F>e condition then Brutes, over whom he hath no other advantage but that of Rea<U+017F>on; which would <U+017F>erve for nothing if he acted things nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily, as other Agents do, and not freely and voluntarily.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, He had always accounted it a vain enquiry, how the Under<U+017F>tanding moves the Will; and the Sen<U+017F>es, the Sen<U+017F>itive Appetite towards their Objects; becau<U+017F>e the Cogno<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citive Faculty, and the<U+017F>e Appetites being really di<U+017F>tinct and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing common, there cannot intervene any commerce between them. They are Officers that have <U+017F>evered charges, without having any thing to <U+017F>hare or di<U+017F>patch together. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s it being true that we love nothing but what is fir<U+017F>t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and judg'd amiable, we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>eek this dependance <U+017F>omwhat higher. Now all actions are of the whole Compo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; and con<U+017F>equently Man, who is the whole, is he who by his knowledg either of Sen<U+017F>e or of the Intellect, judges what both the one and the other Appetite ought to embrace or reject. Then after he hath pa<U+017F>s'd his judgment by his Cogno<U+017F>citive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, he determines him<U+017F>elf to follow by his Appetite what he hath judg'd fit to be done; in con<U+017F>equence whereof he applies his Motive Faculty to the execution of his Re<U+017F>olution. So that 'tis Man that moves him<U+017F>elf by his Will towards Good or Evil, to pur<U+017F>ue or avoid, after he hath con<U+017F>ider'd what he ought to will, how, and in what <U+017F>ort to comport him<U+017F>elf. By this means we obviate a world of difficulties ari<U+017F>ing from this Que<U+017F>tion, and re<U+017F>olve many; as, among<U+017F>t others, How the Under<U+017F>tanding comes to illuminate corporeal phanta<U+017F>ms, without e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing an <hi>Intellectus Agens</hi> for that purpo<U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e office is pretended to <U+017F>ublime tho<U+017F>e phanta<U+017F>ms by denudating them of their <U+017F>ingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and materiality, that <U+017F>o they may become actually intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible and proportionate to the Intellect. For, be<U+017F>ides that 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to conceive how any <U+017F>piritual light can fall from the Intellect upon a corporeal phanta<U+017F>m; (that which is corporeal
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66371:61"/>
being incapable of receiving any thing <U+017F>piritual, and the Intellect of producing any thing out of it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince all its actions are imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent:) we are deliver'd from all this trouble by <U+017F>aying, that in the <U+017F>tate of this pre<U+017F>ent life Man by his outward and inward Sen<U+017F>es takes in as much knowledg of things as they can give him, and afterwards by his Under<U+017F>tanding deduces and infers things which the phanta<U+017F>ms alone could not acquaint him with. Thus when a phanta<U+017F>m repre<U+017F>ents to him a thing which his eye beholds afar off, he by his Under<U+017F>tanding judges the <U+017F>ame a Sub<U+017F>tance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the phanta<U+017F>m <U+017F>hews him that it <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of it <U+017F>elf; if he <U+017F>ee it walk, he judges it alive; So that 'tis <U+017F>ufficient to the drawing of all his Con<U+017F>equences that he infer from the phanta<U+017F>ms what they are capable to repre<U+017F>ent to him, without need of <U+017F>piritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing them, or of commerce between them and the Intellect. In like manner, 'tis not needful that the Intellect <U+017F>hew the Will its Object; but the man's <U+017F>eeing it, is <U+017F>ufficient to cau<U+017F>e him to move him<U+017F>elf by his Will towards the Good which he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends. For as a King hath his Scouts to di<U+017F>cover the <U+017F>tate of his Enemies, upon who<U+017F>e report he holds a Council of War, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he re<U+017F>olves what is to be done. So Man by his Sen<U+017F>es di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the nature of Objects, as by <U+017F>o many Spies, which make their report to the Imagination; after which the Under<U+017F>tanding judges of the <U+017F>ame; and la<U+017F>tly, the Man re<U+017F>olves and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines by his Will. Thus 'tis the Man that makes all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F>s, employing all his Faculties diver<U+017F>ly for that purpo<U+017F>e. And as 'twere impertinent to a<U+017F>k how the Scouts and Council of War acted and mov'd the Troops which execute the General's re<U+017F>olution to make them fight; but it <U+017F>uffices to <U+017F>ay, That 'tis his Order: So 'tis ab<U+017F>urd to inquire how the Sen<U+017F>es or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding move the Appetite or the Will; 'tis <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>ay, That a Man re<U+017F>olves to will<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> after cogni<U+017F>ance of the matter.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That that which moves the Will, is <U+017F>omething divine and more excellent then Rea<U+017F>on, namely, that part of the Intellect, which is the knowledg of Fir<U+017F>t Principles, and is to the Soul what <U+017F>he is to the Body which <U+017F>he informs. This appears in all the Will's actions; whereof tho<U+017F>e that tend to the End are, to Will, to De<U+017F>ire, to Enjoy, when the <U+017F>aid End is a Good, and is either ab<U+017F>ent or pre<U+017F>ent; not to Will, to Flee, to be Sad, when the <U+017F>aid End is an Evil, and that con<U+017F>ider'd too either as ab<U+017F>ent or pre<U+017F>ent: tho<U+017F>e which re<U+017F>pect the means lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <U+017F>uch End are, To Chu<U+017F>e, to Con<U+017F>ent, and to Employ <U+017F>ome rather then others. All which actions it cannot exert of it <U+017F>elf, but being mov'd by that divine power of the Intellect which repre<U+017F>ents to it the goodne<U+017F>s of the End, and the <U+017F>utable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the Means for attaining the <U+017F>ame: in like manner as the End moves the efficient Cau<U+017F>e, attracting it to its pro<U+017F>ecution by an improper and metaphorical Motion.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, As the Will is mov'd by the Intellect, <U+017F>o is the Intellect mov'd reciprocally by the Will, which commands
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66371:62"/>
it to divide, define, ab<U+017F>tract and perform its operations in <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch manner. Yea, there is no Faculty but is <U+017F>ubject to its empire. It commands the Imagination to frame Idea's and Species; the Memory, to recall and repre<U+017F>ent them; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty, to <U+017F>peak, walk, and the like other actions; the Sen<U+017F>itive Appetite, to love, hate, be angry, to rai<U+017F>e and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea<U+017F>e its pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions; though many times the<U+017F>e are deaf to its dictats.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <U+017F>aid, Since the Rational Soul is a <U+017F>imple Form, and every Form a perfection of the <U+017F>ubject wherein it re<U+017F>ides; that of Man being to know Truth, to love Good, and to be united to both by Fruition: the <U+017F>ame Soul when it knows, is call'd the Intellect; when it de<U+017F>ires or loves the thing known, the Will. So that there is no need for the one to be mov'd by the other; for 'tis the Soul that moves it <U+017F>elf, which therefore <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> calls <hi>Entelechia,</hi> and the Principle of motion; the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans, a Self-moving number.</p>
            <p>The Eighth <U+017F>aid, That the Will depends not any way on the Intellect, and con<U+017F>equently is not mov'd by it. Which is prov'd, fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e the Will is mutable and oftimes contrary, upon the <U+017F>ame ratiocination; as it would not be, if it were mov'd by the Under<U+017F>tanding. For if the Will were, according to <hi>Ari<U+017F>totles</hi> definition, a de<U+017F>ire of good with rea<U+017F>on, the one ought always to follow the other. But it not doing <U+017F>o, 'tis an argument, that the Will hath another principle then the ratiocination. In the <U+017F>econd place, as it was lately argu'd, there are amities of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, properly <U+017F>o call'd, becau<U+017F>e not grounded upon any Rea<U+017F>on; and therefore the Will, which never exerci<U+017F>es its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion more freely then in Love, follows not the Intellect in that kind of amities, and con<U+017F>equently is not mov'd by it. Thirdly, whatever the Civilians <U+017F>ay, Fools and Children have their Wills, as well as the Wi<U+017F>er and Elder; yea both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Will, as re<U+017F>olvedly as the latter: and Women, who we <U+017F>ay have le<U+017F>s judgment then Men, are yet more <U+017F>elf-will'd and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinate then they. On the contrary, the mo<U+017F>t judicious are commonly the lea<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olute, and find mo<U+017F>t difficulties in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. An Emperick and ignorant Phy<U+017F>ician will be bolder and re<U+017F>olve things more pertinaciou<U+017F>ly then an old experienc'd Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodi<U+017F>t. A young and giddy Captain will <U+017F>ooner tell his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of his Will, then an old beaten Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier who doubts of every thing, and labours much to bring him<U+017F>elf to a re<U+017F>olution. But the contrary would happen, if the Will follow'd the Duct of the Judgment. Wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive rather that the Will moves the Under<U+017F>tanding as well as all the other Faculties; <U+017F>ince no body can rea<U+017F>on in<U+017F>pite of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, but he mu<U+017F>t will to <U+017F>et his Mind upon a thing before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect can make its reviews.</p>
            <p>The Ninth <U+017F>aid, The be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e was, rather to <U+017F>alve the Opinions of the School by <U+017F>ome Expedient, then wholly to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66371:62"/>
depart from them, as a way too difficult to keep; and that he conceiv'd it better to untye the Gordian knot then to cut it; which belongs only to <hi>Alexander.</hi> 'Tis acknowledg'd that the Intellect and the Will are two Faculties of the Rational Soul; that we will nothing unle<U+017F>s the judgment believe it good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be really or only apparently <U+017F>uch. But the difficulty is concerning the means that the Intellect employs to carry the Will to <U+017F>uch good. Take it thus: The Will is carri'd of it <U+017F>elf to good, as a Stone to the Centre; but as this Stone is <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hinder'd from arriving thereunto by ob<U+017F>tacles which <U+017F>tay it; <U+017F>o Ignorance puts a bar to the Will. Hereupon the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding falls to work till it have remov'd that ob<U+017F>tacle by its rea<U+017F>oning: Which done, as there is nothing between the end of a <U+017F>hadow, and the beginning of light; <U+017F>o there is nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the end of our ignorance, and the beginning of our voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: where the operation of the Under<U+017F>tanding ends, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that of the Will, no more induc'd, mov'd, and as little forc'd as the weight that tends downwards, which cannot be <U+017F>aid carri'd towards the Centre, unle<U+017F>s improperly, by him that takes away the piece of wood or other ob<U+017F>tacle that <U+017F>top'd it in the Air. Moreover, it were no longer a Will, if mov'd by any other principle but it <U+017F>elf. As is <U+017F>een in tho<U+017F>e who having a will to do <U+017F>omthing, when the <U+017F>ame is once commanded them, change their re<U+017F>olution, or do only with regret what before they de<U+017F>ir'd with pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: as the <U+017F>ame motion which was natural to the Stone, becomes violent to it when it is impell'd, in<U+017F>tead of being <U+017F>uffer'd to de<U+017F>cend downwards.</p>

            <p>AS the Degrees of Life have dominion over the Fir<U+017F>t Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <U+017F>o they have authority one over another, each in his order. The Vegetative life in Man makes u<U+017F>e of the Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Qualities at plea<U+017F>ure, even to the prejudice of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So, Heat congregates things of the <U+017F>ame, and <U+017F>eparates tho<U+017F>e of different Nature; but our Vegetative Soul makes it do the contrary, namely, Unite the Four Humours in the Veins though different in nature, in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>egregating them: for in this Ca<U+017F>e, Heat acts not with full authority but as the Soul's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, following her intentions. And the rea<U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e four Humours being ingredients into the Nativity of Man, they mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily pa<U+017F>s into his nouri<U+017F>hment; which they cannot do without being mingled together. But when the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66371:63"/>
Blood is out of the Veins; then the Heat, di<U+017F>engag'd from the Soul's juri<U+017F>diction, di<U+017F>gregates and <U+017F>eparates all four, making the Choler float uppermo<U+017F>t, the Phlegm next, then the Blood, and lowe<U+017F>t of all, Melancholy, as the dregs. Among<U+017F>t Souls there is the <U+017F>ame order of Superiority. The Sen<U+017F>itive makes the Vegetative obey it; as appears by this, that if after meat the Imagination attend much to an object, the Concoction of the Food is retarded, becau<U+017F>e all the Faculties of the Soul being united in their Root and E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Soul, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>ets her <U+017F>elf much upon one object, <U+017F>he leaves the other inferiour powers idle; they not being able to work but as the Soul, (their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) employs them. Now this premis'd, I <U+017F>ay, when a breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Woman hath a longing for any thing, this de<U+017F>ir'd thing is imprinted <U+017F>trongly in the Phancy; and this imprinting being made in the Brain, the Spirits which flow from thence, carry a copy thereof with them. For as an intire Looking-gla<U+017F>s repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ents but one Image, but every piece of a broaken one hath its whole Pourtrait: becau<U+017F>e the Intentional Species or Images of things, though divi<U+017F>ible by rea<U+017F>on of their <U+017F>ubject, are yet in them<U+017F>elves formally indivi<U+017F>ible, being Forms without Matter, and con<U+017F>equently indivi<U+017F>ible; Divi<U+017F>ion proceeding from Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, a concomitant of Matter: So tho<U+017F>e Spirits which <U+017F>tream from the Brain, though they leave there the image of the de<U+017F>ir'd thing, yet withall they carry the <U+017F>ame image with them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing portions of the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance wherein it is engraven; and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the place where the <hi>Foetus</hi> is form'd, by rea<U+017F>on of the union of its Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els with tho<U+017F>e of the Mother, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Infant and imprint the Characters, they bring, upon it: the Vegetative and Pla<U+017F>tick or Formative Vertue <U+017F>uffering it <U+017F>elf to be over-rul'd by the Sen<U+017F>itive, as this is by the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and this again by the other <U+017F>uperiour powers. When the teeming Woman touching her <U+017F>elf in any part, the Spirits run thither from the Brain, either by rea<U+017F>on of the touch or the motion (both depending upon the Animal Spirits) but finding the Mother's fle<U+017F>h too hard and di<U+017F>proportinate to their effect, and mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing their blow, they go to give it upon the tenderer fle<U+017F>h of the Child. And as in Generation, the Spirits of all the parts of the Body accur to the place where the Seed is receiv'd, there to engrave the Characters of the parts whence they flow, which afterwards <U+017F>erve for the Formative Vertue, every one having his ta<U+017F>k to make the part from which it i<U+017F><U+017F>u'd: <U+017F>o the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Spirits keep the <U+017F>ame cour<U+017F>e and rule towards the <hi>Embryo,</hi> <U+017F>o that tho<U+017F>e which <U+017F>erv'd to the Mother's touch, go to find that <U+017F>ame place in the Child's Body, there to mark the Image which they brought from the Brain; Nature finding ways for her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention where none appear.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, The impotence of that Sex and their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of Mind, (evidenc'd by the violence of all their Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which know no mediocrity) is one of the principal cau<U+017F>es of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66371:63"/>
the impetuo<U+017F>ity of their de<U+017F>ires. Now the Species of the thing de<U+017F>ir'd being in the Imagination, it excites the Appetite which de<U+017F>ir'd it; this the motive Faculty, which employs the Animal Spirits to execute the commands of the Faculties by whom it is <U+017F>et on work. And as the Vertues and Images of things gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated here below by the heat and influence of the Stars, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the Air which con<U+017F>igns them to the Earth; <U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e Spirits receive the Species and Images whereof the brain is full; and being directed by the Imagination to the Womb (which hath great communication with the Brain by means of the nerves of the <U+017F>ixt Pair, as appears by the effects of Odors upon that part) there they retrace and imprint upon the Child the Images wherewith they are laden. For, if it be true that the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can act beyond its Subject, as E<U+017F>triches and Tortoi<U+017F>es are <U+017F>aid to hatch their Eggs with their Eyes, and that Hens hatch Chickens of the colour of <U+017F>uch cloths as are laid before them while<U+017F>t they are <U+017F>itting; much more may the Imagination of a Woman repre<U+017F>ent upon the tender Fruit in her womb the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of things which <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ires: and this is no more <U+017F>trange than the common ob<U+017F>ervation, of People falling <U+017F>ick, and recovering again, meerly by Fancy.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the images of things de<U+017F>ired are, in the Spirits, ju<U+017F>t as tho<U+017F>e of <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible objects are in the Air, which is full of them. But as the<U+017F>e, that they may be <U+017F>een, mu<U+017F>t be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by a <U+017F>mooth and opake body; <U+017F>o, that tho<U+017F>e which are in the <U+017F>pirits may be expre<U+017F><U+017F>'d, they mu<U+017F>t be terminated by a <U+017F>oft, tender, and capable body, as a child's is in the fir<U+017F>t months of his conformation, during which alone he is <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of the<U+017F>e impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which are only of things edible and potable; being the Child, then endu'd only with <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive Life, cannot be affected but by things <U+017F>erving to the Animal Life, as aliments are, which (be<U+017F>ides) are ordinarily and mo<U+017F>t ardently de<U+017F>ir'd by breeding Women; tho<U+017F>e that long for chalk, coals, and other impurities being unhealthy and di<U+017F>temper'd. Now to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why the Grapes, Mulberries, Strawberries, Goo<U+017F>e-berries, and other Fruits delineated upon our bodies, ripen and change colour at the <U+017F>ame time as the true fruits upon the earth do, I <U+017F>hall not recurr to the Stars, or Tali<U+017F>manical Figures, but more probably to that Univer<U+017F>al Spirit which cau<U+017F>eth the <U+017F>ame fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in the <U+017F>pirits of our bodies as in Wine and the Vine when it is in its <U+017F>ap and flower; and in Pork or Veni<U+017F>on when Hogs and Deer are <U+017F>alt, mezled, or go to rut.</p>
            <p>The fourth <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e Marks adhere to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Families. So the family of <hi>Seleucus</hi> had an Anchor upon the thigh; in <hi>Greece</hi> <U+017F>ome were di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd by a Lance, a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>h, a Star, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which marks, as Warts and Moles, proceed from the Formative Vertue in the <U+017F>eed, which containing the Idea of all the parts, expre<U+017F><U+017F>es them to the life in the child.

upon the Imagination alone, which employs the <U+017F>pirits which are common both to the Mother and Child by the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and have the <U+017F>ame motions: <U+017F>o that when the Woman <U+017F>cratches her <U+017F>elf in any part of her body, the <U+017F>pirits having a like motion are carri'd towards that part, and at the <U+017F>ame time towards that corre<U+017F>pondent part in the child's body, who<U+017F>e tenderne<U+017F>s is alone <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of the image wherewith they are impregnated, and which is never to be removed, as being from the fir<U+017F>t conformation.</p>

As a certain Woman having <U+017F>een a Criminal broken upon the Wheel, brought forth a child that all the bones were broken. Hereunto al<U+017F>o contribute the exce<U+017F>s or defect of the Matter, its evil quality, and the deprav'd conformation of the Womb. But to attribute the communication requir'd for this effect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Imaginative and Formative Faculties to the Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, cannot hold; there being but one Vein, two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and the <hi>

Thus, for the imprinting of a Mark, the Formative Faculty being mov'd by the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath no need to receive any Species, as the Cogno<U+017F>citive Faculties have, of which number the Formative is not. Nor is it more <U+017F>trange, that the <hi>Foetus,</hi> indu'd with a particular <U+017F>oul, yet feels the effects of its Mothers Imagination, than that Fruits receive the changes and alterations of the Trees to which they adhere.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXII. Of the Original of Forms.</head>
            <p>A Form is that which gives either Being or Motion. When it gives only Motion, 'tis call'd an A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tent Form, as that which moves the Heavens: When Being, an Informant Form, <U+017F>tyl'd al<U+017F>o an Act, Perfection, E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, Vertue, Beauty. For what ever is excellent in a Subject, proceeds from the Form; which determining the Indifferency of the matter (of it <U+017F>elf imperfect) makes it to be one, that is to <U+017F>ay, not divided in it <U+017F>elf, and divided from every thing el<U+017F>e. Created Forms are either <U+017F>piritual or material; and both the<U+017F>e again either <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or accidental. Spiritual accidental Forms are, Vertue, Science, and all Habits of the Soul. Sub<U+017F>tantial <U+017F>piritual forms are Intelligences and Rational <U+017F>ouls. Material accidental forms are either <U+017F>imple, as Heat and Whitene<U+017F>s; or compounded, as Beauty and Health. Under Material <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantial Forms are comprehended Vegetative and <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive Souls, which are the Forms of Plants and Brutes, and the Subject now in hand; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I will not grant them to be Sub<U+017F>tances, but only Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. All agree that there are Forms, becau<U+017F>e there are Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e Powers. The<U+017F>e Powers are properties flowing from <U+017F>ome active principle which <U+017F>ets them on work; which the Matter, becau<U+017F>e purely pa<U+017F>sive, cannot do; and therefore it mu<U+017F>t be the Form. But the doubt is, whether this Form be <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantial or accidental; as, whether it be only a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of Heat, which makes Plants and Animals be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>ht, grow, generate, and move, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome Sub<U+017F>tance and Form more excellent that employs Heat as its In<U+017F>trument for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing tho<U+017F>e Actions. And this is mo<U+017F>t probable. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e, A Sub<U+017F>tance compounded of Matter and Form <U+017F>hould, contrary to the Maxim, be made of that which is not Sub<U+017F>tance, if Forms were only accidental. They are introduc'd into a capable Subject by an Univocal Agent, which by generation communicates a <U+017F>oul of the <U+017F>ame Nature with its own, which is material, and con<U+017F>equently divi<U+017F>ible; yet <U+017F>o divi<U+017F>ible as that it is not dimini<U+017F>hed in the traduction, no more than the Species of a Looking-gla<U+017F>s which produces it <U+017F>elf wholly and entirely in all bodies capable of it, or then the flame of a candle wherewith a thou<U+017F>and others may be lighted, without any diminution of its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, That Forms are primogenial Principles, no more generable than the Matter which they always accompany, and according to who<U+017F>e di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions they only change appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For 'tis not credible that Forms, the principal pieces of the world (without which it would be depriv'd of that from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66371:65"/>
which it bears its name, to wit, Ornament and Beauty) are <U+017F>ubject to continual corruption; otherwi<U+017F>e the world and the natures therein contain'd would have been chang'd in <U+017F>o long a time, and yet they remain <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame. Be<U+017F>ides, if Forms peri<U+017F>h, they mu<U+017F>t either be annihilated (but nothing is <U+017F>o in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) or el<U+017F>e re<U+017F>olv'd into that whereof they are compos'd, <U+017F>ince they are <U+017F>uppos'd material; and neverthele<U+017F>s we <U+017F>ee no remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them. 'Tis therefore always the <U+017F>ame form but diver<U+017F>ly dre<U+017F>s'd, and <U+017F>aid to be generated when it changes from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect to a perfect <U+017F>tate; and to be corrupted when it returns into a wor<U+017F>e condition then what is had before; both, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <U+017F>everal di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of its Subject.</p>
            <p>The third <U+017F>aid, That all natural Forms are nothing but Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, <U+017F>ince they are in matter as in a <U+017F>ubject, from which they are in<U+017F>eparable; and not as parts; for they are parts of the whole, but not of the Matter. The Forms of the Elements are the fir<U+017F>t Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And as all Mixts are compounded of the four Elements, <U+017F>o they derive their form (as well as their matter) from them, which follows the nature of the Element predominant in the Compound. Thus Drine<U+017F>s is the Form of a <U+017F>tone, which hath more of earth than of any other Element; Oyl is humid, becau<U+017F>e aerial; all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures are Hot, by rea<U+017F>on of Heat, the noble<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t active quality, which, attaining to the proportion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ite for performing the offices of life, is call'd a Soul; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is more or le<U+017F>s refin'd, and meets with different <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, 'tis called a Vegetative Soul in Plants, and a Sen<U+017F>itive <U+017F>oul in Brutes. I <U+017F>ay further, that the<U+017F>e Forms are nothing but Modes and Fa<U+017F>hions of Being. For as Water turn'd into Air, and this into Fire by rarefaction, or into Water by conden<U+017F>ation, are <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame, not differing but according as their parts are more or le<U+017F>s clo<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o as well Forms purely natural as other living Forms, are nothing but Modes and Fa<U+017F>hions of Being of the Elements, their Qualities, and the <U+017F>everal Mixtures from which tho<U+017F>e Forms re<U+017F>ult.</p>
            <p>The fourth <U+017F>aid, according to <hi>Anaxagoras</hi>'s opinion, That all things are in all, and con<U+017F>equently Forms in the Matter, out of who<U+017F>e bo<U+017F>om they are educ'd by Agents conjoyning things of the <U+017F>ame Nature, and <U+017F>eparating others. As Art (which imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Nature) makes not Wine, but only pre<U+017F><U+017F>es out that vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal juice which was before in the Grape; and out of Marble forms a Statue only by paring off what was <U+017F>uperfluous: <U+017F>o out of the Earth, Nature forms Plants, which are turn'd into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of Animals, who<U+017F>e bodies are again reduc'd into Earth.</p>
            <p>The fifth maintain'd the opinion of <hi>Albert</hi> the Great, who is for the Generation of things, which the preceding opinion over throws, holding nothing to be new generated; He <U+017F>aid, that Forms are indeed in the Matter, yet not entire and perfect, but only by halves and begun; according to their e<U+017F><U+017F>ence, not according to their exi<U+017F>tence, which they acquire by the Agents which educe things out of their cau<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:66371:65"/>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, If it were <U+017F>o, then there would be no <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tantial Generation, becau<U+017F>e Exi<U+017F>tence is nothing but a Manner of Being, adding nothing to E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, nor really di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd from it. Wherefore I embrace <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi>'s opinion, that Forms are in the Matter, but only <hi>potentially,</hi> and as the Matter is capable of them; ju<U+017F>t as Wax is potentially <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>'s Statue, becau<U+017F>e ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving that form. This he calls, to be drawn and educ'd out of the power or bo<U+017F>om of the Matter: which is not to be receiv'd in it, or to depend of its di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions, <U+017F>ince this belongs al<U+017F>o to the Rational <U+017F>oul, which is not receiv'd in the body till the previous di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions, nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for its reception, be introduc'd therein; but the Matter it <U+017F>elf concurrs, though in a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive way, not only to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elf, but al<U+017F>o to produce the Form, and con<U+017F>equently to pre<U+017F>erve it. Which is not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the Rational <U+017F>oul, who<U+017F>e Being depends not anywi<U+017F>e up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Matter.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <U+017F>aid, Matter, being a Principle purely pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive and incapable of all action, cannot produce any thing, much le<U+017F>s Forms, the noble<U+017F>t Entities in the world. 'Tis the principle of impotence and imperfection, and con<U+017F>equently the ugline<U+017F>s, deformity, contrary to the Form whereof it <U+017F>hould partake, if it contain'd the <U+017F>ame in power, as Wine and Pepper do Heat, which becomes actual and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible when reduc'd into act by our Natural Heat which loo<U+017F>ens it from the parts which confin'd it. Wherefore Forms come from without, namely, from Heaven and its noble<U+017F>t part the Sun, the Father of Forms, which are nothing but Beams of light deriv'd from him as their Fountain, who<U+017F>e heat and influences give motion and life; which is the abode of Heat in Humidity: not Elementary Heat; for then Ar<U+017F>enic, Sulphur, and other Mixts, abounding with this Heat, <U+017F>hould have life; but Serpents, Salamanders, Fi<U+017F>hes, Hemlock, Poppies, and other exce<U+017F>sively cold Plants and Animals, <U+017F>hould not. Moreover in whatever manner the Elements and their Qualities be mix'd, they are <U+017F>till Elements, and can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above their own Nature, which is, to calefie, refrigerate, attenuate, rarefie, conden<U+017F>e; but not the internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, the various motions and other actions of life, which can proceed only from a Cele<U+017F>tial Heat, <U+017F>uch as that is which pre<U+017F>erves a Plant amid<U+017F>t the rigours of Winter; who<U+017F>e coldne<U+017F>s would <U+017F>oon de<U+017F>troy the Plant's heat, if it were of the <U+017F>ame nature. Hence Vegetative and Sen<U+017F>itive Souls having no Contraries, becau<U+017F>e Contraries are plac'd under the <U+017F>ame Genus, (but the Cele<U+017F>tial matter whereof the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ouls are con<U+017F>tituted, and the Elements are not) therefore they are not corruptible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of other Mixts; but like light, cea<U+017F>e to exi<U+017F>t upon the ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions which maintain'd them. For, <U+017F>uch is the order of Nature, that when a Subject is po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t of all the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions requi<U+017F>ite for introduction of a Form, the Author of Nature, or (according to <hi>Plato</hi>) the Idea, or that

Soul of the World (which <hi>Avicenna</hi> held to be an Intelligence de<U+017F>tinated to the generation of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantial Forms) concurrs to the production of the Form, as al<U+017F>o this concour<U+017F>e cea<U+017F>es when tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions are aboli<U+017F>ht.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXIII. Whether Lean people are more healthy, and long-liv'd then Fat.</head>
            <p>THe Immortality of our <U+017F>ouls having an ab<U+017F>olute di<U+017F>po<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to length of Life, it depends only upon that of the Body, that we do not live Ages as our fir<U+017F>t Fathers did. For 'tis from <U+017F>ome defect in the<U+017F>e bodies that the differences of life even in Animals and Plants proceed; whence <U+017F>ome le<U+017F>s perfect <U+017F>ouls, (as tho<U+017F>e of Oaks) are yet more long-liv'd then tho<U+017F>e of Bea<U+017F>ts. The <U+017F>igns of long and <U+017F>hort life, are either <U+017F>imply <U+017F>uch, or al<U+017F>o cau<U+017F>es and effects. Such is the conformation of the parts of our body. A great number of Teeth is held a <U+017F>ign of longae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as well becau<U+017F>e 'tis an effect of the <U+017F>trength of the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty and Natural Heat, as that thereby the food is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ma<U+017F>ticated and prepar'd; and the other concoctions and functions more perfectly perform'd, whence comes health and long life. So al<U+017F>o the Habit of the body is not <U+017F>imply a <U+017F>ign, but likewi<U+017F>e an effect of health and cau<U+017F>e of long life; namely when the <U+017F>ame is moderate, that is, neither fat nor lean; which two, though compri<U+017F>able within the latitude of health, which admits a a great latitude, are yet <U+017F>o much le<U+017F>s perfect as they decline from that laudable di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition which is the rule and <U+017F>quare of all others. Now to make a ju<U+017F>t compari<U+017F>on, we mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider the Fat and the Lean in the <U+017F>ame degree of exce<U+017F>s or defect from this Mediocrity, and compare <hi>Philetas</hi> the Poet (who was <U+017F>o dry and lean that he was fain to fa<U+017F>ten leaden <U+017F>oles to his <U+017F>hoos for fear the wind <U+017F>hould carry him away) with <hi>Diony<U+017F>ius</hi> of <hi>Heraclea</hi> who was choakt with fat, unle<U+017F>s his body were continually be<U+017F>et with Leeches. Or el<U+017F>e we mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve in both an equality of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in the Principles of Life, to wit, the Radical Heat and Moi<U+017F>ture in the <U+017F>ame proportion, the <U+017F>ame age, under the <U+017F>ame climate, regiment, and exerci<U+017F>es; otherwi<U+017F>e the compari<U+017F>on will be unequal: and la<U+017F>tly, we mu<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the fle<U+017F>hy, great-limb'd, and mu<U+017F>culous from the fat. This premis'd, I am of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>'s Opinion, Aph. 44. Sect. 2. that <U+017F>uch as are gro<U+017F>s and fat naturally, die <U+017F>ooner then the lean and <U+017F>lender; becau<U+017F>e the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the latter, e<U+017F>pecially the Veins, are larger, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently fuller of Blood and Spirits, which are the Architects and principal Organs of Life: on the contrary, the Fat have <U+017F>maller Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els by rea<U+017F>on of their coldne<U+017F>s which con<U+017F>tringes

them; as is <U+017F>een in Women, Eunuchs, and Children, who<U+017F>e voices are therefore more <U+017F>hrill, and who have al<U+017F>o le<U+017F>s health and life.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Nature hath furni<U+017F>ht Animals with Fat, to the end to pre<U+017F>erve them from external injuries, and therefore the Lean, who are unprovided thereof, mu<U+017F>t be of <U+017F>horter life: for not many, be<U+017F>ides decrepit old people, die of a natural death; that is, proceeding from cau<U+017F>es within, whereas mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es ari<U+017F>e from external cau<U+017F>es, wherewith the Fat are le<U+017F>s incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded, e<U+017F>pecially with cold, the <U+017F>worn enemy of life; the <U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s of their pores, and the fat which environs them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all qualities contrary to life, and withall hindring the di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation of the Natural Heat, which becomes more vigorous by the confinement; ju<U+017F>t as the Bowels are hotter in Winter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the cold air hinders the efflux of the heat and <U+017F>pirits, caus'd in Summer, and in lean bodies, who<U+017F>e pores being more open, cannot retain tho<U+017F>e volatile <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances. So that, had the Fat le<U+017F>s heat, as they have not (for plenty of fat argues plenty of blood, the purer and more aiery part whereof di<U+017F>tilling like dew through the coats of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the Mu<U+017F>cles, when it comes to the Membranes, is by them condens'd into that whiti<U+017F>h <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance rather by their den<U+017F>ity and natural property then by their coldne<U+017F>s) yet this Heat being better di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd, and le<U+017F>s alter'd in the Fat then in the Lean, mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cau<U+017F>e fewer di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and la<U+017F>t longer.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Life is the continuance of Heat in Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not aqueous and excrementitious as that of fat people is, but oleaginous and aerial; and the longer this Heat <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts therein, the longer doth life la<U+017F>t. Now it continues longer in the Fat, who<U+017F>e more open pores let out the fuliginous excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rais'd by Heat; which in fat bodies, who<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages are <U+017F>topt by the coldne<U+017F>s or clammine<U+017F>s of pituitous humors, <U+017F>tag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and choke the heat, like fire that wants free tran<U+017F>piration, <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to life that it cannot <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t a moment without this action, whereby the <U+017F>oul attracts air in at all parts of the body, e<U+017F>pecially the mouth, for refre<U+017F>hing and ventilating the heat, and recruiting the <U+017F>pirits, and by the <U+017F>ame pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages emits the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligino<U+017F>ities nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily following all con<U+017F>umption of humidity by Heat. Which cau<U+017F>es of Death being internal and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary and inevitable; are much more con<U+017F>iderable then the external, whereto lean people are <U+017F>ubject, and which may be more ea<U+017F>ily avoided and remedied.</p>
            <p>The fourth <U+017F>aid, That Fat per<U+017F>ons have a more moderate and le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>uming heat, its activity being allay'd by the humidity of their Con<U+017F>titution; and therefore 'tis more durable than that of lean people, who<U+017F>e heat already violent of it <U+017F>elf is render'd more active by <U+017F>iccity, which is a <U+017F>pur to it. Hence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure fa<U+017F>ting with more trouble than the Fat, who<U+017F>e moi<U+017F>t <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance both moderates and feeds their heat, which appears to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66371:67"/>
the touch very gentle and temperate, as that of lean per<U+017F>ons is <U+017F>harp and pungent. Moreover, Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of Inanition, to which the lean are <U+017F>ubject, are more difficult to cure, than tho<U+017F>e of Repletion incident to the Fat. And old age which continually dries us up, is the tendency to Death, which is <U+017F>iccity it <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, Health being a Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which renders a man capable of performing the offices of life aright, and this di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in a due proportion of the fir<U+017F>t qualities, which makes a harmony and laudable temper of the four humors; the principal evidence thereof is a good <U+017F>tate and habit of the body call'd by the Phy<U+017F>icians <hi>Euexia</hi>; and that Extreme which comes neare<U+017F>t this, is the mo<U+017F>t healthy and fitte<U+017F>t for long life. The functions of life are Natural, Vital, and Animal; all which are better perform'd by the lean than the fat. Fir<U+017F>t, the Natural, which are Nutrition, Growth, and Generation; becau<U+017F>e the hotter fle<U+017F>h of the lean attracts more than that of the fat, which may indeed imbibe the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juices, but cannot perfectly concoct and a<U+017F><U+017F>imilate the <U+017F>ame for want of <U+017F>ufficient heat; whence they produce abundance of crude flegmatick excrements, which render them pale and bloated. For their more fatne<U+017F>s proceeds from want of heat to con<U+017F>ume <U+017F>uperfluities. Secondly, growth being an effect of heat, the Fat grow le<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e they are le<U+017F>s hot than the Lean. For heat rarefies, <U+017F>ubtili<U+017F>es, dilates, and make the parts mount up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as its defect makes the humors <U+017F>ettle downwards; hence women are never <U+017F>o tall as men, and their lower parts are gro<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>er; whereas the upper parts of men, as the head and brea<U+017F>t, are more large. Thirdly, the lean are more apt for generation, becau<U+017F>e their <U+017F>pirits are more refin'd, and their <U+017F>eed more concoct and plentiful than that of the fat; the pure<U+017F>t portion of who<U+017F>e blood is turn'd into fat in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>eed; whence all guelded Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals become fat; and, according to <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> fat women are for the mo<U+017F>t part barren, bear <U+017F>eldom; who al<U+017F>o, as well as men of the <U+017F>ame habit, are more inclin'd to love; but we are commonly mo<U+017F>t led to that which we perform be<U+017F>t. Then the Vital Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too, are more perfectly perform'd in the lean; as appears by their large re<U+017F>piration, their <U+017F>trong and great pul<U+017F>e, the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s in their motions and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. La<U+017F>tly, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o are the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, to wit, outward and inward <U+017F>en<U+017F>ation, by rea<U+017F>on of the purene<U+017F>s and <U+017F>ubtlety of their <U+017F>pirits, (which likewi<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es goodne<U+017F>s of wit) and of the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of their Organs, more purifi'd, and le<U+017F>s burden'd with clouds and excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midities, which render the fat more heavy both of mind and body.</p>

            <p>COnfidence being the fruit of Friend<U+017F>hip, yea, the <U+017F>weet bond wherewith this Virtue unites Hearts; it may <U+017F>eem we ought to have mo<U+017F>t in him that loves mo<U+017F>t perfectly, namely, he that hath oblig'd us. For as 'tis harder to give then to receive, becau<U+017F>e we cannot give without depriving our <U+017F>elves of what we enjoy, (which is contrary to our natural inclination) <U+017F>o it is a more virtuous action, and argues a greater kindne<U+017F>s: the receiver of a benefit finding no difficulty in this action of receiving it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we cannot doubt of his good will, who obliges us by his benefits; but we may of his, that receives. For it frequently happens to tho<U+017F>e that do good, as it did to the Sower in the Go<U+017F>pel, part of who<U+017F>e <U+017F>eed fell in <U+017F>tony places, part among<U+017F>t thorns, part in the high-way, and was devoured by birds; and the lea<U+017F>t part upon good ground, and brings not forth fruit but in its own time. Yea, there are many that hate nothing <U+017F>o much as the remembrance of tho<U+017F>e that have done them good, as if their pre<U+017F>ence were an Univer<U+017F>al Reproach, notwith<U+017F>tanding that a <U+017F>econd benefit revives the fir<U+017F>t, and a third or fourth cannot but mind them of the preceeding. But when you have obtain'd of them to remember it, yet many regret nothing more then to pay a debt, becau<U+017F>e con<U+017F>train'd thereto, either by Law or Duty; and Man being of his own Nature free, hates nothing <U+017F>o much as to do any thing by con<U+017F>traint. Hence, if he requites an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, 'tis not with that freene<U+017F>s and cheerfulne<U+017F>s which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite to good Offices, and becomes a Benefactor; in whom therefore we have more rea<U+017F>on to confide then in another.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, The little fidelity now in the world, even among<U+017F>t neare<U+017F>t Relatives, makes it rea<U+017F>onable to enquire, Who may be tru<U+017F>ted. And if the fear of Ingratitude, (the mo<U+017F>t vulgar crime, though in <U+017F>hew much dete<U+017F>ted by all the world) is the cau<U+017F>e why he who hath done good to another, yet dares not tru<U+017F>t him; the receiver thereof hath oftentimes no le<U+017F>s doubt of his Benefactor's intention. For though he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a <U+017F>eeming te<U+017F>timony of his kindne<U+017F>s, yet the motives of benefits proceeding <U+017F>ometimes from an other cau<U+017F>e be<U+017F>ides true Friend<U+017F>hip, <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion may as well ari<U+017F>e in the Receivers, as in the givers Mind. Many give onely that they may receive with U<U+017F>ury; others, out of vanity, and to make Creatures and Clients: which they regarding no longer but as their inferiors and dependents, 'tis as dangerous for the<U+017F>e to confide in their Benefactors, as for a <U+017F>lave to u<U+017F>e confidence towards his Ma<U+017F>ter, or a Va<U+017F><U+017F>al towards his Lord; not often allow'd by the re<U+017F>pect
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66371:68"/>
and timerou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the le<U+017F>s towards the great, as commonly tho<U+017F>e are that give: Whereas we ordinarily find in him whom we have oblig'd nothing but Subjection and Humility, Virtues much di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing the mind to Gratitude, which cannot but a<U+017F><U+017F>ure their Benefactors of their fidelity. Nor can they ea<U+017F>ily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful if they would, your confidence in them obliging them continually to fidelity, and, withall, giving them occa<U+017F>ion to requite your kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es by their a<U+017F><U+017F>iduity and <U+017F>ervices. Which was the recompence wherewith the poor among<U+017F>t the <hi>Jews</hi> pay'd their Creditors, by <U+017F>erving them for <U+017F>ome years. So that he is <U+017F>carce le<U+017F>s blameable who di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ts him whom he hath oblig'd, and by this diffidence deprives him of the means of requital, then he who having receiv'd a benefit betrayes his Benefactor; the Inju<U+017F>tice being almo<U+017F>t alike in both. If the fir<U+017F>t complains of having been deceiv'd by him whom he finds ungrateful; the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in whom his Benefactor puts not the confidence which he ought, will have no le<U+017F>s cau<U+017F>e of complaint that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he hath di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ted him, and <U+017F>oil'd the lu<U+017F>tre of the fir<U+017F>t Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation by his diffidence and bad opinion of him; which is to tax him<U+017F>elf of impudence for having done good to one unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That if Men were perfect, Communicative Ju<U+017F>tice would require of them that the receiver of a benefit <U+017F>hould repay the like, or at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome acknowledgment by his endeavours: Which the Poets intimated by the Graces, holding Hand in Hand. But the perver<U+017F>ity of Man is <U+017F>uch, that the more he is oblig'd to this Duty, the wor<U+017F>e he acquits him<U+017F>elf thereof, not doing any thing hand<U+017F>omely but what he does freely; and becau<U+017F>e being a vain-glorious Creature, he hates nothing <U+017F>o much as to be <U+017F>ubject, and to pay homage to him that hath done him good; who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ence <U+017F>eems to upbraid him with his own meane<U+017F>s. If he loves his Benefactor, 'tis with an intere<U+017F>s'd and mercenary affection; whereas that of the former is free from all <U+017F>elf-re<U+017F>pect, and proceeds meerly from a principle of Virtue, and con<U+017F>equently, is with more rea<U+017F>on to be rely'd upon. Moreover, a Work-man loves his Production more then he is lov'd by it: as al<U+017F>o God doth his Creatures; and Fathers, their Children. Now a Benefactor, who is a kind of Work-man and Artificer of our good Fortune, cheri<U+017F>hes and loves us as his work and creatures, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>eems concern'd for our pre<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ju<U+017F>t as Cau<U+017F>es are for that of their Effects, in which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves revive, and <U+017F>eem to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produc'd.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That our Natural Sentiments incline us more to rely upon tho<U+017F>e whom we have oblig'd, then upon tho<U+017F>e who have oblig'd us; not <U+017F>o much by way of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging a requital, (for Obligations are not to be done in hope of recompence; which would be exchange rather than kindne<U+017F>s) as becau<U+017F>e we are apt to tru<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t, whom we love mo<U+017F>t. But we love tho<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t, to whom we
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66371:68"/>
have given greate<U+017F>t Te<U+017F>timony of our Affections. A Man may be deceiv'd in reckoning his benefits as cau<U+017F>es of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the receiver; but, they are certain Effects and Signs of Affection in the be<U+017F>tower: So that in re<U+017F>pect of us, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>tly better to tru<U+017F>t him whom we have oblig'd, than him who hath oblig'd us. The <U+017F>ame is prov'd al<U+017F>o in re<U+017F>pect of him that is oblig'd; even the wild bea<U+017F>ts are tam'd, and, in<U+017F>tead of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, obey tho<U+017F>e that feed them; and therefore 'twere injurious to humanity, not to judge It capable of acknowledging a benefit which it knows how to conferr without provocation. For upon examination, the Cau<U+017F>es of Ingratitude will be found to ari<U+017F>e from tho<U+017F>e who boa<U+017F>t of the title of Benefactors; the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whereof is <U+017F>o great in <U+017F>ome, that they di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e more than oblige, by Pre<U+017F>ents un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably given, of no value, and (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Seneca</hi>'s advice) of little duration, intermixt with ill Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, in<U+017F>tead of being fenc'd with new to keep out the rain of the di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ts and coldne<U+017F><U+017F>es which de<U+017F>troy Friend<U+017F>hip; with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and not with a chearful Countenance; after denials and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, <U+017F>o that the thing <U+017F>eemes rather <U+017F>natch'd then receiv'd; dimini<U+017F>h'd by burthen<U+017F>ome conditions; and la<U+017F>tly, nullifi'd by reproaches, if not requited as <U+017F>oon as was expected. Whence <U+017F>uch pretended benefits de<U+017F>erve rather the name of Out-rages: And neverthele<U+017F>s, being there are many that are grateful, even for <U+017F>uch benefits, we may ju<U+017F>tly conclude that Courte<U+017F>ies done with their due circum<U+017F>tances, are far more capable to oblige the receivers to Gratitude, which cannot con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t with Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the Deci<U+017F>ion of this, as of all other Moral Que<U+017F>tions, depends upon per<U+017F>ons, times, places, and other circum<U+017F>tances whereupon Prudence is founded, which teaches when, how, and whom we are to tru<U+017F>t. Yet, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances alike, and two per<U+017F>ons equally virtuous, one of which hath done me good, and the other receiv'd good from me; the contrary Rea<U+017F>on of the Law, which pre<U+017F>umes him alwayes bad who hath been once bad, makes me judge, That he who hath once done me good, will <U+017F>ooner do me good again then another; and therefore that I ought rather to tru<U+017F>t him.</p>

But their Efficient is di<U+017F>tinct; that of Dew is the moderate Coldne<U+017F>s of the Night, whence 'tis mo<U+017F>t frequent in temperate Sea<U+017F>ons; that of a Fro<U+017F>t is Vehement Cold, whereby being fir<U+017F>t condens'd, it falls down in form of Cry<U+017F>tal: Yet Cold alone <U+017F>uffices not to produce Fro<U+017F>t; for then Water, which is cold in an eminent degree, <U+017F>hould be alwayes frozen. But <U+017F>ome terrene and gro<U+017F>s parts mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>erve for an uniting medium to compact the moi<U+017F>t parts of the Water or Vapour, which being naturally fluid, cannot be link'd together but by means of <U+017F>ome dry parts fixing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>training their fluidity.

The truth is, the Sun, who<U+017F>e ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and remotene<U+017F>s makes the diver<U+017F>ities of Sea<U+017F>ons accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different mutations which he cau<U+017F>es in the qualities of the Air, contribute thereunto, but the Earth helps too; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it alone; for we <U+017F>ee that the Snow on the Mountains which approach neare<U+017F>t Heaven, is la<U+017F>t melted. But the Sun's Rays piercing into the bo<U+017F>ome of the Earth, draw out that Fire which is inclos'd in its entralls; and becau<U+017F>e the Sun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves but a very little from the Aequinoctial Line, therefore that part of the Earth which an<U+017F>wers to that of Heaven where the Sun continually re<U+017F>ides, is alwayes Hot; and by a contrary Rea<U+017F>on, that under the Poles is alwayes extreamly cold: And
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66371:69"/>
even Country-people ob<U+017F>erve winds to be the Cau<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Effects; for tho<U+017F>e that blow from the North quarter, bring with them an extream cold Air, which is the cau<U+017F>e of Freezing; and tho<U+017F>e from the South bring on us an Air extreamly heated by the continuall action of the Sun, and <U+017F>o are the cau<U+017F>e of Thawing.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That Winds being continual, becau<U+017F>e their matter never fails, it happens that the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t gets the better of the weake<U+017F>t, and they cha<U+017F>e one another; whence <hi>Virgil</hi> calls them Wre<U+017F>tlers. When the South Winds blow, (which are more frequent, and more gro<U+017F>s then the Northern or Ea<U+017F>tern, by rea<U+017F>on of the Sun's <U+017F>trength in the South, which opens the Pores of the Earth more:) the copious Exhalations which i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of it, are hotter than tho<U+017F>e which come out of the Pores of the Northern Earth, which are clo<U+017F>ed up by Cold, whence the Winds blowing from thence are colder and thinner; ju<U+017F>t as our breath is cold when we contract our Mouthes, and hot when we dilate them. In like manner, the Exhalations i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the Earth's Pores, are hotter or colder, according as the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages out of which they proceed are more or le<U+017F>s dilated, and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, cau<U+017F>e Freezing or Thawing.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the Sun or other Stars are onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Cau<U+017F>es of Freezing and Thawing; namely, by their Heat which <U+017F>erves to rai<U+017F>e the Vapors, which are the next cau<U+017F>es there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, according as they partake more or le<U+017F>s of that external Heat; or, (as the Chymi<U+017F>ts <U+017F>ay) as they are full either of certain nitrous and di<U+017F><U+017F>olving Spirits which cau<U+017F>e Thawing, or of coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating ones which cau<U+017F>e Freezing; <U+017F>uch as tho<U+017F>e are, harden Plants into Stones, which <U+017F>o pre<U+017F>ently congeal drops of water in Caves and Water-droppings, and form the Cry<U+017F>tals of the Rock. Moreover, ju<U+017F>t before it freezes, Sinks, and other <U+017F>tinking places <U+017F>mell more <U+017F>trong, by rea<U+017F>on that the Spirits and Vapors of the Earth are complicated with tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>tinks as they i<U+017F><U+017F>ue forth.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the Cau<U+017F>e of Thawing is to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Heat of the Earth, which exhaling warm Vapors, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap><U+017F>t heats the bottome of the Water, (for which rea<U+017F>on Fi<U+017F>h retire thither) then they mollifie and moi<U+017F>ten the <U+017F>urface of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the Earth hardned by Cold. Moreover, that Heat which is found in the deepe<U+017F>t Mines where the Labourers work naked, and mo<U+017F>t ordinarily in the Water without enduring any Cold; the veins of Sulphur, Bitumen, Vitriol, and Ar<U+017F>enick, which are found in the entralls of the Earth; the Hot Springs, and the <hi>Volcanoes</hi> in its <U+017F>urface, <U+017F>ufficiently argue, That if there be not a Central Fire, (as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> held) yet there is a great Heat there, like that of Living Bodies, which concocts Metals, and makes Plants grow. Hence the changes of Air are fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd in Mines by the Vapors ari<U+017F>ing from beneath, which hinder Re<U+017F>piration, and make the Lamps burn dim, or go quite out. Whereby 'tis evident that they are exhaled by the Heat
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66371:70"/>
of the earth, and not attracted by that of the Sun and Stars, which penetrate but a very little way into the earth. Now as our bodies are inwardly hotter in Winter; <U+017F>o this heat of the earth being concentred in it <U+017F>elf, (as appears by Springs which <U+017F>moke in that <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, and by the heat of <U+017F>ubterraneous places) rai<U+017F>es greater plenty of warm Vapors, which in Winte render the Weather moi<U+017F>t and rainy: but when rain or the coldne<U+017F>s of the air <U+017F>tops tho<U+017F>e pores, then tho<U+017F>e Exhalations being <U+017F>hut up, the Air remains cold, and it freezes; which fro<U+017F>t is again di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd by their eruption. For the natural heat of the Earth, being con<U+017F>tring'd and render'd <U+017F>tronger by the ambient Cold, drives out hotter and more copious exhalations, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t either of the rain-water wherewith it is moi<U+017F>tned, or of other humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; and which arriving at the <U+017F>urface of the Earth which is frozen, <U+017F>often it and fill the air with clouds, which always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a Thaw, as Serenity do's a Fro<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That as Hail is nothing but Rain congeal'd, <U+017F>o Fro<U+017F>t is nothing but Dew condens'd by the vehemence of Cold, and in the Water 'tis call'd Ice: which coldne<U+017F>s conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing the Water, (which is a diaphanous body, and con<U+017F>equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath an internal and radical light) is the cau<U+017F>e of its white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, which is the beginning of light, as the Stars are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd parts of their Orbs. Unle<U+017F>s you had rather a<U+017F>cribe that whitene<U+017F>s to the Air included in the Ice, which al<U+017F>o makes the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>wim upon the water. An Evidence that Cold alone is not the cau<U+017F>e of Freezing; (for Cold alone render bodies more ponderous by conden<U+017F>ing their parts, whence Ice <U+017F>hould be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier then Water) but there is requir'd, be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>ome hot and dry exhalation, which in<U+017F>inuating into the Water, gives it levity.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>uch bodies as are frozen, are <U+017F>o far from receiving augmentation of parts, that they lo<U+017F>e the thinne<U+017F>t of their own; hence a bottle <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>topped that the air can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get in to <U+017F>upply the place of the thinner parts which tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pire and peri<U+017F>h upon freezing, breaks in pieces for avoiding of vacuity. And Wine and Fruits lo<U+017F>e their ta<U+017F>t upon the lo<U+017F>s of their <U+017F>pirits, when they are frozen: which <U+017F>pirits not being able to tran<U+017F>pire in Cabbages and other Vi<U+017F>cous Plants dige<U+017F>t their crudities, and by that means render the <U+017F>ame Plants more tender.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXVI. Of the Cau<U+017F>es of the Small Pox.</head>
            <p>THe variety wherewith this Malady afflicts, or that which it cau<U+017F>es in the body, hath given it the name of <hi>Variolae</hi> (Variolles or Vairolles) as its re<U+017F>emblance to the bli<U+017F>ters, and to the manner wherewith the Venereous Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e invades the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (to whom the <U+017F>ame is Epidemical, being cau<U+017F>ed by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the air) cau<U+017F>es it to be called the Small Pox. The<U+017F>e are efflore<U+017F>cences or pu<U+017F>tules appearing upon the body, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tho<U+017F>e of Children by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s of their <U+017F>kin, with a Feaver, pain, <U+017F>cabbine<U+017F>s, and purulent matter. This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady comprizes three <U+017F>orts of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; Namely, Intemperature, in its feaver and inflammation; Bad conformation, in the little Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies; and <U+017F>olution of continuity, in the Ulcers. Its prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <U+017F>igns are commonly, hoar<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the voice, pain of the head, inflammation of the whole face, yawnings, di<U+017F>tentions, trembling of the whole body, <U+017F>neezings, and <U+017F>titches. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant, e<U+017F><U+017F>ential, and pathognomonical <U+017F>igns are, Deliration, frightful Dreams, pains of the Brea<U+017F>t and Throat, difficulty of Re<U+017F>piration, and a Continual Feaver, which is <U+017F>ometimes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid, <U+017F>ometimes not. All which <U+017F>igns proceed from the violent ebulition and agitation of the humours, the conjunct cau<U+017F>e of this Malady an effect of the natural heat; which being irritated by their Malignity, drives them outwards to the <U+017F>urface where they rai<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e little Tumours; which, if red and le<U+017F>s high, make the Meazles; and when more eminent, the Small Pox: the Pimples whereof at fir<U+017F>t appear very <U+017F>mall, afterwards in time wax red, and grow bigger from day to day till they become white; then they <U+017F>uppurate and dry, and la<U+017F>tly, falling off com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly leave marks behind them, not to be got away, becau<U+017F>e they have con<U+017F>umed the <U+017F>kin which is never generated anew.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, A common effect mu<U+017F>t have a common cau<U+017F>e. Now the Small Pox and Meazles (which differ only, in that the former is produc'd of thinner, and the latter of thicker blood) are di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es not only common to many; but <U+017F>o few e<U+017F>cape them that a general rule here <U+017F>carce admits any exceptions. Two Cau<U+017F>es there are, the Material, or the Efficient. The former is the impurity of the Men<U+017F>trual blood which <U+017F>erves for nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>foetus</hi> in the womb; where at fir<U+017F>t it attracts the pure<U+017F>t and <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t blood, but when grown bigger the gro<U+017F>s together with the thin. So that as Hor<U+017F>es once in their lives ca<U+017F>t the Strangles, <U+017F>o men mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o once purge and void that men<U+017F>trual impurity, which being equally di<U+017F>pers'd over all the body and in <U+017F>mall quantity, hinders not its functions. The efficient Cau<U+017F>e, common likewi<U+017F>e to all men, is the Natural Heat, which drives the<U+017F>e impurities outwards, and <U+017F>o they come to appear upon the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66371:71"/>
<U+017F>kin, (which is the Univer<U+017F>al Emunctory of the whole body) but e<U+017F>pecially upon the face by rea<U+017F>on of its tenderne<U+017F>s, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e being the place where all the Organs of Sen<U+017F>e terminate, 'tis fuller of <U+017F>pirits then any other, and con<U+017F>equently there is a greater attraction thither of tho<U+017F>e malignant Vapors. Now that it <U+017F>eizes <U+017F>ome in their childhood, others in their youth, <U+017F>ome very few in old age, and all after a different manner; this depends upon our particular Con<U+017F>titutions, either natural or acqui<U+017F>ititious by cu<U+017F>tom, and a long u<U+017F>e of the things not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. For, according as the humours reign in the body, they give occa<U+017F>ion to the eruption of that Venemous quality which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay hid; as Madne<U+017F>s and Lepro<U+017F>ie <U+017F>ometimes appear not till after divers years. Our diet al<U+017F>o contributes thereunto; for when it <U+017F>ymboli<U+017F>eth with that malignant humour, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>es the quantity thereof; as on the contrary, it corrects the <U+017F>ame, and retards its motion, if it be of a laudable temper, or exceed in contrary qualities.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, What Original Sin is to the <U+017F>tate of the Soul, that the Small Pox <U+017F>eems to be to the <U+017F>tate of the Body; for this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e commonly invades children, who never committed any fault in their cour<U+017F>e of living, and who<U+017F>e nature <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o much healthier by how much 'tis more vigorous and nearer the principles of their Nativity; wherefore it <U+017F>eems rather to proceed from the vitio<U+017F>ity of the Parents. And as many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es come from the bad di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the <U+017F>eed; <U+017F>o from the impurity of the blood (the material principle of our bodies) <U+017F>ome may al<U+017F>o ari<U+017F>e; as Tettars, Kibes, Corns, and other deformities of the <U+017F>kin, which happen to children, very like this. Moreover, this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e u<U+017F>ually breaks forth in the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and ninth, which are the fir<U+017F>t climacterical years; when Nature endeavours the perfection of her work by purging and clean<U+017F>ing it of all impurities. And as New Wine, when it comes to work, ca<U+017F>ts forth all the heterogeneous impurities in it's body; <U+017F>o doth the natural heat attempt the like by cau<U+017F>ing an ebullition of the blood and <U+017F>pirits: whether this Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happens by the univer<U+017F>al <U+017F>pirit of the world, as tho<U+017F>e in other natural bodies; or whether (as 'tis mo<U+017F>t probable) it proceeds from the very <U+017F>trength of nature, who<U+017F>e motions, although regular and certain, are yet unknown to any other be<U+017F>ides it <U+017F>elf, which produces them according to the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Subject wherein it re<U+017F>ides.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That being our bodies were always form'd of the maternal blood, and indu'd with one and the <U+017F>ame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, (which two are held the material and efficient cau<U+017F>es of the Small Pox) this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould have been in all times and places; and yet it was unknown before the <hi>Arabians,</hi> in who<U+017F>e time it began to appear. For the little red round pu<U+017F>tules, and tho<U+017F>e other like flea-bitings, mention'd by <hi>Hippocrates, Aetius,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other Ancients, are nothing le<U+017F>s then the Small Pox;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:66371:71"/>
to which not only Women during their Suppre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, but even brute Bea<U+017F>ts, which have al<U+017F>o their purgations, (as among others, the Bitch, the Mare, and the Shee-A<U+017F>s) ought to be <U+017F>ubject. On the contrary, <U+017F>uch as have burning Feavers <U+017F>hould be free from it; if it be true, that the <U+017F>eed and leven of this malady is di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated by the ebullition of the blood, which is vehement in a Feaver. But 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to conceive, how a venemous and pernicious matter, (as that impure part of the blood is <U+017F>aid to be) can be pre<U+017F>erv'd for many years in its Ma<U+017F>s; for being the blood <U+017F>erves for continual aliment to all the parts, the<U+017F>e ought to re<U+017F>ent <U+017F>omething of that malignity; yet tho<U+017F>e that are taken with this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e are u<U+017F>ually the mo<U+017F>t healthy, and of a <U+017F>anguine con<U+017F>titution, which is the mo<U+017F>t laudable. For this were to accu<U+017F>e Nature either of Imprudence or Weakne<U+017F>s; but <U+017F>he is good, wi<U+017F>e, powerful, and <U+017F>olicitous for nothing <U+017F>o much as to purifie the body, which <U+017F>he doth not only while the child is in the Womb, where <U+017F>he wraps it up in two membranes, which receive the Urine, Sweat, and other Excrements of <U+017F>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guification (as the Inte<U+017F>tines do the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er excrements) but a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oon as it is born, <U+017F>he expells its immundicities by bli<U+017F>ters, <U+017F>curfs, <U+017F>cabs, tumors of the head and other purgations, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> <U+017F>aith, pre<U+017F>erve from di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, e<U+017F>pecially from the falling <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s. Nor can the Malignity of the Air be the Cau<U+017F>e, as <hi>Fernelius</hi> holds, alledging that the difficulty of re<U+017F>piration, heavine<U+017F>s of the head, inflammation of the face, and <U+017F>uch other concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <U+017F>ymptoms, <U+017F>eem to be caus'd by the viciou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the air, which infects the heart, and by that means hurts the other Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For then the Small Pox would be as Epidemical as the Pe<U+017F>tilence, or any other contagious maladies, and <U+017F>eize upon all men indifferently, not excepting <U+017F>uch as have once had them. Wherefore the matter of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is a <U+017F>ero<U+017F>ity accompanied with the humours, which make the Pox appear of <U+017F>everal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, <U+017F>ometimes Red, Yellow, Black, or White, according as the Blood, Choler, Melancholy, or Flegm flow thither; Wind or Water only cau<U+017F>e bladders or bli<U+017F>ters. Neverthele<U+017F>s it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that this <U+017F>ero<U+017F>ity acquires <U+017F>ome particular maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as appears by the deformity cau<U+017F>ed by the pu<U+017F>tules, which not only pit the <U+017F>kin and fle<U+017F>h, but <U+017F>ometimes even corrode and rot the bones.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the Small Pox is a new and hereditary di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and that as all other new maladies of the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t ages, have always had their cau<U+017F>es, but only wanted fitting di<U+017F>po<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (without which nothing is produced) <U+017F>o the cau<U+017F>es of the Small Pox have always been exi<U+017F>tent, but the particular di<U+017F>po<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of bodies not lighting upon the point requi<U+017F>ite for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, it hath not appeared till the<U+017F>e late times; whether through the influence of Heaven, or through the Malignity of the Air, or the intemperance of men (the mo<U+017F>t apparent cau<U+017F>e of mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es formerly unknown) or el<U+017F>e through contagion

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXVII. Whether we profit be<U+017F>t by Precepts or Examples.</head>
            <p>AS there is nothing <U+017F>o hard as to judg of the worth of things, <U+017F>o it is the highe<U+017F>t point of prudence to under<U+017F>tand the goodne<U+017F>s of the means that may conduce to <U+017F>ome end. Precepts and Examples are the two Means to attain Vertue; 'tis demanded which is the be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t proper. At fir<U+017F>t view, Example <U+017F>eems to have the <U+017F>ame advantage over Precept that the Whole hath over the Part; for a Good Example, be<U+017F>ides being of its own nature a vertuous action holds the place of a Moral Rule; but a Precept is only a General Maxim, not nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follow'd by a particular Action: whence it follows, that Precept regards on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Under<U+017F>tanding, whereto it affords <U+017F>ome light; but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample makes impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon both Faculties together, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding and the Will, by an order nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in civil life, which is regulated by the example of others. Therefore Great Per<U+017F>ons are oblig'd to good Example, which derives its dignity from that of the giver. Moreover, Moral Propo<U+017F>itions are <U+017F>o rea<U+017F>onable and conformable to the in<U+017F>tinct we have of good, that all the World a<U+017F><U+017F>ents to them as con<U+017F>ider'd in the General. There is no body but acknowledges, that, what belongs to each man ought to be render'd to him; that, we ought not to do that to another which we would not have done to our <U+017F>elves: yet in the circum<U+017F>tances and particular ca<U+017F>es we do not always apply tho<U+017F>e precepts, becau<U+017F>e then they appear clog'd with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, to which our pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion or intere<U+017F>t give birth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Example, beng Particular, is more con<U+017F>iderable in Morality, wherein people are govern'd more by opinion then rea<U+017F>on; but Precept is Univer<U+017F>al, and affects the mind only at a di<U+017F>tance, our actions being oftentimes contrary to the <U+017F>ecret dictates of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding. In Example we feel the force and application of a precept in a particular <U+017F>ubject, and know not only that which ought to be done but how it ought to be done by <U+017F>eeing it pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd. Experience it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>hew us, that Doctrine alone is weak and little per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ive, unle<U+017F>s it be animated by the examples of a good life, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ilence is more eloquent than all precepts. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we are like tho<U+017F>e with whom we live, and the maladies of the body are not <U+017F>o contagious as tho<U+017F>e of the mind: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding may as well profit by bad examples; as good, the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66371:72"/>
Under<U+017F>tanding being able to turn bad food into good nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And as a brave Action excites good Motions in us by its beauty, re<U+017F>ulting from its conformity to Rea<U+017F>on; <U+017F>o a bad Action, by its deformity and contrariety to Rea<U+017F>on, gives us aver<U+017F>ion again<U+017F>t it, and an inclination to its oppo<U+017F>ite. <hi>Socrates</hi> judg'd no Le<U+017F><U+017F>on <U+017F>o fit to moderate Anger, as for a Man to behold him<U+017F>elf in a gla<U+017F>s when he is agitated with that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Which cannot be <U+017F>aid of a bad Precept; for this being a bad <U+017F>eed, can never produce any fruit but of the <U+017F>ame Nature. On the other <U+017F>ide, Men are <U+017F>uch Lovers of Plea<U+017F>ures, that Virtue <U+017F>eparated from Delight, <U+017F>tumbles them, and <U+017F>eemes too <U+017F>evere: But Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is a pure Rule of Duty, without any attractive; whereas Example, which appears to our Eyes, and is an Action cloth'd with circum<U+017F>tances, per<U+017F>wades us more <U+017F>weetly, becau<U+017F>e we are naturally prone to Imitation; whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are <U+017F>o charming: And Example is the <U+017F>ubject: of Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Precept cannot be <U+017F>o; for it is general of it <U+017F>elf, and all Moral Actions are <U+017F>ingular.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid. That if it be true, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> <U+017F>ay, that Virtue is nothing el<U+017F>e but a Science, then Precepts mu<U+017F>t be the foundations, as of Science, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o of Virtute; which indeed being a habit of a rea<U+017F>onable Faculty, mu<U+017F>t be more promoted by Precepts, (which are infallible verities, and <U+017F>upply light to that Power) than Examples which have no force to convince a <U+017F>trong Mind. They who follow Virtue by Example, and not by Rea<U+017F>on, have more of the Ape than of the Man; and all the power Example hath, is onely to move the Will to admire and de<U+017F>ire Virtue, but not to teach the way of attaining it, as Precept doth; which, be<U+017F>ides being invariable, and always alike to its <U+017F>elf, is more ea<U+017F>ie to be applyed than Example, which puts on a new face, according to the circum<U+017F>tances of times, places, and per<U+017F>ons; there being no Actions, how, contrary <U+017F>oever, but have Examples to countenance their goodne<U+017F>s. Moreover, they are either of the time pa<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o move us not much; or of the pre<U+017F>ent, in which there are few of Virtue; be<U+017F>ides that, they are of le<U+017F>s duration than Precepts, which are eternal. If vicious Examples attract more powerfully to Vice than vicious Precepts, the <U+017F>ame cannot be <U+017F>aid of the practice of Virtues; <U+017F>ince the<U+017F>e have not all the External Sen<U+017F>e<U+017F> of their party, as Vices have.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and palpable things, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are, have more power upon us than bare words, which cannot <U+017F>o well per<U+017F>wade a Truth, but that they alwayes leave <U+017F>ome doubting in us; whereas Examples being <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, give us a more entire and perfect Knowledge: yea, they have influence even upon brute bea<U+017F>ts, who learn not by Precepts but by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which is an evidence of their certainty; for a thing is the more certain, the more common it is to us with more. Hence <hi>Plato</hi> affirmes, That Examples are nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to per<U+017F>wade high and lofty matters. Precepts, indeed, di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e, but Examples
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66371:73"/>
animate the Soul to Virtue; tho<U+017F>e admoni<U+017F>h, the<U+017F>e <U+017F>timulate and guide, as in the re<U+017F>olution of doing well: In<U+017F>tructions <U+017F>hew the way, but Examples drive us with the point of Honour, and the force of Emulation. Nor do Precepts include Examples, but the contrary; and every Example comprehends a Document. When we <U+017F>ee a Good Man <U+017F>quare his Life out to his Duty, we find I know not what <U+017F>atisfaction and contentment in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his Virtue, and this plea<U+017F>ure makes us conceive, yea, <U+017F>trongly per<U+017F>wades us, that all Virtues are amiable. Even Vicious Examples <U+017F>ometimes make Vice appear to us <U+017F>o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that we dete<U+017F>t in<U+017F>tead of pur<U+017F>uing it. Hence the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> <U+017F>etting a<U+017F>ide the Precepts of Temperature, were wont to make their Slaves drunk, that the ill-favour'd <U+017F>pectacle might make their Children abhor that Vice. La<U+017F>tly, Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who<U+017F>e Life was a continued Example of Virtue, did more Works to teach us, then he gave Words and Precepts, mo<U+017F>t of which are comprehended under Examples and Parables: Yea, the Devil, well knowing that <hi>Adam</hi>'s mind was too <U+017F>trong to be prevail'd upon by Rea<U+017F>ons, fir<U+017F>t gain'd that of his Wife, which was more weak, that he might allure him to <U+017F>in by her Example.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, The end is not onely more noble, but al<U+017F>o more effectual than the means; for 'tis to that alone that they aim and terminate. Now the end of all Examples, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Precepts from them; which Precepts, are general Notions grounded upon many Experiences or Examples, either of others, or our own; but the<U+017F>e being wholly particular, can have no power upon the Under<U+017F>tanding, which frames its conclu<U+017F>ions onely upon things univer<U+017F>ally true, as Maximes and Precepts are, and that more than Examples; for the<U+017F>e are never perfect, but full of a thou<U+017F>and defects, tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ure and infallible. Moreover, Precepts move the Under<U+017F>tanding, which is the noble<U+017F>t of all the Faculties; whereas Examples make impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion onely upon the outward <U+017F>en<U+017F>es and dull wits.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That as the Sight and the Hearing know how to put a difference between Colours and Sounds, without Learning; and all the Faculties can naturally di<U+017F>cern their own Objects: So the Under<U+017F>tanding knows naturally the fir<U+017F>t Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and clearly beholds tho<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t Verities: The Will hath al<U+017F>o in it <U+017F>elf the Principles and Seeds of Virtues, (as the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>is, and remor<U+017F>e of Con<U+017F>cience in the mo<U+017F>t wicked, <U+017F>ufficiently prove) and is of it <U+017F>elf carryed to Virtuous Actions, without needing either Preecepts or Examples, equally unprofitable to the bad, who amend not thereby; and to the good, who want them not.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That the Que<U+017F>tion is to be decided by di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hing of the Minds of Men. Tho<U+017F>e that excel in Judgement attribute more to Rea<U+017F>on than to Examples, which being more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, affect the Imagination of duller heads, who are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66371:73"/>
of Rea<U+017F>ons. So that though Precepts and Arguments be without compari<U+017F>on more perfect than Examples; yet becau<U+017F>e very few are capable of them, (becau<U+017F>e the generality of the World is <U+017F>tupid and dull) therefore they are not generally <U+017F>o proper to teach as Examples; which neverthele<U+017F>s being of no power, but <U+017F>erving onely to clear an ob<U+017F>cure Truth, ought not to have any a<U+017F>cendant over a Mind that is rea<U+017F>onable and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h'd with Knowledge.</p>

            <p>TWo <U+017F>orts of people err in this matter; the <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious, and ignorant vulgar, who attribute every thing to Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and account the <U+017F>ame done either by Saints or Devils; and the Athei<U+017F>ts and Libertines, who believe neither the one nor the other. Phy<U+017F>itians take the middle way, di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing what is fit to be attributed to Nature, and her ordinary motions, from what is <U+017F>upernatural; to which la<U+017F>t Head, 'tis not rea<U+017F>onable to referr di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es and indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions, as the <hi>Incubus</hi> is, call'd by the Greeks, <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> and by the vulgar, the <hi>Night-mare.</hi> 'Tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, An impediment of Re<U+017F>piration, Speech, and Motion, with oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Body, whereby we feel in our <U+017F>leep as 'twere <U+017F>ome weight upon the Stomack. The Cau<U+017F>e of it is a gro<U+017F>s Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, ob<U+017F>tructing principally the hinder part of the Brain, and hindring the egre<U+017F>s of the Animal Spirits de<U+017F>tinated to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts; which Vapor is more ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F><U+017F>ipable than the humor which cau<U+017F>eth the Lethargy, Apoplexy, and other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which are therefore of longer duration than this, which cea<U+017F>es as <U+017F>oon as the <U+017F>aid Vapor is di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated. Now whereas the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the Mind and Body commonly <U+017F>upply the matter of Dreams; (as tho<U+017F>e that are hungry or amorous, will think they eat or <U+017F>ee what, they love; tho<U+017F>e that have pain in <U+017F>ome part, dream that <U+017F>ome body hurts the <U+017F>ame) hence when Re<U+017F>piration, (the mo<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary of all the animal functions) is impeded, we pre<U+017F>ently imagine we have a load lying on our Brea<U+017F>ts, and hindring the dilatation of the <U+017F>ame. And becau<U+017F>e the Brain is employ'd in the <hi>Incubus</hi> therefore all the animal functions are hurt; the Imagination deprav'd, the Sen<U+017F>ation obtunded, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impeded. Hence tho<U+017F>e whom this evil <U+017F>eizes, endeavor to awake, but can neither move nor <U+017F>peak, till after a good while. And though the Cau<U+017F>e of this di<U+017F>order be within our <U+017F>elves, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s the di<U+017F>temper'd per<U+017F>on believes that <U+017F>ome body is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to <U+017F>trangle him by outward violence, which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Imagination rather thinks upon than Internal Cau<U+017F>es;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66371:74"/>
that being more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and common. This has given occa<U+017F>ion to the error of the Vulgar, who charge the<U+017F>e Effects upon Evil Spirits, in<U+017F>tead of imputing them to the Malignity of a Vapor, or <U+017F>ome phlegmatick and gro<U+017F>s humor oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the Stomack; the coldne<U+017F>s and weakne<U+017F>s whereof, ari<U+017F>ing from want of Spirits and Heat, which keeps all the parts in due order, are the mo<U+017F>t manife<U+017F>t Cau<U+017F>es. Much unlikely it is to be cau<U+017F>ed by Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being an Effect of the Natural Faculty, as this of the Vegetative Soul, cannot belong to the Devil, who is a pure Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, As 'tis too gro<U+017F>s to recurr to <U+017F>upernatural Cau<U+017F>es, when Natural are evident; <U+017F>o 'tis too <U+017F>en<U+017F>ual to <U+017F>eek the Rea<U+017F>on of every thing in Nature, and to a<U+017F>cribe to meer Phlegm and the di<U+017F>tempered Phant'<U+017F>ie, the Coitions of Daemons with Men; which we cannot deny without giving the lye to infinite of per<U+017F>ons of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions, to whom the <U+017F>ame have happened; nor without accu<U+017F>ing the Sentences of Judicial Courts which have condemned them. For to omit the Births of <hi>Hercules, Aemas, Alexander, Servius Tullus,</hi> and many other Heroes begotten by the fal<U+017F>e gods of Antiquity, who were no other than Devils, as were al<U+017F>o the Fauni, Satyrs, and the chief of them <hi>Pan,</hi> the prime of the <hi>Incubi,</hi> called by the Hebrews <hi>Haza,</hi> as the chief of the <hi>Succubae</hi> was termed <hi>Libith</hi>: And to <U+017F>ay nothing of the Giants mentioned in <hi>Gene<U+017F>is,</hi> who according to <U+017F>ome Fathers were begotten by Angels; <hi>England</hi> hath had its <hi>Merlin</hi> a great Magician<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> begotten by an <hi>Incubus; Poitou,</hi> Counts begotten of a <hi>Succuba,</hi> half Woman and half Serpent, called <hi>Mellu<U+017F>ine; Poland,</hi> Princes of the Race of the <hi>Jagelloes,</hi> i<U+017F><U+017F>ued from another in form of a Bear; <hi>Hungary,</hi> intire Nations called <hi>Huns,</hi> born of the <hi>Arlunes,</hi> Gothick Witches, and <hi>Fauni.</hi> Even at this day, in the I<U+017F>land <hi>Hi<U+017F>paniola,</hi> by the Relation of <hi>Chieza,</hi> in his Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Peru,</hi> a Daemon, call'd by the Inhabitants <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cota,</hi> hath to do with the Women, and the Children proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <U+017F>uch Conjunction have horns; as al<U+017F>o among the <hi>Turks,</hi> tho<U+017F>e people whom they call <hi>Nephe<U+017F>olians,</hi> are believed to be generated by the operation of Daemons; whether they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <U+017F>ome humane <U+017F>eed which they tran<U+017F>port almo<U+017F>t in an in<U+017F>tant, and <U+017F>o pre<U+017F>erve its Spirits from evaporation; or whether it be by their proper Virtue; <U+017F>ince whatever is naturally producible, as <U+017F>eed is, may be produced by Devils. For in the order of things natural, the <U+017F>uperior and more noble contain eminently, and in a more perfect, degree, the powers of the inferior and le<U+017F>s perfect. Yea, though they were not able to make true <U+017F>eed, it follows not that they cannot produce a perfect Creature; for Nature, of which the Devils have compleat Knowledge, may have divers wayes to compa<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ame end. But as the Devil performs the natural actions of Animals by means <U+017F>upernatural; as he <U+017F>ees without Eyes, moves Bodies without Contact, tran<U+017F>ports him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf from one place to another, without commen<U+017F>uration of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66371:74"/>
intermediate <U+017F>pace, becau<U+017F>e he hath no quantity; <U+017F>o he may make a perfect Animal without ob<U+017F>erving the conditions of ordinary Agents. Moreover, Nature her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>hews us <U+017F>trange transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, as of a Womans hair buried in a dung-hill into Serpents; and of leavs falling into the water, into Ducks; wherefore there is no doubt, but he who hath perfect Knowledge of all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, can by Application of Agents to Patients produce perfect Animals.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Devil being a Spirit of uncleanne<U+017F>s delights not only to combat the Purity of Mankind by his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions, but will have a hand in the <U+017F>in too. When he hath to do with a Woman, he is called <hi>Incubus</hi>; when with a Man, <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuba.</hi> As for this latter, 'tis certain it cannot generate in its <U+017F>elf, for want of place fit to receive the Seed and to reduce it from power into act, as al<U+017F>o of Blood wherewith to nouri<U+017F>h the <hi>Foetus</hi> during nine moneths. 'Tis harder to re<U+017F>olve, whether an <hi>Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> can generate in another. All agree that the Devil by Gods permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion (without which he can do nothing) hath power to move all Bodies from one place to another; and can by that means form a Body of Air, or <U+017F>ome other gro<U+017F>s matter; or for want thereof, take a Body lately dead, animate it with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious heat, and give <U+017F>uch motions as he plea<U+017F>es to all its parts. But becau<U+017F>e Generation requires three things; Di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sex, Copulation of Male and Female, and emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ome prolifick matter containing in its <U+017F>elf a vertue to form all the parts from whence it i<U+017F><U+017F>ued; the Devil may indeed make the two fir<U+017F>t conditions meet, but never the latter, namely a fit and convenient <U+017F>eed, indued with <U+017F>pirits and vital heat, without which it is unfruitful and barren. For he hath no <U+017F>uch <U+017F>eed of his own, becau<U+017F>e it is the re<U+017F>ult of the la<U+017F>t concoction, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made but in a body actually alive, as that which he hath is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed not to be; nor can he borrow <U+017F>uch <U+017F>eed el<U+017F>ewhere, becau<U+017F>e it becomes unfruitful when once <U+017F>hed out of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of Nature by rea<U+017F>on of the evaporation of its <U+017F>pirits.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, There is nothing <U+017F>upernatural in the <hi>Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>; for 'tis only a <U+017F>ymptom of the Animal Faculty accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with three circum<U+017F>tances, namely, Re<U+017F>piration hindred, Motion hurt, and a fan<U+017F>ie depraved. The fir<U+017F>t proceeds from a phlegmatick, raw, and cold matter, which coming to lye heavy in the bottom of the Stomack, pulls down the Diaphragm (whereto the Ventricle is annex'd by its upper part) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loaden and wanting its free Motion; Re<U+017F>piration, whereof it is the principal Organ, is con<U+017F>equently hindred. As al<U+017F>o it is by gro<U+017F>s fumes elevated from the Hypochondres and Me<U+017F>araical Veins; (which being the fir<U+017F>t ways of Food, abound with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities and gro<U+017F>s vapours) which coming to the hinder part of the Brain, ob<U+017F>truct the commerce of the Spirits, dedicated to the motion of all the parts; but particularly that of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm, by ob<U+017F>tructing the two couple of Nerves which i<U+017F><U+017F>ue
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66371:75"/>
out of the fourth and fifth Vertebrae, and communicate motion to it; ju<U+017F>t as, in <U+017F>leep, Sen<U+017F>ation is <U+017F>top'd by more tenuious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ing the forepart of the Brain, which is more <U+017F>oft. Hence <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>leep upon the back part of head are more <U+017F>ubject to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e then tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>leep on one <U+017F>ide. La<U+017F>tly, the voluptuous phan<U+017F>ie, which accompanies this accident, though very rarely, proceeds either from the abundance, or quality of the Seed; which <U+017F>ending its Species into the phan<U+017F>ie, this Faculty frames to its <U+017F>elf a delightful object and <U+017F>tirs up the Motive Power, as this doth the Expul<U+017F>ive Faculty of the Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which di<U+017F>charge that excrementitious matter, whil<U+017F>t the la<U+017F>civious Imagination fancies to it <U+017F>elf the conjunction of unclean Spirits.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXIX. Which Animal is happie<U+017F>t, according to Nature.</head>
            <p>WHereas a man cannot <U+017F>o well <U+017F>peak of others as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, it were to be wi<U+017F>hed that every thing, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally capable of felicity, came hither to give its <U+017F>uffrage. I believe the Birds would not be the la<U+017F>t to te<U+017F>tifie to us by their <U+017F>inging and agreeable warbling, the mo<U+017F>t certain indication of joy and contentment; as cries are of the contrary, grief and <U+017F>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s. Indeed, if there be any plea<U+017F>ure in the World, I think Birds have it; for they go not only to <U+017F>eek their food in the bottom of the water, as Water-fowl do (to whom that Element is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with Fi<U+017F>hes); they have not only the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>hare in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the land with four-footed Animals, and both together with amphibious creatures; but moreover they fly in the Air, approaching Heaven nearer then we can, and cleaving that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with an innocent plea<U+017F>ure not to be under<U+017F>tood but by the action it <U+017F>elf; whence Angels are painted with wings. And as of all Animals the mo<U+017F>t imperfect and lea<U+017F>t capable of felicity are the Reptile, <U+017F>uch as Earth-worms, little differing from this very Element; <U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e are the happie<U+017F>t which remove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves furthe<U+017F>t from it, as Birds do. Among<U+017F>t which I <U+017F>hall leave it to the Voluptuous to <U+017F>ay, whether it be the Cock, the Sparrow, or the amorous Dove; tho<U+017F>e that love Mu<U+017F>ick, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether 'tis the Nightingal, and to tho<U+017F>e that e<U+017F>teem the <U+017F>ight the mo<U+017F>t ravi<U+017F>hing of all the Sen<U+017F>es, whether it be the Eagle, who<U+017F>e eye di<U+017F>covers the remote<U+017F>t objects and turns not a<U+017F>ide even from the beams of the Sun.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ince nothing is intirely happy in the World, the Que<U+017F>tion <U+017F>hould rather be put, Which is the lea<U+017F>t unhappy of all Animals. Man, the only competent judge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges 'tis not him<U+017F>elf, for he <U+017F>eems to be the Butt of all
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66371:75"/>
the mi<U+017F>eries in the World; of which al<U+017F>o he is <U+017F>o much more <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible then Bea<U+017F>ts by how much he hath a mind more qualified to apprehend and re<U+017F>ent them. For whereas they <U+017F>ay, he alone is capable of felicity; 'tis true indeed in reference to the future not the pre<U+017F>ent life, no age whereof is capable of reli<U+017F>hing an intire contentment: and if one drop of Gall mingled with a good quantity of Milk denominates the <U+017F>ame bitter, certainly we cannot term mans life plea<U+017F>ant whil<U+017F>t it hath abundantly more pain then delight. He comes into the World weeping, and naked without any Arms or defence; wherein he is more unhappy then Bea<U+017F>ts whom nature hath guarded with cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures again<U+017F>t the injuries of the air. His fir<U+017F>t Child-hood is not yet capable of any <U+017F>ort of plea<U+017F>ure. Adole<U+017F>cence would ta<U+017F>te thereof indeed, but is denied liberty by its Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogues. Youth precipitates it <U+017F>elf into more kind of evils then it ta<U+017F>tes of good: be<U+017F>ides that, it <U+017F>ees mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ures for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by Divines, Phy<U+017F>icians, and Civilians, who <U+017F>eem to have endeavoured to take from us all contentment in this World; which if old age makes us the le<U+017F>s loth to part with, yet there is no <U+017F>o great re<U+017F>ignation of <U+017F>pirit but is thwarted by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the fle<U+017F>h, nor <U+017F>ecurity <U+017F>o carnal but is <U+017F>tartled with the records of con<U+017F>cience. Moreover, the true mark of felicity being the <U+017F>atisfaction and contentment of him that po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es it, no per<U+017F>on can be happy in this world <U+017F>ince none is contented. For man being de<U+017F>ign'd to a more perfect life then this, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de<U+017F>ires the Supream Good, and all that is below it di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>es him, as uncapable to <U+017F>atisfie him; and becau<U+017F>e he cannot find it here, therefore neither can he find contentment, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in <U+017F>atisfying the Appetite. Bea<U+017F>ts, on the contrary, having no other knowledg but that of Sen<U+017F>ual and Delectable Good, de<U+017F>ire no other, but are fully <U+017F>atisfi'd and contented therewith, and con<U+017F>equently more happy in this World then men.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, If Felicity con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in action, that Animal mu<U+017F>t be mo<U+017F>t happy which acts mo<U+017F>t perfectly. So doth man, whether you con<U+017F>ider him as to the Body or the Soul. For to <U+017F>ay nothing of the divine functions of his Under<U+017F>tanding and Will; the <U+017F>ole <U+017F>tructure of his Body, which was made erect that he might behold Heaven (whereof he is capable) and which alone is indu'd with beauty, one of the effects of Health, <U+017F>ufficiently proves it: For though <U+017F>ome Animals po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s him in <U+017F>ome one <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, yet he alone excells equally in all, and knows the differences of colours, <U+017F>ounds, odours, <U+017F>apours, and tactile qualities, in the participation of which he finds plea<U+017F>ure whereof bea<U+017F>ts are incapable.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That to believe Man can be happy here, is to contradict the opinion of all the Sages of Antiquity, who have acknowledg'd Man the weake<U+017F>t and pitifulle<U+017F>t of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and the Scripture it <U+017F>elf, which terms his life full of <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and this World his bani<U+017F>hment. And indeed if we place

Felicity in the knowledg of po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ing it, Mi<U+017F>ery mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the knowledg or opinion we have of being mi<U+017F>erable; of which reflection Man alone being capable, he mu<U+017F>t be al<U+017F>o more too of unhappine<U+017F>s then felicity; and the more, ina<U+017F>much as there are more things that can afflict then content him; <U+017F>ome always bringing pre<U+017F>ent inconvenience with them, others leaving <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be de<U+017F>ir'd after them, and never <U+017F>atiating our Appetite. For the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul, which is held the <U+017F>ubject of Mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F>s, is the principal ob<U+017F>tacle to attaining it: <U+017F>ince having for its object a more perfect and ab<U+017F>olute Good then it can po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s in this life, it cannot e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h a true Felicity (which of its own nature mu<U+017F>t be as la<U+017F>ting as the Exi<U+017F>tence of him who enjoys it) upon things acknowledg'd frail and peri<U+017F>hing, as Natural and Sen<U+017F>ible goods are; which being <U+017F>utable to the duration and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of other Animals, their enjoyment thereof fills them with perfect happine<U+017F>s. But among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e, Fi<U+017F>hes <U+017F>eem to me mo<U+017F>t happy; whether you mea<U+017F>ure their happine<U+017F>s by the largene<U+017F>s of their habitation which is the va<U+017F>t Ocean, of far greater extent then the Earth, from which being more <U+017F>evered then Birds, who are forced to de<U+017F>cend thither for their food and re<U+017F>t, they are al<U+017F>o le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ubject to the ambu<U+017F>hes of men, and in this regard more happy; or whether you con<U+017F>ider corporal health (the foundation of all felicity) of which Fi<U+017F>hes are <U+017F>o well provided that it hath occa<U+017F>ion'd the Proverb, As <U+017F>ound as a Fi<U+017F>h; or la<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether you place felicity in the privation of pain, which re<U+017F>ides chiefly in the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of Touching; which being more dull in them then in other Animals, they are al<U+017F>o le<U+017F>s <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; and for this rea<U+017F>on were made mute by nature which hath given a voice to Animals chiefly to te<U+017F>tifie thereby the grief which they re<U+017F>ent.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, If there be <U+017F>o great a number of opinions wherein the felicity of one <U+017F>ingle Animal, Man, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts; there may ju<U+017F>tly be great variety of judgments, concerning which is the happie<U+017F>t of all Animals. To determine which, we mu<U+017F>t imitate Painters, who before they couch their Colours propo<U+017F>e a perfect Idea of their work; which the nearer it approaches, the more excellent it is reputed. In like manner, we mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t form an Idea of this felicity, and then <U+017F>ee which Animal comes neare<U+017F>t it; whether the Servant or the Ma<U+017F>ter, the brute Bea<U+017F>t or Man; who<U+017F>e mind, whereby he infinitely <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>es all the re<U+017F>t of the Creatures, <U+017F>eems to be ingenious to its own lo<U+017F>s; not imploying it <U+017F>elf, but to find out rea<U+017F>ons to prove him unhappy: <U+017F>ince in favour of other Animals we lay a<U+017F>ide that ambition which is <U+017F>o natural to us, and are willing to yield to the vile<U+017F>t of them, what we would di<U+017F>pute with the mo<U+017F>t perfect of men. Now that which makes mo<U+017F>t people mi<U+017F>taken in their judgment, is, that being no per<U+017F>on injoys an intire felicity, they imagine that all happine<U+017F>s lyes in that thing which is wanting, and <U+017F>o e<U+017F>teem him alone happy that po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es it. Thus a poor <U+017F>pirit
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66371:76"/>
per<U+017F>waded that all happine<U+017F>s con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in <U+017F>trength and courage, will <U+017F>ay that the Lyon is the happie<U+017F>t of all Animals, <U+017F>ince his courage gives him empire over all tho<U+017F>e of his condition. The <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on accounting health (the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>irable of all goods, prefers Bea<U+017F>ts before Man, whom his exact tempers renders more obnoxious to external cau<U+017F>es which produce di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. On the other <U+017F>ide, if Animals are happy, 'tis as Fools are, who<U+017F>e minds are quiet, by rea<U+017F>on of their ignorance and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility. But as it is better to be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible then in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible even upon the condition of enduring pain <U+017F>ometimes; <U+017F>o it is more happy to have a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal mind, though it cau<U+017F>es troubles to us <U+017F>ometimes, then to have none. Moreover we cannot avoid the <U+017F>troaks of fortune, otherwi<U+017F>e then tho<U+017F>e of Thunder, namely by being very high or very low; but 'tis better to be above tempe<U+017F>ts then below them, and to be incapable of them by rea<U+017F>on as a wi<U+017F>e man, then by <U+017F>tupidity as a bea<U+017F>t.</p>

            <p>THough plurality of Wives or Husbands be di<U+017F>allowed by the Chri<U+017F>tian Law, yet not being contrary to the Law of Nations (for many admit it), nor of nature (during which it was in u<U+017F>e); we may be permitted to doubt whether, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing Polygamy, it were better one Husband <U+017F>hould have many Wives, or one Wife many Husbands. There are examples of both. Plurality of Wives was practi<U+017F>ed by <hi>Lamech,</hi> who fir<U+017F>t had two; by <hi>Abraham, Jacob,</hi> and the Patriarchs, for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of their Lineage; afterwards by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> who had 700 Wives and 300 Concubins; and at pre<U+017F>ent 'tis in u<U+017F>e among the Turks who are permitted to have as many Wives as they can keep. As for plurality of Husbands, though it be not now in u<U+017F>e, yet it was <U+017F>ometimes among<U+017F>t the Amazons who made u<U+017F>e of Men only as Stallions; as al<U+017F>o among<U+017F>t the Medes and Per<U+017F>ians, where it was a <U+017F>hame for a Woman to have le<U+017F>s then five Husbands. And by the report of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, the Women of great <hi>Britain</hi> had no le<U+017F>s then ten or twelve Husbands a piece. Neverthele<U+017F>s this plurality of Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands is <U+017F>omthing again<U+017F>t the Law of Nature, according to which the Male as the mo<U+017F>t perfect is the head and ma<U+017F>ter of the Woman: and as 'tis a mon<U+017F>trous thing for a body to have many heads, <U+017F>o 'tis for a Woman to have many Husbands; be<U+017F>ides that they hinder production of Children; (for we <U+017F>ee publick Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are barren) and on the contrary, plurality of Wives is the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66371:77"/>
cau<U+017F>e of much i<U+017F><U+017F>ue. Wherefore 'tis more expedient in a State, who<U+017F>e chief <U+017F>trength con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the number of men, that one Husband have many Wives, then one Wife many Husbands.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, Though men, abu<U+017F>ing the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Laws to their own advantage, have oftner married more Wives then they have permitted them to have more Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; yet the women have as much rea<U+017F>on of complaint in this point, as in any other e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd to their prejudice, without their being heard or <U+017F>ummon'd. Their vehement and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar appetite after man (of which the irregular motions of that <hi>Animal in Animali</hi> are mo<U+017F>t certain evidences) <U+017F>eems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in their favour. For Woman alone of all Animals de<U+017F>ires the Male at all times, even after conception; She, the Fire, the Sea, and Death, never <U+017F>ay 'tis enough; as the matter hath a continual appetite of Forms, <U+017F>o hath <U+017F>he of the Male: which de<U+017F>ire being natural, ought to be <U+017F>atisfi'd; otherwi<U+017F>e it were in vain: but nothing is <U+017F>o in Nature, and therefore <U+017F>he ought to be permitted more Husbands; <U+017F>ince one alone is more apt to irritate then <U+017F>atiate her. She is able and hath wherewith to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them; but if one man cannot <U+017F>uffice one woman, how can he acquit him<U+017F>elf towards a dozen; E<U+017F>pecially in this age, wherein, no doubt, women would appeal from the con<U+017F>titution of <hi>Solon,</hi> who would have men live with their wives only thrice a moneth; as well as from that fooli<U+017F>h cu<U+017F>tom of <hi>Cato,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vi<U+017F>ited his but when it rain'd. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was much better advis'd, when he permitted old or otherwi<U+017F>e impotent per<U+017F>ons to chu<U+017F>e out the hand<U+017F>ome<U+017F>t young men to lye with their wives.

            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the deci<U+017F>ion of this Que<U+017F>tion (the very report of which <U+017F>ometimes put the <hi>Roman</hi> Dames into an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar) being of very great con<U+017F>equence to both parties, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite to ob<U+017F>erve <U+017F>o much equity therein, that the Women have no ground of exception; though, to <U+017F>peak truth, I know not which would be mo<U+017F>t to their advantage, whether to have more Husbands (who would be <U+017F>o many Ma<U+017F>ters and Tyrants) or to <U+017F>hare with other Women the Care<U+017F><U+017F>es of one alone; the fir<U+017F>t being contrary to their haughty humour. and the <U+017F>econd to their jealou<U+017F>ie. Be<U+017F>ides, the plurality of Hu<U+017F>bands would hinder not only the propagation, but al<U+017F>o the education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for none would take care of the Children which were not his own; and though they were, he would not believe they belong'd to him. It would be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for a Father to know his own Child; the term of Child-bearing being no more certain te<U+017F>timony, then the re<U+017F>emblance of Phy<U+017F>iognomy. Moreover, whether the Wife were hated or loved by her Husbands, <U+017F>he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66371:77"/>
would be di<U+017F>pleas'd to <U+017F>ee all her Rivals in bad intelligence, or the effects of their common hatred: However, being unable to plea<U+017F>e all, by rea<U+017F>on of the diver<U+017F>ity of their humours, <U+017F>he could not avoid the di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t of <U+017F>ome of them. As for that impure plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure, 'tis too <U+017F>hameful to be brought into the account; be<U+017F>ides that the frequency of it would take away its <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s; no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures of life being <U+017F>uch, but upon the <U+017F>core of their rarity.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, They that fear the multitude of Husbands would hinder conception, and con<U+017F>equently generation, by the confu<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>everal Seeds, know not how either is effected; <U+017F>ince Phy<U+017F>itians affirm with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> That the Womb no <U+017F>ooner receives the fruitful Seed, but it <U+017F>huts it <U+017F>elf up to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>traitly (as the Stomach does the Meat) and that <U+017F>o exactly as not to admit a needles point; <U+017F>o that it cannot open again to receive new Seed in a <U+017F>econd Coition. And though <U+017F>uperfoetation happen <U+017F>ometimes, yet 'tis very rare, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to a Woman that lies with the <U+017F>ame Man <U+017F>everal times, as well as to one that lies with many. The other Inconvenience, of the incertainty of I<U+017F><U+017F>ues, and con<U+017F>equently of Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ions, is as little con<U+017F>iderable; for Man being not born for him<U+017F>elf, but for the State whereof he is a Member; and Children le<U+017F>s belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Parents then to the Commonwealth, whereof they are the Nur<U+017F>ery; 'twere more expedient that they were bred and in<U+017F>tructed like tho<U+017F>e brave <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> at the publick charge, than of their Parents, who<U+017F>e tenderne<U+017F>s and too great indulgence is oft-times the cau<U+017F>e of their evil education. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this was the de<U+017F>ign of that Divine Commonwealth of <hi>Plato,</hi> who would have not only other Goods, but Wives and Children al<U+017F>o common; that <U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e ungrateful words of <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine,</hi> which are the cau<U+017F>e of all Mi<U+017F>chiefs, might be taken away. For by this means that importunate <U+017F>olicitude of Appropriation and Jealou<U+017F>ie, which oftentimes afflicts both parties, would be no longer any thing but a phanta<U+017F>m: Women would find their <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the plurality of Husbands; the<U+017F>e, how many <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to one woman, having always enough and more then they needed; and the woman being cunning enough to divide her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <U+017F>o that all her Hu<U+017F>bands might be contented; who, be<U+017F>ides dividing the burden of dome<U+017F>tick cares, would have an ea<U+017F>ier ta<U+017F>k by having the more A<U+017F><U+017F>ociates. But e<U+017F>pecially 'twould be much for the womans intere<U+017F>t; for if <U+017F>he be belov'd by all her Husbands, 'twill be un<U+017F>peakable happine<U+017F>s to her; if hated by any, the care<U+017F><U+017F>es of <U+017F>ome will make her amends for the bad u<U+017F>age of others: whereas finding no remedy in that Gordian knot which tyes her to one per<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he abandons her <U+017F>elf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pair: in<U+017F>omuch that in the time of <hi>Spurius Carvilius,</hi> <U+017F>eventy women accus'd one another to the Senate of having poy<U+017F>on'd their Husbands. But if <U+017F>he be con<U+017F>train'd to <U+017F>hare the care<U+017F><U+017F>es of one Husband with a douzen rivals, there will be nothing but perpetual feuds, envies, and jealou<U+017F>ies.

            <p>MOtion, which is the mutation from one <U+017F>tate to another, is either <U+017F>imple or compound: Simple is either of Quality, &amp; is term'd Alteration; or of Place, and is call'd Lation or Motion Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Compound is either to Sub<U+017F>tance, and is nam'd Generation, which includes alteration and formation; or to a greater Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which comprehends Local Motion with Accretion or Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, which cannot be made unle<U+017F>s the parts extended change place. This Accretion is an effect of one of the Faculties <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient to the Vegetative or Natural, which are three, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative, the Auctive or Accretive and the Nutritive; according to the three operations ob<U+017F>erv'd in living bodies which have parts generated, nouri<U+017F>hing, and increa<U+017F>ing; for a thing mu<U+017F>t be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated before it can grow and acquire the perfection wherein it is maintain'd by Nutrition. The Generative Faculty, which is compounded of the Alterative and Formative, regards the <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in the womb. The Auctive governs it from its birth till the twentieth or one and twentieth year, which is the term of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. The Nutritive continues all the time of life, which cannot <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t without nouri<U+017F>hment; becau<U+017F>e this repairs the continual di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation of our <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance caus'd by the action of heat upon humidity; in which action, Life it <U+017F>elf con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts. Now though the body may be nouri<U+017F>ht without growing, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grow unle<U+017F>s it be nouri<U+017F>ht. For Accretion being an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<U+017F>ion of the parts in length and breadth, new <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>upply'd to fill up the place of that which is extended: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e, a living body <U+017F>hould grow no more then a bladder doth when it is blown, or a piece of leather when it is <U+017F>tretcht; in the former, what is gotten in capacity, is lo<U+017F>t in thickne<U+017F>s; and in the latter, what is gotten in length is impair'd in breadth: <U+017F>o that the augmentation of parts would be rather imaginary than
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:66371:78"/>
real, without <U+017F>upply of new matter to <U+017F>ucceed that which is equally extended in all its dimen<U+017F>ions: among<U+017F>t which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s that of <U+017F>tature, and of the <U+017F>olid parts, (as the bones) is call'd Growth, and not that which is made in thickne<U+017F>s and the fle<U+017F>hy parts, which are enlarged manytimes after the time of full growth.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, That all things being finite, mu<U+017F>t have bounds of magnitude <U+017F>utable to the u<U+017F>e whereunto they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; which bounds are not determinate in inanimate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as Stones, Metals, Hair, and Nails; who<U+017F>e accretion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by the bare appo<U+017F>ition of matter, they are augmented continually, <U+017F>o long as there is acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of new matter to the former. But in living bodies the <U+017F>ame are regular; for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the<U+017F>e being internal, and the work of the <U+017F>oul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues till the body hath attain'd the proportion and <U+017F>tature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite to its functions. To compa<U+017F>s which, Nature employs Heat as the Efficient Cau<U+017F>e, and Humidity as the Material. Hence children grow mo<U+017F>t in their infancy, becau<U+017F>e they are then mo<U+017F>t moi<U+017F>t; and men to a larger <U+017F>ize then women, becau<U+017F>e they have more heat. Young men indeed have a more pungent and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous heat then Children, but the<U+017F>e are better <U+017F>tor'd; (as being nearer the principles of their generation); and though it be not <U+017F>o active, yet 'tis more proper for the growth of the <U+017F>olid parts, which being de<U+017F>iccated by a violent heat are not <U+017F>o exten<U+017F>ible as when they are full of a fat and unctuous humidity. But as for the manner of Accretion, 'tis almo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame with that of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition: The Aliment having been prepar'd in the Stomach and Liver, and by this latter tran<U+017F>mitted by the veins into all the parts of the body, the purer particles of it, <U+017F>weat through the coats of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and fall like a gentle dew upon the parts, which fir<U+017F>t imbibe, then agglutinate, and la<U+017F>tly, a<U+017F><U+017F>imilate the <U+017F>ame. So that Nutrition is nothing but A<U+017F><U+017F>imilation of the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance of the food to that of the living body; and as Aliments nouri<U+017F>h by re<U+017F>emblance of their Sub<U+017F>tance, and by vertue of their Form, <U+017F>o they cau<U+017F>e augmentation by their Quantity, and Matter, which arriving at the <U+017F>olid parts, as the Bones, Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and Ligaments, cau<U+017F>es the <U+017F>ame to extend and grow in all dimen<U+017F>ions; but e<U+017F>pecially in height, by rea<U+017F>on that 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Heat to drive Humidity upwards. And as when the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is equal to the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation, the body is only nouri<U+017F>ht (as in the Age of Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence) <U+017F>o when the Income of matter is greater than the Expence, the <U+017F>urplu<U+017F>age meeting with a due heat cau<U+017F>eth augmentation; if it be le<U+017F>s, there follows wa<U+017F>ting or diminution, as is <U+017F>een Old-Age.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, As Animals are indu'd with a nobler degree of life than Plants, <U+017F>o they vegetate after a more <U+017F>ublime manner, and not only by bare heat and moi<U+017F>ture. For among<U+017F>t Animals, the Elephant a melancholy, and con<U+017F>equently, cold and dry bea<U+017F>t, is yet the greate<U+017F>t of the field; the Crocodile, though cold,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66371:79"/>
grows all its life; and <U+017F>ome Serpents have by long age attained to the length of <U+017F>ixty foot. So among<U+017F>t Trees, Oaks, though the drye<U+017F>t, are the large<U+017F>t. Of Bones, the <hi>Malleus, Incus,</hi> and <hi>Stapes</hi> in the Ear, which <U+017F>erve to reproduce <U+017F>ounds, grow not at all, though they be full of muco<U+017F>ity and humidity: on the contrary, the Teeth, the drye<U+017F>t of all parts (as is manife<U+017F>ted by their rotting la<U+017F>t) yet grow all the life long. But if Heat and Moi<U+017F>ture were the cau<U+017F>es of Accretion, then the Sanguine, who are hot and moi<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hould be of the large<U+017F>t <U+017F>ize, as they are not, but commonly grow as well as the Flegmatick more in thickne<U+017F>s than height, augmenting their fle<U+017F>h and fat more then their <U+017F>olid parts. On the contrary, the talle<U+017F>t men are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cold, dry, and lean, the lowe<U+017F>t, generally hotter; and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple grow upon recovery after fevers which dry the body. Wherefore 'tis more probable that the Growth of Animals is an effect of the Spirits, which in<U+017F>inuating into the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els extend the <U+017F>ame, and withall the membranes, mu<U+017F>cles, and other parts encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ing them proportionably.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the Spirits are indeed the Soul's Organs and In<U+017F>truments whereby <U+017F>he performs her functions; but being of <U+017F>o volatile and fluid a nature, as not to be reckon'd in the number of the parts of Man's Body, they cannot of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves cau<U+017F>e Accretion, which requires Appo<U+017F>ition of new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which in<U+017F>inuates it <U+017F>elf equally into all the parts ju<U+017F>t as the nouri<U+017F>hment doth; both without penetration of dimen<U+017F>ions, or admi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of vacuity. This matter mu<U+017F>t be humid, becau<U+017F>e, of all Bodies; the moi<U+017F>t are mo<U+017F>t pliant and exten<U+017F>ible: Whence the Sea by rea<U+017F>on of its humidity, produces Mon<U+017F>ters of <U+017F>trange bulk. Yet this humidity, as well as the heat mu<U+017F>t be in due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; for a great heat con<U+017F>umes in<U+017F>tead of increa<U+017F>ing; whence the Males of Birds of prey are le<U+017F><U+017F>er than the Females, becau<U+017F>e they are hotter; but if it be too weak, then the moi<U+017F>ture, in<U+017F>tead of a<U+017F>cending, falls downward by its proper gravity; which is the cau<U+017F>e that Women, who have le<U+017F>s heat, are al<U+017F>o of le<U+017F><U+017F>er <U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than Men, and larger downwards as Men are upwards. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various marriage of this heat with moi<U+017F>ture, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies grow variou<U+017F>ly; <U+017F>ome more <U+017F>lowly; others, more <U+017F>peedily; <U+017F>ome are little and dwarfi<U+017F>h; others, Giants; according to the defect or abundance of the matter <U+017F>erving to their fir<U+017F>t Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But as for the re<U+017F>t of Man-kind, Wi<U+017F>e Nature hath <U+017F>et her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>uch bounds as <U+017F>he hath judg'd convenient, beyond which the mo<U+017F>t part grow not; which are between <U+017F>ix and <U+017F>even foot: Not the Accretive Faculty is then lo<U+017F>t or corrupted, (for 'tis that power of the Soul, and con<U+017F>equently, incorruptible and in<U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, from her) but it cannot act longer for want of fitting di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>itions, to wit, the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s and moi<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>olid parts. As a Mule hath a Sen<U+017F>itive Soul, but not the virtue of generating, which is one of the Faculties of that Soul; and a Load-<U+017F>tone rub'd with Garlick, hath <U+017F>till the virtue of attracting Iron, but

Now if we compare Dinner and Supper together, it <U+017F>eemes requi<U+017F>ite that the latter be more plentiful, becau<U+017F>e the Time en<U+017F>uing, it is mo<U+017F>t proper for Dige<U+017F>tion, in regard of the intro-rece<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the natural heat during <U+017F>leep, which becoming by that means more united and vigorous, performes the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral functions, to wit, Concoction, Di<U+017F>tribution, Appo<U+017F>ition, and A<U+017F><U+017F>imilation, more perfectly then after Dinner, when it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted otherwi<U+017F>e, to the Sen<U+017F>es and Operations both of Body and Mind: Be<U+017F>ides that, the coldne<U+017F>s and darkne<U+017F>s of the night, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes not a little to the <U+017F>ame effect upon the account of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peri<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is. Unle<U+017F>s we had rather, with <U+017F>ome, e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h a new power of the Soul, governing and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing the Spirits accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity; <U+017F>ometimes giving them the bridle, and cau<U+017F>ing them to move outwards, as in Anger, Shame, and Indignation; <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>ummoning them inwards, as in Fear, Sadne<U+017F>s, and Sleep, which for this rea<U+017F>on renders the Countenance pale, and all the extream parts cold; whereas in the time of waking, the external parts being hotter, leave the Internal more cold.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That he agreed with the Church, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes Fa<U+017F>ting in the Evening but allows Dinners; which it doth not without mature con<U+017F>ideration, drawn as well from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as from Grace.

and <U+017F>erenity of Mind. The reparation of our di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated Spirits by Food, cau<U+017F>eth the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>order in the Body that happens in a Town or Village upon the entrance of <U+017F>trangers to people it, after its de<U+017F>olation by <U+017F>ome accident; and therefore 'tis better that this trouble arrive in the day, when our waking <U+017F>en<U+017F>es are able to <U+017F>ecure them<U+017F>elves from the Commotions cau<U+017F>ed by this change, than in the night, who<U+017F>e darkne<U+017F>s helps to multiply the Phanta<U+017F>ms which are in the Imagination, pe<U+017F>ter'd with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors and gro<U+017F>s fumes of Meats, the Dige<U+017F>tion whereof is then but begun. Whereas in the day time, <U+017F>uch vapors tran<U+017F>pire more freely by the Pores which are opened by the heat of the Sun, and by the Exerci<U+017F>es which are u<U+017F>ed in the Afternoon. Be<U+017F>ides, Meats being onely to fill emptine<U+017F>s, the time of the greate<U+017F>t inanition is the fitte<U+017F>t for repletion; which certainly Noon mu<U+017F>t be, after the Evacuations of the fore-going Night and Morning.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, There are four manners of taking Repa<U+017F>ts: Fir<U+017F>t, Some eat often, and very much at each time; <U+017F>o did the <hi>Athletae</hi> of old, and <U+017F>o do tho<U+017F>e Gourmandizers who are alwayes hungry, and who<U+017F>e Stomacks have been found after their death of unu<U+017F>ual capacity: This way is altogether oppo<U+017F>ite to Health. Secondly, Some eat little and <U+017F>eldom: which cour<U+017F>e befits acute Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; tho<U+017F>e that are judg'd the fourth day, requiring <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a total ab<U+017F>tinence, in ca<U+017F>e the Patient's <U+017F>trength can bear it; tho<U+017F>e that reach to the <U+017F>eventh or fourteenth, very little Food and <U+017F>eldom. Thirdly, Such as mu<U+017F>t eat little but often; as little Children and Old people, who<U+017F>e heat being weak and ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ipated, they mu<U+017F>t be often nouri<U+017F>h'd; but by a little at a time, for fear of overcharging their too weak Stomacks. The la<U+017F>t and commone<U+017F>t way, is, to eat plentifully but <U+017F>eldom, which is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of middle-ag'd people, who u<U+017F>ually eat twice a day, and more at one Meal than at the other: it being hard for a Man to <U+017F>atiate him<U+017F>elf both at Dinner and Supper without indammaging his Health. Which made <hi>Plato</hi> wonder when he heard that the <hi>Sicilians</hi> fill'd them<U+017F>elves with Meat twice a day, and oblig'd the <hi>Romans</hi> to make a light repa<U+017F>t about Noon, and a <U+017F>plendid Supper; which I am for. Upon this account the Church hath, to macerate us, forbidden Suppers on Fa<U+017F>ting dayes; which is an Argument that they are more agreeable and more conducing to Health than Dinners. For <U+017F>uch quantity of Food is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as an<U+017F>wers to the natural heat; which being not onely more vigorous, but al<U+017F>o of longer duration between Supper and Dinner, than between Dinner and Supper, (the interval whereof is <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom above <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even hours, whereas that between Supper and Dinner is about <U+017F>eventeen) 'tis more rea<U+017F>onable to <U+017F>up more largely than dine. For if the Dinner be large<U+017F>t, we <U+017F>hall eat either as much as the heat is able to dige<U+017F>t by Supper-time, or more. If we eat more, and go to Supper before the dige<U+017F>tion of the Dinner is wholly fini<U+017F>h'd, we <U+017F>hall beget crudities, which are the <U+017F>eed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66371:80"/>
of mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. If we eat as much as the heat can dige<U+017F>t, and the Supper be le<U+017F>s then the Dinner; then the heat which follows the Supper being <U+017F>tronger and more active, will <U+017F>oon concoct the meat taken at Supper; and (becau<U+017F>e 'tis a natural agent, not acting from a principle of liberty but of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remain idle) having no extraventitious matter to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily con<U+017F>ume the laudable juices of the body, drying up the <U+017F>ame during <U+017F>leep. For whereas <U+017F>leep is <U+017F>aid to moi<U+017F>ten, whence aro<U+017F>e the Proverb, <hi>Qui dort mange</hi>; He that <U+017F>leeps, eats; 'tis true, when the <U+017F>tomach and entrals being fill'd with <U+017F>ufficient nouri<U+017F>hment, the Heat rai<U+017F>es and di<U+017F>per<U+017F>es to all the parts the pure<U+017F>t of the juices and vapours like gentle dews; which it cannot do when the Stomach is empty.</p>
            <p>The fourth <U+017F>aid, Nature having given us an Appetite to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verti<U+017F>e us of the need of all parts, there is no certainer rule of the time of Repa<U+017F>t than this Appetite, which for this rea<U+017F>on is <U+017F>eated in the upper Orifice of the Stomach, render'd <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible by the Nerves of the <U+017F>ixth Pair terminating therein. For there is a continual di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation of our <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance in all the parts, which being exhau<U+017F>ted attract from their neighbours wherewith to fill their own emptine<U+017F>s: the<U+017F>e <U+017F>olicit the Liver, for <U+017F>upply; that, the Guts by the Me<U+017F>araick Veins: the<U+017F>e the Stomack, at the top whereof this <U+017F>uction terminates, the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e or perception whereof is call'd Appetite; which, if of hot and dry, is call'd Hunger; if of cold and moi<U+017F>t, Thir<U+017F>t. So that Nutrition being onely to recruit and repair the lo<U+017F>s of our Sub<U+017F>tance, there is no more a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ured <U+017F>ign of the fitting time to eat, then when the <U+017F>aid Appetite is mo<U+017F>t eager, at what hour <U+017F>oever it be.</p>
            <p>The fifth <U+017F>aid, That this might have place in well temper'd bodies which de<U+017F>ire onely <U+017F>o much as they are able to dige<U+017F>t, but not in tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e Appetite is greater than their Dige<U+017F>tion, as cold and melancholy Stomacks; or who de<U+017F>ire le<U+017F>s, as the hot and bilious, who<U+017F>e heat melting the juices, abates the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; as on the contrary, Coldne<U+017F>s contracting the membranes of the Stomack, augments it: So that 'tis mo<U+017F>t expedient for every one to con<U+017F>ult his own Temper, Age, Nature, and Cu<U+017F>tom of living; Old people, little Children, <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>ubject to Defluxions, or have weak Stomacks, mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>up <U+017F>paringly; on the other <U+017F>ide, the Cholerick, and <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>ubject to the Head-ach, mu<U+017F>t eat a larger Supper than Dinner: But above all, the Cu<U+017F>tom of every particular per<U+017F>on is mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable herein.</p>

            <p>MAn being compos'd of two Pieces, Body and Soul, and upon that account <U+017F>tyl'd by <hi>Tri<U+017F>megi<U+017F>tus,</hi> The Horizon of the Univer<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e he unites in him<U+017F>elf the <U+017F>piritual nature with the Corporeal, the Inclinations whereof are different; he hath al<U+017F>o need of two guides to conduct tho<U+017F>e two Parts (the Rational and the Animal) and make them know the Good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which they are carried of their own Nature. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect makes him <U+017F>ee the Hone<U+017F>t and Spiritual Good; the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination enables him to conceive a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and corporeal Good. And as the Rational Appetite (which is the <hi>Will</hi>) follows the light afforded to it by the Intellect in pur<U+017F>uit of Hone<U+017F>t Good, whence Vertue ari<U+017F>eth; <U+017F>o the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive Appetite is carri'd to the enjoyment of <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Good which the Imagination makes it conceive as profitable and plea<U+017F>ant, and that by motions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <U+017F>o di<U+017F>orderly and violent that they make impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion not only upon the Mind, but upon the Body, who<U+017F>e Oeconomy they di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>e; and for this rea<U+017F>on they are call'd Pa<U+017F>sions or Perturbations, and Affections of the Mind. The<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F>sions either are carri'd towards Good and Evil <U+017F>imply, as <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi>; the fir<U+017F>t inclining us to Good which is the Parent of Beauty, the latter averting us from Evil: or el<U+017F>e they con<U+017F>ider both Good and Evil Ab<U+017F>ent, as <hi>De<U+017F>ire</hi> and <hi>Flight:</hi> or La<U+017F>tly, they con<U+017F>ider them being pre<U+017F>ent, and cau<U+017F>e <hi>Plea<U+017F>ure</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi>; which, if of longer duration, produce Joy and Sadne<U+017F>s. Now becau<U+017F>e difficulties frequently occurr in the pur<U+017F>uit of Cood and flight of Evil, therefore Nature not contented to have indu'd Animals with a Concupi<U+017F>cible Appetite, which by means of the <U+017F>ix above-mention'd Pa<U+017F>sions might be carri'd towards Good, and avoid Evil; hath al<U+017F>o given them another Appetite call'd Ira<U+017F>cible, to <U+017F>urmount the Ob<U+017F>tacles occurring in the pur<U+017F>uit of Good or flight of Evil; whence ari<U+017F>e five other Pa<U+017F>sions, <hi>Hope, De<U+017F>pair, Boldne<U+017F>s, Fear,</hi> and <hi>Anger.</hi> Hope excites the <U+017F>oul to the pro<U+017F>ecution of a difficult but obtainable good. De<U+017F>pair checks the motions of the <U+017F>oul towards the pur<U+017F>uit of a Good no longer obtainable. Boldne<U+017F>s regards an ab<U+017F>ent Evil, which a<U+017F><U+017F>ures it <U+017F>elf able to <U+017F>urmount. Fear con<U+017F>iders the <U+017F>ame ab<U+017F>ent Evil without any means of being able to avoid it. La<U+017F>tly, the violence of Anger is bent again<U+017F>t a pre<U+017F>ent Evil, whereof it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a po<U+017F>sibility to be reveng'd. And becau<U+017F>e a pre<U+017F>ent and enjoyed Good cannot be accompani'd with difficulty; hence there is no Pa<U+017F>sion in the Ira<U+017F>cible Appetite an<U+017F>wering to Anger, as there is in the other Pa<U+017F>sions: which again are divided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <U+017F>everal objects about which they are exercis'd.

The de<U+017F>ire of Honours is call'd Ambition; that of Riches, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s; that of fle<U+017F>hly Plea<U+017F>ures, Concupi<U+017F>cence; that of Meats, Gourmandi<U+017F>e or Gluttony. The Hatred of Vice cau<U+017F>es Zeal; that of a Rival, Jealou<U+017F>ie. The <U+017F>orrow ari<U+017F>ing upon the <U+017F>ight of Evil <U+017F>uffer'd by an unde<U+017F>erving per<U+017F>on, cau<U+017F>es Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F>sion; Indignation proceeds from the happening of Good to one that merits it not. Now, among all the<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which aims at a general <U+017F>uperiority, <U+017F>eems to me the fir<U+017F>t; and <U+017F>ince it hath <U+017F>erv'd to excu<U+017F>e Parricides and Violators of the publick faith, whom it hath caus'd to <U+017F>ay, that for the <U+017F>ake of command nothing is unju<U+017F>t, it may very well be excus'd every where el<U+017F>e; be<U+017F>ides that, it hath been the in<U+017F>tigator to the mo<U+017F>t glorious Actions, the <U+017F>ource whereof is that laudable Ambition which every one hath to out-vie his companion.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, If the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions are Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Soul, as the Stoicks held, and the Que<U+017F>tion <U+017F>eems to pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none more agreeable and excu<U+017F>able than Love; who<U+017F>e <U+017F>weet violence in<U+017F>inuating into the <U+017F>evere<U+017F>t bre<U+017F>ts, finds nothing capable to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t it. Hence tho<U+017F>e that are taken with it, wi<U+017F>h nothing le<U+017F>s than a cure, which cannot proceed but from obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion of the thing belov'd, wherein they live more than in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves: the <U+017F>oul being more where it loves than in the body wherein it lives. Moreover, this Pa<U+017F>sion is the mo<U+017F>t natural and common of all, and con<U+017F>equently, the mo<U+017F>t excu<U+017F>able; being found not only in all men, but al<U+017F>o in all Animals, who feel the a<U+017F><U+017F>aults of Love, which makes them naturally tend towards Good. And as Love is the mo<U+017F>t common, <U+017F>o it is likewi<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ource and principle of all the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions: for we neither hate nor fear any thing, we have neither joy, <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s, de<U+017F>ire, fear, nor anger, but becau<U+017F>e we love <U+017F>omething: the true cour<U+017F>e to become exempt from the<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, being, To love No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>The third <U+017F>aid, That the mo<U+017F>t violent Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions being the mo<U+017F>t excu<U+017F>able becau<U+017F>e the harde<U+017F>t to <U+017F>ubdue, tho<U+017F>e of the Ira<U+017F>cible Appetite (particularly Anger) being more vehement than tho<U+017F>e of the Concupi<U+017F>cible Appetite, are al<U+017F>o the mo<U+017F>t worthy of excu<U+017F>e. The former po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the noble<U+017F>t part of Man, the Heart, which is the <U+017F>ource of Anger; the latter, the Liver which is the <U+017F>eat of Love; who<U+017F>e weakne<U+017F>s the Poets have <U+017F>ufficiently demon<U+017F>trated by repre<U+017F>enting it to us under the form of a Child, which hath no power over us but what we <U+017F>uffer it to take. But Anger which is proper to the Generous, as Love is to the weak and effeminate, makes it <U+017F>elf ma<U+017F>ter of the Soul; and by its <U+017F>udden and impetuous motions ob<U+017F>curing the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, makes us the more excu<U+017F>able in that we are no longer ma<U+017F>ters of our own actions. And as Madne<U+017F>s excu<U+017F>es the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick from blame and puni<U+017F>hment, <U+017F>o Anger which is a <U+017F>hort Madne<U+017F>s, as the Poet <U+017F>aith, de<U+017F>erves the <U+017F>ame excu<U+017F>e; its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence being <U+017F>o much above that of all other Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, that it is

the mo<U+017F>t quick and pa<U+017F><U+017F>es like Lightning: for when it takes root in the <U+017F>oul, it lo<U+017F>es its name, and degenerates into Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That he was for Joy, becau<U+017F>e all the other Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions acknowledg its power <U+017F>uch, that they are contented to be its <U+017F>ervants; Love and De<U+017F>ire are only in order to <U+017F>ome hoped Joy; Hatred and Flight, only to remove all objects that may trouble it. De<U+017F>pair then only <U+017F>eizes us, when we can no longer hope for Joy; Hope is for it alone; Fear is only of what is contrary to it; Boldne<U+017F>s, to break through all Ob<U+017F>tacles op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ing our contentment; and Anger <U+017F>erves to expre<U+017F>s the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ure we re<U+017F>ent for its delay or interruption.

And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Contraries are known by their Contraries, <U+017F>ince nothing di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>es us <U+017F>o much as Sadne<U+017F>s, nothing plea<U+017F>es us <U+017F>o much as Joy; who<U+017F>e violence is manife<U+017F>ted by <U+017F>ome that have dy'd of it, as none ever did of Anger. In fine, we cannot better prove and approve the power and empire of any one than by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <U+017F>ubjects, as we all are of Joy; to which the greate<U+017F>t part not only give part of their time, but al<U+017F>o quit the mo<U+017F>t impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affairs to <U+017F>eek it in places de<U+017F>tinated to the god of Laughter; who<U+017F>e Fe<U+017F>tivals are now more frequen then in in the days of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puleius.</hi> And what makes us in youth bear and endure all the pains of <U+017F>tudy; Apprentices of each Trade, the hard<U+017F>hips which they undergo; Soldiers, the danger of Death, but a pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hope of Joy? which he that po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es, becomes <U+017F>o ma<U+017F>ter'd by it, that he forgets all his pa<U+017F>t evils: The Mariner no longer remembers the perils of the <U+017F>ea, nor the <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on his pains; In <U+017F>hort, every one <U+017F>uffers him<U+017F>elf to be po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>'d and govern'd by this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which is therefore the mo<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>able.</p>

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the accents of the Voice which te<U+017F>tifie Grief or Sadne<U+017F>s are much more violent than tho<U+017F>e of Joy; which being nothing el<U+017F>e but a bare complacency receiv'd in the enjoyment of Good, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts rather in re<U+017F>t then in motion, whereof Grief partakes more largely by the endeavours which it cau<U+017F>eth the <U+017F>oul to put forth for removing of what torments it.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXXIV. Which is the mo<U+017F>t laudable Temperament.</head>
            <p>TEmperament is the Harmony and Proportion of the four fir<U+017F>t Qualities, re<U+017F>ulting from the mixture of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof all <U+017F>ublunary Bodies are compounded; which being de<U+017F>tinated to <U+017F>everal ends, requir'd therefore different Tempers and Qualifications. Now although the diver<U+017F>ity herein be almo<U+017F>t infinite, yet it may be reduc'd to three Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Heads. For either the four Qualities are <U+017F>o mix'd that they remain in an equal proportion; or one of them excels the re<U+017F>t; or el<U+017F>e two together have the advantage. The fir<U+017F>t makes the Temperament equal; the two latter make it unequal. The equal Temperament is two-fold; one call'd Temperament by <hi>Weight (ad Pondus,</hi> as they <U+017F>peak) when the qualities are <U+017F>o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly proportionate, that, could they be weigh'd in a balance, not one would preponderate above another: (Under<U+017F>tand this Equalne<U+017F>s, only of Qualities, not of Elements; for were there as much Fire as Water, as much Air as Earth, the more active fire would con<U+017F>ume the re<U+017F>t and reduce into a<U+017F>hes all living things; who<U+017F>e di<U+017F><U+017F>olution <U+017F>hews us that they con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t more of Earth and Water then of the other Elements. The other, call'd Temperament according to <hi>Ju<U+017F>tice,</hi> is found in every <U+017F>ort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound-<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances; among<U+017F>t which there is one that <U+017F>erves for the rule or <U+017F>tandard to all individuals compris'd under it, and po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es in perfection the temper require requi<U+017F>ite to the functions of its nature. Thus among<U+017F>t Animals the Lyon is hot, the Swine moi<U+017F>t, the Salamander cold, the Bee dry: but Man is temperate, and among<U+017F>t his parts the Bones, Cartilages, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments are cold and dry; the Blood, Spirits, Mu<U+017F>cles, Heart and Liver are hot and moi<U+017F>t; the Brain, Phlegm and Fat are cold and moi<U+017F>t; each of them being temper'd according to Ju<U+017F>tice. The Skin alone, e<U+017F>pecially that in the Palm of a well-temper'd mans hand, being moderate in all the Qualities and <U+017F>eeming a texture of the Fle<U+017F>h and Nerves, is equally cold and hot, <U+017F>oft and hard, and con<U+017F>equently the prime Organ of Touch, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66371:83"/>
the judge of all other Temperaments. The unequal Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (which neverthele<U+017F>s lyes within the latitude of Health) is either <U+017F>imple or compound. The former (wherein one of the four Qualities prevails over its contrary, while the other two remain in a mediocrity) is of four <U+017F>orts, Hot, Cold, Dry, and Moi<U+017F>t. The <U+017F>econd, (wherein two excell) is likewi<U+017F>e of four <U+017F>orts according to the four combinations which the qualities ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; <hi>viz.</hi> Hot and Moi<U+017F>t, Hot and Dry, Cold and Moi<U+017F>t, Cold and Dry: for Hot and Cold, Dry and Moi<U+017F>t, cannot <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in one and the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject. And though the heat ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly con<U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moi<U+017F>ture, and the cold collecting plenty of humid excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hinder the hot and moi<U+017F>t, and cold and dry tempers from <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting long in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tate; yet they may continue therein for <U+017F>ome time, though they become chang'd by <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ages. Now of the nine <U+017F>orts of Tempers, to wit, the four <U+017F>imple, four compound, and one perfectly temperate, this la<U+017F>t <U+017F>eems to me the mo<U+017F>t laudable and perfect; a body thus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd being neither fat nor lean, hot nor cold, dry nor moi<U+017F>t, but of a <U+017F>quare and indifferently fle<U+017F>hy con<U+017F>titution, not inclining to one extream more then another, being in an exqui<U+017F>ite medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, and con<U+017F>equently more laudable then any of tho<U+017F>e which approach nearer the (always vicious) extreams.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, If there be <U+017F>uch an exqui<U+017F>ite Temperament as rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>eems to demon<U+017F>trate, then <U+017F>ince there is no pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing from one extream to another but by the middle; when a Child changes the heat and moi<U+017F>ture of his infancy into the cold and dryne<U+017F>s of old-age, that middle equal Temper mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s away as <U+017F>wift as lightning, and it's duration will be almo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ible. Wherefore though it be the mo<U+017F>t perfect and de<U+017F>ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet <U+017F>ince 'tis only the <U+017F>tandard and rule of all others, I am for Hot and Moi<U+017F>t, as mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>utable to life, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in tho<U+017F>e two qualities; as Death, and its forerunner Old-age, are cold and dry. This is the Temperament of Child-hood, allotted to us by Nature at the beginning of our life; and therefore the mo<U+017F>t perfect, an<U+017F>wering to the Spring (the mo<U+017F>t temperate of Sea<U+017F>ons) and to Blood (the mo<U+017F>t temperate humour) whence 'tis call'd Sanguine; as the cold and dry, is Melancholick; the hot and dry, Bilious; the cold and moi<U+017F>t, Phlegmatick. Which is not to be under<U+017F>tood of the excrementitious but of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural humours contain'd in the ma<U+017F>s of Blood, which follow the principles of our Generation. Moreover, 'tis proper not only for the functions of life, whereof health is the foundation, and joy the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>weet <U+017F>upport, which the Blood produces, (as Melancholy doth <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s, Phlegm <U+017F>lothfulne<U+017F>s; Bile, fury and anger) but al<U+017F>o for tho<U+017F>e of the Mind, which depending upon the purene<U+017F>s of the Animal Spirits, (as the<U+017F>e do upon that of the Vital and Natural) which are more benigne in the Sanguine, their conceptions mu<U+017F>t be likewi<U+017F>e more clear and refin'd.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, If Heat and Moi<U+017F>ture are <U+017F>utable to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66371:83"/>
of the Vegetative Soul, (Generation, Accretion, and Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) they are no le<U+017F>s prejudicial to tho<U+017F>e of the Rational, the <U+017F>eat whereof is therefore remote from the two Organs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, the Ventricle and the Liver; le<U+017F>t the fumes of the Food coming to be mix'd with the Animal Spirits might offu<U+017F>cate and cloud the phanta<U+017F>ms and ideas wherewith tho<U+017F>e Spirits are charged, and con<U+017F>equently hinder the operations of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding, which depend upon tho<U+017F>e phanta<U+017F>ms <U+017F>o long as it is linked to the Body. For all Souls being alike, their operations differ only according to the diver<U+017F>e temper of the Brain, which cau<U+017F>es that of the Animal Spirits, which mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ubtle and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, but not <U+017F>o far as to be igneous (like tho<U+017F>e of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick and frantick, who<U+017F>e motions are precipitate and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) but in the ju<U+017F>t proportion ob<U+017F>erv'd in the Melancholick temper, which being cold and dry (that is to <U+017F>ay, le<U+017F>s hot and moi<U+017F>t) is mo<U+017F>t proper for Prudence and Wi<U+017F>dom, which require a <U+017F>etled compos'd Spirit, like that of old men, who owe not their Wi<U+017F>dom <U+017F>o much to the experience of many years, as to the coldne<U+017F>s and dryne<U+017F>s of their Brains, which makes men grave and <U+017F>edate. All brave men have been of this temper, which gives patience and con<U+017F>tancy, without which nothing grand and con<U+017F>iderable can ever be perform'd. And as the hot and moi<U+017F>t temper is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject to corruption, <U+017F>o by the rea<U+017F>on of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the cold and moi<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t be lea<U+017F>t obnoxious to di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es (as among<U+017F>t Trees and Animals, the drye<U+017F>t and harde<U+017F>t are lea<U+017F>t of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by external injuries) upon which account the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not only mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>irable, but al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e it mo<U+017F>t contents the mind of him that po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es it, who being at his ea<U+017F>e makes more reflection upon the benefit he injoys, unle<U+017F>s otherwi<U+017F>e diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by contemplation.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That that is the mo<U+017F>t laudable temper which is mo<U+017F>t adapted to the functions both of body and mind; between which there is <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>proportion, that what agrees well with the one, <U+017F>eems prejudicial to the other. The Sanguine is the mo<U+017F>t excellent for the operations of life and good habit of Body, but incommodious for tho<U+017F>e of the Mind; partly through the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s and mildne<U+017F>s of that humour which cannot <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>trong attention, and partly through its exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive humidity, which filling the Imagination with vapours cannot <U+017F>upply fit matter to the Animal Spirits, who<U+017F>e temper mu<U+017F>t be dry for producing Wi<U+017F>dom, whereunto Melancholy is by <U+017F>ome judg'd conducible; but were it <U+017F>o, 'tis too contrary to the health and good con<U+017F>titution of the body to be de<U+017F>irable. The phlegmatick temper is proper neither for the health of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nor the goodne<U+017F>s of Wit. But the Bilious is for both; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing le<U+017F>s repleat then the Sanguine, and le<U+017F>s attenuated and dry'd then the melancholick, be<U+017F>ides very nimble and dextrous through the plenty of <U+017F>pirits; and as 'tis ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>order'd, <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e 'tis re<U+017F>tor'd in a little time; its maladies being the <U+017F>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66371:84"/>
Moreover, its vivacity is much more de<U+017F>irable then the heavine<U+017F>s and lumpi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s attending the Melancholy and making the Vulgar think them Sage and prudent though they are only <U+017F>o in appearance: whereas the Cholerick are Indu<U+017F>trious and Courageous, accompli<U+017F>hing whatever they attempt; and as among<U+017F>t Bea<U+017F>ts and Birds the noble Lyon and Eagle are of this complexion, and according to <U+017F>ome our fir<U+017F>t Parent <hi>Adam</hi> (which <U+017F>ignifies Red) was in hair and temper bilious; whence perhaps al<U+017F>o Man is call'd in the <U+017F>ame language <hi>I<U+017F>h,</hi> which <U+017F>igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Fire, whereof choler partakes.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That indeed his readine<U+017F>s to obey his Wife was an effect of that Temper, of which he <U+017F>eems rather to have been then of that laudable and perfectly temperate one which our Saviour enjoy'd. But indeed, Tempers being the principles of all our functions, which mu<U+017F>t be different in every individual, are de<U+017F>irable according to the Places, Sea<U+017F>ons, Employments, Age, Sex, and Inclinations of every one in particular.</p>

            <p>THree <U+017F>orts of effects are ob<U+017F>erv'd in Nature. Some ari<U+017F>e always nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily, as the vici<U+017F><U+017F>itudes of Days, Nights and Sea<U+017F>ons, which depend upon the motion of the Stars, no more alterable without a miracle then the other effects of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>al Nature. Others come to pa<U+017F>s often but not always; the particular nature which produces them being <U+017F>ometimes hindred by <U+017F>ome accident, which makes it bring forth Mon<U+017F>ters. The la<U+017F>t happen neither always nor often but <U+017F>eldom; as all tho<U+017F>e which depend upon contingent cau<U+017F>es, which are of two <U+017F>orts. The fir<U+017F>t act by a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of nature, without any election: The <U+017F>econd by a principle of liberty without choice or delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Both, when they produce an effect contrary to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and primary de<U+017F>ign, are called fortuitous cau<U+017F>es.

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Diver<U+017F>ity is no where more apparent than in humane Actions, the incertainty and incon<U+017F>tancy whereof is <U+017F>uch, that men rarely arrive at their propo<U+017F>ed end, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes behold them<U+017F>elves either exalted to an unhoped degree of Felicity, or overwhelmed with the Mi<U+017F>ery which there was no ground to apprehend. Which diver<U+017F>ity of accidents, induced Super<U+017F>titious Antiquity, to <U+017F>et up a blind and flitting Deity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant onely in her incon<U+017F>tancy, whom they held the cau<U+017F>e of all <U+017F>uch effects; thus betaking them<U+017F>elves to an imaginary can<U+017F>e, in regard they could not, or would not acknowledg the true; which I attribute to every ones temperament, by means of which is produced in the Soul a certain natural motion and impetuo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for obtaining <U+017F>ome particular thing, without Rea<U+017F>ons contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting thereunto; and according as a Man follows or re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts the<U+017F>e in<U+017F>tincts and inclinations, <U+017F>o he proves either happy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. Thus he who finds him<U+017F>elf di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to Arms, if he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, thrives better than in a <U+017F>oft and <U+017F>edentary life, whereunto the Melaneholly per<U+017F>on is more addicted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pers better herein. Now becau<U+017F>e dull <U+017F>pirits, fools, and thick-<U+017F>kull'd fellows, ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>uffer them<U+017F>elves to be guided by tho<U+017F>e motions; therefore they commonly prove more fortunate than the wi<U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e Prudence and Di<U+017F>cretion cau<U+017F>ing them to make abundance of reflections upon what they undertake, cau<U+017F>es them al<U+017F>o to lo<U+017F>e opportunities which never return.

Riches, wherein mo<U+017F>t Men place their Felicity, were ca<U+017F>t into the Sea by a Philo<U+017F>opher, that he might the better attend Contemplation. Honors and Plea<U+017F>ures, (charms, which mo<U+017F>t powerfully inveigle mo<U+017F>t of Man-kind) are cro<U+017F><U+017F>es and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to <U+017F>ome others.

Life, the foundation of all goods, hath been <U+017F>o tedious to <U+017F>ome, that to be deliver'd from it they have kill'd them<U+017F>elves; and the pains, afflictions, and di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es leading to death, are, in the <hi>Stoicks</hi> account, but imaginary Evils, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon the wi<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, Since Happine<U+017F>s and Unhappine<U+017F>s <U+017F>eem to be the Elements, compo<U+017F>ing the Political Life of Men, and the two Poles of that Globe upon which the Antients plac'd Fortune, their Con<U+017F>ideration may be taken two ways, either in their Cau<U+017F>e, or in their Effect. As for the fir<U+017F>t, the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>ht a Fate governing All by a Series of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary and determinate Events, were as impious as <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Leucippus,</hi> who, on the contrary, maintain'd that all things were done by Chance in the Univer<U+017F>e, which, they <U+017F>aid, it <U+017F>elf was made by the ca<U+017F>ual occour<U+017F>e of their Atoms; the<U+017F>e denying the Providence of God, tho<U+017F>e his Power, by <U+017F>ubjecting and tying him to the immutable Laws of Fatality. But without con<U+017F>idering things in reference to God, to whom every thing is pre<U+017F>ent and certain, we may di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h them into two <U+017F>orts. Some acting nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily, have alwayes their nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary effects: others, which depend ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Man's Will, which is free and indifferent, have accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Effects incertain and contingent. Thus the accidents of the Sea, (where the vulgar believes is the chief Empire of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune), natural deaths, the births of poor and rich, have regular and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Cau<U+017F>es. On the contrary, Goods freely given, or acquir'd with little indu<U+017F>try, or found, have contingent Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es; which being almo<U+017F>t infinite, (for there is no Cau<U+017F>e by it <U+017F>elf, but may be a Cau<U+017F>e by accident, by producing another thing than what was intended) they cannot fall within the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Humane Wit, which knows onely what is finite and terminate. Other Events have Cau<U+017F>es mixt of Chance and Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, as the death of the Poet <hi>Ae<U+017F>chylus,</hi> hapning by a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toi<U+017F>e which an Eagle let fall upon his bald Head. As for the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond manner wherein Happine<U+017F>s may be con<U+017F>ider'd, namely, Whether it render us happy in Reality or in Imagination; 'tis an accu<U+017F>ing all Men of folly, to <U+017F>ay that Felicity is imaginary and phanta<U+017F>tical; <U+017F>ince Nature, which hath given no De<U+017F>ire in vain,

Moreover, 'twould be as ab<U+017F>urd to call a Man happy or unhappy becau<U+017F>e he thinks him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o; as to believe a fool is a King, or Rich, becau<U+017F>e he phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ies him<U+017F>elf to have Empires and Riches.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXXVI. Of the Original of Precious Stones.</head>
            <p>A Stone, which is defin'd a Fo<U+017F><U+017F>ile, hard, dry, and frangible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is either common or precious. Both are compounded of the Four Elements, chiefly of Water and Earth, but diver<U+017F>ly proportion'd and elaborated. Coar<U+017F>e Stones are made with le<U+017F>s preparation, their proximate matter being onely much Earth and little Water, whereof is made a <U+017F>ort of Clay, which being dry'd by Nature, is hardned into a Stone. Precious Stones have more of Water, and le<U+017F>s of Earth, both very pure and <U+017F>imple, (whence proceeds their Lu<U+017F>tre, which attends the <U+017F>implicity of the Elements) and exactly mixt by Heat, which concocting the aqueous humidity, purifies and <U+017F>ublimes the <U+017F>ame to a mo<U+017F>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect degree by help of that Univer<U+017F>al Spirit, where-with the Earth and whole world is fill'd, on which account the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> e<U+017F>teemed it a great Animal.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Three things are to be con<U+017F>ider'd in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the original of Stones; their matter, their efficient cau<U+017F>e, and the place of their generation. Their remote mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is Earth and Water, which two Elements alone give bulk
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66371:86"/>
and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence: but their next matter, (concern'd in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion) is a certain lapidifick juice, <U+017F>upplying the place of Seed, and often ob<U+017F>erv'd dropping down from rocks; which, if thick and vi<U+017F>cous, makes common <U+017F>tones; if <U+017F>ubtil and pure, the precious. Now this juice not only is turn'd it <U+017F>elf into <U+017F>tone, but likewi<U+017F>e turns almo<U+017F>t all other Bodies, as Wood, Fruits, Fi<U+017F>hes, the Fle<U+017F>h of Animals, and <U+017F>uch other things, which are petrifi'd in certain Waters and Caves. Their remote efficient cau<U+017F>e is Heat, which <U+017F>evering heterogeneous bodies unites tho<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ame nature, whereof it makes the <U+017F>aid homogeneous juice, which is condens'd by cold; which giving the la<U+017F>t form and perfection to the <U+017F>tone is its proximate efficient cau<U+017F>e. La<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their place is every where; in the middle region of the Air, which produces Thunder-bolts; in the Sea, which affords Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, (of a middle nature between Stone and Plant) and Pearls in their <U+017F>hells which are their wombs, by means of the Dew of Heaven; in Animals, in Plants and above all in the Earth and its Mines or Matrices which are clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>paces exempt from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of Air, Water, or other external Agents, which might hinder their production either by intermixtion of <U+017F>ome extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body, or by <U+017F>uffering the Mineral Spirits <U+017F>erving to the ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration of the Stones to tran<U+017F>pire.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Precious Stones, produc'd for Ornament, (as Metals are for U<U+017F>e of life), are of three <U+017F>orts; namely, either bright and re<U+017F>plendent, as the Diamond, Ruby, Cry<U+017F>tal, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy<U+017F>t; or a little ob<U+017F>cure, as the Turquois, Ja<U+017F>per, and other middle ones without perfect lu<U+017F>tre, as the Opal and all Pearls. And as the matter of common Stones is Earth the principle of Darkne<U+017F>s; <U+017F>o that of the precious is an aqueous diaphanous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, congeal'd by the coldne<U+017F>s of water or earth, or by the vicinity of Ice and Snow which inviron Mountains and Rocks, where commonly their Mines are found; and among<U+017F>t others, Cry<U+017F>tal which is (as 'twere) the fir<U+017F>t matter of other precious Stones, and the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ay of Nature (when <U+017F>he de<U+017F>igns to inclo<U+017F>e her Maje<U+017F>ty in the lu<U+017F>tre of the mo<U+017F>t glittering Jewels) is nothing el<U+017F>e but humidity condens'd by cold. Whence a violent heat, <U+017F>uch as that of Furnaces, re<U+017F>olves and melts it. Moreover, the effects attributed to the<U+017F>e Stones, as to <U+017F>top blood, allay the fumes of wine, and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t hot poy<U+017F>ons, argue them caus'd only by cold, which al<U+017F>o gives them weight by conden<U+017F>ation of their parts.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, If Cry<U+017F>tals and Stones were produc'd only by cold, they could not be generated in the I<U+017F>les of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the red Sea and other Southern parts, but only in the Northern, where neverthele<U+017F>s they are mo<U+017F>t rare, there being Mountains where cold hath pre<U+017F>erv'd Ice for divers Ages without ever being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Cry<U+017F>tal; which (be<U+017F>ides) <U+017F>hould <U+017F>wim upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well as Ice doth, and not be more heavy and tran<U+017F>parent: which cannot be attributed to their greater den<U+017F>ity, caus'd by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66371:86"/>
a more vehement cold; <U+017F>ince water in<U+017F>pi<U+017F><U+017F>ated into Ice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes le<U+017F>s tran<U+017F>parent, and Cry<U+017F>tals are not <U+017F>o cold to the touch as Ice. But above all, their Calcination evidently <U+017F>hews that there is <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e in them be<U+017F>ides Water; for finding out of which, we mu<U+017F>t examine the principles of Bodies neare<U+017F>t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to them; as Alom and Gla<U+017F>s, which by their <U+017F>plendor and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, much re<U+017F>emble precious Stones, being (like them) Mineral Juices hardned and mixt by a proportionate quantity of Salts and violent Spirits, which joyned together, lo<U+017F>e their Acrimony to embrace one another more clo<U+017F>ely: The<U+017F>e Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are very vi<U+017F>cous, capable of great <U+017F>olidity, and being of them<U+017F>elves tran<U+017F>parent, are proper to pre<U+017F>erve all the brightne<U+017F>s and light, which their <U+017F>pecifick forms can add to them. This re<U+017F>emblance being <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, we are obliged to di<U+017F>cover the <U+017F>ame Principles of Compo<U+017F>ition in Jewels; <U+017F>ince things agreeing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, and having re<U+017F>emblance of qualities, agree al<U+017F>o as to matters, and have nothing to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h them but that unknown Form which determines the Species. But the truth is, little brightne<U+017F>s and hardne<U+017F>s proceed not from their Form alone, which is uncapable of <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e connexion, but from much dark Earth, and a very impure Phlegm; which is not found in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, or in the Gla<U+017F>s where-with in the <hi>Indies</hi> they make Emeralds. Moreover, 'tis this body that mo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>embles tho<U+017F>e Stones, which hath no other Principles but a Spirit mingled among<U+017F>t much Salt, and <U+017F>ome little of Earth; which are united by the activity of heat, and conden<U+017F>ed by their natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to in<U+017F>pi<U+017F><U+017F>ation, (cold contributing but very little thereunto, <U+017F>ince they acquire their <U+017F>olidity and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence whil<U+017F>t yet very hot.) The Artifice of counterfeiting Rubies and Diamonds, with the <U+017F>ame Principles of Gla<U+017F>s, greatly confirms this Opinion; onely for avoiding brittlene<U+017F>s, they mix le<U+017F>s terre<U+017F>treity, and con<U+017F>ume not the moi<U+017F>ture, (which cau<U+017F>es Concretion) with <U+017F>o much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The Calcination of Cry<U+017F>tals, whereby much Salt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from them, and the ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of making Gla<U+017F>s there-with, in like manner <U+017F>hews what are the Material Principles of the<U+017F>e Stones. Which Principles being contained, or generated in the bo<U+017F>ome of the Earth, certain Juices are formed of their <U+017F>everal mixtures, which unite to the fir<U+017F>t body which happens to impre<U+017F>s its Virtues upon them; then the pure<U+017F>t part of the<U+017F>e Salts and Earths, is volatilized by the Spirit mixt there-with, and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Heat, which alwayes perfects it by further Concoction, till it have rendered it Homogeneous. The<U+017F>e Juices common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>tick in <U+017F>uperficial parts of the Earth, where a moderate heat fini<U+017F>hes their Concoction, evaporating, the too great humidity which hinder'd the induration natural to <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <U+017F>pecies are made according to the different impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Heaven, or the place of their Generation, or other di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions; to which I al<U+017F>o refer the diver<U+017F>ity of their Colours, and not (as mo<U+017F>t Chymi<U+017F>ts do) to Sulphur, which is never found in the<U+017F>e

            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, 'Tis mo<U+017F>t probable that in the beginning there were Species of Stones of all <U+017F>orts, di<U+017F>pos'd in places mo<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for their Con<U+017F>ervation, which have continually generated the like, determining fit matter by the Emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a certain Vapor or Spirit, impregnated with the Character of their Species during its union with their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, before a perfect, induration pre<U+017F>s'd it forth; which Spirit lighting upon, and uniting to fit Matter, fixes and determines the <U+017F>ame to be of the <U+017F>ame Species, with the Ma<U+017F>s from which it i<U+017F><U+017F>u'd. For the common Opinion, That the<U+017F>e Stones are produc'd of a certain <U+017F>lime, compounded of Earth and Water, concocted and hardned by the action of Heat, is groundle<U+017F>s; <U+017F>ince how temperate <U+017F>oever that Heat were, it would at length di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate all the moi<U+017F>ture, and leave nothing but the Earth, the darke<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t friable of all the Elements; be<U+017F>ides that, Water and Earth, having no vi<U+017F>co<U+017F>ity, are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any continuity and hardne<U+017F>s, which ari<U+017F>es from Salt, which indu'd with a Principle of Coagulation, perfectly unites the Water with the Earth, <U+017F>o as not to be afterwards di<U+017F><U+017F>olvable by any Water, but <U+017F>uch as is mix'd with much Salt. La<U+017F>tly, the Cement they make with Lime, Water, and Sand, petrifying in time, <U+017F>hews the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of the fix'd Salt of Lime, (which gives the coherence of all) in the generation of Stones. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, that as in common and opake Stones, there is a little Salt among<U+017F>t much Earth; <U+017F>o in tho<U+017F>e which are precious, there is much Salt among<U+017F>t a very <U+017F>mall quantity of Earth.</p>

            <p>MEtal, which is a Mineral, <U+017F>olid, opake, heavy, malleable, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctile, and <U+017F>ounding body, is compounded either by Nature, Art, or Chance, as, Latin, Electrum, and Corinthian Bra<U+017F>s; or el<U+017F>e it is <U+017F>imple, and divided into <U+017F>even Species, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Planets, whereunto each of them is referr'd, as precious Stones are to the Fixed Starrs; namely, Gold, Silver, Lead, Copper, Iron, Tinn; and Quick-<U+017F>ilver, which others reject, from the number of Metals, becau<U+017F>e not malleable; as al<U+017F>o Tinn, becau<U+017F>e compounded of Lead and Silver. Their remote Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is much Water with little Earth; their next, according to <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> a vaporous exhalation. Their general Efficient Cau<U+017F>e is Heaven, by its Motion and Influencess producing Heat, which attenuates and concocts the <U+017F>aid Exhalation, which is afterwards
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66371:87"/>
condens'd by Cold: Hence all Metals are melted by violent Fire, which evaporates Quick-<U+017F>ilver, and <U+017F>oftens that <U+017F>ort of Iron which is not fu<U+017F>ible. The place where they are generated is the bo<U+017F>ome of the Earth; the Metals found in Waters, as Gold in <hi>Tagus</hi> and <hi>Pactolus,</hi> having been carry'd from the Earth by the Waters; which wa<U+017F>hing and purifying them, render them more perfect than tho<U+017F>e of the Mines.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Although Metals were generated at the beginning of the world in their Mines, whence they were fir<U+017F>t extracted and wrought by Tubalcain, who is the fabulous Vulcan of Pagani<U+017F>m; yet they cea<U+017F>e not to be generated anew by the afflux of <U+017F>utable Matter, which is a metallick Juice form'd of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, not <U+017F>imply aqueous, (for then Heat <U+017F>hould evaporate in<U+017F>tead of concocting it) but vi<U+017F>cous, unctuous, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what terre<U+017F>trial, which for a long time holds out again<U+017F>t what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever violent Heat, as appears by the Fires of <hi>Volcanoes,</hi> which are maintain'd by Bitumen alone, and other <U+017F>ulphureous Earths. This al<U+017F>o is the Opinion of the Chymi<U+017F>ts, when they compound them of Sulphur and Mercury; Sulphur holding the place of the Male Seed, and Mercury, which is more crude and aqueous, that of the maternal blood. And as the Salt or Earth predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in Stones is the cau<U+017F>e of their friability; <U+017F>o Sulphur and Mercury, which is unctuous moi<U+017F>ture, renders them malleable and capable of exten<U+017F>ion; which is an Argument of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as well as colour, <U+017F>ound, and fixation, or enduring Fire without alteration, but not weight; for then as Gold, the perfecte<U+017F>t Metal, is the heavie<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o Silver <U+017F>hould be next to it in weight, which is not; Quick-<U+017F>ilver being much more ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; next, Lead; after which follow Silver, Copper, Tinn, Iron, and Stones, who<U+017F>e weight is very different. Whence it appears, that Gravity is not an Effect of the conden<U+017F>ation of Matter; otherwi<U+017F>e the Starrs being the den<U+017F>er parts of their Orbs <U+017F>hould be heavy, as they are not; but it proceeds from the Form, whereunto al<U+017F>o the many wonderful Effects ob<U+017F>erv'd in Metals mu<U+017F>t be referr'd; as that Gold di<U+017F>covers Poy<U+017F>ons, attracts Quick-<U+017F>ilver, and is attracted by the Foot of a Spar-hawk, and lov'd by Gryphons, as Iron is by E<U+017F>triches, who dige<U+017F>t it; that Tinn makes all Metals brittle where-with it is mixt, Copper <U+017F>inks not in the water of the I<U+017F>land <hi>Demone<U+017F>us,</hi> near <hi>Carthage</hi>; and that Quick-<U+017F>ilver, though humid, and alwayes fluid, moi<U+017F>tens not; which <U+017F>ome attribute to the equal mixture of <U+017F>iccity and humidity.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, If ever the Opinion of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> (who held, <hi>Omnia in omnibus</hi>) was well grounded, it was chiefly in reference to Metals, who<U+017F>e Etymology, together with the Chymi<U+017F>ts operations, <U+017F>peak the ea<U+017F>ie tran<U+017F>mutation of one into another; imperfect Metals differing onely in certain accidental degrees from Gold and Silver, which they may be turn'd into after purifying from their Lepro<U+017F>ie, and refining by Nature or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66371:88"/>
Art. And thus according to the opinion of <U+017F>ome Moderns, it may be <U+017F>aid, that, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing the earth a great Magnet, it hath al<U+017F>o in it <U+017F>elf a commencement towards <U+017F>uch metallick mutation, <U+017F>ince the Load<U+017F>tone is in a manner the principle of Iron, the mo<U+017F>t terre<U+017F>trial of all Metals; whence it is that they attract one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as do Mercury and Gold, which is compos'd thereof. And thus by the power of heat in the bowels of the Earth, Iron the mo<U+017F>t imperfect and lighte<U+017F>t of all Metals is turned into Steel and Copper, afterwards into Tin, and la<U+017F>tly, being more depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Silver and Gold. And <U+017F>ince Art imitates Nature as in the fabricating of Artificial Gold you mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olve a <U+017F>olid matter, then volatilize, and again fix and return into a <U+017F>olid <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance; <U+017F>o the generation of Metals may be conceiv'd to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by evaporation of the thinner parts of Earth and Water, which being volatilized by the <U+017F>ubterranean heat, and lighting upon Rocks and hard Stones, are there fixed and conden<U+017F>ed into Metals differing according to the purity and concoction of their matter, and the places it lights upon, which are ordinarily Mountains.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the different properties of Metals plainly argue the diver<U+017F>ity of their Species; <U+017F>ince Properties pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e <U+017F>pecificating Forms. Be<U+017F>ides, the World would have been very defective, if Nature had made only Gold, which may be better <U+017F>pared than Iron and Steel, and is le<U+017F>s hard for u<U+017F>es of Life. Nor is it likely that Nature ever intended to reduce all Metals to Gold; which then <U+017F>hould be more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than Iron and Lead; <U+017F>ince wi<U+017F>e and potent Nature <U+017F>eldom fails of her intentions: As for the alledged tran<U+017F>mutation of Metals, were it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, yet it proves them not all of the <U+017F>ame Species, change of Species being very ordinary, and as ea<U+017F>ie to be made in Crucibles as in Mines; nothing el<U+017F>e being nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary thereunto but to open the bodies of the Metals, and <U+017F>et at liberty what in <U+017F>ome is mo<U+017F>t active, and in others more <U+017F>u<U+017F>cep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of the Forms you would introduce. Nature indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways intends what is mo<U+017F>t perfect, but not to reduce every thing to one mo<U+017F>t perfect Species, as all Metals to Gold; but to make a mo<U+017F>t perfect individual in every Species; labouring with no le<U+017F>s <U+017F>atisfaction for production of Iron and Flints then of Gold and precious Stones. As for the principles of Metals, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them of Mercury and Sulphur, joyning Vitriols there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>alt to give Body to the <U+017F>aid Ingredients; but <U+017F>ome will have Mercury to be the <U+017F>ole matter, and under<U+017F>tand by <U+017F>ulphur an internal and central heat in the Mercury concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its crudity, and by Mercury the cruder portion of its <U+017F>elf; their Salt being only the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence whereof the Mercury is capable after Coction. Others di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h what is metallick in metals (as only Mercury is) from the impurities mixt therewith, as earths, <U+017F>ulphurs, and Vitriols; and make the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect metals <U+017F>o homogeneous that 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>eparate any
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66371:88"/>
thing from them; which is a proof (they <U+017F>ay) of the unity of their matter and conformity with Mercury, which always retains its own nature, though preparations make it appear in <U+017F>everal <U+017F>hapes. Moreover, they inferr from the great pondero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity of Gold, that it is only Mercury; otherwi<U+017F>e the le<U+017F>s heavy bodies pretended to be mixt therewith, <U+017F>hould dimini<U+017F>h its weight; and Fu<U+017F>ion, which <U+017F>eems to reduce all metals into their mo<U+017F>t natural <U+017F>tate, makes them perfectly re<U+017F>emble Mercury, in which alone the Chymi<U+017F>ts for that rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>eek their Great Work. Neverthele<U+017F>s <U+017F>eeing Experience teaches us, that Mercurie's <U+017F>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs and vitriols are found in all metals except Gold, it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F>s'd that the<U+017F>e three bodies are their immediate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Nor doth it follow that they are not in Gold too, though the Chymi<U+017F>ts have not yet been able to find them, but <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united as to be in<U+017F>eparable; Coction having <U+017F>uch power upon matters that have affinity, as to unite them beyond po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of <U+017F>eparation; as appears in Gla<U+017F>s, of which nothing el<U+017F>e can be made but Gla<U+017F>s, though it be compos'd of different principles, and in Mercury it <U+017F>elf, which is a Mixt, but reduc'd to <U+017F>uch homogeneity that nothing can be extracted out of it but Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. Indeed Gold could not be <U+017F>o malleable us it is, if it were all Mercury; and they that know Mercury, and the impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of depriving it of the pronene<U+017F>s to revive, will not ea<U+017F>ily believe it can, without mixture of <U+017F>ome other body, acquire the form of Gold; who<U+017F>e gravity proceeds from its proper Form, and not from Mercury which can give it no more weight then it <U+017F>elf hath; Gold by being more den<U+017F>e, not acquiring more gravity, any more then Ice doth which <U+017F>wims upon the water.</p>

But it mu<U+017F>t be that Elementary Fire, which is every where potential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and actually in its own Sphere, which is above that of the Air, and below that of the Moon.

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ubtlety, one of the principal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requi<U+017F>ite to the conver<U+017F>ion of Matter into Fire, is <U+017F>o far from hindring, that it encrea<U+017F>es the violence and activity of Fire, making it penetrate even the <U+017F>olide<U+017F>t bodies; whence that pretended Fire, not being mixt with extraneous things to allay its heat, as that of <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> is temper'd by its Phlegm or aqueous humidity, but being all Fire in its own Sphere and natural (place, which heightens the Virtue and qualities of all Agents) mu<U+017F>t there al<U+017F>o heat, <U+017F>hine, burn, and produce all its Actions, which depend not upon den<U+017F>ity or rarity, or <U+017F>uch other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Matter purely pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive, but upon its whole Form; which con<U+017F>tituting it what it is, mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o make it produce Effects <U+017F>uta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its Nature. Wherefore as Water condens'd into Ice or Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tal, is no longer Water, becau<U+017F>e it hath ceas'd to refrigerate and moi<U+017F>ten; <U+017F>o the Fire pretended to be above the Air, invi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, by rea<U+017F>on of its rarity, is not Fire but <U+017F>ubtile Air.

Whereunto add, that the beams of all Stars have heat; and were any cold, yet tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Saturn</hi> are too remote, and tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Moon</hi> too weak in compari<U+017F>on of this Fire, the extent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is about 90000. Leagues, for the di<U+017F>tance between the Earth and the Moon is almo<U+017F>t as much, namely, 56. Semidiameters of the Earth, from which <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tracting between 25. and 30. Leagues, which they allot to the three Regions of the Air, the re<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t be occupy'd by the Fire, which they make to extend from the Concave <U+017F>urface of the Moon, to the convex <U+017F>urface of the Air; which it would con<U+017F>ume in le<U+017F>s than a moment, con<U+017F>idering the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66371:89"/>
great di<U+017F>proportion between them. Moreover, were there <U+017F>uch a Fire, it could not be own'd an Element, becau<U+017F>e its levity would keep it from de<U+017F>cending and entring into the Compo<U+017F>ition of mixts; and, were it not leight, yet it would be hindred from de<U+017F>cending by the extream coldne<U+017F>s of the Middle Region of the Air, accounted by <U+017F>ome, a barrier to the violence of that Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Fire, which ought rather to be reckon'd among<U+017F>t their <hi>Entia Rationis,</hi> than the Natural Elements, whereunto Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reity and Palpability are requi<U+017F>ite. For the<U+017F>e Rea<U+017F>ons, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that the Sun is the true Elementary Fire, plac'd for that purpo<U+017F>e in the middle of the World, who<U+017F>e Light and Heat enter into the Compo<U+017F>ition not onely of all living things, but al<U+017F>o of Stones and Metals; all other Heat be<U+017F>ides that of the Sun, being de<U+017F>tructive, and con<U+017F>equently, no-wi<U+017F>e fit for Generation.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, He confounds Heaven with Earth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troyes the Nature of the Sun, who takes it for an Element, that is to <U+017F>ay, a thing alterable and corruptible by its contraries, which it mu<U+017F>t have if it be an Element. The Heat of his beams proves it not the Elementary Fire, <U+017F>eeing commonly the nearer we are to Fire, the more we feel the Heat of it; but the Supream and Middle Regions of the Air, are colder than ours. Be<U+017F>ides, were our common fire deriv'd from the Sun, it would not langui<U+017F>h, as it doth, when the Sun <U+017F>hines upon it; nor would the heat of dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils and caves be greater in Winter than in Summer. Wherefore I rather embrace the common Opinion, which holds, That the heavie<U+017F>t Element is in the lowe<U+017F>t place, and the leighte<U+017F>t in the highe<U+017F>t, who<U+017F>e Action is hindred by the proportion requi<U+017F>ite to the quantity of each Element.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the qualities of Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> Heat, Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and Light, concurring in the Sun in a <U+017F>upream degree, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue it the Elementary Fire; for Light being the Cau<U+017F>e of Heat, the Sun (which is the prime Luminous Body) mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be the prime Hot, that is to <U+017F>ay, Fire. For as the pretended one above the Air, was never yet di<U+017F>cover'd; <U+017F>o 'tis repugnant to the Order of the Univer<U+017F>e, for the leighte<U+017F>t of Elements to be <U+017F>hut up in the Centre of the Earth, where <U+017F>ome place it. We have but two wayes to know things, Sen<U+017F>e, and Rea<U+017F>on; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which, is founded either upon Cau<U+017F>es or Effects: Now we know nothing of the Sun, or any other Cele<U+017F>tial Bodies, otherwi<U+017F>e then by its Effects and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible qualities, which being united in Spherical Burning-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, (as they are in the body of the Sun) notifie to us by their Effects the Nature of their Cau<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid. That Fire being to the World what the Soul is to the Body, as Life is in all the parts of the Body; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o is Fire equally diffu<U+017F>ed throughout the whole World. In the Air it makes Comets, and other Igneous Meteors: In the Earth it concocts Metals, and appears plentifully in <hi>Volcanoes,</hi> who<U+017F>e

Fires would not continue alwayes, if they were violently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in tho<U+017F>e Concavities; yea, 'tis in the Waters too, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>altne<U+017F>s and production of Mon<U+017F>ters, cannot be without Heat. Yet being the mo<U+017F>t active of all Elements, it is therefore di<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted in much le<U+017F>s quantity than the re<U+017F>t; Nature having ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <U+017F>ame proportion both in the greater and le<U+017F><U+017F>er World, Man's Body; in which there is le<U+017F>s of Fire than of the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Otherwi<U+017F>e, had the Fire been equal to the re<U+017F>t, it would con<U+017F>ume all living things to a<U+017F>hes.

            <p>NAture, not contented to produce all things, hath given them a de<U+017F>ire of Self-pre<U+017F>ervation.

But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire appears chiefly in Animals, and above all in Man, being grounded upon the Love he bears to him<U+017F>elf: Which extream Love, in<U+017F>tigating him to <U+017F>eek all good things contributary to his contentment, makes him likewi<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ire long Life, whereby he may continue his other enjoyments, and, con<U+017F>equently, avoid all occa<U+017F>ions of Death, as that which interrupts the cour<U+017F>e of this Life, and makes him cea<U+017F>e to be. Hence, as by general con<U+017F>ent Death is the mo<U+017F>t terrible of terribles; <U+017F>o, by the rea<U+017F>on of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, Life is the mo<U+017F>t agreable, and con<U+017F>equently, mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>irable and be<U+017F>t thing in the World; and not de<U+017F>irable only by all Men who are endued with Knowledg, but al<U+017F>o by all living things, each after its mode, and according as they are capable of de<U+017F>iring; Plants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting their nouri<U+017F>hment, and Animals <U+017F>eeking their Food with difficulty, and carefully avoiding all dangers that lead to Death. For though Nature loves change, (whereof <U+017F>he is the Principle) yet 'tis onely that of Generation, or of a le<U+017F>s into a more noble <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; that of Corruption and Death <U+017F>he abhorrs, being not further plea<U+017F>ed in the vici<U+017F><U+017F>itudes of mutations, than <U+017F>he gains by the change; but <U+017F>he is a lo<U+017F>er by Death, which <U+017F>eparates the Body from the Soul, in the union whereof, <U+017F>he hath all that <U+017F>he can wi<U+017F>h. She may di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf, and changing of <U+017F>hape and countenance, but can never light upon any more agreable, than that which <U+017F>he makes appear in the Marriage of a Body with a Soul; which are <U+017F>o perfectly united, that, after their di<U+017F><U+017F>olution, our Souls alwayes retain an Inclination toward their ancient Mates which they once animated.</p>

               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:66371:90"/>The Second <U+017F>aid, If the <U+017F>entiment of Nature makes us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive long Life de<U+017F>irable; Rea<U+017F>on, which evinceth it full of Mi<U+017F>eries and Calamities, teaches us that the <U+017F>horte<U+017F>t is be<U+017F>t, and that we may ju<U+017F>tly wi<U+017F>h, either never to have been, or to have dy'd as <U+017F>oon as we came into the World. This was the Judgement not onely of the greate<U+017F>t Sages of Pagan Antiquity, many of whom cheerfully quitted Life to e<U+017F>cape its Mi<U+017F>eries; but the <U+017F>ometimes famous Republick of <hi>Mar<U+017F>eilles,</hi> gave Licence to the mi<U+017F>erable to take Poy<U+017F>on, which was kept in a publick Store. Yea, even the holie<U+017F>t Per<U+017F>onages have been of the <U+017F>ame Advice; as <hi>Job</hi> among<U+017F>t others, who calls Man's Life a warfare upon Earth, and cur<U+017F>es the day of his Birth; <hi>Mo<U+017F>es</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who pray'd to God they might dye; and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who de<U+017F>ires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <U+017F>o much as to be loos'd from this mi<U+017F>erable Body; in which, as in a dark pri<U+017F>on, the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul is enclos'd, and remains again<U+017F>t, its will; <U+017F>ince being of a Cele<U+017F>tial Nature, and <U+017F>o conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually longing after the place of its extraction, Death, which delivers it from its fetters, mu<U+017F>t be as de<U+017F>irable to it as contrary to the Body, which having nought to hope for after this Life, but to be the food of worms and corruption, hath all rea<U+017F>on to dread it, and avoid the occa<U+017F>ions of it; as accordingly all <U+017F>uch do who live onely for the Body, re<U+017F>enting no other motions in them<U+017F>elves but of de<U+017F>ire to live long.

            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Since Life is the duration of Being, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is the greate<U+017F>t of all Goods, (Entity and Good being convertible) that mu<U+017F>t be the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>irable which is of greate<U+017F>t continuance, becau<U+017F>e it comes neare<U+017F>t infinity and eternity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which all Perfection is compris'd, and which being therefore pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ir'd by all Men, but not attainable by any, they endeavor to partake as much of it as they can by prolongation of Life, which is the foundation not onely of the Goods of the Body and Fortune, (who<U+017F>e <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s makes amends for <U+017F>ome Evils of Life) but al<U+017F>o of the Mind, in which Natural Felicity con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts; whereunto among<U+017F>t other conditions, long Life is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite both for attaining of Knowledge and Virtue, not to be gotten without long time, (which renders Men knowing and prudent) as for making others ta<U+017F>te the fruits of an exemplary Life.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That Bea<U+017F>ts and even Stones having the good of Exi<U+017F>tence as well as we, that alone is not <U+017F>ufficient to render Life de<U+017F>irable, in regard Non-exi<U+017F>tence is much rather to be wi<U+017F>ht than a Being alwayes mi<U+017F>erable, what ever <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay to the contrary; <U+017F>ince even our Saviour <U+017F>aith, It had been better for

Nor have we more rea<U+017F>on to de<U+017F>ire long Life for the Goods of the Mind, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in Virtue alone. For if we be vicious, 'tis expedient both for our <U+017F>elves and the Publick, that we live but little, for fear of corrupting others by our evil Examples, If virtuous, 'tis much to be fear'd le<U+017F>t we be corrupted by the conver<U+017F>e of the wicked, who are very numerous; which was the cau<U+017F>e why God by a <U+017F>pecial favour took away <hi>Enoch</hi> in the mid<U+017F>t of the cour<U+017F>e of his Life, and tran<U+017F>ported him into the Terre<U+017F>trial Paradi<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The fifth <U+017F>aid, If a long Life were le<U+017F>s de<U+017F>irable than a <U+017F>hort, God <U+017F>hould have deceiv'd tho<U+017F>e that honour their Parents, by promi<U+017F>ing them a bad <U+017F>alary in recompence of a good Action: Nor ought Phy<U+017F>ick to trouble it <U+017F>elf and tho<U+017F>e that u<U+017F>e it, by <U+017F>o many Rules and Receipts, were a <U+017F>hort Life (that is to <U+017F>ay, a <U+017F>peedy death) <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irable; nor would the Laws puni<U+017F>h Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals with Death, if what they give them were better than what they take from them. Moreover, as the long-liv'd Oak and Palm-Tree are more excellent than the Mu<U+017F>hrome, Hy<U+017F>op, and the Ro<U+017F>e; Stags, Elephants, Eagles, Ravens, and the Phoenix more perfect than Butterflies, and tho<U+017F>e In<U+017F>ects which they call <hi>Ephemera,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they live but one day; <U+017F>o among<U+017F>t Men, tho<U+017F>e that live long, <U+017F>eem to have <U+017F>ome advantage above tho<U+017F>e that are of a <U+017F>hort Life, having the Principles of their Generation more vigorous: wherein neverthele<U+017F>s the Sex, Temperament, Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, Habitation, and manner of living, make a notable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Sanguine Men, and the Inhabitants of Temperate Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, commonly living longer than Women, cholerick Per<U+017F>ons, and <U+017F>uch as live under intemperate Climates.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, Rea<U+017F>on having been given Man to correct the Inclinations of the Sen<U+017F>itive Appetite, 'tis that alone mu<U+017F>t judge whether it be expedient for him to live long; not Sen<U+017F>e, which makes us judge like bea<U+017F>ts, That nothing is dearer than Life. But Rea<U+017F>on, illuminated either by Faith or by Philo<U+017F>ophy, teaches us that this World is the place of our bani<U+017F>hment, the Body the Soul's Pri<U+017F>on which <U+017F>he alwayes carryes about with her, Life a continual <U+017F>uffering and War; and therefore he fights again<U+017F>t Natural Light who maintaines it expedient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable a State. For, be<U+017F>ides the incommodities at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a long Life, which after 70. years, as <hi>David</hi> te<U+017F>tifies, is onely labour and <U+017F>orrow, long Life is equally unprofitable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attaining Knowlege and Virtue. He that lives long can learn nothing new in the World, which is but a Revolution and Repetition of the <U+017F>ame Effects produc'd alwayes by the <U+017F>ame Cau<U+017F>es; not onely in Nature, who<U+017F>e cour<U+017F>e and changes may be

<U+017F>een in the Revolution of the Four Sea<U+017F>ons of the Year, but even in Affairs of State and Private Matters, wherein nothing is <U+017F>aid or done, but what hath been practis'd before. And as for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the further we are from Childhod, the le<U+017F>s Innocence and Sanctity we have, and Vices ordinarily increa<U+017F>e with years.

            <p>AS the Brain is the mo<U+017F>t eminent and noble of all the parts, being the Seat of the Under<U+017F>tanding, and the Throne of the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul, <U+017F>o its di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are very con<U+017F>iderable; and the more, in that they do not attaque that alone, but are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all the other parts, which have a notable intere<U+017F>t in the offence of their Chief, cea<U+017F>ing to diffu<U+017F>e its Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits de<U+017F>tinated to Motion, Sen<U+017F>e, and the Function of the Inferior Members. Which Functions are hurt by the Lethargy, which deprives a Man of every other Inclination but that to <U+017F>leep, and renders him <U+017F>o forgetful and <U+017F>lothful, (whence it took its Greek name, which <U+017F>ignifies <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>h oblivion) that he remembers nothing at all, being po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd with <U+017F>uch contumacious <U+017F>leepine<U+017F>s that <U+017F>he <U+017F>huts his Eyes as <U+017F>oon as he ha's open'd them; be<U+017F>ides that, his Phan<U+017F>ie and Rea<U+017F>oning is hurt with a continual gentle Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Which differences this Symptom from both the <U+017F>leeping and waking Coma, call'd, <hi>Typhomania:</hi> the former of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly begins in the Fits of Fevers, and ends or dimini<U+017F>hes at their declination, but the Lethargick <U+017F>leeps <U+017F>oundly, and being wak'd by force, pre<U+017F>ently falls a <U+017F>leep again: The latter makes the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient inclin'd to <U+017F>leep, but he cannot, by rea<U+017F>on of the variety of Species repre<U+017F>ented to him in his Phan<U+017F>ie. The <U+017F>ignes of this Malady are deliration, heavine<U+017F>s of the Head, and pain of the Neck after waking, (the Matter taking its cour<U+017F>e along the <U+017F>pine of the back), frequent o<U+017F>citation, trembling of the Hands and Head, a pali<U+017F>h Complexion, Eyes and Face pufft up, <U+017F>weat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, troubled Urine, like that of Cattle, a great Pul<U+017F>e, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hing and fluctuating, Re<U+017F>piration rare with <U+017F>ighing, and <U+017F>o great forgetfulne<U+017F>s, as <U+017F>ometimes not to remember to <U+017F>hut their Mouths after they have open'd, nor even to take breath, were they not forc'd to it by the danger of <U+017F>uffocation. The Conjunct and next Cau<U+017F>e of this Malady is a putrid Phlegm, who<U+017F>e natural coldne<U+017F>s moi<U+017F>tens and refrigerates the Brain, whil<U+017F>t its put refa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive heat kindles a Fever by the vapors carry'd from the Brain to the Heart, and from thence about the whole. Now this Phlegmatick Humor is not detained in the Ventricles of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:66371:92"/>
Brain; for then it would cau<U+017F>e an Apoplexy if the ob<U+017F>truction were total, and if partial an Epilep<U+017F>ie, wherein the Nerves contract them<U+017F>elves towards their original for di<U+017F>charging of that Matter: But 'tis onely in the <U+017F>inuo<U+017F>ities and folds of the Brain, which imbibing that exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive humidity, acquires a cold and moi<U+017F>t intemperature; from whence proceeds dulne<U+017F>s and li<U+017F>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s to all Actions. For as Heat is the Principle of Motion, e<U+017F>pecially when quickned by Dryne<U+017F>s; <U+017F>o is Cold the Cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>tupidity and <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s, e<U+017F>pecially when accompanied with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, which relaxes the parts, and chills their Action. In like manner, Heat or Dryne<U+017F>s inflaming our Spirits the Tunicles of the Brain, produce the irregular Motions of Frenzy, which is quite contrary to the Lethargy; although it produce the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ometimes, namely, when the Brain after great evacuations acquires a cold and moi<U+017F>t intemperature; in which ca<U+017F>e the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy is incurable, becau<U+017F>e it te<U+017F>tifies Le<U+017F>ion of the Faculty, and abolition of <U+017F>trength: But on the contrary, a Fren<U+017F>ie after a Lethargy is a good <U+017F>ign, re<U+017F>olving by its Heat, and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipating the cold humors which produce the <U+017F>ame.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That coldne<U+017F>s being contrary to put refacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Phlegm the colde<U+017F>t of all humors, cannot ea<U+017F>ily putrifie in the Brain, (which is cold too of its own nature) much le<U+017F>s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Heat <U+017F>ufficient to communicate it <U+017F>elf to the Heart, and there excite a Fever; it being more likely for <U+017F>uch adventitious Heat to cau<U+017F>e in the Brain rather the impetuous motions of a Frenzy, than the dulne<U+017F>s and languor of a Lethargy. Nor is it le<U+017F>s then ab<U+017F>urd, to place two enemy-qualities in the <U+017F>ame Subject, to wit, Cold and Heat, whereof the one cau<U+017F>es <U+017F>leep, the other a Fever; which, I conceive, to precede not to follow the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, and which having rai<U+017F>ed from the <hi>Hypochondres</hi> to the Brain, a Phlegmatick blood mixt with gro<U+017F>s vapors, there cau<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ob<U+017F>curation of Rea<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s of the whole Body, but e<U+017F>pecially the abolition of the Memory, the <U+017F>utable temperament for which is totally de<U+017F>troyed by exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, He mu<U+017F>t be a Mi<U+017F>anthropus, and have wholly renounc'd all Humane Sentiments that can blame Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the mo<U+017F>t honourable and ancient Society of the World, founded not onely upon the Divine Law, (which makes it a Sacrament, and a very great My<U+017F>tery) and upon that of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by who<U+017F>e univer<U+017F>al Con<U+017F>ent, it hath been honor'd with great Priviledges and Immunities; as on the contrary, Celibacy hath been publickly di<U+017F>countenanc'd and puni<U+017F>h'd: but al<U+017F>o upon that of Nature, who hath in<U+017F>pir'd into all Animals a de<U+017F>ire of joyning and coupling together for Generation of their like; which de<U+017F>ire is greater in Men, ina<U+017F>much as he a<U+017F>pires to Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, no otherwi<U+017F>e attainable in this World but by Marriage, which revives him in his Children.

            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, 'Tis peculiar to Marriage to have nothing <U+017F>mall or moderate; every thing in it is extream. 'Tis either full of <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s and Affection, or of Hatred and bitterne<U+017F>s; 'tis either a Paradi<U+017F>e, or a Hell. When 'tis <U+017F>uted with all Conditions requi<U+017F>ite, there's no <U+017F>tate happier; but when any is wanting, no Infelicity equals it. And becau<U+017F>e Good requires the integrity of all its con<U+017F>tituent parts, but Evil comes from the lea<U+017F>t defect; 'tis no wonder that few or no Marriages are happy, <U+017F>ince there is none wherein there is not <U+017F>omething to be wi<U+017F>ht for, e<U+017F>pecially when the match is made, (as mo<U+017F>t commonly 'tis) by another's Hand; though 'tis <U+017F>trange, that Men who are <U+017F>o circum<U+017F>pect and wary in other bargains, <U+017F>earching, examining, and taking E<U+017F><U+017F>ay of what they buy, <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>o little Prudence in an Affair of <U+017F>uch Con<U+017F>equence and Danger. There is nothing but a Wife that a Man is oblig'd to keep as long as he lives; but they have been taken at a venture, <U+017F>ince, at the in<U+017F>tance of the Roman Dames, the Law of <hi>Ancus Martius</hi> was aboli<U+017F>ht, who had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely built a Temple to Male-Fortune near the <hi>Tyber,</hi> where Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were carefully examin'd. And as tis an intolerable madne<U+017F>s to engage voluntarily into fetters and a perpetual Pri<U+017F>on, by <U+017F>ubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one's <U+017F>elf to the Caprichio of a Woman; <U+017F>o 'tis great <U+017F>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in a Man to entru<U+017F>t his Honor, the chiefe<U+017F>t of all Goods, to her incon<U+017F>tant humor, who may render us infamous when the Phan<U+017F>ie takes her. I think therefore, every one ought to con<U+017F>ult him<U+017F>elf, Whether it be fit for him to marry or not, that is, Whether he believes he ha's Virtue and Con<U+017F>tancy enough to <U+017F>uffer the defects of a Woman, who may be commendable in <U+017F>ome Point, but at the bottom is alwayes a Woman.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLII. At what time the Rational Soul is infus'd.</head>
            <p>AS Religion obliges us to believe, that the Soul, which is of an Immortal Nature, comes immediately from God, who drawing it out of the Aby<U+017F><U+017F>e of Nothing, at the <U+017F>ame time creates it in the Infu<U+017F>ing, and infu<U+017F>es it in the Creating; <U+017F>o no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is determin'd ab<U+017F>olutely touching the time in which that infu<U+017F>ion is made. For knowing which, we mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve that the whole time of the Child's re<U+017F>iding in the Womb, is divided into four parts; namely, the Conception, Conformation, Motion, and Parturition; <U+017F>o di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed between them<U+017F>elves, that the time of Motion, is about treble to that of Conformation; and the time of Parturition, double to that of Motion. The whole work of Conformation is divided again into four times, according to which the Matter contained is diver<U+017F>ly fa<U+017F>hioned and wrought, and is called Geniture, or Coagulated Milk, Foetus, Embryo; and an Infant when the Conformation of the parts is fini<U+017F>hed, which is at the thirtieth day for Boyes, and at the forty <U+017F>econd for Girles; who<U+017F>e le<U+017F>s Heat and more wateri<U+017F>h materials, require a longer time for Conformation of their Spermatick parts: After which the Blood arriving, fills the void <U+017F>paces of the Mu<U+017F>cles, Fibres, and other carnous parts, which are not perfectly <U+017F>haped till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the time of Motion, which is the third month for Males, and the fourth for Females; at which time the Second Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ends, and the whole organization is compleated. At fir<U+017F>t, the Infant hath onely a Vegetative Life, by means of which, his parts are generated by the Alteration and Conformation of the Matter, and are nouri<U+017F>hed, and take their growth not onely by their Attraction from all parts of the Matrix, but al<U+017F>o by an Internal Vital Principle, which is the Vegetative Soul, re<U+017F>iding in all fruitful <U+017F>eed, and being the <U+017F>ame with the Formative Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Now becau<U+017F>e the Vegetative or Sen<U+017F>itive Soul is but an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, namely a certain Harmony of the Four Qualities, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ea<U+017F>ily give place upon the arrival of the rea<U+017F>onable <U+017F>oul, which I think happens when the organization of the parts is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, to wit, about the third or fourth month; before which time, the Body not being organized, cannot receive the Soul, (which is the act of an Organical Body) which al<U+017F>o <U+017F>he for<U+017F>akes, when, upon any notable <U+017F>olution of continuity, the Organs are de<U+017F>troyed and aboli<U+017F>hed oftentimes, though the Temper of the <U+017F>imilary parts be not hurt; which con<U+017F>equently, is not the <U+017F>ole requi<U+017F>ite for the Infu<U+017F>ion of the Soul, but al<U+017F>o the convenient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the Organs.</p>

And the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on which obliges us to acknowledg the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul after motion, con<U+017F>trains us to admit it before; which nothing hinders us from attributing to <U+017F>ome other cau<U+017F>e, (as to the Sen<U+017F>itive Soul introduc'd before the Rational) <U+017F>aving that cau<U+017F>es are not to be multiplied without nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, and one Soul alone may <U+017F>uffice for Sen<U+017F>e, whil<U+017F>t yet the defect of Organs allow not the exerci<U+017F>e of Rea<U+017F>on. The <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>hews how ab<U+017F>urd it is to a<U+017F><U+017F>ign any other cau<U+017F>e, in the fir<U+017F>t days, of the Vegetative Actions; it being as ea<U+017F>ie to infer the pre<U+017F>ence of the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul by this <U+017F>ort of actions as by the Sen<U+017F>itive Actions, which may al<U+017F>o have another cau<U+017F>e. For the infu<U+017F>ion of the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul after forty days cannot be proved by actions proper to it (for it rea<U+017F>ons not till long after) nor by the actions of a Soul <U+017F>imply; for then you mu<U+017F>t grant that it is there before Organization, which is an action proper to animated things. Moreover, the Soul mu<U+017F>t be admitted in the Body as <U+017F>oon as it may be there, which is at the beginning of conception; becau<U+017F>e even then there wants no fit di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to this Soul, which needs not any different Organs for the bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vegetative Actions which <U+017F>he then performs, no more then Plants do; nor are different Organs nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to her ab<U+017F>olute ex<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting, <U+017F>ince God hath created her immaterial and without any dependance: and we <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>imilary parts of the Body are animated; <U+017F>o that the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions wherewith the Soul can <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, and which <U+017F>uffice to retain her in the Body, are al<U+017F>o <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to introduce her thereinto. Now the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions are no other then the <U+017F>ame which are requi<U+017F>ite for the actions of the Vegetative Soul. For whatever indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition happen to the Organs of Sen<U+017F>e and Motion, the Soul abides in the Body till the heat be di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated or extingui<U+017F>hed; the Organs of Sen<U+017F>e and Motion being not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to retain the Soul in the Body <U+017F>aving in as much as they contribute to re<U+017F>piration. Even the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie which aboli<U+017F>hes all the noble di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophers hold nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to the Soul, never drives her away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s it be by accident; <U+017F>ince a Child in his Mothers belly may have that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e without incommodity, <U+017F>aving when it comes to need re<U+017F>piration. Now though Organization be not a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition requi<U+017F>ite to the introduction of the Soul, yet <U+017F>he requires cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain others, <U+017F>ome whereof we know not, as that unexplicable character imprinted in the Seed, be<U+017F>ides the temperament which <U+017F>uffices perfectly to determine the matter for introdudion of this form and exclu<U+017F>ion of all other. The conformation of Organs being not a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition which determines nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily (<U+017F>eeing among<U+017F>t humane bodies <U+017F>ome differ more from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men in re<U+017F>pect of the principal parts then they do from
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66371:95"/>
certain other Animals) but 'tis the temperament alone, which ari<U+017F>ing in the fir<U+017F>t days after the mixture of the two <U+017F>eeds, and according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the <hi>foetus</hi> having in the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>even days all that he ought to have, this opinion is more pious and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for repre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the criminal licen<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e who without <U+017F>cruple procure abortion within the fir<U+017F>t forty days.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Though the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul be of a much <U+017F>ublimer nature then the <U+017F>ouls of other Creatures; yet being created with reference to the Body 'tis not introduced thereinto till the <U+017F>ame be fitted for its reception; as no other natural form is ever received into a <U+017F>ubject not previously fitted with all due di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions. And <U+017F>ince the Soul is the principle of all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hence <U+017F>he needs Organs and In<U+017F>truments for performing them; and the more <U+017F>ublime <U+017F>he is, the greater preparation doth <U+017F>he require then the Sen<U+017F>itive Soul, as this al<U+017F>o doth then the Vegetative, which demands only a certain mixture of the fir<U+017F>t qualities, be<U+017F>ides which the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive requires a more exqui<U+017F>ite temperament of the two Principles of Generation, Seed and Blood, endued with a vital Spirit, capable of producing Sen<U+017F>e and Motion. So that the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul ought not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ed, till after the conformation is in all points completed.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, Since there is no proportion but between things of the <U+017F>ame nature, the Immortal Rea<U+017F>onable Soul cannot have any with the corruptible Body, and <U+017F>o not depend more on the matter in its infu<U+017F>ion then in its creation, which is probably the third day after conception; at which time the actions of life appear in nutrition, growth, alteration, and configuration of the parts. Which actions mu<U+017F>t proceed from <U+017F>ome internal and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated principle; which cannot be the Soul either of Father or Mother, <U+017F>ince they act not where they are not inherently; nor yet the <U+017F>pirit of the Seed which is not a principal agent but only the in<U+017F>trument of a Soul; nor the formative vertue, which is only an accident or temper of qualities, and in like manner the in<U+017F>trument of <U+017F>ome more noble agent. 'Tis therefore the Soul contained in the bo<U+017F>om of the matter, which produces all the<U+017F>e actions therein. They who hold the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul not introduced till after the two others, con<U+017F>ider not that Forms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no degrees of more or le<U+017F>s cannot be perfected or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged one into another, much le<U+017F>s annihilated; <U+017F>eeing corruption is cau<U+017F>ed only by contraries, and Forms have none. It follows therefore that the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul is the principle of all the<U+017F>e functions; which <U+017F>he performs according to the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions <U+017F>he meets with; and that <U+017F>he is the architect of her own habitation.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLIII. Of Metemp<U+017F>ycho<U+017F>is, or Tran<U+017F>migration of Souls.</head>
            <p>THough Metemphycho<U+017F>is, or the Tran<U+017F>migration of Souls, be rather imaginary then true; yet becau<U+017F>e there is nothing which more inriches the Field of Philo<U+017F>ophy then liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of rea<U+017F>oning, we <U+017F>hall here inquire whether the Heathen, guided only by the light of Nature had any rea<U+017F>on to maintain this extravagance; which was fir<U+017F>t taught in <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Pythagoras</hi> who had learn'd it of the Egyptians; by whom and mo<U+017F>t other Nations of antiquity it was believ'd not only that <U+017F>ouls departed out of <U+017F>ome bodies re-entered and animated others, but al<U+017F>o that all things after a certain revolution of Ages <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>ume the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tate wherein they had formerly been. This was al<U+017F>o the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> <U+017F>aving that he was more rational then <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> who making three Souls of the <U+017F>ame quality, <U+017F>aid that tho<U+017F>e of men after death went to animate the bodies of Men, Bea<U+017F>ts, or Plants; for which rea<U+017F>on he ab<U+017F>tained from the fle<U+017F>h of Animals, and could hardly re<U+017F>olve to eat Beans for fear of biting his Fathers head. But <hi>Plato</hi> held the Tran<U+017F>migration of Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Souls only into humane Bodies. Which opinion though le<U+017F>s ab<U+017F>urd then the former (which de<U+017F>troys it <U+017F>elf by the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion it introduces among<U+017F>t all natural beings) yet it hath its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences too; <U+017F>ince the Soul being an incompleat form, making one whole with its other half the Body, it can never meet with one in all points like the fir<U+017F>t; be<U+017F>ides that, were it in another, it would have an inclination towards the fir<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o would not be in <U+017F>uch body in quality of a form, but in a <U+017F>tate of con<U+017F>traint and violence.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the Pythagorical Metemphycho<U+017F>is is not more ab<U+017F>urd (in regard that being the form gives a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and <U+017F>pecifical being to every thing, if humane <U+017F>ouls pa<U+017F>t into the bodies of Bea<U+017F>ts or Plants, the<U+017F>e Creatures would be Men;) then that of <hi>Plato</hi> <U+017F>eems probable: nothing hindring but that a humane <U+017F>oul may enter into another humane body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution and ruine of the former. For if there be any thing to hinder it, it mu<U+017F>t be becau<U+017F>e there is no return from privation to habit, That which hath <U+017F>ometimes been, can no more be <U+017F>uch as it was, and 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for a <U+017F>oul which hath once informed a body to re-enter it again and there exerci<U+017F>e the functions of life after having been once totally thence expelled. But the<U+017F>e Rea<U+017F>ons hinder not, <U+017F>eeing the <U+017F>oul may be introduced anew into <U+017F>ome body wherein it is not now, but hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; as Gangraenous and wholly mortified members may be again vivified by a powerful effect of the <U+017F>oul and the goodne<U+017F>s of temperament. Moreover, it is not le<U+017F>s po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:66371:96"/>
which never was to begin to be, then for that which hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been to ex<U+017F>i<U+017F>t again in nature; <U+017F>eeing both being equally pure nothing, they are objects <U+017F>ufficient to be created by God; as the fir<U+017F>t matter (which is almo<U+017F>t nothing) is the object of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his inferior; and natural bodies are the objects of Art which is below Nature. So that not only <U+017F>ouls, after having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed one body, may pa<U+017F>s into an another by Metemp<U+017F>ycho<U+017F>is, but (which <U+017F>eems more difficult) the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>oul may again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <U+017F>ame body.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, 'Tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for one and the <U+017F>ame thing which hath been to be a new; for then it <U+017F>hould be twice and have two durations, and con<U+017F>equently two exi<U+017F>tences, and <U+017F>o not be one and the <U+017F>ame thing; <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>ingularity depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on exi<U+017F>tence. So neither can the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>oul return into the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally de<U+017F>erted body, although it may re-animate <U+017F>ome parcels of it, nor yet into other bodies. For in the fir<U+017F>t place, as for the <U+017F>ouls of Plants and Bea<U+017F>ts, there is no more rea<U+017F>on to believe that the<U+017F>e forms di<U+017F>appearing upon de<U+017F>truction of the Organs whereby they exerci<U+017F>e their functions, go to animate other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>pecies, then that, when my wood is burnt, the <U+017F>ame form of fire goes to <U+017F>eek another faggot and kindle the <U+017F>ame as <U+017F>oon as fit di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions thereunto ari<U+017F>e; if it were <U+017F>o, the Woodmongers <U+017F>hould have a very dangerous Trade. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this tran<U+017F>migration of <U+017F>ouls is either ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary (that is, bodies are animated no other way but this) and <U+017F>o there will be no other new generation, but the <U+017F>upernumerary <U+017F>ouls mu<U+017F>t wait till their turn come, (according as the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick poet <hi>Virgil</hi> repre<U+017F>ents them in the <U+017F>ixth Book of his <hi>Aeneis</hi>) for if there be more bodies then <U+017F>ouls, there will be no produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whatever di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition be found in the matter; and then though we <U+017F>ow the Ground never <U+017F>o much with Corn, nothing will come of it, in ca<U+017F>e more be <U+017F>own then there are Vegetative Souls to animate it; whence we <U+017F>hould be in great danger of Famine. As for the Rea<U+017F>onable Soul, <U+017F>ince there is no animated body who<U+017F>e outward figure is not an Index of its inward form, were there <U+017F>uch a thing as Metemp<U+017F>ycho<U+017F>is, the <U+017F>oul of a Hor<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould be under the outward form of a Man, and <U+017F>o all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg from external <U+017F>hape <U+017F>hould be deceit and delu<U+017F>ions, far from <U+017F>erving for Phy<U+017F>iogmony. Moreover the Ancients intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this Opinion, partly to frighten the wicked, by making them believe that after death their <U+017F>ouls <U+017F>hould do penance in the bodies of Bea<U+017F>ts who<U+017F>e manners they had imitated (Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards becoming Hares, and cruel per<U+017F>ons Wolves,) till after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation by the River <hi>Lethe</hi> they <U+017F>hould again become men; and partly to excite the good with hopes that their <U+017F>ouls <U+017F>hould be received into the bodies of Heroes and Demi-gods; <U+017F>uch fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <U+017F>tories <U+017F>erving to keep the more ignorant <U+017F>ort within their duty.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the <U+017F>eparated <U+017F>oul carries along with
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66371:97"/>
her, only three powers, the Under<U+017F>tanding, Will, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty; by means whereof <U+017F>he is carried towards what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires by a real local-motion, whereof <U+017F>he is as well capable without as within the body. Now <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires nothing <U+017F>o much as to be united to the body with whom <U+017F>he hath formerly been conjoyned. And con<U+017F>equently <U+017F>he cannot but return thither of her own accord; <U+017F>eeing when the de<U+017F>ire and power meet the effect mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follow, e<U+017F>pecially when the de<U+017F>iring is in a violent <U+017F>tate, contrary to its own Nature, as that of the <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Soul is; and therefore <U+017F>ince nothing violent is of long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Soul's <U+017F>eparation from her Body cannot be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, If it be true that nothing is made which hath not already been, and that, according to <hi>Origen,</hi> there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Souls produced in the beginning of the Creation, after which it is <U+017F>aid, That God re<U+017F>ted from all his Works, and that he creates nothing <U+017F>ince he put the la<U+017F>t hand to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the World, (which it borrows from the forms or beauties which it contains) it may <U+017F>eem con<U+017F>entaneous to the ornament of the Univer<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>ay that it was at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tor'd with all the forms, where-with the Matter is informed, according as it comes to have fit di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions thereunto. And that the<U+017F>e forms having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and con<U+017F>equently being incorruptible, upon for<U+017F>aking their fir<U+017F>t Subject, (through default of fit di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions to maintain them) are received into other Subjects, like the fir<U+017F>t, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently, as capable of receiving <U+017F>uch form, which of it <U+017F>elf is indifferent to one Subject as well as to another; but <U+017F>ince the Rational Soul cannot have any particular Inclination towards the Body it formerly animated, which after Death being no longer Organical, nor capable of being <U+017F>o, but onely Du<U+017F>t and A<U+017F>hes; 'tis more probable, that when <U+017F>eparated, it re<U+017F>ents motions (if it have any) towards <U+017F>ome Body duly organized, and not yet furni<U+017F>hed with a form; there being (be<U+017F>ides) le<U+017F>s incovenience in <U+017F>aying that one and the <U+017F>ame Soul, can animate divers Bodies one after another, than that it can animate divers at the <U+017F>ame time, and in divers places, which neverthele<U+017F>s is the Opinion of mo<U+017F>t Philo<U+017F>ophers. For when it is <U+017F>eparated, it remains <U+017F>till an Act and a Form, capable of informing any <U+017F>ort of well di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed Body, without affecting any in particular; into which it enters not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, <U+017F>ince Knowledge follows Immaterality, and the Species and Notions being to the Soul, what accidents are to their Subjects from which they are in<U+017F>eparable, they mu<U+017F>t accompany her where-ever <U+017F>he goes; although by rea<U+017F>on of the Clouds, and humidities of the Body which <U+017F>he informes, <U+017F>he is not actually knowing in Infancy, but onely proportionably, as in time the Body comes to be dried, and the humidities ab<U+017F>umed, the Species which were ingraven in the Soul begin to appear, and as it were to be produced a new by Remini<U+017F>cence, which nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Metemp<U+017F>ycho<U+017F>is.</p>

For Nature being <U+017F>till as Wi<U+017F>e and Powerful as heretofore, and the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al Cau<U+017F>es the <U+017F>ame, their Operations mu<U+017F>t be likewi<U+017F>e as perfect, and their Effects as excellent in the<U+017F>e dayes, as they have been in any. Then, as for our Minds, they are <U+017F>o far from being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd, that they improve more and more in acutene<U+017F>s; and being of the <U+017F>ame Nature with tho<U+017F>e of the Ancients, have <U+017F>uch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage beyond them, as a Pigmy hath upon the <U+017F>houlders of a Gyant; from whence he beholds not onely as much, but more than his <U+017F>upporter doth.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, As a Stone hath more force by how much 'tis le<U+017F>s from the hand that flings it; and generally all Cau<U+017F>es act more powerful upon their next, than upon their di<U+017F>tant Effects: <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o Men are le<U+017F>s perfect proportionally to their remotene<U+017F>s from their Source and Original, from whence they derive all their perfection. This decay is chiefly ob<U+017F>erv'd in our bodies, which are not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ound and well-con<U+017F>tituted, as tho<U+017F>e of our Ance<U+017F>tors; and therefore 'tis no wonder if the Souls where-with they are inform'd, have le<U+017F>s Vigor though the <U+017F>ame Nature. For although, in order to judge aright of the Excellence of the Souls of one Age compar'd with another, we ought to wave that advantage which the later have over the preceding, by enjoying the benefit of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; whereunto 'tis as ea<U+017F>ie to add, as 'tis to build upon a good foundation, whereof others have firmly lay'd the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tones and Pillars. Yet, for all tho<U+017F>e great advantages, there hath
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66371:98"/>
not in the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t Ages, appear'd any one equal to tho<U+017F>e grand Per<U+017F>onages of Antiquity, who have had the vogue in each Art and Science. Moreover, want of things made them more ingenious, and the Experience of many years render'd them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of every thing; whereas now we cea<U+017F>e to live, when we but begin to know our <U+017F>elves. Indeed they had the true Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines and Sciences, whereof we have no more but the <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; and in<U+017F>tead of real and <U+017F>olid Philo<U+017F>ophy, <U+017F>uch as that of the Fir<U+017F>t Ages was, nothing remains to us but an u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s Schola<U+017F>tick Gibberi<U+017F>h, which having been bani<U+017F>ht the Company of all di<U+017F>creet people, is <U+017F>hamefully confin'd to the inclo<U+017F>ure of Colledges, where I am confident the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors will readily yield to <hi>Socrates, Plato, Lycurgus, Solon,</hi> and the Seven Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi> to who<U+017F>e Age, which was the year of the World, 3400. I clearly give the prize; there being no indowment of the Mind preferrable to that of Wi<U+017F>dom.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, If Wi<U+017F>dom mu<U+017F>t carry it, there is no Age to be compar'd to that of <hi>Solomon</hi>: but becau<U+017F>e one Swallow makes not a Spring, I <U+017F>hould prefer before it that of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> when the Roman Empire was in its greate<U+017F>t Glory; the rather becau<U+017F>e our Saviour, the Paragon of all great Men liv'd in it, and <hi>Virgil, Ovid, Cicero, Cato,</hi> be<U+017F>ides many others, flouri<U+017F>ht at the <U+017F>ame time. Not to <U+017F>peak of the rare Inventions which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o then appear'd; as Malleable Gla<U+017F>s, and Perpetual Lights, both now unknown.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, If the complaint of the decay of Witts were true and new, the World mu<U+017F>t be very old, <U+017F>ince <hi>Seneca,</hi> who liv'd 1500. years ago, made the <U+017F>ame in his time: But if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent Wits are not inferior to tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s time, it will follow, either that the world grows not wor<U+017F>e, as is commonly <U+017F>aid, or that long Series of years, which makes above a quarter of the whole Age the world, is taken but for one and the <U+017F>ame time: In which Ca<U+017F>e, the world mu<U+017F>t be older than religion and truth teach us, before it fell into that decay, wherein we <U+017F>ee it continue for <U+017F>o many Ages. But indeed, 'tis a weakne<U+017F>s to imagine that Witts dimini<U+017F>h; our Natural Inclination to de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e what we po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s, and to regret what is pa<U+017F>s'd, making us judge to our own di<U+017F>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that we are le<U+017F>s perfect than our Ance<U+017F>tors, and that our Nephews mu<U+017F>t be wor<U+017F>e than our <U+017F>elves; whence aro<U+017F>e that Fiction of Four Ages, differing according to <U+017F>o many Metals; the Golden one, by rea<U+017F>on of its excellence; that of Silver, Bra<U+017F>s and Iron, proportionably, as Men fell from the former Perfection of Soul, and Innocence of Manners. But all this while, 'tis in the beginning of the World that the weakne<U+017F>s of Man appear'd by <U+017F>uffering him<U+017F>elf to be govern'd by his Wife, and the damnable Re<U+017F>olution of a Fratricide. Moreover, the Mind of Man being a Power of well Conceiving, Rea<U+017F>oning, Inventing, and doing other Functions, whereof he is capable, he may arrive to a Supream Degree of Excellence, either by the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66371:98"/>
pure and liberal Will of his Maker, or by the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition and concurrence of Natural Cau<U+017F>es, or by Humane Indu<U+017F>try. So that God, Nature, and Art, the three <U+017F>ole Agents of this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <U+017F>ame as heretofore, they mu<U+017F>t produce the <U+017F>ame Effects. For God creates not Souls now with le<U+017F>s advantages and grace than formerly; he is as liberal of his favours as ever, e<U+017F>pecially in the Ages of Grace. Nor doth Nature and other Second Cau<U+017F>es contribute le<U+017F>s to the perfection of Souls than heretofore. And the Humane Soul, however independent of Matter as to its E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, yet is <U+017F>o link'd to the Organs of the Body, that it operates well or ill according as tho<U+017F>e are diver<U+017F>ly affected, which is, what we call Good or Bad Wit, whil<U+017F>t we judge thereof by the Actions, and not by the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence. For tho<U+017F>e Organs and Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions depend of the Elements and Superior Bodies, which are alwayes the <U+017F>ame, and con<U+017F>equently, mu<U+017F>t produce the <U+017F>ame Effects; and hence, the equal Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of Bodies, will inferr equal perfection of Minds. But as for the difference of Souls ari<U+017F>ing from Art and In<U+017F>truction, undoubtedly, tho<U+017F>e of our Age are better cultivated than any ever have been in times pa<U+017F>s'd.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, When I con<U+017F>ider the high pitch whereunto <U+017F>o many great Men have carry'd the Glory of the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t Ages, I find more wonders than in the preceding; but it pertains onely to the Ages en<U+017F>uing to make their <hi>Elogiums</hi>; Great Men, whil<U+017F>t living, being kept down by Envy or Contempt. One Age mu<U+017F>t be let pa<U+017F>s, before we begin to judge of the worth of it; then the following begins to regret what it <U+017F>leighted, it being natural to us to <U+017F>eek onely what is wanting, and to be di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ted with plenty. And truly, I think 'tis the multitude of per<U+017F>ons excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in all <U+017F>ort of Arts, and e<U+017F>pecially in the Sciences, (whereof never were <U+017F>o many Doctors, Regents, and Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors, <U+017F>een in one <U+017F>ingle Age as in this) that makes us le<U+017F>s e<U+017F>teem the ingenious that are now living; for 'tis onely rarity that gives price to things, and that made him pa<U+017F>s for a great Clerk a few Ages ago, who could but write and read; he that <U+017F>poke Latine was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy, though now 'tis a Tongue almo<U+017F>t as univer<U+017F>al, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as the Native. Now Admiration being the Daughter of Ignorance, the e<U+017F>teem had of mo<U+017F>t of the admired in former Ages, is rather an Argument of the Rudene<U+017F>s and Ignorance of the Times, than of the excellence of their Witts. Nor were they better than we in their Manners, but onely more <U+017F>imple, and yet culpable of as many Crimes. But were we the more wicked, this were no Argument of want of Witt, which is the matter in que<U+017F>tion. And if there have been <U+017F>ometimes a <hi>Ceres,</hi> a <hi>Bacchus,</hi> a <hi>Pallas,</hi> a <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and others, advanc'd to Deities for finding out the way to <U+017F>ow Wheat, plant Vine-yards, <U+017F>pin Wool, and forge Iron; we have had in the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t Ages the Inventors of the Compa<U+017F>s, the Gun, Printing, the Tubes of <hi>Galileo,</hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and other Inventions both more difficult and excellent; the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66371:99"/>
ea<U+017F>ie<U+017F>t having been fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cover'd. The Mode<U+017F>ty of tho<U+017F>e that govern us, (who no le<U+017F>s hate the vanity of prai<U+017F>e, than they know how to exerci<U+017F>e Actions de<U+017F>erving it) permits me not to <U+017F>hew you, that all pa<U+017F>s'd Ages have nothing that comes near the grandeur of their Souls, and that their conduct is the more to be admir'd, in that their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is both to keep them<U+017F>elves up with Friends, and give rea<U+017F>on to Enemies, who al<U+017F>o help to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, that there are greater State<U+017F>-men and Captains in this Age, than in any of the preceding.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLV. Of the Serene, which is a hurtful Dew falling in Summer Evenings.</head>
            <p>AS Painters find it harder to repre<U+017F>ent a calm <U+017F>mooth Sea, than the rampant foaming billows of a <U+017F>torm, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more variety of Colours, and afford the Pencil more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and as a Hi<U+017F>tory of Peace is harder to write, and le<U+017F>s plea<U+017F>ant to read, than the Troubles and Commotions of Warr: So I think it le<U+017F>s difficult to de<U+017F>cribe the <U+017F>everal impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions of Tempe<U+017F>ts, than tho<U+017F>e of a calm Air, which neverthele<U+017F>s at certain times, produces pernicious Effects; <U+017F>o much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, in that they proceed from a very <U+017F>imple Cau<U+017F>e, no-wi<U+017F>e malignant of it <U+017F>elf, to wit, from a clear and <U+017F>erene Air, free from Clouds and Vapours, which in the Evening being cool'd by the rea<U+017F>on of the Sun's Elongation, acquires a certain Refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating and Catarrhous quality, call'd by the vulgar, The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene:</hi> becau<U+017F>e it happens either in the Evening, or more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in fair weather, when the Air is <U+017F>erene, than when it is pluvious and full of Vapours. Which quality, <U+017F>ome a<U+017F>cribe to the Influence of the Stars, e<U+017F>pecially to the Moon, term'd for that rea<U+017F>on by the P<U+017F>almi<U+017F>t, <hi>Infrigidans</hi>; which hath indeed a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dominion over all Humid Bodies, particularly, tho<U+017F>e of Men, who find <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible alterations in them<U+017F>elves, according to the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral faces of that Planet. But becau<U+017F>e the Heavens diffu<U+017F>e their Influences upon tho<U+017F>e that are under covert, as well as upon tho<U+017F>e that are in the open Air, where onely the Serene is felt; I <U+017F>hould rather pitch upon the alterations of the refrigerated Air, which acts but <U+017F>o far as it is near us; and 'tis always more proper to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute Effects here below to proximate Cau<U+017F>es, than to recur to the Heaven, which is but an equivocal Cau<U+017F>e thereof.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid. If Cold were the Cau<U+017F>e of the <hi>Serene,</hi> the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>hould happen where-ever it were cold, and be more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful according to the vehemency of that quality, as towards Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night or Morning, and likewi<U+017F>e in Winter: Yet the <hi>Serene</hi> is never <U+017F>poken of but in the temperate Sea<U+017F>ons of Spring and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66371:99"/>
and <U+017F>ome little portion of the Sea<U+017F>ons bordering upon them. Be<U+017F>ides, in Summer the air of our cold Caves <U+017F>hould be capable of producing it at mid-noon. Wherefore I cannot think the Serene an effect of bare cold, but of the vapors where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the air, how<U+017F>oever apparently pure, is always charg'd (whence proceeds the diver<U+017F>ity of refractions In the Planets, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at Sun-ri<U+017F>e and Sun-<U+017F>et, which is never without <U+017F>ome clouds) which vapours being de<U+017F>titute of the diurnal heat and <U+017F>o co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be condens'd, fall down upon our heads ju<U+017F>t as Dew doth, which is produc'd after the <U+017F>ame manner but of a matter <U+017F>omwhat thicker and more copious. And as there is no Dew <U+017F>o there is no Serene but in temperate Sea<U+017F>ons, and Regions; never in Winter or the mid<U+017F>t of Summer: for violent cold congeals the<U+017F>e vapours into Fro<U+017F>t and Ice, and vehement heat di<U+017F><U+017F>ipates and con<U+017F>umes them. The practice of our Ladies (who u<U+017F>e to remain in the Serene, thereby to whiten their complexion and <U+017F>often their fle<U+017F>h) <U+017F>hows that this evening-air having a clean<U+017F>ing and levigating vertue mu<U+017F>t be impregnated with a quality like Dew, which is deter<U+017F>ive by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>alt which it drew from the earth; by means whereof it not only whitens Linen and Wax but al<U+017F>o purgeth Animals, as appears by the fluxes hapning to Sheep driven out to gra<U+017F>s before the Sun has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>um'd the Dew; and by Manna, which is nothing but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd dew, and hath a purgative vertue.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Mans body being <U+017F>ubject to the injuries of all external Agents, receives <U+017F>o much greater from the impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions of the Air, as the <U+017F>ame is more nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to life; capable of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting for <U+017F>ome time without other things, but not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Air, which is continually attracted into our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies not only by re<U+017F>piration, but al<U+017F>o by in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible tran<U+017F>piration through the Pores of the Body, which is pierc'd with holes like a Sieve for admi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of air which is taken in by the Arteries in their motion of Dia<U+017F>tole or Dilatation. And being mo<U+017F>t agile and <U+017F>ubtle, it ea<U+017F>ily penetrates our Bodies, altering them by the four fir<U+017F>t qualities wherewith it is variou<U+017F>ly impregnated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vicinity of the Bodies environing it, which make the four Sea<U+017F>ons of the Year, wherein it variou<U+017F>ly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>es the bodies upon which it acts, changing even their natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament. And becau<U+017F>e the parts of a natural day have <U+017F>ome proportion with tho<U+017F>e of a year, upon account of the <U+017F>everal changes caus'd by the common and proper revolutions of the Sun; hence the Morning is like the Spring hot and moi<U+017F>t, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temperate, and the Blood then predominates: Noon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embles Summer, hot and dry, at which time Choler is in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the following part is cold and dry, Melancholy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>pondent to Autumn: the Evening and whole Night, by its coldne<U+017F>s and humidity which puts Phlegm in motion, is a little Winter, the coldne<U+017F>s whereof proceeds not from the vapors (which are always accompani'd with <U+017F>ome extraneous heat,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66371:100"/>
whereby they are retain'd in the Air and kept from falling) but from the bare privation of the heat of the Sun, who, as by his pre<U+017F>ence he actually cau<U+017F>es heat in the Air, <U+017F>o by his ab<U+017F>ence he cau<U+017F>es coldne<U+017F>s in the <U+017F>ame; which penetrating our Bodies cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd by the diurnal heat, ea<U+017F>ily therein conden<U+017F>es the vapors which are not yet <U+017F>etled or laid, and <U+017F>quee<U+017F>ing them out of the Brain and all the parts (ju<U+017F>t as we do water out of a wet <U+017F>punge) they fall upon the weake<U+017F>t parts, where they cau<U+017F>e a fluxion and pain.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the Air being of it <U+017F>elf very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, can never do any mi<U+017F>chief, unle<U+017F>s it be mix'd with <U+017F>ome extraneous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances, as Vapors and Exhalations which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually infect the fir<U+017F>t Region wherein we re<U+017F>ide. And becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ubtle parts of Earth and Water exhal'd into it are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, 'tis not <U+017F>trange if they produce <U+017F>uch <U+017F>udden and unexpected effects, as we <U+017F>ee the Serene doth; which is caus'd by vapors rais'd after Sun-<U+017F>et by the force of the heat remaining upon the <U+017F>urface of the Earth, like tho<U+017F>e ari<U+017F>ing from heated water after it is taken off the fire: So that the Serene is that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour whil<U+017F>t it mounts upwards, not when it falls downwards; for it cannot de<U+017F>cend till it be render'd heavier by conden<U+017F>ation into Water, Clouds or Mi<U+017F>ts, which make the Air nubilous and not <U+017F>erene, as in this effect it u<U+017F>es to be. But at their fir<U+017F>t ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they are more volatile, rare, <U+017F>ubtle, and invi<U+017F>ible.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the chief cau<U+017F>e of this hurtful accident, is the change of one contrary into another without <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> which is always incommodious to Nature; who for that rea<U+017F>on conjoyns all extreams by <U+017F>ome <hi>mediums,</hi> which <U+017F>erve for di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions to pa<U+017F>s from the one to the other without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. And as the alteration of the body from cold to hot is painful, (witne<U+017F>s tho<U+017F>e who hold their cold hands to the fire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter handling of Ice) in like <U+017F>ort that from hot to cold is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious; whence the hotter the preceding day hath been, the more dangerous is the <U+017F>erene; becau<U+017F>e the pores of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being open'd, and all the humors di<U+017F>order'd and mov'd, by the diurnal heat, the cold in<U+017F>inuates into and works upon the <U+017F>ame with more liberty; ju<U+017F>t as heated water is <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t frozen by rea<U+017F>on its parts are more open'd by the heat, and con<U+017F>equently more capable of receiving the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Agents. Which is al<U+017F>o the rea<U+017F>on why the fir<U+017F>t cold hurts us rather then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t fro<U+017F>ts, namely, becau<U+017F>e it finds the body more open, then en<U+017F>uing hard weather doth. So though in Winter the air be colder, yet becau<U+017F>e 'tis almo<U+017F>t continually the <U+017F>ame, it makes le<U+017F>s impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in the evening upon our bodies already accu<U+017F>tomed to its rigor: and though the air is colder at midnight then at Sun-<U+017F>et, yet the <U+017F>erene is only at the beginning of the night, when our bodies more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly receive alteration from the <U+017F>ame. Wherefore 'tis only the <U+017F>udden change of the air which makes the <U+017F>erene, whereof our bodies are the more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible according
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:66371:100"/>
to the openne<U+017F>s of the pores and of the futures of the head, and the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s of the fle<U+017F>h, which renders the body obnoxious to external cau<U+017F>es, as hardne<U+017F>s (which <U+017F>ecures it from them) makes it <U+017F>ubject to internal cau<U+017F>es, through want of tran<U+017F>piration. Hence Pea<U+017F>ants, Souldiers and all <U+017F>uch as are hardned by labour and are of a firm and con<U+017F>tant con<U+017F>titution, feel no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the Serene, although they breathe an air more <U+017F>ubtle, and con<U+017F>equently more capable of being impregnated in the evening with qualities noxious to the body.</p>

            <p>THere is no more perfect Mirror of Incon<U+017F>tancy, then Man; as appears by the plea<U+017F>ure his body takes in the change of Pa<U+017F>ture, his mind in that of Objects, and both in that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Hence men look not upon pre<U+017F>ent honours but as <U+017F>o many <U+017F>teps whereby to a<U+017F>cend to new; the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of pre<U+017F>ent goods bringing no other <U+017F>atisfaction then that of their Stomack, that is, till a <U+017F>econd Appetite be excited by new Meats. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the nimblene<U+017F>s of their volatile Spirits, the fluidity and mobility, of their humours which con<U+017F>titute the temperament, too notoriou<U+017F>ly furni<U+017F>h the efficient and material cau<U+017F>e to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire el<U+017F>ewhere for them; for which rea<U+017F>on the melancholick are le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ubject to this defect; this earthy humour being le<U+017F>s <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of change, whence they prove more wi<U+017F>e. But among<U+017F>t all Nations there is none to whom the vice of Levity is more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then to the French. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> who had long convers'd with them, frequently objects the <U+017F>ame to them, and experience <U+017F>ufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>hews by what is pa<U+017F>s'd that they are very far from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy of other Nations, as not only their Statutes and Edicts which they cannot long ob<U+017F>erve, but all their Modes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>toms, and their de<U+017F>ire of novelty abundantly te<U+017F>tifie. The cau<U+017F>es whereof are either from the Climate or the Soil. For 'tis ob<U+017F>erv'd that where the Heaven is always in the <U+017F>ame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture, as toward the Poles; or where the Sun heats almo<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>ame degree as near the Equator (which makes the days and nights equal), the Manners and Inclinations of the People are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o equal: on the contrary, tho<U+017F>e that by the <U+017F>everal remotions and approaches of the Sun have different con<U+017F>titutions of Air, receive <U+017F>utable impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions from the <U+017F>ame, which are afterwards manife<U+017F>ted in their actions. And becau<U+017F>e what is below is the <U+017F>ame with what is on high, the Earth con<U+017F>equently partakes of the <U+017F>ame alterations which the Heaven produces in the Air, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66371:101"/>
retains them longer: Thus our Soul being heated and cooled, moi<U+017F>tned and dry'd in one and the <U+017F>ame day, <U+017F>uffering contrary changes in a very little time; 'tis no wonder if the Aliments it affords make the parts, humors, and <U+017F>pirits, like it <U+017F>elf, that is to <U+017F>ay, flitting, incon<U+017F>tant, and mutable; which parts being communicated from Father to Son, can no more be chang'd by us, even by Travels and Alteration of Soil, than the Moor can change his <U+017F>kin which the temper of his native climate hath in like manner given him. Add hereunto, that the French Courte<U+017F>ie, receiving all <U+017F>trangers more civilly than any Nation of the World, is al<U+017F>o more ea<U+017F>ily lead by their per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: And whereas the roughne<U+017F>s and ru<U+017F>ticity of many other people thinks <U+017F>hame and <U+017F>corn to change, (as implying prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ignorance) the <U+017F>incerity and frankne<U+017F>s of the French is <U+017F>uch, that he ea<U+017F>ily alters his Mind and way as <U+017F>oon as another <U+017F>eems better to him than his own: other Nations, (what-ever Pride they take in being always con<U+017F>tant and equal to them<U+017F>elves, and e<U+017F>pecially more patient than we in our Adver<U+017F>ities) <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ing us onely in this particular, that they better know how to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emble their di<U+017F>contents.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Lightne<U+017F>s of Minds is, like that of Bodies, re<U+017F>pective onely, not ab<U+017F>olute. And as Air is term'd Light, in re<U+017F>pect of Water and Earth; <U+017F>o dull people, tho<U+017F>e of the North, and <U+017F>uch others as would have gravity alone in words, ge<U+017F>tures, and actions, pa<U+017F>s for Wi<U+017F>dom, call the French light, becau<U+017F>e they are more nimble and active then them<U+017F>elves; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally what others are onely in appearance, affect not that fal<U+017F>e ma<U+017F>k of Wi<U+017F>dom, whereof they po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the <U+017F>olidity and Body, whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e content them<U+017F>elves with enjoying its <U+017F>hadow and gho<U+017F>t. For 'tis not the change of habits or modes that argues that of the Mind, but in great Matters, as Religion and State, in maintaining whereof, the French may be affirm'd more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant than any Nation. 'Tis not an Age yet, <U+017F>ince <hi>France</hi> bad rea<U+017F>on to glory, (as well as in Saint <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time) of never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving produc'd Mon<U+017F>ters, but of planting the Faith well among<U+017F>t all its Neighbors, who<U+017F>e rigorous Inqui<U+017F>ition is le<U+017F>s a te<U+017F>timony of the Con<U+017F>tancy, than of the lightne<U+017F>s or ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <U+017F>ince they are kept in their Religion by fear of the Wheel and the Gallows. Then as for the State, the French Monarchy is the anciente<U+017F>t in the world, and hath been always maintain'd amid<U+017F>t the ruines and downfalls of other States, by the exact ob<U+017F>ervation of its fundamental Laws; which is an eminent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Con<U+017F>tancy of the French; the Nations who have mo<U+017F>t charg'd them with this Vice, <U+017F>hewing them<U+017F>elves the mo<U+017F>t incon<U+017F>tant, whil<U+017F>t this pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant body of <hi>France</hi> remains always like it <U+017F>elf; which it could not do, if the members which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e it were light and incon<U+017F>tant, the greate<U+017F>t Vice where-with they can a<U+017F>per<U+017F>e us. For <U+017F>ince, according to <hi>Seneca,</hi> Wi<U+017F>dom is always to will and not-will the <U+017F>ame things; Incon<U+017F>tance and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66371:101"/>
Irre<U+017F>olution, in willing <U+017F>ometimes one thing, <U+017F>ometimes another, is a certain te<U+017F>timony of Folly, Imprudence, and weakne<U+017F>s of Mind; which coming to change, intimates either that it took not its mea<U+017F>ures aright, nor apprehended the fit means of attaining to the propo<U+017F>ed end, or that it had not Courage and Re<U+017F>olution enough to go through with its de<U+017F>ignes. And not onely he who hath an incon<U+017F>tant and flitting Spirit is incapable of Wi<U+017F>dom, which requires a <U+017F>ettled Mind, not mutable like that of the Fool, (who, as the Scripture <U+017F>aith, changes like the Moon) but al<U+017F>o of all <U+017F>ort of Virtue, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in a mediocrity, is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable but by Prudence which pre<U+017F>cribes its Bounds and Rules, and by Stability and Con<U+017F>tance which arms the Mind again<U+017F>t all difficulties occurring in the way of Virtue; in which, as well as in the Sciences and Arts, the French having more <U+017F>hare than any other Nation, 'tis injurious to accu<U+017F>e them of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>tancy.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, 'Tis not more vanity to believe one's <U+017F>elf perfect in all things, than temerity in going about (upon blind pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for his Country) to exempt it from a Vice, whereof all <U+017F>trangers, who know us better than we do our <U+017F>elves, are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ally agreed. Let us confe<U+017F>s therefore that we are incon<U+017F>tant, <U+017F>ince, in compari<U+017F>on of the Vices of other Neighbouring Nations, this will not onely appear light, but make it doubtful, whether it be a Vice, <U+017F>ince 'tis grounded upon Nature, which is in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual change; whereby <U+017F>he appears more beautiful and agreeable than in identity and re<U+017F>t, which, is not found even in the prime Bodies and univer<U+017F>al Cau<U+017F>es, which as well as others, are in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual mobility and change, which is no-wi<U+017F>e contrary to Wi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which requires that we accommodate our <U+017F>elves to the circum<U+017F>tances of places, per<U+017F>ons, and times, which alter ince<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>antly, and that we con<U+017F>equently alter our Conclu<U+017F>ions according thereunto; be<U+017F>ides that, change of Opinion is a te<U+017F>timony of a free and ingenuous Spirit, as that of the French is; and it may be attributed to the power of example, in a people environ'd with <U+017F>undry Nations extreamly different, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which are imbu'd with the qualities of them all. For this Country lying under the forty third degree, and the forty eighth, the mixture of the<U+017F>e people, which partake a little of the Southern, and a little of the Northern Neighbours; <U+017F>ometimes conforms to the modes of one, <U+017F>ometimes to tho<U+017F>e of the other: And as in the change of Colours, the difference is not <U+017F>een but in the two extreamities, tho<U+017F>e of the middle appearing changeable and diver<U+017F>ifi'd; <U+017F>o <hi>France</hi> <U+017F>ituated between the Germans, Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Spaniards, mixing and tempering in it <U+017F>elf the qualities of tho<U+017F>e Nations which are in its extreamities, appears to them changeable and uncertain.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, Though the French are not more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant than others, yet their boyling and impetuous humor, and the quickne<U+017F>s of all their Actions having made them be e<U+017F>teemed

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLVII. Of the <U+017F>undry Motions of the Sea and Rivers.</head>
            <p>NOthing ravi<U+017F>hes us more than the Motion of Inanimate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; <hi>Automata,</hi> or Bodies moving by Artifice, having in the beginning made Idolaters, who were undeceived when they came to know the Springs of them. But above all, the Motions of the Sea <U+017F>eem the more marvellous, in that they are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and contrary. And they are of two <U+017F>orts; One Internal, and common to all heavy Bodies, whereby the Water de<U+017F>cends downwards, the agitated Sea becomes calm by returning to its level, and Rivers follow the declivity of the Lands through which they pa<U+017F>s: The other, violent, which is either irregular, (render'd <U+017F>o by the irregularity of the Winds) or regular; which again is of two <U+017F>orts, namely, that of reciprocation in the flux and reflux of the Sea, and that which depends upon the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the World, being either from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t, or from North to South. 'Tis true, Water being naturally fluid and moveable, and not to be contain'd within its own bounds, it were more <U+017F>trange if this great Body were immoveable, than to <U+017F>ee it move, as it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary it <U+017F>hould for Navigation, and to avoid corruption. The wonder onely is, to <U+017F>ee in one <U+017F>ole Body <U+017F>o great a diver<U+017F>ity of Motions, whereof onely the fir<U+017F>t is natural to it; the others ari<U+017F>e from <U+017F>ome extrin<U+017F>ick Cau<U+017F>es; among<U+017F>t which, none acting more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly upon the Elements than the Cele<U+017F>tial Bodies, 'tis to the diver<U+017F>ity of their Motions, that tho<U+017F>e of the Sea mu<U+017F>t be imputed, but particularly, that of its flux and reflux, which being regular, and always alike in one and the <U+017F>ame Sea, cannot proceed but from as regular a Cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>uch as the Heaven is, and chiefly the Moon, which manife<U+017F>tly exerci<U+017F>es its empire over all Humid Bodies, the flux and reflux
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66371:102"/>
following the Lunar Periods and Motions, not onely every <U+017F>ix months, to wit, during the two Aequinoxes when their Tides are very high, but al<U+017F>o every month in the Conjunction and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition of the Moon, and al<U+017F>o every <U+017F>ix hours of the day, almo<U+017F>t all Seas have their flux and reflux, except <U+017F>ome which make the <U+017F>ame in more or le<U+017F>s time, and are longer in their reflux than their flux; or on the contrary, according to the declivity and various winding of the Lands, the greatne<U+017F>s or <U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s of Creeks, the Streights of the Seas, narrowne<U+017F>s of banks, and other differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of <U+017F>ituation.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the Sea, being a <U+017F>imple body, can have but one natural Motion, <hi>viz.</hi> that of its own weight, which makes it flow into places lower than its <U+017F>ource, which it can never <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount. Among<U+017F>t the other three Motions proceeding from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t is di<U+017F>cern'd by the time <U+017F>pent in Voyages at Sea, which is much longer from We<U+017F>t to Ea<U+017F>t, than from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t: becau<U+017F>e in the fir<U+017F>t, they move contrary to the Motion of the Sea, and in the <U+017F>econd with it. Now the cau<U+017F>e hereof is the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Fir<U+017F>t Mover upon all the Orbes and Inferior Bodies, which follow the rapidity of its daily Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t upon the Poles of the World. That from North to South, is likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>een in mo<U+017F>t Seas, and chiefly in the <hi>Euxine,</hi> which being fill'd by the <hi>Palus Maeotis,</hi> and the <hi>Tanais,</hi> di<U+017F>charges it <U+017F>elf by the <hi>Aegaean,</hi> into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea; which, were it not for the high <U+017F>luces of <hi>Africa,</hi> would continue the <U+017F>ame Motion Southwards: Which <U+017F>ometimes hindred <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Se<U+017F>o<U+017F>tris</hi> from digging that <U+017F>pace of Land which is between the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> for fear le<U+017F>t this latter <U+017F>hould overflow tho<U+017F>e Southern Countries. The Cau<U+017F>e of this Motion, is the multitude of Waters towards that Pole, who<U+017F>e coldne<U+017F>s not rai<U+017F>ing <U+017F>o great a quantity of Vapors and Rains as towards the South, the Waters come to be greater there, and <U+017F>o are forc'd to fall towards the lower places. Or rather, (<U+017F>ince there is the <U+017F>ame cold under the Antarctick Pole, and con<U+017F>equently, the <U+017F>ame quantity of Waters and Rains) this de<U+017F>cent of the Waters Southwards, mu<U+017F>t be attributed to the Elevation of the Earth in the North, or to the narrow mouths or gulphs of tho<U+017F>e Seas which make the waters de<U+017F>cend out of them more ea<U+017F>ily than they enter into them. As to the flux and reflux, which is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, but regular Motion, it cannot proceed from Vapors, or from incon<U+017F>tant and irregular Winds, but from the Motion, Light, and particular Influence of the Moon; which attracting the Sea in the <U+017F>ame manner that the Load-<U+017F>tone doth the Iron, is the Cau<U+017F>e of its accumulation, or <U+017F>welling and increa<U+017F>e, which makes the flux: And then her Virtue abating by her elongation, the Waters by their proper weight re<U+017F>ume their level, and <U+017F>o make the reflux.

            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Nothing <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly argues the mobility of the Earth as the motions of the Sea and Rivers: for what el<U+017F>e were it but a miracle if water contain'd in an immoveable ve<U+017F><U+017F>el <U+017F>hould agitate and move it <U+017F>elf. That of Rivers proceeds not from their weight, which makes them fall into a place nearer their Centre; <U+017F>eeing that in a declivity requi<U+017F>ite to the cour<U+017F>e of a River for 200 leagues, there mu<U+017F>t then be a depre<U+017F><U+017F>ion more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible then the altitude of the highe<U+017F>t Mountains of the Earth, nor could the Sea remit the waters to their Springs (as the holy Scripture <U+017F>aith it doth) if tho<U+017F>e Springs were higher then it. But <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing the motion of the Earth, 'tis ea<U+017F>ie to render a rea<U+017F>on of that of the Water. As for Rivers, (almo<U+017F>t all which run we<U+017F>tward) the Earth having its Diurnal Motion from We<U+017F>t to Ea<U+017F>t (according to the Hypothe<U+017F>is of <hi>Copernicus</hi>) may cau<U+017F>e this their contrary motion by <U+017F>ubtracting it <U+017F>elf from the fluidity of the waters (liquid bodies not exactly following the motion of <U+017F>olid) as the water in a Tub ri<U+017F>es in the <U+017F>ide oppo<U+017F>ite to that towards which you <U+017F>way the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el. By the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on al<U+017F>o the Sea <U+017F>hall have its cour<U+017F>e from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t, which is therefore very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible between the two Tropicks where the rapidity of the Earths motion is greater then under the Poles. Hence upon this account Navigation is very ea<U+017F>ie We<U+017F>tward, the Currents very violent, the Tides great towards the Coa<U+017F>t of <hi>America</hi>: as is ob<U+017F>erv'd chiefly in <hi>Magellan's Streight,</hi> where the refluxes of the Northern and Ea<U+017F>tern Sea are advanc'd above 70 leagues; and the <hi>Mar del Sur</hi> <U+017F>carce goes to 25, and that weakly: but about the Poles the Sea hath no other motion but that which is caus'd by Winds and Tempe<U+017F>ts. As for the flux and reflux of the Sea, according to the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition, of its motion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the annual in the Ecliptick (where others make the Sun circulate) and the Diurnal upon its own Axis and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Centre there ari<U+017F>es a certain irregular motion, <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>lower and <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>wifter, which is the cau<U+017F>e of that flux
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66371:103"/>
and reflux: for as in a Boat mov'd at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>wiftly and then caus'd to move <U+017F>omwhat <U+017F>lower, the water contain'd therein <U+017F>wells in its extremities till by continuation of that motion it recover its le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; and the Boat being again driven with the <U+017F>ame velocity, the water <U+017F>wells again upon the change of the motion: the <U+017F>ame comes to pa<U+017F>s upon the unequal motion of the Earth mixt of the annual and diurnal. But becau<U+017F>e the Moon being annex'd to the Earth exactly follows its motions; therefore mo<U+017F>t Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophers have taken the Moon for the cau<U+017F>e of the flux and reflux, although <U+017F>he be only the <U+017F>ign of it.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That according to this Hypothe<U+017F>is 'tis ea<U+017F>ie to render a rea<U+017F>on of two things very remarkable in <hi>Danubius</hi> and <hi>Nilus.</hi> The fir<U+017F>t which runs from We<U+017F>t to Ea<U+017F>t, is ob<U+017F>erv'd in <hi>Hungary</hi> to move <U+017F>lower about Noon then at other hours of the day, as appears by the Water-mills which grinde le<U+017F>s at that time: becau<U+017F>e the motion of the Earth being then contrary to that of the Ecliptick, it con<U+017F>equently appears more <U+017F>low. And as for the other effect, namely, the increa<U+017F>e and inundation of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which begins at the Summer Sol<U+017F>tice, this River run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning directly from South to North from, one Tropick to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is ju<U+017F>t the middle part of the Earth, when it comes to incline its Axis and return the Antarctick part to the Sun, the <U+017F>tream of this River, which is contrary to that motion, waxes <U+017F>lower; and being be<U+017F>ides augmented by the continual Rains of Summer, <U+017F>wells and overflows the Plains of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Which made <U+017F>ome Ancients imagine that the North Winds blew again the <U+017F>tream at that time and forc'd the water back upon them<U+017F>elves.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66371:104"/>
till they have been fir<U+017F>t purifi'd from the gro<U+017F>sne<U+017F>s of their matter by the illu<U+017F>tration and abctraction which the Agent Intellect makes of their Phanta<U+017F>ms or Species, hence the notions of the foule<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>hone<U+017F>t things are always fair and laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, being <U+017F>piritualis'd and made like the Faculty which knows them. On the contrary, the Will in loving renders it <U+017F>elf like the object which it Loves, is turn'd into its nature, and receives its qualities; if the object be unlawful and di<U+017F>hone<U+017F>t, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes vicious and its love is criminal. Which <U+017F>eems to argue that the Lover is le<U+017F>s perfect then the Loved, into which he is transform'd; as food is le<U+017F>s perfect then the body, into which it is converted. And as that which attracts is more excellent then what is attracted, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>tronger draws the weaker; <U+017F>o the thing Loved mu<U+017F>t be more excellent and noble then the Lover, whom it attracts to it <U+017F>elf. Moreover, Love, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Plato,</hi> is a de<U+017F>ire of Pulchritude, which de<U+017F>ire implies want; and therefore he that Loves <U+017F>hews thereby that he wants <U+017F>ome perfection, which renders the thing Lov'd amiable: <U+017F>ince the Will is never carri'd to any object but what hath <U+017F>ome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s either apparent or real. Only God loves not his Creatures for their goodne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ince they have none of them<U+017F>elves; but his will being the cau<U+017F>e of all things, he renders them good by loving them and willing good to them.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Since friend<U+017F>hip con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the union of two, or at mo<U+017F>t, of three Wills, who<U+017F>e mutual corre<U+017F>pondence makes that agreeable harmony and tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>weet accords, which make ravi<U+017F>hing Lovers dye in them<U+017F>elves to live in what they love; there is no true love but what is reciprocal; which is the rea<U+017F>on why none can be contracted with inanimate things, no more then with Bea<U+017F>ts or Fools. And Ju<U+017F>tice commanding us to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as much as is given us; 'tis a great inju<U+017F>tice not to love tho<U+017F>e that love us; yea, if we may believe the Platoni<U+017F>ts, 'tis a kind of homicide of the Soul; <U+017F>ince he that loves, being dead in him<U+017F>elf and having no more life but in the thing lov'd, if that refu<U+017F>es his love, by means whereof it <U+017F>hould live al<U+017F>o in him as he in it, he is con<U+017F>train'd either to dye or langui<U+017F>h mi<U+017F>erably. And whereas he that loves is no longer his own but belongs to the thing lov'd to whom he hath given him<U+017F>elf, this thing is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to love him by the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on that obliges it to love it's <U+017F>elf and all that pertains thereunto. But though perfect love be compos'd of the<U+017F>e two pieces, to love and to be lov'd; yet the one is often found without the other, there being many Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wounded with the Poets leaden Arrows, who in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>eeing their love requited with love, have for all recompen<U+017F>e nothing but contempts and, refu<U+017F>als. 'Tis true, that it being harder to love without being lov'd, then to be lov'd without loving, there is no body but would chu<U+017F>e rather to be lov'd then to love upon tho<U+017F>e terms, becau<U+017F>e nothing flatters our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition <U+017F>o much as to <U+017F>ee our <U+017F>elves <U+017F>ought unto. Yet loving is a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66371:104"/>
nobler thing then to be lov'd; <U+017F>ince honor being more in the honorer then the honored, the honor receiv'd by the lov'd thing reflects upon him that loves; who for that rea<U+017F>on being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by every one that e<U+017F>teems a good friend as a good trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure, and not he that is lov'd, is al<U+017F>o more excellent and hath more vertue, ina<U+017F>much as he hath more honor and prai<U+017F>e which are the attendants of vertue. Moreover, the Lover acts freely, and therefore more to be valu'd then the lov'd per<U+017F>on, who is forc'd to <U+017F>uffer him<U+017F>elf to be lov'd. For though de<U+017F>ire common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow Sen<U+017F>ual Love, yet Love is not a de<U+017F>ire, nor con<U+017F>equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <U+017F>ign of Indigence; otherwi<U+017F>e, it <U+017F>hould cea<U+017F>e with the de<U+017F>ire, and expire after enjoyment; which is fal<U+017F>e: for Mothers love their dead Children, and even before they came into the world, not by a de<U+017F>ire but by a motion of Nature, which cau<U+017F>es us to love what appertains to us, and the more if it co<U+017F>t much pain; which is the rea<U+017F>on why Mothers, who contribute more to the birth of their Children, and have better a<U+017F><U+017F>urance that they are their own, love them al<U+017F>o more tenderly then Fathers do.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That to compare the lov'd per<U+017F>on with the Lover, is to equal the Ma<U+017F>ter with the Servant; for the amorous a<U+017F><U+017F>uming to them<U+017F>elves the quality of Servants of the Ladies whom they call their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, manife<U+017F>t <U+017F>ufficiently thereby that they yield them the pre-eminence. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be the mo<U+017F>t intere<U+017F><U+017F>ed in this cau<U+017F>e; yet they will never have the vanity to prize them<U+017F>elves above what they love; which would be to condemn their own choice and their love of defect of judgment, which making them <U+017F>igh after the enjoyment of the object they adore, argues their want and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence, not to be <U+017F>upply'd by po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the good they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from it; which herein like the Intelligences which move without being mov'd them<U+017F>elves, excites pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions and motions in the Lover's brea<U+017F>t, it <U+017F>elf oftentimes remaining immovable. And as he acts in a more noble way that moves without being mov'd, becau<U+017F>e he re<U+017F>embles the end, which is the noble<U+017F>t of all the Cau<U+017F>es; <U+017F>o he that loves re<U+017F>embles Matter which De<U+017F>ires all Forms, expecting its perfection from them; and con<U+017F>equently is inferior to the per<U+017F>on that is lov'd, as from whom he expects his felicity. Even in Mutual Love, he that begins is le<U+017F>s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as confe<U+017F><U+017F>ing by that addre<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome inviting accompli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the other, who finds not any obligation to love him again but the con<U+017F>ideration of gratitude: For inferring the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of tho<U+017F>e that love from the noblene<U+017F>s of their <U+017F>ubject, as in Gods love to his Creatures, and that of Parents to their Children; I an<U+017F>wer, that 'tis rather an effect of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion then of true love.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That Love is according to the variety of its Object, (Good), three-fold; con<U+017F>idering either Profit, or Plea<U+017F>ure, or Vertue. In the two former, 'tis better to be lov'd then to love, but they are of no long duration; tho<U+017F>e friends
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66371:105"/>
being wont to break as <U+017F>oon as they cea<U+017F>e to find their market or the contentments which they receive from tho<U+017F>e to whom they pretended kindne<U+017F>s. In hone<U+017F>t friend<U+017F>hip (which alone de<U+017F>erves that name, being founded only upon vertue, which makes it durable) though 'tis not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to love without being lov'd, becau<U+017F>e vertuous per<U+017F>ons being alike mutually love and agree well together; yet <U+017F>ince this Amity, before it can become <U+017F>uch mu<U+017F>t be cemented by frequentation, without which they cannot under<U+017F>tand, nor con<U+017F>equently love one another, becau<U+017F>e love ari<U+017F>es from knowledg, it may be demanded whether the active love of him that loves fir<U+017F>t be better then the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive of the other who is lov'd. Which Que<U+017F>tion I determine for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becau<U+017F>e he contributes mo<U+017F>t to the en<U+017F>uing friend<U+017F>hip, by laying the foundations of it. For friend<U+017F>hip, as well as other things, is pre<U+017F>erv'd by the <U+017F>ame means that produce it, namely, by loving. And as the Agent is nobler then the Patient, as concurring more con<U+017F>iderably to the perfection of the work; <U+017F>o he that loves being the Agent is more perfect then the Per<U+017F>on lov'd, who is the Patient. Al<U+017F>o to love is to wi<U+017F>h and do good; to be lov'd, is to receive it: But 'tis more honorable and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous to give then to receive; which is a <U+017F>hameful action: and therefore he that receives never de<U+017F>ires witne<U+017F><U+017F>es. Hence, as he that do's a benefit loves more then he that receives it, as the Artificer loves his work more then his work loves him, and a Creditor de<U+017F>ires his Debtor's <U+017F>afety more then on the contrary; in like manner he that loves is more excellent then he that is lov'd, Love being not <U+017F>o much a te<U+017F>timony of indigence as abundance, becau<U+017F>e 'tis a de<U+017F>ire of communicating; and the more goodne<U+017F>s a Being hath, the more it is communicative and diffu<U+017F>ive.</p>

Yea, were it onely for <U+017F>hew, I <U+017F>hould conclude in favor of great Beards, which at lea<U+017F>t have this good that they make Men appear wi<U+017F>e, though they be not <U+017F>o. And as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> <U+017F>aid of long Hair, that it adds hand<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s to them that are hand<U+017F>ome, and covers the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of them that are not, whom al<U+017F>o it renders terrible to their Enemies; <U+017F>o large Beards <U+017F>erve for Ornament to tho<U+017F>e that are already wi<U+017F>e, and make them con<U+017F>iderable that are not <U+017F>o overmuch.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Hair is the Symbol of Thought, deriv'd from the <U+017F>ame Brain, and as various in conceit and fa<U+017F>hion; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions having chang'd modes for Hair and Clothes accordingly, as they have fancy'd more becommingne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>utablene<U+017F>s in one fa<U+017F>hion than in another. Four hundred years together there was no Barber at <hi>Rome,</hi> the fir<U+017F>t being carry'd thither from <hi>Sicily</hi> by <hi>Ticinius Menas,</hi> Anno <hi>V. C.</hi> 454; and after that time 'twas accounted with them a note of barbarity and extream de<U+017F>olation to let their Hair and Beards grow, as <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> did after the defeat of <hi>Varus.</hi> The French have been as mutable in this matter as in any other; Their Kings of the two fir<U+017F>t Races, wearing long bu<U+017F>hes of Hair, in token of liberty. And <U+017F>ince <hi>Francis</hi> the Fir<U+017F>t, who <U+017F>hav'd his Hair upon occa<U+017F>ion of a wound in his Head, and let his Beard grow to hide the deformity of <U+017F>carrs remaining in his Face after other wounds; <U+017F>hort Hair and long Beards began to be in reque<U+017F>t, and continued <U+017F>o till our Age, wherein Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigs

are more the mode than ever; which being to be grounded upon convenience or <U+017F>eemline<U+017F>s, I <U+017F>ee nothing that can ju<U+017F>tifie the great bu<U+017F>h but Caprichio and Example. For Hair being a <U+017F>uperfluous Excrement, its exorbitant greatne<U+017F>s cannot but be incommodious and prejudicial to Health, and the good Con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Brain; the fuliginous vapors whereof, being reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>s'd by the abundance of Hair, cau<U+017F>e Vertigoes and pains of the Head, not more certainly cur'd than by <U+017F>having the Head. As for <U+017F>eemline<U+017F>s, much Hair is rather frightful than hand<U+017F>ome, and our Ance<U+017F>tors were no le<U+017F>s comely per<U+017F>ons than we, though they wore <U+017F>hort Hair; as at this day al<U+017F>o do many warlike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Enemies of <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s and delicacy, whereof great Hair is a mo<U+017F>t certain token, being proper to Women, as on the contrary, the long Beard is a note of Virility. For ina<U+017F>much as he that loves, conformes as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to what he loves, we may judge of the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s and di<U+017F><U+017F>olutene<U+017F>s of the manners of this time, by the de<U+017F>ire Men have to render them<U+017F>elves as like Women as they can, by wearing (like them) much Hair and little Beard: For when Men wore <U+017F>horter Hair, long Beards were in reque<U+017F>t; and when the Hair ha's been long, the Beards have almo<U+017F>t ever been <U+017F>hort; the length of the one recompencing the brevity of the other, which would otherwi<U+017F>e render Men hideous.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid. If ever 'twas true that Cu<U+017F>tom is a Tyrant, 'tis in this Ca<U+017F>e, no variation having been <U+017F>o much as in matter of Hair. The <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi> wore both Hair and Beard long, thereby to terrifie their Enemies. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> who<U+017F>e Hair is much commended by <hi>Homer,</hi> kept it long, to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h them<U+017F>elves from their <U+017F>laves, who were <U+017F>horn, as at pre<U+017F>ent are Galley-<U+017F>laves, Artizans, and Mona<U+017F>ticks for Humility; whom al<U+017F>o <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> Bi<U+017F>hop of <hi>Paris,</hi> caus'd to <U+017F>have their Hair and Beard in the year 1160, according to the 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Canon of the Fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which forbids Clerks to wear either Locks or Beards. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> wear their Hair long, and <U+017F>have off their Beards. The <hi>Maxii,</hi> a people of <hi>Africa,</hi> are <U+017F>horn on one <U+017F>ide of the Head, and let the Hair grow on the other. The <hi>Abaudi,</hi> had the fore-part onely <U+017F>haven, the <hi>Antii</hi> contrary. The <hi>Arabians</hi> <U+017F>have even their Daughters round about, leaving a Lock on the top. The <hi>Armenians</hi> <U+017F>have their Hair into the form of a Cro<U+017F>s; but there is <U+017F>omething more maje<U+017F>tical in the Beard than in the Hair, and even Animals fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>ht there-with, <U+017F>eem to have <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort of gravity more than others. Hence <U+017F>uch as have affected the title of Wi<U+017F>e, have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e <U+017F>uffer'd their Beards to grow; but the <hi>Ephori</hi> made the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> cut theirs, as al<U+017F>o <hi>Alexander</hi> and many Captains did their Souldiers, le<U+017F>t their Enemies might catch hold of them. But as the caprichio of per<U+017F>ons of authority, e<U+017F>pecially Courtiers, gives the fir<U+017F>t model of fa<U+017F>hions, particularly, as to Hair and Beard; <U+017F>o to wear <U+017F>hort Hair now every one's reaches to his wa<U+017F>te; or a magi<U+017F>terial <U+017F>pade Beard, now all are clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>haven,

            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, Hair, which is rather the leavs and boughs, than (as <hi>Plato</hi> held) the roots of Man's Body, (which he terms a Tree revers'd) having been chiefly de<U+017F>ign'd for pre<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Brain from External Injuries; they who would have care of their Health, mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ult the Con<U+017F>titution of their Brain before they determine either for long or <U+017F>hort Hair. Cold and Moi<U+017F>t Brains, need <U+017F>tore of Hair to fence off the cold Air; Hot and Dry, the contrary. As for the Hair of the Chin, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign'd onely for Ornament, and a Te<U+017F>timony of the Authority which the Male hath above the Female; whence that part <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>acred, it being an Injury to touch one's Beard, of which the Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> made <U+017F>uch account, that according to <hi>Cu<U+017F>pinian,</hi> he was wont to <U+017F>wear by his own. The proportion of it ought to follow the model of others of like condition; Wi<U+017F>e Men following the advice of the greate<U+017F>t number in matters indifferent, provided they be not contrary to Hone<U+017F>ty and Health.</p>

            <p>STates being compos'd of Realms or Provinces, the<U+017F>e of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns, the<U+017F>e of Families, the<U+017F>e of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons, and each Per<U+017F>on having Natural Cau<U+017F>es; 'tis clear that the Alteration of the Whole is to be attributed to the <U+017F>ame Cau<U+017F>es which make the change of its parts. Thus when all the Hou<U+017F>es of a Town are afflicted with Pe<U+017F>tilence, or con<U+017F>um'd by Fire, (which Accidents are capable of producing great Mutations in a Common-wealth) it cannot be otherwi<U+017F>e expre<U+017F>s'd, but by <U+017F>aying, that the Town is burnt or wa<U+017F>ted by the Plague. And as when the particular <U+017F>uffrages of each Coun<U+017F>ellor tend to the ab<U+017F>olution or condemnation of a Criminal, 'twere <U+017F>en<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ay, that the Sentence of the Court were other than that of the Pre<U+017F>ident and Coun<U+017F>ellors; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o it is ridiculous to <U+017F>ay, that the Cau<U+017F>es of per<U+017F>onal mutations are Natural, but not tho<U+017F>e of Political. As therefore 'tis almo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ole demon<U+017F>tration we have in Phy<U+017F>icks, that our Bodies are chang'd and corrupted, becau<U+017F>e they are compos'd of the four Elements; in like <U+017F>ort, I conceive, the Cau<U+017F>e of alteration befalling the body of a State, is to be <U+017F>ought in the Collection of the <U+017F>everal members that compo<U+017F>e it; which

            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, If God hath re<U+017F>erv'd any thing to his own di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al, 'tis that of Crowns and the pre<U+017F>ervation of States, which are the fir<U+017F>t and univer<U+017F>al Cau<U+017F>es of the <U+017F>afety of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular per<U+017F>on. Whence the transferring of tho<U+017F>e Crowns, from one State to another, which is a greater my<U+017F>tery, is a mutation purely <U+017F>upernatural; as not onely God him<U+017F>elf hath manife<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he <U+017F>ubjected the State of the I<U+017F>raelites fir<U+017F>t to Judges and Captains, which was a kind of Ari<U+017F>tocracy, and afterwards to Kings reducing them to a Monarchy; but al<U+017F>o all <U+017F>uch as have wrought great changes in States of the World: And Legi<U+017F>lators knowing this belief imprinted in all Men's Minds, have affected the Reputation of being de<U+017F>cended from, or favor'd by <U+017F>ome Deity, as did <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Numa Pompilius.</hi> Moreover, the Holy Scripture attributes to God the changing of Scepters, and frequently <U+017F>tyles him the God of Battels, the winning and lo<U+017F>ing whereof, are the mo<U+017F>t common and manife<U+017F>t Cau<U+017F>es of the change of States. And 'tis a pure effect of the Divine Will, that Men born free, <U+017F>ubject them<U+017F>elves to the Will of one <U+017F>ole or few per<U+017F>ons; <U+017F>o the changing of that Inclination, cannot proceed but from Him who is the <U+017F>earcher of Hearts, and gives us both to will and to do. If Natural Cau<U+017F>es had their effects, as certain in Politicks as in Phy<U+017F>icks, States <U+017F>hould have their limited du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as Plants and Animals have: and yet there is <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion in the duration of all States, pa<U+017F>t and pre<U+017F>ent, that one hath la<U+017F>ted above 1200. years, (as the French Monarchy, who<U+017F>e flouri<U+017F>hing State promi<U+017F>es as many more Ages, if the World continue <U+017F>o long) and another hath chang'd its Form <U+017F>everal times in one yeat, as <hi>Florence.</hi> Upon which con<U+017F>ideration, the greate<U+017F>t Politicians have put their States under the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and caus'd all their Subjects to venerate <U+017F>ome particular Angel or tutelar Saint. Thus <hi>France</hi> acknowledges Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> for its Protector; <hi>Spain,</hi> Saint <hi>James; Venice,</hi> Saint <hi>Mark</hi>; and even the Ethnicks thought that a City, (much le<U+017F>s a State) could not be de<U+017F>troy'd till the Deity pre<U+017F>iding over it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd.

And as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> <U+017F>aith, tho<U+017F>e that deny Vertue would not be otherwi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>puted with but by ca<U+017F>ting them into the fire; <U+017F>o would not I otherwi<U+017F>e pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h tho<U+017F>e that decry it, but by expo<U+017F>ing them to freez in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winter, in<U+017F>tead of burning a faggot for them. What could little Children and old people do without it? For though the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat be of another kind then that of our material fire, yet this <U+017F>ometimes a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts that in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort that tho<U+017F>e who dige<U+017F>t ill are much comforted by it, not to mention weak per<U+017F>ons and tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>ubject to <U+017F>woonings. Moreover, the external cold mu<U+017F>t be remov'd by an external heat, as Fire is, which heats only what part and to what degree you plea<U+017F>e; but motion heats all alike. As the Sun (which <U+017F>ome Philo<U+017F>ophers take to be the Elemental-fire) contributes to the Generation, <U+017F>o doth Fire concur to the con<U+017F>ervation of Man; not by immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, but by the heat which it communicates to the Air and the Air to our Body, which by approaching or receding from it, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers its exce<U+017F>s in di<U+017F>cretion, and thereby renders it <U+017F>utable to our natural heat, not de<U+017F>troying Bodies but in its highe<U+017F>t degree; as al<U+017F>o the Sun offends tho<U+017F>e at Noon whom it refre<U+017F>hes at ri<U+017F>ing and <U+017F>etting.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the violent action of Fire which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troys all <U+017F>ublunary Bodies, argues its di<U+017F>proportion with our natural heat; which di<U+017F>proportion renders the Stoves and places heated artificially by Fire <U+017F>o noxious, and makes <U+017F>uch as love the Chimney-corner almo<U+017F>t always tender, <U+017F>cabby, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66371:108"/>
of the lea<U+017F>t inclemency of the Air; that heat again<U+017F>t nature not only de<U+017F>troying the natural but corrupting the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and ex<U+017F>iccating the parts. But the bodies of Plants and Animals inur'd onely to natural heat are far more vigorous, whil<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame is <U+017F>ecured again<U+017F>t external cold by Bark, Hair and Skin, and tho<U+017F>e defen<U+017F>ive Arms which In<U+017F>tinct taught our Fore-fathers <U+017F>o long as they were guided by Nature, in Caves of the Earth which moderate the injuries of the Air much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then humane Art can do; or el<U+017F>e by thick clothing which reflects the fumes ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the pores of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; from which repercu<U+017F><U+017F>ion, proceeds the warmth of our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If cold happen at any time to over-ma<U+017F>ter the natural heat in the external parts, the <U+017F>ame is pre<U+017F>ently reviv'd (but di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ipated by fire, before which infirm per<U+017F>ons frequently fall into fainting fits) by motion and exerci<U+017F>e which heats all Bodies, and much more <U+017F>uch as are animated, driving the Spirits and Blood (and with them heat) into the agitated part. Of the benefit of which motion we cannot judge more certainly then by its effects. For as Fire takes away the Appetite and dulls the Sen<U+017F>es of tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>it at it, <U+017F>o Exerci<U+017F>e encrea<U+017F>es it and renders the Body and Mind much more lively. Wherefore I conclude for Exerci<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t Fire, without which a late Phy<U+017F>ician liv'd twenty years, <U+017F>eeing no other but that of his Candle, and without employing his Wood, as <hi>Sylvius</hi> did who run up and down Stairs laden with two or three Fagots, more or le<U+017F>s according as he was cold, till he was warm, and then he laid them up till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Exerci<U+017F>e is not more profitable to <U+017F>uch as are accu<U+017F>tom'd to it, then hurtful to others. Which Sedentary per<U+017F>ons find true when they play at Tennis, or Hunt, or u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch other violent motion. For every <U+017F>ort of motion is not Exerci<U+017F>e, but only that which is perform'd with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>treining, whereby re<U+017F>piration is render'd more frequent, the Arteries dilated, the Spirits and blood chaf'd, whence oftentimes they break their ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and beget Fevers, Pleuri<U+017F>es, Fluxes, Head-aches and Catarrhs: which is a manife<U+017F>t proof that 'tis better to leave the Humors and Spirits in their natural temper. For Health con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in a ju<U+017F>t proportion of the Humors, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Concoction of temperate and moderate Food; which Concoction is perform'd better during re<U+017F>t then during motion, and in the <U+017F>leep of the night then in the labour of the day. So al<U+017F>o are excrements better expell'd when the Body is quiet then when 'tis in motion, which brings a confu<U+017F>ion of pure with impure; In<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible tran<U+017F>piration is <U+017F>ufficiently effected only by the internal motion of Nature without the help of external, which Nature hath not pre<U+017F>crib'd Animals, although they have no need of Fire, being naturally Furr'd, Feather'd, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e guarded again<U+017F>t the injuries of weather, and yet their age is almo<U+017F>t as regular as that of immovable Plants. Man, on the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66371:109"/>
contrary, by rea<U+017F>on chiefly of his <U+017F>everal violent exerci<U+017F>es hath no prefix'd time of life, which labour (in<U+017F>eparable from exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e) wears and con<U+017F>umes more then his years, and makes him old before his time, depriving him al<U+017F>o of that contentment and plea<U+017F>ure which makes us live. Moreover, <U+017F>ince things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd and acquir'd by the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>es, lo<U+017F>t health which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by re<U+017F>t and the bed, cannot be pre<U+017F>erv'd by travel; which, be<U+017F>ides con<U+017F>uming our radical moi<U+017F>ture <U+017F>wifter then the natural heat doth alone, hath the <U+017F>ame effect that motion hath in a lighted Candle which is <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>pent when <U+017F>tirr'd then when at quiet.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ince Fire introduces into us a foreign and contranatural heat, as be<U+017F>ides the inconveniences already alledg'd, the <U+017F>weating of the head te<U+017F>tifies, 'tis more hurtful then Exerci<U+017F>e, which only rou<U+017F>es up the natural heat enfeebled by the apertion of the pores caus'd by the Fire in Winter and the Sun in Summer, when for that rea<U+017F>on Exerci<U+017F>e ought to be le<U+017F>s. The incommodity Exerci<U+017F>e brings to unaccu<U+017F>tom'd Bodies ought not to hinder their being form'd thereto by little and little, and by the degrees recommended by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in all changes. For if Phy<U+017F>icians contribute all their <U+017F>kill to correct di<U+017F>tempers drawn from the birth, much rather may they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to turn bad cu<U+017F>toms into good; as being an ea<U+017F>ier ta<U+017F>k. Thus <hi>Galen</hi> was not accu<U+017F>tom'd to cleave wood, nor <hi>Pittacus</hi> King of the Mytelenians to grind corn, yet they exercis'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves in the<U+017F>e labours for their health. And indeed <U+017F>ome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, as tho<U+017F>e which proceed from a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper, are cur'd by exerci<U+017F>e; e<U+017F>pecially if they come from repletion. Thus <hi>Nicomachus</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi> was <U+017F>o mon<U+017F>trou<U+017F>ly fat that he could not put his hand behind him, yet was brought to a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bulk by Exerci<U+017F>e. On the contrary, <hi>Germanicus</hi> who<U+017F>e legs were <U+017F>omewhat too <U+017F>lender brought them to a competent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion by Riding; the concu<U+017F><U+017F>ions whereof <U+017F>hake the Stone out of the Kidneys. Recovering per<U+017F>ons need Exerci<U+017F>e <U+017F>o much, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <U+017F>trength that 'tis the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>afe means of re<U+017F>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and old men are chiefly pre<U+017F>erv'd by it. <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Phy<U+017F>ician and <hi>Spurnia,</hi> both of them 80 years old, pre<U+017F>erv'd their Sen<U+017F>es and <U+017F>trength, entire by walking a great way every day on foot. And yet Fire is le<U+017F>s hurtful in that age by rea<U+017F>on of the coldne<U+017F>s and thickne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>kin which gives not its heat <U+017F>o free entrance, nor <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie an i<U+017F><U+017F>ue to that within.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLII. Whether Wine helps or hinders Dige<U+017F>tion, and why?</head>
            <p>THis Que<U+017F>tion will <U+017F>eem frivolous to the vulgar, who are no <U+017F>ooner debarr'd Wine by the Phy<U+017F>itian, but they complain of Indige<U+017F>tion and weakne<U+017F>s of Stomack. But our free Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophy <U+017F>hall u<U+017F>e its own rights, and inquire, whether the common Opinion in this Point be the be<U+017F>t. Now if Wine, which is hot, and acknowledg'd <U+017F>uch by all Phy<U+017F>itians, be receiv'd into a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Stomack, it brings it into a di<U+017F>temper, whence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyn'd it not to <hi>Timothy,</hi> but in regard of the coldne<U+017F>s or weakne<U+017F>s of his Stomack, in which ca<U+017F>e a due temper re<U+017F>ults from the one cold, and the other hot. But temperate per<U+017F>ons mu<U+017F>t avoid it's u<U+017F>e, which was a ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of Divorce to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Dames, capital in the Camp of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and <U+017F>till in divers parts of <hi>A<U+017F>ia</hi>; whereunto if you add, all tho<U+017F>e that are depriv'd of it, becau<U+017F>e they have none produc'd among<U+017F>t them, Children and <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>ons, it will appear that (to <U+017F>ay nothing of Bea<U+017F>ts, which drink onely water, and are more healthy than we) there are a hundred live without it for one that drinks it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they who are troubled with Indige<U+017F>tions, find and make others <U+017F>ufficiently under<U+017F>tand, that Wine is la<U+017F>t dige<U+017F>ted; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e it would not keep its fir<U+017F>t colour, <U+017F>avor, and <U+017F>mell, after all other food, or at lea<U+017F>t onely alter'd by the acidity into which 'tis ea<U+017F>ily corrupted. Be<U+017F>ides, Water-drinkers have a better Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite than Wine-drinkers, which is an Argument that Wine helps Concoction le<U+017F>s then Water; and no wonder, <U+017F>ince, as <hi>Galen</hi> <U+017F>aith, it increa<U+017F>es Thir<U+017F>t in<U+017F>tead of quenching it as Water doth. For Thir<U+017F>t, which is the Appetite of Cold and Moi<U+017F>t, cannot be extingui<U+017F>h'd by Wine, which is Hot, and <U+017F>o more apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame it. The Life of the fir<U+017F>t Patriarch, before the u<U+017F>e of Wine, namely, before the Deluge, was much longer than it hath been <U+017F>ince; and, no doubt, the principal defect in Man, and the Cau<U+017F>e of mo<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, is bad Dige<U+017F>tion.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Dige<U+017F>tion being perform'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of Spirits elaborated in the Spleen, and Wine which is more <U+017F>pirituous, and con<U+017F>equently, furni<U+017F>hes more matter for our Spirits than any other Aliment, cannot but powerfully promote the <U+017F>ame. Which clearly appears by old men, in whom Wine hath the <U+017F>ame Effect that Milk hath in Children, and pre<U+017F>erves the<U+017F>e latter from Worms. Whence po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <hi>Hippocates</hi> gave it not onely in Quotidian, but al<U+017F>o in Continual Fevers; the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne<U+017F>s to be fear'd from its heat, were it conjoyn'd with dryne<U+017F>s, being <U+017F>ecur'd by its humidity, which makes it <U+017F>ymbolize with blood. Yet all Wines are not hot; <U+017F>mall green Wines, e<U+017F>pecially the White and Sharp, have more of coldne<U+017F>s than of heat; and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:66371:110"/>
other Wines drunk in <U+017F>mall quantity with much water, refre<U+017F>h more than water alone, becau<U+017F>e opening the Pores, they in<U+017F>inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate into the remote parts, which plain water pre<U+017F>ently clo<U+017F>es. Yea, Wine, as hot, is a friend to the Stomack and Bowels, who<U+017F>e membranous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance being cold and dry, needs the contrary qualities of Wine; wherefore Wine helps Dige<U+017F>tion, which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hinders, being indige<U+017F>tible it <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>o unable to give what it hath not. God's di<U+017F>covering Wine to Men after the Flood, as a remedy to the defect, left thereby in all Creatures <U+017F>erving for their food, being rather an evidence of its utility than hurtfulne<U+017F>s. And there is as little rea<U+017F>on to accu<U+017F>e it of <U+017F>hortning our dayes, as <hi>Guaicum</hi> of cau<U+017F>ing the Pox, upon pretence that the u<U+017F>e thereof was not known till that Malady appearing, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for its Cure.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the <U+017F>ole rea<U+017F>on of the difficulty we find in dige<U+017F>ting Wine, is the great re<U+017F>emblance of its qualities with tho<U+017F>e of Blood, both being Hot and Moi<U+017F>t. But there can be no proper Phy<U+017F>ical Action without contrariety. For <U+017F>ince every principal Agent induces Alteration in the <U+017F>ubject which receives its Action, this change cannot be effected, but by depriving it of its former State, and the qualities which maintain'd the <U+017F>ame. Which cannot be done, but by conte<U+017F>ting with, and de<U+017F>troying them by contrary qualities; and <U+017F>o according to more or le<U+017F>s contrariety, the Action is <U+017F>tronger or weaker. Hence in the Dige<U+017F>tion of Aliment, which is a proper Phy<U+017F>ical Action, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Natural Heat de<U+017F>troyes the Food, in order to turn it into another Form, there mu<U+017F>t be contrariety; and <U+017F>uch Food as ha's lea<U+017F>t, gives the Heat lea<U+017F>t hold to work again<U+017F>t it; it not being ea<U+017F>ie for the Natural Heat and Moi<U+017F>ture to act again<U+017F>t an Aliment Hot and Moi<U+017F>t, by rea<U+017F>on of the re<U+017F>emblance between them; as a Friend hardly combats and de<U+017F>troyes his Friend. Wherefore Wine being of the <U+017F>ame quality, our Heat becoms idle in order to its Concoction. Po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly too, its abundance of Spirits make it hard to be dige<U+017F>ted, <U+017F>tifling the Spirits employ'd for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, by rea<U+017F>on of the too great re<U+017F>emblance between tho<U+017F>e of the one and the other.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That onely a di<U+017F>proportionate quantity of Wine is of difficult Dige<U+017F>tion, a <U+017F>mall quantity promoting it. Which holds good in all repletions, but, particularly, of Wine; which relaxing the Fibres and Tunicles of the Stomack, weakens the Retentive Faculty, provokes the Expul<U+017F>ive by its Acrimony, either in the Superior Orifice, whence ari<U+017F>e Hick-cocks; or in the Inferior, whence proceed loathings and vomitings. Therefore the Apo<U+017F>tle <U+017F>aith, Drink a little (not drink much) Wine. Nor would the inconvenience be le<U+017F>s, if the be<U+017F>t Aliments in the World were taken in Exce<U+017F>s. For when their ma<U+017F>s is too great to be con<U+017F>tring'd and embrac'd by the Stomack, the Natural Heat is it <U+017F>elf alter'd in<U+017F>tead of over-ma<U+017F>tering that, in order to A<U+017F><U+017F>imilation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:66371:110"/>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the Que<U+017F>tion is to be determin'd by the difference of Wines and Stomacks. Strong Wines, <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>weet and piquant, are improper for Hot and Cholerick Stomacks which mu<U+017F>t have only <U+017F>mall green Wines, or other beverages of neer quality to common water. On the contrary, Phlegmatick and Cold Stomacks, and Melancholy Tempers, are <U+017F>trengthened by Wine, but prejudic'd by water and other cold drinks; not that Heat is the cau<U+017F>e of Dige<U+017F>tion, (for the hotter a Fever is, the more it hinders the <U+017F>ame) but becau<U+017F>e 'tis a <hi>Medium,</hi> whereof our Natural Heat <U+017F>erves it <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid. That indeed the diver<U+017F>ity of Subjects makes <U+017F>ome change in the Hypothe<U+017F>is, yet hinders not but we may pronounce upon the The<U+017F>is; whether Wine helps or hurts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>tion. I believe the latter; becau<U+017F>e Dige<U+017F>tion cannot be perform'd, unle<U+017F>s all the Meats of one meal be dige<U+017F>ted at the <U+017F>ame time; el<U+017F>e the Chyle will be, part well elaborated (namely, that made of the Food which hath had a convenient <U+017F>tay in the Stomack) and part too much concoct and adu<U+017F>t, made of that which <U+017F>tay'd in the Stomack too long and after Dige<U+017F>tion; and part al<U+017F>o too little, proceeding from Meats requiring more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and yet hurried away with the re<U+017F>t. Now 'tis certain, that Wine being <U+017F>ooner dige<U+017F>ted than other Aliments, by the authority of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> (who hold, that it a<U+017F><U+017F>wages Thir<U+017F>t, and is di<U+017F>tributed <U+017F>ooner than they) it will produce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion and hotch-potch in the nature of the Chyle, which <U+017F>hould be uniform. But Water <U+017F>erving only for a Vehicle, agrees better with variety of Meats, being like the Men<U+017F>truum of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ts, and the Uniting <hi>Medium</hi> of the <hi>Lulli<U+017F>ts,</hi> which <U+017F>erves to re-unite all different Bodies into one alone, patiently attending their di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition without corrupting, (as Wine and Vinegar doth) and without leaving behind in the Kidneys the tartar, or lee of Wine, which is the <U+017F>eed of the Stone, where-with Water-drinkers are not <U+017F>o commonly troubled; partly, for the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid rea<U+017F>on, and partly, becau<U+017F>e that tartar is not dry'd in them, as having le<U+017F>s Heat than others.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLIII. Why 'tis colder at Day-break than at any other time of the Night or Day.</head>
            <p>IF Cold be a real quality, then the greater di<U+017F>tance there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be between it and the Source of Heat and Light, (the Sun) the greater mu<U+017F>t the Cold be. And if it be only a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heat, then mid-night is darker then either the Evening or Morning, becau<U+017F>e oppos'd directly to the Light of the Sun, it may <U+017F>eem that the Cold ought be greater likewi<U+017F>e at that time,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66371:111"/>
becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame is oppo<U+017F>ite to Noon, when the Sun's Heat is greate<U+017F>t; yet the cool of the Morning argues the contrary, being <U+017F>o ordinary that it fore-tells Day-break more certainly, than the crowing of the Cock. Unle<U+017F>s you will attribute the cau<U+017F>e to this, that at Morning before Sun-ri<U+017F>e 'tis longer <U+017F>ince the Sun in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned the Horizon, than at mid-night; at which time the Air and other Elements, <U+017F>till retain <U+017F>ome of the preceding Day's Heat, which tempering the Cold, occa<U+017F>ion'd by the Sun's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence, renders the <U+017F>ame le<U+017F>s perceptible during the thickne<U+017F>s of the Nocturnal Air, le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ubtile than that of the Day; when the Light coming to di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate tho<U+017F>e Clouds, <U+017F>ubtilizes the Air by its in<U+017F>inuating beams; whence the Cold thereof more ea<U+017F>ily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inuates into our Pores by the help of that weak Light, which is not <U+017F>trong enough to heat the Air. Ju<U+017F>t as Vinegar, though hot and biting of its own Nature, yet mix'd with much water, cooles the part whereunto 'tis apply'd more than water alone doth.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly the compari<U+017F>on of the Heat of our beds, (out of which we ari<U+017F>e in the Morning) with the cold of the outward Air, makes us guilty of a mi<U+017F>take; unle<U+017F>s you had rather refer this Effect to the Oblique A<U+017F>pect where-with the other Cele<U+017F>tial Bodies of our Hemi<U+017F>phere are regarded by the Sun at his ri<U+017F>ing. For at mid-night when he is directly under the Horizon, the little bulk of the Earth hinders not, but he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly darts his Rayes upon tho<U+017F>e Stars which are above us, the Pyramid of the Earth's <U+017F>hadow not pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing beyond the Moon; <U+017F>o that then the va<U+017F>t and incredible magnitude of all tho<U+017F>e Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tial Bodies perpendicularly reflects upon us the Heat and Light of the Sun, which thus reflected may calefie the Air, as the Sun doth in the <U+017F>ame po<U+017F>ture; but not at all at Sun-ri<U+017F>e in their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique A<U+017F>pects: Whence though the Sun be nearer us in Winter, yet he warms us le<U+017F>s. If it be excepted, that the Evening, when the <U+017F>ame Oblique A<U+017F>pects return, is not <U+017F>o cold as the Night; 'tis an<U+017F>wer'd, that this difference proceeds from the Heat of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Day, remaining in the Earth, Water, and Air, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame, till by the ab<U+017F>ence of the Sun the <U+017F>upervening Night wholly di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate them.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Matutinal coolne<U+017F>s proceeded from the approaching Suns driving the Clouds before him, which agitation rai<U+017F>eth a wind (as there is always one at day-break) whereby the <U+017F>ame coolne<U+017F>s is effected in the Air that a Fan cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth to a Lady. For all things here below having their motion from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t, 'tis rea<U+017F>onable that the Air be <U+017F>o mov'd too, and acquire the con<U+017F>equent of its agitation, namely, coldne<U+017F>s. That all things come from the Ea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>undry in<U+017F>tances manife<U+017F>t; Mankind was from thence diffus'd into the other Quarters of the World; Rivers run generally Ea<U+017F>tward; And the greater <U+017F>peed of Navigation from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t, than contrarily, argnes the Sea to have the <U+017F>ame motion; as is chiefly ob<U+017F>erv'd under the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66371:111"/>
Equinoctial, the greatne<U+017F>s of which Circle renders that motion more manife<U+017F>t. This rule the Winds keep, when not diverted to a contrary cour<U+017F>e by Exhalations: And as for the Heavens, experience <U+017F>hews us, that their ordinary and be<U+017F>t-known cour<U+017F>e is from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t: So that 'tis no wonder if they hurry the neighbouring Air with them, and by a Mathematical contact and natural con<U+017F>ecution, all the other Elements. I <U+017F>peak not of Sciences, Arts, Policy, and other things which the more curious may find to have been deriv'd from the Ea<U+017F>t. It <U+017F>uffices that the Sun taking this road drives the Air befor him; the wind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from which motion, cau<U+017F>eth the coolne<U+017F>s we feel chiefly at day-break; when the vapours between us and the Sun being by his heat violently driven (as the water of the <hi>Aeolipila</hi> is turn'd into wind and driven forth by the <U+017F>ubjacent fire) the coolne<U+017F>s is more unacceptable, in that it <U+017F>ucceeds and multiplies (in<U+017F>tead of dimini<U+017F>hing) that of the night, as the diurnal heat in likelihood ought to do.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, He attributed the increa<U+017F>e of cold at day-break to the ordinary action of all natural Agents, which is <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t when they arrive at the period or utmo<U+017F>t point of their declination. So a Candle ju<U+017F>t upon extingui<U+017F>hing ca<U+017F>ts forth a <U+017F>marter flame; the violence of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is greate<U+017F>t at its cri<U+017F>is, when 'tis towards ending; a Stone moves <U+017F>wifte<U+017F>t as it approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its Centre. And to compare the Year to the Day, the cold is commonly greater and more in<U+017F>upportable in <hi>February,</hi> the la<U+017F>t Moneth of Winter, than in the beginning thereof; though in rea<U+017F>on it might <U+017F>eem rather to be <U+017F>o at the end of <hi>December,</hi> when the Sun is further from us, and that the cu<U+017F>tom of the two fir<U+017F>t months cold <U+017F>hould render this la<U+017F>t more tolerable; as on the contrary, the heat is greater al<U+017F>o in the dog-days, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, than at the Summer Sol<U+017F>tice, when the Sun is elevated highe<U+017F>t above our heads. So al<U+017F>o in Summer 'tis hotter two hours after noon, than at noon it <U+017F>elf; not <U+017F>o much through any di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition already received in the Air and Earth, as by rea<U+017F>on of that Rule, That Natural Actions are <U+017F>tronger at the end than the beginning; whereas violent actions, as the motion of a Stone upwards, is <U+017F>wifter in the beginning than the end.</p>
            <p>The Fifth referr'd this effect to the Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is of heat and cold. For as fire <U+017F>eems more <U+017F>corching upon the approach of a great fro<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o by a contrary rea<U+017F>on cold mu<U+017F>t become more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement at the approach of the Sun's heat. Moreover, the like combat is ob<U+017F>erv'd between the thickne<U+017F>s of the darkne<U+017F>s of the night, and the rarity of the day, when the Sun's light rendring the illuminated Air more <U+017F>ubtle, what was gro<U+017F>s in the dark Air cannot be expell'd in an in<U+017F>tant without <U+017F>ome conflict and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the part condens'd by darkne<U+017F>s with the rarefi'd by light; from which agitation ari<U+017F>eth a wind commonly at day-break, which is probably the cau<U+017F>e of the cold at that time. Now of that tenebrous part condens'd is made the Dew and Fro<U+017F>t in our
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66371:112"/>
Climate, and the <hi>Manna</hi> in Southern Countries; as the cold which we feel redoubled in Winter in the <U+017F>pace between a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring fire (but out of its Sphere of Activity) and the re<U+017F>t of the Air, is a familiar example of this Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is of heat and cold redoubled upon the approach one of the other. For as 'tis much colder then el<U+017F>ewhere, between that fire which is too di<U+017F>tant to warm us, and the Air left in its natural frigidity; <U+017F>o at day-break our Air being too far off from the Sun to be heated by it, augments its coldne<U+017F>s upon his approach.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, Air hath no natural quality but <U+017F>upream hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, whereby 'tis <U+017F>upple, movable, and pliant; heat and cold being impre<U+017F>s'd upon it by outward agents: Otherwi<U+017F>e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general medium and mediator of motions local, natural, vital and animal (for the Spirits are of an aerious nature) and the Factor of all Agents by who<U+017F>e intervention they communicate their influences, it would act again<U+017F>t the qualities impre<U+017F>s'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <U+017F>ometimes hot and <U+017F>ometimes cold, and de<U+017F>troy them by its own. Which indeed its humidity doth, but to the profit of animated bodies; dryne<U+017F>s being their enemy. Hence cold and dry <hi>Saturn</hi> hath under him, hot and moi<U+017F>t <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who tempers his hurtfulne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>utes him to living things. Now the Sun having at the declining of the day rais'd many aqueous, and con<U+017F>equently <U+017F>upreamly cold, and the heat whereby they were rais'd abandoning them upon his ab<U+017F>ence, the natural cold of tho<U+017F>e vapours becomes predominant, and returns them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees into their fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tate. Which refrigerating the Air makes the night the colder, the further the vapours are from their extraneous heat, that is to <U+017F>ay, the nearer day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLIV. Whence the whitene<U+017F>s of Snow proceeds.</head>
            <p>THe fir<U+017F>t attributed the cau<U+017F>e thereof to the de<U+017F>iccation of water; for experience <U+017F>hews in all <U+017F>ublunary Bodies that dryne<U+017F>s whitens, as Sea-water becomes white when dry'd to Salt, the <U+017F>talks of Corn, Pul<U+017F>e and the leaves of all other Plants wax white as they wither and dry. The <U+017F>ame happens to the Bones of Animals, and grey Hairs, on no other cau<U+017F>e but <U+017F>iccity, <U+017F>ince the extremity expos'd to the Air is white, but not the root. Hence water by its tran<U+017F>parence already partaking much of light (but which its rarity reflects not to our view) is no <U+017F>ooner de<U+017F>ic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated into Ice, Hail, or Snow, but it acquires this pure white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, which humidity again de<U+017F>troys. So the high ways white with du<U+017F>t grow black upon rain; a wet cloth appears darker then a dry; and that <U+017F>ome things become black by drying (as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66371:112"/>
Coal) is becau<U+017F>e there was heat enough to draw the humidity, which was at its Centre, to the Circumference, but not enough wholly to dry it up, as appears in that the <U+017F>ame heat continu'd reduces the coal to white a<U+017F>hes which would be as perfectly white as Snow, did not the Tincture imprinted thereon by the Salts with<U+017F>tand it; for if you urge them further by fire, you will make them of a perfect whitene<U+017F>s; as appears in Chalks, which are made not only of grey and black <U+017F>tones, but even of Metals, as Ceru<U+017F>e is made of Lead.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Whitene<U+017F>s is not a real Colour, <U+017F>ince it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all bodies depriv'd of preceding Colours, of all which 'tis indifferently <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible. But 'tis otherwi<U+017F>e with real Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, a <U+017F>ubject imbu'd with one of which is not apt to receive all others but <U+017F>ome only; as Nature hath fram'd the Organs of Sen<U+017F>e naked of all <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible objects, to the end they might be <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of the <U+017F>ame. Wooll dy'd into a <U+017F>adder colour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive a lighter, and black Wooll admits none at all; but white, being natural to every <U+017F>ubject that hath no colour, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving all: So when you wa<U+017F>h off the blew or dirty colour of a Band, it becomes white. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Whitene<U+017F>s hath the <U+017F>ame reference to Colours that Unity hath to Numbers whereof 'tis the beginning, but is none it <U+017F>elf. And as 'tis the Emblem of Innocence and Purity, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o it proceeds from them. The Air, which is the pure<U+017F>t of our Elements (for Fire is only in Mixts) and water refin'd into vapours, which follows the Air in purity, hapning to acquire vi<U+017F>ibility by conden<U+017F>ation into Snow, cannot repre<U+017F>ent the <U+017F>ame under any other out-<U+017F>ide but Whitene<U+017F>s. Now that Whitene<U+017F>s is an effect of purity, is manife<U+017F>t by the Stars, which are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented to us only under the <U+017F>pecies of Whitene<U+017F>s, and cannot be painted but with white in their light, which de-albating what it irradiates, and leaving the <U+017F>ame el<U+017F>ewhere black, <U+017F>hews that 'tis as the pure<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o the white<U+017F>t thing in the world. Likewi<U+017F>e Metals are whiter according to their purity; Lead is wor<U+017F>e then Tin, and this then Silver only upon account of their impurity; the <U+017F>ole perfect mixture of the yellow incombu<U+017F>tible Sulphur of Gold not permitting it to be alter'd and <U+017F>poil'd of its yellow colour which neare<U+017F>t approacheth whitene<U+017F>s. Wherefore Snow being a mo<U+017F>t pure Body, compounded only of two colour-le<U+017F>s elements, namely, Air and Water, 'twas nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary either that it <U+017F>hould have no colour, or if any (whereby to become vi<U+017F>ible) the principle and origin of all Colours, namely White, in the perfection with which Nature makes all her Works.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the <U+017F>ame difference which appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Stars and their Orbs, is found between Water and Snow, ari<U+017F>ing only from Den<U+017F>ity and Rarity. As the Star ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears white, and the re<U+017F>t of the Heaven darker by rea<U+017F>on of its rarity; <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e Water <U+017F>eems ob<U+017F>cure upon account of its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Snow white upon that of its den<U+017F>ity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:66371:113"/>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, If that rea<U+017F>on were good, then Ice <U+017F>hould be whiter then Snow, becau<U+017F>e 'tis more <U+017F>olid; and yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears. Be<U+017F>ides Snow is <U+017F>o far from being more den<U+017F>e and <U+017F>olid then Water, that on the contrary, there is le<U+017F>s Air in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then in Ice, which is more clo<U+017F>e and compact then Snow; the <U+017F>wimming of Ice upon the Water arguing <U+017F>ome aerious parts included in it at the time of its congelation, which is not and cannot be made without air, Wherefore Snow differs from Water only by its figure or accidental form, which reduceth it into flocks congealed by cold in a cloud (not as it is re<U+017F>olv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rain, for then 'twould prove Hail) but whil<U+017F>t yet a vapour in the region of the Air. So then in this figure alone is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of the whitene<U+017F>s of Snow to be <U+017F>ought; which is not found in water, partly by rea<U+017F>on of its tran<U+017F>parence, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e its <U+017F>mooth <U+017F>urface gives no hold to the vi<U+017F>ual ray. Which is the rea<U+017F>on why Water is pictur'd with a blew and darki<U+017F>h co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Thus burni<U+017F>h'd Silver as that of Looking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>eems dark if compar'd to rough Silver, which doth not di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate our vi<U+017F>ual Spirits as that former doth. Hence Ice is much whiter then water, as being le<U+017F>s <U+017F>mooth.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That 'tis proper to cold to whiten, as 'tis to heat to blacken. Thus Southern People are either black, or tawney; Northern, white: and the Hair of both grows white with old age by rea<U+017F>on of the coldne<U+017F>s thereof. All the cold parts of our Body are white; as the Brain, Bones, Cartilages, Membranes, Fat and Skin. Linen and Wax are whitened by the coldne<U+017F>s of the night. For the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, not only Snow but Hail, Fro<U+017F>t, Ice, Rime, and all other cold Meteors are of the <U+017F>ame colour.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That though the whitene<U+017F>s of Snow was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>puted by <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Armenia</hi> produces red by mixture of the exhalations of Vermillion with the ordinary vapors which the Sun rai<U+017F>es from the water; yet this whitene<U+017F>s is as manife<U+017F>t as the cau<U+017F>es are hid, no le<U+017F>s then tho<U+017F>e of light, which is the colour of Cele<U+017F>tial Bodies, as colours are the light of Terre<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. However, this whitene<U+017F>s <U+017F>eems to proceed from a mixture of Air and Water, as appears in froth, who<U+017F>e con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence is like that of Snow, the whitene<U+017F>s whereof, po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, is increas'd by the Spirits wherewith Snow abounds, which are luminous Bodies, whereof the fertility caus'd by Snow is an Argument; to which Spirits, (which Fro<U+017F>t hath not) may be a<U+017F>crib'd what <hi>Galen</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, namely, that Fi<U+017F>h cover'd with Snow become more delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for to the Moon it can with no more rea<U+017F>on be referr'd than to the Sun.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <U+017F>aid, That an univocal and certain cau<U+017F>e of whitene<U+017F>s cannot be found in the fir<U+017F>t or <U+017F>econd Qualities: Not in Heat or Cold; <U+017F>ince Snow, Sugar, and Salt are equally white, though the fir<U+017F>t is cold, the <U+017F>econd temperate, and the third hot: Nor in Siccity or Humidity; <U+017F>ince humid Milk is no le<U+017F>s white
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66371:113"/>
than dry Chalk and Pla<U+017F>ter. The den<U+017F>ity and weight of Silver, the rarity and levity of Snow, the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of Sugar, and the acrimony of Salt; in <U+017F>hort, the examen of all other Second Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of white things, <U+017F>hews that it depends not on them. Nor yet on the third: for white Agarick is purgative; white Starch, and flowr of Beans, a<U+017F>tringent. La<U+017F>tly, what <U+017F>ome call Fourth Qualities, or Properties of the whole Sub<U+017F>tance, depend as little upon Colours, <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>ame whitene<U+017F>s which is in the Meal that nouri<U+017F>hes us, is al<U+017F>o in the Sublimate that kills us. It remains to inquire the rea<U+017F>on of Colours, and con<U+017F>equently, of Whitene<U+017F>s in the proportion between the Sight and the Surface of the colour'd body. When therefore it happens that the Vi<U+017F>ual Ray, which i<U+017F><U+017F>ues forth pure and white, that is to <U+017F>ay, colour-le<U+017F>s, finds no Colour in a Surface; if the <U+017F>ame be Diaphanous, it takes it for a <hi>Medium</hi> not an Object; (as is <U+017F>een in Gla<U+017F>s, Cry<U+017F>tal, Air, and Water); if opake, it <U+017F>tops at the <U+017F>aid Surface; and finding no Colour thereon, returns with the Species of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to make its report to the Common Sen<U+017F>e that it <U+017F>aw nothing; and this is what they call Whitene<U+017F>s. Hence, White <U+017F>o little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights the Sight, that it di<U+017F>gregates and wearies it; as a fal<U+017F>e <U+017F>troke doth that brings nothing. Now to apply this to Snow, the Vi<U+017F>ual Ray is indeed <U+017F>topt by its condens'd Surface; but whence <U+017F>hould it have Colour, <U+017F>ince 'tis compos'd of Air and Water, both colourle<U+017F>s? The Truth is, <U+017F>utably to its Principles, it mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily remain without Colour, that is, White, whereby it <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gregates the Vi<U+017F>ual Rayes that <U+017F>ometimes it blinded a whole Army.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLV. Whether Courage be natural or acquir'd.</head>
            <p>COurage being the Contempt of Danger, which we naturally fear, we cannot be naturally courageous; for then two contrary Effects <U+017F>hould proceed from the <U+017F>ame Cau<U+017F>e. But the Truth is, our Nature is indifferent to every thing whereunto it is lead and fa<U+017F>hion'd. Thus, <U+017F>kitti<U+017F>h Hor<U+017F>es are made <U+017F>ober by inuring to the noi<U+017F>e of Mu<U+017F>kets, which before they could not endure. On the contrary, brave Cour<U+017F>ers kept in a dark Stable and unemploy'd, become re<U+017F>ty and jadi<U+017F>h. Moreover, <U+017F>ince there is no true Courage without Knowledge of the Danger, (whence Fools and Drunkards cannot be <U+017F>tyl'd courageous) this argues that this Virtue hath need of Rules and Precepts, as without which, our Knowledge cannot but be very imperfect. Nor did any thing render the <hi>Romans</hi> more valiant than the Nations they <U+017F>ubdu'd, but Military Di<U+017F>cipline; wherein the Roman Legion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:66371:114"/>
under-went his Apprenti<U+017F>age, as other Artificers do in their Trades: Which In<U+017F>truction, <U+017F>ome of their De<U+017F>cendents de<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing, have <U+017F>hewn thereby what difference there is between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves and their Ance<U+017F>tours, and determin'd this Que<U+017F>tion to the advantage of Indu<U+017F>try. At this day our Souldiers are not more <U+017F>trong and courageous than Town-people; and the Officers whom alone we <U+017F>ee perform all the brave Actions, <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s not in Courage ordinary Souldiers, <U+017F>aving that the<U+017F>e have not been <U+017F>o well in<U+017F>tructed as they, and reflect not <U+017F>o much upon the <U+017F>hame and lo<U+017F>s which they incurr by Cowardize. And becau<U+017F>e that Courage is greate<U+017F>t, which makes us contemne the greate<U+017F>t dangers; hence that which leads us to the Contempt of Death, the mo<U+017F>t terrible of all things, is, undoubtedly, the greate<U+017F>t. But the Hi<U+017F>tory of the Mile<U+017F>ian Virgins is remarkable, who, upon the per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions of a certain Orator, were, contrary to the natural timidity of their Sex, carry'd to <U+017F>o great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Death, that nothing could re<U+017F>train them from killing them<U+017F>elves, but the example of their Self-murder'd Companions drawn forth-with naked about the <U+017F>treets. Whereby it may be judg'd, how powerful Per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion is to encourage us: Which Captains and Generals of Armies are not ignorant of, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their Rhetorick to impre<U+017F>s Audacity in their Souldiers brea<U+017F>ts, upon an a<U+017F><U+017F>ault or a battel; and tho<U+017F>e that have been in <U+017F>uch encounters, affirm, that nothing conduces more either to inflame the Courage of Brave Men, or infu<U+017F>e it into <U+017F>uch as have none, than an Exhortation well apply'd and <U+017F>uted to the Minds of tho<U+017F>e that are to be encourag'd; <U+017F>ometimes by the Memory of their former Gallant Actions; <U+017F>ometimes by tho<U+017F>e of their Enemies Cowardice; <U+017F>ometimes by the greatne<U+017F>s of the Danger, and the inevitable ruine they incurr in ca<U+017F>e of turning their backs; but commonly, by the <U+017F>alvation of their Souls, and the good of their Country; and always by the fair <U+017F>pur of Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Con<U+017F>iderations directly oppo<U+017F>ite to tho<U+017F>e dictated to us by Nature, which tend onely to pre<U+017F>ervation of the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, If In<U+017F>truction made Men valiant and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageous, than all that receive the <U+017F>ame Education, learn in the <U+017F>ame Academy, and fight under the <U+017F>ame Captain, <U+017F>hould be equally courageous. Yet there is <U+017F>o notable a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, that it cannot be imputed to any but Natural Cau<U+017F>es; <U+017F>uch as are the <U+017F>tructure of the parts of the Body, the temper of the humors, the nimblene<U+017F>s or heavine<U+017F>s of the Spirits, and e<U+017F>pecially the diver<U+017F>ity of Souls which inform our Bodies; which diver<U+017F>ity is apparent even in Infancy, before the Corporeal Organs can be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected to be the Cau<U+017F>e thereof. One Child is more timorous than another, and no <U+017F>ooner begins to go, but he beats his Companions, who <U+017F>uffer them<U+017F>elves to be beaten by one weaker than them<U+017F>elves; the fir<U+017F>t, not quitting his hold for the rod, for which another will do more than you would have him.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:66371:114"/>
The truth is, if the Soul be the Architect of her habitation, to her mu<U+017F>t be imputed the Principal Cau<U+017F>e of the variety found therein, upon that of our Actions vi<U+017F>ibly depends. For as every one readily addicts him<U+017F>elf to tho<U+017F>e employments and exerci<U+017F>es of body and mind whereunto he is mo<U+017F>t fit, and which he performs with mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o he is more ea<U+017F>ily lead to Actions of Courage, who<U+017F>e Organs are be<U+017F>t di<U+017F>pos'd for the <U+017F>ame. And becau<U+017F>e Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren commonly have <U+017F>ome-what of the Habit of Body, and Temper of their Parents, hence Courage <U+017F>eems to come by De<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; which po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly renders our Gentry <U+017F>o jealous of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of their Families, in which they had rather find a Man beheaded for an Action that <U+017F>peaks Courage, than a Burge<U+017F>s who had not liv'd in a noble way. Moreover, to judge well of Courage, we mu<U+017F>t not con<U+017F>ider it <U+017F>olely in Man, <U+017F>ince 'tis found <U+017F>o re<U+017F>plendent in Animals incapable of Di<U+017F>cipline and In<U+017F>truction, that the certaine<U+017F>t Phy<U+017F>iognomical Rule whereby to judge of a Valiant Man, is taken from the <U+017F>imilitude or re<U+017F>emblance he hath with the Lyon, Bear, or other Bea<U+017F>ts of Courage. Which <U+017F>hews that the true and original Valour being in Animals, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts rather alter and pervert, than produce it in us. Hence the mo<U+017F>t learned are oftimes the greate<U+017F>t Pultrons. For which rea<U+017F>ons the <hi>Romans</hi> caus'd the warlike people whom they had <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd, to de<U+017F>cend from the Mountains into the Valleys, that by that means they might change their Nature. Indeed, the<U+017F>e <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were better di<U+017F>ciplin'd than the Nations whom they call'd barbarous, and by that means more ea<U+017F>ily overcame them; but they were not the more courageous for that, he who is vanqui<U+017F>h'd abating nothing of his Courage thereby: witne<U+017F>s King <hi>Porus,</hi> who<U+017F>e Courage <hi>Alexander</hi> more admir'd for his refu<U+017F>ing to eat, that <U+017F>o he might by dying avoid the <U+017F>hame of being overcome, than for the <U+017F>ingle fight to which he had challeng'd him. Officers out-do common Souldiers, becau<U+017F>e they have more to lo<U+017F>e than they, and their Pu<U+017F>illanimity would be more taken notice of. And the Speeches of Generals in a day of battel are not for the truly courageous, who need them not, but for the Cowards, who are encourag'd again<U+017F>t the fear of Death, by fal<U+017F>e <U+017F>ugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tions of the Enemies paucity, and their own number. Whereas true Courage, as <hi>Socrates</hi> <U+017F>aith in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> is not in tho<U+017F>e that fear not, becau<U+017F>e they ignore the danger, but in tho<U+017F>e who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it great, yet judge their own <U+017F>trength greater and thereupon pre<U+017F>ume of <U+017F>urmounting it; which Re<U+017F>olution is never learnt by Books or Precepts, but is inherent in the Mind.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That he was of the Opinion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> in the <U+017F>ame <hi>Xenophon,</hi> namely, that as <U+017F>ome Bodies are more robu<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome Souls are better to undergo dangers. That never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s In<U+017F>truction <U+017F>erves greatly to perfect Nature: Whence certain Nations cannot <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the a<U+017F><U+017F>aults of others better train'd and accu<U+017F>tom'd to manage <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort of Arms. All the kinds whereof, both offen<U+017F>ive and defen<U+017F>ive, proceeding from
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:66371:115"/>
Humane Indu<U+017F>try, Nature alone mu<U+017F>t not arrogate the advantage we have over other Animals; who<U+017F>e Courage being by the help of Art <U+017F>urmounted by that of Man, as Art can do nothing without Nature; <U+017F>o the Courage which leads us to attaque and vanqui<U+017F>h them, mu<U+017F>t be a<U+017F>crib'd to Art, without which, Man dur<U+017F>t not attaque them.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, We mu<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h Courages according to the diver<U+017F>ities of Subjects whereon they are employ'd. The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Cla<U+017F>s is that of per<U+017F>ons, who freely offer them<U+017F>elves to certain death for their Religion, whether true or fal<U+017F>e. So did among<U+017F>t the <hi>Romans, Q. Curtius,</hi> who threw him<U+017F>elf into a Gulph to appea<U+017F>e the anger of the Gods; <hi>Metellus,</hi> who ran into the fire to fetch out the Statue of <hi>Minerva</hi>; and of Hereticks a great number, of whom Books are full. But this Martyrology <U+017F>hews us a greater number in the true Church; yet the Courage of <U+017F>o many Martyrs cannot be a<U+017F>crib'd to Nature alone, but to Per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion, and to Faith. Next comes the Courage of tho<U+017F>e great Heroes, and illu<U+017F>trious Men of Antiquity, as <hi>David</hi> and his nine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, the three <hi>Horatii</hi> and <hi>Curiatii, Cae<U+017F>ar, Cato,</hi> and many others, whom none can <U+017F>ay would have done tho<U+017F>e brave Actions, unle<U+017F>s they had been lead thereunto by a noble de<U+017F>ire of Glory, to which our Minds are carryed onely by Rea<U+017F>ons, Precepts, and Examples; and con<U+017F>equently, their Courage may be judg'd rather acquir'd than natural. La<U+017F>tly, Courage is found in all Callings and Employments. A Mini<U+017F>ter, or Coun<U+017F>ellor of State, a Divine, and a Judge, acquire the Title of Courageous, when they re<U+017F>olutely perform the Office where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are call'd. This is not taught any per<U+017F>on by Nature, and therefore I find more effects of acquir'd than of Natural Courage, which (be<U+017F>ides) how great <U+017F>oever, is perfected by Indu<U+017F>try.</p>

by imitation of voices or <U+017F>ounds which they hear, and giving names to things <U+017F>utable to the voices or <U+017F>ounds they render'd. In defect whereof they would frame other articulate words, fir<U+017F>t Mono<U+017F>yllables and Simple, as tho<U+017F>e of the Chine<U+017F>es are, and afterwards compounded: by which they would expre<U+017F>s all their other conceptions, if not with <U+017F>uch facility as other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which time hath enrich'd, yet at lea<U+017F>t after their own Mode, u<U+017F>ing the mo<U+017F>t conformity they could to the nature and property of each thing. And where rea<U+017F>on fail'd them, they would be help'd by hazard; our Nature being <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd to imitation, that he of the two, who fir<U+017F>t apply'd a word to <U+017F>ome thing, would be follow'd by the other without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. For the mind of Man being an Act, ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives; his greate<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ure is in communicating tho<U+017F>e concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and as a Torrent or River without <U+017F>hore, take their cour<U+017F>e every way, <U+017F>o Man's conception being de<U+017F>titute of terms to imitate, would frame new according to his phan<U+017F>ie, which coming to be receiv'd by others, would acquire the <U+017F>ame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection whereunto other Languages arrive in time. Yea when the Organs of Speech fail, dumb per<U+017F>ons move their members a thou<U+017F>and ways to make them<U+017F>elves under<U+017F>tood; and that <U+017F>o happily, that when Mon<U+017F>ieur de <hi>Sancy</hi> was Emba<U+017F><U+017F>adour in <hi>Turkie,</hi> he hapned to <U+017F>ee two Mutes, the one a Turk and the other a Per<U+017F>ian, who not under<U+017F>tanding one another becau<U+017F>e they had different <U+017F>igns, there was found a third Mute who <U+017F>erv'd them for an Interpreter. Which being harder then to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate a voice, argues, that Nature would much <U+017F>ooner teach Speech then expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion by ge<U+017F>tures. For no body is ignorant that it is ea<U+017F>ier to <U+017F>peak then to do.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Speech being only an imitation, he that <U+017F>hould never hear another <U+017F>peak could never <U+017F>peak him<U+017F>elf. Hence per<U+017F>ons born deaf are always dumb, though they have all the Organs fit for formation of Speech: and yet none will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they have not all the <U+017F>ame faculties and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities of expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves that other men have, yea and greater too, being depriv'd of all in<U+017F>tructions which are aquir'd by the ear, and other benefits proceeding from the <U+017F>ame. Which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther verifi'd by the examples of all <U+017F>avage Men that have been found; even by that of the Satyre, who by the report of S. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> in his Epi<U+017F>tles appear'd to S. <hi>Anthony</hi> in the De<U+017F>art; all which in<U+017F>tead of words pronounc'd only inarticulate voices, liker <U+017F>ounds and bellowings then words; the<U+017F>e men being like one ignorant of playing on the Lute, who though he hath fingers yet cannot make it <U+017F>peak as he can who is <U+017F>kill'd in that In<U+017F>trument.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Rea<U+017F>on why per<U+017F>ons born deaf are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o mute, is, that he who <U+017F>peaks mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t hear him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>peak before he be heard by others; otherwi<U+017F>e he knows not whether him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf hath <U+017F>poken or no, much le<U+017F>s can others know: and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66371:116"/>
doth he remember the voice which he made u<U+017F>e of to expre<U+017F>s this thing or another: which is ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to being able to employ the <U+017F>ame voice when he would <U+017F>ignifie the <U+017F>ame thing. But the ca<U+017F>e is not the <U+017F>ame with him that having a good ear and intending to cau<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf to be under<U+017F>tood endeavours to expre<U+017F>s his conceptions of things by his voice which he arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates by the judgment of his ear, as a Lutini<U+017F>t doth the <U+017F>trings of his In<U+017F>trument, which indeed is more artificially touch'd by a <U+017F>killful then by an ignorant per<U+017F>on, yet cea<U+017F>eth not to <U+017F>trike the Ear, as the Language invented by <U+017F>uch men without Precepts will not be le<U+017F>s audible though more di<U+017F>agreeable then another. Moreover, Speech being as proper to man as Rea<U+017F>on (whereof 'tis the Image, whence po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly the Greeks denote both by the <U+017F>ame word) it may <U+017F>eem, that one remote from all commerce would not cea<U+017F>e as to rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>o neither to <U+017F>peak; but might as well do the one as the other. If there be any ob<U+017F>tacle, it mu<U+017F>t proceed from <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>e: not from the material, to wit, the <U+017F>pecies of things, which it imports not whether they be introduc'd by one <U+017F>en<U+017F>e or another; Nor from the efficient, the Organs of Speech being <U+017F>uppos'd intire; nor from the Formal, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail, <U+017F>ince 'tis nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for Speech to follow as often as the breath is <U+017F>trongly driven out of the Lungs through the <U+017F>harp Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery into the Mouth, organiz'd by the Epiglottis, modifi'd by the Tongue, minc'd by the Teeth, and form'd by the Lips. As for the final, which is Communication, 'tis not le<U+017F>s beneficial to one then to another.

            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ince nothing can be in the Intellect which was not before in the Sen<U+017F>e, the Species of Voice cannot be introduced into the Under<U+017F>tanding but by <U+017F>ome outward <U+017F>en<U+017F>e: Not by the Hearing, which is the right <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of Di<U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, <U+017F>ince none <U+017F>peaks to the Children of whom the que<U+017F>tion is: Nor by the Eyes, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ole object is the vi<U+017F>ible Species: nor

by the other Sen<U+017F>es, who<U+017F>e objects are al<U+017F>o different from tho<U+017F>e of the Hearing. Moreover, a Language being comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Grammar, which is a Science, it cannot be under<U+017F>tood much le<U+017F>s practis'd without either Precepts or Examples. For want of which the memory of Children (of whom, we now <U+017F>peak) not being furni<U+017F>h'd with any Idea, can dictate nothing to the Mu<U+017F>cles and Nerves, the in<U+017F>truments of voluntary motion, which therefore can form no Speech; ju<U+017F>t as he that is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>tom'd to other exerci<U+017F>es of the body no more then to tho<U+017F>e of the mind, produces them not. That God created <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> with Speech, and that (as 'tis reported) <U+017F>ome Children have <U+017F>poken at their birth, yea <U+017F>ome in their Mothers bellies; the<U+017F>e are things purely <U+017F>upernatural, and from which nothing can be inferr'd.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That Women have <U+017F>uch a facility of <U+017F>peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if two Children e<U+017F>pecially of different <U+017F>exes were bred up together, 'tis likely the female would <U+017F>peak fir<U+017F>t, not only as the more forward but as the greater tatler. Which was the rea<U+017F>on of the mi<U+017F>carriage of the King of <hi>Egypts</hi> trial, which he made only with Boys.

And whether you place the benefit and end of this War in the conque<U+017F>t of the Enemies Country, or in a ju<U+017F>t defence only, 'tis always more commodious, profitable, and glorious to attaque him at home, then to expect him at your

own doors. For, if you de<U+017F>ign to conquer, you mu<U+017F>t ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>arily enter into his country to get po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion; if only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your <U+017F>elf, then (as wi<U+017F>e men chu<U+017F>e rather to divert and prevent di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es then to repel them already form'd, and as a Fire is more ea<U+017F>ily quencht in its fir<U+017F>t flame than when it hath <U+017F>eiz'd the roof and walls, <U+017F>o) 'tis ea<U+017F>ier to defend your own country by making a diver<U+017F>ion upon that of the enemy than to expel in your own all the de<U+017F>olations that attend war, which you mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>uffer at home unle<U+017F>s you remove it further. Be<U+017F>ides, in forreign Counties the war almo<U+017F>t pays its <U+017F>elf, the Soldier lives as he li<U+017F>t, enriches him<U+017F>elf with the pillage of taken Towns, and <U+017F>o is le<U+017F>s charge to his Prince. Yea, he becomes more valorous there too. For, as Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is redoubles the force of Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, <U+017F>o the approach of an enemie's country gives heart to the mo<U+017F>t cowardly, and renders others more di<U+017F>ciplinable, as well knowing that they mu<U+017F>t look for help only from them<U+017F>elves. Hence Armies have pro<U+017F>per'd better in a <U+017F>trange Country than in their own. The Romans were always victorious out of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but often beaten at home, and reduc'd to great extremities by the Gauls and Carthaginians; who likewi<U+017F>e were always overcome in their own Country. Hence <hi>Alexander</hi> conquer'd more Kingdoms and Provinces by carrying his Arms into <hi>A<U+017F>ia,</hi> then his Father and all his Lieutenants won Towns in <hi>Greece</hi>; the Engli<U+017F>h have been more fortunate in <hi>France</hi> then at home; and the Turks almo<U+017F>t ever gain upon the Chri<U+017F>tians by a<U+017F><U+017F>ault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chri<U+017F>tendom. Yea Reputation, by which Kings reign, and Terror which half gets a victory, are always on the Aggre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>or's <U+017F>ide, whereas on the contrary nothing abates the courage more then to <U+017F>uffer the invaders to come to our hou<U+017F>es, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the alacrity and promptitude of Soldiers is u<U+017F>ually great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t when acccompani'd with great hopes.</p>
            <p>The third <U+017F>aid, 'Tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to determine any thing in this or any other political Que<U+017F>tions, which are variable accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to diver<U+017F>ity of Circum<U+017F>tances; The frontier of one State may be <U+017F>o <U+017F>afe that there is nothing to be fear'd at home from the enemy, again<U+017F>t whom therefore all the <U+017F>editious and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent per<U+017F>ons may be <U+017F>afely <U+017F>ent: Forreign War <U+017F>erving as a Sanctuary to bad Citizens, who fear the puni<U+017F>hment of their crimes; in which re<U+017F>pect it <U+017F>erves for a purgation and bleeding to the body Politick.

Tho<U+017F>e that have pro<U+017F>per'd in conquering would po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly have got more if they had put them<U+017F>elves only upon the Defen<U+017F>ive; and tho<U+017F>e that have been wor<U+017F>ted in defending their own, perhaps did it too late, and (as it mo<U+017F>t frequently happens) when their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were impair'd.

            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, 'Tis true, Nothing is in the Intellect but what was before in the Sen<U+017F>es, yet many times the Intellect is <U+017F>o prepo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd with prejudice that all <U+017F>upervening rea<U+017F>ons <U+017F>ignifie nothing; and when <U+017F>ome Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as Love or Hatred, bia<U+017F><U+017F>eth it, there is no room for equal con<U+017F>ideration.

The fir<U+017F>t whereof, wherein we find our <U+017F>elves intere<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and which we promote upon that account, 'tis probable follow the temper and conformation of the Organs. Thus the melancholy man, who fears even imaginary dangers, cannot be per<U+017F>waded to prefer trading at <U+017F>ea before that at land, but is alwavs fixt to hazard nothing. If he mu<U+017F>t choo<U+017F>e a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he takes the Gown before the Sword, and then too he had rather be <U+017F>ilent then advance any new propo<U+017F>ition lyable to rejection. But if his birth or fortune command him to the war; he is rather for corrupting the enemies forces then fighting them, and in ca<U+017F>e of the latter he choo<U+017F>es an ambu<U+017F>cade before a pitcht battel. On the contrary, the hot cholerick per<U+017F>on preferrs a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:66371:119"/>
cour<U+017F>e, whereby he may <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t compa<U+017F>s his de<U+017F>ign, though with the hazard of his Life, (which he will not believe, or at lea<U+017F>t not fear) before the tedious progre<U+017F><U+017F>es of other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which afford not their pro<U+017F>ecutor meat till his teeth be out. And the Sanguine ea<U+017F>ily agrees to this Advice, provided it requires no pains, or be <U+017F>weetned with <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F>time; but the Phlegmatick cares neither for one nor the other. On the other <U+017F>ide, in things con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting onely in Contemplation, I <U+017F>ee not why I <U+017F>hould be rather of the Opinion, that the flux and reflux of the Sea is caus'd by the Moon than by the Sun. And hence it is that per<U+017F>ons of different Tempers, Sexes, Climats, and Ages, agree more readily in a point of Philo<U+017F>ophy, than in their particular Inclinations and kind of Life. Indeed the main Source of this Diver<U+017F>ity of Opinion, is, the Vanity and Ambition of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Mind, which judging it <U+017F>elf as well <U+017F>tock'd with Capacity and <U+017F>ufficiency as any other, and above all things, loving Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which <U+017F>eems di<U+017F>parag'd by con<U+017F>enting to an Opinion advanc'd by another; this Conceit, together with the dubiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of all things not demon<U+017F>trable, carries us to <U+017F>eek <U+017F>ome new Light, which cannot be <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall, but we love it more than that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as people commonly do their own Children. Hence ari<U+017F>e the <U+017F>o different Opinions of the Ancients, about all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Philo<U+017F>ophy and other Sciences, not excepting Divinity it <U+017F>elf even among<U+017F>t Catholicks; among<U+017F>t whom we <U+017F>ee <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> di<U+017F>agreeing with Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> as <hi>Paracel<U+017F>us</hi> doth in Phy<U+017F>ick with <hi>Galen, Copernicus</hi> with <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in Mathematicks, <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Lully</hi> and <hi>Ramus</hi> in Schola<U+017F>tick Philo<U+017F>ophy with <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> and in Civil Law <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ius,</hi> with <hi>Labeo,</hi> and the Sabinians with the Proculeians.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, 'Twere a greater wonder if all Men were of one Opinion, than that they imitate in this diver<U+017F>ity all other things of the world: At lea<U+017F>t 'tis harder to a<U+017F><U+017F>ign the cau<U+017F>e why one and the <U+017F>ame Man is to day of one judgement, and to morrow of another, then to <U+017F>ee as many <U+017F>everal Sentences as Heads. But to me this variety <U+017F>eems to ari<U+017F>e from the various conception of things. As appears by the example of <hi>Julius Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> who being purpos'd to de<U+017F>troy King <hi>Deiotarus,</hi> no <U+017F>ooner heard <hi>Cicero</hi> <U+017F>peak in his defence but he pardon'd him; not to <U+017F>peak of many other Effects, both of his and <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi>'s Eloquence. Whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that though the <U+017F>ame Fact be related with the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>ons, yet the Diver<U+017F>ities found in the manner, and in all the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, imprint in us different <U+017F>pecies; upon the report whereof we al<U+017F>o make a different judgement.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <U+017F>aid, This Variety proceeds from the Principles of Knowledge, as appears in tho<U+017F>e of Mathematicks., which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain and known to all, cau<U+017F>e every one to a<U+017F><U+017F>ent to their infallible Con<U+017F>equences.

            <head>CONFERENCE CLIX. Why there is more Wind at Sea than at Land.</head>
            <p>THe experience of le<U+017F>s Wind and more Rain on Land than at Sea, makes their Opinion que<U+017F>tionable, who hold, Exhalations to be the matter of the former, and Vapours of the latter: unle<U+017F>s we will <U+017F>ay, that Winds, to whom the Poets rightly attribute the Empire of the Sea, drive the Clouds over the Land, where being le<U+017F>s agitated, they re<U+017F>olve into Rain. But to continue my rea<U+017F>oning with the <U+017F>ame Poets, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay, that having plac'd <hi>Aeolus</hi>'s Palace in the caverns near the <U+017F>ea, they have <U+017F>ufficiently proved, why the Sea is more troubled with them than the Land. For the<U+017F>e Winds vi<U+017F>ibly i<U+017F><U+017F>ue from deep Caverns fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent on the Coa<U+017F>ts of the Sea, who<U+017F>e continually agitated waves ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly <U+017F>tir them up. 'Tis no wonder then if they di<U+017F>play their violences on that <U+017F>ide which is free<U+017F>t to them: Which is experienc'd in great Lakes adjacent to high Mountains; as in that of <hi>Comum,</hi> and <hi>de la Garde</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> who<U+017F>e waves and roarings re<U+017F>emble tho<U+017F>e of the Sea; and al<U+017F>o in that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which is troubled extraordinarily. Not but that Winds are generated in other Subterraneous places too, none of which is exempt from them; as appears in Wells and the mouths of Caves. But the openings of <U+017F>uch places being commonly <U+017F>trait upwards, the Wind that come out of them is not <U+017F>o perceptible as that which i<U+017F><U+017F>ues out laterally from high Caverns upon the Sea-<U+017F>hore; and they differ, in that the Sea Wind is dryer and le<U+017F>s corrupting, po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>altne<U+017F>s of the water, upon which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid. That the difference in Que<U+017F>tion proceeds from the va<U+017F>t extent of the Sea, which gives the Air once agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, more liberty to continue its motion; which, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is <U+017F>traitned and repre<U+017F>s'd on Land by the occur<U+017F>e of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Trees, Hou<U+017F>es, and other ob<U+017F>tacles: By the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on that the waves of a Pool or little Lake, are much le<U+017F>s than tho<U+017F>e of the Ocean, be<U+017F>ides, that one and the <U+017F>ame Wind hath much greater effect in a <U+017F>mooth and liquid plain, which yields to it, than upon a rough <U+017F>olid Body, upon which burdens are not mov'd but with more force than there needs upon the water; as they experience who endeavour to draw a <U+017F>tranded Ship on the Land, which they <U+017F>aw move almo<U+017F>t of it <U+017F>elf whil<U+017F>t it was upon the water. The Mechanical Rea<U+017F>on whereof is, that the water breaking into infinite points, <U+017F>carce makes any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to its Agent; but the Earth pre<U+017F>s'd with the <U+017F>ame load, re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts it in infinite points.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:66371:120"/>The Third <U+017F>aid. He that defin'd Wind to be Agitated Air, rather <U+017F>poke its Effect than Cau<U+017F>e, which is <U+017F>ome middle thing between a Vapor and an Exhalation, driven violently according to all the differences of place. For an Exhalation, which always mounts upwards, and the Vapor which refrigerated de<U+017F>cends downwards, cannot <U+017F>eparately be the matter of Wind. Hence as <U+017F>oon as the Vapor of a Cloud is re<U+017F>olv'd into Rain, the Wind cea<U+017F>eth; the Exhalations not being <U+017F>ufficient to produce it alone, as neither the Vapor is. Otherwi<U+017F>e, Winds <U+017F>hould be greate<U+017F>t in hot weather, when Exhalations are mo<U+017F>t plentiful. Wherefore the Sea having in its Four Qualities the materials of the<U+017F>e two Meteors, and being otherwi<U+017F>e more capable of emitting them through its liquid <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, than the Earth is through its hard and <U+017F>olid <U+017F>urface, though both be equally heated as well by the Sun, as by Subterraneous Fires, Evaporations and Exhalations, are <U+017F>ooner and oftner made at Sea than at Land.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the thicke<U+017F>t Air being oftimes the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t, and the cleare<U+017F>t the mo<U+017F>t windy, 'tis doubtful whether Vapors and Exhalations produce Winds; which, be<U+017F>ides, pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>eth actual heat in the Sea, which yet is never felt there, but onely on Land. It <U+017F>eems therefore that the Element of Air being very <U+017F>ymbolical to that of the Air by their agreement and moi<U+017F>ture, they follow the motions one of the other. Hence the Air conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the Sea, is agitated by it; whence ari<U+017F>eth a Wind, which again agitates the Sea; it being well known, that when there are no Waves there is no Wind. On the contrary, when the Wind is to change, the billows turn fir<U+017F>t. And ordinarily, the Winds change with the Tides.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid. There are two <U+017F>orts of Winds upon the Sea; Particular, which reign in our Seas, blowing indifferently from all Coa<U+017F>ts; and General, which blow continually from the <U+017F>ame quarter, without giving place to their Contraries. Such is the Oriental Wind in the Torrid Zone, which was call'd by the Latins, <hi>Sub<U+017F>olanus,</hi> and by Mariners at this day, South-Ea<U+017F>t. For it conducts Ships <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tantly over the whole extent of <hi>Mer du Nord, &amp; du Sud,</hi> that without di<U+017F>continuing Day or Night, it exempts the Sea-men from touching their <U+017F>ails, e<U+017F>pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they are near the Aequinoctial. Indeed in the <hi>Ea<U+017F>t Indies,</hi> this Rule alters, for this Wind holds there but <U+017F>ix moneths, leaving the other <U+017F>ix free to its Antagoni<U+017F>t. The Cau<U+017F>e whereof, is a<U+017F>crib'd to the repercu<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the capes and coa<U+017F>ts of tho<U+017F>e Seas, as that fir<U+017F>t Wind is to the motion of the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> which, together with the inferior Spheres, draws the Air along with it in this place, where the circumference of its motion is large<U+017F>t. There is another general Wind, which blows between the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, or twenty fourth Degree on this <U+017F>ide the Line, and the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifth becoming Occidental with the like con<U+017F>tancy that the above<U+017F>aid Oriental doth. This <U+017F>ome attribute to a contrary motion, which all things have when tho<U+017F>e neare<U+017F>t them are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:66371:120"/>
violently; as the <U+017F>tream of water running impetuou<U+017F>ly in the mid<U+017F>t, makes that near the <U+017F>hores recoil backwards.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That as Vapours make Mi<U+017F>ts and Fogs, and Sulphureous Exhalations make igneous Meteors; <U+017F>o the Nitrous make Wind, which keeps the air from corruption as the Earth is kept from it by Nitre, and the Sea by Salt. Moreover, both the Wind and Nitre dry, and are the cau<U+017F>es of fecundity; as is prov'd (on the behalf of Nitre) by the Nitrous <U+017F>and of <hi>Nilus,</hi> who<U+017F>e greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er overflow promi<U+017F>es to the Egyptians a year proportionably fruitful; which is al<U+017F>o <U+017F>aid of the <hi>Rho<U+017F>ne</hi> abounding with Nitre. And as for the Wind, be<U+017F>ides that all flatuous Meats provoke lu<U+017F>t, 'tis <U+017F>aid that the Mares of <hi>Andalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ia</hi> conceive by the We<U+017F>t-wind alone which al<U+017F>o is <U+017F>tyl'd the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Flowers. In Brief, if Wind be impetuous, the effects of Nitre in Gun-powder and Aurum fulminans, manife<U+017F>t that Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre is no le<U+017F>s. Now Nitre being mix'd with the Air, where it is volatile; with the Earth, where it is fix'd; and with the Sea, where it is barely di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd; no wonder if it exhale more ea<U+017F>ily from the Sea then from the Land, and con<U+017F>equently if more winds be there. Whence the rea<U+017F>on may be drawn not only of the Sea-winds but al<U+017F>o of the tempe<U+017F>ts and commotions of that va<U+017F>t Element; a Tempe<U+017F>t being nothing but the rarefaction of the Sea; Nitre, and the inflation of the Waters at Full Moon in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> only the fermentation of the <U+017F>ame Nitre in the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on proper for generation. As for that inflation hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the time of the Dog-<U+017F>tar, when the Ete<U+017F>ian winds reign, it proceeds from the heat of the Air then inflam'd by the rays of the Sun, like the ebullition of Honey and Syrups impregnated with much Salt, as appears by their di<U+017F><U+017F>olution and the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s they acquire over the Fire.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <U+017F>aid, That the coldne<U+017F>s of Vapors ari<U+017F>ing from waters giving more body and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence to winds, makes them <U+017F>trike a more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible blow then when they are de<U+017F>titute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; whence they are greater in Winter then in Summer, and in the Morning then at Noon. Thus the <U+017F>ame quantity of water will cau<U+017F>e more alteration in the body being drunk cold then warm, becau<U+017F>e the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the latter is much le<U+017F>s upon our bodies. And the Providence of the Author of Winds is remarkable too, in that they are mi<U+017F>chievous at Land but u<U+017F>eful at Sea; hurtful things being by a <U+017F>ecret of his power as much dimini<U+017F>h'd, as profitable are augmented.</p>
            <p>The Eighth <U+017F>aid, That not only Wind-mills but al<U+017F>o the Wind-wagons invented lately in <hi>Holland,</hi> <U+017F>hew that wind well manag'd is no le<U+017F>s profitable at Land then at Sea. Therefore I <U+017F>hould refer the cau<U+017F>e to the poro<U+017F>ities, overtures, and caverns of the Earth, into which the wind entring is by that means le<U+017F>s at Land; whereas the <U+017F>urface of the Sea giving it no <U+017F>uch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, 'tis left to its freer cour<U+017F>e upon the <U+017F>ame; whence when tho<U+017F>e pores of the Earth are <U+017F>hut up by fro<U+017F>t, the wind
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:66371:121"/>
becomes more impetuous then it is in Summer when they are open.</p>

            <p>THe mo<U+017F>t plau<U+017F>ible vertues are not always the noble<U+017F>t: as they depend upon external things which encrea<U+017F>e or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<U+017F>h their value, <U+017F>o oftentimes they yield to tho<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>cure and private vertues, who<U+017F>e beauty being only internal, without borrowing any recommendation from abroad, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more to be e<U+017F>teem'd. Gentlene<U+017F>s or Man<U+017F>uetude is of this nature, though it make not <U+017F>o great a noi<U+017F>e as Fortitude, which is irre<U+017F>i<U+017F>tible by the terror it impre<U+017F><U+017F>es upon the oppo<U+017F>ers of its de<U+017F>igns, yet oft-times it accompli<U+017F>hes its enterpri<U+017F>es with the more facility in that it makes not u<U+017F>e of any extraneous help, but only of what this vertue it <U+017F>elf affords; which in<U+017F>inuating <U+017F>weetly into their minds whom it would lead by the con<U+017F>iderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own good, more ea<U+017F>ily procures obedience then fear doth; which indeed may con<U+017F>train them to do what they would not voluntarily a<U+017F><U+017F>ent to, but is a violent motion, and <U+017F>o harder to be impre<U+017F>s'd then that which is voluntary. For when once the rea<U+017F>on is per<U+017F>waded of the ju<U+017F>tice of the things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, there is no more ob<U+017F>tacle in the Will, which then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns it <U+017F>elf to be lead by that light of the Under<U+017F>tanding; much le<U+017F>s in the inferior Powers, which move only by the orders of tho<U+017F>e upon which they totally depend.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Did men leave them<U+017F>elves to the guidance of Rea<U+017F>on more then of their Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, it would be ea<U+017F>ier to procure obedience by Gentlene<U+017F>s then by Terror, which then would be u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s; <U+017F>eeing 'tis not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to oblige <U+017F>uch men by denunciation of penalties to their duty, who addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves to it voluntarily upon the knowledg they have of right Rea<U+017F>on. But <U+017F>ince very few follow this Rule, in compari<U+017F>on of tho<U+017F>e that have none but that of their di<U+017F>orderly Appetites, therefore <U+017F>everity is more expedient then mildne<U+017F>s for reducing them at any rate whatever to their duty. For their obedience though con<U+017F>train'd is neverthele<U+017F>s exemplary, and draws others to do the like, and <U+017F>o maintains that mutual corre<U+017F>pondence which gives <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence not only to States but al<U+017F>o to all other civil Societies, and which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts chiefly in a certain depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance between the parties de<U+017F>tinated to obey and to command. So that as the latter ought to <U+017F>tudy to maintain the Authority and Superiority which they have, whether by Nature (as Fathers

Indeed <U+017F>ome Legi<U+017F>lators have ab<U+017F>olutely forbidden Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, as <hi>Lycurgus</hi>; others have only permitted it to the inferior people, as <hi>Romulus,</hi> which induc'd <hi>Plato</hi> to found his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth far from the Sea-ports, for fear it <U+017F>hould be corrupted by the delights ordinarily introduc'd by <U+017F>trangers, and his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens getting their livelihood by Merchandize <U+017F>hould learn to lye and deceive, the common vices of Merchants, which <hi>Cicero</hi> <U+017F>aith likewi<U+017F>e of the Carthaginians, that being good of their own nature, they learn'd by the conver<U+017F>e of Merchants to addict them<U+017F>elves to frauds and lyes, out of their great de<U+017F>ire of getting. But as Trading begets di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, <U+017F>o it makes men more prudent by the knowledge of <U+017F>everal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons manners. Whence <hi>Homer</hi> in the beginning of his <hi>Ody<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eus</hi> makes this remark of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ly<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi> that he had <U+017F>een many Cities, which is proper to Merchants: but every body knows that one may lye, di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, and deceive without being a Merchant, nor ought the abu<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome hinder all from the u<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the rea<U+017F>on why Trading is interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Gentry, is, le<U+017F>t the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of gain <U+017F>hould retard them from the Wars for the <U+017F>ervice of the King and defence of the State, whereof they are the <U+017F>upport and the right hand. And Gentlemen having no other exerci<U+017F>e but Arms mu<U+017F>t needs be better <U+017F>kill'd therein then if their Minds and Bodies were <U+017F>har'd among<U+017F>t <U+017F>everal Occupations, and upon occa<U+017F>ion they are more ready and free from other employment to execute the orders they receive, then if they were in <U+017F>ome long Voyage, or bu<U+017F>ied about examining an Account-Book; an errour wherein, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times imports their whole e<U+017F>tate. Be<U+017F>ides, Souldiers more cheerfully obey him who they <U+017F>ee leads a life far from all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. This was the practi<U+017F>e of the Romans, among whom 'twas not lawful for a Citizen to exerci<U+017F>e Merchandize; but only for freed Servants, or others of the low vulgar. Much more was it forbidden to the Senators, who for that rea<U+017F>on had the Port of their Ship limited, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould Trafick under pretext of tran<U+017F>porting their Fruits and Rents; all profit <U+017F>eeming to them di<U+017F>hone<U+017F>t. And the Thebans admitted no man to any Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tracy, unle<U+017F>s he had di<U+017F>continu'd Trading at lea<U+017F>t ten years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66371:122"/>
The rea<U+017F>on is given by <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi>; becau<U+017F>e Merchandize is an enemy to Vertue. Hence all acce<U+017F>s to Honours hath been by the Laws interdicted to Merchants, or <U+017F>o much as to bear Arms; <U+017F>o that Gentility and Merchandize <U+017F>eem incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent. Add hereunto, that God forbids his people to have any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant among<U+017F>t them; becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aith the Wi<U+017F>e man, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant can hardly have his hands clean from <U+017F>in: And <U+017F>o <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o<U+017F>tome</hi> adventures to <U+017F>ay, that a Merchant cannot plea<U+017F>e God, by rea<U+017F>on of his perjuries and frauds; qualities directly contrary to true Gentility.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>eeing this life needs Action more then Contemplation; therefore good Polititians invite, by all <U+017F>orts of Honors and Priviledges, tho<U+017F>e that are able to contribute mo<U+017F>t to the benefit, quiet, and increa<U+017F>e of the State. But, <U+017F>o are Merchants; who bring plenty of all kinds of Goods to the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>olate places, and enrich the more fruitful by di<U+017F>tributing their commodities, which otherwi<U+017F>e would be poor amid<U+017F>t their abundance. Nor are they oblig'd to Trade in Per<U+017F>on, <U+017F>o that they are not hindred from paying the per<U+017F>onal Service they owe to their King and Countrey; for who<U+017F>e good they are oft-times be<U+017F>t advertis'd by their Forreign Corre<U+017F>pondences, and give the certaine<U+017F>t Intelligence of an Enemies De<U+017F>igns: be<U+017F>ides that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving travell'd into his Countrey in time of Peace, they the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know what way to mannage a War again<U+017F>t him; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney wherewith they abound more then Gentlemen, gives them large Credit among<U+017F>t the Souldiers. The Roman Law that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad Senators to Traffick, was extinct in the dayes of <hi>Horten<U+017F>ius,</hi> as he complains: whereby it appears to have been lawful not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them, but al<U+017F>o for the <hi>Equites,</hi> or Knights to negotiate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by them<U+017F>elves or by others; as at this day the Nobles of <hi>Spain, England, Venice,</hi> and e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Florence</hi> do. Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> <U+017F>peaks of <hi>Lucius Pretius</hi> an illu<U+017F>trious Roman Knight that Traffickt at <hi>Panormus,</hi> and of Q. <hi>Mutius</hi> of the <U+017F>ame quality at <hi>Syracu<U+017F>e.</hi> That God forbad his people Traffick, 'twas probably to keep them from being corrupted by the Idolatry of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and 'tis no more to be drawn into con<U+017F>equence for us then ab<U+017F>tinence from Swines Fle<U+017F>h and their other Ceremonies: But <U+017F>hould all that hath been <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t Merchants be admitted for good, it mu<U+017F>t be onely again<U+017F>t Merchants by Retail, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e that Trade in Gro<U+017F>s, who have alwayes been except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the rank of others.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That Utility is not more incompatible with Hone<U+017F>ty then Trade is with Nobility, which neverthele<U+017F>s is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, according to the <U+017F>everal <U+017F>entiments of Nations, being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by extraction among<U+017F>t Chri<U+017F>tians by warlike exerci<U+017F>es a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t the Turks, by learning among<U+017F>t the Chine<U+017F>es; as al<U+017F>o the Nobles live in the Countrey in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> but in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>; from which circum<U+017F>tances Nobility receives <U+017F>everal E<U+017F>timations, according to the <U+017F>everal opinions of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66371:123"/>
But in general, Commerce, as 'tis the exerci<U+017F>e of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <U+017F>o it hath been more honor'd in popular States then in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, where the power of Sovereigns <U+017F>hines brighte<U+017F>t in War (which is oppo<U+017F>ite to Merchandize) and the fear of Monopolies (which would ea<U+017F>ily prevail here) renders odious the trading of Grandees, who incurre the peoples envy as <U+017F>oon as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the employments belonging to them. Moreover, the gain of Merchants is contrary to the liberality of a Gentleman, who<U+017F>e donations are interpreted in Law more exten<U+017F>ively, when there is que<U+017F>tion about them, then tho<U+017F>e of Yeomen. And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <U+017F>o gentle towards other <U+017F>inners, whipt the Trade<U+017F>men out of the Temple, calling them Robbers, and their Shops Dens of Thieves. As accordingly, Pagan Antiquity a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd them for their Patron <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Patron of Thieves, and the mo<U+017F>t infamous of the Gods. And the Emperours forbad Merchandize, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Senators by the <hi>Lex Clodia,</hi> but al<U+017F>o to Nobles by extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>L. Nobiliores. C. De Comerciis &amp; Mercat.</hi> to Officers <hi>Leg. Ne quis C. de dignit.</hi> and even to Souldiers, <hi>L. Milites C. Loca, &amp; L. eos C. ne milites negotientur.</hi> And if <U+017F>ome Nations, confounding Utility with Hone<U+017F>ty, have authorized the Trading of Nobles, 'tis but as ba<U+017F>e Money is, upon <U+017F>ome nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, allow'd current in one Countrey, and rejected in all others. And their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors agree, that the Splendor of <U+017F>uch Nobility is much dimini<U+017F>ht by negotiation; the di<U+017F>tinction of Gro<U+017F>s and Retail, not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Species of the Que<U+017F>tion, any more then more and le<U+017F>s do in all others. Nor is it material whether they negotiate by the intervention of others, <U+017F>ince 'tis not lawful to do by another what we may not do our <U+017F>elves; be<U+017F>ides, that <U+017F>uch intervention draws in the Honor of a Gentleman to vouch anothers Fact. La<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the poverty intended to be avoided thereby, is oftentimes met with in<U+017F>tead of Riches; and were it otherwi<U+017F>e, yet Poverty commonly <U+017F>erves for a <U+017F>pur to Virtue. Hence ordinarily Cadets are more courageous then Elder Brothers; and the poor <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> and <hi>Phocion</hi> were the more Warlike; but <hi>Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us</hi> the Rich was overcome and <U+017F>lain by the Parthians.</p>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:66371:123"/>
hence it comes to pa<U+017F>s that the French are more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the Lye than they.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, That all Mankind make e<U+017F>teem of Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Courage towards men: the former having been a means us'd by the greate<U+017F>t Princes and Legi<U+017F>lators to gain the minds of their people; <U+017F>o powerful, that <U+017F>ome even with the apparence of it alone have produced <U+017F>trange effects, (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s the dotages of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the Ea<U+017F>t, and many others el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.) The other, namely Courage, being the vertue mo<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd among<U+017F>t men, and e<U+017F>teem'd by women, who commonly favour the mo<U+017F>t valiant. Now Lying is a Vice oppo<U+017F>ite to both the<U+017F>e Vertues, implying Impiety towards God, and Cowardize towards men. For he that lyes cannot be ignorant, that God the Father of Truth knows, and will <U+017F>ooner or later puni<U+017F>h his Crime, if he have power to do it, (as cannot be denied without manife<U+017F>t irreligion.) And <U+017F>ince Truth comes of it <U+017F>elf to the Tongues end, unle<U+017F>s it be detained Captive by Fear, or <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>ervile con<U+017F>ideration; hence a Lye pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and Fear of him before whom it is <U+017F>poken. So that it is no wonder if the reproach of the<U+017F>e two crimes trouble us <U+017F>o much, the French Nation being the mo<U+017F>t glorious of the World.</p>
            <p>The third <U+017F>aid, That the Lye cannot but have <U+017F>omething in it more hainous then the reproach of Coward and Impious, <U+017F>ince the<U+017F>e are repayed only with the Lye, but the Lye it <U+017F>elf with blows; probably becau<U+017F>e Lying is a <U+017F>ervile Vice, and the French are very jealous of pre<U+017F>erving their Liberty. But we mu<U+017F>t di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h between lying and telling a Lye; for in this latter ca<U+017F>e people are not readily offended, as in the former. Thus an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate pleading upon a Breviate, the matter whereof is fictitious, takes it not for an injury if the Adver<U+017F>aries Advocate is fal<U+017F>e; but replies only, that he will ju<U+017F>tifie it. The Philo<U+017F>opher main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an erronious opinion, which he believes good, will not be angry at its being impugned of fal<U+017F>hood. But when one is <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed in a Lye, which <U+017F>eems invented purpo<U+017F>ely to impo<U+017F>e up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Company, the di<U+017F>coverer of the fal<U+017F>hood <U+017F>eems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him not only of knavery but al<U+017F>o of <U+017F>otti<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s, in that he could not utter it dexterou<U+017F>ly enough to make it believ'd. As therefore Theft was not puni<U+017F>hed, but e<U+017F>teemed among the Lacedemonians, when it was well concealed, and received not cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ement except the Thief were taken in the fact; <U+017F>o a Lye <U+017F>eems to offend only when it is di<U+017F>covered; but if hand<U+017F>omly told, in<U+017F>tead of being blamed, is authorized by Rhetorick and Poetry, (which are arts of hand<U+017F>omly feigning things that are not) by Complements, which are fair Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ements; by di<U+017F><U+017F>imu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, common enough everywhere; by <U+017F>tratagems of War. Hence when we give the Lye to any one, we add, <U+017F>aving the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect of the Company; intimating thereby, that we intend not to reproach them of little judgment in letting pa<U+017F>s <U+017F>o gro<U+017F>s a

fal<U+017F>hood for a truth. For I <U+017F>ee not that the French are greater Lyars then other Nations, unle<U+017F>s you will bring under Lying their re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F>s and mode<U+017F>ty in not telling their de<U+017F>igns to all the world.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the French being the mo<U+017F>t civilized of the world, have rea<U+017F>on to take for the greate<U+017F>t affront the Vice which mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>troyes civil Life and Conver<U+017F>ation; which being founded upon Communication, whereof Speech is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter: if there be no a<U+017F><U+017F>urance in this, then Humane Society is de<U+017F>troyed. All other things are known for what they are by the <U+017F>pecies which they <U+017F>end to our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es (as the <U+017F>pecies of a Dog and a Hor<U+017F>e never fail to repre<U+017F>ent them to us <U+017F>uch as they are) our intentions and thoughts alone are committed to <U+017F>peech; which, if it ill repre<U+017F>ent them, is no more to be e<U+017F>teem'd then a fal<U+017F>e Looking-gla<U+017F>s which repre<U+017F>ents objects quite other then what they are; or then a copy not at all re<U+017F>embling its original; or la<U+017F>tly, then a thing which is nothing le<U+017F>s then what it is taken to be. Hence a Lyar <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf di<U+017F>-believed, and every one upon their guard when he <U+017F>peaks or negotiates; he hath rea<U+017F>on to be <U+017F>harply offended with him that gives him <U+017F>uch a repute: and becau<U+017F>e being accounted a Lyar, he that accu<U+017F>es him would not believe his bare affirming the contrary; therefore he gives him a box on the ear, as the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uitable reply that can be made to the Lye; which being the highe<U+017F>t affront, the blow is the fir<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of it, which the uncover'd parts of the body (namely the hand and face) pre<U+017F>ent to the offended per<U+017F>on; which blow is e<U+017F>teem'd the greater out-rage, in that it te<U+017F>tifies the highe<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the receiver, and is onely meant to provoke him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entment: Therefore a thru<U+017F>t with a Sword at an enemy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely to deliver ones <U+017F>elf from the fear of him by killing him, is accounted much le<U+017F>s injurious then an affront done purpo<U+017F>ely for the affronts <U+017F>ake. But, be<U+017F>ides the foregoing rea<U+017F>ons, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tome (which oftentimes hath none) in <hi>France</hi> authorizes the greatne<U+017F>s of the injury of the Lye.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the refiners of Honor are like tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>harpen the points of Needles <U+017F>o much till they break. The French, in<U+017F>tead of intere<U+017F><U+017F>ing their Honour (as mo<U+017F>t other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do) onely in things of importance, and of fairly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they <U+017F>peak true when they are told that they Lye, are as much incens'd upon the <U+017F>ole pronunciation of the<U+017F>e words, as if they were <U+017F>o many magical terms forcing the hand to give a blow, or draw the <U+017F>word; and, which is <U+017F>trange, 'tis not enquir'd whether the thing be true or fal<U+017F>e, the Lye being judg'd alike offen<U+017F>ive in both: yea, ordinarily they are the greate<U+017F>t Lyars that are mo<U+017F>t offended with the Lye: the rea<U+017F>on whereof may be, That the reproach of true Vices offends us more then that of fal<U+017F>e and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>itious, and tho<U+017F>e of the minde more then tho<U+017F>e of the body, as being more reprehen<U+017F>ible in us, in that 'tis our own fault that they are not amended: for a reproach made to one
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66371:124"/>
for a Vice he cannot remedy, <U+017F>erves more to <U+017F>hew the malice of the Reproacher than the fault of him that is blam'd But 'tis not <U+017F>o with a Lye, which pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es either ignorance or malice. Whence the terms of Sot and Ignorant are al<U+017F>o mo<U+017F>t cutting even to tho<U+017F>e that are not <U+017F>o. Be<U+017F>ides, a Lyar (unle<U+017F>s he repel the injury; a vowing him<U+017F>elf the Di<U+017F>ciple of the Father of Lyes, this Reproach is very odious to good men, e<U+017F>pecially to the French, who <U+017F>o affect that Title from all Antiquity, that our Ance<U+017F>tors have transferr'd it to Valour, (which they e<U+017F>teem'd the chief of the Vertues) <U+017F>aying, that <U+017F>uch as have defended them<U+017F>elves well, have done <hi>en gens de bien,</hi> like good men.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That the Lye is offen<U+017F>ive only upon account of the intention; <U+017F>ince mo<U+017F>t of our Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, An<U+017F>wers, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies (wherein con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts one of the greate<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ures of life, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which our Conver<U+017F>e would have no agreeablene<U+017F>s, as appears by tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>peak not to one another, or agree in every thing) are no other but fair givings of the Lye; yet are <U+017F>o far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offen<U+017F>ive, that they cau<U+017F>e us to de<U+017F>ire the company of <U+017F>uch as know how to make hand<U+017F>om Reparties. Thus many of our Generals, who<U+017F>e venturou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s upon the greate<U+017F>t hazards <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently te<U+017F>tifies their de<U+017F>ire of Prai<U+017F>e, yet <U+017F>hew di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure at the hearing of their own Commendations; a Di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, which carries them <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o far, that when any Hi<U+017F>tory of the<U+017F>e times publi<U+017F>hes <U+017F>ome brave Action perform'd by them, they <U+017F>cruple not to blame the Hi<U+017F>torian, who by concealing the like another time, may <U+017F>ecure him<U+017F>elf from <U+017F>uch Complements, if he take them not in the right <U+017F>en<U+017F>e.</p>

               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:66371:125"/>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, 'Tis not univer<U+017F>ally true that every one is contented with his own wit; for there are many no le<U+017F>s diffident then others are confident of them<U+017F>elves. Hence <U+017F>ome eloquent Tongues, fit either for the Chair, or the Bar, are kept from both by timidity and di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t of their own abilities, and (as <U+017F>ome great animals <U+017F>uffer them<U+017F>elves to be lead and govern'd by a Childe) <U+017F>o their good wits, not under<U+017F>tanding their own <U+017F>trength, permit them<U+017F>elves to be rul'd by tho<U+017F>e that have wor<U+017F>e. Thus we <U+017F>ee there are Apprentices in all Trades and Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions more knowing then their Ma<U+017F>ters; and many times in that of War, a brave experienc'd Souldier obeyes a cowardly and ignorant Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain: And in Religious Hou<U+017F>es, <U+017F>ome excellent Spirits glorying not to repute them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>uch, <U+017F>uffer them<U+017F>elves to be guided and ruled by tho<U+017F>e of an inferiour Degree.

Of which number are many, who making a review of their precedent actions, alwayes finde <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein to di<U+017F>like. But as for others who have a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own wit then that of others, this defect <U+017F>eems to proceed from the want of knowledge of them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>o much recommended by the Delphian Oracle; <U+017F>uch people re<U+017F>embling the old Hag who put her eyes up in a Box when <U+017F>he came home, and took them out onely when <U+017F>he went abroad; or tho<U+017F>e that have a Wallet upon their necks, whereof they never <U+017F>ee but the forepart into which they put the affairs of their Neighbours; the other being behinde, into which they put all that concerns them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves.

            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That there being three <U+017F>orts of Goods, namely, of the Minde, the Body, and Fortune; the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are <U+017F>o expos'd to the eyes of every one, 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spectators in the judgement thereof.

            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That 'tis <U+017F>o far from being true, that every
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66371:125"/>
one e<U+017F>teems his own genius becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>ees it not; that on the contrary he e<U+017F>teems it more then others, becau<U+017F>e commonly he <U+017F>ees none but it; not in its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, but in its effects. For if we value a Friend who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ents we frequently behold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, how great rea<U+017F>on mu<U+017F>t every one finde to prize his own <U+017F>pirit, whereof all the actions are in a manner pre<U+017F>ent to him? He beholds him<U+017F>elf in him<U+017F>elf morning and evening, <U+017F>leep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waking; and finding not external objects enough to compare with the multitude of internal <U+017F>pecies which his pa<U+017F>s'd actions furni<U+017F>h to him, he makes the conclu<U+017F>ion to his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. If he be a Poet, all his Sen<U+017F>es are fill'd with his Rhimes; or with his <U+017F>quare Periods, if an Orator. The memory of his exploits ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly returns to him, if he be a Souldier; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps being reviv'd by <U+017F>ome Sore or old Hurt, makes him ea<U+017F>ily pre<U+017F>ume that he is as good as a Captain; or if he be a Captain that he could better perform the office of Field-Mar<U+017F>hal then he that hath it. In brief, there is no profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion wherein the minde findes not wherewith to content, yea, to admire it <U+017F>elf, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to abate the value of others; compari<U+017F>on being like a balance, one <U+017F>cale whereof cannot be rais'd without depre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the other.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the rea<U+017F>on why every one is contented with his own Wit, is becau<U+017F>e we are never brought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our own errours, unle<U+017F>s by con<U+017F>traint or conviction. And the minde never fails of a <U+017F>ubterfuge and a preten<U+017F>e to lay the fault other-where then upon it <U+017F>elf. If haply <U+017F>ome one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that he wanted fore-<U+017F>ight, judgment, and good mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his affairs; yet he will alwayes turn the fault from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, and rather recurre to cau<U+017F>es that are not, <U+017F>aying, That he was bewitch'd, or at lea<U+017F>t deceiv'd, even <U+017F>o far as to accu<U+017F>e the truth of the mo<U+017F>t general Maxims, when they prove not to agree with his own fal<U+017F>e Principles. Whereas we are forward enough to condemn others magi<U+017F>terially both in pre<U+017F>ence and ab<U+017F>ence.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That what is receiv'd, being according to the form and capacity of the recipient, 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for the mind to conceive any thing greater then it <U+017F>elf: if it do, 'tis by nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Eye <U+017F>ees night when it <U+017F>ees nothing, and as the mo<U+017F>t perfect Souls conceive the Deity, namely by conceiving that they cannot conceive it, which is no knowledge at all. Hence the Sky, Hou<U+017F>es, Trees, and other great vi<U+017F>ible Objects enter into the Eye onely by a vi<U+017F>ual <U+017F>pecies proportional to the bigne<U+017F>s of the pupil which dimini<U+017F>hes them. So likewi<U+017F>e the under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or minde of Man, being to judge of that of another, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tracts <U+017F>uch intentional <U+017F>pecies thereof as are corre<U+017F>pondent to its own capacity, and <U+017F>uch alone as it is able to comprehend. And as the continent is bigger then the thing contained; <U+017F>o this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional Species, which repre<U+017F>ents the image of anothers minde, being le<U+017F>s then the minde which conceives it; 'tis no wonder if that which is conceived appears le<U+017F>s then that which conceives it.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66371:126"/>
For otherwi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince the under<U+017F>tanding is conform'd to the thing which it under<U+017F>tands, if it <U+017F>hould conceive an Idea of a minde greater then it <U+017F>elf is, it <U+017F>hould become greater then it <U+017F>elf, which is ab<U+017F>urd. Be<U+017F>ides, as things neare<U+017F>t us appear greate<U+017F>t, and nothing is nearer us then our <U+017F>elves, 'tis not to be marvell'd at if we pa<U+017F>s judgement to our own advantage.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <U+017F>aid, That the rea<U+017F>on of this difference is becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>pecies which concern others are not <U+017F>o deeply ingraven as tho<U+017F>e which the under<U+017F>tanding ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly traces in it <U+017F>elf; whence it is that the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of that fir<U+017F>t rank are not <U+017F>o well imprinted as the habits of the <U+017F>econd. Now that the Species re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to others are more lightly engraven than tho<U+017F>e that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our <U+017F>elves, appears by the example of the Graver, which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing but lightly over the Copper makes a little <U+017F>troke almo<U+017F>t imperceptible; whereas by its repa<U+017F><U+017F>ing <U+017F>everal times upon the <U+017F>ame place, (as is done by the frequent repetition of the <U+017F>ame thoughts upon what regards our <U+017F>elves) it makes more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lines. Perhaps al<U+017F>o this plea<U+017F>ing Error is left to Man, to comfort him for the unequal <U+017F>hare of all other Goods; which otherwi<U+017F>e would bring him into De<U+017F>pair, or at lea<U+017F>t very much increa<U+017F>e the unhappine<U+017F>s of his Life.</p>

Hence Excrements, being almo<U+017F>t wholly nitrous, <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon produce Beetles, Flyes, Worms, and other In<U+017F>ects: Sweat, beings of the <U+017F>ame Nature, makes Lice; and Urine, Fleas; the <U+017F>lime of Mar<U+017F>hes, which is nitrous, (as the turfs we u<U+017F>e for fewel mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t) produces Frogs; Boats of Salt <U+017F>warm with Rats, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others by licking the Salt: Wheat al<U+017F>o, being very ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, generates Field-mice, and other In<U+017F>ects: And all this in the unctuous moi<U+017F>ture of its <U+017F>elf, or which it renders <U+017F>uch by its Heat, which reduces the <U+017F>ame to a vi<U+017F>cou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s fit for retaining the form to be introduc'd; and as the Ebullition of Syrrops and Mu<U+017F>t, is a <U+017F>pontaneous Motion proceeding from their <U+017F>alts, <U+017F>o the <U+017F>ame being rais'd by the heat without to a more eminent degree cau<U+017F>es the progre<U+017F><U+017F>ive Motion in an Animal.

            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That both in Univocal Generation (which is compar'd to one fire kindling another) and in that by Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which hath <U+017F>ome Analogy with fire excited by a Steel) the <U+017F>ame difficulty occurrs; namely, What imperceptible Chain and Link attracts Forms, and makes them nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily de<U+017F>cend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Compound, to give it Being <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as fit Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions concur therein; whether the<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions are awaken'd by the Seed, as when you <U+017F>ow a Plant in well-prepared ground, or whether they <U+017F>pring out of the earth without <U+017F>owing, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Plants do, which are more vigorous, and le<U+017F>s need cultivation than others: by the Gardener's rea<U+017F>on, that Mothers have more care of their own Children than Nur<U+017F>es have of tho<U+017F>e of others.

Thus in the divi<U+017F>ion of Souls into vegetative, <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive, and rational, there are found middle ones not onely between <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and rea<U+017F>on, but al<U+017F>o between Vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sen<U+017F>e: Examples whereof may be <U+017F>een in the Families of Animals and Vegetables. Some Plants have no Root as <hi>Mi<U+017F>leto</hi> and <hi>Mu<U+017F>hrooms</hi>; others nothing but Root, as <hi>Trubs</hi> and <hi>Truffles:</hi> <U+017F>ome have onely leaves, as <hi>Duckmeat</hi>; others neither flowers nor <U+017F>eed, as <hi>Ferne</hi>; <U+017F>ome want leaves, as <hi>Venus-Navil</hi>; others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly put forth the Fruit before the Leaf, as the Fig-Tree; and la<U+017F>tly, <U+017F>ome Flower without bearing Fruit, as the Flower-Cherry-Tree: Of Animals, <U+017F>ome are bred of putrefaction, and of others, <U+017F>ome remain a while without motion or life (to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) as the Silk-Worm in its bag, and Snails in Winter; others remain alwayes immoveable, as Oy<U+017F>ters: And becau<U+017F>e this manner of being nouri<U+017F>h'd and growing without any progre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive motion is proper to Plants, and yet by opening and <U+017F>hutting their Shells they te<U+017F>tifie <U+017F>ome <U+017F>en<U+017F>e; therefore they are call'd Plant-animals, in which the Soul <U+017F>eems to be compounded, and to re<U+017F>emble changeable colours, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of two extreams, as Gray doth of White and Black, being wholly neither, but both together.

Indeed one may be comprehended in another, as the Vegetative is in the Sen<U+017F>itive, and this in the Rational (which comprehends all eminently) but it cannot enter into the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition of another, much le<U+017F>s be divided, informing a body that is half Plant and half Animal; otherwi<U+017F>e by the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on there might be others half Men and half Bea<U+017F>ts, which is not imaginable, but under the form of a Mon<U+017F>ter.

And as in Brutes the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive faculty <U+017F>upervening to the vegetative in their generation, adds no new form to the former; <U+017F>o the vegetation of Plants is nothing le<U+017F>s then the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive: the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of the matter being the <U+017F>ole cau<U+017F>es of this diver<U+017F>ity. An Animal depriv'd of the u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, is no le<U+017F>s an Animal then another that hath all: why then is a Tree le<U+017F>s an Animal, becau<U+017F>e it exerci<U+017F>es fewer operations of its <U+017F>oul then Animals do? Nor is it a conclu<U+017F>ive rea<U+017F>on that Plants are wholly de<U+017F>titute of the faculties of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame are not perceptible to our Sen<U+017F>es, which yet finde <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <U+017F>atisfie them<U+017F>elves in the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive Plant, growing (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> and others relate in <hi>Zanolha,</hi> a part of <hi>Tartary,</hi> where the Inhabitants <U+017F>owe a Grain like that of our Melons, but <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer; from which grows an Herb which they call <hi>Borra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metz,</hi> that is, a Lamb, whereof it hath the whole figure, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Feet, Hoofs, and Ears, yea, all the Head excepting the Horns; in<U+017F>tead whereof it hath a tuft of Hair upon the Forehead.

They <U+017F>eem too to have <U+017F>ome kinde of re<U+017F>piration; for be<U+017F>ides that they love the free Aire, towards which they encline when planted near a high Wall, or under great Trees; their Root, which is their mouth, hath <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cernment of ta<U+017F>te, e<U+017F>chewing hurtful <U+017F>oils, and <U+017F>preading freely into good ground, and not imbibing all <U+017F>orts of liquors indifferently, but onely <U+017F>uch as are convenient for them. Hence their parts have names common to tho<U+017F>e of Animals; as the Marrow, Fle<U+017F>h, Veins, Skin: In a word, they <U+017F>eem to want one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly local-motion, which yet, be<U+017F>ides the foregoing examples, is found in the <hi>Herba Viva</hi> of <hi>Aco<U+017F>ta</hi> which folds up it leaves and flowers when it is toucht; as likewi<U+017F>e Tulips do in the evening, and open the <U+017F>ame again in the morning; Marigolds follow the Sun, and thence have gotten the Latin name <hi>Sol<U+017F>equia</hi>; but more manife<U+017F>tly the Sun-flower, and the white Carline Thi<U+017F>tle, call'd the Almanack of Pea<U+017F>ants, who therefore hang it at their doors, becau<U+017F>e it folds up its flowers when a Tempe<U+017F>t is at hand. 'Tis notorious that the <hi>Bon-Chretien</hi> Pear-Tree, and the Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Tree langui<U+017F>h in places not frequented by men; and on the contrary, te<U+017F>tifie by their vigour and fertility that they delight in their conver<U+017F>ation. Hereunto might be added the experience of Wood-Cleavers who finde that a wedge enters further at the fir<U+017F>t blow then for many following; as if the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Tree clos'd it <U+017F>elf upon the fir<U+017F>t feeling it hath of its enemy. But the bending of Hazle-rods towards Mines of Gold and Silver, <U+017F>eems to denote <U+017F>omething more in them then in Animals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves. In brief, the motion of creeping Herbs may be call'd progre<U+017F><U+017F>ive: among<U+017F>t others, that of the Gourd and Cucumber which follow the neighbouring water, and <U+017F>hape their fruit in length to reach it.</p>

For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Nature <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>upplies by an Univer<U+017F>al Efficient the Defect of particular Cau<U+017F>es de<U+017F>tinated to the production of other Plants, which in mo<U+017F>t Trees and Herbs is the Seed, which this wants, as al<U+017F>o all the ordinary parts of other Plants; becau<U+017F>e 'tis of the Nature of tho<U+017F>e Animals who have not their parts di<U+017F>tinct one from another, having neither <U+017F>talk, nor leaves, nor flower, nor root, unle<U+017F>s you will call it all root; becau<U+017F>e it hath more appearance of than of any other part of a Plant: which perhaps is the cau<U+017F>e of its excellent ta<U+017F>te, which is neither <U+017F>weet as mo<U+017F>t roots are, nor <U+017F>owr as mo<U+017F>t leaves are, nor of any other kind of ta<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erv'd in the other parts of Plants, but mix'd of all ta<U+017F>ts together, being very plea<U+017F>ant, after coction hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd what was terre<U+017F>trial and aqueous in it. As for Mu<U+017F>hroms, both their Nature and Cau<U+017F>e is different; but all proceed from an excrement which the Earth ca<U+017F>ts forth of it <U+017F>elf, and which was bred therein by the perpetual tran<U+017F>colation of the Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the earth; whence they are more or le<U+017F>s hurtfull accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the greater or le<U+017F>s malignity of <U+017F>uch Humours, but always of bad juice <U+017F>utable to its Source and Material Cau<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, 'Tis the Rain of Autumn that makes the Mu<U+017F>hrom; the too great cold of Winter, and that which yet re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:66371:129"/>
in the Spring not permitting that Excrement to come forth, but <U+017F>hutting it up (as 'tis the property of Cold) and the heat and drought of Summer con<U+017F>uming the Matter that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them as fa<U+017F>t as it comes out of the Earth. But in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, when the Earth is cleft and chopt in many places by the foregoing heat of Summer, the Showers and rainy Sea<U+017F>on <U+017F>upply excrementitious matter proper for this Production. The <U+017F>ame might be <U+017F>aid of Trubs, if we <U+017F>aw not their generation to be made as 'twere in the turning of a hand, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Thunder: whereof the clefts of the upper cru<U+017F>t of the Earth are a manife<U+017F>t evidence; not in all <U+017F>oils, but only in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and le<U+017F>s cultivated; in which, culture would di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate the matter before it could acquire the preparations requi<U+017F>ite to this generation.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the <U+017F>tory of <hi>Martius Licinius</hi> <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Praetor of <hi>Rome</hi> and Governour of <hi>Spain,</hi> who in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thago Nova,</hi> biting a Trub or Tuber found in it a Roman peny of the value of <U+017F>even Engli<U+017F>h, <U+017F>hews that this lump is made of earth hardned together, as Stones and other mixt Bodies are, which grow naturally by the <U+017F>ole appo<U+017F>ition of matter without being either <U+017F>own or planted. For 'tis found in the earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either root or fibres: yea it may be call'd an imperfection of the earth, becau<U+017F>e 'tis never found in good ground but only in gravelly places near woods and bu<U+017F>hes, and hath no certain bigne<U+017F>s; <U+017F>ome being very <U+017F>mall, and others of the bigne<U+017F>s of the fi<U+017F>t and of a pound weight; <U+017F>ome, full of <U+017F>and; others not, which are the be<U+017F>t. They are al<U+017F>o of divers colours, according to that of the Soil, namely Red, Black and White, of a very <U+017F>avory relli<U+017F>h, but hard of dige<U+017F>tion, and windy. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <U+017F>hape is round, but <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions <U+017F>ome horned ones brought from <hi>Thrace,</hi> which therefore he calls <hi>Ceraunia</hi>; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o addeth, that in <U+017F>ome places (as particularly at <hi>Mitylene</hi>) the torrents produce them, and carry them along with their <U+017F>treams; that they la<U+017F>t but a year, and are more tender in the Spring then at any other <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on. Some hold that they grow not at all, but are produc'd in an in<U+017F>tant of their full bigne<U+017F>s; and their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F>e they have no organs of Nutrition, without which they cannot grow; and indeed they do not generate. This opinion would be the more probable, if what <hi>Pliny</hi> <U+017F>aith were true, namely, that there is no <U+017F>ign of cleft or chink in the earth which covers them. But experience <U+017F>hews the contrary, Swine (who are greedy of them) being lead by the <U+017F>mell they exhale through tho<U+017F>e clefts, to find them and root them out of the ground.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That Mu<U+017F>hroms are to Plants, as In<U+017F>ects are to Animals; for both are generated of corruption, and that <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly; both want di<U+017F>tinct parts, and have <U+017F>omwhat of a hurtful or venemous quality (for the mo<U+017F>t part). But Mu<U+017F>hroms are either Medicinal, as Agarick; or Alimental; or ab<U+017F>olutely
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:66371:130"/>
poy<U+017F>onous; which two latter <U+017F>pecies oftentimes differ only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <U+017F>oil. For <U+017F>uch as grow in Meadows are the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t, and the Orange-colour'd are as good and delicious in <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> as they are poy<U+017F>onous in <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> where they are ordinarily employ'd to kill Flyes, and where they cau<U+017F>e vi<U+017F>ions. Such were tho<U+017F>e which kill'd the Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> Father-in-law to <hi>Nero,</hi> who therefore term'd them <hi>the food of the Gods,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the Roman Emperours were deifi'd after their death. They are al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ometimes di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable by the colour and <U+017F>mell: The blacki<U+017F>h or livid, who<U+017F>e juice is yellowi<U+017F>h and which <U+017F>mell like Copper, being deadly; but the white, the greyi<U+017F>h, and tho<U+017F>e that are red underneath with a black juice and a plea<U+017F>ing <U+017F>mell, being alimental. The lea<U+017F>t to be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected are tho<U+017F>e which grow by Art in dunged places, or Melon-beds enrich'd with Hogs-dung rotted for the <U+017F>pace of two years. 'Tis <U+017F>aid al<U+017F>o that the good have a thicker <U+017F>tem then the bad, and al<U+017F>o a circle or crown on the top. If any malignity remain in them, <hi>Cato</hi> advi<U+017F>es to correct the <U+017F>ame by <U+017F>etting a Colewort near them, which (he <U+017F>aith) draws to it <U+017F>elf all the impurity of the earth; wherein, if <U+017F>oft, are bred Mu<U+017F>hroms; if hard, Trubs; but both without <U+017F>eed: ju<U+017F>t as Yellow-Gilly-flower and Pellitory grow <U+017F>pontaneou<U+017F>ly upon walls made with Lime and Sand; Silver-weed, in Brooks; Cre<U+017F><U+017F>es, in Springs; the Earth containing in it <U+017F>elf the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible <U+017F>eeds of many animated bodies. To the Production whereof Nitre alone (by its above mention'd fecundity) <U+017F>uffices; for finding no <U+017F>eed to determine it to any other production, it <U+017F>pends it <U+017F>elf in generating of Trubs. For be<U+017F>ides their ta<U+017F>te and mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>ual inward colour, (which is white or grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>h) their flatuo<U+017F>ity and aptne<U+017F>s to provoke Lu<U+017F>t (which two qualities are proper to Nitre) te<U+017F>tifie the <U+017F>ame; as al<U+017F>o doth their Nativity during the Thunder or Rain of Autumn, and of the end of the Spring; which <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons are full of Nitrous exhalations. The <U+017F>ame may be <U+017F>aid of Mu<U+017F>hroms, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <U+017F>pring out of Nitrous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances, as dung and earth where Salt-Peter grows.</p>

Examples whereof are <U+017F>een in all tho<U+017F>e melancholy Doters who build Ca<U+017F>tles in the Air.

Moreover, make an induction of all good things, and you will find them all in Society; without it the World would be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated in le<U+017F>s then one Age, whereas 'tis perpetuated by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Species. There is nothing to be got in <U+017F>oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, though one <U+017F>hould imitate the humor of an indefatigable Game<U+017F>ter of the<U+017F>e times, who finding no body to keep him company, plays at Cards and Dice all alone in his Clo<U+017F>et, which he <U+017F>aith is <U+017F>ome diverti<U+017F>ement to him: but the Trades-men, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer and Merchant gain nothing without Commerce, which cannot be but between many per<U+017F>ons. Plea<U+017F>ure is not <U+017F>o much as imaginable, whil<U+017F>t. a man is alone by him<U+017F>elf.

Wherefore if you take away company, you at the <U+017F>ame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive men of all the means of employing the Goods which they have gotten by their labours, and al<U+017F>o of the honour they aim'd at in enjoying the <U+017F>ame, the hopes whereof was the onely thing that <U+017F>weetned their pains.

               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:66371:131"/>The Second <U+017F>aid, Though it be hard to prai<U+017F>e <U+017F>olitude in <U+017F>o good company, yet it hath three <U+017F>orts of goods in it, which are endeavour'd to be a<U+017F>crib'd to Society: For, in ca<U+017F>e it had no other benefit but <U+017F>ilence, of the ob<U+017F>erving whereof none ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented (but of <U+017F>peaking often) the perfection of a Chri<U+017F>tian is found in it. For of the three manners of <U+017F>inning, Solitude hath none to avoid but thoughts; and thoughts them<U+017F>elves ari<U+017F>e only from the former frequentation of company: upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, tho<U+017F>e that have mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ought Innocence, have retir'd from Companies and Towns. Thus did the Prophets in the old Law, and afterwards Hermites inhabited the De<U+017F>arts of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the <U+017F>tricte<U+017F>t Religions have liv'd the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olitary. Then for the delight it affords, there is no plea<U+017F>ure like that of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Meditation, and Contemplation, which are not con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with Company: and man being more e<U+017F><U+017F>entially rea<U+017F>onable than <U+017F>ociable, who doubts but a man rea<U+017F>ons better in <U+017F>olitude then in the turmoil of company? Nay, not only the <U+017F>peculative Sciences are be<U+017F>t poli<U+017F>ht by it, but al<U+017F>o the civil and popular, as Eloquence and Poetry; the one was learnt by <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi> in his Clo<U+017F>et, and on the Sea <U+017F>hores; the other is a great friend of <U+017F>olitude, and makes its followers <U+017F>eek it. On this account the Greeks built the Temples of the Mu<U+017F>es in Woods and places remote from Towns; and night, the mother and companion of <U+017F>olitude, was by them <U+017F>tyl'd <hi>Eufrone,</hi> Wi<U+017F>e. This was al<U+017F>o the rea<U+017F>on why the Pythagoreans enjoyn'd five years <U+017F>ilence before the hearing of their Philo<U+017F>ophy: yea, tho<U+017F>e that have received mo<U+017F>t honour and contentment in conver<U+017F>ation have mo<U+017F>t lov'd Retirement; witne<U+017F>s <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> who long'd to di<U+017F>engage him<U+017F>elf one day from publick affairs; <hi>Diocle<U+017F>ian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> who went to <U+017F>eek it in <hi>Slavonia</hi>; and in the la<U+017F>t age <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth in <hi>Portugal.</hi> 'Twas not therefore without rea<U+017F>on that the Roman people cry'd that onely <hi>Vatias</hi> alone knew how to live, becau<U+017F>e he retir'd from the City into a <U+017F>olitary and de<U+017F>art place. For though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>criptions and publick Calamities had occa<U+017F>ion'd his retreat at that time; yet the contagion of company, the common depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of manners, and the contentments attending peaceful <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, are charms <U+017F>trong enough to attract any con<U+017F>idering man; be<U+017F>ides, that honour too follows it, being compar'd to the <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which flyes its pur<U+017F>uers, and follows tho<U+017F>e that avoid it. Accordingly, all tho<U+017F>e that have affected <U+017F>olitude, as among<U+017F>t the Pagans <hi>Empedocles, Apollonius, Num,</hi> the Gymno<U+017F>ophi<U+017F>ts, and our Druydes, have been mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>teem'd by men for <U+017F>o doing. And they are weak mindes which cannot <U+017F>upport them<U+017F>elves, but want the conver<U+017F>ation of others; herein re<U+017F>embling Ivy and other climing Plants, which onely creep upon the ground, if they be not propt up by <U+017F>ome other; whereas great Oakes and Elmes maintain them<U+017F>elves alone again<U+017F>t the outrages of the windes. So al<U+017F>o the mo<U+017F>t generous Bea<U+017F>ts are <U+017F>olitary, as the Lion and Elephant in De<U+017F>arts; the Eagle in Rocks and high Mountains; contrary

to Pullen and other timid Animals, which are call'd Gregarious. Hence it may be inferr'd, that Fear caus'd men to build Towns; and that (as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> <U+017F>aith) onely the multitude of <U+017F>everal faces de<U+017F>erves not the name of a company, which made <hi>Diogenes</hi> go about at noon in the Market with a Lanthorne to finde a man; and makes me conclude, that as the wi<U+017F>e Man <U+017F>hould take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment only in him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>o he ought to <U+017F>eek onely his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.

            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That indifferent things are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>ht from good and bad, in that they are <U+017F>ometimes good and profitable, <U+017F>ometimes not; but the two latter are alwayes determin'd to one end. Now no body will maintain that company is either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes good or alwayes bad.

For, is there any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety more authorized by God then Marriage? and yet 'twere a bold propo<U+017F>ition to prefer it before the contentment of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, but becau<U+017F>e this is not alwayes <U+017F>olitary, after the mode of Carthu<U+017F>ians and Hermites, company is to be preferr'd or po<U+017F>tpon'd to <U+017F>olitude, according to the <U+017F>everal circum<U+017F>tances of the one and the other.</p>

But becau<U+017F>e the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are fewer then the latter, hence <U+017F>olitude is more commonly a <U+017F>ign of a mans defect then excellency, and con<U+017F>equently compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is to be preferr'd before it.</p>

            <p>THe Aire, having mo<U+017F>t affinity with the Spirits whereby all the functions of the <U+017F>oul and body are exercis'd, and both are conjoyn'd; it may <U+017F>eem <U+017F>ufficient to give the advantage to its Inhabitants the Birds, though they had not the te<U+017F>timonies upon which men value them<U+017F>elves above their fellows, to wit, more advantages of nature, and a greater apitude to di<U+017F>ciplines then others. For they have the <U+017F>ame priviledges of walking upon the earth that other Land-Animals have; yea, <U+017F>ome of them, as the Plongeon or Ducker go upon the waters; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:66371:132"/>
they have this particular Gift of Nature, that they cleave the Air with a motion <U+017F>o <U+017F>wift, that the Holy Scripture hath expre<U+017F>s'd the <U+017F>peed of Angels by a<U+017F><U+017F>igning them wings. Nor can you imagine any action, without excepting even virtuous ones, which is not found in a Bird. The Swallow is <U+017F>kill'd in Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture; the Halcyon is able to divine how far the <hi>Nile</hi> will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, and knows that out of Nature's re<U+017F>pect to her, there will be no Tempe<U+017F>t at Sea while <U+017F>he is building her Ne<U+017F>t; the Goo<U+017F>e is <U+017F>o <U+017F>afe a Guard, that it <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>av'd the Capitol to the <U+017F>hame of the Sentinels; the Wren <U+017F>erves for a guide and a <U+017F>cout to the Crocodile; the Crow and the Turtle are patterns of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal amity; <U+017F>o are the Storks of piety; and even the <U+017F>warms of Bees, are models of Common-wealths; and the Pi<U+017F>mires, when Age and Experience has render'd them more advi<U+017F>ed, acquire wings. The Silk-worm is nothing but a Caterpiller till its wings appear; and then fluttering about it, perpetuates its <U+017F>pecies with <U+017F>uch prudence, that it doth not lay its Eggs in heaps, which would hinder their hatching, but di<U+017F>per<U+017F>es them in <U+017F>everal places, in order to being more commodiou<U+017F>ly animated by the heat of the Sun. Then, as for Art, we <U+017F>ee no Animals be<U+017F>ides Men capable of <U+017F>peech (the fir<U+017F>t of Di<U+017F>ciplines) but Birds. And the particular Examples of the Elephant, and a few other Bea<U+017F>ts that have <U+017F>hewn <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hadow of Judgement, are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the Eagle which flew into the fire, wherein her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es Body was burning, and many other In<U+017F>tances too numerous to be mention'd.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the little head of Birds, in compari<U+017F>on of the re<U+017F>t of their Body, their drine<U+017F>s and abounding Choler permit them not to be <U+017F>o intelligent as other Animals; their chattering jargon as little de<U+017F>erving the name of a Language, as their other actions do that of Virtue. Moreover, their <U+017F>leep being not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ound and deep, as that of Terre<U+017F>trial Animals, which by <U+017F>ucking their Dams are more humid; and <U+017F>leep being the re<U+017F>torer of Spirits, Birds cannot have <U+017F>uch plenty as other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Whence they <U+017F>uffer them<U+017F>elves to be more ea<U+017F>ily taken than Land-Animals, who<U+017F>e Bodies being more <U+017F>ymbolical with ours, they mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o have greater aptitude for exerci<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ome functions corre<U+017F>pondent to tho<U+017F>e of our Mind. For the cavities of their head and brains more re<U+017F>emble ours, than tho<U+017F>e either of Birds or Fi<U+017F>hes; particularly, that of the Ape, which con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is the mo<U+017F>t intelligent of all Animals next Man; with whom all will agree, that no other Animal can di<U+017F>pute the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of Judgement with the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hew of Rea<U+017F>on; if any <U+017F>hould, it would never gain the Cau<U+017F>e, in regard Man mu<U+017F>t be the Judge.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, Man hath no more rea<U+017F>on to award this Cau<U+017F>e to him<U+017F>elf, than to pretend to the advantage of flying better than Birds, or <U+017F>wimming better than Fi<U+017F>hes, who exceed all Creatures in point of Health, even to a Proverb, which is a thing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:66371:132"/>
altogether nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to the functions of the Soul. Moreover, they are of a very long Life, which begets Experience, as that doth Under<U+017F>tanding. Their Health is manife<U+017F>ted by their Fecundity; and <U+017F>ince coldne<U+017F>s is the Complexion of the wife, and Salt is reckon'd the Symbol of Wi<U+017F>dom, Fi<U+017F>hes, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Sea, and the colde<U+017F>t of all Creatures, mu<U+017F>t have a <U+017F>hare thereof. Be<U+017F>ides, if <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s of Fle<U+017F>h be a <U+017F>ign of goodne<U+017F>s of Witt every where el<U+017F>e as 'tis in Man, (and Phy<U+017F>iognomy teaches us to draw con<U+017F>equence from other Creatures to him) Fi<U+017F>hes have this advantage above all the Inhabitants either of the Air or Earth; both which, were indeed made for Man, but the Sea was primarily made for Fi<U+017F>hes; its other conveniences being only accidental. Silence, the common di<U+017F>tinction between the wi<U+017F>e and the fooli<U+017F>h, is natural to them; whereas the voices and chantings of Birds and other Animals, is oftentimes the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion of their ruine. Yea, they are <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtle, that Fi<U+017F>her-men cannot take them but with a white line, of the colour of the water; otherwi<U+017F>e, if it be gro<U+017F>s and vi<U+017F>ible, they will not come near it. Diffidence, the Parent of <U+017F>afety, is more common to them than to all other Animals, and their vigilance is greater. Land-Animals have no <U+017F>leight equall to that imperceptible charm, whereby the Torpedo chills the arm of the Fi<U+017F>her-man; or to that of the Cuttle-fi<U+017F>h, which when <U+017F>he is in danger of being taken, moils the water with her Ink to keep her <U+017F>elf from being <U+017F>een; or to that of the Polypus, who becomes of the Colour of the Rock upon which it holds, to void being perceiv'd. And though the Element of Water <U+017F>o <U+017F>eparates us from the commerce of its Inhabitants, that the hundreth part of what concerns them is unknown to us; yet there is none but ob<U+017F>erves, that Fi<U+017F>hes need more <U+017F>leights to <U+017F>ecure them<U+017F>elves from the ambu<U+017F>hes and ho<U+017F>tilities of others, than the bea<U+017F>ts of the field have, which are al<U+017F>o more ea<U+017F>ily taken. The Fi<U+017F>h call'd the Mullet, <U+017F>trikes off the bait of the hook with her tail, in<U+017F>tead of being taken by it; and if <U+017F>he cannot do <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he is contented to bite it round about; and the Sea-wolf finding her <U+017F>elf taken, <U+017F>hakes her head this way and that way with much pain, till <U+017F>he have ca<U+017F>t out the hook again; and for the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e, the Sea-fox turnes her in<U+017F>ide outwards. The Loubine and Sea-dog finding them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>urrounded with the Net, make a hole in the ground and <U+017F>culk therein, till the Net be drawn over them; but the Dolphin rejoyces in the Net, becau<U+017F>e he may with ea<U+017F>e fill him<U+017F>elf with his fellow-pri<U+017F>oners; yet when he perceives he is drawing near the <U+017F>hore, he bites the Net; which if he cannot do quick enough, the Fi<U+017F>her-men knowing him a Friend to Man, pardon him the fir<U+017F>t time, and only thru<U+017F>ting a bul-ru<U+017F>h through his <U+017F>kin let him go; if he be taken again (which <U+017F>eldom happens, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> <U+017F>aith, out of whom mo<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e Relations are taken) he is beaten. Yea, they are ingenious not only for them<U+017F>elves, but for others; for when the Gilt-head hath <U+017F>wallow'd the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:66371:133"/>
hook, his companions bite the line, and if one of them fall into one of the Me<U+017F>hes, they lend him their tails to bite and draw him through; and when the Barbles <U+017F>ee one of their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons caught they get upon him and with the indented <U+017F>pine they have upon their backs cut it a<U+017F>under. <hi>Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us</hi>'s Lamprey would take bread out of his hand, and was bewail'd by him when it dy'd: The <U+017F>tory of <hi>Arion,</hi> and that of the Fi<U+017F>h call'd <hi>Manaro</hi> in the I<U+017F>land of <hi>Hi<U+017F>paniola,</hi> which was delighted with prai<U+017F>es and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick carry'd nine or ten per<U+017F>ons upon his back, and having been wounded by a Spaniard di<U+017F>appear'd; the Raye which <hi>Olaus</hi> writes defended a man from Dogs upon the <U+017F>hore of <hi>Denmark</hi>; and the Sea-Eele which the Indians carry behind their Boats to let him play about the Tortoi<U+017F>es and other Fi<U+017F>hes which they take; are abundant in<U+017F>tances that Fi<U+017F>hes are both <U+017F>ociable and docible.

            <p>CRi<U+017F>is (if you con<U+017F>ider its derivation from a word which <U+017F>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies either to <hi>judge</hi> or to <hi><U+017F>eparate</hi> or to <hi>encounter</hi>) agrees in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort to every of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ignifications; for a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is judg'd by it, it <U+017F>eparates the good humors from the bad, and that after a combat between Nature and the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. But 'tis commonly defin'd a mutation of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e either to Health or Death, for better or for wor<U+017F>e. We mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider in it, the term of its commencement, which is the Augmentation of the Malady, whence acute ones have their Cri<U+017F>is <U+017F>ooner then Chronical; the very acute being <U+017F>ometimes judg'd in four days, in which time very malignant Fevers <U+017F>weep men away, but commonly within <U+017F>even days; acute Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are judg'd by the 14th or 20th day, and <U+017F>ometimes not before the 40th. Chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es extend to the 120th; after which term they count no longer by days but by moneths and years. The term it ends at,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66371:133"/>
is either Health or Death, or the change of one Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e into another. The term through which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es is the <U+017F>pace of time employ'd by Nature in the coction, <U+017F>eparation and excretion of the peccant Humours. The Agent or Motor is Nature, which mu<U+017F>t be a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in imperfect Cri<U+017F>es, not in <U+017F>uch as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly made. La<U+017F>tly, we mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider what is mov'd, namely the Humors; for Cri<U+017F>is hath place only in humoral Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. A perfect Cri<U+017F>is judges the Malady perfect either to Health or Death, and hath had its indices of coction the fourth day for the Cri<U+017F>is on the <U+017F>eventh, the eleventh for that on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and the <U+017F>eventeenth for that on the twentieth; it mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be manife<U+017F>t either by evacuation or ab<U+017F>ce<U+017F>s (for tho<U+017F>e that mend without apparent cau<U+017F>e relap<U+017F>e) and fall upon critical days, without any dangerous <U+017F>ymptom: and after <U+017F>uch evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation the Patient mu<U+017F>t be manife<U+017F>tly better, e<U+017F>pecially if it be univer<U+017F>al and <U+017F>utable to his Nature, Age, and Malady. Long Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are judg'd by Ab<U+017F>ce<U+017F><U+017F>es; acute, by Evacuation. In young per<U+017F>ons Fevers are judg'd commonly by Haemorrhage or <U+017F>ome flux of blood; in old men, by that of the belly. Now be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e Critical and Indicative days there are others call'd Intercidents which judge imperfectly, and others al<U+017F>o Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, becau<U+017F>e in them purgatives may be admini<U+017F>hed; which days are <U+017F>ometimes Critical, but always unfaithful, and commonly mi<U+017F>chievous; which will better appear by this general appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The fir<U+017F>t day is reckon'd from the hour of the fir<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<U+017F>ion felt by the Patient in acute Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and from the time of his decumbiture in Chronical. Yet in women newly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd we begin not to reckon from the time of parturition, unle<U+017F>s it were precipitated, but from the time of the Fever; and this fir<U+017F>t day judges no other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e but a <hi>Febris Ephemera,</hi> or one-day Fever. The <U+017F>econd day is vacant and without effect. The third is Intercident, call'd by <U+017F>ome <hi>Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it irritates and provokes Nature to make excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before the time; for being odd, it cau<U+017F>es <U+017F>ome motion in the morbifick matter, but imperfectly, as not following the order of Nature mention'd hereafter; neverthe<U+017F>s tis Critical in very acute Maladies, and <U+017F>uch as di<U+017F>order the Laws of Nature. The fourth is an index of the <U+017F>eventh, and <U+017F>hews what is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that day by either the Concoction or Crudity of the Urin and other excrements; no laudable Cri<U+017F>is hapning without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction precedent. Which holds good not only in continual Fevers, but al<U+017F>o in the fits or acce<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Intermitting ones: for the fourth day being the middlemo<U+017F>t between the fir<U+017F>t and the <U+017F>eventh, it fore<U+017F>hews the de<U+017F>ign and <U+017F>trength or weakne<U+017F>s of Nature, and what <U+017F>he is able to do on the <U+017F>eventh. The fifth re<U+017F>embles the third, being likewi<U+017F>e provocatory in Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es wherein Nature hath made an unprofitable attempt on the third, which <U+017F>he then endeavours to repair; but un<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully too, this Cri<U+017F>is being mo<U+017F>t commonly imperfect. The
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66371:134"/>
<U+017F>ixth is al<U+017F>o Intercident but ordinarily very badly critical: Whence <hi>Galen</hi> compares it to a cruel and faithle<U+017F>s tyrant, which precipitates the Patient into evident danger of life, if it do not kill him. It hath place chiefly in cholerick Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, for in <U+017F>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine ones <U+017F>alutiferous Cri<U+017F>es happen on this day, which is even; the Blood being ob<U+017F>erv'd to move on even days. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the <U+017F>eventh re<U+017F>embles a ju<U+017F>t and gentle King or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate; for neither precipitating nor deferring too long the judgment of the Patient, it gives him time of con<U+017F>ideration, judging him after its Indices fully and perfectly, <U+017F>afely, manife<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without danger. 'Tis call'd Radical, as being the root and foundation of all the other Critical Days, and the end of the fir<U+017F>t week. The eighth is of kin to the <U+017F>ixth, but not quite <U+017F>o dangerous. The ninth is the greate<U+017F>t Intercident and comes neare<U+017F>t to the nature of the Critical, though it be not of their number. The cau<U+017F>e whereof is, its being compos'd of odd numbers, wherein we have <U+017F>aid that morbifick humors are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly mov'd; or el<U+017F>e becau<U+017F>e 'tis equally di<U+017F>tant from 7 and 11. The tenth re<U+017F>embles the eighth in danger and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances. The eleventh is an index of the fourteenth, to which it hath the <U+017F>ame reference that the fourth hath to the <U+017F>eventh; <U+017F>aving that the <U+017F>econd week is le<U+017F>s active then the fir<U+017F>t, and the third then the <U+017F>econd. The twelfth is not of any con<U+017F>iderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and <hi>Galen</hi> <U+017F>aith, he never ob<U+017F>erv'd any Cri<U+017F>is, good or bad, on it. The like of the thirteenth. The fourteenth follows the <U+017F>eventh in dignity, and judges tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es which the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth did not, being the end of the <U+017F>econd week, and in this con<U+017F>ideration, odd. The fifteenth and <U+017F>ixteenth are not any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e remarkable. The <U+017F>eventeenth is an index of the twentieth, till which the intervening are in<U+017F>ignificant, and this twentieth is taken by Phy<U+017F>icians for the end of the third week, becau<U+017F>e they make the <U+017F>ame begin from the fourteenth inclu<U+017F>ively. From the 20th to the 40th, (which is the end of Cri<U+017F>is in acute di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es) every <U+017F>eventh day is critical. But after the 40th, Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are call'd Chronical, and have their Cri<U+017F>is every 20th day to 120, <U+017F>o much the more ob<U+017F>cure as they are di<U+017F>tant from the beginning. Of all which changes the Moon <U+017F>eems rather to be the cau<U+017F>e then the other Planets, or the vertue of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as being more active by rea<U+017F>on of her proximity and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparitions.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the rea<U+017F>on upon which A<U+017F>trologers attribute Cri<U+017F>is to the Moon, <hi>viz.</hi> her moving by quaternaries and <U+017F>eptenaries, (her notable<U+017F>t changes hapning every <U+017F>eventh day) is too general. For though <U+017F>he rules over Moi<U+017F>tures or Humidities, and a Cri<U+017F>is is only in Humoral Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; yet <U+017F>he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not introduce any change in the above-mentioned Critical Days rather then in others; becau<U+017F>e then <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t have this power either from her <U+017F>elf or from <U+017F>ome other, and the <U+017F>everal A<U+017F>pects of the Sun. Not from her <U+017F>elf; for then no change would
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:66371:134"/>
happen in the Moon her <U+017F>elf, nor con<U+017F>equently in us by her means, <U+017F>ince things which are of them<U+017F>elves in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ubject continue always the <U+017F>ame. Not from the Sun; for then the<U+017F>e altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es <U+017F>hould happen onely at certain po<U+017F>tures of the Moon and not in all. Now, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e <hi>Alexander</hi> fall <U+017F>ick to day, and <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> to morrow, yet neither of them <U+017F>hall have a Cri<U+017F>is but on the <U+017F>eventh day. Be<U+017F>ides, the oppo<U+017F>ition of the Moon being le<U+017F>s at the <U+017F>eventh then at the thirteenth day; the Cri<U+017F>is <U+017F>hould be rather on the latter then on the former. And the <U+017F>ame effect of the Septenary in the Conception, Life, Nutrition, and Actions of Animals, which is not ob<U+017F>erv'd hitherto; the <U+017F>tomach dige<U+017F>ting not better on the <U+017F>eventh day, and the <U+017F>eed not being <U+017F>tronger that day in the matrix then on any other: and the eighth day wherein the Moon is further from the fir<U+017F>t then <U+017F>he was on the <U+017F>eventh, <U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e the Cri<U+017F>is, and not the <U+017F>eventh. In brief, the <U+017F>eptenaries of di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es rarely agree with the Septenaries of the Quarters of the Moon; who<U+017F>e motions being unequal according to the different elevation of her Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle, would render Cri<U+017F>is uncertain. Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reckoning hit with the Lunar Motion, feign'd a Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Moneth con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of <U+017F>ix and twenty days and <U+017F>ome hours; but he hath had no followers therein. <hi>Fraca<U+017F>torius</hi> went a better way, attributing the cau<U+017F>e of Cri<U+017F>es to the motion of Melancholly, which is on the fourth day: but as the bilious humor moving alone on the third day without melancholly, doth nothing, <U+017F>o melancholly alone produceth not any Cri<U+017F>is on the fourth day. The fifth hath al<U+017F>o the motion of Bile alone, and con<U+017F>equently is without effect. The <U+017F>ixth is quiet in reference to the<U+017F>e humors, being the day of neithers motion: but on the <U+017F>eventh, the<U+017F>e two Biles concurring together make a great critical agitation. But if the matter be not then <U+017F>ufficiently fermented and concocted, the Cri<U+017F>is will not come till the fourteenth, when the <U+017F>ame motion of tho<U+017F>e two humors is again repeated.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That this opinion of <hi>Fraca<U+017F>torius</hi> makes Cri<U+017F>es fall upon dayes not critical, as the tenth, thirteenth, <U+017F>ixteenth, ninteenth, and two and twentieth, contrary to all antiquity and daily experience: and is founded in an errour, namely, that one humor cannot putrifie in the body whil<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t remain pure; <U+017F>eeing Quotidian Fevers are caus'd by Phlegm alone, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians by Choler alone, and Quartans by Melancholly alone; and that no other rea<U+017F>on can be given of the regular motion of Cri<U+017F>is, but that of the motion of the Heavens.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXIX. What Bodily Exerci<U+017F>e is the mo<U+017F>t healthful.</head>
            <p>WHat motion is to the Aire and Water, yea, and to Fire too (which it maintains) that is it to our Bodies; Ea<U+017F>e makes them heavy, and of the nature of the Earth, which of all the Elements alone delights therein: For the Body con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Elements, it nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily without motion falls into the corruption which Re<U+017F>t introduces into them: and the excrements remaining after nutrition, either recoile back into the ma<U+017F><U+017F>e of Blood, or el<U+017F>e re<U+017F>ting in that part of the body which is <U+017F>atiated with them, overcharge the <U+017F>ame, and cau<U+017F>e that plenitude which is <U+017F>o much <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected by <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> On the contrary, Motion awakens the natural heat, drives out the excrements collected by ea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>trengthens the Members, and renders all the Faculties more vigorous; provided onely that it be us'd after evacuation of the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er Excrements, and before meat, becau<U+017F>e then re<U+017F>t is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary; otherwi<U+017F>e the food in the Stomach will be <U+017F>ubverted, and the motion of the outward parts will too <U+017F>oon attract from the inward the food undige<U+017F>ted; whence many di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es ari<U+017F>e. And this right u<U+017F>e of Exerci<U+017F>e is <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to health, that the Athenians purpo<U+017F>ely dedicated a place for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>es, call'd <hi>Gymna<U+017F>iun,</hi> to <hi>Apollo</hi> the God of Phy<U+017F>ick; for which word the Art which treats of exerci<U+017F>es is call'd <hi>Gymna<U+017F>tica</hi>; and the Sorceries of <hi>Medea</hi> may be better under<U+017F>tood of Exerci<U+017F>es, which make young, and <U+017F>trengthen bodies formerly <U+017F>oft and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, than of Herbs wherewith <U+017F>he <U+017F>tuffed the bodies of old men whom <U+017F>he had jugulated; an Art, without which <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> thought a Commonwealth could not be good, and to which chiefly is to be attributed the difference found between our modern Souldiers, and the Roman Legionaries; yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the good habitude of their bodies, and the weakne<U+017F>s of ours, who have <U+017F>o intermitted their exerci<U+017F>es that onely the names of many are left. Now, <U+017F>ince motion, which to de<U+017F>erve the name of exerci<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t alter the re<U+017F>piration of the Animal, is violent to it, and of violent things we cannot take too little; I conceive that <U+017F>uch exerci<U+017F>e as holds the mean between re<U+017F>t and extream motions, is the be<U+017F>t. As Riding, or going on Hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, which giving us motion, dimini<U+017F>hes the labour thereof, and <U+017F>tirs all the parts of the body; which happens not when on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one part of the <U+017F>ame body is exercis'd, and the re<U+017F>t remain unmov'd.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Exerci<U+017F>e, which is a voluntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and agitation of the Body with re<U+017F>piration increas'd (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by 'tis di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>ht from the labour of Arti<U+017F>ans and Labourers, and from Actions accompany'd with no <U+017F>triving, as playing on

In<U+017F>truments) was transferr'd to the u<U+017F>e of Phy<U+017F>ick by one <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus</hi> according to <hi>Plato</hi> in the third Book of his Republick, and 'tis taken two wayes, either for that which is made by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion of the Body, or for <U+017F>uch motion as is external to it, as Swinging (the <hi>Petaurum</hi> of the Latins) Navigation; going in a Coach, or Litter: As for tho<U+017F>e made by the Body alone, they are of three <U+017F>orts; Athletical, Military, and Ludicrous or Pa<U+017F>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. The Athletick, though the anciente<U+017F>t, yet to me <U+017F>eem the mo<U+017F>t unprofitable, <U+017F>erving onely to harden the <U+017F>urface of the body and the extream parts, as the Armes and Legs: <U+017F>uch were Wra<U+017F>tling, (which is <U+017F>till in u<U+017F>e among our Britains, and at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tantinople</hi> before the Grand Seignior's Gate among<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars whom they call <hi>Pluyanders</hi>) Acrochiri<U+017F>m, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted onely in keeping the fingers interlac'd one within the other; Fifty-cuffs, call'd anciently <hi>Pugilatus,</hi> and imitated at this day by the Gondoliers at <hi>Venice; Cae'<U+017F>tus,</hi> wherein the hands were arm'd with plates of Copper; and <hi>Pancratia,</hi> which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Wra<U+017F>tling and Pugilate. Of this <U+017F>ort were al<U+017F>o, Running, commended by <hi>Seneca</hi> in his fifteenth Epi<U+017F>tle for the Chief of Exerci<U+017F>es, and by <hi>Plato</hi> in the eighth Book of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; Leaping on high and in length, either on both Feet, or on one (as that of the Aleman) the hand and body being void, or el<U+017F>e laden with counterpoi<U+017F>es of Lead which they call'd Halteres (as our Morrice Dancers oftentimes wear leaden Pumps, that they may be the more nimble when the <U+017F>ame are lay'd off) or with a Pole to balance them<U+017F>elves in leaping: whereunto may be added the Art of Vaulting. Military exerci<U+017F>es belonging either to the ancient or modern way of Militating, and are perform'd either on foot or on hor<U+017F>e-back. To the former belongs Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, anciently the Art of the Gladiators, and at this day much practis'd with Sword and Dagger: to which may be added ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Pike, Halbard, and Quarter-<U+017F>taff, ca<U+017F>ting of Bullets, the Spani<U+017F>h <U+017F>port of running at Bulls, and the hurling of the Zagaye or Lance in Turkey, and <U+017F>hooting with a Bowe or a Gun at a Mark. Military Exerci<U+017F>es on Hor<U+017F>e-back are fighting at Barriers, running at the Ring and Quintin: to which may be referr'd all <U+017F>orts of hunting. The la<U+017F>t kinde of Exerci<U+017F>es which relate to <U+017F>port are Dancing, the dangerous Tricks of Tumblers, who <U+017F>eems to practi<U+017F>e the Cubi<U+017F>tick Art of the Ancients; the Di<U+017F>k or Coiting, which <U+017F>eems common to them with us; and the Ball, of which among the Greeks there were four <U+017F>orts, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering according to the greatne<U+017F>s or <U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s of the Ball and the In<U+017F>truments wherewith they <U+017F>truck. Adde to the<U+017F>e our modern pa<U+017F>times of Pail-Mail, Tennis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Next to which you may reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Shouting, or the exerci<U+017F>e of the Voice, which opens the Brea<U+017F>t, excites Heat, and cur'd the infirmity of <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi>'s tongue; whence <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> allows Children to cry, becau<U+017F>e it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Humidities of their Brains. But of all Exerci<U+017F>es I think none equal to Walking; as that which comes neare<U+017F>t natural
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:66371:136"/>
motions, is ea<U+017F>ie, con<U+017F>umes <U+017F>uperfluities, helps re<U+017F>piration, <U+017F>trengthens the <U+017F>tomach, recreates the Sen<U+017F>es and Spirits, and appea<U+017F>es the commotions of the Soul: upon which the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick Philo<U+017F>ophers cho<U+017F>e it as an exerci<U+017F>e <U+017F>erviceable to the minde and body both together.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That he was of <hi>Galens</hi> opinion, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd a Book concerning the Exerci<U+017F>e of the little Ball, which he preferrs before all other for <U+017F>ix principal rea<U+017F>ons. Fir<U+017F>t, Becau<U+017F>e it exerci<U+017F>es and delights the minde as well as the body; which plea<U+017F>ure is the greater in that it is not di<U+017F>hone<U+017F>t; this kinde of play being of the rank of the honorable. Secondly, Becau<U+017F>e Hunting, which may be alledg'd to be of that rank, needs a great train of nets or hays, hor<U+017F>es, dogs, birds, and other <U+017F>uch equipage; whereas the Game of Ball, even as it was practis'd in <hi>Galen</hi>'s time, when they play'd with the palm of the Hand without <U+017F>tick or racket, may be exercis'd by all <U+017F>orts of per<U+017F>ons; and this every one knows, that a Good is the better for being the more common. Thirdly, Becau<U+017F>e Hunting requires much lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure, of which only rich and idle per<U+017F>ons are capable; whereas a Scholar or Trade<U+017F>man may, without much prejudice to their ordinary Employment, divert them<U+017F>elves at this play: Which (in the Fourth place) exerci<U+017F>es all the parts of the Body almo<U+017F>t equally; which mo<U+017F>t other motions do not, <U+017F>ome exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>ing only the upper, <U+017F>ome only the lower parts, and that to exce<U+017F>s: Which (in the Fifth place) happens not <U+017F>o commonly in this, wherein you may play as fa<U+017F>t or as <U+017F>low as you plea<U+017F>e; the exce<U+017F>s which <U+017F>ome commit therein, proceeding only from the irregularity of their Mind, from which the more di<U+017F>creet are free, retiring upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>weat, if they have no other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the Sixth place, it hath no danger as Hunting hath, where the Boar's tooth, the Stag's horn, and the ca<U+017F>ualties of falling from the Hor<U+017F>e, at lea<U+017F>t exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive toil and wearine<U+017F>s, are more certain oftentimes than the plea<U+017F>ure expected from it; as Running al<U+017F>o cau<U+017F>eth breaking of the Veins; and Wra<U+017F>tling. di<U+017F>location of Members. Whereto it may be added, that the Body acquires dexterity by the Game of Ball.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That that Exerci<U+017F>e <U+017F>eems mo<U+017F>t healthful, which is <U+017F>uitable to every one's Nature. Walking is not for the lame, nor running for the Phthi<U+017F>ical. Above all, every one's Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tom is con<U+017F>iderable, in which regard the Exerci<U+017F>e of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion leaves us le<U+017F>s Exerci<U+017F>e than tho<U+017F>e of others. Wherefore I conclude, for Exerci<U+017F>es which be<U+017F>ides the motion of the Body, and the diverti<U+017F>ement of the Mind, leave <U+017F>ome profit behind them; as when a Man of Affairs gives his di<U+017F>patches and re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as, he is walking, and the Vine-dre<U+017F><U+017F>er by exerci<U+017F>ing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf in digging his Vineyard, finds in the Evening, be<U+017F>ides the good Stomack he hath gotten, the end of the ta<U+017F>k which he had propos'd to him<U+017F>elf.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXX. Whether Vertue con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in Mediocrity.</head>
            <p>'TIs the property of every thing de<U+017F>titute of Rea<U+017F>on, to be carried to Extremities; the Stone to the Centre; Fire to the Circumference; the Earth imbibes as much water, and an Animal eats as much food as it can; the Spider weaves as long as it hath where-withall, the Nightingale <U+017F>ings oftentimes till <U+017F>he bur<U+017F>ts; every Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion guided by it <U+017F>elf alone, is carry'd to the utmo<U+017F>t point. 'Tis rea<U+017F>on alone that pre<U+017F>cribes bounds to the<U+017F>e Extremities, which are every where found vicious. On this account, <hi>Daedalus</hi> in the Fable enjoyn'd his Son <hi>Icarus</hi> not to take his flight neither too high, for fear le<U+017F>t the wax of his wings <U+017F>hould melt at the approach of the fire, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd was in the Sphere of the Sun; nor yet too near the Sea, for fear of wetting them: But to take the middle way in the Air, which cour<U+017F>e all have held that have been happy. And as that Man is in<U+017F>upportable, who<U+017F>e Avarice <U+017F>pares his Wine at the fir<U+017F>t pint; <U+017F>o Thrift is too late, when you are come to the bottom of the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el. The Prodigal by doing good to others, does hurt to him<U+017F>elf; the Mi<U+017F>er does no good to others, and much le<U+017F>s to him<U+017F>elf; he alone that keeps a mea<U+017F>ure in his Gifts, de<U+017F>erves the name of Vertuous, and makes his Liberality e<U+017F>teem'd. Ra<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s does oftentimes as much, and more mi<U+017F>chief as Cowardi<U+017F>e; but Valour, holding a mean between both, prevents it. The <U+017F>ame may be <U+017F>hewn by Induction in all the Vertues, which have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been conceiv'd to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the middle. In con<U+017F>ideration whereof, the Wi<U+017F>e-man prayes for neither plenty nor want, that he may e<U+017F>chew the inconveniences of both; but for a Mediocrity, to which the Ancients, to <U+017F>hew their e<U+017F>teem thereof, gave the attribute of Golden.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Mediocrity is an Invention of mean and irre<U+017F>olute Souls, who in expectation what <U+017F>ide to take, would keep them<U+017F>elves indifferent to any choice; and <U+017F>o long as they do <U+017F>o, they <U+017F>hew their want of Ma<U+017F>culine Virtue, which alone ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli<U+017F>hes great de<U+017F>ignes, though with great pains, which are the rate for which in old time the Gods <U+017F>old every thing; nor is there a clearer market now-a-dayes, wherein we <U+017F>ee none thrive that are neither Fi<U+017F>h nor Fle<U+017F>h, and are alwayes to <U+017F>eek for a Ma<U+017F>ter, but only <U+017F>uch as have found a good one.

(perfect Fruition admitting only Love) ought to be <U+017F>o extream, that it can never be too much; <U+017F>ince we are oblig'd to endanger our <U+017F>elves for others, and to love God more than our <U+017F>elves, and our neighbours as much as our <U+017F>elves, whom we always love too much. Let us <U+017F>ee now, whether Ju<U+017F>tice loves Extremities be<U+017F>t; concerning which matter, we find it <U+017F>aid, that the highe<U+017F>t Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice is the highe<U+017F>t Inju<U+017F>tice. Then for Cha<U+017F>tity, Is it fit for a Woman (think you) to lend one port of her honor to a Friend, and to keep the other? In brief, Do we not <U+017F>ee that a too cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>pect Captain de<U+017F>erves not the Name of valiant, but quits it for that of prudent? And in the practice of Prudence, he who bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances too long, and takes not a <U+017F>peedy Re<U+017F>olution to pur<U+017F>ue the <U+017F>ame yet more courageou<U+017F>ly, is abandon'd by all the World. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Laws of the <hi>Athenians</hi> puni<U+017F>h'd tho<U+017F>e that would <U+017F>wim between two waters, taking no <U+017F>ide in a publick Sedition; as judging it better to fail in the choice of the one or the other of <U+017F>uch parties, than to take none at all. If you have to do with a Prie<U+017F>t about a Ca<U+017F>e of Con<U+017F>cience, is any thing more in<U+017F>upport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than to find an unre<U+017F>olv'd Mind? The <U+017F>ame may be <U+017F>aid of an Ambiguous Lawyer and Phy<U+017F>itian, who <U+017F>end back their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Patients more di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfi'd than they came. He that <U+017F>eeks Employment under Grandees, mu<U+017F>t not boa<U+017F>t of Mediocrity in his abilities to <U+017F>erve; Diligence will not admit divi<U+017F>ion, much le<U+017F>s fidelity; nothing plea<U+017F>es but what is extream: Which po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly hath brought Hyperboles into <U+017F>uch credit at Court, and made nothing more u<U+017F>ual in commendations, than the word Extreamly.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid. That <U+017F>ince a Defect and an Exce<U+017F>s is incident to all Humane Actions, Rea<U+017F>on requires that we a<U+017F><U+017F>ign the middle place to Virtue, which is defin'd by <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> An Elective Habit con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in a Rational Mediocrity: And if any be found that <U+017F>eem to be only in Exce<U+017F>s, as Humidity in an extream Aba<U+017F>ing of of our <U+017F>elves; Magnanimity in Courage rais'd above the greate<U+017F>t things; yet their <U+017F>everal circum<U+017F>tances, e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e of their End, <U+017F>erve to qualifie and determine them. This Cha<U+017F>tity which <U+017F>eems uncapable in exce<U+017F>s (<U+017F>ince a Virgin cannot be too cha<U+017F>te) yet was vicious in the Ve<U+017F>tals, becau<U+017F>e they had an Evil End in Pagani<U+017F>m, as it is virtuous in our Nunns.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid. That Virtue being high and <U+017F>ublime, this argues that it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in extremity; as al<U+017F>o do all the Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Virtues; Charity, as is above declar'd; Faith, the lea<U+017F>t doubtings wherein are criminal; and Hope, which never wavers. So likewi<U+017F>e do the Cardinal Virtues, among<U+017F>t which the inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ju<U+017F>tice of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Ari<U+017F>tides,</hi> far <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>eth in dignity the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodements and wayes of Accord of Arbitrators, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes need a <U+017F>upream Authority to be authoriz'd and executed. Hence a <U+017F>evere Judge of the<U+017F>e times having remitted a little of his ordinary <U+017F>everity, to comply with the Humors of the Age, was <U+017F>aid, To have become a Man; as if he had been Divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:66371:137"/>
As for Temperance, Cha<U+017F>tity which is a Species thereof, is more laudable and better merits the name of Vertue in a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin then in a Wife; and the ab<U+017F>tinence of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who is <U+017F>aid to have fa<U+017F>ted from the Nur<U+017F>e's Brea<U+017F>t, or that of S. <hi>Simon Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> was much more vertuous than ordinary Fa<U+017F>tings. In brief, Prudence, though it teach us to keep the middle every where, yet is de<U+017F>pis'd when accounted indifferent. Moreover, by the Rea<U+017F>on of Contraries, Vertue mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in extremities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e Vice does <U+017F>o; and if Vertue <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the middle (which partakes of the nature of the extreams) it <U+017F>hould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed of two extream Vices; which is ab<U+017F>urd. So the Earth, the vile<U+017F>t part of the World, is in the mid<U+017F>t; and Heaven, the noble<U+017F>t, at the extremities, which are the circumferences. Otherwi<U+017F>e we might with <U+017F>ome probability render the <U+017F>ame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on that a Satyre of the<U+017F>e times did, why there are <U+017F>o few vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous per<U+017F>ons now-a-days; Becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aith he, Envious Antiquity plac'd Vertue in the middle which is a point, and a point is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be found.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid; That we mu<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h Moral vertues from Theological. The former con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in mediocrity, but not the later; and are therefore call'd <U+017F>upernatural as not only attaining but <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the bounds of Nature; yet every moderate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral action is not vertuous, nor every extream vicious. For <U+017F>ome are always Vice how little <U+017F>over you take of them; as Adultery, Homicide, and Theft; others, always Vertue in whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity they be found; as Temperance and Fortitude. And becau<U+017F>e Action, wherein Vertue con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts, is of particular things, this is be<U+017F>t verifi'd by examples. Thus Liberality is a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Avarice and Prodigality; the Avarous being exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive in receiving and defective in giving; the Prodigal, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive in giving and defective in receiving. Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence hath the <U+017F>ame re<U+017F>pe<U+017F>t to great expences that Liberality hath to le<U+017F>s. The regular de<U+017F>ire of moderate Honors hath for its extreams. Contempt of Honor and Ambition; Magnificence hath the like, in reference to great honors. Man<U+017F>uetude or Clemency is between Choler which is offended with every thing, and Stupidity which is offended with nothing: Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, between Boa<U+017F>ting and Di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation; Facetiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Bouffonry and Ru<U+017F>ticity; Amity, between Flattery, Moro<U+017F>ity and Pratling; Mode<U+017F>ty between Fear and Impudence. Indignation to <U+017F>ee the wicked abu<U+017F>e Fortune, between Envy which is troubled at the pro<U+017F>perity both of good and bad, and Malevolence which rejoyces at the harm of both; Sufferance, between Softne<U+017F>s and In<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility; Prudence, between Stupidity and Craft. In <U+017F>hort, all Vertues will be found thus, and have their extreams, although their names are not always ea<U+017F>ie to expre<U+017F>s.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXI. Whether the Imagination be able to produce and cure Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es.</head>
            <p>AS Health is a natural Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition fit for performing the <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral operations of the Bodie's Organs, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in the due temper of the Similar parts, the Symmetry of the Organical, and the union of both together; <U+017F>o a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition contrary to nature, hindering the <U+017F>ame Functions by de<U+017F>troying the Temperament of the fir<U+017F>t Qualities, the proportion and laudable conformation of the Organs; and the Union of both; whence ari<U+017F>e three <U+017F>orts of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, <hi>viz.</hi> Intemperies, ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and Solution of Continuity. Now the Que<U+017F>tion is, Whether the Imagination can of it <U+017F>elf hinder the ordinary Functions of the Similar parts, by de<U+017F>troying the harmony and temper of the four fir<U+017F>t Qualities, which is the principle of their actions; as al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e of the Organical parts, by changing the natural Figure, Magnitude, Number and Situation of the<U+017F>e Parts, and the action of both by the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution and divorce of them a<U+017F>under. Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of bare Intemperature, which is either <U+017F>imple or with matter, the Imagination may produce by moving the Spirits and Humors; which it hath power to do. For the Spirits being aerious and naturally very hot, when they are <U+017F>ent by a <U+017F>trong Imagination into <U+017F>ome part, they may <U+017F>o heat it as by the exce<U+017F>s of their heat to de<U+017F>troy the temper of <U+017F>uch part; as Anger <U+017F>ometimes heats the Body into a Fever. And as the too great concour<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Spirits makes hot intemperatures, <U+017F>o their ab<U+017F>ence from other parts cau<U+017F>es cold Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; as cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and indige<U+017F>tions, familiar to <U+017F>uch as addict them<U+017F>elves to Study and Meditation after Meat; the Spirits which <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve for Concoction being carry'd from the Stomack to the Brain. In like manner, the Imagination having dominion over the Humors, which it moves by mediation of the Spirits; as Joy, Shame, and Anger bring blood and heat into the Face and outward parts; and Fear and Sadne<U+017F>s give them a contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it appears that it hath power to produce Maladies of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies with matter by the fluxion or conge<U+017F>tion of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors into <U+017F>ome part, and out of their natural <U+017F>eat. But if the Phan<U+017F>ie can di<U+017F>order the work of Conformation in another body then its own (as that of an Infant, who<U+017F>e marks and defects wherewith he is born, are effects of his Mothers Phan<U+017F>ie) much more may it cau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>order in its own Body, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is more nearly conjoyn'd. Wherefore, <U+017F>ince it can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troy the temper of the Similar parts and the harmony of the Organs, it may al<U+017F>o cau<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and by the <U+017F>ame means
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:66371:138"/>
cure them too: for if contraries be cur'd by their contraries, then it may cure a cold di<U+017F>temper by producing a hot one; and if it hath power to cau<U+017F>e by motion of the humors an ob<U+017F>tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <U+017F>ome part, it may by the <U+017F>ame means return them to their natural place, and cure <U+017F>uch ob<U+017F>truction. 'Twas to the Phan<U+017F>ie that the cure of tho<U+017F>e Splenetick per<U+017F>ons is to be attributed, who were cur'd by the touch of the great Toe of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s left Foot; and we <U+017F>ee many Cures wrought by Amulets, Periapts, and other like Remedies; which having no vertue in them<U+017F>elves to produce <U+017F>uch an effect, the <U+017F>ame mu<U+017F>t be referr'd to <U+017F>ome other cau<U+017F>e. Now none hath more empire then the Imagination over the Spirits and other Humours, wherein almo<U+017F>t all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the Imagination being a <U+017F>imple Cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>citive Power cannot of it <U+017F>elf produce the effects that are a<U+017F>crib'd to it. For all Cognition is Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and to know is to <U+017F>uffer and receive the Species of the thing that is to be known, who<U+017F>e im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion made upon the Organs of Sen<U+017F>e is by them carry'd to the Imagination, which judges thereof upon their report. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there is this notable difference between the Sen<U+017F>itive or Cogno<U+017F>citive Powers, and the Vegetative or Motive which are de<U+017F>titute of all Cognition, that the latter are active out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves and operate upon the Members, which the Motive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty moves with full power, and upon the aliments which the Vegetative Faculties (as the Nutritive and Auctive) alter and turn into the nature of the parts. But the Sen<U+017F>itive Faculties and all other Cogni<U+017F>citive Powers have no real <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible action. They are active indeed <U+017F>o far as they are powers i<U+017F><U+017F>uing from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perfect Forms, but their actions are immanent and produce nothing beyond them<U+017F>elves, and con<U+017F>equently can have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence abroad. So that the Imagination cannot immediately and of its own nature produce either a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e or Health in the Body, but only by means of the Motive Power or Sen<U+017F>itive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions whereof are acknowledg'd by Phy<U+017F>itians to be the external cau<U+017F>es of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. If the Phan<U+017F>ie could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing, it <U+017F>hould be by help of the Species it is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated withall; which being extracted from things, <U+017F>ome think that they eminently contain the vertues of the objects from whence they i<U+017F><U+017F>ue and whereof they are Pictures, and that hence it is that the Teeth are <U+017F>et on edge upon the hearing of grating <U+017F>ounds, that the <U+017F>ight of a Potion purges many, and that of <U+017F>alt things makes the Stomack ri<U+017F>e in others, and that the thought of the Plague oftentimes propagates it more then the corruption of the Air. Neverthele<U+017F>s the<U+017F>e effects proceed only from the various motion of Heat and the Spirits caus'd by the Appetite and the Motive Power, which are di<U+017F>tinct from the Imagination. For if the Species had the <U+017F>ame power with the objects from which they i<U+017F><U+017F>ue, they would not be perfective but de<U+017F>tructive of their Organs; the Species of Heat would burn
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:66371:139"/>
the Brain, that of Cold would cool it, both would de<U+017F>troy it, which is contrary to experience. For though Heat and Cold are contraries in Nature, yet they are not <U+017F>o in the Under<U+017F>tanding, but rather friendly; the one contributing to the knowledg of the other; and the end of Intentional Species is not to alter, but onely to repre<U+017F>ent the objects whereof they are copies.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> hath built his Phy<U+017F>iognomy upon the great connection and <U+017F>ympathy of the Soul with the Body, which is <U+017F>uch, that the one cau<U+017F>eth con<U+017F>iderable changes in the other: To which purpo<U+017F>e the Soul employes no other more effectual in<U+017F>trument then the Imagination. Which power of the Soul upon the Body is evinc'd by the mighty effects of the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, e<U+017F>pecially of Fear, Love, and Anger; Fear ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kill'd many, as particularly St. <hi>Valier</hi> before the <U+017F>troke of the Executioner: On which account it is al<U+017F>o that Mirth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for one of the be<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ervatives from the Plague. And we <U+017F>ee that Fear and Sadne<U+017F>s are no le<U+017F>s the cau<U+017F>es then the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible <U+017F>igns of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e call'd Melancholy. The <U+017F>ame is further verified by the <U+017F>trange Hi<U+017F>tories of tho<U+017F>e, who being become <U+017F>ick by Fancy, could not be cur'd but by curing the Fancy fir<U+017F>t; the Remedy being to be of the <U+017F>ame kinde with the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. Thus he who fancy'd he had no head, could not be re<U+017F>tor'd to his right <U+017F>en<U+017F>e till the Phy<U+017F>ician clapping a leaden Cap upon him, left him to complain a while of the Head-ache. And another, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <U+017F>tudy'd Phy<U+017F>ick a little, and took up a conceit that he had a prodigious excre<U+017F>cence in his <hi>Inte<U+017F>tinum Rectum,</hi> could not be cur'd till the Chirurgeon had made <U+017F>emblance of cauterizing it. Another Gentleman who dur<U+017F>t not pi<U+017F>s for fear of cau<U+017F>ing an univer<U+017F>al Deluge, was cur'd of his conceit by the Countrey peoples crying out, Fire, and de<U+017F>iring him to quench it. In like manner another believing him<U+017F>elf dead would not eat, and had dy'd in good earne<U+017F>t, had not his Nephew (who was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dead) come into his Chamber in a winding Sheet, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to eat before his Uncle, who thereupon did the like. And to go no further, the tying of the Codpiece-point is accounted an effect of the Fancy, and is cur'd by curing the Fancy alone. So likewi<U+017F>e a Lord of Quality falling <U+017F>ick accidentally in a poor Village, and complaining le<U+017F>s of his Malady then that he <U+017F>hould dye without a Phy<U+017F>ician: no other expedient was found but to cloath his Cook in the Curates Gown; upon which he pre<U+017F>ently became half cur'd: but cau<U+017F>ing the Curtains to be undrawn that he might the better <U+017F>ee to thank his Doctor, he di<U+017F>cover'd the deceit, and fell <U+017F>ick again more dangerou<U+017F>ly then before: his imagination thus producing the effects both of <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>

            <p>FA<U+017F>cination or Bewitching is the doing of hurt to one by <U+017F>ight, without Contact mediate or immediate; to deny which, is to deny common experience, the verdict of all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, of the Learned, and of the Holy Scripture it <U+017F>elf.

Others think it an effect purely natural; as a Blear Eye infects the beholder with the <U+017F>ame evil; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> <U+017F>aith, He <U+017F>aw certain ancient people call'd <hi>Thibii,</hi> who by their a<U+017F>pect hurt not onely Children, but perfect men: the vi<U+017F>ual rayes being render'd more active by the evil habit of tho<U+017F>e that have intention to hurt out of envy, which is di<U+017F>cern'd commonly by frequent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the pro<U+017F>perity of a hated per<U+017F>on; whence comes the word <hi>Invidere.</hi> An example whereof is <U+017F>een in the little Bird call'd a Witwal, which becomes <U+017F>ick by the <U+017F>ight of one that hath the Jaundies; whereof the Bird being pre<U+017F>ently con<U+017F>cious <U+017F>huts its eyes upon <U+017F>uch a per<U+017F>ons approach.

<U+017F>oul promoting the operations of the body; as the imagination excites love, and eager Dogs <U+017F>ometimes become blinde through the violence wherewith they pur<U+017F>ue their Game.

This word is us'd and tran<U+017F>lated by St. <hi>Au<U+017F>tin,</hi> Fa<U+017F>cination; and the Chaldeans call'd it an evil-Eye, as el<U+017F>ewhere that Eye of the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hireling is <U+017F>o term'd. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> <U+017F>peaks plainly of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. a<U+017F>king the Galatians, <hi>Who hath bewitched or fa<U+017F>cinated you not to obey the Truth?</hi> Which St. <hi>An<U+017F>elm</hi> interprets thus, <hi>Who hath hurt you by a livid and envious beholding of your perfection, or (like Enchanters) hath deluded you and made you <U+017F>ee one thing for another?</hi> And <hi>Tertullian</hi> <U+017F>aith, That Fa<U+017F>cination, which <U+017F>o followeth Prai<U+017F>e, that the one is taken for the other, is a work of the Devil, and <U+017F>ometimes al<U+017F>o a puni<U+017F>hment of God upon <U+017F>uch as forget them<U+017F>elves through vanity.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Fa<U+017F>cination in the vulgar <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, is not onely po<U+017F><U+017F>ible but natural, though the cau<U+017F>e be occult; as al<U+017F>o are magnetical and electrical attractions. Thus maleficiated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons infect by in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible tran<U+017F>piration what they wear about them<U+017F>elves: whereunto the eye's <U+017F>tructure and temper renders it the fitte<U+017F>t part of the body; whence, be<U+017F>ides Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the eyes, we <U+017F>ee Tears ea<U+017F>ily draw others from tho<U+017F>e that behold them <U+017F>hed. <hi>Pliny</hi> relates that the Tribalians and Illyrians when angry, kill'd people by their a<U+017F>pect alone. And <hi>Olaus,</hi> That the <U+017F>ame is done at this day in <U+017F>ome Northern Nations. 'Tis read of <hi>Tiberius</hi> that his eyes <U+017F>parkled in the night, in<U+017F>omuch that a Souldier dy'd by beholding him. And <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> <U+017F>o terrifi'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, who came to di<U+017F>patch him, that onely by looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he render'd him unable to touch him: For, whether vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion be by Emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion (as the Platoni<U+017F>ts hold) the Rayes will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them the qualities of the Eye that emits them; or by Reception (as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> will have it) the colours re<U+017F>ulting from the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the qualities of a vi<U+017F>ible object will not be de<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the <U+017F>ame qualities; or partly by emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and partly by reception (according to <hi>Galen</hi>) the rencontre of both <U+017F>orts of Rayes cannot but be of great efficacy, e<U+017F>pecially when animated by the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Choler, which enflames them, or of Envy, which envenoms them.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That there are two <U+017F>orts of Fa<U+017F>cination, the one natural, performed by natural means, as venomous and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:66371:140"/>
qualities, which are <U+017F>ent from one body to another, and infect the <U+017F>ame by their malignity; the other <U+017F>upernatural and diabolical, perform'd by <U+017F>ecret means, whereby the vulgar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Witches can make <U+017F>ick whom they plea<U+017F>e by touching, beholding, and <U+017F>peaking to them; which three wayes they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to bewitch tho<U+017F>e to whom they de<U+017F>ire mi<U+017F>chief. The fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ort of Fa<U+017F>cination is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and is founded upon the Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and Contrariety which is found between almo<U+017F>t all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; <U+017F>o that even the <U+017F>hadows of <U+017F>ome Trees are noxious to <U+017F>ome Animals, as that of the Yew to Man, and that of the A<U+017F>h to Serpents. The Fig-Tree appea<U+017F>es the madne<U+017F>s of the Bull when he is ty'd to it, by emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of certain vaporous <U+017F>pirits, which entring into him temper and reduce him to moderation: and from the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on meat hang'd on a Fig-Tree becomes more tender and delicate, to wit, by attenuating its gro<U+017F><U+017F>er parts. For the heat of every living body ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly rai<U+017F>ing, and <U+017F>ending forth vapors and <U+017F>pirits, when the<U+017F>e <U+017F>pirits meet others like them<U+017F>elves, they <U+017F>erve them in<U+017F>tead of a recruit, and increa<U+017F>e the good di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the body wherein they are. And 'tis this way that old women prejudice the health of Children, whil<U+017F>t their vapid <U+017F>pirits are imbib'd by the tender <U+017F>kin of the Infants, and <U+017F>o corrupting the humors, di<U+017F>order their natural functions. Hence al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>umptive per<U+017F>ons give their di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e to <U+017F>uch as breathe near them; and <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e all contagious and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult maladies are communicated by one morbid <U+017F>ubject, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other di<U+017F>pos'd to receive the <U+017F>ame affection. But the latter <U+017F>ort of Fa<U+017F>cination, whereby common people think that not onely men and Animals may be kill'd, but al<U+017F>o plants dry'd up, <U+017F>treams <U+017F>topt, <U+017F>tones broken in pieces, and the like; is no-wi<U+017F>e in the power of nature, whatever the Arabians <U+017F>ay, who a<U+017F>cribe all the<U+017F>e effects to imagination, who<U+017F>e power they equal to that of Intelligences, who are able to move the whole Univer<U+017F>e. For if it doth nothing of it <U+017F>elf in its proper body, where it <U+017F>imply receives the <U+017F>pecies of things, it mu<U+017F>t do le<U+017F>s without its precinct. Moreover, 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for a <U+017F>ound man to make another <U+017F>ick, becau<U+017F>e he cannot give what him<U+017F>elf hath not; they, in whom by an extraordinary corruption the blood, <U+017F>eed, or other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors have acquir'd a venomous quality, being nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily <U+017F>ick. So that 'tis a pure work of Devils; who knowing the properties of things, apply the <U+017F>ame really to the parts of the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our privity, whil<U+017F>t they amuze our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es with other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as the a<U+017F>pect of another per<U+017F>on, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch in<U+017F>ignificant thing. Be<U+017F>ides that, children being apt to lo<U+017F>e their fle<U+017F>h upon unapparent cau<U+017F>es, <U+017F>uch a change may be purely natural, whil<U+017F>t it is by mi<U+017F>take charg'd upon a <U+017F>trangers prai<U+017F>es of the Infant, who mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily grow wor<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e it cannot become better.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXIII. Of Amulets; and whether Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are curable by Words, Tickets, or other things hang'd at the Neck, or applyed to the body of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed.</head>
            <p>THis Que<U+017F>tion depends upon the Precedent; for if 'tis po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible to make a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>ick by the A<U+017F>pect alone, it may <U+017F>eem al<U+017F>o po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to cure him by Contact alone. In the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining of the matter, we mu<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h, as el<U+017F>ewhere al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural cures from tho<U+017F>e which come to pa<U+017F>s according to the cour<U+017F>e of nature. Of the former <U+017F>ort are all the Miracles of the Holy Scripture, and Eccle<U+017F>ia<U+017F>tical Hi<U+017F>tory, tho<U+017F>e which Gods power manife<U+017F>ts in all times by his Saints, and the cure which he hath re<U+017F>erv'd to our Kings by their <U+017F>ole Touch. Some cure may likewi<U+017F>e happen naturally by the pronouncing of words, when the Patients Fancy is <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong that it hath power enough over his body to introduce <U+017F>ome notable change therein; whence that Phy<U+017F>ician cures mo<U+017F>t, in whom mo<U+017F>t confide. Thus I have <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons eas'd of the Tooth-ache, upon <U+017F>ticking a knife in a Tree, and pronouncing <U+017F>ome barbarous words. But it falls out oftentimes, that the effect of one cau<U+017F>e is attributed to another. Such was the cure of a Gentleman of the Ligue, whom the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. <U+017F>urprized in the Town of <hi>Loges</hi> as he was <U+017F>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering with a Quartain Ague, and the King in Railery <U+017F>ent him a Receipt again<U+017F>t his Ague; the <U+017F>ight whereof pre<U+017F>ently cur'd him, through the fear he had of that unexpected approach. So al<U+017F>o many remedies act by <U+017F>ome occult property, as Paeony hung about Childrens necks again<U+017F>t the Epilep<U+017F>y; and Quick-<U+017F>ilver ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd upon the Brea<U+017F>t, or hung in a Quill, is believ'd a pre<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive again<U+017F>t the Pe<U+017F>tilence: all precious <U+017F>tones are thought to have <U+017F>ome vertue again<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the body or minde: The Eagle-<U+017F>tone apply'd to the Arm retains the child in the Womb; and to the knee, facilitates Delivery: Coral and the Ja<U+017F>per <U+017F>top Blood: the Nephitick Stone is conceiv'd to void the Gravel of the Kidneyes; the hinder foot of a Hare carry'd in the Pocket cures the Sciatica of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ide from which it was taken. For, Remedies who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ole application cures by their penetrating and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible vertue are not of this rank. Thus, if Quick-<U+017F>ilver apply'd cures the Pox by cau<U+017F>ing a Flux at the mouth, it mu<U+017F>t not be term'd an Amulet; nor Cantharides, when apply'd, as a ve<U+017F>icatory, they cau<U+017F>e Urine; nor Epithemes apply'd to the Heart or Liver: but herbs and other things laid to the Patients wri<U+017F>t may be <U+017F>o <U+017F>tyl'd, when they have no manife<U+017F>t qualities proper again<U+017F>t an Ague. The Que<U+017F>tion therefore is, Whether <U+017F>uch Applications, Su<U+017F>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions, and Wearings, have any Natural Effect; I conceive, they
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:66371:141"/>
have not. For a Natural Action requires not only <U+017F>ome Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical or Phy<U+017F>ical Contact, but al<U+017F>o a proportion between the Cau<U+017F>e and its Effect. Now what proportion can there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Prayer or other Speech (mo<U+017F>t commonly in<U+017F>ignificative) and the Cure of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, much le<U+017F>s between a little Ticket, or other <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended Body; and an Ague? what is <U+017F>aid of the weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>alve, being either fabulous or diabolical, and alwayes <U+017F>uper<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; as the Phylacteries of the Jews were. Although this Error is <U+017F>o ancient that the Greek <hi>Athletae</hi> were wont to arm them<U+017F>elves with <U+017F>uch things again<U+017F>t <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s, of which trifles, their Adver<U+017F>aries al<U+017F>o made u<U+017F>e to overcome them in Wra<U+017F>tling; and at this day, <U+017F>ome wear certain Chracters about them, that they may win at play. In like manner, the Romans hung Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets about their Children's necks, which they call'd <hi>Praefifcini,</hi> and <hi>Fa<U+017F>cini,</hi> and made of Jet; as the Spaniards make them at pre<U+017F>ent. To which, to attribute any power upon the account of their Form, Number, or other regard be<U+017F>ide their Matter, is an Error as great in Philo<U+017F>ophy, as it would be impiety and contempt of the Church to extend his conclu<U+017F>ion to <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, Reliques, and other <U+017F>acred things, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>o continual Effect cannot be que<U+017F>tion'd but by the prophane and heretical.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That by the Doctrine lately publi<U+017F>h'd in the Treati<U+017F>e of <hi>Tali<U+017F>mans,</hi> it appears, that not only Matter, but al<U+017F>o Figure, Number, and other corre<U+017F>pondences with the Cele<U+017F>tial Bodies have <U+017F>ome efficacy; which to que<U+017F>tion, becau<U+017F>e we know not the manife<U+017F>t Cau<U+017F>e, would be too great pre<U+017F>umption. Yea, I would not call all <U+017F>uch Effects Supernatural, <U+017F>ince there are <U+017F>o many things fea<U+017F>ible, whereof we know not the Cau<U+017F>e. And as to the Supernatural Effects of Amulets, they are of two <U+017F>orts: For either they are perform'd by the favour and ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing of God, who redoubles, yea, heightens to a <U+017F>eemingly unpo<U+017F><U+017F>ible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the Effects of Natural Cau<U+017F>es, or el<U+017F>e changes them: Or they are effected by help of the Evil Spirit, who is the Ape of Divine Actions. As then, in con<U+017F>equence of the Sacraments, God's Graces are conferr'd upon Chri<U+017F>tians, <U+017F>o the Devil agrees with the Sorcerer or Magician, that as often as he <U+017F>hall make <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ign, or <U+017F>peak <U+017F>uch a word, <U+017F>uch an Effect <U+017F>hall follow; whence 'tis no wonder if the Devil, though inclin'd <U+017F>olely to Evil, <U+017F>ometimes does good, as healing a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e by applying true Natural Agents to Patients, thereby to accu<U+017F>tom the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer to give credit to his words. Thus an Italian having <U+017F>old a familiar Spirit, bethought him<U+017F>elf to put a great Spider in a box, and yet he that bought it found the <U+017F>ame u<U+017F>e and benefit of it which he de<U+017F>ir'd.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That without recurring to good or bad Angels, who<U+017F>e powerful Effects cannot be que<U+017F>tion'd but by Mi<U+017F>creants, we find <U+017F>omething in the ordinary cour<U+017F>e of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things that makes for Amulets, the Antiquity whereof is te<U+017F>tifi'd by that <U+017F>aying of a Roman, who being <U+017F>ick, and a<U+017F>k'd
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:66371:142"/>
how he did, an<U+017F>wer'd his Friend, thus: You may <U+017F>ee how ill I am by this Ticket, which I have <U+017F>uffer'd to be put about my Neck: intimating that he mu<U+017F>t needs be very <U+017F>ick to <U+017F>uffer it, <U+017F>ince he gave no credit to it. And yet Confidence is a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary condition for the making Amulets efficacious. For as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s oftentimes makes people <U+017F>ick indeed; <U+017F>o an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they <U+017F>hall be cur'd by <U+017F>uch an Action, Writing, or Word, is capable to work a Cure in tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e Minds have great power over their Bodies: Which Opinion, being founded only upon the Word, Writing, or the applying of an Herb to the Patient's Wri<U+017F>t, or other <U+017F>uch Conceipt, the <U+017F>ame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be term'd other than an Amulet. Be<U+017F>ides, 'twere a great ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s to conclude, that there is no Connexion or nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Con<U+017F>equence between Words and Effects; <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>ame is found by Experience: And Words are the <U+017F>ignes and images of things, and con<U+017F>equently, have <U+017F>ome proportion between them. Whence po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, they that hunt the Hyaena cry continually, I do not <U+017F>ee her, till <U+017F>he be enter'd into the toil, which <U+017F>he doth boldly upon Confidence of that Speech; and when they cry, I do <U+017F>ee her, <U+017F>he endeavors to fly and get out of the Net, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangles her <U+017F>elf further therein: And in old time Gardners curs'd Par<U+017F>ley as they <U+017F>ow'd it, to make it <U+017F>pring up the <U+017F>ooner. Hence al<U+017F>o the very naming of filthy things, e<U+017F>pecially when we are eating, turns our Stomacks; and the mention of heinous Crimes makes us frown. And le<U+017F>t this <U+017F>hould be attributed to Phan<U+017F>ie alone, which is prov'd before not to be active, but only cogno<U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, we find that Serpents are charmed by words; and <hi>He<U+017F>iod</hi> hath a Ver<U+017F>e to drive away <hi>Cantharides</hi>; and Shepherds affirm, that according to the diver<U+017F>ity of certain Words, breeding Mares bring forth either Males or Females.</p>

            <p>THe Ignorance of the Definition of Love, <U+017F>eems to have occa<U+017F>ion'd this Que<U+017F>tion. For <U+017F>ince the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd only by the various apprehen<U+017F>ion of Good and Evil; Hope, re<U+017F>pecting good ab<U+017F>ent; Love, that which is pre<U+017F>ent; (whence 'tis <U+017F>eldom without <U+017F>ome inward joy, and Lovers would not be freed from their Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, though they complain of it) to que<U+017F>tion, Whether we love what we po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s, is to que<U+017F>tion, Whether Love be Love. Be<U+017F>ides, Love being not of things unknown, it follows that the more we know, the more we love that which is amiable (as we do by po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ing it) for we cannot judge of that which we po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s not, but by the report of others, which is commonly lyable to fallacy, according to the <U+017F>everal intere<U+017F>ts of the Reporters: Which will appear better by the

compari<U+017F>on of one that prefers a Picture before what it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ents. For what proportion there is between the Picture of a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s her <U+017F>elf; the <U+017F>ame is found between <U+017F>uch Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he permits her Servant no privacy, and her <U+017F>elf when <U+017F>he is married to him; the Actions of the one being but the <U+017F>hadow and Picture of tho<U+017F>e of the other, which are di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd in their <U+017F>implicity by fruition. We may <U+017F>ay therefore, that the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion before Enjoyment, is De<U+017F>ire; but Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion alone is capable to produce true Love. Be<U+017F>ides, the perfection of each thing compleats it, and places it in its highe<U+017F>t point, in<U+017F>tead of de<U+017F>troying it; <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e Enjoyment, which is the perfection of Love, and the <U+017F>ole Butt it aims at, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui<U+017F>h it. As one delightful meal may appea<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ent hunger, but with-all it incites us rather to de<U+017F>ire another than to di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t it.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, Did we not conver<U+017F>e with things altogether imperfect, Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion would encrea<U+017F>e Love, becau<U+017F>e it would <U+017F>ee new perfections in the thing belov'd: But on the contrary, common Experience teaches us the imperfection of what, before Enjoyment, we accounted highly of; and <U+017F>o our Love of it comes to be dimini<U+017F>h'd. Be<U+017F>ides, difficult things being the faire<U+017F>t, and contrarily brave things, who<U+017F>e acqui<U+017F>ition is ea<U+017F>ie, contemn'd, (witne<U+017F>s the Orders of Knight-hood and other Honors, which have been made rare, only that they might be the more amiable) it follows that we le<U+017F>s love what we have in our power, than what we have not; Humane weakne<U+017F>s being <U+017F>oon weary of every thing, and naturally carry'd to change: But we cannot be weary of things not in our power, and, con<U+017F>equently, we mu<U+017F>t e<U+017F>teem them more than what we po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s, the familiarne<U+017F>s whereof, is apt to breed Contempt of it in us: Be<U+017F>ides that, the Mind is prone to <U+017F>eek what it wants, and to e<U+017F>teem the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of another above its own. Thus the Ox would fain gallop like the Hor<U+017F>e, who on the other <U+017F>ide envies his labour at the Plough; and every one takes more plea<U+017F>ure in <U+017F>peaking of what he lea<U+017F>t under<U+017F>tands, and about the profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of others, than about his own. Yea, Experience <U+017F>hews us, that Lovers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linqui<U+017F>h both the thing and name of Servants, as <U+017F>oon as they are marry'd. Whence a late Poet <U+017F>peaking of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid, He knew no way to moderate the exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive Love he had for her, but by marrying her.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That true Love mu<U+017F>t be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd from fal<U+017F>e; this latter decre<U+017F>ing by fruition, whereas the former is encreas'd by it; as al<U+017F>o we mu<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h of Subjects that are lov'd. Tho<U+017F>e that de<U+017F>erve not to be <U+017F>o, are like coar<U+017F>e Pictures which require to be beheld at a di<U+017F>tance and in a certain <U+017F>tation, becau<U+017F>e neerne<U+017F>s di<U+017F>covers their defects; whereas the nearer an excellent and well drawn piece is beheld, the more it is e<U+017F>teem'd. Be<U+017F>ides, a difference mu<U+017F>t be made between what is practis'd and what ought to be practis'd. The defects of the per<U+017F>on lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:66371:143"/>
are not to be imputed to the thing loved; and therefore the Que<U+017F>tion <U+017F>hould not be whether Enjoyment dimini<U+017F>hes, but whether it ought to dimini<U+017F>h Love; as indeed it neither ought nor doth in things truly amiable; for the more they are known, the more they endear them<U+017F>elves. As therefore the more the Sun ripens a Grape, the <U+017F>weeter it is: and yet one in a Fever thinks it bitter and prefers Verjuice before it; which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s, makes us not conclude Verjuice the <U+017F>weeter of the two: So the di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t of a Lover is not to be imputed to the thing lov'd, but is indeed an argument of his own imperfection.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, If the diminution of Love upon enjoyment were a <U+017F>ign of weakne<U+017F>s of judgment, Women would not be (as they are) more con<U+017F>tant then Men after the <U+017F>ame: as we <U+017F>ee, more Men de<U+017F>ert the Love of Women, then on the contrary. Witne<U+017F>s the <U+017F>tory of <hi>Demophoon</hi> after enjoyment of the King of <hi>Thrace</hi>'s Daughter, who fell into de<U+017F>pair upon his departure, as <hi>Medea</hi> did upon that of <hi>Ja<U+017F>on,</hi> and <hi>Dido</hi> upon that of her <hi>Aeneas.</hi> The cau<U+017F>e whereof <U+017F>eems not imputable to feminine Pudor, as if having yielded them<U+017F>elves to one man they could not keep their honour unle<U+017F>s they keep their affection: but the rea<U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F>e Men are more perfect then Women and find more cau<U+017F>es in them for change. Yet I conceive that the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or diminution of Love ari<U+017F>eth not from enjoyment; as appears by Friend<U+017F>hip, which is contracted only after long conver<U+017F>e, and the eating of many bu<U+017F>hels of Salt together (as the Proverb <U+017F>peaks) <U+017F>o far is a thorough knowledg, <U+017F>uch as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment gives us, from dimini<U+017F>hing it. Not to mention the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of many married couples, who if occa<U+017F>ion were offer'd, would not <U+017F>tick to imitate the noble contention of <hi>Gracchus</hi> and <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and chu<U+017F>e to dye one for the other.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That if Fruition dimini<U+017F>hes Love, it mu<U+017F>t be the fault either of the Lover, or the thing lov'd. Not the fir<U+017F>t; for he is always the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on, and fruition renders his object more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, and con<U+017F>equently more amiable to him. Nor the latter; <U+017F>ince the very imperfections of the thing lov'd <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o many perfections to him that loves it,
<q>Balbinumque <U+017F>uae delectat polypus Agnae.</q>
Thus al<U+017F>o the imperfections of Children dimini<U+017F>h not their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents love, but by the help of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion augment the <U+017F>ame; Grandfathers commonly love their Childrens Children more tenderly then their own; and among<U+017F>t their own, the younge<U+017F>t. Which holds not only in this kind of work, but in all others; bad Painters having no le<U+017F>s kindne<U+017F>s for their own pieces then <hi>Apelles</hi> could have for his.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That the Que<U+017F>tion may be determin'd by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing the <U+017F>orts of Love. Impetuous Love, <U+017F>uch as is found in Youth and the Poets de<U+017F>cribe, <U+017F>wells (like Torrents)
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:66371:143"/>
by re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and langui<U+017F>hes by liberty. Regular and <U+017F>ober Love, <U+017F>uch as is found in ripe years, towards de<U+017F>erving <U+017F>ubjects, and e<U+017F>pecially divine things, encrea<U+017F>es (like Rivers) by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of new Notions, as <U+017F>o many new Springs, till it end in a boundle<U+017F>s Ocean. Either <U+017F>ort receives augmentation or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution according to the diver<U+017F>ity of the minds affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; the weak, as le<U+017F>s capable of under<U+017F>tanding the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of this impetuous pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, (which ma<U+017F>tering all the re<U+017F>t, deprives them of the u<U+017F>e of Rea<U+017F>on, and renders them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to other actions of life) continue longer before they come to them<U+017F>elves and quit this trouble. Hence Women, and of them the lea<U+017F>t judicious, are conceiv'd to retain this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion longe<U+017F>t, even after po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of what they lov'd. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happens in the other love, wherein the more we enjoy, the more we are enflam'd to further pur<U+017F>utes of knowledg.</p>

            <p>NOne doubts but there are <U+017F>till things to be known, and con<U+017F>equently Sciences to be attained. But if we will <U+017F>tand to the wi<U+017F>eman's <U+017F>entence, That all known Sciences are vanity (that is to <U+017F>ay, Nothing), the Que<U+017F>tion will <U+017F>oon be voided, there being no compari<U+017F>on between Nothing and Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Moreover, there being no Science without Demon<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and very few or no Demon<U+017F>trations in any Di<U+017F>cipline, which them<U+017F>elves are founded upon Principles not demon<U+017F>trable, which neverthele<U+017F>s ought to be known; it follows that there is no Science, and that we know but one thing with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> to wit, That we know nothing. And <hi>Pyrrho</hi> went further; not allowing that men know them<U+017F>elves ignorant, but that they mu<U+017F>t be contented to doubt of it, yea and to doubt of their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doubting. Accordingly we <U+017F>ee that no rea<U+017F>on is ever <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong but <U+017F>ome other may be found that thwarts it; and in all Di<U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>killful are the mo<U+017F>t unre<U+017F>olv'd and furthe<U+017F>t from that Schola<U+017F>tick temerity; which boa<U+017F>ts of knowing every thing, and never doubts of any thing; like tho<U+017F>e young Captains that make head upon every occa<U+017F>ion, whereas your veterans are more <U+017F>ober. So likewi<U+017F>e the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>killful Phy<U+017F>icians are always lea<U+017F>t ha<U+017F>ty in their Judgments and Pre<U+017F>criptions; and Lawyers the more practi<U+017F>e and experience they have, the more contrary pre<U+017F>idents they find in the <U+017F>ame ca<U+017F>e. If you a<U+017F>cend to Divinity there you will find more ignorance than any where el<U+017F>e; yea Ignorance is the fir<U+017F>t degree, and one of the conditions requir'd

to it, which was the rea<U+017F>on why S. <hi>Paul</hi> <U+017F>o much blames Philo<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and our Lord cho<U+017F>e the <U+017F>imple<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t ignorant, <U+017F>uch as poor Fi<U+017F>hers, not Doctors of the Law nor Scribes and Phari<U+017F>ees, who were the mo<U+017F>t learned of his Country. And at this day when matters of Religion <U+017F>eem mo<U+017F>t refin'd, there's none <U+017F>o ra<U+017F>h but acknowledges that one <U+017F>ingle moment of the Vi<U+017F>ion of God gives more knowledg then the whole <hi>Sorbonne</hi> hath, and that there is no more compari<U+017F>on between what all the men of the world together know of God, and what Beatitude will teach of him, then there is between finite and infinite, that is, none at all. Whereby it appears that the knowledg of men is infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by what they ignore. I <U+017F>hall in<U+017F>tance further in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Arts, wherein if you compare the things our Artificers are ignorant of with tho<U+017F>e they know, the mo<U+017F>t excellent among<U+017F>t them will confe<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf very un<U+017F>kilful and ignorant; whereof the <U+017F>ole ancient Inventions now lo<U+017F>t may <U+017F>erve for a proof. For in <U+017F>ome Roman Monuments lately di<U+017F>cover'd there have been found Lamps which burnt twelve or fifteen hundred years, and were not extingui<U+017F>h'd but upon letting in of the Air; particularly in the Tomb of <hi>Tullia Cicero</hi>'s Daughter at <hi>Padua.</hi> The invention of a perpetual Motion which animated <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> Sphear, dy'd with him; that of malleable Gla<U+017F>s, with its Inventor, who was wretchedly <U+017F>lain by <hi>Tiberius</hi>; that of melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stones or making artificial ones, or at lea<U+017F>t of tran<U+017F>porting and managing them, whereby the Romans built tho<U+017F>e great Piles of Amphitheaters, and other Works inimitable by us, is not known at this day; yea, to go no further, the goodne<U+017F>s of building with mo<U+017F>t of the materials of the Ancients is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>h'd with them. So that 'tis no wonder that at this day many of their Hi<U+017F>tories are accounted Fables; <U+017F>uch as the teaching of an Elephant to Dance upon the Rope, which <hi>Suetonius</hi> affirms was <U+017F>een in a Spectacle given to the Roman People; the care and indu<U+017F>try of Men being much dimini<U+017F>h'd in this lee of times, wherein they de<U+017F>ire to obtain every thing without pains. For the new Inventions of later Ages, as the Compa<U+017F>s, Guns, Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Tele<U+017F>copes, and <U+017F>ome others, were before Chance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them, or at lea<U+017F>t gave <U+017F>ome hints to their Inventors, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect of us in the <U+017F>ame Nothing wherein are all other po<U+017F><U+017F>ible things not yet effected. So that 'tis ea<U+017F>ie to conceive that there are infinite <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ecrets, or more excellent (as the Philo<U+017F>opher's Stone, the Quadrature of the Circle, the Fountain without end, and many other things whereof we have only confus'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) which he that <U+017F>hould know would be as much higher then all other men, as the Intelligences are above them. For Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, whether good or bad produce none of their Marvels but by this Science of things to us unknown; whence we oft-times term that miraculous which is purely natural. As may appear by the few Secrets found in the hands of men, which make them admir'd by all others, and anciently advanc'd them to the rank of Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:66371:144"/>The Second <U+017F>aid, This Opinion (that what we ignore is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then what we know) is founded upon the maligne envious nature of <U+017F>ome who <U+017F>light what is their own, and e<U+017F>teem only what is anothers, meerly becau<U+017F>e they want it: as tho<U+017F>e that a<U+017F>cend up a Ladder, trample on the <U+017F>tep that upholds them, <U+017F>till a<U+017F>piring to that which is above them, but only to trample on it al<U+017F>o next. So he that knows not <U+017F>ome new thing, de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>es all he knows already, to learn it; and having learn'd it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pi<U+017F>es it al<U+017F>o. For 'tis likely our fir<U+017F>t Parents who had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things, pre<U+017F>erv'd the memory of what de<U+017F>erv'd it be<U+017F>t; yea, that for <U+017F>o many Ages as the World hath la<U+017F>ted, men have retain'd the mo<U+017F>t profitable Sciences and Inventions that Art or Chance hath taught them. If they have let <U+017F>ome be lo<U+017F>t, 'tis becau<U+017F>e they found them unprofitable. And as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> <U+017F>aith, we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee nothing in the future but what hath been already: Should the World la<U+017F>t as long again as it hath done, it would be but a continual repetition of the <U+017F>ame things. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is <U+017F>poken, but it hath been <U+017F>poken formerly. The terms of all Sciences have been <U+017F>o often mixt, that as few or no new words are produc'd in any Language, <U+017F>o there cannot be many productions of Wit but what are repetitions of old ones, cloth'd in a new mode. For, to in<U+017F>tance in the Liberal Sciences; is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to Read, Write, and Speak either in Pro<U+017F>e or Ver<U+017F>e bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then men do at pre<U+017F>ent? Can the Demon<U+017F>trations of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks become more certain by time then they are now? Will it be more true to morrow then 'tis to day, that the whole is bigger then its part? Have the Chymi<U+017F>ts and other pretended reformers of Phy<U+017F>ick, <U+017F>ucceeded better then others? Can the Laws be better under<U+017F>tood then they are? And for Divinity; is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to know more of it in this world then is known at pre<U+017F>ent? whil<U+017F>t experience teaches us that the multitude of Books doth not le<U+017F>s perplex then profit us, both in this and all other Sciences? But, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e this old Errour had <U+017F>ome likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to examine the certainty of it we mu<U+017F>t compare what we know with what we ignore; becau<U+017F>e both the terms of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion <U+017F>ought, ought to be known. Now we are con<U+017F>cious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of what we know, but it implies a contradiction that we <U+017F>hould know what we know not. Wherefore if we <U+017F>hould quit the Sciences and Arts known and practis'd by men for what we know not, we <U+017F>hould have the <U+017F>ame fortune with <hi>Ae<U+017F>op</hi>'s Dog, who let go his mor<U+017F>el of fle<U+017F>h for the <U+017F>hadow of it which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd greater in the water, where indeed there was nothing at all. The truth is, tho<U+017F>e that have employ'd mo<U+017F>t time, labour, and money in the <U+017F>earch of Secrets, confe<U+017F>s that they have met with nothing but <U+017F>moak.

            <p>OUr Soul being a proportion, loves what partakes thereof; whence the Rules of Architecture ill-ob<U+017F>erv'd, and the Ge<U+017F>tures of Clowns di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e the Eye, and di<U+017F>orderly <U+017F>ounds hurt the Ear. For though there is proportion in the Sen<U+017F>es of Touching, Smelling, and Ta<U+017F>ting (which is the rea<U+017F>on why cold hands are <U+017F>o pained upon immediately approaching a hot Fire; and moderate <U+017F>mells and relli<U+017F>hes plea<U+017F>e us better then exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive) yet onely two <U+017F>en<U+017F>es are well capable of judging of this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; namely, the <U+017F>ight, and the hearing. And the <U+017F>ame re<U+017F>pect that there is between Beauty and Deformity, in reference to the Sight, is found al<U+017F>o between Harmony and Di<U+017F>cord in regard of the Hearing. Wherefore Mu<U+017F>ick being the Art of Harmony, they who love it not, are as extravagant as they that make no difference between a fair and an ugly face, proportion being the chief difference of both. Hence <U+017F>ome are not contented to account this Art as a Rule and Touch<U+017F>tone whereby to di<U+017F>cern well temper'd <U+017F>pirits from others, but have ventur'd to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert the hatred thereof a mark of reprobation. Moreover, the mo<U+017F>t an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Conte<U+017F>ts, were about the prerogative of Mu<U+017F>ick, every one pretending to be ma<U+017F>ter thereof.

            <p>AS Fruitfulne<U+017F>s is a power whereby every living thing is able to produce its like, <U+017F>o Barrenne<U+017F>s is an impotence in it to re-produce is <U+017F>elf by the way of Generation; by means whereof mortal individuals acquire immortality in their Species: to which purpo<U+017F>e nature hath furni<U+017F>h'd every one with nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Organs. The generation of perfect Animals requires three things; diver<U+017F>ity of Sex; matter or <U+017F>eed, which flows from both Male and Female, and contains in it <U+017F>elf the Idea and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the parts from which it i<U+017F><U+017F>ues; and la<U+017F>tly, conjunction of both together, without which nothing is produc'd. And though the defect of Generation may be <U+017F>ometimes on the mans part as well as on the womans; yet <U+017F>he is more <U+017F>ubject to <U+017F>terili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is an impotence proper to a woman, who, after the knowledge of a man in an age and time convenient, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. For tho<U+017F>e that conceive not after the 50th. year, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 12th. are not term'd barren: Conceptions beyond the former, or before the latter term, being <U+017F>upernatural or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; as tho<U+017F>e of the Manandri and Calingi, and that of one mention'd by <hi>Savonarola,</hi> whom he <U+017F>aw big with Childe at nine years of Age; as al<U+017F>o the miraculous conception of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> after <U+017F>he was <U+017F>eventy years old. The cau<U+017F>e of Barrenne<U+017F>s is a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd by <U+017F>ome to the di<U+017F>proportion between the <U+017F>eeds; whence <U+017F>he that is barren with her fir<U+017F>t Husband, is fruitful with her <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Tho<U+017F>e of the woman are either internal or external. The internal depend partly upon the <U+017F>eed and men<U+017F>trual Blood, and partly upon the temper of the Womb, and the habit of the body. The <U+017F>eed of a woman, as well as that of man, mu<U+017F>t be of a laudable temper, quantity, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, and provided of <U+017F>pirits enough. If the maternal blood, which concurs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e to generation, be too plentiful or too little, no effect follows, any more then if it were corrupted or wanted other requi<U+017F>ite conditions, The Womb (which is like the <U+017F>oil to corn) may be hurt either in its temper, or its conformation, or in the <U+017F>olution of continuity; all which di<U+017F>orders hinder gravidation. As for the habit of body, we ob<U+017F>erve that fat women are barren, either
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:66371:147"/>
becau<U+017F>e the matter of Seed, which is the purer portion of the Blood, is turn'd into fat; or becau<U+017F>e the Epiploon of fat Women pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing upon the Orifice of the Womb, hinders the Seed from entring into the bottom of it. Nor are Women too lean fit for Children, by rea<U+017F>on of their dryne<U+017F>s, and the tenuity of their Womb, although they are far more fit than fat Women; but this leanne<U+017F>s is to be under<U+017F>tood of <U+017F>o great an extenuation, that it leavs the parts dedicated to Generation, de<U+017F>titute of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and due temperature. Neither are the very tall, or very low much fitter; but tho<U+017F>e that are of a moderate Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Stature, who<U+017F>e Brea<U+017F>ts are firm, and their lower parts larger than their upper. Now <U+017F>ince Conception is an Action proper to the Womb, which quickens the Genitures, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought rather to be <U+017F>aid the Cau<U+017F>e thereof than the Man, and (by the rea<U+017F>on of contraries) the Defect thereof mu<U+017F>t likewi<U+017F>e be charg'd upon her.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That to blame Women for being more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently barren than Men, is to deprive them of their chief Glory, which is Fruitfulne<U+017F>s. For Nature form'd them chiefly for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as the Conformation of their Bodies <U+017F>eems to prove, in which the parts <U+017F>erving to that purpo<U+017F>e, as the Womb and Brea<U+017F>ts, have direct communications not only between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, but al<U+017F>o with the noble<U+017F>t parts of the Body. Whence the Civilians reckon not Praegnation among<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding all its inconveniences) but, with Phy<U+017F>itians, as a <U+017F>ign of health and good di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition. Whereof <hi>

whereas anciently they were <U+017F>o populous, that Hi<U+017F>torians call'd the North the Shop of Men, and the Magazine of Nations.

And po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly, the rea<U+017F>on why the Hebrew Law oblig'd a Man to marry the Relict of his i<U+017F><U+017F>ule<U+017F>s Brother, was, becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>uppos'd the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to proceed from the Hu<U+017F>band, and not from the Wife; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e, why <U+017F>hould the Si<U+017F>ter of a Wife deceas'd with i<U+017F><U+017F>ue <U+017F>ucceed in her <U+017F>tead too? But this Sex is reckon'd alwayes fit for ingend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and, indeed, is ever ready for it (as the other is not); which is the rea<U+017F>on (as a late Lady <U+017F>aid) why Men make <U+017F>ute to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, rather than the<U+017F>e to them. Perhaps al<U+017F>o upon the <U+017F>ame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, barrenne<U+017F>s under the Old Law was accounted by Women <U+017F>o great a reproach; becau<U+017F>e being very rare, 'tis a kind of a mon<U+017F>trous thing in their Sex to be barren. Moreover, we hear many Women complain to the Judges, which is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cau<U+017F>es of unfruitfulne<U+017F>s.

            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That be<U+017F>ides the Internal Cau<U+017F>es of fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s and barrenne<U+017F>s, there are al<U+017F>o External ones which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Air, Dyet, Exerci<U+017F>es, Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and the abu<U+017F>e of the other things call'd Not-natural. The Air by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual alteration it cau<U+017F>eth in the Body, (which attracts the <U+017F>ame by Re<U+017F>piration and Tran<U+017F>piration) <U+017F>ometimes occa<U+017F>ioneth either fruitfulne<U+017F>s or <U+017F>terility, according to the variety of its Sub<U+017F>tance, Temper, and Qualities; two whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive Heat, and Cold, are great Enemies to Generation; the one melting; the other congealing the Humors; but the exce<U+017F>s of Heat lea<U+017F>t hinders it, e<U+017F>pecially in Women; the coldne<U+017F>s of who<U+017F>e Temper, is corrected by the warmth, and increas'd by the coldne<U+017F>s of the Air; whence they are more amorous in Summer than in Winter: Whereas the greater heat of Men is weakned by that of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and augmented by the coldne<U+017F>s of Winter; during which, therefore they are more prone to Love. So Dyet too, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes much to render our Bodies fruitful or barren, not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, but making them of the <U+017F>ame Temper with it <U+017F>elf. Thus the waters of <hi>Nilus</hi> are <U+017F>o fertile, that they make the Egyptian Women bring forth three or four Children at once, by rea<U+017F>on of the Salt-Nitre wherewith that River is impregnated; and, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chymi<U+017F>ts place the principle of Fecundity, becau<U+017F>e A<U+017F>hes and Earth depriv'd of their Nitre, produce nothing. But cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, even <U+017F>uch as have the Virtue to petrifie, render Women (e<U+017F>pecially) barren, as mo<U+017F>t Women in <hi>Spain</hi> are, through their frequent u<U+017F>e of Ice and cold waters; though <U+017F>ome lay the fault upon the rarity and tenuity of their Bodies, and the exce<U+017F>s of Heat; which al<U+017F>o is the rea<U+017F>on why the African and Southern
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:66371:148"/>
people are not <U+017F>o fruitful as tho<U+017F>e of the North. Dyet, hot and moi<U+017F>t, ea<U+017F>ie of dige<U+017F>tion, nutritive and full of good juice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth much to render Women fruitful. On the contrary, the frequent u<U+017F>e of food hot and dry, gro<U+017F>s, and of bad juice, may render them barren, as Leeks and Garlick do; and among<U+017F>t other Plants, Mint, which was therefore forbidden to be eaten, or planted in time of war; wherein 'tis needful to repair by Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity, the lo<U+017F>s of Men it cau<U+017F>eth. In like manner, want of Exerci<U+017F>e, by the heaping up of <U+017F>uperfluous Humors, and too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and continual Exerci<U+017F>es, by de<U+017F>iccating the parts, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>terility. Among<U+017F>t the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, Sadne<U+017F>s is the greate<U+017F>t Enemy to Generation; whence <hi>He<U+017F>iod</hi> forbids marry'd people to <U+017F>ee one another after a Funeral, but only at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Bath, or from places of Mirth. In fine, what ever is capable to impair the goodne<U+017F>s of the Temper, is contrary to Fruitfulne<U+017F>s and Generation, which above all other Natural Actions requires an exact harmony of the qualities, and a perfect di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the noble parts, which <U+017F>upply Matter and Spirits fit for this Action. And although Men and Women are alike expos'd to External Cau<U+017F>es, yet Women being le<U+017F>s vigorous, are <U+017F>ooner wrought upon by them. For, to Internal Cau<U+017F>es, which are the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable, Women are, undoubtedly, more <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; <U+017F>ince be<U+017F>ide Seed, which they <U+017F>upply as well as Man, (who to de<U+017F>erve the name of fruitful, ought only to <U+017F>upply the <U+017F>ame in requi<U+017F>ite quantity, quality, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, and place it in convenient Recepticles) the Woman mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o afford Blood, and al<U+017F>o a place for receiving and pre<U+017F>erving both the Seeds and Blood, namely, her Womb, the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is <U+017F>ufficient to marr the whole work of Generation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he contributes mo<U+017F>t to Generation, and there are more Cau<U+017F>es in her concurring thereunto; if it take not Effect, <U+017F>he is more in fault than the Man, who hath not <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the Cau<U+017F>es of <U+017F>terility being either Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Adventitious, and equal in the Man and the Woman, nothing can be determin'd upon this Que<U+017F>tion. For in either Sex, there are both univer<U+017F>al and particular deficiences of right Temper, and as many Effeminate Men as Viragoes, (the one not le<U+017F>s unfit for Generation than the other, as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> <U+017F>aith) Ca<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is practis'd in both, and di<U+017F>orderly living is equal as well in Male as Female in the<U+017F>e dayes. For if Men exceed in drinking, Maids and Women are as bad in Gluttony and Lickeri<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s. If there be any difference, 'tis from the diver<U+017F>ity of Climate; Women being found more fruitful in hot Countries, and le<U+017F>s in cold, but Men contrarily; the intemperies of either Sex being corrected by an oppo<U+017F>ite con<U+017F>titution of Air. Hence <U+017F>uch Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as have been long barren, <U+017F>ometimes become fruitful by change of Air, Places, manner of Life, and e<U+017F>pecially of Age, by which the temperament of the Body being <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly alter'd,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66371:148"/>
it acquires the Fruitfulne<U+017F>s it wanted, by acquiring the Qualities and Conditions nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to Generation. Many likewi<U+017F>e upon the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, become fuitful after the u<U+017F>e of Mineral Waters or Baths, and being thereby deliver'd from <U+017F>everal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, to which barren Women are more <U+017F>ubject than <U+017F>uch as have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom Parturition rids of abundance of Excrements peculiar to that Sex, and occa<U+017F>ioning many di<U+017F>orders in the barren.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the ob<U+017F>ervation made by <hi>Bodin</hi> in his Republick, and <U+017F>everal other famous Authors, [that the number of Women much exceeds that of Men] <U+017F>eems to void the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion; Nature having thereby <U+017F>ufficiently given us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand, That fewer men are as fruitful as more women. Which ob<U+017F>ervation is verifi'd, not only in the Ea<U+017F>t and other Countries, where plurality of Wives hath places; but al<U+017F>o in <hi>France,</hi> where there is no Province wherein Virgins remain not unmarry'd for want of Hu<U+017F>bands. Moreover, one man may beget abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Children in the <U+017F>pace of nine moneths, during which a woman breeds but one or two; and therefore Man <U+017F>eems more fruitful then Woman, who beginning to be capable of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but two years before Man doth (<hi>viz.</hi> at 12 years old at the <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t) ends 23 years <U+017F>ooner then he; for men generate at 70 years of age and more, but women end at 50. During which time al<U+017F>o they are <U+017F>ubject to far more infirmities and maladies than men; who have not above four or five, whereof women are not capable; but women have fifty or three<U+017F>core peculiar to them<U+017F>elves.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXVIII. Whether Complai<U+017F>ance proceeds from Magnanimity or Poorne<U+017F>s of Spirit.</head>
            <p>COmplai<U+017F>ance is a habit oppo<U+017F>ite to Roughne<U+017F>s; the fir<U+017F>t being a Species of Civility, the latter of Ru<U+017F>ticity. Now <U+017F>ince we are complai<U+017F>ant either in good or bad things, to be <U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t be commendable or blameable according to the nature of the object. But becau<U+017F>e no body doubts that we ought to be complai<U+017F>ant in vertuous actions, and that they are as culpable who connive at vice as they that commit it; It remains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider of Complai<U+017F>ance in indifferent things, as 'tis in common practi<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t men; and as <hi>Juvenal</hi> repre<U+017F>ents it in a per<U+017F>on that falls a weeping as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>ees his friends tears, and when he <U+017F>miles laughs aloud; and if you <U+017F>ay, you are very hot, he <U+017F>weats; if cold, he runs to his Fur-gown. Now the Que<U+017F>tion is, whether <U+017F>uch a man hath more of courage or ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s, I conceive he <U+017F>hews him<U+017F>elf a very pitiful fellow. For this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:66371:149"/>
differs not from that <U+017F>ervile Vice, Flattery, which is near akin to Lying, and ea<U+017F>ily turns from an indifferent to a vicious action. Thus Courtiers varni<U+017F>h vices with the name of <U+017F>uch vertues as have mo<U+017F>t conformity therewith, calling Avarice, Frugality; La<U+017F>civiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, Love; Ob<U+017F>tinacy, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy; and <U+017F>o in other ca<U+017F>es, till they render them<U+017F>elves ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous even to tho<U+017F>e they prai<U+017F>e; who how vain <U+017F>oever they may be, yet cannot hear their own prai<U+017F>es without blu<U+017F>hing at them, being con<U+017F>cious that they di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e all the hearers. Indeed when I am complai<U+017F>ant to any one, 'tis for fear to offend him; and fear was never an effect of Magnanimity. To which all that can be excepted, is that it belongs al<U+017F>o to Prudence to fear formidable things. But Fortitude and Courage are never employ'd in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti<U+017F>e of this vertue, which therefore is very much <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, and oft-times <U+017F>erves for an excu<U+017F>e of cowardice. Hence old men, whom their cold blood makes le<U+017F>s courageous, are e<U+017F>teem'd the mo<U+017F>t prudent; and if they be not the mo<U+017F>t complai<U+017F>ant, 'tis to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the <U+017F>ullenne<U+017F>s attending that age, as jollity doth youth. Moreover, as Courage leads us to act without fear of danger what we conceive good and ju<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o it teaches us to call things by their proper names, as <hi>Philip</hi>'s Souldiers did. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Complai<U+017F>ance teaches people to admire beauty in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed woman, to commend a bad Poets Ver<U+017F>es, and de<U+017F>ire a copy of them from him; to give fair words to <U+017F>uch as we will not or cannot do any kindne<U+017F>s to; in brief, to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble all things and to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e our words, contrary to the frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s prohibition of God in holy Scripture, which calls it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a heart and a heart: <U+017F>o that no per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ound judgment can think <U+017F>uch demeanor con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with true Courage.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That there is as much difference between Ru<U+017F>ticity and Complai<U+017F>ance or Civility, as between a Bea<U+017F>t and a Man; the former leaving us to the guidance of our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Sen<U+017F>es, and to <U+017F>ay and do whatever they dictate to us; the latter over-ruling them by that power of Rea<U+017F>on, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conte<U+017F>t remains victorious over the body and <U+017F>en<U+017F>uality. A cholerick man <U+017F>uffering him<U+017F>elf to be tran<U+017F>ported by his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, utters whatever the violence thereof <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ts to him; whereas one of a more <U+017F>edate temper ma<U+017F>ters his anger, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he have as good rea<U+017F>on for it, and by this prudent action he reduces his friend <U+017F>tray'd out of the rode of rea<U+017F>on; as he that in<U+017F>tead of retorting the ill language his friend gave him, a<U+017F>k'd him what the Diamond upon his finger co<U+017F>t him. Which put the other into <U+017F>uch confu<U+017F>ion, that having an<U+017F>wer'd the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion, he ran to embrace him and a<U+017F>k'd his pardon. Whereby it appears how much more courage is requi<U+017F>ite to <U+017F>urmount ones <U+017F>elf thus, (which is an effect of Complai<U+017F>ance) then to obey the <U+017F>wing of choler, as vulgar people do: For Complai<U+017F>ance forces our nature and con<U+017F>trains us to <U+017F>peak, and do things contrary to our fir<U+017F>t inclinations, and con<U+017F>equently is of more difficulty then
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:66371:149"/>
'tis to obey them. <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates how one <hi>Telerus</hi> an<U+017F>wer'd his brother, who a<U+017F>k'd him how it came pa<U+017F>s that he was le<U+017F>s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd then him<U+017F>elf, who had been made one of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian <hi>Ephori,</hi> whereas he was treated with great contempt? The rea<U+017F>on is (<U+017F>aid he) becau<U+017F>e you are not complai<U+017F>ant, and cannot bear any injury. As therefore it requires greater courage to bear then to revenge an injury (as 'tis ob<U+017F>erv'd in the life of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who hindred his Scholars from revenging an affront which was done to him) <U+017F>o 'tis more difficult to be complai<U+017F>ant then rude. And as the <U+017F>ame Author <U+017F>aith, Complai<U+017F>ance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in <U+017F>peaking plea<U+017F>ing things, and in doing good offices; both which require a good re<U+017F>olute Spirit, for our Gallants fal<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly account it courage to run into the Field upon the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>lip of an ambiguous word: Which perver<U+017F>e phanta<U+017F>try hath co<U+017F>t many a brave mans life, who for want of not having attain'd to that high point of Magnanimity which teaches us not to place the point of Honor in every triflle, but only where it ought to be, have really lo<U+017F>t the life both of body and <U+017F>oul for an imaginary folly which carry'd them away with the torrent of the popular errour of this Age.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That we may as well place Continence in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous places, as reckon Complai<U+017F>ance an effect of Courage; the re<U+017F>pect being alike of both. For all the actions of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plai<U+017F>ant per<U+017F>on are <U+017F>o many marks not only of re<U+017F>pect, but al<U+017F>o of a <U+017F>ervile fear, <U+017F>uch as was that of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Courtiers, who held their necks awry and hung down their heads in imitation of their Ma<U+017F>ter, who was forc'd to do <U+017F>o by rea<U+017F>on of a wound; and tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Diony<U+017F>ius,</hi> who <U+017F>tumbled at every <U+017F>tep, becau<U+017F>e this Tyrant was pur-blind. So when <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>on begins a tedious old <U+017F>tory, I pray, who <U+017F>hews mo<U+017F>t courage, he that tells the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator 'tis an old one, or he that <U+017F>uffers him<U+017F>elf to be tir'd with it? Be<U+017F>ides, that there is nothing more dangerous then this Complai<U+017F>ance. Certainly a Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or that is complai<U+017F>ant to his Penitents, and a Preacher that is <U+017F>o to his Auditory, will damn both; and <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o a General that yields to every advice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts not <U+017F>uch as de<U+017F>erve it, will infallibly ruine his Army. A Phy<U+017F>itian of this temper, that to comply with his Patient nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bleeds nor purges him becau<U+017F>e of his unwillingne<U+017F>s there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, will be the cau<U+017F>e of his death; as the Apothecary dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hes the vertue of the Medicine whil<U+017F>t he <U+017F>trives to make it agreeable to the ta<U+017F>te, and a pitiful Surgeon makes the <U+017F>ore. A Lawyer that u<U+017F>es the <U+017F>ame cour<U+017F>e with his Client, thru<U+017F>ts him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many needle<U+017F>s and unhappy Sutes. In brief there is nothing <U+017F>o dangerous, nor which argues more weakne<U+017F>s then Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ance, which like too <U+017F>weet Sauces makes us nau<U+017F>eate it, and leaves us as far to <U+017F>eek for Coun<U+017F>el as before: Whereas plain and vigorous Coun<U+017F>el oftentimes <U+017F>aves the State from <U+017F>hipwreck.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, If you con<U+017F>ider all the kinds of Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ance,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66371:150"/>
they have need of con<U+017F>traint, which employs more force and courage then is requi<U+017F>ite for following ones inclination. Thus, he that is more thir<U+017F>ty then his neighbour and yet tenders the fir<U+017F>t gla<U+017F>s to him, does this violence to him<U+017F>elf out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plai<U+017F>ance, which likewi<U+017F>e obliges him to put his hand la<U+017F>t to the di<U+017F>h though his Stomack be never <U+017F>o <U+017F>harp; if he meet with an occa<U+017F>ion of anger, he only <U+017F>miles to him<U+017F>elf, and with di<U+017F><U+017F>imu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation gives the upper hand to his inferior. On the contrary, a rough-hewn per<U+017F>on had rather go to the Gallies then commend Ver<U+017F>es which to him <U+017F>eem not good, and (as <hi>Plato</hi> <U+017F>aid to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>) eat nothing ever but Coleworts, than comply with the Ceremonies and Modes of great per<U+017F>ons. Thus he that <U+017F>pares his di<U+017F>armed enemy, <U+017F>hows greater courage then if, leaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf to be guided of his hatred, he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>lay him, which yet is no more then a te<U+017F>timony of his having overcome him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in <U+017F>paring him he overcomes him<U+017F>elf, which is the greate<U+017F>t victory a man can obtain. To conclude, Prai<U+017F>e is the reward of Vertue, and becau<U+017F>e it follows complai<U+017F>ence, as <U+017F>corn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt doth ru<U+017F>tick opiniona<U+017F>try: this is an evident <U+017F>ign that the latter is le<U+017F>s vertuous becau<U+017F>e le<U+017F>s commendable then the other.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXIX. Touching the means of re-e<U+017F>tabling Commerce.</head>
            <p>MAn being born <U+017F>ociable, and <U+017F>ociety not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible without Commerce, the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>eemeth one of the main Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mankind, who are generally troubled, when the <U+017F>ame is either interrupted by War with <U+017F>trangers, or extingui<U+017F>h'd by the negligence of Natives; whereby it appears to be of two <U+017F>orts in general, <hi>viz.</hi> between tho<U+017F>e of one State, and with Strangers. Now this difference is <U+017F>o e<U+017F><U+017F>ential, that each of them hath its contrary Maxims. Forreign Trade is exercis'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by the truck or exchange of one Merchandize for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, (the tran<U+017F>portation of Gold and Silver being prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Laws of the State, as al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome Merchandizes, call'd Contre-band are) or in ca<U+017F>e the Forreign Merchants like not the permutation of commodities, they make their payment by Letters of Exchange, which was come to be taken up upon the prohibition of tran<U+017F>porting money. On the contrary, Natives of the <U+017F>ame Country commonly make all their Bargains for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, either ready or upon Credit till a <U+017F>et time. And as the Prince endeavours to promote and facilitate Trade among<U+017F>t his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for their accommodation, <U+017F>o he ought to be circum<U+017F>pect to hinder Strangers from carrying away the Materials, and (e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially unwrought) Commodities about which his own Subjects <U+017F>hould be employ'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:66371:150"/>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the dignity of Merchandize is prov'd from its Antiquity and Utility. As to the former, we read in Holy Writ of I<U+017F>maelite Merchants, who bought <hi>Jo<U+017F>eph</hi> as they were going from <hi>Galaad</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> to Trade; and in the Poets of <hi>Ja<U+017F>on,</hi> whom they feign to have voyag'd with his Ship <hi>Argos</hi> for conque<U+017F>t of the Golden Fleece, in<U+017F>inuating thereby that Travelling and Trading by Sea and Land is the way to grow rich. As to the latter, all Arts would be unprofitable to men without di<U+017F>tribution of their works, which is done by Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, whereby that becomes u<U+017F>eful and known in one place, which was u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s and unknown el<U+017F>ewhere; and the Proverb is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that every Land beareth not all things; <U+017F>ince a Countrey of Trade abounds with every thing, and the four parts of the world are brought together by Commerce. 'Tis Merchandize that enricheth States, all which acknowledge Money; which ari<U+017F>eth by it, the <U+017F>inew of War, and the key of all political En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes. 'Tis that which <U+017F>upplyes Princes with Metals, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, Marble, and other magnificences, whereby the <U+017F>plendor of their Per<U+017F>ons, Courts, and Palaces is advanc'd; and both in Peace and War 'tis the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t foundation for Impo<U+017F>itions, which maintain the expence of either. 'Tis that which <U+017F>upports the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities of Souldiers, and <U+017F>upplyes them with provi<U+017F>ions both for war and <U+017F>u<U+017F>tenance; whence among the Ea<U+017F>tern Nations, the Pedlers and Victuallers are the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable Officers of their numerous Armies. In <U+017F>hort, Commerce affords Lawyers the <U+017F>ubjects of their Pleadings, Sentences, and Arre<U+017F>ts; and not onely Sugar, Cinamon, Cloves, and other Spices for our Tables, but al<U+017F>o mo<U+017F>t Drugs for Phy<U+017F>ick, as Rhubarb, Agarick, Sena, Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ia, Tamarinds, Guaiacum, Mu<U+017F>k, Ambergreece, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is rare; be<U+017F>ides, Books to all the<U+017F>e Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions; and to God him<U+017F>elf, Incen<U+017F>e to perfume his Altars. Nor is this employment more profitable then delightful in reference to the variety of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, per<U+017F>ons, and things; a diverti<U+017F>ement which alone <U+017F>ufficeth to induce Travellers to adventure the dangers which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them. As for the dignity of it, I <U+017F>hall onely adde to what hath been <U+017F>aid in a former Conference concerning the <U+017F>ame, That they, who de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e Merchandizing as if it had <U+017F>omething of ba<U+017F>e and abject in it, are more worthy of pity for their gro<U+017F><U+017F>e error, then of an an<U+017F>wer. Do they know better wherein Dignity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts then tho<U+017F>e ancient Roman Senators, who fraighted and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd Trading Ships; the gain whereof was their be<U+017F>t revenue? and are <U+017F>o many other States and Republick ever the le<U+017F>s noble for Trading? Is there more honour in the idlene<U+017F>s of a half Gentleman, who for want of other employment u<U+017F>eth no other Trade in time of Peace but to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t one of his Neighbours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t another in a quarrel of his own making, then in the care and vigilance of a good Merchant which redounds to the benefit both of the publick and him<U+017F>elf. Be<U+017F>ides, the diligent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant rai<U+017F>es his Family, whereas the idle Gentleman de<U+017F>troyes
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:66371:151"/>
his; being driven at la<U+017F>t either to go in a pittiful garb, or el<U+017F>e to be cloath'd upon the credit the Merchant gives him. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis the duty of good Legi<U+017F>lators to countenance what is mo<U+017F>t profitable to the State, and on the contrary to depre<U+017F>s and expel whatever brings damage to the <U+017F>ame. Methinks 'twere fit <U+017F>ome new marks of e<U+017F>teem were added to the e<U+017F><U+017F>ential honour of Merchandizing; as either Titles of Honour or Priviledges, which would invite the mindes of our youth to that good em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, who are otherwi<U+017F>e apt to be drawn a<U+017F>ide by popular error to loo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s and debauchery, and thereby commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from the way their predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors trac'd out to them. Whence a Merchant that hath got a good e<U+017F>tate, in<U+017F>tead of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Son to <U+017F>ucceed his Credit, lets it fall, and puts him to <U+017F>ome new profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to which he was not born, as to the former.</p>
            <p>The Third alledg'd as an argument of the utility of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, that Cities de<U+017F>titute of it can neither increa<U+017F>e nor grow rich; whence the <U+017F>ub-divi<U+017F>ion made of the e<U+017F>tates of families <U+017F>oon impoveri<U+017F>hes the Citizens, unle<U+017F>s they <U+017F>upply that defect by their indu<U+017F>try, as many rich Nations do. Thus <hi>England</hi> was for a long time enrich'd by the free trade it enjoy'd with all the neighbouring States, who were at Wars one with another. Thus mo<U+017F>t States of <hi>Italy,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Venice, Genua,</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> have been augmented by Traffick. But no place more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>ets forth the excellent profit of Commerce then <hi>Holland,</hi> where, as their be<U+017F>t Authors acknowledge, and experience <U+017F>hews the countrey, which almo<U+017F>t their indu<U+017F>try alone hath made ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable, hath nothing but Trade and Commerce, whereby they have enricht it. For the Soil is not onely bad, as being almo<U+017F>t all Sandy; or all Mar<U+017F>hy, e<U+017F>pecially at <hi>Am<U+017F>terdam</hi>; the water is unwhole<U+017F>ome, and the Air thick and noxious; not to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Turffe firing, which fills the head with vapours. So that though they have all the elements contrary to them, yet they <U+017F>cruple not to di<U+017F>pute the Sovereignty with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> having made War upon him for four and twenty years together with more gain then lo<U+017F>s: which they could not have done without the great trea<U+017F>ures they draw from Commerce.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ince Trade con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in Negotiations, things <U+017F>old or exchang'd, and their value, the per<U+017F>ons mu<U+017F>t be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t that exerci<U+017F>e it, the Commodity under<U+017F>tood, and the price certain; otherwi<U+017F>e 'tis not Trafficking, but meer cheating; whence of all forms of Ju<U+017F>tice, none ought to be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious, and equitable, and con<U+017F>cientious then that concerning Merchandizing, which would be no le<U+017F>s ruin'd by fal<U+017F>e judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and long <U+017F>uits then by injury and open force. The way therefore to re-e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h Commerce is to re-e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h fair dealing, to remove frauds and <U+017F>ophi<U+017F>tication of commodities, whereby he, that thinks he buyes one thing, buyes another of wor<U+017F>e value; and above all, to fix and make immovable the <U+017F>tandard of current
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:66371:151"/>
money; for want whereof no man knows what he hath.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the fir<U+017F>t condition requi<U+017F>ite to Traffick, is the <U+017F>afety of wayes. The <U+017F>econd, that of payment, which is remitted to a <U+017F>et term. The Third, The capacity of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, which keeps him both from being deceived in the worth of Commodities, and in the <U+017F>orts of ready payment, though this kinde of payment be le<U+017F>s us'd among<U+017F>t whole <U+017F>ale Merchants, which is the true way of Merchandizing, that of Retail de<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the name le<U+017F>s, and being alwayes accounted more <U+017F>ordid. Moreover, 'tis the former that enricheth States, <U+017F>upplying what they want, and carrying abroad what they abound with. 'Tis the nur<U+017F>e of Arts and Manufactures, as appears in the Cities of <hi>Lions, Tours,</hi> and divers others, where <U+017F>ome one Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant employes three or four hundred Artificers in Silk, Wool, and other <U+017F>uch works. Among<U+017F>t which Merchants tho<U+017F>e that be<U+017F>t know how to practi<U+017F>e the Maxims of buying and <U+017F>elling cheaper then others, that is, who content them<U+017F>elves with lea<U+017F>t profit both in buying and <U+017F>elling, drive the greate<U+017F>t trade, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently thrive mo<U+017F>t: whereas they that endeavour to grow rich in a day, di<U+017F>credit them<U+017F>elves for the re<U+017F>t of their lives. I think al<U+017F>o 'twere fit to remedy the evil cu<U+017F>tom of <U+017F>ome who <U+017F>et <U+017F>o high a rate upon their Commodities, that they frighten tho<U+017F>e that otherwi<U+017F>e re<U+017F>olv'd to buy, or el<U+017F>e affront them with half the ju<U+017F>t price. And if after the manner of <U+017F>ome Countreys, the prices of all wares were regulated, much more would be vented, and the time taken up in bargaining would be employ'd in other parts of Traffick, be<U+017F>ides that, by this means we might <U+017F>end even any childe for any commodity whatever; in the con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <U+017F>et price and the a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of not overbuying would make make cu<U+017F>tomers buy the <U+017F>ooner, their fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation being concerning what money the thing will co<U+017F>t them: whereas now many forbear meerly out of <U+017F>hame to higgle and beat the bargain.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That indeed the <U+017F>ole wealth of a State is Traffick, there being onely two <U+017F>orts of goods, moveable and immoveable. The latter increa<U+017F>e and dimini<U+017F>h onely by War, which is trouble<U+017F>ome means and a kinde of game, wherein he that wins one time lo<U+017F>es another: whereas moveables are us'd and con<U+017F>um'd though they be of Iron: whence onely Traffick remains for increa<U+017F>e: but 'tis not <U+017F>ufficient to know the dignity and profit a thing brings; to put it well in practice, all its ob<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles mu<U+017F>t be remov'd; as in the fir<U+017F>t place the idlene<U+017F>s of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, which is natural to <U+017F>uch as live in a good Soil; whence the Proverb, <hi>Bona terra, Mala Gens.</hi> Yea, in <U+017F>ome people, as in the Iri<U+017F>h, 'tis contradicted by ill cu<U+017F>tom; for that people being nouri<U+017F>ht in <U+017F>loathfulne<U+017F>s, cho<U+017F>e rather to cover their whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with a Mantle, then take the pains to cut it into Cloathes. Secondly, the want of Materials and In<U+017F>truments proper for Trade, as Merchandizes, Ships, and other means: be<U+017F>ides the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66371:152"/>
defect of <U+017F>afe Ports. Thirdly, The danger of tran<U+017F>portation by rea<U+017F>on of Thieves at Land, and Pirates at Sea. Fourthly, the want of Companies, both for undertaking great negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and for a<U+017F><U+017F>urances, as 'tis in <hi>Holland</hi> and el<U+017F>ewhere, where they have found wayes to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure even the lives of per<U+017F>ons under good cautions. Fifthly, the fal<U+017F>e dealing of this age, directly oppo<U+017F>ite to the fair dealing of Merchants, which is incompatible with brangling. La<U+017F>tly, that great proce<U+017F>s not yet ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Dant<U+017F>ickers, about the impo<U+017F>t he would lay upon the Baltick Sea, <U+017F>hows apparently that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>itions al<U+017F>o are a notable hinderance of Trade: All which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tacles and inconveniences may be thus remedy'd in <hi>France.</hi> The fir<U+017F>t needs not much to be <U+017F>poken of, more French living by their indu<U+017F>try in Forreign Countries then Forreigners here, which is a certain evidence that our Nation is none of the <U+017F>loathfulle<U+017F>t. But 'twere to be wi<U+017F>ht that the Youth de<U+017F>ign'd to the hone<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci<U+017F>e of Merchandize were not le<U+017F>s careful to learn the Map and the Countrey, then our Gentry is <U+017F>o for the war. Nor do I think the Tongues, e<U+017F>pecially the Latin, le<U+017F>s nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for them then for Lawyers and Phy<U+017F>icians; <U+017F>ince the<U+017F>e may in ca<U+017F>e of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity learn their Art in their own mother Tongue: But Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants cannot make them<U+017F>elves under<U+017F>tood in <U+017F>trange Countreys but by the Latin Tongue, which <U+017F>erves to interpret all others; and for want of which 'tis in the power of an Interpreter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. Neither do we want wares that are both as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and as good as el<U+017F>ewhere, as Wheat, Wool, Hemp, and what ever is made thereof, as Cordage and Linen; Salt, Wood, and other <U+017F>uch things; much le<U+017F>s materials to build and equippe Ships: and we have the be<U+017F>t Havens of the world. The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Robbers and Pyrates is much more con<U+017F>iderable; but the former may be remedied in Cities, by an exact knowledg of all the Hou<U+017F>es in each Street; by many clear lights <U+017F>et toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which will co<U+017F>t le<U+017F>s then Lanthorns, whereof there is <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom any benefit; by a Night-Watch plac'd in each Street, and by other means to be mention'd in due place. In the Countrey it may be redre<U+017F>s'd, if Merchants Travel together in Caravans, and get the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Provo<U+017F>ts or Sheriffs, who are bound to <U+017F>ecure the High-Wayes, and as well by Land as by Sea, by the erection of Companies.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>eventh <U+017F>aid, That the only way indeed of improving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, is to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h Companies. For both Nature and Art teach us, that as heavy burthens cannot be mov'd by little <U+017F>trength; <U+017F>o Affairs of great importance, which need a great <U+017F>tock and attendance in <U+017F>everal places, cannot be manag'd by one <U+017F>ingle per<U+017F>on; who al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ufficeth not alone to remedy <U+017F>oon enough the inconveniences fore<U+017F>een and unfore<U+017F>een, which nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in all enterpri<U+017F>es. Whence the fir<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>s that befalls a <U+017F>olitary Merchant, dejects, and almo<U+017F>t breaks him, becau<U+017F>e he hath not where-with to recover him<U+017F>elf; whereas in Companies, a lo<U+017F>s is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:66371:152"/>
equally di<U+017F>tributed, and more ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>upported by all the A<U+017F><U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates; among<U+017F>t whom, if the timorou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of one propo<U+017F>es the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t means, the Courage and Experience brings a Temperament thereunto; and <U+017F>eeing every one contributes his coun<U+017F>el no le<U+017F>s than his endeavors in the common cau<U+017F>e, it is in the le<U+017F>s danger by rea<U+017F>on of the many that mind it. Moreover, Companies are be<U+017F>t able to <U+017F>olicite and procure the recovery of prizes unju<U+017F>tly taken at Sea, obtain Letters of Mart, and put them in execution. But as the<U+017F>e Companies are ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing States furni<U+017F>h us Examples thereof; <U+017F>o care mu<U+017F>t be taken that they do not degenerate into Monopolies, and <U+017F>et exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive prizes upon Commodities.</p>
            <p>The Eighth <U+017F>aid, That be<U+017F>ide what hath been remark'd, the conjunction of Rivers <U+017F>o frequently propos'd and not yet execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (through want of Spirits con<U+017F>tant enough to accompli<U+017F>h their de<U+017F>igns) would much facilitate Commerce; the tran<U+017F>port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Commodities <U+017F>ucking up the main of the profit, by rea<U+017F>on of the Exactions of Inns, which laugh at the regulated Rates of Provi<U+017F>ions, for want of an Eye to keep them up. All which might be remedied by an able Company, by appointing places of baiting and lodging for their Factors, to be kept by <U+017F>ome of the A<U+017F><U+017F>ociates, who being thereby intere<U+017F><U+017F>ed in <U+017F>ome portion of the profit, would look more narrowly to the <U+017F>ecurity of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; for want of which care, the mo<U+017F>t famous Me<U+017F><U+017F>engers are often rob'd. It would be of great u<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o to have good and certain Intelligence of the Affairs of the world in general, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the inclining to ruine, delays and failings of Bankrupts, who oftentimes break in one place whil<U+017F>t their Factors are taking up Commodities in others; as al<U+017F>o of the be<U+017F>ieging and taking of Cities by an Enemy, or their danger of being <U+017F>o; in which Ca<U+017F>e the Merchant will ha<U+017F>ten to with-draw his <U+017F>tock from thence, and hinder others from <U+017F>ending thither to trade; there being no Sympathy between War and Merchandize. But above all, in this Occurrence 'tis nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for him to know the certain prizes of the Commodity he intends to deal in: Which hath gain'd great Credit to this A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, by the printed Bills it hath <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>ent abroad, containing the currant prizes of all Wares for every week, in imitation of the City of <hi>Am<U+017F>terdam.</hi> For by this means, the Merchant needs only di<U+017F>count the charges of tran<U+017F>portation, and make a Reduction of Weights and Mea<U+017F>ures, to <U+017F>ee his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent profit; yet alwayes carefully ob<U+017F>erving to draw a line with <U+017F>ome imaginary <U+017F>umm for hazards and contingences which may happen unexpectedly; it being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, what-ever care be us'd, to regulate exactly the gain of Merchandize, as depending, partly, on Chance, and, partly, on the Will and Phan<U+017F>ie of Men; <U+017F>o that a Commodity, which, for being to day in fa<U+017F>hion, or otherwi<U+017F>e in credit, would yield twenty in the hundred profit to the Owner, <U+017F>ometimes leaves him a lo<U+017F>er, or he is forc'd to keep it long in his Ware-hou<U+017F>e.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXIX. What are the mo<U+017F>t common Cau<U+017F>es of Law-<U+017F>uits; and why they are more now than heretofore.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>PLato</hi> de<U+017F>igning a Common-wealth, who<U+017F>e Citizens might live in good intelligence, ju<U+017F>tly excludes out of it the words of Mine and Thine; conceiving, that <U+017F>o long as there was any thing to be divided, there would ever be Male-contents; becau<U+017F>e Self-love (the root from whence the too great de<U+017F>ire of keeping and acquiring ari<U+017F>es) acts variou<U+017F>ly in Men; by main force and <U+017F>trong hand in time of War, and in Peace by Law-<U+017F>uits. Now the de<U+017F>ire of Getting, having never been <U+017F>o great as at this day, nor <U+017F>o much countenanc'd and rewarded, (<U+017F>ince in con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of wealth mo<U+017F>t Offices are di<U+017F>pos'd of) 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if Law-<U+017F>uits be more numerous at this day than in times pa<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Community of Goods, feign'd by the Poets, and exemplifi'd in the Primitive Church, (bating the Charity which produc'd it) would cau<U+017F>e as many mi<U+017F>chiefs, and, con<U+017F>equently, Law-<U+017F>uits, as there are at pre<U+017F>ent. For every one would endeavour to appropriate what <U+017F>hould be common, and de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e it if not able to compa<U+017F>s it; as we <U+017F>ee common Cau<U+017F>es are neglected, and commonly lo<U+017F>t, for private intere<U+017F>t. Whence appears the impertinence of <U+017F>ome Legi<U+017F>lators, and of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> who, that the Children might be lov'd the more, would have Wives common; for common Wives and Children would be own'd by no Body; and if <U+017F>uch Women as belong but to two or three, keep them alwayes in jealou<U+017F>ie, and many times ingage them in a Law-<U+017F>uit, what would tho<U+017F>e do that belong'd to all the world? Wherefore, I conceive, that if contrary Effects have contrary Cau<U+017F>es, 'tis Plenty, and its Daughter, Pride, that cau<U+017F>eth Law-<U+017F>uits; and Poverty and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility makes Peace and Agreements. Which the French <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> intimates, where he introduces an old man reconciling two Adver<U+017F>aries, but 'tis after they are both undone. Thus al<U+017F>o the Circle of Humane Life repre<U+017F>ents Labour holding Wealth by the Hand, Wealth holding Pride, Pride holding Contention, which cau<U+017F>eth Poverty; this, Humility; which again produces Labour; that, Wealth; and <U+017F>o round again. For of fifty Law-<U+017F>uits, not one would begin between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (or at lea<U+017F>t it would <U+017F>oon be determin'd) if either would humble them<U+017F>elves as much one to the other, as they do to their Judges; yea, oftentimes to their Council. Wherefore Vanity being greater in this Age than ever it was, (although with le<U+017F>s rea<U+017F>on in mo<U+017F>t) 'tis no wonder if our times abound more with Law-<U+017F>uits than the former.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:66371:153"/>The Third <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>uch as are at their ea<U+017F>e have no mind to Law-<U+017F>uits; and therefore 'tis not Plenty that begets them, but Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, yet not an ab<U+017F>olute one; for he that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cannot go to Law; but <U+017F>uch, that the one cannot pay what he owes, and the other cannot be without it: In every other Ca<U+017F>e, Accommodements are po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. 'Tis from this Source that <U+017F>o many Sei<U+017F>ures and Sentences proceed, which the indebted would never <U+017F>uffer, had they wherewithall to pay, con<U+017F>idering that the whole charges mu<U+017F>t fall upon them<U+017F>elves. Now as there were never <U+017F>o many rich, <U+017F>o there were never <U+017F>o many poor, as there are at this day in <hi>France</hi>; becau<U+017F>e every body labours out of the vanity above-mention'd, to di<U+017F>able them<U+017F>elves every day more and more, laughing at the Con<U+017F>titutions which are made to reduce us to frugality, and a<U+017F>cribing all inconveniences both publick and private to any other Cau<U+017F>e but them<U+017F>elves.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That though the Ages pa<U+017F>t having had the <U+017F>ame vici<U+017F><U+017F>itudes of Peace and War, and of Poverty and Riches, yet had they not <U+017F>o many Law-<U+017F>uits as there are at pre<U+017F>ent; and therefore <U+017F>ome other Cau<U+017F>e thereof mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ought, which po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly is this; That the Spirits of Men are become more refin'd and <U+017F>ubtle in the <U+017F>everal Ages of the world, and con<U+017F>equently, advanc'd to a higher pitch of maliciou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, whence many difficulties and conte<U+017F>t ari<U+017F>e in <U+017F>uch matters, wherein the goodne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>implici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Ance<U+017F>tors found none at all. Nor hath the multitude and diver<U+017F>ity of Laws been a <U+017F>mall occa<U+017F>ion of this bad event. For (be<U+017F>ides the Roman Laws which lay long in oblivion, and were re<U+017F>tor'd to light by <hi>Veruher,</hi> in the year 1127. and the Canons compil'd by <hi>Gratian,</hi> (whence came the judicial forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities) our Cu<U+017F>toms and our Ordinances; and among<U+017F>t others, tho<U+017F>e made <U+017F>ince <hi>Charls</hi> VIII. with long preambles and rea<U+017F>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in imitation of <hi>Ju<U+017F>tinian,</hi> have <U+017F>tirr'd up more Law-<U+017F>uits, than there were in a thou<U+017F>and years before. So that hath been good work for <U+017F>uch as were minded to draw profit thereby, to make <U+017F>o confus'd and intricate an Art of the Law, that there is almo<U+017F>t no Ca<U+017F>e wherein they cannot find <U+017F>ome trick to multiply a Suit, and render it immortal) Moral Rea<U+017F>on (the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law) admits a thou<U+017F>and different faces, not only in circum<U+017F>tances of Fact, but al<U+017F>o in matter of Law; whence there are few Laws but have their contraries.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the multiplicity of our Law-<U+017F>uits is to be attributed to the humor of the French Nation, which is de<U+017F>irous of change, and naturally <U+017F>ubtle and eloquent. Whence a Latine Poet <U+017F>tills <hi>France</hi> the Nur<U+017F>e of Lawyers. Likewi<U+017F>e the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning in this la<U+017F>t Age, hath contributed much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: And the <U+017F>ight of great E<U+017F>tates gotten by the Law, hath induc'd many Parents to put their Children to that profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as the readie<U+017F>t way to advancement. Such as could not be Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ellors, have been made Attornies, Solliciters, Sergeants, and this great number of people employ their inventions to get a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:66371:154"/>
livelyhood, which they cannot do without Law-<U+017F>uits. And therefore 'tis no wonder if they advi<U+017F>e, continue, multiply, and eterni<U+017F>e them as much as they can; egging on the Plaintiff by the motive of Profit, and the Defendant by that of Self-pre<U+017F>ervation; and refu<U+017F>ing to the more <U+017F>imple their writings and other <U+017F>uch helps as might bring them to accord.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That Law-<U+017F>uits increa<U+017F>e or dimini<U+017F>h according to the diver<U+017F>ities of proportions kept in the Admini<U+017F>tration of Ju<U+017F>tice. For <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure them by the Law of Nature, (whereby all Men are born equal) and proceed by Arithmetical Proportion. Thus the <hi>Medes</hi> turn'd Ju<U+017F>tice into Equality; whereas (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> told <hi>Cyrus,</hi> reproving him for awarding the coats to his Companions, according to their <U+017F>tature, and not according to the right and propriety) the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> made Ju<U+017F>tice equal. This Arithmetical Proportion was ob<U+017F>erv'd by <hi>Draco, Solon, Lycurgus,</hi> and all popular States; where every thing was put to the balance. Such al<U+017F>o was the Law of Retaliation among the Jews; Eye for Eye, and Tooth for Tooth. But this equality having <U+017F>o many inconveniences, that many times the highe<U+017F>t Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice is the highe<U+017F>t Inju<U+017F>tice; <hi>Plato</hi> made Ju<U+017F>tice arbitrary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Laws but tho<U+017F>e drawn from the proportion of the great to the <U+017F>mall, and other circum<U+017F>tances, which he call'd Equity, or Geometrical Proportion. Yet this Ju<U+017F>tice being al<U+017F>o too vagous, and left to the di<U+017F>cretion of Magi<U+017F>trates, who are <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to corruption; therefore <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> cho<U+017F>e a middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween tho<U+017F>e two Extreams, regulating Commutative Ju<U+017F>tice, which judgeth of the right of private Men by Arithmetical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; and Di<U+017F>tributive, which is for publick Affairs, by Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Proportion. And our u<U+017F>age hath approv'd an Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical proportion; the Supream Magi<U+017F>trate u<U+017F>ing both Law and Equity, and tempering the too great <U+017F>trictne<U+017F>s of the former, and the much liberty of the other; which cour<U+017F>e is ob<U+017F>erv'd in good Monarchies, where the Chief Courts being above the Law, and yet having Equity in their Power, make an agreeable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of Ju<U+017F>tice with Rea<U+017F>on, being impower'd to rever<U+017F>e the Sentences of Subordinate Judges, who are ty'd to the Letter of the Law; as the Royal Authority is above both. Whence it re<U+017F>ults, that there are few Law-<U+017F>uits where Arithmetical Ju<U+017F>tice, that is, the inflexible rigor of the Law is exercis'd; <U+017F>omewhat more, where Geometrical Proportion hath place, becau<U+017F>e 'tis requi<U+017F>ite to u<U+017F>e Rea<U+017F>ons; which being alwayes the <U+017F>ame, cannot be alter'd, as it happens in Harmonical Proportion, in which the point of right (which is indivi<U+017F>ible in it <U+017F>elf) being variou<U+017F>ly balanc'd between Law and Equity, and drawn from each <U+017F>ide according to the intere<U+017F>t of the parties, the Deci<U+017F>ions of <U+017F>ome Ca<U+017F>es cannot be wholly <U+017F>uted to others, by rea<U+017F>on of the diver<U+017F>ity of circum<U+017F>tances. But as Diametrical Proportions having no connexion of their quantities together, though they quiet pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conte<U+017F>ts, yet they cau<U+017F>e a dangerous reflux into the body
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:66371:154"/>
of the State, by the indignation of the Nobles again<U+017F>t the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, and the People's Envy again<U+017F>t the Nobility; <U+017F>o Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical Proportion, <U+017F>uch as ours, is much more prejudicial to private per<U+017F>ons, which it entertains in Suits, than to the State, wherein it employes turbulent Spirits to di<U+017F>charge their Choler upon paper again<U+017F>t their Adver<U+017F>aries. But in An<U+017F>wer to the Que<U+017F>tion, Why we have more Law-<U+017F>uits now-a-days than formerly, I believe the Rea<U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F>e the common-people have got too much Knowledg of the Laws and Statutes, and Legal Pleadings; for whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e remain'd in Latin and were not under<U+017F>tood, Men were not <U+017F>o apt to commence Litigious Suits one again<U+017F>t another.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXX. Whether more hurt or good hath proceeded from <U+017F>haring the parts of Phy<U+017F>ick between Phy<U+017F>itians, Apothecaries, and Chirurgions.</head>
            <p>THis Que<U+017F>tion being of the greate<U+017F>t moment of any that hath been di<U+017F>cu<U+017F>s'd in this Company, requireth al<U+017F>o mo<U+017F>t caution; becau<U+017F>e there is none of us knows how <U+017F>oon he may come to be at the Mercy of <U+017F>ome one of that Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion which his Sentence <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>oblige. Now all the parts of Phy<U+017F>ick were practis'd of old by one per<U+017F>on; yea, in <hi>Aegypt</hi> it was no <U+017F>et Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but the Prie<U+017F>ts of <hi>Memphis</hi> were bound to write in the Temples of <hi>Vulcan</hi> and <hi>I<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>uch Remedies as any Man came and declar'd to them, that him<U+017F>elf had found benefit by; to the end others might u<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame. So likewi<U+017F>e the Greeks writ in Parchment, and hung at the Porch of the Temples of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Ae<U+017F>culapius,</hi> tho<U+017F>e Receipts that had cur'd them; which the Prie<U+017F>ts took from thence to pronounce to others, as if they had been Oracles; authorizing Medicine by Religion. Afterwards, this Science augmenting by degrees, (as all things do) <U+017F>ome were found that reduc'd tho<U+017F>e Experiences to an Art; the anciente<U+017F>t of whom was <hi>Ae<U+017F>culapius</hi> the Son of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Ariadne,</hi> to whom in time <U+017F>uceeded another <hi>Ae<U+017F>culapius,</hi> the third of that name; who (as <hi>Cicero, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Natur.

And for that the operations of Chirurgery are more apparent than tho<U+017F>e of the

other parts of Phy<U+017F>ick; <hi>Plato</hi> <U+017F>aith, that the ancient Phy<U+017F>ick was only Chirurgery. <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>poke worthily of Medicinal Matters, exercis'd the three parts of Phy<U+017F>ick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly; and <U+017F>o it was practis'd till <hi>Galen</hi>'s time, to wit, 600. years after. Moreover, 'Tis an Argument, That Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery was exercis'd by the Phy<U+017F>icians, That they were expell'd <hi>Rome,</hi> becau<U+017F>e one of them had cut off a Roman Citizen's leg with bad <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. So al<U+017F>o <hi>Darius</hi>'s foot di<U+017F>located by a fall from his Hor<U+017F>e, and re<U+017F>tor'd by <hi>Democedes</hi> a Crotonian Phy<U+017F>ician, then his Pri<U+017F>oner at <hi>Sardis,</hi> (after the vain attempts of his Aegyptian Phy<U+017F>ician) and is an evidence that he was both a Chirurgion and a Phy<U+017F>ician. But <U+017F>ince, Phy<U+017F>icians have done like the heirs of Merchants, they have thought fit to avoid the pains, and enjoy both the honor and the profit; they have re<U+017F>erv'd <U+017F>olely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves the authority and power of pre<U+017F>cribing, and left to the Apothecarie's hone<U+017F>ty and <U+017F>kill, the choice, di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and compo<U+017F>ition of medicaments; and to the Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all manual operations: Nay, many of the<U+017F>e too, out of heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, have left to Barbers and Stews-keepers the Art of trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hair; to others, the dexterity of drawing Teeth; and again, to others the Reduction of Luxations and Fractures; all Appendances of Phy<U+017F>ick. Now to determine, Whether this Divi<U+017F>ion hath done more good or hurt, <U+017F>eems to me to depend upon the capacity of tho<U+017F>e employ'd in this Art.. For if the Phy<U+017F>ician hath not <U+017F>kill enough, or <U+017F>trength of Body to attend all tho<U+017F>e functions, he ought not to undertake them. But he that judges him<U+017F>elf able to di<U+017F>charge them all, will be very heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when he <U+017F>ees the whole honor or blame mu<U+017F>t fall to him<U+017F>elf alone; whereas the divi<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s among<U+017F>t many, makes each per<U+017F>on more negligent: Be<U+017F>ides that, every one can an<U+017F>wer better for his own deed, than for another's; and agrees better with him<U+017F>elf, than with a <U+017F>econd or third; between whom 'tis <U+017F>eldom but <U+017F>ome Cla<U+017F>h happens, and that to the detriment of the Patient. La<U+017F>tly, the Phy<U+017F>ician repre<U+017F>ents the Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, the Chirurgion the Animal, and the Apothecary the tal; <U+017F>o that to divide them, is as much as to <U+017F>eparate the Liver, Heart, and Brain of one and the <U+017F>ame Man; and Theory being never well under<U+017F>tood without practice, 'tis no wonder if their di<U+017F>-union hath occa<U+017F>ion'd the <U+017F>etting up many Ignorants and Empericks.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, If Man's Life be <U+017F>hort, in re<U+017F>pect of the Art of Phy<U+017F>ick (according to the <U+017F>aying of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Prince thereof) then 'tis the way to <U+017F>horten it more, even by two thirds, to a<U+017F><U+017F>ign it three Arts and Exerci<U+017F>es, each of which requires the whole Man. The Egyptians were of another Judgment, not only di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing Phy<U+017F>icians from Operators and Preparers of Medicaments, but al<U+017F>o having particular Phy<U+017F>icians for each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable part of Man; as for the Eye, Ear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which render them more expert; becau<U+017F>e we do nothing well, but what we
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:66371:155"/>
do often; and what difference there is between one that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>es more Arts, and him that is contented with one, appears by comparing Country-Apothecaries and Chirurgians, who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti<U+017F>e all three parts of Phy<U+017F>ick, and tho<U+017F>e of great Cities. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the alliance between the Body and the Soul is <U+017F>uch, that while the one is employ'd about <U+017F>ome work, the other cannot intend its cogitations el<U+017F>e-where, as it ought to do in this Ca<U+017F>e. And therefore to require a Phy<U+017F>ician to let blood, <U+017F>et a bone, or prepare a medicine, is all one as to expect that a General <U+017F>hould both give Orders, and perform the Office of a common Souldier. For if the Mind that is at re<U+017F>t be e<U+017F>teem'd the more wi<U+017F>e and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of rea<U+017F>oning, (whence our Judges <U+017F>it, Phy<U+017F>icians con<U+017F>ult, and the Greeks would have adoration perform'd in that po<U+017F>ture) what good advice can be expected from a Phy<U+017F>ician who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways out of breath with his preparations and operations? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides, 'tis not <U+017F>eemly for a Phy<U+017F>ician to vi<U+017F>it his Patient with his Hands <U+017F>melling and dy'd with drugs, and the confidence of the Patient in him being much conducive to the Cure, it cannot but be better tru<U+017F>ting to three per<U+017F>ons than to one. And indeed, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing a Phy<U+017F>ician were <U+017F>o wicked as to have ill intentions again<U+017F>t his Patient's Life, (which yet is hard to imagine, and there are very few Examples of <U+017F>uch) it would be harder for him to execute them when others prepare his remedies, than when he prepares them him<U+017F>elf. As likewi<U+017F>e the Apothecary may play the Villain more <U+017F>ecurely, when he hath not the in<U+017F>pection of the Phy<U+017F>ician over him. Wherefore 'tis be<U+017F>t that Phy<U+017F>ick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main di<U+017F>tributed into three Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which, like an Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Trade, a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t and uphold each other; the Phy<U+017F>ician being as the Head, and the other two as his two Hands. All the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, is, that this Harmony and Proportion be <U+017F>o well ob<U+017F>erv'd, that the Hands think not them<U+017F>elves to be the Head; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but too frequently, to the great di<U+017F>honor of Phy<U+017F>ick, and damage of the <U+017F>ick.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXI. Whether there be any Real Evil be<U+017F>ides Pain.</head>
            <p>THings have either an ab<U+017F>olute E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, or a Relative; the former are Real, as to be a Man; the latter which have no Being but from the Re<U+017F>pect they have to our Phan<U+017F>ie, depend upon the <U+017F>ame, as to be glad or troubled at certain News. The<U+017F>e two Heads contain all Entities; but becau<U+017F>e the weakne<U+017F>s of Humane Judgement often confounds them, taking an imaginary thing for a real, hence the inqui<U+017F>ition of their difference hath furni<U+017F>h'd the Schools with various Que<U+017F>tions. That of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> was <U+017F>o far from admitting any other Real Evil be<U+017F>ides Pain, that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:66371:156"/>
it allow'd not Pain it <U+017F>elf to be an Evil. On the contrary, <hi>Epicurus</hi> held, there was no other Evil but Pain; nor any other Good but Plea<U+017F>ure, its oppo<U+017F>ite. Indeed by adjoyning Vertue to that Plea<U+017F>ure, and a<U+017F><U+017F>igning the pre-eminence to the plea<U+017F>ure of the Mind, it will be ea<U+017F>ie to make Good and Plea<U+017F>ure conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: whence it will al<U+017F>o follow that Evil and Pain mu<U+017F>t be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That Evil being the Privation of Good, and Privation no real Entity; to enquire whether there be any real Evil, is the <U+017F>ame as to a<U+017F>k whether a Privation be a Habit. But to comply with the terms of the Que<U+017F>tion, which <U+017F>eems to be, Whether there be any other <U+017F>ufferings of that kind which the Vulgar calls Evils, cau<U+017F>ing <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure in us as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>arily as bodily Pain doth? In an<U+017F>wer whereunto, I <U+017F>ay; Fir<U+017F>t that there is both a <U+017F>piritual and a corporeal grief or pain; of either of which <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons are more or le<U+017F>s <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible then others. Secondly, That all people de<U+017F>ire plea<U+017F>ure as a good, and <U+017F>hun pain as an evil (for even the inflictions of <U+017F>ome Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous per<U+017F>ons upon them<U+017F>elves, are done in hope of a future good) and la<U+017F>tly, that both the one and the other are excited by <U+017F>everal and oft-times contrary ways and means. For as the bitterne<U+017F>s of Succhory, hurts and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>es <U+017F>ome but is agreeable to others; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>ame accident may cau<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ure in <U+017F>ome minds and <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s in others; this variety proceeding from the different temper of Minds. Be<U+017F>ides, corporeal and <U+017F>piritual pain differ, in that every one is a capable judge of the former, but not of the latter; whence, as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> <U+017F>aith, all run after plea<U+017F>ures of the Body, becau<U+017F>e they ignore tho<U+017F>e of the Soul; and <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t only reckon their bodily pains true Evils, becau<U+017F>e they have no experience of griefs of the Mind. But he that well weighs how infinitely the Intellect excels the Body, ea<U+017F>ily finds that the evils that attaque the <U+017F>ame are al<U+017F>o far greater; <U+017F>ince 'tis that by which the Body is render'd <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible both of pain and plea<U+017F>ure, and receives impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of both upon the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; wherein particularly the Eye is term'd the Mirror of the Soul, for no other rea<U+017F>on but becau<U+017F>e it repre<U+017F>ents her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Affections. And to <U+017F>hew how much grief and di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure of Mind <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>eth that of the Body, we <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome redeem the lo<U+017F>s of their Honour with that of their Lives, which cannot be without <U+017F>uffering the pain of death.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, 'Tis not the Que<U+017F>tion, whether the griefs of the Body or the Mind be greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>ince every one judges vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly thereof according to his humor. As the Mi<U+017F>er prefers his profit before the pains of Hunger and Thir<U+017F>t; and the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous per<U+017F>on ventures his life in the Field rather than endure the Lye. But the Que<U+017F>tion is, Whether there be any reality in the Evils which the Mind of man undergoes be<U+017F>ides Pain, of which alone we <U+017F>ee all other Animals are <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, Nature teaching Man thereby that <U+017F>he hath left it to his own conduct, how much
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:66371:156"/>
his natural condition is wor<U+017F>e then theirs, whil<U+017F>t he is not only lyable to the <U+017F>ame bodily evils, but becomes ingenious to his own hurt, and an expert Artificer of his own bad fortune. An in<U+017F>tance whereof we have in the Swine that was eating his food peaceably in a Tempe<U+017F>t, whil<U+017F>t all the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>engers fearing every moment to <U+017F>plit again<U+017F>t the Rocks, dy'd as often of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion as they thought of that <U+017F>ad fate. Which fear ended with the Swine's meat, and the Ship's arrival at a <U+017F>afe Port; where it appear'd that that vile Animal had felt none of that trouble which the Tempe<U+017F>t had caus'd in the more unhappy men; and con<U+017F>equently that their Imagination was the <U+017F>ole cau<U+017F>e of it. The like may be <U+017F>aid of all other afflictions which men give them<U+017F>elves, call'd therefore de<U+017F>ervedly by the Wi<U+017F>e-man, <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vexations of <U+017F>pirit.</hi> For mo<U+017F>t of the inductions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equences which the Mind draws from events prove fal<U+017F>e, and neverthele<U+017F>s they give us real <U+017F>orrows; we <U+017F>ee frequently that a great E<U+017F>tate left by a Father to his Children makes them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd and worthle<U+017F>s, and degenerate from the vertue of their Parent, who having receiv'd no inheritance from his own was con<U+017F>train'd to labour, and by that means attain'd Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Whence it appears that the trouble of a Father leaving a <U+017F>mall E<U+017F>tate to his Children at his death hath no foundation in the thing but only in his abus'd Imagination, and con<U+017F>equently cannot be a real Evil, and yet this is the mo<U+017F>t general Evil of all with the Vulgar. Thus two men, lodging under the <U+017F>ame roof lo<U+017F>t both their Wives not long ago: one of them was <U+017F>o afflicted therewith that he dy'd of <U+017F>orrow; the other receiving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olatory vi<U+017F>its of his friends, could not <U+017F>o well di<U+017F><U+017F>emble his joy but that it was perceiv'd; and yet their lo<U+017F>s was equal. So that the <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s of the one, and the joy of the other depended only upon the different reflection they made upon this accident. Thus al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>ame affront that made one of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Di<U+017F>ciples draw his <U+017F>word, made the Philo<U+017F>opher him<U+017F>elf laugh at the <U+017F>ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s of his enemy: and every thing which the Vulgar calls Good or Evil, (Pain excepted) is a Medal, which hath its right <U+017F>ide and its rever<U+017F>e.</p>

               <hi>Theophra<U+017F>tus</hi> diligently de<U+017F>cribes. Among<U+017F>t Bea<U+017F>ts, though <U+017F>ome are <U+017F>ubject to particular Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, as the Dog to Madne<U+017F>s, the Swine to Lepro<U+017F>ie, the Goat and Lyon to Fevers; yet there is none <U+017F>o invaded with all <U+017F>orts of Maladies as Man, who is not exempt from any; the lea<U+017F>t of his <U+017F>imilary parts that is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>h'd being <U+017F>ubject to twelve <U+017F>orts of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, namely, when they attract their aliment, either not at all, or but weakly, or otherwi<U+017F>e then they <U+017F>hould, or when they are defective either in retaining or concocting it, or in voiding <U+017F>uperfluities. But if <U+017F>uch part have <U+017F>en<U+017F>e too, it may have fifteen; if motion al<U+017F>o, eighteen: And if it not only be nouri<U+017F>h'd it <U+017F>elf but labours al<U+017F>o for the publick, 'tis lyable to twelve more, according to the three ways that its Functions may be offended, in attraction, retention, concoction and expul<U+017F>ion. The Eye alone is <U+017F>ubject to almo<U+017F>t 200 infirmities; and, as if there were not ancient Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es enough, we <U+017F>ee daily new ones unknown to former Ages. Now the rea<U+017F>on hereof lyes in the nature of Man, who being the mo<U+017F>t perfectly temper'd and be<U+017F>t compounded of all Animals (becau<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ign'd to the greate<U+017F>t actions) is therefore apt upon the lea<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion to lo<U+017F>e that evenne<U+017F>s of proportion, which as it requires a great train and concurrence of many things, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o there needs but a little thing to <U+017F>ubvert it by defect of the lea<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e requi<U+017F>ites. Indeed, there are but two cau<U+017F>es of Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es, to wit, Internal and External; and man is alike <U+017F>ubject to both; to the former, by rea<U+017F>on of his hot and moi<U+017F>t temper which is prone to putrefaction, and the more upon account of his variety of Food; whereas other Animals never change their Diet; which is the mo<U+017F>t probable cau<U+017F>e of their health and good con<U+017F>titution: For diver<U+017F>ity of aliments incommodes Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, weakens the natural heat, produces Crudities, the Sources of mo<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; which al<U+017F>o are frequently caus'd in Men by the internal Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Anger, Fear, and Joy. The mo<U+017F>t ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary external cau<U+017F>es are the evil qualities of the Air, pe<U+017F>tilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial vapours and malignant influences, whereof Man's body is the more <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible, by rea<U+017F>on of the tenderne<U+017F>s of his Fle<U+017F>h, and the poro<U+017F>ity of his <U+017F>kin; which on the contrary, in other Animals, is hard and cover'd with Hair, Feathers and Scales, and renders them le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ubject to the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of external bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as al<U+017F>o to Wounds, Contu<U+017F>ions, Fractures, and other <U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of continuity.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>uch perfections or defects of things as we know mo<U+017F>t exactly, <U+017F>eem to us the greate<U+017F>t; as the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences and defects of Pictures are not well ob<U+017F>erv'd but by tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>kill'd therein; and he that is unacquainted with <U+017F>ome certain Nation cannot know its Vices <U+017F>o as they that conver<U+017F>e with it do. Now Bea<U+017F>ts being unable to <U+017F>ignifie to us the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of their pains and the other circum<U+017F>tances of their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es, hence we judge them to have fewer, although the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears in the Hor<U+017F>e, in whom ob<U+017F>ervant Farriers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:66371:157"/>
a great number of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, to which we are not <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. So that other Animals may have as many, or more than Men, who being le<U+017F>s concern'd therein, le<U+017F>s under<U+017F>tand them. 'Tis true, the parts of Animals re<U+017F>emble ours, <U+017F>aving what <U+017F>erve to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h their outward <U+017F>hape; as appears by the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of Apes, whereby <hi>Galen</hi> learnt Anatomy; and no difference is found between the Ventricles of a Man's and a Calfe's brain. If their blood and other humors differ, <U+017F>o do tho<U+017F>e of one Man from tho<U+017F>e of another. Moreover, Bea<U+017F>ts have the <U+017F>ame inward Cau<U+017F>es, Fear, Anger, and the other Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions; in <U+017F>hort, all the other Non-natural things, and not at their di<U+017F>cretion as Man hath. If a Dog hath the harder <U+017F>kin, yet man is le<U+017F>s lyable to blows, and the injury of the Air. In fine, who knows but it may be with the<U+017F>e Animals as 'tis with ru<U+017F>ticks, who, though Men as well as we, and <U+017F>ubject to the <U+017F>ame inconveniences, yet all their Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es are reduc'd to a few Heads; <U+017F>ince the true and <U+017F>purious Pleuri<U+017F>ie, the A<U+017F>thma, the Cough, the Pal<U+017F>ie, and other Maladies, whereof we make <U+017F>o many branches, are all reckon'd by them only for a hot or a cold Rheume.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, The nearer Nature promotes Bodies to their utmo<U+017F>t perfection, the more frail <U+017F>he renders them. And as in Mixts, Gla<U+017F>s, which is her utmo<U+017F>t atchievement, is weaker and brittler than Stones; <U+017F>o in Animals, Man the mo<U+017F>t excellent and perfect, is the mo<U+017F>t frail and weak, by rea<U+017F>on of the part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he abounds more than they, and which advances him, to wit, the Brain, the root of mo<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. And as the mo<U+017F>t nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Meteors, are form'd in the colde<U+017F>t Region of the Air, <U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e that have a moi<U+017F>t Brain are <U+017F>oft and le<U+017F>s vigorous, as Women and Children; whence among<U+017F>t the old <hi>Spartans,</hi> and at this day among<U+017F>t the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> (as <hi>Alvarez</hi> reports) 'tis a <U+017F>hame to blow the No<U+017F>e or <U+017F>pit, becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>ignifies Effeminacy; and the <hi>Thracians,</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> records) freed them<U+017F>elves from many Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es, by cutting the Nerves behind the Ear, whereby all fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Brain were <U+017F>topt. On the contrary, Animals having a dry and le<U+017F>s Brain, <U+017F>leep in the open Air without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That as Man exerci<U+017F>es the greate<U+017F>t variety of Actions, <U+017F>o he is liable to mo<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. Animals which rea<U+017F>on not, have no <hi>Delirium</hi>; tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>peak not, are not <U+017F>ubject to be dumb. But the truth is, Men con<U+017F>ider not remote things fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their intere<U+017F>t reaches. Hence more Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd in the Bee and Silk-worm, than in the Elephant. Unle<U+017F>s we had rather <U+017F>ay, that there being <U+017F>o great a variety of di<U+017F>po<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tempers requir'd to the Health of all the parts, humors, and faculties of a humane body, it happens very rarely that they are all as they <U+017F>hould be. As 'tis harder to make good Mu<U+017F>ick with a Lute, or other many <U+017F>tring'd In<U+017F>truments, than with one that hath fewer <U+017F>trings and accords, as Animals have in re<U+017F>pect of Man.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXIII. Of the Greenne<U+017F>s of Plants.</head>
            <p>COlours being the illuminated <U+017F>urface of Mixt Bodies, alter according to their various mixture; and becau<U+017F>e the le<U+017F>s a body is di<U+017F>tant from its <U+017F>implicity, it partakes the more of light; hence as <U+017F>oon as water becomes con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent and <U+017F>olid, it puts on Whitene<U+017F>s, which is <U+017F>o near akin to Light, that the latter cannot be painted but with the former. For this rea<U+017F>on new-<U+017F>prung Plants, i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the Womb of their Elements, retain a White Colour; till having thru<U+017F>t their <U+017F>tem out of the Earth, the nouri<U+017F>hment they attract adding to their compo<U+017F>ition, they a<U+017F><U+017F>ume a new Colour, which <U+017F>utably to the Temper of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, (who<U+017F>e upper part is heated by the Sun-beans, and lower part nouri<U+017F>h'd with the juice and vapors of the Earth) becomes Green, upon the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on that Blew and Yellow make a Green; the Blew proceeding from condens'd Moi<U+017F>ture, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in deep Seas) and the Yellow from the Sun-beams. Hence a Plant depriv'd of the Sun's a<U+017F>pect, loo<U+017F>eth its verdure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Colour-le<U+017F>s by the privation, which is always Harbinger to <U+017F>ome en<U+017F>uing Generation, it appears white; as we u<U+017F>e to make Succhory and Thi<U+017F>tles white by burying them, or covering them in a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el whereinto no Air can enter. Greenne<U+017F>s therefore is the fir<U+017F>t mixture of the Sun-beams with corrupted humidity, (as putrid waters wax green) and the fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ay of the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Soul, and con<U+017F>equently, an evidence of their Life; as, on the contrary, Yellowne<U+017F>s <U+017F>hews that the Sun hath dry'd up the humidity wherein the life re<U+017F>ided, and left only the Colour of Feüille-morte. But when this humidity is <U+017F>o unctuous and adherent to the compact and <U+017F>olid body of a Plant that it cannot be exhal'd, (as Oyle is not evaporated by the Sun) than the outward Cold <U+017F>hutting the Pores, retains the Greenne<U+017F>s longer and brighter, whil<U+017F>t other Herbs and Trees are de<U+017F>poil'd of their verdure. And therefore 'tis no wonder if the leavs of <U+017F>uch Plants, as the Laurel, Holly, Box, Ivy, and many others, feel no injury from great Cold and great Heat.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the production of Vegetables proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the re<U+017F>olution of Minerals, (as appears, not only in the order of Generations, which proceed from <U+017F>imple to organick bodies, but al<U+017F>o in the <U+017F>ympathy of the Oak with Copper, of the Beech with the Load-<U+017F>tone, of the Hazel with Gold and Silver) 'tis probable that Vitriol, (the commone<U+017F>t of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and found in mo<U+017F>t grounds) gives Plants their Verdure; which many of them al<U+017F>o te<U+017F>tifie by their acidity. For I cannot attribute the Cau<U+017F>e to Light, which is indifferent to all Colours, and hath none in it <U+017F>elf; the Gold Colour of the Sun not inhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:66371:158"/>
in him, but proceeding from the reflexion of bodies he irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates. But if we are to find <U+017F>ome mixture of Yellow and Blew to make this Green, I <U+017F>hould rather a<U+017F><U+017F>ign the Yellow to the Earth, which is mo<U+017F>t commonly of that Colour; as the Air and Heaven are Blew. And perhaps too, this Greenne<U+017F>s is but a <U+017F>ign of imperfect Generation, <U+017F>ince 'tis lo<U+017F>t when Plants are mature; and we find it again in mouldy Bread, which is in a tendency to corruption.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That all Bodies mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>ome Colour or other, and a Plant being the fir<U+017F>t living thing, ought to have the mo<U+017F>t agreeable, as being equally temper'd of the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, Black and White; for at its fir<U+017F>t i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the Earth, whil<U+017F>t it is yet full of earthy humidity, it is of a dark Green, which becomes lighter as the Plant <U+017F>hoots higher; till at length the more volatile particles are excluded in a Flower which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows its Colour from the various qualities of the <U+017F>ap; then comes out the fruit, which keeps its verdure till the Sun have fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted its juice.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That 'tis not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to give the rea<U+017F>on of Colours, <U+017F>ince we <U+017F>ee Tulips change theirs almo<U+017F>t every year; and there are Black, White, Red, and other colour'd grapes, equally <U+017F>weet, and good for Wine; as al<U+017F>o Apples, Pears, and other fruit. Nor is Greenne<U+017F>s in<U+017F>eparable from the leavs of Plants; for we have not only red Coleworts, but al<U+017F>o Roots, and <U+017F>ome leavs of Rapes, Purple, Violet, and of other Colours. All that can be <U+017F>aid in this matter, is, That Colour is nothing but a re<U+017F>ultance of the External Light from the Surface, who<U+017F>e Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are <U+017F>o, or <U+017F>o modifi'd and po<U+017F>ited. Hence Blew appears Green by Candle-light; the necks of Doves <U+017F>eem of divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours by diver<U+017F>ity of <U+017F>ituation; and Wool appears whiter when compacted together, than whil<U+017F>t it was in flocks; whereas Water, which hath no Colour, <U+017F>hews white when Particles are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Air, and reduc'd into Snow. So al<U+017F>o when Humidity is dige<U+017F>ted by Heat, (which is in<U+017F>eparable from Light) it puts on the fir<U+017F>t of Colours, which is Blew; (of which Colour thickned Air appears to us) and the prodominant earthine<U+017F>s of Plants, makes that Blew incline to a darker degree, thence ari<U+017F>eth Green; which is the general Colour of all Plants. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament contributes lea<U+017F>t to this Colour; for we <U+017F>ee <hi>Semper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivum,</hi> which is cold, of the <U+017F>ame Colour with Leeks and the Aloë-Plant, which are Hot. Ju<U+017F>t as Sugar and Salt are both White, and yet differ much in Ta<U+017F>te and other qualities; <U+017F>o are Chalk and Snow; Honey and Gall are Yellow, the juice of Aloes and that of Liquerice black. Yea, in Animals too, the diver<U+017F>ity of their Colour, Hair, and Plumes is deceitful; whence came the Proverb, Of every Hair a good Grey-hound. And whereas Phy<U+017F>icians reckon the Colour of the Hair a <U+017F>ign of the Temper, 'tis not always true; <U+017F>ince we <U+017F>ee per<U+017F>ons of the <U+017F>ame Hair totally different in Manners and Humors; and others of different Hair,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:66371:159"/>
perfectly agreeing in temper; wherein con<U+017F>equently we mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>eek the rea<U+017F>on of colours.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXIV. Of the Cold of the middle Region of the Air.</head>
            <p>THe common Opinion attributes the coldne<U+017F>s of the middle Region to the Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is of the heat of the upper and lower Regions, which <U+017F>treightning the cold on either <U+017F>ide leave it no other place but the middle, whither the vapors rais'd by the Sun-beams a<U+017F>cending, and no higher by rea<U+017F>on of their weight and the thinne<U+017F>s of the air there; it comes to pa<U+017F>s that the neighbourhood of the<U+017F>e vapors returning to their natural cold, encrea<U+017F>es that of the middle Region. But many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences invalidate this Opinion. Fir<U+017F>t, if this Element were hot and moi<U+017F>t, as is <U+017F>uppos'd, it would <U+017F>hew <U+017F>ome effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but 'tis quite contrary. For he were a fool that <U+017F>hould go into the Air to warm him<U+017F>elf; and the Air hath <U+017F>o little humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it dries all Bodies. Secondly, many Mountains <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the middle Region of the Air, and retaining figures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>crib'd in the a<U+017F>hes of a Sacrifice for a whole year, which <U+017F>hew that in all that time no Wind or Rain was rais'd there to deface them; it would follow that <U+017F>uch Mountains reflecting the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams by their <U+017F>olidity, <U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e heat in the middle Region of the Air, and yet they are commonly cover'd with Snow. La<U+017F>tly, this Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is being only in Summer, not in Winter when the cold of the lower Region <U+017F>ymboli<U+017F>es with that of the middle, this rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>hould then cea<U+017F>e; and yet 'tis in Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that cold Meteors manife<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves. Wherefore we mu<U+017F>t recur to <U+017F>ome other cau<U+017F>e; which <hi>Cardan</hi> takes to be the natural coldne<U+017F>s of the Air, not regarding the combination of the four fir<U+017F>t qualities. For if cold be natural to the Air, it will be ea<U+017F>ie to conclude, that it mu<U+017F>t be colde<U+017F>t in the middle, which is le<U+017F>s alter'd by the contrary quality of heat; being mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tant from the Element of Fire (if there be any) and from the heat which nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follows the motion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sphears.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Cold being no po<U+017F>itive Quality, but a bare negation, it follows that Bodies de<U+017F>titute of Heat are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>arily cold. Now the Air cannot have heat or any other quality, becau<U+017F>e 'tis to <U+017F>erve for a medium not only to all <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary Bodies, but al<U+017F>o to the heavenly influences, who<U+017F>e nature would be perverted and alter'd by the qualities of the Air; as a colour'd medium imparts its colours to objects. It happens therefore that vapours cool not but are cooled by the Air, <U+017F>o that they become colder in the middle Region then whil<U+017F>t they
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:66371:159"/>
were in their natural <U+017F>eats. Yea they are <U+017F>o far from rendring the Air cold that they abate its <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s, which is never great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then in clear weather; cloudy and mi<U+017F>ty weather being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more warm and accompany'd with le<U+017F>s piercing cold. For being rais'd rather by the <U+017F>ubterraneous heat then by that of the Sun, they warm our air (which reaches not above a league from the Earth); then being gradually de<U+017F>erted by the heat which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd them up they meet in tho<U+017F>e higher <U+017F>paces which are void of all heat, and begin immediately to conden<U+017F>e and congeal them. What people talk of the higher Region of the Air is very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becau<U+017F>e the Element of Fire being but an Opinion cannot counter-balance the report of <hi>Aco<U+017F>ta,</hi> who affirms that divers Spaniards were kill'd by the cold in their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age upon the Mountains of <hi>Peru</hi> which he judges the highe<U+017F>t of the World and within the upper region.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That if we were to be try'd by experience alone, the Earth (which in Winter is hot at the Centre, and in Summer on its Surface) would not be judg'd cold and dry (as it is) no more then the Water always cold and moi<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince the Sun's heat warms it, and the <U+017F>altne<U+017F>s of the Sea renders it heating and drying. But accidental qualities mu<U+017F>t be carefully di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>h'd from e<U+017F><U+017F>ential; becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e latter are hard to be di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd when any impediment interpo<U+017F>es. As the <U+017F>ight cannot judge of the <U+017F>traitne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>tick in the water but by having recour<U+017F>e to rea<U+017F>on; which teaches us that all light Elements are al<U+017F>o hot. Now the lightne<U+017F>s of the air is indi<U+017F>putable; and its heat is prov'd by its <U+017F>ubtlety, whereby it penetrates bodies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>able by light it <U+017F>elf. Yet this heat is ea<U+017F>ily turn'd into cold; becau<U+017F>e the air being a tenuious body and not compact, retains its qualities no longer then they are maintain'd therein by their ordinary cau<U+017F>es. So that 'tis no wonder if not being hot in the highe<U+017F>t degree (as Fire is) but in a remi<U+017F>s and inferior degree, it ea<U+017F>ily becomes <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of a more powerful contrary quality. For the Sun-beams, which <U+017F>ome hold to be the true Element of Fire, heat not unle<U+017F>s they be united by reflection; and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection being limited cannot reach beyond our fir<U+017F>t Region; the higher Regions mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily remain cold; unle<U+017F>s upon further inquiry it be thought that the motion of the air carry'd about with the Sphear of the Moon and the Element of Fire plac'd under the <U+017F>ame, are capable to heat it.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That if we may judge of tho<U+017F>e higher Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Air by tho<U+017F>e of the Earth and Water which we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, each of the<U+017F>e Elements hath three <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible differences; its Surface, Middle and Centre. Tho<U+017F>e that frequent Mines, tell us that the heat which <U+017F>ucceeds the exterior cold of our earth penetrates not above a quarter of a league in depth; about the end of which <U+017F>pace, cold begins to be felt again, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>es more and more towards the Centre. In like manner 'tis probable that the Water follows the qualities as well as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:66371:160"/>
of the Earth. That it is hot at the bottom (whither therefore the Fi<U+017F>h retire in Winter) proceeds from the nearne<U+017F>s of that middle Region of the Earth. So that it being proper to the<U+017F>e Elements to have different qualities in their middle from tho<U+017F>e of their extremities, the <U+017F>ame may be true al<U+017F>o of the Air; po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly becau<U+017F>e a perfect identity of temperature would not have been convenient for the generation of Mixts, to which end all the Elements were de<U+017F>tinated. And it being the property of cold to clo<U+017F>e and re-unite the loo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation of the Air, it was therefore highly nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to be predominant in the middle Region thereof.</p>

After birth, we <U+017F>ee the actions of Males are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with more <U+017F>trength and vigor then tho<U+017F>e of Females, who are actually colder and <U+017F>uffer more inconveniences from cold. They are never ambidexters, becau<U+017F>e they have not heat enough to <U+017F>upply agility to both <U+017F>ides; and their right <U+017F>ide is peculiarly de<U+017F>tinated to the Generation of Females, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the Spermatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el on that <U+017F>ide derives blood from the hollow Vein which is hotte<U+017F>t by rea<U+017F>on of the proximity of that Vein to the Liver; whereas the left Spermatick draws from the Emulgent, which carrying Sero<U+017F>e humors together with the Blood, 'tis no wonder if the Seed of that <U+017F>ide be crude and cold, and con<U+017F>equently fitter for generating Femals then Males: Hence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> <U+017F>aith, that if as Pea<U+017F>ants tye a Bull's left Te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle when they de<U+017F>ire a Bull-calf, and the right when a Cow-calf,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:66371:160"/>
the <U+017F>ame be practis'd by Man, the like effect will follow. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by 'tis manife<U+017F>t that whatever makes the Seed more hot and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous both in Male and Female, furthers the Generation of Males, and contrarily; and con<U+017F>equently that the Morning, when 'tis be<U+017F>t concocted, is more proper then the Evening, for begetting Boys; and the Winter then the Summer (at lea<U+017F>t on the man's part.)</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That as to the production of Males rather then Females, or on the contrary, no certain cau<U+017F>e hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd thereof; <U+017F>ince we <U+017F>ee that the <U+017F>ame man, in all likelihood without alteration of his temper, hath only Girles by his fir<U+017F>t Wife, and only Boys by the <U+017F>econd, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and <U+017F>ome that could get no Children at all in their youth have had only Boys in their old Age. Others have Males fir<U+017F>t, others Females, and others have them alternatively. Whereof no other rea<U+017F>on can be a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd by Chance, or rather the Divine Plea<U+017F>ure alone, in the impenetrable Secrets whereof to <U+017F>eek for a cau<U+017F>e, were high temerity. If heat and <U+017F>trength caus'd the difference, young marry'd people would not have Girles fir<U+017F>t, as it happens mo<U+017F>t often; and decrepit old men <U+017F>hould never get Boys, as daily experience <U+017F>hews they do. Moreover, <U+017F>ome men depriv'd of one of their Te<U+017F>ticles, have neverthele<U+017F>s begotten both Sons and Daughters; which could not be, if the faculty of begetting Children of one determinate Sex were affix'd to either of tho<U+017F>e parts. And as from a fal<U+017F>e Principle nothing can be drawn but fal<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>equences, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o is it in the opinion of <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> That Woman is but an occa<U+017F>ional Creature. For then Nature <U+017F>hould produce far greater abundance of Males then of Females, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would erre oftner then hit right (which is incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with her wi<U+017F>dom), and yet in all places more Girles and Women are found then Men; as appears in that we every where <U+017F>ee plenty of Maids that want Hu<U+017F>bands, and in Countries wherein Polygamy is lawful, there are Women enough to <U+017F>upply ten or a dozen Wives to each Man. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Nature's de<U+017F>ign is mainly for pre<U+017F>erving the Species; as that of every individual is to pre<U+017F>erve it <U+017F>elf; and the bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat or cold in the Seed being but an accident of an accident cannot effect a formal change in the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. Only defective heat may occa<U+017F>ion an effeminate man, and abundant heat a Virago. Be<U+017F>ides this Opinion de<U+017F>troys the common and true one, <hi>viz.</hi> That Generation is one of tho<U+017F>e actions which proceeds from a ju<U+017F>t proportion and temperature of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; whence exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive or feveri<U+017F>h heat de<U+017F>troys the Seed in <U+017F>tead of furthering Generation, and is an enemy to all the other functions. Wherefore 'tis be<U+017F>t to <U+017F>ay that the <U+017F>ame difference which is ob<U+017F>erv'd between the Seeds of Plants, is al<U+017F>o found in that of Animals, though not di<U+017F>cernable therein but by the effects: and as the exacte<U+017F>t prying cannot ob<U+017F>erve in the kernel of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond or Pine any difference of the Trunk, Leaves and Fruit
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:66371:161"/>
of tho<U+017F>e Trees, although the<U+017F>e parts be <hi>potentially</hi> contain'd therein, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o the Seed of an Animal contains in it <U+017F>elf even the lea<U+017F>t differences of Sex, albeit imperceptibly to the eye. Which the Rabbins being unable otherwi<U+017F>e to comprehend, conceiv'd that our fir<U+017F>t Parent was created an Hermaphrodite, becau<U+017F>e both Sexes came from him, his own and that of <hi>Eve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the <U+017F>ole ignorance of things occa<U+017F>ions the a<U+017F>cribing of them to Chance, which hath no power over the wi<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e they under<U+017F>tand the rea<U+017F>ons thereof. As for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>al cau<U+017F>es, as the Divine is, they concur indeed with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ones; but as they are becoming in the mouths of Divines and of the Vulgar, <U+017F>o Naturali<U+017F>ts mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>top there, <U+017F>ince by the right u<U+017F>e of external cau<U+017F>es the internal may be corrected; by which correction not only Seeds formerly barren, or which fell in an ingrateful <U+017F>oil, are reduc'd to a better temper and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd prolifick, but <U+017F>uch as were de<U+017F>tinated to a female produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction through defect of heat, are render'd more vigorous and fit to generate Males. Now that young married people hit not <U+017F>ometimes upon this latter Sex, 'tis becau<U+017F>e of their frequent debauchery, which cools the Brain, and con<U+017F>equently the whole habit of the Body. Which happens not <U+017F>o frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to men of more advanc'd age, who u<U+017F>e all things more moderately.</p>
            <p>The Fourth attributed the cau<U+017F>e to the Con<U+017F>tellations and Influences of the Stars which reign at the time of Conception; Males being generated under Ma<U+017F>culine, and Females under Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine Signs.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXVI. Whether the French Tongue be <U+017F>ufficient for learning all the Sciences.</head>
            <p>A Language is a Multitude or Ma<U+017F>s of Nouns and Verbs which are <U+017F>igns of Things and Times, de<U+017F>tinated to the explication of our thoughts. There are two <U+017F>orts; the one perfect, call'd Mother-Languages, the other imperfect. The Mother-Languages are the Hebrew, Greek, and Latine; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect tho<U+017F>e which depend upon them. Now the French being of this latter <U+017F>ort, we cannot learn the Sciences by it alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e being particular, and the Sciences general, the le<U+017F>s is not capable to comprehend the greater. Moreover, our Language being not certain in its Phra<U+017F>es, nor yet in its Words (not only Ages, but al<U+017F>o a few Years changing both) whereas the Sciences are certain and immutable, it will follow that they cannot be taught by it. Be<U+017F>ides, there may be Inventions for which our
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:66371:161"/>
Language hath no expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or at lea<U+017F>t not <U+017F>o good as others; and to bu<U+017F>ie our minds in the <U+017F>earch of words is more likely to retard the mind in the acqui<U+017F>ition of Sciences then to further it. The truth is, 'twere well if things were generally expre<U+017F>s'd by the mo<U+017F>t proper and <U+017F>ignificant words, but they are not <U+017F>o in any Language much le<U+017F>s in the French, which is <U+017F>o far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich enough of its <U+017F>elf that it borrows from the Greek and Latine to expre<U+017F>s the mo<U+017F>t common things, and con<U+017F>equently is not <U+017F>ufficient to teach all the Sciences.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, The French Tongue is deriv'd from the Greek, Latine, and Gothick, which are Languages much more copious then it; and therefore they that will recur to originals will find tho<U+017F>e Tongues more adapted for teaching the Sciences then the French, and yet not any <U+017F>ingle one of them <U+017F>ufficient for it; <U+017F>ince the Romans, to become and de<U+017F>erve the name of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, were oblig'd to learn Greek. Moreover, <U+017F>ince Books are the chief in<U+017F>truments for attaining the Sciences, the ancient Latine and Greek ones (which yet were not <U+017F>ufficient for it) are much more numerous than the French, and by con<U+017F>equence the French Tongue is not capable to teach every Science: and had it more Tran<U+017F>lations then it hath, yet the<U+017F>e are but <U+017F>mall Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets deriv'd from that grand Source of Sciences which is found in the original Languages.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, If we regard the order of times and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of the Creation when all things were in their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and purity; 'tis mo<U+017F>t likely that, that Language which took birth with <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the Sciences, is more fit to teach them then the much more Novel French, and <U+017F>ince there mu<U+017F>t be a proportion between In<U+017F>truments and the Matters upon which they act; and this proportion is not found between the French Tongue lately invented and the Sciences which are as ancient as the World, who can think it <U+017F>ufficient to teach them? and the Cabali<U+017F>ts hold that the Language fit to teach the Sciences per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, mu<U+017F>t have words adapted to <U+017F>ignifie the Vertues and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of things, which ours hath not.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That all the Language of <hi>Adam,</hi> who gave names <U+017F>uitable to the nature of every thing being lo<U+017F>t except the the name of God (for that rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teemed by the Jews); The Cabali<U+017F>ts in imitation of that Tongue, invented one whereof I <U+017F>hall give you a ta<U+017F>te. It hath five Vowels <hi>E, A, <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>, I, O,</hi> which an<U+017F>wer to the Elements and the Heaven; <hi>E,</hi> to Earth; <hi>A,</hi> to the Water; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>,</hi> to the Air; <hi>I,</hi> to the Fire; and <hi>O,</hi> to Heaven. <hi>E,</hi> produceth in pronunciation <hi>c, d, f, g, l, m, n, p, r, <U+017F>, t, z</hi>; fora<U+017F>much as the<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>onants cannot be produc'd without it; <hi>A,</hi> produceth <hi>h,</hi> and <hi>k; v,</hi> produceth <hi>q; I,</hi> produceth nothing, becau<U+017F>e pure and <U+017F>ingle Fire doth not. <hi>O,</hi> likewi<U+017F>e produceth nothing, becau<U+017F>e the Heaven only moves and excites Generations: whereas <hi>E</hi> produceth abundance of Letters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embling the Earth which produceth every thing in its bo<U+017F>om,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:66371:162"/>
being the Centre of Heaven and the Matrix of the Elements. Now, to form words according to the Elementary Qualities, they will have the Vowels which compo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a word an<U+017F>wer to the Elements which compo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a mixt body. And to <U+017F>pecifie degrees, becau<U+017F>e the Vowels, whereby they are denoted meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together would <U+017F>poil the pronunciation, therefore they make foure orders of the <U+017F>ixteen Con<U+017F>onants, <hi>viz. b, c, d, f,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the four degrees of Fire; <hi>g, l, m, n,</hi> tho<U+017F>e of Air; <hi>p, r, <U+017F>, t,</hi> tho<U+017F>e of Water; <hi>x, z, <U+017F><U+017F>, <U+017F>t,</hi> tho<U+017F>e of Earth. Upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation they build the compo<U+017F>ition of all their Words, which they compo<U+017F>e of Vowels according to the Elements predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in things, and of Con<U+017F>onants according to their degree. But who <U+017F>ees not the ab<U+017F>urdity of this invention, which by this means would extend only to corporeal mixts, whereof the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and very degree is known: Concerning which Naturali<U+017F>ts are <U+017F>o far from being agreed, that many attribute mo<U+017F>t natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to other cau<U+017F>es, as to Occult Properties, <U+017F>o call'd in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition to the Elementary. 'Tis be<U+017F>t therefore not to rove from the common tract which teaches us the Sciences by real Languages; among<U+017F>t which tho<U+017F>e call'd Dead ones, to wit, the Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, and others now di<U+017F>us'd, <U+017F>uffice not for teaching the Sciences, becau<U+017F>e they are not pronounc'd well, and the learned agree not about the importance of many Letters and Syllables.

And all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s that in order to obtain the perfection of a Science, too much plainne<U+017F>s cannot be us'd, either on the Teacher's part in e<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli<U+017F>hing their Rules and Precepts, or on the Learner's in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding their difficulties for re<U+017F>olution.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXVII. Of diver<U+017F>ity of Colours in one and the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject.</head>
            <p>THe diver<U+017F>ity of Colours is commonly deduc'd from the mixtion and proportion of the Elements; but more truly from the <U+017F>everal degrees of Sulphur, which produces them, as Salt doth Sapors, the mo<U+017F>t certain indications what degree the quality of a Plant is of: For if Colours had relation to the Elements, then all red things <U+017F>hould be hot, and white things cold; which is not true in Poppy, and Ro<U+017F>es, on the one <U+017F>ide, nor Orange-flowers and Ja<U+017F>min on the other. So al<U+017F>o green things <U+017F>hould be always moi<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e this colour proceeds from an indige<U+017F>ted humidity mixt with a part of putrifi'd earth; as appears in <U+017F>tanding waters; and yet the greenne<U+017F>s of Lawrel and Mint hinders them not from being hot and dry, nor that of Ranun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus from burning. But Colours are either natural, or artificial;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66371:162"/>
which latter as we find it in Stuffs and Silks, is neither the cau<U+017F>e nor the effect of their temperament. But natural colour, <U+017F>uch as that in the parts of living Animals, is an effect of their Life, and alterable after their death. Wherefore I conclude, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and its varieties proceeds from the different degrees of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur in the <U+017F>ubject; but that one and the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject is of <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral colours, the cau<U+017F>es may be: Fir<U+017F>t, for that <U+017F>ome of its parts are more compact; others, more loo<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o differently receive the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Sulphur and the Internal Fire. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Sun <U+017F>hining more upon one part than another, draws the internal colour from the Centre to the Circumference; as Apples are colour'd on the <U+017F>ide next the Sun. Thirdly, the <U+017F>ame difference which is found between the Root, Trunk, Leavs, Flower, Fruit, and other parts of Plants and Animals, is al<U+017F>o found in each portion of tho<U+017F>e parts; as the lower part of the Ro<U+017F>e is green, the middle part whiti<U+017F>h, and the top red; and the Tulip variegated, is compounded of as many <U+017F>everal parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; which variety of places and matrices, <U+017F>erves to determine the colour which Sulphur paints thereon, being guided by the pencil of Nature.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That this diver<U+017F>ity of colours proceeds only from the divers a<U+017F>pect of light which varies the colours of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bodies to our Eye, as in the Rain-bow, the Camelion, and the necks of Pigeons, in things expos'd to the Sun, which <U+017F>eem far brighter than before: To which you mu<U+017F>t add the di<U+017F>tance and <U+017F>tation of the beholders; <U+017F>o water <U+017F>eems black or blew afar off, but near hand colourle<U+017F>s; Turpentine, Cry<U+017F>tal, and the whites of Eggs in <U+017F>everal <U+017F>ituations do the like.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That there are four colours an<U+017F>wering to the Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Black to Earth, White to Water, Yellow to Air, and Red to Fire. For di<U+017F>covering the Cau<U+017F>es of who<U+017F>e di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ities, the ancient Philo<U+017F>ophers prepar'd a Matter, which by the degrees of fire, they pa<U+017F>s'd through all the colours of Nature, and perceiv'd <U+017F>ometimes in their ve<U+017F><U+017F>el what they call'd the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock's tail, repre<U+017F>enting all colours in one <U+017F>ingle Matter; whence they concluded the variety of colours to proceed from that of External Fire, moving the Matter le<U+017F>s in one part than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus Antimony, which is at fir<U+017F>t Black, is rais'd into White, Yellow, Red, and mixt Flowers, according as they are <U+017F>ublim'd more or le<U+017F>s. But you can draw no con<U+017F>equence from hence to the Colours of Plants, <U+017F>ince redne<U+017F>s, which, in works of Art, argues perfect Dige<U+017F>tion, and Fire predominant, doth not <U+017F>o in Simples.</p>

Which al<U+017F>o the Go<U+017F>pel te<U+017F>tifies, by the compari<U+017F>on of a mote which we e<U+017F>py in the Eye of a Neighbour, not <U+017F>eeing the beam which is in our own; for, (according to the direction of the Lawyers, who are to be believed in point of affairs) in the fir<U+017F>t place in reference to per<U+017F>ons, every one under<U+017F>tands him<U+017F>elf much le<U+017F>s either in Mind or Body than he doth another; mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>teeming them<U+017F>elves more capable and worthy of prai<U+017F>e for Witt than they are; and (as the Eye <U+017F>ees not it <U+017F>elf, but every other vi<U+017F>ible thing <U+017F>o,) he that hath any perfection or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, cannot con<U+017F>ider the <U+017F>ame in its true Latitude, but ea<U+017F>ily adds <U+017F>omething to the fir<U+017F>t, or dimini<U+017F>hes from the <U+017F>econd; whil<U+017F>t the various bent of our Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions always exalts and depre<U+017F><U+017F>es the balance, and keeps it from that <hi>aequilibrium</hi> which is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to a right Judgement. Hence Phy<U+017F>icians, although they ought to know them<U+017F>elves better than they can be known by others, yet, when <U+017F>ick, permit them<U+017F>elves to be treated by their Companions; and never <U+017F>ucceed <U+017F>o well in the Cure of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves or their dome<U+017F>ticks, as they do abroad el<U+017F>ewhere. In the <U+017F>econd place, we are le<U+017F>s quick-<U+017F>ighted in things that concern our <U+017F>elves, than in tho<U+017F>e of others: whence commonly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Lawyers leave the affairs of their own Hou<U+017F>es more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled than others. Which was the cau<U+017F>e that the Wife of <hi>Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the famous Lawyer of our time, <U+017F>ent to him to a<U+017F>k his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice concerning his own affairs under fancied names, making him pay a Solicitor with his own Money. In the third place, Actions are in a very evill hand when they are to be managed or defended by their Authors; either Mode<U+017F>ty on the one hand extenuating them, or Thra<U+017F>onical pride dilating them, and adding thereunto more than is fit. La<U+017F>tly, the Laws <U+017F>hew <U+017F>ufficiently what hath been the opinion of Legi<U+017F>lators upon this matter, when they forbid Advocates and Procurators to plead and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti<U+017F>e in their own Cau<U+017F>e; and when they injoyn Judges to forbear, not only their own, but al<U+017F>o from all tho<U+017F>e wherein their kinred or alliances may have any intere<U+017F>t. Thus much for the fir<U+017F>t Head of the Que<U+017F>tion. The Rea<U+017F>on, which is the <U+017F>econd, ari<U+017F>eth hence; That the Eye as well as all other Organs of External and Internal Sen<U+017F>es (<U+017F>uch as the Judgement is) mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>erene, and not prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed by any tincture or Prejudice. Now to require
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:66371:163"/>
this <U+017F>erenity and indifferency in our own affairs, is to demand an impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility. The Cau<U+017F>e whereof may come from the purene<U+017F>s and <U+017F>ubtilty of the Humane Spirit, above that of other Animals, compared to the Elements of Earth and Water, which contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them<U+017F>elves round about their own Centre, move not but in que<U+017F>t of their food; others more ayerious, ri<U+017F>e a little higher, but yet have a bounded Region; <U+017F>uch are the <U+017F>pirits of Women, who<U+017F>e Knowledg and Curio<U+017F>ity is limited to the affairs of their hou<U+017F>wifrie, or at mo<U+017F>t to tho<U+017F>e of their neighbourhood. But the Mind of Man re<U+017F>embling Fire, which hath no other bound but Heaven, penetrates even to the Centre of the Earth, carries its point every where, and is like flame in a perpetual agitation, oftentimes re<U+017F>embling our natural heat in Summer, which abandons the Internal parts to carry it <U+017F>elf to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, There is as great diver<U+017F>ity of Judgements and Witts, as there is of Eyes among<U+017F>t Men. As there are <U+017F>ome blind; other Eyes from which the Objects mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>et at di<U+017F>tance to become vi<U+017F>ible; <U+017F>ome al<U+017F>o to which they mu<U+017F>t be approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, la<U+017F>tly, others which require a moderate di<U+017F>tance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Vi<U+017F>ible Object and the Organ: Iin like manner, there are <U+017F>ome Judgements ab<U+017F>olutely blind; others, which judge not things too near, but require to have them removed, or <U+017F>et at a middle di<U+017F>tance; there are others al<U+017F>o, which judge them better near hand than a far off; and this truly is the cu<U+017F>tom of the be<U+017F>t Judgements, and of <U+017F>uch as lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>uffer them<U+017F>elves to be prepo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd. Indeed, what is more ab<U+017F>urd than for us to remove far from Objects in order to judging of them, after the manner of old men, and of tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>hort-<U+017F>ighted; and if the <U+017F>aying of <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> be true, The Species of the thing to be known mu<U+017F>t be not only introduced into, but al<U+017F>o made like the Mind; Is the dive<U+017F>ting our <U+017F>elves of it away to know it well? By this reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning we <U+017F>hall never <U+017F>ee clear in any affair: not in our own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e 'tis ours; nor in tho<U+017F>e others, in regard of the Envy Men bear to the pro<U+017F>perity of their Neighbours, which makes them think that their Vines are more fruitful, and their afflictions le<U+017F>s <U+017F>evere. If <U+017F>ome Phy<U+017F>icians re<U+017F>ign them<U+017F>elves to the cure of others of the <U+017F>ame profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, 'tis becau<U+017F>e they believe them as able as them<U+017F>elves, or, perhaps, becau<U+017F>e their own Judgement is di<U+017F>turbed by the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; otherwi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince the particular Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of every one's Temper is the condition mo<U+017F>t requi<U+017F>ite to a good Phy<U+017F>ician for curing his Patient, and every one knowing his own better than another can in along time, none can be a better Phy<U+017F>ician of another than of him<U+017F>elf; and if dome<U+017F>tick cures be effected with le<U+017F>s notice, yet they are not le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ure and remarkable to him that would con<U+017F>ider them. That Lawyers are not admitted to plead in their own Ca<U+017F>e, is rather from their too much, than too little Knowledge; the Court fore<U+017F>eeing that they would be too prolix and hot in the pro<U+017F>ecution thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:66371:164"/>
the greater temptation to di<U+017F>hone<U+017F>ty in di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ing their own actions. Nor is exception again<U+017F>t Judges in the ca<U+017F>e of their kinred allowed, becau<U+017F>e they <U+017F>ee not clear enough into the affair in que<U+017F>tion; but becau<U+017F>e intere<U+017F>t, which is in<U+017F>eparably fixed in humane minds, might lead them to relieve their Relations to the prejudice of a third. Which yet hath not place in all, there being found good Judges who would condemn their own Child if he had a bad Cau<U+017F>e. But to attribute to <U+017F>elf-love, the defect of clear-<U+017F>ightedne<U+017F>s, is to <U+017F>peak too Poetically; <U+017F>ince the Prince of Poets believes it not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to deceive a Lover; and the knowledge we have of others affairs, hath no other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but that which we have of our own, ju<U+017F>t as <U+017F>elf-love is given us for a rule of that of our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That which happens mo<U+017F>t frequently being the rule, and the re<U+017F>t the exception; and the greate<U+017F>t part of Men re<U+017F>embling that <hi>Lamia,</hi> who being blind at home, put on her Eyes when <U+017F>he went abroad; it mu<U+017F>t be agreed, that we are le<U+017F>s clear-<U+017F>ighted in our own than in others affairs: Which is the meaning of the Proverb of the wallet, in the forepart of which the bearer puts other Mens matters, ca<U+017F>ting his own into the part behind upon his back. Moreover, to <U+017F>ee clear, is to <U+017F>ee without clouds or mi<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>uch as are tho<U+017F>e of the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, Fear, Hope, Avarice, Revenge, Ambition, Anger, and all the re<U+017F>t which <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not the Species to be calmly repre<U+017F>ented to the Intellect, which receives the <U+017F>ame as untowardly as <U+017F>tirred water, or a Looking-gla<U+017F>s <U+017F>ullied with ince<U+017F><U+017F>ant clouds, or vapors receive an Image objected to them; 'tis true, the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions have <U+017F>ome effect upon it in affairs without; but as them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>o their trouble is le<U+017F>s, and he is the be<U+017F>t Judge who gives them no admittance at all; which cannot be in our own affairs, where, con<U+017F>equently, we are no le<U+017F>s clear than in tho<U+017F>e of others.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXIX. Of the Original of Mountains.</head>
            <p>GOD having created the world in perfection, it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ite there <U+017F>hould be Plains, Mountains, and Vallies upon the Earth, without which agreeable variety, there would be no proportion in its parts, wherein neverthele<U+017F>s con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts its principal ornament, which hath given it the name of world; no other beginning of Mountains <U+017F>eems a<U+017F><U+017F>ignable but that of the world.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:66371:164"/>
by <hi>Galileo</hi>'s Tubes in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort confirmed; for by them Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are di<U+017F>cerned in <U+017F>ome Planets, e<U+017F>pecially an eminent one in the Orbe of <hi>Mars</hi>; which Mountain cannot rea<U+017F>onably be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to any cau<U+017F>e but his primary con<U+017F>truction. The <U+017F>ame may likewi<U+017F>e be <U+017F>aid of the Mountains of the Earth, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides having nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily its <U+017F>lopene<U+017F><U+017F>es and declivities which are followed by Rivers and Torrents, there is no more difficulty to conceive a Mountain then an elevated place in the Earth; <U+017F>o that to <U+017F>ay, that from the beginning there was no place higher in one part of the earth then in another is to gain-<U+017F>ay Scripture which <U+017F>aith that there were four Rivers in <hi>Eden,</hi> each whereof had its current; which could not be, unle<U+017F>s the place of their ri<U+017F>e were higher then that whereunto they tended.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the proportion from which the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World re<U+017F>ults is <U+017F>ufficiently manife<U+017F>ted in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>pondence of the four Elements with the Heavens, and of the Heavens with them<U+017F>elves, yea in all compounds which re<U+017F>ult from tho<U+017F>e Elements moved by heat and the Cele<U+017F>tial influences, without fancying a craggy Earth from the beginning, to the prejudice of the perfection which is found in the Spherical Figure, which God hath al<U+017F>o pourtray'd in all his works, which ob<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame exactly or come as near it as their u<U+017F>e will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; as is <U+017F>een particularly in the fabrick of Man's Body, his ma<U+017F>ter-piece, whereof all the original parts have <U+017F>omewhat of the Spherical or Cylindrical Figure, which is the production of a Circle. And if the other Elements of Fire, Air, and Water, are ab<U+017F>olutely round and cannot be otherwi<U+017F>e conceived, though their con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence be fluid, and as <U+017F>uch more ea<U+017F>ily mutable in figure; 'tis much more likely that the earth had that exactly round figure at the beginning; otherwi<U+017F>e the Waters could not have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it as they did, <U+017F>ince not being dimini<U+017F>hed from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World till this time, they are not at this day ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of covering it. 'Tis certain then that God gave the Earth that Spherical form, it being to <U+017F>erve for the bulk and Centre to all the other Elements, by means of which roundne<U+017F>s the Water covered it equally, but when it was time to render the Earth habitable to Animals, and for that end to di<U+017F>cover a part of it, it was to be rendered more hollow in <U+017F>ome places and more elevated in others, <U+017F>ince there is no Mountain without a Valley, nor on the contrary. Afterwards it came to pa<U+017F>s that the Rain wa<U+017F>hed away what<U+017F>oever was fat, and unctuous in tho<U+017F>e higher places, and carrying it into Brooks and Rivers, and thence into the Sea, this Sea by the impetuo<U+017F>ity of his waves makes great abyffes in <U+017F>ome places and banks of <U+017F>and in others; but the great and notable change happened in the univer<U+017F>al De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge when the many Gulfs below and Windows on high, as the Scripture <U+017F>peaks, overflowed the whole Earth for forty days and forty nights together; the Earth being thus become a Sea was in a manner new <U+017F>haped by the torrents of the waters, and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:66371:165"/>
the violence of the <U+017F>ame waves, which made Aby<U+017F><U+017F>es in <U+017F>ome places and Mountains in others, according as the Earth happened to be more or le<U+017F>s compact, and apt for re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. Which is yet ea<U+017F>ier to be conceived of Rocks which being unapt to be mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by either that univer<U+017F>al rovage of waters, or torrents <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perven'd in four thou<U+017F>and years <U+017F>ince, they remain intire and appear at this day as <U+017F>upercilious as ever over the more depre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed parts round about.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ome Mountains were produced at the Creation, others <U+017F>ince, partly by Rains and Torrents, partly by Winds and Earth-quakes, which have al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ometimes levell'd Hills and reduced them into Valleys; <U+017F>o that you cannot a<U+017F><U+017F>ign one certain or general cau<U+017F>e of all. For there is no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on to believe that the ravages of waters have produced Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, then that they have levell'd and filled Valleys with their <U+017F>oil; as 'tis ordinarily <U+017F>een that the fatte<U+017F>t portion of Mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous places is wa<U+017F>hed away by Rain into Valleys, and fertilizes the <U+017F>ame. And the <U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s of the Earth compared to the re<U+017F>t of the world permits not its inequalities to make any notable di<U+017F>proportion in it, or hinder it from being called Round; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Eclip<U+017F>es cau<U+017F>ed by the <U+017F>hadow of the Earth, which <U+017F>he <U+017F>ends as regularly towards Heaven as if <U+017F>he were perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the waters of the Sea, from which, according to the Scripture, all waters i<U+017F><U+017F>ue and return thither, impetuou<U+017F>ly entring into the caverns of the Earth go winding along there till they find re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, whereby their violence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled makes the Earth ri<U+017F>e in <U+017F>ome places and <U+017F>o forms Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; which therefore are more frequent on the Sea-coa<U+017F>ts then el<U+017F>ewhere, and <U+017F>eldom further from the <U+017F>ame then a hundred and fifty Leagues. Now that the Sea is higher then the Earth the Scripture notes, and tho<U+017F>e that travel upon the Sea ob<U+017F>erve the truth of <hi>Gene<U+017F>is</hi> which <U+017F>aith that the waters were gathered together on a heap. For being remote from a Port at <U+017F>uch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance as would otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>uffer the <U+017F>ame to be <U+017F>een, the ri<U+017F>ing of the interpo<U+017F>ed waters intercepts the view thereof.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, 'Tis ea<U+017F>ie to conceive how waters running underground make breaches and aby<U+017F><U+017F>es, <U+017F>uch as that at <hi>Rome,</hi> into which <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf, and al<U+017F>o in many other places even in our time wherein a Town of the Gri<U+017F>ons was totally involved in the ruines of a neighbouring Mountain, who<U+017F>e foundations the torrents had undermined. And what is found in digging up the ruines of Buildings, paved <U+017F>treets, and other foot<U+017F>teps of mens habitations <U+017F>o deep that the cau<U+017F>e thereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attributed to a bare rai<U+017F>ing of the ground in building by <U+017F>ome humane artifice, <U+017F>hews that the<U+017F>e changes happen'd by the depre<U+017F><U+017F>ion and <U+017F>inking of the ground whereon <U+017F>uch Towns <U+017F>tood, and by the overturning of neighbouring Mountains, which in this ca<U+017F>e turn Plains into Valleys and Valleys into Plains
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:66371:165"/>
or el<U+017F>e into Mountains, as al<U+017F>o the<U+017F>e Mountains into Levels: all the<U+017F>e changes which to us <U+017F>eem prodigious, being no more <U+017F>o to Nature, who<U+017F>e agents are proportional to their effect, then when we cover an Ant-hill with a clod of Earth. But 'tis not likely that <U+017F>ubterranean waters, who<U+017F>e violence is broken by their windings can rai<U+017F>e Mountains, or <U+017F>o much as ordinarily Hills; much le<U+017F>s can they rai<U+017F>e higher the cavities of Rocks which are the ordinary Ba<U+017F>is of <U+017F>uch Mountains; <U+017F>ince our Vaults are ruined by the <U+017F>ole defect of one cliff or <U+017F>tone which joyns and knits the re<U+017F>t together; the <U+017F>and Hills which the winds heap up in <hi>Lybia,</hi> as the waves do the banks in the Sea, pertaining as little to the Que<U+017F>tion as they de<U+017F>erve the name of Mountains. Wherefore 'tis probable that Mountains are as old as the Earth, which was formed uneven by Gods command, that <U+017F>o its declivities might <U+017F>erve for a<U+017F><U+017F>embling the waters together; for to <U+017F>ay that the <U+017F>ituation of the Sea is higher then the Earth, is not only contrary to the experience of Dreiners who find the declivity of the Land by no more certain way then by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the waters, but al<U+017F>o to the belief and manner of <U+017F>peech of all the world, who u<U+017F>e the term of going downwards when people pa<U+017F>s along with the <U+017F>tream of Rivers, which run all into the Sea who<U+017F>e <U+017F>urface mu<U+017F>t therefore nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily be lower then that of the earth. Whereas it is <U+017F>aid that all waters come from the Sea, this is meant of vapors exhaled from it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Rain and Springs, from whence ari<U+017F>e Rivulets, Brooks, and at length Rivers, which terminate again in the Sea.</p>

            <p>THe Soul being the principle of all the actions, we need go no further to find the cau<U+017F>e of Ge<U+017F>tures, and Po<U+017F>tures. 'Tis true, that as this Soul is but a general cau<U+017F>e, being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opinion of mo<U+017F>t Divines, alike in all men, it mu<U+017F>t like melted Metal borrow its form from the Mould whereinto it is infu<U+017F>ed; <U+017F>o the Soul follows the model of the Body and as <U+017F>he formed it, <U+017F>o in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort be modified by it exerci<U+017F>ing her fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions variou<U+017F>ly according to the diver<U+017F>ity of its Organs. Whereunto al<U+017F>o the humors and their mixture or temperament
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:66371:166"/>
contributes very much. Hence a man of <U+017F>mall <U+017F>tature and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick hath quick and ha<U+017F>ty motions; the tall and phlegmatick, more heavy and <U+017F>low; the Sanguine and middle-<U+017F>ized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both. Neverthele<U+017F>s the principal rea<U+017F>on is drawn from the conformation of the parts; whence, the Lame halts; he who hath the Mu<U+017F>cles and Ligaments of the hinder part of the Neck too <U+017F>hort, holds his Head too upright; He who hath a great Mouth and a large Brea<U+017F>t is a great talker; and <U+017F>o of all the other parts, from the diver<U+017F>ity whereof even that of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages is <U+017F>aid to have come. The<U+017F>e Ge<U+017F>tures are either univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al, as we <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome ge<U+017F>ticulate with the whole body; or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, one contracting his Forehead, another <U+017F>hrugging his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, beating of mea<U+017F>ures with his Foot like a good Hor<U+017F>e, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing his Hands as if they were <U+017F>cabby or to be wa<U+017F>hed, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to <U+017F>peak to any one without touching him, pulling his Button, or pu<U+017F>hing him upon the Arm or Brea<U+017F>t. Where al<U+017F>o is but too ob<U+017F>ervable the trouble<U+017F>ome way of <U+017F>ome, who never end their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e but by an Interrogatory, whether you hear them? or at lea<U+017F>t by an hem! which they continue till you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer them; yea, others interlard their <U+017F>peech with <U+017F>ome word <U+017F>o impertinent that it takes away the grace from all the re<U+017F>t: all Ge<U+017F>tures words and vicious accents, to which may be oppo<U+017F>ed others not affected or repeated too often, becau<U+017F>e 'tis chiefly their frequent repetition which renders them tedious and as blamable as the <U+017F>aying over and over the <U+017F>ame word: as on the contrary, their <U+017F>eldomne<U+017F>s <U+017F>erves for an excu<U+017F>e to tho<U+017F>e who have no other. Above all it mu<U+017F>t be endeavoured that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tures <U+017F>uit, or at lea<U+017F>t be not wholly oppo<U+017F>ite to that di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which they accompany; as that ignorant Comedian did who pronouncing the<U+017F>e words, O Heaven! O Earth! look'd down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the fir<U+017F>t, and ca<U+017F>t up his Eyes at the la<U+017F>t. Whence one and the <U+017F>ame Ge<U+017F>ture may be good or bad in re<U+017F>pect of the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whereunto it is applied, and according to its <U+017F>eldomne<U+017F>s or frequency. As for ill looks, they are always di<U+017F>agreeable, di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring the proportion of the countenance and proceeding al<U+017F>o from the fir<U+017F>t conformation of the parts, For as the Arm is bowed only at the Shoulder, Cubit and Wri<U+017F>t, and the Leg at the Knee and Ancle, though the Soul which makes the flection be alike in all other parts, but the articulation is only in tho<U+017F>e parts: <U+017F>o the motion is carried alike to all the Mu<U+017F>cles; but only tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed by their conformation to receive the figure of <U+017F>uch grimaces, are <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible thereof. They likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ometimes happen upon Convul<U+017F>ion of the parts, which cau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>trange bendings we ob<U+017F>erve therein, though never without a precedent di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition which may be called their antecedent cau<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That we ought to a<U+017F>cribe to the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Motions and Ge<U+017F>tures of the Body, which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing according as they <U+017F>uit with that of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:66371:166"/>
Hence Fools and Children who<U+017F>e judgment is irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, are plea<U+017F>ed with <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>uch ge<U+017F>ticulations and the grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Jack-puddings, which di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e the more judicious. So that as there is one beauty ab<U+017F>olutely <U+017F>uch and another re<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and in compari<U+017F>on of tho<U+017F>e who judge differently thereof according as they find it in them<U+017F>elves (whence the Africans paint the Devil white becau<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves are black, and the Northern people paint him black becau<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves are white:) <U+017F>o there are Ge<U+017F>tures and Motions purely and <U+017F>imply becoming, hone<U+017F>t and agreeable; others <U+017F>uch only by opinion of the beholders, as are the Modes of Salutation; and la<U+017F>tly, others ab<U+017F>olutely bad as Frowning, Winking, biting the Lip, putting out the Tongue, holding the Head too upright or crooked, beating of mea<U+017F>ures with the Fingers; in <U+017F>hort, making any other di<U+017F>orderly Ge<U+017F>ture. All which defects (as they are oppo<U+017F>ite to perfections which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in a right <U+017F>ituation of all the parts without affectation) proceed from the Phan<U+017F>ie either <U+017F>ound or depraved. Which happens either naturally or through imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The fir<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>e hath place in Children who from their birth are inclined to <U+017F>ome motions and di<U+017F>tortions of their Mu<U+017F>cles; which being double, if one become weaker and its Antagoni<U+017F>t too <U+017F>hort it draws the part whereto it gives motion out of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <U+017F>eat, as is <U+017F>een in tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>quint. The <U+017F>econd is ob<U+017F>erved in Children <U+017F>omewhat bigger, who beholding <U+017F>ome Ge<U+017F>ture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, render the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>o familiar to them<U+017F>elves, that at length it becomes natural to them. Hence the prohibition of Mothers give their Children not to counterfeit the vices their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions bodies, is not void even of natural rea<U+017F>on; becau<U+017F>e the Phan<U+017F>ie is <U+017F>tronger in a weak Mind, and when the Memory is unfurni<U+017F>hed or other <U+017F>pecies; whence the Phan<U+017F>ies of Women are more powerful then tho<U+017F>e of Men. The Minds of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being weak, and re<U+017F>iding in <U+017F>oft pliant Bodies, more ea<U+017F>ily admit any idea's once conceiv'd: And as a Language is more ea<U+017F>ily learn'd by U<U+017F>e then by Precepts, <U+017F>o example is Extreamly prevalent, and <U+017F>weetly in<U+017F>inuating into the Phan<U+017F>ie by the Sen<U+017F>es diffu<U+017F>es its influence over the whole Body.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That if the Soul be an harmony as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure it takes therein <U+017F>eems to intimate, we need <U+017F>eek no other cau<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>everal motions and cadences of the Body which it animates. 'Tis the Soul which moves all the Nerves of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and carries to all the parts <U+017F>uch portion as <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>es of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits proper to move them, whereby like a player upon a Lute or <U+017F>ome other In<U+017F>trument <U+017F>he makes what <U+017F>tring <U+017F>ound <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>es, <U+017F>tretching one and loo<U+017F>ening another. And as Mu<U+017F>ick is <U+017F>uch as the Quirre<U+017F>ter plea<U+017F>es to make it, delighting the Ear if it be proportionate thereunto and procuring the Mu<U+017F>itian the repute of <U+017F>kilfulne<U+017F>s; if not, the contrary happens: <U+017F>o the Soul imprints upon the Body one figure or another which make a good or bad grace, in<U+017F>omuch that oftentimes gracefulne<U+017F>s is
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:66371:167"/>
more e<U+017F>teemed than Beauty, unle<U+017F>s it may be better <U+017F>aid to be part thereof; for want of which, beautiful per<U+017F>ons re<U+017F>emble inanimate Statues or Pictures. But as true Beauty is wholly natural, and an Enemy to Artifice, <U+017F>o the Soul ows to its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and fir<U+017F>t temper, the good or po<U+017F>ture which it gives its Body; and there is as much difference between natural gracefulne<U+017F>s and affected po<U+017F>tures, as between the Life and the Picture, truth and appearance; yea, the <U+017F>ole <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of affectation offends us. Moreover, a Clown <U+017F>eldom becomes Courtly, and whatever pains be be<U+017F>towed in teaching him good Carriage, yet <U+017F>till his defects appear through his con<U+017F>traint; as on the contrary, among<U+017F>t Shepherds mo<U+017F>t remote from the civilities of the Court, we <U+017F>ee gentilene<U+017F>s and dexterities; which manife<U+017F>t that good carriage, or Ge<U+017F>tures are purely natural.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That in the Ge<U+017F>tures and Motions of the Body, two principles mu<U+017F>t be acknowledged, one natural and the other accidental. The former is founded in the <U+017F>tructure and compo<U+017F>ition of every one's Body, the diver<U+017F>ity whereof produceth, with that of the <U+017F>pirits, humors, and manners, all the Actions and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions which depend thereon, the true motive cau<U+017F>es of our Ge<U+017F>tures and Carriages. Hence he that <U+017F>uffers pain frowns, he that repents bites his Lip or Fingers; he that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires <U+017F>omething, and dares not expre<U+017F>s it, <U+017F>hrugs his <U+017F>houlders; he that mu<U+017F>es deeply turns his Eyes inward, and bites the end of his Pen or Nails. The accidental principle is imitation, which, next to Nature, is the mo<U+017F>t efficacious cau<U+017F>e, and acts mo<U+017F>t in us; Man being born for imitation more than any other Creatures, as appears in that <U+017F>carce five or <U+017F>ix Species of Birds imitate our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the Ape alone our Ge<U+017F>tures; we, on the contrary, imitate not only the voices of all Animals, but al<U+017F>o all their Actions: And therefore as it cannot be denied that Nature contributes to our Ge<U+017F>tures, <U+017F>o neither can it be doubted that Imitation hath a power therein.</p>

            <p>IF Antiquity had not had Errors, the cau<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e who prefer the <U+017F>tudy of the Evening before that of the Morning, would be very de<U+017F>perate. But Rea<U+017F>ons having more force here than the Authorities of Pedagogues, who hold <hi>Aurora</hi> the friend of the Mu<U+017F>es, only to the end that their Scholars ri<U+017F>ing betimes in the Morning, them<U+017F>elves may have the more time left after their exerci<U+017F>es; I conceive the Evening much more fit for any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:66371:167"/>
of the Mind, than any other part of the day; the Morning leaving not only the fir<U+017F>t and more common wayes full of Excrements, but al<U+017F>o all the Ventricles of the Brain wherein the Spirits are elaborated, and al<U+017F>o the Arteries and Inter<U+017F>tices of the Mu<U+017F>cles full of vapors; whence proceed the frequent o<U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, contortions, and exten<U+017F>ion of the members upon our awaking, to force out the vapors which incommode them. On the contrary, the Evening even after repa<U+017F>t, finds tho<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t wayes full of good Aliments, which <U+017F>end up benigne and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vapors which allay and temper the acrimony of other more <U+017F>harp and biting, found by experience in Men fa<U+017F>ting, who for that rea<U+017F>on are more prone to Choler. Moreover, Study con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in Meditation, and this in reflection upon the Species re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Phan<U+017F>ie, 'tis certain that the report of the<U+017F>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced all the day long, <U+017F>erves for an efficacious Le<U+017F><U+017F>on to the Mind, when it comes to make review of the things offered to the Intellect, for it to draw con<U+017F>equences from the <U+017F>ame, and make a convenient choice: but in the Morning all the <U+017F>pecies of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, are either totally effaced, or greatly decayed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the melancholy humor, which is mo<U+017F>t proper for Study, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires con<U+017F>tancy and a<U+017F><U+017F>iduity, which ordinarily accompanies this humor; and it is predominant in the Evening as Bloud is in the Morning, according as Phy<U+017F>icians allot the four humors to the four parts of the natural day; as therefore the Sanguine are le<U+017F>s proper for Study than the Melancholy, <U+017F>o is the Morning than the Evening. Hence the good Father <hi>Ennius</hi> never ver<U+017F>ified <U+017F>o well as after he had drunk, which <U+017F>eldom happens in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the conceptions of fa<U+017F>ting per<U+017F>ons are commonly more empty, and le<U+017F>s agreeable than tho<U+017F>e of Authors well fed. For the Spirits repaired by Food are carried much further, as being more vigorous when their continual flux and deperdition finds matter proper for their re<U+017F>toration, as they do after Supper, having then the <U+017F>ame advantage that an Army hath, which <U+017F>ees at its back another Auxiliary one ready to recruit it. On the contrary, in the Morning nothing remains in the Body of all the Aliments of the foregoing day, but only a ma<U+017F>s of liquid blood, which is pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>tributed into all the parts, having its <U+017F>elf need of re<U+017F>toration: Whence the other animal-functions are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed le<U+017F>s vigorou<U+017F>ly in the Morning than in the Evening, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after Supper; Which is ju<U+017F>tifi'd al<U+017F>o by the experience of tho<U+017F>e who when they would learn any thing by heart, <U+017F>tudy it in the Evening and <U+017F>leep upon it, committing the <U+017F>ame to tho<U+017F>e vigorous Spirits newly produc'd by the food, to be more deeply engraven in the Memory. And your nightly Students <U+017F>leep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the Morning, which is the fitte<U+017F>t time for it, and be<U+017F>t refre<U+017F>hes the forces both of Body and Mind; whereas Evening <U+017F>leep is lyable to mu<U+017F>ings and tumults. Which al<U+017F>o is confirm'd by the practice of Courtiers, who be<U+017F>t of all Men under<U+017F>tand the delights of Life; e<U+017F>pecially Ladies, who by long <U+017F>leeping in
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:66371:168"/>
the Morning, pre<U+017F>erve them<U+017F>elves fair and in good plight; which is an infallible <U+017F>ign of health, without which, the functions of the Mind cannot be rightly perform'd.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That a ve<U+017F><U+017F>el which is to be fill'd, mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t be empty'd, and the Organs of Sen<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be free from all Species, that they may be <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of tho<U+017F>e whereof we de<U+017F>ire to inform them. For which purpo<U+017F>e, the Morning is far fitter than the Evening, when all the Idea's of the day pa<U+017F>t, throng into the Phan<U+017F>ie, and <U+017F>hut the door to new Objects. The Spirits like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e are then more pure from the vapors, which ari<U+017F>e from meats while undige<U+017F>ted; which vapors are very prejudicial to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as appears in tho<U+017F>e that have drunk too much, who rea<U+017F>on but very ill; and they that apply them<U+017F>elves to <U+017F>tudy after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, find a manife<U+017F>t difference in them<U+017F>elves from what they were before it; their Animal Spirits being clouded by multitude of vapors which fill their Heads, and leave no longer free pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the Spirits: Be<U+017F>ides that, Attention hurts Dige<U+017F>tion, calling the Spirits to the Brain from the Stomack, where they <U+017F>hould be to concoct the food; whence follows imperfect <U+017F>anguification, te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by palene<U+017F>s of Complexion of hard Students. Moreover, the Soul being Light, delights more to exerci<U+017F>e its functions in the day than in the night, who<U+017F>e darkne<U+017F>s <U+017F>addens it, and repre<U+017F><U+017F>es its beams; whence our conceptions are much more dull in the night, who<U+017F>e coldne<U+017F>s is an Enemy to all Actions, as heat (which is greater in the day) is a friend to them. And the Cu<U+017F>tom of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>tudious is back'd with Rea<U+017F>on, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that the Soul, Man's chief part, begin to take its food of Knowledge at the chief and fir<U+017F>t part of the day. And our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws <U+017F>eem to favor this Opinion, whil<U+017F>t they prohibit the judgement of Criminal Cau<U+017F>es after dinner, as requiring more attention than Men are commonly capable of at that time; and certainly they mu<U+017F>t be much le<U+017F>s capable thereof after Supper.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Que<U+017F>tion cannot be determin'd but by di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing of Complexions, Ages, Cu<U+017F>toms, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Studies. The Cholerick commonly find them<U+017F>elves fitte<U+017F>t for <U+017F>tudy in the Evening, when the Acrimony of their predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant humor is allay'd by the recent vapors of meat.

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCII. Who are the mo<U+017F>t Ingenious of the World.</head>
            <p>BY Ingenious are meant inventive, <U+017F>ubtle or acute per<U+017F>ons; He that under<U+017F>tands, di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es and exerci<U+017F>es the functions of the Soul more <U+017F>ubtly then another is <U+017F>tyl'd Ingenious. Thus <hi>Apelles</hi> when di<U+017F>guis'd was di<U+017F>cover'd by a third line which he drew upon two others, <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall, that none but he could have drawn it: And in a di<U+017F>pute, he that be<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hes a term confounded by the Antagoni<U+017F>t, pa<U+017F><U+017F>es for the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtle and ingenious; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o doth an Artificer that makes the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtle pieces of work, as chains for Fleas, Nine-pins with a Bowl ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly <U+017F>mall, Knives and other In<U+017F>truments, not weighing above a grain of Wheat. For as they that can perceive the lea<U+017F>t objects are the mo<U+017F>t clear-<U+017F>ighted, <U+017F>o minds not contented to conceive common and gro<U+017F>s things, are the mo<U+017F>t ingenious. This being premis'd, I conceive that the Cholerick are <U+017F>uch; and for the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on Southern people, who<U+017F>e Climate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces that humor mo<U+017F>t. Hence tho<U+017F>e that govern people in tho<U+017F>e parts trouble not them<U+017F>elves to rea<U+017F>on with them, becau<U+017F>e having to do with refined <U+017F>pirits, it were to no purpo<U+017F>e; there being no rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>o good but a contrary one might be invented among<U+017F>t them: But they relye upon nothing more then Faith and Religion, whereby they accompli<U+017F>h their ends upon their people, who el<U+017F>ewhere are govern'd by force of Rea<U+017F>on.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That if Ingenuity con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted only in <U+017F>ubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there would be none in making <hi>Colo<U+017F><U+017F>us</hi>'s and great Piles of Buildings, wherein neverthele<U+017F>s there is far more then in little Trinkets, which like <U+017F>ome Iron mechanick-In<U+017F>truments are u<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s by being too fine. And as he that di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hes pertinently in a Di<U+017F>pute is reputed ingenious, <U+017F>o is he no le<U+017F>s who entangles the re<U+017F>pondent by confounding things which ought to be <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. In the practi<U+017F>e of Affairs, things too <U+017F>ubtle pa<U+017F>s for Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's, and are never put in execution; nor is he accounted the be<U+017F>t Painter that draws the fine<U+017F>t <U+017F>trokes. Moreover, the Eyes that di<U+017F>cern the lea<U+017F>t object are not always the be<U+017F>t; but
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:66371:169"/>
'tis a <U+017F>ign of weakne<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ight to <U+017F>ee things out of their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate di<U+017F>tance. Much le<U+017F>s probable is it that the Cholerick are more ingenious then the Melancholy, <U+017F>ince reflection is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary to the making of a <U+017F>olid conclu<U+017F>ion, which the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Choler cannot endure; and indeed, never was there <U+017F>een a man of great parts who was not pen<U+017F>ive. And accordingly, Northern people, being more cold and re<U+017F>erv'd, will carry it above other hotter Nations.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That as to Nations, he conceiv'd that as not only the Plants, but al<U+017F>o the Pearls and Jewels of the Ea<U+017F>t, are more excellent and purer than tho<U+017F>e of other parts of the world, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o are their Witts: The Rea<U+017F>on whereof, is, That the Sun coming from the Ea<U+017F>t be<U+017F>tows the Fir<U+017F>t-fruits of his own and other Cele<U+017F>tial Influences upon the Orientals; which Influences, like the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Perfumes, are mo<U+017F>t vigorous in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Moreover, we <U+017F>ee that God made u<U+017F>e of the excellence of the <U+017F>pirits of tho<U+017F>e people to make the fir<U+017F>t and greate<U+017F>t Law-givers and Sages. If Authors of new and untrue Religions have been found there, this fortifies rather then de<U+017F>troyes this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more Witt being requi<U+017F>ite to maintain a bad than a good cau<U+017F>e. As for Temperaments, the Sanguine hath the advantage. Fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e 'tis the mo<U+017F>t healthful Complexion, and Health is the principal condition of a good Witt, which cannot di<U+017F>play it <U+017F>elf perfectly in a <U+017F>ick body. Secondly, becau<U+017F>e Blood is the proximate matter of <U+017F>pirits, and he that hath good Blood mu<U+017F>t have plenty of <U+017F>pirits. Thirdly, becau<U+017F>e this is the Complexion of the amorous, who are the mo<U+017F>t ingenious people of the world. Whence the Poet <U+017F>aid, <hi>Quis fallere po<U+017F><U+017F>it amantem?</hi> But if the Que<U+017F>tion be, What Exerci<U+017F>e or Employment hath the mo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious people, 'tis harder to be detemin'd; <U+017F>o great Witts being found at this day of all <U+017F>orts of profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions, that 'tis diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to judge, of which there are mo<U+017F>t. Some will prefer the Schola<U+017F>tick Devines for their <U+017F>ubtle di<U+017F>putes and nice di<U+017F>tinctions; others, the Rational Phy<U+017F>icians, for their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures upon the cau<U+017F>es of hidden di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, others, the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians for their curious <U+017F>earches into Heaven it <U+017F>elf; or the Lawyers who manage their affairs <U+017F>o advantageously above others.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That, ab<U+017F>olutely <U+017F>peaking, there is no quarter of the world more Oriental or Occidental than another; the<U+017F>e words having been invented only in re<U+017F>pect to Men them<U+017F>elves, to <U+017F>ome of whom one and the <U+017F>ame people is Oriental, and yet Occidental to others; <U+017F>ince the world is round, and all the parts of a Sphere are of the <U+017F>ame Nature. What differences there are, mu<U+017F>t be taken from <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e than the four parts of the world, and, particularly, from Cold and Heat. Thus tho<U+017F>e that live under the Poles, are of a different Complexion both of Body and Mind, from tho<U+017F>e that are between the Tropicks. According to which difference, the Inhabitants of the temperate
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:66371:169"/>
Zones mu<U+017F>t be the mo<U+017F>t ingenious: Cold being too much an Enemy to Life, to advance the Wit; and exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive Heat burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Humors no le<U+017F>s within than without, as the woolly hair and black <U+017F>kin of the Nations expos'd to it, manife<U+017F>t. So that 'tis no pre<U+017F>umption in the French and other Nations under the <U+017F>ame Climate, to award the preheminence to them<U+017F>elves in this matter. For the operations of the Mind, as well as the dige<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and other natural operations of the Body, require a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, not an exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive Heat. And the levity imputed to our Nation is a proof of it, <U+017F>ince commonly the mo<U+017F>t ingenious are lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>tedfa<U+017F>t in executing the things they have devis'd. But among<U+017F>t the French, I account none more ingenious than the Lawyers, who confute the Philo<U+017F>ophical Maxim, which <U+017F>aith, That whatever hath a beginning hath al<U+017F>o an end, <U+017F>ince they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Suits immortal. In<U+017F>tead of the four cau<U+017F>es taught by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali<U+017F>ts, they create others without number; and in <U+017F>pight of the Maxim, which <U+017F>aith, There is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> they make one at length in the pur<U+017F>es of their Clients.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ince there are good and bad, ingenious and <U+017F>ots in all Lands, to be the one or the other, dependeth not upon the Climate; Heaven, from whence the Soul de<U+017F>cends, being alike in all places. Nor is it likely that profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions render Men more or le<U+017F>s ingenious, <U+017F>ince tho<U+017F>e to which people are lead by natural inclination, are rather Effects than Cau<U+017F>es of good or bad parts. As for tho<U+017F>e to which we are per<U+017F>waded or forc'd, nothing can be inferr'd from them, having no affinity with our Nature. La<U+017F>tly, nor doth Temper always contribute to render Men ingenious, <U+017F>ince there are <U+017F>ome <U+017F>o of all Tempers, Ages, and Sexes. The true Cau<U+017F>e is the proportion which happens to be between the Soul and the Body at the fir<U+017F>t conformation. Whence the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t <U+017F>igns of good parts, are taken from the figure of the Body, and chiefly of the Head, which if <U+017F>harp, never makes a wi<U+017F>e man; as on the contrary, great Heads, and broad Fore-heads, are always ingenious, of whatever Country, Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Temper they be.</p>

This founder, they <U+017F>ay, liv'd 106. years, was buryed <U+017F>ecretly by his Confreres in the year 1484; after which time, the<U+017F>e Brothers <U+017F>ucceeded one another, every one of them living no le<U+017F>s than a 100. years; and in the year 1604. one of them finding a <U+017F>tone in a wall pierc'd through with a nail, which denoted <U+017F>omething more than ordinary, pull'd it out with great difficulty, and di<U+017F>cover'd a Vault; wherein, among<U+017F>t other <U+017F>trange things, he found the Sepulchre of this Founder with this in<U+017F>cription in Latine, <hi>I <U+017F>hall be manife<U+017F>ted after <U+017F>ix <U+017F>core years</hi>: And at the bottome, <hi>A, C, R, C,</hi> In my life time I made this Abridgment of the Univer<U+017F>e for my Sepulchre, with many devi<U+017F>es, one a <U+017F>ide, and four in circles. The Body held in its Hand a parchment-book written with Golden Letters, at the end of which was his <hi>Elogium,</hi> containing among other things, that after having heap'd up more riches than a King or Emperor,

of which he judg'd his own Age unworthy, he left them to be <U+017F>ought for by po<U+017F>terity, and built a little world an<U+017F>wering to the great one in all its motions, by which he had compendiou<U+017F>ly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the Knowledge of all things pa<U+017F>t, pre<U+017F>ent, and to come; and after he had liv'd above a 100. years, he render'd his Soul to his Creator amid<U+017F>t the embraces and la<U+017F>t ki<U+017F><U+017F>es of his Brethren, not by rea<U+017F>on of any di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, (which his own Body never felt, and he permitted not others to <U+017F>uffer) but God with-drew from his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the illuminated Soul of this mo<U+017F>t beloved Father, mo<U+017F>t agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Brother, mo<U+017F>t faithful Ma<U+017F>ter, and intire Friend. The <U+017F>ame <hi>Mayerus</hi> <U+017F>aith, that the place of the<U+017F>e Ro<U+017F>ie-Crucians Colledge is <U+017F>till unknown, but yet they repair to it from all the parts of the world. In the year 1613. News came that one of the<U+017F>e Brethren nam'd <hi>Mulley om Hamet,</hi> having a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted <hi>Mulley Sidan</hi> King of <hi>Fez,</hi> and <hi>Marocco</hi> <U+017F>trongly arm'd, defeated him with a handful of unarm'd men, and <U+017F>eiz'd his throne; from whence the<U+017F>e Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors were to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> where at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>ome Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards taking upon them the title of <hi>Illuminati,</hi> fell into the hands of the Inqui<U+017F>ition. This report oblig'd the Society to publi<U+017F>h two Books, intitul'd, <hi>Fama &amp; Confe<U+017F><U+017F>io,</hi> wherein, after refutation of wrongful reputations, they <U+017F>et down their Maxims, and <U+017F>ay, That the great Knowledge of their Founder is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at, <U+017F>ince he was in<U+017F>tructed in the Book <hi>M,</hi> which <U+017F>ome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Book of the World; others, the Book of Natural Magick, which he tran<U+017F>lated out of Arabick into Latine: out of which, they affirm, that <hi>Paracel<U+017F>us</hi> afterwards learnt all his Knowledge; which being new, 'tis no wonder, they <U+017F>ay, that both he and they be derided and hated by the re<U+017F>t of men. And that the above-<U+017F>aid Founder caus'd to be collected into another Book for his Di<U+017F>ciples all that man can de<U+017F>ire or hope, to wit, both Cele<U+017F>tial and Earthly Goods; the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting chiefly in Health, Wi<U+017F>dom, Riches, to acquire all which, they <U+017F>hew the means. In brief, that their main end is, by Travells and Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with the Learned, to obtain the Knowledge of all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets in the World, and relate them to their Society, and to none el<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That there have ever been <U+017F>pirits extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, irregular, and incapable of all Di<U+017F>cipline both Political and Eccle<U+017F>ia<U+017F>tical. Hence have ri<U+017F>en in the Church Here<U+017F>iarchs and Schi<U+017F>maticks; in the State, Rebels and Mutineers; in the Sciences, Innovators and pre<U+017F>umptuous per<U+017F>ons, who wanting Ability and Con<U+017F>tancy to undergo the pains of Study nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for obtaining the <U+017F>kill requi<U+017F>ite to the right exerci<U+017F>e of the lea<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ciplines and Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions, take upon them to blame what they under<U+017F>tand not; and as the vulgar ea<U+017F>ily clo<U+017F>e with Calumnies, to which the faults of the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors, not the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions, give but too much occa<U+017F>ion; <U+017F>o they readily prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the Under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Hearers. For which there is more matter in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick than there is in any other Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, becau<U+017F>e the vulgar, who
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:66371:171"/>
judge thereof, con<U+017F>ider only events, which are not in our power but only the application of cau<U+017F>es; the re<U+017F>t being the work of Nature. Hence <hi>Paracel<U+017F>us,</hi> and others of that gang, <U+017F>tarted up in the world, e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing new Principles, and vaunting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves upon the authority of imaginary antiquity. And as no Opinion is <U+017F>o erroneous but hath its followers; <U+017F>o there have been found people enough of that <U+017F>ort to make a Colledge, who forgetting that one of the faults they charg'd upon the Rational Phy<U+017F>icians, was, that in their pre<U+017F>criptions they made u<U+017F>e of a <U+017F>trange Language and Cyphers unknown to the vulgar, have imitated tho<U+017F>e above-mention'd Prie<U+017F>ts of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who made an out<U+017F>ide <U+017F>hew of brave Ornaments, which being lifted up, you <U+017F>ee nothing but a Cat, or an Ox at the <U+017F>tall. Thus all their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e is only of <hi>Aurum Potabile, Mercurius Vitae,</hi> Magi<U+017F>tery of Pearls, Quinte<U+017F><U+017F>ences, Spirits, Extracts, which they denote by Cyphers invented at plea<U+017F>ure, and apply (as they <U+017F>ay) only according to the mind of Heaven, all the cadences whereof they ob<U+017F>erve and mea<U+017F>ure for that purpo<U+017F>e: But if you look to the bottome of all, you will <U+017F>ee their Hands foul'd with coals or dung, their Faces di<U+017F>colour'd by the Ar<U+017F>enical Exhalations of the Minerals they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare in their furnaces; and yet the mo<U+017F>t pitiful wretch of them all will <U+017F>wear that he knows the great work. Indeed, this were no great matter, if the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of their Practi<U+017F>e made amends for the defects of their Theory. But <U+017F>eing chief remedies con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in vomiting or purging violently, whereof few Bodies are capable; no wonder if people u<U+017F>e them only in de<U+017F>perate ca<U+017F>es. Nor is their impertinence <U+017F>ufferable, whil<U+017F>t, to credit them<U+017F>elves, they pretend to be de<U+017F>cended from the Gymno<U+017F>ophi<U+017F>ts, from whom, 'tis to be fear'd, they inherit at la<U+017F>t nothing el<U+017F>e but their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s. For what better title have they for their <U+017F>ucceeding to all tho<U+017F>e ancient Societies, (I mean <U+017F>uch as were commendable and worthy of imitation) than our Faculties have, which are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd by the Laws of the Prince, by po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion immemorial, and a conformity of all Nations, which renders their right as <U+017F>trong as that of Nations. Wherefore I advi<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e Brethren, if they will not betake them<U+017F>elves to <U+017F>tudy as as others do, to render them<U+017F>elves altogether Invi<U+017F>ible, (as they pretend to be) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from the Commerce of the re<U+017F>t of Mankind.</p>

From which practi<U+017F>e this Author is <U+017F>o far, that he conceals even the Book's name wherein he <U+017F>tudied, by a kind of <hi>Plagium,</hi> hiding his Theft, le<U+017F>t others <U+017F>hould trap him; and the <U+017F>ame Jealou<U+017F>ie runs through all his Works. However, for Curio<U+017F>itie's <U+017F>ake, let us con<U+017F>ider what Titles will <U+017F>ute to this Letter. Me-thinks the fitte<U+017F>t is <hi>Mundus,</hi> that great Book, open to all that are minded to read in it; that to which <hi>Job, David,</hi> and many other Authors <U+017F>acred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane <U+017F>o frequently refer us; each Element whereof is a Tome, every Compound a Book, and every part thereof a Letter. All other Books are only Copies of this Original, to which if they happen to have conformity, they pa<U+017F>s for good; if not, they are meer Chimera's, having no foundation in the thing. Hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth that <U+017F>o remarkable difference between the Theory and the Practi<U+017F>e of Arts; for almo<U+017F>t all Books being fal<U+017F>e Copies of this of the World, no wonder if Book-doctors are mo<U+017F>t commonly ignorant of Things, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>olid Contemplation produces other <U+017F>atisfaction in the informed Intellect, than do the empty Phan<U+017F>ies
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:66371:172"/>
of tho<U+017F>e who either never under<U+017F>tood what they writ, or had not the gift of right expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing it. And certainly we may have more exact and natural information from the <U+017F>pecies of things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, than either the Writing or Speech of another per<U+017F>on can give us.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That this Book M. is the Book of Magick; whence many have believ'd <hi>Paracel<U+017F>us</hi> a Magician, and the rather in that they find him teaching in many places of his Books to cure di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es by words, and to produce men by inchantment in a great bottle, with other <U+017F>uch abominable propo<U+017F>als, not to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>h'd but by Diabolical a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. Moreover, we <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>ee any per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o bold as to attempt to overthrow <U+017F>o ancient an In<U+017F>titution as Phy<U+017F>ick, both in Theory and Practi<U+017F>e, but who are led to that enterpri<U+017F>e either by God or the Devil: And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual calumnies and detractions, whereof this evil <U+017F>pirit is the Author, and for which <hi>Paracel<U+017F>us</hi> and his followers <U+017F>o <U+017F>ignalize them<U+017F>elves, give farr more probability of the latter than of the former. Whence, po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e the matter, mo<U+017F>t Magicians pretend to have learnt their Characters out of <U+017F>ome Book, as, particularly, that which they call <hi>Clavicula Solomonis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That it may be Magick, and yet lawful, to wit, true and Natural Magick, <U+017F>uch as was profe<U+017F>s'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian <hi>Magi,</hi> three of whom having di<U+017F>cover'd our Saviour's Birth, came to wor<U+017F>hip him; the other black and infamous Magick, no more de<U+017F>erving that name, than Empiricks and Mountebanks do that of Phy<U+017F>icians. Now Natural Magick is the knowledge of the nature and properties of all things hidden to the vulgar, who take notice only of manife<U+017F>t qualities, and reduce all to generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to avoid the pains of <U+017F>eeking the particular virtues of each thing; and therefore 'tis no wonder if they <U+017F>ee only common effects and <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>es from them. Thus Plants bearing the <U+017F>igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or re<U+017F>emblance of a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, or the part di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed, as Lung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Liverwort, Pepperwort, cure by a property independent on the fir<U+017F>t qualities, though few under<U+017F>tand <U+017F>o much. Of this kind are many excellent Secrets, who<U+017F>e effects <U+017F>eem miraculous, and as much <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s tho<U+017F>e of ordinary remedies, who<U+017F>e virtues are collected only from their appearing qualities, as the Soul doth the Body, and Heaven Earth.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That by the Book M. cannot be meant <hi>Mundus,</hi> <U+017F>ince the World cannot be turn'd into Arabick and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; and 'tis not a Secret but a Figure and Metaphor to call the World a Book. If it be lawful to admit a Figure in it, I think 'tis more likely that this Book is nothing el<U+017F>e but a Tali<U+017F>manical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, or Character engraven in a Seal, and employ'd by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie-Crucians to under<U+017F>tand one another; and call'd the Book M, becau<U+017F>e it repre<U+017F>ents an M cro<U+017F>s'd by <U+017F>ome other Letters, from who<U+017F>e combination re<U+017F>ults the my<U+017F>tery of the Great Work, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igning its matter, ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, fire, and other Circum<U+017F>tances; the fir<U+017F>t
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66371:173"/>
whereof is Dew, the true <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> or Di<U+017F><U+017F>olver of the Red Dragon or Gold. In brief, <U+017F>o many things are compriz'd in this figure, by the various combination of the Letters repre<U+017F>ented therein, that it de<U+017F>erves well to be term'd a Book.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, If this be the Secret of the Brethren of the Ro<U+017F>ie-Cro<U+017F>s, they are Invi<U+017F>ible in all their proceedings; becau<U+017F>e no Secret is <U+017F>een in it, but only many ab<U+017F>urdities. As, among<U+017F>t others, to call that a Book, which is neither Paper, nor Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor Leaf, but a Figure; in which 'tis no wonder if they find what they plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince in the<U+017F>e three Letters <hi>Sic,</hi> variou<U+017F>ly interlac'd one with another, you may find not only all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but al<U+017F>o by their combination all the Books and all the things which are in the World; and it requires no more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>try than to found all <U+017F>orts of notes upon a Flageolet. Let us therefore rather <U+017F>ay, That Authors who puzzle their Readers minds with <U+017F>uch Figures, are as culpable as tho<U+017F>e are commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who feed them with true and <U+017F>olid demon<U+017F>trations; and whereas we thought that this M <U+017F>ignifi'd <hi>Mons,</hi> we now <U+017F>ee that it <U+017F>ignifies no more than <hi>Mus</hi>; according to the ancient Fable of the labouring Mountains, out of which upon the concour<U+017F>e of people to the <U+017F>pectacle, i<U+017F><U+017F>u'd forth nothing but a Mou<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That high My<U+017F>teries have alwayes been veil'd under contemptible, and oftentimes ridiculous Figures; as if the wi<U+017F>dom of the <U+017F>ublimer Spirits meant to mock tho<U+017F>e of the vulgar, who judge of things only by appearance. Which may have place in common effects; but as for extraordinary things, their cau<U+017F>es are <U+017F>o too, whereof we have experiences in Nature <U+017F>ufficiently manife<U+017F>t. There is no affinity between a word and the death it gives to a Serpent; yet the Poet atte<U+017F>ts the thing in this Ver<U+017F>e,

between the <U+017F>ight of a little bird call'd a Wit-wall, and the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which it cures; between the Figure call'd <hi>Abacus Lunae,</hi> and the Meagrim, which is al<U+017F>o cur'd thereby; between a point ty'd, and the Generative Power which it hinders. In brief, the mo<U+017F>t excellent effects are of this kind, and de<U+017F>erve not the name of admirable, unle<U+017F>s when our mind finds no connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the effect and the cau<U+017F>e that produceth it. Why then may not the <U+017F>ame reality be admitted between this Character and the effects pretended by tho<U+017F>e Brothers of the Ro<U+017F>ie-Cro<U+017F>s?</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCV. Of the Art of <hi>Raimond Lully.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SOme Wits are fitter for Invention than Imitation, and <U+017F>o was that of <hi>Raimond Lully,</hi> who invented an Art how to find many Attributes, Propo<U+017F>itions, Que<U+017F>tions, and Means of <U+017F>peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Subject propounded, to the end to be never <U+017F>urpriz'd, but to be and always appear ready. By this Art, which upon account of its u<U+017F>e, and becau<U+017F>e it pretends to <U+017F>horten vulgar <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies he <U+017F>tiles Great, he endeavors to out-do <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> who having reduc'd all Logick to <hi>Definitio, Proprium. Genus,</hi> and <hi>Accidens</hi>; and in his Books of Topicks, <U+017F>et down <U+017F>ome few places out of which to draw <hi>Mediums</hi> for arguing; <hi>Lully</hi> hath propos'd others, not only drawn from all the preceding, but increas'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others invented by him<U+017F>elf. This Art he divides into two parts. The fir<U+017F>t treats of <U+017F>imple terms, which he calls Principles, whereunto he hath joyn'd general Que<U+017F>tions; and this part he calls the Alphabet, becau<U+017F>e it comprizes each of tho<U+017F>e terms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to nine by as many Letters of the Alphabet. The <U+017F>econd treats of the connexion of the<U+017F>e Principles, and makes Propo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Syllogi<U+017F>ms of them: this part he intitles <hi>De Figuris,</hi> either becau<U+017F>e, 'tis illu<U+017F>trated by Tables or Figures repre<U+017F>enting the combination of tho<U+017F>e Principles, or becau<U+017F>e Arguments are compos'd of them as the Cele<U+017F>tial Figures are of Stars. His Alphabet is thus delineated by <hi>Pacius.</hi>

            <p>This Table, as you <U+017F>ee, contains three Columns, each of which hath Nine Squares, and every one of the<U+017F>e a word.

On the <U+017F>ide of the<U+017F>e Squares are <U+017F>et the nine fir<U+017F>t Letters of the Alphabet, namely, from <hi>b</hi> to <hi>k,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <hi>Lully</hi> re<U+017F>erv'd <hi>a</hi> to denote the fir<U+017F>t Figure or Connexion of the<U+017F>e Squares; and he employ'd the<U+017F>e Letters alone in<U+017F>tead of Words, which they denote, for brevitie's <U+017F>ake.

               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:66371:174"/>The Second is of Relative Terms, which agree not to all things in general as the former do, but are three Ternaries, one of the three whereof nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily agrees; for every thing either differs, or agrees, or is contrary to another; is at its beginning, middle, or end; is greater, equal, or le<U+017F>s; and is extended likewi<U+017F>e to its Conjugates, and divided into its Species: but they have no other contrary but them<U+017F>elves con<U+017F>ider'd one in re<U+017F>pect of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>The Third Column is of Que<U+017F>tions, whereof the fir<U+017F>t is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing <U+017F>imply exi<U+017F>t, as, Whether there be a Phoenix; or, Whether it be <U+017F>ome other thing; as, Whether the Moon be greater than the Earth.

The latter asks, To whom the thing belongs, as, Who<U+017F>e book is this? The fourth Que<U+017F>tion inquires the Cau<U+017F>e; as, Why a <U+017F>tone always tends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Centre? The fifth concerns either continu'd Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as, What magnitude the Sun is of? or disjoynted Quantity; as, How many <U+017F>everal magnitudes of <U+017F>tars there are in Heaven? The <U+017F>ixth is concerning Quality; as, Whether <hi>Opium</hi> be hot or cold? The <U+017F>eventh is of Time; as, When is there an Eclip<U+017F>e of the Moon? The eighth is of the means by which one thing is in an other? as, The Earth in its Centre, the Part in its Whole, the Accident in its Subject, Wine in its Ca<U+017F>k.

For Example, if you de<U+017F>ire to prove that the Intellect is immortal, you mu<U+017F>t run over the Terms by them<U+017F>elves, and examine the goodne<U+017F>s of the Intellect, its Greatne<U+017F>s, Duration, Power, and other following Terms; fir<U+017F>t, each apart, and afterwards joyning two or three together. And if you would not forget any <hi>Medium</hi> of proving, carry the Que<U+017F>tion through all the <U+017F>quares re<U+017F>ulting from the Combinations of the<U+017F>e Terms, which, indeed, are <U+017F>o numerous, that the mo<U+017F>t judicious re<U+017F>train them<U+017F>elves only to the principal and mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Subject; it being not the multitude but the goodne<U+017F>s of proofs that per<U+017F>wades.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCVI. Why a Needle touch'd by a Load<U+017F>tone turns toward the North?</head>
            <p>TO omit Preface in this Que<U+017F>tion, There are two <U+017F>orts of Load-<U+017F>tones; the black, di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>ht with little lines, which draws fle<U+017F>h; and that which is of the colour of Iron. This latter is call'd <hi>Lapis Herculeus,</hi> perhaps, upon account of its great virtue; and <hi>Sideritis,</hi> from Iron which it attracts. <hi>Cardan</hi> mentions a third <U+017F>ort, with which a Needle being rub'd, enters into the fle<U+017F>h without being felt. We here con<U+017F>ider the <U+017F>econd <U+017F>ort, which turns it <U+017F>elf towards the tail of the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Bear. And <U+017F>ince nothing is done in vain, the Load<U+017F>tone mu<U+017F>t be mov'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <U+017F>ome Cau<U+017F>e, which al<U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t be either in Heaven or on Earth, the Poles of both which are fixt. I am of their opinion, who <U+017F>ay, that under the Northern Pole there is an I<U+017F>land call'd <hi>Ilva,</hi> wherein there are high Mountains of Load<U+017F>tone, towards which, (the <U+017F>tronger prevailing over the weaker) both our le<U+017F><U+017F>er Load<U+017F>tones and Needles toucht therewith turn; becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e va<U+017F>t heaps of Load<U+017F>tone diffu<U+017F>e their virtue over the whole Earth, and <U+017F>o draw all Load<U+017F>tones, and what-ever Iron is rub'd with them towards them<U+017F>elves.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the Cau<U+017F>e of this Motion ought rather to be a<U+017F>crib'd to <U+017F>ome thing in Heaven, becau<U+017F>e in Ships that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that I<U+017F>land of Load<U+017F>tone, the Needle <U+017F>till tends towards the North, and not towards that I<U+017F>land. The truth is, there is a Sympathy between <U+017F>ome parts and things of the world; the Female Palm bends towards the Male, Straw moves to Amber, all Flowers, and, particularly, the Marigold and Sun-flower in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline towards the Sun, the Load<U+017F>tone towards the Iron and the tail of the little Bear, which if we conceive to be of the Nature of Iron, there is no more inconvenience therein than in the other Properties attributed to the re<U+017F>t of the Starrs and Planets.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That (to wave what other Authors have <U+017F>aid) this inclination of the Load<U+017F>tone proceeds from the great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the North, which is the Centre of all waters, towards which they tend. For the Load<U+017F>tone being extreamly dry, and oblig'd to tend <U+017F>ome way, when it is in <hi>aequilibrio</hi> it veers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that quarter to <U+017F>eek the moi<U+017F>ture which is wanting to it; as al<U+017F>o doth Steel heated red hot, and <U+017F>uffer'd to cool of it <U+017F>elf, if it be lay'd upon a piece of the wood floating gently in water.</p>
            <p>The Fourth was of <hi>Cardan</hi>'s Opinion, who conceives, that <U+017F>tones are animated, and, con<U+017F>equently, that the <U+017F>oul of the Load<U+017F>tone carries it to the <U+017F>earch of its food and its good; as the the Eye affects Light, a Whelp is carry'd to his Dam's teat, and a
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:66371:175"/>
Sheep naturally e<U+017F>chews a Wolf. For it matters not whether we hold, That the touch'd Load-<U+017F>tone moves towards the tail of the little Bear, which is di<U+017F>tant five degrees from the Arctick Pole; or, Whether it flie and recoil from the part of Heaven diametrically oppo<U+017F>ite thereunto? Now that the Load<U+017F>tone is animated, appears by its being nouri<U+017F>ht with, and kept in the filings of Steel, by its growing old, and by the dimini<U+017F>hing of its attractive virtue with age; ju<U+017F>t as the virtues of other bodies do. Wherefore, 'tis probable, that the Load<U+017F>tone's <U+017F>oul either with-draws it from that part which is contrary to it, or el<U+017F>e leads it towards its good. Indeed two different inclinations are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd in this Stone, depending upon the <U+017F>ituation it had in the Mine; one Northwards, whither it turnes the part that once lay that way; the other Southwards, whither it turns its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ite part. But the Experiment of Iron loo<U+017F>ing its attraction by being rub'd on the Load<U+017F>tone the contrary way to which it was rub'd at fir<U+017F>t, is an evident <U+017F>ign of <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>oul in it, which makes it thus vary its actions.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That all the<U+017F>e accounts leave many difficulties to be re<U+017F>olv'd; for if the Load<U+017F>tone mov'd towards tho<U+017F>e great Adamantine Mountains of <hi>Ilva,</hi> then they would draw only that and not Iron; if Iron too, why not before 'tis rub'd with a Load<U+017F>tone? Nor doth this inclination of the Load<U+017F>tone proceed from its dryne<U+017F>s, for then plain Iron, (which is as dry) Pumice, Lime, and Pla<U+017F>ter, (which are dryer) <U+017F>hould have the <U+017F>ame effect: Be<U+017F>ides that, there is not <U+017F>uch want of humidity as that this <U+017F>tone <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eek it Northwards, the Mediterranean and the Main Ocean being nearer hand. As for Heaven, the Cau<U+017F>e is no le<U+017F>s ob<U+017F>cure there, and the terms of Sympathy and Antipathy differ not much from tho<U+017F>e which profe<U+017F>s naked Ignorance. The <U+017F>econd Opinion hath mo<U+017F>t probability; for <U+017F>ince the two pieces of a Load<U+017F>tone cut parallel to the Axis, have <U+017F>o great a community of inclinations, that a Needle touch'd with one piece, is mov'd at any di<U+017F>tance what<U+017F>oever, according to the motion of another toucht with the other piece; why may we not admit that the tail of the little Bear, or its neighbouring parts, are of a Magnetical Nature; and have the <U+017F>ame commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with our Terre<U+017F>trial Load<U+017F>tone; according to that Maxim in <hi>Tri<U+017F>megi<U+017F>tus</hi>'s <hi>Smaragdine</hi>-Table, That which is above, is as that which is below.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCVII. What Sect of Philo<U+017F>ophers is mo<U+017F>t to be follow'd.</head>
            <p>ALl the Sciences confe<U+017F>s Obligations to Philo<U+017F>ophy. Divinity draws Ratiocinations from it; Eloquence is diffu<U+017F>e Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick; and Rhetorick is not to be learnt but after Philo<U+017F>ophy. Civil Law, being wholly founded upon Morality, is nothing but an effect of it, whil<U+017F>t it teaches us to do voluntarily what the Laws makes us practi<U+017F>e by force. Phy<U+017F>ick <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es excellent <U+017F>kill in Philo<U+017F>ophy, <U+017F>ince the Phy<U+017F>ician begins where the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali<U+017F>t ends. Now there are <U+017F>o many Sects of Philo<U+017F>ophers, that to follow them all, is to fall into manife<U+017F>t contradictions; and to adhere to one alone, is to be in great danger of mi<U+017F>taking the wor<U+017F>t. That which keeps us from being able to make a good choice, is the little knowledge we have of the<U+017F>e Sects, and the Probability each <U+017F>eems to have; and therefore 'tis requi<U+017F>ite to examine them in general, in order to drawing a general conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion. And becau<U+017F>e Saint <hi>Augu<U+017F>tine</hi> cites almo<U+017F>t three hundred Opinions touching the Supream Good, and as many may be brought touching other points of the Sciences; I <U+017F>hall only take notice of the famou<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Sects, as <U+017F>eeming the mo<U+017F>t rational, and mo<U+017F>t follow'd. And let us compare the always contentious Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatericks, and the Stoicks together: The end of the former was to contemplate and under<U+017F>tand things; the latter, aim'd more to do good than to know it; their de<U+017F>ign was Speculation, the <U+017F>cope of the<U+017F>e <hi>Practici.</hi> I <U+017F>ide with the former, becau<U+017F>e that Science which embelli<U+017F>heth Man's noble<U+017F>t part, his Under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ublime, and con<U+017F>equently, the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And as the Under<U+017F>tanding is more excellent than the Will, <U+017F>o is Theory in matter Science than Exerci<U+017F>e, Acts of Virtue depending on the Acts of Rea<U+017F>on, and tho<U+017F>e of Rea<U+017F>on not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on tho<U+017F>e of Liberty. Be<U+017F>ides, that is mo<U+017F>t to be e<U+017F>teem'd, which mu<U+017F>t render us ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed; and that is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of the Creatures in God and in them<U+017F>elves, which is to con<U+017F>titute the Beatifick Vi<U+017F>ion.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Men ought not to get knowledge only to know, but to operate comformably to their knowledge. Truth would be either u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s or dangerous, if it lead us not to practi<U+017F>e. And though the Will is one Sen<U+017F>e <U+017F>ubordinate to the Under<U+017F>tanding, yet it commands the <U+017F>ame in another. To know how to do well, and yet to do ill, is a double crime. And if knowledge alone could make happy, the Devils would be <U+017F>oon in Heaven; <U+017F>ince Divines tell us, the lea<U+017F>t of them, hath more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural knowledge than all Mankind together. Now the Opinion of the Stoicks regulating the Acts of our Wills, and compo<U+017F>ing our Manners <U+017F>uitable to Rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>eems to place the <U+017F>teps which
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:66371:176"/>
mu<U+017F>t rai<U+017F>e us to the highe<U+017F>t pitch of Felicity. Wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Curious may follow the fir<U+017F>t Sect of the<U+017F>e, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Peripateticks; but good men mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily adhere to that of the Stoicks.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That there are three other Sects which <U+017F>eem to comprize all the re<U+017F>t, and therefore not to be omitted in this important choice: Fir<U+017F>t, the <hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> who doubt of all things, and <U+017F>ay, There is no knowledge of any thing. Secondly, Tho<U+017F>e that doubt of nothing, but think they know every thing. Thirdly, Tho<U+017F>e who are neither in doubt, nor in perfect certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in <U+017F>earch of Truth. The fir<U+017F>t do found their Opinion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this receiv'd Maxim, That there is nothing in the Under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but what pa<U+017F>s'd through the Sen<U+017F>es; and the<U+017F>e being fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, our Notions mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o too; That being we perceive not the e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of things, we cannot <U+017F>ay that we know any thing. But the<U+017F>e people may be an<U+017F>wer'd, That <U+017F>ince they have not <U+017F>o much as a knowledge of their doubts, they cannot make the <U+017F>ame pa<U+017F>s for a demon<U+017F>trative maxim; if they think they have <U+017F>uch a knowledge, they mu<U+017F>t grant that there is knowledge of <U+017F>ome thing; and if of doubts, why not of certainties. Moreover, if the Sen<U+017F>es be always fallacious, it will follow that there are Powers, which acting without impediment, never attain their end; and if our Under<U+017F>tanding be always abus'd, 'tis in wor<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>e than the faculties of Brutes, who acquie<U+017F>ce in embracing their Objects. In brief, the<U+017F>e dreamers cannot be ignorant that them<U+017F>elves exi<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e they act, and that exi<U+017F>tence is the foundation of all action. Nor are tho<U+017F>e that think they know every thing much more intelligent; the former offend again<U+017F>t Truth, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; the<U+017F>e, by thinking it their <U+017F>ole Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. They argue, that <U+017F>ince the Under<U+017F>tanding is the Subject of the Intelligible Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which contain (they <U+017F>ay) either actually or potentially the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of all Objects, it follows that as <U+017F>oon as we frame a Notion, we know all things. But I a<U+017F>k the<U+017F>e Knowing Men, What Truths they know <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily, which other Wits hold <U+017F>o difficult to be known, Whether created or uncreated Verity? The former is knowable only to it <U+017F>elf; we may demon<U+017F>trate, That it is, but not What it is in its own Nature. And how many errors have there been concerning the Nature of that Sole, Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and true Being? And as for the latter, we know not the Truth of E<U+017F><U+017F>ences, but by their Accidents; and the<U+017F>e by Species which are very often perverted, either in the <hi>Medium,</hi> or the Organ. But how can we know other things perfectly, whereas we know not our Selves? We know that we act, but we know not how; <U+017F>o that the Opinion of tho<U+017F>e that profe<U+017F>s only to <U+017F>eek Truth, is the be<U+017F>t and <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t, though it ingageth us to continual labour; and be the puni<U+017F>hment <U+017F>aid by the Holy Scripture to be inflicted upon Men, both to <U+017F>atisfie and cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e their Curio<U+017F>ity. Now Action is the Life of the Soul, and that Science which keeps the Mind always awake, is ju<U+017F>tly preferrable before that which
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:66371:177"/>
renders <U+017F>o good an Agent idle, and impoveri<U+017F>hes it by per<U+017F>wading it that it hath riches enough already. Be<U+017F>ides, all Men are of this Opinion, either directly or indirectly: And Di<U+017F><U+017F>enters them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>eek Rea<U+017F>ons every day to maintain it. A<U+017F>trologers <U+017F>till endeavor to di<U+017F>cover new Stars, Chymi<U+017F>ts new Secrets, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians new Remedies, and Philo<U+017F>ophers new Opinions.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCVIII. Why Mules breed not.</head>
            <p>THe Fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aid, That Mules are barren, becau<U+017F>e every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Animal can produce only its own like by univocal Generation, defin'd, The production of a Living Thing de<U+017F>cending from another Living Thing by a conjoyn'd Principle, in order to <U+017F>imilitude of Species. But Mules cannot generate thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e being produc'd by a Hor<U+017F>e and an A<U+017F>s, they are neither the one nor the other, nor yet both together; but a third Species retaining <U+017F>omething of both. So that after what-ever manner they joyn together, they cannot make their like, that is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Animal part Hor<U+017F>e, and part A<U+017F>s; If a Mule could ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, it mu<U+017F>t be by coupling with a Species different from its own, as with a Hor<U+017F>e or an A<U+017F>s; whence infinite <U+017F>everal Species, partaking more or le<U+017F>s of the nature of Hor<U+017F>e or A<U+017F>s would ari<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o Forms being increas'd or dimini<U+017F>h'd, Sub<U+017F>tance <U+017F>hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive degrees of More and Le<U+017F>s, contrary to the Maxim of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophers. And in this matter, Nature's Wi<U+017F>dom and Providence is ob<U+017F>ervable, who rather <U+017F>u<U+017F>pends her Action, than <U+017F>uffers any inconvenience to come by it.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That there are particular as well as general cau<U+017F>es of the Sterility of Mules. As fir<U+017F>t, they want di<U+017F>tinction of Sex, that between them being only <U+017F>imilitudinary, and the parts they have an<U+017F>wering to the genitals of other Animals, having only the outward figure, not the internal form and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy thereof: Ju<U+017F>t as the Teats in Men, Dogs, Swine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> <U+017F>ignifie nothing as to any u<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>erve only for corre<U+017F>pondence with the Female and Ornament.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Sterility of Mules cannot be de<U+017F>ign'd by Nature only to avoid multiplication of Species in <hi>infinitum</hi>; <U+017F>ince this con<U+017F>ideration hinders not but that Leopards and other Mixt Animals generate, and Plants ingrafted upon others of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Species bear fruit. But the cau<U+017F>e hereof mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ought in the divers Temperature and Complexion of the A<U+017F>s and Hor<U+017F>e; the former being very melancholy, that is, Cold and Dry, as appears by his <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s; the other Hot and Dry, as he te<U+017F>tifies by his nimblene<U+017F>s; their two <U+017F>eeds mingled together compo<U+017F>e a third, which indeed, hath Natural Heat and Radical Moi<U+017F>ture
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:66371:177"/>
enough for making an Animal: but Nature having brought her work to this point, can go no further; becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>pent all the Radical Moi<U+017F>ture and Natural Heat <U+017F>he had in the fir<U+017F>t produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; whereby Mules have the Courage of the Hor<U+017F>e, and the Laboriou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the A<U+017F>s. But the Mule having only Heat and Radical Moi<U+017F>ture enough for it <U+017F>elf, and not enough for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of another, the <U+017F>ame cannot be produc'd.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the Number of Forms and Species of things being limitted, 'tis not in the power of Art and Nature to multiply them. And though it be ea<U+017F>ie to multiply them in the family of Plants, which are but of one Sex, (though <U+017F>ome are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>ht into Male and Female, upon account of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall differences); Yet 'tis not in the Gardener's power to ingraft all <U+017F>orts of Fruits one upon another. For (excepting the Colewort, in who<U+017F>e foot, when 'tis become hard and ligneous, one may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hrubs) Plants of divers kinds mingle not one with another, as trees with herbs or <U+017F>hrubs, and herbs with trees. Nor will the Pepin admit in<U+017F>ition into the Nut-tree, or on the contrary: Nature differs from Art in this chiefly, that <U+017F>he hath her work bounded and determin'd; but Art counterfeits what the Arti<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>es. Whence Painters oftentimes draw fine Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and beget deform'd Children. Every mixture of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes is not plea<U+017F>ant, nor of Medicaments effectual; nor do our Sawces admit of any ingredients, but only of <U+017F>ome that are <U+017F>uitable and proper. So al<U+017F>o two <U+017F>everal grains mixt together produce nothing, becau<U+017F>e Nature hath temper'd <U+017F>eeds in <U+017F>uch degree, that nothing can be added or dimini<U+017F>ht from them, but deprives them of their efficacy. If <U+017F>uch unnatural Mixture make any productions, the <U+017F>ame is prodigious, and among<U+017F>t Animals is call'd a Mon<U+017F>ter: But being an Error of Nature, <U+017F>he returns to her old way as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he can, and rather cea<U+017F>es to generate, than produces <U+017F>econd Mon<U+017F>ters of tho<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t. And this in Mules rather than other Species, becau<U+017F>e the Equine and A<U+017F>inine Natures are no le<U+017F>s contrary than Fire and Water. So that if they happen to be conjoyn'd, and make one <hi>Compo<U+017F>itum,</hi> the Generative Virtues then exi<U+017F>tent in their <U+017F>eeds make an Animal indeed; but, in producing the <U+017F>ame, they extingui<U+017F>h one another, as Fire doth Water; and <U+017F>o what is generated of them, hath no power of Generation.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That this Sterility being <U+017F>uppos'd, (although <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> relates, that in <hi>Syria</hi>-Mules commonly generate; and <hi>Theophra<U+017F>tus, Varro,</hi> and others affirm the like of tho<U+017F>e in <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia</hi> and <hi>Africa) Democritus</hi> in <hi>Aelian,</hi> attributes the cau<U+017F>e thereof to the ill conformation of their genitals, particularly, of the womb, which is unapt to retain and quicken the <U+017F>eed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e through the exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive heat deriv'd from the Hor<U+017F>e, the pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ages <U+017F>erving to tho<U+017F>e parts in either <U+017F>ex are too much dilated; be<U+017F>ides that, the <U+017F>ame are very laxe in the Shee-A<U+017F>s; whence Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali<U+017F>ts and Experience tells us, that <U+017F>he conceives not, unle<U+017F>s
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:66371:178"/>
after covering <U+017F>he be well cudgel'd, that <U+017F>o the pain thereof may make her con<U+017F>tringe her womb, and retain the <U+017F>eed which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e would <U+017F>lide out again. Now this over great dilatation of the genitals appears by di<U+017F><U+017F>ection; and 'tis found by Experience, that the Bea<U+017F>ts them<U+017F>elves are unwilling to <U+017F>uch an unnatural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation; <U+017F>o that in <U+017F>ome Countries people are fain to feed A<U+017F><U+017F>es with Mare's milk, and cover the Mares <U+017F>ometimes with Cloaths of the colour of an A<U+017F>s, to beguile them into the <U+017F>ame. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that both the Species, of which Mules are generated, are very <U+017F>ubject to Sterility. For the A<U+017F>s is of a cold temper, and particularly, its <U+017F>eed is <U+017F>o cold, that unle<U+017F>s it begins to generate at the fir<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>ting of its Teeth, it remains barren for ever. Yea, if an A<U+017F>s couple with a pregnant Mare, the coldne<U+017F>s of his <U+017F>eed makes her ca<U+017F>t her Foal. The Hor<U+017F>e likewi<U+017F>e, by <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap><U+017F>totle</hi>'s report, is very little fruitful; whence his <U+017F>eed being further refrigerated by that of the A<U+017F>s, they produce an Animal indeed, but altogether improlifick.</p>

            <p>SInce of the three Conditions of Curing, to wit, plea<U+017F>antly, <U+017F>peedily, and <U+017F>afely, this latter pertains chiefly to Plants; it were good that a little more curious <U+017F>earch were made into the trea<U+017F>ures hid in the Plantal Family of Remedies, whereof Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath provided above three thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>everal Species, which are many more than are in tho<U+017F>e of Animals and Minerals. And as Nature hath (in<U+017F>tead of the In<U+017F>tinct be<U+017F>tow'd on other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals to guide them to their good) given Man Rea<U+017F>on, whereby he may proceed from things known to things unknown; <U+017F>o, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides the manife<U+017F>t and occult qualities of Plants, from whence their u<U+017F>es may be inferr'd, <U+017F>he hath markt tho<U+017F>e which are mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>eful to us with certain Signs and Characters: Among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e, Mandrake is the mo<U+017F>t famous, repre<U+017F>enting not the Eye as Eye-bright doth; nor the Lungs, as Lungwort; nor the Liver, as Liverwort; nor the Rupture, as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Seal; nor the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, or Orpment; nor an Ulcer as <U+017F>potted, as <U+017F>potted Ar<U+017F>mart; but the Figure of an entire Man: And as the eminent Virtues of Ancient Heroes being too great to be comprehended by the Wits of the<U+017F>e Ages, gave occa<U+017F>ion to fabulous Romances; <U+017F>o the Wits of <hi>Botani<U+017F>ts</hi> that have been capable to write the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of other Simples, have not been <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>peak of the<U+017F>e of Mandrakes, leaving the vulgar the liberty to attribute Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtues to them. Which made <U+017F>ome <hi>Rabbins</hi> <U+017F>ay, that the <hi>Teraphins</hi> of <hi>Laban, Jacob</hi>'s Father-in-law, were the roots of Mandrake, which render'd him An<U+017F>wers; and for the lo<U+017F>s of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:66371:178"/>
which he fell into <U+017F>uch Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and <hi>Pliny</hi> a<U+017F>cribes to the Mandrake the name of <hi>O<U+017F>iris,</hi> which was that of an Aegyptian Idol. Our Hi<U+017F>tories report, that in the year 1420. a certain Cordelier, nam'd <hi>Frier Richard,</hi> was <U+017F>o per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ive in his Serm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns, that in two dayes the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians</hi> publickly burnt all the in<U+017F>truments of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s and debauchery, and, particularly, the Women their Images; and Mandrakes which they kept wrapt up in their attires, upon a belief that as long as they had Mandrakes, they <U+017F>hould never fail to become rich: which Mandrakes, gave them An<U+017F>wers by <U+017F>haking the head, or el<U+017F>e by <U+017F>peech. And there are not only true, but al<U+017F>o counterfeit ones, <U+017F>uch as were made by an Italian Mountebank, (as <hi>Matthiolus</hi> relates) who carv'd the root of Pyony, or of a great Reed in the <U+017F>hape of a Man, and <U+017F>ticking Millet or Flax <U+017F>eed in the places where hair <U+017F>hould grow, bury'd the <U+017F>ame for twenty dayes; at the end whereof, fine <U+017F>mall threads appear'd in tho<U+017F>e places, and a <U+017F>kin over all the re<U+017F>t, which repre<U+017F>ented and pa<U+017F>s'd for a true Mandrake. <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<U+017F>t</hi> al<U+017F>o relates, that the Maid of <hi>Orleans</hi> was calumniated for having acquir'd the valour <U+017F>he te<U+017F>tifi'd again<U+017F>t the Engli<U+017F>h by the Magical Virtue of a Mandrake. And <hi>Henry Bouquet,</hi> a modern Author, affirms, that Thieves <U+017F>teal the Goods out of Hou<U+017F>es, and Children from their Mothers Brea<U+017F>ts by help of it; tho<U+017F>e that behold them being unable to defend them<U+017F>elves, becau<U+017F>e this Plant <U+017F>tupifies their Hands. So likewi<U+017F>e <hi>Levinus Lemnius</hi> tell us, that 'tis employ'd with great effect in Philtres and Amorous Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Upon which account, <hi>Natalis Comes,</hi> thinks it was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in that which <hi>Circe</hi> gave <hi>Scylla,</hi> whereby <U+017F>he became <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perately in Love with <hi>Glaucus,</hi> that, being unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him, <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf headlong into the <U+017F>treight of <hi>Me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ina.</hi> Some think, 'tis the <U+017F>ame Plant that <hi>Jo<U+017F>ephus lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>de bello Judaico,</hi> calls <hi>Baaras,</hi> from the valley wherein it grows; which, he <U+017F>aith, <U+017F>hines in the night like fire, and is pluckt up by a hungry Dog ty'd to the top of the root, after the <U+017F>ame hath been <U+017F>oftned with the Urine of a Woman; becau<U+017F>e upon its plucking up, 'tis <U+017F>aid to <U+017F>end forth a <U+017F>hreek which is mortal to the hearer, and <U+017F>o the Dog dyes after his work is done. Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that this root cannot be found except a little before the ri<U+017F>ing of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> which is about the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> Which is no more incredible, than that the <U+017F>eed of Fearn <U+017F>prings but at a certain prefixt time, before and after which, it appears not. 'Tis likewi<U+017F>e thought particular to Upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> and to be pluckt up only by certain Sorcere<U+017F><U+017F>es, and that in the night; whence al<U+017F>o they <U+017F>ell the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ecretly, for fear of being puni<U+017F>h'd by Ju<U+017F>tice; as it happen'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1630. at <hi>Hamburg,</hi> where the Senate caus'd three Women who exercis'd this trade to be whipt. Moreover, they hold that this Plant, (call'd Mandrake from a German word which <U+017F>ignifies to bear the figure of a Man; for <hi>Man</hi> hath the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>en<U+017F>e in that Language as in ours; and <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> is to bear or carry) comes from the <U+017F>eed of Men hanged on
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:66371:179"/>
Gibbets, or broken on the Wheel, which dropping upon the ground, already fat and unctuous by the multitude of hanged Bodies, produceth this Anthropomorphite-Plant, <U+017F>o term'd by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and alledg'd as an In<U+017F>tance to prove his Metemp<U+017F>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho<U+017F>is. Which Conceit is al<U+017F>o <U+017F>trengthened by the production of Beans, which the <U+017F>ame <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and many others hold, to be produc'd of dead Bodies; for which rea<U+017F>on he not only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tain'd from eating them, but had them in <U+017F>uch reverence that he <U+017F>uffer'd him<U+017F>elf to be kill'd in a field of Beans, through which he might, have e<U+017F>cap'd, but would not, for fear of hurting them. So likewi<U+017F>e of the Urine of a Dog is produc'd the Herb <hi>Orrach</hi>; of an Elephant's Blood, <U+017F>uckt and vomited by a Dragon, <hi>Sanguis Draconis</hi>; of the Bodies of Serpents, <hi>Serpentana</hi>; and of the <U+017F>eed of Stags, the Mu<U+017F>hroms, call'd <hi>Boleti Cervini.</hi> So that though this Plant be not <U+017F>een, it doth not follow that there is no <U+017F>uch thing; it being no more ab<U+017F>urd to credit the voice of the vulgar in this matter, than in many others.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, There are three <U+017F>orts of Plants that bear the name of Mandrake, the Etymologie whereof may be taken from the Latin word <hi>Mandra,</hi> which <U+017F>ignifies a Cave or a <U+017F>hady place; becau<U+017F>e this Plant loves to grow in the <U+017F>hadow, and cannot long endure the heat of the Sun. The fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ort is call'd <hi>Mandragoras mas,</hi> or white Mandrake; hath on the top of its Root great leavs, <U+017F>pread on the ground like tho<U+017F>e of broad-leav'd Lettice, but <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long, <U+017F>hining and <U+017F>mooth, in colour re<U+017F>embling tho<U+017F>e of Bete, to wit, of a pale green; the Flower is likewi<U+017F>e pale, whereunto is annexed a round Apple of the bigne<U+017F>s of a <U+017F>mall Lemon, of a pale Saffron colour, and full of a <U+017F>ucculent pulp, wherein are pale or blew kernels, like tho<U+017F>e of a Pear, <U+017F>aving that they are not pointed, but flat like a kidney. Its root is la<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dyes not yearly as mo<U+017F>t others do; long, and <U+017F>o thick, that it can <U+017F>carce be gra<U+017F>p'd with one Hand. 'Tis u<U+017F>ually divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two; of colour outwardly, between white and red; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, white; carno<U+017F>e, juicy, and of ta<U+017F>te between <U+017F>weet and bitter. The whole Plant <U+017F>ends forth a <U+017F>trong <U+017F>mell, e<U+017F>pecially the Apples, who<U+017F>e juice is <U+017F>om what vinous, but bitteri<U+017F>h; and burdens the Head both <U+017F>melt and ta<U+017F>ted. The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>ort call'd <hi>Mandragoras niger,</hi> or Female Mandrake, hath leavs like the Male, but le<U+017F>s and <U+017F>traiter, like tho<U+017F>e of <U+017F>mall-leav'd Lettice, of a dark green, bearing Apples as big as our little Medlars: Its root is le<U+017F>s, but otherwi<U+017F>e in <U+017F>mell, ta<U+017F>te, and figure, like the former; only 'tis black without, and white within, and <U+017F>ometimes divided into three. The third kind is call'd by <U+017F>ome Herbari<U+017F>ts, <hi>Morion,</hi> or Mandrake of <hi>Theophra<U+017F>tus</hi>; touching which, though all agree not, yet the opinion of <hi>Codrus,</hi> whom we follow here, is, that it hath great roots, a high <U+017F>talk, and leavs of a middle <U+017F>ize between <hi>Solanum</hi> and Female Mandrake; its Flower is black, and <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o is its Fruit; equal to a big Grape, and of a vinous juice: which Plant <U+017F>ome call <hi>Solanum Mortiferum,</hi> the Italians <hi>Bella
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:66371:179"/>
Donna,</hi> which grows likewi<U+017F>e in <U+017F>hadowy places (as the former al<U+017F>o do) in many parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially in <hi>Apulia,</hi> and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is <U+017F>et in Gardens: the Apples are ripe in <hi>Augu<U+017F>t. Galen</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts them cold in the third degree, and all Authors agree that they are very moi<U+017F>t. All their parts are <hi><U+017F>omniferous,</hi> and of great u<U+017F>e in Phy<U+017F>ick, according to <hi>Dio<U+017F>corides.</hi> The mo<U+017F>t active is the bark of the Root: The ancient way was to peel the root, pre<U+017F>s out the juice, and thicken it in the Sun; or el<U+017F>e to boil the root in new Wine till a third part were con<U+017F>um'd, or to infu<U+017F>e it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coction: of this liquor they admini<U+017F>tred one or two gla<U+017F><U+017F>es to <U+017F>uch as could not <U+017F>leep, and three to <U+017F>uch as were to have a limb cut off. They us'd it likewi<U+017F>e in inflammations of the eyes, <U+017F>ome feminine di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and to <U+017F>uppurate Phlegmons; having <U+017F>uch a mollifying faculty, that in <U+017F>ix hours boiling the Root with Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (they <U+017F>ay) the <U+017F>ame becomes plyable, and apt to take any impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. At this day <U+017F>carce ought but the leaves and roots are in u<U+017F>e, (except that the apples are <U+017F>ometimes boil'd in oil) but all externally, not by the mouth. 'Tis al<U+017F>o thought alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macal again<U+017F>t Serpents, and good to cure Tetters, being bruis'd and apply'd with vinegar. All which effects have made it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd; but (as humane Nature is prone to Super<U+017F>tition) though this Plant be indu'd only with Vertues common to other Plants, (the <U+017F>oporiferous Quality being found in Lettice, Poppy, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, and more eminently in Opium; and that of being proper to Women, in the <hi>Ari<U+017F>toloches</hi>) yet becau<U+017F>e its root re<U+017F>embles a man's legs, and its trunk in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort his body without arms; hence Mountebanks have by their frauds and tricks brought people to believe their <U+017F>trange Stories of it, even that it eats like a man, and performs his other natural functions. Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ture, though le<U+017F>s prevalent upon <U+017F>trong minds, becomes le<U+017F>s credible by the prodigious manner they relate it to be produc'd: for 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to imagine that any generation can proceed from <U+017F>perm de<U+017F>titute of <U+017F>pirits, and out of the proper natural <U+017F>ubject de<U+017F>tinated to its reception.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That indeed no Univocal Generation can be made after the lo<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>pirits of Sperm; but equivocal, <U+017F>uch as this is, may: whereunto Nitre contributes very much; which <U+017F>alt not being lo<U+017F>t by death, nothing hinders but, a fertile <U+017F>oil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determin'd by <U+017F>ome form or other, a Plant may ari<U+017F>e out of it; to which production fewer conditions are requi<U+017F>ite than to that of an Animal. And 'tis the le<U+017F>s incredible, if the Experiment deliver'd by <U+017F>ome Authors be true; That the <U+017F>alts of Ro<U+017F>ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Sage, Mint, and <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>trong-<U+017F>ented herbs, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted according to Art, and frozen in a Gla<U+017F>s, exhibite the image of tho<U+017F>e Plants, therein; and, if <U+017F>own in well-prepared earth, produce the Plants of <U+017F>ame Species.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That not only the means of the production of this imaginary Plant are <U+017F>o too, but al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>upernatural ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues a<U+017F>cribed to it are ridiculous; yea, tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>aid to be natural
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:66371:180"/>
to it are very hard to be ju<U+017F>tifi'd: for to be <U+017F>oporiferous, and to promote Procreation in Men and Women of <U+017F>everal tempers is incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent, becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e things require Simples of very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Qualities; and al<U+017F>o are the cau<U+017F>es of Sterility. This error of its being prolifick,, proceeds from a fal<U+017F>e <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition taken out of <hi>Gene<U+017F>is,</hi> where 'tis <U+017F>aid, that <hi>Reuben,</hi> the Son of <hi>Leah,</hi> one of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Wives, having brought Mandrakes to his Mother, her Si<U+017F>ter <hi>Rachel</hi> could not obtain them of her but upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Jacob</hi> (who de<U+017F>pis'd her for <hi>Rachel</hi> the fairer of the two but barren) <U+017F>hould lie with her that night: which bargain was made between them. Now becau<U+017F>e <hi>Rachel</hi> had Children after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, hence <U+017F>ome Interpreters infer, that <U+017F>he eat tho<U+017F>e Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes, and that they render'd her fruitful: which is not at all in the Text; and her Fruitfulne<U+017F>s might proceed from the favour of God, or <U+017F>ome more fit means than that Herb. Nor is it an edible fruit, neither did all the Women in the Scripture, who of barren became fruitful, eat Mandrakes. 'Tis therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that this Plant hath neither the Form, nor the Properties which vulgar and vain Antiquity attributes to it.</p>
            <p>The fifth <U+017F>aid, 'Tis ea<U+017F>ier to overthrow, then to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h a Truth, when the que<U+017F>tion is about things apparently repugnant to Rea<U+017F>on, which many times agrees not with our own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby we <U+017F>ee <U+017F>everal contrary effects of one and the <U+017F>ame Plant. As the pulp of an Orenge cools, the peel heats, and oil of the <U+017F>eeds is temperate: The like may be <U+017F>aid of Mandrake, which according to the diver<U+017F>ity of its Species and Parts may produce the different effects, which are atte<U+017F>ted by Antiquity; <hi>Apuleius,</hi> in his <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is</hi> relating, That a Phy<U+017F>ician deluded the malice of a Servant and a Stepmother, by giving them the juice of Mandrake in<U+017F>tead of poy<U+017F>on (which they de<U+017F>ir'd of him to kill a young man) which caus'd them to think him dead when he was only in a deep <U+017F>leep: and <hi>Columella</hi> <U+017F>peaking of the <U+017F>oil where it grows;
<q>
                  <l>Quamvis <U+017F>emihominis ve<U+017F>ano gramine foeta,</l>
                  <l>Mandragorae pariat flores.</l>
               </q>
Moreover <U+017F>ince there are middle Natures compos'd of two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, as your <hi>Zöophytes</hi> between Plants and Animals, to wit, Spunges and Coral; between Brute and Man, the Ape; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <U+017F>oul and body of Man, his Spirits: why may there not be <U+017F>omething of a middle Nature between Man and Plant, to wit, the Mandrake, a Man in external Shape, and a Plant in Effect and internal Form. In brief, we believe there is an Unicorn, though no man of this age hath <U+017F>een it; why therefore may we not believe, that there is <U+017F>uch a Mandrake as mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>cribe, who affirm that they have <U+017F>een one, as I my <U+017F>elf have al<U+017F>o, though I cannot affirm whether it were a true or fal<U+017F>e one.</p>

            <p>THe Species conceiv'd in the Phanta<U+017F>ie repre<U+017F>enting to the Intellect <U+017F>ome future Good, they beget Hope; when E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Fear. 'Tis not very hard to comprehend the way, nor how he, that <U+017F>ees him<U+017F>elf pur<U+017F>u'd by a potent enemy, betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf to flight, by the In<U+017F>tinct of Nature, which avoids what ever is de<U+017F>tructive to her: But the Mind is puzled to find the cau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>ees not, as of groundle<U+017F>s Fear; which neverthele<U+017F>s <U+017F>ometimes befalls the mo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olute, yea whole Armies, which fly without any pur<U+017F>uer. The Vulgar of the Ancients, (who made Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of every thing, e<U+017F>pecially of what they under<U+017F>tood not) thought <hi>Pan</hi> the God of Shepherds put this <U+017F>udden Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion into the minds of men; becau<U+017F>e oftentimes it happens to flocks of Sheep, over which he is <U+017F>aid to pre<U+017F>ide; though there be no appearance of any Wolf to fright them: whence they call'd it a Panick Terror. Unle<U+017F>s you had rather interpret <hi>Pan</hi> to be the Univer<U+017F>al and Supreme Deity, who giving the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of Battels, <U+017F>ometimes immits <U+017F>uch a fear into the hearts of tho<U+017F>e men whom he intends to deliver into the power of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, That <hi>Pan</hi> was an ancient Warrior, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the ranging of Soldiers in order of Battel, and di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>h'd them into Wings, call'd by the Latins, <hi>Cornua</hi>; whence he was pictur'd with Horns. He al<U+017F>o fir<U+017F>t devis'd Strategems; <U+017F>o that one day, having <U+017F>ent out his Scowts, and under<U+017F>tood that the Enemies were lodg'd in a de<U+017F>ert place full of re<U+017F>ounding ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, he order'd his Soldiers, that as <U+017F>oon as they approach'd the Enemy, they <U+017F>hould make a great <U+017F>hout; which, multiply'd by the Echo of tho<U+017F>e neighbouring caverns, <U+017F>o frighted them, that before they could under<U+017F>tand what it was, they betook them<U+017F>elves to flight, conceiving they had to do with a far greater multitude of Enemies than there was: Whence the Fable of this God <hi>Pan</hi> adds, that the Godde<U+017F>s <hi>Echo</hi> was his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. From this, Groundle<U+017F>s Fear, as others of the like nature, came to be call'd Panick Terrors. Such was that which <U+017F>eiz'd the Soldiers of <hi>Marc Antony</hi> in the War again<U+017F>t <hi>Mithridates</hi>; that of the Gauls under <hi>Brennus,</hi> when they were ready to <U+017F>ack the Temple of <hi>Delphos</hi>; that of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he approacht the walls of <hi>Rome</hi> to be<U+017F>iege it; and that of <hi>Macedonians</hi> under their King <hi>Per<U+017F>eus,</hi> who <U+017F>o lo<U+017F>t their courage upon <U+017F>ight of an Eclip<U+017F>e of the Moon, that it was ea<U+017F>ie for the Romans to overcome them.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Treati<U+017F>e of <hi>I<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:66371:181"/>
by a wile, and ca<U+017F>t him in a che<U+017F>t into <hi>Nilus</hi>; which News arriving among<U+017F>t the Pans and Satyrs, it put them into an a<U+017F>ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>hment; from which all other <U+017F>udden frights took their name. But leaving apart conjectures of words, let us con<U+017F>ider the thing, and examine, Whether it be not a mi<U+017F>take, to think that there can be terrors without any cau<U+017F>e? I think, There cannot; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e 'tis as true in Moral as in Natural Philo<U+017F>ophy, That nothing produceth nothing. But as an even balance is <U+017F>way'd either way by the lea<U+017F>t bla<U+017F>t, and (the cau<U+017F>e being imperceptible) <U+017F>eems to incline of it <U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o when Men are ready for a battel, and every one thinks of the doubtful event thereof to him<U+017F>elf, the lea<U+017F>t external cau<U+017F>e hapning to make never <U+017F>o little impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon their Spirits whil<U+017F>t they are in this balance, is enough to move them either way; the fir<U+017F>t object that occurs, yea, the lea<U+017F>t word, being of great efficacy. And becau<U+017F>e Fear is found more univer<U+017F>ally imprinted in Mens minds than Courage; hence there needs le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ubject to produce it, than to animate them. Thus at the battel of <hi>Montcontour,</hi> this <U+017F>ingle word, Save the Princes, <U+017F>poken either accidentally, or by de<U+017F>ign, made them lo<U+017F>e the day. Thi<U+017F>tles being mi<U+017F>taken for Lances, gave a great terror to a whole Army; and an A<U+017F>s or a Cow in the Trenches, hath <U+017F>ometimes given an Alarm to con<U+017F>iderable Garri<U+017F>ons.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That Fear caus'd in an Enemy being one of the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t means to conquer him, Generals have not been more careful to animate their own Souldiers, than to terrifie their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies even by vain affrightments; as <U+017F>howts, extravagant arms, and habits. For this rea<U+017F>on the <hi>Germans</hi> were wont to paint their Faces with <U+017F>everal colours, that they might <U+017F>eem terrible; <U+017F>ome think our <hi>Poictevins</hi> had their name of <hi>Pictons</hi> from this cu<U+017F>tom: So <hi>Gideon</hi> by Gods command employ'd Trumpets and earthen Pitchers with fire in them to terrifie the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> Yet none of the<U+017F>e Inventions, no more than that of Elephants, Chariots of fire, and other Machins, can cau<U+017F>e a Panick Terror, becau<U+017F>e it cea<U+017F>es to bear that name when 'tis found to have <U+017F>ome manife<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e. So that to a<U+017F>k, Whence Panick Fear proceeds? is to a<U+017F>k, What is the cau<U+017F>e of that which hath none? If there be any, I think 'tis from <U+017F>ome hideous Phanta<U+017F>ms irregularly conceiv'd in the Brain as a <hi>Mola,</hi> or a Mon<U+017F>ter is in the womb; which Phanta<U+017F>ms ari<U+017F>ing from a black humor, cau<U+017F>e Sadne<U+017F>s and Fear; a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion ea<U+017F>ily communicable, becau<U+017F>e conformable to the Nature of Man; who con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of a material and heavy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hath more affinity with the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions that deject him, as Fear doth, than with tho<U+017F>e which elevate him, as Hope and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do. The moral cau<U+017F>e of Panick Terror is Ignorance, which clouds and darkens the light of the Soul; whence the mo<U+017F>t igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as Children and Women, are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject to this Fear; and Souldiers, who are the more ignorant <U+017F>ort, being taken out of the Country, and from the dregs of the people, become ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>urpriz'd with it; and by the pronene<U+017F>s of Men to imitation, upon
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:66371:181"/>
the lea<U+017F>t beginning it finds a great acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion and familiarity in Humane Nature.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the cau<U+017F>e of this Terror may be a natural pre<U+017F>cience our Souls have of the evil which is to befall us; which is more manife<U+017F>t in <U+017F>ome than in others; as appear'd in <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was advertis'd of what-ever important thing was to befall him by his familiar Spirit, or good Angel. Now if there be any time wherein tho<U+017F>e Spirits have liberty to do this, 'tis when we are near our End, our Souls being then half unloos'd from the Body, as it comes to pa<U+017F>s al<U+017F>o at the commencement of a battel, through the tran<U+017F>port every one <U+017F>uffers when he <U+017F>ees him<U+017F>elf rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy either to die or overcome.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCI. Of the Water-drinker of <hi>S. Germain</hi>'s Fair.</head>
            <p>THis Per<U+017F>on is of a middle Stature; hath a large Brea<U+017F>t, as al<U+017F>o a Face, e<U+017F>pecially his Fore-head; very great Eyes, and is <U+017F>aid to be <U+017F>ixty years old, though he appears to be but about forty. He was born in the Town of <hi>Nota,</hi> in the I<U+017F>land of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> and is nam'd <hi>Blai<U+017F>e Manfrede,</hi> They that have ob<U+017F>erv'd him in private Hou<U+017F>es, and upon the Theatre, relate that he makes his experiment not only every day, but oftentimes twice in one afternoon. Moreover, vomiting <U+017F>o freely as he does, he is always hungry when he plea<U+017F>es. His Practi<U+017F>e is very di<U+017F>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his publi<U+017F>h'd Tickets, wherein he promi<U+017F>es to drink a hundred quarts of water; but he never drinks four, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning it up again. His manner is thus: He cau<U+017F>es a pail full of warm water, and fifteen or twenty little gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, with very large mouths to be brought to him; then he drinks two or three of the<U+017F>e gla<U+017F><U+017F>es full of water, having fir<U+017F>t wa<U+017F>ht his mouth, to <U+017F>hew that there is nothing between his teeth: Afterwards, for about half a quarter of an hour, he talks in Italian; which time being pa<U+017F>s'd, he drinks three or four and twenty more of the <U+017F>aid gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, and thereupon <U+017F>pouts forth of his mouth with violence a red water, which <U+017F>eems to be wine, but hath only the colour of it. This water appears red as it comes out of his mouth, and yet when it is <U+017F>pouted into two of his gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, it becomes of a deep red in one, and of a pale red in the other; and changing the <U+017F>ituation of his gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, on the left <U+017F>ide of his mouth to the right, and of tho<U+017F>e on the right to the left, the<U+017F>e colours always appear different in the <U+017F>ame gla<U+017F>s; namely, the one of a deep red, and the other yellow, or Citron-color. Some of the water is of the color of pall'd wine; and the more he vomits, the clearer, and le<U+017F>s colour'd the water is. He hath often promis'd to bring up Oyl and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:66371:182"/>
Milk; but I never <U+017F>aw nor heard that he did it. This done, he <U+017F>ets his gla<U+017F><U+017F>es to the number of fifteen or <U+017F>ixteen upon a form or bench, to be <U+017F>een by every one. After which, he drinks more water in other gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, and brings it up again either clear water, or Orenge flower water, or Ro<U+017F>e-water; and la<U+017F>tly, <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> (which are manife<U+017F>t by the <U+017F>mell, and by the burning of the <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi>) having been ob<U+017F>erv'd to keep this order always in the ejection of his liquors, that red water comes up fir<U+017F>t, and <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> la<U+017F>t. He performs this Trick with thirty or forty half gla<U+017F><U+017F>es of water, which cannot amount to above four quarts at mo<U+017F>t; then having <U+017F>ignifi'd to the people that his Stomack, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no Mu<U+017F>cle, (which is the in<U+017F>trument of voluntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) obeys him, he ca<U+017F>ts the <U+017F>ame water up into the Air with its natural colour <U+017F>o impetuou<U+017F>ly, that it imitates the Ca<U+017F>ts of water in Gardens, to the great admiration of the Spectators, who for <U+017F>ix we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ks together, were <U+017F>eldom fewer than three hundred daily. For my part, I find much to admire in this action. For though men's Stomacks be of different capacities, and <U+017F>ome one per<U+017F>on can eat and drink as much as four others; yet I <U+017F>ee not, po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, where this fellow <U+017F>hould lodge <U+017F>o much water. And again, he <U+017F>eems rather to powr water into a Tun than to <U+017F>wallow it, though the conformation of the Gullet doth not con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t with <U+017F>uch deglutition. Be<U+017F>ides, vomiting is a violent action, and yet mo<U+017F>t facile in this Drinker. And as to the order of this Evacuation, 'tis certain, that all things put into the Stomack are confounded together therein, <U+017F>o that Concoction begins by Mixtion; and yet this fellow brings up what-ever he plea<U+017F>es, as 'twere out of <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; <U+017F>o that he undertakes to eat a Sallad of <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of Herbs and Flowers, and to bring them up all again in order. Moreover, what can be more prodigious, than this mutation of Colours, Smells, and Sub<U+017F>tances? And, indeed, they <U+017F>ay, he hath <U+017F>ometimes fear'd to be que<U+017F>tion'd for Sorcery. But the greate<U+017F>t wonder is that <U+017F>martne<U+017F>s and violence wherewith he <U+017F>pouts out water from his Stomack, not laterally, which is the ordinary manner of vomiting; but upwards, which is a motion contrary to heavie bodies, as water is. Some <U+017F>peculative per<U+017F>on that had read in Saint <hi>Augu<U+017F>tin,</hi> that a Man's being turn'd into a Hor<U+017F>e by the power of Imagination, might refer the cau<U+017F>e of all the<U+017F>e wonders to that faculty; which daily producing new <U+017F>hapes upon the Bodies of Children in their Mothers womb, may with le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trangene<U+017F>s, produce in this Man the above-mention'd alteration of one colour into another. And as for his facility of bringing up what-ever he hath <U+017F>wallow'd, I can find no better Rea<U+017F>on for it than Cu<U+017F>tom, which in him is turn'd into Nature.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Ignorance being the Mother of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we begin le<U+017F>s to admire as we proceed to more Knowledg. Now if this <hi>Malte<U+017F>e</hi> were a Magician, he would do more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous things, and of more than one <U+017F>ort; whereas all his power is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:66371:182"/>
only to the vomiting up of liquors which he drunk before; and the faculty of his Stomack being determin'd to this <U+017F>ingle kind of action, the <U+017F>ame mu<U+017F>t be natural; becau<U+017F>e that is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of natural powers. Moreover, no action ought to be accus'd of Magick, till good Rea<U+017F>ons have evinc'd it to <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s all the powers of Nature; which is very hard to prove, becau<U+017F>e we know not how far they may reach: And <U+017F>hould we accu<U+017F>e of Magick every thing when we under<U+017F>tand not the Cau<U+017F>es, almo<U+017F>t all Natural Philo<U+017F>ophy would be turn'd into <U+017F>uper<U+017F>tition. Again, a Man that promi<U+017F>es more than he can perform, drinking but the twentieth part of what he boa<U+017F>ts of, and who can make but one <U+017F>ort of colour i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of his mouth, though he expo<U+017F>es <U+017F>everal others to the Spectator's Eyes, cannot pa<U+017F>s for a great Sorcerer, or refin'd Magician. As for the ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s and violence where-with he ca<U+017F>ts water out of his Stomack at plea<U+017F>ure, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be either from Artifice or Cu<U+017F>tom alone, which cannot put free and voluntary motions into parts wherein there is none, nor procure new Organs nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to this action; and no Man being able to accu<U+017F>tom him<U+017F>elf to move his Ears at his plea<U+017F>ure, unle<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ame be naturally di<U+017F>pos'd thereunto, as <hi>Manfrede</hi>'s Stomack is. Now natural di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions are only of two <U+017F>orts; <U+017F>ome depend upon the Temperament, which is incapable of this effect; others, belong to the Stomack, as it is an Organical part; namely, a particular Conformation, which may be ea<U+017F>ily conjectur'd from the example of ruminating Animals, who when they li<U+017F>t, bring up their food out of their Stomack into their mouth: An action not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to Men; <U+017F>ince Nature oftentimes by error gives one Species <U+017F>uch a Conformation in <U+017F>ome parts, as is of right peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to another; and accordingly the faculty of ruminating is found in divers Men. <hi>Aquapendens</hi> <U+017F>aw two to whom this action was more voluntary than that whereby we void our excrements, when they importunately <U+017F>olicite us; ob<U+017F>erving expre<U+017F>ly that they were not con<U+017F>train'd to it, but by the plea<U+017F>ure which they took in it. And the <U+017F>ame Author likewi<U+017F>e records, that opening the Body of one that ruminated, he found one Membrane of his Stomack more fibrous and <U+017F>trong than ordinary. And the <U+017F>ame is probably <U+017F>o in that of this <hi>Malte<U+017F>e,</hi> <U+017F>ince this voluntary motion can proceed only from <U+017F>uch a Conformation. In like manner the<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons that have been able to move their Ears, have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd to have the Mu<U+017F>cles behind them more fle<U+017F>hy than other Men. And our Conjecture is further confirm'd by the In<U+017F>tance of the Bladder, who<U+017F>e Excretion is perform'd by the Pyramidal Mu<U+017F>cles, which oftentimes are deficient; and in that ca<U+017F>e their office is <U+017F>upply'd by the carnous Membrane of the Bladder which is valid, and performs the motions of a Mu<U+017F>cle, according to the opinion of the greate<U+017F>t Anatomi<U+017F>ts of this Age. So that what is <U+017F>o ordinary in the Bladder, is not to be admir'd in the Stomack: Be<U+017F>ides that, Cu<U+017F>tom may have much increas'd the <U+017F>trength and dexterity of this faculty; and although it have not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:66371:183"/>
conduc'd in the lea<U+017F>t to the effect, but only as founded upon a natural Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition. That all ruminating have not been able to do the like, is, becau<U+017F>e they neglected to increa<U+017F>e the natural Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition by u<U+017F>e and practi<U+017F>e; and as to the diver<U+017F>ity of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and <U+017F>mells, there is nothing therein but artifice and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That what is here thought mo<U+017F>t admirable, the drinking of a great quantity of Water, is <U+017F>een every day at <hi>Pougues</hi> and <hi>Forges,</hi> where you <U+017F>hall have one Per<U+017F>on drink <U+017F>ixty gla<U+017F><U+017F>es: and tho<U+017F>e that have <U+017F>een the Stomach, that hangs up in the Anatomical Theater of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and is capable of <U+017F>even quarts, will not think it <U+017F>trange, that this <hi>Malte<U+017F>e</hi> drinks much le<U+017F>s: As for the diver<U+017F>ity of Liquors, which he brings up, di<U+017F>cern'd by their <U+017F>everal colours, <U+017F>mells, and the inflammability of the <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> I attribute it to the perfection of the rea<U+017F>onable <U+017F>oul, which, as well as all other forms, imprints Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions in the matter; this being univer<U+017F>al, that, be<U+017F>ides the Properties common to the whole Species, there is a particular one in every Individual which di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hes the <U+017F>ame from others, and comes from the la<U+017F>t Character of the form.

No wonder then, if <U+017F>ince every thing may be made of every thing, by the Maxim of the mo<U+017F>t ancient Philo<U+017F>ophers, our <hi>Malte<U+017F>e</hi> fetches what he plea<U+017F>es out of his Stomack.</p>
            <p>The Fourth wonder'd, if this Maxim were true, That every thing is made of every thing in the <hi>Malte<U+017F>e</hi>'s Belly, even without any di<U+017F>tinction or preparation of the matter, why this Water-drinker fetcht <U+017F>o great a circuit to get money, <U+017F>ince 'twould be a <U+017F>horter way for him to make it, and even Gold it <U+017F>elf by the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on; or at lea<U+017F>t he would make <U+017F>ale of his <U+017F>weet Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and not <U+017F>uffer the Perfumers to be at <U+017F>uch charge in fetching them from far. If he make it his excu<U+017F>e, that he would not get vent for <U+017F>uch an abundance, why, if there be no cheat in the thing, hath he not taken occa<U+017F>ion of the dearne<U+017F>s of Wine in <hi>France</hi> this year, to <U+017F>ell the Wine he makes in <hi>Paris?</hi> But Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence renders it manife<U+017F>t, that the Wine he promi<U+017F>es is nothing but water, and con<U+017F>equently, he is le<U+017F>s able to make <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> into which water cannot be turn'd but by fir<U+017F>t taking the nature of Wine; and indeed there needs more wine to yield the quantity of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> he pretends to bring up, then he drinks water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ejects it.

And, if his temper be <U+017F>o hot as to turn common water in an in<U+017F>tant into <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be cold enough to make Ro<U+017F>e-water at the <U+017F>ame time: if it have any tran<U+017F>muting vertue, it ought to turn all into one <U+017F>ort of Liquor; becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame Agent never makes but the <U+017F>ame Effect, unle<U+017F>s the Subject be diver<U+017F>ifi'd by diver<U+017F>ity of matter; whereas here 'tis all water from the <U+017F>ame Spring.

            <p>The fifth <U+017F>aid, That the diver<U+017F>ity of colours and odors of the Liquor he ejects, proceeds from the tincture of <U+017F>ome ma<U+017F>s of E<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence extracted from the <U+017F>ame materials, which tho<U+017F>e Liquors repre<U+017F>ent; which Ma<U+017F><U+017F>es he holds between his teeth incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <U+017F>ome gum which fa<U+017F>tens them there; <U+017F>o that, as the Water he drinks, pa<U+017F><U+017F>es impetuou<U+017F>ly between his teeth, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives colours and odors from the <U+017F>ame: Which is the rea<U+017F>on why the water he fir<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>ts forth, is mo<U+017F>t colour'd; whereas, if the Dye proceeded from his Stomack, it would be deeper at la<U+017F>t of all, as having acquir'd more dige<U+017F>tion by a longer infu<U+017F>ion.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That Hi<U+017F>tories are full of <U+017F>everal particular Con<U+017F>titutions of the Natural Parts; witne<U+017F>s the example of the Maid mention'd by <hi>Cardan,</hi> who drinking but two pints of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a day, pi<U+017F>s'd twenty; and that of the Emperor <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who commonly eat forty pound weight of meat, with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable drink, and <U+017F>weat <U+017F>o abundantly, that he fill'd — 'Tis <U+017F>aid, That <hi>Theagenes</hi> the Tha<U+017F>ian eat a Calf for his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and <hi>Milo,</hi> the famous Wra<U+017F>tler of <hi>Croton,</hi> devour'd a 100. pound of Fle<U+017F>h, a Hog<U+017F>head of Wine, and Bread proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Such was that Para<U+017F>ite, who one day at the Table of the Emperor <hi>Aurelius,</hi> eat a Boar, a Sheep, a Pig, and an hundred Loaves, and drunk half a tun of Wine. All which <U+017F>tories ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trange the quantity of this <hi>Malte<U+017F>e</hi>'s Drink, who<U+017F>e co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly afterwards he di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es with powders hid in his Handkerchief which he handles <U+017F>o often, or by the help of a double Gla<U+017F>s, of which his Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are made, or by <U+017F>ome other trick whereto he ha's inur'd him<U+017F>elf for many years.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <U+017F>aid, That mineral waters are u<U+017F>ually drunk with more ea<U+017F>e in great quantity by half than common water can be, becau<U+017F>e their tenuity makes them pa<U+017F>s immediately into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body. And if you con<U+017F>ider that this fellow drinks on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of <U+017F>mall ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and tho<U+017F>e not always full; as al<U+017F>o with what nimblene<U+017F>s he di<U+017F>patches his work, you will much abate
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:66371:184"/>
the opinion that he drinks <U+017F>o much as is generally believed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides, though his pail be of a middle <U+017F>ize, yet 'tis never quite full; and he <U+017F>pends much water in wa<U+017F>hing his mouth and his gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <U+017F>ome too is left behind. Nor is it ab<U+017F>urd to think, that before his <U+017F>hewing him<U+017F>elf to drink, he <U+017F>wallows a bolus of Brazil, or of Alkanet, or Fearn Root, or of red Sanders, or Indian Wood, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch other thing in powder; after which drinking two or three gla<U+017F><U+017F>es of water, he interpo<U+017F>es <U+017F>ome interval, that the <U+017F>ame may be the better tinctur'd in his Stomack; which time being pa<U+017F>s'd, he drinks about two quarts of water, which <U+017F>oon after he brings up red, appearing <U+017F>o both in the Air and in the gla<U+017F><U+017F>es: Which colour being weak for want of time to be well imbib'd by the water, is wholly lo<U+017F>t when the <U+017F>ame is powr'd into a ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, wherein there is a little Verjuice, Vinegar, juice of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, Spirit of Vitriol, or other <U+017F>uch acid liquor, which is proper to con<U+017F>ume the <U+017F>aid color. And 'tis ob<U+017F>ervable, that the la<U+017F>t water he vomits, is continually paler than the fir<U+017F>t, the tincture being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<U+017F>ht by the quantity of water. Add hereunto, that 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his gla<U+017F><U+017F>es are <U+017F>mear'd with <U+017F>ome e<U+017F><U+017F>ences, which <U+017F>eem tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the Spectators; for though he makes <U+017F>hew of wa<U+017F>hing them, he only pa<U+017F><U+017F>es the brims dextrou<U+017F>ly over the water, and lets none of it enter into them. As for the violence wherewith he <U+017F>pouts forth the water, it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F>s'd, that the fellow hath a great natural propen<U+017F>ity to vomiting, which by frequent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, is become habitual to him: Cu<U+017F>tom being capable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <U+017F>uch effects, that I have <U+017F>een a Beggar about fifty years old, by being exercis'd thereunto, pi<U+017F>s as high as a pike.</p>

            <p>HOne<U+017F>t Antiquity was <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous of knowing the Truth, that when natural and ordinary proofs fail'd, they had recour<U+017F>e to <U+017F>upernatural and extraordinary. Such was the Jews water of Jealou<U+017F>ie, which made the otherwi<U+017F>e undi<U+017F>coverable Adulterer bur<U+017F>t in <U+017F>under; the innocent Ve<U+017F>tal's Sieve, in which being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of Ince<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he carry'd water without <U+017F>hedding. Such al<U+017F>o were the Oaths made upon Saint <hi>Anthonie</hi>'s arm, of <U+017F>o great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, that 'twas believ'd the perjur'd would burn a year with the fire of that Saint; and in our time the excommunication of Saint <hi>Genevie<U+017F>ue,</hi> which tho<U+017F>e that incurr, are commonly reckon'd not to out-live a year. In like <U+017F>ort the zeal of Men again<U+017F>t that horrid crime of Murder, hath made them cheri<U+017F>h a per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion, that a Carka<U+017F>e will bleed before its Murderers; (though mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>lain Bodies bleed when they are <U+017F>tirr'd) that <U+017F>o the Con<U+017F>cience of the Actors being di<U+017F>turb'd, they might either by word or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:66371:184"/>
be brought to make di<U+017F>covery of them<U+017F>elves. For, indeed, the Blood which was congeal'd in the Veins pre<U+017F>ently after death, becomes liquid again after two or three dayes, when it is in its tendency to corruption; which Liquefaction, and the Inqui<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the Murderer, hapning commonly at the <U+017F>ame time, 'tis no wonder if the Body bleed in the Murderer's pre<U+017F>ence, <U+017F>ince it doth <U+017F>o frequently when he is ab<U+017F>ent. Yet becau<U+017F>e this fal<U+017F>e per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion from the co-incidence of times, cea<U+017F>es not <U+017F>ometimes to have its effect, and to di<U+017F>cover Truth; therefore Legi<U+017F>lators have thought fit to authorize it, and to u<U+017F>e it as an Argument at lea<U+017F>t to frighten the Murderer; though, indeed, 'tis no conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive one to condemn him.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That 'tis not credible that Courts of Ju<U+017F>tice who often admit this proof to good purpo<U+017F>e, could <U+017F>o continue in ignorance of Natural Cau<U+017F>es, as not to di<U+017F>cern the effu<U+017F>ion of Blood en<U+017F>uing upon its putrefaction in the Veins, from that which happens upon confrontation of a Murderer. 'Tis better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <U+017F>eek further for the cau<U+017F>e, than to que<U+017F>tion the effect; which <U+017F>ome attribute to <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret Antipathy of the murder'd per<U+017F>on's blood to that of his Murderer; or el<U+017F>e to their mutual emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>pirits, which <U+017F>till <U+017F>eeking the de<U+017F>truction of each other's per<U+017F>on, tho<U+017F>e of the Murderer being the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>till living, cau<U+017F>e a commotion in the Blood of the dead, which thereupon breaks forth at the out-let of the wound; <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella</hi> attributes it to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e where-with all things are indu'd, and which <U+017F>till remains in the<U+017F>e dead Bodies; <U+017F>o that having a <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of their Murderers, and perceiving them near hand, they <U+017F>uffer two very different motions, Trembling and Anger, which cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a commotion in the Blood, that it flows forth at the wound. For the <U+017F>pirits, which during life had <U+017F>uch perceptions as were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for their receiving and obeying the Soul's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, retain <U+017F>omewhat thereof after death, and are capable of di<U+017F>cerning their friends and their enemies.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, If this opinion concerning the emanation of <U+017F>pirits, whether by Sympathy or Antipathy, be true, it will follow, That one who hath done a Murder with gun-<U+017F>hot, cannot be di<U+017F>cover'd by this <U+017F>ign; and that one <U+017F>lain in his Wife's arms, and in a crowd of his friends that endeavor'd to defend his life, will bleed rather in the pre<U+017F>ence of his friends than of his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>pirits are more inwardly retir'd through fear of puni<U+017F>hment; whereas tho<U+017F>e of his friends are <U+017F>ent outwards by Anger and de<U+017F>ire of Revenge: Yea, if the Murderer had been wounded before, he <U+017F>hould rather bleed than the dead, becau<U+017F>e his Blood is more boyling, and capable of commotion by the <U+017F>pirits i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the Carka<U+017F>e. And had they any Sympathy, they could not di<U+017F>cover the Murderer for want of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, which they never had; for the <U+017F>pirits which are in the Blood <U+017F>carce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve that name, being purely natural, and void of all <U+017F>en<U+017F>e even during life, and <U+017F>pecifically different from the animal <U+017F>pirits. The
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:66371:185"/>
vital <U+017F>pirits which are a degree above them, vani<U+017F>h together with life, whence the Arteries that us'd to contain them are empty. And tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>erve for Sen<U+017F>ation cannot remain in a dead Body, becau<U+017F>e they are ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F><U+017F>ipable, and need continual reparation; whence we <U+017F>ee all the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es fail in a <U+017F>woon, becau<U+017F>e the Heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits them not by a continuity of their generation: Be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>hould they remain after death, they would be unactive for want of fit di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions in the Organs. Moreover, natural cau<U+017F>es act nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily when their object is pre<U+017F>ent; but <U+017F>ometime tis known, that Murderers have thru<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves more diligently into the crowd of Spectators than any other per<U+017F>ons, for avoiding <U+017F>u<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no <U+017F>uch bleeding hath hapned in their pre<U+017F>ence; and that Executioners take Criminals the next day from the Gallows or the Wheel, and not a drop of Blood i<U+017F><U+017F>ues from their wounds. And why <U+017F>hould not a dead Sheep as well fall a bleeding afre<U+017F>h in the pre<U+017F>ence of the Butcher that kill'd it? Or a Man mortally wounded, when he that did it is brought unknown into his Chamber? For 'tis hard to imagine that we have le<U+017F>s <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and knowledge whil<U+017F>t life remains than after death, that a wounded per<U+017F>on mu<U+017F>t die that he may become <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible. In <U+017F>hort, tis ea<U+017F>ie to <U+017F>ee that this effect is not like other wonders which have a cau<U+017F>e in Nature; becau<U+017F>e though we cannot a<U+017F><U+017F>ign the particular cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es of the<U+017F>e, yet they are prov'd by <U+017F>ome demon<U+017F>trative, or at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome probable rea<U+017F>ons. And as for Antipathy, it <U+017F>hould rather concenter all the dead per<U+017F>on's Blood in his Murderer's pre<U+017F>ence, and make it retire to the inward parts. Wherefore, I conclude, that not only the cau<U+017F>es of this miracle are not yet found, but al<U+017F>o that 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible there <U+017F>hould be any natural one of it at all.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That according to the opinion of <hi>Avicenna,</hi> who holds, That the Imagination acts even beyond, and out of its Subject, this faculty may cau<U+017F>e the effluxion of Blood; the Criminal's Phan<U+017F>ie working mightily when the per<U+017F>on <U+017F>lain by him is objected before his Eyes; And the nitrous vapors ari<U+017F>ing out of the Earth upon digging up the Body, together with the heat of the Air greater than that of the Earth, and increas'd by the conflux of Spectators, may in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure contribute to the new fermentation of the Blood. But the truth is, after all our inquiries, this extraordinary motion cannot be better a<U+017F>crib'd el<U+017F>ewhere, than to God's Providence, who <U+017F>ometimes performs this miracle for the di<U+017F>covery of Murder, which would otherwi<U+017F>e be unpuni<U+017F>ht, but not always. And 'tis no le<U+017F>s impiety to deny, that Divine Ju<U+017F>tice comes <U+017F>ometimes to the aid of that of Men, than 'tis ignorance and ru<U+017F>ticity to be <U+017F>atisfi'd in all ca<U+017F>es with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>al cau<U+017F>es, without recurring to particular ones; which God employes mo<U+017F>t ordinarily for the Production of Effects, yet does not <U+017F>o tye his power to the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of their operations, but that he interrupts the <U+017F>ame when he plea<U+017F>es, even <U+017F>o far as to give clay power to open the Eyes of the blind.</p>

Fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e the opinions of all Authors are <U+017F>o contrary concerning it. <hi>Philo<U+017F>tratus</hi> in the life of <hi>Apollonius</hi> <U+017F>aith, that the Animal of this name is an A<U+017F>s, and is found in the fenns of <hi>Colchis,</hi> having one <U+017F>ingle horn in the fore-head, where-with he fights furiously again<U+017F>t the Elephant. <hi>Cardan,</hi> after <hi>Pliny,</hi> <U+017F>aith 'tis a Hor<U+017F>e, as 'tis mo<U+017F>t commonly painted; only it hath a Stag's head, a Martin's <U+017F>kin, a <U+017F>hort neck, <U+017F>hort mane, and a cloven hoof, and is bred only in the De<U+017F>arts of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> among<U+017F>t the Serpents, who<U+017F>e Poy<U+017F>on its horn which is three cubits long re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts. <hi>Gar<U+017F>ius ab Horto</hi> <U+017F>aith, 'tis an Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Animal, bred on Land near the Cape of good Hope, but delighting in the Sea, having an Hor<U+017F>es head and mane, a horn two cubits long, which he alone of all Authors affirms to be move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able every way. Mo<U+017F>t agree that it cannot be tam'd; and yet <hi>Lewis Vartoman</hi> <U+017F>aith, that he <U+017F>aw two tame ones in Cages at <hi>Mecha,</hi> which had been <U+017F>ent to <hi>Sultan Solyman.</hi> Almo<U+017F>t all confe<U+017F>s it very rare, and yet <hi>Marcus Sherer,</hi> a Renegado German, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards call'd <hi>Idaith Aga,</hi> and Emba<U+017F><U+017F>ador from the <U+017F>ame <hi>Solyman</hi> to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, affirms that he <U+017F>aw whole troops of them in the De<U+017F>arts of <hi>Arabia</hi>; And <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> the <U+017F>ame in the Kingdom of <hi>Ba<U+017F>man</hi>; where they are almo<U+017F>t as big as Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, having feet like theirs, a <U+017F>kin like Camels, the head of a Boar, and delighting in mire like <U+017F>wine. Nor are Authors le<U+017F>s various concerning its manner of eating; <U+017F>ome alledging, that being unable to feed on the ground by rea<U+017F>on of his horn, he lives only on the boughs and fruits of Trees, or on what is given him by the hands of Men, e<U+017F>pecially of fair Virgins, of whom, they <U+017F>ay, he is amorous; though others think it fabulous. Some believe that there was once <U+017F>uch an Animal, but not now; the whole race peri<U+017F>hing in the Deluge; and that the horns we find now, for the mo<U+017F>t part in the earth, have been kept there ever <U+017F>ince. And if there be <U+017F>uch variety in the de<U+017F>cription of this Animal, there is no le<U+017F>s in the horns, which they tell us are tho<U+017F>e of the Unicorn. That at Saint <hi>Dennis</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> is about <U+017F>even foot high, weighs thirty pound four ounces, being wreath'd and terminated in a point from a broad ba<U+017F>e. Yet this is not comparable to that <hi>Aelian</hi> mentions, which was <U+017F>o thick that cups might be made of it. That at <hi>Strasburg</hi> hath <U+017F>ome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with this of Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> but tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Venice</hi> differ from both, as that de<U+017F>crib'd by <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> doth from all. For
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:66371:186"/>
'tis, <U+017F>aith he, <U+017F>olid like a Hearts horn, ten foot high, and very large at the ba<U+017F>e. The <hi>Swi<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> have one, which was <U+017F>ometimes found on the bank of a River near <hi>Bruges,</hi> two cubits long, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low without, white within, odorous, and apt to take fire. That at <hi>Rome</hi> is but one foot high, having been dimini<U+017F>h'd by being frequently ra<U+017F>p'd in order to be imploy'd again<U+017F>t Poy<U+017F>on; 'tis al<U+017F>o <U+017F>mooth and <U+017F>hining like Ivory. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> who writ a Treati<U+017F>e of this Subject, <U+017F>aith, he <U+017F>aw one <U+017F>o big at <hi>Nicla<U+017F>bourg,</hi> that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embled the rib of a Whale rather than a Horn. <hi>Becanus</hi> the Queen of <hi>Hungarie</hi>'s Phy<U+017F>ician, <U+017F>peaks of one at <hi>Antwerp</hi> <U+017F>even foot high, <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>tned to the <U+017F>kull of the Animal, that it was bow'd backwards along the back bone, and could not <U+017F>erve to trouble the water for repelling its veneno<U+017F>ity, (as Authors <U+017F>ay it doth) nor yet be of any defence, which is the u<U+017F>e of horns, except by bowing down the head between the fore-legs, as Bulls do in their fights. It was al<U+017F>o white; and yet <hi>Aelian</hi> <U+017F>aith, it mu<U+017F>t be black: And <hi>Cte<U+017F>ias,</hi> Phy<U+017F>ician to King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ents it but one cubit high, purple towards the point, and black at the ba<U+017F>e. Which variety makes <U+017F>ome believe, that all the<U+017F>e are the horns of Fi<U+017F>hes, or Sea-mon<U+017F>ters, there being no Element <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of more varieties: Whereunto that Fi<U+017F>h is to be referr'd which <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> calls <hi>Monoceros,</hi> from its having one horn in the Fore-head; the opinion of tho<U+017F>e that think the Unicorn was the Rhinoceros. <hi>Pliny,</hi> after <hi>Cte<U+017F>ias,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that <U+017F>ome Oxen in <hi>India,</hi> have but one horn, and are not cloven hoof'd. <hi>Aelian</hi> and <hi>Oppian</hi> report the like of others in <hi>Aonia</hi>; and <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> of others in the Hercinian Fore<U+017F>t; and <hi>Lewis Barthema,</hi> that he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>uch Cows in <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> In brief, as 'tis agreed that there are Animals with one Horn, <U+017F>o 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to know which is that whereunto Antiquity gave the Appellation of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn by way of excellence; which incertainty, tho<U+017F>e Kings and States that have them te<U+017F>tifie, by keeping them in their trea<U+017F>ures for <U+017F>hew only, not for u<U+017F>e, and not making them into drinking ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which (according to <hi>Aelian</hi>) retun'd the hurtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of all Poy<U+017F>ons. Add hereunto, that 'tis not credible the <hi>Romans</hi> who <U+017F>ubdu'd mo<U+017F>t of the acce<U+017F><U+017F>ible world, and were very careful to delight their people with <U+017F>pectacles of the rare<U+017F>t bea<U+017F>ts, would not have forgot to <U+017F>hew them Unicorns, if there had been any. But were there a Unicorn, I <U+017F>hould not e<U+017F>teem its virtues <U+017F>uch as they are de<U+017F>crib'd, being countenanc'd by the authority neither of <hi>Galen</hi> nor <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> So that <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth's Phy<U+017F>ician <U+017F>aid, he would have taken away the cu<U+017F>tom of putting a piece of this horn into the King's Cup, but that it was good to leave an opinion of its virtue in the minds of the vulgar. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the marks given of it are like all the re<U+017F>t, equivocal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and ridiculous. For they <U+017F>ay, a true is di<U+017F>cern'd from a fal<U+017F>e by the ebullition the true one cau<U+017F>eth in water when ca<U+017F>t thereinto; which neverthele<U+017F>s all porous Bodies do, as burnt bones, lime, brick, and <U+017F>uch other things wherein there are many
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:66371:186"/>
cavities. Others di<U+017F>cover it by giving <U+017F>ome of it in powder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a do<U+017F>e of Ar<U+017F>enick to a Cock, or a little Dog; whom it will not only <U+017F>ecure, but almo<U+017F>t revive when dead, and yet all that can be gather'd upon trial, is, that we <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e Animals that have taken this antidote, die more <U+017F>lowly than others. Which is <U+017F>uppos'd to happen by the a<U+017F>triction that all horn cau<U+017F>eth in the mouth of the Stomack, and the other Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, whence the exhalation of the Spirits is retarded. The trial of <U+017F>ome Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericks is yet more ridiculous; they boa<U+017F>t, that if a Circle be de<U+017F>crib'd with a piece of this horn upon a Table, and an Adder or Spider laid in the middle of it, they can never come out of it; and, that the<U+017F>e Animals die, if only held a quarter of an hour under the <U+017F>hadow of this Horn. Some add, that this horn <U+017F>weats in the pre<U+017F>ence of poy<U+017F>on, which <U+017F>eems ab<U+017F>urd: becau<U+017F>e in this ca<U+017F>e the counter-poi<U+017F>on <U+017F>uffers from the poy<U+017F>on, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently, mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t active of the two. In brief, the<U+017F>e numerous Contradictions, Impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties make me conclude this Story of the Unicorn a meer Fiction.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid. If the Verity of things were <U+017F>haken by the fal<U+017F>e conceits others have of them, there would be no Phy<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, becau<U+017F>e there are oftentimes ignorant ones; no point of Right, becau<U+017F>e many know it not; no true Deluge, becau<U+017F>e the Poets feign'd that of <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha</hi>; no true Religion, becau<U+017F>e the Pagans and others have had fal<U+017F>e ones. On the contrary, as the Romances, concerning <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> were built upon the truth of his admirable exploits, <U+017F>o 'tis credible, that the marvellous effects of the Unicorn's Horn have given both great and <U+017F>mall occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>peak of it, and out of ignorance of the Truth to feign much more then the Truth concerning it. The objection taken from the verity of de<U+017F>criptions of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn, and from that which is ob<U+017F>erv'd in <U+017F>everal Horns, (of about twenty whereof found in the trea<U+017F>ures of Princes and States of <hi>Europe</hi> there are not two altogether alike) is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding; <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>ame may be <U+017F>aid of mo<U+017F>t other Animals, who according to the diver<U+017F>ity of Climats change their colour, and oftentimes <U+017F>hape too, yea, in one and the <U+017F>ame place, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer according to their Ages. Moreover, the Error is very excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>able in Authors that have treated of the Unicorn, in taking (as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> doth) the Greek name <hi>Monoceros,</hi> and the Latin <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicornis,</hi> for a Noun Adjective applicable to every <U+017F>ort of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals that have but one Horn, as many have not. Some indeed have confounded <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> with <hi>Monoceros</hi> through the re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of their cadence, which <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> the Romans had in their Spectacles or Shows, and is de<U+017F>crib'd by <hi>Martial</hi> <U+017F>o furious, that he threw a Bear up into the Air, as one would do a Ball: But it follows not, that they had no Unicorns in their Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theaters, becau<U+017F>e there is no mention made of any; an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from Negative Authority not being demon<U+017F>trative:
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:66371:187"/>
and, granting it was unknown to them, it follows not thence that there is no <U+017F>uch thing in Nature; not only becau<U+017F>e they knew not the greate<U+017F>t part of the World, but al<U+017F>o, becau<U+017F>e this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is repre<U+017F>ented <U+017F>o furious, that it cannot be taken alive; e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in its perfect Age, being fierce even to tho<U+017F>e of its own Species of either Sex, and only acco<U+017F>table at the time of their Copulation. <hi>Philo</hi> after <hi>Aelian</hi> <U+017F>aith, That the Brachmans call it <hi>Cartazonon,</hi> that 'tis of the bigne<U+017F>s of a Hor<U+017F>e, of a bay co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, very nimble of body, e<U+017F>pecially of the legs, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out joints; that it hath the tail of a Boar, one horn between the eyes, black, <U+017F>treak'd like a Snail, and ending in a very <U+017F>harp point, two cubits long; that it hath a hoar<U+017F>e voice, is le<U+017F>s furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards other Bea<U+017F>ts, than to tho<U+017F>e of its own Species, with whom it fights ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly, unle<U+017F>s when they are at rut. There are al<U+017F>o ancient Medals repre<U+017F>enting this Animal putting his horn into a Cup; which 'tis thought were <hi>Alexander</hi>'s. <hi>Aeneas Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> affirm, That Unicorns are found in the Mountains of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Cathay</hi>; though the marks this latter give them, agree better to the <hi>Rhinoceros:</hi> But the<U+017F>e Authorities are not con<U+017F>iderable in re<U+017F>pect of that of the H. Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 'tis <U+017F>aid, Deut. 28. <hi>His horns <U+017F>hall be like that of the <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nicorn:</hi> and P<U+017F>al. 22. <hi>Deliver me, O God, from the Lion's mouth, thou ha<U+017F>t heard me al<U+017F>o from among the horns of the <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nicorns:</hi> and P<U+017F>al. 29. <hi>He maketh</hi> Lebanon <hi>and</hi> Sirion <hi>to <U+017F>kip like a young <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nicorn</hi>; and P<U+017F>al. 92. <hi>My horns <U+017F>halt thou exalt like the horn of an <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nicorn</hi>; and I<U+017F>aiah 34. <hi>The <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nicorns <U+017F>hall come down with them, and the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks with the bulls. Job</hi> al<U+017F>o <U+017F>peaks of it, chap. 39. Add to the<U+017F>e Authorities the experience and example of <U+017F>o many Kings and States, who would not think their trea<U+017F>ure well furni<U+017F>h'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s they had an Unicorn's horn. For, the matter that makes teeth, being transferr'd to the generation of horns, and <U+017F>o fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <U+017F>ublim'd; 'tis certain, that all Horns have an Alexiterical Vertue, by which they re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t Feavers, cure Fluxes of the belly, kill Worms, and <U+017F>erve for many other Remedies to Man: but when this already great Vertue comes to be united into one <U+017F>ingle Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, as it happens in the Unicorn, the <U+017F>ame is mightily augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And 'tis too much detraction from the power of Nature, to deny <U+017F>uch Vertue to be found in inanimate Bodies, as in the Serpentine Tongues found in the Caves of <hi>Malta,</hi> <U+017F>ealed Earths, and Minerals, <U+017F>uch as tho<U+017F>e they call for that rea<U+017F>on <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nicornu minerale,</hi> not becau<U+017F>e taken from Unicorn's bury'd under ground ever <U+017F>ince the time of the Deluge, but becau<U+017F>e of their Re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in Vertues, Properties, and outward Figure: and indeed there is <U+017F>o much of this Mineral Unicorn's horn, and Mineral Ivory found, that 'tis not credible it ever belong'd to any Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. Nor is this truth prejudic'd by [the] tricks of Impo<U+017F>tors, who make counterfeit Unicorn's horns of Ivory, or other horns, or the bones, of Elephants, and other Animals kept for <U+017F>ome time under ground, whereby they acquire more <U+017F>olidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:66371:187"/>
and <U+017F>ome tran<U+017F>parency, by means of the <U+017F>alt of the Earth, which in<U+017F>inuates thereinto, as it doth to Porcellane, which for that rea<U+017F>on is bury'd a whole Age: nor by the ebullition that <U+017F>ome other natural and artificial bodies cau<U+017F>e, or by the <U+017F>weating of <U+017F>ome Stones upon the approach of poy<U+017F>on, which proceeds from the poy<U+017F>on's in<U+017F>pi<U+017F><U+017F>ating the Air, which thereupon <U+017F>ticks to the next <U+017F>olid body. Nor is the colour material; <U+017F>ince proce<U+017F>s of time may alter it; be<U+017F>ides that, the Ancients attribute blackne<U+017F>s only to the horns of the Indian A<U+017F>s, and the Rhinoceros: And, as for the <U+017F>mell found in the Unicorn's horn in <hi>Suizzerland,</hi> 'tis an argument, that the <U+017F>ame is either adulterate, or a Mineral one; the texture of the horns being too clo<U+017F>e to evaporate any thing; and tho<U+017F>e that have di<U+017F>till'd them by fires, find, that they abound with an inodorous Salt, and a <U+017F>tinking Sulphur. In <U+017F>hort, 'tis not credible, <hi>Clement</hi> VII. <hi>Paul</hi> III. and divers others, would have taken this Animal for their Arms, if there were no <U+017F>uch; nor do Popes <U+017F>o much want under<U+017F>tanding men, that <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> III. would have bought a fragment of it for 12000. crowns; whereof his Phy<U+017F>itian made u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully in the cure of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>es that had any thing of veneno<U+017F>ity. <hi>Mar<U+017F>ilius Ficinus, Bra<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>avola, Matthiolus, Aloi<U+017F>ius, Mundela,</hi> and many other Phy<U+017F>ici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, recommend it in <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, e<U+017F>pecially in the Pe<U+017F>tilence, the Biting of a mad Dog, Worms, Falling-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, and other <U+017F>uch hideous Maladies. To conclude, I conceive, that effects which depend upon occult Properties, as this doth, ought not to be ra<U+017F>hly condemn'd; being mindful that our knowledg is limited, and therefore, the Authorities, Rea<U+017F>ons, and Experiences, which e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h the Unicorn's horn, and its wonderful Effects are to be yielded to; only with exception to Impo<U+017F>ture.</p>

the po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of Satyrs: Becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aith he, if this mixture of the humane and equine Nature had place, Hor<U+017F>es being in their full <U+017F>trength at three years old, at which time children <U+017F>carce leave <U+017F>ucking the brea<U+017F>ts of their Nur<U+017F>e, how is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible this mon<U+017F>trous Animal <U+017F>hould be in its tender age and full growth both together? And again, a Hor<U+017F>e growing, when the Man enters into the prime of his youth, how can the one dye, when the other is in the <U+017F>tate of its greate<U+017F>t vigour? Now Goats live le<U+017F>s time than Hor<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>o there is le<U+017F>s probability for an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal compounded of the Nature of a Goat and a Man. Hence <hi>Pliny,</hi> in the <U+017F>eventh book of his Natural Hi<U+017F>tory, <U+017F>aith, That a Hippocentaur being bred in <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>aly,</hi> it dy'd the <U+017F>ame day, and was afterwards pre<U+017F>erv'd in honey, which is an excellent bawm. <hi>Virgil</hi> places them at the entrance of Hell, becau<U+017F>e things again<U+017F>t Nature cannot <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t. And S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in the life of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Hermit, relating how a Centaur appeard to S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> doubts whether it were a true Centaur, or the Devil under that <U+017F>hape; and indeed <U+017F>eems to infer it an Evil Spirit, becau<U+017F>e it was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away by the <U+017F>ign of the Cro<U+017F>s. So that Satyrs are to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed only to the liberty Poets have ever taken, as well as Painters of daring and attempting every thing, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erving the Rule <hi>Horace</hi> pre<U+017F>cribes them not to conjoyn Natures totally di<U+017F>agreeing and oppo<U+017F>ite; for, by the<U+017F>e mixtures they intended only to repre<U+017F>ent very nimble, la<U+017F>civious, ru<U+017F>tick, and perhaps abu<U+017F>ive men; (whence came their Satyrick Poems.)</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, That 'tis as dangerous to conclude all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that we have not <U+017F>een, as to be credulous to every thing. But when Rea<U+017F>on, and the authority Experience carries with it, are of a <U+017F>ide, our incredulity, hath no excu<U+017F>e. Now the ca<U+017F>e of Satyrs is <U+017F>uch; for they may be as well produc'd by the mixture of the Seeds of two Species, as Mules are. Be<U+017F>ides, were not the Imagination of Mothers capable of imprinting this as well as any other change of Figure in a Child's body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have daily examples; yet the wild <U+017F>uckling and cour<U+017F>e of life <U+017F>ome Children may have had among<U+017F>t Goats (as <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> had from a Wolf) may in proce<U+017F>s of time have begot <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>emblance of <U+017F>hape in them. As for <hi>Lucretius</hi>'s Rea<U+017F>on, we <U+017F>ee that Plants are ingrafted into others, not only of the <U+017F>ame, but al<U+017F>o of a different Species, as the Apple-Cyon on a Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort; which Plants being of different durations, the graft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of a middle duration between them, namely longer-liv'd then a Colewort, and <U+017F>horter then another Apple-tree. And S. <hi>Hierom</hi> is not po<U+017F>itive, that the Centaur, which appear'd to S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> was an illu<U+017F>ion, but doubts whether it were a true Centaur <U+017F>uch as Antiquity <U+017F>poke of, or whether 'twas not the Devil appearing in that <U+017F>hape to frighten that holy Per<U+017F>on. And, <hi>Plato, in convivio <U+017F>apientum,</hi> relates, That a Shepheard having pre<U+017F>ented to <hi>Periander</hi> a Foal born of a Mare of his, that had the head, neck, and hands of a Man, the re<U+017F>t of an Hor<U+017F>e;

and the voice of a Child, <hi>Diocles</hi> affirm'd, that this Prodigy pre<U+017F>ag'd Seditions and Divi<U+017F>ions of Minds: But <hi>Thales</hi> reply'd, 'Twas a natural thing, and, for preventing the like again, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him to have no other Hor<U+017F>-keepers but what were married. <hi>Pliny,</hi> likewi<U+017F>e in the <U+017F>eventh Book of his Natural Hi<U+017F>tory, <U+017F>aith, That in the Country of the <hi>Cratadulones,</hi> among<U+017F>t the Indian Mountains, Satyrs are found; very <U+017F>wift Creatures, running <U+017F>ometimes on two feet, <U+017F>ometimes on four, and having the <U+017F>hape of a Man. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells in <hi>Sylla</hi>'s life, That, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> a Satyr was brought to him like tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>crib'd by ancient Authors, half-man, and half-goat; and being a<U+017F>kt what he was, an<U+017F>wer'd nothing that re<U+017F>embled a humane voice, but with a tone mixt of that of Goats, and the neighing of Hor<U+017F>es. Whereupon, <hi>Sylla,</hi> having compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed guards to carry him back. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd place de<U+017F>cribes another Satyr, which, he <U+017F>aith, was of a middle <U+017F>tature, having a crooked No<U+017F>e, horned front, and Goats feet, and brought Dates yet hanging on a Palm-branch, to S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit. The Saint askt him what he was, and he an<U+017F>wer'd, that he was a Mortal, one of the Inhabitants of that Hermitage, whom the abu<U+017F>ed Pagans adore, for Fauns, Satyrs, and Incubes; and I come (<U+017F>aith he) as deputed to you from our Company, to de<U+017F>ire you to pray for us to your and our God, whom we know to be come into the World, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation. After which words, this light Animal took its cour<U+017F>e and fled away. And le<U+017F>t this Relation might <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange, I <U+017F>hall add, That under <hi>Con<U+017F>tantine,</hi> a living one was brought to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <U+017F>hewn there to the People; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being dead, it was called and carried to <hi>Antioch</hi> to be <U+017F>een by the Emperor. <hi>Pau<U+017F>anias</hi> records al<U+017F>o, That he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by one <hi>Euphemius,</hi> who, (he <U+017F>aith) was a man worthy of credit, how that <U+017F>ailing into <hi>Spain,</hi> he was driven by <U+017F>torm into certain I<U+017F>lands full of <U+017F>avage Men, having hairy bodies, long tails, like tho<U+017F>e of Hor<U+017F>es, and red hair; whom they could not keep off from them, but by blows; and a Woman being expos'd on the <U+017F>hore by the Mariners, the<U+017F>e Satyrs abus'd her with all outrages imaginable. So that to doubt of the exi<U+017F>tence of Satyrs after <U+017F>o many Te<U+017F>timonies, is, to a<U+017F>cribe too much to our own <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, and too little to the witne<U+017F>s of the Ancients.</p>

            <p>IF ever there were cau<U+017F>e to admire the <U+017F>implicity and credulity of the Ancients, 'tis the <U+017F>tory of the Phoenix, which is feign'd a Bird that lives many ages, after which repairing to the City <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> it builds its ne<U+017F>t, or rather funeral pile, there of aromatick wood, which, by rea<U+017F>on of its high <U+017F>ituation being fir'd by the Sun-beams, <U+017F>he dyes, and immediately another ari<U+017F>es out of her a<U+017F>hes; it being as impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for Nature to be without a Phoenix, as the Phoenix to have a Companion. In which Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Hi<U+017F>torians have imitated the Poets, and cho<U+017F>en rather to tell <U+017F>trange things than true. For, fir<U+017F>t, this Nativity of this imaginary Bird is a manife<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility; becau<U+017F>e nothing is more abhorr'd by Nature than voluntary death, and that order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governe<U+017F>s would rather have given the Phoenix a Female, as well as to all other Creatures, than have put her <U+017F>elf thus upon the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of a miracle. Nor can any thing be more contrary to the generation of Animals than a<U+017F>hes, which, are dry; dryne<U+017F>s being altogether oppo<U+017F>ite to life, and to the corruption which is antecedent to every generation. Next, its progre<U+017F>s is equally ab<U+017F>urd. For, they <U+017F>ay, this little Bird no <U+017F>ooner attains its ju<U+017F>t bigne<U+017F>s, (which is equal to that of an Eagle, having its head cri<U+017F>ted with divers colours, the neck gold-colour, the re<U+017F>t of the feathers purple <U+017F>aving that the tail is mixt of <U+017F>carlet and <U+017F>ky-colour) but it prepares it <U+017F>elf to pay the la<U+017F>t duties to the bones of its decea<U+017F>ed parent. (But how con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent is this with the Bird's being reduc'd to a<U+017F>hes?) Which bones <U+017F>he lays upon her back, and flyes from <hi>Aegypt</hi> with them to <hi>Arabia,</hi> where <U+017F>he places them upon an Altar dedicated to the Sun; upon which the <U+017F>ame Bird before her death had made an offering of the Nea<U+017F>t, which was to be her fatal pile. After the<U+017F>e funerals it flies towards Heaven, where 'tis fed with dew, and the fumes of Incen<U+017F>e and Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum; and in<U+017F>tead of drink, makes u<U+017F>e of the vapors which ari<U+017F>e from the Sea, abhorring all kind of grain and food common to other Birds. According to <hi>Aelian,</hi> it lives five hundred years, according to others <U+017F>ix hundred, and according to others more, in places apart from the commerce of Men; but <U+017F>o highly reverenc'd by all other Birds, that they follow it with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect and admiration, in<U+017F>omuch that Birds of rapine forget their prey, and others the fear of being taken. As many fictions as words, even if <hi>Lucretius</hi>'s opinion be true, who admits not, that any <U+017F>ingle Animal can generate. Wherefore 'tis not without rea<U+017F>on, that to avoid rendring account of the many ab<U+017F>urdities ari<U+017F>ing from the<U+017F>e fal<U+017F>e <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>itions, the Hi<U+017F>torians make it to be hid from our <U+017F>ight <U+017F>o many Ages; fore<U+017F>eeing that if there was
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:66371:189"/>
but one Woman found that had danc'd twice at <hi>Rome</hi> in the <U+017F>ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Playes, there will be no witne<U+017F><U+017F>es found to atte<U+017F>t the nativity, life, and death of this Animal.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That we ought not to condemn the ab<U+017F>ent under pretext that they are unknown; for the Nativity of this Bird is defended by that of <hi>Barnacle,</hi> which is bred of the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of a Ship; and of another call'd <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> which by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>totle</hi>'s report, is produc'd of the leaf of a Tree near the River <hi>Hippanis.</hi> If the duration of its life be uncertain, <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e is that of all Animals with which we conver<U+017F>e not. And were the authority of <hi>Betonius</hi> <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, who confounds it with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucodrata,</hi> yet that of <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the fourteenth Book of his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals is authentick. <hi>P. Fabius,</hi> and <hi>L. Vitellus,</hi> (<U+017F>aith he) being Con<U+017F>uls. the Bird call'd a Phoenix after many Ages appear'd in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and gave occa<U+017F>ion to many Greeks and other per<U+017F>onages of the Country to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the miracle; concerning which they relate many doubtful things, but worthy to be known. They <U+017F>ay, this Animal is devoted to the Sun, and that its beak and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of plumes, is wholly different from other Animals. Mo<U+017F>t af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it lives five hundred years; others, that it attains to one thou<U+017F>and four hundred <U+017F>ixty one: and that the fir<U+017F>t were <U+017F>een un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Se<U+017F>o<U+017F>tris</hi> and <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi>; next, under <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who reign'd the third of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> It came then into the City of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> accompany'd with a great number of other Birds, who <U+017F>eem'd as well as Men amaz'd at the new <U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle. But becau<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aith he) there were but two thou<U+017F>and five hundred years from <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> under whom this appear'd; this made <U+017F>ome doubt it was not the true Phoenix, and came not from <hi>Arabia,</hi> whence it ought not to come till its life were near an end, to build its nea<U+017F>t in <hi>Egypt</hi>; wherein he leavs a genital virtue whereby his Succe<U+017F><U+017F>or is produc'd, who as <U+017F>oon as come to full vigor, prepares to pay the funeral duty to its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; which it doth not, lightly, but after it hath try'd by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying an equal weight of Myrrh, whether it be able to carry that of its parent's bones. However, <U+017F>aith he, 'tis a certain thing that this Bird is <U+017F>een <U+017F>ometimes in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And, indeed, its exi<U+017F>tence is prov'd by the Authority of <hi>Orus Apollo</hi> in his Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks; <hi>Manilius, Pliny, Ovid, Athenaeus, Albertus Magnus,</hi> yea, by the publick voice which u<U+017F>es this word, to <U+017F>ignifie a rare thing, and <U+017F>ingular in its Species: Which were not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if <hi>Lactantius, Tertullian,</hi> and many other Fathers had not often employ'd it to convince the Pagans who que<U+017F>tion'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urrection. Moreover, <hi>Aelian</hi> in his Hi<U+017F>tory of Animals, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing this too well known to be particularly de<U+017F>crib'd, only blames the broking Mi<U+017F>ers of his time, who prefer their affairs before the wonder of this Bird, which is <U+017F>o well <U+017F>kill'd in calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that it fails not to repair to its fatal nea<U+017F>t at the prefixt time. In <U+017F>hort, we may doubt of <U+017F>ome circum<U+017F>tances, but not of the truth of its exi<U+017F>tence; its renovation is prov'd po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:66371:190"/>
from the re-animation of a drown'd fly by the Sun; and <U+017F>ince hard to give a <U+017F>atisfactory account of common generations, we may therefore forbear to reject this, which, though extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, may yet be maintain'd by Chymi<U+017F>ts, who lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of generation in Salt, the <U+017F>ole permanent principle, and not volatile as the two other are.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Fathers in u<U+017F>ing Compari<U+017F>ons from this Bird, had regard to the common belief, as God accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates him<U+017F>elf to the Language of Men, attributing Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions to him<U+017F>elf, though he hath none. And for the Authors that <U+017F>peak of it, 'tis always upon the credit of others. Even <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> the fir<U+017F>t whereof, (if you will believe him) <U+017F>aw almo<U+017F>t every thing however <U+017F>trange and unheard of; and the <U+017F>econd affirms almo<U+017F>t every thing; (<U+017F>o far as to <U+017F>ay, that certain Birds lay their Eggs in a Hare's <U+017F>kin, which they afterwards hang upon a Tree; and that others carry theirs upon a <U+017F>tick lay'd over the <U+017F>houlders of two; be<U+017F>ides infinite other things no le<U+017F>s incredible and ridiculous) yet <U+017F>peak but doubtfully of this Bird. So that we have great rea<U+017F>on to do the like, yea, to e<U+017F>teem it a Fiction.</p>

The <hi>Portugals</hi> tell in their Navigations of an Herb that grows with <U+017F>mall roots in hot and moi<U+017F>t places, putting forth eight little branches two fingers long, furni<U+017F>ht with leavs on each <U+017F>ide, as green as <hi>Tamarisk,</hi> but re<U+017F>embling tho<U+017F>e of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypody. From the middle of the roots ari<U+017F>e four <U+017F>mall <U+017F>talks, each of which bears a yellow Flower like that of Cloves, but without <U+017F>mell; which being never <U+017F>o little toucht, langui<U+017F>h and flag, but re<U+017F>ume their fir<U+017F>t vigor upon the removal of the hand. Of which Marvail, a Philo<U+017F>opher of <hi>Malabar</hi> being unable to find the cau<U+017F>e, became a fool. <hi>Monardes</hi> a Phy<U+017F>ician of <hi>Sevil,</hi> having de<U+017F>crib'd a <U+017F>ort of Barly in new <hi>Spain,</hi> call'd <hi>Gayatene,</hi> or <hi>Cevadilla,</hi> (wich falls flat as <U+017F>oon as it is toucht) makes mention of another Species of the <U+017F>ame Herb, which lying <U+017F>pread upon the ground, upon touching, folds it <U+017F>elf like cri<U+017F>ped Colewort. La<U+017F>tly, <hi>Nicolas Conti</hi> <U+017F>ays, that in the <hi>Ea<U+017F>t-Indies</hi> between the Cities of <hi>Bi<U+017F>nagar</hi> and <hi>Malepur,</hi> there grows a Tree without Fruit three yards high, call'd <hi>Arbor Pudica,</hi> which retracts its branches when any Man or Bea<U+017F>t approaches it. By all which Relations, it is manife<U+017F>t that there are Sen<U+017F>itive Plants.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ince 'tis not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to imagine Sen<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Life without Organs, the<U+017F>e motions mu<U+017F>t not be attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sen<U+017F>e, but to other Cau<U+017F>es; as to the attractive heat which is in all Plants, which makes them fold up them<U+017F>elves according to the figure of the Body near which they are. Some Animals, as Oy<U+017F>ters, have indeed a more imperceptible degree of Sen<U+017F>e, yet are not they therefore Plants; tho<U+017F>e whereof that have any local motion, have it, perhaps, from the concu<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Earth caus'd by the approaching per<U+017F>on, or from the <U+017F>tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Air; which though imperceptible, drives along the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi>: And, perhaps, the<U+017F>e Flowers and Herbs are of a very rare and <U+017F>ubtle texture. Unle<U+017F>s you had rather recurr to the Antipathy which is found between the<U+017F>e Plants and Man, which cau<U+017F>es the <U+017F>kin and fiddle-<U+017F>trings made of Sheeps guts, to break at the noi<U+017F>e and <U+017F>ound made by tho<U+017F>e of a Wolf, with which they will never be brought to be harmonious. For this is a better way than to multiply Species without nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, as they do who e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h a middle Nature between a Plant and an Animal. And as for tho<U+017F>e which remove from one place to another, they may, perhaps, find the <U+017F>ame account of them upon inquiry that <hi>Aeneas

            <p>THis word <U+017F>ome think is deriv'd from the Hebrew <hi>Bel,</hi> which <U+017F>ignifies King, and <hi>zaars</hi> Poy<U+017F>ons, as if it were the King or Ma<U+017F>ter of Poy<U+017F>ons, which are <U+017F>ubdu'd more powerfully by this than any other remedy. According to <hi>Scaliger, Bezohard</hi> is taken by the Arabians for that which pre<U+017F>erves life, and <U+017F>o the Stone will have borrow'd its name from its effect. <hi>Cardan</hi> <U+017F>aith, there is a poy<U+017F>onous root of this name, which bears a fruit call'd <hi>Niraebri,</hi> which is an Antidote to it. This <U+017F>tone is divided into Natural and Artificial. The Natural is of two <U+017F>orts, <hi>viz.</hi> Animal and Mineral; yea, Plants and every thing good again<U+017F>t Poy<U+017F>ons is commonly term'd Bezoardical, But the Name primarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a <U+017F>tone found in an Animal, called by the Per<U+017F>ians <hi>Pa<U+017F>an,</hi> or <hi>Pa<U+017F>ar</hi>; which Animal, <hi>Monardes</hi> <U+017F>aith, is of the bigne<U+017F>s, and almo<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>hape of a Stag, having two Horns large at the ba<U+017F>e, pointed at the top, and bowed over the back like tho<U+017F>e of a Goat, which it re<U+017F>embles in the feet, and <U+017F>omething too in the form: Whence <U+017F>ome term it Trag-elaphos, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Goat-Deer, though this be a different Animal, having <U+017F>hort Hair, and a <U+017F>kin between grey and red, and <U+017F>ometimes of other colours. The Indians take them in nets for the <U+017F>tone's <U+017F>ake, which they <U+017F>ell to Merchants. For though the Bea<U+017F>t is <U+017F>o furious that it breaks any other link but tho<U+017F>e of Iron, yet the price of this <U+017F>tone is <U+017F>o great that it makes the danger de<U+017F>picable. He adds, that it is <U+017F>o nimble that it ca<U+017F>ts it <U+017F>elf down from an high Rock, and lights upon its horns without any hurt; and that its pace is leaping and bounding like a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball. All agree not in what part of the Animal the <U+017F>tone grows. The Arabians write, that this and all other <U+017F>orts of Deer find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them<U+017F>elves old and <U+017F>ick, by their breath draw Serpents out of their holes and devour them, that <U+017F>o thereby they become young and well again; after which finding them<U+017F>elves heated by this food, they run into the water, and <U+017F>tay there without drinking till their heat be over; during which <U+017F>tay in the water, this <U+017F>tone is bred in the corners of their Eyes, whence it is taken for the u<U+017F>es above<U+017F>aid. But <hi>Monardes</hi> more probably learnt from the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Mountains of <hi>China,</hi> that in the <hi>Indies</hi> near the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> the<U+017F>e Goat-Deer after their eating of Serpents

go about the tops of the Mountains feeding on <U+017F>uch Herbs as Nature hath taught them re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t Poy<U+017F>ons; of the quinte<U+017F><U+017F>ence whereof mix'd with that of the Poy<U+017F>ons, the Bezoar is by <U+017F>ome particular virtue produc'd in <U+017F>ome cavity of their Bodies; <hi>Gar<U+017F>ias ab Horto,</hi> and <hi>Aco<U+017F>ta</hi> <U+017F>ay, in their <U+017F>tomack; particularly in that reduplication by which they ruminate: others, as <hi>Frago<U+017F>us,</hi> in the kidneys, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tones have the figure of that part, which al<U+017F>o is the mo<U+017F>t lapidifick of the whole Body; and others too, as <hi>Rabbi Mo<U+017F>es</hi> the Aegyptian, in the Gall; which opinion <hi>Monardes</hi> him<U+017F>elf is of though he admits too that it is found in the Ventricle, Inte<U+017F>tines, and other cavities of the Body: As, indeed, there is no place in the Bodies of Animals, but <U+017F>tones may be generated in them. However, 'tis univer<U+017F>ally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd <U+017F>o u<U+017F>eful, that the hunters are expre<U+017F>ly commanded to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them all to the King, who buyes them at a great rate, and they are not tran<U+017F>ported el<U+017F>ewhere but clande<U+017F>tinely. <hi>Amatus Lu<U+017F>itanus</hi> <U+017F>aith, that one of the riche<U+017F>t Pre<U+017F>ents which <hi>Cochain</hi> King of the place <U+017F>ent in his time to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was one of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>tones, a little bigger than a Hazle-nut; of which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ob<U+017F>erv'd the great effects, he procur'd others to be brought from that Country. The<U+017F>e effects are the curing of Pe<U+017F>tilential Fevers, the Lepro<U+017F>ie, Small Pox, Epilep<U+017F>ie, Worms in Children, bitings of venomous Bea<U+017F>ts, and generally again<U+017F>t all Poy<U+017F>on; particularly, 'tis very proper for faintings, — and other effects of Melancholy. Whence 'tis us'd in Quartan; Agues to appea<U+017F>e the Symptoms thereof, and <hi>Charles</hi> V. took it often; yea, 'tis ob<U+017F>erv'd in <U+017F>ome Ho<U+017F>pitals, that the bare powder of this <U+017F>tone temper'd in water, communicates its virtue thereunto, <U+017F>o that it hath cur'd the Purples and other Epidemical Maladies.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>uch as de<U+017F>ign'd to get them<U+017F>elves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in Phy<U+017F>ick, finding many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es unconquerable by common Remedies, that they might not remain idle, and <U+017F>uffer the defect of curing incurable, and rebellious Maladies to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted either to their Art or their Ignorance, have had recour<U+017F>e to the Foxe's <U+017F>kin, propo<U+017F>ing the u<U+017F>e of Remedies <U+017F>o rare and hard to find, that their Impo<U+017F>ture might not be di<U+017F>cover'd. Hence, <U+017F>ome have <U+017F>o highly extoll'd precious Stones and Gold, which not fifty years ago the poor were per<U+017F>waded, cur'd them by being boil'd in Re<U+017F>toratives, though the rich, who made u<U+017F>e of the traud, found their gold Chains as heavy afterwards as before, (in ca<U+017F>e they lookt well to them, in the boiling) and con<U+017F>equently, that no Vertue was deriv'd from them. Of this kind is the Bezoar-<U+017F>tone: touching the Original whereof we <U+017F>ee how Authors differ, and a few moneths ago an Animal was <U+017F>hewn in this City very different from that above-de<U+017F>crib'd, which they term'd <hi>Pucos,</hi> and affirmed to be that which bred the Bezoar. Be<U+017F>ides, the difficulty of di<U+017F>cerning the true Stone from fal<U+017F>e, which probably are the mo<U+017F>t numerous, mu<U+017F>t needs render the u<U+017F>e of it <U+017F>u<U+017F>picious; <U+017F>ince even in the time of <hi>Serap on</hi> it was
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:66371:192"/>
<U+017F>old fal<U+017F>ifi'd, which, he <U+017F>aith, was unprofitable, but I think ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mi<U+017F>chievous. And <hi>Clu<U+017F>ius</hi> complains, That the Merchants of <hi>Lisbon</hi> would not <U+017F>uffer the u<U+017F>ual trial to be made for di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hing the true from the adulterate. Neither do Authors agree about tho<U+017F>e trials; <U+017F>ome accounting it a <U+017F>ign of Goodne<U+017F>s, if the Stone hath nothing but a little du<U+017F>t in the Center; whereas the fal<U+017F>ifi'd (<U+017F>ay they) have <U+017F>ome Seed, or other <U+017F>olid body there, upon which the other Materials were <U+017F>uperinduc'd: others think, the right hath always a <U+017F>traw in the middle. Wherein we may ob<U+017F>erve, that the <U+017F>everal <U+017F>cales or folds it hath one over another, like tho<U+017F>e of an Onion, or the Stone of a man's Bladder, which are made by new appo<U+017F>ition of matter, agree not with the above-mentioned manner of its being made all at once. But in whatever manner and place it be produc'd, I think it can act on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by its manife<U+017F>t Qualities which alone are active; the Effects of occult Qualities being as hidden as them<U+017F>elves. Be<U+017F>ides, how could the<U+017F>e Trea<U+017F>ures and Pre<U+017F>ents of Kings to be <U+017F>o common at this day, in all Shops, if they had <U+017F>uch great Vertues too as are attributed to them. Wherefore 'tis mo<U+017F>t likely, that the Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of Men hath added this to other popular Errors.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That as no Sect is more ea<U+017F>ie than the Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhonian or Sceptick, which doubts of every thing; <U+017F>o 'tis a very obvious Invention for <U+017F>uch as are willing to decline inquiring into that va<U+017F>t trea<U+017F>ure of Remedies, which are di<U+017F>pers'd from the Concave of the Moon to the Center of the Earth, and into the trials which may be made by their almo<U+017F>t infinite preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and mixtures, to reject all upon pretext of Incertainty in Philo<U+017F>ophical accounts. But though the <U+017F>horte<U+017F>t, I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the be<U+017F>t way; <U+017F>ince Experience <U+017F>hews us many Effects which depend not upon Qualities; and, they that decry the Bezoar, becau<U+017F>e it acts not by manife<U+017F>t Qualities, admit others which do as little, <hi>viz.</hi> Elective Purgers, Splenetical, Hy<U+017F>teri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and other appropriate Remedies, though in <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>es even of a contrary temper to the parts they are apply'd to. Which error happens, from our always making Qualities Cau<U+017F>es; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as oftentimes they are Effects. Be<U+017F>ides, 'tis great pride to deny whatever we under<U+017F>tand not; <U+017F>ince the mo<U+017F>t knowing agree that they <U+017F>ee only through a cloud, and the chief effect of Beatitude will be, To be ignorant of nothing. And why <U+017F>hould the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Antidotes depend more upon fir<U+017F>t Qualities than tho<U+017F>e of poy<U+017F>ons do? <U+017F>ince they ought to be contraries, and contraries are under the <U+017F>ame <hi>Genus.</hi> Wherefore it <U+017F>ufficeth to recur to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Experiment. Indeed <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> knew not Bezoar; yet neither do wee reject <hi>Sena</hi> which they knew not, and which is one of the commone<U+017F>t and be<U+017F>t Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments we have. But all the <hi>Arabian</hi> Phy<U+017F>icians concurr in this point, and <hi>Serapion</hi> particularly affirms, that this Stone is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Antidote again<U+017F>t all poy<U+017F>on in the bitings of venemous Bea<U+017F>ts; and <U+017F>o efficacious, that not only three or four grains of

it held in the mouth, enervate poy<U+017F>ons; but the powder apply'd to a venemous Animal, <U+017F>tupefies it, and takes away its power of hurting; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>ome parts already begun to corrupt by their biting, have pre<U+017F>ently been re<U+017F>tor'd to their fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F>tate by its <U+017F>ingle application. <hi>Avicenna,</hi> in the fourth Chapter of his <U+017F>econd Canon ranks it with Treacle, among<U+017F>t Alexipharmacal Remedies which pre<U+017F>erve health, and <U+017F>trengthen the Spirits. <hi>Rha<U+017F>is,</hi> in his Continent, affirms, That he found more admirable Faculties in Bezoar, than in all other Antidotes; and in his book to <hi>Alman<U+017F>or,</hi> he <U+017F>aith, That Remedies for re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting poy<U+017F>on, that a<U+017F><U+017F>ault the heart, and offend by their whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, are in vain prepar'd, if Bezoar be left out; which alone, he <U+017F>aith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts the poy<U+017F>on of <hi>Napellus</hi> or Monks-hood the mo<U+017F>t pernicious of all. <hi>Avenzoar,</hi> in his <hi>They<U+017F>er,</hi> writes, that a man given over for dead upon taking of poy<U+017F>on, was cur'd by three grains of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar. <hi>Peter</hi> de <hi>Abano</hi> (call'd the Conciliator) affirms, That <hi>Edward</hi> I. King of <hi>England,</hi> being wounded with a poy<U+017F>on'd <U+017F>word in the war again<U+017F>t the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and ready to expire, was cur'd by <U+017F>ome of this <U+017F>tone given him by the General of the Templars: and that the bare wearing it re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts poy<U+017F>on. <hi>Monardes</hi> affirms, That with this Stone in le<U+017F>s than a quarter of an hour he cur'd a certain Licentiate, who<U+017F>e body was already all <U+017F>well'd by having once drunk, and another time eaten poy<U+017F>on; and that a poy<U+017F>on'd Maid, after the u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s tryal of all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoy<U+017F>ons, was pre<U+017F>ently cur'd by this. The <U+017F>ame Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a great number of Syncopes, Pe<U+017F>tilential Feavers, Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, Epilep<U+017F>ies, and other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es cur'd by this Remedy; which is the more excellent in that it is in<U+017F>ipid and void of all the bad ta<U+017F>te which accompanies mo<U+017F>t other Remedies. The<U+017F>e Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are further authoris'd by the publick voice, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ea<U+017F>ily outweigh'd by the few per<U+017F>ons that undertake to bid defiance to Antiquity, and to accu<U+017F>e it of ignorance or fraud, though it be not wholly de<U+017F>titute of Rea<U+017F>on. For <U+017F>ince 'tis grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Viper's fle<U+017F>h is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in Treacle to render the <U+017F>ame efficacious again<U+017F>t the bitings of that Animal, (it being nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that <U+017F>omething intervene of a middle nature between ours, and that of the Viper, as its fle<U+017F>h, is being void of venom, but <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of it) why <U+017F>hould it be deny'd, that Bezoar which is produc'd of <U+017F>omething that hath poy<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>omething that re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts it, may <U+017F>erve for a <hi>medium</hi> to <U+017F>ubdue the <U+017F>ame in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The objections to the contrary are either general or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. The former concern only Mountebanks, who are left to an<U+017F>wer them; it being incredible that a good man, much le<U+017F>s a Chri<U+017F>tian, would deceive in a matter <U+017F>o important as Life; which yet may be as often indanger'd by rejecting good remedies upon vain Argumentations, (to <U+017F>ay no wor<U+017F>e) as by pre<U+017F>cribing tho<U+017F>e that are unprofitable. The Objection again<U+017F>t Gold and precious <U+017F>tones makes as much again<U+017F>t the Confection <hi>de Hyacin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this,</hi> and others, whereof they are ingredients; but they that
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:66371:193"/>
have well con<U+017F>ider'd tho<U+017F>e rich Bodies, find virtues to i<U+017F><U+017F>ue from them which impair not their weight; as is ob<U+017F>erv'd in Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ilver, the decoction whereof kills worms, though its weight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the <U+017F>ame; and in the Regulus of Antimony, a cup where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of renders liquors purgative in <hi>infinitum,</hi> without any diminution of its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. As for the diver<U+017F>ity of Opinions touching the generation of this Stone, this difficulty is found almo<U+017F>t in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign remedies; and though 'tis not known, Whence Amber comes? yet we find its perfume excellent, and its u<U+017F>e profitable in Phy<U+017F>ick. Nor is Adulteration proper only to Bezoar <U+017F>tones, but common to Balm, Civet, Storax, Rhubarb, and, in a word, to all other remedies; and the abu<U+017F>e ought not to prejudice the u<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>ame Authors that have ob<U+017F>erv'd the<U+017F>e impo<U+017F>tures, teach us al<U+017F>o to avoid them. <hi>Clu<U+017F>ius</hi> makes tryal of them, by pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing a poy<U+017F>on'd thread through a Dog's Leg, and when the Symptoms of the Poy<U+017F>on have made him fall down as dead, if upon taking a little of the powder of this Stone, he revives, 'tis right; if not, 'tis fal<U+017F>ifi'd. <hi>Monardes</hi>'s tryal is by breaking the <U+017F>tone, which ought to appear made of <U+017F>everal films thicker or thinner according to its bigne<U+017F>s, which is commonly equal to that of an Olive, and almo<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>ame colour, though <U+017F>ome are found to weigh two ounces, and the bigge<U+017F>t are the be<U+017F>t; but the Surfaces mu<U+017F>t be all <U+017F>mooth, the inward more than the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in the middle of which is a powder of more efficacy than the out<U+017F>ide, or a <U+017F>traw or little piece of dry'd Herb, not a <U+017F>eed as there is in the fictitious; tho<U+017F>e that are vers'd therein know how to avoid being abus'd, and adjudge the Oriental better than the Occidental, which are darker and weaker. It matters not as to the truth of the effect, in what manner this <U+017F>tone is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; though 'tis not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for <U+017F>everal Tunicles to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd together, as tho<U+017F>e of the Onyon are. In fine, <U+017F>uch may the rarity of Bezoar have <U+017F>ometimes been, that only great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons made u<U+017F>e of it; but its admirable effects have made men curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to procure <U+017F>tore of them, which they may the more ea<U+017F>ily do even by their means who decry them, the Apothecaries thereby having always <U+017F>ome left in their <U+017F>hops.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That in order to know well the benefits of Bezoar, 'tis requi<U+017F>ite fir<U+017F>t to be agreed What it is; which point is not yet determin'd. <hi>Scribonius Largus</hi> conceives it the hardned tear of a Stag a hundred years old: Others, think it a Mineral; others, a <U+017F>tone bred in an Animal, <U+017F>o contrary to Nature that the Animal that breeds it is exceedingly tormented with it, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if be big; which the hunters gue<U+017F>s by <U+017F>eeing them go with pain, as Men do that have the <U+017F>tone in the Bladder. Yea, 'tis not agreed in what part of the Body 'tis found, though this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary towards the di<U+017F>covery of its virtue; <U+017F>ince <U+017F>tones found in the Gall are of another Nature and Properties, than tho<U+017F>e of the Reins or Bladder. Moreover, the colour of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>tones is extreamly various, not to mention the difference

which proceeds from that of Climates; the Occidental being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t without virtue in compari<U+017F>on of the Oriental. Whence it follows, that no certain unque<U+017F>tionable property can be a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd to this <U+017F>tone as to other Remedies, which act always in the <U+017F>ame manner; otherwi<U+017F>e there would be no Science. But <U+017F>hould the Bezoar have an Alexipharmacal Virtue, yet it could be but like that of other Bodies, which act proportionally to their bulk. Now what proportion is there between three grains of an in<U+017F>ipid powder which cau<U+017F>es no evacuation, or other <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible action; and a mortal poy<U+017F>on, who<U+017F>e cruel Symptoms di<U+017F>cover them<U+017F>elves as <U+017F>peedily as fire doth when put to matter <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of combu<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And I appeal to the te<U+017F>timony of all tho<U+017F>e that have made u<U+017F>e of it in our Age, whether they ever found the effects that are attributed to it. Whence it follows, that it is doubly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; Fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e 'tis of great co<U+017F>t to the Patient; Secondly, it takes up the place of <U+017F>ome other good Remedy, cau<U+017F>ing lo<U+017F>s of time which might otherwi<U+017F>e be profitably employ'd in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the <U+017F>ick.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That Poy<U+017F>ons and Epidemical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es hurt not by their manife<U+017F>t qualities, nor by the quantity of their matter; as appears in the biting of a Scorpion, which ca<U+017F>ts forth an imperceptible quantity of venom. And therefore 'tis not to be expected that their Remedies <U+017F>hould act either by <U+017F>uch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or by their quantity. Nor are we to doubt of the effect of Bezoar, under pretext that 'tis given in few grains, though <U+017F>ome have given twenty and thirty grains; and that the ordinary do<U+017F>e is about nine or ten grains. Neither is it material whether it be the <U+017F>tone of the kidneys of a Goat, Deer, or the tear of a Deer, provided it have the Virtues a<U+017F>crib'd to it, which is no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible than that which <hi>Scaliger</hi> affirms, him<U+017F>elf try'd in the Stag's tear, which, he <U+017F>aith, <U+017F>o melts Men's Bodies that are either poy<U+017F>on'd or infected with the Pe<U+017F>tilence, that they <U+017F>eem turn'd all into water, and thereby are cur'd. To which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, there are few well employ'd Phy<U+017F>icians but can add many more. Nor is any thing <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t Bezoar, but what may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected again<U+017F>t all other Antidotes, as Sealed Earth, Unicorn's Horn, and all Cordial Remedies, who<U+017F>e Virtue may as well be que<U+017F>tion'd as that of Bezoar.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCVIII. Whence proceeds the <U+017F>udden Death of Men and Animals upon de<U+017F>cending into certain Pits.</head>
            <p>ON the <U+017F>ixteenth of <hi>June</hi> la<U+017F>t, an Inhabitant of the Town of <hi>Tilliers,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Virruel,</hi> perceiv'd a goodly Pigeon, which he took to be one of his own, fall down into a Well hard by his Hou<U+017F>e; whereupon he call'd his Son, and, to draw it out, they let down a ba<U+017F>ket with a rope to the bottom of the Well, into which the Pigeon pre<U+017F>ently entred; but as oft as they lifted it up from the water, it fell back again thereunto: After their de<U+017F>ign had fail'd, the Son tyes a cudgel to the rope, and being let down by his Father, endeavors to take the Pigeon. The Father a<U+017F>k'd him, Whether he had her? He an<U+017F>wer'd thrice, No; and after <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ighs falls, having lo<U+017F>t both Speech and Life. The Father troubl'd at <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange an accident, re<U+017F>olves to go down him<U+017F>elf, and accordingly without any help de<U+017F>cends into the Well, where he remain'd as his Son. The Neighborhood adverti<U+017F>ed of this dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter repair'd thither, and, among<U+017F>t others, one who had not long before ca<U+017F>t the Well; He a<U+017F>cribing all to the weakne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e who were dead, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently betakes him<U+017F>elf to go down; but he was <U+017F>carce come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two foot of the water but he fell down dead without making any complaint. A <U+017F>trong and vigorous young Man upon the belief that the company conceiv'd that tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons were not dead, but only needed help, undertakes to go down likewi<U+017F>e; he did <U+017F>o, but <U+017F>uddenly fell backwards with a little Convul<U+017F>ive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which made him ca<U+017F>t up his head. Hereupon, notwith<U+017F>tanding the di<U+017F><U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions of the Curate of the place, who began to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect <U+017F>ome mortiferous cau<U+017F>es of this effect, a fifth de<U+017F>cended after he had caus'd the rope to be fa<U+017F>tned to his middle; he was no <U+017F>ooner in the middle of the Well but he was pull'd up again upon the Ge<U+017F>tures which he made, with a livid Countenance, and other <U+017F>ignes fore-runners of Death, which he e<U+017F>cap'd by being pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>uccoured with Wine and <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi> Being recover'd, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that he had perceiv'd no hurt but only a certain faintne<U+017F>s upon him. This la<U+017F>t attempt cool'd all a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, <U+017F>o that there was no more talk of going down, but only of getting the Bodies up; which was done: and 'twas ob<U+017F>erv'd that none of them had any <U+017F>ignes of Life <U+017F>aving the Son, in whom were <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall tokens which pre<U+017F>ently vani<U+017F>h'd. The wonderment of all this was greatly increas'd, when a Gentleman of the Country, curious of <U+017F>eeing what was reported, let down a Dog, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd there a quarter of an hour, and was pull'd up again <U+017F>afe and <U+017F>ound. This Well twenty five foot deep, and of water but two, is inclos'd with a very ancient Wall at the foot of a good
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:66371:196"/>
high Hill, whereon <U+017F>tands the Ca<U+017F>tle of <hi>Tilliers</hi>: And which help'd not to dimini<U+017F>h the wonder, it had been clean<U+017F>ed by two men who found no hurt, nor any thing extraordinary in it, <U+017F>aving an odour <U+017F>tronger than el<U+017F>ewhere; the water being as clear as that of the Spring, and without any <U+017F>ediment. Now if it was mineral and malignant vapors that <U+017F>uffocated tho<U+017F>e that de<U+017F>cend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <U+017F>ame might have done the like upon tho<U+017F>e that fir<U+017F>t gave them vent.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That this Effect cannot be attributed to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors barely venomous, and of the nature of ordinary Poy<U+017F>ons, which corrupt our humours, <U+017F>ometimes after Applications, as the Plague and other Epidemical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es do; but this <U+017F>team is <U+017F>o oppo<U+017F>ite to Life, that it de<U+017F>troyes the <U+017F>ame in an in<U+017F>tant; which we cannot imagine to proceed from any other cau<U+017F>e but a mineral, which is far more active. The e<U+017F>cape of tho<U+017F>e that cleans'd the Well, may be attributed to the mud which <U+017F>meared the <U+017F>ides of the Well, and <U+017F>o kept the vapor in; till growing <U+017F>tronger by that re<U+017F>traint, it made way for its <U+017F>elf through that remaning cru<U+017F>t, and produc'd the above-mention'd di<U+017F>mal effects; emitting its Poy<U+017F>on in a <U+017F>trait line, according to the rectitude of the Well, which weakned the Pigeon in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort, that it was unable to ri<U+017F>e again; as 'tis reported that Birds fall down as they fly over the <hi>Mare Mortuum,</hi> or Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> in <hi>Judea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, 'Tis not probable that any <U+017F>uch <U+017F>limy cru<U+017F>t hindred this Effect at fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince the Dog let down afterwards found no hurt; unle<U+017F>s you think a new cru<U+017F>t aro<U+017F>e in that little time which pa<U+017F>s'd between the death of the Men, and the de<U+017F>cent of the Dog. This Effect therefore may probably be attributed to the <hi>Archaeus,</hi> or Central Fire, that Motor of Nature, which dries all the vapors of the Elements from the Centre to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, <U+017F>ubliming the principals of minerals, in order to make its Productions; and as the <U+017F>everal mixtures of the<U+017F>e elevated vapors are in <U+017F>ome places whol<U+017F>ome, to wit, in Bathes and mineral waters; <U+017F>o there are others de<U+017F>tructive of our Nature. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch elevation is not continual, but only at certain times, according to the motion of that grand Motor, and, particularly, of the Sun; hence Ar<U+017F>enical vapors have produc'd <U+017F>uch Effects at one time, and <U+017F>tifled tho<U+017F>e that de<U+017F>cended into a Well filled with them, which they have not done to tho<U+017F>e that clean'd it, nor to the Dog; in as much as tho<U+017F>e vapors were not rais'd at this time. And, perhaps, the<U+017F>e mineral vapors are not always <U+017F>ublim'd in <U+017F>uch a degree as to be mortiferous; otherwi<U+017F>e it would follow that none could ever labor in mines with <U+017F>afety, by rea<U+017F>on of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fumes.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>uch expellations could not extingui<U+017F>h the Fire of Life in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time, without <U+017F>ome fore-running <U+017F>ignes. But 'tis more probable, that this Effect proceeds from <U+017F>ome venomous Animal infecting the Air, which being confin'd in a place incapable of evaporation, and <U+017F>uckt by tho<U+017F>e that
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:66371:196"/>
de<U+017F>cend down the Well, they can no more <U+017F>ave them<U+017F>elves from Death, than in a pe<U+017F>tilent Air.

            <p>THis Que<U+017F>tion is divided in two points; Fir<U+017F>t, Whether a dead Body can be kept without art; Secondly, Whether it can be <U+017F>o by art; Nature being here oppos'd not to Art, but to what is <U+017F>upernatural. The fir<U+017F>t is hard, every Carka<U+017F>e having in it <U+017F>elf the principles of Coruption; becau<U+017F>e the harmony of qualities which caus'd to <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t being di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd, it advances of it <U+017F>elf to an annihillation: And Nature <U+017F>hould cea<U+017F>e her continual motion, if her <U+017F>ubject depriv'd of animal life <U+017F>hould always remain in one and the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tate. Yea, if Nature <U+017F>hould <U+017F>top her cour<U+017F>e in dead Bodies, and not be able to re<U+017F>olve them into other works, the Influences of the Heavens would be u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s in re<U+017F>pect of them, as al<U+017F>o their motion, which is in order to generations, which would cea<U+017F>e if there were no more corruption; whence the de<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Univer<U+017F>e in its parts would follow. Nor would the Elements act any more one again<U+017F>t another, remaining pure and <U+017F>imple, and incapable of any generation, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>iccity could no more act upon humidity, nor heat upon cold. It remains to enquire, Whether a dead Body may be pre<U+017F>erv'd by art; which <U+017F>eems po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, becau<U+017F>e we may by art de<U+017F>troy the activity of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and reduce them to a ju<U+017F>t and equal temperament capable of long pre<U+017F>ervation.

Now the way to pre<U+017F>erve dead bodies from corruption, is, to prevent the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of their parts; which is done by maintaining the connexion of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity with drine<U+017F>s; to which end all extrin<U+017F>ical heat and moi<U+017F>ture mu<U+017F>t be kept from them as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. Hence it is, that dead bodies are plac'd in <U+017F>ubterraneous places, and inclo<U+017F>ed in leaden Coffins, to the end, the cold and dry vapours <U+017F>ymbolizing with the qualities of Saturn, (which the Chymi<U+017F>ts make as ju<U+017F>tly pre<U+017F>ervative as the Poets make it de<U+017F>tructive) may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand extrin<U+017F>ecal heat and moi<U+017F>ture, and maintain the marriage of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <head>CONFERENCE CCX. Of the Remora.</head>
            <p>TIs a <U+017F>mall Fi<U+017F>h, half a foot long, called by the Greeks, <hi>Echeneïs,</hi> and, by the Latins, <hi>Remora</hi>; becau<U+017F>e 'tis thought to <U+017F>top the motion of Ships, by means of two <U+017F>cales wherewith it clo<U+017F>ely imbraces the keel. This common belief is founded upon many experiences reported by Authors, worthy of Credit. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, That <hi>Periander,</hi> having <U+017F>ent a Ship to <hi>Gnidos,</hi> with orders to ca<U+017F>trate all the principal Children of that I<U+017F>land, it was <U+017F>topp'd in the main <U+017F>ea <U+017F>o long time as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ite to <U+017F>end for other Orders contrary to the former by another Ship; and that in remembrance of this happy retardment, the two <U+017F>cales of this little fi<U+017F>h were in his time <U+017F>een hanging up near the Altar of <hi>Gnidia</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> The like happen'd to a Pretori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ship of <hi>Anthony</hi> at the battel of <hi>Actium,</hi> <U+017F>o that he could not advance to give Orders to his Naval Army. The Emperor <hi>Caligula,</hi> having <U+017F>et <U+017F>ail from <hi>Asturia,</hi> with a Gally of five banks, was likewi<U+017F>e con<U+017F>train'd to <U+017F>tay by the way with his Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el, the other Ships not <U+017F>uffering the <U+017F>ame ob<U+017F>truction; at which this Prince was <U+017F>o incens'd, that he pre<U+017F>ently commanded divers to <U+017F>eek out the cau<U+017F>e, who at length found this Fi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ticking to the helm of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el which they <U+017F>hew'd him about the bigne<U+017F>s of a Snail; and he was more <U+017F>urpris'd when he <U+017F>aw that it had not the like effect within the Ship as without; as 'tis <U+017F>aid, the foot of a Tortoi<U+017F>e being in a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, makes it move <U+017F>lowly. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the <U+017F>econd book of his Sympo<U+017F>iacks, affirms, That this Fi<U+017F>h was found <U+017F>ticking to the Ship which he hired, to <U+017F>ail into <hi>Sicily</hi>; and <hi>Rondeletius</hi> <U+017F>aith. That the Cardinal of <hi>Tourain</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for <hi>Rome,</hi> in a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el of three banks was a long time <U+017F>topp'd in a place at Sea by this little Fi<U+017F>h, which being taken was <U+017F>erv'd up to his table; though others write, that it is not fit to eat. But what they add, That its vertue of retarding is <U+017F>uch, that it is made u<U+017F>e of to hinder the Judgment of a Law-<U+017F>uit whereof the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue is fear'd; and al<U+017F>o in filtres to retain a Lover that de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>es his loving Mi<U+017F>tris, is as hard to believe, as 'tis to find con<U+017F>iderable rea<U+017F>ons for it, without having recour<U+017F>e to the ancient <hi>a<U+017F>ylum</hi> of tho<U+017F>e who de<U+017F>pair to find any, which is the <U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick form of this Fi<U+017F>h, which hath the <U+017F>ame faculty of <U+017F>topping Ships, that a Diamond hath of retaining the Vertue of the Load<U+017F>tone, and Garlick of hindering it to act: as the Ship ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea<U+017F>eth the fury of the Elephant; the Fig-tree, that of the Bull; and many other <U+017F>uch things, which though <U+017F>mall in bulk, are yet very great and virtuous; as they make appear in their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which are as <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible in their Effects, as they are occult in their Cau<U+017F>es.</p>

               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:66371:199"/>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the Remora worketh the <U+017F>ame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the Ship, that the Torpedo doth upon the hand of the Fi<U+017F>her, which becomes <U+017F>tupid, when he toucheth the <U+017F>ame with a long pole. Now of this effect of Remora is not hard to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, if we follow the Principles of <hi>Campanella,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e who allow <U+017F>en<U+017F>e to all, even the mo<U+017F>t gro<U+017F>s corporeal things. But this opinion being little received, 'tis better to <U+017F>ay, that whereas all natural things <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t only by the vici<U+017F><U+017F>itude of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and re<U+017F>t; wi<U+017F>e Nature, who is the principle of both, hath judiciou<U+017F>ly di<U+017F>penc'd them that they are found differently in <U+017F>ome things, and in others, and that for the good and ornament of the Univer<U+017F>e, which requires, that as they are bodies immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable by rea<U+017F>on of their <U+017F>cituation or u<U+017F>e, to wit, the Earth, and the Poles of the Heavens; others always in motion, to wit, the Heavens, Rivers, Air, and Fire; and others, endued with an attractive vertue, as the Load<U+017F>tone and Amber; <U+017F>o She hath given others a Quality contrary to this. Namely, the Remora, that of <U+017F>topping the motion of a Ship: and becau<U+017F>e motion and re<U+017F>t are contrary one to the other, their principles are no le<U+017F>s, as well tho<U+017F>e that are effective of motion, as tho<U+017F>e which cau<U+017F>e re<U+017F>t; but 'tis better to explicate them by their <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable effects, than by rea<U+017F>ons ordinarily frivolous and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, 'Tis no rare thing for Ships to be <U+017F>taid in the main Sea, whatever pains the Mariners take to make them go forward; and how favourable <U+017F>oever the Wind may be, the cau<U+017F>e whereof is no other but the contrary motion of the waves of the Sea, e<U+017F>pecially in <U+017F>treights and narrow places where there are <U+017F>trong Currents, which probably. <U+017F>topp'd <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Ship, and tho<U+017F>e other mentioned in Hi<U+017F>tory, rather than this little Fi<U+017F>h which 'tis credible can <U+017F>end <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong a Vertue from its <U+017F>mall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as to fix and check the far greater, and oftentimes irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tible force of the Winds and Sea. Unle<U+017F>s you had rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this retardment to the muco<U+017F>ity and other foulne<U+017F><U+017F>es wherewith Ships are cru<U+017F>ted in long Voyages, which hinder their advancing; and this Fi<U+017F>h being <U+017F>ometimes found in tho<U+017F>e mucous humidities, people mi<U+017F>take it for the cau<U+017F>e, though it no wi<U+017F>e contributed thereunto.</p>
            <p>The Fourth maintain'd, according to the opinion of <hi>Franca<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> That 'tis not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a Fi<U+017F>h as the Remora, to <U+017F>top a great Ship at full <U+017F>ail; but that this Effect is occa<U+017F>ion'd by Rocks indu'd with a Quality like that of the Load<U+017F>tone; upon which this Fi<U+017F>h u<U+017F>ing to re<U+017F>ide, when a Ship pa<U+017F><U+017F>es near them, their Adamantine Vertue attracts the <U+017F>ame towards them; whence the <U+017F>ame thing happens by the<U+017F>e two violent motions, <hi>viz.</hi> that wherewith the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el is driven along in the main Sea, and the attraction of the<U+017F>e Rocks, as when two equal forces draw a weight two <U+017F>everal ways, the thing remains unmov'd; <U+017F>o that this fi<U+017F>h is not the cau<U+017F>e, but only the <U+017F>ign of this retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:66371:199"/>The fifth <U+017F>aid, That if there were any <U+017F>uch magnetical vertue, in this ca<U+017F>e the nails and iron-works of the Ship <U+017F>o <U+017F>tay'd, would rather be taken away, than its cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>topt, the latter being more hard to do than the former; <U+017F>ince a little force <U+017F>ufficeth to pull a nail out of a Ship, who<U+017F>e impetuous motion, 'tis not po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible to withhold; whence <hi>Archimedes</hi>'s his drawing of a Ship out of the Port into the Market-place by his endle<U+017F>s <U+017F>erue, pa<U+017F>s'd for one of the goodlie<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecrets of the Mechanicks, though indeed it be nothing to the pre<U+017F>ent enquiry. And the truth is, this <U+017F>trange effect may be<U+017F>t be attributed to a hidden property, and <U+017F>ingular quality of this Fi<U+017F>h, which being always found <U+017F>ticking to the <U+017F>topped Ships, is more probably the cau<U+017F>e of that impediment, than any unknown Rocks, which ought to do the like to all Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that approach them, if there were any <U+017F>uch: For tis a vanity condemn'd by the mo<U+017F>t intelligent in the <U+017F>ecrets of Nature, to pre<U+017F>ume to give valid rea<U+017F>ons thereof, whil<U+017F>t we have none for the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and ordinary effects, for want of knowing the la<U+017F>t and proximate differences which con<U+017F>titute every thing in its E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, and di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h it from others; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ea<U+017F>ie to know, that the Remora, after the example of many other which act by a propriety of their form, produceth this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, without being needful to trouble our <U+017F>elves to find out the means it imploys in order thereunto.</p>

Which is further prov'd by Herbs which grow white under ground, and lo<U+017F>e as much of their heat and bitterne<U+017F>s, as they partake of <U+017F>uch whitene<U+017F>s, witne<U+017F>s the <U+017F>talks of Harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choaks and Savoury. Hot things would be red, and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Fire, which we <U+017F>ee gives that colour to faces formerly pale, to hot Iron and burning Wood; but a <U+017F>uperfluous humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <U+017F>upervening <U+017F>tifles, and extingui<U+017F>hes this heat, and leaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it the colour of corruption; as we <U+017F>ee the white<U+017F>t <U+017F>kin grows black by heat upon travelling Southwards; the contrary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to tho<U+017F>e that go Northwards.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That, if heat alone made Blackamoors, tho<U+017F>e that are mo<U+017F>t expos'd to the Sun-beams <U+017F>hould be the blacke<U+017F>t; but they are not <U+017F>o, there being many Nations of the New World, where it is <U+017F>o hot, that they go all naked, of an olive colour; whereas in <hi>Guiney, Aethiopia,</hi> and other places inhabited by Moors, they are cloth'd and feel more cold. And becau<U+017F>e this colour may be a<U+017F>crib'd to the reciprocation of heat and cold, which is more likely to alter men's bodies in all other qualities, than in a permanent one; there are found both black and white people under the <U+017F>ame parallels and elevation of the Pole; as in the I<U+017F>le of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> where the Inhabitants are white. Wherefore this colour mu<U+017F>t not be attributed to the Heaven but to the Earth, which produceth all other varieties of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, e<U+017F>pecially of men, as is ob<U+017F>erv'd in the <hi>Patagons,</hi> who are Gyants: To whom are oppos'd the Pigmies which their <U+017F>oil likewi<U+017F>e produceth. And to <U+017F>hew that the tincture of the <U+017F>kin is not the only particularity ob<U+017F>ervable in Negroes, they have many other Properties whereby they are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd from other Nations; as their thick lips, <U+017F>addle-no<U+017F>es, coar<U+017F>e <U+017F>hort hair, the horny tunicle of the eye, and the teeth whiter than the re<U+017F>t of men. Be<U+017F>ides, they are not only exempted from the Pox and other Venereous Maladies, but their Climate alone airs the <U+017F>ame. Not to mention the Qualities of their minds, which are <U+017F>o ignorant, that though they have plenty of Flax, yet they want Cloth, becau<U+017F>e they want <U+017F>kill how to work it; they abound with Sugar-canes, yet make no trade of them, and e<U+017F>teem Copper more than Gold, which they barter for the like weight of Salt; and are wholly ignorant of Laws and Phy<U+017F>ick. Which ignorance renders their <U+017F>pirits more ba<U+017F>e and <U+017F>ervile than tho<U+017F>e of other Nations; and they are <U+017F>o born to <U+017F>lavery, that even free men among the Aby<U+017F><U+017F>ins (the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable people of all <hi>Aethiopia</hi>) when they are employ'd by any one, take it not ill to be la<U+017F>h'd with a Bull's Pizzle, provided they be paid; and when their Prie<U+017F>ts exhort the people, they whip them till the blood comes, for the better inculcating of their In<U+017F>tructions, tho<U+017F>e being held in mo<U+017F>t reverence, who whip them mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>evere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; though they were the fir<U+017F>t Pagans who were converted to the Faith by Queen <hi>Candace</hi>'s Eunuch, who was in<U+017F>tructed by S. <hi>Philip.</hi> And as pu<U+017F>illanimous per<U+017F>ons are commonly the mo<U+017F>t

            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the ca<U+017F>e is the <U+017F>ame with the Negroes, in re<U+017F>pect of the color of their <U+017F>kin, and the other above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd particulars, as with the long heads of the Children of <hi>Paris,</hi> which Nature produceth at this day of her<U+017F>elf, ever <U+017F>ince the Midwives had form'd the fir<U+017F>t after that manner, upon a belief that this figure was more becomming and <U+017F>uitable to the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul than roundne<U+017F>s. So likewi<U+017F>e the heat of the Sun fir<U+017F>t blacken'd the <U+017F>kin of the Moors of either Sex by little and little; among<U+017F>t whom, the blacke<U+017F>t hides, the thicke<U+017F>t lips, and mo<U+017F>t evers'd being in e<U+017F>teem, every Mother endeavor'd to make her Childrens lips and no<U+017F>e of that figure; and Nature, helpt by their Imagination mov'd by the occurrence of like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, hath produc'd <U+017F>uch ever <U+017F>ince. But 'tis no wonder if the people of <U+017F>ome Countries, under the <U+017F>ame parallels and latitude indeed, but defended from the heat of the Sun by oppo<U+017F>ite Mountains, are exempt from the effect of that heat; as there are places in <hi>France,</hi> where upon the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on fruits are a month or two later in ripening than tho<U+017F>e of their Neighbors. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the fri<U+017F>l'd <U+017F>hort hair of Negroes is an effect of the <U+017F>ame heat, as al<U+017F>o their being exempted from the Pox, which being a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick cold poy<U+017F>on, as appears by its invading the <U+017F>permatick parts, and the encrea<U+017F>ing of its pains in the night more than day, 'tis more rea<U+017F>onable that the Temperaments oppo<U+017F>ite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <U+017F>uch as theirs who<U+017F>e fle<U+017F>h is very dry and void of Phlegm, be free from the <U+017F>ame. Now that Negroes abound not in Phlegm and Moi<U+017F>ture, appears in that they never <U+017F>pit in their Churches, not only out of cu<U+017F>tom, but expre<U+017F>s Law, which would never have been made if it had not been ea<U+017F>ie to ob<U+017F>erve. Moreover, the whitene<U+017F>s of their teeth is augmented by the blackne<U+017F>s of their faces: And as for their wits, <hi>Scaliger</hi> thinks them not really dull, but only out of de<U+017F>ign and craft, which always argues wit. Whence Geographers, who reckon Southern people among<U+017F>t the mo<U+017F>t ingenious, <U+017F>ay, They could never be brought to their duty

Be<U+017F>ides, their Characters are hand<U+017F>omer and more agreeable than either the Arabick or Turki<U+017F>h.

            <p>THough the union between the Body and the Soul be <U+017F>o <U+017F>trict, as to <U+017F>erve for a model to all other unions ob<U+017F>ervable in Nature, yet is it not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong but that <U+017F>ometimes it admits of a di<U+017F><U+017F>olution, which the Philo<U+017F>ophers conceiv'd po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, both tho<U+017F>e parts continuing entire. This <U+017F>eparation is call'd an <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy,</hi> wherein the <hi>Platoni<U+017F>ts,</hi> who fir<U+017F>t brought it into <hi>Vogue,</hi> plac'd the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> or greate<U+017F>t Felicity, ina<U+017F>much as they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that mens minds were thereby di<U+017F>engag'd from all material things; nay, from their very Bodies, by the clouds and humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereof they imagin'd, that the mind was di<U+017F>turbed in its functions, which, being equally <U+017F>piritual, are the more compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform'd, the more the Under<U+017F>tanding whereby they are produc'd, is di<U+017F>engag'd from this corporeal ma<U+017F>s. Whence it comes, that old men, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch as are near death, or in their <U+017F>leep, have clearer vi<U+017F>ions, and more certain predictions than young men, and tho<U+017F>e who are in perfect health, of a moi<U+017F>t Temperament, who are waking, and perform all their other functions. And whereas there is no great road between the highe<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>dom and the greate<U+017F>t extravagance, it may be further inferr'd, that tho<U+017F>e who are of a more dry Temperament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is as likely that fools as well as wi<U+017F>e men, may be, frequently have <U+017F>uch vi<U+017F>ions, and fall into tho<U+017F>e <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies</hi>; and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:66371:201"/>
that they mind not their own thoughts, are ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of external impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and the fir<U+017F>t objects which pre<U+017F>ent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves to them. So that we may make a di<U+017F>tinction of <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies</hi> into two kinds. The former is to be attributed only to great and contemplative per<U+017F>ons, and may be <U+017F>aid to be only a di<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of the mind, which is <U+017F>o taken up with the apprehen<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an object, that it quite forgets all its other functions. For the ca<U+017F>e is the <U+017F>ame with the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nder<U+017F>tanding,</hi> in reference to its object, which is <hi>Truth</hi>; as it is with the <hi>Will,</hi> in re<U+017F>pect of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object, to wit, <hi>Good,</hi> which it <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately affects, that it is not <U+017F>o much where it <hi>lives,</hi> as where it <hi>loves.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Under<U+017F>tanding being forcibly engag'd to a taking ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whereof it makes a particular ob<U+017F>ervation of all the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is <U+017F>o transform'd into it, that it cea<U+017F>es to act any where el<U+017F>e. Now the rea<U+017F>on of this, is, that knowledge or apprehen<U+017F>ion, as well as all the other functions, is wrought by a concour<U+017F>e of <U+017F>pirits, which being by that means, in a manner all employ'd in that tran<U+017F>cendent action, there are not enough remaining for the performance of other actions, the <U+017F>mall portion that is being wholly employ'd about re<U+017F>piration, nouri<U+017F>hment, and the other actions nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the Con<U+017F>ervation of Life. Accordingly, this kind of <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy,</hi> or ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of the functions is not only ob<U+017F>erv'd to happen in that conflict and contention of the mind, when it is wholly bent upon the examination of <U+017F>ome object, but al<U+017F>o in all the other actions which are perform'd with exce<U+017F>s: <U+017F>uch as for example, the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions are, the extraordinary violences whereof occa<U+017F>ion <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies,</hi> an extream grief ca<U+017F>ting a man down <U+017F>o much, that he becomes as it were <U+017F>tupid and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible. The <U+017F>ame thing happens al<U+017F>o through joy by a contrary effect, as well as in Anger, Fear, Audacity, and the other perturbations of the ira<U+017F>cible and concupi<U+017F>cible Appetites, by rea<U+017F>on of the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion or concentration of the <U+017F>pirits. Whence it follows, that it is not more <U+017F>trange to <U+017F>ee a man ravi<U+017F>h'd and fallen into an <hi>Ec<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> as it were out of him<U+017F>elf, in the contemplation of <U+017F>ome object, than to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o over-joy'd, as to die out of pure joy. For Knowledge being an action of the Under<U+017F>tanding, whereby it rai<U+017F>es and elevates to a <U+017F>piritual and incorporeal Being things that are mo<U+017F>t material, which are advanc'd in the Under<U+017F>tanding to a new and more perfect Being, than that which they had of their own Nature, the Under<U+017F>tanding renders them like it <U+017F>elf, and is <U+017F>o united to them, that there cannot be a greater conformity than what is between the object and the power whereby it is known. When therefore that object is of its own Nature <U+017F>piritual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, the Under<U+017F>tanding having di<U+017F>engag'd it <U+017F>elf from every other Subject, is <U+017F>o over-joy'd at its own knowledge, that it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets all other actions of le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>equence.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy</hi> is properly attributed to Lunaticks and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tracted per<U+017F>ons, and is by Phy<U+017F>icians plac'd among the highe<U+017F>t irregularities, cau<U+017F>ed by black Choler in the minds of <U+017F>uch as
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:66371:202"/>
are much inclin'd to Melancholy; in whom it cau<U+017F>es an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit, which inclines them to imagine, <U+017F>peak, or do things that are ridiculous and extravagant; <U+017F>ometimes with fury and rage, when that humor is enflam'd, and converted into black Choler, and <U+017F>ometimes with a <U+017F>tupid <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s, when it continues cold and dry.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the <hi>Greek</hi> word <U+017F>ignifying an <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy,</hi> is ordinarily taken for every change of condition whatever it may be; <U+017F>ometimes for a tran<U+017F>portation and elevation of mind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man comes to know things ab<U+017F>ent, as it was explicated in the precedent part of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Such peradventure was the taking up of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> even while he liv'd, into that blisful Seat of the Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed, which he calls the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> allowing the Air to be one, and the <U+017F>tarry-<U+017F>ky to be another: And that of Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangeli<U+017F>t, which he <U+017F>peaks of in the <hi>Revelation</hi>; Nay, before them, <U+017F>uch were tho<U+017F>e of the Prophets, and, after them, tho<U+017F>e of many other per<U+017F>ons, if we may give any credit to Hi<U+017F>torians. Such was that of the Abbot <hi>Romuald,</hi> who, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great difficulty to read the P<U+017F>alms of <hi>David,</hi> became, in an <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy</hi> he had as he was <U+017F>aying Ma<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o learned, that he was able to interpret the mo<U+017F>t intricate pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of them. Such was that of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> the Founder of the Order of <hi>Franci<U+017F>cans,</hi> who, in a ravi<U+017F>hment, receiv'd upon his body the marks of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Such was Saint <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who frequently fell into <U+017F>uch an <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy,</hi> that he <U+017F>eem'd dead to all that were about him. Such was <hi>John Scot,</hi> commonly known by the name of the <U+017F>ubtle Doctor, to whom the <U+017F>ame thing happen'd <U+017F>o often, that his mo<U+017F>t familiar friends <U+017F>eeing him as he <U+017F>ate reading or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, found him many times immoveable and without <U+017F>entiment, in<U+017F>omuch that he was carry'd away from the place for dead; and yet the<U+017F>e two la<U+017F>t, were rais'd up <U+017F>o illuminated from that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophical Death, that they have left but few imitators of their great Learning. The <U+017F>ame thing is affirmed of a certain Virgin, nam'd <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who<U+017F>e Sen<U+017F>es were <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o <U+017F>tupifi'd, that <U+017F>he continu'd a long time in a manner dead; from which kind of Trance being come to her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he fore-told <U+017F>ome things, which afterwards came to pa<U+017F>s according to her predictions. To be <U+017F>hort, there are few Mona<U+017F>teries of either Men or Women, but affirm as much of their Founders. And that it may not be imagin'd, that <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>eparation of Body and Soul happened during this Life only to Enthu<U+017F>ia<U+017F>m, or a highly-contemplative meditation of divine things, which neverthele<U+017F>s mu<U+017F>t be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd the common cau<U+017F>e of it; we read of <hi>Epimenides</hi> of <hi>Creet,</hi> and <hi>Ari<U+017F>teas</hi> the <hi>Proconne<U+017F>ian,</hi> eminent Poets and Philo<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that <U+017F>ometimes they left their Bodies without Souls; which, having taken their progre<U+017F>s about the world, return'd after a certain time, and re-animated their Bodies. Nay, <hi>Pliny</hi> hath a pretty remarkable Story, how that the Soul of this <hi>Ari<U+017F>teas</hi> was many times perceiv'd to take her flight out of his Body,

under the form of a Crow; and that his Enemies having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd it, and on a time met with his Body in that po<U+017F>ture, burnt it, and by that means di<U+017F>appointed the Bird of her ne<U+017F>t. <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> relates a Story yet much more prodigious, of <hi>Hermotimus</hi> the <hi>Clazomenian,</hi> to wit, that his Soul made Voyages of <U+017F>everal years; having left his Body, during that time, without any <U+017F>enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while <U+017F>he went up and down into divers parts of the world, fore-telling Earth-quakes, great Droughts, Deluges, and <U+017F>uch other remarkable Accidents. And further, that this thing having <U+017F>everal times happen'd to him, he had given his wife a <U+017F>trict charge that no Body <U+017F>hould touch his Body during his Soul's being abroad upon the account afore<U+017F>aid; but <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance bearing him a grudg, having with much importunity obtain'd of her the favour to <U+017F>ee his Body lying on the ground in that immoveable po<U+017F>ture, they caus'd it to be burnt, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Soul's return into it; which yet it being not in their power to do, and the <hi>Clazomenians</hi> being inform'd of that injury done to <hi>Hermotimus,</hi> built him a Temple, into which Women were forbidden to enter. And <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Daemon or Genius, confirming this Relation, and allowing it to be true, affirms, that tho<U+017F>e who had committed that crime, were then tormented in Hell for it. Saint <hi>Augu<U+017F>tine</hi> in his Book of the <hi>City of God,</hi> Lib. xiv. relates, that a certain Prie<U+017F>t, named <hi>Re<U+017F>titutus,</hi> when-ever, and as often as, he was de<U+017F>ir'd to do it, became <U+017F>o in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible at the mournful tone of <U+017F>ome lamenting voice, and lay <U+017F>tretch'd along as a dead Carka<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o as that he could not be awak'd by tho<U+017F>e who either pinch'd or prick'd him; nay, not by the application of fire to <U+017F>ome part of his Body, ina<U+017F>much as he could not feel any thing while he continu'd in the <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy,</hi> only afterwards it was perceiv'd that he had been burnt, by the mark which remain'd upon his Body after he was come to him<U+017F>elf; before which time be had not any re<U+017F>piration, and yet he would <U+017F>ay, that he had heard the voices of tho<U+017F>e who had cry'd aloud in his Ears, calling to mind that he had heard them <U+017F>peaking at a great di<U+017F>tance. The <U+017F>ame Author in the xix. Book of the <U+017F>ame Work, affirms, that the Father of one <hi>Prae<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was apt to fall into <U+017F>uch <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies,</hi> that he believ'd him<U+017F>elf chang'd into a Pack-Hor<U+017F>e, and that he carry'd Provi<U+017F>ions upon his back into the fields with other Hor<U+017F>es, when all the while his Body continu'd immoveable in the Hou<U+017F>e. Among other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this kind of <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy, Bodin</hi> in his <U+017F>econd Book of his <hi>Daemonomania, chap.</hi> 5. relates a <U+017F>tory of a certain Servant-maid living in the <hi>Danphine,</hi> having been found lying all along upon a dung-hill, in <U+017F>uch a dead <U+017F>leep that all the noi<U+017F>e made could not awake her; nay, her Ma<U+017F>ter's banging her with a <U+017F>witch not prevailing any thing, he ordered fire to be <U+017F>et to the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and tendere<U+017F>t parts of her Body, to try whether <U+017F>he were really dead or not. Which being upon tryal believ'd, they left her in the <U+017F>ame place till the morning; and then <U+017F>ending to look after
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:66371:203"/>
her, <U+017F>he was found very well in her bed. Whereupon the Ma<U+017F>ter a<U+017F>king her, What <U+017F>he had been doing all the night before? Ah, Ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, how unmercifully have you beaten me? Upon that di<U+017F>covery <U+017F>he was accus'd for a Witch, and confe<U+017F>s'd it. To be <U+017F>hort, <hi>Cardan</hi> in his eighth Book of the <hi>Variety of Things,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms of him<U+017F>elf, that he fell into an <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy</hi> when he pleas'd; in<U+017F>omuch that he <U+017F>leightly heard the voices of tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>poke to him, but under<U+017F>tood them not; Nay, what is more, was not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of any pinching, nor yet feeling the exqui<U+017F>ite pain of his Gout, whereto he was much <U+017F>ubject; as being not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible at that time of any thing but that he was out of him<U+017F>elf. He afterwards explicates the manner how that <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy</hi> is wrought, affirming, that he felt it begin at the Head, e<U+017F>pecially in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Brain, and thence <U+017F>pread it <U+017F>elf all along the Back-bone. He affirmed further, that at the very beginning of it he was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of a certain <U+017F>eparation about the Heart, as if the Soul with-drew at a kind of wicket, or <U+017F>ally-port, the whole Body concerning it <U+017F>elf therein; and adds, that then he <U+017F>ees what-ever he would with his Eyes, and not by the <U+017F>trength of the Under<U+017F>tanding, and that tho<U+017F>e Images which he <U+017F>ees are in a continual tran<U+017F>iency and motion, in the re<U+017F>emblance of Fore<U+017F>ts, Animals, and <U+017F>uch other things: The Cau<U+017F>e whereof he attributes to the <U+017F>trength of the Imagination, and <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of the Sight. He further relates of his Father <U+017F>uch things as are much more miraculous, and occa<U+017F>ion'd the <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of his being a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.</p>
            <p>Now from all the<U+017F>e Sacred and Prophane Hi<U+017F>tories, it may be inferr'd that of <hi>Ecstacies,</hi> <U+017F>ome are <hi>miraculous,</hi> and others <hi>natural.</hi> The former not <U+017F>ubmitting to ordinary Cau<U+017F>es any more than all the other things do that concern Religion, which <U+017F>tands much upon the preheminence of being above Rea<U+017F>on. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proceeding from the great di<U+017F>proportion there is between the Body and the Mind, the one being extreamly vigorous, the other extreamly weak. Whence it follows, that there are two <U+017F>orts of per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>ubject to <hi>Natural Ec<U+017F>tacies,</hi> to wit, tho<U+017F>e tran<U+017F>cendent Minds which are di<U+017F>pos'd into weak Bodies, and weak Minds in <U+017F>trong and robu<U+017F>t Bodies; ina<U+017F>much as there being not a perfect connexion and corre<U+017F>pondence between them, the Soul finds it no great difficulty to di<U+017F>engage her <U+017F>elf from the Body, or the Body from the Soul, which by that means obtains a freedom in her operations, it being <U+017F>upposd that they do not all at depend one upon another, as may be <U+017F>een in the Formation of the Embryo, wherein. the Soul making her <U+017F>elf a place of aboad plainly <U+017F>hews, that <U+017F>he is able to act without it, as al<U+017F>o in <U+017F>woundings and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, during which, the Body continues <U+017F>o de<U+017F>titute of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, that no active faculty, at lea<U+017F>t no operation of the Soul, is ob<U+017F>ervable in it.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Vegetative Soul, which is without motion, being the fir<U+017F>t whereby we live, it is not to be much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:66371:203"/>
if the other two Souls, to wit, the Sen<U+017F>itive and the Rational do <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>eparate them<U+017F>elves from it; and this is that which they call <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy</hi>: whereof we have a certain in<U+017F>tance in all the faculties, wich are in like manner <U+017F>eparated one from another, without the lo<U+017F>s of their Organs. Accordingly, he who is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>harp-<U+017F>ighted as to the Under<U+017F>tanding, hath common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but a weak corporeal <U+017F>ight; the mo<U+017F>t robu<U+017F>t Body is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyn'd to the weake<U+017F>t Mind: Tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons who walk and talk in their <U+017F>leep, do al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hew that the Rational Soul does quit the Government of the Body, and leaves it to the direction and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive; and the <U+017F>ame thing may be al<U+017F>o <U+017F>aid of the Vegetative exclu<U+017F>ively to the other two. To come to In<U+017F>tances: we have at this day the experience of <U+017F>ome, who continue a long time in <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies,</hi> and that not only in matters of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but al<U+017F>o in <U+017F>ome things of little concernment, which they are not able to comprehend; nay, there are <U+017F>ome have the knack of falling into Trances and <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies</hi> when they plea<U+017F>e them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves. And this hath been affirm'd to me of a certain per<U+017F>on who was able to do it, without any other trouble than this: He caus'd to be painted on the wall a great Circle all white, in the Centre whereof he <U+017F>et a black mark, and after a long continu'd looking upon it, the Vi<U+017F>ual Spirits being by degrees di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated, brought his Soul into a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> or Dizzine<U+017F>s, which occa<U+017F>ion'd the <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the opinion of <hi>Bodin,</hi> which allows a <U+017F>eparation between the Souls and Bodies of Witches and Sorcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, having been invented only to render a rea<U+017F>on of what they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm they had <U+017F>een, during the time their Bodies had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, is not to be believ'd without <U+017F>ome further proof; <U+017F>ince it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible even by that to explicate the Relations which they make of tho<U+017F>e places, where they <U+017F>ay they had been, and the things they had there done; ina<U+017F>much as they po<U+017F>itively affirm, that they had made tho<U+017F>e progre<U+017F><U+017F>es with their Bodies and all their members, and that they had made u<U+017F>e of them in eating, drinking, and performing <U+017F>uch other actions as are purely corporeal, and cannot be imagin'd done in a <U+017F>tate of <U+017F>eparation, as being not compatible to <U+017F>eparated Spirits, which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, <U+017F>tand in need of Bodies to a<U+017F><U+017F>ume corporeal affections, and perform tho<U+017F>e bea<U+017F>tly Actions whereof Sorcerers talk <U+017F>o much.</p>
            <p>To this may be added, that this <U+017F>eparation cannot be wrought without death, and, that <U+017F>uppos'd, it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible the Souls <U+017F>hould re-enter into their Bodies otherwi<U+017F>e than by a real re<U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which is an act that God hath <U+017F>o re<U+017F>erv'd to him<U+017F>elf, that the Devil is not capable of doing it: Nay, though it were in his power, it is rather to be imagin'd that he would be far enough from taking <U+017F>ouls out of their bodies, and di<U+017F>robing them of their <U+017F>en<U+017F>ual inclinations, ina<U+017F>much as he does all lies in his power, to involve the Souls of Men more and more<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> into their Bodies, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:66371:204"/>
make them wallow in <U+017F>en<U+017F>uality, and render all their affections corporeal. Accordingly, great and generous Souls, <U+017F>uch as are mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>engag'd from the Body, are not fit for that purpo<U+017F>e; <U+017F>ince <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and all the other Ma<U+017F>ters of that dete<U+017F>table profe<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion, require Simplicity in tho<U+017F>e who would be Sorcerers, as a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary and previous di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition. So that if the Souls of Sorcerers, which are at fir<U+017F>t engag'd, and afterwards continu'd in the Devil's <U+017F>ervice, only in pro<U+017F>ecution of the concerns of the Body, came to be deve<U+017F>ted of that heavy ma<U+017F>s whereby they are encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and <U+017F>tripp'd of the inclinations of the Body, no doubt they would break off <U+017F>o di<U+017F>advantagious a bargain, at lea<U+017F>t they would not find any delight in the diverti<U+017F>ements where-with the Devil does amu<U+017F>e them. It is therefore more probable, that the Devil <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ometimes ca<U+017F>t Sorcerers into a certain <U+017F>leep, and bind up their common <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o as that they are rendred incapable of receiving external impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and that in the mean time, he <U+017F>hould joyn together the different <U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Memory, and rai<U+017F>e in the Imagination <U+017F>uch repre<U+017F>enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof as are conformable to the truths which are made el<U+017F>e-where. So that the Under<U+017F>tanding not receiving any thing from without, which might undeceive it, is wholly taken up with the <U+017F>pecies it hath within; the apprehen<U+017F>ion of Sorcerers being much like tho<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons, who having their brains either weakned by Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, or naturally receive <U+017F>uch an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion from their dreams, that when they awake, they are hardly able to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h them from the things they have <U+017F>een. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which is commonly called a Diabolical <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy,</hi> de<U+017F>erves not the name, <U+017F>ince it is only the ca<U+017F>ting of one into a dead <U+017F>leep. Tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es which Phy<U+017F>icians call <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies,</hi> as Catalep<U+017F>ies and Madne<U+017F>s, are only <U+017F>uch improperly; and the <U+017F>ame thing is to be <U+017F>aid of tho<U+017F>e kind of <U+017F>woundings, which have frequently been taken for <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies</hi> in <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons, who having continu'd their Contemplations beyond the <U+017F>trength of their Bodies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <U+017F>wounded out of pure weakne<U+017F>s, have upon the recovery of them<U+017F>elves, imagin'd, that their Minds had been tran<U+017F>ported into real <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies,</hi> and yet can give no account of what had pa<U+017F>s'd during the time of their Trance. The precedent <U+017F>tories, and tho<U+017F>e which may be thereto added, of <hi>Socrates, Archimedes,</hi> and <U+017F>ome others, do not prove that, naturally, there can be any <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy</hi>; for either tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>tories <U+017F>eem to be palpably fabulous, or only <U+017F>hew that the Souls of tho<U+017F>e Ec<U+017F>tatical Per<U+017F>ons had not broke off all corre<U+017F>pondence with the Body, nor quitted the a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es and their Organs, that they might be wholly involv'd in them<U+017F>elves, and <U+017F>o re<U+017F>ign them<U+017F>elves to Meditations purely Intellectual. For he who <U+017F>hall examine the example of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as it is related in <hi>Plato,</hi> will look upon that action rather as a tryal, which <hi>Socrates</hi> made of his own Patience, than as a real <hi>Ecstacy,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince <hi>Socrates</hi> is imagin'd <U+017F>tanding; a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture requiring the motion of the Mu<U+017F>cles, which pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:66371:204"/>
<U+017F>entiment in the exterior parts. Accordingly, dead bodies, as al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e wherein the action of the Soul is check'd and hindred, are not found <U+017F>tanding, though the <hi>Athenians</hi> have <U+017F>huffled in, among their <U+017F>tories, a tale of one of their men who <U+017F>tood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right after he had been kill'd. The other In<U+017F>tances are of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons who meditated with <U+017F>uch earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s and attention on their own thoughts, and directed their minds with <U+017F>o much violence towards that <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, whereof they had mo<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion, that the other <U+017F>en<U+017F>es were de<U+017F>titute of Spirits and without action, not di<U+017F>cerning their own proper objects if they were not extreamly violent, which is no real <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy,</hi> ina<U+017F>much as otherwi<U+017F>e we mu<U+017F>t call Sleep an <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy.</hi> And, indeed, the mo<U+017F>t refin'd and <U+017F>ubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Meditations, which we derive from tho<U+017F>e <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies,</hi> <U+017F>mell <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong of the Body and Matter, that it is probable, they were not the pure productions of the Soul, no way diverted by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turbances of the Body and the internal <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, on which <U+017F>he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively depends, even in the inorganical actions <U+017F>he does; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for her to meditate alone, <U+017F>ince that in her direct actions <U+017F>he <U+017F>tands in need of the Imagination, and mu<U+017F>t be excited by Phanta<U+017F>ms; but above all, <U+017F>he cannot be without Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which always furni<U+017F>hes her with the matter of her <U+017F>pecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and re<U+017F>erves the <U+017F>pecies of them. Be<U+017F>ides, tho<U+017F>e who are of opinion, that all the faculties of the Soul while <U+017F>he is in the Body are organical, cannot imagine any <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy</hi> wherein the Soul meditates by her <U+017F>elf, without any commerce with the Body and its <U+017F>entiments; and tho<U+017F>e, who conceive, that the faculties of the Under<U+017F>tanding and Will borrow nothing of the Organs but the objects of their actions, do neverthele<U+017F>s inferr, that the Soul <U+017F>tands in need of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, in order to the doing of her actions, and is not over-earne<U+017F>t in the doing of them, but when <U+017F>he is excited by the Phanta<U+017F>ms, for the <U+017F>tirring whereof the Animal Spirits are ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, which takes away all conceit of <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies.</hi> And tho<U+017F>e who imagine, that in <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacies</hi> the Soul hath no corre<U+017F>pondence with them, and makes no u<U+017F>e of them in her actions, do, by that means, in<U+017F>tead of e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing de<U+017F>troy the <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy</hi>; <U+017F>ince it mu<U+017F>t be inferr'd, that the Soul du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of tho<U+017F>e retir'd meditations, leaves the Spirits in the Organs, who<U+017F>e function it is in the mean time to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the external objects, and convey them into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sen<U+017F>e, and thence into the Imagination and Memory; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 'tis expected, that the <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy</hi> <U+017F>hould leave the Body without action. Whence therefore, I conclude, that there is not any at all, in regard that an <hi>Ec<U+017F>tacy</hi> <U+017F>ignifying a <U+017F>tate of the Soul, be<U+017F>ides that which is natural to her, and be<U+017F>ides the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence there is between the actions of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, and tho<U+017F>e that are proper to the Rational Soul; it may be affirm'd, that <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tate never happens, and that the Soul <U+017F>hall not be ab<U+017F>olutely freed from the incumbrances and di<U+017F>tractions of the Body till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death.

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXIII. Of the Cock, and whether the Lyon be frightned at his Crowing.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Germans</hi> being engag'd upon an expedition of War had <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to carry a Cock along with them, to <U+017F>erve them for an incitement and example of Vigilance. Thence haply proceeded the cu<U+017F>tom, which <U+017F>ome Mule-drivers and Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goners <U+017F>till ob<U+017F>erve of having one fa<U+017F>ten'd to the leading Mule or Hor<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>ometimes for want of that, adorning them with a plume of his or <U+017F>ome other feathers. 'Twas upon this account, that <hi>Phidias</hi>'s <hi>Minerva</hi> had a Cock upon her head-piece, unle<U+017F>s it be attributed to this, that the <U+017F>aid Godde<U+017F>s had al<U+017F>o the pre<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and direction of War, where there is no le<U+017F>s need of Vigilance than Indu<U+017F>try; though that Bird belongs to her <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently upon the <U+017F>core of his other qualities, as being <U+017F>o gallant and courageous, as many times rather to lo<U+017F>e his Life upon the <U+017F>pot, than quit the de<U+017F>ire of victory; and when he is engag'd, fighting with <U+017F>uch fury, that <hi>Caelius Aurelian</hi> relates that one who had been peck'd by a Cock in the heat of fighting, grew mad upon it. For the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Anger being a <U+017F>hort fury, 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible it may extreamly heighten the degree of heat, in a temperament already <U+017F>o highly cholerick, that in time the body of the Cock becomes nitrous; and upon that con<U+017F>ideration, is pre<U+017F>crib'd to <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>ons for the loo<U+017F>ening the belly, and that after he hath been well beaten with a wand, and the feathers pluck'd while he is alive before he is boyl'd. It may be further urg'd, that this Courage of the Cock was the motive which inclin'd <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Per<U+017F>ia</hi> to grant him, who kill'd Prince <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of carrying on his Javelin a little Cock of Gold, as a <U+017F>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular acknowledgement of his Valour. Whereupon the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Province of <hi>Caria,</hi> whereof he who had the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid priviledge of the Cock was a Native, in imitation of him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead of Cor<U+017F>lets wore Cocks upon their head-pieces; whence they had the name of <hi>Alectryons,</hi> or Cocks, in Latin <hi>Galli,</hi> which po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly is the rea<U+017F>on that gave the French that name: And whereas the Cock commonly crows after he hath beaten ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it came al<U+017F>o to be the Hieroglyphick of Victory, and that
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:66371:205"/>
haply gave the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>acrifice a Cock when they had overcome their Enemies.</p>
            <p>This Creature was al<U+017F>o dedicated to <hi>Mars,</hi> and the Poets feign, that he had <U+017F>ometime been a young Souldier, whom that God of War order'd to <U+017F>tand <U+017F>entinel when he went in to <hi>Venus</hi> to give him notice of <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s return; but he having <U+017F>lept till after the Sun was ri<U+017F>en, and by that neglect of duty <hi>Mars</hi> being <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with her, he was <U+017F>o incens'd that he metamorphos'd him into a Cock; whence it comes, <U+017F>ay they, that being ever <U+017F>ince mindful of the occa<U+017F>ion of his transformation, he ever crowes when the Sun approaches our Horizon. This fable, how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <U+017F>oever it may be thought, is as <U+017F>upportable as that of the <hi>Alcaron,</hi> which attributes the crowing of our Cocks to one which it <U+017F>aies there is in Heaven; a Cock of <U+017F>uch a va<U+017F>t bulk, that having his feet on the fir<U+017F>t of the Heavens, the head reaches to the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; and this Cock crowing above, awakens and incites all tho<U+017F>e upon Earth to do the like, as the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t <U+017F>et one another a crowing, as if they all crow'd at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant all over the world.</p>
            <p>The Cock was al<U+017F>o dedicated to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s <hi>Latona, Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina</hi>; whence it came that the Novices, and <U+017F>uch as were initiated in their my<U+017F>teries, ab<U+017F>tain'd from the eating of it. It was al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>ame to <hi>Mercury,</hi> in regard that vigilance and early ri<U+017F>ing are requi<U+017F>ite in Merchants. And thence it came that he was painted under the form of a Man <U+017F>it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, having a Cre<U+017F>t or Comb on his Head, Eagle's claws in<U+017F>tead of Feet, and holding a Cock upon his fi<U+017F>t. But there was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular con<U+017F>ecration made of him to <hi>Ae<U+017F>culapius,</hi> which oblig'd <hi>Socrates</hi> at his death to entreat his Friends to <U+017F>acrifice a Cock to him, <U+017F>ince the Hemlock where-with he was poy<U+017F>on'd had wrought well. The Inhabitants of <hi>Calecuth</hi> <U+017F>acrifice him to their divinity under the form of a he-goat: And <hi>Aco<U+017F>ta,</hi> after <hi>Lucian,</hi> affirms, that anciently the Cock was ador'd as a God; which Chri<U+017F>tianity not enduring, hath order'd them to be plac'd upon Churches &amp; on the tops of <U+017F>teeples, and other very high <U+017F>tructures, that by their turning about they might tell the beholders which way the Wind blew; unle<U+017F>s haply <U+017F>ome would refer it to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> at the <U+017F>econd crowing of one of them. As concerning the crowing of this Creature, it is commonly attributed to his heat, and may be a certain di<U+017F>covery of his joy at the approach of the Star of the <U+017F>ame temperament with him. And whereas he is more <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible than any other of the impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions of the Air, (whence it comes that being moi<U+017F>ten'd by the vapors, he crows with a hoar<U+017F>er voice, which Labourers look on as a prediction of Rain) it may be thence con<U+017F>equent, that he is the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the coming of the Sun. Moreover, whereas there is a Solar Animal, <U+017F>uch as is al<U+017F>o the Lyon, but in a lower degree than he, the <U+017F>pecies of Birds being hotter and dryer, as being lighter than that of four-footed Bea<U+017F>ts; it thence follows,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:66371:206"/>
that the Cock hath an a<U+017F>cendent over the Lyon, which no <U+017F>ooner hears his crowing, but it awakens in his Imagination tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>pecies which cau<U+017F>e terror to him: Unle<U+017F>s we would rather affirm, that the <U+017F>pirits of the Cock are communicated to the Lyon, by that more than material voice; and as <U+017F>uch more capable of acting, than the <U+017F>pirits i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the Eyes of <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>ons, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s infect tho<U+017F>e who are well, and look on them; nay, if we may believe the Poet, bewitch even innocent Lambs.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That this error of the Lyon's being terrifi'd at the crowing of the Cock, was to be added to the number of all tho<U+017F>e vulgar ones, which had occa<U+017F>ion'd <U+017F>o much beating of the Air in the <U+017F>chools and pulpits about Maxims which are di<U+017F>cover'd to be ab<U+017F>olutely fal<U+017F>e in the Practick; it being a thing not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that <U+017F>ome Lyon which had been tam'd, and by change of nouri<U+017F>hment become cowardly and degenerate, had been a little <U+017F>tartled at that <U+017F>hrill crowing of the Cock, grating of a <U+017F>udden upon his ears. And this conjecture will not be thought <U+017F>trange by tho<U+017F>e, who, about the beginning of <hi>March</hi> la<U+017F>t, 1659. were pre<U+017F>ent at an engagement which had been appointed between <U+017F>uch a Lyon and a Bull in a Tennis-Court at <hi>Rochel</hi>: The Lyon was <U+017F>o frightned at the <U+017F>ight of the Bull, that he got up into the Lights precipitating the Spectators, who had planted them<U+017F>elves there in great numbers, as e<U+017F>teeming it the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t place of all; and thence he <U+017F>lunk away and hid him<U+017F>elf, and could never afterwards be gotten into the li<U+017F>ts. It may al<U+017F>o be imagin'd, that the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F>s and novelty of that Crowing might <U+017F>urprize <U+017F>ome Lyon that had never heard it before, by rea<U+017F>on of his living at a great di<U+017F>tance from Cities and Villages, where tho<U+017F>e Creatures are commonly bred, and that thence it came the Lyon was <U+017F>tartled at that fir<U+017F>t motion. Moreover, 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, nay, it may be more than probably affirm'd, that <U+017F>ome have taken that <U+017F>tartling out of indignation, ob<U+017F>ervable in the Lyon when any thing di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>es him for an argument of his fear, whereas it was a di<U+017F>covery of his being incens'd. For to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a real and general fear in that generous Creature, upon <U+017F>o <U+017F>leight an account as the crowing of a Cock, I cannot <U+017F>ee any probability for it, in regard that corre<U+017F>pondence and conformity which is attributed to them, <U+017F>hould rather occa<U+017F>ion a Sympathy in them, than any thing of aver<U+017F>ion, which being fully as great as that which the Sheep hath for the Wolf, <U+017F>hould no more frighten the Lyon, than the bleating of the Sheep does the Wolf. Nor is it <U+017F>o much out of an aver<U+017F>ion and Antipathy which the Wolf hath for the Sheep, that he devours and converts it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, as out of kindne<U+017F>s and love to his own pre<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and there are commonly <U+017F>een about tho<U+017F>e hou<U+017F>es, where Lyons are kept, <U+017F>everal Cocks and Hens, and yet the Lyons never make any di<U+017F>covery of their being frighted at their crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or crakling. Nay, for a further confirmation hereof, it comes into my mind, that I have <U+017F>een a young Lyon devour a
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:66371:206"/>
Cock, which, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, crow'd no more than tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> a Village of the Province of <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>alonica</hi> in <hi>Macedon,</hi> where the Cocks do not crow at all. But if there were <U+017F>uch an Antipathy between them, as <U+017F>ome would have imagin'd, the Lyon would have thought it enough to tear him to pieces, and not eat him as he did. And therefore it is to be conceiv'd, that what hath given occa<U+017F>ion to this error, is the moral <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, which <U+017F>ome would draw from it; to <U+017F>hew, that the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t are not free from a certain fear, which they conceive of tho<U+017F>e things whence they <U+017F>hould lea<U+017F>t expect it. So that, to put this Que<U+017F>tion, Why the Lyon is frightned at the crowing of the Cock, is, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for the cau<U+017F>e of what is not.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That we are not to make <U+017F>o <U+017F>leight an account of the authority of our Ance<U+017F>tors, as ab<U+017F>olutely to deny what they have affirmed to us, and <U+017F>eems to be <U+017F>ufficiently prov'd by the <U+017F>ilent acquie<U+017F>cence of <U+017F>o many Ages, under pretence that we are not able to re<U+017F>olve it: Which were to imitate <hi>Alexander,</hi> in cutting the <hi>Gordian</hi> knot, becau<U+017F>e he could not unty it. It were much better to endeavor to find out in the nature of the Cock and in his crowing, the cau<U+017F>e of the Lyon's being frightned thereat. Let it then be imagin'd, that the Lyon being an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal always in a Fever through an exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive choler, whereof his hair and violence are certain marks; the <U+017F>ame thing happens to him as to <U+017F>ick and feveri<U+017F>h per<U+017F>ons, to whom noi<U+017F>e is in<U+017F>upport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, e<U+017F>pecially to tho<U+017F>e, in whom a cholerick humor enflam'd cau<U+017F>eth pains in the Head: Nay, there are <U+017F>ome kinds of <U+017F>ounds which <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons are not able to endure, yet <U+017F>o as that they cannot a<U+017F><U+017F>ign any cau<U+017F>e thereof, and <U+017F>o as that we are forc'd to explain it by Specifick Properties and Antipathies; <U+017F>uch as we may imagine to be between the crowing of a Cock and the ear of a Lyon. And that is much more probable then the <U+017F>topping of a Ship by the <hi>Remora,</hi> when <U+017F>he is under all the <U+017F>ail <U+017F>he can make, and a thou<U+017F>and other effects imperceptible to rea<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>uch as whereof only Experience can judge; and therfore that terror which the Lyon is put into at the crowing of the Cock, is not <U+017F>o irrational; that Sovereign of Animals having ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e to admire, how from <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a Body there comes a voice <U+017F>o <U+017F>hrill and <U+017F>trong, as to be heard at <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>tance, con<U+017F>idering with him<U+017F>elf what mi<U+017F>chief he does with <U+017F>o little noi<U+017F>e; and this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Lyon is increas'd if the Cock be all white, ina<U+017F>much as that colour promotes the diffu<U+017F>ion of his <U+017F>pirits already di<U+017F>pers'd by the fir<U+017F>t motion of his apprehen<U+017F>ion.</p>

            <p>The mo<U+017F>t famous of all, and <U+017F>he to whom the Ancients gave greate<U+017F>t credit, was the <hi>Cumaean,</hi> who, under the form and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of an old woman not known to any, came to <hi>Tarquinius Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbus,</hi> to whom <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ented nine Volumes of Oracles, which <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid he <U+017F>hould have for three hundred <hi>philippus</hi>'s; whereat the King took occa<U+017F>ion to laugh, as if the old woman were grown a child again, to a<U+017F>k <U+017F>o great a <U+017F>umm for <U+017F>uch incon<U+017F>iderable Books: Which <U+017F>he perceiving, went away and burnt three of them; and coming again to make him a <U+017F>econd proffer of the <U+017F>ix remaining, demanded the <U+017F>ame price <U+017F>he had a<U+017F>k'd for all the nine; and the King having laugh'd at her as before, and being confirm'd in his conceit of her being di<U+017F>tracted, <U+017F>he burnt three more of them; but returning the third time, and a<U+017F>king of him the fir<U+017F>t mention'd <U+017F>umm for the three that were left, <hi>Tarquin</hi> a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at that per<U+017F>everance, con<U+017F>ulted the Augurs what he <U+017F>hould do; whereto their An<U+017F>wer was, that, in all liklihood, they were <U+017F>ome Coun<U+017F>ells <U+017F>ent by the Gods to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> for the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of it, which he <U+017F>hould not any longer refu<U+017F>e. Accordingly he order'd her to have what <U+017F>he demanded; and having advis'd him to be very careful in the keeping of tho<U+017F>e Books, <U+017F>he vani<U+017F>h'd, and was never after <U+017F>een either in that King's Court, or any where el<U+017F>e, which much heightned the opinion already conceiv'd of her Divinity. <hi>Tarquin</hi> recommended the<U+017F>e Books to the keeping of two per<U+017F>ons of good repute, which number was afterwards mutiply'd to ten, elected one half out of the people, the other out of the Senate: And afterwards it came to fifteen, and <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd till it ro<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ixty, but <U+017F>till kept the name of the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decim viri,</hi> which receiv'd their period with all the other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theni<U+017F>h ceremonies in the time of <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius.</hi> Only tho<U+017F>e per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons were permitted to read the Books of the Sibyls, and their <U+017F>uper<U+017F>tition came to <U+017F>uch a pitch, that there was not any thing <U+017F>o
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:66371:208"/>
holy and <U+017F>acred in <hi>Rome,</hi> as tho<U+017F>e Books; in<U+017F>omuch that when any thing occurr'd, wherein the Roman State was highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, as the Pe<U+017F>tilence, civil War, or when their forreign Wars were not carry'd on with the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s they had promis'd them<U+017F>elves; their recour<U+017F>e was to tho<U+017F>e books of the Sibylls, whence they pump'd out the remedies and advices which they had to give the Senate and People. This was ob<U+017F>erv'd till the time of the Social War, when, <hi>Cains Norbanus</hi> and <hi>Publius Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> being Con<U+017F>uls, the Capitol was burnt, and with it all the <U+017F>acred things, and among them the Books of the Sibylls. But <U+017F>oon after the reparation of the Capitol, <hi>Scribonius Curio</hi> and <hi>Cneus Octavius</hi> being Con<U+017F>uls, there came out an Edict from the Senate, that three Deputies <U+017F>hould go, as they did, to <hi>Erythrae,</hi> and other Citties of <hi>Italy, Greece,</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>ia,</hi> whence they brought to <hi>Rome</hi> about a thou<U+017F>and Ver<U+017F>es written by divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons, with the names of the Sibylls to whom they were attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And it is from the ignorance of <U+017F>o many hands, as had been employ'd in the writing of tho<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es, that the many faults found therein proceeded; as being <U+017F>uch as oblig'd <hi>Tiber,</hi> to correct tho<U+017F>e errours, and di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ititious ver<U+017F>es from the true ones, to order that every one <U+017F>hould bring in to the Praetor, of <hi>Rome</hi> whatever he had of them, with a prohibition that any <U+017F>hould retain Copies thereof <U+017F>ave only the <hi>Quindecim viri,</hi> who<U+017F>e Office and Name receiv'd its period at the la<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of the Sibylline Books made by the command of <hi>Stili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> Father-in-law to the Emperor <hi>Honorius,</hi> thinking by that means to rai<U+017F>e a <U+017F>edition again<U+017F>t his Son-in-law, and <U+017F>o to transfer the Empire to his own Son <hi>Eucherio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is all we have of certainty concerning the Hi<U+017F>tory of the Sibylls, who may be probably conjectur'd to have prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd by a certain Enthu<U+017F>ia<U+017F>m and divine in<U+017F>piration, which was granted them according to the acknowledgment of the Fathers, as a reward of their Virginity; it being not imaginable, that the many noble things they have foretold, even to the highe<U+017F>t my<U+017F>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Salvation, <U+017F>hould proceed from the evil Spirit, much le<U+017F>s from the motion of Nature, the <U+017F>trength whereof is not able to come up to Prediction.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the vain de<U+017F>ire, which men of all times have been inclin'd to, of knowing things to come, having put them upon an unprofitable con<U+017F>ultation of Heaven, Earth, and Waters, to find out whatever might bring them any tidings thereof, they have not let <U+017F>lip any occa<U+017F>ion which they conceiv'd might inform them; their <U+017F>uper<U+017F>tition being come to that height as to draw con<U+017F>equences and pre<U+017F>ages from all things, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to <U+017F>earch into the very entrails of Bea<U+017F>ts, and the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres of the Dead: Nay, what is yet more, if they have deriv'd a certain divination from the very chirping of Birds, whence their Augurs receiv'd their name, it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, they <U+017F>hould give credit to the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es and Songs of

young Maids and Women. For, among tho<U+017F>e who were called Sybills, there were <U+017F>ome married, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>he who writ the fir<U+017F>t book of the Oracles attributed to them; which Sibyll <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he had been in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, with her Husband, her Father-in-law, her Mother-in law, her Brothers-in-law, and her Si<U+017F>ters-in law, who con<U+017F>equently had not the gift of Prophecy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tow'd on them, upon the account of their Virginity: And though, according to the te<U+017F>timony of <hi>Eu<U+017F>ebius,</hi> and mo<U+017F>t of the other Eccle<U+017F>ia<U+017F>tical Authors, there was not any Sibyll more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then <hi>Mo<U+017F>es</hi>; yet does the Sibyll before-mentioned foretell the coming of <hi>Mo<U+017F>es,</hi> and the Deluge, at which by that means <U+017F>he could not have been pre<U+017F>ent; for things pre<U+017F>ent are never fore-told. But what brings the credit of their Works into grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, is, that tho<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es do them<U+017F>elves di<U+017F>cover, that they were written fifteen hundred years after the beginning of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, and con<U+017F>equently, whatever they tell us of <hi>Mo<U+017F>es,</hi> the raign of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Empire of the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> all which preceded that time, are <hi>Hi<U+017F>tories,</hi> which they obtrude upon us for <hi>Prophecyes.</hi> And all the My<U+017F>teries of our Salvation contain'd in the Sibylline Ver<U+017F>es, are, in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <U+017F>ame Nature.

Be<U+017F>ides, the too exact ob<U+017F>ervance of order in tho<U+017F>e Writings, is an argument that they were not the productions of per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>ubject to Fanatici<U+017F>m, <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>ome would have the Sibylls to be, who writ upon the leaves of Trees, the Ver<U+017F>es which their Enthu<U+017F>ia<U+017F>m dictated to them. And to conclude, there is no probability, that the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ay,</hi> who hath <U+017F>poken more clearly of the Incarnation than

any other, <U+017F>hould think it enough to <U+017F>ay, <hi>A Virgin <U+017F>hould bring forth a Son</hi>; and that the Sibyll <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, before the thing came to pa<U+017F>s, <hi>The Virgin</hi> Mary <hi><U+017F>hall bring forth a Son named</hi> Je<U+017F>us <hi>in Bethleem:</hi> there is no probability, I <U+017F>ay, that God <U+017F>hould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tow greater illuminations on tho<U+017F>e Women, whom Antiquity ranked among the Prie<U+017F>te<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> than on the mo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pir'd among his Prophets. Whence it is to be ju<U+017F>tly imagin'd, that <U+017F>ome Chri<U+017F>tians were the Authors of tho<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es, who piou<U+017F>ly thought to make <U+017F>ome advantages thereof again<U+017F>t the Pagans, who gave credit to other Writings which were then in vogue and repute under that name: as there are <U+017F>ome in our days who father on <hi>No<U+017F>tradamus</hi> <U+017F>uch things as he never thought of, and that after they are come to pa<U+017F>s; under pretence that there is <U+017F>ome mention made thereof in that confu<U+017F>ion of matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he treats. This will not be thought <U+017F>trange by tho<U+017F>e, who con<U+017F>idering the multitude of accidents, which that Author hath <U+017F>huffled into his <hi>Centuries,</hi> whereof the varieties are <U+017F>o great, that it is no hard matter to find therein mo<U+017F>t occurrences of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life; as we <U+017F>ee that in <U+017F>yllables diver<U+017F>ly tran<U+017F>pos'd and put together, all things in the world may be found.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the Ancients are not be thought <U+017F>o cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, as to attribute <U+017F>uch authority to the Sibylls, if there had not been <U+017F>ome young Maids and Women, who had effectually fore-told things to them. True it is, chance may be fortunate in one or two ca<U+017F>es, as a blind Archer may ca<U+017F>ually hit the mark; but it is very unlikely, that one who cannot <U+017F>hoot at all, <U+017F>hould have the reputation of a good Archer all the world over. And yet Authors are full in a<U+017F><U+017F>erting the authority, wherein the an<U+017F>wers made by tho<U+017F>e women were. <hi>Virgil</hi> grounding his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cour<U+017F>e on that common per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>ays,

And it was ordinary to in<U+017F>cribe on Monuments the names of tho<U+017F>e who were appointed for the keeping of tho<U+017F>e books of the Sibylls and took care for the Sacrifices, which the <hi>Romans</hi> offered up, to appea<U+017F>e the wrath of the Gods, according to the coun<U+017F>el, which, as occa<U+017F>ion requir'd, they took from their ver<U+017F>es. Nay, there was <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>trict prohibition that any <U+017F>hould have them in their private Libraries, that one of tho<U+017F>e who were entru<U+017F>ted with the cu<U+017F>tody of the Sibylline Books, named <hi>Marcus Atilius,</hi> was <U+017F>own up in a bag, and ca<U+017F>t into the Sea, for lending <hi>Petroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Sabinus</hi> one of tho<U+017F>e Books to be tran<U+017F>crib'd, or, as <U+017F>ome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, only their <U+017F>imple Commentary, containing the <U+017F>ecrets of

For, as to the in<U+017F>erting of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ititious ver<U+017F>es into the body of their Works, it <U+017F>hould be no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to them, then it is to tho<U+017F>e of the mo<U+017F>t excellent Authors, among which the <U+017F>purious productions of others are <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>huffled in. And if it be true, that <hi>Homer</hi>'s Ver<U+017F>es were at fir<U+017F>t confu<U+017F>edly pronounced by him, and that it hath been the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of others, to reduce them into that noble order, wherein we read them, Why <U+017F>hould the <U+017F>ame ob<U+017F>ervance of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be cen<U+017F>ur'd in the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of the Sibylline Ver<U+017F>es? <hi>Plato,</hi> in his <hi>Theagines,</hi> affirms, That <hi>Socrates</hi> acknowledged them to be Prophete<U+017F><U+017F>es; and in his <hi>Phoedon,</hi> the <U+017F>ame <hi>Socrates</hi> <U+017F>hews, by their example, That extravagance or di<U+017F>traction of mind does many times bring great advantages to Mankind. <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> in the fir<U+017F>t que<U+017F>tion of the thirtieth Section of his <hi>Problems,</hi> affirms, That Women become Sibylls, when the brain is over-heated, not by <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, but through a natural di<U+017F>temper.

            <p>OF Natural Bodies, <U+017F>ome move from the Centre to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, as Fire; others, from the Circumference to the Centre, as the Earth; others, are in the mean between both, as Air and Water, the latter whereof inclines downwards, but both of them are principally de<U+017F>ign'd to fill the <hi>Vacuum.</hi> Whence it comes, that the Air de<U+017F>cends as much, nay, fa<U+017F>ter to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Well when it is dry'd up, than the Water had done before; which con<U+017F>ideration, hath given occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>ome to attribute a mean, or circular Motion to tho<U+017F>e two Elements, as they have done a direct Motion to the two fir<U+017F>t. And whereas the<U+017F>e two kinds of Local Motion, to wit, the direct and the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, are the Principles of the Mechanicks, the mo<U+017F>t profitable parts of the Mathematicks, and that among the <U+017F>aid Motions, that which tends downwards, which proceeds from weight, is the mo<U+017F>t ordinary Agent, and <U+017F>uch as is the mo<U+017F>t commonly us'd in Machins or Engins, where it is the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable, either for the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance it gives to fixt and <U+017F>etled in<U+017F>truments, or for the ob<U+017F>truction it gives tho<U+017F>e which are moveable; thence comes that famous di<U+017F>pute there is, concerning the cau<U+017F>es of Motion from above to beneath. Which <U+017F>ince it mu<U+017F>t needs proceed from one of the<U+017F>e three, to wit, the weight of the Body de<U+017F>cend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lightne<U+017F>s of the mean through which the de<U+017F>cent is made; or from the impul<U+017F>ion of the <U+017F>aid mean: Or, la<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the attraction made by the Centre; the Que<U+017F>tion is, To which of tho<U+017F>e three Cau<U+017F>es that Motion is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd? If it be attributed to the weight, it will follow, that
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:66371:211"/>
the heavie<U+017F>t Body <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>cend <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t; if to the impul<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the celerity or <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s of the Agent <U+017F>hall accordingly render that Motion <U+017F>wift or <U+017F>low; but, if only the attraction made by the Centre be the Cau<U+017F>e of it, the le<U+017F><U+017F>er weight <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>cend as fa<U+017F>t, nay, fa<U+017F>ter than the greater, upon the <U+017F>ame account as that the <U+017F>ame piece of Load<U+017F>tone more ea<U+017F>ily draws a <U+017F>mall needle than it does a great key. Nor can Experience always a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t us in this ca<U+017F>e, in regard the different compo<U+017F>ure and form of heavy Bodies, as al<U+017F>o the diver<U+017F>ity of the means, and the variety of the Agents, whereby they are thru<U+017F>t forwards, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to make an allowable Compari<U+017F>on between them. Thus a ball of Cork, which de<U+017F>cended as fa<U+017F>t in the Air as one of Lead, <U+017F>hall not do the like in the water, to the bottom whereof the Lead <U+017F>hall fall, but not the Cork. And again, the <U+017F>ame Lead being put into the form of a Gondola, or other hollow ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, <U+017F>hall <U+017F>wim on the water, which it could not before: A Cloak, folded clo<U+017F>e together into a bundle, <U+017F>hall have a <U+017F>peedy de<U+017F>cent in both Air and Water; but let a Man fa<U+017F>ten the <U+017F>ame Cloak under the arm-pit, <U+017F>o as that it may <U+017F>pread into a circle, it <U+017F>hall <U+017F>o <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain him the Air, that he <U+017F>hall fall very gently, and receive no hurt by his fall. Hence it al<U+017F>o comes that many Women have been <U+017F>av'd, when, falling into the Water, their Clothes were <U+017F>pread all abroad. The <U+017F>ame thing may al<U+017F>o be ob<U+017F>erv'd in tho<U+017F>e frames be<U+017F>et with Feathers, or cover'd with Paper, which Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren call Kites, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain in the Air, and <U+017F>uffer to be carryed away with the Wind, giving them ever and anon little checks or jerks by drawing the pack-thread to them whereby they are held, imitating in that action the beating of the wings in Birds. In fine, the different manner of giving the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hock to weighty Bodies, does accordingly diver<U+017F>ifie their Motion towards the Centre. For as the impul<U+017F>ion made downwards ha<U+017F>tens its bent towards the Centre; <U+017F>o when it is forc'd circularly, it is retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whence it comes that a gla<U+017F>s <U+017F>o ca<U+017F>t down that it hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain turns by the way, does <U+017F>ometimes fall to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking. But to <U+017F>peak ab<U+017F>olutely, all conditions being <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd equal, it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem that the more weighty a Body is, the <U+017F>ooner it falls to the Centre: And this is made good by daily Experiences, as may be <U+017F>een in the weighing of Gold and Silver in the balance, which hath a <U+017F>peedier and <U+017F>horter ca<U+017F>t, when the piece is much weightier or lighter, than it hath when there is but half a grain difference between both the <U+017F>cales.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the Nature of weight or heavine<U+017F>s was to be number'd among the occult things. <hi>Aristotle</hi> defines it to be a Quality inclining Bodies downwards and towards the Centre. Others would have it to be an Effect of den<U+017F>ity, which proceeds from the great quantity of Sub<U+017F>tance and Matter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and contracted in a <U+017F>mall room. There are yet others, who would have it to be an impul<U+017F>ion or fa<U+017F>tning of one Body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, in order to Motion downwards: But, to come nearer
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:66371:211"/>
the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, it is only the relation or report there is between a Body and its mean, and its compari<U+017F>on with another Body. According to this account of it, the <U+017F>ame piece of Gold is <U+017F>aid to be light in re<U+017F>pect of one weight, and heavy in re<U+017F>pect of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; Wood is heavy in the Air, and light in the Water; Tin is light in compari<U+017F>on of Gold, though very weighty in re<U+017F>pect of Wood. Whence it follows, that weight hath only a re<U+017F>pective being, and <U+017F>uch as depends on <U+017F>ome other thing, and not on it <U+017F>elf: The Cau<U+017F>e of it therefore is not to be <U+017F>ought in it <U+017F>elf, but el<U+017F>e-where; as mu<U+017F>t be that of the recoiling of a Tennis-ball, which is not in the Ball, nor in the arm of him that playes, nor yet in the walls of the Tennis-Court, but re<U+017F>ulting from all the<U+017F>e three<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> together. And whereas Experience <U+017F>eems to decide the Que<U+017F>tion propos'd, 'tis fit we <U+017F>hould refer our <U+017F>elves to it. Now it is certain, that of two Bodies of unequal weight, and of the <U+017F>ame Figure and Matter, equally forc'd, or <U+017F>uffer'd to fall, the one will as <U+017F>oon come to its Centre as the other; as tho<U+017F>e may <U+017F>ee who <U+017F>hall let fall at the <U+017F>ame time from the top of a Tower, two leaden bullets, one of two pounds, and the other of a quarter of a pound, both which will come to the ground at the <U+017F>ame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant; the rea<U+017F>on whereof is, That the <U+017F>tronger impul<U+017F>ion in the bullet of two pounds, meets with a <U+017F>tronger re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Air to break through as it falls, than that of quarter of a pound. Whence we are to make a di<U+017F>tinction between the greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul<U+017F>ion which the weightier Body makes upon another Body, and the celerity or <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s of the Motion wherewith it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cends; a hundred weight being heavier on the <U+017F>houlders of a Porter, than one pound, but not coming <U+017F>ooner to the ground than it. In like manner, a <U+017F>tone de<U+017F>cending <U+017F>o much the more <U+017F>wiftly the nearer it comes to its Centre, clearly <U+017F>hews, that it derives the force of its Motion from the Centre, as its principle; as we conclude, that the <U+017F>trength of a bullet is <U+017F>pent, and the Motion of it grows fainter, the further it is at a di<U+017F>tance from the arm and gun from which it came, and which we hold to have been the cau<U+017F>e and principle of it.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the weightie<U+017F>t Bodies make the more ha<U+017F>te to their Centre, the nearer they approach it; for their weight is increas'd by their approaching of it; gravity, in the <U+017F>cent of weighty Bodies, increa<U+017F>ing by the continuance of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, quite contrary to violent Motion, which admits of remi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion thereby; artifice, it <U+017F>eems in this point giving place to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <U+017F>o as that the latter never grows weary, nay, is infallible in all her Motions, and that <U+017F>uch a propen<U+017F>ion of weight to the centre, is the only certain rule to draw direct lines to that centre; and which is yet the more certain, the greater the weight is. And whereas the Mind of Man judges the better of things when they are oppos'd one to the other, behold one of tho<U+017F>e little Atomes which dance up and down in the beams of the Sun <U+017F>triking in at a window, it is a Body <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain'd in the Air only by its <U+017F>malne<U+017F>s,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:66371:212"/>
and requires a long time to make an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in that part of the Air which is under it, which thing cannot be <U+017F>aid of a Mu<U+017F>ket-bullet: It is therefore deducible thence, that the heavie<U+017F>t Bodies de<U+017F>cend fa<U+017F>te<U+017F>t to the Centre.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That we are not to <U+017F>eek for any other rea<U+017F>on for the <U+017F>peedier de<U+017F>cent of heavy Bodies, than there is in all the other Motions of Nature, which proceed from the in<U+017F>tinct im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by her in all things, of loving their good, which is their re<U+017F>t and natural place, which till they have attain'd, they are in perpetual di<U+017F>quiet; and whereas the heavier a Body is, the more parts there are in it, concern'd in the pur<U+017F>uance of that good, it is not to be wonder'd if it happens to them as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <U+017F>ollicitors in the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e, who pre<U+017F>s it more earne<U+017F>tly than one alone would do. We may therefore <U+017F>ay, that the <U+017F>ame natural in<U+017F>tinct that makes the Mulberry-tree expect till the cold weather be over before it buds; and the Halcyons till the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<U+017F>ts be pa<U+017F>t, before they build their ne<U+017F>ts, and makes them to <U+017F>ecure their young ones before the Rain, may much rather cau<U+017F>e the mo<U+017F>t ma<U+017F><U+017F>ie and weighty Bodies to make more ha<U+017F>te. For the<U+017F>e, fore-<U+017F>eeing that the Centre is not able to lodge all the Bodies tending thereto, endeavour to get to it as <U+017F>oon as they can, adding to their ha<U+017F>te the nearer they approach it. But the mo<U+017F>t certain rea<U+017F>on of this <U+017F>peedier Motion, is the general rule, that the more the Cau<U+017F>e is increas'd, the more is the Effect augmented; whence it follows, that if weight be the Cau<U+017F>e of Motion downwards, the greater the weight is, the more inten<U+017F>e ought to be the Motion.</p>

            <p>THe u<U+017F>e of Silk was brought over from the <hi>Ea<U+017F>t-Indies</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> above a thou<U+017F>and years <U+017F>ince, and was particularly introduc'd into <hi>Italy</hi> by two Religous Men, who brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the grain of it <U+017F>omewhat above three hundred years <U+017F>ince; in which Country of <hi>Italy,</hi> that commodity hath been much cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and that upon <U+017F>everal accounts; as, the preciou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of it, the ea<U+017F>ie tran<U+017F>portation from one place to another, by rea<U+017F>on of its lightne<U+017F>s: And, la<U+017F>tly, for that it is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal in<U+017F>truments of Luxury, which never wanted Partizans and Abettors in any Age, not to mention the great advantages and wealth attending the manufacture of it. The Latine word <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum,</hi> is receiv'd from that of <hi>Seres,</hi> an Oriental people, who were more <U+017F>edulous in the cultivation of it than any other: and the <U+017F>ame thing hath happen'd to this, as to many other excellent
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:66371:212"/>
productions deriv'd from mean and de<U+017F>picable Principles. For the Animal, from who<U+017F>e labour we have the <U+017F>ilk, is an In<U+017F>ect, as are all tho<U+017F>e which <U+017F>pin, to wit, the Spider and the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar, and it differs in nothing from this latter, <U+017F>ave that the Caterpillar hath a little hairine<U+017F>s, and the <U+017F>ilk of the Silk-worm is <U+017F>tronger than the web of the Caterpillar, and of another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but as to figure and bulk there is little difference between them. Whereto may be added, that their production is much at one, as being as it were hatch'd of certain eggs, living on leaves, enclo<U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves in certain webs, out of which they make their way, after they are become a kind of Butterflies, by a <U+017F>trange Metamorpho<U+017F>is, which forces them from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity to another, that is, from the nature of Reptiles to that of Volatiles: which transformation is <U+017F>uch, as, were it not for the frequency of it, might be plac'd among the greate<U+017F>t miracles of Nature, con<U+017F>idering the great difference there is between tho<U+017F>e two forms. And that indeed is <U+017F>uch as hath given <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to doubt, whether the Silkworm becoming a Butterfly did not change its Species, as it would be true, were it not that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing produces its like; and the Silkworm deriving its birth from the <U+017F>eed of the Butterfly, it is an argument that both are of the <U+017F>ame Species. Thus much as to their progre<U+017F>s. The Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> commonly furni<U+017F>hes us with the be<U+017F>t grain or <U+017F>eed of the<U+017F>e worms, which are like heads of pins, but black, or re<U+017F>embling Rape-<U+017F>eed <U+017F>omewhat flatted on both <U+017F>ides: This grain, <U+017F>ometime in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> being put between two warm pillows, or expos'd to the Sun, enclos'd in the linings of ones cloaths, or otherwi<U+017F>e chafed by a moderate heat, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any moi<U+017F>ture, there are produc'd of it little certain worms of the <U+017F>ame colour, that is, black at their fir<U+017F>t coming forth, which by rea<U+017F>on of their <U+017F>malne<U+017F>s, as re<U+017F>embling the points of needles, pa<U+017F>s through certain little holes made in a paper, wherewith they are cover'd, and fa<U+017F>ten them<U+017F>elves on the Mulbery-leaves, which are al<U+017F>o placed on the <U+017F>aid paper full of little holes, upon which leaves all the be<U+017F>t grain being hatch'd, within five or <U+017F>ix days, goes creeping after the fir<U+017F>t worm that gets out of her <U+017F>hell; all that is hatch'd afterwards never coming to any good. The<U+017F>e worms are thence tran<U+017F>ported, with the leaves laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on little boards or hurdles, into a temperate place, and di<U+017F>pos'd in a light<U+017F>om and <U+017F>pacious room, where they are entertain'd with fre<U+017F>h leaves twice a day, among which tho<U+017F>e of the white Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery makes finer <U+017F>ilk than tho<U+017F>e of the black; for want whereof the leaves of the Ro<U+017F>e-bu<U+017F>h, Lettice, and <U+017F>ome others may be u<U+017F>ed: but though the Worm makes a <U+017F>hift to <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t by that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment, yet either it will not <U+017F>pin at all, or the Silk will be like the web or clue wrought by the Caterpillars. Thus it feeds for the <U+017F>pace of forty days, during which it becomes grey, and changes its colour four times, not eating for <U+017F>ome days before each change, by rea<U+017F>on of the fulne<U+017F>s it is then <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible

of. The Worm is <U+017F>ubject to certain di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; and tho<U+017F>e ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige <U+017F>uch as have the care of them to remove them out of one room into another, and that even when they are dying in great quantities; Perfume, Incen<U+017F>e, Benjamin, Vinegar, and Wine recovering and comforting them; as al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>mell of broyl'd Bacon. To prevent which Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and the a<U+017F><U+017F>aults of Flies and Pi<U+017F>mires, who will make havock among them, they are very carefully to be kept clean, the boards on which the leaves lie to be rubb'd with wormwood, or <U+017F>prinkled with Wine, which mu<U+017F>t be well dry'd up before they come near them, all moi<U+017F>ture being hurtful to them, as al<U+017F>o <U+017F>alt, or the hands that have handled it.

When their time of <U+017F>pinning draws nigh, which is about <U+017F>ix weeks after their being fir<U+017F>t alive, at which time they are about the bigne<U+017F>s of a man's little finger, more tran<U+017F>parent than they u<U+017F>e to be, and the little <U+017F>nowt <U+017F>o lengthen'd as that it repre<U+017F>ents the form of a No<U+017F>e, the Animal by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary motion, expre<U+017F><U+017F>es the inconvenience it endures by rea<U+017F>on of its burden: Then is it cleans'd oftner, and there is <U+017F>o much the le<U+017F>s given it to eat, and afterwards they <U+017F>et on the boards <U+017F>ome dry'd branches of Heath, Broom, or Vines, and above all of Birch, as being the mo<U+017F>t delicate and lea<U+017F>t prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, lea<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould prick the Worm, or entangle the Silk. Then you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee them fa<U+017F>ten their fir<U+017F>t threds, and ca<U+017F>ting out of their mouths a kind of coar<U+017F>e <U+017F>leeve <U+017F>ilk, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that which is finer and more perfect, in one continu'd thread, accompany'd by a gum, which makes it <U+017F>tick one to another, <U+017F>o that the worm does encompa<U+017F>s it <U+017F>elf with that <U+017F>ilk, which is commonly yellow, very <U+017F>eldom greeni<U+017F>h or white, and being come to the end of the clue, hath only <U+017F>o much room as it takes up. Then, for the <U+017F>pace of fifteen days, it remains im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and is cover'd with a <U+017F>kin or film like that which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the fruit of the Pine-tree, under it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But the<U+017F>e fifteen days being over (of which tho<U+017F>e will abate <U+017F>ome, who are de<U+017F>irous to make advantage of the Silk, and trouble them<U+017F>elves not what becomes of the grain) the Silkworm, though it <U+017F>eem'd to have been dead, breaks through its web, and comes out in the form of a white and horned Butterfly, bearing a certain image of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urrection; then coming together, the Male, which is <U+017F>maller coupling with the Female that is bigger, the latter <U+017F>heds her <U+017F>eed upon a clean paper, <U+017F>pread under her for the reception of it. The <U+017F>eed being carefully put into a box is either kept for the next year, or <U+017F>old by the ounce; they commonly keep as much as comes from a hundred Males, and <U+017F>o many Females; the grain or <U+017F>eed whereof before their copulation is barren. Now

if they be de<U+017F>irous to get <U+017F>ilk out of it, which is the principal advantage, in order to which the Worms are kept, about fifteen days after they are compleated, the<U+017F>e webs are ca<U+017F>t into water, <U+017F>omewhat better than luke-warm, and the Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren employ'd about that work, <U+017F>tir the water with an handful of Birch, till they have fa<U+017F>ten'd on <U+017F>even or eight ends of <U+017F>ilk, which having done, they wind it up into <U+017F>kains, and that is the raw <U+017F>ilk.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That it is to be imagin'd the u<U+017F>e of Silk was ab<U+017F>olutely unknown to the <hi>Jews,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially when we con<U+017F>ider, that in the works of that magnificent Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they <U+017F>par'd not any thing of what they thought mo<U+017F>t precious, there is no mention made of Silk, in<U+017F>tead whereof they made u<U+017F>e of Goats-hair, and other precious Fleeces. But it was no <U+017F>trange commodity to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>; not to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <U+017F>ince that <hi>Pari<U+017F>atis,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> was commonly wont to <U+017F>ay, that Kings were always to be <U+017F>poken to in <hi><U+017F>ilken</hi> words; nor yet to the latter, ina<U+017F>much as they had <U+017F>ome gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments all of Silk, which they call'd <hi>Vestes holo<U+017F>ericas.</hi> Which is the more creditable, in regard that the Inhabitants of <hi>China</hi> who made u<U+017F>e of it above a thou<U+017F>and years before us, have very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Books, whereof the paper is made of Silk. In the interim, through the revolution of times, which makes that unknown in one age, which was familiar in another, it hath happen'd, that <hi>Pliny,</hi> never having <U+017F>een any, relates <U+017F>trange <U+017F>tories of it, calling the Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm a Fly, though it be not transform'd into a Fly, as was <U+017F>aid before, till after it hath fini<U+017F>h'd its working of Silk. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirms, that this worm makes its ne<U+017F>t in dirt, or clay, and that <U+017F>o hard, that in<U+017F>truments of iron cannot penetrate it; that in the <U+017F>aid ne<U+017F>t it makes more wax, then Bees do, and leavs in it a Worm, bigger than the other Flyes. Afterwards not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>atisfi'd with him<U+017F>elf, he brings in a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which <U+017F>hews indeed that he had heard <U+017F>ome talk of our Silk-worm, but that he had never <U+017F>een any, nor met with any certain account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when he <U+017F>ays, That Silk came from a Worm that had two horns, which worm brings forth certain Caterpillars, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender that which is call'd <hi>Bombylius,</hi> out of which comes the Worm, which produces that, which makes the Silk, and all the<U+017F>e productions, and the making of the Silk perform'd in <U+017F>ix Months: the la<U+017F>t Worms, <U+017F>aith he, making a web of <U+017F>ilk like that of a Spider, and that the fir<U+017F>t who ever found out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of unweaving and unravelling that web, that <U+017F>o <U+017F>ome u<U+017F>e might be made of the Silk, was <hi>Pamphila,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona,</hi> of the I<U+017F>land <hi>Coos.</hi> In fine, to make the <U+017F>tory yet more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous, he <U+017F>ays, that in the I<U+017F>land of <hi>Lango,</hi> the Silkworms are engendred of the Flowers, which the Rain cau<U+017F>es to fall from Turpentine-trees, A<U+017F>hes, Oaks, and Cypre<U+017F>s Trees, enliven'd by the vapours which exhale out of the earth; being at fir<U+017F>t little naked Butterflies, which afterwards get a little hairine<U+017F>s, to <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecure

them from the cold, and their feet are <U+017F>o rough that they fa<U+017F>ten on all the Cotten they meet upon the leaves of Trees, and make their <U+017F>ilk of it; then they break it with their feet, card it with their claws, and having reduc'd it to <U+017F>ilk, hang it up between the boughs of Trees, where they comb it, to make it the finer, and that done, they wind them<U+017F>elves within it, as within a botom of <U+017F>ilk; and then are they di<U+017F>pos'd into earthen pots to be kept warm, and are nouri<U+017F>h'd with noi<U+017F>e, till they are renew'd again, and re-a<U+017F><U+017F>ume their wings, as they were before they had done their work.

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXVII. Why Ice being harder than Water is yet lighter.</head>
            <p>IN this Que<U+017F>tion, there are <U+017F>everal others comprehended; the fir<U+017F>t, Why Ice is harder than Water; the <U+017F>econd, Why it is lighter, ina<U+017F>much as lightne<U+017F>s is an in<U+017F>eparable accident of <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, as this latter is an in<U+017F>eparable accident of lightne<U+017F>s. On the contrary, den<U+017F>ity, hardne<U+017F>s, and compaction is a <U+017F>ign, or rather a cau<U+017F>e of weightine<U+017F>s, as it is ob<U+017F>ervable in Meal, A<U+017F>hes, and other Bodies of the like Nature, which weigh heavier, when they are clo<U+017F>e thru<U+017F>t together in the Bu<U+017F>hel. Nay further, this Que<U+017F>tion comprehends in it <U+017F>elf the Efficient Cau<U+017F>es of Ice, which is the coldne<U+017F>s of the Earth, the Water, or the Air. It is not the fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e, if it were, Rivers and Lakes would be frozen at the botom, which, on the contrary, is mo<U+017F>t tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and <U+017F>erves for a retreat to the Fi<U+017F>h, while the <U+017F>urface of the Water is frozen up, which freezing if it be <U+017F>o violent as to reach the Center, it is communicated by degrees from the <U+017F>urface. Now that Rivers begin to freez on the <U+017F>ides, does proceed hence, that the Water there moves more <U+017F>lowly; the channel, or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Water, which is rougher in the mid<U+017F>t, being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the inequality of its cour<U+017F>e. For motion prevents congelation; not upon the account that it warms, ina<U+017F>much as that effect happens not to it, otherwi<U+017F>e then by the colli<U+017F>ion of two or more <U+017F>olid bodies, but becau<U+017F>e there is no change made, but upon <U+017F>ome <U+017F>olid foundation, which cannot be imagin'd in Water, as long as it is in motion. Nor is the Water congeal'd by that Cold, which is Nature to it <U+017F>elf; for that which is in Caves and places under ground, where it continues in its own nature, is not frozen. Nor yet that which lies expos'd to the influence of a cold air, e<U+017F>pecially when it may ea<U+017F>ily in<U+017F>inuate it <U+017F>elf into it. Whence it comes, that to cau<U+017F>e water to freeze

in a <U+017F>hort time, it mu<U+017F>t be warm'd before it be expos'd to the Air, which, finding its pores open by the heat, <U+017F>o much the more <U+017F>peedily in<U+017F>inuates it <U+017F>elf into it. For as to what is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by <U+017F>ome Phy<U+017F>icians, to wit, that the Air is hot and moi<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eems to have been advanc'd by them, rather to make a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pondence of the four po<U+017F><U+017F>ible combinations of qualities to <U+017F>o many Elements, than for any convictive rea<U+017F>on; <U+017F>ince the Air is never hot if it be not warm'd by <U+017F>ome other heat then it hath in it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>uch as is that of Fire or the Sun-beams, and the<U+017F>e too mu<U+017F>t be reflected by the Earth. On the contrary, when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in its own nature, as it does in the night-time, during the ab<U+017F>ence of the Sun, it is actually cold: nay, even in the greate<U+017F>t heats of Summer, it keeps its coolne<U+017F>s, provided there be no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication made to a hot body, as may be <U+017F>een in our Ladie's Fanns, who forcing away the Air from their hot faces, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre<U+017F>h'd by its coolne<U+017F>s, which then cannot proceed from any other principle than the proper nature of Air, ina<U+017F>much as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be more likely to imprint heat on them, then cold. And this is further confirm'd by the Air we breathe, the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation whereof cools our Lungs, whereas it <U+017F>hould warm them, if it were hot, as the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> would have it. It happens therefore that the Air, for that rea<U+017F>on call'd by <U+017F>ome Philo<U+017F>ophers <hi>primum frigidum,</hi> the fir<U+017F>t cold, in<U+017F>inuating it <U+017F>elf into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, produces therein the effect which <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> attributes to it, to wit, that of congregating all things as well of the <U+017F>ame as of <U+017F>everal kinds. And whereas our common water, what <U+017F>implici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <U+017F>oever there may be in it, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of all the Elements, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Earth and Air, the Air joyning it <U+017F>elf to what it meets withal of its own Nature, does in the fir<U+017F>t place render that cold; and being by that means united to the other parts, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Earth unperceivably intermixt with the Water, and to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it <U+017F>elf, contracts and compre<U+017F><U+017F>es them <U+017F>o as that they take up le<U+017F>s <U+017F>pace then they did before; as may be <U+017F>een in a Bottle fill'd with water, and frozen up, which though it had been full, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s found to contain air in its upper part. And yet this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion cannot be <U+017F>o well made, but that there remain <U+017F>everal particles of Air enclos'd in the Spaces of the Ice, which, were it not for that air, would be vacuous; and this, by rea<U+017F>on the <U+017F>urface, as was <U+017F>aid before, freezing up fir<U+017F>t, it from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward hinders from making their way out, tho<U+017F>e parts of air, which either were got in before, or caus'd by the avoiding of vacuity, when the Center and other parts of the Water are forc'd by the Cold to take up le<U+017F>s place then they did before. We conclude therefore, and <U+017F>ay, that though the Ice be den<U+017F>e and hard, by rea<U+017F>on of that compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of all its parts, yet is lighter than Water, becau<U+017F>e there is air enclos'd within it, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not return to its <U+017F>phere, as that does which gets into the Water, which by rea<U+017F>on of its liquidity makes way for it. So that it is no more to be wondred at, why Ice is lighter than Water, then
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:66371:215"/>
that cork, being harder, is lighter than the <U+017F>ame water. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e, had the Ice no Air inclos'd within it, as it happens to that engendred in Mines, which in proce<U+017F>s of time comes to be Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tall, it would fall to the bottom of the water as the other does. The <U+017F>ame thing may be in<U+017F>tanc'd in porous wood, which <U+017F>wims upon the water; whereas Ebony, by rea<U+017F>on of its <U+017F>olidity and want of pores, will <U+017F>ink.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That whether the Air be granted to be light, or not, or that it pa<U+017F>s only for a body le<U+017F>s weighty than the water, as this latter is le<U+017F>s heavy than the earth, certain it is, that the intermixt Air, not that comprehended within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities, but that diffus'd through the lea<U+017F>t parts of the Ice, is that which makes it lighter; ina<U+017F>much as it augments its <U+017F>innuo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as may be ob<U+017F>erv'd in a bottle fill'd with water, which breaks when the water is congeal'd, in regard that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Ice, the bottle cannot contain it. So that, as Snow is lighter than Hail, <U+017F>o this latter is lighter than Ice; and this la<U+017F>t is lighter than water, in regard it contains le<U+017F>s matter in an equal <U+017F>pace: Accordingly, it is the Air that freezes the water, yet dos it not follow thence, that it <U+017F>hould be the <hi>primum frigidum</hi>; as the Iron which is red hot burnes more vehemently than the elementary fire, yet is not that red hot Iron the <hi>primum calidum</hi>; that di<U+017F>tinction proceeding from the difference of matter, which as it mu<U+017F>t be the more compact in order to a greater burning; <U+017F>o the cold, for its better in<U+017F>inuation into all the parts of the water, requires the conveyance of the Air. As to the lightne<U+017F>s of Ice, it <U+017F>eems to be the more <U+017F>trange upon this con<U+017F>ideration, that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians explicate lightne<U+017F>s by heat, as they do heavine<U+017F>s by cold. But the fiery vapors which are in the water, as may be <U+017F>aid of that which hath been warm'd, contribute very much to that lightne<U+017F>s, it being not incompatible that the<U+017F>e contrary qualities <U+017F>hould be lodg'd in the <U+017F>ame Subject, con<U+017F>idering the inequality of the one in re<U+017F>pect of the other; and it is not to be thought a thing more <U+017F>trange, that there <U+017F>hould be potentially hot Exhalations in the water, than that the <hi>Nile</hi> <U+017F>hould abound in Nitre, which is of an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous nature. Now from what matter <U+017F>oever the cold proceeds, 'tis evident by its action that it is not a privation of heat, as <U+017F>ome Philo<U+017F>ophers would have maintain'd; <U+017F>ince that which is not, as privation, cannot have any effect. But tho<U+017F>e who have referr'd freezing as well as thawing to the Con<U+017F>tellations, <U+017F>eem to have come near the mark, in as much as tho<U+017F>e making certain impre<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Air, which <U+017F>erves for a mean, to unite the Influences of the cele<U+017F>tial bodies to the inferior, diver<U+017F>ly affect them, one while contracting, another, dilating them, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ity of matter; there being <U+017F>ome not <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of congelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Spirit of Wine and Quinte<U+017F><U+017F>ences, either upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their heat or <U+017F>implicity.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That if the fir<U+017F>t qualities of cold and heat were the Cau<U+017F>es of freezing and thawing, they would always
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:66371:215"/>
happen accordingly; the former, when it is mo<U+017F>t cold; and the other, when the cold dimini<U+017F>hes. Now many times we find the contrary, there being <U+017F>ome dayes without any fro<U+017F>t, on which thaws, we are more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of cold; and <U+017F>ometimes we perceive it yet without any perceivable remi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the cold. Whence we may well take occa<U+017F>ion to attribute both to the Influences, which, coming to meet with, and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly to introduce al<U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water the conditions requi<U+017F>ite, <U+017F>uch as is cold in re<U+017F>pect of ice, do in<U+017F>inuate them<U+017F>elves into the water. And whereas there is in the<U+017F>e Influences <U+017F>omewhat of a cele<U+017F>tial nature, and that they are rather <U+017F>piritual than material Quinte<U+017F><U+017F>ences, the <U+017F>ame thing happens to them as to Spirits, which make tho<U+017F>e Bodies which they animate, lighter, than they would be if they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXVIII. Of Masks, and whether it be lawful for any to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves.</head>
            <p>THat the wearing of Ma<U+017F>ks, and other ways for people to di<U+017F>guize them<U+017F>elves, is of great Antiquity, is apparent by the prohibition which God made to his own people, that the man <U+017F>hould not put on the habit of the woman, which is a di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e commonly made with the Ma<U+017F>k, in regard that otherwi<U+017F>e the hair and beard of the man would di<U+017F>cover his Sex. So that the Que<U+017F>tion <U+017F>eems to be already decided, and that it follows from this prohibition, that Ma<U+017F>ks are not to be allowed. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we may enquire, What repute they were in among other Nations. And we find, that they were frequently us'd among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who, about the beginning of the Spring, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated a Fea<U+017F>t in Honor of the Mother of the gods; in the pomp of which <U+017F>olemnity, it was lawful for any one to ma<U+017F>k and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf, and to repre<U+017F>ent what per<U+017F>on or part he pleas'd, which was done bluntly enough, as the <hi>French</hi> Comedians were heretofore content to have only a certain powder or meal ca<U+017F>t over their faces, as they <U+017F>till have in the Farce. To <U+017F>hew the viciou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of that po<U+017F>ture, we need only urge the indecency of it, and alledge that the u<U+017F>e of it ought not to be allow'd, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that all Di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation and Hypocri<U+017F>ie is a great <U+017F>in in the <U+017F>ight of God and men: Now the Ma<U+017F>k is <U+017F>o hypocritical, that the very word it <U+017F>elf is commonly taken for Hypocri<U+017F>ie. Thence it comes that <hi>Seneca,</hi> defining the ma<U+017F>ked or hypocritical per<U+017F>on, gives him this Character, <hi>Cum prae <U+017F>e fert aliquis quod non e<U+017F>t,</hi> When any one would <U+017F>eem, or appear to be what he is not. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides, if Painting be forbidden, and be accounted a capricious humour <U+017F>o prejudicial to decency and good manners, that there
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:66371:216"/>
is no Maid nor Woman, but thinks it an injury to be reproach'd with painting her <U+017F>elf, what opinion ought we to conceive of tho<U+017F>e who di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves? For it is imagin'd done out of no other end than to cloak their lewd actions, who make u<U+017F>e of it; as we frequently find in the informations for Murthers and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, that they are committed by di<U+017F>guis'd per<U+017F>ons, who thereby would prevent the di<U+017F>covery of their crimes. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the u<U+017F>e of the Ma<U+017F>k be utterly di<U+017F>carded, as a thing which is contrary to that uprightne<U+017F>s of di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, the <U+017F>igns whereof are mode<U+017F>ty and <U+017F>hamefa<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s, and by a prevention of blu<U+017F>hing, u<U+017F>hers in impudence, abu<U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s, and a contempt and fal<U+017F>ifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Image imprinted on the face of man.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That in times of War, the Hor<U+017F>emen, who are commanded out again<U+017F>t the Enemy, having clo<U+017F>e head-pieces over their faces, <U+017F>eem to be <U+017F>o ma<U+017F>k'd and di<U+017F>guis'd that they are not to be known; not <U+017F>o much to prevent their being wounded in the face, as to elude their Enemies, <U+017F>o as that they may not di<U+017F>cover the Commanders and per<U+017F>ons of quality, upon who<U+017F>e <U+017F>afety the gaining or lo<U+017F>s of a battel depends. And this Di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation hath <U+017F>ometimes been practis'd with great advantage, when <U+017F>ome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Souldier hath put on the armour, and rid the hor<U+017F>e of the General of the Army, <U+017F>o to draw the Enemies Forces from that <U+017F>ide, while they unexpectedly charge him on the other. And whereas he is commonly the Ma<U+017F>ter of his de<U+017F>ires, who can di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the coun<U+017F>els of his Enemy, and tho<U+017F>e cannot be known otherwi<U+017F>e than by Spies, who would never be admitted either into Cities or the Enemy's Camp, if they did not in their habit and demeanour imitate him; what Que<U+017F>tion is to be made, but that it is lawful to put on di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es upon <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>ign, to get the more certain intelligence? To divert from Military Affairs to Merchandize, it is the <U+017F>afe<U+017F>t way for him who would travel to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emble his condition; and whereas Poverty is that which is lea<U+017F>t of any expo<U+017F>'d to dangers, unle<U+017F>s a man will follow the example of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ly<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi> who counterfeited him<U+017F>elf a Beggar or Pedlar, of which profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion all are not equally capable, it will not mi<U+017F>be<U+017F>eem a great Lord to demean him<U+017F>elf as an ordinary Gentleman, and <U+017F>ometimes to avoid <U+017F>urprizes, to act the part of his Servant, while the Servant acts that of a Prince. Let us divert thence, and make our appearance before the Courts of Ju<U+017F>tice; and we <U+017F>hall there find, that Attorneys and Lawyers, when they <U+017F>peak, are ever ma<U+017F>k'd &amp; di<U+017F>guis'd in laying open the Cau<U+017F>es of their Clients, who on their <U+017F>ide are al<U+017F>o apt enough to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble &amp; conceal whatever they think might prejudice them. So that the Painters had much more rea<U+017F>on to repre<U+017F>ent the Lawyers, Attorneys, and their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, with a veil over their Eyes, then Ju<U+017F>tice; <U+017F>ince that among them, he hath the reputation of the brave<U+017F>t man, who is the greate<U+017F>t Orator, and hath the be<U+017F>t Lungs; and according to their <U+017F>aying, who have be<U+017F>t defin'd the Art of Oratory; It is the Art of per<U+017F>wading people to what they plea<U+017F>e, by making great things

little, and little things great, which, in other Language, is for a man to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e all things, and him<U+017F>elf into the bargain, ina<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he <U+017F>eems to believe the contrary to what he <U+017F>ayes and knows, and that among the rules of Oratory, this is one, that the Orator is to per<U+017F>onate even to his voice and ge<U+017F>ture, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate him<U+017F>elf to what he <U+017F>ayes, which is properly to ma<U+017F>k him<U+017F>elf, and that not only the face, but al<U+017F>o the feet, the hands, the tongue, and all tho<U+017F>e parts of the body which are employ'd in pronunciation, elocution, and the ge<U+017F>tures <U+017F>uitable to the thing treated of. Nor is it to be expected that Divines and Phy<U+017F>icians are ab<U+017F>olutely exempted from the<U+017F>e kinds of di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es, <U+017F>ince that, the better to in<U+017F>inuate into the affections of their Penitents and Patients, which is the way to gain their hearts, and by that means to Convert and Cure them, they ought to be very complai<U+017F>ant towards them, comply with their infirmities, and accommodate them<U+017F>elves to their humors in all things indifferent, that they, on the other <U+017F>ide, may <U+017F>ubmit to their advice in tho<U+017F>e things which are nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. And not to de<U+017F>cend to particular In<U+017F>tances which might be made in all other Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions, this will be the re<U+017F>ult, that tho<U+017F>e who will find fault with Ma<U+017F>ks and Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es, mu<U+017F>t, with the <U+017F>ame breath, ca<U+017F>t an a<U+017F>per<U+017F>ion on all humane <U+017F>ociety, which, as <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> <U+017F>aid at his departure out of this world, is nothing but a Comedy, wherein every one acts his part under a di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e.

            <p>OF all the flowers of Rhetorick, lying is one of the wor<U+017F>t, and withal <U+017F>o much the more pernicious, the more full it is of artifice. For if the <U+017F>aying of <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> be true, That the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar always de<U+017F>erves to be blamed, there is a certain re<U+017F>emblance between him who <U+017F>imply tells a lie, and him who <U+017F>imply takes away another man's life by poy<U+017F>on; ina<U+017F>much as the latter infects the Heart, and the former viciates and corrupts the <U+017F>ource of our Ratiocination; the end whereof is only to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Truth. As therefore the poy<U+017F>oning of a man is always a heinous and puni<U+017F>hable crime; but that Steward who <U+017F>hould poy<U+017F>on his Ma<U+017F>ter, when he gave <U+017F>omewhat to eat or drink, when the other pretended to be exteamly hungry or dry, would be the greate<U+017F>t villany in the world, and de<U+017F>erve a far greater pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>hment: So he who <U+017F>imply tells a lie is not <U+017F>o much to be blamed, as he who covers and di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es his lie under the appearance of <U+017F>ome probable hi<U+017F>tory, which is clearly receiv'd by our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding; and this thus drawn in by the liklyhood of the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, grows le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful of it, than of the other kinds of fal<U+017F>hood, which are deliver'd without any artifice. So that lying, and con<U+017F>equently Fables, and all the <U+017F>pecies thereof, have the <U+017F>ame proportion to our Under<U+017F>tanding, as Mon<U+017F>ters have to Nature; our Under<U+017F>tanding cannot endure them, whereas Truth is its <U+017F>u<U+017F>tenance.

Whence it comes that <U+017F>ome eminent per<U+017F>ons do account it a great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ight in the education of Children, to entertain them with Tales and Stories: in<U+017F>tead whereof, tho<U+017F>e weak minds, wherein, as in <U+017F>oft wax, a man may ea<U+017F>ily imprint what he plea<U+017F>es, <U+017F>hould rather be acquainted with Hi<U+017F>tory, which, by rea<U+017F>on of its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and truth, would be equally delightful, but much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous.

This latter is recover'd by feeding on <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>h excellently well-order'd, <U+017F>uch as by its haut-gou<U+017F>ts, and picquancy will rather excite, then <U+017F>atisfie the Appetite. Such is the bitterne<U+017F>s of the Olive, Vinegar in Sallets, and the like; which have the <U+017F>ame effect as the <U+017F>tepping back of <U+017F>uch as leap, or the appearance of a Fly on a face of an exqui<U+017F>itely fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. The<U+017F>e Fables are invented to reduce the wandring and wearied Under<U+017F>tanding to its former interrupted pur<U+017F>uance of Truth. There are two kinds of them: One may be called a <U+017F>imple <hi>Fiction,</hi> <U+017F>uch as are old Wives Tales, which de<U+017F>erve not the name of fabulous Relations, unle<U+017F>s it be upon the account of their ab<U+017F>urdity; and yet it ought to be <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on'd with <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is miraculous and delightful. The other is <hi>Mythologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> which may be divided into four kinds. Fir<U+017F>t, the <hi>Poëtical,</hi> in one continu'd Relation, <U+017F>uch as are the Metamorpho<U+017F>es of <hi>Ovid</hi>; or Drammatick, and accommodated to Per<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>uch as as are Comedies and Tragedies. Secondly, the <hi>Emblem,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> which is a real explication of <U+017F>ome feigned thing, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or otherwi<U+017F>e repre<U+017F>ented. Thirdly, the <hi>Apologue,</hi> <U+017F>uch as are the Fables of <hi>Ae<U+017F>op</hi>; and the<U+017F>e are divided into three <U+017F>orts,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:66371:219"/>
the <hi>Moral,</hi> the <hi>Rational,</hi> and the <hi>Mixt.</hi> The <hi>Moral,</hi> are tho<U+017F>e, wherein irrational things are introduc'd, <U+017F>uch as is the Fable of the two Pots, the earthen and the brazen; or that of the di<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the prey between the Lyon, the A<U+017F>s, and the Fox. The <hi>Rational</hi> are only of Men, <U+017F>uch as is that of the Satyr and his Entertainer, whom he leaves, becau<U+017F>e he blew hot and cold out of the <U+017F>ame mouth. Of the <hi>Mixt,</hi> we have an example in the Fable of the Fowler, and the Stork, taken in the net with the Cranes. The fourth kind is the <hi>Romance:</hi> The benefit and advantage of all which kinds of Fable is notorious to all: For be<U+017F>ides that they comprehend that common recreation, which is oppo<U+017F>ite to the conflict of Mind, and <U+017F>erious occupation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the reading of Hi<U+017F>tories, the Poetical kind of Fable, I mean that of the continu'd Relation, where the Poet <U+017F>peaks alone, does make extraordinary di<U+017F>coveries of the old Pagan Antiquities, whereof a man cannot be ignorant without a great defect. The Dramatick, where Per<U+017F>ons are introduc'd <U+017F>peaking, when it is repre<U+017F>ented by good Actors, makes a prevalent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion on the minds of the Spectators and Auditors, and hath nothing comparable to the other kinds of writing and expre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing: <U+017F>o that it is the mo<U+017F>t efficacious in<U+017F>trument to move and work upon the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. There may al<U+017F>o be very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages made of the other fore-mentioned kinds of Fable, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Romance, which hath the <U+017F>ame effect on our minds, in order to their in<U+017F>truction in goodne<U+017F>s and vertue, as well-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd Pictures have to teach us the art of Drawing. For, as there are not to be <U+017F>een now any Pictures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, in point of body, to that of the <U+017F>o much celebrated <hi>Venus,</hi> which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted of whatever was hand<U+017F>om in any Woman or Maid, and borrow'd the hair of one, the complexion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the neck of a third, and the brea<U+017F>t and other members of others; <U+017F>o is it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that Hi<U+017F>tory <U+017F>hould ever come up to the noble height and delight of the Romance. For, Hi<U+017F>tory, though it be not ab<U+017F>olutely true, yet being oblig'd to repre<U+017F>ent things pa<U+017F>t with as much likene<U+017F>s as a picture is taken according to the face of him who is to be drawn, the con<U+017F>equence of that obligation is, that however it may embelli<U+017F>h things and actions, yet is it <U+017F>till engag'd to expo<U+017F>e them to the eye of the Reader as they are, or at lea<U+017F>t as they are conceiv'd to be. Now the number of unju<U+017F>t things much exceeds that of the ju<U+017F>t, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently the bad and <U+017F>ad examples will much <U+017F>horten the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's delight. Whence it follows, that Hi<U+017F>tory wants tho<U+017F>e two principal ends, for which it ought to be <U+017F>ought after, to wit, content and advantage: whereas the Romance brings both along with it, as being commonly full of the rewards obtain'd by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, whereof one is, that a <U+017F>incere and con<U+017F>tant Love <U+017F>hould at la<U+017F>t be crown'd with the greate<U+017F>t of worldly enjoyments; and on the contrary, there are not wanting the puni<U+017F>hments and executions of lewd and vicious per<U+017F>ons; whereto add the <U+017F>trange
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:66371:220"/>
variety of the accidents, repre<U+017F>ented therein, which being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with nobler and more unexpected intrigues, extreamly heighten the <U+017F>atisfaction of the Reader.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That for any man to endeavour the di<U+017F>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Truth by its contrary, to wit, Fables, is to look for light in the mid<U+017F>t of darkne<U+017F>s; and as a certain Mu<U+017F>ician among the Ancients demanded a double reward, for teaching tho<U+017F>e who had been in<U+017F>tructed ami<U+017F>s in that Art, for this rea<U+017F>on, as he <U+017F>aid, that there was a certain time requi<U+017F>ite for the forgetting of what they already knew, and as much for learning how to play well: <U+017F>o that Child, who <U+017F>hall have heard of the univer<U+017F>al Deluge by the Fable of <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> will find more difficulty to di<U+017F>engage his mind of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>tones, which, they having ca<U+017F>t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, became men and women, then he will have to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in it the natural Story of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Ark. The <U+017F>ame thing may be <U+017F>aid of all the other Fables, out of which there is any truth to be deriv'd, to wit, that it is like the ordering of Crabs, where there is much more to be picked away, then there is to be eaten. Nay the <hi>Romans</hi> them<U+017F>elves, who <U+017F>eem to be more in<U+017F>tructive, may be reproach'd with this, that they have not repre<U+017F>ented to their Readers, the State of life and civil Conver<U+017F>ation, as it really is, but have entertain'd them with a <hi>Platonical</hi> Commonwealth. And that di<U+017F>courages men very much, when they find the cour<U+017F>e and cu<U+017F>toms of the World to be contrary to what they had taken <U+017F>o much pains to read: Whereas the young man will be the le<U+017F>s <U+017F>tartled to find him<U+017F>elf hi<U+017F>s'd by his Auditors, when he <U+017F>peaks well; and <U+017F>lighted by Fortune, when he does well; while the ignorant and the wicked are her greate<U+017F>t Favourites, after he hath read in Hi<U+017F>tory of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Per<U+017F>ons of worth <U+017F>o treated; than he would be, if he thru<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf into affairs, having never <U+017F>een any thing but examples of Vice puni<U+017F>h'd, and Vertue rewarded.</p>

They therefore are to be thought the happie<U+017F>t, who, if they had their own wills, would go to bed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t; not only for that rea<U+017F>on which made a certain King of this part of the World <U+017F>ay, That he would be King as long as he could, ina<U+017F>much as when he <U+017F>lept, there was no difference between him &amp; the meane<U+017F>t of his Subjects: but al<U+017F>o for this, that night <U+017F>urprizing them before they had done all their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, the Supper or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation mu<U+017F>t be the later, and con<U+017F>equently the going to bed. The <U+017F>econd rea<U+017F>on is deduc'd hence, that there ought to be a corre<U+017F>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between the tranquillity of the mind and that of the body. It being therefore nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that he who would take a good <U+017F>leep <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>ubject to any di<U+017F>turbance of mind, &amp; that indi<U+017F>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancy being procured only by that order which every one hath taken in his affairs, it is to be imagin'd, that the later a man goes to bed, the more bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s he hath di<U+017F>patch'd, and con<U+017F>equently there remains the le<U+017F>s to be done. Upon this <U+017F>core is it, that Merchant's Suppers are accounted the mo<U+017F>t quiet, for having <U+017F>pent the whole day in trudging up and down about their Trade, they then enjoy them<U+017F>elves with greater <U+017F>erenity. In the third place, a man <U+017F>hould not go to bed, till dige<U+017F>tion be pretty well advanc'd; from the want or <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s whereof, hideous Dreams, Crudities, Vento<U+017F>ities, nay <U+017F>ometimes Apoplexies, do proceed. Now this dige<U+017F>tion is <U+017F>o much the more advanc'd, the later a man goes to bed: which difference will be be<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erv'd by tho<U+017F>e, who go ju<U+017F>t from the Table to their beds, and lie down as <U+017F>oon as the meat is out of their mouths. Fourthly, that Cu<U+017F>tom is ever the be<U+017F>t, from which it is in a man's power mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ily to wean him<U+017F>elf, and in the change whereof he will be <U+017F>ubject to lea<U+017F>t inconvenience. Now he who hath contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a habit of going to bed late, will find it a le<U+017F>s inconvenience to go to bed betimes, that <U+017F>o he may ri<U+017F>e betimes, or upon <U+017F>ome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motive, then he <U+017F>hall, who hath accu<U+017F>tomed him<U+017F>elf to go to bed betimes, for he will be <U+017F>leepy, and unfit for the doing of any thing, as <U+017F>oon as his bed-time is come. Fifthly, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> would not have a man en<U+017F>lave him<U+017F>elf to an over-<U+017F>trict cour<U+017F>e of life, grounding his advice on this, that <U+017F>uch regular per<U+017F>ons find it the greater difficulty to <U+017F>upport the mi<U+017F>carriages which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cannot be avoided in the ordinary cour<U+017F>e of life; as tho<U+017F>e who walk upon ropes are more apt to fall, at lea<U+017F>t find it a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der matter to keep on, then tho<U+017F>e who walk on the plain ground. Now tho<U+017F>e who go to bed betimes are commonly more regular in the hours of Supper, and all the other actions of the day, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the exact ob<U+017F>ervance whereof that of their bed-time does
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:66371:221"/>
depend. Now it is obvious to any one, who <U+017F>hall con<U+017F>ider the difference of profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions, that there are but few that leave a man at liberty to ob<U+017F>erve <U+017F>o exact a rule as this is. So that being <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times nece<U+017F><U+017F>itated to make a breach of it, the con<U+017F>equence will be, that tho<U+017F>e who have the more <U+017F>trictly engag'd them<U+017F>elves to the ob<U+017F>ervance of the rule of going to bed betimes, mu<U+017F>t needs receive a far greater inconvenience from the neglect of it, than they ordinarily do who go to bed late. Sixthly, the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on that obliges phlegmatick per<U+017F>ons, and <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>ubject to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs, to content them<U+017F>elves with little <U+017F>leep, which is this; that their humidity, joyn'd with that of <U+017F>leep it <U+017F>elf, augments their di<U+017F>temper; be<U+017F>ides, that Sleeping which moi<U+017F>tens and cools, is not <U+017F>o well procur'd in that part of the day which is mo<U+017F>t cold and moi<U+017F>t, that is, from nine at Night till three in the Morning, but rather towards the Morning, at which time the Blood begins to be predominant, ina<U+017F>much as in <U+017F>o doing he abates <U+017F>omewhat of its Heat, and being to dilate it <U+017F>elf till ten in the Morning, at which time Choler begins to be predominant, moderates its acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; as all tho<U+017F>e will acknowledge, which Sex <U+017F>oever they be of, who are <U+017F>ubject to the Megrim, who find very great ea<U+017F>e by that Morning <U+017F>leep, which accordingly is found to be the mo<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; and hath this further advantage attributed to it, that the Dreams thereof are prophetical, and will come to pa<U+017F>s in a <U+017F>hort time; whereas the others are accounted <U+017F>uperfluous by tho<U+017F>e who have been Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors in that Art. Moreover, tho<U+017F>e who ri<U+017F>e too early in Morning are <U+017F>ubject to the Headach in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and more ea<U+017F>ily tran<U+017F>ported with Anger all the re<U+017F>t of the day; to effect which, the con<U+017F>ideration of the Temperament does very much conduce. For, as <U+017F>leeping in the day time is born with in Old Men and Children, and that in both, by rea<U+017F>on of their weakne<U+017F>s, and for the recruit of their Spirits, and, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in Old Men, to take off <U+017F>omewhat of the acrimony of that <U+017F>erous phlegm which is predominant in them; <U+017F>o, the greater part of Men being <U+017F>ubject to Choler, (whence haply proceeded the error of <U+017F>ome Phy<U+017F>icians, who talk of nothing but refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es) and the coolne<U+017F>s and moi<U+017F>ture of the Night correcting that hot and dry di<U+017F>temper, it is the more convenient, that Sleep <U+017F>hould do as much in the Day time, by taking off then <U+017F>omewhat of their Choler.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the retrival and re<U+017F>tauration of the Spirits obliges the Animal to <U+017F>leep, which ought to continue at lea<U+017F>t for <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>pace of time as amounts to the third part of that a man hath been waking, and <U+017F>hould never exceed the one half of it. Far is it therefore from being imaginable, that Nature <U+017F>hould be able to endure what is affirmed of the <U+017F>even Sleepers, or the long nap of <hi>Epimenides,</hi> which la<U+017F>ted fifty years. Nor are we to give any more credit to what is related to us concerning a Plant in the Low-Countries, which will keep people waking ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nights and dayes together, without any inconvenience; but the time when we <U+017F>hould begin or end our <U+017F>leep, being left to
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:66371:221"/>
our own di<U+017F>cretion, 'tis requi<U+017F>ite we <U+017F>hould accommodate our <U+017F>elves to the order pre<U+017F>crib'd by Nature, which hath appointed the day to labour, and the night to re<U+017F>t in: Nay, it is al<U+017F>o the advice of <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and all Phy<U+017F>icians, who think it not enough to direct re<U+017F>t in the night, and waking in the day, but al<U+017F>o conceive very great hopes of tho<U+017F>e, who, in the time of their <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, are <U+017F>o irregular therein. Add to this, that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ilence, and the coldne<U+017F>s of the night being fit to recruit the Spirits, and promote their retirement within; whereas light, noi<U+017F>e, and the heat of the day, are more proper to occa<U+017F>ion their egre<U+017F>s for the exerci<U+017F>e of actions; which granted, he who ob<U+017F>erves not this rule charges Nature with an erronious proceeding. And that this is her way, is apparent hence, that tho<U+017F>e Animals which are guided only by her motion, (which is as certain as our rea<U+017F>on is ordinarily irregular) go that way to work. Cocks and other Birds go to their re<U+017F>t, and awake with the Sun; if any of our Dome<U+017F>tick Creatures do otherwi<U+017F>e, our irregularity is the cau<U+017F>e thereof and that perver<U+017F>ion is of no le<U+017F>s dangerous con<U+017F>equence than that of the Sea<U+017F>ons, which is ever attended by di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. And who makes any doubt but that the greate<U+017F>t perfection of the Heavens con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in their regular motion, the principal cau<U+017F>e of their duration? Which order <U+017F>ince we are not able to imitate, it is but requi<U+017F>ite we <U+017F>hould come as near it as we can in our actions, among which <U+017F>leeping and waking, being the hindges on which all the others of our life do hang, if there be any irregularity in the<U+017F>e, confu<U+017F>ion and di<U+017F>order mu<U+017F>t needs be expected in all the re<U+017F>t, as may be <U+017F>een in the lives of Courtiers of both Sexes, who turn night to day, and day to night, a cour<U+017F>e of life much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which is ob<U+017F>erv'd by the Superiours and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of regulated companies. Be<U+017F>ides, it is the Morning that not only holds a <U+017F>tricter corre<U+017F>pondence with the Mu<U+017F>es, but is al<U+017F>o the fitte<U+017F>t time for the performance of all the functions of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind. Then is it that Phy<U+017F>icians pre<U+017F>cribe exerci<U+017F>es, in regard that the Body being clear'd of the Excrements of the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd concoction, is wholly di<U+017F>pos'd for the di<U+017F>tribution of Aliment, and evacuation of the Excrements of the third. So that he who <U+017F>pends that part of the day about his affairs, be<U+017F>ides the expedition he meets with, does by that means maintain the vigour of his Body and Mind, which is commonly dull'd by <U+017F>leeping in the day time, which fills the Head with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and when exerci<U+017F>e comes to <U+017F>ucceed it in the warme<U+017F>t part of the day, the heat which is then commonly greate<U+017F>t makes it le<U+017F>s <U+017F>upportable. Therefore Nature, who is a <U+017F>ure guide, inclines us to <U+017F>leepine<U+017F>s in the Evening, there being not any thing but the multiplicity and di<U+017F>traction of Civil Affairs, which, depriving us of that Function, as it does of divers others, makes the Life of Man <U+017F>o much the le<U+017F>s certain, the more he is involv'd in Affairs; whereas the duration of that of Animals, and, next to them of Country-people, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:66371:222"/>
<U+017F>uch as comply with the conduct of Nature, is commonly of a greater length and more certain.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXI. Whether the Child derives more from the Father, or the Mother.</head>
            <p>IF our Fore-fathers may be conceiv'd wi<U+017F>e enough to have known the nature of things, it is to be acknowledg'd, that the Child derives mo<U+017F>t from the Father, <U+017F>ince that they thought fit to be<U+017F>tow on him his name rather than that of the Mother; and that the name is the mark and character of the thing. Be<U+017F>ides, the Male being more perfect, larger and <U+017F>tronger than the Female, which indeed is an imperfection and default of Nature, who<U+017F>e con<U+017F>tant de<U+017F>ign it is to make a Male, and is not di<U+017F>appointed; but through want of heat, vigour, and temperament; it is but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, that what proceeded from the<U+017F>e two, <U+017F>hould have the denomination from the more perfect of them. Thus a Regiment is known by the name of the Colonel; a City, by that of its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; a Law and Ordinance by that of the Law-giver; and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, the Compo<U+017F>ition whereof con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of two <U+017F>imple medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hath mo<U+017F>t of the nature of the <U+017F>tronger, and that which is of greate<U+017F>t virtue. This is further confirm'd by the common Compari<U+017F>on, which is us'd to expre<U+017F>s the difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Mother in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of generation. For the Mother, and particularly, the Matrix, is compar'd to a field, and the paternal <U+017F>eed to the grain which is <U+017F>own in that field, which <U+017F>erves well enough in order to its <U+017F>prouting and <U+017F>hooting forth, but <U+017F>upplies it only with matter, which is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the form of the grain, from which the Plant produc'd of it receives its being. So that the pre<U+017F>ent Que<U+017F>tion amounts to no more, than if a Man <U+017F>hould a<U+017F>k, Whether an ear of Wheat deriv'd more from the ground, or from the <U+017F>eed that had been <U+017F>owne in it? A further proof hereof may be deduc'd from the in<U+017F>truments of generation, which being more apparent in the man than in the woman, are a <U+017F>ilent in<U+017F>inuation, that the former contribute more thereto than the latter. And the greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t remarkable difference that there is between the Children being that of the Sex, the experiment alledg'd by Phy<U+017F>icians, that if the right Te<U+017F>ticle be bound, Males will be produc'd, as Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males will if the contrary, clearly <U+017F>hews that by the Father's part the Sex is determinated, and con<U+017F>equently, it is from him that there do al<U+017F>o proceed the lea<U+017F>t individual differences and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tances, wherein the likene<U+017F>s or unlikene<U+017F>s of Children to their Fathers and Mothers, either in Mind or Body doth con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t.
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:66371:222"/>
For if the Males e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>hould retain more from the Mothers than they do from the Fathers, that proverbial <U+017F>aying would prove fal<U+017F>e, which affirms, that
<q>Fortes creantur fortibus—</q>
in regard that mo<U+017F>t women are chargeable with a want of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. And daily experience makes it apparent, that one of the greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t common cau<U+017F>es of Valour is deduc'd from the Fathers <U+017F>ide: Upon which principle is grounded the account we make of Nobility, which comes <U+017F>eldom but from the Father's <U+017F>ide, whereas the want of Nobility on the Mother's <U+017F>ide, does not make the Child le<U+017F>s a Gentleman. Nay <U+017F>ome have made it a Que<U+017F>tion, whether the Mother did contribute any thing to the formation of the <hi>foetus,</hi> or only found it nouri<U+017F>hment. But tho<U+017F>e who have treated more nicely of this matter unanimou<U+017F>ly agree, that the Woman's Seed is much weaker, and more wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than that of the Man, <U+017F>erving only to qualifie it, as Water does Wine, yet <U+017F>o as that the Water is converted into the nature of the Wine, and is call'd Wine as <U+017F>oon as it is mixt with it. As to tho<U+017F>e Children who chance to be more like their Mothers than their Fathers, 'tis to be conceiv'd one of Nature's fagaries, who delighting in variety cannot produce many children, but there mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equently be a great diver<U+017F>ity of Lineaments in their faces, and figures in their members; among which the idea of a Woman imprinted in the imagination of the Father may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his Seed, which con<U+017F>equently expre<U+017F><U+017F>es that figure.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, That there were three kinds of re<U+017F>emblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to wit, that of the Species, that of the Sex, and that of the Effigies, as to the Body, and that of manners, as to the Soul. or The re<U+017F>emblance of the Species is, when a Man begets a Man, a Woman proceeds from the material Principles of Generation which the Mother contributes more plentifully then the Father: the proof whereof may be <U+017F>een in the copulation of Animals of different Species. For if a Hee-goat couples with a Sheep, he <U+017F>hall beget a Sheep, which <U+017F>hall have nothing of the Goat in it, <U+017F>ave that the fleece will be a little rougher then it is wont to be. And if a Ram couples with a She-goat, the production will be a Goat, who<U+017F>e hair will be <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>ofter than otherwi<U+017F>e. But as to what is related of <hi>Ari<U+017F>to</hi>'s, having had a Daughter by an A<U+017F>s, who for that rea<U+017F>on was called <hi>Ono<U+017F>cele</hi>; of <hi>Fulvius Stelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s, having another by a Mare, who was thence called <hi>Hippona</hi>; and of a Sheep, which brought forth a Lyon<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> in the pa<U+017F>tures of <hi>Nicippus,</hi> to whom it pre<U+017F>aged Tyranny; of <hi>Alcippa,</hi> who was deliver'd of an Elephant, having been impregnated by an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, are to be look'd on as mon<U+017F>trous, and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly fabulous Productions.</p>
            <p>The re<U+017F>emblance of the Sex depends on the temperature and
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:66371:223"/>
predominancy of the Seeds. For if the <U+017F>eed of both Male and Female be very hot, Males will be engendred; if cold, Females; and both of them will be either vigorous or weak, according to the predominancy of heat or cold. Whence it follows, that this re<U+017F>emblance does not proceed more from the one then the other, of tho<U+017F>e who are joyn'd together: but the re<U+017F>emblance of Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and the other accidents of the Body, and of the manners is more hard to re<U+017F>olve, there being a <U+017F>ecret vertue in both the Seeds, which, as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> affirms, is continu'd in it to the fourth Generation, as may be confirm'd by the <U+017F>tory of <hi>Helida,</hi> who having lain with a Negro, brought forth a white Child; but her Grandchild by that was black. <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms the <U+017F>ame thing to have happen'd in the fourth Generation of a Negro. And yet this re<U+017F>emblance proceeds rather from the Mother's <U+017F>ide than the Father's; for if the cau<U+017F>es, which communicate mo<U+017F>t to their effects, imprint mo<U+017F>t of their nature into them; by that greater communication, tho<U+017F>e effects accordingly retain <U+017F>o much the more of their Cau<U+017F>es. Now the Mother communicates more to the Child then the Father does, for <U+017F>he <U+017F>upplies him with Seed, tho<U+017F>e who have maintain'd the contrary being per<U+017F>ons not much skill'd in Anatomy, and after <U+017F>he hath contributed as much as the Father to that Generation, <U+017F>he alone nouri<U+017F>hes the <hi>foetus</hi> with her men<U+017F>trual blood, which then begins not to follow any longer the cour<U+017F>e of the Moon, whereby it was regulated before. Be<U+017F>ides, coming thus to furni<U+017F>h the <U+017F>aid <hi>foetus</hi> with nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment, for the <U+017F>pace of nine Months, it is no wonder <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould ab<U+017F>olutely tranform it into her own nature, which is thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted but one and the <U+017F>ame, in re<U+017F>pect of both Mother and Child. Now there is not any thing liker, or can retain more of it then the thing it <U+017F>elf; which cannot be <U+017F>aid of the Father, who is not only different from the Embryo, whom he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but al<U+017F>o hath not any thing common with it, after that fir<U+017F>t action. So that there are many Children <hi>posthumi,</hi> and born long after the death of their Fathers, which thing never happens after the death of their Mothers; nay it is <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>een that a Child taken out of the body of a Mother ready to dy, ever thrives much afterwards. Though we <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>tick to acknowledge, that what is related of the fir<U+017F>t per<U+017F>on of the race of the <hi>Cae<U+017F>ars,</hi> from whom that Section was called the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>arean,</hi> might po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly happen, according to the Relation; yet is it done with this re<U+017F>triction, that mo<U+017F>t of the other Stories told of it, are fabulous. But if the Mother comes afterwards to <U+017F>uckle her Child, as Nature and the Example of all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals teaches her, which is haply the rea<U+017F>on of their being more vigorous, and of a continuance of life more regular than that of the man, that <U+017F>econd nouri<U+017F>hment added to the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn from her milk, which derives the quality of the ma<U+017F>s of blood, from which it is extracted, makes him ab<U+017F>olutely conformable to the Mother. For if nouri<U+017F>hment may, as we
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:66371:223"/>
find it to be true, change the Temperament of Per<U+017F>ons well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in years, with much more rea<U+017F>on may it work a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alteration in the Body and Mind of a Child newly come into the World, who is as it were a <U+017F>mooth Table <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of any impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Whence it is to be concluded, that they proceed very rationally, who are <U+017F>o careful of the well-fare of their little ones, (when the Mothers, either by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, of upon <U+017F>ome other account, are not able to bring them up) as to be very inqui<U+017F>itive about the Nur<U+017F>es they put them to, and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Milk. Nay, what is more; are not the changes caus'd by Nur<U+017F>es in the Body of the Infant as con<U+017F>iderable, as that which happens to the two <U+017F>eeds of Male and Female mixt at the Generation, which recover their increa<U+017F>e by the irroration of the Maternal Blood which flows thereto; and, if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, does communicate its impurity to it; as, on the contrary, being pure, it is many times able to purifie the corrupted <U+017F>eed of the Male. Whence Phy<U+017F>icians have ob<U+017F>erv'd, that <U+017F>ound Children have de<U+017F>cended from Fathers <U+017F>ubject to the Lepro<U+017F>ie and <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. Add to this, that the <U+017F>afety on the Mothers <U+017F>ide is greater than on the Father's. Moreover, they are the Mothers, from whom proceeds the Imagination, which acts upon their Embryo all the time they are with Child; and thence it comes, that they are much more fond of their Children than the Fathers; which fondne<U+017F>s is a <U+017F>ign that there may be more of the Mothers ob<U+017F>erv'd in the Children, than of the Fathers. For the love we have for our <U+017F>elves is <U+017F>o great, that God would have it to be the mea<U+017F>ure of that which we ought to bear unto our Neighbour; and that which we bear to God him<U+017F>elf hath <U+017F>ome reference to his affection towards us. Tho<U+017F>e therefore who would in<U+017F>inuate them<U+017F>elves into the favour of any one, have no <U+017F>urer way to do it, than by complying with his humor, and as much he can become conformable to him.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXII. Whether is harder, for a Vertuous Man to do that which is Evil; or for a Vicious to do that which is Good.</head>
            <p>BEfore we come to the Re<U+017F>olution of this Que<U+017F>tion, we are to con<U+017F>ider two things; the former, that Man con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of two parts, the Superiour, which is the Soul; and the Inferiour, which is the Body; and whereas the<U+017F>e two parts have different objects, and <U+017F>uch as which contradict one the other, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be a great Conflict; the body being <U+017F>trongly inclin'd to <U+017F>en<U+017F>uality, and the Soul endeavouring to rai<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf up to <U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things. But in regard the Organs <U+017F>he makes u<U+017F>e of are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:66371:224"/>
<U+017F>uch as are al<U+017F>o the Sen<U+017F>es, which a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t her in her operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is not to be thought <U+017F>he can overcome without great pains; ina<U+017F>much as the in<U+017F>truments which <U+017F>he <U+017F>tands in need of, for the exerci<U+017F>e of Virtue, hold a greater corre<U+017F>pondence with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and as they derive their Being from matter, <U+017F>o they betray the Re<U+017F>olutions of the Soul, reducing her under a Tyrannical Subjection. Whence it follows, that the wicked or vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on finds it the greater difficulty to do well; ina<U+017F>much as being en<U+017F>lav'd to vice and <U+017F>in, he cannot <U+017F>hake off that yoke, as having a con<U+017F>tant inclination to evil.</p>
            <p>The Second thing to be con<U+017F>ider'd, is good and evil in it <U+017F>elf; for, according to Nature, there is no evil in Humane Actions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<U+017F>much as in appearance they are all good; otherwi<U+017F>e the Will, the object whereof is that which is Good and plea<U+017F>ing, would not be inclin'd thereto, <U+017F>ince good is that which all things de<U+017F>ire. There are therefore two <U+017F>orts of good, and as many of evils, one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and the other Moral; the Soul is ea<U+017F>ily enclin'd to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good, and the Body to the Natural; and, con<U+017F>equently, it is much more ea<U+017F>ie for the Vicious per<U+017F>on to do a Moral good, than it is for the Virtuous Man to do a Moral Evil.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That it is harder for a good Man to do evil, in regard that to the virtuous man Virtue <U+017F>eems <U+017F>o fair and taking, that he finds it the greate<U+017F>t difficulty in the world to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ake her, and <U+017F>o to embrace Vice, which he looks upon as a hideous Mon<U+017F>ter, ina<U+017F>much as Beings and Sub<U+017F>tances are more amiable than Privations are odious; in regard that as Love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pects the things that are amiable, and aver<U+017F>ion is not extended to that which is not; in like manner, Vice is not <U+017F>o much <U+017F>hun'd, as Vertue is belov'd: Whence it follows, that it is a greater trouble for the good man to do that which is evil, in regard he knows the perfection of good, as much as the vicious per<U+017F>on is ignorant of it; and, from that ignorance, there mu<U+017F>t needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a difficulty and backwardne<U+017F>s of embracing it.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the vicious per<U+017F>on finds it a harder ta<U+017F>k to do well, in regard that Nature is <U+017F>trongly bent towards that which is evil; and, con<U+017F>equently, the virtuous per<U+017F>on, when he does that which is evil, ea<U+017F>ily falls down into the bottom; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the de<U+017F>cent of humane inclinations; and the vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, when he does that which is good, climes up a high Mountain full of Rocks and Precipices, and engages again<U+017F>t Nature her <U+017F>elf, being in open ho<U+017F>tility again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ual Appetite, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scripture, <hi>We do not the good which we would do, but the evil we would not do, that we do:</hi> To <U+017F>hew that the difficulties men find in the pur<U+017F>uance of good are <U+017F>o great, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> him<U+017F>elf complains of his <hi>having a Law within him which rebelled again<U+017F>t the Law of God.</hi> This Nature of ours being full of the imperfections conceiv'd in Original Sin, hath <U+017F>o great a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to good, that there was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of a Law of Grace to regenerate it, in order to the pur<U+017F>uit of good, a complyance
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:66371:224"/>
with the true <U+017F>entiments of Religion, and the knowledge of God; not to urge, that Plea<U+017F>ure hath <U+017F>o great attractions and charms, that it is almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to over-ma<U+017F>ter them. Thence it came that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> order'd him<U+017F>elf to be bound to the ma<U+017F>t of his Ship, and caus'd his ears to be <U+017F>topp'd, that he might not hear the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious voices of the Syrens; otherwi<U+017F>e his Rea<U+017F>on would not have been <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong as to over-ma<U+017F>ter his <U+017F>en<U+017F>ual Appetites, which mu<U+017F>t be either de<U+017F>troy'd, or <U+017F>o fetter'd, that the Soul may not be drawn away by pernicious temptations.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That Virtue was natural to Man before <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and, from the time of his rebellion again<U+017F>t God, Vice hath <U+017F>eated it <U+017F>elf in her place; <U+017F>o that when Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for<U+017F>ook our fir<U+017F>t Parent, all vices and imperfections po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd them<U+017F>elves of his Mind, and are become <U+017F>o naturaliz'd there, that it begat a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing Divine and Humane Laws: whereof <U+017F>ome were for the eradication of Vices; others, for the puni<U+017F>hment of Crimes; all which trouble might have been <U+017F>par'd, if there had not been <U+017F>o much difficulty in the doing of that which is good.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That it being <U+017F>uppos'd, (as indeed it is true) that Humane Nature is more inclin'd to Vice than to Virtue for the rea<U+017F>ons before alledg'd, yet is there a certain means to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate and de<U+017F>troy that Inclination, and advance the Soul to a <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty over the Body, by aboli<U+017F>hing and de<U+017F>troying the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, and tho<U+017F>e intellectual powers whereby the Organs are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd. For if the Body have the Ma<U+017F>ter<U+017F>hip, the Soul will be forc'd to obey; but if the Soul commands, <U+017F>he will bring the Body into <U+017F>ubjection to all the vertuous actions <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>es her <U+017F>elf. And then the Vertues will be naturaliz'd in man, and the Que<U+017F>tion propos'd will meet with a contrary Solution; for in that Ca<U+017F>e, it will be much more hard for the vertuous man to do that which is evil, than for the vicious to do well; ina<U+017F>much as the virtuous per<U+017F>on by that mortification of the Sen<U+017F>es, will be in a manner reduc'd to the <U+017F>tate of original innocence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tor'd to the glorious condition Man was in before the Fall.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>uch a moral regeneration is a great Cabali<U+017F>tical Secret, unknown to all the learned; that <U+017F>uch a mortification and de<U+017F>truction of the Sen<U+017F>es as was propos'd, is a work not yet well di<U+017F>cover'd to the Curious, as tran<U+017F>cending all common rules. For, if the Soul acts not without the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Organs, and the interior and exterior Sen<U+017F>es, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or de<U+017F>troying of the<U+017F>e will contribute to the weakning of the Soul; and in<U+017F>tead of making a Prophet, the transformation will be into <U+017F>ome Hypochondriack, or extravagant Phanatick, as it happens to tho<U+017F>e who macerate their Bodies by an indi<U+017F>creet zeal; in<U+017F>omuch that having not the perfect knowledg of that Science, it were more expedient that men had a recour<U+017F>e to the ordinary means of Morality, to regulate the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the Soul, and bring her to the pur<U+017F>uance of Virtue. Now according to the rules of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:66371:225"/>
even tho<U+017F>e who are good, are much inclin'd to evil, and find it no ea<U+017F>ie matter to oppo<U+017F>e it.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <U+017F>aid, That it is as hard a matter for the vicious per<U+017F>on to do well, as it is for the virtuous to do ill, in regard that the inclination, which the good man hath to do good and e<U+017F>chew evil, is equal to that of the wicked per<U+017F>on, which is always bent to do evil, it being very difficult for him to embrace Virtue by <U+017F>hunning Vice, by rea<U+017F>on of the aver<U+017F>ion which he hath to that which is good. And to make this the more clear, we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o naturally addicted to the exerci<U+017F>es of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that what they do <U+017F>eems to be without any <U+017F>tudy. Whence it may be deduc'd, that the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>eeds of Virtue and Good proceed from tho<U+017F>e natural Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions, which are called <hi>Inclinations,</hi> and, con<U+017F>equently, the difficulties in both are concluded to be equal. And that may al<U+017F>o be ob<U+017F>erv'd in <hi>Socrates,</hi> who him<U+017F>elf acknowledg'd, that his natural Inclinations were <U+017F>o bent to Vice, that if the dictates of Philo<U+017F>ophy had not wrought things in him be<U+017F>eeming the per<U+017F>on, whom the Oracle had declar'd <hi>wi<U+017F>e,</hi> he would have been carry'd away with <U+017F>en<U+017F>ual Appetites, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his natural Inclinations; there being <U+017F>ome Natures truly Heroick, and ever doing well; and others bruti<U+017F>h, and always inclin'd to evil. To this we are to add the con<U+017F>ideration of the per<U+017F>ons, their qualities, and age; ina<U+017F>much as there being <U+017F>omewhat particular in any of the<U+017F>e circum<U+017F>tances, it changes the re<U+017F>olution in the general propo<U+017F>ition, which being univer<U+017F>al, and of a large extent, it were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, in order to the finding out of the Truth, that we confin'd our <U+017F>elves to the<U+017F>e circum<U+017F>tances, yet <U+017F>till following the forementioned opinion. For as fire finds no difficulty to a<U+017F>cend, no more than the water does to flow down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and make towards its centre; <U+017F>o every one complying with his own Inclinations, <U+017F>tands in an equal bent towards good and evil, without any trouble or difficulty; but to proceed contrary to that motion, the virtuous per<U+017F>on finds the trouble attending the doing of a evil action, equal to that of the vicious in doing a bad one.</p>
            <p>The Eighth <U+017F>aid, That this bent of the Inclinations cea<U+017F>es in tho<U+017F>e who are one while inclin'd to the doing of that which is good, another, to the doing of that which is evil, as may be ob<U+017F>erv'd in <hi>Nero,</hi> who, during the fir<U+017F>t five years of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was the milde<U+017F>t of any of the Emperours, yet afterwards gave him<U+017F>elf over to all manner of Cruelty. For what can be <U+017F>aid of this alteration, and if a man be naturally inclin'd to good, Why is not the <U+017F>ame inclination continued in him? Does this incon<U+017F>tancy proceed from the mind or from the body? If it proceeds from the mind, <U+017F>ince the powers thereof have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of the Good, Why does it not embrace that which is good, an<U+017F>werably to its knowledge of the <U+017F>ame? If it proceeds from the body, <U+017F>ince this hath a dependance on the mind, why does it not follow the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions which it derives
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:66371:225"/>
from the other? The Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of A<U+017F>trology, who give <U+017F>o much credit to their Influences; affirm, that the<U+017F>e diver<U+017F>ities proceed from tho<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>tellations, whereby that change is cau<U+017F>ed, and by which the Will is moved, and receives a bent either to good or evil; but if Rea<U+017F>on have the <U+017F>overeignty, it ought to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and produce <U+017F>uch effects as are an<U+017F>werable thereto. There is therefore a great probability, that the cau<U+017F>es of good and bad actions are to be referr'd to the regeneration of the Elect, and the reprobation of the wicked, who are left to the pur<U+017F>uance of their <U+017F>en<U+017F>uality; and thence it will follow, that it <U+017F>hall be as hard for a truly-devout per<U+017F>on to <U+017F>in, as for a reprobate to do well; and <U+017F>o the Que<U+017F>tion is to be referr'd to the deci<U+017F>ion of Theology.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXIII. Whether a piece of Iron laid upon the Cask prevents Thunder from marring Wine contain'd within it, and why?</head>
            <p>SInce we are always to begin with that which is undenyable in matter of fact, whereby we are a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd, that a piece of Iron laid upon a ve<U+017F><U+017F>el full of Wine, prevents its being corrupted by Thunder, which, without that precaution, would cau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>ome prejudice; which precaution hath al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>ame effect in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erving the Eggs which the Hen <U+017F>its upon, and in keeping Milk from turning; all the difficulty of this Que<U+017F>tion is only in the latter part of it, and that is, to find out the rea<U+017F>on thereof, which mu<U+017F>t either be referr'd to <U+017F>ome occult vertue in the Iron, or to <U+017F>ome of its manife<U+017F>t qualities. If it be <U+017F>aid that this is wrought by the manife<U+017F>t qualities of that metal; it <U+017F>eems requi<U+017F>ite that the Iron <U+017F>hould be within the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el with the Wine, that <U+017F>o it may oppo<U+017F>e the poy<U+017F>on of the Air whereby it is infected. But on the other <U+017F>ide, to alledge tho<U+017F>e occult vertues, is an argument of humane ignorance, ina<U+017F>much as they are to act by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition of <U+017F>ome means: So that, all things con<U+017F>idered, it is more rationally affirm'd, to be an effect proceeding from the manife<U+017F>t qualities of the Iron, which prevent and hinder that bad impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of the Air. But to give a more evident rea<U+017F>on hereof, we are to con<U+017F>ult A<U+017F>trology. That Science teaches us, that <hi>Mars,</hi> by which Planet Iron is de<U+017F>igned, hath its Hou<U+017F>e in <hi>Aries,</hi> which is the <U+017F>ign of the Ram; and the Naturali<U+017F>ts ob<U+017F>erve, that the Sun entring into that Hou<U+017F>e, cau<U+017F>es the <U+017F>ap and moi<U+017F>ture of the Vine to a<U+017F>cend, an evident <U+017F>ign that there is a corre<U+017F>pondence between Wine and Iron, and that the one pre<U+017F>erves the other by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sympathy there is between them. And to make it appear that the Influences exerci<U+017F>e their vertues even upon things inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,

yet deriv'd from the root of what had been Vegetable or Animal, we find that Wine, though it be carried ever <U+017F>o far, is <U+017F>ubject to an ob<U+017F>ervable alteration, when the grapes of the <U+017F>ame Vine are near their maturity; that di<U+017F>tance of Places and Climates not ob<U+017F>tructing the Union and Corre<U+017F>pondence which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the whole and its part, which cannot be joyned together <U+017F>ave only by means of the Cele<U+017F>tial Influences.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the foremention'd rea<U+017F>on deduc'd from A<U+017F>trology was not evident, and that there is more <U+017F>ubtilty in it than Truth, and, con<U+017F>equently, that it is to be <U+017F>ought with greater probability to find it out of Natural Philo<U+017F>ophy, which treats of Meteors, where the greate<U+017F>t difficulty is to know whether that effect is produc'd by the expul<U+017F>ive, or by the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and retentive vertue. That we <U+017F>hould affirm it proceeds from the expul<U+017F>ive vertue, cannot with any probability be done, ina<U+017F>much as expul<U+017F>ion is to be wrought by <U+017F>omewhat that is more powerful and more <U+017F>ubtile. Now there is not any likelyhood, that Iron <U+017F>hould be more powerful and more <U+017F>ubtile than Air, ina<U+017F>much as the Iron is of a more weighty matter, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive, earthy, and hath <U+017F>omewhat of the nature of that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive Element. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather affirm, that this effect is wrought by the attractive and retentive vertue; which opinion is prov'd, in regard there is but one humid matter, which the central fire forces from the deepe<U+017F>t part of the Earth; and of the more unctuous and weighty part of this matter Metals are made; of the le<U+017F>s weighty, Minerals and Salts; from the <U+017F>ubtiler part Vegetables and Animals derive their nouri<U+017F>hment; of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtile are produc'd the Winds, Thunder, and all the Meteors, which participate of Heat and Drought, which make <U+017F>everal combinations in the Air. Now whereas it is from the mo<U+017F>t imperfect part of this unctuous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Iron is made, of an earthy and impure Sulphur, it is dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible thence, that there is a Sympathy between Iron, and the gro<U+017F>s vapours of Thunder and Lightning: To make which out a little more clearly, we find that the places through which Thunder hath pa<U+017F>s'd, <U+017F>mell of Sulphur; nay, there is fram'd in the Air that which is commonly called the Thunderbolt, which <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what re<U+017F>embles Steel, as it were to <U+017F>hew the corre<U+017F>pondence there is between Iron and Thunder. So that the Air, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate by tho<U+017F>e noi<U+017F>ome terre<U+017F>trial vapours, which are of the <U+017F>ame nature with Iron, meeting with <U+017F>ome piece of it laid on a ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, is joyn'd to the Iron by Sympathy, makes a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>top there, and puts a period to its operation; and the Iron by its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive vertue receives them, as by its retentive it retains them, and by that means prevents their effect.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That though that opinion were probable, yet doth it require a more ample di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and we are to examine how this attractive vertue operates. Now there are four Natural Vertues which govern all the operations of Nature and Art; the <hi>Attractive,</hi> which is now under con<U+017F>ideration, acts by heat
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:66371:226"/>
and a temperate drought; the <hi>Retentive,</hi> by drought and cold; the <hi>Expul<U+017F>ive,</hi> by moi<U+017F>ture and heat; the <hi>Dige<U+017F>tive,</hi> by heat and a temperate moi<U+017F>ture. The Iron then which is <U+017F>aid to attract the<U+017F>e vapours, hath indeed tho<U+017F>e qualities of heat and drought; yet can it not be ea<U+017F>ily conceiv'd, that a little piece of that mettal can check the malice and infection of a great quantity of Air, <U+017F>pread all over a <U+017F>pacious place; be<U+017F>ides that it is al<U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that the Iron <U+017F>hould <U+017F>end forth out of it <U+017F>elf the effects of its qualities, that <U+017F>o the attraction might be made, the marks whereof are neither <U+017F>een on the Iron, nor the effects of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities out of the Subject, ina<U+017F>much as mettals being quench'd in cold Water, are not evaporated but by a violent fire. So that it may as well be <U+017F>aid, that the attraction is wrought by <U+017F>ome occult vertue, which draws; yet <U+017F>o as that neither the attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor the manner of it can be ob<U+017F>erv'd.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That the operations of Nature are not like tho<U+017F>e of Art; her ways and contrivances are more ob<U+017F>cure, and the cau<U+017F>es of things are occult; as for example, the Load-<U+017F>tone draws Iron, yet <U+017F>o as that there cannot be any thing perceiv'd of any body of air and <U+017F>moak i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the Load<U+017F>tone. And the magnetical Bal<U+017F>om, or Weapon-<U+017F>alve, cures a wounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, though at a great di<U+017F>tance; having only <U+017F>ome part of his Cloths, yet can there not any thing be ob<U+017F>erv'd on the Subject which receives the Plai<U+017F>ter; <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecret and <U+017F>ilent is Nature in her Operations. On the contrary, the de<U+017F>igns and contrivances of Art may ea<U+017F>ily be di<U+017F>cover'd, as tho<U+017F>e of a Clock or Watch. But the rea<U+017F>on of this diver<U+017F>ity of operations between Art and Nature, is, that Art goes to work publickly and before the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, and Nature does her bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s within doors and <U+017F>ecretly; the latter works in the Centre, the other in the Circumference; one produces the <U+017F>eed of the combination of the Elements, whereof <U+017F>he keeps an exact account of the weights and proportions; and the other can neither make nor produce any thing, as being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a capacity of making u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and materials of Nature, in order to their joyning together, after <U+017F>he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd and purify'd them. But on the other <U+017F>ide, Art hath this advantage, that her works are much more perfect, ina<U+017F>much as <U+017F>he makes u<U+017F>e of purify'd e<U+017F><U+017F>ences, and the other of accidents and <U+017F>uperfluities, having not in<U+017F>truments fit for the purifying of her Materials. So that there are <U+017F>ome who doubt of the reality of the effect now under con<U+017F>ideration. And therefore, ere we proceed any further to the finding out of the cau<U+017F>es and rea<U+017F>ons thereof, it were requi<U+017F>ite a <U+017F>trict enquiry <U+017F>hould be made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be certain that Iron prevents the effects of thunder, by pre<U+017F>erving Wine and Eggs under a Hen that <U+017F>its, from receiving in any prejudice.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That what was confirm'd by general experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was not any longer to be que<U+017F>tion'd, and that whoever <U+017F>tood upon the Negative betray'd his own ignorance; that for
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:66371:227"/>
us to think to find <U+017F>olutions for all the po<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities of nature, were an attempt <U+017F>omewhat like that of exhau<U+017F>ting the Sea; That there are certain <U+017F>ecrets in Nature of things dreadful to humane Rea<U+017F>on, incredible, according to the principles of Art and of our Knowledge. That Nature is the great <hi>Circe,</hi> the grand Sorcere<U+017F>s, That the Load-<U+017F>tone draws Iron to it; That there is a certain Stone called <hi>Pantarbe</hi> which draws gold to it; That dead Ar<U+017F>e-<U+017F>mart being laid under a Stone, cures the wound on which it <U+017F>hall be rubb'd, <U+017F>ooner or later according as the Herb putrifies; That the hair or wool of a mangy bea<U+017F>t being thru<U+017F>t in, for a certain time, under the bark of an A<U+017F>pen-tree, cures the bea<U+017F>t of vermine; That the <hi>Menstrua</hi> of Women trouble Springs, <U+017F>poyl Looking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es and Powdering-tubs; And if there be <U+017F>ome things that corrupt them, it is not to be imagin'd that Nature is <U+017F>o cruel a Step-mother, but that there may be others whereby they are pre<U+017F>erv'd, and <U+017F>o the Remedies may come from the <U+017F>ame hand as caus'd the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; That the Hazel-tree di<U+017F>covers hidden Trea<U+017F>ures and Mines; That Tali<U+017F>mans are made again<U+017F>t Serpents and In<U+017F>ects, nay again<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; That there is a mutual friend<U+017F>hip between the Olive-tree and the Myrtle, whereof it would be as hard a matter to give any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, as it would be to give any, of the enmity between the Vine and the Laurel, and the inclination which the Male-palm hath towards the Female; That the crowing of the Cock frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens Lyons, and that that Bird <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o exact a Fore-teller of the Sun's approach; That the Fi<U+017F>h called a Remora, <U+017F>tops Ships under <U+017F>ail; That the eye of a Dog prepar'd after a certain way keeps others from coming near the per<U+017F>on that hath it; That the powder of Crab-<U+017F>hells prepar'd, draws out Arrows and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets <U+017F>hot into the Body; That there is a certain Stone got out of the Snake, which cures <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>ubject to the Drop<U+017F>ie; That Serpents are not found within the <U+017F>hade of A<U+017F>h-trees; That the Marygold follows the motion of the Sun; That the precious Stone called a Topaze put into <U+017F>eething water, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <U+017F>tayes the <U+017F>eething of it; That the Emerald, the Saphire, the Turqueis Stone, and Coral, change their colours, upon the happening of certain accidents to tho<U+017F>e who have them about them; That there are certain Herbs which cha<U+017F>e away <U+017F>pirits, as well as Mu<U+017F>ick does; and that the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of a black and adu<U+017F>t choler invite and entertain them. Now from all the<U+017F>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances it may be deduc'd, that, as it is a great pre<U+017F>umption to think to give rea<U+017F>ons of all things, <U+017F>o does it argue a certain weakne<U+017F>s of mind to doubt of all that hath been alledged; <U+017F>o great are the aby<U+017F><U+017F>es and inexhau<U+017F>tible trea<U+017F>ures of Nature, who<U+017F>e operations tran<U+017F>cend humane belief, in thou<U+017F>ands of other things, as well as in the Que<U+017F>tion now under di<U+017F>pute.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXIV. Of Stage-Plays; and whether they be advantageous to a State, or not?</head>
            <p>HUmane Life is travers'd by <U+017F>uch a vici<U+017F><U+017F>itude of di<U+017F>tractions and di<U+017F>turbances, that not only the Civil, but al<U+017F>o the Eccle<U+017F>ia<U+017F>tical Magi<U+017F>trates have unanimou<U+017F>ly concluded it nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary, that men <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>ome diverti<U+017F>ements, whereby their minds and bodies, not able to undergo continual labour, might receive <U+017F>ome relaxation, for want whereof they would be cru<U+017F>h'd under the burthen of their affairs. Now among tho<U+017F>e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxations, there is not any brings greater delight with it, then what is perform'd on the Theatre, that is, Plays; which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent unto us things pa<U+017F>t, heighten'd with all the circum<U+017F>tances they are capable of, which cannot be done by Hi<U+017F>tory, as being a thing dead, and not animated by Voice, Ge<U+017F>tures, and Habits. But if we add thereto, that this innocent diverti<U+017F>ement is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by tho<U+017F>e advantages which may be deduc'd from excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sentences and In<U+017F>tructions, we mu<U+017F>t conclude him who finds fault with it, to be of a more than <hi>Timonian</hi> humour, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s'd enemy to civil Society. The proof hereof is deriv'd from the U<U+017F>e of it, the true Touch-<U+017F>tone, whereby good and profitable things are to be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd from <U+017F>uch as are hurtful and unprofitable. For there have been an infinite number of things taught by Men, which have been <U+017F>mother'd as <U+017F>oon as brought forth; and there are others al<U+017F>o, which the Inventors of them have out-liv'd; but when an Invention finds a kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment through many Ages, it is the be<U+017F>t argument that may be of its goodne<U+017F>s. And <U+017F>uch is that of Comedy, which (how weak or ridiculous <U+017F>oever it might be at the beginning, at which time <hi>The<U+017F>pis</hi> got him<U+017F>elf drawn through the Streets in a Chariot, as he recited his Poems) pre<U+017F>ently met with tho<U+017F>e who made it their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to cultivate and heighten it to that pitch of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whereto it is now come, which is <U+017F>uch that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greate<U+017F>t minds <U+017F>hould yield to the charms of it. For as tho<U+017F>e things that are <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, are more apt to move and make impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions on the <U+017F>pirits of men, then <U+017F>uch as are purely intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible; <U+017F>o Plays, expo<U+017F>ing to our eyes all things with a greater circum<U+017F>pection, decorum, and order, then is ob<U+017F>ervable in the actions of men commonly di<U+017F>turbed by unexpected emergencies, and the uncon<U+017F>tancy of their pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, accordingly rai<U+017F>e in us a greater aver<U+017F>ion for crimes, and greater inclinations to vertue. Nay, the<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>e more apprehen<U+017F>ive emotions in our <U+017F>ouls, than they are apt to receive from any other repre<U+017F>entations what<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not excepting even the precepts of Philo<U+017F>ophy it <U+017F>elf, which
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:66371:228"/>
are weak enough when they are de<U+017F>titute of their examples, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing in us <U+017F>uch Characters as can hardly be blotted out, in regard they force their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age into our Minds through <U+017F>everal of our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es; and as Hi<U+017F>tory prevails more by its Examples than the rea<U+017F>on of its Precepts, <U+017F>o Playes have the advantage of Hi<U+017F>tory in this regard, that in the former, things act upon us with greater effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. This Influences it hath on us in captivating our Sen<U+017F>es and Under<U+017F>tanding, is the more remarkable, in that the greate<U+017F>t Witts are incapable of other reflections, while they behold what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ented on the Stage. Be<U+017F>ides, if the great bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of the world be truly con<U+017F>ider'd, it is but a Stage-Play, wherein every one acts a part; he who would avoid Plays, and not <U+017F>ee the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of humane actions, mu<U+017F>t find out <U+017F>ome way to get out of the world. Nor are all per<U+017F>ons in a capacity to learn how they <U+017F>hould demean them<U+017F>elves by Books and Precepts, but all are <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of <U+017F>ome in<U+017F>truction by Playes; <U+017F>ince that in the<U+017F>e, there are <U+017F>uch <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Le<U+017F><U+017F>ons, that the mo<U+017F>t ignorant may find in them certain encouragements to Vertue, which on the Stage appears to them in her lu<U+017F>tre, and attended by tho<U+017F>e honourable rewards which the Poets be<U+017F>tow on Heroick Actions. And as Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Maps cannot <U+017F>o well acquaint tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>tudy them with the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of people, together with all the circum<U+017F>tances of places, as Travels and Relations may: In like manner, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophy <U+017F>mites not the Sen<U+017F>es, as tho<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages do which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ented on the Theatre, where <U+017F>uch as are in Love (the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <U+017F>ubject thereof) may ob<U+017F>erve their own Adventures per<U+017F>ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and take notice of their vain pur<U+017F>uits, and the unhappy events of tho<U+017F>e which are carried on by unju<U+017F>t wayes. In fine, if immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality flatters ours labours with promi<U+017F>es to tran<U+017F>mit our Memory to Ages; yet at a great di<U+017F>tance from us, what greater <U+017F>atisfaction can there be, than to hope that our noble actions <U+017F>hall be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented on Theaters before Princes and Magi<U+017F>trates?</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Humane Nature being more enclin'd to evil than to good, tho<U+017F>e confus'd repre<U+017F>entations which are made on the Stage, of all <U+017F>orts of good and bad things, are more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of evil in the minds of men, than to render them more inclinable to that which is good. Whence it is to be inferr'd, that the danger and inconveniences of Plays will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh their advantages. This con<U+017F>ideration occa<U+017F>ion'd the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hing of them out of <U+017F>everal States. And whereas the Subjects of them are commonly taken from the Loves of <U+017F>ome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant per<U+017F>ons, and the crimes attending them, the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mu<U+017F>t be an<U+017F>werable to the means, which are lewd Artifices, whereby it is compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and where-with mens minds are imbu'd, and <U+017F>o inclin'd to wicked actions, and <U+017F>uch as are mo<U+017F>t likely to promote the execution of their pernicious de<U+017F>igns; which would not happen, were they ignorant of them. Nay, to go to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of this kind of entertainments, the mo<U+017F>t ancient of them, acted in the time of <hi>Romulus,</hi> was contriv'd for the <U+017F>urprizal and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:66371:228"/>
carrying away of the <hi>Sabine</hi> Virgins; it being ea<U+017F>ily inferr'd, that what produc'd <U+017F>o bad an effect mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity have been a bad cau<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That Playes con<U+017F>ider'd in them<U+017F>elves were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but that according to the diver<U+017F>ity of their Minds who frequent them, they have a different operation; as Wine exce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ively taken be<U+017F>ots and layes <U+017F>ome a<U+017F>leep, and enlivens others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the difference of their Temperaments. For if they meet with weak Minds, they imprint in them the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the things that are repre<U+017F>ented, much more ea<U+017F>ily than Books u<U+017F>ually do. But if they are per<U+017F>ons of a <U+017F>trong Con<U+017F>titution of Intellectuals, they con<U+017F>ider what they <U+017F>ee as a pure Fiction, and a draught of Painting, in the intrigues whereof they find a certain diverti<U+017F>ement, much like that of excellent P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inters in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pectives; they are pleas'd to <U+017F>ee a mi<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>t before the eyes of the vulgar, while they them<U+017F>elves are <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>atisfi'd, that what others think repre<U+017F>ented to the life, is only perform'd by the interpo<U+017F>ition of Scenes: So that, from this diver<U+017F>ity of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, this only can be inferr'd, that Playes and Opera's are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous and innocent diverti<U+017F>ements to <U+017F>uch as are well-vers'd in the affairs of the world, who, being over-pre<U+017F>s'd with a continu'd earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s in the pro<U+017F>ecution of their more <U+017F>erious concerns, find a certain relaxation therein; not in a melancholy <U+017F>loath, <U+017F>uch as is incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with the activity which is natural to them, but in tho<U+017F>e le<U+017F>s <U+017F>erious employments; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons who are already too much enclin'd to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, vanity, and effeminacy, ought not to be admitted to Plays, in regard they can have no other effect on them, than to make them more effeminate.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That as Women are ju<U+017F>tly forbidden the u<U+017F>e of the Sciences, <U+017F>o ought they al<U+017F>o to be forbidden the <U+017F>ight of Plays; ina<U+017F>much as it is not expedient, in order to frugal Hou<U+017F>e-keeping, that that Sex <U+017F>hould be allow'd an acquaintance with tho<U+017F>e curio<U+017F>ities which might divert them from the care they ought to have of their dome<U+017F>tick affairs. For, be<U+017F>ides the lo<U+017F>s of time, idlene<U+017F>s is extreamly prejudicial to that Sex, who<U+017F>e por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <U+017F>hould be a<U+017F><U+017F>iduity in labour, frugality, and a con<U+017F>tant keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hou<U+017F>e, which is not con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with the frequenting of Shews and Play-hou<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>eeing the repre<U+017F>entations made there: Which, the more in<U+017F>tructive they are, and the more likely to fill Womens heads with new things, the more ought they to be forbidden the <U+017F>ight of them; there being not any thing a Hu<U+017F>band <U+017F>hould fear <U+017F>o much in his Wife, as an exce<U+017F>s of Wit, upon the conceit whereof <U+017F>he a<U+017F><U+017F>umes to her <U+017F>elf a certain autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over him, contrary to the In<U+017F>titution of Matrimony, or at lea<U+017F>t thinks her <U+017F>elf equal to him, which is not much le<U+017F>s to be fear'd, ina<U+017F>much as it is a great di<U+017F>turbance to the dome<U+017F>tick tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. This may be the better apprehended by the example of two Men equally learned, who di<U+017F>puting one again<U+017F>t the other,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:66371:229"/>
<U+017F>eldom come to any agreement, as a knowing and an ignorant per<U+017F>on many times do; for if the latter chance to contradict him<U+017F>elf, he is ea<U+017F>ily convinc'd, and acquie<U+017F>ces. And though the <hi>Greeks</hi> <U+017F>ometimes admitted Women in their Academies, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the functions of Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors and Regents, yet are not tho<U+017F>e examples to be introduc'd into this Age, whereof the corruption is <U+017F>uch, as is able to change Vertues into Vices. But, from this general Rule we are to except <U+017F>uch <hi>Heroina's,</hi> as are the great Exemplars of all Vertues, who <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the greate<U+017F>t part of Men in Wit and Intellectuals, it were injurious to think them <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of tho<U+017F>e bad impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which the Men are able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the example of the <hi>Romans</hi> who gave extraordinary <U+017F>alaries to Comedians, as <hi>Cicero</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ures us they did to <hi>Ro<U+017F>cius,</hi> <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>hews the advantages of publick repre<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And indeed, if there be any thing to be blam'd in Plays, it is this, that they are too Pathetick, that is, too apt to rai<U+017F>e and expre<U+017F>s Humane Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. For as an Oration mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ur'd in Ver<U+017F>e, is more elaborate than Pro<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o Ver<U+017F>es, di<U+017F>pos'd by a <U+017F>ound Judgement for the Stage, are extreamly beyond tho<U+017F>e of Exegematick Poems, wherein only the Poet <U+017F>peaks him<U+017F>elf. Moreover, the ob<U+017F>ervance of Time, whereto all the Acts are confin'd, and the other Laws of Dramatick Pieces, di<U+017F>cover their excellency above all others. So that to que<U+017F>tion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are advantageous, is to bring into doubt, Whether the Ma<U+017F>ter-pieces of Poets, Orators, and Hi<U+017F>torians, are advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to a State.</p>

of all the<U+017F>e Temperaments is mo<U+017F>t convenient, in order to health, and in the <U+017F>econd, whether the <U+017F>ame will al<U+017F>o be mo<U+017F>t convenient for the acqui<U+017F>ition of a good mind, that is, for the better exerci<U+017F>e of the functions of the rational Soul; in a word, whether the mo<U+017F>t healthy per<U+017F>on <U+017F>hall always be the mo<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>e? <hi>Galen</hi> hath writ an expre<U+017F>s Treati<U+017F>e, to prove that the Manners follow the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body, and therefore <U+017F>ince tho<U+017F>e manners are the effects of the Will, the noble<U+017F>t of all the faculties of the Soul, in regard it hath a Soveraignty over all the others, it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative is to be maintain'd, e<U+017F>pecially if we lay this for a ground, that tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons who are <U+017F>ubject to Melancholy are the mo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, fora<U+017F>much as they are the mo<U+017F>t healthy; cold and drought making up a more <U+017F>olid and firm ma<U+017F>s, then any other two qualities; and heat and moi<U+017F>ture being too variable, and too much <U+017F>ubject to corruption. Upon which con<U+017F>ideration, <hi>Galen,</hi> in his fir<U+017F>t Book of the <hi>Temperaments,</hi> chap. 4. denies, <hi>That the Spring is hot and moi<U+017F>t; on the contrary,</hi> <U+017F>aith he, <hi>it is the wor<U+017F>t of all the Temperaments of the Air whereby we are encompa<U+017F>s'd, and that is commonly the con<U+017F>titution ob<U+017F>ervable in <U+017F>ickly and contagious <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons.</hi> In his eighth Book of the <hi>Method of curing Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es,</hi> chap. 7. he adds, That <hi>a hot and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper makes our health incline to corruption.</hi> The hot and dry is al<U+017F>o too ea<U+017F>ily inclinable to be enflam'd, as the cold and moi<U+017F>t is too much <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to defluxions; and withal to <U+017F>harp Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, <U+017F>uch as are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Feavers, for the fir<U+017F>t; Burning Feavers, for the <U+017F>econd; and Apoplexies, Pal<U+017F>ies, and Drop<U+017F>ies, for the la<U+017F>t. On the other <U+017F>ide, cold and drought are enemies to corruption, and by tho<U+017F>e very qualities which are contrary thereto, they more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully oppo<U+017F>e external injuries, by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>olidity of the <U+017F>kin, and the den<U+017F>ity of its parts; as the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly per<U+017F>ons are not <U+017F>ubject to the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate di<U+017F>turbances of the Cholerick, the incon<U+017F>tancy of the Sanguine, the <U+017F>lothfulne<U+017F>s of the Phlegmatick; and communicate the <U+017F>ame Stability which is in them to the Spirits, which act an<U+017F>werably thereto. Of this Con<U+017F>titution were all tho<U+017F>e laborious and <U+017F>tudious people, and all the great Per<U+017F>ons, who<U+017F>e a<U+017F><U+017F>iduous employments have made them famous in their own and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent Ages.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That if we may believe the <U+017F>ame <hi>Galen,</hi> in the <U+017F>ixth Book of the pre<U+017F>ervation of Health, the hot and moi<U+017F>t Temperament is the mo<U+017F>t healthy, <hi>as being the mo<U+017F>t proper to man's nature</hi>; and he-further writes, That <hi>tho<U+017F>e who are very moi<U+017F>t, are long-liv'd, and when their bodies are come to their full <U+017F>trength, they are more healthy then others, and are more robu<U+017F>t and hardy then other men of the <U+017F>ame Age, and <U+017F>o continue till they grow old. And thence it is,</hi> <U+017F>aith he, <hi>That all the Phy<U+017F>icians and Philo<U+017F>ophers, who have diligently examined the Elements of man's body have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that Temperament.</hi> For, as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> affirms in his Book of a long and <U+017F>hort life, <hi>Our life con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in heat and moi<U+017F>ture, as cold and drought di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e us towards death, and the <U+017F>ooner the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:66371:230"/>
grows cold and dry, the <U+017F>ooner it grows old and dies.</hi> But the<U+017F>e two contrary <U+017F>entiments of <hi>Galen</hi> may be reconcil'd well enough, by affirming his meaning to be, that exrernal heat and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture are enemies to health; whereas on the contrary, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat and radical moi<U+017F>ture are friends to it; ina<U+017F>much as the<U+017F>e are never chargeable with exce<U+017F>s, but always moderate, one <U+017F>erving for aliment to the other; and they are <U+017F>o far from being capable of receiving any di<U+017F>temper, that, what re<U+017F>ults from them, <U+017F>erves for a rule whereto all the other Temperaments are referred; which the Vulgar improperly calls by the name of the four Humours, that are predominant in them; but that abu<U+017F>e being fortify'd by cu<U+017F>tom, we mu<U+017F>t follow it, though for no other rea<U+017F>on then that we may be the better under<U+017F>tood. Whence it follows, that the Sanguine Temperament is the mo<U+017F>t healthy, as being the mo<U+017F>t conformable to life. This Temperament is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o the likelie<U+017F>t to produce a good Wit, ina<U+017F>much as it exerci<U+017F>es better then any other the functions of the Rational Soul, which being di<U+017F>tributed between the natural, vital, and animal Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the<U+017F>e being better exercis'd when they mo<U+017F>t abound with clear and purify'd <U+017F>pirits, it is certain, that the Sanguine Temperament, the only trea<U+017F>ury of the Spirits, <U+017F>upplies more plentifully, and with <U+017F>uch as are more pure, tho<U+017F>e in whom it is predominant, then it can be imagin'd to do others, in whom that blood is either puffed up by an exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive froath of Choler, or drown'd in the wateri<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s of Phlegm, or bury'd in the mud of Melancholy. And this may be ob<U+017F>erv'd in the gentilene<U+017F>s, and the <U+017F>ingular <U+017F>leight, nay the ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, wherewith per<U+017F>ons of a <U+017F>anguine Con<U+017F>titution demean them<U+017F>elves in all things they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, betraying <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>miling chearfulne<U+017F>s in their eyes and countenance, as di<U+017F>covers their interiour joy and <U+017F>atisfaction; and is no le<U+017F>s delightful to tho<U+017F>e that are pre<U+017F>ent, then the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <U+017F>allies of the Cholerick give di<U+017F>tate, the <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>h delays of the Phlegmatick are tedious, and the profound reveries of the Melancholy hateful and importunate. But as for the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy, the only Objection, which the other Temperaments make again<U+017F>t the Sanguine, it is not to be accounted vicious in them, but look'd on as a diverti<U+017F>ement, wherewith they are pleas'd, and which they put them<U+017F>elves upon, only that their labours may, by that ohange, be the more delightful to them. Which change is <U+017F>o much the more excu<U+017F>able in them, that they court it not, to the end they <U+017F>hould be idle, but they may apply them<U+017F>elves to <U+017F>ome other employment, which <U+017F>uits better with their humour, <U+017F>uch as the over-long contemplation thereof might not dry up that noble blood which runs in their veins, and, by converting it into dregs, turn the <U+017F>anguine into a melancholick Con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to which the ob<U+017F>tinacy, wherewith it per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts a long time in the pro<U+017F>ecution of one and the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>ign, is a greater di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, than the incon<U+017F>tancy imputed to the <U+017F>anguine is to that, ina<U+017F>much as the latter makes advantage of it, to wit
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:66371:230"/>
that of attempting, and many times executing <U+017F>everal de<U+017F>igns together, e<U+017F>pecially when it undertakes <U+017F>uch as it is <U+017F>ure to ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>uch as may be Dancing, Mu<U+017F>ick, Court<U+017F>hip, well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contriv'd Stories, and <U+017F>uch other plea<U+017F>ant things. And indeed, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to exerci<U+017F>e the functions of the mind well, when the body is indi<U+017F>pos'd; as on the contrary, when the body is in perfect health, the mind acts its part <U+017F>o much the better.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That it were very unju<U+017F>t to deprive of the honour due to them, the Heroes and Worthies of the World, who<U+017F>e temperament mu<U+017F>t needs have been cholerick, by attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to any of the others the great and noble actions of the mind, which belong to them. Now to demon<U+017F>trate that the temperament of the Heroes con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted of heat and drought, we need bring in no further evidence, than the <U+017F>uddenne<U+017F>s and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherewith they undertake and execute all their de<U+017F>igns, as it were complying with the activity of Fire, which hath the <U+017F>upremacy among the Elements, as they have the preheminence among<U+017F>t men. Nay it may be urged, that great enterprizes would never be executed without <U+017F>ome degree of choler, which <U+017F>erves as it were for <U+017F>alt to all humane actions. This premis'd, as out of all di<U+017F>pute, we now come to con<U+017F>ider whether the hot and dry Temperament be the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with health. I affirm then, that it is more con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with it, than the Phlegmatick, which abounds in excrements; then the Sanguine, which ea<U+017F>ily admits of alterations; nay al<U+017F>o then the Melancholick, who<U+017F>e gro<U+017F>s humours are more <U+017F>ubject to ob<U+017F>truction, then Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is, the vivacity whereof is to be <U+017F>een upon all occa<U+017F>ions; tho<U+017F>e of the Cholerick Con<U+017F>titution having always their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els large, and, as <U+017F>uch, much more unlikely to be <U+017F>topp'd up.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, that <U+017F>o far as the <U+017F>oul and body are different, <U+017F>o far are al<U+017F>o their qualities <U+017F>uch. From which con<U+017F>ideration <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> took occa<U+017F>ion to affirm, That robu<U+017F>t bodies are de<U+017F>ign'd to obey, as the weak are to command, ina<U+017F>much as commonly they are the receptacles of a <U+017F>tronger <U+017F>oul. This rais'd a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ua<U+017F>ion in <U+017F>ome, that the mo<U+017F>t imperfect bodies have commonly the mo<U+017F>t perfect <U+017F>ouls, alledging to that purpo<U+017F>e, the example of the crooked and ill-<U+017F>hap'd Tree, which <U+017F>upplies us with the be<U+017F>t of Liquors, Wine; whereas the <U+017F>trait and fair-<U+017F>preading Oaks, bear nothing but acorns, for the feeding of Swine. Be<U+017F>ides, as the word <hi><U+017F>pirit</hi> or <hi>mind</hi> is <U+017F>ometimes taken for the Invention which principally con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the Imagination; <U+017F>ometimes for the Judgment, or Under<U+017F>tanding; and might be al<U+017F>o taken for the Memory, among which this la<U+017F>t requires a hot and moi<U+017F>t tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, as the fir<U+017F>t is pleas'd with a hot and dry; and the <U+017F>econd, to wit the judgment, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the dry and cold, which makes men <U+017F>taid and <U+017F>ettled: <U+017F>o is it accordingly requi<U+017F>ite, that we <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h, of which of the<U+017F>e three faculties the que<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be under<U+017F>tood. But generally <U+017F>peaking, it is not ea<U+017F>ily imaginable, that there <U+017F>hould be a well-fram'd mind in a much-indi<U+017F>pos'd

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXVI. Whether it be more expedient for a Man to have only one Friend or many.</head>
            <p>SInce Man is no further to be called <U+017F>o, then as he is <U+017F>ociable, and that there is no Society more delightful then that of Conver<U+017F>ation, which cannot be better maintain'd then by the relation and corre<U+017F>pondence there is between <U+017F>uch as are of a like di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, which pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e a Friend<U+017F>hip; it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem, that it is not grounded only on Rea<U+017F>on, but al<U+017F>o on Nature her <U+017F>elf, which <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts altogether by that Union, as <U+017F>he is ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de<U+017F>troy'd by di<U+017F>cord. And this is principally made apparent in civil life, wherein Friend<U+017F>hip is <U+017F>o powerful, that, being reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giou<U+017F>ly ob<U+017F>erv'd, there will be no need of Ju<U+017F>tice, <U+017F>ince every one would voluntarily render that to another which is due to him, which is the proper Work of that Vertue: which being in like manner well admini<U+017F>tred, that of Fortitude would al<U+017F>o be unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary; and it would be <U+017F>uperfluous to u<U+017F>e the rigour of the Laws, to oblige men to the doing of a thing which they exerci<U+017F>ed without any compul<U+017F>ion. Hence it came that the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>t Law-givers, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirms in his Ethicks, took more pains in e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing the Laws of Friend<U+017F>hip among their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, then tho<U+017F>e of Ju<U+017F>tice; ina<U+017F>much as the<U+017F>e latter take place, only upon the non-ob<U+017F>ervance of the former, which are <U+017F>o much the more durable, in regard they are grounded upon the pure freedom of the Will, without any other obligation, then that which our own choice hath impos'd on it <U+017F>elf, of its own accord, in a legal friend<U+017F>hip. Its nature al<U+017F>o is as much conceal'd as its effects are manife<U+017F>t, which are <U+017F>o convincing, that tho<U+017F>e, who have <U+017F>poken mo<U+017F>t advantageou<U+017F>ly of them, affirm that to take away Friend<U+017F>hip were to deprive the World of the light of the Sun; and that humane Society may as well be without it, as want the u<U+017F>e of Fire and Water. Nor is it their meaning to <U+017F>peak of that irregular Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, produc'd by the motion of the concupi<U+017F>cible Appetite, which is inclin'd towards a delightful good, and which only flattering the Sen<U+017F>es, tho<U+017F>e who are carry'd away with it are called amorous Per<U+017F>ons, and not Friends; but, of that Queen
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:66371:231"/>
of Vertues, which is enthron'd in the rational Appetite, excited by a vertuous Good, which being conceiv'd as amiable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to the Will, <U+017F>he loves and <U+017F>trictly embraces it, cau<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch a perfect union between him who loves, and him who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd, that they are but one heart and one <U+017F>oul, which, for that rea<U+017F>on is <U+017F>aid to be rather where it loves then where it lives. So that it being not to be imagin'd, that <U+017F>uch an union can be among many, neither can true friend<U+017F>hip be among many, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two, who<U+017F>e mutual corre<U+017F>pondence being the greater, their Friend<U+017F>hip is con<U+017F>equently more firm and durable. And it is more compleat between the<U+017F>e two Relatives, then it can be among many, who<U+017F>e corre<U+017F>pondence being more difficult, for want of the conditions requi<U+017F>ite to Friend<U+017F>hip, which are not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily met with in a greater number, it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible they may have a certain kindne<U+017F>s and good-will one towards another, but not a <U+017F>olid and <U+017F>incere Friend<U+017F>hip, which looks on a friend, as a <U+017F>econd Self, a relation that hath place only between two, whom Antiquity, for that rea<U+017F>on, order'd always to go by Couples.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That Friend<U+017F>hip could not continue long only between two friends, in regard that there being not any one but is chargeable with <U+017F>ome imperfection, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but that it <U+017F>hould produce <U+017F>ome coldne<U+017F>s and indifference, in his apprehen<U+017F>ions who takes notice of it, and that in time will come to an alienation, as it commonly happens in Friend<U+017F>hip. And this is yet the farther from being wel-<U+017F>etled, upon this accompt, that continual familiarity coming to di<U+017F>cover the weakne<U+017F><U+017F>es of one or the other, it can never be long without <U+017F>ome punctilio's and di<U+017F>putes, which are many times advanc'd to <U+017F>uch a height, that there is a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of a third per<U+017F>on to compo<U+017F>e their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. Now this mu<U+017F>t be done by one who is a common friend to both, and con<U+017F>equently, to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h a permanent friend<U+017F>hip, it is requi<U+017F>ite there <U+017F>hould be three, a number the more highly to be e<U+017F>teemed, in that the Graces con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of it; without which, Friend<U+017F>hip will be but of a <U+017F>hort continuance. Upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it was that the Tyrant <hi>Diony<U+017F>ius</hi> wi<U+017F>h'd that he might make up the third, with tho<U+017F>e two intimate, friends <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias.</hi> The <hi>Scythians</hi> al<U+017F>o, as <hi>Lucian</hi> affirms, to make up a perfect friend<U+017F>hip, requir'd that there <U+017F>hould be three per<U+017F>ons, who drunk together out of a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, into which they had <U+017F>pilt <U+017F>ome drops of their blood, wherewith they dy'd the points of their <U+017F>words.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That Friend<U+017F>hip, in re<U+017F>pect of our Will, was as Science in re<U+017F>pect of our Under<U+017F>tanding. For as this latter hath a natural inclination to Knowledge, <U+017F>o the Will is endu'd with <U+017F>uch another to Love, ina<U+017F>much as in it <U+017F>he finds her <U+017F>ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign good. Thence it comes, that as there are <U+017F>ome <U+017F>pirits <U+017F>o <U+017F>ublime, that, not content with one only knowledge, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <U+017F>everal, whereas there are others <U+017F>o circum<U+017F>crib'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, that only one Science wholly takes them up <U+017F>o, as that they
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:66371:232"/>
are not able to make any progre<U+017F>s into others; <U+017F>o are there <U+017F>ome Souls <U+017F>o limitted in their affection, that it can be dilated but to one object, which checks, and makes them incapable of loving any more, as tho<U+017F>e generous and heroick hearts do, which have <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong a bent to do well and to love; that, not <U+017F>atifi'd with one object, they diffu<U+017F>e their affections to all tho<U+017F>e whom they think worthy thereof. And <U+017F>o the deci<U+017F>ion of the que<U+017F>tion <U+017F>hould depend on the Capacities of tho<U+017F>e who love, <U+017F>ince that, con<U+017F>idering the amiable objects, whether they be <U+017F>uch, and, con<U+017F>equently, there be cau<U+017F>e for the loving of them, or are not really <U+017F>uch, but only <U+017F>o conceiv'd by the apprehen<U+017F>ive faculty, they are equally fit to move the Will to love them, and to gain its affections; and they ought to be the more agreeable to it, in that it finds in them its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and the accompli<U+017F>hment of its de<U+017F>ires. And <U+017F>o the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Friends is <U+017F>o far from being any prejudice to Friend<U+017F>hip, that it <U+017F>ets a greater e<U+017F>teem upon it, as al<U+017F>o on him who loves.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That Friend<U+017F>hip, taken generally, is a mutual Good-will between tho<U+017F>e who are de<U+017F>irous to do one another <U+017F>ome reciprocal kindne<U+017F>s; but taking it more preci<U+017F>ely, it may be defin'd a Vertue, by means whereof vertuous per<U+017F>ons are <U+017F>o united in Affection and Will, that they become ab<U+017F>olutely like one another, through a hearty good Will, Concord, and good Turns mutually done and receiv'd. The former re<U+017F>ides particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the interior motions of the mind; the <U+017F>econd, in words and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; the third, in effects. The<U+017F>e are the three e<U+017F><U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial marks of a vertuous Friend<U+017F>hip; which, not regarding its proper intere<U+017F>t, as tho<U+017F>e do, who love upon the account of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure or profit, courts not the objects it loves, out of any other con<U+017F>ideration than that of the Vertue or Science which render it recommendable. Now the<U+017F>e qualities being <U+017F>eldom found among many, who ought to be equally furni<U+017F>h'd therewith, that the Friend<U+017F>hip may be reciprocal, it is very hard to meet with <U+017F>o many Subjects capable of <U+017F>o <U+017F>ublime a Vertue as that; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides that combination of Vertues, requiring much experience, and a great proce<U+017F>s of time that we might not be deceiv'd in the choice of Friends, (with each whereof a Man, according to the common <U+017F>aying, <U+017F>hould eat a bu<U+017F>hel of Salt before he contracted a Friend<U+017F>hip) it will be found a much harder ta<U+017F>k to make <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>trict examination of the qualities and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of many, than it will be to do it of one alone; with whom, con<U+017F>equently, it is more <U+017F>afe to enter into Friend<U+017F>hip, than it can be with many.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That Friend<U+017F>hip being grounded on conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ation, and there being not any more divertive and delightful than that between tho<U+017F>e who eat and drink together, the Ca<U+017F>e is the <U+017F>ame with friends as it is with gue<U+017F>ts, which ought not to be under the number of three, nor exceed that of nine; whence came the ancient Proverb, that a well-ordered Fea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hould not be under the number of the Graces, nor tran<U+017F>cend that of the Mu<U+017F>es. In a word, <U+017F>ince conver<U+017F>ation is the ground-work of
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:66371:232"/>
perfect Friend<U+017F>hip, as the former cannot be plea<U+017F>ant among le<U+017F>s than three, and mu<U+017F>t be confus'd and weari<U+017F>ome among above nine; but is mo<U+017F>t divertive, when five or <U+017F>ix per<U+017F>ons well-qualifi'd, and perfectly under<U+017F>tanding one the other, fall into mutual di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o Friend<U+017F>hip cannot be of long continuance between two, but there mu<U+017F>t be a third to encourage it; yet with this further caution, that it is better maintain'd among a greater number of per<U+017F>ons equally vertuous, provided neverthele<U+017F>s it exceed not that of nine, to prevent the confu<U+017F>ion and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending a greater.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That though there be an ab<U+017F>olute nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of Friend<U+017F>hip, in all he tran<U+017F>actions of humane life, in order to the more plea<U+017F>ant expence of it, yet are there principally two cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, wherein its nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity is more apparent, to wit, tho<U+017F>e of Pro<U+017F>perity and Adver<U+017F>ity. In the former, our friends par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of our happine<U+017F>s, in the latter, of our misfortunes; and whereas the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t are commonly more frequent than good <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>es, the plurality of Friends, who are our <U+017F>econd-<U+017F>elves, making the burthen the more <U+017F>upportable by the part every one takes in our misfortunes; it is much more expedient that a Man <U+017F>hould have many, then content him<U+017F>elf with a <U+017F>mall number, which being not able to bear the brunt of <U+017F>o violent an a<U+017F><U+017F>ault, he would be in danger of being overcome thereby. Nay, though all things <U+017F>hould happen according to our wi<U+017F>hes, yet were it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to have a con<U+017F>iderable number of Friends, the more to congratulate our good fortune, which will make the greater noi<U+017F>e in the world, the greater their number is who approve and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud it.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <U+017F>aid, That the plurality of Friends was equally inconvenient, as well in good as bad fortune. For, in the latter, it mu<U+017F>t needs trouble us very much to give occa<U+017F>ion of grief to a great number of Friends, who though they bemoan us ever <U+017F>o much, yet are we <U+017F>till in the <U+017F>ame period of misfortune; nay, our unhappine<U+017F>s is the greater, in that it is contagiou<U+017F>ly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to <U+017F>o many per<U+017F>ons at the <U+017F>ame time. In the former, there cannot be any thing more trouble<U+017F>om then that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people who love, or pretend to love us in our pro<U+017F>perity, it being then impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for us equally to <U+017F>atisfie them all, as we might ea<U+017F>ily do one <U+017F>ingle Friend, from whom we may al<U+017F>o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive greater comfort in Adver<U+017F>ity, than from many addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves to us at the <U+017F>ame time; to who<U+017F>e humours to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate our <U+017F>elves well, we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tudy an uncon<U+017F>tancy equal to that of <hi>Proteus,</hi> and put on as many Countenances as they have different Inclinations.</p>
            <p>The Eighth <U+017F>aid, That <U+017F>ince a good thing is <U+017F>o much the more excellent, the more it is communicated and diffus'd <U+017F>everal ways, Friend<U+017F>hip ought to derive its e<U+017F>teem from that communication, which the greater it <U+017F>hall be, the more recommendable <U+017F>hall it make the Friend<U+017F>hip, which, con<U+017F>equently, is the more perfect
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:66371:233"/>
among many, to whom it is always advantageous, <U+017F>ince it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the three kinds of Goods, the profitable, the plea<U+017F>ant, and the vertuous. For, is there not much to be gain'd in a <U+017F>ocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which the more numerous it is, the greater advantages and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances may be deriv'd from it? There is not any thing <U+017F>o highly delightful as to love and to be belov'd of many. But whereas Friend<U+017F>hip is the Livery of Vertue, who<U+017F>e in<U+017F>eparable attendant <U+017F>he is, Can there be any thing more vertuous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable then after that manner to love <U+017F>everal others who love us, and by that reflux of mutual kindne<U+017F>s give a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of our Vertue, an<U+017F>werable to the acknowledgements we had made of their merit; the multitude of Friends not abating any thing of the e<U+017F>teem of civil Friend<U+017F>hip, no more than the great number of charitable per<U+017F>ons does prejudice Charity which is a con<U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Love, and equally embraces all?</p>

            <p>THere is not anything di<U+017F>quiets the Spirit of Man <U+017F>o much as the de<U+017F>ire he hath to know things to come; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he cannot of him<U+017F>elf attain thereto, by rea<U+017F>on of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of his knowledge, which he derives from, the Sen<U+017F>es and other corporeal powers; he will needs try what he can do out of him<U+017F>elf, and there is no place into which his curio<U+017F>ity hath not found a way to di<U+017F>cover what he <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ir'd.

The manner of declaring them was two-fold; one, by Dreams, or Nocturnal-Vi<U+017F>ions; the other, by an expre<U+017F>s Voice, which was di<U+017F>tinctly heard by tho<U+017F>e who came to con<U+017F>ult them.

            <p>The <U+017F>econd way, which was by expre<U+017F>s voice, was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perform'd by the whi<U+017F>pering-places of certain Grots; or by the mouths of <U+017F>uch Statues as were dedicated to the <U+017F>aid Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which Statues, for that rea<U+017F>on, had their mouths always open, and ready to <U+017F>peak;, or by the mouths of the Prie<U+017F>ts and Sibylls, who being <U+017F>eiz'd by a <U+017F>acred fury pronounced the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles with a certain impetuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of voice, and violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor<U+017F>ions of the countenance, not unlike tho<U+017F>e of di<U+017F>tracted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among us; or la<U+017F>tly, by the mouths even of brute bea<U+017F>ts, which the <U+017F>tupidity of tho<U+017F>e poor blinded people al<U+017F>o made u<U+017F>e of to that end. Thus the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> wor<U+017F>hipped and con<U+017F>ulted an Ox, under which figure they repre<U+017F>ented their God <hi>Apis,</hi> who<U+017F>e Oracles were accounted favourable, when he chearfully receiv'd the fodder pre<U+017F>ented to him, but it <U+017F>ignify'd the contrary, when he refu<U+017F>ed to open his mouth to receive it; and this was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted a pre<U+017F>ignification of the death of <hi>Germanicus.</hi> The <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedians</hi> ob<U+017F>erved the <U+017F>ame Ceremonies towards a Cow, big with Calf; the <hi>Nubians,</hi> a people of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> the <U+017F>ame towards a Dog, and the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> towards a Cock, the different accents of who<U+017F>e crowing di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd their Oracles. Among the<U+017F>e, the Oracles which <U+017F>ome went to hear in the va<U+017F>t de<U+017F>erts beyond the Country of the <hi>Garamantes,</hi> at the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> though they were the mo<U+017F>t venerable of any, as being the mo<U+017F>t ancient, were neverthele<U+017F>s as ridiculous as any of the re<U+017F>t, being grounded only on a <U+017F>imple motion of the body, a bowing of the head, a wink with the eye, which tho<U+017F>e that were pre<U+017F>ent imagin'd they had ob<U+017F>erved in the Statue of that Controller of the Gods, ador'd in that de<U+017F>olate place, with the head and horns of a Hee-goat. He was a little more familiar in the City of <hi>Dodona</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus,</hi> where he had al<U+017F>o a very magnificent Temple, taking the pains to pronounce his Oracles <U+017F>ometimes with his own divine mouth, and <U+017F>ometimes u<U+017F>ing tho<U+017F>e of two Virgins, whereof one, called <hi>Peri<U+017F>tera,</hi> which <U+017F>ignifies a Dove, gave occa<U+017F>ion to the Fable, wherein it was reported, that, in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> at <hi>Dodona,</hi> there were Doves that <U+017F>poke, as well as Oaks, which
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:66371:234"/>
an<U+017F>wer'd the que<U+017F>tions that had been put to them. The manner thus; tho<U+017F>e high Trees being <U+017F>haken by the ordinary Winds of tho<U+017F>e Countries made a great noi<U+017F>e there, which was encreas'd by that of a great number of Bra<U+017F>s-kettles fa<U+017F>ten'd to the branches of them, amid<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ound whereof tho<U+017F>e Oracles were deliver'd, that they might be receiv'd with greater reverence. But whereas the Art of Divination was by a <U+017F>pecial priviledge re<U+017F>erv'd to <hi>Apollo</hi> among all tho<U+017F>e Gods, his Oracles were accordingly look'd upon as the mo<U+017F>t certain. Thence it al<U+017F>o came, that he was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hipped, upon that account, in <U+017F>everal parts of the World, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the I<U+017F>land of <hi>Delos,</hi> one of the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> the place of his Birth, where there was an Altar built of horns taken from the right <U+017F>ide of the heads of <U+017F>everal Animals, neatly laid one upon the other with incomparable dexterity; the horns of the left <U+017F>ide being not it <U+017F>eems <U+017F>o proper for Divination. He there return'd his An<U+017F>wers under a humane <U+017F>hape, as in <hi>Lycia</hi> he did it under that of a Wolf: But in his Temple at <hi>Delphi,</hi> a place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for its <U+017F>cituation, as being in the mid<U+017F>t of the World, whence it was conceiv'd to be as it were the navel of it, he made his An<U+017F>wers <U+017F>ometimes through the throat of a Dragon, under which form he was there honoured, <U+017F>ometimes by the mouths of his Prie<U+017F>te<U+017F><U+017F>es, who, after they had been <U+017F>haken for a certain time by a violent wind, which i<U+017F><U+017F>u'd out of a deep and ob<U+017F>cure cave, whereby they felt them<U+017F>elves animated and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated into a more then natural motion, pronounc'd their Oracles, <U+017F>ometimes in Pro<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ometimes in Ver<U+017F>e, according to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of that Divinity whereby they were in<U+017F>pir'd. But to render the<U+017F>e yet more Maje<U+017F>tick, tho<U+017F>e Prie<U+017F>te<U+017F><U+017F>es affected certain preci<U+017F>e days, as for example tho<U+017F>e of the Calends and Ides, and requir'd certain particular di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions, that they might the more in<U+017F>olently impo<U+017F>e upon the more credulous: And the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in certain expiations and preparations, in order to their being more worthily <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of that divine in<U+017F>piration, which the <hi>Pythian</hi> Prie<U+017F>te<U+017F>s pretended her <U+017F>elf fit to entertain, after <U+017F>he had drunk of the Water of the fountain of <hi>Delos</hi>; as another, who <U+017F>erv'd the <U+017F>ame God at <hi>Colophon,</hi> imagin'd her <U+017F>elf worthy of it, when <U+017F>he had drunk of a neighbouring Spring, the Water whereof put her into an immediate fury. At <hi>Argos</hi> there was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of drinking the blood of a Lamb, and at <hi>Aegira,</hi> that of a Bull, ere the Oracles could be gotten out of them. But what mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covers their vanity, is, that even tho<U+017F>e who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ulted them (which they did only to comply with the weakne<U+017F>s of the people, and gain reputation among the <U+017F>imple) if they found them not favourable, either went on neverthele<U+017F>s in the pro<U+017F>ecution of their de<U+017F>igns, or forc'd them to pronounce <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>hould be to their advantage. This cour<U+017F>e was taken by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Great and <hi>Cleomenes</hi>; by the former, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ulted the <hi>Pythian</hi>; by the other, when he con<U+017F>ulted the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle, both which they forc'd to <U+017F>ay what they pleas'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves.
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:66371:234"/>
Thence it came, that mo<U+017F>t of the ancient Phil<U+017F>ophers exclaim'd again<U+017F>t them, and the Platoni<U+017F>ts, who made a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account of them then any of the other Sects, acknowledge, that they are no other then the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>picable Devils, and tho<U+017F>e of the lowe<U+017F>t rank, who engage them<U+017F>elves in that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which they mu<U+017F>t needs practi<U+017F>e in de<U+017F>ert and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful places, to the end there might be fewer witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of their weakne<U+017F>s and impo<U+017F>tures. The<U+017F>e are apparent in their very An<U+017F>wers, which, if not fal<U+017F>e, were <U+017F>o ambiguous, or at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>cure, that many times there needed another Oracle to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain them. Nor were they in vogue, but during the darkne<U+017F>s of Pagani<U+017F>m, which being di<U+017F>pell'd by the light of the Go<U+017F>pel, tho<U+017F>e Oracles never dur<U+017F>t appear in that glorious day, which would have di<U+017F>cover'd their lying and fal<U+017F>hood.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the Art of Divination being conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and grounded on experience, as well as <U+017F>everal others of that nature, it is not to be admir'd, that the An<U+017F>wers of tho<U+017F>e who heretofore made profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion thereof were not always true: and therefore it is as irrational a procedure to draw any con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thence to its prejudice, as to infer, that the Precepts of Medicine are fal<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e the Phy<U+017F>ician does not always make his Progno<U+017F>ticks aright. The General of an Army may <U+017F>ometimes proceed upon wrong grounds; and the expert Pilot may run upon tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>helves and rocks which he mo<U+017F>t endeavours to avoid. True it is that the <U+017F>ubtilty of the Devil, and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedne<U+017F>s of Mankind have foi<U+017F>ted abundance of abu<U+017F>es into the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of Oracles, e<U+017F>pecially in the erecting of tho<U+017F>e Statues to tho<U+017F>e fabulous Divinities, which they commonly made of Olive-tree, Lawrel, Vine, Cedar, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch kind of wood, full of unctuous moi<U+017F>ture, which they <U+017F>aid were the tears or <U+017F>weat of their fal<U+017F>e Gods; as al<U+017F>o in the pompous Ceremonies, wherewith they amu<U+017F>ed the credulous Vulgar. Such were tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Tropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> among the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who an<U+017F>wer'd only tho<U+017F>e who being clad in white de<U+017F>cended through a hole of the cave into his Temple, and there offered cakes to the Spirits which inhabited it; after which they were convey'd out at another place of the cave, where they drunk the Water of the Fountain of Memory, which caus'd them to remember whatever they had heard; as they had drunk that of <hi>Lethe</hi> before they had entred into it, which had caus'd them to forget all affairs of the World. But we are not hence to conclude, that all Oracles were fal<U+017F>e, nor doubt of the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of that <U+017F>ublime Art, upon its being di<U+017F>parag'd by tho<U+017F>e who have profe<U+017F>s'd it, <U+017F>ince it hath its grounds, not only in the inclination of mens minds, who having an extraordinary earne<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s to know things to come, there mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>ome Science for the attaining of that Knowledge; otherwi<U+017F>e Nature, who had imprinted that de<U+017F>ire in him, <U+017F>hould, contrary to her cu<U+017F>tom, have done <U+017F>omething in vain; but al<U+017F>o in the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of that Temperament which is <U+017F>ubject to Melancholy, or black
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:66371:235"/>
Choler. For, the former of the<U+017F>e is the Temperament of the more ingenious <U+017F>ort of people, according to the Phil<U+017F>opher in his Problems; and the other, being more re<U+017F>plendent, is that of per<U+017F>ons enclin'd to Divination, occa<U+017F>ion'd by the clear repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entation of the Species in that humour, which being bright and <U+017F>mooth as a Mirrour, cannot <U+017F>o well be di<U+017F>cover'd by tho<U+017F>e who are not of that Con<U+017F>titution; to which <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Memnon</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Prie<U+017F>te<U+017F><U+017F>e's pronouncing the Oracles in Hexameter Ver<U+017F>e, though <U+017F>he had never learnt Poe<U+017F>ie; and <hi>Pompanatius</hi> in his Books of Enchantments, affirms, that it caus'd a Woman, who never was out of <hi>Mantua,</hi> where <U+017F>he was born, to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>everal <U+017F>trange Languages.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That Divination being above the reach of our Under<U+017F>tanding, as much as this latter is below the Divinity, which hath re<U+017F>erv'd to it <U+017F>elf the priviledge of a di<U+017F>tinct knowledge of things to come, it is to no purpo<U+017F>e to <U+017F>eek for the true cau<U+017F>es of it in our <U+017F>elves, but we are to find them in the Heavens, whence, if we may believe the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of A<U+017F>trology, that quality of Divination or Prediction is communicated to Men by the interpo<U+017F>ition of the Intelligences, whereby tho<U+017F>e va<U+017F>t Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are moved, and that Science taught, by making it appear how great a corre<U+017F>pondence there is between the effects of the <U+017F>ublunary Bodies, and the <U+017F>uperior cau<U+017F>es on which they depend, and wherein they are potentially comprehended, even before they are actually exi<U+017F>tent. Whereto if you add the concour<U+017F>e of the Univer<U+017F>al Spirit, which equally animates the whole world, and the parts whereof it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts, and which meeting with convenient di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions in the minds of men, and the <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places where Oracles have been given, in<U+017F>pir'd tho<U+017F>e extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary motions, which have rais'd the Spirit of man, and open'd its way into effects the mo<U+017F>t at a di<U+017F>tance from his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Admitting, I <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>uch a concour<U+017F>e, there may <U+017F>ome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rea<U+017F>on be given of the<U+017F>e Predictions, not only of things, who<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es being natural and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, their effects are infallible, <U+017F>uch as are Eclip<U+017F>es, the Ri<U+017F>ing, Setting, and Regular Motions of the Planets; or of tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es are only probable, as it is reported that <hi>Pherecydes</hi> foretold a dreadful Earth-quake, by the boyling up of the water in his own Well; and <hi>Thales</hi> fore<U+017F>aw the <U+017F>carcity of Olives in the Territories of <hi>Athens:</hi> But al<U+017F>o of effects, which having only contingent or free cau<U+017F>es, lie not <U+017F>o obvious to di<U+017F>covery; and yet the<U+017F>e being denoted by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cau<U+017F>es, <U+017F>uch as are the Heavens and the Univer<U+017F>al Spirit, tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons who have clear-<U+017F>ighted and illuminated Souls may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them therein, even before they happen.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That there are three general cau<U+017F>es of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, one <hi>Supernatural</hi>; another, <hi>Artificial</hi>; and the third, <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>; and that, not to <U+017F>peak any thing of the Supernatural, whereof the Devils were the Authors, and made u<U+017F>e of it to continue <U+017F>till in their fir<U+017F>t Rebellion, when they attempted to
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:66371:235"/>
a<U+017F>cend into the Throne of God, and be like him; nor yet of their Artificial Cau<U+017F>e, which was certain per<U+017F>ons devoted to their wor<U+017F>hip, who retiring into Caves and Subterraneous places, were incited by tho<U+017F>e evil Spirits to that <U+017F>ordid Mini<U+017F>try, that <U+017F>o by that means they might lay <U+017F>nares for the <U+017F>imple, who were ea<U+017F>ily drawn away by the<U+017F>e fal<U+017F>e Lights. The Natural Cau<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e Oracles, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch as were pronounc'd out of the celebrated Caves and Grots of Antiquity, was a <U+017F>ubtile Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rais'd out of tho<U+017F>e places, which, fa<U+017F>tening on the Spirits of the Prophet or Prophete<U+017F>s already di<U+017F>pos'd to receive that impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion, had the <U+017F>ame Influence on them as the fumes of Wine have on tho<U+017F>e who drink it to exce<U+017F>s; whether that evaporation be caus'd by the quality of the Earth or Waters, or proceed from the Metals, Minerals, and other Fo<U+017F><U+017F>ile Bodies, contained within their entrails. For if it be acknowledg'd, that the waters pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through them, derive certain particular qualities, Why may not as well tho<U+017F>e vapours do the like, nay, haply in a greater mea<U+017F>ure, and, con<U+017F>equently, work tho<U+017F>e extraordinary effects? Nay, upon con<U+017F>ideration, they will not be found more miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than what is related of an Exhalation which i<U+017F><U+017F>ues out of a Cave near <hi>Hieropolis,</hi> which, as it is affirm'd, is fatal only to Men, and not to tho<U+017F>e who have not lo<U+017F>t their Virginity; nor yet than the water of a Fountain in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> which cau<U+017F>es Mares to run mad, as that which was in the Temple of <hi>Bacchus</hi> at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dros,</hi> had the ta<U+017F>te of Wine; that of <hi>Delphi</hi> lighted tho<U+017F>e Torches which were within a certain di<U+017F>tance of it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui<U+017F>h'd tho<U+017F>e which were thru<U+017F>t into it. Now <U+017F>uch qualities as the<U+017F>e are, depending on the properties of the places; it may be as ea<U+017F>ily conceiv'd, that tho<U+017F>e, where <U+017F>uch An<U+017F>wers of the fal<U+017F>e Gods were given, had the like: and thence it is to be imagin'd, that tho<U+017F>e having ceas'd by the ordinary vici<U+017F><U+017F>itude of all things, the <U+017F>aid Oracles accordingly receiv'd al<U+017F>o their period.</p>

enemies, as the former does friends; yet with this provi<U+017F>ion, that nothing contributed thereto from without, as for example, noi<U+017F>e might do, or <U+017F>ome other agitation of the air, <U+017F>tirr'd by <U+017F>ome external cau<U+017F>e, but the tingling mu<U+017F>t proceed from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; <hi><U+017F>onitu <U+017F>uopte tinniunt aures,</hi> without which condition it <U+017F>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies neither good nor bad luck, that is, nothing at all. And what <U+017F>eems <U+017F>omewhat to confirm this ob<U+017F>ervation, is, that it hath not been ca<U+017F>t out among all the other rubbi<U+017F>h of <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious Antiquity, but reigns even in the pre<U+017F>ent Age, wherein not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many among the Vulgar commonly <U+017F>ay, that they are well or ill-<U+017F>poken of, when their ears glow or tingle, but al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome of the better <U+017F>ort are al<U+017F>o of the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion. They ground this belief on the Sympathy or Antipathy there is between Friends and Enemies, which are <U+017F>uch, that not being confin'd by the di<U+017F>tance of places, which yet according to their opinion ought not to be too great, they force the <U+017F>pecies of voice and words towards the organs of Hearing, which are thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, through the communication of tho<U+017F>e Magnetick Vertues, and the<U+017F>e are not le<U+017F>s <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible then tho<U+017F>e which the objects direct towards the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>truments in ordinary <U+017F>en<U+017F>ation; though they be more delicate and <U+017F>ubtile. As the Lynx, the Eagle, and other <U+017F>harp-<U+017F>ighted Animals <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>pecies of vi<U+017F>ible objects far beyond their reach who are <U+017F>horter-<U+017F>ighted; and the Birds of prey <U+017F>mell carca<U+017F><U+017F>es though they are very far from them.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That it was a little too far fetcht, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute tho<U+017F>e Effects to Sympathy, which being as ab<U+017F>tru<U+017F>e as what <U+017F>ome pretend to deduce from it, amounts to as much, as if one would prove one ob<U+017F>cure thing by another which is yet more ob<U+017F>cure. As therefore there is no action done beyond the limits appointed to every Agent, which comprehend the <U+017F>phere of their activity, <U+017F>o can there not be any <U+017F>uch between the <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norous Species, and the Hearing of him who feels this Tingling, unle<U+017F>s it be within the reach of his ear; which <U+017F>ince it cannot be, when, for example, we are <U+017F>poken of in our ab<U+017F>ence, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible the Hearing <U+017F>hould receive the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the voice pronounc'd in a place at too great a di<U+017F>tance to be conveyd to it, ina<U+017F>much as it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in all <U+017F>en<U+017F>ation, that, be<U+017F>ides the good di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive Faculty and the Mean, there <U+017F>hould be a proportionate di<U+017F>tance between the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible object and the organ, ere it can judge well of it. So that tho<U+017F>e who imagine they hear what is <U+017F>aid of them afar off upon no other rea<U+017F>on then that their ears tingle, have not their Hearing more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly, but, on the contrary, wor<U+017F>e qualifi'd then others, through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turbance caus'd therein by gro<U+017F>s humours, which occa<U+017F>ion the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>order in the Ear as <U+017F>uffu<U+017F>ions do in the eye, when it <U+017F>ees the Objects in the <U+017F>ame colour and figure as the vapours or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, whereby it is clouded, though they be not effectually <U+017F>o. In like manner, the <U+017F>ound or noi<U+017F>e, heard by tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e ears tingle, though it makes them conceive the <U+017F>pecies of <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ound
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:66371:236"/>
proceeding from without, is only illu<U+017F>ory, and caus'd by the di<U+017F>order of the ill-affected organ, but it communicates its irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity to the Imagination, when it frames to it <U+017F>elf favourable con<U+017F>equences from <U+017F>uch a humming in the right Ear, and <U+017F>ome misfortune from the like in the left, there being not any rea<U+017F>on, by which <U+017F>o fanta<U+017F>tick and chimerical an opinion can be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That it is injuriou<U+017F>ly done to deny Man that advantage which we find by experience, that <U+017F>ome, not only brute Bea<U+017F>ts, but al<U+017F>o Plants have, to wit that of having a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious feeling of the good or evil which are to happen to them by a property be<U+017F>tow'd on them by Nature for their con<U+017F>ervation. Thus we find Rats for<U+017F>ake the hou<U+017F>e which will <U+017F>oon after fall down; Lice take leave of one that is dying; Birds of prey come from far di<U+017F>tant places to their food; the Swallow comes to give us a vi<U+017F>it in the Spring, and <U+017F>pends that delightful <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on with us; which once pa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he goes to find out other Springs in unknown Countries. The Ox gives us notice of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>hower, when, having lifted up his head very high, and breath'd withall, he immediately falls a licking his thighs; The Cat makes the <U+017F>ame Progno<U+017F>tication, when <U+017F>he combs her <U+017F>elf as it were, with her paws; The <U+017F>ame thing is done by the Water-fowl called the Ducker, and the ordinary, Drake, when they <U+017F>ettle their feathers with their beaks; The Frogs do the <U+017F>ame by their importunate croaking; The Ants, by the extraordinary earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s they expre<U+017F>s in hoarding up their corn; and the Earth-worms, when they appear above ground; Nay, the poor Trefoyl will clo<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elf upon the approach of a Tempe<U+017F>t, as do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o mo<U+017F>t Plants in foul weather; which being over, they <U+017F>pread abroad their leaves and flowers, and <U+017F>eem newly blown, as it were to congratulate the return of the Sun, as is done, among others, by the Marigold, which for that rea<U+017F>on is called <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropium</hi>; for the great corre<U+017F>pondence there is between it and that all-enlivening Star. Nay, that corre<U+017F>pondence is al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o remarkably obvious in the other Plants, that tho<U+017F>e who have ob<U+017F>erv'd them mo<U+017F>t exactly, affirm, that there is not any herb <U+017F>o de<U+017F>picable, but it hath an interiour character, an<U+017F>werable to that of <U+017F>ome Star, which communicates its vertues and qualities to it, and thence it comes to be called a terre<U+017F>trial Star. Why therefore <U+017F>hould it come into di<U+017F>pute, whether Man hath <U+017F>uch a Priviledge, as that he may be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of what is prejudicial or advantageous to him, by that tingling of the Ear, which may well be the <U+017F>ign thereof though the cau<U+017F>e be not ab<U+017F>olutely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t? For, experience it <U+017F>elf and the effects con<U+017F>equent to the ob<U+017F>ervation do very much confirm it, for tho<U+017F>e being commonly an<U+017F>werable to what had been conceiv'd by tho<U+017F>e to whom that kind of Divination by the Ears had happened, there is as much ground to give it <U+017F>ome credit, as there is to deduce any thing from <U+017F>ome other le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>iderable accidents, from which the like
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:66371:237"/>
conjectures are made; <U+017F>uch as are, for example, among others, the twinkling of the Eyes, <U+017F>neezing, the meeting of <U+017F>omething extraordinary, e<U+017F>pecially a Negro, an Eunuch, or <U+017F>ome other defective per<U+017F>on; and the <U+017F>triking of ones feet again<U+017F>t the thre<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old of his own door, which prov'd fatal to <hi>C. Gracchus,</hi> who was murther'd the very day that <U+017F>uch an accident had happened to him; as al<U+017F>o to <hi>Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> the day he was defeated by the <hi>Parthians.</hi> In all which <U+017F>igns there is much le<U+017F>s likelihood of declaring the accidents, which <U+017F>ome would attribute thereto, than may be imagin'd in the Tingling of the Ear, as being the <U+017F>eat of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which the Ancients for that rea<U+017F>on were wont to <U+017F>tir up, by plucking the tip of it; and if it be true what <hi>Plato</hi> <U+017F>aith, that all our Knowledge is but Remini<U+017F>cence, and that we only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Species of things, which had been before in our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding, it will be no hard matter to find out <U+017F>ome ground for this prae<U+017F>en<U+017F>ion.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That there was no other conjecture to be drawn from this Tingling of the Ear, than that the Per<U+017F>on <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereto, hath a weak and ill-di<U+017F>pos'd Brain, which breeding abundance of ill humours, if they come to make any <U+017F>toppage in the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the Ear, its action is vitiated and ob<U+017F>tructed by that Tingling, which is a <U+017F>ymptom of a deprav'd Hearing, and cau<U+017F>es the party to hear an importunate <U+017F>ound or noi<U+017F>e, though there be not any made without, and that there be not any application of the hollowne<U+017F>s of the hand to the Ear, in which ca<U+017F>e it hears <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch noi<U+017F>e. 'Twould therefore be ridiculous to look after any other cau<U+017F>es thereof than what may be in the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the Brain, and the excrements it produceth, on the diver<U+017F>ity whereof as al<U+017F>o on that of their Motion in the Ears, that Tingling depends; as do al<U+017F>o the Breathing, the Ringing, the Buzzing, and the Swimming of the Ear, which are Symptoms of a deprav'd Hearing; the breathing or blowing being done by a little bla<U+017F>t which gets out gently; the Tingling by the interruption of its motion; the ringing proceeds from a more gro<U+017F>s vapour, and <U+017F>uch as blows more <U+017F>trongly; as the re<U+017F>ounding does from an impul<U+017F>ion yet more vehement; and la<U+017F>tly, the Swimming is caus'd by the agitation of the<U+017F>e as well vaporous as <U+017F>pirituous matters, which being different and differently moved, produce tho<U+017F>e different <U+017F>ounds. And therefore it is ab<U+017F>urd, to derive any other marks of what <U+017F>hould happen to us, then tho<U+017F>e laid down in Medicine, which teaches us, that they who are <U+017F>ubject to the<U+017F>e frequent tinglings and ringings of the Ears are in their way to Deafne<U+017F>s, by rea<U+017F>on of the danger there is, that the<U+017F>e vaporous humours <U+017F>hould make <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong an ob<U+017F>truction in the organs of Hearing, that the auditory air cannot get into it, to make <U+017F>en<U+017F>ation: and if this happen in a burning Feaver, together with dimne<U+017F>s of the eyes, it is a certain pre<U+017F>age of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>traction or madne<U+017F>s, which ordinarily follows that noi<U+017F>e of the Ear.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXIX. Of Philtres, and whether there be any proper Remedies for the procuring of Love.</head>
            <p>THere is not any thing <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant and delightful as to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd; To procure that, it is requi<U+017F>ite there <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ome perfection, which being conceiv'd <U+017F>uch by the per<U+017F>on who<U+017F>e favour is courted, it prevails <U+017F>o far upon his Inclinations, that he cannot forbear being in Love with it. Thus is it that a known Truth doth <U+017F>o fully <U+017F>atisfie our Under<U+017F>tanding, that it cannot deny its con<U+017F>ent thereto: Thus is the Will <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly engag'd upon the pur<U+017F>uance of a Good which <U+017F>eems delightful to her, that it is hardly in her power to gain-<U+017F>ay it; nay, <U+017F>he is of her <U+017F>elf inclin'd thereto, not needing any other Charms to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her thereto, than tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he meets with in the goodne<U+017F>s of the Object which <U+017F>he loves. The<U+017F>e are real Philtres which never fail to rai<U+017F>e Love in tho<U+017F>e that have them; there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of looking after other Remedies, all which are us'd either to a bad end, or to none at all. <hi>Deianira,</hi> de<U+017F>irous to make u<U+017F>e of them, in order to her being better belov'd by her Hu<U+017F>band <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> prov'd the occa<U+017F>ion of his death, by the means of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent him dy'd with the Blood of the Centaur <hi>Ne<U+017F><U+017F>us.</hi> Another Woman, as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> affirms in his greater work of Ethicks, brought her Hu<U+017F>band to the <U+017F>ame Fate, after <U+017F>he had made him take a Medicine of that kind. <hi>Lucilia</hi> admini<U+017F>tring <U+017F>uch a Philtre to the Poët <hi>Lucretius</hi> her Hu<U+017F>band, put him into <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>traction that he kill'd him<U+017F>elf. The like was done by the Emperour <hi>Lucilius,</hi> after he had taken <U+017F>uch a one from the hands of <hi>Calli<U+017F>thenes</hi>; as al<U+017F>o by <hi>Caligula,</hi> after he had drunk off one of the<U+017F>e potions into which there had been put a piece of that fle<U+017F>h which is found on the fore-heads of young Colts as <U+017F>oon as they are ca<U+017F>t, called in Latine <hi>Hippomanes,</hi> an ingredient par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly recommended among the<U+017F>e Medicaments. In which Receipts, we find al<U+017F>o the brains of Cows when they would go to Bull, and tho<U+017F>e of young A<U+017F><U+017F>es, the bones of a green Frog, the little Fi<U+017F>h called the <hi>Remora,</hi> the Matrix of the <hi>Hyaena,</hi> and the little Bird call'd <hi>Motacilla,</hi> the Wagtail, from its continual wagging of the tail, which it <U+017F>eems is <U+017F>o effectual a Remedy for the procuring of Love, that <hi>Pindar,</hi> in his fourth Ode of the <hi>Nemaea,</hi> acknowledges that his Heart was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly drawn away and charm'd by the means thereof, that he could not forbear Loving.

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:66371:238"/>
they are belov'd. For tho<U+017F>e to whom they are given common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not knowing, nay, many times having an aver<U+017F>ion for the others, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that the<U+017F>e Philtres <U+017F>hould be able to force People's Wills and Inclinations, which are always free to love what they know not; or if they know it, have a horrour and aver<U+017F>ion for it. Otherwi<U+017F>e it would amount to as much, as to give them a certain Sovereignty over a free power; <U+017F>uch as the Will is, which it cannot endure, as being above all Corporeal Agents, <U+017F>uch as the<U+017F>e Medicaments are. Among which, as there are <U+017F>ome have the vertue of extingui<U+017F>hing the flames of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi<U+017F>cence and Carnal Love, by correcting the heat of the Blood, dimini<U+017F>hing the quantity of the Seed, and di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ing the Spirits whereby it is rai<U+017F>ed; <U+017F>o on the contrary, there are others, which as it were awake and excite that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, by the production they make of abundance of good and <U+017F>pirituous <U+017F>eed, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently, may indeed invite tho<U+017F>e who u<U+017F>e them, to that ba<U+017F>e and unbridled Love, but not to a mutual Love, <U+017F>uch as is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly directed to him, who finding his affection <U+017F>leighted, is forc'd to give the<U+017F>e Remedies that he may be belov'd by the per<U+017F>on whom he courts.</p>

            <p>IT is a Truth not que<U+017F>tion'd by any of the Philo<U+017F>ophers, what Sect <U+017F>oever they were of, that there mu<U+017F>t be certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whereof Natural Bodies con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t. Their Generation and Corruption confirm it; <U+017F>ince that according to the former, there being not any thing made of nothing; and according to the latter, it being not imaginable that any thing can be reduc'd to nothing, there mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ome fir<U+017F>t Principles, from which, primarily, and of them<U+017F>elves natural things do proceed, and whereto they are at la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olv'd. But it hath not yet been fully decided, to what this prerogative is to be granted. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> would be<U+017F>tow it on Fire; <hi>Anaximenes</hi> on the Air; <hi>Pherecydes,</hi> to the Earth; <hi>Thales,</hi> on the Water; <hi>Xenophanes,</hi> on the two latter, joyntly; <hi>Hippon,</hi> on Fire and Water; <hi>Parmenides</hi> on Fire and Earth; <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and mo<U+017F>t of the other Naturali<U+017F>ts, on tho<U+017F>e four Elements toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which yet, as <U+017F>ome affirmed, could not execute the function of Principles without the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of other Superiours, <U+017F>uch as <hi>He<U+017F>iod</hi> maintains to be Chaos and Love; <hi>Antiphanes,</hi> Silence and Voice; the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> Light and Darkne<U+017F>s; the <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> Numbers, and among others the Tetrad, which the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> affirm to be the <U+017F>ource of all things; the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks</hi> Matter, Form, and Privation; <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Parts; and <hi>Democritus,</hi> his Atoms, <U+017F>o called by rea<U+017F>on of their <U+017F>malne<U+017F>s, which renders them invi<U+017F>ible, and incapable of being di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd and divided into other le<U+017F><U+017F>er Particles, though they have quantity, and are of <U+017F>o great a bulk as to be thereby di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd from a Mathematical Point, which hath not any; as being defin'd to be what hath not any part, and what is <U+017F>o im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible and <U+017F>mall, that it can hardly fall under our External Sen<U+017F>es, but is only perceivable by rea<U+017F>on.

But his main work is to maintain, that they not the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>eeds and immediate Principles thereof, as con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting them<U+017F>elves of Atoms or little Bodies <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtile and <U+017F>mall, that they cannot be broken or made

le<U+017F>s, and being the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>imple and next pieces, whereof mixt bodies are made up, and whereto they are afterwards reducible by di<U+017F><U+017F>olution, there is <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to give them the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fir<U+017F>t material and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible principles of natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That if the<U+017F>e Atoms be allow'd to be the principles of natural bodies, the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t will be ab<U+017F>olutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, as being made, up of infinite principles, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incapable of falling under our knowledge, it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for us to come to that of the mixt bodies which are to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of them. Whence it will follow, that though the Atoms <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uch as the Philo<U+017F>ophers would per<U+017F>wade us they are, yet would not our Under<U+017F>tanding, which cannot comprehend any thing but what is finite, be ever the more <U+017F>atisfy'd, <U+017F>ince it would not be able to conceive them, nor con<U+017F>equently the things which <U+017F>hould be produc'd of them. Nor is it to be imagin'd that tho<U+017F>e things would differ among them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>ince that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <U+017F>entiment, tho<U+017F>e little chimerical bodies are not any way di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd, but all of the like nature, and of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That though there be not any e<U+017F><U+017F>ential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Atoms, yet is it certain, That they make remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diver<U+017F>ity in the production of things, by the properties and different qualities that are in each of them, whereof there are two kinds, <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Proper.</hi> The proper are, Largene<U+017F>s of Bulk, Figure, Motion, and Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; the common are, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e, Connexion, Situation, and Order, which are generally competible to all Atoms, as the four others are proper and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to them. Their bulk is not to be con<U+017F>ider'd as if they had any con<U+017F>iderable quantity; there being no Atom, how great <U+017F>oever it may be, but is infinitely le<U+017F>s then the lea<U+017F>t body in the World, being for that rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>o imperceptible, that it is impo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible for the <U+017F>ight to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h it. Yet does not that hinder but that they are bodies, and con<U+017F>equently have quantity, which is a property in<U+017F>eparable from bodies; as Mites, Hand-worms, and <U+017F>uch other little Animals, which by their extreme litlene<U+017F>s elude our <U+017F>ight, do neverthele<U+017F>s con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of diver<U+017F>e parts, miraculou<U+017F>ly di<U+017F>coverable by Magnifying-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, nay to the ob<U+017F>ervance of Veins, Arteries, Nerves, and <U+017F>uch like ob<U+017F>cure parts, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to tho<U+017F>e which rea<U+017F>on obliges us to admit, though our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es cannot attain thereto. It being the property of figure to follow quantity, which it determinates and qualifies, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that if the atoms are different as to bulk, they <U+017F>hould be the <U+017F>ame al<U+017F>o as to figure: which being ob<U+017F>ervable when bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are broken into great pieces, and tho<U+017F>e appearing with <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, angles, and points diver<U+017F>ly figur'd, they mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <U+017F>ome figure even after they are pounded in a mortar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <U+017F>mall parcels and particles, though our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es by rea<U+017F>on of their weakne<U+017F>s, are not able to comprehend it. To the <U+017F>ame
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:66371:240"/>
weakne<U+017F>s it is to be attributed, that we are not able to di<U+017F>cern the diver<U+017F>ity of figures in grains of corn and other <U+017F>eeds, which <U+017F>eem to be in a manner alike, though they are not <U+017F>uch, no more than the leaves of Trees and Plants. Nay even in Drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Eggs, though in appearance there is a likene<U+017F>s <U+017F>o great, that it is come into a Proverb; yet is there <U+017F>o remarkable a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ity, when it is <U+017F>trictly ob<U+017F>erv'd, that there were heretofore in the I<U+017F>land of <hi>Delos</hi> certain people <U+017F>o expert, that, among <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Eggs, they would tell which had been laid by <U+017F>uch or <U+017F>uch a Hen. The hair of our heads (a thing, to <U+017F>ome would <U+017F>eem incredible) have particular figures whereby they are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd one from another. The figures of Atoms are of that rank, as are al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e of the Moats which are <U+017F>een playing and dancing up and down in the beams of the Sun, when darted in at a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row pa<U+017F><U+017F>age: for though they <U+017F>eem to be all round, yet exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd with that in<U+017F>trument which magnifies the <U+017F>pecies of things, we find in them an infinite number of other figures. In like manner is it requi<U+017F>ite, that the Atoms <U+017F>hould have the <U+017F>ame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of figures, that they may the more fitly concur to the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and generation of Bodies. To that end, the maintainers of this opinion affirm, that <U+017F>ome are round, <U+017F>ome oval, <U+017F>ome oblong, <U+017F>ome pointed, <U+017F>ome forked, <U+017F>ome concave, <U+017F>ome convex, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mooth and even, <U+017F>ome rough and rugged, and of other <U+017F>uch like figures, as well regular as irregular, in order to the diver<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their motions. Of the<U+017F>e there are three kinds a<U+017F><U+017F>igned; according to the fir<U+017F>t, the Atom moves downwards by its own weight; according to the <U+017F>econd, it moves upwards; and according to the third, it moves indirectly and from one <U+017F>ide to another. The<U+017F>e two la<U+017F>t are violent motions, but the fir<U+017F>t is natural to the Atom; to which <hi>Epicurus</hi> attributes a perpetual motion, which cau<U+017F>ing it to move ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly towards the lowe<U+017F>t place, it <U+017F>till makes that way of its own nature, till <U+017F>uch time as in its progre<U+017F>s it hath met with other Atoms, which coming to <U+017F>trike again<U+017F>t it, if they are the <U+017F>tronger, they force it upwards, or of one <U+017F>ide, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the part of it which had receiv'd the <U+017F>hock; and <U+017F>o clinging one to another, they make <U+017F>everal mixtures, as, when they come to <U+017F>eparate after their union, they are the cau<U+017F>es of the corruption of mixt bodies. And the<U+017F>e bodies have <U+017F>o much the more Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, which is the la<U+017F>t property of the<U+017F>e Atoms, the more den<U+017F>e and <U+017F>olid the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t are; as on the contrary, when they are le<U+017F>s den<U+017F>e and <U+017F>olid, by rea<U+017F>on of the vacuity there is between their parts, the bodies con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of them have <U+017F>o much the le<U+017F>s vigour and force to oppo<U+017F>e external injuries.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That there is not any better in<U+017F>tance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the nature of Atoms can be explicated then tho<U+017F>e little Motes, which move up and down the air of a Chamber, when the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams come into it at <U+017F>ome little hole or cranny. For from this very in<U+017F>tance, which is <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, it may ea<U+017F>ily be concluded, not only that they are bodies, which have a certain bulk and
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:66371:240"/>
quantity, how little and indivi<U+017F>ible <U+017F>oever it may be, but al<U+017F>o that they are in continual motion, by means whereof, as tho<U+017F>e little <hi>corpu<U+017F>cula,</hi> or Motes, ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly move and <U+017F>trike one again<U+017F>t another, and are confu<U+017F>edly intermixt one among another; <U+017F>o the Atoms, by their perpetual agitation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e, cau<U+017F>e the mixtures and generations of all natural things. So that, all con<U+017F>ider'd, it is as ridiculous on the other <U+017F>ide to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they are only imaginary principles, becau<U+017F>e they are not <U+017F>een, as to maintain, that tho<U+017F>e little Motes are not in the air, becau<U+017F>e they are not perceiv'd to be there in the ab<U+017F>ence of the Sun-beams, which we mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s renders them vi<U+017F>ible, but with this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, that they are neverthele<U+017F>s there, even when they are not di<U+017F>cern'd to be there.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That it is certain, there are abundance of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in Nature, which are in a manner imperceptible to our <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, and yet mu<U+017F>t be granted to be real bodies, and con<U+017F>equently endow'd with length, breadth, profundity, <U+017F>olidity, and the other corporeal qualities. Such as the<U+017F>e are, among others, the <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible Species, which continually i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of the Objects, and are not perceiv'd by the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, but only <U+017F>o far as they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and material, e<U+017F>pecially the Odours, exhaling from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bodies, which after their departure thence, in proce<U+017F>s of time, decay and wither. Of this we have in<U+017F>tance in Apples, and other Fruits, which grow wrinkled, proportionably to their being drain'd of tho<U+017F>e vaporous Atoms, (whereof they were at fir<U+017F>t full) which evaporate in a le<U+017F><U+017F>er or greater <U+017F>pace of time, the more clo<U+017F>ely tho<U+017F>e little bodies <U+017F>tick one to another, or the more weakly they are joyned together. Nay, the intentional Species, how <U+017F>ublimated <U+017F>oever they be, by the defaecation made by the agent Intellect, are neverthele<U+017F>s bodies, as are al<U+017F>o the Animal Spirits, which are charged therewith, and the vital and natural, whereby the former are cheri<U+017F>h'd. In like manner, Light, the beams of the Sun and of other Stars, their Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their Magnetick Vertues, and other <U+017F>uch Qualities, ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in an infinite number of things, between which there is a mutual inclination and corre<U+017F>pondence, or antipathy, cannot be imagin'd to act otherwi<U+017F>e then by the emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of certain little bodies; which being <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall and <U+017F>ubtile that they are incapable of further divi<U+017F>ion, may with good rea<U+017F>on be called the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and material Principles of all Bodies, <U+017F>ince there is not any one but con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of them.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That the concour<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Atoms being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, if we may credit <hi>Epicurus,</hi> we cannot attribute thereto the cau<U+017F>es of the generations happening in this World; ina<U+017F>much as an accidental cau<U+017F>e not being able to produce a regular effect, <U+017F>uch as is that of Nature in Generation, it is ridiculous to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it rather to the<U+017F>e Atoms, than to <U+017F>ome other cau<U+017F>e, which is <U+017F>uch <hi>per <U+017F>e,</hi> and always regular in its operations, <U+017F>uch as

is Nature her <U+017F>elf. But what further di<U+017F>covers the ab<U+017F>urdity of that opinion is this, that it thinks it not enough to refer the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ity of the other effects, which are ob<U+017F>erv'd in all natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to that of the Atoms, whereof they con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t; but pretends al<U+017F>o by their means, to give an account of that of our Spirits, which tho<U+017F>e Philo<U+017F>ophers would repre<U+017F>ent unto us made of tho<U+017F>e orbicular atoms, and accordingly ea<U+017F>ily mov'd by rea<U+017F>on of that round figure, and that tho<U+017F>e in whom it is mo<U+017F>t exact, are the mo<U+017F>t ingenious and inventive per<U+017F>ons, as others are dull and blocki<U+017F>h, becau<U+017F>e their Spirits have a le<U+017F><U+017F>er portion of tho<U+017F>e cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Atoms. But this <U+017F>peculation may be ranked among pure chimaera's, <U+017F>ince that the functions of our Under<U+017F>tanding, being ab<U+017F>olutely <U+017F>piritual and immaterial, have no dependence on the different con<U+017F>titutions of tho<U+017F>e little imaginary bodies; nay though there were any corre<U+017F>pondence between them and the actions of our minds, their round figure would not be <U+017F>o much the cau<U+017F>e of our vivacity, as might be the pointed or forked; as being more likely to penetrate into, and comprehend the mo<U+017F>t difficult things than the circular, which would only pa<U+017F>s over them, without any fixt fa<U+017F>tning on them.</p>

And yet the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t, notwith<U+017F>tanding that di<U+017F>tance, are extremely troubled therewith, nay <U+017F>ometimes to <U+017F>uch exce<U+017F>s, that, if we may credit <hi>Johannes Langius</hi> in the fir<U+017F>t Book of his <hi>Medicinal Epi<U+017F>tles,</hi> a Woman at <hi>Florence</hi> had the Evil in one of her Thighs, which being got out weigh'd <U+017F>ixty pound; and a Gold<U+017F>mith of <hi>Amberg</hi> had another of the <U+017F>ame bigne<U+017F>s in a manner, neer his Knee.

abundance of the<U+017F>e Evils, whereof the Glandules of the <hi>Me<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium</hi> and the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> which is the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable of any about Man's Body, are full, and which are commonly produc'd by Phlegm, the coldne<U+017F>s and vi<U+017F>co<U+017F>ity whereof do indeed contribute to their rebellion; but it is very much augmented by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and common Cau<U+017F>es, <U+017F>uch as are Air, Aliment, and Waters infected with <U+017F>ome malignant qualities, which render it Endemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and peculiar to certain Nations; as for in<U+017F>tance, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, e<U+017F>pecially the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are more infected with this foul di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e than any others, which is al<U+017F>o communicated by <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as mo<U+017F>t of the other di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, which become hereditary by means of the Spirits, employ'd by the Formative Faculty in Generation, and carrying along with them the Character of the parts and humours of him who engenders, and imprinting them on the <hi>foetus.</hi> Hence it comes that for the curing of it, there is more requir'd than to admini<U+017F>ter the remedies commonly us'd in the cure of other tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which mu<U+017F>t be di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd or <U+017F>oftened, that <U+017F>o they may be brought to <U+017F>uppuration, unle<U+017F>s they can be con<U+017F>um'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated; but in this there mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ome particular means u<U+017F>ed. And, not to mention that which is generally known to all, to wit, the touching of tho<U+017F>e who have this Evil by the King of <hi>France,</hi> and his Maje<U+017F>ty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> whom they heal by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous vertue, and a <U+017F>pecial priviledge granted tho<U+017F>e two great Monarchs by God him<U+017F>elf; it is commonly affirmed, that the <U+017F>eventh Male-child, without any interruption of Females, hath the <U+017F>ame advantage of healing this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, by a favour which Theology calls <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> and whereof many affirm, that they have <U+017F>een the effects. The<U+017F>e are attributed to the vertue of the Number <hi>Seven,</hi> <U+017F>o highly e<U+017F>teem'd by the <hi>Platoni<U+017F>ts,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of the fir<U+017F>t odd Number, and the fir<U+017F>t even and <U+017F>quare num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which are <hi>Three</hi> and <hi>Four,</hi> and are by them called the Male and Female, whereof they make <U+017F>uch account, that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Opinion of the<U+017F>e Philo<U+017F>ophers, the Soul of the world was made up of tho<U+017F>e two Numbers; and it is by their means that whatever is comprehended in it <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts. It is al<U+017F>o for this Rea<U+017F>on, that Children born in the <U+017F>eventh month, live as tho<U+017F>e born in the ninth; whereas <U+017F>uch as are born in the eighth die. To this may be added, That the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable Changes of Man's Life happen in the<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal Septenaries, which number does not only contribute to his Conception, which is not perfect till the <U+017F>eventh day, after the Matter hath receiv'd the Virile Sperme, and to his Birth in the <U+017F>eventh month; but al<U+017F>o to all the other accidents which happen to him in all the <U+017F>everal Septe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. For the Child begins to have <U+017F>ome appearance of Teeth in the <U+017F>eventh month; at twice <U+017F>even months he makes a <U+017F>hift to <U+017F>tand alone; at three times <U+017F>even his Tongue is <U+017F>o far loos'd, that he <U+017F>peaks with <U+017F>ome Articulation; at four times <U+017F>even he goes <U+017F>teadily and confidently; at the age of <U+017F>even years he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:66371:242"/>
new forces, and renews his Teeth; at twice <U+017F>even he is of ripe age, and capable of engendring; at three times <U+017F>even he gives over growing, but becomes <U+017F>till more and more vigorous, till he hath attain'd to <U+017F>even times <U+017F>even, that is, to the forty and ninth year of his age, by <U+017F>ome called the little climacterical year, as being the mo<U+017F>t compleat of any, in regard it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of a perfect number multiply'd by it <U+017F>elf, and in which there always happens <U+017F>ome accident proceeding hence, that Nature being not able to forbear the doing of <U+017F>omething, when <U+017F>he hath attain'd that <U+017F>overeign degree of perfection, is forc'd to decline. It is therefore to be attributed to this compleat number, (which is called by the <hi>Greeks</hi> by a term which <U+017F>ignifies Venerable) that the <U+017F>eventh Son cures the Evil, the cau<U+017F>e whereof being malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and, indeed, having <U+017F>omething in it that is ob<U+017F>cure, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls Divine; it is not to be admired, that the curing of it <U+017F>hould depend on a Cau<U+017F>e equally ob<U+017F>cure, and at <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>tance from our knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That without having any recour<U+017F>e to <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>tracted a Cau<U+017F>e, as that of the vertue of the number Seven, which, being a di<U+017F>crete quantity, is incapable of action, which is re<U+017F>erv'd to <U+017F>uch qualities only as are active; Nor yet to the Stars, which are at a greater di<U+017F>tance from us; Nor yet to the force of the Imagination, which many think may produce that effect: Waving all recour<U+017F>e to the<U+017F>e, I am of Opinion, that it is rather to be referr'd to the Formative Faculty, which producing a Male when the Seeds of the Parents are <U+017F>o di<U+017F>pos'd, as that what is more vigorous and <U+017F>trong hath a predominancy over the other which is le<U+017F>s <U+017F>uch, that is, when it continues <U+017F>till in the getting of a Male without any interruption to the <U+017F>eventh time, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of it is, that the<U+017F>e Seeds are <U+017F>till <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong and <U+017F>pirituous, that a Male is gotten in<U+017F>tead of a Female, which is the production of tho<U+017F>e Seeds that are weaker and colder than the Ma<U+017F>culine. Now the heat and <U+017F>pirits whereby Males are procreated, may communicate to them <U+017F>ome particular vertue, <U+017F>uch as may be the Gift of healing the Evil; which may be affirm'd with as good ground, as that the <U+017F>pittle of a Man fa<U+017F>ting being well-temper'd, kills Serpents; and that it is held, many have heretofore had <U+017F>uch a prerogative for the healing of certain di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, by <U+017F>ome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular qualities, depending either on tho<U+017F>e of their Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or of their whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. Thus <hi>Ve<U+017F>pa<U+017F>ian,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirms in the fourth Book of his Hi<U+017F>tories, re<U+017F>tor'd his <U+017F>ight to a blind Man. <hi>Adrian,</hi> as <hi>Aelius Spartianus</hi> relates, healed a Man born blind only by touching him. And <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> King of the <hi>Epirotae,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Life, heal'd all that were troubled with the Spleen in his time, by touching their Spleen with the great Toe of his right Foot; of which Toe there was a far greater Opinion conceiv'd after his death, in that it was found intire, and not con<U+017F>um'd by the fire, as all the re<U+017F>t of his Body was. This vertue of healing thus after an extraordinary manner,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:66371:242"/>
hath been deriv'd into <U+017F>ome whole Families. There are to this day many in <hi>France,</hi> who affirm them<U+017F>elves to be of the Family of Saint <hi>Hubert,</hi> and have the gift of healing <U+017F>uch as are bitten by mad Dogs. In <hi>Italy</hi> there are others, who make it their boa<U+017F>t that they are of the Families of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>: whereof the former are not afraid of Serpents, which, for that rea<U+017F>on, they bear in their Coat; no more than the<U+017F>e latter are of burning coals, which they handle without burning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves. In <hi>Spain</hi> al<U+017F>o, the Families of the <hi>Saludatores</hi> and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>almadores,</hi> have the gift of healing many incurable di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es only by the Touch. Nay, if we may rely on common Tradition, we have this further to add, that it holds for certain, that tho<U+017F>e Children who come into the world on Good-Friday have the gift of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, e<U+017F>pecially Tertian and Quartan Agues.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That if the gift of healing the Evil depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the vigour of the Principles of Generation, which meet in the <U+017F>eventh Male-child, it would follow that the eighth or ninth coming into the world con<U+017F>ecutively, <U+017F>hould more ju<U+017F>tly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that priviledge; ina<U+017F>much as the generative faculty di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers a greater vertue and vigour in that production of a ninth Male-child without interruption, then it might do in that of a <U+017F>eventh. Which being not found true, it were ab<U+017F>urd to look for the Cau<U+017F>es of it in Nature, who<U+017F>e forces are not able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Effect <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>cendent, and <U+017F>o much above her reach. It mu<U+017F>t therefore be a <U+017F>upernatural gift, which God be<U+017F>tows on certain per<U+017F>ons, out of a pure gratuitous favour, and more for the ea<U+017F>e and comfort of others, than out of any advantage to tho<U+017F>e who receive it; as are al<U+017F>o the gifts of Prophecy and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles. For it is a demon<U+017F>tration of God's Omnipotence, not to heal di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es only by ordinary means, the di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation whereof he hath left to Phy<U+017F>icians, who to that end make u<U+017F>e of natural remedies, but to do the <U+017F>ame thing without any a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of Nature by extraordinary and <U+017F>upernatural means, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication whereof, he <U+017F>ometimes u<U+017F>es the Mini<U+017F>tery of Angels, as in the curing of <hi>Tobit,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ick people who came to the Pool at <hi>Jeru<U+017F>alem,</hi> after the water had been <U+017F>tirr'd by the Angel; <U+017F>ometimes by the Saints, of whom it is written, that the very <U+017F>hadow of their Bodies hath many times been effectual to that purpo<U+017F>e, as was that of Saint <hi>Peter</hi>; and oftentimes tho<U+017F>e of other per<U+017F>ons, to whom he had communicated the gift for rea<U+017F>ons unknown to us; as he granted that of Divination to the Sibyls, though they liv'd in Idolatry.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That Man was, potentially, all things; and that con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of a Body exactly temperate, and of <U+017F>uch a Soul as is the mo<U+017F>t perfect of forms, he comprehended in an eminent degree within him<U+017F>elf all the vertues of things as well corporeal as animate. Whence comes it then, that he <U+017F>hall not have the vertues and properties which are ob<U+017F>ervable not only in <U+017F>tones,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:66371:243"/>
wherewith he participates Being, but al<U+017F>o in Plants which are capable of Vegetation as well as he; Animals, with whom he hath motion, <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and life; and la<U+017F>tly, in the <U+017F>eparated Spirits, as having, an<U+017F>werably to them, certain powers that are <U+017F>piritual and remov'd from materiality? And <U+017F>o, <U+017F>ince the Vertue of healing Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es is found in mo<U+017F>t Beings, which are of <U+017F>ome nature with Man, it is but rea<U+017F>onable he al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hould have the <U+017F>ame one, <U+017F>uch as is the gift of healing the Evil, which happens principally in the Seventh Male-child, by rea<U+017F>on of the perfection of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which performs all the mo<U+017F>t compleat functions in that number, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> upon that occa<U+017F>ion affirms to be the di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>er of life. Nay if there have been <U+017F>ome who have had the Vertue of communicating <U+017F>everal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, by their <U+017F>ight and touching, as it is related of the <hi>P<U+017F>ylli, Tribales, Illyrians,</hi> and other Nations, who bewitch'd tho<U+017F>e whom they touch'd; and of him, whom <hi>Philo<U+017F>tratus</hi> makes mention of in the life of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius,</hi> who kill'd with his very a<U+017F>pect, as the Ba<U+017F>ili<U+017F>k does; far greater rea<U+017F>on is there that there <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ome to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate health. For though this latter, requiring more prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conditions, is <U+017F>o much the more difficultly transferr'd from one Subject to another then <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s is, yet the rea<U+017F>on of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries will have it <U+017F>o, that if the one is, the other may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and that with the greater ju<U+017F>tice, ina<U+017F>much as health, participating of the nature of good, ought to be more communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative from one <U+017F>ubject to another then <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s.</p>

But this is not only ab<U+017F>urd in it <U+017F>elf, but al<U+017F>o impious, and contrary to Chri<U+017F>tian Faith, which teaching us that there are but three places, where the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ouls have their abode, to wit, Paradice, Hell, and Purgatory, it is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that tho<U+017F>e which are confin'd to the la<U+017F>t never come out thence, but upon a <U+017F>pecial permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of God, which he <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grants them, that they may <U+017F>ollicit the <U+017F>uffrages of the Living; tho<U+017F>e of the damned are further from being in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to get out of that infernal pri<U+017F>on, to which Divine Ju<U+017F>tice hath condemn'd them, to be there eternally tormented; And the Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed Spirits are yet more unlikely to quit their bli<U+017F>sful State and the joys of Paradice, wherewith they are inebriated, to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the vain curio<U+017F>ities of tho<U+017F>e who invocate them, and for the mo<U+017F>t part make u<U+017F>e of them rather to compa<U+017F>s the mi<U+017F>chievous Sorceries and <U+017F>uch like Crimes whereof that Black Art makes profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, then to procure good to any one; or if it happen that at any time they do any, 'tis in order to the doing of <U+017F>ome greater mi<U+017F>chief afterwards, <U+017F>uch as may be that of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tition and Idolatry, whereto the<U+017F>e <U+017F>pirits inclining tho<U+017F>e who invocate them, and requiring of them <U+017F>uch Sacrifices and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are due only to the Deity, it is more then a pre<U+017F>umption, that they cannot be the <U+017F>ouls of the Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed, but downright De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, who, transform'd into Angels of Light, impo<U+017F>e upon tho<U+017F>e who are <U+017F>o willing to be <U+017F>educ'd.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That as the employments of the Devils are different, <U+017F>o is there al<U+017F>o a remarkable difference in their natures, which depends principally on the places of their abode, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which, if we may believe <hi>Orpheus,</hi> <U+017F>ome of them are <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>tial</hi> or <hi>Fiery,</hi> <U+017F>ome <hi>Aery,</hi> <U+017F>ome <hi>Watery,</hi> and <U+017F>ome <hi>Terre<U+017F>trial</hi> and <hi>Subterraneous</hi>; and among tho<U+017F>e the Aerial, to whom <hi>Plato</hi> attributes the invention of Magick, are by the Students of that Art, accounted to be the mo<U+017F>t ingenious to deceive men, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of their more ea<U+017F>ie putting on of the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er parts of the air, and their appearing under what forms they plea<U+017F>e; and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, it will be no hard matter for them to a<U+017F><U+017F>ume that of the bodies of deceas'd per<U+017F>ons, and, by that counterfeit appearance, to deceive the credulity of tho<U+017F>e, who are per<U+017F>waded, that, by this art of Conjuration, they may be oblig'd to make a particular di<U+017F>covery of them<U+017F>elves; and it is an ob<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Ananias,</hi> in
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:66371:244"/>
the third Book of the Nature of Devils, when a dying per<U+017F>on pre<U+017F>ented his right Hand to <U+017F>ome other, who thereupon joyn'd Hands with him. Nor is this any thing le<U+017F>s <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious than for the <U+017F>aid two per<U+017F>ons to make a mutual promi<U+017F>e one to the other, that he, who <U+017F>hall die fir<U+017F>t of the two, <U+017F>hall appear to the <U+017F>urvivor, to give him an account what condition he is in; <U+017F>ince that, in the<U+017F>e Apparitions, it is always to be fear'd, that they are the Evil Spirits, who<U+017F>e main de<U+017F>ign is to <U+017F>educe them that a<U+017F><U+017F>ume their places, and do appear in<U+017F>tead of tho<U+017F>e whom we think we <U+017F>ee.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That he thought it not very <U+017F>trange that the Souls of the deceas'd, having <U+017F>till a certain remembrance of tho<U+017F>e with whom they convers'd in this Life, and to whom they are <U+017F>till oblig'd by <U+017F>ome tie of affection, <U+017F>uch as was that of the Rich man in Hell towards his living Brethren, <U+017F>hould al<U+017F>o have an Inclination to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them as much as they can. It may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be inferr'd, that, with the permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of God, they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when they are earne<U+017F>tly intreated to do it. For, not to <U+017F>peak of <hi>Mo<U+017F>es</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who appear'd on Mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> the day of the Transfiguration; the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>Onias</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to <hi>Judas Macchabaeus,</hi> as the Soul of <hi>Samuel</hi> did to <hi>Saul</hi>; to whom the Holy Scripture attributing the gift of Prophecy, that apparition was not illu<U+017F>ory, nor procur'd by the Devil a<U+017F><U+017F>uming the <U+017F>hape of that Prophet, but certain and real, in which that Holy Man pre<U+017F>ented him<U+017F>elf, and, out of the de<U+017F>ire he had to bring that King, for whom he <U+017F>ometime had a great affection, into the way of <U+017F>alvation, he remon<U+017F>trated to him the judgments of God, which would fall upon him, if he turned not from the evil of his wayes.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That though there be nothing but confu<U+017F>ion among the Evil Spirits, yet is there to be imagin'd a certain Order in their Nature, and <U+017F>uch a Subordination among them, that there are Superiours and inferiours, whereof <U+017F>ome have a <U+017F>overeignty over others. Thence it comes, that among the Magicians, who have unhappily ingag'd them<U+017F>elves in their <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, tho<U+017F>e who have given up their Names to a Devil of a <U+017F>upe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Hierarchy, force the others to obey them, and may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>uperiority over the Spirits of a lower Cla<U+017F>s, as their Ma<U+017F>ter can. It is to the<U+017F>e Regent or principal Magicians, that <U+017F>ome would attribute the priviledge of calling up the Souls of the dead, and, for want of them, the Evil Spirits of an inferiour Order, whom they <U+017F>hew to tho<U+017F>e who con<U+017F>ult them; or when they cannot do that, they think it enough to procure an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Spectres and Shades, by that cur<U+017F>ed Art of Conjuration, di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd for that rea<U+017F>on into <hi>Necromancy</hi> and <hi>Sciomancy,</hi> whereof the former makes the dead appear, or rather Devils, with their very Bodies, and their Clothes and other marks, which they had during their being here: The other <U+017F>hews only Phanta<U+017F>mes, which have <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>emblance of them, yet make a
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:66371:244"/>
<U+017F>hift to an<U+017F>wer their Que<U+017F>tions who come to enquire of them. And whereas the whole my<U+017F>tery is full of impo<U+017F>tures, they omit nothing that may cau<U+017F>e terrours, that <U+017F>o mens <U+017F>pirits being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd, they might give the greater credit thereto. It was the opinion of ancient Pagani<U+017F>m, which fir<U+017F>t exercis'd this Art, that the Souls of the dead might be evocated, by pouring on the ground Wine, Milk, and Honey, and mixing it with the blood of certain Animals newly kill'd, the entrails whereof, being <U+017F>till hot, were afterwards carried three <U+017F>everal times about two Altars, garni<U+017F>h'd with three black or blew fillets, and a Cyprus. But when they were per<U+017F>waded that tho<U+017F>e Souls of the deceas'd, which they call'd <hi>Manes,</hi> were incens'd again<U+017F>t them, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd them with black Victims, ca<U+017F>ting their entrails dipp'd in Oyle, into a fire laid on their Sepulchres made of <U+017F>uch Trees as bear no fruit, gave them Incen<U+017F>e, ca<U+017F>t Wine with the hollow of the Hand, and exercis'd <U+017F>uch Ceremonies for the mo<U+017F>t part ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; which al<U+017F>o were commonly perform'd at mid-night, and in Caves and <U+017F>ubterraneous places, there being not any thing they thought more contrary to tho<U+017F>e Spirits of darkne<U+017F>s, than the light of the day, and e<U+017F>pecially the ri<U+017F>ing of the Sun. Thence it proceeded, that <hi>Homer</hi> <U+017F>ends his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> into ob<U+017F>cure places, there to con<U+017F>ult the Soul of <hi>Tire<U+017F>ias</hi>; and <hi>Virgil</hi> makes <hi>Aeneas</hi> de<U+017F>cend under ground, to learn of the Sibyl what he had to do. The Poets al<U+017F>o have feign'd that <hi>Orpheus</hi> de<U+017F>cended into Hell, to fetch thence his Wife <hi>Eurydice</hi>; and the Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Pau<U+017F>anias</hi> tells us, that, to appea<U+017F>e the Gho<U+017F>t of <hi>Cleonica,</hi> whom he had kill'd, by mi<U+017F>take, and for which act he was continually tormented in the night time, he offer'd <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch <U+017F>acrifices to it in an ob<U+017F>cure place call'd <hi>Heraclea,</hi> where having appear'd to him, <U+017F>he told him, that he <U+017F>hould be deliver'd out of all his <U+017F>ufferings as <U+017F>oon as he were return'd into <hi>Lacedaemonia</hi>; as accordingly he was, having been there <U+017F>tarv'd to death with hunger in the Temple of <hi>Pallas,</hi> where he had taken Sanctuary, to avoid the fury of his Fellow-citizens, by whom he was pur<U+017F>u'd.</p>

            <p>NAtural Magick hath degenerated extreamly in the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t Ages, wherein it is grown as execrable, even to the very name of it, as it was honourable at the beginning, as tho<U+017F>e of Tyrant and Sophi<U+017F>t were heretofore denominations generally e<U+017F>teem'd, but now they are abhorr'd. The ill u<U+017F>e which <U+017F>ome have made thereof, is, the true Cau<U+017F>e of this treatment of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Magick, which they have fill'd with vanities and impo<U+017F>tures, whereas it is in it <U+017F>elf not only the noble<U+017F>t, but al<U+017F>o the mo<U+017F>t an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:66371:245"/>
of all the Sciences. For it is conceiv'd to have begun above four thou<U+017F>and years <U+017F>ince in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> under <hi>Zoroa<U+017F>ter</hi> the Grand<U+017F>on of <hi>Noah,</hi> whence it was <U+017F>pread among the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans,</hi> and the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians,</hi> among whom the <hi>Magi</hi> were in <U+017F>o great authority, that, with the My<U+017F>teries of Religion, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru<U+017F>ted with the Civil Government and the conduct and tuition of the Kings, who were never admitted to the Crown, till they had been fully in<U+017F>tructed in that Di<U+017F>cipline. By this it was that <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Amphion</hi> came to be <U+017F>o powerful, as to draw brute bea<U+017F>ts and <U+017F>tones after them; and hereby King <hi>Solomon</hi> came to be the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t of all men; and, la<U+017F>tly, by the <U+017F>tudy of this, <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius Tyanaeus, Pythagoras, Socrates,</hi> and the other Sages of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity acquir'd the e<U+017F>teem they were in. But what adds much to the recommendation of it, is, that by its means the three <hi>Magi,</hi> or Wi<U+017F>e Men in the Go<U+017F>pel, who were Kings, came from the Ea<U+017F>t, where this Science flouri<U+017F>hed, having found out that the Star which they <U+017F>aw, being different from all the others, yet no Meteor kindled by <U+017F>ome Natural Cau<U+017F>e, was an extraordinary <U+017F>ign which God had been pleas'd to make appear unto them, to give them notice of the Birth of his Son; there being no rational ground to imagine they were down-right Magicians, as <hi>Theophylact</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in his Commentaries upon Saint <hi>Matthew</hi>; at lea<U+017F>t this is certain, that, after the adoration of our Saviour, they ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounc'd that Diabolical Magick, if it be <U+017F>uppos'd they had any tincture of it before. For as to this latter, which is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <U+017F>ome compact with the Devil, who thereby obliges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf to do tran<U+017F>cendent things for him with whom he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, being a kind of Idolatry it is generally abhorr'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by all, <U+017F>ince it makes u<U+017F>e of pernicious means to attain its end, which is ever bad. But <U+017F>uch is not the other, who<U+017F>e end, and the means it employes to compa<U+017F>s it being good and lawful, there is no doubt, but it may be lawfully u<U+017F>ed. Be<U+017F>ides, as <hi>P<U+017F>ellus</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> two per<U+017F>ons well <U+017F>kill'd in the<U+017F>e matters, have very well ob<U+017F>erv'd this la<U+017F>t kind, call'd Natural Magick, is only an exact and perfect knowledge of the <U+017F>ecrets of Nature, by means whereof, con<U+017F>equently to the Ob<U+017F>ervations which <U+017F>ome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently-curious per<U+017F>ons make of the motions of the Heavens, and the influences of the Starrs, with the Sympathies and Antipathies which are almo<U+017F>t in all <U+017F>ublunary bodies, they apply things <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>tly one to another, and with <U+017F>uch an exact con<U+017F>ideration of time, place, manner, and proportion, that they work prodigious effects; which, the more credulous, and <U+017F>uch as are ignorant of the corre<U+017F>pondence there is between the<U+017F>e Effects and their Cau<U+017F>es, look upon as Miracles and Enchantments. Such as were tho<U+017F>e of the Magicians of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who could turn their Rods into Serpents, make the Rivers of <hi>Aegypt</hi> red as blood, and fill the whole Country with Froggs, but were not able to go any further, to imitate the other Miracles of <hi>Mo<U+017F>es,</hi> which they were forc'd to acknowledg wrought by the Finger of God. Nor
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:66371:245"/>
are the Effects of Artificial Magick le<U+017F>s wonderful, not only in re<U+017F>pect of its Predictions ob<U+017F>ervable in Judiciary A<U+017F>trology, Agriculture, Medicine, the Art of Navigation, and others, grounded upon very probable Conjectures, but al<U+017F>o of its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as well true as fal<U+017F>e, or illu<U+017F>ory. The true ones are grounded on the Principles of the Mathematicks, e<U+017F>pecially on tho<U+017F>e of the Mechanicks, which are the noble<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary part thereof, and on which do depend all the Water-Engines, Machins moving of them<U+017F>elves, and other Inventions wherewith the Ancients wrought <U+017F>uch Effects as were accounted miraculous. Such were, that Man's Head of bra<U+017F>s made by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Magnus,</hi> which fram'd an articulated Man's Voice, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that of <hi>Memnon</hi>; the glazen Sphere of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> the motions whereof naturally repre<U+017F>ented tho<U+017F>e of the Cele<U+017F>tial Orbes; his Burning-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, wherewith he burnt the Fleet of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who be<U+017F>ieg'd the City of <hi>Sarago<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> where he then was; the wooden Dove of <hi>Archytas,</hi> which flew up and down with the other Doves; as did the little Birds of <hi>Boëtius</hi> made of Copper, which had this further advantage, that they could <U+017F>ing melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diou<U+017F>ly; as could al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e which the Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> caus'd to be made of Gold; Malleable Gla<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>uch other admirable Effects of this Art, for that rea<U+017F>on called by <hi>Hero, Thaumaturgica.</hi> Tho<U+017F>e which it produces by illu<U+017F>ion and jugling, depend on <U+017F>ome <U+017F>leightne<U+017F>s of hand, and cou<U+017F>ening tricks, <U+017F>uch as are us'd by the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of Legerdemain, to delude our Sen<U+017F>es, and make things appear otherwi<U+017F>e than they are. Such a performance was that mention'd by <hi>Jo<U+017F>ephus,</hi> in the xviii. Book of his <hi>Antiquities,</hi> u<U+017F>ed by that fal<U+017F>e Me<U+017F><U+017F>ias, <hi>Barchochabas,</hi> who to gain him<U+017F>elf the e<U+017F>teem of the true one, had the knack of vomiting flames of Fire out of his Mouth as he <U+017F>poke, by means of a lighted piece of Towe, which he could order as occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>erv'd; which trick, <U+017F>uch another Impo<U+017F>tor <U+017F>hew'd more cleverly, by means of a nut-<U+017F>hell fill'd with Brim<U+017F>tone and Fire. And it is a thing now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known, that, by certain Artifices no way diabolical, one may make a company of people <U+017F>itting at the Table look as if they were dead, or like <U+017F>o many Tawny-Moors; nay, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Pliny,</hi> in the xxviii. and xxxv. Books of his Hi<U+017F>tory, they may be made to look as if they had the Heads of A<U+017F><U+017F>es or Hor<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That, according to the Doctrine of Pagani<U+017F>m, re-advanc'd <U+017F>ince the Light of Chri<U+017F>tianity by the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and the <hi>Manichees,</hi> as there were two Gods, one called <hi>Oromazus,</hi> the Author of all good, who was the Sun; the other, <hi>Arimanes,</hi> Authour of all mi<U+017F>chief; <U+017F>o there were two kindes of <hi>Magick</hi> whereof one, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of an exact knowledge, and application of things in order to a good end, is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and known by the <U+017F>imple denomination of <hi>Magick,</hi> which they affirm to be an invocation of tho<U+017F>e <hi>Genii,</hi> who are our Guardians and Benefactors, in order to the procuring of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:66371:246"/>
<U+017F>ome good either to our <U+017F>elves or others: The other called <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gania,</hi> which they exerci<U+017F>ed by the invocation of the bad <hi>Genii</hi> or <hi>Daemons,</hi> was ever condemn'd as pernicious, as having no other de<U+017F>ign then to do mi<U+017F>chief by Sorceries and Witchcraft. And though the grounds of that Doctrine are contrary to the Truth of Chri<U+017F>tian Faith, yet <U+017F>ince it a<U+017F><U+017F>ures us that there are good and bad Angels, which were the <hi>Genii</hi> of Pagani<U+017F>m; there is <U+017F>ome probability, that as the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t incline us to Idolatry, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<U+017F>tition, and other Impieties, to divert us from the wor<U+017F>hip of the true God, by the <U+017F>tudy of the Black Art; <U+017F>o is it the main bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of the former, by a di<U+017F>covery of the Secrets of Nature, which is the White and Natural Magick, to incline us to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Author of it. In like manner, as we find, according to the Apo<U+017F>tle, that, in the order which God ob<U+017F>erves for the good of his Church and the furtherance of our Salvation, there are divers Gifts, <U+017F>uch as are tho<U+017F>e of knowledge, healing, working of miracles, prophecying, <U+017F>peaking of <U+017F>trange languages, and the like; all which do notwith<U+017F>tanding depend on the <U+017F>ame Spirit of God, who di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>es them according to his good plea<U+017F>ure: So the Devil, who endeavours to imitate the Works of God, does the like, in the di<U+017F>tribution of tho<U+017F>e Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which he communicates to his in<U+017F>truments, to employ them upon different occa<U+017F>ions, the better to accommodate him<U+017F>elf to the diver<U+017F>ity of their inclinations, whom he would abu<U+017F>e, which is his principal de<U+017F>ign. He furni<U+017F>hes tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e re<U+017F>tle<U+017F>s curio<U+017F>ity will needs know things to come, with Oracles and Predictions; he entertains the vain with impo<U+017F>tures and illu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the envious with Charms and Sorceries; the revengeful, and <U+017F>uch as are inclin'd to <U+017F>uch implacable pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, are <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ted with all the mi<U+017F>chievous contrivances, which that perver<U+017F>e Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is at all times ready to teach any who are de<U+017F>irous to be his Di<U+017F>ciples, to whom the practice of his in<U+017F>tructions prove as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as they are intended, to be to tho<U+017F>e, again<U+017F>t whom they are employ'd.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXXIV. Of the Moles and Marks appearing in the Face.</head>
            <p>AS the Face is the highe<U+017F>t part of the Body, as to <U+017F>citua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the mo<U+017F>t delicate, as being the man<U+017F>ion of the external Sen<U+017F>es, which cannot act without the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Spirits, whereby that delicacy is imprinted in it; <U+017F>o does it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly lie more expos'd to as well internal as external injuries, then the other parts, which are not <U+017F>o much in <U+017F>ight, nor of <U+017F>o exqui<U+017F>ite a complexion. And as the lea<U+017F>t flaw in a Diamond, or
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:66371:246"/>
a fair Looking-gla<U+017F>s is <U+017F>oon perceiv'd by <U+017F>uch as look attentively on them, <U+017F>o the<U+017F>e Marks are <U+017F>o much the more ob<U+017F>ervable in the Face, then in any other part of the body, the more <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible it is thereof, by rea<U+017F>on of its clearne<U+017F>s and delicacy. I may add to this a thing which would be very improbable, if we had not the a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of experience for it; to wit, that there is not any mark though ever <U+017F>o little, in the face, but doth denote <U+017F>ome other, which though not apparent, it is neverthele<U+017F>s ea<U+017F>ie for <U+017F>uch as are expert to conjecture whereabout it is, by the in<U+017F>pecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of tho<U+017F>e that are manife<U+017F>t. Thus if there be a mark in the mid<U+017F>t of the Fore-head, it <U+017F>hews that there is <U+017F>uch another in the mid<U+017F>t of the brea<U+017F>t; but it will be towards one <U+017F>ide or other of this latter, inclining towards one of the arms, if the mark in the Forehead be not exactly in the middle of it, that is, incline any thing to the right or left <U+017F>ide: as it mu<U+017F>t be on the bri<U+017F>ket or lower part of the brea<U+017F>t, if it appear at the extremity of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head towards the root of the no<U+017F>e, between which and the parts devoted to generation, there is <U+017F>uch a corre<U+017F>pondence, that the <U+017F>imple<U+017F>t <U+017F>ort of people draw con<U+017F>equences of their good or bad di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, from the length or figure of the no<U+017F>e. But the more intelligent, not contenting them<U+017F>elves with this conjecture, affirm, that, according to the different <U+017F>cituations of tho<U+017F>e marks, there are the like corre<U+017F>pondent to them in tho<U+017F>e parts, as well of the Man as of the Woman; for whether tho<U+017F>e on the former be in the middle, on the right <U+017F>ide or the left, tho<U+017F>e on the other parts are exactly an<U+017F>werable to them. The <U+017F>everal ob<U+017F>ervations which have been made of the<U+017F>e corre<U+017F>pondences of marks in the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men we <U+017F>hall leave to the examination of the Female Phy<U+017F>io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnomi<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>o far as the parts before-mentioned are under con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and confine our <U+017F>elves to the Men. In the<U+017F>e, the mark which is apparent on the highe<U+017F>t part of the no<U+017F>e towards the root, as we call'd it before, where the <U+017F>pace is between both eyes, always denotes another at the bottom of the Yard, near the Te<U+017F>ticles; between which and the Ey-lids there is <U+017F>o great a corre<U+017F>pondence, that tho<U+017F>e little <U+017F>pecks or warts which are many times to be <U+017F>een on the latter, are the <U+017F>ignificators of the like in the former; even with that ob<U+017F>ervance of proportion, that if it be on the upper-lid, tho<U+017F>e marks will be on that part of the Cods which is neare<U+017F>t the Yard; if it be on the lower, they <U+017F>hall be on that part which is neare<U+017F>t the Fundament. Moreover, from the appearance of one of the<U+017F>e marks upon one of the Ey-brows, it is concluded, that there is as much on the <U+017F>houlder on the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ide, which is at a greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er di<U+017F>tance from the Back-bone, the nearer to or further off the other is from the <U+017F>pace which is between both the eys. There is the like corre<U+017F>pondence between the Cheeks and the Thighs, for if they have a mark ju<U+017F>t in the middle, the thigh <U+017F>hall be marked ju<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>ame part, and on the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ide; if they be near the no<U+017F>e, the thigh <U+017F>hall be marked near the groin; if they incline towards the ears, the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:66371:247"/>
corre<U+017F>pondent marks will be towards the buttocks. The mark appearing between the Eye and the eminent part of the Cheek, di<U+017F>covers one under the Arm-pit; that on the tip of the Ear, <U+017F>hews there <U+017F>hould be one on the upper part of the Arm. It is inferr'd al<U+017F>o from the mark upon the upper lip adjoyning to the No<U+017F>e, in that <U+017F>pace which makes a <U+017F>eparation been the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trils, that there is another an<U+017F>werable thereto in the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> betwixt the Fundament and the Cods; and from tho<U+017F>e on the Chin and the lower Lip, that there are others about the bottom of the belly. But though the<U+017F>e rules are grounded on rational conjectures, yet are they not infallible, no more then tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Phy<U+017F>tognomy,</hi> whereof they are a part; as is al<U+017F>o <hi>Metopo<U+017F>copy,</hi> which judges of the <U+017F>ecret inclinations by the in<U+017F>pection of the Face. The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, That, as Man comprehends in him<U+017F>elf an abbreviation of all the rarities of the World; <U+017F>o does his Face comprehend all tho<U+017F>e of his body, whereof it is an extract. So that as the greater world is known by Man's body, which is the le<U+017F><U+017F>er, it is no hard matter to make a di<U+017F>covery of this la<U+017F>t by the face, which indeed is le<U+017F>s as to volume, but <U+017F>o well compos'd and proportion'd, that it may well be look'd upon as the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>h'd Ma<U+017F>ter-piece of Nature, who in the <U+017F>tructure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath imitated Geography, which, not able to <U+017F>hew us all the inhabitable Earth, pre<U+017F>ents us with an epitom of it in a Map; or behaves her <U+017F>elf like a Whole-<U+017F>ale-Merchant, who does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e all his commodities, but thinks it enough to <U+017F>hew patterns thereof, whereby a judgment may be made of their value. Thus it is that there may be a di<U+017F>covery made of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within, by the figure and compo<U+017F>ition of the parts of the face, ina<U+017F>much as tho<U+017F>e of the other parts of the body depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, there is a judgment made of the one by the other, and con<U+017F>equently of the actions and inclinations, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly an<U+017F>werable to the con<U+017F>titution and temperament of the parts. But it is <U+017F>omewhat hard to make this judgment by the <U+017F>imple marks of the Face, whether they proceed from Nature, as tho<U+017F>e do which Children bring along with them into the World, and depend on the imagination of the Mothers, which is an external cau<U+017F>e; or from <U+017F>ome other Cau<U+017F>es, as the heat of the entrails, the abundance of gro<U+017F>s and terrene humours, and the den<U+017F>ity of the pores of the <U+017F>kin, which, checking them in their way, makes them appear in freckles, <U+017F>pecks, and other kinds of <U+017F>pots in the face? For, the<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es never being con<U+017F>tant, but <U+017F>ubject to much variety, according to the <U+017F>everal occurrences which either augment or dimini<U+017F>h them, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to make a certain judgment of a thing, which is in a continual change.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the <U+017F>aid Art of gue<U+017F><U+017F>ing at the marks of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret parts of the body by the in<U+017F>pection of tho<U+017F>e of the face, is <U+017F>o ancient, that the Phy<U+017F>ician <hi>Melampus,</hi> cited in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> Ody<U+017F><U+017F>. lib. xv. deliver'd certain precepts of it, above three thou<U+017F>and years <U+017F>ince; and after him, <hi>Avenzoar, Septalius, Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilius,</hi>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:66371:247"/>
and <U+017F>everal others have cultivated it, and endeavour'd to <U+017F>hew the probability of certain rea<U+017F>ons, which they ground principally upon the corre<U+017F>pondence there is between the face and its parts, and all the other parts of the whole body of Man. It con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in two heads, to wit, in the proportion of greatne<U+017F>s or mea<U+017F>ure, or in the re<U+017F>emblance of colour, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency, figure, <U+017F>cituation, number, or <U+017F>uch other condition, which may be common between them. The fir<U+017F>t corre<U+017F>pondence between the face and the re<U+017F>t of the body, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in greatne<U+017F>s, which comprehends the three dimen<U+017F>ions, length, breadth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity, is <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, that tho<U+017F>e who have exactly mea<U+017F>ur'd all the parts of it, have found, that the face is the ninth part of the greatne<U+017F>s of the body, making the di<U+017F>tributions of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>paces <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t that no one exceed another; provided that the body be well compos'd, and that there be no defect in the conformation, nor any con<U+017F>iderable di<U+017F>order in the temperament of the whole, or its parts. The fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>paces comprehends the face it <U+017F>elf; the <U+017F>econd is from the throat to the brisket, where the xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoidal Gri<U+017F>tle is; the third reaches below the Navil; the fourth pa<U+017F><U+017F>es by the groin to the beginning of the haunches; the fifth and <U+017F>ixth comprehend the whole extent of the thigh; at the end whereof is the <U+017F>eventh, which with the eighth take up the whole <U+017F>pace from the knee to the heel, as the ninth does that of the whole foot: wherein as there are three new regions called <hi>Thar<U+017F>e, Metathar<U+017F>e,</hi> and the <hi>Toes,</hi> <U+017F>o are there as many in the Face. The fir<U+017F>t whereof, which is the man<U+017F>ion of wi<U+017F>dom, is from the beginning of the hair to that of the no<U+017F>e, where there is an interval between the Eye-brows. The <U+017F>econd, which is that of beauty, comprehends all from that <hi>inter<U+017F>titium,</hi> to the end of the no<U+017F>e; and the third, where the <U+017F>eat of goodne<U+017F>s is, reaches to the lower part of the chin. Now the<U+017F>e different intervals are in like manner ob<U+017F>ervable in the other <U+017F>paces, with <U+017F>o exact a proportion, that the countenance is not only an<U+017F>werable to any one of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>paces, which, with it, make up the whole great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of man's body; but there is al<U+017F>o a corre<U+017F>pondence between every part of it, and tho<U+017F>e of each of the <U+017F>aid <U+017F>paces, as between the highe<U+017F>t, the mid<U+017F>t, and the lowe<U+017F>t part, and that which is in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>cituation, as between right and right, and left and left. So that as the face is not only the mea<U+017F>ure of the whole body, being repeated nine times, but al<U+017F>o the lea<U+017F>t parts of the face bearing the <U+017F>ame proportion to tho<U+017F>e of the re<U+017F>t of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem, that rational con<U+017F>equences may be drawn of the marks of tho<U+017F>e parts that are out of our <U+017F>ight, by tho<U+017F>e of the Face which are apparent to us. For if it be con<U+017F>ider'd, that, be<U+017F>ides the corre<U+017F>pondence there is between them as to quantity, there is yet another, which we <U+017F>aid was that of re<U+017F>emblance, which makes a <U+017F>trict affinity between them, and <U+017F>uch as is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ob<U+017F>ervable between the Forehead and the Brea<U+017F>t; the Ey-brows, and the Shoulders; the cavities of the Ey-brows, and
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:66371:248"/>
the Arm-pits; the Ears, and the Arms; the Chin, and the Groin; the Cheeks, and the Thighes, and <U+017F>o of the re<U+017F>t; tho<U+017F>e who have this knowledge, may ea<U+017F>ily ghe<U+017F>s at the Warts, the Moles, and marks that are out of our <U+017F>ight, by tho<U+017F>e which are apparent to us; it being probable, that as Nature hath mark'd the one with one <U+017F>ign, which is as it were the Seal <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>et to her work, it mu<U+017F>t needs be found after the <U+017F>ame manner in that counter-part, between which and the other, there is an alliance, not only by rea<U+017F>on of its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and compo<U+017F>ition, but upon the account of <U+017F>everal other Accidents, which make them alike. Thus the Fore-head by rea<U+017F>on of its plain figure in the middle, and circular towards the extremities, and by its <U+017F>olidity is a <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient repre<U+017F>entation of the Brea<U+017F>t. The eminent <U+017F>cituation of the Eye-brows di<U+017F>covers the corre<U+017F>pondence there is between them and the <U+017F>houlders, which are the mo<U+017F>t elevated parts of the Body; and the cavities of the Eyes which is under the Eye-Brows, have <U+017F>ome alliance with tho<U+017F>e of the Armpits, which are under the Shoulders. The Cheeks, by rea<U+017F>on of their fle<U+017F>hy and mu<U+017F>culous compo<U+017F>ition, have a relation to the Thighs, and particularly, to the Buttocks, which are <U+017F>ituated in the mid<U+017F>t of the Trunk, as the Cheek is in the Face, between the Fore-head and the Chin. The Mouth and the Chin have al<U+017F>o a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with the Belly and the Groin, the former being <U+017F>ituated in the lower part of the Face, and the latter at the lower part of the Belly; as al<U+017F>o upon this account, that they are equally fle<U+017F>hy, and <U+017F>oft in their <U+017F>uperiour parts, and, in their inferiour parts, bony and hard. But this corre<U+017F>pondence is yet more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible between the Mouth of the Woman and her <U+017F>ecret parts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lips of both tho<U+017F>e parts, which for that rea<U+017F>on have the <U+017F>ame name; as there is the like between the No<U+017F>e, the Eye-brows, and the Eyes, and the Genitals of a Man, the Te<U+017F>ticles and the Cods. Nor can there be any <U+017F>ign more manife<U+017F>t, than <U+017F>uch as appear in tho<U+017F>e places; whence there may be inferr'd the marks of tho<U+017F>e which Nature hath <U+017F>o much conceal'd; which though <U+017F>o far out of <U+017F>ight, are neverthele<U+017F>s manife<U+017F>t to <U+017F>uch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons as have the curio<U+017F>ity to <U+017F>tudy this corre<U+017F>pondence. But there is <U+017F>uch an a<U+017F><U+017F>ociation between the Hand and the Foot, as well in regard of their compo<U+017F>ition and <U+017F>tructure, as for the employments they are both put to; that the marks about the Hand and Fingers, have others an<U+017F>werable to them on the <U+017F>ame parts of the Foot, in a corre<U+017F>pondent order and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition one to another.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That to find out the rea<U+017F>on of this Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sympathy, we mu<U+017F>t not confine our <U+017F>elves to <U+017F>ublunary Cau<U+017F>es, but attribute an Effect <U+017F>o well order'd, and <U+017F>o regular to a Cau<U+017F>e an<U+017F>werable thereto. For my part, I cannot a<U+017F><U+017F>ign any but what is derived from the Heavens, who<U+017F>e motions and influences being the general Cau<U+017F>es of what-ever happens here below, that is con<U+017F>tant and regular, it is to them that we ought
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:66371:248"/>
to attribute an exactne<U+017F>s, which is <U+017F>o certain, that it very <U+017F>eldom mi<U+017F>carries. Thence it comes that the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of A<U+017F>trology, with <U+017F>ome ground of rea<U+017F>on, affirm, that as there is no Plant <U+017F>o incon<U+017F>iderable but hath its <U+017F>ignature imprinted on it by that Star, which hath a predominancy over it; <U+017F>o is there a far <U+017F>tronger rea<U+017F>on, than Man <U+017F>hould have his <U+017F>ignature, which, as they maintain, is <U+017F>et upon him as a <U+017F>eal, by the Star on which he hath a dependance; it being certain that the <U+017F>even Planets have an Empire over every part which they govern. Thus <hi>Ptolemy</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ignes to <hi>Saturn</hi> the right Ear, the Spleen, the Bladder, and the Bones; to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Hands, the Lungs, the Liver, the Blood, and the Seed; to <hi>Mars,</hi> the left Ear, the Reins, and the Te<U+017F>ticles; to the <hi>Sun,</hi> the Brain, the Eyes, and the Nerves; to <hi>Venus,</hi> the No<U+017F>e, the Mouth, and the Genitals; to <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Tongue, the Under<U+017F>tanding, and Ratiocination; to the <hi>Moon,</hi> the Mouth of the Stomack, and the Stomack it <U+017F>elf. But they attribute the<U+017F>e marks of the Face to the motion of the Stars of the eighth Sphere, which are as it were expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the different Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which every one naturally hath, and which are be<U+017F>tow'd on him at his Nativity; but with this Caution, that it is hard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate them, unle<U+017F>s a Man can decipher tho<U+017F>e Characters, and find out the true <U+017F>ignification thereof, which is the chiefe<U+017F>t of all Sciences.</p>

            <p>THere never was any Opinion <U+017F>o erroneous, but it met with <U+017F>ome Abettors; nor any thing in point of practi<U+017F>e <U+017F>o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, but was in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure authoriz'd. Of this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is that of <hi>Auguries.</hi> For, though <hi>Cicero,</hi> when he was Augur, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>omewhat on the behalf of them, yet in his <U+017F>econd Book of <hi>Divination,</hi> he could not forbear di<U+017F>covering their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urdity, and charging them with vanity and foolery. And yet this Opinion was in <U+017F>uch veneration among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were otherwi<U+017F>e the mo<U+017F>t prudent of any Nation in the world, that they <U+017F>ent yearly <U+017F>ix Children, Sons of the mo<U+017F>t eminent Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, into <hi>Tu<U+017F>cany,</hi> to learn of the Inhabitants thereof (who it <U+017F>eems were well <U+017F>kill'd in it) the Science of foretelling things to come by the flight, <U+017F>inging, or chirping of Birds, <U+017F>ince general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known by the name of <hi>Augury.</hi> Nay, this veneration is the more remarkable in this re<U+017F>pect, that they would not undertake any thing of importance, till they had fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ulted the Colledg of Augurs, which was fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd by <hi>Romulus,</hi> who had al<U+017F>o been in<U+017F>tructed therein, having order'd it to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t only of three per<U+017F>ons, according to the number of the Tribes. But that number
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:66371:249"/>
was afterwards increas'd to 24. who were con<U+017F>ulted about what-ever concern'd that great Empire, and they continu'd till the time of the Elder <hi>Theodo<U+017F>ius</hi>; when it was <U+017F>uppre<U+017F>s'd, having till then been <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable by the nobility and merit of tho<U+017F>e whereof it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted, that they were the Arbitrators of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els and Deliberations, which were not taken, till their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been fir<U+017F>t had. Nay, they had this further advantage above all other Magi<U+017F>trates, that they could not be put out of their places upon any account what<U+017F>oever, but continu'd during their lives in that dignity, as <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> did, who was Augur <U+017F>ixty two years. Nor was it only requi<U+017F>ite that that they <U+017F>hould be free from crimes, but al<U+017F>o from all bodily imperfection, the lea<U+017F>t defect of Body being accounted a lawful Cau<U+017F>e, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Augur from taking place among the re<U+017F>t; it being, as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> affirms in his <hi>Problems,</hi> an undecent thing for any one to pre<U+017F>ent him<U+017F>elf before the Gods, and to treat of the My<U+017F>teries of Religion, with anything of uncleanne<U+017F>s or imperfection about him. Nay, they thought any thing of that kind <U+017F>o contrary to the <U+017F>aid Ceremony, that, to be the more <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof, it was requi<U+017F>ite that the Birds and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whereof they made u<U+017F>e in their Auguries, <U+017F>hould be as free from any defect as the Augurs them<U+017F>elves. In the mean time, they requir'd <U+017F>o much re<U+017F>pect from the people, that, not thinking it enough to have the Lictors march before them with the <hi>Fa<U+017F>ces,</hi> as was done before the chiefe<U+017F>t Magi<U+017F>trates, they had for a further badge of their dignity, a <U+017F>tick crooked at one end, call'd <hi>Lituus,</hi> which was that of Kings. And indeed, they a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>um'd to them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o great authority, that they confirm'd the Elections of <hi>Dictators, Con<U+017F>uls,</hi> and Roman <hi>Praetors,</hi> whom they many times took occa<U+017F>ion to depo<U+017F>e, under pretence that they had been elected contrary to the will of their Gods, whereof they pretended to be the only Interpreters. They took upon them al<U+017F>o the knowledge and di<U+017F>covery of things to come, by carefully ob<U+017F>erving certain extraordinary accidents, which <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd all others by their <U+017F>udden and unexpected coming to pa<U+017F>s, and which, by a certain Science and long Ob<U+017F>ervation, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to be the <U+017F>ignificators of what was to come. And this they derived principally from the Heavens, and the different Apparitions of the Air, e<U+017F>pecially from Thunder and Winds; then from Prodigies and miraculous effects of Nature; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from four-footed Bea<U+017F>ts, but e<U+017F>pecially from Birds, from which comes the name to that kind of Divination, called <hi>Au<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium &amp; Augurium,</hi> wherein tho<U+017F>e Divinators fore-told things conceal'd, and <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>hould come to pa<U+017F>s by the <U+017F>inging and flight of Birds. They al<U+017F>o made the <U+017F>ame Predictions by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erving how the young ones, being taken out of a cubb, where they had been kept, took the food laid before them. For if the<U+017F>e devour'd it with a certain greedine<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o as that <U+017F>ome fell to the ground, the Omen was fortunate, and <U+017F>ignifi'd all happine<U+017F>s
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:66371:249"/>
to the Con<U+017F>ulter; whereas, on the contrary, it <U+017F>ignifi'd ill-luck, if they would not meddle with it at all. And this Opinion was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely rooted in the Minds of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious people, that <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> and <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> attribute the Cau<U+017F>e of two <U+017F>ignal defeats of the <hi>Romans</hi> (one under the Command of <hi>Publius Claudius,</hi> in the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Punick</hi> War; and the other under that of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> in the <U+017F>econd) to their contempt of the<U+017F>e Auguries.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That of all the <U+017F>everal kinds of foretelling <U+017F>ecret things, he thought not any more rational than that which was done by the means of Birds, called <hi>Ornithomantia</hi>; the Nature of which Creatures being very ancient, and in a manner cele<U+017F>tial, they <U+017F>eem to be more <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the Heavens, whereof they are the Inhabitants, and which are the true Cau<U+017F>es of what-ever happens here below, than any other Animals which have their abode either in the Earth or Waters. Thence it comes, that the Eagle which <U+017F>oars up higher than any other of the Volatile Common-wealth, hath been the mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>teem'd in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of Auguries, by the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of this Art, who al<U+017F>o give him the preheminence, as to the con<U+017F>tancy and vivacity of his Sight, taking it for a <U+017F>ignification of good luck, when he began his flight on the right <U+017F>ide; and that e<U+017F>pecially, if it were <U+017F>o violent, that the noi<U+017F>e of his wings might be heard. Thus <hi>Ari<U+017F>tander,</hi> having <U+017F>een an Eagle flying from the Camp of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great towards that of his Enemies, deriv'd thence an Augury of his Victory; as <hi>Tarquinius Pri<U+017F>cus</hi> did the like of his coming (as he afterwards) did to the Crown from this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that an Eagle came and took his Cap off his Head, and <U+017F>et it on again, after he had kept it a good while in the Air. But <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> had for an Augury of his exile and the lo<U+017F>s of his Kingdom, the violence done by <U+017F>ome Vultures to <U+017F>ome young Eagles, which they ca<U+017F>t down out of their Ne<U+017F>t. Such another Augury had <hi>Diony<U+017F>ius</hi> the Tyrant, when, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence, an Eagle, having <U+017F>natch'd away with his beak a dart out of the hands of one of his Guard, ca<U+017F>t it into the Sea; <U+017F>oon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which accident, he was <U+017F>hamefully unthron'd, and forc'd away. Yet does this Bird always denote happine<U+017F>s, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luck, as do al<U+017F>o the Vultures; to twelve whereof, which were <U+017F>een by <hi>Romulus,</hi> while he was laying the foundations of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is conceiv'd, that that Metropolis of the world ows it fortune and continuance. <hi>Darius,</hi> having <U+017F>een two of them torn to pieces by <U+017F>o many Hawks, conceiv'd a hope of enjoying, as he did, the Kingdom of <hi>Per<U+017F>ia</hi>; but he lo<U+017F>t it, together with his Life, after his meeting with a great number of Swallows, as he march'd in the head of his army to engage again<U+017F>t the <hi>Scythians.</hi> And it is believ'd, that they had been al<U+017F>o fatal to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of the <hi>Epirotae,</hi> upon who<U+017F>e Tent tho<U+017F>e trouble<U+017F>om Birds were <U+017F>een; as they had al<U+017F>o been on the Ship wherein <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> was, before his dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter. The greater kind of Owl hath always been accounted <U+017F>o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:66371:250"/>
that one day, being got into the Capitol, under the Con<U+017F>ul<U+017F>hip of <hi>S. Papellius I<U+017F>ter,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Pedonius,</hi> there was a particular <U+017F>olemnity perform'd, for the expiation of the City, which the Augurs affirm'd to have been polluted by that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Bird: which yet was not <U+017F>uch to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> of whom it is oft related, that the <U+017F>aid ill-look'd Bird having appear'd to him in pri<U+017F>on, it prov'd an augury of his re<U+017F>tauration to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judaea,</hi> whereof he had been di<U+017F>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd. The ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Owl is al<U+017F>o of ill pre<U+017F>age; for having one day pearch'd on the top of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s Lance, in his expedition again<U+017F>t the <hi>Argi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> it was his misfortune to lo<U+017F>e the battle. The Ravens are no le<U+017F>s unlucky; for they were the fore-runners of the bloody ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War between <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi>; and their crokings fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hew'd death to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, when he made his entrance into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and did the like to <hi>Cicero,</hi> while he was avoiding the Ambu<U+017F>hes of his inveterate enemy <hi>Antony.</hi> The Madge-howlets, the Scritch-owls, the Cormorants, and other <U+017F>uch mournful and melancholy Birds, make a <U+017F>ufficient di<U+017F>covery of their fatal predictions, by the death of tho<U+017F>e who hear them. The Pilots fear nothing <U+017F>o much as to <U+017F>ee the Cranes flying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and returning back the <U+017F>ame way again; that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn adverti<U+017F>ing them, that they are threatned with <U+017F>ome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary tempe<U+017F>t. The Stork hath always been favourable to Au<U+017F>pices, and look'd upon as a Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of Concord, as the Hawk, and the Buzzard, e<U+017F>pecially where there was any thing done in order to marriage, or about the acqui<U+017F>ition of riches, which the Falcon, whereof the latter is a Species, was conceiv'd to pre<U+017F>age with <U+017F>o much certainty, that the <hi>Thu<U+017F>cans</hi> built the City of <hi>Capua</hi> only upon their perceiving of one of them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their Augury. The Wood-pecker and the Hern have al<U+017F>o made <U+017F>o happy pre<U+017F>ages, that every one rea<U+017F><U+017F>um'd new courage in the heat of a battel, when they appeared in <U+017F>ight of the Souldiers. The Nightingal, which having pearch'd on the lips of <hi>Ste<U+017F>ichorus</hi> whil<U+017F>t he was yet a Child in the Cradle, <U+017F>ung there, was a pre<U+017F>ignification of that <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s, which was afterwards to flow from his delightful Poems; as the Bees which made hony on tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Plato</hi> were a pre<U+017F>age of his Eloquence. Though it mu<U+017F>t be acknowledg'd concerning the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t, that the Augurs were otherwi<U+017F>e conceited of them; for having ob<U+017F>erved great numbers of them in <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Camp, they oblig'd him to quit it, <U+017F>o to avoid the misfortune that threatned him, and which happen'd to the Great <hi>Pompey,</hi> in who<U+017F>e Ships the<U+017F>e Bees were <U+017F>een in exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive numbers before the <hi>Phar<U+017F>alian</hi> defeat. But the<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>ervations are not <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tantly certain, but that there may be much diver<U+017F>ity among them by whom they have been made. Hence is it that <hi>Homer,</hi> among all the good Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, gives the precedence to the Dove, which others will not have to be <U+017F>uch, but only when <U+017F>he is accompany'd, otherwi<U+017F>e being alone they hold that <U+017F>he boads <U+017F>ome ill luck; as the Swan
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:66371:250"/>
does to all but Mariners. But among the re<U+017F>t, the ordinary Hen, when ever <U+017F>he makes a noi<U+017F>e <U+017F>omewhat like the crowing of the Cock, foretells <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ignal misfortune, though that of the Cock him<U+017F>elf be numbred among tho<U+017F>e auguries that denote good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, as having fore<U+017F>hewn victory to <hi>Themi<U+017F>tocles,</hi> the night before he gain'd the battel again<U+017F>t <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and been repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Solar animal, from the corre<U+017F>pondence there is between him and the Sun, who<U+017F>e motions he declares by his crowing, which upon that account is formidable even to Lyons.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That there are two kinds of Auguries, the <hi>Natural,</hi> and the <hi>Artificial:</hi> The former depends on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion there is between the Effects and the Agents whereby they are produc'd; which connexion being known, it is no hard matter to give a conjecture of things to come, whereof <U+017F>uch as are clear-<U+017F>ighted ob<U+017F>erve the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of their coming to pa<U+017F>s, by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>trict connexion there is between them, and the cau<U+017F>es whereby they are produc'd. This is confirm'd by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible predictions which are made not only at Sea by Pilots, who fore<U+017F>ee Tempe<U+017F>ts and winds by <U+017F>uch <U+017F>igns as <U+017F>eldom fail; but al<U+017F>o by <U+017F>imple Labourers and Hu<U+017F>bandmen on the Land, who do the like in the changes of weather. Now this kind of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is as rational as the other is ab<U+017F>urd, as being a frivolous inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, grounded on certain ob<U+017F>ervations, which are for the mo<U+017F>t part vain and impertinent. Such among the re<U+017F>t, is the divi<U+017F>ion it hath made of the Heavens into its twelve Hou<U+017F>es, which are the Regions or Spaces whereto tho<U+017F>e Augurs confin'd the extent of their predictions, which they made with their Augural <U+017F>taff, without which the Auguries, according to their judgment, were of no validity, nor was there any more account to be made of them, then of what might be deriv'd from <U+017F>uch accidents as happen without or be<U+017F>ides expectation, or rather pre<U+017F>ent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, whence they were commonly called <hi>Oblative</hi> Auguries. But tho<U+017F>e which happen'd conformably to the circum<U+017F>tances of time and place, which tho<U+017F>e Divinators had limited, and when they thought of them, were called <hi>Impetrative.</hi> And this is one of the conditions ob<U+017F>erv'd in their di<U+017F>cipline, wherein there was no account made of what the Augur affirm'd that he had not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ob<U+017F>erv'd, no more then then there was of any, thing that pa<U+017F>s'd beyond the compa<U+017F>s of the places de<U+017F>ign'd to that function. For the better ob<U+017F>ervance of the ceremonies thereof, the Augural Hou<U+017F>e was not cover'd but lay open to the air, which, for the better carrying on of the work, <U+017F>hould be clear and <U+017F>erene, out of a fear that the rain or wind might hinder their making an exact ob<U+017F>ervation of the flight and different motions of the Birds; in the choice whereof they were <U+017F>o hard to plea<U+017F>e, that they employ'd them not in their pre<U+017F>ages, but only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Spring. After which, e<U+017F>pecially towards the month of <hi>Augu<U+017F>t,</hi> they made no account of them, in regard they were not then in <U+017F>o much vigour, nor in <U+017F>o good ca<U+017F>e, yet did they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:66371:251"/>
<U+017F>uch a dependance among them, that the Auguries taken from tho<U+017F>e that were inferiour, gave place to the others of a higher quality. So that if a Crow chanced to pa<U+017F>s by, while they were attentively divining by the flight of a Dove, this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter au<U+017F>pice was to no purpo<U+017F>e, no more then would be that of other Birds upon the arrival of the Eagle, which al<U+017F>o would <U+017F>ignifie nothing upon the fall of a thunderbolt, which di<U+017F>turbed all their my<U+017F>teries, with much more rea<U+017F>on then a Rat might do, which had no <U+017F>ooner appear'd in the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, but the whole Ceremony was put off to another more convenient time. True it is then, that <U+017F>ome advantages may be made of Birds, in order to the drawing of auguries and pre<U+017F>ages of natural effects, <U+017F>uch as are rain, thunder, tempe<U+017F>ts, winds, heat, drought, cold, fro<U+017F>t, <U+017F>now, hail, and other changes of weather, produc'd by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the Heavens, the Elements, and other Cau<U+017F>es, as well general as particular; but not to make any predictions thence of <U+017F>uch events and accidents as depend on an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of circum<U+017F>tances of time, place, and per<U+017F>ons, who being purely free agents, their actions are wholly voluntary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be predicted, what artifices <U+017F>oever may be us'd to do it.

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXXVI. Whether tho<U+017F>e Children who are born with Cawls about their whole or <U+017F>ome parts of their Bodies are always for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and why?</head>
            <p>CHildren do ordinarily come naked out of their Mother's Wombs, when, after their <U+017F>truggling with Nature, they begin their entrance into the World with crying and tears, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging their weakne<U+017F>s, and the mi<U+017F>eries they are likely to be expos'd to in the <U+017F>equele of their lives. Yet there are <U+017F>ome Children excepted from this general Rule; and thence is it that <U+017F>ome would have them exempted from the misfortunes common to all the re<U+017F>t, upon this accompt, that they are born with <hi>cawls</hi> about them, that is, are encompa<U+017F>s'd by a membrane, which
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:66371:251"/>
comes over their heads and their <U+017F>houlders, call'd by the Greeks <hi>Amnios,</hi> which is the innermo<U+017F>t of the three membranes, wherein the wombe-lodg'd infant is enwrapped, called by <U+017F>ome Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives the <hi>Coife,</hi> or <hi>Biggin</hi> of the Child, by others the <hi>Childs <U+017F>hirt,</hi> and in <U+017F>ome places known by the name of the <hi>Silihow,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of its tender and delicate intertexture, which other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren quit in their Mothers wombs, before they come out thence, with the other Membrane called <hi>Chorion,</hi> of which together with that ma<U+017F>s of fle<U+017F>h which had <U+017F>erv'd them for a cu<U+017F>hion and <U+017F>upport during the time of the praegnancy, are fram'd the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condines</hi> or <hi>After-burthen,</hi> <U+017F>o called, becau<U+017F>e it comes not out till after the Child is born. And as the<U+017F>e Children born thus cawl'd and coif'd with this tunicle (which like a large Hood or Capouch covers their heads and necks) <U+017F>eem not to participate of the nakedne<U+017F>s of the others, who bring nothing into the World; <U+017F>o is it to be imagin'd, that they are not <U+017F>o much <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the mi<U+017F>eries and calamities in<U+017F>eparable from the common life of other men, ina<U+017F>much as their beginning being different from that of others, who come after the ordinary way into the World, upon the <U+017F>core of this <U+017F>pecial priviledge, of having their heads furr'd and cover'd, the con<U+017F>equence of it ought in all probability to be extraordinary, and full of happine<U+017F>s, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of if this coif be not the cau<U+017F>e, yet have <U+017F>ome at lea<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erv'd that it hath always been the <U+017F>ign, and that all tho<U+017F>e who have been born after that manner have been very fortunate. The Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> <U+017F>irnamed <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> related by <hi>Aelius Lampridius,</hi> in his Life, confirms this ob<U+017F>ervation: For being born with <U+017F>uch a coif, he afterwards came to the <U+017F>overaign dignity of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in the management whereof all things <U+017F>ucceeded according to his wi<U+017F>hes. Nay, it hath been generally believ'd, that good fortune was <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tant an attendant of this Coif, that all tho<U+017F>e who were de<U+017F>irous to compa<U+017F>s their affairs carry'd it about them, e<U+017F>pecially Advocates, who made u<U+017F>e thereof, to gain reputation in their publick pleadings, being to that end very careful to buy them of the Midwives, who, knowing the excellency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <U+017F>old them at a very dear rate, after they had <U+017F>urreptitiou<U+017F>ly got them away from the children, they had received into the World. For tho<U+017F>e who have made it their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to enquire more <U+017F>trictly into this ob<U+017F>ervation, maintain, that he who brings this natural coif with him into the world is to expect all manner of good fortune, even <U+017F>o far as to be invulnerable, provided he be careful to have it always about him, or, (what contributes more to that effect) to eat it, as is over-<U+017F>uper<U+017F>titiou<U+017F>ly done by <U+017F>ome. But the contrary will happen to the Child, if he be robb'd of that precious <hi>exuvium</hi> or coat, or it be <U+017F>ecretly taken from him, to be given to another, who, by that tran<U+017F>lation thereof, will receive the whole benefit of it.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That though the fore<U+017F>aid per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently de<U+017F>troy'd it <U+017F>elf, there being no connexion or corre<U+017F>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:66371:252"/>
between the accidents of humane life and that <U+017F>hirt, which <U+017F>ometimes comes over the whole Body of the Child, commonly falls not much below the Shoulders, and many times does only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Face like a Ma<U+017F>k; yet have many been of Opinion, that it contributed much to happines and the advantage of good fortune; in<U+017F>omuch that Saint <hi>John Chry<U+017F>o<U+017F>tome,</hi> in <U+017F>everal of his Homilies, <U+017F>peaks again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e of his time, who made u<U+017F>e thereof to gain e<U+017F>teem; which a Clergy-man named <hi>Praetus,</hi> being de<U+017F>irous to acquire, by the means of <U+017F>uch a Coif, bought of a Midwife, he was very highly cen<U+017F>ur'd, as <hi>Bal<U+017F>amon</hi> affirms in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon the Canons of the Apo<U+017F>tles. And <hi>Paulus Jovius,</hi> an Author of great repute, ob<U+017F>erves, on the Nativity of <hi>Ferdinand Daval,</hi> that the Coif he brought with him from his Mothers Womb, contributed much to his being happy and belov'd of all. From all which we may make this inference, that there is nothing <U+017F>o extravagant, but may meet with Favourers and Abettors. For I may lay it down for certain, that this Opinion hath no other ground than what it hath found in the weak Brains of tho<U+017F>e Midwives, who having nothing in them but the name, have in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly <U+017F>catter'd the<U+017F>e errours into the Minds of the vulgar, with whom the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t being oblig'd to comply in matter of Language, it comes to pa<U+017F>s at la<U+017F>t, that what was before but a common <U+017F>aying, finds a degree of a<U+017F><U+017F>ent among the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. Nay, what is not any longer to be endur'd, they think it not enough to maintain this groundle<U+017F>s per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion, but there are <U+017F>ome <U+017F>o ridiculous, as to derive a new kind of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it, which they call <hi>Amniomantia,</hi> whereby they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e to foretel what-ever happine<U+017F>s or unhappine<U+017F>s <U+017F>hould befall a Child newly born, by the colour of that Membrane, whereof they affirm that the redne<U+017F>s <U+017F>ignifies good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, and that the blackne<U+017F>s or blewne<U+017F>s of it denotes the contrary. To which they add another kind of Divination, call'd <hi>Omphalomantia,</hi> which teaches them to judge by the knots of the <U+017F>tring, whereby the Child is fa<U+017F>ten'd to the After-burthen, how many Children more the Mother <U+017F>hall have; who, according to their judgement, will be Males if tho<U+017F>e inter<U+017F>ections be of a colour inclining to black, and Females if they be white; which Ob<U+017F>ervations are not only impertinent, but al<U+017F>o impious and <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That the common per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion, of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F>s attending Children born with the<U+017F>e Coifs, is well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, provided that it be taken in the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e wherein the Phy<U+017F>icians, who, in all probability, are more likely to be the Authors of it, than tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>imple Women who receiv'd it from them, would have it to be under<U+017F>tood; to wit, that tho<U+017F>e who thus born cover'd with that fortunate Membrane, (in regard they are not put to <U+017F>o much trouble, nor <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>o great violence in the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, by rea<U+017F>on of its being open and ea<U+017F>ie) come forth cloath'd out of their Mothers Wombs, without being oblig'd to leave behind them the Membranes, wherein they had been enclos'd in the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:66371:252"/>
Matrix; whereas mo<U+017F>t other Children are forc'd to quit them at their coming into the World, by rea<U+017F>on of the Ob<U+017F>tructions they meet with in their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through tho<U+017F>e narrow <U+017F>treights, which con<U+017F>equently, is <U+017F>o much the more painful and laborious to them, than it is to <U+017F>uch as are coifed, who are not to be imagin'd ever the more happy, as to the remainder of their lives, whereof the good or bad conduct are the true Cau<U+017F>es of their happine<U+017F>s or unhappine<U+017F>s, and not that Coif, which can neither produce nor <U+017F>ignifie them.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That tho<U+017F>e Children, who are born thus coifed, are not only more happy in their Birth, but they are al<U+017F>o <U+017F>uch in all the actions of their lives, as being commonly more peaceable, and of a more quiet Con<U+017F>titution, than <U+017F>uch as leave that Membrane within their former lodgings; who are accordingly more turbulent and re<U+017F>tle<U+017F>s, and, for that rea<U+017F>on, have not tho<U+017F>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inuations; whereby the former are recommended. For in the<U+017F>e, the moderation of their manners and demeanour con<U+017F>equent to that of their humours, gaining the hearts of all tho<U+017F>e with whom they conver<U+017F>e, rai<U+017F>es them into the general e<U+017F>teem of all, and <U+017F>o facilitates their acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion to Honours and Employments; it being certain, that there may be <U+017F>ome judgment made of the cour<U+017F>e of Life a Man is likely to take, by the deportment of his Child-hood; <U+017F>o is it no hard matter to give a ghe<U+017F>s at the <U+017F>ame, by that of the Infant, when he makes his fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ally out of his Mothers Womb, which is one of the mo<U+017F>t remarkable tran<U+017F>actions of his Life. Whence it may be inferr'd, that that fir<U+017F>t coming abroad being free from the trouble and agitation, whereof all others are <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, and which makes them forget their Ve<U+017F>ture which is left behind by the way, they ought accordingly to be di<U+017F>penc'd from the misfortunes incident to others, and enjoy a particular happine<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That the mo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>tle<U+017F>s and mo<U+017F>t turbulent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons, are commonly the mo<U+017F>t happy in this world, whereas tho<U+017F>e who endeavour to walk according to the <U+017F>trict rules of Mode<U+017F>ty and Re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F>s, do not carry on their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>o well, as the former do, who confidently attempt any thing, and imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves the favourites of Fortune. And thence it is that <U+017F>he, on the other <U+017F>ide, is <U+017F>o a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant to them, that though it be granted the Children born cloth'd are more meek and moderate than tho<U+017F>e who come into the World after the common rate, yet would the clean contrary to what is pretended follow from it. For, in<U+017F>tead of being cheri<U+017F>h'd by Fortune, it is <U+017F>eldom that <U+017F>he <U+017F>miles on them, but is much more kind to tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>tirring and tumultuary Spirits, who many times obtain greater favours of her than they dur<U+017F>t hope for, had they demean'd them<U+017F>elves towards her with le<U+017F>s earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s and importunity.</p>
            <p>The Sixth <U+017F>aid, That if every Man be the Artizan of his own Fortune, tho<U+017F>e who are of the be<U+017F>t Con<U+017F>titution and <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t Temper, ought to be more happy than others, who<U+017F>e irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:66371:253"/>
of humors does manife<U+017F>tly cau<U+017F>e that of their Actions and Fortunes. Now the Children born with Cawls and Coifs about them, <U+017F>eem to be le<U+017F>s vigorous, and of a weaker di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition than tho<U+017F>e who come into the World without any; ina<U+017F>much as the latter, being more earne<U+017F>t and violent, are no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the time of their Deliverance, but they courageou<U+017F>ly break through the Chains whereby they are detain'd, the Membranes whereby they are encompa<U+017F>s'd, which tho<U+017F>e others having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Strength nor Courage to do, it gives a great pre<U+017F>umpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they will expre<U+017F>s but little upon other more pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing occa<U+017F>ions, and con<U+017F>equently, they will content them<U+017F>elves with the mediocrity of their Conditions, and not a<U+017F>pire to any thing extraordinary.</p>

            <p>SO great is the Indulgence of Nature, that <U+017F>he thought it not enough to be<U+017F>tow Being and Exi<U+017F>tence on the things <U+017F>he hath produc'd; but <U+017F>he hath al<U+017F>o imprinted in them a <U+017F>trong Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to pre<U+017F>erve it, by fortifying them again<U+017F>t the a<U+017F><U+017F>aults of their Contraries, the pre<U+017F>ence whereof <U+017F>ets them on <U+017F>uch an edge, that they become <U+017F>o much the more active. And this is not only confirm'd in Animate Beings, <U+017F>uch as are Plants and Animals, which vigorou<U+017F>ly oppo<U+017F>e what-ever is hurtful to them, by <U+017F>o powerful a Vertue, that Men have been forc'd to find out a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular name for it, to wit, <hi>Antipathy</hi>; but al<U+017F>o in other Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Bodies, which generou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>tand upon the defen<U+017F>ive, when they are <U+017F>et upon by External Agents, who<U+017F>e contrary qualities coming to engage again<U+017F>t them, they redouble their Forces, and rally all together as it were into a Body, the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Charge. This is that which the Philo<U+017F>ophers call <hi>Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is,</hi> which is a vigorous re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Subject, caus'd by the contrariety of an Agent, which encompa<U+017F><U+017F>es it of all <U+017F>ides, purpo<U+017F>ely to de<U+017F>troy or corrupt it. It will be to no purpo<U+017F>e to enter into any Di<U+017F>pute concerning the Exi<U+017F>tence of that which we call <hi>Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is</hi>; but we <U+017F>hall lay it down for granted, though it be conte<U+017F>ted by <hi>Cardan</hi> and <U+017F>ome other Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophers, who maintain, that Water, Air, and the other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Bodies, are not actually colder at one time than at another, but only <U+017F>eem to be <U+017F>uch to our Sen<U+017F>es, which, though they <U+017F>hould be de<U+017F>titute of all qualities, are then endu'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, <U+017F>o that the <U+017F>ame Well-water which <U+017F>eems to be hot in Winter, by rea<U+017F>on of the coldne<U+017F>s that is in the Touching, <U+017F>eems cold in Summer, by rea<U+017F>on of the heat of the <U+017F>ame Organ, which judges of it comparatively. For the contrary is <U+017F>een, in
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:66371:253"/>
that Well-water, in Summer, being tran<U+017F>ported into a hot place, is there neverthele<U+017F>s cold; and the fumes and hot vapors which exhale from Springs and Wells in Winter, do <U+017F>ufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate, that, during the <U+017F>aid <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, the water is endu'd with a true and real heat, too <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible to be accounted imaginary. But this <hi>Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is</hi> is further more <U+017F>olidly confirm'd by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, whereby we <U+017F>ee that fire burns more violently, and is more <U+017F>parkling in great Fro<U+017F>ts, or in the <U+017F>hade, than in hot weather, or when it lyes expos'd to the beams of the Sun. In like manner, a little Water ca<U+017F>t upon a great Fire, makes it more violent than it was before; and the Ventricles of our Bodies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his Aphori<U+017F>ms, are hotter in Winter than in any other <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on of the year; whence it comes that we are apt to feed more plentifully, and Dige<U+017F>tion is then better perform'd. Nay, if we but go down into our Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, we <U+017F>hall find that the heat is more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible there in Winter; but in Summer, when all things are <U+017F>corch'd and burnt up on the <U+017F>urface of the Earth, all Subterraneous Places are <U+017F>o much the colder, the deeper they are, and the nearer they approach to the Centre; towards which, Cold, which is one of the natural qualities of the Earth, gathers together, and reunites it <U+017F>elf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that <U+017F>o it may be <U+017F>ecur'd from the heat, whereby it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compa<U+017F>s'd of all <U+017F>ides. And as it is to this, that the generation of Metals in the entrails of the Earth is principally attributed; <U+017F>o mo<U+017F>t of the Meteors which are fram'd in the two Regions of the Air, owe theirs to this <U+017F>ame Cold, which coming to encompa<U+017F>s, and as it were to enclo<U+017F>e the hot and dry Exhalation which makes the Winds, Lightning, Thunder, and Thunder-bolts, as al<U+017F>o that which makes the Comets in the Middle Region of the Air; the<U+017F>e unctuous and ea<U+017F>ily-enflam'd vapors, being encompa<U+017F>s'd of all <U+017F>ides, by the extream coldne<U+017F>s of that Air which enclo<U+017F>es them, they, in order to their Con<U+017F>ervation, re-unite, and take fire, after the <U+017F>ame manner as the Rayes of the Sun darted again<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome Opake Body, or reflected by Burning-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, <U+017F>et on fire the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olid Bodies, on which they are repercu<U+017F>s'd; as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who by <U+017F>uch an Artifice, con<U+017F>um'd the Ships of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who be<U+017F>ieg'd the City of <hi>Sarago<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Which in<U+017F>tance <U+017F>erves as well to prove <hi>Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is,</hi> as the manner whereby it is wrought, to wit, by the repercu<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Species of the Subject caus'd by its contrary. Thus then it comes, that the Water of Springs and Wells is cold in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in regard the Species of the cold, forc'd by the Water to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the heated Air which is all about it, are darted back again by that oppo<U+017F>ite heat to the place whence they came; whereupon being thru<U+017F>t clo<U+017F>er together, they there re-inforce and augment the Cold; which happens not <U+017F>o in Winter, when the Species of the coldne<U+017F>s of the Water, meeting with no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truction in the Air, endu'd with the like quality, in<U+017F>inuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves into it without any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and <U+017F>o not being reflected
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:66371:254"/>
nor forc'd back towards the Water, it is not then <U+017F>o cold as in Summer.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That the intentional Species, being not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign'd to act, but only to make a di<U+017F>covery of the beings from which they flow, as may be <U+017F>een in tho<U+017F>e of all <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Objects, which the<U+017F>e Species repre<U+017F>ent to the Organs that are to judge of them, cannot contribute any thing to the vigor of the action ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervable in the <hi>Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is</hi>; which he conceiv'd <U+017F>hould rather be attributed to the <U+017F>imple form of the Subject, which having an ab<U+017F>olute <U+017F>overeignty over the qualities employ'd thereby, in order to Action, renders them more or le<U+017F>s active, according to the need it <U+017F>tands in of them. And as <U+017F>eething Water taken off the Fire becomes cold of it <U+017F>elf, without any other a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance than that of its proper <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantial form, which hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of re-in<U+017F>tating it <U+017F>elf in that degree of Cold, which is naturally due unto it; <U+017F>o ought it with greater rea<U+017F>on to have an equal right of pre<U+017F>erving that <U+017F>ame quality, when it is a<U+017F><U+017F>ault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its contrary, Heat; without having any recour<U+017F>e to tho<U+017F>e Emi<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Species, which, though we <U+017F>hould grant the Tactile qualities (what is much in di<U+017F>pute) yet would not be able to cau<U+017F>e an <hi>Antiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is,</hi> ina<U+017F>much as being in<U+017F>eparable from them, if the intentional Species of the coldne<U+017F>s of Well-water were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards the warm'd Air, it <U+017F>hould take along with it the coldne<U+017F>s, and, con<U+017F>equently, it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o far from acquiring any new degree of coldne<U+017F>s thereby, that it would lo<U+017F>e much of that which it had before. For <U+017F>ince it is the Nature of the<U+017F>e Intentional Species to be otherwi<U+017F>e incapable, by rea<U+017F>on of their immateriality, of producing any Corporeal and Material Effect, <U+017F>uch as is the augmentation of the degrees of any active quality, as Heat and Cold are, there being not any contrariety between the Species thereof, no more than there is between tho<U+017F>e of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll other Bodies, whereof they are the Images, there is not any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on that obliges the Intentional Species of the Cold to retreat and clo<U+017F>e together, when they come to meet with tho<U+017F>e of Heat, or Heat it <U+017F>elf<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> no more than there is that the Species of this latter quality <U+017F>hould make the other more vigorous by their reflection.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That it mu<U+017F>t be acknowledg'd, that the Species of Cold and Heat, and the other fir<U+017F>t Qualities were not contrary among them<U+017F>elves, as being in their own Nature inalterable and incorruptible, as the other Intentional Species are, which come near the Condition of Spirits: Yet does it not follow thence, that the<U+017F>e Species cannot be reflected, ina<U+017F>much as the Vi<U+017F>ible Species, Light and Voice, which al<U+017F>o have no contraries, are not for that the le<U+017F>s re-percu<U+017F>s'd by Mirrours and other <U+017F>olid Bodies, or tho<U+017F>e hollow places which make Echoes.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That it is not <U+017F>ufficient, in order to the giving of a rea<U+017F>on of that effect, to attribute it to the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:66371:254"/>
form of every Agent, but it is to be referr'd to a <U+017F>uperiour cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>uch as is the Soul of the world; who<U+017F>e function it being to pre<U+017F>erve every thing in its intirene<U+017F>s, and to be a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, when it comes into any danger, as it happens when it is a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aulted by its contrary, then bent upon its de<U+017F>truction, there lies a certain engagement on this fir<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e, to relieve it in <U+017F>o great an extremity, by <U+017F>upplying it with new forces to help it out of that oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Thence it comes that our Cellars are warm in Winter, and cool in Summer, as are al<U+017F>o all other ground-rooms and low places; That Water <U+017F>hrinks up and frames it <U+017F>elf into little drops, when it is <U+017F>pilt on dry ground, whereas it <U+017F>preads abroad and is diffus'd in moi<U+017F>t places; That Lime is <U+017F>et on fire by the ca<U+017F>ting of water upon it; That the fire burns better in fro<U+017F>ty than in hot weather; That Wine drinks more cool out of a Gla<U+017F>s that had been warm'd; That the coldne<U+017F>s of Snow cau<U+017F>es an extraordinary heat in their hands who handle it; and, That generally all tactile qualities are rendred more active, by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition of their contraries, by rea<U+017F>on of the concour<U+017F>e, and the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance they then receive from that general Cau<U+017F>e, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it <U+017F>elf in their pre<U+017F>ervation. Of this we may give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance in Politicks, affirming, that the procedure of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Cau<U+017F>e is much like that of great Potentates, who, in a war between <U+017F>ome petty Princes or neighbouring States, if they find one party ready to be ab<U+017F>olutely ruin'd, <U+017F>upply it with <U+017F>uch forces as <U+017F>hall enable it to recover it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>o to bring the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral intere<U+017F>ts into an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> whereof there is as great a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity in Nature, which is kept up by that proportion, wherein all things find their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, as their de<U+017F>truction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds only from their di<U+017F>proportion and inequality.</p>
            <p>The Fifth <U+017F>aid, That we are not to look for the rea<U+017F>on of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiperi<U+017F>ta<U+017F>is</hi> any otherwhere, than in the Subjects them<U+017F>elves, wherein we find the action, who<U+017F>e inten<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s and augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are to be referr'd, not to that of the degrees of the active qualities, but to their compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion and reinforcement, which renders them more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, in regard they are more material, as may be <U+017F>eeen in a red-hot iron, the heat whereof burns much more violently, then that of a fire of Straw or <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <U+017F>ixth <U+017F>aid, That according to the principles which allow all things to participate of a certain degree of <U+017F>entiment, this conden<U+017F>ation, or compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the degrees of heat or cold, ought to be the effects of a <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive Agent, which having a knowledge of what may be hurtful or beneficial to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws within it <U+017F>elf the qualities which pre<U+017F>erve it intire, when it is pre<U+017F>s'd upon by others that are more violent, and <U+017F>uch as the meeting whereof might be prejudicial thereto, which it forces from it, in order to Action. And herein it is that the good of every thing con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts; ina<U+017F>much as every thing hath being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>o far as it hath action, when it is a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by friendly qualities, and the like; and by this means it is that Cold and Heat act more
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:66371:255"/>
vigorou<U+017F>ly, when they are oppos'd one to the other; and that our cavities are hotter in Winter, by rea<U+017F>on of the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Spirits and the natural Heat; which are the more diffus'd in Summer, in regard this latter goes to meet with its like, as a little fire is put out by a great one, and a weaker light ob<U+017F>cur'd by a clearer.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXXVIII. Of the Sympathetical Powder.</head>
            <p>THough this Powder be now as much out of e<U+017F>teem as it was in vogue, <U+017F>oon after the fir<U+017F>t finding of it out, for the expeditious curing of wounds: yet will it haply be a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ome advantage to examine their Motives, who fir<U+017F>t made, and publickly <U+017F>old it; as al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e of <U+017F>uch as have <U+017F>ometimes made u<U+017F>e of it with good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. And whereas novelty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a certain e<U+017F>teem to Remedies as well as to other things, <U+017F>o this <hi>Sympathetical Powder</hi> found <U+017F>o great belief at its fir<U+017F>t coming abroad, among Per<U+017F>ons addicted to a military life, who were immediately flatter'd with a <U+017F>peedy and ea<U+017F>ie curing of their mo<U+017F>t mortal wounds by the means thereof, without any trouble of making inci<U+017F>ions or dilatations, many times more painful then the hurt it <U+017F>elf, that we have had <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t Campagnes, though de<U+017F>titute of learning and experience, who had the <U+017F>ubtlety to rai<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a mi<U+017F>t before the eyes of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality with this Powder, that they concluded this remedy to be true balm, and the only <hi>Panacea,</hi> or <hi>All-heal</hi> of all wounds. But time having di<U+017F>cover'd the vanity of it, as al<U+017F>o the impo<U+017F>tures of tho<U+017F>e by whom it was <U+017F>o highly recommended, it hath been clearly found out, that there are few people in this age, but are either deceiv'd them<U+017F>elves, or make it their main bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others. For in fine, this Powder is as much cry'd down at pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> as ever it was cry'd up; and there is nothing left of it, but the in<U+017F>olent name of <hi>Sympathetical,</hi> impos'd upon it by the Authors thereof, in imitation of the Unguent of the <U+017F>ame name, wherewith <hi>Goclenius,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other Phy<U+017F>icians, endeavour'd to make good the <hi>Magnetick</hi> cure of wounds, wherein they only dre<U+017F>s'd the arms or other in<U+017F>truments, by which they were given, and apply'd the convenient remedies thereto. But in regard they could not always come at the arms, which had done the mi<U+017F>chief, to keep up their practi<U+017F>e, and to make the cure yet more ea<U+017F>ie, the<U+017F>e up<U+017F>tart Doctors be thought them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>ome years <U+017F>ince, of another expedient to compa<U+017F>s their de<U+017F>igns, that is, found out a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, wherewith they make it their boa<U+017F>t, that they will cure all <U+017F>orts of hurts, only by applying this powder to <U+017F>ome piece of Cloth, which had been us'd either to bind up, or make clean the wounded part. And whereas there are two kinds of wounds,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:66371:255"/>
one <U+017F>imple, which makes a <U+017F>olution of continuity in the <U+017F>oft and fle<U+017F>hy parts of the body, <U+017F>uch as are the veins, the arteries, the nerves, and the mu<U+017F>cles; the other, compound, which happens ih the <U+017F>olid parts, e<U+017F>pecially where bones are broken; the<U+017F>e Gentlemen have accordingly two different kinds of <hi>Sympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Powder</hi>; to wit, a <U+017F>imple, and a compound. The former is made with <hi>Roman Vitriol,</hi> which is our green and tran<U+017F>parent Coppre<U+017F>s, which they beat or pound not over <U+017F>mall, and di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing it upon papers, in <U+017F>uch quantities as they think fit, lay it in the Sun, when he makes his entrance into the fir<U+017F>t degree of the Sign <hi>Leo,</hi> and leaving it there for the <U+017F>pace of three hundred and <U+017F>ixty hours, which make ju<U+017F>t fifteen days, an<U+017F>werably to the like number of degrees, which that Planet travels over, in the <U+017F>pace of a year in the Zodiack. During this time it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd into an exqui<U+017F>ite whitene<U+017F>s, and then they take it in, and keep it carefully in <U+017F>ome temperate place, that is not too moi<U+017F>t, that is, <U+017F>uch as may not be likely to melt it, for fear it <U+017F>hould by that means lo<U+017F>e its vertue; for which rea<U+017F>on al<U+017F>o it is taken in during its calcination, in the cool of the evening, and in the night-time, and when the air is inclinable to rain, or over-moi<U+017F>t. But there mu<U+017F>t be a great care taken, that it be not <U+017F>tirr'd with any in<U+017F>trument of iron, when this powder is either in the preparation, or ready made up; the<U+017F>e Authors affirming, that it takes away its vertue, in<U+017F>tead whereof they order, that the Arti<U+017F>t <U+017F>hould make u<U+017F>e of a little Willow-<U+017F>tick, which is of great efficacy in the<U+017F>e magnetick cures. The compound Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetical Powder is made of the <U+017F>ame <hi>Vitriol,</hi> prepar'd after the <U+017F>ame manner, and the Gum called <hi>Tragacantha,</hi> exactly pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd, mixt together in equal quantities; in<U+017F>tead whereof, others put <hi>Gum-Arabick, Sarcocolla,</hi> the roots of the great <hi>Comfrey,</hi> and the five-leav'd <hi>Tormentile,</hi> or <U+017F>uch other vulnerary and a<U+017F>tringent Plants. However the<U+017F>e kinds of Sympathetical Powder may differ, as to the compo<U+017F>ition of them, yet in the u<U+017F>e of them, they ob<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame circum<U+017F>tances. For though the <U+017F>imple wound require the powder of the <U+017F>ame name, and the compound, where there is any fracture, requires the compound powder, yet is the manner of employing them <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame. And to that end, as well in wounds newly receiv'd, as tho<U+017F>e that are of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tanding, and degenerated into ulcers, they apply a clean cloth made of hemp or flax, to receive the blood from them, or the matter, wherewith being imbibed, they ca<U+017F>t the powder upon it, then fold up the cloth, inclo<U+017F>ing it in another; and being thus wrapp'd one in the other, they are laid up in <U+017F>ome temperate place, unle<U+017F>s it be when the wound is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly enflam'd, or very cold. If either of the<U+017F>e happen, they remove the cloths from the place where they were fir<U+017F>t laid, di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing them into <U+017F>ome cold place, <U+017F>uch as may be a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or <U+017F>ome other cool room; if the part affected be exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively hot; and on the contrary, into an Oven or Stove, if it be threatned
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:66371:256"/>
with a Gangrene, or the extingui<U+017F>hing of the natural heat; and they dayly continue the dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing of the<U+017F>e wounds after the <U+017F>ame manner, till they are perfectly cur'd; till which time they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pre<U+017F>erve all the cloaths imbu'd with the blood or matter that came from them. But what palpably di<U+017F>covers the vanity of this practice, is, that they affirm the wound to be perfectly cur'd by this means, how great a di<U+017F>tance <U+017F>oever there may be between the wounded part, and the Sympathetical Powder, which, they <U+017F>ay, equally produces its effect afar off as near at hand. Which is contrary to Rea<U+017F>on, whereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructed, that every agent being confin'd to certain limits in its action, beyond which it can do nothing; it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that this powder <U+017F>hould at <U+017F>o di<U+017F>proportionate a di<U+017F>tance, produce the effect which they would attribute thereto, nay though it were granted it might, if it were immediately apply'd to the place affected.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That if all Agents were oblig'd to follow that general Rule, whereby they are re<U+017F>train'd from acting otherwi<U+017F>e then upon the Subjects they touch, either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, or by <U+017F>ome vertue i<U+017F><U+017F>uing from them, it would be a very hard matter to give a rea<U+017F>on of the action of that Sympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Powder upon the wounds it cures, without making u<U+017F>e of the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of common Surgery, which are many times more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ufferable then the hurts about which they are employ'd. But <U+017F>ince there is a great number of the like in<U+017F>tances in Nature, it will be no harder ta<U+017F>k to find <U+017F>atisfaction in the cau<U+017F>es of this, then in tho<U+017F>e of all the re<U+017F>t, which act at a di<U+017F>tance, without any <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible tran<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion from the Agent to the Patient; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, of the Load<U+017F>tone, which draws iron to it; of the North-Star, which does the <U+017F>ame with the Load<U+017F>tone; of the Moon's cau<U+017F>ing the ebbing and flowing of the Sea; of the Sun's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting Metals and Minerals in the bowels of the Earth; and of an infinite number of others, which act upon <U+017F>ubjects at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, by certain occult qualities. Which qualities, in regard they are manife<U+017F>t and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible in the Loa<U+017F>tone, are commonly call'd Magnetick; <U+017F>uch as is al<U+017F>o the cure con<U+017F>equent to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this powder on the blood, or matter taken from the wound, which is thus treated <U+017F>ympathetically, and whereof the action is withall animated by that univer<U+017F>al Spirit, who<U+017F>e ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral interpo<U+017F>ition and concurrence being requi<U+017F>ite to all Agents, in order to the pro<U+017F>ecution and advancement of their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it may be concluded, that he does expre<U+017F>s it in this Powder, who<U+017F>e vertue he conveys to the wounded part, by means of the blood, which i<U+017F><U+017F>u'd from it, which though <U+017F>eparated from the body, there is however <U+017F>ome conformity and corre<U+017F>pondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and its whole.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That he thought it a very <U+017F>trange humour, to attribute to <hi>Roman Vitriol,</hi> and the Gum <hi>Tragacantha</hi> the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of curing that at a di<U+017F>tance, which they cannot do near at
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:66371:256"/>
hand, and that, being apply'd to the wounds about which they are employ'd. True it was that they were <U+017F>ometimes cur'd by that kind of procedure; but that it was not to be look'd on as a miracle wrought by the Sympathetical Powder, but as a pure effect of Nature; on which the curing of maladies principally depending, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirms, there needs no more for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting that of a wound, then to take away all heterogeneous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to reunite the gaping of the wound, and to keep it clean and at ea<U+017F>e; for the natural heat, with its balm, the radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture and the Spirits, will advance the cure in that condition, more then all the <U+017F>uppurating, mundifying, cathoeretick, and epu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letick medicines, which Art commonly makes u<U+017F>e of. Thence it comes, that the Ma<U+017F>ters of this new doctrine give a great charge, to tho<U+017F>e who would make u<U+017F>e of their Sympathetical Powders, to keep the wounds very clo<U+017F>e, after they have wa<U+017F>h'd them with Urine, Sal-water, or Wine, and to take away the <U+017F>plinters of the broken bones, as al<U+017F>o the clotted and congeal'd blood, and the other heterogeneous bodies which might hinder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union. And this indeed is no hard matter for them to do in the <U+017F>imple fle<U+017F>hy wounds; but they never could do it in tho<U+017F>e which are accompany'd with fractures, openings of great Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, hurts in <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>iderable part of the body, or <U+017F>uch other extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry accidents. Otherwi<U+017F>e that effect being above the reach of the remedy, which is incapable of producing that cure, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by that means, and after that manner, it cannot be wrought otherwi<U+017F>e then by vertue of a <U+017F>ecret compact with the evil Spirit, who will be forward enough to promote the welfare of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>hould make u<U+017F>e of this remedy, conditionally that they may run the hazard of de<U+017F>troying their <U+017F>ouls.</p>

            <p>NOvelty and things extraordinary, if we may credit the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of Artificial Memory, have <U+017F>o great a power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over our minds, that they do not only force them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, when the objects are pre<U+017F>ent, but do al<U+017F>o much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, and better con<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>pecies then ordinary things can. This it was that oblig'd diver<U+017F>e Poëts and Hi<U+017F>torians to <U+017F>peak of <hi>Hydra's, Chimaera's Ba<U+017F>ilisks, Satyrs, Centaurs,</hi> and <U+017F>everal other things invented out of plea<U+017F>ure or wantonne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>uch as have no ground in truth, and are pure poetical fictions. For tho<U+017F>e who have endeavour'd a more <U+017F>trict examination of the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have found the intermixture of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>pecies a thing impo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible, not only in re<U+017F>pect of the matter, which was to receive the

Whence it comes, that the Poet <hi>Lucretius</hi> <U+017F>peaks very learnedly, and affirms, that there cannot be any Centaurs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the rea<U+017F>on is the <U+017F>ame with that of Satyrs; nay the Generation of Satyrs, according to the rea<U+017F>on alledged by him, is much more impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible than that of Centaurs. Becau<U+017F>e, <hi><U+017F>aith he,</hi> if that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of a Man's and Hor<U+017F>e's nature were admitted, and it be withall <U+017F>uppos'd that Hor<U+017F>es are come to their full <U+017F>trength in three years, at which period of time Children are hardly taken from their Nur<U+017F>es brea<U+017F>ts, how is it to be imagin'd, that mon<U+017F>trous Animal <U+017F>hould be in its beginning and vigour at the <U+017F>ame time? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides, a Hor<U+017F>e being accounted old, when Man enters into his youth, how <U+017F>hould the one come to dye, when the other were arriving to his greate<U+017F>t vigour? Now Goats being <U+017F>horter-liv'd then Hor<U+017F>es, there is yet le<U+017F>s likelihood of feigning an Animal, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of a mixture of <U+017F>uch a nature and Man's. For which rea<U+017F>on, <hi>Pliny,</hi> in Book 7. of his <hi>Natural Hi<U+017F>tory,</hi> affirms, that a <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocentaur</hi> being foal'd in <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>aly,</hi> died the very <U+017F>ame day, and for the continuation of the miracle, was kept in hony (which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to be an excellent Balm) and publickly expos'd to the view of all. <hi>Virgil</hi> places them at the entrance of hell, upon this reflection, that <U+017F>uch things as are contrary to Nature cannot <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t. And St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in the Life of S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit, relating how a Centaur had appear'd to S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> que<U+017F>tions whether it were a real Centaur, or the evil Spirit, under <U+017F>uch a form, and in the pro<U+017F>ecution of his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>eems to conclude it a pure illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of the Devils, <U+017F>ince he drove it away with the Sign of the Cro<U+017F>s. So that we are not to attribute the<U+017F>e Satyrs to any thing, but the licentiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s which the Poëts have always a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd to them<U+017F>elves, as well as the Painters, to dare and undertake any thing, without any regard to the rule given them by <hi>Horace,</hi> not to make an intermixture and coincidence of <U+017F>trange and oppo<U+017F>ite nature; and that Satyrs, that is, half-men, half-goats, were to be di<U+017F>pos'd among the Hydra's and Chimera's, in as much as by them they would only repre<U+017F>ent men that were very active, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>civious, clowni<U+017F>h, and much inclin'd to railery: and thence al<U+017F>o the Satyrical Poëm came to have its denomination, as being a compo<U+017F>ition or farce of a Kitchin, whence <U+017F>ome would have it to de<U+017F>cend. Which fiction is <U+017F>ufficiently ju<U+017F>tify'd by the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they attributed to tho<U+017F>e Satyrical Animals, and by the other fabulous <U+017F>tories of <hi>Pan,</hi> whom they affirm to be the god of tho<U+017F>e Satyrs, as al<U+017F>o of the Shepherds. We are therefore to make no other account of this invention, then of all the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of their Imagination, what root <U+017F>oever they may have taken in the minds of the Ancients; in regard that being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examin'd it may be ranked among tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>en<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s Old-wives tales, wherewith they amu<U+017F>e little Children. Unle<U+017F>s we would rather refer the<U+017F>e Satyrs to the illu<U+017F>ion of Devils, who a<U+017F><U+017F>ume
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:66371:257"/>

            </p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd <U+017F>aid, that it was as dangerous for us to involve in impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities whatever we have not <U+017F>een, as to be over-credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in believing all. But when Rea<U+017F>on and Authority, which bring experience with them, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure us of a thing, appear of any <U+017F>ide, our credulity may well be excus'd. And this is the ca<U+017F>e, in the que<U+017F>tion concerning Satyrs, ina<U+017F>much as the concurrence of the <U+017F>eeds of tho<U+017F>e two <U+017F>pecies, whereof they con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, may as well produce them, as the Mule is engendred of an A<U+017F>s and a Mare. Whereto may be added this, as a general acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Nature hath not omitted any thing of that which might compleat her power, as having produc'd from Nothing, even to the mo<U+017F>t excellent Beings, whatever was to come into the mean between both. Be<U+017F>ides, though the Imaginations of Mothers were not capable of all things, and cannot imprint that figure and change of body on the Infant, nay to make what they pleas'd of it, whereof there are daily in<U+017F>tances, that <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do; yet the commonage of fields and forre<U+017F>ts, and <U+017F>uch nouri<U+017F>hment as the Children might have taken from Goats, as well as <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> did it from a She-Wolf, might, in proce<U+017F>s of time, incline them to <U+017F>uch or <U+017F>uch a form. Whereto it will <U+017F>ignifie little to oppo<U+017F>e the rea<U+017F>on of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> <U+017F>ince it <U+017F>eems erroneous, by what is commonly done in the ordering of Trees, which are promi<U+017F>cuou<U+017F>ly engrafted in different kinds, as for example, an Apple-tree may be in a Cabbadge-<U+017F>taulk. By which intermixture, the Apples growing on <U+017F>uch a Tree, <U+017F>hall not only have a little <U+017F>cent of the Cabbadge, but al<U+017F>o, that which is wor<U+017F>e always prevailing over that which is better, whereas the Apple-tree <U+017F>hould la<U+017F>t many years, and the Cabbadg is but of one, from the<U+017F>e two extremities there ari<U+017F>es a mean, to wit, a Tree which lives longer then a Cabbadge, and not <U+017F>o long as an Apple-tree <U+017F>hould: Which thing is al<U+017F>o to be ob<U+017F>erv'd ingraffing upon different kinds of Tree. Thence it comes that S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in the life of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit, <U+017F>peaking of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taur that appear'd to S. <hi>Anthony</hi> (for it is true, that the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of one of the<U+017F>e Mon<U+017F>ters proves that of the other; as the one being de<U+017F>troy'd, the other cannot <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t) does not affirm it to be a pure illu<U+017F>ion, but doubts whether it were a real Centaur, <U+017F>uch as tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>poken of among the Ancients, or a Devil that had a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd that form. But S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> took him for a Man, and not for a Devil whom he knew to be a Lyar, <U+017F>ince he ask'd him where the Servant of God, whom he <U+017F>ought for, lodged. Whereto the Centaur reply'd but in a <U+017F>avage voice, and <U+017F>uch as could not be under<U+017F>tood, whereupon he drew near to S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> and with his hand <U+017F>hew'd him the way he <U+017F>hould go, which done he ran away. Whence Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> concludes, that it is a hard matter to know, Whether the Devil had not appear'd under that Figure to frighten that holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on;
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:66371:258"/>
or that the De<U+017F>art, fruitful in Mon<U+017F>ters, had produc'd that Bea<U+017F>t. And <hi>Plato,</hi> in the Banquet of the <hi>Wi<U+017F>e-men</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that a certain Shepherd having pre<U+017F>ented <hi>Periander</hi> with a Child, brought forth at his hou<U+017F>e by a Mare, having the Head, Neck, and Hands like tho<U+017F>e of a Man, in all the other parts re<U+017F>embling a Hor<U+017F>e, and having the voice of a Child; <hi>Diocles</hi> propos'd, that <U+017F>uch Prodigies were the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Seditions, and Di<U+017F>traction of mens minds. Whereto <hi>Thales</hi> reply'd, that it was a natural thing, to prevent which for the future, he advis'd him to keep no Grooms but <U+017F>uch as were married. 'Tis al<U+017F>o the advice of <hi>Pliny,</hi> who in the <U+017F>eventh Book of his <hi>Natural History,</hi> affirms, that in the Country of the <hi>Cartadulones,</hi> among the Mountains of the <hi>Indies,</hi> there are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, a <U+017F>ort of very <U+017F>wift Animals, running <U+017F>ometimes on two feet, <U+017F>ometimes on all four, having a humane <U+017F>hape, and <U+017F>uch as by rea<U+017F>on of their activity are never taken, till they are old or <U+017F>ick. <hi>Plutarch</hi> al<U+017F>o affirms, in the Life of <hi>Sylla,</hi> that in his return from <hi>Italy,</hi> there was brought him a Satyr, like tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>crib'd by the Ancient Authors, half-man, and half-goat, which had been taken <U+017F>leeping. Being a<U+017F>k'd who he was, his An<U+017F>wer was in <U+017F>uch a Dialect as favour'd nothing of Man's Language, but in an articulate voice, between that of Goats, and the neighing of Hor<U+017F>es; and the re<U+017F>ult was, that <hi>Sylla</hi> taking compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of him, <U+017F>ent a Guard to conduct him to the place from whence he had been brought. The <U+017F>ame Author makes mention of the death of the God <hi>Pan,</hi> who was a Satyr. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> in the place before cited, affirms, that another Satyr <U+017F>poke; and he gives a de<U+017F>crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, <U+017F>aying, that he was of a middle <U+017F>tature, having a crooked No<U+017F>e, hornes on his fore-head, and feet like tho<U+017F>e of a Goat; and that he brought Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit <U+017F>ome Dates, not taken off the bough on which they had grown: Which kindne<U+017F>s obliges the Saint to a<U+017F>k him, Who he was? Whereto he made An<U+017F>wer, that he was a mortal, and one of the Inhabitants of that Hermitage, whom the abus'd <hi>Pagans</hi> adored for <hi>Fawnes, Satyrs,</hi> and <hi>Incubi.</hi> I come to you, <hi>continu'd he,</hi> as a Deputy from the re<U+017F>t of our Company, intreating you to pray for us to your God and ours, whom we acknowledge to be come into the world for the common <U+017F>alvation of all. Having with tho<U+017F>e words concluded his Emba<U+017F><U+017F>ie, the light-footed Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ran away. And that this Relation may <U+017F>eem the le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trange, we have this further to add, that in the time of <hi>Con<U+017F>tantine,</hi> there was one of them brought alive to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which was expos'd before the people at the publick Shews, and afterwards dying, his Body was <U+017F>alted, and tran<U+017F>ported to the City of <hi>Antioch</hi> to be <U+017F>hewn to the Emperour. <hi>Pau<U+017F>anias</hi> al<U+017F>o relates, that he had heard it of one <hi>Euphemius,</hi> who, he <U+017F>ayes, was a per<U+017F>on worthy of credit, that <U+017F>ailing into <hi>Spain,</hi> he was hurry'd by a Tempe<U+017F>t to certain I<U+017F>lands full of a <U+017F>avage kind of men, who had their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies all over hairy, long tails like tho<U+017F>e of Hor<U+017F>es, and red
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:66371:258"/>
hair, which they could not force away from about them, otherwi<U+017F>e then with blows; and that one of the Women-<U+017F>ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges having been left upon the <U+017F>hore by the Mariners, tho<U+017F>e Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges abus'd her with all imaginable violences. So that, to doubt whether there be any Satyrs, after <U+017F>o many Te<U+017F>timonies that there are, were to have too great a complyance for our own Sen<U+017F>es, and too little for the Te<U+017F>timonies of the Ancients.</p>

The like was done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> who thought it le<U+017F>s honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to be interr'd, then to be devour'd by Dogs and Birds of prey, e<U+017F>pecially Vultures, to which the Inhabitants of <hi>Colchos</hi> and <hi>Iberia</hi> expos'd the Carca<U+017F>es of tho<U+017F>e who in their life-time had done gallant actions, but always burnt tho<U+017F>e of the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly. Nay, what is ab<U+017F>olutely inhumane, (though <hi>Chry<U+017F>ippus,</hi> an ancient and eminent Philo<U+017F>opher, approves it in a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon that Subject) <U+017F>ome were <U+017F>o barbarous, as to eat the fle<U+017F>h of their Fathers, and Mothers, and be<U+017F>t Friends, out of a per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was one of the greate<U+017F>t demon<U+017F>trations of piety, to give their neare<U+017F>t Relations a burial in their own bellies. The <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> religiou<U+017F>ly pre<U+017F>erv'd them in their Hou<U+017F>es, after they had enclos'd them in wax, to prevent putrefaction: which was better done by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> with honey, <U+017F>alt, bitumen, ro<U+017F>in, cedar, aloes, myrrh, and <U+017F>uch perfumes, which have pre<U+017F>erv'd their
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:66371:259"/>
Mummyes to this time. The <hi>Scythians</hi> did the <U+017F>ame with ice and <U+017F>now, wherewith they cover'd the bodies of the deceas'd, to <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from corruption. The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> us'd, to the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e, the leaves of Poplar, Myrrh, and Aloes, wherewith they cover'd their dead; after which manner <hi>M. Cato</hi> de<U+017F>ir'd to be buried, as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was, in Olive-branches. The <hi>Aethiopians</hi> inclos'd theirs in Gla<U+017F>s; the <hi>Thracians</hi> and <hi>Troglodites</hi> put theirs under heaps of <U+017F>tones; the <hi>Hyperboreans</hi> and <hi>Icthyophagi</hi> buried them in the waves of the Sea; the <hi>Poeonians,</hi> in Lakes; and the Inhabitants of <hi>Caria</hi> though no Sepulchre more honourable for tho<U+017F>e who died for their Country, then that of their own Arms, wherein they buried them; as they did Per<U+017F>ons of Quality in the High-ways, that they might be the more con<U+017F>picuous, and e<U+017F>pecially in Mountains which were only for the burial of Kings; whence came the cu<U+017F>tom of erecting Obeli<U+017F>ks and Pyramids on their Tombes. But though there were a great diver<U+017F>ity in this kind of burying, yet it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted principally in this, that <U+017F>ome made choice of the Earth, others of the Fire, for their <U+017F>epul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The former is not only more natural and more rational, but al<U+017F>o more advantageous than the latter, <U+017F>ince there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more con<U+017F>onant to natural rea<U+017F>on, then to return to the earth tho<U+017F>e bodies; which having been fram'd thereof, cannot be better con<U+017F>ign'd then to the bo<U+017F>om of that Mother; wherein being once enclos'd, they infect not our Air with corruption and malignant exhalations, as they may when ca<U+017F>t into the fire, the heat whereof forcing the fumes and infected vapours of tho<U+017F>e Carca<U+017F>es to a great di<U+017F>tance, they may corrupt the purity of the Air, and prejudice their health who are pre<U+017F>ent at tho<U+017F>e funeral Piles, which, for that rea<U+017F>on, the Law of the Twelve Tables expre<U+017F>sly forbad to be <U+017F>et on fire within the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> le<U+017F>t the corruption might be communicated to the neighbouring Hou<U+017F>es, but provided it <U+017F>hould be done without the walls.</p>
            <p>The Second <U+017F>aid, That though the general way of burying the dead now is to enterre them, yet methinks that of burning them, and pre<U+017F>erving their a<U+017F>hes, is more noble and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in regard the Fire excells the Earth in purity, as far as it tran<U+017F>cends it in its vicinity to Heaven, the qualities whereof it communicates to the bodies it con<U+017F>umes, purifying and pre<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them from all putrefaction, and making them <U+017F>o clear and tran<U+017F>parent, that, according to the common opinion of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, in the general conflagration, the World and all bodies comprehended within it, will be vitrify'd, by means of the fire. It is therefore more honourable to have our bodies con<U+017F>um'd by that Element, then to have them devour'd by Worms and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction; whereof fire being an enemy, and the Embleme of Immortality, there can be no better expedient to <U+017F>ecure our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd Friends from oblivion, then that of burning their bodies, whereof we have either the bones or a<U+017F>hes left, which may be pre<U+017F>erv'd whole Ages; there being yet to be <U+017F>een the Urns of
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:66371:259"/>
the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> full of <U+017F>uch precious <hi>depo<U+017F>ita,</hi> as tho<U+017F>e who put their Friends into the ground can never <U+017F>ee. Add to this, that it is a rational thing to make a di<U+017F>tinction between Man Bea<U+017F>t, which they do not, who, burying both, treat them after the <U+017F>ame manner; whereas if Man's body were burnt, and that of the Bea<U+017F>t left to rot in the ground, it would <U+017F>erve for a certain acknowledgment of the di<U+017F>proportion there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and that as the latter is of a mean and de<U+017F>picable condition, it is accordingly di<U+017F>pos'd into the Earth, which is under the other Elements, and as it were the Common-<U+017F>hore of the World; whereas the former being de<U+017F>ign'd for Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, Fire, which is the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Hieroglyphick thereof is more proper for it then the earth; (wherein if we were not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd away rather by opinion than rea<U+017F>on, and that Tyrant of three Letters in the Latin Tongue, as a learned Author calls Cu<U+017F>tom, did not corrupt our judgment) it were more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to bury the bodies of Malefactors, then to burn them as is commonly done.</p>
            <p>The Third <U+017F>aid, That if we may judge of the goodne<U+017F>s of a thing by its Antiquity, the way of interring the dead will carry it, as having been from the beginning of the World. Holy Scripture tell us, that <hi>Abraham</hi> bought a Field for the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of him<U+017F>elf and his; and that a dead body having been di<U+017F>pos'd into the Sepulchre, where the bones of <hi>Elizeus</hi> were, was rais'd to Life. In other Hi<U+017F>tories we find, that mo<U+017F>t Nations practis'd it, e<U+017F>pecially the <hi>Romans,</hi> till the time of <hi>Sylla,</hi> who was the fir<U+017F>t who<U+017F>e Body was burnt at <hi>Rome</hi>; which di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of him<U+017F>elf he order'd, out of a fear he might be treated as <hi>Marius</hi> had been, who<U+017F>e bones he caus'd to be taken out of the ground, and ca<U+017F>t into the River. From that time they began to burn the Bodies of the Dead, which continu'd till the Reign of the <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi>'s, when the Cu<U+017F>tom of burying them came in again, and hath <U+017F>ince been us'd by all Nations, who<U+017F>e univer<U+017F>al con<U+017F>ent gives a great pre<U+017F>umption, that this manner is to be preferr'd before any other. Add to this, that our Saviour would have his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body <U+017F>o di<U+017F>pos'd, and the Holy Church, which is divinely in<U+017F>pir'd, <U+017F>eems to mind us of the <U+017F>ame thing, when, upon <hi>A<U+017F>h-wedne<U+017F>day,</hi> <U+017F>he tell us, that <hi>we are du<U+017F>t,</hi> and that into <hi>du<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hall return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth <U+017F>aid, That there were five ways of di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing the dead. One is, to put them into the ground; another, to ca<U+017F>t them into the water; the third, to leave them in the open air; the fourth, to burn them; and the la<U+017F>t, to <U+017F>uffer them to be devour'd by Bea<U+017F>ts. This la<U+017F>t is too inhumane to find any Abettors, but among <hi>Barbarians</hi>; Men are more careful to prevent the corruption of Water and Air, without which they cannot live, then to <U+017F>uffer carrions and dead carka<U+017F><U+017F>es, which would cau<U+017F>e infections and in<U+017F>upportable <U+017F>tinks; <U+017F>o that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t is only between Fire and Earth. For my part, I give the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:66371:260"/>
precedence to the former, who<U+017F>e action is more expeditious than that of the other Elements, which require a long time to con<U+017F>ume dead bodies; whereas Fire does it in an in<U+017F>tant. Whereto I may add this, that there cannot be any other more likely expedient, whereby men may <U+017F>ecure them<U+017F>elves from tho<U+017F>e contagious infections, which many times occa<U+017F>ion di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they are attended by Malignancy. Nay however, it is to be wi<U+017F>h'd, whether dead bodies be buried or burnt, that it <U+017F>hould be done out of the City, and that the Law of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviri,</hi> to wit, <hi>Hominem mortuum in urbe ne <U+017F>epelito, neve vrito,</hi> were <U+017F>till punctually ob<U+017F>erv'd.</p>
