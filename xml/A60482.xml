            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But in particular, they intimate
unto us a diver<U+017F>ity of their continuation to
divers per<U+017F>ons. Some men po<U+017F>t over this

continue therein much longer. Some have
but a few daies of labour and <U+017F>orrow, others
have them prolonged out to years. As
the Lord only knows what per<U+017F>on in the
world (for there are but few in the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t

Interpretations that are be<U+017F>ide the Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
you know I have already waved them,
and therefore <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>o much as mention
them in this ver<U+017F>e, nor in the whole en<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. As for tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ay, the

Stars, <U+017F>ignifie the <U+017F>everal Ages that man
mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s through, as was before hinted;
they make this Allegory, not <U+017F>o much a
de<U+017F>cription of old age, as of the way to it,
and therefore are not to be admitted: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<U+017F>much
as this is the de<U+017F>cription of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and perfected decrepit age, as you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64566:20"/>
have already heard. There are that take
the<U+017F>e Luminaries ab<U+017F>olutely literally, for
the <U+017F>everal heavenly bodies as they <U+017F>tand
fixed in their Orbs, and differing from one
another in glory. But unto man in this
<U+017F>tate they are not really darkned, for as
they communicate of their light and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
equally both to the good and bad, to
the ju<U+017F>t and unju<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o, to the young
and old, to the <U+017F>trong man, and to the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by rea<U+017F>on of his age. And then it
mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity be under<U+017F>tood, <hi>per Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palagen,</hi>
only that they appear <U+017F>o to them,
by rea<U+017F>on of their inability to receive their
light, and by rea<U+017F>on of the weakne<U+017F>s and
dimne<U+017F>s of their outward <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. And <U+017F>o
this opinion will in effect coincide with the
following, which is indeed mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And that is, that the<U+017F>e lights are
metaphorically here expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and do
principally allude to the lights of the body.
And this interpretation doth principally
and primarily ari<U+017F>e and take its authority
from the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphra<U+017F>e; which is by
Interpretation as followeth: <hi>Antiquam
mutetur <U+017F>plendor gloriae faciei tuae qui a<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulatur
<U+017F>oli, &amp; lumen oculorum tuorum

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64566:20"/>
antequam extinguentur.</hi> And after this, men
of very great names have walked in the
<U+017F>ame <U+017F>teps. But as mo<U+017F>t other Interpreters
<U+017F>eem to <U+017F>train the Metaphor too far, and
carry it beyond the <U+017F>ignification of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
parts of man; <U+017F>o the<U+017F>e <U+017F>eem to me
to draw it too <U+017F>traight, while they keep it
within the compa<U+017F>s of the external parts
of the body. And <U+017F>o much the rather,
becau<U+017F>e by this Expo<U+017F>ition is intimated only
the change of the countenance towards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
which is <U+017F>ufficiently el<U+017F>ewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed,
as you will hear anon; and the
dimne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>ight, which is far more

in this brief de<U+017F>cription the Wi<U+017F>e man
<U+017F>hould tautologize, is not to be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed.
On the other hand, it is not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that any infirmities appertaining to
this <U+017F>tate, e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e of the mind,
which are the greate<U+017F>t of all, <U+017F>hould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64566:21"/>
take upon him to de<U+017F>cribe any thing, and
do it but in part, and <U+017F>o deceitfully, that he
<U+017F>hould neglect the principal part, wherin
the great <U+017F>trength lyeth; but I am other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
per<U+017F>waded; that he hath here told us
all his heart, and that there is no remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
infirmity, either of body or mind, that
belongs to age, which is not contained in
this Allegory. Now fora<U+017F>much as all the
Symptomes in the four following ver<U+017F>es
belong properly to the parts of the body,
as you <U+017F>hall hear. I take this ver<U+017F>e to be a
de<U+017F>cription of the infirmities of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
powers of the <U+017F>oul; and why mo<U+017F>t Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
do on <U+017F>et purpo<U+017F>e avoid this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
which is <U+017F>o plain and obvious in
this place, I cannot tell, unle<U+017F>s it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
they are <U+017F>o much taken up with the
contemplation of the <U+017F>oul of man, that
they forget it hath any thing at all to do
with the body. There is a va<U+017F>t difference
between the <U+017F>oul of man as it is in its united
<U+017F>tate, and as it is in its <U+017F>tate of <U+017F>eparation. It
is not <U+017F>ent from heaven into the body as an
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant only, or like <U+017F>ome tutelar angel, with
Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion and full power to guard, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
and coun<U+017F>el that per<U+017F>on, towards which
it is for a <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on the deputed Mini<U+017F>ter.
For if <U+017F>o only, then it might recount and
tell us, how curiou<U+017F>ly it wrought for us in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64566:21"/>
the lower parts of the earth, and what
wonderful <hi>Idaea's</hi> it had before it, to have
done further for us in that dark<U+017F>ome regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
had we been capable to receive them;
yea, then it might accompany us beyond
our pilgrimage, remaining in the body even
after di<U+017F><U+017F>olution, and taking care for our
burials.</p>
               <p>But the Ca<U+017F>e is far otherwi<U+017F>e, it is <U+017F>ent to
inform the matter, and together with it to
make up one <hi>Compo<U+017F>itum,</hi> the man being
not the one, nor the other; but mo<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
that which doth ari<U+017F>e from the perfect

predicable of the whole, is predicable of
the parts united; what<U+017F>oever may be <U+017F>aid
of the man, may be <U+017F>aid of the body and
<U+017F>oul united; and as they are throughly

doth exerci<U+017F>e its principal faculties,) and

the inward man of nature, and the inward
man of grace; there is the inward man of
the fir<U+017F>t birth, and the inward man of the
<U+017F>econd birth, or of Regeneration. Now
I <U+017F>peak here concerning the former of the<U+017F>e,

Among many other truths this place doth

to divide or di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h between the

between them; <U+017F>uch an one, as in <U+017F>ome
mea<U+017F>ure bears proportion with that, which
is between the joynts and the marrow.
Now becau<U+017F>e this latter of the parts of the
body, (though hard in it <U+017F>elf,) yet is far

this, and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly it may give us <U+017F>ome
light to the other. The joynts are the
turning places of the body, upon which
all the actions of the limbs are performed,
and therefore they are articulated <U+017F>everal

                  <p>The fir<U+017F>t, are <U+017F>peculative, the la<U+017F>t, are

And we are not to multiply faculties

they <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed the operations about

<hi>His bow abode in <U+017F>trength, the arms of his

                     <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 24.</note> And as if there

defence, and deliverance, the<U+017F>e mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are almo<U+017F>t alwaies mentioned, and
mo<U+017F>t frequently attributed to God him<U+017F>elf;
<hi>They got not the Land into po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>sion by their

if there be any impotency in the hands and
arms, a man is no longer able to defend
him<U+017F>elf; <hi>Job</hi> hath a mo<U+017F>t remarkable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion
to confirm this truth; If ever he
u<U+017F>ed his defence and help to oppre<U+017F>s the
Fatherle<U+017F>s, he wi<U+017F>heth that now he might

<hi>If I have lift up my hand again<U+017F>t the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s

they may be <U+017F>aid to keep the hou<U+017F>e, in that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64566:37"/>
they provide for it, getting maintenance
for the whole body, for by working they
get bread.<note place="margin">2 The<U+017F>. 3. 10. Acts 20. 34.</note>

do defend the hou<U+017F>e, and provide for it;
<U+017F>o al<U+017F>o they do offend whom<U+017F>oever would
hurt it; they do not only get, but protect,
and al<U+017F>o keep off the adver<U+017F>ary. And all
this was done at once by the power of the
hands of the Jews in their great nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity,
when they were rebuilding the Temple,
their hands were throughly filled, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in a double defence; <hi>For they which
builded on the wall,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Neh. 4. 17</note> 
                     <hi>and they that bare burdens,
with tho<U+017F>e that laded, every one, with one of
his hands wrought in the work, and with the
other hand held a weapon.</hi> Now <U+017F>uch, through
the wi<U+017F>dom of God, is the dexterity of the
hand, that it can employ a weapon to be a
better defence to a man, than what<U+017F>oever
is naturally allotted to any creature be<U+017F>ide.
And that audacious Carper at the works of
God (who complained that other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
had naturally a defence given, and
man only left weaponle<U+017F>s) was <U+017F>ufficiently
<U+017F>ilenced, when it was told him; Man had
rea<U+017F>on and hands, which together, can
make a better defen<U+017F>ive or offen<U+017F>ive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

unto what Anatomy doth give <U+017F>ufficient

of the truth of this matter. If we
con<U+017F>ider on the part of the bones, fir<U+017F>t the
<hi>Scapula,</hi> and take notice that it is <U+017F>eated
in the <U+017F>trong part of the back, with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of motion in its place, in which it is
contained by the <hi>Clavicle,</hi> and with great
advantage of moving the arm which way
<U+017F>oever it plea<U+017F>eth; that it is formed with

for the better <U+017F>eat of the mu<U+017F>cles, and
command of them to their appointed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
that it is articulated to the <hi>humerus
per Arthrodiam,</hi> wherein the Cavity is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate
to the head of the <hi>humerus,</hi>
that the <U+017F>houlder may thereby with greater
facility and liberty admit of all manner of
motion, which it could not po<U+017F>sibly have
done, had this articulation been any firmer
and clo<U+017F>er in it <U+017F>elf. Now that this joynt
may be kept from luxation, either from it
<U+017F>elf, or from any thing might fall upon it,
to which it was very liable by rea<U+017F>on of
what was before <U+017F>aid; It is <U+017F>ufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by a very thick, and nervous liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and by the broad Tendons of four
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64566:38"/>
great Mu<U+017F>cles; which do <U+017F>o <U+017F>trictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F>s
about the joynt, that by its own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though never <U+017F>o violent, it cannot be
put out; and al<U+017F>o by the Clavicle or ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
bone, which is <U+017F>o directly laid cro<U+017F>s
over it, that it defends it from all external
violence what<U+017F>oever. Again, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
the <hi>humerus,</hi> its head, its neck, its
pullyes, its Cavities, its Extuberances;
If we con<U+017F>ider the <hi>Cubitus,</hi> and the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
and their divers articulation; the
one being <hi>per ginglymum,</hi> which gives
flection and exten<U+017F>ion with <U+017F>trength; the

I cannot pa<U+017F>s the thumb in the general

and al<U+017F>o in its repute, may be <U+017F>aid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
chiefly to the keeping of the hou<U+017F>e;
for it is equivalent to all the fingers, and
therefore in Latine is called, <hi>Pollex, à pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendo,</hi>
being as it were an antagoni<U+017F>t gra<U+017F>per
to the whole hand, and doth as much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the firm holding and dextrous u<U+017F>ing

                     <note place="margin">Judg. 1. 7.</note> Thus far on the

out-<U+017F>tripping the volubility of the mind:
If we yet further con<U+017F>ider them in their

they are either <U+017F>olid, plain, round, broad,
long, <U+017F>hort, one, many; or of what<U+017F>oever

                  <p>I <U+017F>ay, if we con<U+017F>ider the<U+017F>e wonderful

The bone of the thigh, is of all other

<U+017F>u<U+017F>tain and bear the whole weight of the

proce<U+017F><U+017F>es; The fir<U+017F>t is the great and
the round head, which is in<U+017F>erted into the

which admits of all manner of motion,

the fir<U+017F>t is common, broad, thick,

and being in<U+017F>erted <U+017F>trictly into the

the <hi>Trochanters,</hi> the le<U+017F><U+017F>er, and the

is called the neck of the <hi>Femur,</hi> which is
<U+017F>o framed for the more convenient lodging
of the Mu<U+017F>cles, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64566:43"/>
(<hi>viz.</hi> the Arteries, Veins, Nerves,) for
the u<U+017F>e and benefit of the <U+017F>ubjected parts.
Its form al<U+017F>o is mo<U+017F>t remarkable, in that
it is on the external or forepart, gibbous or
bunching outward; on the internal or hind
part, <U+017F>imous or bending inwards, which
frame doth wonderfully conduce to the
conveniency of <U+017F>itting, to the firmne<U+017F>s
of <U+017F>tanding, and to the dexterity of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>La<U+017F>tly, It is articulated to the <hi>Tibia, per
laxum ginglymum,</hi> which adds very much
to the expedition in motion, and is of <U+017F>uch
a frame, that on the back part it leaves a
mo<U+017F>t convenient hollow place, which we
call <hi>Poples,</hi> the ham, for the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing down
of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; and on the fore part it is
wonderfully defended by the <hi>Patella,</hi> or
knee pan, as by a <U+017F>hield, the form, and
name of which, this bone doth continually
bear. And it is <U+017F>o much the more to be
ob<U+017F>erved, in that no <U+017F>uch bone is in the
<U+017F>uperiour <hi>Artus,</hi> nor in the whole body
be<U+017F>ides; for it is articulated to no bone at
all, but is kept in its place by a double Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament,
the one inward, which is that
round, bloudy Ligament, which firmly
annexeth it to the thigh; the other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which is the Conjunction of the
Tendons of the four Mu<U+017F>cles which extend
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64566:44"/>
the <hi>tibia,</hi> which together make a broad
Ligament that doth encompa<U+017F>s the whole
knee, and <U+017F>trongly bind it in its place;
wherein it exceedingly conduceth to the
defending of the joynt, over which it is
placed. For that Articulation being loo<U+017F>e
in it <U+017F>elf (as was before <U+017F>aid) would be very
apt to luxation in <U+017F>udden and great flexures
of the knee, or in going down <U+017F>teep places;
were it not by this <U+017F>hield bone abundantly
<U+017F>trengthned, and <U+017F>ufficiently defended from
all tho<U+017F>e inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Conjunction of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula,</hi>
being otherwi<U+017F>e than that of the
<hi>Radius,</hi> which an<U+017F>wereth it in the arm; is
well worth our ob<U+017F>ervation to our pre<U+017F>ent
purpo<U+017F>e; the <hi>Radius</hi> of the arm is Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
(as you have heard before) <hi>per
Arthrodiam</hi> to the <hi>Humerus,</hi> which renders
it more expeditious as to <U+017F>everal motions,
and therefore more properly a keeper of
the hou<U+017F>e; but the <hi>Fibula</hi> is not at all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulated
to the <hi>Femur,</hi> but is affixed to the
external part of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> and doth <U+017F>tand
as it were an underprop to that, whereby
they may joyntly with greater <U+017F>trength
<U+017F>upport the whole body, and be the more
ju<U+017F>tly called, <hi>the <U+017F>trong men.</hi> There is yet
one ob<U+017F>ervation more from the Anatomy
of the<U+017F>e parts, that doth with great delight
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64566:44"/>
and content demon<U+017F>trate, that tho<U+017F>e are
the keepers of the hou<U+017F>e, and the<U+017F>e the
<U+017F>trong men, and that is from the variety
of their flexures; the hand in all its <U+017F>everal
joynts, is bended one and the <U+017F>ame way;
the <U+017F>houlder is bended inward, or foreward,
and extended outward or backward; <U+017F>o
al<U+017F>o is the Arm, the Hand, the Fingers,
and this is for the better apprehending and
comprehending any thing, and u<U+017F>ing any
defence; and therefore they are the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the hou<U+017F>e: The foot is bended in
its <U+017F>everal joynts, <U+017F>everal waies; one, one
way; and another, another; the thigh is
bended forward, the leg is bended back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
and again, the foot is bended for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and the toes are bended backward;
and this is for the greater coveniency of
going, and for the firmer <U+017F>tanding, and
therefore the<U+017F>e are the <U+017F>trong men.</p>
                  <p>We might yet further and principally
confirm this thing, by the <U+017F>everal forms
and u<U+017F>es of the Mu<U+017F>cles of the<U+017F>e parts; for
it is not <U+017F>o much great bones, nor great
veins, nor a great deal of bloud or fat, that
makes a man <U+017F>trong; but great, and <U+017F>trong,
and eminent Mu<U+017F>cles, they are the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicators
of <U+017F>trength. Now the<U+017F>e parts of
the body have bigger, <U+017F>tronger, and more
rai<U+017F>ed Mu<U+017F>cles than any be<U+017F>ide; and by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64566:45"/>
how much the higher the Tendons of the
Mu<U+017F>cles are rai<U+017F>ed, with <U+017F>o much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>trength mu<U+017F>t they needs perform their
Offices, and <U+017F>o much the more declare the
<U+017F>trength of a man; and therefore we have
an ordinary ob<U+017F>ervation, and a probable
one, to judge of a mans <U+017F>trength, or
weakne<U+017F>s, by the elevation or depre<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of the Calves of his legs. I might al<U+017F>o
add many more ob<U+017F>ervations of the like
kind; but I de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, fora<U+017F>much as a good

                  <p>And becau<U+017F>e the great <U+017F>trength of a man
lyeth in the<U+017F>e parts, therefore in his infirm

I judge there is one grand <U+017F>ymptome of

is principally aimed at; and that is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion,
crookedne<U+017F>s, abbreviation, and
alteration of the po<U+017F>ition, of the <U+017F>everal
joynts of the<U+017F>e parts; and their inability
of being reduced to a firm, <U+017F>trait, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
po<U+017F>ture, wherein the <U+017F>trength of a
man doth wholly con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t. And it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful

man at his be<U+017F>t and <U+017F>tonge<U+017F>t e<U+017F>tate, <U+017F>hould
be kept in that bending po<U+017F>ture, which age
nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily binds every man unto; he, in
that condition, were <U+017F>carce able to go, or
<U+017F>tand, without the help of a <U+017F>taff; and the
rea<U+017F>on of it is plain, becau<U+017F>e the Center of

of the feet; but hangeth as a weight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and therefore had need of another
<hi>Fulciment,</hi> upon which it might the more
firmly re<U+017F>t. And therefore it is <U+017F>aid of old
men: <hi>Membra levant baculis;</hi> when the<U+017F>e
members are perverted in their joynts, and
the tone of the Mu<U+017F>cles is <U+017F>o much relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they are unable to bring them to
<U+017F>traitne<U+017F>s again, there is great need of the

<U+017F>upport of a <U+017F>taff; for without it, there is
an utter inability of going <U+017F>teadily, and

and that there can be no other in
this place intended, <hi>this pre<U+017F>ent Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,</hi>
I hope will make appear. Grinding all
men know to be performed by two hard
bodies, the one immoveable, upon which
the grinding is made; the other moveable,
which by <U+017F>trong Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion again<U+017F>t the
former, and by its motion, makes the
grinding; <U+017F>o that to it, there is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
both the<U+017F>e, <hi>viz.</hi> the firm <U+017F>tander, and the
<U+017F>trong mover; the upper, and the nether
mil<U+017F>tone, as we have them often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in Scripture;<note place="margin">Deut. 24. 6.</note> now an<U+017F>werable unto
the<U+017F>e in the mill, there are for that grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which is performed in the mouth; two
jaw bones, which are called the upper and
nether <hi>Mandible.</hi> The upper Mandible,
is compounded of eleven <U+017F>everal bones,
which among them<U+017F>elves, and to tho<U+017F>e ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64566:46"/>
are joyned either <hi>per <U+017F>uturam,</hi> or
<hi>harmoniam,</hi> which admit of no motion at
all, and therefore this <U+017F>tands firmly in its
place, and is that immovable mil<U+017F>tone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the grinding is made; the nether
Mandible is one <U+017F>ingle, hard, and <U+017F>trong
bone, who<U+017F>e Articulation is very loo<U+017F>e, for
the greater liberty of motion; and it hath
two or three pair of Mu<U+017F>cles, e<U+017F>pecially
the <hi>Temporal,</hi> which <U+017F>trongly bring it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
for the clo<U+017F>er acting again<U+017F>t the

Mu<U+017F>cles, called, the <hi>Ma<U+017F><U+017F>eters,</hi> and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from a double original, and beyond
all others of the body what<U+017F>oever, have
their <U+017F>everal Fibres <U+017F>o cro<U+017F><U+017F>ing and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
one with another, that they are <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
in<U+017F>erted into this lower Mandible,
and <U+017F>o are able to move it upward; to the
right, to the left; forward, backward, and
con<U+017F>equently round about, and <U+017F>o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
that action which we call Ma<U+017F>tica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or chewing, and therefore this is that
other movable mil<U+017F>tone which makes the
grinding.</p>
                  <p>Now out of both the<U+017F>e, equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on of them a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <U+017F>mall bones which we call the
Teeth; which how<U+017F>oever they may be
numbred among the bones, yet they have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64566:47"/>
one or two e<U+017F>pecial properties which are
competible to no other bones of the body,
(at lea<U+017F>t in that mea<U+017F>ure,) whereby they
are principally adapted for the grinding.</p>
                  <p>The fir<U+017F>t is, they are naked, they have
no covering or skin upon them, no not <U+017F>o
much as that common Membrane, called,
the <hi>Perio<U+017F>tion,</hi> which doth encompa<U+017F>s all
the bones of the body be<U+017F>ide; and that is
becau<U+017F>e they might the better atting one
anothers bodies, and in their attrition
one again<U+017F>t another they might feel no pain;
but I mu<U+017F>t needs here take notice that the
words of <hi>Job</hi> <U+017F>eem to be again<U+017F>t me, where
he <U+017F>aith,<note place="margin">Job 19. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>I have e<U+017F>caped with the skin of my
teeth;</hi> This is ea<U+017F>ily an<U+017F>wered, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
the two parts of the Teeth, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Ba<U+017F>is,</hi> and the <hi>Radix; that,</hi> is the part
which eminently appears white above the
Gums; <hi>this,</hi> is that part which is within
the Gums, and <U+017F>tands fixed in the Mandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
Now by <hi>Jobs</hi> skin or covering of
his teeth, it is apparent he meant the gums
which cover the roots of the teeth; his
<U+017F>ores, and his boyls were <U+017F>o great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
upon him, from the <U+017F>ole of his foot
to his Crown, that there was no part of
the skin of his body to be <U+017F>een, but only
about his teeth, which in all <U+017F>uch Cutaneous
di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es doth for the mo<U+017F>t part wholly
e<U+017F>cape.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:64566:47"/>
The <U+017F>econd is, they have the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els
which convey life and <U+017F>en<U+017F>e unto them,
contained only in the inward parts, that the
outward parts may be freer and better to
grind.</p>
                  <p>The third is, that they are growing or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ing
<U+017F>o long as man lives, <U+017F>o that what
is worn away of them by their continual
attrition and manducation; is dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
otherwi<U+017F>e they would grow <U+017F>horter
and <U+017F>moother, and not be <U+017F>o able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their work; and this is a wonderful
piece of the wi<U+017F>dom of God in nature,
which Art cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly reach unto;
and therefore becau<U+017F>e they cannot make
their mills grow, as they dayly decay by
grinding; they are fain to <U+017F>upply that
want, by often pecking their mil<U+017F>tones,
and at length changing them; and by tho<U+017F>e
means as it were renew their teeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they were able to do nothing
at all.</p>
                  <p>The la<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hall mention is, that the teeth
of all the bones of the body are the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>t,
and will <U+017F>uffer the lea<U+017F>t from any
other bodies what<U+017F>oever, and therefore are
the fitter for <U+017F>uch a work as this. A mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tone
is of all other <U+017F>tones <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be
the harde<U+017F>t, and therefore <hi>Job</hi> when he
had expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hardne<U+017F>s of the heart of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64566:48"/>
the Leviathan by a <U+017F>tone; as if he had not
<U+017F>aid enough, he farther adds one degree
more, yea, <U+017F>aith he, <hi>As hard as a piece of
the nether mil<U+017F>tone.</hi> The<U+017F>e <U+017F>hort ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may <U+017F>uffice to teach us in the general,
that the teeth al<U+017F>o may be called the grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
If we yet more particularly con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, and how they may be divided,
we <U+017F>hall have a farther light into this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The teeth are of three kinds, either
<hi>Inci<U+017F>ores, Canini,</hi> or <hi>Molares:</hi> The fir<U+017F>t
are the broad fore-teeth; the <U+017F>econd are
the next round teeth, which are u<U+017F>ually
called the eye-teeth; the la<U+017F>t are the great
double and hindermo<U+017F>t teeth; the fir<U+017F>t,
bite or cut the food; the <U+017F>econd, break or
brui<U+017F>e the food; the la<U+017F>t, chew or grind
the food. And this di<U+017F>tinction al<U+017F>o may
be found in Scripture, the fir<U+017F>t are alluded
to, where it is <U+017F>aid, <hi>The Prophets bite with
their teeth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mic. 3. 5.</note> The <U+017F>econd, where it is <U+017F>aid,
<hi>He hath the cheek teeth of a Lion:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joel 1. 6.</note> And
both the<U+017F>e, where it is <U+017F>aid, <hi>There is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration

jaw teeth as knives.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov 30: 14.</note> The la<U+017F>t is alluded to,
where it is <U+017F>aid, <hi>While the fle<U+017F>h was yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their teeth, ere it was chewed, the
wrath of the Lord was kindled again<U+017F>t the
people.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 11. 33.</note> They had bit the fle<U+017F>h of the
Quails, and had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed it from the fir<U+017F>t
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64566:48"/>
teeth, to the la<U+017F>t, which are the grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and there it <U+017F>tuck till they died. And
thus at length we are fallen upon the true,
proper, and <U+017F>trict in<U+017F>truments of grinding;
we have hitherto been <U+017F>hewing the whole
frame of the mill, and how <U+017F>everal parts
do wonderfully contribute towards this
work, and now we are come to tho<U+017F>e parts,
wherein the clo<U+017F>e pinch of grinding lieth,
and that is in the great, broad, and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
teeth, which from the day of the
writing of this Allegory, to this pre<U+017F>ent
time, have ever among Anatomi<U+017F>ts retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the name of grinders.</p>
                  <p>And that not without exceeding good
rea<U+017F>on, for the form and figure of the<U+017F>e,
above the re<U+017F>t doth abundantly <U+017F>hew that
the<U+017F>e are the fitte<U+017F>t of them all for this
work; for the<U+017F>e are bigger, larger, broader
every way; e<U+017F>pecially at the top, where their
form is much-what like to that of a mill,
where al<U+017F>o they have eminent a<U+017F>perities, &amp;
protuberances, exactly an<U+017F>werable to the
roughne<U+017F>s of the Mil<U+017F>tones; by which the
grinding is far more ea<U+017F>ily and perfectly
performed; be<U+017F>ide, the<U+017F>e are more firmly
inclavated, and infixed into the jaw bones,
by treble, or quadruble roots; whereas
all the re<U+017F>t are but by <U+017F>ingle, or double at
the mo<U+017F>t; and being more <U+017F>trongly rooted,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64566:49"/>
they are the fitter for more eminent <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
La<U+017F>tly, and chiefly, the experience
of every man doth <U+017F>ufficiently confirm
that this is the proper u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e teeth;
and that the more <U+017F>olid food which needs
greater manducation, cannot be <U+017F>ufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comminuated for chyle, or ground low
enough for the <U+017F>tomack, untill the<U+017F>e teeth
have done this work upon it. And thus it
is plain, that the jaws, and teeth, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t mentioned, are appo<U+017F>itely
and elegantly called the grinders; which
how much <U+017F>ervice they do to man while
u<U+017F>able, and how much detriment and lo<U+017F>s
they bring upon him when they cea<U+017F>e from
their u<U+017F>e, is well known to all men.
<hi>Strong meat belongeth to men of full age,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 14</note>
<U+017F>aith the Author to the Hebrews. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them, and only to them, becau<U+017F>e
they alone, have, as I may <U+017F>o <U+017F>ay, their
mill in tune, their mouth full of <U+017F>trong
teeth, and <U+017F>et directly one again<U+017F>t another,
whereby they may bring the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t meat
into a meet con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, and a due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for ea<U+017F>ie dige<U+017F>tion in the <U+017F>tomack.
But it may here be <U+017F>aid, there are many
Creatures that are not thus <U+017F>trongly armed,
and have not <U+017F>o many teeth, nor tho<U+017F>e
they have <U+017F>o well <U+017F>et, as your po<U+017F>ition
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>eth they <U+017F>hould be, for the due
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64566:49"/>
preparation of the meat; And the<U+017F>e are
the Sheep, the Goat, the Cow, the Deer,
and all other Creatures that have teeth
only on the lower Jaw, and none at all on
the upper. The<U+017F>e have no antagoni<U+017F>t grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
nor contra-acting mil<U+017F>tones, and yet
the<U+017F>e Creatures in their full age, eat as
<U+017F>olid food, and as hard of dige<U+017F>tion, and
withall, do as well with it, as they that
are better provided in this re<U+017F>pect; to this
I mu<U+017F>t needs an<U+017F>wer, it is very true, <U+017F>o that
from hence we may take occa<U+017F>ion to admire
the wi<U+017F>dom of God in the various forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <U+017F>everal Creatures, tending not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
to the u<U+017F>e and benefit of them
all. However this in the<U+017F>e Creatures is a
want, and mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>tood for a want, had
they not been abundantly <U+017F>upplyed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
kind. For all tho<U+017F>e Creatures that
are thus deficient in their teeth, and only
tho<U+017F>e; are they which chew the Cud,
which is a rea<U+017F><U+017F>uming the food into the
mouth, and a grinding of it a fre<U+017F>h the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

at twice, and to be three or four times as
long about it, as tho<U+017F>e creatures who<U+017F>e grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are better placed; neither would this
<U+017F>uffice alone, for if they <U+017F>hould be chewing

to the <U+017F>tomack with the <U+017F>ame hopes of <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s,
that in other Creatures that are
toothed on both <U+017F>ides, it is committed at
the fir<U+017F>t: Now, man being in the number
of the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t mentioned, mu<U+017F>t for the due
preparation of all <U+017F>trong food, tru<U+017F>t alone
to his grinders; <U+017F>o that the time of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactation

of the diet of the old man, is mo<U+017F>t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
indicated by the beginning and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
of the u<U+017F>e of the Teeth; milk is fit for

when their teeth decay,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 14.</note> are again <hi>become <U+017F>uch
as have need of milk, and not of <U+017F>trong meat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by the cea<U+017F>ing of the teeth we mu<U+017F>t
under<U+017F>tand, all tho<U+017F>e infirmities that are
incident to them by rea<U+017F>on of age, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s, hollowne<U+017F>s, rottenne<U+017F>s,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64566:50"/>

el<U+017F>e may be any impediment to them
in their u<U+017F>e. But the chief <U+017F>ymptome here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
is, the falling out, and con<U+017F>equently,
the paucity of the teeth; which is gathered
from the rea<U+017F>on here annexed, <hi>Becau<U+017F>e
they are few;</hi> which is very well tran<U+017F>lated
in our Language, following the Vulgar
Latine; <hi>Otio<U+017F>ae erunt molentes in minuto
numero.</hi> For although the Original word
do primarily <U+017F>ignifie no more than becau<U+017F>e
they are dimini<U+017F>hed, yet it mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be under<U+017F>tood, in re<U+017F>pect of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
for otherwi<U+017F>e they are not dimini<U+017F>hed,
but do grow <U+017F>o long as they remain in the
head, even to the extremity of old age.
But as age comes on, the natural moy<U+017F>ture
at the root of the teeth is con<U+017F>umed, and a
preternatural is di<U+017F>tilled thither in its room,
which doth by degrees relax them in their
<U+017F>ockets, and at length quite expell them:
And when <U+017F>ome of them are thru<U+017F>t out,
and but a few left in, it is ea<U+017F>ie to conceive
from what hath been <U+017F>aid, how the chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the mouth cea<U+017F>eth; yea, it cea<U+017F>eth
more, when the teeth are few, than when
they are none at all. For then the Gums
might act one again<U+017F>t another, and, fora<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they grow harder in old age, might
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64566:51"/>
do <U+017F>omething weakly towards the chewing
of the meat; but when they are few, they
hinder tho<U+017F>e from working in the lea<U+017F>t, and

                  <p>Fora<U+017F>much as they are the only true, and
proper Organs of <U+017F>eeing; however, it
will be well worth our labour to con<U+017F>ider,
how the eyes may be called, the lookers
out of the windows. One may be <U+017F>aid to
look out of a window in a double <U+017F>en<U+017F>e,
either when he looks through the gla<U+017F>s of
the window, and through the pellucidity
of that mo<U+017F>t refined body, di<U+017F>cerneth
tho<U+017F>e things which are without; or when
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64566:51"/>
he looks through the open Ca<U+017F>ement, or
through <U+017F>ome open hole of the window,
wherein there is nothing at all interpo<U+017F>eth
between him and the object. Now in both
the<U+017F>e <U+017F>en<U+017F>es may our interpretation well be
made. For the Explication of it in the
fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, we mu<U+017F>t take notice of all tho<U+017F>e
tran<U+017F>parent parts, through which the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
<U+017F>pecies mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity pa<U+017F>s before
vi<U+017F>ion can be perfected: For as a man
could <U+017F>ee nothing through a window, were
it not made of gla<U+017F>s, or of <U+017F>ome body alike
Diaphanous: So neither could he perceive
any thing with his eye, were not the parts
thereof, through which pa<U+017F><U+017F>age is made, of
the very <U+017F>ame nature. Now, the parts
of the eye, through who<U+017F>e bodies the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
<U+017F>pecies mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s that they may be

the <hi>Crystalline,</hi> and the <hi>gla<U+017F>sie</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<U+017F>o called by Anatomi<U+017F>ts; and you
may perceive by their names that the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
of them all is Diaphanous; all
which, how<U+017F>oever they wonderfully differ
among them<U+017F>elves, and <U+017F>everal waies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the u<U+017F>e and benefit of the eye,
and con<U+017F>equently are made variou<U+017F>ly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trumental
unto vi<U+017F>ion, yet they all agree
in this one thing, that they are tran<U+017F>parent;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64566:52"/>
and that they mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity do, fora<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as into their bodies, and through
their bodies, mu<U+017F>t the vi<U+017F>ible <U+017F>pecies pa<U+017F>s,
before they can perfectly be di<U+017F>cerned by
any man. And if one opacous, or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome
body interpo<U+017F>eth, they can go no
further, but there they mu<U+017F>t determine
their cour<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tunicles or Coats,</hi> through which
the <U+017F>ight is made, are only two, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there are other Tunicles of the
eye, which conduce wonderfully to the
<U+017F>ight, (as you <U+017F>hall hear beneath,) yet
tho<U+017F>e through which the <U+017F>pecies pa<U+017F>s, are
only the <hi>Tunica Aranea,</hi> and the <hi>Cornea.</hi>
The fir<U+017F>t is <U+017F>o called from the <U+017F>imilitude of
a Spiders Web, becau<U+017F>e it is mo<U+017F>t fine and
<U+017F>ubtile, and being derived from the Brain
and Optick Nerve, it becomes a mo<U+017F>t te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
ve<U+017F>tment for the humours; and is
<U+017F>o pellucid, and tran<U+017F>parent, that among
the Learned it bears the name of <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi>
The other is called, <hi>Sclerotica,</hi> or
<hi>Cornea;</hi> and that is, that hard and horny
Membrane, which being derived from the
<hi>dura mater,</hi> encompa<U+017F><U+017F>eth the whole body
of the eye, without any perforation; and
on the back part, behind the <U+017F>ight of the
eye, is more ob<U+017F>cure and dark; but on
the forepart, is far more plain, polite, and

diaphanous, that the <U+017F>pecies may pa<U+017F>s
through its body mo<U+017F>t pure and unaltered.
And now I am come to that part of the
eye, that doth mo<U+017F>t aptly re<U+017F>emble the
gla<U+017F>s of the window, by rea<U+017F>on of which

whom this Paraphra<U+017F>e may come, though
it be not <U+017F>o proper, and the Conceptions
which they had about them, are not to be
admitted; for there is no new Entity, either

di<U+017F>tinct from it, &amp; from the light, which
is the cau<U+017F>e of vi<U+017F>ion in the eye; by the

than the <U+017F>everal beams of light being <U+017F>o
reflected from the object, as that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
fully fraught with the repre<U+017F>entation
of it, (not only in re<U+017F>pect of the proper
object of <U+017F>ight, which we call colour, but
of the<U+017F>e common ones al<U+017F>o, which we call
<U+017F>ituation, figure, di<U+017F>tance, bigne<U+017F>s, and

which, we mu<U+017F>t know that the <U+017F>pecies pa<U+017F>s
along the medium in a Pyramidical figure,
and as they are ca<U+017F>t off from one point of
the Superficies of the object in a Cone, <U+017F>o
they mu<U+017F>t be reduced again in the <U+017F>ame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
figure upon one and the <U+017F>ame point of
the Organ; which reduction is performed
by that collection, refraction, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which hapneth to them in tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
pellucide bodies through which they
pa<U+017F>s, and primarily (while the eye remains
in its vigour) in the <hi>Tunica Cornea;</hi> but as
age enfeebleth the eye, the form and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of it becomes more plane and depre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
than it was before; and the Cry<U+017F>talline
humour, which had a power of reducing it
<U+017F>elf, and con<U+017F>equently the whole body of
the eye, to a more oblong and Convex
<U+017F>hape, becomes dry, and altogether unable
for <U+017F>uch an end; <U+017F>o that now the Species
ca<U+017F>t off from the object at a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance,
cannot be brought to a Cone upon
the Organ, which mu<U+017F>t needs breed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion
in the fight: To avoid which con<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
old men hold the object that they
look upon at a greater di<U+017F>tance from the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64566:54"/>
eye, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>o, the pre<U+017F>ent Con<U+017F>titution
of the eye can better regulate the Species;
and thus al<U+017F>o Spectacles are placed before
the eye to collect, refract, and guide the
Species, that they may point together
upon the <hi>Retina;</hi> which by how much the
thicker, and more Convex they are, by
<U+017F>o much the more powerfully do they do
this work: And therefore as age encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth,
and the form of the Cry<U+017F>talline hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and of the whole eye is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed,
<U+017F>o much the thicker, or <U+017F>o much
the more Convex, or both, mu<U+017F>t the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
be made, that they may be an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the age. And this is done only
in imitation of that, which is far more
perfectly done while man abides in
<U+017F>trength, by the hard Membrane we are
now treating of; and this is the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>e
in which the eyes may be called the lookers
out of the windows.</p>
                  <p>The other is, that whereby they may
be <U+017F>aid to look <hi>through the holes</hi> of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
when there is an open pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and

whereby the eye may be <U+017F>aid to look in, or

nothing could be <U+017F>o applicable as this; and

do make up tho<U+017F>e curious arched chambers
in which the<U+017F>e lookers or beholders dwell,
in which, and from which, they may be

Secondly, They may be <U+017F>aid to look in,
or through the holes; in re<U+017F>pect of the
<hi>palpebrae</hi> or Eye-lids; for although the u<U+017F>e
of the eye-lids is to cover or clo<U+017F>e the eyes,
<U+017F>o that they are called, <hi>Oculi ab oculendo,
vel occultando,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they lye hid under
their lids; yet when<U+017F>oever the eye is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>ed
in <U+017F>eeing, they mu<U+017F>t depart one from
another, and <U+017F>o leave an open hole through
which the <U+017F>ight may be made. And thus
every man di<U+017F>cerns in him<U+017F>elf that he can
take away <U+017F>ight, or cau<U+017F>e it at plea<U+017F>ure, by
drawing, or withdrawing; by letting

they might be no impediment to vi<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>o

freely without interruption pa<U+017F>s through;
the truth of this any one may di<U+017F>cern in the
inflammation of the eyes, for that is a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e
for the mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>eated in this part

alone; then you may <U+017F>ee the veins and the
Arteries very red and <U+017F>wollen, <U+017F>o far as
this Membrane or the white of the eye
reacheth, and the <hi>Iris</hi> or darker part of the
eye in the mean while wholly free.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The eyes may be <U+017F>aid to look
through the holes in re<U+017F>pect of the <hi>Pupilla,</hi>
or the apple of the eye, which is nothing
el<U+017F>e, but an open hole in one of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings
of the eye, as I may <U+017F>ay, bored for
that very purpo<U+017F>e, that the lookers through
the windows might have an open view;
for that Covering which is called <hi>Tunica
Uvea,</hi> is a thick, and a clo<U+017F>e, a dusky, and
a dark Membrane, through which the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
Species, or the light cannot ea<U+017F>ily
make its way. And therefore on the back
part its u<U+017F>e is to pre<U+017F>erve, and to keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the innate light of the eye, and
al<U+017F>o to give a <U+017F>top to the vi<U+017F>ible <U+017F>pecies, <U+017F>o
that they can pa<U+017F>s no farther, but mu<U+017F>t
there impre<U+017F>s their Images; like the lead,
or the <U+017F>teel, or what<U+017F>oever el<U+017F>e is put on
the back<U+017F>ide of the Looking-gla<U+017F>s, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which there can be no impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion made;
but on the fore-part it is mo<U+017F>t convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perforated, and at <U+017F>uch a proportion,
that the light or the <U+017F>pecies through it have
freedom of acce<U+017F>s: which perforation is
the apple of the eye, that wonderful part,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64566:56"/>
which is <U+017F>o often noted in Scripture to be
above all other parts of the body tendered
and ob<U+017F>erved,<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10. P<U+017F>al. 17. 8 Pro. 7. 2.</note> and therefore here I would
principally take notice of it; and of all the
parts of the eyes, and of all the holes
through which they look, let this be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
accounted the mo<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>ervable. For
it may be dilated or contracted as it may be
conducible to a more perfect <U+017F>ight; if
there be requi<U+017F>ite thereunto, a greater or a
le<U+017F><U+017F>er light; if the object we would look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be farther off, or nearer to the eye; or if
we do more carele<U+017F>ly or curiou<U+017F>ly look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; this hole is pre<U+017F>ently made wider or
narrower; that it may be the more <U+017F>ervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for the pre<U+017F>ent occa<U+017F>ion.</p>
                  <p>La<U+017F>tly, They may be <U+017F>aid to look
through the holes in re<U+017F>pect of the <hi>Optick
Nerves,</hi> for the<U+017F>e above all the other
Nerves of the body are apparently perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated;
and although neither the<U+017F>e, nor any
other, doth <U+017F>o appear in a body that hath
been long dead, yet doubtle<U+017F>s they have
open pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages while the body is yet alive,
fora<U+017F>much as they are the Conveyers of
matter, though more pure and refined,
from one part unto another, as the other
Chanels of the body are. And here the
Cavity and Poro<U+017F>ity of the Optick nerves,
ought as well to be reckoned among the,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64566:57"/>
holes through which <U+017F>ight is made, as any
other that are placed before the proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
upon which the repre<U+017F>entation of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
objects is fir<U+017F>t made, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
there can be no perfect perception of
any thing, unle<U+017F>s the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sen<U+017F>ory be truly conveyed into the
mo<U+017F>t inward rece<U+017F><U+017F>es of the brain, where
the <U+017F>oul makes its <U+017F>eat of judicature. For
as all the things in a Chamber may have
their firm repre<U+017F>entation in a gla<U+017F>s that
<U+017F>tands upon the Table, yet if any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo<U+017F>e
between me and the gla<U+017F>s, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cern
nothing at all; and they are all as
much hid from me, as if they had never
been there repre<U+017F>ented. And thus we
know a total ob<U+017F>truction of the Optick
Nerve, which is called, <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi>
makes as perfect a blindne<U+017F>s, as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truction
of the humour <hi>Aqueus,</hi> which is
called, a <hi>Cataract;</hi> And thus I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to <U+017F>hew, and that I hope with <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>atisfaction, how the eyes may be called,
the lookers through the windows. Now
as age comes on and encrea<U+017F>eth, it is well
known to all men how <U+017F>ight goeth away
and decrea<U+017F>eth; the lookers out of the
windows mu<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly be darkned, and
by how much the more excellent the<U+017F>e

it is <hi>primum vivens,</hi> and <hi>ultimum moriens;</hi>
but contrariwi<U+017F>e it may very well be <U+017F>aid of
the eye, that it is <hi>ultimum vivens,</hi> and
<hi>primum moriens.</hi> This mo<U+017F>t wonderful
and tender part of man, in that it hath
more curious and more various work in its
formation, is the la<U+017F>t that lives; and in that
it hath need of more life and vigour, more

And I per<U+017F>wade my <U+017F>elf, that the hitherto
mi<U+017F>carriage in the Interpretation of the<U+017F>e
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64566:59"/>

we mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t of all <U+017F>hew what is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood
by the <hi>grinding,</hi> and afterwards
what the doors and the <U+017F>treets are, and
what the <U+017F>ound of the grinding, will ea<U+017F>ily
be made appear. The wi<U+017F>dome of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
is <U+017F>o famous throughout all Regions
and Ages, that I need not here Apologize
for it. It would be unbecoming an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Writer, much more the Penman of
this Allegory, to deliver the <U+017F>ame thing
twice in a breath; And I wonder with
what face any Interpreters could put <U+017F>o
great an ab<U+017F>urdity upon the Wi<U+017F>e man, as
to make this grinding <U+017F>ignifie no more than
that ju<U+017F>t mentioned before. But for the
clearing of this, we mu<U+017F>t know that grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is of two <U+017F>orts, either <hi>Per extra po<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:64566:60"/>

u<U+017F>e to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h of augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,)
there is an <hi>extrin<U+017F>ecal,</hi> or an <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecal</hi>
grinding; the former of the<U+017F>e is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
when two hard bodies acting
again<U+017F>t each other, do break and brui<U+017F>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<U+017F>mall parts, that which is put between
them. And this is the grinding as in a
Mill, of which you heard before. The
latter of the<U+017F>e is performed, when the
parts of the <U+017F>ame ma<U+017F>s, by rea<U+017F>on of the
exaltation of <U+017F>ome internal principle, or
the addition of <U+017F>ome <hi>fermentum,</hi> are <U+017F>o
acted among them<U+017F>elves, that the whole
ma<U+017F>s, and every the lea<U+017F>t part thereof, is
changed and brought into a new Con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tence.
And this Philo<U+017F>ophy calls <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi>
and is that of which the Wi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<U+017F>peaks in this place; And it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called grinding, becau<U+017F>e it accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>heth
the end thereof better than any mill
can do. It will comminuate things of <U+017F>o
hard a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance that no mill can break.
I would fain know what Mill could have
ground <hi>Aarons</hi> golden Calf,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 20. Deut. 9. 21.</note> but by the
help of fire, and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>ome <U+017F>pecifick
men<U+017F>truum, as a proper key for that Solar
Mineral, it was ea<U+017F>ily ground to powder.
Again, it can divide the matter that is to
be ground into <U+017F>maller parts than any mill
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64566:60"/>
can do; it will not leave the mo<U+017F>t minute

our Saviours expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of it, is yet more
<U+017F>ignificant, <hi>The Kingdom of heaven is like
unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in

<U+017F>o low, as to grind every Corn, and every

none untouched, but divides (beyond

                  <p>Now of this <U+017F>ort of grinding there is

in compari<U+017F>on of which, all the others are

ob<U+017F>erve my former method having refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
only to tho<U+017F>e five great works of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
before treated of. The voice of the
fir<U+017F>t grinding, is the natural appetite of the
<U+017F>tomack to meat and drink, and is u<U+017F>ually
called hunger and thir<U+017F>t; the <U+017F>trength and
power of the <U+017F>tomack to retain its food;
and the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable evacuation of well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
excrements. The voice of the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
is a free pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the chyle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ob<U+017F>truction, a quick, <U+017F>trong, and a
lively pul<U+017F>e; a due <U+017F>eparation of gall, of
urine, and the re<U+017F>t of the excrements of
this Concoction. The voice of the third,
is the proper tone of all the parts of the
body, the fa<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s and fulne<U+017F>s of the fle<U+017F>h,
and convenient per<U+017F>piration. The voice
of the fourth,<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 3</note> is the Cu<U+017F>tome of women,
the <U+017F>tiffne<U+017F>s, lively colour, and fre<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s of

the <U+017F>everal grindings while they remain in

grindings are weaker, and the <U+017F>everal
voices of them more <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F>s; wherefore
it doth nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follow, that in decrepit

but the <hi>doors</hi> and <hi><U+017F>treets,</hi> that relate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
are by this time under<U+017F>tood; but
becau<U+017F>e the word <hi>doors</hi> hath <U+017F>ome peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

                     </gap> this word being of the duall

Learned to con<U+017F>ider, whether the word
<hi>Valvae</hi> or <hi>Valvulae</hi> will not as well, if not
better, agree to the Text; the folding
doors, or the doors that clap together, or
that have a double u<U+017F>e. For the better
under<U+017F>tanding it, therefore we mu<U+017F>t know
that the doors that relate to the grinding
before <U+017F>poken of, are of two <U+017F>orts; either
the <hi>extream doors,</hi> or the <hi>intermediate
doors.</hi> Again, the extream doors al<U+017F>o, are
of two <U+017F>orts; either the <hi>fore doors,</hi> or the
<hi>back doors;</hi> either the doors that fir<U+017F>t let

the grindings, or that matter that upon the

The fore doors, or the doors by
which the food is fir<U+017F>t let into the body, are
none other than the Lips, for by the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64566:69"/>
<U+017F>hutting of them, the meat is kept out,
and by the opening of them, it is let in,
to the fir<U+017F>t grinding in the mouth. And
as they are called doors in re<U+017F>pect of words,
fora<U+017F>much as they let them out;<note place="margin">P<U+017F>al. 41. 3</note>

tho<U+017F>e former Interpreters that have applied

well; the report they have given
hath been true; yet I may, with the

Eyes, and all the <hi>Emunctories</hi> of the body
may be here included, yet tho<U+017F>e which are
principally intended, are tho<U+017F>e eminent
Po<U+017F>terns, which <U+017F>o long as man lives in
<U+017F>trength are alwaies ready for their work,
which is to give pa<U+017F>s to tho<U+017F>e three <U+017F>everal
Excrements which we dayly avoid, either
by the guts, the bladder, or the habit of the

For all the<U+017F>e have a power of opening and
<U+017F>hutting, and con<U+017F>equently of keeping in,
or letting out, what<U+017F>oever comes unto
them, and are often at convenient <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons
retracted for the clean<U+017F>ing of the body.
Thus far of the extream doors, which are
placed at the extremity of the body, and
<U+017F>erve only for inlets or outlets to the <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the body, for all that which is
either de<U+017F>ired or rejected of nature. The
intermediate doors are <U+017F>eated within the
body, and are inlets and outlets only from
one part of the body to another; like the
doors within the hou<U+017F>e, which according to
their <U+017F>hutting or opening are <U+017F>tops or
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages from one Room of the hou<U+017F>e to
another. The<U+017F>e may be <U+017F>aid to be double

to that which is before, and to that which
is behind; they let out of that, and into

this; and of this <U+017F>ort there are very many

my <U+017F>elf, that are not yet <U+017F>ufficiently
di<U+017F>covered. The fir<U+017F>t that the matter of
nouri<U+017F>hment meets with after it is chewed
in the mouth, is the <hi>Pharynx,</hi> or head of
the <hi>oe<U+017F>ophagus,</hi> which while it be kept
clo<U+017F>e, keeps the meat in the mouth, till it
be there <U+017F>ufficiently ground, and afterward
by the retraction of the Mu<U+017F>cle of the
throat, which for this very rea<U+017F>on is called
<hi>Sphincter gulae,</hi> it is committed into the
throat, which is the high way to the
<U+017F>tomack; but before it can come there, it
meets again with another door, which is
called, the mouth, or <hi><U+017F>uperior Orifice of the
<U+017F>tomack,</hi> which unle<U+017F>s it be opened al<U+017F>o it
cannot pa<U+017F>s. And this any man may
perceive in him<U+017F>elf in a morning, or after
the mouth of the <U+017F>tomack hath been long
and clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hut, if he ha<U+017F>tily <U+017F>wallow down
<U+017F>olid food before he drink, it makes a <U+017F>top
there, and <U+017F>tands knocking as it were,
with pain waiting for admittance. The
third door that the chyle meets withal, is
the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age out of the <U+017F>tomack into the

doors, all the doors, both the doors, the

what they ought to do, as they formerly

when there is an external force put upon

                  <p>The third are tho<U+017F>e that modulate this

mu<U+017F>t alwaies be acknowledged, that every
one of the parts before mentioned, do al<U+017F>o
contribute <U+017F>omething towards modulation;
yet the more proper and peculiar in<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
thereof, are the Cartilagineous parts
of the <hi>A<U+017F>pera Arteria,</hi> or the windpipe;
and e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e which are termed, <hi>the
Larynx and the glottis.</hi> The <hi>Larynx</hi> is the
head of the windpipe, which although it
be but a very little part, yet doth con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t
of more variety of compounding parts,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64566:80"/>
than any other what<U+017F>oever; as little as it is,
it hath thirteen Mu<U+017F>cles belonging unto it,
mo<U+017F>t of which are framed only for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation
of the voice; <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hut the pipe,
<U+017F>ome open it, <U+017F>ome dilate, <U+017F>ome contract
it, <U+017F>o that acting <U+017F>everally, or joyntly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as there is occa<U+017F>ion; they do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
conduce to the variation of the
tone. It hath moreover five Cartilages,
who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence is mo<U+017F>t apt
of all other what<U+017F>oever, for the dividing
of a <U+017F>ound; <U+017F>ome of them are movable,
<U+017F>ome immovable, <U+017F>ome of one form, <U+017F>ome
of another, that they may the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the air; and alter and break the voice
into melody. Be<U+017F>ide it hath certain Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
belong unto it, which by their
vi<U+017F>cous moy<U+017F>ture do <U+017F>o irrigate, and as it
were oyle the pipe, that it takes off the
har<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s that otherwi<U+017F>e would be found,
and adds much <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s and plea<U+017F>antne<U+017F>s
to the Mu<U+017F>ick. The <hi>glottis</hi> is reckoned
among the Cartilages before mentioned,
yet becau<U+017F>e it is the principal in<U+017F>trument of
modulation, we cannot but take mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
notice of it. And it therefore bears
its name, becau<U+017F>e what eminency the
tongue hath above the re<U+017F>t in reference to
our <U+017F>peech, the <U+017F>ame hath this part in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed forth from the Lungs, this part
ri<U+017F>eth up to meet it, embraceth it, plaies
with it, and by a certain innate property
of its own, without the help of Mu<U+017F>cles,
alters it, divides it, at its own plea<U+017F>ure,
into all that diver<U+017F>ity of amplifications
and flouri<U+017F>hes, that the Art of man can
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly reach unto. If a man make a
pipe in the middle of a green reed, and
leave the inward thin film as the tongue of
the pipe, and then breath again<U+017F>t it; he
<U+017F>hall then find, that tongue to receive the
breath, and <U+017F>o to modulate it; that it <U+017F>hall
be a lively, though but a <U+017F>hort re<U+017F>emblance,
of what we are now <U+017F>peaking of. And
indeed, what<U+017F>oever Art can do, mu<U+017F>t give
way to the works of nature: And that
one pipe in man, which hath the wi<U+017F>dom of
God for its formation to the intent of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick,
can amplifie and divide a <U+017F>ound, to

Animal, Vital, and Natural. And

again he doth mo<U+017F>t elegantly run over all
the parts of man, and give only one mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ignificant alteration in each of them. The
Compounding parts of man (as all men

the Soul and the Body. The principal

all imminent evil is looked upon either as
vincible, or invincible; if a man look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an approaching evil, as that which he is

of <hi>fear;</hi> which together with all its atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants

rea<U+017F>on, are too familiarly ob<U+017F>erved in the
be<U+017F>t of men that are crooked with age;
And by how much the more man declines,
by <U+017F>o much the more do the<U+017F>e <U+017F>uperfluities
encrea<U+017F>e, like Mi<U+017F>letoe, and <U+017F>ome other
Excre<U+017F>cencies of trees, that flouri<U+017F>h not,

And the rea<U+017F>on of it is, becau<U+017F>e the true
Cau<U+017F>es of this affection (namely, mi<U+017F>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen<U+017F>ions

produce their an<U+017F>werable effects. The fir<U+017F>t
of the<U+017F>e Cau<U+017F>es, proceeds from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of the Imagination; the other, from
the lowne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>pirits, and the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility

yet if the Almond Tree be blo<U+017F><U+017F>omed,
know of a truth, that the year is turned,
and that the Sun is coming neerer towards
us, and that the Sap <U+017F>tirs, though it be not
el<U+017F>ehow perceived: The <U+017F>ame certainty of
demon<U+017F>tration al<U+017F>o doth attend the Hoary
Head; if no other <U+017F>ymptome appear, yet
if the Hair begin to change white, know

high as ever; yet if the Almond Tree
flouri<U+017F>h, if the Hair of the Head be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of the weakne<U+017F>s attending age: the habit
of the Body is already changed, the innate
heat begins to be <U+017F>uffocated, the radical
moi<U+017F>ture is con<U+017F>uming, the excrements
(which con<U+017F>titute the Hair) are inconcoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64566:92"/>
and the temperament of Old age
hath already <U+017F>eized the Man, although
it be no other wayes to be di<U+017F>cerned.</p>
                  <p>La<U+017F>tly, They do al<U+017F>o exceeding well
agree in their <hi>Progno<U+017F>ticks;</hi> they are both
of them mo<U+017F>t certain fore-runners and
foretellers of what is to follow after them.
If the Almond Tree be blo<U+017F><U+017F>omed, it is a
mo<U+017F>t certain <U+017F>ign that Fruit will come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that it is not far behind; <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi>

after it brought forth Almonds, the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

There is far more certainty in the reality

never the wor<U+017F>e accepted: For in the<U+017F>e
Theoretical notions, the danger is not <U+017F>o
great, to deviate from the beaten road, and
to be Heterodox to the general received
opinion. For the <U+017F>ubject of this Propo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without all controver<U+017F>ie, it is the
Locu<U+017F>t or Gra<U+017F>hopper, which differ very
little, either in their nature or form, and
may very well intend the <U+017F>ame thing: The
predicate is far more difficult, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath given occa<U+017F>ion to more variety

is, <hi>Erit oneri,</hi> which our Engli<U+017F>h exactly

may be a truth, yet it can in no wi<U+017F>e be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

which is (as hath already been <U+017F>aid) Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall,
and from the particular mode of

but how incongruous it is to the very
Grammatical reading of the words, any
one who is the lea<U+017F>t skilled in the Original

that living to extream old age, he

was at la<U+017F>t turned into a Gra<U+017F>hopper, and
into it, it may be very well moralized
again; For then the body of man is quite
another thing than what it was in its prime,
it is contracted, and becomes much le<U+017F>s,
and crumpled up together, and in the
end is brought even to crawle upon the

tran<U+017F>lated from its fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ignification to this
latter, becau<U+017F>e of the known u<U+017F>e of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
which is to excite the appetite; <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paris

that is, in the figurative <U+017F>ignification,
the<U+017F>e following rea<U+017F>ons do induce me to
believe, every one of which <U+017F>ingly, <U+017F>eem
to have a good per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ive power; but all
of them joyntly, have doubtle<U+017F>s a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul<U+017F>ive
power, to any rational man to be
of the <U+017F>ame opinion. The fir<U+017F>t, is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

<U+017F>cope, that the wi<U+017F>dom of <hi>Solomon<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>

propo<U+017F>eth to it <U+017F>elf in this whole de<U+017F>cripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of age, which is by way of Allegory
all along. No wonder therefore if the
<U+017F>ame wi<U+017F>dom, where there be two <U+017F>ignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of a word, <U+017F>hall rather prefer the
Allegorical; the <U+017F>econd, is the particular
intent of this ver<U+017F>e, which is to <U+017F>hew the
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible alterations that are made in man in
old age, both in re<U+017F>pect of his mind, and
of the <U+017F>everal parts of the body, and that
<U+017F>ymbolically, or by way of re<U+017F>emblance
to other things: and not at all to relate to
any of the faculties; and that which doth
abundantly back this rea<U+017F>on, is, that the
weakned faculties were de<U+017F>cribed before,
and particularly it was <U+017F>hewn <U+017F>ufficiently,
how the appetite both <hi>ad cibum</hi> and <hi>Coitum</hi>
was weakned, in the la<U+017F>t ver<U+017F>e, in tho<U+017F>e
words, <hi>the voice of the grinding is low:</hi>
And therefore a learned Commentator
upon this place,<note place="margin">Cornel. a Lap.</note> when he had <U+017F>aid, <hi>Senum
libido frige<U+017F>cit,</hi> further adds, (that which

before,) <hi>&amp; organa coitus di<U+017F>sipantur;</hi>
which is indeed, the true purport of the
words, though but in part. Again, the
Contextural expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions are of the <U+017F>elf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ame
nature, both tho<U+017F>e that follow in the
Allegory, namely, the <U+017F>ilver Cord, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64566:101"/>
the golden Bowl: and al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
precede, namely, the Gra<U+017F>hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

                     </gap> was tran<U+017F>lated from its
primary <U+017F>ignification, which is, waking,
(as was <U+017F>aid,) to that figurative, of the
Almond tree; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o would it be mo<U+017F>t
congruous to deal with this word we are
now about. Again, Authority is <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
yea, abundant for this way of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>lating
it: If any one plea<U+017F>e to con<U+017F>ult all
the variety of Interpreters, he <U+017F>hall find
(that which is a great rarity) the mo<U+017F>t
and the be<U+017F>t to go together, this way; and
<U+017F>ince <hi>Hieron</hi> did but give favour hereunto,
I find no Tran<U+017F>latour vary hencefrom, but
<U+017F>ome few into Vulgar Tongues.</p>
                  <p>La<U+017F>tly, By this way of tran<U+017F>lating on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there will be a direct oppo<U+017F>ition, and
a perfect <hi>Antithe<U+017F>is</hi> (which certainly there
ought to be) betwixt this word and that
which immediatly went before. The
Gra<U+017F>hoppers and Capers are in their form
and fa<U+017F>hion; their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tence,
clean contrary one to another;
The one, being protuberous, rough, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ty,
and hard: The other, round, <U+017F>mooth,
<U+017F>pongy, and <U+017F>oft: And therefore may be
very fit Emblems to repre<U+017F>ent the <U+017F>everal
contradi<U+017F>tinct parts of the body, under the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64566:102"/>
<U+017F>ame variety of con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence. Wherefore,
as the Gra<U+017F>hopper did principally repre<U+017F>ent
the bones, and <U+017F>econdarily, all tho<U+017F>e parts
that proceed from the Cra<U+017F><U+017F>iment of the
<U+017F>eed; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o here, the Capers do as aptly
repre<U+017F>ent principally the fle<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>econda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
the other moy<U+017F>t and fluid parts of the
body that proceed from the more tenuous
part of the <U+017F>eminary matter: and that
which doth farther confirm this rea<U+017F>on, is,
from the <hi>Antithe<U+017F>is</hi> that is al<U+017F>o in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
of the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions: For as there,
the Gra<U+017F>hoppers are <U+017F>aid to grow big, or
burden<U+017F>ome; So here, the Capers are <U+017F>aid
to <U+017F>hrink or decay; for <U+017F>o the word

So that what we are to under<U+017F>tand by this
Sentence, the Capers <U+017F>hall <U+017F>hrink, is the
alteration of all the moy<U+017F>t and tender parts

that befalleth the bloud and natural hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the body in the time of age: For

than they were before.</p>
                  <q>Minimus gelido jam corpore <U+017F>anguis.</q>
                  <p>Nor can I exclude that change that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to the fat and marrow; man in his

concerning them all. But that alteration
which is principally here intended, is that
which befalleth tho<U+017F>e parts of the body
that u<U+017F>ually go under the name of fle<U+017F>h.

of the thing, he <U+017F>hall <U+017F>urely <U+017F>ee
death: and the latter part of the ver<U+017F>e is
affirmatively propo<U+017F>ed, and therefore <U+017F>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
the vehement negation of it; he
<U+017F>hall in no wi<U+017F>e deliver his <U+017F>oul from the
hand of the Grave: The manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of propo<U+017F>ing this que<U+017F>tion being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a negative, doth <U+017F>eem to carry the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64566:107"/>
that if a man be dead he <U+017F>hall never live

                  <p>Secondly the inference that is hence
made confirms the <U+017F>ame thing; <hi>All the

and powerfully proceed from the denying
of life again, then from the a<U+017F><U+017F>erting it: as
to the diligent ob<U+017F>erver will ea<U+017F>ily appear;
if a man <U+017F>hall never live again in this world,
it is of mo<U+017F>t high concern to prepare for
that change that foreruns an everla<U+017F>ting
<U+017F>tate. There is no returning more from
death, and therefore let every one wait
upon his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and fini<U+017F>h it, before that
time come: <hi>There is no work, nor devi<U+017F>e,
nor knowledge, nor wi<U+017F>dom in the grave,
whither we are going:</hi> And <U+017F>ince there is
no returning thencefrom, how cogent will
the argument be, for every one to wait all
the dayes of his appointed time, till his
change <U+017F>hall come. <hi>If the Tree fall to the
<U+017F>outh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccle<U+017F>. 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>or to the north, in the place where the
Tree falls, there it <U+017F>hall be:</hi> And therefore
it is of the greate<U+017F>t concern to take care
how the Tree fall. If a man at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out of this life fall towards happine<U+017F>s,
or towards mi<U+017F>ery, in the <U+017F>ame condition
he falls, <U+017F>hall he remain for ever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of everla<U+017F>ting concern, to

                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:64566:108"/>
But la<U+017F>tly, that which makes it yet more
clear, that this interrogation intends the
negative, is the words in the latter end of
this Chapter; where <hi>Job</hi> re<U+017F>uming the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and <U+017F>ummarily declaring what he had
been before <U+017F>peaking of; he <U+017F>aith plainly,
<hi>Thou prevaile<U+017F>t for ever again<U+017F>t him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 14. v. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>and he
pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth, thou change<U+017F>t his countenance, and
<U+017F>ende<U+017F>t him away.</hi> I <U+017F>peak not the<U+017F>e things
in the lea<U+017F>t to enervate that mo<U+017F>t comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Chri<U+017F>tian Doctrine of the <hi>Re<U+017F>urrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and as <hi>Job</hi> was very carefull in the
forecited Chapter, to keep his re<U+017F>erve as
unto that; <U+017F>o that in the midde<U+017F>t of the
Chapter (that therefore it might have an
a<U+017F>pect over the whole) he interpo<U+017F>eth a

                     <hi>Man lieth down

So I would not have any one <U+017F>o far mi<U+017F>take
this Doctrine, as to think the Body of Man
<U+017F>hall be kept in everla<U+017F>ting Chaines of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s:
for, though it <U+017F>hall never return to

a <U+017F>et time,<note place="margin">Ver<U+017F>. 13.</note> to remember it in: at
which time it <U+017F>hall, by the Word of God,

the Heart with the Blood: We mu<U+017F>t far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know for the explication of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes,
that there are within the body of
the heart, two firmly di<U+017F>tinct cavities, a

from which there ari<U+017F>e, and unto which
there are annexed certain peculiar ve<U+017F><U+017F>els
conducing to the ends hereafter <U+017F>pecified.
Out of the right ventricle of the heart,
proceed the great vein called <hi>Vena Cava,</hi>
which <U+017F>ends forth branches throughout the
whole body, and hath at its entrance into
the heart, certain portals, from their form

                  <p>The<U+017F>e things being throughly weighed,

which remain to be <U+017F>poken to, do open
them<U+017F>elves into the <U+017F>ame Doctrine without
any more ado. By the Pitcher therefore we
mu<U+017F>t under<U+017F>tand the true and proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of the Blood, namely the <hi>Veines,</hi>
which throughout the whole body <U+017F>erve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, to contain that noble Liquor,
and carry it back again to the Fountain.
The Original word <gap reason="foreign">

which is called a pitcher, and <U+017F>o more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it is u<U+017F>ed. This word both the
Greeks and the Latines take unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
only varying the Termination as is
mo<U+017F>t proper to each Language, and that in
the very <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ignification. Now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
containing Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el for the bloud is the
Veins, there the bloud is, as I may <U+017F>ay, at
home, in its own place; while it is in the
heart, it is preparing, enlivening, and eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;
while it is in the Lungs, and all the
other Parenchymous parts of the bowels,
it is depurating and clean<U+017F>ing; while it is in
the Arteries, it is by force journeying;
while it is in the Poro<U+017F>ities of the fle<U+017F>hy
parts, it is communicating of life, and
nouri<U+017F>hing; but while it is in the Veins, it
hath no force upon it at all, nor is it doing
any thing of general u<U+017F>e to the Body, only
con<U+017F>ulting its own good, and tending in its
own natural cour<U+017F>e to its proper Center;
as milk is in the brea<U+017F>ts, and marrow in the
bones, <U+017F>o is bloud in the veins, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the<U+017F>e are the Pitcher here intended.
This Pitcher al<U+017F>o hath its Ear, which is
u<U+017F>ually called, <hi>Auricula Cordis;</hi> which
(notwith<U+017F>tanding its name, as if it mo<U+017F>t
properly appertained to the heart) yet we
mu<U+017F>t know doth rather belong to the vein,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64566:128"/>
and is indeed a part thereof, and not only
a part, but the principal and primary part
thereof, from whence all other parts and
branches do ari<U+017F>e, as from their original,
and whereunto all the bloud of the body
by the Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ive motion of the Veins,
doth naturally tend, as to its ultimate
hold; and whence-from it will in no wi<U+017F>e
depart but by force; and therefore this
head-<U+017F>pring of the veins being dilated by
the continual afflux of bloud, is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ea<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elf by Contraction, and <U+017F>o
conveniently forceth out a due proportion
of bloud into the Fountain, whereunto it
is annexed.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Fountain</hi> can be no other than
the right Ventricle of the heart, for this is
yet more <U+017F>trictly the fountain of life, and
forge of the vital <U+017F>pirits, and it doth <U+017F>en<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
live before, and dye after, the other
parts, even of the heart it <U+017F>elf; Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
here it is, that the matter of our nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment
receiveth its fir<U+017F>t enlivening, for
our food being received from the <U+017F>tomack
and guts into the common pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of
Chyle, is thence-from carried directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <U+017F>ubclavial branch of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi>
where being mixed with bloud, it yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
lifele<U+017F>s and heartle<U+017F>s, till being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
along that vein, it is at la<U+017F>t brought
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64566:128"/>
into the right Ventricle of the heart;
wherein the heat, motion, and ferment, <U+017F>et
the active principles thereof at a perfect
freedom, and <U+017F>o in<U+017F>tantly endow it with
plenty both of life and <U+017F>pirit. Thus richly
fraught, doth the bloud pa<U+017F>s out of its
fountain, and, by the waies before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed,
it is brought to all the parts of the
body, where parting with much of its la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for their <U+017F>u<U+017F>tentation, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerated
by the coldne<U+017F>s of the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the ambient air; it would <U+017F>oon
be coagulated, and altogether barren, did
it not return again to the right Ventricle
of the heart, as unto its own fountain, to
recover its former perfection. This part
therefore, that doth at the fir<U+017F>t give life to
that which enliveneth the whole man, and
doth, as often as it returns thither, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praegnate
it anew with the <U+017F>ame, mu<U+017F>t
needs be the fountain here intended. And
to this the Original word gives an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
clearne<U+017F>s; implying, not only
the <hi>Signum,</hi> but the <hi>Signatum;</hi> not the
Hieroglyphick only, but the part thereby
deciphered: <U+017F>ignifying in the fir<U+017F>t place,
<hi>Fons,</hi> a Fountain; and <U+017F>econdarily, <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turigo
Venarum,</hi> the <U+017F>pring or original from
whence the Veins ari<U+017F>e; and this is <U+017F>o
clear, that made ancient Commentators
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64566:129"/>
interpret the Fountain here unto the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
Now, had they been right in their
natural knowledge; that is, had they
known that the Veins do not ari<U+017F>e from
the Liver, as from their fir<U+017F>t original, but
from the right Ventricle of the heart, (as
all knowing men now confe<U+017F>s they do,)
they had without all doubt, by the
guidance of this mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ignificant word,
pitched upon the true meaning of the
place.</p>
                  <p>The<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els being throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood,
we mu<U+017F>t farther know, that <U+017F>o long
as man remains in perfect health and
<U+017F>trength, they are uncellantly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
performing all tho<U+017F>e offices unto
which they are appointed; but this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Cour<U+017F>e doth not continue for ever, for
this Pitcher is but an earthen Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, and
doth not <U+017F>o often go to the Fountain, but
at la<U+017F>t it comes broken home. This break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Pitcher here (which is the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome
of old age ju<U+017F>t upon the point of
death) is the failing of the Veins, their
cea<U+017F>ing from their natural action and u<U+017F>e,
when they can no longer carry back, nor
conveniently pa<U+017F>s into the heart that liquor,
which they properly contain. That little
bloud that remains in the cold body of man
near his end is <U+017F>oon Coagulated, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64566:129"/>
<U+017F>tagnating in the Veins, the motion and
circulation thereof is hindered, and <U+017F>o it
becomes thick, like unto the pith of Elder;
And becau<U+017F>e it cannot return to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
for a redintegration of its life and
<U+017F>pirit; it dyeth in the veins, and <U+017F>o all the
extream parts of the body become <U+017F>pirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
and cold; which is the Symptome
here intended. <hi>Frigiditas extremorum</hi> is
acknowledged by all that have con<U+017F>idered
that <U+017F>ubject, as one of the mo<U+017F>t certain

to the In<U+017F>truments of the vital
Faculty, which <U+017F>erve for importation, and
reception of the bloud and <U+017F>pirits; this
that we are now <U+017F>peaking to, hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to tho<U+017F>e, which <U+017F>erve for exportation
and rejection of the <U+017F>ame.</p>
                  <p>The bloud (as was before ob<U+017F>erved)
naturally, of its own accord, tends in the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64566:130"/>
veins, unto the heart; but it returns not
from the heart, into the parts of the body,
but by force: Thus all the Rivers in the
Land naturally ebb into the Sea, but they
flow not thence-from, any farther, than
the violence and impul<U+017F>e of the Sea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.
The bloud, being once forced
from the heart, is pre<U+017F>ently received into
the Trunk of the great Artery, called the
<hi>Aorta;</hi> and by the branches thereof is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to all the parts of the body. This
therefore being the chief and principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trument
of Rotation, or Circulation of
the bloud, is mo<U+017F>t aptly intimated unto us
by a Wheel. For what is a Wheel, but
an in<U+017F>trument of Circulation? And what
can a Wheel be an Hieroglyphick of, but
of <U+017F>omething that goes, or makes the

one, that all that have ever Commented
upon this place, have been <U+017F>till hammering
at <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch thing. Some therefore have
interpreted this place to the life of man,
which pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth as in a Ring, according to

the encompa<U+017F><U+017F>our of the little World,
were de<U+017F>cribed in the Explanation of the
foregoing Symbole; but tho<U+017F>e which are
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64566:131"/>
outward bound, which carry him forth
with all his wealth and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>h
his intended end, are here intimated
unto us by the Wheel. That the great
Artery, with all its branches throughout
the whole body, is here principally pointed
at, hath been already <U+017F>aid; and may be
farther confirmed; fir<U+017F>t, in that it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wers
<U+017F>o directly to the vein <U+017F>ignified in the
la<U+017F>t Symptome, by the Pitcher. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
In that it is to us the mo<U+017F>t apparent
Pul<U+017F>or; we can feel the bloud to be forced
along its Cavity, in the Wri<U+017F>ts, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and divers other parts of the body.
La<U+017F>tly, in that it is <U+017F>o appo<U+017F>itely placed at
the Cock of the Ci<U+017F>tern, as you <U+017F>hall hear
hereafter. Yet we mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>o limit this
Wheel to the Arteries, as to exclude the
very <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and Parenchymous part of
the heart it <U+017F>elf: For upon what<U+017F>oever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truments
the pul<U+017F>ifick faculty is exerci<U+017F>ing
it <U+017F>elf, they are all here intended, by the
Wheel; for they are they, and they only,
that carry off the bloud from the fountain,
and force it from the Center of the body,
to the Circumference. Water may ea<U+017F>ily
be conveyed in Trunks or Pipes, by its
own natural tendency only, unto all tho<U+017F>e
places that are beneath or level with the
Spring from whence it fir<U+017F>t comes; but if
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64566:131"/>
you would have it of a farther u<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>erve
tho<U+017F>e places that are higher than the <U+017F>pring,
you mu<U+017F>t then fetch it up with violence,
by a Wheel, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch In<U+017F>trument of
force, as is to be <U+017F>een in our Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hou<U+017F>es,
and all <U+017F>uch ingenious Inventions
of publick good. Thus all the bloud in
mans body is, in certain Pipes and Trunks,
by its own natural tendency only, brought
home to the heart; but it will in no wi<U+017F>e
go farther, to be of a more general u<U+017F>e to
the whole body, till it have <U+017F>ome In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of force to compel it thence-from;
The Pul<U+017F>ifick faculty is the mover, and
the In<U+017F>truments of Pul<U+017F>ation the Wheel,
that performs this work, that is of <U+017F>o pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
a concern to the whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Cistern</hi> from whence this Wheel
forceth that liquor which afterwards it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyeth
throughout all the parts, is the left
Ventricle of the heart, for hereunto it is,
that the great Artery is annexed, and from
hence it doth ari<U+017F>e. A Ci<U+017F>tern is a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el
made on purpo<U+017F>e to receive a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of water, and to contain it till
the time of u<U+017F>e, and then conveniently
to pa<U+017F>s it into tho<U+017F>e other ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, that are
appointed to receive it thence-from. And
thus the left Ventricle of the heart doth in
its <hi>Dia<U+017F>tole,</hi> receive that bloud that is
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64566:132"/>
brought unto it by the <hi>Arteria Veno<U+017F>a</hi> of
the Lungs, and having retained it a little,
it doth in its <hi>Systole,</hi> conveniently pa<U+017F>s a
due proportion thereof into the <hi>Aorta,</hi>
to be di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed as was <U+017F>poken before;
And this is the true and only u<U+017F>e of the
left Ventricle. For the bloud being eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and enlivened in the right Ventricle,
and refrigerated, and clean<U+017F>ed from its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginous
vapours in the Lungs, it is now in
all things accompli<U+017F>hed for its ultimate u<U+017F>e,
and remains only to be <U+017F>ent, into tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts it is to quicken, which it
cannot conveniently be, unle<U+017F>s it be fir<U+017F>t
received into this Ci<U+017F>tern, and afterwards
by the Pul<U+017F>ifick Faculty and In<U+017F>truments,
be di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of, to that appointed end; and
we cannot but here remind, tho<U+017F>e portals
that are placed, both at the entrance into,
and pa<U+017F><U+017F>age from, the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el we are now
<U+017F>peaking of, namely, the <hi>Valvulae tricu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides
&amp; <U+017F>igmoideae,</hi> which as the Cocks to
let in, and let out, do by their opening or

<U+017F>toppage to that liquor which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually

                  <p>It cannot but by this time be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by all tho<U+017F>e that have gone along
with us, and taken <U+017F>pecial notice of the
aptne<U+017F>s of the<U+017F>e two expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <hi>viz. The

For as it plea<U+017F>ed God in the<U+017F>e

being confirmed by the powerful rea<U+017F>ons

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64566:133"/>
which cannot but be under<U+017F>tood, to be the

that work, which mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

                     <hi>It came
to pa<U+017F>s when the Lord had a purpo<U+017F>e imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to de<U+017F>troy the Ho<U+017F>t of the Aegyptians,
that he looked upon them, and troubled them,
and took off their Charet wheels, that they
drave heavily.</hi> When<U+017F>oever it is the
good plea<U+017F>ure of God to give that word of
Command, that the Tabernacle of our
bodies, <U+017F>hould be as they were; his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
is ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cerned before-hand by his
looking upon us, and troubling us, and
giving di<U+017F>turbance unto, and taking off,
tho<U+017F>e Charet wheels, upon which our life
is turned; but yet this is far more apparent
in the time of Age, for then the Charet
wheels are more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly hindered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and <U+017F>o taken off by degrees. The
old mans Pul<U+017F>e doth yearly and dayly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
both in re<U+017F>pect of the mover, the
<U+017F>troke and the intervall; <U+017F>o that it mu<U+017F>t
needs beat more languidly, <U+017F>lower, and
<U+017F>eldomer than it did before. The Faculty
grows weaker, the u<U+017F>e is not <U+017F>o urgent,
nor the In<U+017F>truments <U+017F>o vigorous, in age,
wherefore all the Cau<U+017F>es of a quick and a

mu<U+017F>t undoubtedly follow; nor will it ever
cea<U+017F>e declining, till it cea<U+017F>eth beating, and
then the man immediately cea<U+017F>eth living;
<hi>Pul<U+017F>us, rarus, tardus, languidus &amp; non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunquam
intermittens,</hi> is the true pul<U+017F>e of
the old man, all the while he is in that
condition, and is like unto the toling of a
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing-bell, which may put him and all
his friends in mind, that he is <U+017F>hortly going
the way of all fle<U+017F>h, but <hi>Pul<U+017F>us omnino abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus
<U+017F>ive a<U+017F>phyxia,</hi> (which is the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome
here mentioned,) is the condition
of the dying man, and is like the <U+017F>tinting
of the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing-bell, or rather the ringing
out of the Knell, which gives notice unto
all that he is gone, and may <U+017F>erve as a
loud, and di<U+017F>tinct invitation to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have as plainly, and as briefly
as I could, run over all the<U+017F>e my<U+017F>tical Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes;
both tho<U+017F>e that attend a man all
the time of his declining age, and tho<U+017F>e
that more immediately forerun, and foretell
his la<U+017F>t change. And now I judge it time
for me to de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, when all <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both in the Rivulets and Fountain is
quite taken away, when there is death in the
face, when there is a coldne<U+017F>s in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
