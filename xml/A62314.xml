         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The lightne<U+017F>s of the Subject might indeed have deterr'd me, from pre<U+017F>ixing before it, a Name, which will challenge veneration,
<pb facs="tcp:60944:3"/>

            <p>When the Books of the <hi>former</hi> Edition were nigh <U+017F>pent, and that I was call'd upon, to provide for another, it was again my fortune, after almo<U+017F>t two years retirement in <hi>Wales,</hi> to come to your Hou<U+017F>e, where I had the opportunity, to review what was printed, and make what additions I could thereto, out of the <U+017F>ame Author's works. So that the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, which I had, at fir<U+017F>t, to make, obliges me to continue, the Dedication of the<U+017F>e Pieces to you; but with this advantage now, that I am the le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ollicitous of their fate, <U+017F>ince the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <U+017F>ome of them have already found, is <U+017F>uch, as hath encourag'd the Book-<U+017F>eller to venture at a <hi>Second</hi> Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
            <p>But if the<U+017F>e were not <U+017F>ufficient, I have <U+017F>everal other motives, which would not
<pb facs="tcp:60944:3"/>
<U+017F>uffer me to decline the doing of what I am now upon, but particularly one, whence I derive the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfaction imaginable, which is, that, by this Addre<U+017F>s, all tho<U+017F>e who love, that is, all who know you, will be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd, of your having o'rcome a Sickne<U+017F>s, which begat a general report of your death.</p>
            <p>And this reflection, me-thinks, may well di<U+017F>pence a little, with my retreat into the <U+017F>tyle of the antient Dedicatories, which were commonly concluded with wi<U+017F>hes and prayers. Mine are, at the pre<U+017F>ent, that, for <U+017F>ome time yet, we may not have the occa<U+017F>ion to bemoan the lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>o precious a life as yours; That the Health you have <U+017F>o happily recover'd may have an uninterrupted continuance for many years; And when you are cloy'd with the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and happine<U+017F>s of this world, (which, as you are wont to expre<U+017F>s it, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the<U+017F>e three words, <hi>Wife, Children, Friends</hi>) you may, by the attendance of tho<U+017F>e Learned men, who<U+017F>e Labours all <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent Ages will be oblig'd to, be convey'd into the joys and bli<U+017F>s of another.

            <p>I am inform'd, that, <U+017F>ome years <U+017F>ince, a Per<U+017F>on of Quality made it his recreation, to render part of that divertive Romance into <hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> tran<U+017F>lating not onely the <hi>Work,</hi> but al<U+017F>o the <hi>Scene,</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England:</hi> and no doubt but the de<U+017F>ign would have taken

infinitely well, had it been pro<U+017F>ecuted. But ere he had compleated his Work, the Scene of our Engli<U+017F>h Affairs was miraculou<U+017F>ly chang'd, from Anarchy to Monarchy, and that Per<U+017F>on being highly engag'd in the Tran<U+017F>actions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening upon his Majesty's happy Re<U+017F>tauration, there was <U+017F>uch a stop put to what he had done therein, that it hath remain'd imperfect ever <U+017F>ince: whence it may well be ghe<U+017F>s'd, there is <U+017F>omewhat in it <U+017F>o far tran<U+017F>cending ordinary Tran<U+017F>lation, that no other Hand dur<U+017F>t attempt it.</p>

Some <U+017F>ay, that, if I could be capable of any motion, it would not be much unlike that of tho<U+017F>e exemplary Cripples, who go on their Hands and Britch; others affirm I have no Thighs, and that, being <U+017F>et on the Table in a Box, purpo<U+017F>ely made for me, I there fall a prating like an one-ey'd Parrat: And others y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t are <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant, as to <U+017F>ay, that, my Hat being ty'd to the end of a Cord, which runs
<pb facs="tcp:60944:7"/>
through a Pully fa<U+017F>ten'd to the Roof of my Chamber, I, having the other end of the <U+017F>aid Cord in my hands (which it <U+017F>eems I must not be able to lift up to my head) make a <U+017F>hift, to rai<U+017F>e up, and let it fall, to <U+017F>alute tho<U+017F>e who come to vi<U+017F>it me.</p>
            <p>I conceive my <U+017F>elf therefore oblig'd in con<U+017F>cience, to give a check to the<U+017F>e calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that the World may at length be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and to that end, have I caus'd the Plate, which thou maist <U+017F>ee at the beginning of this Preface, to be graven. I doubt not, Reader, but thou wilt grumble, (for grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling is very natural to all Readers, and I am inclin'd to it my <U+017F>elf, as well as others, when I am a Reader) thou wilt grumble, I <U+017F>ay, and quarrel at me, that thou hast not a <U+017F>ight of my fore-part. To <U+017F>atisfie thee, know, that it is not out of any irreverence, or want of civility, that I turn my back-<U+017F>ide to the Company, but for this rea<U+017F>on, that the convexity of my Back is fitter to receive an in<U+017F>cription, than the concavity of my Brea<U+017F>t, which is over-<U+017F>hadow'd by the pendency of my Head, and that by that <U+017F>ide, as well as the other, a Man may take a <U+017F>urvey of the Site, or rather, the irregular platform of my Per<U+017F>on. Without any imagination, that the
<pb facs="tcp:60944:8"/>
world <U+017F>hould think it <U+017F>elf oblig'd by <U+017F>uch a Pre<U+017F>ent (for, by the Nine Gentle-La<U+017F><U+017F>es that <U+017F>tand about me, I never hop'd my Head would ever become the Original of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal) I would have had my Picture drawn, if any Painter durst have attempted it. For want of that, take this account of my Per<U+017F>on.</p>
            <p>I am <U+017F>omewhat above thirty years of age, as thou maist <U+017F>ee by the back of my chair. If I live to forty, I <U+017F>hall make a great addition of mi<U+017F>eries, to tho<U+017F>e I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <U+017F>uffer'd, within the<U+017F>e eight or nine years. I was of a pa<U+017F><U+017F>able stature, though <U+017F>omewhat below the middle <U+017F>ize; but my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es have <U+017F>hortned it by a foot and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. My head is <U+017F>omewhat of the bigge<U+017F>t, con<U+017F>idering my stature. My face is pretty full, and plump, compar'd to the Skele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton I am thence downwards. I am <U+017F>o well furni<U+017F>h'd with hair, that I need wear no Periwig, and much of it is turn'd grey, in <U+017F>pight of the Proverb. My <U+017F>ight is good enough, though my eyes <U+017F>omewhat larger than they <U+017F>hould be: they are blew, and one of them more <U+017F>unk into my head than the other. My no<U+017F>e <U+017F>tands well enough. My teeth, <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o many pearls, are
<pb facs="tcp:60944:8"/>
now of a colour between black and blew. I have lo<U+017F>t one and a half on the left <U+017F>ide, and two and a half on the right, and I have two a little broken. My legs and thighs made at fir<U+017F>t an obtu<U+017F>e, then an equal, and at la<U+017F>t, an acute angle. My thighs and my body making another, and my head hanging down over my brea<U+017F>t, I am a certain repre<U+017F>entative or Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick of the Letter <hi>Z.</hi> My arms are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted as well as my legs, and my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as well as my arms. In a word, I am a certain contraction or Epitome of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane mi<U+017F>ery.</p>
            <p>Thus much as to my figure; and <U+017F>ince I am <U+017F>o far in my way, I will give thee a <U+017F>light touch of my humour. 'Tis more than I promis'd; but, to deal freely with thee, Reader, take notice, that this Preface is de<U+017F>ign'd onely to <U+017F>well the Book, upon the importunity of the Seller, who<U+017F>e fear it was, he <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>ave him<U+017F>elf by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Were it not for that, it would be to as little purpo<U+017F>e as many others are. But this is not the fir<U+017F>t time, that <U+017F>ome people <U+017F>hew them<U+017F>elves fools, out of compliance with others, be<U+017F>ides the fooleries they are guilty of upon their own account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60944:9"/>As to my humour then; I am to confe<U+017F>s, that I am <U+017F>omewhat cholerick, a lover of good meat, and inclin'd to <U+017F>loath. I often call my Man fool or coxcomb, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently after, Sir, and Mon<U+017F>ieur. I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I am merry enough in company, and not much un<U+017F>atisfi'd, when I am alone. I endure my mi<U+017F>eries patiently enough. And now I think my Preface is long enough, and that it is time I <U+017F>hould make an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not but that <U+017F>uch an enterprize mu<U+017F>t needs be difficult, <hi>Elvira</hi> is a per<U+017F>on of quality, and very rich, her beauty is <U+017F>uch as you have ob<U+017F>erved it, her virtue not inferiour, and for the <U+017F>pace of two years that <U+017F>he hath been a Widow, the wealthie<U+017F>t for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in <hi>Andaluzia</hi> have not rai<U+017F>ed in her any motions to change her condition. But a per<U+017F>on of your endowments and excellencies may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer that which others have not been able to <U+017F>tand again<U+017F>t. She is a Kin<U+017F>woman of my Wives, and I <U+017F>ometimes vi<U+017F>it her. I <U+017F>hall, if you plea<U+017F>e, acquaint her with your inclinations, and I am the more apt to hope my negotiation may prove effectual, in regard I have the honour to <U+017F>ee her in her Balcony which is over again<U+017F>t us, a favour not ordinary from a Lady <U+017F>o re<U+017F>erv'd, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he might as well <U+017F>hut up her own jealou<U+017F>ies and her windows together, and <U+017F>o make us be laugh'd at after all our gallantry.</q>

The Lady in the Balcony return'd them one not much to be found fault with, which engag'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and his companion to revy it with two others;

                     <l>They thought it full time to depart,</l>

                  <q>Ah! Cou<U+017F>in, <hi><U+017F>ays Don Pedro to Don John,</hi> what probability is there that a <U+017F>tranger <U+017F>hould <U+017F>torm a heart that hath <U+017F>tood out the a<U+017F><U+017F>aults of all the be<U+017F>t and noble<U+017F>t Champions as to quality and de<U+017F>ert that <hi>Sevil</hi> affords? But, <hi>continued he,</hi> <U+017F>ince the little hope I have of obtaining her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is enough to occa<U+017F>ion my death, it will come but all to one, if I hazard my Life upon her denials and di<U+017F>dains. Let me therefore, dear Cou<U+017F>in, intreat you to <U+017F>peak to her, as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly you can, and pre<U+017F>s not to her <U+017F>o much the greatne<U+017F>s of my quality or e<U+017F>tate, as the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was <U+017F>o over head and ears in love, that he could not <U+017F>peak of any thing el<U+017F>e, in <U+017F>o much, that his Cou<U+017F>in perceiv'd the greate<U+017F>t kindne<U+017F>s he could do him, was, to <U+017F>peak with the <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t to <hi>Elvira.</hi> He did it, and that with good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. The fair Widow entertain'd <U+017F>o kindly the Propo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he made on the behalf of his Friend, that <U+017F>he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60944:18"/>
di<U+017F>cover'd rather a <U+017F>atisfaction, than any di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure thereat. But, in An<U+017F>wer thereto, <U+017F>he told him, that having made a vow <U+017F>he would not hear of any addre<U+017F><U+017F>es in order to a <U+017F>econd Marriage till three years were expired after her former Husband's death, no con<U+017F>ideration in the world <U+017F>hould prevail with her to break it. She added further, that out of an exact ob<U+017F>ervance of what <U+017F>he had promi<U+017F>ed the memory of her late Husband, <U+017F>he had till then behaved her <U+017F>elf inflexibly towards all tho<U+017F>e that had made their addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to her; and that if <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had <U+017F>o much command of him<U+017F>elf as to continue his devotions to her for the <U+017F>pace of one whole year, during which time they might become better acquainted one with another, <U+017F>he would promi<U+017F>e never to be any man's Wife but his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don John,</hi> upon his return, gave <hi>Don Pedro</hi> an account of his negotiation, and render'd him the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfied and mo<U+017F>t amorous man in the world. The long time he was to expect troubled him not at all, re<U+017F>olving to employ it in all manner of court<U+017F>hips, worthy atchievments, and adventures, befitting a <U+017F>pruce Lover. He bought a Coach and Hor<U+017F>es, took a Hou<U+017F>e, and entertain'd Servants, <U+017F>et the Embroiderers and Tailors of <hi>Sevil</hi> a <U+017F>ew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Mu<U+017F>icians a <U+017F>inging. He would have pre<U+017F>ented <hi>Elvira</hi> with <U+017F>ome things; but <U+017F>he would by no means permit it. Her Maids were much more ea<U+017F>ily intreated, and received his Pre<U+017F>ents as willingly as he be<U+017F>tow'd them. In a <U+017F>hort time, <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Servants were more at his devotion than at hers, they cau<U+017F>ing her to <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elf in the Balcony, though much again<U+017F>t her humour, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60944:18"/>
often as <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was <U+017F>inging in the Street; in which employment, as I have been told, he was grown to be a Crafts-ma<U+017F>ter, not making u<U+017F>e of his lips and tongue to quaver out the notes as many good Singers do.</p>
               <p>Six Moneths were already pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ince <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had laid a Siege to the affections of <hi>Elvira,</hi> yet had not the lea<U+017F>t private Parley with her; which added daily more and more to the e<U+017F>teem and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion he had for her. At la<U+017F>t, upon an importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Prayers and Pre<U+017F>ents, one of her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, better <U+017F>tored with confidence than any of the re<U+017F>t, or rather better brib'd, promi<U+017F>ed to bring him in the night-time to her Lady's Lodgings, and <U+017F>o to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of him as that he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee her put off her cloaths before <U+017F>he went to bed, walking in her Smock about the chamber for coolne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>inging and playing upon the Lute, which <U+017F>he did admirably well.</p>
               <p>This took <hi>Don Pedro</hi> <U+017F>o highly, that he gave his Intelligencer much beyond what he had promi<U+017F>ed her; <U+017F>o that, night being come, the bold Granadine, according to the Gentlewoman's directions, comes into <hi>Elvira</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>lunk into her lodgings, and there, from a little a<U+017F>cent, which was over again<U+017F>t her chamber-door, he <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>itting on a couch, reading in a Prayer-book, how attentively I know not, while her women were undre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her. She had onely a thin loo<U+017F>e coat about her, and was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on getting into bed when <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Pen<U+017F>ion-Gentlewoman, de<U+017F>irous to give him cau<U+017F>e to be as much <U+017F>atisfied with her as <U+017F>he with him, entreats her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ing. To her's, her Companions added their intreaties; yet <hi>Elvira</hi> put them off a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60944:19"/>
long time, telling them, <U+017F>he was melancholy, nay, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring them <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to be <U+017F>o: but the Gentlewoman who was <U+017F>o much at the devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> having put a Lute into her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s's hands, <hi>Elvira</hi> had the compliance to <U+017F>ing, and did it with <U+017F>o much excellency and delight, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> could hardly forbear ca<U+017F>ting him<U+017F>elf at her feet, there to act the part of the ec<U+017F>tatick Lover. She <U+017F>ung not long, but went to bed: her Women withdrew into their chambers, and <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who would gladly have gotten into the Street, was at a cruel lo<U+017F>s what to do when he found the great Gate fa<U+017F>t. There was no other cour<U+017F>e to be taken, than to expect till it were day. He <U+017F>ate down on the brink of a Well which was at one corner of the Court, in no <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>turbance, by rea<U+017F>on of the fear he was in of being di<U+017F>covered, and to incur the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, for his pre<U+017F>umption.</p>
               <p>While he was thus engaged, his thoughts run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon thou<U+017F>ands of de<U+017F>igns, and tho<U+017F>e attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <U+017F>o many fruitle<U+017F>s wi<U+017F>hes, he perceives a Door opening that belonged to <U+017F>ome part of <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Lodgings. He turn'd toward that <U+017F>ide on which he heard the noi<U+017F>e, and was much at a lo<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ee coming into the Court the fair Widow whom he thought fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep. By the light of a <U+017F>mall Wax-candle <U+017F>he had in her hand, he perceiv'd her night-cloaths were very neat about her head; that <U+017F>he was bare-neck'd, had an excellent Neck-lace of Pearl on, and that upon her Smock, about which was abundance of Lace, <U+017F>he had onely a long rich Mantle. She had in her hand a Silver-plate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Jelly, Sweet-meats, and Con<U+017F>erves; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60944:19"/>
in that <U+017F>trange po<U+017F>ture <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o full of charm and attraction, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was once in a mind to <U+017F>atisfie him<U+017F>elf with the enjoyment of looking on her, though he <U+017F>hould thereby draw on him<U+017F>elf all the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, which a pre<U+017F>umption <U+017F>o great might ju<U+017F>tly de<U+017F>erve. But upon better thoughts he hid him<U+017F>elf behind the Well, yet <U+017F>o as that he <U+017F>till ob<U+017F>erv'd his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, flattering him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with an imagination, that he was the per<U+017F>on <U+017F>he <U+017F>ought after. She went on towards the Stable, whither <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> at a di<U+017F>tance, follow'd her, and <U+017F>aw her go into a little Chamber. The fir<U+017F>t appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ion he had, was, that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, out of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s of pious charity, went to vi<U+017F>it <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervant of the Hou<U+017F>e that was <U+017F>ick, though, without any prejudice to her charitable inclinations, <U+017F>he might have put that employment upon <U+017F>ome one of her women. He hid him<U+017F>elf behind a hor<U+017F>e, which <U+017F>tood not far from the door of the Chamber, and thence ob<U+017F>erving his dear Widow, he <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>et down, on a little Table, the Candle<U+017F>tick, the Plate, and whatever el<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had brought that was burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome to her Ivory hands; and perceiv'd, in a bed which took up almo<U+017F>t all the Chamber, a Blacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more that was <U+017F>ick, who <U+017F>eem'd to be about thirty years of age, but <U+017F>o deformed, and of <U+017F>o dreadful a look, that he was in a manner frightned at the <U+017F>ight of him. His meagre countenance, and the painful emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of his breath argu'd him very <U+017F>ick and much <U+017F>pent. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> could not but admire the unparallel'd goodne<U+017F>s of the fair <hi>Elvira,</hi> who took up the Negro's coverlet, and having thru<U+017F>t up his head, <U+017F>ate down by the <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on, and put her hand on his fore-head, all wet, haply with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60944:20"/>
the <U+017F>weats and pains of approaching death. The Negro beheld, with a ga<U+017F>tly look, the charitable Angel that came to comfort him, and who <U+017F>till view'd him with tears in her eyes. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> knew not what he <U+017F>hould think of a charity <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>cendent, and having for a while admir'd it, he began to think it exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive: but as yet he had not <U+017F>een any thing.</p>
               <p>At la<U+017F>t, the fair Widow breaking forth into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, yet weeping as if it had been at the taking of a final farewel, <U+017F>he ask'd the Negro, How he did<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                  <q>My dear Anthony, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him with a voice interrupted by <U+017F>obbs,</hi> Art thou then re<U+017F>olv'd to dy, and, with thy own, to be my death too?

               </p>
               <p>To this effect were her expo<U+017F>tulations, joyning her angelical face to the diabolical countenance of the Moor, which <U+017F>he bedew'd with her tears. I am apt to imagine that who ever had <U+017F>een <U+017F>uch a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion, would have taken it for an Angel embracing a Devil. As for our <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> he began to think his fair <hi>Elvira</hi> as ugly as her Negro, who at la<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>ting his eyes on his importunate Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, whom he had not till then vouch<U+017F>af'd a look, and with his <U+017F>craggy hand removing her face from his own, <U+017F>aid to her, with a hollow voice;

               <p>Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he <U+017F>lunk down into the bed, <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly, that the unfortunate <hi>Elvira</hi> could not get a word from him by way of return, notwith<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es both of words and ge<U+017F>tures <U+017F>he us'd towards him; whether it were that he was already dead, or ob<U+017F>tinately re<U+017F>olv'd, not to <U+017F>peak to a per<U+017F>on whom he thought the occa<U+017F>ion of his death. <hi>Elvira,</hi> melted into tears, and in a manner out of her <U+017F>elf, to <U+017F>ee what a <U+017F>ad condition <U+017F>he left her dear Negro in, and mo<U+017F>t of all to con<U+017F>ider his inhumanity towards her, took up all <U+017F>he had brought with her, and return'd to her chamber, with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s and affliction in her countenance, that it was much to her lo<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he had not been <U+017F>een in that po<U+017F>ture by her apo<U+017F>tate Lover, <hi>Don Pedro.</hi>

                  <hi>Don Pedro</hi> read over the Letter twice or thrice, <U+017F>o much ado had he to believe what he read. He con<U+017F>ider'd with him<U+017F>elf that he had been twice in danger to have been as unfortunately married as any man in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <U+017F>ent up his hearty thanks to Heaven which had enabled him to e<U+017F>cape it, by di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to him two <U+017F>ecrets of <U+017F>o great importance. The re<U+017F>olution of marrying <U+017F>uddenly, which the Negro's death had put <hi>Elvira</hi> upon, rais'd in <hi>Don Pedro</hi> a quite contrary, which was, that of getting from her as <U+017F>oon as he could. He therefore told <hi>Don John,</hi> that it concern'd both his life and honour, that he <U+017F>hould be out of <hi>Sevil</hi> within an hour, and that he would take along with him onely that <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom he had brought from <hi>Granada.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to <U+017F>ell his Coach and Hor<U+017F>es, and with the mony to di<U+017F>charge his Servants; but above all things he de<U+017F>ir'd him not to make any enquiry after the occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden a change, and <U+017F>o unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a departure, promi<U+017F>ing to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in writing from the fir<U+017F>t place he <U+017F>hould make any <U+017F>tay at. He writ to <hi>Elvira,</hi> while <U+017F>ome were gone to take up two Mules for him; he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd his Letter to the <U+017F>lave, and, the Mules being come, took his way towards <hi>Madrid,</hi> confirm'd, more than ever, in his former opinion, of being di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru<U+017F>tful of all women of more than ordinary wit, nay indeed to have a horrour of them. While he is

               <p>By this time was <hi>Don Pedro</hi> got to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he alighted at an Uncle's of his, who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him very kindly.

               <p>But not unwilling to make a full di<U+017F>covery of him<U+017F>elf;
<q>This conformity of Adventures, <hi><U+017F>aid he to Don Pedro,</hi> very much heightned the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love we had for one another, though it <U+017F>till kept us both within the limits of civility and our duty, when ever our pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd us to prefer our <U+017F>atisfaction before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements wherein we were involv'd upon the account of our Families.

               <p>But it was not long ere the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ad reflections were interrupted, and his ju<U+017F>t fears heightned by his Bed-fellow's turning to him, and ca<U+017F>ting his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<U+017F>ome arm about his neck, as if he would have embrac'd his wife. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> <U+017F>omewhat frighten'd at tho<U+017F>e unwelcome care<U+017F><U+017F>es, the more haply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e accompani'd with certain words imperfectly uttered, made a <U+017F>hift to disburthen him<U+017F>elf of the arm which he thought more weighty than a far heavier burthen, and <U+017F>lipp'd his neck from under it,

taking great care not to do him any hurt; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>o done, he got to the bed-<U+017F>ide, with his body <U+017F>o far over, that he had much ado to keep in the bed, wi<U+017F>hing his life fairly at an end, and blaming onely him<U+017F>elf for running <U+017F>o great a hazard to comply with the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of two indi<U+017F>creet Lovers. He had hardly time to breathe, and recover his <U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ever <U+017F>o little, ere the unquiet Bed-fellow thru<U+017F>t in his legs between his; which la<U+017F>t action, added to the foregoing per<U+017F>ecutions, made him look pale as death it <U+017F>elf.

               <p>He got out of bed as gently as he could, and went to open the door, which he found very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully double lock'd, a misfortune as indige<U+017F>tible as any of the precedent. As he was trying, to little purpo<U+017F>e, to thru<U+017F>t back the lock, it flew open of a <U+017F>udden, and the door had almo<U+017F>t taken him over the face. <hi>Virginia</hi> comes into the room as it were in much ha<U+017F>te, and ask'd him loud enough, Whither he made <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te? <hi>Don Pedro</hi> entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with a low voice to <U+017F>peak more gently, ask'd her whether <U+017F>he were mad to hazard in that manner the waking of her husband, and de<U+017F>ir'd her <U+017F>he would let him out.
<q>How! go out? <hi>replies the Lady with a loud voice.</hi> No, I would have my husband <U+017F>ee what bed-fellow he hath had to night, that he may <U+017F>ee the fruits of his own jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie, and what I am able to do.</q>

               <p>Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, bold as a Lione<U+017F>s <U+017F>he took <hi>Don Pedro</hi> by the arm; then, in <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>turbance as that

he had not the <U+017F>trength to get from her, open'd the <U+017F>hutters of the windows, without letting go her prize, and dragging him to the bed-<U+017F>ide, drew the curtains, <U+017F>aying aloud,

                  <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was not <U+017F>o <U+017F>cared, but that he had the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to look into that dreadful bed, where, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/><U+017F>tead of the imagin'd Satyre, he found his amiable <hi>Violanta,</hi> who had lain with him, and not <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>'s husband, who was gone into the Country eight days before.

At la<U+017F>t <hi>Virginia</hi> took pity of him, and left him and her Cou<U+017F>in to them<U+017F>elves, to make up the accounts that were between them, which were of <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>equence, for it took up their time from morning till it was noon. From that time, while the Husband was in the Country, the two he-Cou<U+017F>ins and the two <U+017F>he-Cou<U+017F>ins had frequent meetings, and made their advantages of the opportunity.

He was <U+017F>o deeply in love with her, that he earne<U+017F>tly wi<U+017F>h'd him<U+017F>elf married to her, but when he made any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>al of that nature to her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omely put off the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that he knew not whether it were out of de<U+017F>ign, or that <U+017F>he minded not much what he <U+017F>aid to her. At la<U+017F>t, to confirm the general opinion, that this world is a Stage of perpetual changes, <hi>Violanta</hi> began to remit much of her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and by little and little grew to that coldne<U+017F>s towards <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that he could not forbear complaining of it, and, not knowing what to quarrel at, charg'd her with infidelity, reproaching her, that <U+017F>he had entertain'd <U+017F>ome other Gallant into her favour.</p>
               <p>But in<U+017F>tead of recovering him<U+017F>elf by this means into that place in her affections which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed, it made him <U+017F>o in<U+017F>upportable to <hi>Violanta,</hi> that <U+017F>he did not onely forbear the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>he did him in the night, but could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his company in the day time. Yet was he not a jot ca<U+017F>t down at it. He, by the charms of a many Pre<U+017F>ents, prevail'd <U+017F>o far with one of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, treacherous enough of her own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that <U+017F>he di<U+017F>cover'd to him, that her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was extremely taken with her Cou<U+017F>in's Brother-in-law, who was then ju<U+017F>t come from the Univer<U+017F>ity; that he was a very hand<U+017F>ome young man, and no le<U+017F>s in love with <hi>Violanta,</hi> than <hi>Violanta</hi> was with him. To act <U+017F>omething notorious for the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of it, this wicked Wench advi<U+017F>ed him to

Her complexion, which now had doubled the hue of its native carnation, appear'd brighter to <hi>Don Pedro</hi> than the Sun in a Summers day, and his face too had a little touch of the violent inclining to red.</p>
               <p>But as they were beholding one another with much confidence and <U+017F>atisfaction, an alarm came to the Dutche<U+017F>s, that the Duke her husband was come into the Court. All <U+017F>he could do upon <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden notice, was, to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e her much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd Gallant into a Clo<U+017F>et where <U+017F>he kept her perfum'd waters, and, having lock'd him in, to ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf on a Bed. The Duke, who was a man of three<U+017F>core years of age at lea<U+017F>t, comes into his Lady's Clo<U+017F>et, and finds her fre<U+017F>h as a ro<U+017F>e upon the bu<U+017F>h. He told her, that a Letter he had receiv'd from the Vice-roy had occa<U+017F>ion'd his return <U+017F>ooner than he expected. He was grown very hungry, ordered to be brought him into the Clo<U+017F>et what there was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Dutche<U+017F>s, though <U+017F>he had no great <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to eat any thing with him, while her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <U+017F>hook, or haply did <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e, for fear,

yet took a Chair and <U+017F>at near the Table. She was of a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition extreamly inclin'd to make <U+017F>port, and <U+017F>o divertive, as that it, in a manner, retriv'd her old husband into youth again, <U+017F>o much was he pleas'd at every thing <U+017F>he did. It was an ordinary thing between them to lay extravagant wagers, and that mo<U+017F>t commonly when <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion or humour to get money out of him, which the <U+017F>imple man took great delight to loo<U+017F>e, as one that inexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ibly doted on <U+017F>o excellent a woman.</p>
               <p>He never admir'd her <U+017F>o much as at this time; She, to heighten his admiration, told him a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred plea<U+017F>ant <U+017F>tories; at which the good Duke was ready to bur<U+017F>t with Laughing; for eating with a good <U+017F>tomack, and at the <U+017F>ame time laughing very heartily, he was two or three times <U+017F>o near choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they were forc'd to give him <U+017F>uch thumps in the back, as he would have taken very unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at another time: but through God's mercy, he got no hurt, onely a crum or two mi<U+017F>s'd their way down his throat. At la<U+017F>t, the Dutche<U+017F>s, who had a malicious humour to make <U+017F>port at any thing, would needs divert her <U+017F>elf at the co<U+017F>t of her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>on'd Gallant. She told the Duke, that it <U+017F>eem'd a long time to her <U+017F>ince they had laid any wager; and that <U+017F>he would gladly lay a hundred Pi<U+017F>tols with him, upon <U+017F>uch a match and tearms as they <U+017F>hould agree upon. The Duke told her he was at her <U+017F>ervice, and expected what <U+017F>he would propo<U+017F>e. The Dutche<U+017F>s made many propo<U+017F>als to him, which <U+017F>he was confident he would not accept; and at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he ask'd him, whether he would lay any wager, that he nam'd all tho<U+017F>e things, requi<U+017F>ite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a hou<U+017F>e, that were made of iron. The Duke

took her up, though he thought the wager very extravagant, and having call'd for pen, ink, and paper, as <U+017F>oon as they had taken away, and his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner <U+017F>aid Grace (for the Duke was a man of good example) he writ down the names of all the Iron things he could think on; But <U+017F>uch was the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>s's good fortune, as that he forgot to <U+017F>et down Keys. She caus'd him divers times to read over what he had writ, and having ask'd him whether he had any thing to add, <U+017F>he folded up the paper, and told him <U+017F>he would take time to examine it, and in the interim acquaint him with an adventure had happened to her, one of the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant he had ever heard of.</p>

Take heed another time you be not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie of belief, as to receive for true what is pure fiction and Romance.

               <p>The Dutche<U+017F>s <U+017F>poke this with <U+017F>uch a confident indifference, that the Duke was more ea<U+017F>ily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to believe all <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid was fabulous, than he had been to think it true. He laugh'd at all, as if he had been little better than out of his wits; he admir'd the miraculous ingenuity of his wife, and oblig'd all his dome<U+017F>ticks that were pre<U+017F>ent to a like admiration, who were haply as credulous fools as their Ma<U+017F>ter.

and laughter,</hi> do but <U+017F>ee, with what artifices <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>atisfi'd me that I had lo<U+017F>t my wager.</q> The Dutche<U+017F>s was ready to bur<U+017F>t with laughing, her Gentlewomen were not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> in the clo<U+017F>et was forc'd to adde to the Dutche<U+017F>s's perfum'd waters, the better to <U+017F>mother his joy. At la<U+017F>t having given his Steward order to deliver his Lady the hundred Pi<U+017F>tols, he took his leave of her and went to his own lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, often telling her, one while, that <U+017F>he was a female Devil, another, that <U+017F>he had a wit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention beyond the Devil. The <U+017F>ervants repeated the <U+017F>ame thing after their Ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>o that till he was abed and a<U+017F>leep, nothing was talk'd of about the hou<U+017F>e, but the damnable wit of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Dutche<U+017F>s being paid the hundred Pi<U+017F>tols by the Steward, caus'd the chamber-door to be lock'd; and having brought <hi>Don Pedro</hi> out of his impri<U+017F>onment, not fully recover'd of the fear <U+017F>he had put him into, <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>s'd him to acknowledge, that a witty and di<U+017F>creet woman may, without prejudice to her honour, <U+017F>alve a misfortune, whereof the very thought would make a <U+017F>imple one die for fear. She would needs have him eat of what her Women had brought up for her <U+017F>elf. He intreated her to excu<U+017F>e him, and to di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s him as <U+017F>oon as might be. She gave him the hundred Pi<U+017F>tols <U+017F>he had got of her Husband, with a Gold-chain, and her own Picture, which amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to as much, and de<U+017F>ir'd him to remember her, and to give her an account of his further Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Having thereupon embrac'd him with much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60944:37"/>
<U+017F>he recommended him to the conduct of her Women, who put him and his Mule <U+017F>ecretly out at a back-door. He thought it no prudence to lodge in that place, but to ride forward two Leagues, to the Town where he thought to have din'd the day before, when the Dutche<U+017F>s retain'd him.</p>
               <p>As he rid along, what had hapned to him with the amorous Dutche<U+017F>s was perpetually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent to his thoughts. He could not <U+017F>ufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, at lea<U+017F>t as he then thought, the readine<U+017F>s wherewith at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight <U+017F>he entertain'd his affection, even before <U+017F>he knew him; her confidence to make <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange and plea<U+017F>ant a <U+017F>tory to the Duke, which yet was but too true; and la<U+017F>tly, her <U+017F>ubtilty in <U+017F>alving all by applying it to the Wager. He could not al<U+017F>o but admire the ea<U+017F>ie nature and <U+017F>implicity of the Duke; he pitied him, and, after all accidents and circum<U+017F>tances weigh'd, was confirm'd more than ever in the opinion, that a witty Woman was of a difficult keeping; and thence inferr'd, that, if the Dutche<U+017F>s had not been over-confident of her own wit, <U+017F>he would not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily have executed what <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to do, nor have been guilty of a pre<U+017F>umption <U+017F>o incredible as to declare it to her Husband.</p>
               <p>In fine, from all the Adventures he had run through, and all the experiences he had of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he deriv'd a certain confidence, that he <U+017F>hould never run the hazard of being unfortunately married, either by not taking any Wife at all, or marrying one <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple, as knew no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween love and aver<U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>Amid<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e reflections he arriv'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60944:38"/>
where he found his Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Don Rodrigues</hi> po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of his Father's e<U+017F>tate, and married to his Cou<U+017F>in. He under<U+017F>tood from him, that <hi>Violanta</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and that the fair <hi>Virginia</hi> was gone to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> with her Husband. From <hi>Madrid</hi> he took his journey for <hi>Granada.</hi> He alighted at his Aunt's, who entertain'd him with inexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible kindne<U+017F>s, and acquainted him that <hi>Seraphina</hi> led a Saint's life in the Nunnery, and that her beloved Servant was dead, out of pure grief and indignation that he had not prevail'd with her, to quit the holy life <U+017F>he had oblig'd her <U+017F>elf to, and marry him.</p>
               <p>The next day he went along with his Aunt to <U+017F>ee young <hi>Laura, Seraphina</hi>'s daughter, <U+017F>he had been put into a Convent at four years of age, and might then be about <U+017F>ixteen or <U+017F>eventeen.

He doubted not but that he had found out what he <U+017F>ought; and what made him have a greater inclination for <hi>Laura,</hi> was, that he had had a great love for <hi>Seraphina,</hi> and perceiv'd her daughter to be much like her, though incomparably more hand<U+017F>ome. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his Aunt that <U+017F>he was not his daughter, and how that he had <U+017F>ome intentions to marry her: His Aunt encourag'd him in his de<U+017F>ign, and acquainted <hi>Laura</hi> therewith, who expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed not any either <U+017F>atisfaction or di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfaction thereat. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> took order for the furni<U+017F>hing of his

He made her cloaths as rich and <U+017F>umptuous as any could be had in <hi>Granada.</hi> All the per<U+017F>ons of quality about the City were at the Wedding, and were no le<U+017F>s <U+017F>atisfi'd with <hi>Laura</hi>'s beauty, than di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfi'd with her want of under<U+017F>tanding. The ceremonies of the wedding were over in very good time, <U+017F>o that the new married couple were left alone. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> order'd his Servants to go to their beds, and having <U+017F>ent away his wife's maids, after they had undre<U+017F>s'd her, lock'd the chamber door.</p>
               <p>Having thus order'd things, <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> out of a tran<U+017F>cendency of prudence, which was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t madne<U+017F>s in the world, put in execution the mo<U+017F>t fanta<U+017F>tick de<U+017F>ign that could fall into the imagination of a man, who had all his life been accounted a per<U+017F>on of under<U+017F>tanding. Being more fool than his wife was <U+017F>imple, he would needs try how far he might tru<U+017F>t her <U+017F>implicity. He <U+017F>et him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf in a chair, caus'd his wife to <U+017F>tand before him, and <U+017F>aid the<U+017F>e words to her, or others haply no le<U+017F>s impertinent;

<q>Do you know, <hi>continu'd Don Pedro,</hi> what kind of life per<U+017F>ons that are married do lead?

                  <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfi'd man in the world, to find his wife much more <U+017F>imple than he could well have expected. He drew out of a clo<U+017F>et that was in the chamber a <U+017F>uit of Armour, very rich and very light, which he had <U+017F>ometime worn at a magnificent reception, which the City had made for the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> He put his idiot-wife into them, he put on her head a little gilt Head-piece cover'd with a plume of feathers, girt a <U+017F>hort Sword to her <U+017F>ide, and having put a Lance into her hand, told her, that the duty of <U+017F>uch married Women as would be accounted virtuous, was, to watch their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands while they <U+017F>lept, arm'd all over as <U+017F>he then was. She made him no an<U+017F>wer; but with her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reverences, which had not haply been at an end a good while, if he had not commanded her to take two or three turns about the chamber<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> which <U+017F>he did by chance with <U+017F>o much Maje<U+017F>ty, (her natural beauty, and <hi>Pallas</hi>-like accoutrements contributing much thereto) that the over-<U+017F>ubtil <hi>Granadin</hi> was in a manner out of him<U+017F>elf for joy to <U+017F>ee it. He went to bed, and <hi>Laura</hi> continu'd in the po<U+017F>ture he had left her in, till five in the morning.</p>
               <p>The mo<U+017F>t prudent and mo<U+017F>t circum<U+017F>pect of all the Husbands that ever were, at lea<U+017F>t who thought

He order'd her to lie a bed till it were very late, and having commanded the Maids not to di<U+017F>turb her, he went to Ma<U+017F>s, and thence about his occa<U+017F>ions; for I had forgot to tell you, that he had bought an Office at <hi>Granada,</hi> <U+017F>uch as might be that of a perpetual Major or Sheriff.</p>
               <p>The fir<U+017F>t night of the Nuptials was <U+017F>pent in the manner you heard, and the Husband was <U+017F>uch a Coxcomb as to make no better u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.

He had no more time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him than to <U+017F>hift him<U+017F>elf, to put on other cloaths, and to take leave of his wife, whom he commanded, upon pain of God's di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure and his own, exactly to ob<U+017F>erve, in his ab<U+017F>ence, the life that married women were to lead.</p>
               <p>Tho<U+017F>e who have any thing to do at Court, are uncertain how long it may be, ere they are di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> thought not to have <U+017F>taid abroad above five or <U+017F>ix days, but his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s kept him there like a Burre, now <U+017F>ticking to one Courtier, anon to another, for four or five months; in the mean time, the <U+017F>imple <hi>Laura</hi> neglected not her duty, <U+017F>pent the nights according to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's order, in armour, and the days that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

                  <hi>Helenilla</hi> and <hi>Mendez</hi> were lamenting in this manner, as if it had been upon a wager, when <hi>Montufar</hi> and the Lacquey, upon a <U+017F>ignal agreed

betwixt them, were heard at the Chamber-door <U+017F>ighing and weeping, though not <U+017F>o violently as tho<U+017F>e by the Bed-<U+017F>ide, who yet upon that new Con<U+017F>ort, took occa<U+017F>ion to renew their Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The old Marque<U+017F>s was out of him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o much weeping, and not know the occa<U+017F>ion of it. He wept too, as well as he could make a <U+017F>hift to do it; <U+017F>obb'd as vigorou<U+017F>ly as any in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and intreated the di<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Ladies, for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's <U+017F>ake, and all in it, to moderate their affliction, and to acquaint him with the occa<U+017F>ion thereof, a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uring them his life <U+017F>hould be the lea<U+017F>t thing he would hazard and <U+017F>acrifice to <U+017F>erve them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretting his pa<U+017F>t youth, as being now uncapable to give them effectual demon<U+017F>trations of the <U+017F>incerity of his good intentions.</p>
               <p>They were a little appea<U+017F>ed at the<U+017F>e words, their countenances appear'd more plea<U+017F>ant, and they thought they had wept enough, becau<U+017F>e they could not, without <U+017F>ome violence to them<U+017F>elves, weep any more.

Go on, Madam, go on, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me for interrupting you.</q> The old Woman, in<U+017F>tead of making any an<U+017F>wer began to weep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre<U+017F>h, <U+017F>o that <hi>Helenilla</hi> was forced to go on with the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.
<q>Since you know by experience, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,</hi> that your Nephew is a per<U+017F>on, that, of any man, hath lea<U+017F>t command of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and that you have been often troubled to <U+017F>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reports of his violences, you will be the more ea<U+017F>ily induced to credit that which he hath done me. Being at <hi>Leon</hi> the la<U+017F>t Spring, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I conceive you had <U+017F>ent him, he meets with me in a Church, and upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight told me <U+017F>uch things, as, had they been true, we <U+017F>hould both have continued <U+017F>till in that Church to avoid the Hands of Ju<U+017F>tice, I as a Murdere<U+017F>s, he as the dead man I had killed and made ready to be put into the ground. He told me a hundred times that my eyes had murder'd him, nay, he omitted not the lea<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e flatteries and in<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations which are ordinary among Lovers, who would abu<U+017F>e their <U+017F>implicity upon whom they have <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>ign. He follow'd me to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rode every day up and down before my Windows, and every night importuned all the Neighbour-hood with the Mu<U+017F>ick he intended onely for me. At la<U+017F>t, perceiving that all his amorous addre<U+017F><U+017F>es prevailed nothing, he with

Pre<U+017F>ents corrupted a Negro-<U+017F>lave that I had, and, through her treachery and advice, <U+017F>urprized me in a Garden we had in the Suburbs. I had no body with me but the perfidious <U+017F>lave; he had in company with him a man as lewd as him<U+017F>elf, and had given money to the Gardener to go an Errand for him to the other end of the Town, upon pretence of <U+017F>ome important bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. What need I make many words, he <U+017F>et his Dagger to my Throat, and finding neverthele<U+017F>s that I had a greater value for my Honour than my Life, with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his Complice, he did that by violence, which all his court<U+017F>hip and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities <U+017F>hould never have obtain'd. The Slave made no <U+017F>mall <U+017F>tir, and the better to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e her perdiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, got a <U+017F>leight wound in one of her hands, and pre<U+017F>ently after fell into a feigned <U+017F>wound. The Gardener returns: Your Nephew frightned at the thought of his crime got away over the Garden-wall, with <U+017F>o much precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he let fall his Dagger, which I took up. Yet needed not the in<U+017F>olent young man have been in <U+017F>uch fear; for being not in a capacity to cau<U+017F>e him to be <U+017F>taid, I might have had that command of my <U+017F>elf as to put a good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance on it, and di<U+017F><U+017F>emble the horrid misfortune that had happened to me. I did what I could, not to appear more <U+017F>ad than I was wont to do. The wicked <U+017F>lave not long after run quite away. I lo<U+017F>t my Mother, and I may <U+017F>ay, I had with her lo<U+017F>t all, if my Aunt, who is here come along with me, had not had the goodne<U+017F>s to give me entertainment, which <U+017F>he does <U+017F>o nobly, as that I have the <U+017F>ame treatment with her own two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

Daughters. In her hou<U+017F>e it was that I heard, your Nephew is <U+017F>o far from thinking of any reparation for the wrong he hath done me, that he is upon Marriage in this City. I have made the greate<U+017F>t ha<U+017F>te I could hither, to the end that before I go out of your Chamber, you <U+017F>hould give me in money or jewels two thou<U+017F>and Crowns, to put my <U+017F>elf into a Nunnery: for knowing as much as I do by experience of the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of your Nephew, I could never fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to marry him, though he and all the Friends he hath <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e all the proffers and intreaties that may be to per<U+017F>wade me to it. I know he is to be married this night, but I'l break off the match if I can, at lea<U+017F>t make a di<U+017F>turbance he <U+017F>hall hear of while he lives, if you do not take that cour<U+017F>e to prevent it which I propo<U+017F>e to you. And that you may be <U+017F>atisfi'd, <hi>added <U+017F>he,</hi> that there cannot be any thing more true, than what I tell you, of the violence your Nephew hath done me, behold the very Dagger he <U+017F>et to my Throat!

               <p>Having given over <U+017F>peaking, <U+017F>he be<U+017F>et her <U+017F>elf to weeping afre<U+017F>h. <hi>Mendez</hi> kept <U+017F>till a note above her, and the mu<U+017F>ical con<U+017F>ort at the door, whereof the little Lacquey made the treble and <hi>Montufar</hi> the ba<U+017F>e, was no le<U+017F>s ambitious to be heard.</p>
               <p>The old Marque<U+017F>s, who had already given but too much credit to what had been <U+017F>aid to him, by the craftie<U+017F>t of all Woman-kind, no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t his Eye on the Dagger, but he immediately knew it to be the <U+017F>ame he had <U+017F>ometime given his Nephew.

All therefore his thoughts ran upon was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the di<U+017F>turbance which might happen at his Nephew's wedding. He would gladly have <U+017F>ent for him, but he was afraid <U+017F>ome body might be <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>itive as to ask what <U+017F>hould be the occa<U+017F>ion of his <U+017F>o doing; and, as it happens our fears are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary when our de<U+017F>ires are <U+017F>uch, he no <U+017F>ooner perceiv'd the afflicted Ladies making as if they would go and break off the match, which it had co<U+017F>t him abundance of trouble to bring to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture it was in, but he commands one of the Pages to bring a certain Cabinet, and to take out of it two thou<U+017F>and Crowns in pieces of Gold of four Pi<U+017F>tols. <hi>Montufar</hi> receiv'd them, and told them very exactly one after another; whereupon the old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>s, having made them promi<U+017F>e to give him a vi<U+017F>it the next day, made a thou<U+017F>and excu<U+017F>es to the Ladies, that he was not in a condition to wait on them to their Coach. They got into it very well <U+017F>atisfi'd with their vi<U+017F>it, and made the Coach-man drive back again towards <hi>Madrid,</hi> bethinking them<U+017F>elves that if they were pur<U+017F>u'd, it would be towards <hi>Leon.</hi> Their Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s in the mean time, <U+017F>eeing her gue<U+017F>ts were vani<U+017F>h'd, goes into the Chamber: She finds the Page in the Clo<U+017F>et, who could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what rea<U+017F>on they had to lock him in there; <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffer'd him to go his ways becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew him, or rather becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he found all things as <U+017F>hould be in the Chamber. Tho<U+017F>e, who make it their profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion to <U+017F>teal, and think of no other way of livelihood, <U+017F>tand in little fear of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are <U+017F>o much the more afraid of Men.

have <U+017F>et foot in a place, they make their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and then <U+017F>hift into another.

               <p>But alas! <hi>Helenilla, Mendez,</hi> and <hi>Montufar,</hi> were little troubled with <U+017F>uch reflections as the<U+017F>e their thoughts were wholly <U+017F>et upon the cruel fear they were in of being pur<U+017F>u'd.

                  <q>Thou art then to know, that my Father was born in <hi>Galicia,</hi> by profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion a Lacquey, or, to <U+017F>peak more honourably of him, a Serving-man. He had a great veneration for the memory of the Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> for his excellent invention of the Vine, and indeed, abating the inclination he had to the juice of that noble Plant, it may be <U+017F>aid of him, that he car'd not much for the temporal goods of this world. My Mother was of <hi>Granada,</hi> by condition, (to be free with you) a Slave: but there's no conte<U+017F>ting with the Stars. She an<U+017F>wer'd to the name of <hi>Mary,</hi> which her Ma<U+017F>ters had given her, and it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the name <U+017F>he receiv'd at her Bapti<U+017F>m, but <U+017F>he would have taken it more kindly if one call'd her <hi>Zara,</hi> which was her name before <U+017F>he was converted from the <hi>Turki<U+017F>h</hi> Religion; for (<U+017F>ince I mu<U+017F>t tell you all) <U+017F>he was a <hi>Chri<U+017F>tian</hi> onely out of compliance, and conformity, but in heart a <hi>Moor.</hi> Yet would <U+017F>he often go to Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but rather to di<U+017F>cover the <U+017F>ins of her Ma<U+017F>ters, than her own; and whereas <U+017F>he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd her Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or much more with the hard<U+017F>hips and inconveniences of her Services, than her own imperfections, and made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve miracles of her patience; He, being a very holy man, and mea<U+017F>uring others by him<U+017F>elf, took all for true that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, and, in<U+017F>tead of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, commended her, <U+017F>o that who <U+017F>hould have been near my Mother at Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, would have

I pluck'd up a good heart, though I were yet but very young. I felt all about the folds of my Mother's cloaths; but there was nothing to be expected after the exact Searchers that had been there before me.

<q>Your Lord<U+017F>hip's head, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him,</hi> burns extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and I am much in fear this unhappy accident will be the occa<U+017F>ion of your marching off to <U+017F>ee your friends in the other world, without afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you the time to come to your <U+017F>elf again. Take therefore this pair of Beads, <hi>added <U+017F>he,</hi> and fall devoutly to your prayers till <U+017F>uch time as the Confe<U+017F><U+017F>our comes. You will be <U+017F>o far in your way as to the di<U+017F>charge of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cience. But if credit may be given to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>toriographers of the Pri<U+017F>on for Malefactors at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who have <U+017F>o often had occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>pend their Pens in <U+017F>etting down your atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, your Lord<U+017F>hip's exemplary life may well exempt you from much Penance; be<U+017F>ides that, God, who is very merciful, will no doubt put to your account in Heaven, the glorious progre<U+017F>s you made bare-<U+017F>houlder'd through the principal Streets of <hi>Sevil,</hi> in the <U+017F>ight of <U+017F>o many people, and guarded by Beadles, and other Officers of the Garri<U+017F>on of common Rogues, Cut-pur<U+017F>es, and Hou<U+017F>e-breakers. You may al<U+017F>o produce as an acquittance for your further di<U+017F>charge, the Voyage you made by Sea, during which, <hi>viz.</hi> for the <U+017F>pace of <U+017F>ix years, you did many things not unplea<U+017F>ing to God, taking much pains, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little, and being <U+017F>till in danger, and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the more devout; but what is more con<U+017F>iderable, is, that you were hardly twenty years of age, when, to the great edification of your Neighbour you began that holy Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. Moreover, it is very probable you will
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60944:63"/>
be well recompens'd in the other world for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, which is, your care, that the Women who have had any dependance on you, <U+017F>hould not be idle or want <U+017F>omething to do, making them work, and live, not onely by the labour of their hands, but that of their whole body. To this I may add, that if you dye in your Bed, you will put a plea<U+017F>ant trick upon the Judge of <hi>Murcia,</hi> who hath <U+017F>olemnly <U+017F>worn, he would <U+017F>entence you to dye upon the Wheel, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the <U+017F>atisfaction to <U+017F>ee it; and who mu<U+017F>t needs be enrag'd when it <U+017F>hall be told him, that you dy'd of your <U+017F>elf, without the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of any third per<U+017F>on. But I trifle away the day here in talking, and never think it is time to <U+017F>et forward on the journey we have a de<U+017F>ire to make.

               <p>
                  <hi>Montufar,</hi> who was us'd to their Abu<U+017F>es, who had al<U+017F>o the faculty to return them as good as they brought, and who fondly imagin'd all they had <U+017F>aid to him, was onely for his diver<U+017F>ion, look'd on them as they departed from him, without the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, more inclin'd to conceive they went to give order for his Broths. He <U+017F>oon after, out of pure <U+017F>ecurity, fell into a little Drow<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, which held him <U+017F>o long as that the two Gentlewomen
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60944:63"/>
might well be gotten a League or better in their way, before he was perfectly awake. He ask'd the Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s for them, who told him they were gone abroad, and had given order he <U+017F>hould not be di<U+017F>turb'd, for that he wanted <U+017F>leep very much, having not clos'd his Eyes all the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Upon this account of them, <hi>Montufar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to believe, the Ladies had <U+017F>poken to him in good earne<U+017F>t. He <U+017F>wore at <U+017F>uch a rate as would have made <U+017F>ome think the Earth might open and <U+017F>wallow down the Inn and all in it; he threatned even to the very way they travell'd on, and the Sun that lighted them. He would needs get up to put on his Cloaths, and had almo<U+017F>t broke his Neck in attempting it, <U+017F>uch was his weakne<U+017F>s. The Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s endeavour'd to excu<U+017F>e the Ladies, and did it the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>he could, but with <U+017F>uch impertinent Rea<U+017F>ons that the <U+017F>ick man was the more enrag'd, and fell out with her. He was <U+017F>o incens'd that for four and twenty hours nothing went down his throat, and that diet with abundance of rage and fury prov'd <U+017F>o effectual, that after the taking of a certain Broath, he found him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>trong enough to pur<U+017F>ue his fugitive Slaves. They were got as far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him as they were able to travel in two days; but two Hackney Mules, he fortunately met with upon their return to <hi>Burgos,</hi> contributed as much to his de<U+017F>ign as it prov'd fatal to that of the two counterfeit Pilgrims. He overtook them within <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even Leagues of <hi>Burgos.</hi> They grew pale, and then blu<U+017F>h'd when they <U+017F>aw him, and excus'd them<U+017F>elves, if any <U+017F>uch thing could be done. <hi>Montufar</hi> <U+017F>mother'd his anger, for very joy that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60944:64"/>
he had found them, which he could not forbear expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing in his very countenance. He fir<U+017F>t broke forth into a Laughter at the trick they had put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and rais'd them to <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ecurity, that they thought him the verie<U+017F>t Sot they had ever met with. He thereupon made them believe they were out of the way to <hi>Burgos,</hi> and having (to bring them into it) led them among Rocks and Precipices, <U+017F>uch places as he knew no man travell'd through, he drew a long Dagger, an In<U+017F>trument for which they had ever had a great re<U+017F>pect; and commanded them very imperiou<U+017F>ly to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent delivery of what Gold, Silver, and Jewels they had. They thought at fir<U+017F>t with their tears to have pacifi'd him <U+017F>o far as to bring the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ome compo<U+017F>ition. <hi>Helenilla</hi> was very prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of them for her part, ca<U+017F>ting withall her arms about his Neck; but the unmerciful <hi>Hector</hi> grew <U+017F>o in<U+017F>olent upon their <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ions, that he would not hear of any thing by way of treaty, and once more gave them the peremptory word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, allowing them but half a quarter of an hour to re<U+017F>olve whether they would deliver or no. There was no way but to <U+017F>acrifice their Pur<U+017F>es to the <U+017F>afety of their Per<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>o that with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret they parted with what was dearer to them than their very entrails. Yet was not <hi>Montufar</hi>'s revenge <U+017F>atisfi'd with that. He pull'd out of his Pocket a parcel of Whip-cord which he had bought on purpo<U+017F>e for <U+017F>uch an execution, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ty'd them to <U+017F>everal Trees one again<U+017F>t the other, he told them, with a treacherous <U+017F>mile, that, out of a certain knowledge he had of their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in doing Penance from time to time for their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60944:64"/>
<U+017F>ins, he would, for the good of their <U+017F>ouls, give them a little di<U+017F>cipline with his own hands, that they might remember him in their Prayers. The Sentence pronounc'd was immediately put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, with branches of green Broom that grew thereabouts in abundance, he having <U+017F>o much mercy in his ju<U+017F>tice as not to do it with the Whip-cord, whereof he had had him<U+017F>elf experience both of the weight and <U+017F>mart, notwith<U+017F>tanding the grave reproaches of <hi>Mendez</hi> not long before to that purpo<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>Having di<U+017F>ciplin'd them till he grew weary, at the co<U+017F>t of their poor skins, he <U+017F>ate him down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Patients, and turning him<U+017F>elf to <hi>Helenilla,</hi> entertain'd her <U+017F>omewhat to this effect.

               <p>Leaving them <U+017F>o quieted of them<U+017F>elves, <hi>Don Sancho</hi> took his way back again towards the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Tree, unto which he had left the Idol of his heart in a manner metamorphos'd; but his a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment not to find there what he <U+017F>ought for, was greater than it had been upon the <U+017F>ight of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He rode about it <U+017F>everal times to <U+017F>ee if with earne<U+017F>t looking he might find what was not there; and not <U+017F>atisfi'd with that, look'd all about him, yet could di<U+017F>cover nothing but a <U+017F>ad Wilderne<U+017F>s<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> he rode up and down to all the places thereabouts, and returns again to the Tree, which, dull Plant as it was, never <U+017F>tirr'd for all the trouble he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf to.</p>

                  <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> as I told you, had <U+017F>uch a devotion for the female <U+017F>ex, that he could love any Woman at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight: but to compa<U+017F>s his de<U+017F>ires, if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would not do, he would <U+017F>pare no court<U+017F>hip, no addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, no <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ions, no <U+017F>ervices, no importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do it. This you'l <U+017F>ay was the onely way to make a man a Poet, if he were capable of it. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> indeed could do pretty well at it, and was very happy in the humouring of any accident good or bad: and whereas the odne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

They bethought them<U+017F>elves, that Di<U+017F>cord had ruin'd the greate<U+017F>t Empires, and were convinc'd, that, in all appearance, they were born one for another. They play'd not any trick of their Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion in their journey to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>; for having their thoughts <U+017F>ufficiently taken up with their removal out of a Country where enquiry might be made after them, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to run them<U+017F>elves into new inconveniences, which might hinder their going to <hi>Sevil,</hi> where they had great de<U+017F>igns to carry on.</p>

The imagination he had, that haply I had put a trick upon him, put him into <U+017F>uch a fury, that he was fully re<U+017F>olv'd to be eaven with me, in ca<U+017F>e what he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected <U+017F>hould prove true, and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e the greate<U+017F>t revenge he could think of, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gallant he <U+017F>hould find po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of the place he had promis'd him<U+017F>elf.

However he would needs come to that <U+017F>ide of the bed which I lay on, and give me a ki<U+017F>s, which I dur<U+017F>t not deny him for fear of awaking my Husband.

I return'd my husband's Dagger, all bloudy as it was, into the <U+017F>heath; I put on my cloaths with as much ha<U+017F>te and as little noi<U+017F>e as I could: I took along with me what Jewels and Mony I had: and, no le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>tracted by my love than troubled at what I had done, I left a husband who lov'd me beyond his own life, to ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf upon the courte<U+017F>ie of a young man, who not long before had <U+017F>ent me word that he had not the lea<U+017F>t re<U+017F>pect for me.

The <U+017F>udden departure of his wife, and her taking away her Jewels and mony, put him into <U+017F>uch an amazement, as out of which he could not recover him<U+017F>elf, and troubled him more than his impri<U+017F>onment and the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Ju<U+017F>tice again<U+017F>t him. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> was in much impatience to give <hi>Eugenia</hi> an account of the<U+017F>e things: but it <U+017F>o happened he could not do it <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as he wi<U+017F>h'd.

               <p>But what added not a little to her affliction, was, that Proclamation had been made that day all over <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> prohibiting all per<U+017F>ons to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain <hi>Eugenia,</hi> and that whoever brought tidings of her <U+017F>hould have two hundred Crowns.

She pa<U+017F>s'd away that night in <hi>Don Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>'s Chamber with as little tranquillity as the precedent.

Having left her, he went and took up a Coach, and order'd it to wait for him at a place not much frequented near his Lodging, whither he conducted <hi>Eugenia,</hi> accompanied by his Landla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The Coach brought them to a place they had appointed the Coach-man to <U+017F>top at, where they alighted, that he might have no knowledge of the Convent, whither <hi>Eugenia</hi> was to retire. She was kindly entertain'd by the Kin<U+017F>woman; <hi>Don Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi>'s Landlady took leave of her, and went to inform her <U+017F>elf what po<U+017F>ture the affairs of <hi>Don Sancho</hi> were in. She under<U+017F>tood it went hard with him, and that there was <U+017F>ome talk of putting him to the Rack. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> gave an account of all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages to <hi>Eugenia,</hi> who was <U+017F>o troubled to <U+017F>ee her Husband in danger to <U+017F>uffer for a crime he had not committed, that <U+017F>he took a re<U+017F>olution to ca<U+017F>t

her <U+017F>elf into the hands of Ju<U+017F>tice. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> per<U+017F>uaded her to forbear a while, and advis'd her rather to write to the Judge, to acquaint him that <U+017F>he onely could give an account of the murther of <hi>Don Lewis.</hi> The Judge, by good fortune chanc'd to be of <U+017F>ome Kin to her, came to <U+017F>peak with her, together with others that were to be his A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tants in the trial of <hi>Don Sancho. Eugenia</hi> confe<U+017F>s'd that <U+017F>he had kill'd <hi>Don Lewis:</hi> gave them a particular relation of the ju<U+017F>t motive <U+017F>he had to engage her <U+017F>elf in an action that <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>o violent in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, omitting nothing of what had pa<U+017F>s'd between <hi>Don Lewis</hi> and her <U+017F>elf; what concern'd the love of <hi>Andrado,</hi> onely excepted. Her confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion was written down, and a report thereof was made to his Catholick Maje<U+017F>ty; who, taking into con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the greatne<U+017F>s of <hi>Don Lewis</hi>'s crime, the ju<U+017F>t re<U+017F>entment of <hi>Eugenia,</hi> her courage and procedure thereupon, the innocence of <hi>Don Sancho</hi> and his Servants, <U+017F>et them at liberty; and, upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of the whole Court mediating on her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, granted <hi>Eugenia</hi> her pardon. Her Husband was not di<U+017F>pleas'd at her for the death of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and, it may be, lov'd her the better for what <U+017F>he had done. He went to <U+017F>ee her as <U+017F>oon as he got out of Pri<U+017F>on, and us'd all the entreaties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ua<U+017F>ions he could to get her home again; but all prov'd ineffectual. She doubted not but that he had conceiv'd <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>entment for the death of <hi>Don Lewis</hi> as he ought to have done; that he had made <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>coveries of what had pa<U+017F>t between her and the Portugueze; and thence concluded,

that the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition a Woman gives in point of honour may <U+017F>oon be heightened into a jealou<U+017F>ie in the apprehen<U+017F>ions of a Husband, and will <U+017F>oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or later di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the <U+017F>tricte<U+017F>t ties of conjugal Love.</p>
               <p>While things <U+017F>tood thus, poor <hi>Don Sancho</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ited her often: and, by the tendere<U+017F>t demon<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive Love, endeavour'd to get her out of the Convent, to be once more the ab<U+017F>olute Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of his e<U+017F>tate and him<U+017F>elf.

               <p>But all <U+017F>he did in the Convent to plea<U+017F>e and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour him, heightned the regret he conceiv'd that he could not get her thence.

the Life he was upon the point to quit: Nor did this goodne<U+017F>s of <hi>Eugenia</hi> go unrewarded; he left her his whole E<U+017F>tate, and con<U+017F>equently, one of the mo<U+017F>t beautiful and riche<U+017F>t Widdows in <hi>Spain,</hi> after her <U+017F>o near being one of the mo<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Women in the World.

               <p>But if her thoughts were in this di<U+017F>traction for <hi>Don Garcias,</hi> his were in no le<U+017F>s, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd her.

greedy of them: but de<U+017F>cending out of one of the be<U+017F>t Hou<U+017F>es in <hi>Spain,</hi> and being of near Kin to one of the principal Mini<U+017F>ters of State, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made him <U+017F>o much the more in<U+017F>olent, there was a certain compliance had for him where ever he came, upon the account of his quality, though it had not the lea<U+017F>t recommendation of any thing of worth.</p>
               <p>This <U+017F>ame <hi>Don Diego,</hi> <U+017F>uch as I have de<U+017F>cribed him, thought he had found in <hi>Eugenia,</hi> all he could have wi<U+017F>hed in a Wife, and imagin'd it no hard matter to obtain her, by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances of his Friends at Court, who<U+017F>e encouragements put him into great hopes of it.

                  <q>Know then, <hi>Sophia,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to me, that I am of the <U+017F>ame Sex as your <U+017F>elf, and, as well as you, I have al<U+017F>o been in love with <hi>Don Carlos</hi>; but if we have <U+017F>uffer'd by the <U+017F>ame flame, it hath not been with the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> hath ever lov'd you, and hath ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that you lov'd him; whereas, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he never lov'd me, nor could ever ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that I <U+017F>hould love him, as having not known me to be what I truly was. I am of <hi>Valentia,</hi> as you are, and my quality and fortunes are <U+017F>uch, that if <hi>Don Carlos</hi> had married me, he needed not to have fear'd the reproaches made to tho<U+017F>e who under-ally them<U+017F>elves. But the affection he had for you wholly took him up, and it <U+017F>eems he had eyes onely for you. Not but that mine did what they could, to <U+017F>ave my mouth the labour of making a <U+017F>hameful di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of my weakne<U+017F>s. I went to all places where I thought to meet him; I plac'd my <U+017F>elf where he might <U+017F>ee me, and I did all things for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60944:112"/>
him, which he <U+017F>hould have done for me, had he lov'd me, as I lov'd him. I had the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of my <U+017F>elf and e<U+017F>tate, as having been left an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan while I was yet very young; and there were often propos'd to me matches equal to my condition, but the hope I <U+017F>till cheri<U+017F>h'd, that I might at length engage <hi>Don Carlos</hi> to love me, hindred me from complying with any. In<U+017F>tead of being di<U+017F>courag'd by the unhappy fate of my love, as any other would, who, as I, had <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient perfections not to be <U+017F>lighted, I was the rather excited to the Love of <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> by the difficulty I found to in<U+017F>inuate my <U+017F>elf into his affections. In fine, to avoid the <U+017F>elf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that I <U+017F>hould neglect any thing which might promote my de<U+017F>ign, I caus'd my hair to be cut, and having di<U+017F>guis'd my <U+017F>elf in Man's cloaths, I got my <U+017F>elf pre<U+017F>ented to <hi>Don Carlos</hi> by an old menial Servant of my own, who went under the name of my Father, a poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Mountains of <hi>Toledo.</hi> My coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Meen your Lover lik'd <U+017F>o well, that he was <U+017F>oon induc'd to take me into his <U+017F>ervice. He knew me not again, though he had <U+017F>een me <U+017F>o many times, and he was as <U+017F>oon <U+017F>atisfy'd with my ingenuity as taken with my voice, and my skil in <U+017F>inging, and playing on all tho<U+017F>e in<U+017F>truments, on which per<U+017F>ons of Quality may, without di<U+017F>paragement, divert them<U+017F>elves. He <U+017F>oon found in me tho<U+017F>e endowments which are not commonly <U+017F>een in Pages, and I gave him <U+017F>o many demon<U+017F>trations of my fidelity and di<U+017F>cretion, that he treated me rather as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, than a Dome<U+017F>tick <U+017F>ervant. You know
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60944:112"/>
be<U+017F>t of any, whether I am to be credited in what I <U+017F>ay. You have a hundred times commended me to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> even in my pre<U+017F>ence, and done many good offices, but what vex'd me to the heart, was, that I receiv'd them from a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and while they made me more acceptable to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> they render'd you the more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the unhappy <hi>Claudia,</hi> (for <U+017F>o I am called.) In the mean time, the treaty of your marriage went forward, my hopes backward; that was concluded, the<U+017F>e were lo<U+017F>t. The <hi>Italian</hi> Count, who, about that time, fell in love with you, and who<U+017F>e Titles and E<U+017F>tate as much dazled your Father's eyes, as his warp'd countenance and his imperfections gave you occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>light him, procur'd me at lea<U+017F>t the plea<U+017F>ure, to <U+017F>ee you a little travers'd in your loves, and my <U+017F>oul began to flatter it <U+017F>elf with tho<U+017F>e fond hopes, which the unfortunate are over-apt to derive from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F><U+017F>itude. In fine, your Father preferr'd the Stranger, whom you fanci'd not, before <hi>Don Carlos</hi> whom you did. So I <U+017F>aw her, who caus'd my unhappine<U+017F>s, in her turn, unhappy her <U+017F>elf, and a Rival whom I hated, more unfortunate than my <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince I lo<U+017F>t nothing in a man, who had never been mine, whereas you lo<U+017F>t <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> who was wholly yours, and yet that lo<U+017F>s, how great <U+017F>oever it might be, was haply to you a le<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>er misfortune, than to have, for your perpetual Tyrant, a man, whom you could not love.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But my pro<U+017F>perity, or, to <U+017F>ay better, my hope, prov'd not long-liv'd. I under<U+017F>tood from <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> that you were re<U+017F>olv'd to follow him, and I was employ'd to <U+017F>et things in order to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60944:113"/>
the de<U+017F>ign he had to carry you to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and thence to cro<U+017F>s over into <U+017F>ome part of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> All the force I had had till then to endure my cro<U+017F>s fortune, left me upon this <U+017F>o <U+017F>harp an a<U+017F><U+017F>ault, it being a re<U+017F>olution I was the more <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with, the le<U+017F>s I had apprehended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One day, as I was bemoaning my <U+017F>ad de<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, and that my pre<U+017F>umption of not being overheard by any made me break forth into as loud expo<U+017F>tulations, as if I had <U+017F>poken to <U+017F>ome Confident, who knew the <U+017F>ecret of my loves, I perceiv'd <U+017F>tanding before me the Moor, <hi>Amet,</hi> who had heard me. Having recover'd the trouble his unexpected pre<U+017F>ence had put me into, head-dre<U+017F>s'd him<U+017F>elf to me in the<U+017F>e words.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I know thee very well, <hi>Claudia,</hi> and that even before thou had<U+017F>t di<U+017F>guis'd thy <U+017F>ex, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Page to <hi>Don Carlos</hi>; and that I never di<U+017F>cover'd this my knowledge of thee, proceeded hence, that I had a de<U+017F>ign as well as thou had<U+017F>t. I have heard what de<U+017F>perate re<U+017F>olutions thou art ready to take; thou wilt di<U+017F>cover thy <U+017F>elf to thy Ma<U+017F>ter to be young Maid deeply in love with him, and yet hope<U+017F>t not any from him, and then thou wilt kill thy <U+017F>elf in his pre<U+017F>ence, <U+017F>o to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve the regrets of him, who<U+017F>e love thou could<U+017F>t not gain.

Deprive thy Rival of her Servant; it may ea<U+017F>ily be done, if thou credit me, and though
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60944:113"/>
it requires much re<U+017F>olution, yet no more than thou ha<U+017F>t already expre<U+017F>s'd, in putting on man's habit, and hazarding thy honour, to <U+017F>atisfie thy love. Hear me then attentively, <hi>continu'd the Moor,</hi> I will acquaint thee with a <U+017F>ecret, which I never di<U+017F>cover'd to any, and if thou like<U+017F>t not what I <U+017F>hall propo<U+017F>e to thee, it will be at thy own choice, whether thou follow it or not. I am of <hi>Fez,</hi> a per<U+017F>on of quality in my Country; my misfortune made me <U+017F>lave to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> and <hi>Sophia</hi>'s beauty, hers. I have told thee much in few words. Thou think'<U+017F>t thy mi<U+017F>ery remedile<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e thy Lover carries away his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and is bound for <hi>Barcelona.</hi> 'Tis both thy happine<U+017F>s and mine, if thou can<U+017F>t make thy advantage of the opportunity. I have treated about my ran<U+017F>ome, and paid it. A Galeot of <hi>Africk</hi> waits for me in the road, not far from the place where <hi>Don Carlos</hi> hath one ready for the execution of his de<U+017F>ign. He hath put it off for one day; let us prevent him with as much diligence as <U+017F>ubtilty. Go and tell <hi>Sophia</hi> from thy Ma<U+017F>ter, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould make ready to come away this night, at the time thou <U+017F>halt come for her; conduct her to my Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el; I will carry her into <hi>Africk,</hi> and thou <U+017F>halt continue alone at <hi>Valentia,</hi> to enjoy thy Lover, who haply would have lov'd thee as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Sophia,</hi> had he but known that thou had<U+017F>t lov'd him.</q>

di<U+017F>pos'd into a clo<U+017F>e Chariot, and conducted to <hi>Fez,</hi> where, if <hi>Amet</hi> were receiv'd by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with much joy, I came in, the mo<U+017F>t afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perate per<U+017F>on in the world. For <hi>Claudia,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>oon provided for her <U+017F>elf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Chri<U+017F>tianity, and marrying <hi>Zaides,</hi> brother to the treacherous <hi>Amet.</hi> The wicked woman us'd all the artifices imaginable to induce me to change my Religion, and to marry <hi>Amet,</hi> as <U+017F>he had done <hi>Zaides,</hi> and <U+017F>o <U+017F>he became the mo<U+017F>t cruel of my Tyrants, even while, after they had in vain tri'd to draw me in by kindne<U+017F>s, fair promi<U+017F>es, and treatments, <hi>Amet</hi> and all his people exercis'd on me all the barbari<U+017F>m they could. My con<U+017F>tancy was <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently exercis'd again<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many enemies, and I was more able to endure my troubles than I could have wi<U+017F>h'd my <U+017F>elf, when I began to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that <hi>Claudia</hi> repented her, that <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>o wicked. Before others <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd to per<U+017F>ecute me with greater animo<U+017F>ity than any, but privately <U+017F>he did me <U+017F>ome good offices, which made me look on her as a per<U+017F>on who might have been virtuous, had her education been accordingly.</q>

The lea<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>tings were enough to make me undertake things beyond my <U+017F>ex.

I was at a little lo<U+017F>s to give her <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient thanks, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her of the great re<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I had of the favour which I conceiv'd <U+017F>he would do me. We appointed a day for our e<U+017F>cape, towards a place on the Sea-<U+017F>ide, where
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60944:115"/>
<U+017F>he told me that our Bark lay, under certain Rocks. The day, which I thought would prove <U+017F>o happy, came; we very happily got out of the hou<U+017F>e and City. I admir'd the goodne<U+017F>s of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s we found in compa<U+017F><U+017F>ing our de<U+017F>ign, and I ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly ble<U+017F>s'd God for it. But the end of my misfortunes was not <U+017F>o near as I thought it. <hi>Claudia</hi> did all this by order from the perfidious <hi>Amet</hi>; nay, exceeding him in perfidiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, the end of her bringing me to <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>olitary place, and that in the night time, was onely to leave me to the violence of the Moor, who dur<U+017F>t not have attempted ought again<U+017F>t my cha<U+017F>tity in his Father's hou<U+017F>e, who, though a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> was yet a morally hone<U+017F>t man. I innocently follow'd her, who led me to de<U+017F>truction, and I thought I <U+017F>hould never be <U+017F>ufficiently thankful to her, for the liberty I was in hope ere long to obtain by her means. I could not be weary of giving her thanks, not yet of going a good pace, in rough ways encompa<U+017F>s'd with rocks, where <U+017F>he told me that her people expected her, when hearing a certain noi<U+017F>e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, and turning my head, I perceiv'd <hi>Amet</hi> with his Cymitar drawn. You infamous Slaves, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> is it thus you run away from your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter? I had not the lei<U+017F>ure to an<U+017F>wer him. <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> held my hands fa<U+017F>t behind, and <hi>Amet</hi> letting fall his Cymitar, came up to the Renegado, and both of them together did what they could to bind my hands with cords, which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for that purpo<U+017F>e. Having a greater <U+017F>trength and activity than women commonly have, I a good while re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted the attempts of tho<U+017F>e two

wicked per<U+017F>ons: but at length I grew weak, and my onely recour<U+017F>e was to my cries, which might draw <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>enger into that <U+017F>olitary place, where I rather hoped not for any relief, when Prince <hi>Mulei</hi> came in to my re<U+017F>cue. You have heard how he <U+017F>av'd my honour, nay I may <U+017F>ay my life, <U+017F>ince I had a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly died of grief, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>table <hi>Amet</hi> had had his de<U+017F>ires on me.</q>

               <p>Thus did <hi>Sophia</hi> conclude the relation of her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and the amiable <hi>Zoraida</hi> encourag'd her to expect from the genero<U+017F>ity of the Prince, that <U+017F>ome cour<U+017F>e would be taken for her return into <hi>Spain</hi>; whereupon <U+017F>he acquainted her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with all <U+017F>he had heard from <hi>Sophia,</hi> whereof he afterwards gave Prince <hi>Mulei</hi> an account. Though all that had been related to him of the fortunes of the fair Chri<U+017F>tian, flatter'd not the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he had for her, yet was he glad, being a per<U+017F>on nobly inclin'd to vertue, to receive <U+017F>ome knowledge thereof, and find that her affection was engag'd in her own Country, that <U+017F>o he might not attempt a cen<U+017F>urable action out of a vain hope of finding it ea<U+017F>ily compa<U+017F>s'd. He had an e<U+017F>teem for the vertue of <hi>Sophia,</hi> and was inclin'd, by his own, to endeavour a remi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of her misfortune. He <U+017F>ent her word by <hi>Zoraida,</hi> that he would give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for her return into <hi>Spain,</hi> when <U+017F>he pleas'd, and, having once taken that re<U+017F>olution, he forbore to vi<U+017F>it her, out of a di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t of his own vertue, and the beauty of that amiable per<U+017F>on. She was not a little troubled to find out a <U+017F>ecure way for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. 'Twas <U+017F>omewhat a tedious voiage into <hi>Spain,</hi> who<U+017F>e Merchants traded not to <hi>Fez,</hi> and though <U+017F>he might have met with a Chri<U+017F>tian ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, yet

being fair and young, as <U+017F>he was, <U+017F>he might find, among tho<U+017F>e of her own Religion, what <U+017F>he had been afraid to meet with among the Moors. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>ty is not often found aboard a Ship; <U+017F>incerity is as little ob<U+017F>erv'd there as in War, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beauty and innocence are at the weake<U+017F>t, the in<U+017F>olence of the wicked will not fail to take its advantage to thru<U+017F>t them to the wall. <hi>Zaraida</hi> advis'd <hi>Sophia</hi> to put on Man's cloaths, <U+017F>ince her advantageous Stature, beyond that of other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men much further'd her di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e.

               <p>Prince <hi>Mulei</hi> had bought of a Pyrat a Prize which he had taken at Sea; 'twas a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Governour of <hi>Oran,</hi> which had aboard her the whole family of a Spani<U+017F>h Gentleman, whom the Governour, upon <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ent over a Pri<U+017F>oner into <hi>Spain.

In the <U+017F>pace of two years that he liv'd at <hi>Fez,</hi> in the Prince's <U+017F>ervice, he taught him how he might take any thing

with a Gun, whether it were on the Earth, or in the Air, and <U+017F>hew'd him <U+017F>everal other Games un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Moors. By the<U+017F>e ways, he had <U+017F>o in<U+017F>inuated him<U+017F>elf into the Prince's favour, and was become <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in his diverti<U+017F>ements, that he would not hear of any Ran<U+017F>ome for him, but endeavour'd by all the obligations he could lay on him, to make him forget his own Country. But the regret he conceiv'd, that he <U+017F>hould not once more <U+017F>ee it, put him into a melancholy, which <U+017F>oon after ended in his Death, to which it was not long ere his Wife follow'd him. <hi>Mulei</hi> felt a certain remor<U+017F>e, that he had not <U+017F>et him at Liberty, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his relations, <U+017F>ince they had by their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices de<U+017F>erv'd it, and <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olv'd to repair, towards their Children, the injury he thought he had done the Parents. The Daughter was named <hi>Dorotea,</hi> much about the <U+017F>ame Age with <hi>Sophia,</hi> hand<U+017F>ome and witty. Her Brother was not above fifteen years of Age, and his name <hi>Sancho.

Men's cloaths, according to the <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> mode were made for the two Gentlewomen, and little <hi>Sancho.

of Quality, who had been ca<U+017F>t away on the Coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Morocco.</hi> To this Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adour did <hi>Mulei</hi> recommend <hi>Sophia,</hi> under the name of <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> a Gentleman of quality, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ir'd not to be known by his own name; and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotea</hi> and her Brother were to be his retinue, one as a Gentleman waiting on him, the other as Page. <hi>Sophia</hi> and <hi>Zoraida</hi> could not part without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and many tears were <U+017F>hed on both <U+017F>ides. <hi>Zoraida</hi> be<U+017F>tow'd on the fair Chri<U+017F>tian a Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Pearl, <U+017F>o rich, that <U+017F>he would not have receiv'd it, if the obliging Moor, and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Zulema,</hi> who had as great a kindne<U+017F>s for <hi>Sophia</hi> as his Wife, had not a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd her, that <U+017F>he could not di<U+017F>oblige them in any thing <U+017F>o much, as the refu<U+017F>al of that pledge of their friend<U+017F>hip. <hi>Zoraida</hi> made <hi>Sophia</hi> promi<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould hear from her, by the way of <hi>Tangiers, Oran,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other places which the Emperour was po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of in <hi>Africk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chri<U+017F>tian Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adour took Shipping at <hi>Salley,</hi> having along with him <hi>Sophia,</hi> whom we mu<U+017F>t henceforth call <hi>Don Fernand.</hi> He came to the Emperour's Army, while it was yet before <hi>Tunis.</hi> Our di<U+017F>guis'd Spani<U+017F>h Lady was pre<U+017F>ented to him as a Gentleman of <hi>Andalu<U+017F>ia,</hi> who had <U+017F>ome time been a Slave to the Prince of <hi>Fez.</hi> She had no great rea<U+017F>on to be <U+017F>o fond of her Life, as to be afraid of engaging in the War, and being now to act the part of a Cavalier, <U+017F>he could not, in honour, avoid the performance of duty, as other gallant Per<U+017F>ons did, whereof the Emperour's army was full. She thereupon li<U+017F>ted her <U+017F>elf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Volunteers, mi<U+017F>s'd no de<U+017F>ign that was

undertaken, and <U+017F>ignaliz'd her <U+017F>elf upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions, <U+017F>o as the Emperour came to hear much of the counterfeit <hi>Don Fernand.</hi> Nay, <U+017F>uch was her good Fortune, that <U+017F>he happen'd to be near him, when, in the heat of an engagement, wherein the di<U+017F>advantage was on the Chri<U+017F>tian <U+017F>ide, he fell into an ambu<U+017F>cado of Moors, was for<U+017F>aken by his party, and encompa<U+017F>s'd by the Infidels, and in all probability he had been kill'd there, his Hor<U+017F>e having already receiv'd that fate under him, if our Amazon had not mounted him on hers, and, <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding his Valour with unexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible efforts, given the Chri<U+017F>tians time to <U+017F>ee their error, and to come into the relief of the Valiant Emperour. So <U+017F>ignal an action was not unrecompen<U+017F>ed; the Emperour be<U+017F>tow'd on the unknown <hi>Don Fernand</hi> a Commandery of Saint <hi>James,</hi> of a va<U+017F>t Revenue, and the Regiment of Hor<U+017F>e of a certain Spani<U+017F>h Lord, who had been kill'd in the la<U+017F>t engagement. He al<U+017F>o be<U+017F>tow'd on him the equipage of a per<U+017F>on of Quality, and from thenceforward, there was not a Per<U+017F>on in the whole Army more highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teem'd or more con<U+017F>iderable than this Valiant <hi>Virago.</hi> All the actions of Man were <U+017F>o natural to her; her Countenance was <U+017F>o fair, and made her <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o young; her Valour was <U+017F>o admirable, con<U+017F>idering her youth; and her Prudence and Conduct <U+017F>o remarkable, that there was not any Per<U+017F>on of quality or command in the Army, but courted her Friend<U+017F>hip. It is not therefore much to be admir'd, if, all pleading for her, but e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially her noble and heroick Actions, <U+017F>he came in a <U+017F>hort time to be her Ma<U+017F>ter's greate<U+017F>t Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:60944:118"/>About this time, there came over <U+017F>ome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits from <hi>Spain,</hi> in tho<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els which brought over Money and Ammunition for the Army. The Emperour would needs <U+017F>ee them him<U+017F>elf in their Arms, accompany'd by the chiefe<U+017F>t Commanders, among whom was our Amazon. Looking very earne<U+017F>tly on the<U+017F>e Recruits, <U+017F>he imagin'd that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> nor was <U+017F>he mi<U+017F>taken. She could not be at re<U+017F>t all that day; <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent to find him out among the new Levies, but he could not be found, in regard he had chang'd his name. She <U+017F>lept not all night, got up with the Sun, to find out, her <U+017F>elf, that dear Lover which had co<U+017F>t her <U+017F>o many tears. She found him, and was not known by him, <U+017F>he being grown <U+017F>omewhat Taller, and the <U+017F>ultry heat of <hi>Africk</hi> having a little chang'd the Complexion of her Countenance. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take him for another of her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ask'd him what news from <hi>Sevil,</hi> and how <U+017F>uch a per<U+017F>on did, naming the fir<U+017F>t came into her mind. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> told her <U+017F>he had mi<U+017F>taken him, that he had never been at <hi>Sevil,</hi> and that he was of <hi>Valentia.</hi>
                  <q>You are extremely like a per<U+017F>on I lov'd very well, <hi><U+017F>ays Sophia, I would <U+017F>ay Don Fernand,</hi> and for that re<U+017F>emblance I will be your friend, if you find in your <U+017F>elf no aver<U+017F>ion to become mine. The <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, <hi>replies Don Carlos,</hi> which obliges you to proffer me your friend<U+017F>hip, had already en<U+017F>ur'd mine to you, if it be worth your acceptance. You are <U+017F>omewhat like a per<U+017F>on I have a long time been in love with; you have her Countenance and Voice, but you are not of the <U+017F>ame Sex, and certainly, added he, with a deep <U+017F>igh, you are
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60944:119"/>
not of her Humour.</q>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> could not forbear blu<U+017F>hing at tho<U+017F>e words of <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> which he took no notice of, haply by rea<U+017F>on his eyes, which began to be moi<U+017F>tened with tears, could not well perceive the alterations of <hi>Sophia</hi>'s countenance. She was troubled, and not able at the pre<U+017F>ent to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble it, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ir'd <hi>Don Carlos</hi> to come to her Tent, where <U+017F>he would expect him, and <U+017F>o left him, after he had de<U+017F>crib'd his Quarter, and told him that he was known in the Army by the name of <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> one of the</p>
               <p>At the hearing of that, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was afraid he had not render'd him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect due to his Quality. He had already heard what e<U+017F>teem he was in with the Emperour, and that he was as much in favour with him as any about the Court. He <U+017F>oon found out his Quarter and Tent, which any one could direct him to, and he was as well receiv'd by him, as a <U+017F>imple Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier could expect to be, by one of the chiefe<U+017F>t Field-Officers. He again imagin'd he di<U+017F>cover'd <hi>Sophia</hi>'s countenance, in that of <hi>Don Fernand</hi>; was more a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at it, than he had been before, and that much more at the <U+017F>ound of his Voice, which entred into his very Soul, and there renew'd the remembrance of that per<U+017F>on, for whom, of all the world, he had had the greate<U+017F>t affection.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Sophia,</hi> undi<U+017F>cover'd by her Lover, entertains him at dinner, which done, <U+017F>he commands all the Servants to with-draw, and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given order that none <U+017F>hould vi<U+017F>it her, was told a <U+017F>econd time, by that Gentleman, that he was of <hi>Valentia,</hi> and afterwards very patiently heard him relate what <U+017F>he knew as well as him<U+017F>elf
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60944:119"/>
of their common adventures, to the day that he intended to have carried her away.
<q>Could you imagine, Sir, <hi><U+017F>aid Don Carlos to her,</hi> that a Gentlewoman of <U+017F>uch Quality, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <U+017F>o many a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of my Love, and had given me as many of hers, <U+017F>hould be wanting in point of fidelity and honour; <U+017F>hould have the <U+017F>ubtilty to <U+017F>mother <U+017F>uch great failings, and be <U+017F>o blinded in her choice, as to prefer, before me, a young Page I had, who carried her away from me, the day before I <U+017F>hould have done it. But are you fully convinc'd it is <U+017F>o, <hi><U+017F>ays Sophia to him.</hi> All things are in the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of Chance, which <U+017F>ometimes is in an humour to confound our ratiocinations, by <U+017F>uch effects, as we lea<U+017F>t expect. 'Tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s may have been forc'd to that <U+017F>eparation from you, and, it may be, is rather unfortunate, than chargeable with any mi<U+017F>carriage. O that it were the plea<U+017F>ure of the Gods, <hi>replies Don Carlos,</hi> I could make the lea<U+017F>t que<U+017F>tion of it, I <U+017F>hould comfortably endure all the lo<U+017F><U+017F>es and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes it hath caus'd me; nay, I <U+017F>hould not think my <U+017F>elf unfortunate, could I but imagine that <U+017F>he were <U+017F>till faithful to me; but <U+017F>he is onely <U+017F>uch to the perfidious <hi>Claudio,</hi> and never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended love to the wretched <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> but to ruine him. Me-thinks, it may be inferr'd from what you <U+017F>ay, <hi>replies Sophia,</hi> that you never had any great affection for her, when your charge again<U+017F>t her is without your hearing what <U+017F>he may have to alledge for her <U+017F>elf, and you repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent her, not onely as an uncon<U+017F>tant, but al<U+017F>o as a wicked per<U+017F>on. And could any one have been

more wicked than <U+017F>he hath prov'd, <hi>cries Don Carlos,</hi> when, to elude the <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of having been carried away by the Page, <U+017F>he left in her Chamber, the very night <U+017F>he vani<U+017F>h'd from her Father's, a Letter, writ with the greate<U+017F>t malice imaginable, which hath reduc'd me to more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible mi<U+017F>eries, than that it <U+017F>hould ever get out of my memory.

                  <q>You may ea<U+017F>ily imagine, <hi>continu'd Don Carlos,</hi> the extreme grief which <hi>Sophia</hi>'s Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at the reading of this Letter. They were in hopes I might be <U+017F>till with their Daughter, either in <hi>Valentia,</hi> or not far from it. They di<U+017F>cover'd not their lo<U+017F>s to any but the Vice-roy, who was their kin<U+017F>man, and it was hardly light the next morning, when <U+017F>ome Officers coming into my room found me a<U+017F>leep. I was, as well I might, very much <U+017F>tartled at <U+017F>uch a vi<U+017F>it, and when, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ask'd me where <hi>Sophia</hi> was, I al<U+017F>o made the <U+017F>ame que<U+017F>tion to them, my adver<U+017F>aries were incens'd, and violently dragg'd me to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on. I was examin'd, and could make no plea for my <U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t <hi>Sophia</hi>'s Letter. It was clear, that I had a de<U+017F>ign to have carried her away; but it appear'd withal, that my Page had vani<U+017F>h'd at the <U+017F>ame time with her. <hi>Sophia</hi>'s Parents <U+017F>ent people to find her out, and my friends, on the other <U+017F>ide, made diligent <U+017F>earch where the Page might di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her. This was the onely means to clear me; but we never could hear any thing of the<U+017F>e fugitive Lovers, whereupon my enemies charg'd me with the death of them both. At la<U+017F>t, inju<U+017F>tice, back'd with power, carri'd it again<U+017F>t oppre<U+017F>s'd innocence. Notice was given me that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>oon receive my <U+017F>entence, and that it would be that of death. I hoped not that

I join'd my <U+017F>elf to certain Bandits, who were pri<U+017F>oners as well as my <U+017F>elf, and all per<U+017F>ons of re<U+017F>olution. We forc'd the Pri<U+017F>on-doors, and, a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by our friends, got into the Mountains about <hi>Valentia,</hi> ere the Vice-roy had any notice of our e<U+017F>cape. We continu'd a long time Ma<U+017F>ters of the Field. <hi>Sophia</hi>'s incon<U+017F>tancy, the pro<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of her friends, the inju<U+017F>tice I thought done me by the Vice-roy, and, in fine, the lo<U+017F>s of my e<U+017F>tate, put me into <U+017F>uch de<U+017F>pair, that I hazarded my life in all the engagements wherein my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merades and my <U+017F>elf met with any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and by that means I got into <U+017F>uch reputation with them, that they made me their Chief. I behav'd my <U+017F>elf in that charge <U+017F>o <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully, that our Party became dreadful to the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> and we grew <U+017F>o in<U+017F>olent, as to impo<U+017F>e a Contribution on tho<U+017F>e Countries. I here make a dangerous di<U+017F>covery to you, but the honour you do me, and my own inclination do <U+017F>o far en<U+017F>lave me to you, that I am willing to put my life into your hands, by acquainting you with the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecrets of it. At la<U+017F>t, I grew weary of that leud cour<U+017F>e of life; I got away from my Camerades, when they lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected I <U+017F>hould, and took my way to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> where I was entertain'd onely as a private Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, in the Recruits ready to be tran<U+017F>ported into <hi>Africk,</hi> which have <U+017F>ince joyn'd with the Army.

               <p>The war in <hi>Africk</hi> came to the period men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Hi<U+017F>tory thereof.

But hold a little, I am mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>taken, he went not into his chamber till all his cloaths were on; for from the time that <hi>Sophia</hi> had di<U+017F>guis'd her <U+017F>ex, onely <hi>Dorotea,</hi> the confident of her di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, lay in her chamber, and did all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervices, which done by another might have di<U+017F>cover'd what <U+017F>he would have kept conceal'd. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> therefore entred into the Vice-Roy's chamber, as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Dorotea</hi> had open'd it for all vi<U+017F>itants; and the Vice-Roy no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw him, but he reproach'd him with his early ri<U+017F>ing, being a per<U+017F>on accus'd, who would have him<U+017F>elf thought innocent, and told him, that a per<U+017F>on who could not <U+017F>leep betrai'd <U+017F>omething that lay heavy on his con<U+017F>cience. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> a little troubled, made him an<U+017F>wer, that it was not <U+017F>o much the fear of being found guilty, as the hope of defying the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pro<U+017F>ecutions of his enemies, by the ju<U+017F>tice he expected from his Highne<U+017F>s, that had hindred him from <U+017F>leeping.

For his own part, he <U+017F>wore very liberally, that he had not carried away <hi>Sophia,</hi> and repre<U+017F>ented it to the Judges, that it was the mo<U+017F>t improbable thing in the world, that he <U+017F>hould carry her away, <U+017F>oon after to be <U+017F>eparated from her: but a further charge again<U+017F>t him was, that he had murther'd her, and al<U+017F>o the Page, the confident of his Loves.

if you plea<U+017F>e, <hi>replies Don Sancho.</hi> You never <U+017F>aw me, <hi><U+017F>ays Dorothea</hi>; it mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>ome one that you have <U+017F>een, therefore name <U+017F>ome other.

There are in <hi>Sevil</hi> many Ladies as hand<U+017F>ome as <U+017F>he is, nay many exceed her, <hi><U+017F>ays Dorothea,</hi> both in beauty and wit; but <U+017F>ince you are pleas'd to pitch upon her, pray tell me <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, did you never hear it reported, that <U+017F>he favour'd any one of her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants particularly above all the re<U+017F>t? Finding my <U+017F>elf at a great di<U+017F>tance from de<U+017F>erving her, <hi><U+017F>ays Don Sancho,</hi> I never made it my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And why do you think you might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve her as well as another, <hi><U+017F>ays Dorothea?</hi> I took you to be a per<U+017F>on of greater courage than to betray <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t of your <U+017F>elf. Had you <U+017F>tudi'd Ladies as much as I imagin'd you might have done, you would have found them mighty humour<U+017F>ome and fanta<U+017F>tick, and that many times the fir<U+017F>t on<U+017F>et of a new comer makes a greater progre<U+017F>s in their affections, than <U+017F>everal years of <U+017F>ervices rendred by tho<U+017F>e Gallants, who are never out of their <U+017F>ight. From the character you give tho<U+017F>e Ladies, Madam, <hi><U+017F>ays Don Sancho,</hi> I may infer you would be loath to be included in the number, and <U+017F>o you take an ingenious way to rid your hands of me, by encouraging me to love <U+017F>ome other Lady, and I clearly <U+017F>ee, you would have but little regard for the <U+017F>ervices of a

Take heed how you entertain any <U+017F>uch thing in your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, <hi>replies Dorothea,</hi> but rather per<U+017F>uade your <U+017F>elf, that I am not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily induc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a witty complement for an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of a growing inclination towards me, from a per<U+017F>on who never <U+017F>aw me.

               <p>Upon this ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the two other Ladies came up to them, and they fell into it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre<U+017F>h, and continu'd the kind engagement, <U+017F>o long, that <hi>Marina</hi> thought it time to mind them of their departure. <hi>Dorothea</hi> was troubled at that alarm, and <hi>Don Sancho</hi> grew pale and <U+017F>ilent; but there was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of parting.

They had many interviews after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at the <U+017F>ame place, and they <U+017F>pent the time, as they had done at the fir<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o by a continu'd progre<U+017F>s, their Loves came up to that fervency, that, abating their not <U+017F>hedding their blood as <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe</hi> are recorded to have done, they were not behind them<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> as to a violent tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s one for another.

               <p>This <U+017F>ame young Gentleman (now his name comes into my head, <hi>Don Diego</hi>) before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd him<U+017F>elf in an action which might be charg'd with imprudence, thought it requi<U+017F>ite to be fully a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of a thing, which yet he did onely <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect. He had a very <U+017F>pruce fellow that waited on him in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60944:134"/>
his Chamber, one of tho<U+017F>e in<U+017F>olent attendants who think it is for their Ma<U+017F>ter's credit that they wear as good Linnen as them<U+017F>elves, or at lea<U+017F>t wear theirs; and all, that they may be the more gracious in the eyes of the waiting women. This Servant's name was <hi>Guzman</hi>; he pretended much to ingenuity, out of a conceit that it had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to him from that Country-man of his, who<U+017F>e adventures are <U+017F>o famous; but having, among other endowments, a <U+017F>mattering in Poetry, he employ'd his Talent in compo<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch Romances as in other Countries are known by the name of Ballads. He <U+017F>ung them playing on his Gitthar, but <U+017F>o wretchedly, that his wry mouths and the <U+017F>tretching out of his tongue, <U+017F>poil'd the di<U+017F>cord, at lea<U+017F>t to tho<U+017F>e that look'd on him. He had al<U+017F>o the graceful knack of dancing a Saraband, and never went without his Ca<U+017F>tagnets. He had once <U+017F>ome intentions to turn Comedian, but <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in his humour was not lik'd, for he was very much addicted to Vapouring and Hector<U+017F>hip, and to give you a true character of him, there was <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of his nocturnal atchievements, as being one who would bid people <U+017F>tand with as much confidence as a Con<U+017F>table, but with this greater civility, that he would di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s their per<U+017F>ons, and <U+017F>ecure onely what he found about them.</p>
               <p>All the<U+017F>e excellent Talents, heighten'd by a little eloquence, which reach'd onely <U+017F>o far as he had read, and what he heard from his Ma<U+017F>ter, made all the Waiting-women, even tho<U+017F>e who pretended to <U+017F>omewhat of Beauty, look on him as the blank (if I may make that compari<U+017F>on) of their amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous de<U+017F>ires. <hi>Don Diego</hi> gave him in<U+017F>tructions to

go and court <hi>I<U+017F>abella,</hi> a young Maid who waited on the two beautiful Si<U+017F>ters.

In fine, <hi>Guzman</hi> thought it his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to make <U+017F>ure of her, by propo<U+017F>ing a match; <U+017F>he was as willing as he was, and took him at his word; they made one another mutual promi<U+017F>es of marriage, and ever after liv'd together as if the ceremonies had pa<U+017F>s'd between them.</p>
               <p>Things <U+017F>tanding thus, <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an extream indignation again<U+017F>t <hi>Marina,</hi> the Surgeon's wife, at who<U+017F>e hou<U+017F>e <hi>Don Sancho</hi> and <hi>Dorothea</hi> had their private meetings, and it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her much, that though <U+017F>he had liv'd with her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s before her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till be her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of that nature, wherein the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of a favour'd Lover is very con<U+017F>iderable.

This rais'd a deadly hatred in her again<U+017F>t <hi>Marina,</hi> which makes me think, that the

pretty Gentlewoman was not a little troubled. It is not therefore to be wondred, if, upon the fir<U+017F>t Interrogatories which <hi>Guzman</hi> made to her, and particularly this, whether it were true that <hi>Dorothea</hi> was in love with any one, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <U+017F>ecrets of her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, to a per<U+017F>on, whom <U+017F>he look'd on as part of her <U+017F>elf. She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with all <U+017F>he knew of the de<U+017F>igns of our young Lovers, <hi>Don Sancho</hi>'s liberality to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> whom he enrich'd by his continual pre<U+017F>ents, till at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he broke forth into down-right railing at her, as one that made tho<U+017F>e advantages, which <U+017F>hould rather have been receiv'd by a Servant that liv'd in the hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Guzman</hi> intreated her to give him notice of the next meeting they were to have there. She did <U+017F>o, and he fail'd not to give his Ma<U+017F>ter an account of it, as al<U+017F>o of all had been told him by the perfidious <hi>I<U+017F>abella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this intelligence <hi>Don Diego</hi> put him<U+017F>elf into the habit of a Beggar, and laid him<U+017F>elf down in the <U+017F>treet not far from <hi>Marina</hi>'s door, into which he <U+017F>aw his Rival enter, and not long after came a Coach, out of which alighted <hi>Dorothea</hi> and her Si<U+017F>ter, and went into the <U+017F>ame Hou<U+017F>e, leaving <hi>Don Diego</hi> in a great rage, to <U+017F>ee what he could not then remedy. He went home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd to rid him<U+017F>elf of <U+017F>o formidable a Rival.

He defended him<U+017F>elf at fir<U+017F>t as a Lion, and found that his enemies had this advantage of him, that they defi'd any thing he could do with his Sword. <hi>Don Diego</hi> pre<U+017F>s'd upon him more than the others, who, being hir'd men, behav'd them<U+017F>elves accordingly. He retreated <U+017F>till all he could, to remove the noi<U+017F>e of the engagement farther from the hou<U+017F>e where his <hi>Dorothea</hi> was: but at la<U+017F>t fearing to endanger him<U+017F>elf too far, and finding <hi>Don Diego</hi> <U+017F>till vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently pur<U+017F>uing him, he di<U+017F>charg'd one of his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tols, upon which he fell down half dead, and call'd as loud as he could for a Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or, and the two Hectors immediately vani<U+017F>h'd. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> got to his own lodging, and the neighbours came out into the <U+017F>treet and found <hi>Don Diego,</hi> whom they knew, ready to depart this life, and charging <hi>Don Sancho</hi> with his death. He had <U+017F>oon notice of it by his friends, who told him, that though he might clear him<U+017F>elf upon the judicial proceedings which might be brought again<U+017F>t him, yet <hi>Don Diego</hi>'s friends would be <U+017F>ure to revenge his death, and find out <U+017F>ome way or other to kill him. He retir'd into a Mona<U+017F>tery, whence he gave his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s an account how his affairs <U+017F>tood, and <U+017F>et all things in order to his departure from <hi>Sevil,</hi> as <U+017F>oon as he might do it <U+017F>afely.

the Mona<U+017F>tery, where <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was, and there, by the means of one of the Religious men, the two Lovers had an enterview in a private Chapel.

The old Gentleman was <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> who had been at a Neighbour's hou<U+017F>e at play, as he was wont to do every day, and was then going to his own, by the Garden-door, which was not far from the place where he met <hi>Don Sancho.</hi> He call'd out to the amorous Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,

'Tis very true, <hi>replies Don Sancho,</hi> I am <U+017F>omewhat at a lo<U+017F>s how to avoid the pur<U+017F>uit of the Magi<U+017F>trate, who it may be is now making a <U+017F>earch for me; but <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o generous as to proffer me, though a Stranger to you, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception upon <U+017F>o dangerous a <U+017F>core as this, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of your kindne<U+017F>s, and entru<U+017F>t you with my <U+017F>afety, with this promi<U+017F>e, never to forget the favour you do me, and to pre<U+017F>s it no farther, than till <U+017F>uch time as tho<U+017F>e who look after me are pa<U+017F>s'd by.</q>

               <p>With the<U+017F>e words <hi>Don Sancho</hi> would have quitted the room: but <hi>Dorothea</hi> <U+017F>tays him, and was going to vindicate her <U+017F>elf, when <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> comes running in to tell her, that her Ma<U+017F>ter, <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> was coming after her. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> had onely time enough to get behind the door, and, while the Old man was chiding his Daughters that they had not been a-bed, and had his back towards the Chamber-door, made a <U+017F>hift to get out, and going back the <U+017F>ame way into the Garden, went into the <U+017F>ame Arbour where he had been before, and were preparing him<U+017F>elf for what ever might happen, he expected a favourable opportunity to make his e<U+017F>cape thence.</p>
               <p>There are, no doubt, tho<U+017F>e, who think Love the

plea<U+017F>ante<U+017F>t thing in the world. But far is it from their imagination, that a Lover's con<U+017F>tant court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hips and adorations may at la<U+017F>t be requited with contempt, <U+017F>corns, frowns, and elu<U+017F>ions, which require an extraordinary mea<U+017F>ure of patience and good nature to endure them. Little do they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that a young Spark, after many years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, even when he thinks him<U+017F>elf as it were within a barrs length of felicity, may, by <U+017F>ome unexpected ob<U+017F>tructions and di<U+017F>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be tumbled into eternal di<U+017F>grace, and all this occa<U+017F>ion'd, not <U+017F>o much by any backwardne<U+017F>s of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, as his own unhappy mi<U+017F>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ions.</p>
               <p>The<U+017F>e were the reflections of the unfortunate <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> while <hi>Don Manuel</hi> was gone into his Daughter's chamber to fetch a Light, to bring in the Officers who were imperiou<U+017F>ly knocking at the Garden-door, upon the information they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that <hi>Don Manuel</hi> had entertain'd into his Hou<U+017F>e one of tho<U+017F>e who had been fighting in the <U+017F>treet. <hi>Don Manuel</hi> made no difficulty to let them in, to <U+017F>earch his Hou<U+017F>e, out of an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance they would be <U+017F>o civil as not to look into his own Chamber, and that the Gentleman whom they expected to find, was <U+017F>afely lock'd in there. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> perceiving out of the Arbour, that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to e<U+017F>cape the <U+017F>earch of <U+017F>o many Officers as were <U+017F>catter'd up and down the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, comes out to <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> and whi<U+017F>pers him in the ear, that a per<U+017F>on of Honour would be more tender of his promi<U+017F>e then to abandon one whom he had taken into his protection. <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> who was much <U+017F>urpris'd to find him there, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60944:146"/>
the chief Officer, to leave <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> in his cu<U+017F>tody, till the next morning; which reque<U+017F>t was <U+017F>oon granted him, as well out of a re<U+017F>pect to his quality, as for that the party, whom <hi>Don Sancho</hi> imagin'd he had kill'd, was not very dangerou<U+017F>ly wounded.</p>
               <p>The Officers, having receiv'd <U+017F>omewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a morning's draught, took their leave, and departed; and <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> having di<U+017F>cover'd by the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which had pa<U+017F>s'd between him and <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> when he fir<U+017F>t met him, that he mu<U+017F>t needs be the per<U+017F>on whom he had receiv'd into his Garden, doubted not, but that the other was <U+017F>ome Gallant, brought into the Hou<U+017F>e, either by <hi>I<U+017F>abella,</hi> or his Daughters. To be more fully <U+017F>atisfy'd of it, he conducted <hi>Don Sancho de Sylva</hi> into a room by him<U+017F>elf, and de<U+017F>ir'd him to <U+017F>tay there till he return'd again. He went to that place where he had left <hi>Don Juhan de Peralto,</hi> to whom he told a feign'd <U+017F>tory, that his man was come into the Hou<U+017F>e along with the Officers, and waited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to <U+017F>peak with him. <hi>Don Juhan</hi> knew that his man lay very <U+017F>ick at that time, and not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to come to him, though he had known where he was, which he did not. He was therefore <U+017F>omewhat troubled at what <hi>Don Manuel</hi> had <U+017F>aid to him, and <U+017F>o he had no other an<U+017F>wer to make him, than that his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e and <U+017F>ome others <hi>Don Manuel</hi> found him to be that young Gentleman lately come from the <hi>Indies,</hi> who was <U+017F>o much talk'd of about <hi>Sevil,</hi> and, being <U+017F>ufficiently inform'd as to his quality and e<U+017F>tate, re<U+017F>olv'd, he <U+017F>hould not go

out of the Hou<U+017F>e ere he had married that Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his, to whom he had ever <U+017F>o little addre<U+017F>s'd him<U+017F>elf. He <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome further time in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him, to be more fully <U+017F>atisfy'd as to <U+017F>ome doubts, which then burthen'd his mind. <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> <U+017F>tood all the while at the door, and over-heard them, and gave an account of all to her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es. <hi>Don Manuel</hi> had a glimp<U+017F>e of her, and imagin'd <U+017F>he was come with <U+017F>ome me<U+017F><U+017F>age to <hi>Don Juhan,</hi> from one of his Daughters. He left him, to run after her, ju<U+017F>t as the Wax-light, which was in the room, being at an end, went out of it <U+017F>elf. While the Old man is groping to find out <hi>I<U+017F>abella,</hi> <U+017F>he acquaints <hi>Dorothea</hi> and <hi>Feliciana,</hi> that <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was in their Father's chamber, and that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een them talking together. The two Si<U+017F>ters ran thither upon her word, <hi>Dorothea</hi> being not afraid to find her dear <hi>Don Sancho</hi> with her Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd, as <U+017F>he was, to acknowledge, that <U+017F>he lov'd him, and that <U+017F>he had been lov'd by him, and withall to tell him, upon what motives <U+017F>he had appointed <hi>Don Juhan</hi> to come thither that night. She therefore goes into the room, which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any light, and having met with <hi>Don Juhan,</hi> ju<U+017F>t as he was coming out, <U+017F>he took him for <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and having him fa<U+017F>t by the arm, <U+017F>he thus expo<U+017F>tulated with him.
<q>Why do<U+017F>t thou avoid me, tygre-hearted <hi>Don Sancho</hi>! and why would<U+017F>t thou not what an<U+017F>wer I <U+017F>hould make to the unde<U+017F>erv'd reproaches thou ha<U+017F>t made me!

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60944:149"/>
But what comes more particular to the character we have to give of him, is, that, at certain Showes, wherewith the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples</hi> entertain'd the populace, upon acca<U+017F>ion of the Nuptial <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of <hi>Philip,</hi> the <U+017F>econd, third, or fourth, of <hi>Spain,</hi> (I cannot now well call to mind) he did things beyond their belief, who onely receiv'd them by relation. The next day after a famous Tilting, at which he had behav'd him<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>uch gallantry, as rais'd no le<U+017F>s a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment in the beholders, than indignation and <U+017F>hame in tho<U+017F>e who ventur'd at a trial of their addre<U+017F>s in the <U+017F>ame exerci<U+017F>e, the Ladies obtain'd a permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Vice-Roy, to go about the City di<U+017F>guis'd, and mask'd after the <hi>French</hi> mode, for the convenience of <U+017F>uch Strangers as tho<U+017F>e magnificencies had brought thither from all parts of the Kingdom. That day, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> put on the riche<U+017F>t cloaths he had, and went, among many others, who, as <U+017F>o many Cockatrices, intended to murther all the Ladies they look'd on, to a Church, where mo<U+017F>t of the Gallantry were to meet. Where be it ob<U+017F>erv'd by the way, that <hi>Chri<U+017F>tian</hi> Churches may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan'd, as well in tho<U+017F>e Countries which profe<U+017F>s mo<U+017F>t obedience to the holy See, as in others, and in <U+017F>tead of being us'd as the Temples of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Rendezvous for tho<U+017F>e who have not the opportunities <U+017F>o well to meet el<U+017F>e-where. The onely remedy I can at pre<U+017F>ent think of to prevent this <U+017F>candal, is, that there be a new Officer cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in every Pari<U+017F>h, who<U+017F>e charge it <U+017F>hall be, to mark what per<U+017F>ons come to tho<U+017F>e Sacred places upon Love-appointments, and if they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the place by fair means, to drive them thence
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60944:150"/>
with as little regard, as they would do tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>narl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creatures, which many times <U+017F>tick not to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel there, to the great di<U+017F>traction of people's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
               <p>But <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ie-body will haply be <U+017F>o imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent as to ask, why I <U+017F>hould trouble my head with the<U+017F>e abu<U+017F>es, as if I were <U+017F>ome Ma<U+017F>ter of a Pari<U+017F>h, or Lay-Elder, that had a Maid who <U+017F>hould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e his dog at home? I would have the fool that is <U+017F>candaliz'd at it, know, that in this lower part of the world, all men are fools, as well as liars, <U+017F>ome more, <U+017F>ome le<U+017F>s, and perhaps I who now <U+017F>peak a greater fool than any, though it might abate <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of my folly, that I am <U+017F>o free to acknowledge it, and withal that this Book of mine, and all others of this kind, being but <U+017F>o many collections of fooleries, I hope, every fool in his quality and degree, will <U+017F>ome-where or other light upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle de<U+017F>cription of him<U+017F>elf, if he be not too much be<U+017F>otted with <U+017F>elf-conceit.</p>
               <p>But let the Reader take it as he will. Let me go on with my <U+017F>tory. <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> as I told you, was gotten into a Church, with divers other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were <U+017F>trutting up and down in their feathers, like <U+017F>o many Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, and making reverences to more per<U+017F>ons than they were known to, (a vanity practis'd <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Churches as well as <hi>Hide-Parks</hi>) when three Ladies, all clo<U+017F>e mask'd, <U+017F>ingl'd him out from among the re<U+017F>t, and having led him a little a<U+017F>ide, one of them addre<U+017F>s'd her <U+017F>elf to him either in the<U+017F>e words, or others to the <U+017F>ame effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Signor <hi>Don Carlos, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him,</hi> I have a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to impart to you, whereof perhaps you
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60944:150"/>
little thought either before or at your devotions, which is, that there is in this City a Lady to whom you are extremely oblig'd. She was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent at the Tilting, and all tho<U+017F>e other exerci<U+017F>es, wherein you have lately been engag'd, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wi<U+017F>h'd you might come off with honour, as you have done. She is not <U+017F>o vain to think your <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s wholly the effect of her wi<U+017F>hes, but leaves it to your <U+017F>elf to con<U+017F>ider, what degree of kindne<U+017F>s you will allow her good wi<U+017F>hes, and what a Ladie's concerning her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o particularly in your good fortune may <U+017F>ignifie; if it were expre<U+017F>s'd in other tearms.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The young Gallant was a little <U+017F>urpriz'd at the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F>s of the adventure; but having recover'd him<U+017F>elf, he made this Reply.
<q>The greate<U+017F>t ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage I can make to my <U+017F>elf of what you tell me, Madam, is, that I receive it from you, who <U+017F>eem to be a Lady of quality, and I am to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that could I have imagin'd any Lady had had <U+017F>uch tender wi<U+017F>hes for me, I <U+017F>hould have endeavour'd to do more than I have done to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve her approbation. And therefore, I am to account the obligation <U+017F>he hath put on me the greater, in that it proceeds from a per<U+017F>on, to whom I have not the honour to be known.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The di<U+017F>guis'd Lady told him, that he had not omitted any thing which might render him, even in the judgment of per<U+017F>ons le<U+017F>s prejudic'd by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s than that Lady, one of the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>h'd men in the world. But another thing <U+017F>he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken particular notice of, was, that it might be pre<U+017F>um'd, by his Liveries of black and white, his affection was not any where engag'd.
<q>I never

under<U+017F>tood, Madam, <hi>replies Don Carlos,</hi> what colours <U+017F>ignifi'd in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e; but this I know, that it is not <U+017F>o much out of any in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility, or indifference I have towards your fairer <U+017F>ex, that I have not made my addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to any one of it, as an apprehen<U+017F>ion of my own want of merit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There pa<U+017F>s'd abundance of other ingenuous complements between them, for their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e continu'd a long time; but I <U+017F>hall forbear the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of them, not onely becau<U+017F>e they never came to my knowledge, and that I am loath to make others out of a fear it might be to the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and the unknown Lady, who were infinitely more witty than I am, as I have been <U+017F>ince inform'd by an hone<U+017F>t Gentleman of <hi>Naples,</hi> who was intimately acquainted with them both. The re<U+017F>ult was this, that the mask'd Lady declar'd her <U+017F>elf thus far to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> that <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf was the per<U+017F>on who had that inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him. He de<U+017F>ir'd to <U+017F>ee her; She de<U+017F>ir'd him to excu<U+017F>e her for the pre<U+017F>ent, telling him <U+017F>he would endeavour to <U+017F>atisfie him <U+017F>ome other time, and to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him that <U+017F>he was not afraid to give him a meeting, at which there <U+017F>hould be none but them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>he would give him a pledge. With that <U+017F>he di<U+017F>cover'd to the gentile <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the faire<U+017F>t hand he had ever <U+017F>een, and pre<U+017F>ented him with a Ring, which he made no difficulty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but with <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>tracted reflections on the odne<U+017F>s of the accident, that he had almo<U+017F>t for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to make her a congey, when <U+017F>he took leave of him.</p>
               <p>The other Gentlemen, who had, at a di<U+017F>tance, ob<U+017F>erv'd what had pa<U+017F>s'd between <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60944:151"/>
the Lady, though not over-heard their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>eeing they were parted, came up to him, very de<U+017F>irous to know what might occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>o long a conver<U+017F>e in <U+017F>o publick a place. He freely told them what had happen'd, and <U+017F>hew'd them the Ring, wherein was a Diamond of very great price. Whereupon every one pa<U+017F>s'd his judgment on the adventure, and the re<U+017F>ult of the whole debate was, that <hi>Don Carlos</hi> found him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>eiz'd by as violent a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for the unknown Lady, as if he had <U+017F>een her face, <U+017F>uch an inevitable influence hath Wit over tho<U+017F>e that have any. Eight tedious days, and tho<U+017F>e attended by ten times more tedious nights, pa<U+017F>s'd away ere he heard any further account of the Lady; which that he was extremely troubled at, I <U+017F>hould ea<U+017F>ily have believ'd, though I had never been told <U+017F>o much.</p>
               <p>During that time, his diverti<U+017F>ement was to go every day to an acquaintance of his, a Captain of Foot, at who<U+017F>e hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons of quality met to <U+017F>pend <U+017F>ome few hours and pieces at play. One night, that <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was not in an humour to venture any thing, but was going home much <U+017F>ooner than he was wont, he was call'd by his name, from a ground-room belonging to a hou<U+017F>e, which <U+017F>eem'd to be <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons of great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. He comes up clo<U+017F>e to the window, which had a grate before it, and pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ound by her voice, that <U+017F>he was his invi<U+017F>ible Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>aid to him;
<q>Come as near as you can to the window, <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> I have been here a good while expecting you, that we may decide a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between us. I have <U+017F>ome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ion of your impatience, and mu<U+017F>t permit

I need not tell you, that in appointed combats there <U+017F>hould be an equality of arms: if your heart <U+017F>hould not be as free and dis-engag'd as mine, the advantage would be of your <U+017F>ide; and thence it came, that I was de<U+017F>irous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd concerning you. And what account have you receiv'd of me, <hi><U+017F>ays Don Carlos?</hi> The world, Madam, is full of flattery and calumny, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you to examine well the credit of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information.

I have as much as I am <U+017F>atisfi'd with, <hi>replies the di<U+017F>guis'd Lady,</hi> and it is onely this, that we are free enough to become one another's. No, Madam, <hi><U+017F>ays Don Carlos,</hi> there is a great inequality in the ca<U+017F>e; for you <U+017F>ee me, and know who I am, nay you acknowledge your <U+017F>elf, that you have particularly enquir'd of me,

He knew there were many Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es and Ladies of great quality then at <hi>Naples</hi>; but he knew withal, that there were many <U+017F>ubtil Curtezans, eagerly bent to trapan Strangers, greet cajollers of <U+017F>uch as were ignorant of their impo<U+017F>tures, and <U+017F>o much the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, by how much they were the more beautiful.</p>
               <p>Having recover'd his a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, he went ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olately to his lodging, but re<U+017F>olv'd to pro<U+017F>ecute the de<U+017F>ign wherein he was engag'd, with all the caution he could, out of a fear it might prove a cheat put upon him. I <U+017F>hall not tell you
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60944:153"/>
exactly whether he <U+017F>upp'd, or not, nor yet whether, in ca<U+017F>e he went to bed <U+017F>upperle<U+017F>s, he <U+017F>lept, or not, and yet there might be much probability of the latter. The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderable circum<U+017F>tances of a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s life, I <U+017F>eldom trouble my <U+017F>elf or my Reader with, though it be very much practis'd by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of much greater Romances, than the world is ever like to have from me. For tho<U+017F>e Gentlemen give <U+017F>uch a punctual account of all their <hi>Hero</hi>'s do, and regulate their employments according to the <U+017F>everal parts of the day, appointing them to do <U+017F>uch a thing fir<U+017F>t, and then <U+017F>ome other, as if they were <U+017F>hut up in <U+017F>ome place of <U+017F>piritual Retreat. For example, they mu<U+017F>t ri<U+017F>e betimes in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having met with <U+017F>ome-body, though they had never <U+017F>een the party before, entertain him or her, with the Hi<U+017F>tory of their adventures, till they be call'd in to dinner: dine very lightly, and, as <U+017F>oon as they have din'd, retire into <U+017F>ome arbour, to proceed in the continuation of it, or <U+017F>pend the afternoon in reading <U+017F>ome Romance; when-ever they drink, take as many go-downs as there are letters in their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s's names, in commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; and if the clock <U+017F>trikes, make <U+017F>o many ejaculations for the good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of their Loves. If the weather be inviting to go abroad, they are led into <U+017F>ome Grove, where they are to acquaint the Trees and Stones with their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, till their <U+017F>upper-time calls them home, at which having, in<U+017F>tead of eating, <U+017F>pent the time in <U+017F>ighes and reveries, go and build Ca<U+017F>tles in the air upon <U+017F>ome Turret, that looks towards the Sea, while <U+017F>ome Squire or Servant di<U+017F>covers that his Ma<U+017F>ter is <U+017F>uch a one, the Son of <U+017F>uch a King, and

that there is not a better natur'd Prince in the world; and though he be then one of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome<U+017F>t men in the world, that he was quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther per<U+017F>on, before Love had disfigur'd him. And thus they make tho<U+017F>e whom they would repre<U+017F>ent for exemplars of all the great and heroick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, in many things no better than <U+017F>o many <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Shepherds</hi> and <hi>Don Quixots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to my Story. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> came the night following to the <U+017F>ame po<U+017F>t, where he found his invi<U+017F>ible Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s ready to entertain him. She ask'd him whether he had not been much troubled at the former conver<U+017F>e they had together, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were not true, that he had entertain'd <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t of what <U+017F>he had told him. <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> without an<U+017F>wering her que<U+017F>tion, entreated her to <U+017F>atisfie him, what danger or inconvenience there might be, in di<U+017F>covering her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince things were upon eaven terms on both <U+017F>ides, and that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to them<U+017F>elves no other ends in their gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, than <U+017F>uch as might be approv'd by all.
<q>In that lies the whole danger of it, <hi><U+017F>ays the invi<U+017F>ible Lady,</hi> as you <U+017F>hall find in time; be you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd, that I am real, and, in the relation I gave you of my <U+017F>elf, I have been <U+017F>o mode<U+017F>t, that, without injury to truth, I might have told you much more.</q> Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e la<U+017F>ted a long time. They made <U+017F>ome advance in the mutual love they had rais'd in one another, and at la<U+017F>t parted, after a reciprocal promi<U+017F>e to meet there every night, at the time they had agreed on.</p>
               <p>The next day, there was to be an extraordinary Ball at the Vice-Roy's Palace. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was in hopes to make a di<U+017F>covery there of the per<U+017F>on, who
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60944:154"/>
would be invi<U+017F>ible to him in all other places. In the mean time he made enquiry, who<U+017F>e hou<U+017F>e that was, where he had receiv'd <U+017F>uch favourable audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. He was told by the neighbours, that there liv'd in it an antient Lady, the Relict of a certain <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Captain, that <U+017F>he liv'd very private, and had neither Daughters nor Nieces. He knock'd at the door, and de<U+017F>ir'd to <U+017F>ee the old Lady; an<U+017F>wer was brought him, that <U+017F>ince the death of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <U+017F>he admitted no vi<U+017F>its from any per<U+017F>on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever; which added not a little to the di<U+017F>turbance of his thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Carlos</hi> went at night to the Vice-Roy's, where you may imagine there was a noble A<U+017F><U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Gallants. He very exactly ob<U+017F>erv'd all the Ladies, to find out her whom he <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ir'd to know. He fell into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with tho<U+017F>e he met; but without any <U+017F>atisfaction. At la<U+017F>t he <U+017F>ingl'd out the Daughter of a certain Marque<U+017F>s, where his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lay I know not, nor care much, e<U+017F>pecially now we are come to an age wherein people are too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to a<U+017F><U+017F>ume Titles of Honour to them<U+017F>elves. The Lady was young and beautiful enough, and her voice came <U+017F>omewhat near hers whom he look'd for: but after much ob<U+017F>ervation, he found <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>tance between her intellectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pented him he had in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time made <U+017F>uch a progre<U+017F>s in his court<U+017F>hip to that Beauty, as whence he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ume that <U+017F>he had a more than ceremonious kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s for him. They danc'd together <U+017F>everal times, and the Ball being done, little to the <U+017F>atisfaction of <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> he took leave of his Captive, whom he left highly conceited of her <U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>he alone, in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60944:155"/>
<U+017F>o noble an A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, had receiv'd the gallantries of a Cavalier, who was no le<U+017F>s e<U+017F>teem'd by all the women, than envi'd by all the men.</p>
               <p>From the Vice-Roy's, he immediately went to his lodging, and thence, having taken <U+017F>uch arms as he thought requi<U+017F>ite, to the fatal Grate, which was not far from it. The Lady, who was already got to her po<U+017F>t, ask'd him what news he brought from the Ball, though <U+017F>he had been there her <U+017F>elf. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuou<U+017F>ly told her, that he had danc'd <U+017F>everal times with a very beautiful per<U+017F>on, and had entertain'd her with di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as long as the Ball la<U+017F>ted. This confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion gave her occa<U+017F>ion to put divers que<U+017F>tions to him, whereby he might ea<U+017F>ily have perceiv'd that <U+017F>he was jealous. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide di<U+017F>cover'd the trouble of his mind, that <U+017F>he had not been at the Ball, and that it gave him <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>e to mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t her quality. She <U+017F>oon ob<U+017F>erv'd what he would have been at, and to prevent the di<U+017F>turbance <U+017F>uch a doubt might rai<U+017F>e in him, <U+017F>he us'd all the wit and Rhetorick <U+017F>he had, and <U+017F>hew'd him all the kindne<U+017F>s could be expected between two per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>eparated by an iron-grate, which concluded with a promi<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he would be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible within a very <U+017F>hort time. They thereupon took leave one of the other, he very doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he <U+017F>hould believe her, and <U+017F>he a little jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the beautiful Lady, whom he had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd all the time of the Ball.</p>
               <p>The next day, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> going into a Church, to hear Ma<U+017F>s, and meeting ju<U+017F>t at the door with two Ladies mask'd, pre<U+017F>ented them with holy water, to <U+017F>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re them the trouble of taking it them<U+017F>elves. The better clad of the two told him, that in requital of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60944:155"/>
that civility <U+017F>he had <U+017F>omewhat to acquaint him with, wherein he might be highly concern'd.
<q>If you are not too much in ha<U+017F>te, Madam, <hi><U+017F>ays Don Carlos to her,</hi> you may immediately ea<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elf of what you have to tell me. Follow me then into the next Chapel, <hi>replies the unknown Lady.</hi>
                  </q> She went in fir<U+017F>t, and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her, much in doubt whether <U+017F>he were his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, (though he was <U+017F>atisfi'd <U+017F>he was about the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tature) in regard he found <U+017F>ome difference in their voices, this Lady <U+017F>peaking <U+017F>omewhat fa<U+017F>ter than the other.</p>
               <p>Having <U+017F>hut them<U+017F>elves into the Chapel, <U+017F>he made him this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.
<q>Signor <hi>Don Carlos, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,</hi> the whole City of <hi>Naples</hi> is full of wonder, at the great reputation you have acquir'd, <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>mall time of your re<U+017F>idence in it, and you are look'd upon, by all, as the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>h'd per<U+017F>on in the world, Onely this occa<U+017F>ions a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, that, being what you are, you <U+017F>hould not have ob<U+017F>erv'd, there are in this City <U+017F>everal Ladies of great quality and worth, who have a particular e<U+017F>teem and kindne<U+017F>s for you. They have expre<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>o much, as far as mode<U+017F>ty and the re<U+017F>erv'dne<U+017F>s of their <U+017F>ex would permit, and though they earne<U+017F>tly wi<U+017F>h you a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of it, yet would they rather it might be <U+017F>aid, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded it not out of a certain in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility, than di<U+017F><U+017F>embled your inadvertency, out of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. There is, among others, one, of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who, not regarding what may be <U+017F>aid of <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>covery, gives you this eminent a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of the e<U+017F>teem <U+017F>he hath for you, as to give you notice, That your mid-night adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60944:156"/>
are ob<U+017F>erv'd; that you indi<U+017F>creetly engage your affection to what you have no knowledge of, and <U+017F>ince the per<U+017F>on you court as a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s will not vouch<U+017F>afe you a <U+017F>ight of her, that it is either out of a fear <U+017F>he is not amiable enough to gain your love, or a<U+017F>ham'd of her own. I doubt not but the object of your contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive love is <U+017F>ome Lady of high quality, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cendent wit, and that you imagine to your <U+017F>elf a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s who is, <U+017F>uch, of all the excellencies her <U+017F>ex is capable of, and con<U+017F>equently de<U+017F>erv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the adoration of <U+017F>uch a per<U+017F>on as you are; But Signor <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> let me give you this advice, not to tru<U+017F>t your imagination, to the prejudice of your judgment, but rather mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t a per<U+017F>on, who di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es her <U+017F>elf, and avoid all further engagement in the<U+017F>e nocturnal conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ations. To deal freely with you, 'tis I who am jealous of this fanta<U+017F>m of yours, troubled you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak of her, and, <U+017F>ince I have expre<U+017F>s'd my <U+017F>elf thus far, am re<U+017F>olv'd to qua<U+017F>h her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns, and defeat all her projects, <U+017F>o as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her of a victory which I may ju<U+017F>tly di<U+017F>pute with her; <U+017F>ince I am not inferiour to her, either as to beauty, fortune, or quality, or indeed any thing that may render a woman amiable. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, I leave you to make your advantage of the good coun<U+017F>el I have given you, which, if you are wi<U+017F>e, I doubt not but you will.</q>
               </p>
               <p>With the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words <U+017F>he went out of the Chapel, not <U+017F>taying for the An<U+017F>wer, which <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was ready to make her. He would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her, but he found at the Church-door a per<U+017F>on of quality, who pre<U+017F>ently fell into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60944:156"/>
with her, and continu'd it <U+017F>o long, that he grew weary of <U+017F>taying to <U+017F>ee her dis-engag'd. All the remainder of the day, his thoughts were wholly taken up with this adventure, and he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, at fir<U+017F>t, that the Gentlewoman he had met with at the Ball, might be the la<U+017F>t mask'd Lady, that had appear'd to him: but con<U+017F>idering with him<U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd to be much more ingenuous, than the other had di<U+017F>cover'd her <U+017F>elf, he was at a lo<U+017F>s what to think of it, and began to wi<U+017F>h he had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o far to his ob<U+017F>cure Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, that he might have addre<U+017F>s'd his devotions to her whom he had la<U+017F>t parted with. But at la<U+017F>t, reflecting that <U+017F>he was no more known to him than his former invi<U+017F>ible Lady, who<U+017F>e wit had charm'd him in the conver<U+017F>ation he had had with her, he re<U+017F>olv'd what cour<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould take, and little regarded the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces which had been made him, as being a per<U+017F>on not to be frighten'd with great words.</p>
               <p>In pur<U+017F>uance of this re<U+017F>olution, he went that very night to his iron-grate at the hour appointed. The two Lovers <U+017F>pent their time, much after the <U+017F>ame rate as they had at their former meetings. But being come near the height of their amorous di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, it was unexpectedly interrupted by a <U+017F>trange accident. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was of a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by four men in vizards, who having di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd him, carri'd him away by main force into a Coach, which waited at the lower end of the <U+017F>treet. I leave the Reader to imagine how heartily he rail'd on them, and the reproaches he made them, that they had taken him <U+017F>o much at their advantage. Nay, he tri'd what fair words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>es might do; but in<U+017F>tead of prevailing ought
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60944:157"/>

               <p>In the mean time, the Coach went forward as fa<U+017F>t as four good Hor<U+017F>es could draw it, and about an hour after they had left the City, he was brought into a magnificent Palace, the great Gate whereof <U+017F>tood open, as if it had been purpo<U+017F>ely for his reception. The four di<U+017F>guis'd per<U+017F>ons receiv'd <hi>Don Carlos</hi> out of the Coach, holding him fa<U+017F>t under the arms, as if he had been <U+017F>ome Amba<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour conducted to the Grand Signor, or the King of <hi>Per<U+017F>ia.</hi> He was brought up the fir<U+017F>t Story with the <U+017F>ame ceremony, and there, two Gentlewomen mask'd receiv'd him, at the entrance of a <U+017F>pacious Hall, having each of them Torches in their hands. The di<U+017F>guis'd men took leave of him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, after they had made him a mo<U+017F>t low congey. 'Tis very probable, they left him neither Sword nor Pi<U+017F>tol, nor that he return'd them any thanks for the care they had of him, and their trouble to bring him thither. Not but that he was a per<U+017F>on of as much civility as any man in the world, but one <U+017F>urpris'd may well be pardon'd the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing it <U+017F>o much as another.</p>
               <p>I <U+017F>hall not tell you whether tho<U+017F>e great Wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights which the Gentlewoman held, were in Silver Candle<U+017F>ticks, but this I am <U+017F>ure of, that they were carv'd and embo<U+017F>s'd work, and the Hall was one of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>umptuous in the world, and, if you plea<U+017F>e, the furniture of it, without di<U+017F>paragement, comparable to <U+017F>ome Appartments of our late Romances, as for example <hi>Zelmana</hi>'s Ship in <hi>Polexander, Ibrahim</hi>'s Palace in the <hi>Illustrious

Imagine then how much our cajoll'd Lover was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd to find him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>o <U+017F>umptuous an appartment, attended onely by two Gentlewomen mask'd, who <U+017F>poke not at all, and conducted him thence into another room, more nobly furni<U+017F>h'd than the Hall, where they left him all alone. Had he been of the humour of <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> he would have been tran<U+017F>ported into <U+017F>ome extravagance befitting <U+017F>o great an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer, and he would have conceited him<U+017F>elf at lea<U+017F>t <hi>Esplandian</hi> or <hi>Amadis</hi>; but our grave <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> was no more troubled at it, than if he had been in <U+017F>ome Inn, or Country-hou<U+017F>e of his own. True it is, he was much troubled for his Invi<U+017F>ible Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and having his thoughts continually fixt on her, he thought that room <U+017F>adder than any Pri<U+017F>on, which is neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was confident they intended him no hurt who had Lodg'd him <U+017F>o nobly, and wanted not much of being <U+017F>atisfy'd, that the Lady, who had <U+017F>poken to him the day before in the Church, was the Sorcere<U+017F>s, who had wrought all the<U+017F>e enchantments.

All was very magnificent; Mu<U+017F>ick and Perfumes were not wanting, and our <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> be<U+017F>ides the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es of Smelling, and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <U+017F>atisfy'd al<U+017F>o that of the Ta<U+017F>te, much beyond what I <U+017F>hould have imagin'd, the condition he was in con<U+017F>ider'd; my meaning is, that he made a good Supper, for, as I told you, he could not live on the airy entertainments of <U+017F>ighs, and amorous imaginations. I forgot to tell you, that I think he wa<U+017F>h'd his mouth before he <U+017F>ate down, for I have heard, that he had an extraordinary care of his teeth. The Mu<U+017F>ick continu'd playing a good while after Supper, and all having left him, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> walk'd up and down the room a good while, ruminating on all the<U+017F>e enchantments, or <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what el<U+017F>e, it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At la<U+017F>t two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen mask'd, and a little Dwarf of a Page mask'd al<U+017F>o, after they had laid a rich cloath on a Side-table, came to help him off with his cloaths, without any previous que<U+017F>tion, whether he had any mind to go to Bed or not. He <U+017F>uffer'd them to do what they pleas'd; the Gentlewomen order'd his Bed, and march'd away; the Page help'd him off with his boots or <U+017F>hooes, and afterwards with his cloaths. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> got into Bed, and all this was done with as <U+017F>trict an ob<U+017F>ervation of <U+017F>ilence of all <U+017F>ides, as if he had been in <U+017F>ome Mona<U+017F>tery of <hi>Carthu<U+017F>ians.</hi> He re<U+017F>ted well enough for an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous per<U+017F>on; the Birds of an adjoyning aviary awak'd him at the break of Day; the mask'd Dwarf was ready to wait on him, and brought

him the fine<U+017F>t Linnen, the white<U+017F>t, and be<U+017F>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd that he had ever <U+017F>een.</p>
               <p>'Twere too hard a task to give an account how he pa<U+017F>s'd away the time from Morning till Noon, let tho<U+017F>e who feel the gripings of a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate love imagine it, as for other people, it matters not what they think. The <U+017F>ilence, which had hitherto been exactly ob<U+017F>erv'd of all <U+017F>ides, was broken at la<U+017F>t, by another mask'd Gentlewoman, who came to ask him, whether he would be pleas'd to <U+017F>ee the Prince<U+017F>s of that enchanted Palace. He told her, it was his de<U+017F>ire, and that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be very welcome. Not long after, <U+017F>he comes into the room, attended by four Gentlewomen very richly clad, and with that lu<U+017F>tre and attraction, as if the Graces had be<U+017F>tow'd the whole morning in dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her. Never had our <hi>Spaniard</hi> <U+017F>een a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Love and Maje<U+017F>ty in one countenance, than he now <U+017F>aw in that of this unmask'd <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda.</hi> He was <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>h'd and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that all the Congees he made, and the <U+017F>everal po<U+017F>tures he put him<U+017F>elf into, while he led her by the hand into an adjoyning room, were little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <U+017F>o many <U+017F>tumblings. What he had thought <U+017F>o <U+017F>umptuous in the Hall, and the other room, whereof I told you before, were nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari<U+017F>on of what he found in this, and yet as mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent as all things were, they receiv'd <U+017F>ome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of lu<U+017F>tre from the mask'd Lady, who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd the place with her divine pre<U+017F>ence.

               <p>With tho<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he took off her mask, and gave <hi>Don Carlos</hi> a full di<U+017F>covery of Heaven, or, if you plea<U+017F>e, a <U+017F>mall draught of it, the lovelie<U+017F>t Head in the world, <U+017F>u<U+017F>tein'd by a Body of the noble<U+017F>t-<U+017F>tature he had ever admir'd, in a word, both together making up a per<U+017F>on wholly divine. By the fre<U+017F>h complexion of her countenance, a Man would have gue<U+017F>s'd her not to exceed <U+017F>ixteen years of age; but a certain mixture, of maje<U+017F>ty and gallantry in the air of it, <U+017F>uch as young per<U+017F>ons

                  <hi>Don Carlos</hi> <U+017F>tood mute a while, as being unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd what an<U+017F>wer he <U+017F>hould make her, not a little incens'd again<U+017F>t his invi<U+017F>ible Lady, who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him from making an ab<U+017F>olute di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of him<U+017F>elf to the mo<U+017F>t beautiful per<U+017F>on he had ever <U+017F>een, and at a perfect lo<U+017F>s, both as to what he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, or what he <U+017F>hould do. At la<U+017F>t, after an interiour conflict, which la<U+017F>ted long enough to rai<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome doubts in the Lady of the enchanted Palace, he took a firm re<U+017F>olution, to make her a clear di<U+017F>covery of his <U+017F>oul, and it prov'd (<U+017F>uch is commonly the reward of <U+017F>incerity) one of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t advantageous actions he ever did. But you expect his an<U+017F>wer. Many per<U+017F>ons, who have heard of it, have been of opinion he might have done better, and declar'd his mind a little more <U+017F>martly, when he had once re<U+017F>olv'd which game he would be at. But I am onely his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and think my <U+017F>elf concern'd in point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cience, to lay down the very words he deliver'd, which were the<U+017F>e, as near as I can remember.
<q>I mu<U+017F>t acknowledge, Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> that it would have been too great a happine<U+017F>s to plea<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a per<U+017F>on as you are, could I have been but <U+017F>o happy as that I might have lov'd you.

con<U+017F>tancy that I <U+017F>hould addre<U+017F>s my affection to you?

               <p>As he was coming out of the Garden, he met with a young Gentlewoman, unmask'd (for upon the Ladie's di<U+017F>covery of her <U+017F>elf, orders were given there <U+017F>hould be no more masks <U+017F>een about the Palace) who ask'd him, whether he would be pleas'd to admit of her Ladie's company, to dine with him that day. I leave you to judge, whether he return'd, <hi>She <U+017F>hould be welcome,</hi> or <hi>With all his heart,</hi> or, <hi>That it was an honour he could not have a<U+017F>pir'd to.</hi> Soon after, dinner was brought in; the Prince<U+017F>s appear'd fairer than the Day, and her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ation took the amorous <hi>Spaniard</hi> <U+017F>o highly, that it bred in him a <U+017F>ecret trouble to <U+017F>ee, in a per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>o great quality, <U+017F>uch excellent endowments <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely mi<U+017F>emploi'd. He endeavour'd all he could to put him<U+017F>elf into a plea<U+017F>ant humour, though his thoughts were continually fix'd on his unknown Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, whom he was impatiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irous

               <p>As <U+017F>oon as they had taken away, and all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants had quitted the room, the Lady a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted his con<U+017F>tancy one more, in the<U+017F>e words.
<q>I know not, Signor <hi>Don Carlos, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,</hi> whether I may, from the chearfulne<U+017F>s, which me-thinks I have ob<U+017F>erv'd in your countenance, derive any hope of <U+017F>ome change in your mind, or pre<U+017F>ume that my face and carriage, have at lea<U+017F>t rais'd in you a doubtfulne<U+017F>s, whether the invi<U+017F>ible Beauty, you <U+017F>o much dote on, be more capable to force your love than I am.

<q>Madam, before I <U+017F>atisfie you, as to what you are <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to know, I am to beg a real di<U+017F>covery of your <U+017F>entiments concerning what I <U+017F>hall propo<U+017F>e to you, with the <U+017F>ame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and <U+017F>inceritie, as you expect I <U+017F>hould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve towards you. If your <U+017F>elf had oblig'd a per<U+017F>on to offer up his affections to you, and by all the endearing favours, which a Ladie may grant, without injurie or prejudice to her virtue, you had engag'd this per<U+017F>on to <U+017F>wear and vow an inviolable con<U+017F>tancy to you, would you not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him the ba<U+017F>e<U+017F>t and unworthie<U+017F>t of men, if he <U+017F>hould not perform the promi<U+017F>e he had made you?

               </p>
               <p>He would have proceeded with this and other formal arguments, to <U+017F>atisfie her, but <U+017F>he gave him not the time.
<q>I have enough, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,</hi> I perceive what your An<U+017F>wer will amount to, and cannot forbear admiring your con<U+017F>tancie, though it be <U+017F>o much contrarie to my <U+017F>atisfaction.

triumph of your fidelity.</q> She held a handkerchief before her eyes, while <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke tho<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words, as it were to keep her tears from being <U+017F>een by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who, if, on the one <U+017F>ide, troubled at what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid, was, on the other, <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with joy at the recovery of his liberty, that he could not have conceal'd it, though he had been the greate<U+017F>t hypocrite in the world: and 'tis to be imagin'd that if the Lady had ob<U+017F>erv'd, he could not have avoided her reproaches. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thought it long ere night came, for, as I told you before, I trouble not my <U+017F>elf much about the preci<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>ervance of times and hours: you may be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd it came, and that, being di<U+017F>pos'd into a Coach, he was brought back to his own lodgings, attended by the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>ons who had waited on him the night before.</p>
               <p>Being one of the kinde<U+017F>t Ma<U+017F>ters in the world, his Servants were over-joy'd to <U+017F>ee him again; but they enjoy'd him not long. He put on armour, and accompani'd by two of them, who<U+017F>e courage he had former experience of, he made all the ha<U+017F>te he could to the Grate, nay his ha<U+017F>te was <U+017F>uch, that tho<U+017F>e who attended him, had much ado to follow him. He had no <U+017F>ooner made the accu<U+017F>tom'd <U+017F>ignal, but the invi<U+017F>ible Deitie an<U+017F>wer'd him. They had a long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and that <U+017F>o full of affectionate tenderne<U+017F>s, on both <U+017F>ides, that I never think on it, without tears. At la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he told him, that, having receiv'd <U+017F>ome affront in the hou<U+017F>e where <U+017F>he then was, <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ent for her Coach, to remove thence; but in regard it would be long ere it came, and that his might be <U+017F>ooner got ready, <U+017F>he entreated him to <U+017F>end for it, to conduct her to a place, where
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60944:163"/>
he <U+017F>hould not any longer complain of her invi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. The amorous Gallant <U+017F>taid not for a longer entreaty, he ran to his Servants, whom he had left at the end of the <U+017F>treet, and <U+017F>ent them for his Coach, which being come, the invi<U+017F>ible Lady kept her promi<U+017F>e, and went along with him into it. She gave the Coach-man directions which way he <U+017F>hould go, and bid him <U+017F>top at a great hou<U+017F>e, into which he drove, by the light of many torches, which met them at the gate. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the Lady as <U+017F>he directed him, up a large pair of <U+017F>tairs, into a <U+017F>patious Hall, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd <U+017F>omewhat troubled to find her <U+017F>till mask'd. At la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>everal Gentlewomen richly apparrell'd, coming to receive them, every one with a great wax candle in her hand, the invi<U+017F>ible Lady di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd her <U+017F>elf, and taking off her mask, <U+017F>atisfi'd <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> that the Lady at the grate and the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Porcia</hi> were but one and the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on.</p>
               <p>It were no ea<U+017F>ie matter for me to tell you, how <U+017F>trangely the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was <U+017F>urpriz'd. The beautiful <hi>Neapolitan</hi> told him, that <U+017F>he had brought him away a <U+017F>econd time, to know his final re<U+017F>olution; that what preten<U+017F>ions <U+017F>oever the Lady at the grate had to him, were now become hers, with a thou<U+017F>and other things highly amorous and witty. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at her feet, embrac'd her knees, and ki<U+017F>s'd her hands, and <U+017F>o avoided the uttering of many impertinences, which people overjoy'd are apt to be guilty of. When the<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t tran<U+017F>porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were over, he rallied together all his wit and gallantry, to celebrate the plea<U+017F>ant humour of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and acquitted him<U+017F>elf in expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions <U+017F>o advantageous to her, that <U+017F>he was further a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60944:163"/>
of her not being mi<U+017F>taken in her choice. She told him, that <U+017F>he was unwilling to tru<U+017F>t any but her <U+017F>elf in a trial, without which, <U+017F>he could never have lov'd him, and that <U+017F>he would never have been any man's le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>tant than he had <U+017F>hewn him<U+017F>elf.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the Relations of the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Porcia</hi> being acquainted with her de<U+017F>ign, came in to them. She being one of the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable per<U+017F>ons in the Kingdom, and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> of great quality, it prov'd no hard matter to get a Di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation from the Arch-bi<U+017F>hop, for their marriage. They were married that very night, by the Par<U+017F>on of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>h, who being an eminent Preacher, 'tis likely, there wanted not a very good Exhortation. Some reported, that it was very late ere they were <U+017F>tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the next day, which I am apt enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. The News was <U+017F>oon divulg'd, whereat the Vice-Roy, who was nearly related to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> was <U+017F>o glad, that the publick diverti<U+017F>ements began afre<U+017F>h in <hi>Naples,</hi> where they <U+017F>till talk of the Loves of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and his <hi>INVISIBLE MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRESS.</hi>

'Tis true, it was not without the grumbling and barking of his Stomach, and to the co<U+017F>t of all tho<U+017F>e, with whom he could make any acquaintance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Marcos</hi> (<U+017F>o was called this remarkable example of penury) was a per<U+017F>on of a <U+017F>tature <U+017F>omewhat below the middle <U+017F>ize, and, through pure want of <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable nouri<U+017F>hment, he, in a <U+017F>hort time, became the <U+017F>lendere<U+017F>t, and drie<U+017F>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on in the world. When he waited on his Ma<U+017F>ter at table (which, it <U+017F>eems, was not <U+017F>o often as he could have wi<U+017F>h'd) he never chang'd his plate, but that, if there were any thing left on it, he had the admirable <U+017F>leight of conveying <U+017F>omewhat into his pocket, whether it were dry or liquid he matter'd not much. But finding by experience, that, when he <U+017F>ecur'd any thing of the latter kind, it could not
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60944:165"/>
be done without offence, he found out an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to prevent that inconvenience, for having converted into mony the wax of a great number of Torches ends, which he had very carefully kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he bought him a pair of pockets of your Latten-ware, wherewith he afterwards did miracles, in order to the advancement of his fortune.</p>
               <p>Mo<U+017F>t covetous per<U+017F>ons are commonly vigilant and careful, and the<U+017F>e two qualities, heightned by the in<U+017F>atiable pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which <hi>Dom Marcos</hi> had, to become a rich Man, rais'd in his Ma<U+017F>ter <U+017F>uch an extraordinary kindne<U+017F>s towards him, that he would not, by any means in the world, have parted with <U+017F>o excellent a Page. He continu'd him in his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, from the twelfth, as I told you, to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his Age, <U+017F>o that, upon the account of his Seniority, he might have taken place of all the Pages in <hi>Spain.</hi> But there happen'd an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, which prevail'd with his Ma<U+017F>ter to change that re<U+017F>olution, and that was, that this over-grown Page was oblig'd to <U+017F>have him<U+017F>elf every day; whereupon being transform'd from a Page into a Gentleman, he was made by his Ma<U+017F>ter what Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would never have made him.</p>
               <p>The advantage of this transformation was, that his allowance was advanc'd, by a daily addition of <U+017F>ome few Ryals; but he, in<U+017F>tead of adding any thing to his expence, rein'd his Pur<U+017F>e-<U+017F>trings the more, not regarding how much his new employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment oblig'd him to betray a proportionable libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.

pretending that they would have drunk of their Water, and <U+017F>ometimes in the Winter-time, they call'd up tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>old Wafers and Jumbals (a <U+017F>ort of people that walk as late as the Bak'd-pipin wenches do about <hi>London</hi>) to get off their Cloaths; but in regard this could not be done without a kind of violence, and that our <hi>Dom Marcos</hi> was of an humour, not to be unju<U+017F>t to any but him<U+017F>elf, he conceiv'd it his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e not to be troubled with any Servant. Never was there a Candle's end burnt in his Chamber, but he came to it by <U+017F>light of hand, and to make it la<U+017F>t as long as might be, he began to undre<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf in the <U+017F>treet, from the very place where he had lighted it, <U+017F>o that by that time he was come to his Chamber, he was in a manner ready to get into his Bed.

that pa<U+017F>s'd by, and <U+017F>o he <U+017F>uppli'd him<U+017F>elf with water for many days together. He went many times into a little Buttery, ju<U+017F>t at the time that the other Servants belonging to his Ma<U+017F>ter, who had their Diet in the Hou<U+017F>e, were at Meals, and there he would take occa<U+017F>ion to commend what they had before them, that <U+017F>ome body might invite him to ta<U+017F>te of it. He never bought any Wine, yet drunk of it every day, either by ta<U+017F>ting what the publick Criers carri'd about, or <U+017F>taying in the <U+017F>treets tho<U+017F>e, who had been buying at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barets, of whom he begg'd a ta<U+017F>te, as if he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to buy him<U+017F>elf of the <U+017F>ame.

               <p>They fell into <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, upon the coming in of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tine</hi> and the Dancing-women, and they <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome part of the night in dancing and <U+017F>inging. <hi>Dom Marcos,</hi> to <U+017F>pare him<U+017F>elf the trouble of returning to his own lodging, would have per<U+017F>uaded <hi>I<U+017F>idora,</hi> to conde<U+017F>cend, that they might, from that time, live together, as man and wife, or that at lea<U+017F>t he might lie in her hou<U+017F>e, in regard it was grown later than he had imagin'd.

               <p>
                  <hi>Dom Marcos</hi> was much pleas'd with her re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, notwith<U+017F>tanding his amorous impatience.

The Banes of Matrimony were <U+017F>oon ask'd out, for there happen'd to come two or three holy-days together. At la<U+017F>t, the marriage, <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ir'd on both <U+017F>ides, was con<U+017F>ummated, and the <U+017F>olemnity thereof occa<U+017F>ion'd a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence then was expected from the penuriou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the Bride-groom, who, out of a fear of making any breach in his ten thou<U+017F>and Crowns, borrow'd mony of his friends. The chiefe<U+017F>t of his Ma<U+017F>ter's <U+017F>ervants were at the wedding, and took occa<U+017F>ion ever and anon to commend the good choice he had made. The cheer was extraordinary, though at the charge of <hi>Dom Marcos,</hi> who for that time was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to defray all, and, by a prodigy of affection, had caus'd very rich cloaths to be made for <hi>I<U+017F>idora</hi> and him<U+017F>elf.</p>
               <p>The Gue<U+017F>ts departed in good time, and, the coa<U+017F>t being clear, <hi>Dom Marcos</hi> went him<U+017F>elf and lock'd the doors, and <U+017F>hut to and barr'd the windows, not <U+017F>o much for the <U+017F>ecurity of his wife, as that of the Trunks, wherein his mony lay, which he order'd to be brought into his own room and <U+017F>et clo<U+017F>e by the

But what compleated his di<U+017F>traction, was, that, after a light was brought into the room, he found, what he lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, his dear <U+017F>pou<U+017F>e of a far different figure, from that, under which he had been <U+017F>o much taken with her; nay, <U+017F>o dreadful was the <U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, that the narrow-hearted fellow was ready to <U+017F>wound. The poor Lady <U+017F>itting up half-a<U+017F>leep, half-awake in her bed, never minded, that her periwig was fallen off. At la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ees it on the ground, fallen down by the bed-<U+017F>ide, and, taking it up, would have put it on; but a thing is never well, when it is done with too much precipitation.

Then was it, that he bethought him of a noble Gold chain he had borrow'd, to adorn him<U+017F>elf withal on his Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-day; but all he had left of it, was that <U+017F>ad

Their conte<U+017F>t was almo<U+017F>t brought to an accommodation, when a Broker, accompanied by his Servants, and <U+017F>ome Porters, came into the room, and told <hi>I<U+017F>idora,</hi> that, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was richly match'd, he came for the Hou<U+017F>hold-<U+017F>tuff <U+017F>he had taken upon hire, together with the Brokage-mony, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had a mind to buy them out-right, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>pare him the trouble of taking them down.</p>
               <p>This unexpected accident put <hi>Dom Marcos</hi> out of all patience; he would have beaten the Broker; the Broker made it appear that he was a man as able to return as to receive, and fell a railing at <hi>I<U+017F>idora,</hi> who return'd him as good as he brought.

               <p>Upon this di<U+017F>covery, <hi>Dom Marcos</hi> made no difficulty to fling away his magical candles and to take the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>tor by the throat, which he gra<U+017F>p'd as hard as he could, crying out, with a dreadful voice, <hi>Thieves, Thieves.</hi> The Magi<U+017F>trate, attended by <U+017F>ome Officers, chanc'd to pa<U+017F>s by ju<U+017F>t at that time; They came into the hou<U+017F>e, where they imagin'd the noi<U+017F>e was made, which was the greater, in regard <hi>Gamara,</hi> whom <hi>Dom Marcos</hi> <U+017F>till had by the throat, cri'd out as loud as the other.

The Magi<U+017F>trate knew <hi>Gamara</hi> for a per<U+017F>on, he had look'd after a long time, and one he had order to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend as a notorious Night-walker, a Pandar, and a <U+017F>earcher of other mens hou<U+017F>es without any Commi<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He commanded them all three to pri<U+017F>on, and caus'd an inventory to be taken of all things found in the room. <hi>Dom Marcos</hi> was <U+017F>et at liberty the next day, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Ma<U+017F>ter's engagement for him.

There were many other things found, <U+017F>ome whereof they had <U+017F>tollen, <U+017F>ome taken in, as Pawns, for <hi>Gamara</hi> was a Jew, and con<U+017F>equently a Broker, and an U<U+017F>urer.

<U+017F>he had <U+017F>toll'n from <hi>Dom Marcos,</hi> an inclination to <U+017F>teal, not inferiour to that of her future husband; an aptitude to learn any thing he would have taught her, nay to exceed her Tutor, and a body hand<U+017F>ome, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome, and young enough, to be often bought, often <U+017F>eal'd and deliver'd, and likely to weather out, a long time, all the <U+017F>ervices and inconveniences of Curteza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>m.</p>
               <p>The ju<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s of <hi>Dom Marcos</hi>'s cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>upported by the mediation of his Ma<U+017F>ter, procur'd him the re<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all had been <U+017F>tollen from him. <hi>Gamara</hi> was condemn'd to the Gallies for the remainder of his life, unle<U+017F>s he <U+017F>hould out-live ninety-nine years; and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella</hi> was order'd to be <U+017F>everely whipp'd, and bani<U+017F>h'd; and the common opinion was, that they were both very favourably dealt with. As for <hi>Dom Marcos,</hi> he was not <U+017F>o glad of having recover'd <U+017F>ome of his things, and being reveng'd of <hi>Gamara</hi> and <hi>Marcella,</hi> as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that the cheating Rogue was no real Magician. The lo<U+017F>s of his ten thou<U+017F>and Crowns made him in a manner di<U+017F>tracted. He went every day to vi<U+017F>it all the Inns about <hi>Madrid,</hi> till, at la<U+017F>t, he met with certain Mule-drivers, who, returning from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> told him, that they had met, within four or five days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Madrid,</hi> a Wagon, loaden with hou<U+017F>hold-<U+017F>tuff, in which there were two women and a young man, and that they were forc'd to make <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tay at an Inn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e two of their Mules had di'd by the way, through over-driving. They de<U+017F>crib'd the man and the two women, <U+017F>o as that <hi>Dom Marcos</hi> pre<U+017F>um'd they could be no other than <hi>I<U+017F>idora, Inez,</hi> and <hi>Augu<U+017F>tine.</hi> Upon this adverti<U+017F>ement, without any further deliberation, he put him<U+017F>elf into a Pilgrim's habit, and having got Letters of recommendation from his Ma<U+017F>ter, to the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:60944:179"/>
Vice-Roy of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and a Decree out of the Court again<U+017F>t his fugitive wife, he took his way towards <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes a foot, <U+017F>ometimes on Mules, and got thither in a few days.</p>
               <p>He went immediately to the Port, to take up his lodging, and the fir<U+017F>t thing he <U+017F>aw, as he came into it, was his own Trunks, carried by Porters into a Shallop, and <hi>I<U+017F>idora, Inez,</hi> and <hi>Augu<U+017F>tine</hi> marching after them, as a Convoy, to be thence convey'd into a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el that lay in the Haven, wherein they were to embark for <hi>Naples. Dom Marcos</hi> follow'd his enemies, and went along with them into the Shallop, as fierce as a Lion. They knew him not, by rea<U+017F>on of his broad-brimm'd Pilgrim's hat, and took him for one going to our Lady's of <hi>Loretto,</hi> whereas the Mariners receiv'd him as one of the <U+017F>ame company, becau<U+017F>e he came in <U+017F>o confidently along with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dom Marcos,</hi> being thus got into the Shallop, could not <U+017F>it <U+017F>till, by rea<U+017F>on of the di<U+017F>traction of his thoughts, not <U+017F>o much out of any reflection what <U+017F>hould become of him<U+017F>elf, as what <U+017F>hould become of his Trunks.
