            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that, there is a kinde of lazine<U+017F>s in the mindes of mo<U+017F>t men, that make them <U+017F>it
down with things formerly thought on by others, and never to look after any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements
or di<U+017F>coveries of their own. And as this hath extreamly pe<U+017F>tered <hi>Poetry,</hi>
<U+017F>o hath it been <hi>fatal</hi> even to <hi>Philo<U+017F>ophy,</hi> which profe<U+017F><U+017F>es a <U+017F>evere <hi>inque<U+017F>t</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi>
which certainly <U+017F>hould enlarge to greater <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> of thought, then a
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s intended only for <hi>plea<U+017F>ure</hi> and all capacities, <U+017F>ince we <U+017F>ee how few <hi>heads</hi> of
<hi>Philo<U+017F>ophy</hi> there have been, and how many <hi>followers;</hi> and what an infinite number
hath follow'd <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> for <U+017F>o many centuries together, in re<U+017F>pect of tho<U+017F>e very
<hi>few</hi> exalted and heroical <U+017F>pirits, who have disdain'd the fetters of <hi>Tradition</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>Others there have been, who willing out of what had been left by others, to
melt down what they thought fitting into their own works, that have not been
much more lucky then the former, but only di<U+017F>guis'd foolery from one <U+017F>hape to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
or el<U+017F>e grave and <U+017F>erious things into things very ridiculous. Thus <hi>Ovid</hi> by
bringing <hi>Hieroglyphical</hi> learning into literal <hi>Fables,</hi> hath ama<U+017F>s'd together a <U+017F>ort of
the odde<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t childi<U+017F>h whim<U+017F>es that ever were. Thus <hi>Ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Nay, and thus many men not weighing di<U+017F>creetly the differences of <hi>times,
per<U+017F>ons</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> which they have had to repre<U+017F>ent, have fallen into errors very

            <p>Nay, even that <hi>Poetry</hi> which comes to the <hi>City,</hi> and which <U+017F>eems rather to look

they hold no proportion at all. But as the mind of man ea<U+017F>ily receives the wor<U+017F>t

            <p>The<U+017F>e are the noble entertainments of Books of this kinde, which how profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
they are, you may judge; how <hi>pernicious,</hi> 'tis ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>een, if they meet but
with an intentive <hi>Melancholy,</hi> and a <U+017F>pirit apt to be overborn by <U+017F>uch follies. Such
a one was our <hi>LYSIS,</hi> who is here pre<U+017F>ented, one that thought their <hi>Sotti<U+017F>es,</hi>
examples of <hi>life,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e other impertinent circum<U+017F>tances which they bring, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
into pre<U+017F>ent practi<U+017F>e. And therefore by imitating them, he hath ama<U+017F>s;d
together a number of the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable follies that ever were <U+017F>een; <U+017F>uch a one
hath our Author made him, and that very ju<U+017F>tly, <U+017F>ince all the <hi>Fooleries</hi> of all <hi>Men</hi>
and <hi>Books</hi> of this nature, he hath arraign'd and convicted in this <hi>one</hi> Per<U+017F>on, and
this <hi>one</hi> Book, with a de<U+017F>ign, not only judicious enough, but al<U+017F>o profitably plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant.
For while he brings on the <U+017F>tage their fooleries, though with better judgement
and nobler invention then ever they were before, he brings them withal <U+017F>o habited,
that it will not be ea<U+017F>ie for any <U+017F>ober minde to be further enamour'd of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
that, con<U+017F>idering how plea<U+017F>ant <U+017F>uch kinde of tra<U+017F>h is, and what heads and

who when they have done all they can, are as unprofitable in the Commonwealth,
as <U+017F>o many Vermin in a Warren. And yet they think it an injury, if they are not
call'd <hi>Wits,</hi> as if it were as proper for the people to <U+017F>peak of them with the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of <hi>Wit, Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Learnedne<U+017F>s,</hi> as they do by that of <hi>Wor<U+017F>hip</hi> to a <hi>Ju<U+017F>tice</hi>
of <hi>Peace,</hi> and expect that adoration and reverence which was anciently paid to
<hi>Orators</hi> and <hi>Philo<U+017F>ophers.</hi> But <U+017F>ince there are withal in the world a many excellent
men, who make a <hi>Recreation,</hi> and not a profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Writing,</hi> a more particular
cen<U+017F>ure will be more becoming; and <U+017F>ince the quarrel I am engag'd as to the other,
is with their works, and not with their per<U+017F>ons, I <U+017F>hall forbear to bring them into
further contempt, and not envy them the acclamations of the be<U+017F>otted populacie,
<U+017F>ince I perceive they are <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinate, as to be more taken with the extravagancies
of tho<U+017F>e men, then with any thing relative to the publike good, or the conduct of
humane life.</p>
            <p>The fir<U+017F>t thing I <U+017F>hall note, is, the tran<U+017F>portation of our <hi>Shepherd,</hi> while he
contemplates tho<U+017F>e excellent Reliques he had gather'd of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es. This, it
may be, may <U+017F>eem ridiculous, and <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tupidity as could not fall into the minde
of man, however tran<U+017F>ported by his own imaginations. If I produce as ridiculous
in the more <U+017F>erious and admired Authors, <U+017F>hall it be taken for good payment?
<hi>Lopa de Vega</hi> in his <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> brings <hi>Pamphilius</hi> and <hi>Ni<U+017F>a</hi> into <hi>Bedlam</hi> (their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies
having been <U+017F>uch, that they were taken for mad) where <hi>Ni<U+017F>a</hi> findes no
pre<U+017F>ents for her <hi>Pamphilius,</hi> but that which the floor afforded, du<U+017F>t, dirt, <U+017F>traws,
and the like, wherewith yet he embroidered his clothes, as if they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<U+017F>tones or feathers. Were they not worthily di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed where they were? if this
be not as extravagant as our <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I know not what is. The Author of the Hi<U+017F>tory
of <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> and <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta,</hi> hath as good <U+017F>tories; alas, Lovers put another value
<pb facs="tcp:43725:6"/>
on things then other men; and that Knight in <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> who falling in love with a
Lady whom he had detain'd in chains (being di<U+017F>guis'd in Mans cloaths) pa<U+017F>s'd his
time afterward in ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing and courting the chains, and wearing them about his neck,
never putting them off but when he went abroad, I think is one may well <U+017F>hake
hands with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he thinks the Stars living creatures, is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a Philo<U+017F>ophy, as that
of tho<U+017F>e who maintain they feed on the vapours of the earth and the <U+017F>ea. If you will
not believe him, believe <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> in his hymns, who <U+017F>ays, they feed in the Plains of
Heaven all night, and in the morning the Day-<U+017F>tar (who is the Keeper) brings them
together, tels them over, and drives them for all day into the <U+017F>hade.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Adrians</hi> Relation, 'tis natural, and <U+017F>uch as becomes a man of his quality,
who is a dull <U+017F>oft-headed <hi>Citizen,</hi> not much acquainted with <hi>Romances;</hi> and the
Books he quotes are <U+017F>uch as he under<U+017F>tands, that is, <U+017F>uch as children go to <U+017F>chool

            <p>As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s demanding of Ver<U+017F>es of the Country-Shepherd, he that knows
any thing of <hi>Romances,</hi> knows how familiar it is there to have Shepherds an<U+017F>wer
one another in Ver<U+017F>es, and the Authors make whom they plea<U+017F>e excellent extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
<hi>Poets.</hi> As for his de<U+017F>cription of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es beauty, he is not the only man
hath given <U+017F>uch extravagant power to the eyes of a Beauty. Ask <hi>La Roque:</hi>

a prophaner expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion by much then that of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now he comes to the Dialogue with the <hi>Eccho:</hi> Which becau<U+017F>e it hath
been a generall Ornament in all <hi>Love-<U+017F>tories</hi> and Books of <hi>Shepherdry,</hi> and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<U+017F>uch a gro<U+017F>s impertinence, our Remark on it <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>o much the larger. The
Pa<U+017F>torals of <hi>Julietta</hi> are pe<U+017F>ter'd with them, though far-fetch'd: Nay, the witty
<hi>Era<U+017F>mus</hi> hath not in this been very fortunate; otherwi<U+017F>e why <U+017F>hould the Eccho
an<U+017F>wer in <hi>Greek,</hi> when <U+017F>he was <U+017F>poken to in <hi>Latine?</hi> 'Tis as if a man <U+017F>hould ask
her <U+017F>omwhat in <hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> and <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould an<U+017F>wer in <hi>Wel<U+017F>h</hi> or <hi>Iri<U+017F>h.</hi> But to forgive
that, when a man hath <U+017F>poken ten or twelve lines, how can <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wer all in one
word? But of all the Compo<U+017F>ers of Eccho's that ever were, a Gentleman of our
own Country, and an Author, hath been <U+017F>o fortunate, that he hath brought two or
three hundred into the compa<U+017F>s of one <U+017F>heet of paper, and his Conceits are withall
incomprehen<U+017F>ible: I have heard <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay of them, that had they been to find out
<U+017F>o many, they might have worn out ten Dictionaries to find out the rimes. But
what our Author <U+017F>ays in defence of him<U+017F>elf is, that all the wonder in his was, that
it was <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s good fortune to light on things, that <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> could either an<U+017F>wer or
rime to with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>en<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>But for the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> concerning the Eccho, I may <U+017F>ay they are no
ordinary invention. I could make long Remarks on the <hi>Pantomimes,</hi> which were
a <U+017F>ort of people of old that counterfeited the cry birds and bea<U+017F>ts. <hi>Parmeno</hi>
counterfeited the grunting of a Pig <U+017F>o excellently well, that it became a Proverb:
<U+017F>o that when another Actor brought a real Pig under his cloak upon the <U+017F>tage, and
made it grunt, yet the people cry'd out, that was not <hi>Parmeno's</hi> Pig; whereupon
he <U+017F>hew'd them the Pig, to convince them <hi>Parmeno</hi> could do no better. This <U+017F>tory,
as it well di<U+017F>covers the fooli<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s and ob<U+017F>tinacie of prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed minds, <U+017F>o was it a
<U+017F>it example for <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> <U+017F>peaking of the Eccho, which they <U+017F>ay imitates all
voices.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eccho</hi> which is made of Conduits of congeal'd aire, is an Invention in
the <hi>Steganography</hi> of <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> but much advanc'd and clear'd up by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the <hi>De<U+017F>tinies</hi> le<U+017F>s admirable. There is an <hi>Italian</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
between Life and Death, <U+017F>peaking as if they were the <hi>two</hi> De<U+017F>tinies; and that
<pb facs="tcp:43725:6"/>
when one hath perfected the web of a mans life, the other cuts it off. This hath
more wit then that of the Ancients.</p>
            <p>Nor are <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s de<U+017F>criptions of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es beauty <U+017F>o extravagant, but I can
ea<U+017F>ily match them. <hi>A certain poor man had a daughter; yet if her Beauty were truly
con<U+017F>idered, he might be <U+017F>aid to be a very rich man; for in her face he po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
Rubies, Coral and Pearl.</hi> This is an Imagination in one of the <hi>Nouuelles.</hi>
But is it not enough to <U+017F>ay, Lips are of Coral, and <U+017F>o of the re<U+017F>t, but it mu<U+017F>t be
<U+017F>aid they can enrich a body? If this poor man wanted any thing, he mu<U+017F>t pull
out one of his daughters Eyes, or cut off her Lip, and carry it to the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>miths.</p>
            <p>This ob<U+017F>ervation of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es colour is in <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> extraordinary, and argues his
invention. 'Tis true, the <hi>Turks</hi> bear a great re<U+017F>pect to <hi>Green; Mahomet's</hi> Turbant
was of it, and it is now a prerogative of tho<U+017F>e only of that race; and if any be to
be puni<U+017F>hed, for <U+017F>ome crime, the Turbant is fir<U+017F>t taken off as <U+017F>acred. But the rea<U+017F>on
why <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hates the <hi>Turks,</hi> is, becau<U+017F>e they know nothing of <hi>Romances</hi> and a
<hi>Shepherds</hi> life.</p>
            <p>That he calls the Kitchin-maid <hi>Godde<U+017F>s</hi> of the <hi>Pottage-pot,</hi> it rubs the ancient <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
e<U+017F>pecially that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who put their Gods to all the offices and <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
they had to do. They had a <hi>Cloacina,</hi> which we may call <hi>Scavangera,</hi> or
the Godde<U+017F>s of the Common-<U+017F>hores. There were no le<U+017F>s then three Gods about
one Cradle; one kept the Child from crying, another rock'd the Cradle, a third
look'd to the Womans brea<U+017F>ts.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the day of Judgment at <hi>S. Cloud.</hi> The examples of this kind
are infinite. When <hi>London-Bridge</hi> was afire, the Country-people that <U+017F>aw it afar
off, thought the world was at an end, and that it began to burn at this great City,
where more iniquity had been committed then el<U+017F>where. The day of Judgment hath
been <U+017F>o often foretold both by <hi>Mini<U+017F>ters</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trologers,</hi> that many now believe
there will not be any at all. A certain rich man in <hi>Leice<U+017F>ter-<U+017F>hire,</hi> upon the reading
of an Almanack, be<U+017F>tow'd between his friends and the poor all he had, and came
afterwards to beg his bread. Nay, <U+017F>uch was the <U+017F>tupidity of Mankind, that even in
the fir<U+017F>t Ages there wanted not Enthu<U+017F>ia<U+017F>ts to amu<U+017F>e the people. Every per<U+017F>ecuting
Emperor was thought to be Antichri<U+017F>t; nay, the Fathers were not much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olute
in this point then others. But I have no mind to <U+017F>hew my reading here
of that, nor yet to advance the divers opinions have been held of the end of the
world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montvalerian</hi> is a place neer <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> where live <U+017F>ix Hermites. This I tell you,
becau<U+017F>e the Author of <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> and <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta</hi> <U+017F>ays, that when their <hi>Maje<U+017F>ties</hi> went
to <U+017F>ee one of them, who had not been <U+017F>een in 48 years, he al<U+017F>o <U+017F>aw him, and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ander</hi>
liv'd with him afterwards in his Cell.</p>
            <p>But the people of <hi>St. Cloud</hi> are beholding to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and his <hi>Poets,</hi> at lea<U+017F>t were
they not the next morning? If a <hi>Lover</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay he burn'd in mid-winter, would
not a <U+017F>imple man think he were in a feaver? If he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay he were on the rack,
and that that Fiend <hi>Love</hi> fed on his heart, as the Vulture did on that of <hi>Prometheus,</hi>
would not a <U+017F>ober man unacquainted with Poetry think his meaning were that he
was damn'd in this life?</p>
            <p>The Pa<U+017F>torals of <hi>Leon,</hi> the River <hi>Ezla,</hi> and the Shepherd <hi>Sirenus</hi> have had for
their Celebrator <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Montemajor,</hi> of which book anon.</p>
            <p>Tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Ve<U+017F>per, Ly<U+017F>is</hi> contemns, as repre<U+017F>enting things with too much proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
as Country-people may love now; but he is for <hi>Cyrenus, Celadon,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e
other <hi>illu<U+017F>trious</hi> Shepherds.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Rout, it's an humour cla<U+017F>hes not with his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance;
for mad as he was, he remembred that now being entred into the
condition of a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> he was to live <hi>peaceably</hi> with all men, and con<U+017F>equently
not to be tran<U+017F>ported <U+017F>o far by pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion as to give one blow for another.</p>
            <p>And thus much by way of Remark on the fir<U+017F>t Book, wherein I have been the
larger, becau<U+017F>e I would <U+017F>hew how much more I might have <U+017F>aid in ju<U+017F>tification of
<pb facs="tcp:43725:7"/>
my Author. In the re<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hall confine my <U+017F>elf to the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable heads:

               <p>
                  <hi>LY<U+017F>is</hi>'s contempt of good Books, <U+017F>hews he e<U+017F>teems all pedantry that is not
Romantick; and for his meeting with the Satyre, 'tis an humor any one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
of his Authors could have furni<U+017F>h'd him with.</p>
               <p>But the chiefe<U+017F>t matter of this Book, is that of the <hi>Metaphorical Picture,</hi> which
he had given directions for in the fir<U+017F>t. The de<U+017F>criptions of Beauty have been <U+017F>uch
as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> mentions, ever <U+017F>ince there were any Poets in the world; and it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem
to be their chiefe<U+017F>t <U+017F>tudy and emulation to de<U+017F>cribe it the more extravagantly, and
the more fanta<U+017F>tically. But the grand foolery is, that when they have de<U+017F>crib'd their
Beauties with <hi>Suns, Coral, Diamonds, Ivory,</hi> &amp;c. they cannot let alone poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
women that have but fle<U+017F>h and blood. But as for the Picture, you mu<U+017F>t needs
think it was much more noble when it was in colours, as <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had done it: the
particulars explain them<U+017F>elves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e between</hi> An<U+017F>elmes <hi>and</hi> Montenor, <hi>I <U+017F>hall quote one thing as to
the Language.</hi> Antithe<U+017F>es <hi>and</hi> Contrarieties <hi>are mighty ornaments; as to <U+017F>ay,</hi> Love
<hi>is</hi> a plea<U+017F>ure full of <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s; a torment full of delight; a de<U+017F>pairing hope, <hi>and</hi> a hoping
de<U+017F>pair: <hi>I think what</hi> Montenor <hi><U+017F>aies is more gentle,</hi> If Love be a poi<U+017F>on, 'tis a
plea<U+017F>ant one; if a di<U+017F>quiet, 'tis de<U+017F>ireable; if a death, peaceable; if a pri<U+017F>on, there
wants only liberty, and mi<U+017F>ery reigns not there as in others. <hi>Is not this better <U+017F>aid,
then to <U+017F>ay that</hi> Love is a free pri<U+017F>on, and an incarcerated liberty? <hi>But the<U+017F>e things
I <U+017F>hall leave to the ob<U+017F>ervation of the Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not the <U+017F>ea makes women more or le<U+017F>s vertuous or perfect, nor yet more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
but to the latter, the per<U+017F>everance and iteration of mens temptations have
contributed much, <U+017F>ince it is the knowledge of all things beget the de<U+017F>ire of them.
All that I have to <U+017F>ay, is, that the <hi>Poets</hi> who idolize them with all the attributes of
Divinity, are al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e that load them with all the calumny po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. A <hi>Poet</hi> <U+017F>hall
<hi>deifie a Tripe-woman</hi> if <U+017F>he be his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; but though <U+017F>he be never <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>om,
if <U+017F>he be withal di<U+017F>dainful, <hi>Bear, Serpent, Viper, Wa<U+017F>ps, Fiends,</hi> is not language fit
to de<U+017F>cribe her.</p>
               <p>As for the humor of the difference between <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> whereof
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> is Judge, 'tis ordinary in Love-<U+017F>tories, and 'tis the Ore of the <hi>Golden-Age,</hi>
when the fir<U+017F>t man met was the Judge of all controver<U+017F>ies. All the proceedings in
this have very good Authors, but it is not to much purpo<U+017F>e to quote them
here.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s Serenade, his <hi>Letter,</hi> and all the circum<U+017F>tances of it, other Lovers
have done things of the like nature, and therefore I pa<U+017F>s them over. But as for the
Letter, I mu<U+017F>t do him right, it was his own as to the compo<U+017F>ure; but for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions,
his Countrymen <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard, Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

with much more extravagant and greater contradictions: but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s complements
came ever out of his Common-places; for he bore <U+017F>uch a reverence to tho<U+017F>e good
Authors, that he cho<U+017F>e rather to deliver him<U+017F>elf in their language then in his own.
I heard of a Country-Gentleman, that having bought the <hi>Academy of Complements,</hi>
came to court his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, where after he had pa<U+017F>s'd his Complement, he wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<U+017F>he did not an<U+017F>wer him as it was in the Book. The next time he came to <hi>London</hi>
he bought one for her, that <U+017F>o <U+017F>he might be able to continue the Dialogue with
him.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who would light the candle at his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es eyes, 'tis not more then
Poetical; all his conceptions about the flyes, the trees growing, &amp;c. betray his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him that knows any thing.</p>

As for the burning of his hat, he might ea<U+017F>ily believe it was his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s did it;

as any of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s dream is nothing extraordinary, and his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es and actions thereupon
<U+017F>peak him not <U+017F>o extravagant as <U+017F>ome other Lovers have been; but above all things
it is to be ob<U+017F>erved, that let him do what he can, he <U+017F>till comes <U+017F>hort of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters

               <p>But his calling his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s the <hi>Beauty of Beauties,</hi> is his own, 'tis a little vulgar,
yet few con<U+017F>ider it expre<U+017F><U+017F>es not what they intend; and that that expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion is only
proper in this, The <hi>King of Kings;</hi> that is to <U+017F>ay, a King that governs other
Kings, but the beauty of Beauties <U+017F>ignifies but a Beauty: So the Romance of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
or the Shepherd of Shepherds; nay, rather it <U+017F>ignifies a Beauty that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to other Beauties, which is contrary to our intention: This is called Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limathias.</p>
               <p>The heavine<U+017F>s and weight of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s heart mu<U+017F>t needs be great, becau<U+017F>e he is no

               <p>The con<U+017F>iderations of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s departure, and of <hi>Charite</hi>'s, are <U+017F>uch as could be

places where it is forbidden to <U+017F>peak, as in Mona<U+017F>teries; but there he finds <hi>Di<U+017F>cord</hi>
with her black and gray hair, which <U+017F>eem'd to fight one with another: Her hands
were full of Chancery-Bills and Law-writings, and <U+017F>he had about her an Army of
Councellors and Sollicitors; <U+017F>he <U+017F>ate al<U+017F>o Pre<U+017F>ident at a Chapter, when the Monks
being on the election of a Prior, divide into <U+017F>uch factions, that the Breviaries do
mighty execution on the bald pates. What need had this malicious <hi>Poet</hi> thus to
abu<U+017F>e the <hi>Monks,</hi> who are not all naught, and to <U+017F>candalize a Religion he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
defended? But what a <U+017F>imple Angel hath he pitch'd on, that was to <U+017F>eek what
he knew not where to find? 'Tis an abu<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e divine Spirits, and him who<U+017F>e
Agents they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vulcan</hi> was the fitte<U+017F>t for the Kitchin, as being always neere<U+017F>t the fire. Nor was
<hi>Pythagonas</hi> le<U+017F>s for the <U+017F>auces, <U+017F>ince he was the be<U+017F>t acquainted with herbs and
fruits. And what is <U+017F>aid of him and the other Philo<U+017F>ophers, is home to their
Tenets.</p>
               <p>The Raillerie which follows along is obvious, as that of taking down the Signes
by <hi>Brontes</hi> and <hi>Pyragmon,</hi> who are <hi>Vulcan's</hi> Kitchin-boyes; the divers entries of
the Gods: That <hi>Ae<U+017F>culapius</hi> is Phy<U+017F>itian; the Gods had need of one ever <U+017F>ince
<hi>Homer</hi> affirm'd they might be hurt or <U+017F>ick. The Arms of the Gods, may make us
laugh at their Statues.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>Fate</hi> makes <hi>Terminus</hi> eat, that is, what he hath decreed mu<U+017F>t come to pa<U+017F>s,
and 'tis he only hath the key of his padlock. <hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are well <U+017F>eated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
But that <hi>Jupiter</hi> <U+017F>hould fall <U+017F>o heartily to the <hi>Souls,</hi> is not without rea<U+017F>on,
<U+017F>ince <U+017F>ome <hi>Philo<U+017F>ophers</hi> have held, that all <U+017F>ouls were reunited in the <U+017F>oul of the
world, which they held to be <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But as the Gods live only on <hi><U+017F>ouls</hi> and <hi>idaa's</hi>
<U+017F>o have I <U+017F>een a <hi>Banquet of Poets,</hi> and their food was the <hi>vowels</hi> in a Ver<U+017F>e which
are cut off and not pronounc'd.</p>
               <p>The drunkenne<U+017F>s of the Gods is to be laid on their <U+017F>core, who have furni<U+017F>h'd
them with all other vices.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>cuffle between the Pedees and the Pages about the wing of the <U+017F>oule of a
Turkey, is to <U+017F>hew that tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ouls had the forms of bodies, and are di<U+017F>pers'd into all
parts of the body to exerci<U+017F>e their functions.</p>
               <p>As for the Signs of Heaven, I quarrel not with their names, becau<U+017F>e I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to <U+017F>ay to the A<U+017F>trologers, though they have not the images of tho<U+017F>e bea<U+017F>ts
by who<U+017F>e names they call them. But why <U+017F>hould our Poets build their fables on
them, and <U+017F>o fill Heaven with Adulteries and other crimes? <hi>Du Bartas</hi> and others,
to take away the memory of tho<U+017F>e villanies, would needs change the fable into a
<U+017F>acred <U+017F>tory, <U+017F>aying the <hi>Lyon</hi> belongs to <hi>Samp<U+017F>on,</hi> the <hi>Ship</hi> to <hi>Noa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>S. Luke,</hi> and <hi>Virgo</hi> and <hi>Via lactea</hi> to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> &amp;c. but they cannot carry
out the humour.</p>
               <p>There was no <U+017F>uch way to abu<U+017F>e the odd per<U+017F>onages which the Poets attribute to
the Gods, as that of the latter band of Gods; and we mu<U+017F>t never more <U+017F>peak any
otherwi<U+017F>e then abu<U+017F>ively of them all, as my Author does.</p>
               <p>I know I have omitted divers things which de<U+017F>erve to be taken notice of: For
there is not any pa<U+017F><U+017F>age in this Banquet which hath not a <U+017F>ecret grace, be<U+017F>ides that
it contains the whole <U+017F>tory of all the ancient fables, and that dige<U+017F>ted into a natural
order. <hi>Lucian</hi> in his Dialogues may have <U+017F>omwhat of this humour, but he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect;
<pb facs="tcp:43725:8"/>
and it was his de<U+017F>ign to deny the eternal Providence, which is not taken
away with the lo<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e names he quarrels with.</p>
               <p>That's no le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ubtle attacque to the Fables, of <hi>Montenor's,</hi> as to the confu<U+017F>ion
of them. If <hi>Phaeton</hi> and his Father, as they <U+017F>ay, fell into the River <hi>Eridan,</hi> why do
they not tell us how they got out again? But there's no le<U+017F>s inconvenience, if we
<U+017F>ay that that Torch of the Day is fa<U+017F>tened to the Chariot of <hi>Phoebus;</hi> for <hi>Ovid</hi> <U+017F>ays
the Chariot was broke all to peeces.</p>
               <p>That there is as much morality in ROBERT <hi>the Devil,</hi> as in the <U+017F>tory of
<hi>Hercules,</hi> is certain; for that was a <U+017F>turdy fellow, and Mythologie hath a great
latitude, for a wicked man may be made vertuous. If one man kill another, the
meaning is, the victory of the wi<U+017F>e man over the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions; and <U+017F>o of the
re<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> hath pe<U+017F>ter'd us with his Mythologies; and for his Genealogies
of the Gods they are <U+017F>o various, that every one hath three or four fathers. Mr. <hi>Ro<U+017F>s</hi>
hath gone beyond him, and hath defil'd the Sacred hi<U+017F>tory with the ordure and filth
of Heathen fables.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ly<U+017F>is'</hi>s de<U+017F>criptions of Beauty, being by him <U+017F>poken <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, are an open abu<U+017F>e
to the Poets, who<U+017F>e di<U+017F>ciple he is. Nor is he le<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf, where he propo<U+017F>es that
every one <U+017F>hould relate his <U+017F>tory. And for his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <hi>Charite,</hi> con<U+017F>idering
what he is, and what <U+017F>he is, it is very natural. What would a <U+017F>imple Country-La<U+017F>s
<U+017F>ay, if a man <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he had hurt him, but ask whether <U+017F>he had prick'd him, or <U+017F>cratch'd
him? But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had learn'd out of his Romances, that a Lover ought to <U+017F>peak al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<U+017F>ively
to <U+017F>omwhat his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s had <U+017F>aid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarimond</hi> concludes with that <U+017F>aying; That to be happy, a man mu<U+017F>t be either
<hi>King</hi> or <hi>Fool.</hi> Wherein he is in the right. Plea<U+017F>ure is not mea<U+017F>ur'd by the reality of
things, but the imagination of them. There was a Serving-man, who would not
live with any Ma<U+017F>ter, but upon condition he might have one hour in the day to do
what he pleas'd in his chamber. Having led this life a long time, his Ma<U+017F>ter would
needs know how he <U+017F>pent the time. Coming to his chamber-door, he perceiv'd
through <U+017F>ome chink, his man <U+017F>ate in a chair with a Crown on his head, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him on the wall a draught of the Pope and Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tory; there did he make a
<U+017F>peech for the Pope, and an<U+017F>wer'd it in the name of the Emperor. But the Ma<U+017F>ter
di<U+017F>covering him<U+017F>elf, the Fool folded up his Picture and went his ways, and was never
<U+017F>een <U+017F>ince. Such a one is <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who though he be not <U+017F>tark mad, yet conceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
happier then an <hi>Emperor</hi> in his Pa<U+017F>toral and amorous imaginations. But he
advances in his Extravagances, and finds my Author work for a</p>

               <p>WHerein though in <U+017F>ome things he exceed his predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors, yet in <U+017F>ome
he <U+017F>hews him<U+017F>elf more <U+017F>ober and more rational, as may appear by the
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e about the de<U+017F>pair of Lovers, whom he finds in his books to
have arriv'd at that madne<U+017F>s, as to have hang'd and drown'd them<U+017F>elves. But this
you mu<U+017F>t attribute to his good intervals. <hi>Clarimond's</hi> di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and his replies touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Poetry,</hi> and his own <hi>Hi<U+017F>tory,</hi> (which he is extremely carefull to have come
abroad) are not ordinary.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Golden A<U+017F>s</hi> is a work of <hi>Apuleius;</hi> the argument of it <U+017F>tollen out of <hi>Lucian,</hi>
only he hath added the fable of <hi>P<U+017F>yche</hi> and <U+017F>ome old wives tales. All the excu<U+017F>e I
can make for this, is, that haply in his time <hi>Lucian's</hi> works were very rare, and he
was in hope they would have been lo<U+017F>t, that <U+017F>o no man might di<U+017F>cover the cheat;
otherwi<U+017F>e certainly he would have acknowledg'd his Benefactor.</p>
               <p>His explication of Dreams argues his wit and reading: But for what is <U+017F>aid of

very mournful; the dames of <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>ing it to this day in memory of this famous
Shepherd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s <U+017F>ong is follow'd with a notable abu<U+017F>e of the Poets; for they never cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the kindene<U+017F>s nor the cruelty of their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, but when <U+017F>ome fancy comes
into their mindes fit to expre<U+017F>s tho<U+017F>e qualities, rhiming it <U+017F>eems is <U+017F>uch a rack. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ander</hi>
calls <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta</hi> in his <U+017F>ongs, <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Hippolita,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Sylvia,</hi> which
made the Gentlewoman very jealous of his con<U+017F>tancy.</p>
               <p>To think a Hermit a Magician, he might haply have had it from <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o,</hi> who in
his <hi>Jeru<U+017F>alem,</hi> makes the Chri<U+017F>tian Hermits all Magicians, and withal celebrates them
for very devout and religious men.</p>
               <p>His coming to <hi>Hircans</hi> wood, and his con<U+017F>iderations there, betray a huge read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but his thoughts running <U+017F>till on magick, was that made him take <hi>Hircan</hi> for a
Magician, and what he <U+017F>ayes to confirm him in that opinion, is founded on what
the Poets <U+017F>ay of the ancient Sorcereffes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Armida</hi> was a Sorcere<U+017F>s that in a minute of an hour, caus'd a great ca<U+017F>tle to be
built, if you believe <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf like a Maid, and his per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions that he was really one,
and was taken for one, 'tis an humor <U+017F>o thread-bare in all Books of Shepherdry
and Love-<U+017F>tories, that I need <U+017F>ay more of it; only I <U+017F>hall note, that it is more
probable in <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for <hi>Hircan</hi> caus'd him to be trim'd, a thing tho<U+017F>e Authours
thought not on, but putting on other cloathes, without any other circum<U+017F>tance
they are pre<U+017F>ently what <U+017F>ex they plea<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>As for what is <U+017F>aid of the <hi>Nymphs,</hi> 'tis to abu<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>uch admirers of
Antiquity. If they had gone in <hi>Greece</hi> as people do now in <hi>France,</hi> we <U+017F>hould have
had the Nymphs dre<U+017F>s'd after another mode. And for <hi>Fables,</hi> why may not we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
as good ones as the Ancients? and why <U+017F>hould it be thought ridiculous for
us to <U+017F>ee the Gods dre<U+017F>s'd like us, more then the <hi>Greeks</hi> were to <U+017F>ee them habited
like them?</p>
               <p>The crime this counterfeit Maid is accus'd of at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, brings upon the <U+017F>tage
the many Trials they had, whereby to know whether a maid or wife had done any
thing di<U+017F>honorable: becau<U+017F>e in <hi>Hi<U+017F>tory</hi> we finde <U+017F>ome who<U+017F>e innocency hath been
try'd certain ways; as the ve<U+017F>tal <hi>Turia,</hi> that being accus'd of uncha<U+017F>tity, carried
water in a five from <hi>Tiber</hi> to her Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es Temple, to ju<U+017F>tifie her innocency;
therefore the Poets mu<U+017F>t invent <U+017F>o many ridiculous <hi>Fables</hi> for the <U+017F>ame effect, as if it
were nothing to <U+017F>et God a work on miracles at their plea<U+017F>ure, unle<U+017F>s if one, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
be ca<U+017F>t into the fire for tryal of his innocency, a <hi>Pantarb</hi> (which is a certain
<U+017F>tone which frees from flames) does the work; as you may <U+017F>ee in the <U+017F>tory of
<hi>Chariclea</hi> in <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> But the miracle you mu<U+017F>t conceive, is to be attributed to
certain Magical Characters that were graven on the Stone, a very probable
Foolery.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to <hi>Charite,</hi> let us do the Poets no wrong, he hath it from
them. <hi>Medu<U+017F>a</hi> turn'd all before her into <U+017F>tones, and <hi>Anaxarete</hi> was the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
of that <hi>Iphis</hi> that hang'd him<U+017F>elf at her door. The<U+017F>e are hard names, and <hi>Charite</hi>
might take them for abu<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>Some have not thought there was <U+017F>o much grace in <hi>Carmelins</hi> <U+017F>peeches; but they
are to know, that by <hi>Common-places, Ly<U+017F>is</hi> meant a <U+017F>ort of <hi>Pedantick</hi> books,
where a man may Alphabetically finde <U+017F>omewhat on every thing. And the <hi>French
Margarites</hi> is a book much like the <hi>Academy of Complements,</hi> only it hath this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
withal, that it is good to learn bad French by.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>tatue of <hi>Memnon,</hi> out of which proceeded an harmonious <U+017F>ound, when
<U+017F>mitten by the rays of the Sun, goes near to give me a vomit, I can <U+017F>hew a dozen
books of good account, that in the Epi<U+017F>tles Dedicatory bring in this into compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on:
but never was it better apply'd then by <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> when looking up towards the
Sun, it made him <U+017F>neeze.</p>
               <p>For the <U+017F>tone <hi>Panthura,</hi> I <U+017F>hall note this, That it is a trivial learning to bring
compari<U+017F>ons from <U+017F>tones, fi<U+017F>hes, herbs, birds, and other as intertain things, which
<pb facs="tcp:43725:9"/>

entertain them much with the<U+017F>e <U+017F>imilitudes, whereas a man would think, that it
were more convincing, to draw them from <U+017F>omewhat familiar to them. The Author
of the <hi>Abridgement of Long-<U+017F>tudities,</hi> was a cheat, and fit to be <hi>Carmelins</hi>

                  <hi>Fontenay</hi> is a true French name, and there have been Lacqueys called <hi>Gringalet</hi>

taken her plea<U+017F>ure with <hi>Cephalus</hi> on earth. Why do not the Poets clear up the<U+017F>e
things to us? <hi>Virgil</hi> <U+017F>ayes in one place, that the Chariot of this Godde<U+017F>s is drawn
by four hor<U+017F>es, and in another by two; <U+017F>ometimes they are white, <U+017F>ometimes red,

               <p>He that con<U+017F>iders his farewels to his friends upon his Metamorpho<U+017F>is, and hath
read <hi>Ovid,</hi> may judge whether were the madder of the two. But that which he <U+017F>ays

nothing can be added: For either what he <U+017F>ays mu<U+017F>t be true, or el<U+017F>e when the Gods
were minded to metamorpho<U+017F>e any, they mu<U+017F>t bid them put off their cloaths fir<U+017F>t,
or <U+017F>hould do it for them; which, what an ab<U+017F>urdity it is, I leave any man to
judge.</p>
               <p>Nay, <U+017F>uch was the blindne<U+017F>s of the Ancients, that they believ'd the Trees of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona</hi>
<U+017F>pake: but we are to believe there never <U+017F>pake any Tree in this world, unle<U+017F>s

what <U+017F>hall befall them<U+017F>elves.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Clarimond's</hi> <U+017F>ubtilty to make him take <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>tenance, 'tis admirable.
But for the exerci<U+017F>es and recreations of the <hi>Nymphs</hi> and <hi>rural</hi> Divinities, I might
produce whole Odes out of <hi>Des Portes</hi> and <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard,</hi> to acquaint you what they were;
but take upon my credit, they are <U+017F>uch as our Shepherd meets with. For their names,
it may be 'twill not be ungratefull to rip up <U+017F>o much ancient <U+017F>otti<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s. They had
<hi>Dryads,</hi> whom I take to be Nymphs of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts; Hamadryads</hi> were <U+017F>uch men as
were chang'd into <hi>Trees;</hi> the <hi>Nayads</hi> were the Nymphs that pre<U+017F>ided over the
<hi>Waters,</hi> and were <U+017F>uch as had been chang'd into <hi>Fountains;</hi> the <hi>Napaeae</hi> are the
Nymphs of the Flowers, the <hi>Oreades</hi> of the Mountains, and the <hi>Nereides</hi> of the
Sea.</p>
               <p>I do not tell you what part of <hi>Brie Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was in, nor where the River <hi>Morin</hi>
begins; 'tis an humour of <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard's,</hi> to make a long comment on every proper
name, which I will not imitate.</p>
               <p>As for the Fable of <hi>Morin,</hi> I maintain it to be much more ingenious then any
thing of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s, or any other Poet.</p>
               <p>Tho<U+017F>e things which we bring in under the name of <hi>Hi<U+017F>tories,</hi> are <hi>Fables.</hi> Among
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the word <hi>Fable</hi> was re<U+017F>train'd to tho<U+017F>e relations that concerned the
<hi>Gods; Hi<U+017F>tory,</hi> to the affairs of <hi>men:</hi> But becau<U+017F>e a Fable <U+017F>ignifies only a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that what they <U+017F>aid of their Gods was fal<U+017F>e, it is come to pa<U+017F>s that a Fable
<U+017F>ignifies that which is fal<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>As for the Stories of <hi>Synopa</hi> and <hi>Lucida,</hi> and their <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es,</hi> they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
and probable: whereas the Poets can only tells us, that to be metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd
into Water, there was no other invention then to weep away, as <hi>Ovid</hi> <U+017F>ays
of <hi>Biblis.</hi> But where <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> takes away that contrariety of being chang'd into water,
and yet retaining the form of a humane body, which mu<U+017F>t be compos'd of watery
vapours, he <U+017F>hews nothing e<U+017F>capes him. He had read <U+017F>omewhere what the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
<U+017F>ay of the apparition of Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Terre<U+017F>trial <U+017F>pirits a<U+017F><U+017F>ume bodies
of the vapours of the earth, and the Aquatick of tho<U+017F>e of the water.</p>

What follows concerning the <hi>Violin,</hi> and the Nymphs who deny'd <hi>Diana</hi> the
Sweet-meats, all is natural, and their puni<U+017F>hment too. For the latter, certainly 'tis
as ea<U+017F>ie for the Gods to make Trees bear fruit pre<U+017F>erv'd, as to change men into
Trees: And if my Author had <U+017F>aid that the Cypre<U+017F>s into which the Violin was
chang'd, bore Fiddles and Violins ready made, it had been as probable. The<U+017F>e <U+017F>tories
we are beholding to <hi>Clarimond</hi> for; who <U+017F>eeing the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets had invented <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorpho<U+017F>es</hi>
for the <hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Rivers</hi> of their Country, would do the like to the
honour of <hi>Brie:</hi> but the truth is, he is gone far beyond them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carmelin</hi>'s Que<U+017F>tions to his Ma<U+017F>ter, give him occa<U+017F>ion to clear up the ancient
Fables, wherein 'tis wonderfull to <U+017F>ee how well he is read.</p>
               <p>I know not whether the Gum of the Tree <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> be well taken; yet 'twas a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity
could not be omitted: His mind ran then upon <hi>Myrrha,</hi> and the Si<U+017F>ters of

Argenis</hi> is as bad, upon which too there is an Ode.</p>
               <p>At the <U+017F>econd rencontre with the Rural Divinities, I note <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s abu<U+017F>e of the
<hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Nymphs</hi> for offering to run away for fear of mortals. The Ancients
might have made that que<U+017F>tion to tho<U+017F>e that talk'd of <U+017F>o many Gods, which no
man could ever perceive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carmelin's</hi> <U+017F>peech to the Nymphs is nothing but a <U+017F>ort of contradictions. <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ard</hi>
and other Poets have thought them mighty ornaments; for <hi>Carmelin</hi> is one
that in this ca<U+017F>e is no Author, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you.</p>
               <p>I do not ob<U+017F>erve <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s reading fail him, till I come to the bathing of <hi>Carmelin:</hi>
And I wonder at it; for <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> could have taught him what ceremonies were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to make a Mortal fit for a cele<U+017F>tial conver<U+017F>ation. He had forgot that the
Ancients wa<U+017F>h'd them<U+017F>elves before they con<U+017F>ulted the Oracle, as al<U+017F>o the Victims
when they <U+017F>acrificed; and that Magicians bathe them<U+017F>elves in running-water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they fall to their conjurations.</p>
               <p>Certainly <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> mu<U+017F>t needs be troubled not to find his Tree; yet mu<U+017F>t he needs
play the Tree, till <hi>Hircan,</hi> with the help of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> conjur'd him into a Man again
The apparition of the Winds hath nothing in it fanta<U+017F>tick, compar'd with what the
Poets <U+017F>ay of them. That <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> believ'd <hi>Hircan</hi> more powerfull then the Gods, it
<U+017F>hews him to be of the Creed of the Ancients, who believed the Gods were <U+017F>ubject
to the charms of Magicians; and that when the Moon was ecclips'd, it was <U+017F>ome
Sorcere<U+017F>s had forc'd her from heaven.</p>

it were in the heart of his <U+017F>ummer. But at length he mu<U+017F>t conclude all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in <hi>Celantes,</hi> for he mu<U+017F>t conceal all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Logick</hi> being attained, he brings him into the eight books of <hi>Phy<U+017F>icks,</hi> <U+017F>hewing
him fir<U+017F>t the three natural Principles; which are, the <hi>matter</hi> of the Lovers faith,
the <hi>form</hi> of the Beloveds vertues, and the <hi>privation</hi> of the <U+017F>atisfactions of Love.
This done, he advances to the <U+017F>econd Book, which treats of the four <hi>cau<U+017F>es</hi> of
his <hi>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion;</hi> the <hi>material,</hi> which is no other then his own natural inclination; the
<hi>formal;</hi> an enflam'd de<U+017F>ire of the thing loved; the <hi>efficient,</hi> the attractions, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and goodne<U+017F>s of the Beloved I and the <hi>final,</hi> her vertue and her honor.
Out of this he pa<U+017F><U+017F>es into the third, which treats of the <hi>perpetual motion</hi> of the
Lovers <hi>heart,</hi> by which it moves, <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>uddenly to the <U+017F>ervice of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>lowly as it were from enjoyment to privation, from joy to
<U+017F>adne<U+017F>s, and from re<U+017F>t to labour. This done, he <U+017F>teps into the fourth, where he
<U+017F>hews him the <hi>infinitum</hi> of his <U+017F>ufferings, the <hi>concentrick</hi> place where his heart
ought to be; that is, the Beloved: the <hi>vacuum</hi> of his <U+017F>onl exhau<U+017F>ted of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures,
and the <hi>time</hi> of his affection, which is perpetual. This being di<U+017F>patch'd, this
excellent Doctor leads him into the fifth book, which treats of the <hi>generation</hi> of his
noble and generous thoughts, his cha<U+017F>te intentions, and his hone<U+017F>t de<U+017F>igns, and
the <hi>corruption</hi> of all his impure de<U+017F>ires, and irregular affections. Thence does he
bring him to under<U+017F>tand the nature of <hi>mixt</hi> bodies, which are the matter of the
<U+017F>ixth book, where he learns what cau<U+017F>es the piercing <hi>thunder</hi> of his complaints,
the interlaced <hi>clouds</hi> of the <hi>vapours</hi> of his <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s; the blu<U+017F>tering <hi>winds</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<U+017F>ts</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43725:11"/>
of his <U+017F>ighs, and the plentiful <hi><U+017F>howers</hi> and <hi>dews</hi> of his Tears. Thence he
advances to the <U+017F>eventh book, where he findes that the <hi>earth</hi> is nothing el<U+017F>e but
his con<U+017F>tancy. The <hi>water</hi> his tears, the <hi>ayr</hi> his <U+017F>ighs, and the <hi>fire</hi> his de<U+017F>ires;
the <hi>Moon,</hi> his want of <hi>Re<U+017F>olution, Mercury</hi> his enchanting Remon<U+017F>trances and
Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, <hi>Venus</hi> his milde Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, the <hi>Sun</hi> his Vertue, <hi>Mars</hi> his Courage,
<hi>Jupiter</hi> his Di<U+017F>cretion, <hi>Saturn</hi> his Judgement; the <hi>Firmament</hi> his Con<U+017F>tancy, the
<hi>Empyraean</hi> Heaven, the Purity of his affection, and the <hi>primum mobile</hi> his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
love. And la<U+017F>tly, he fini<U+017F>hes his cour<U+017F>e of Phy<U+017F>icks<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> with the eight Book,
where he contemplates the excellency of a <U+017F>oul that's perfectly <hi>loved</hi> with a noble
and con<U+017F>ummate affection.</p>
                  <p>When the Lover is become a good Philo<U+017F>opher, Love in<U+017F>tructs him in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks:</hi>
fir<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hews him <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> and the four principal parts of it;
that is to <U+017F>ay, the <hi>Addition</hi> of pre<U+017F>ent to pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ufferings, the <hi>Sub<U+017F>traction</hi> of di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hone<U+017F>t
entertainments, the <hi>Divi<U+017F>ion</hi> of his complyant minde from it <U+017F>elf, and the

very frequent, and very <U+017F>weet, <hi><U+017F>harpes</hi> there are none at all. When he is Ma<U+017F>ter

               <p>Now do I think I have oblig'd two <U+017F>orts of people, the judicious, by furni<U+017F>hing
them with matter of <U+017F>port, and the weak with matter of entertainment. Be<U+017F>ides

take it for an <hi>Encuclopaedia,</hi> for it will mightily rub up their memories. But I
pray what is there in all this, which a man would not deci<U+017F>ively attribute to a
<hi>Grammarian</hi> or a Pedant? yet the Author is very <U+017F>erious in it. There is another

he is equally Ma<U+017F>ter of them as the other.</p>

hath <U+017F>ufficiently ripp'd up the<U+017F>e ab<U+017F>urdities. But it were enough to confute

                  <hi>Clarimond</hi> with much rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>tudies the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Fables,</hi> <U+017F>ince we mu<U+017F>t be

               </p>
               <p>The next thing is the indi<U+017F>creet curio<U+017F>ity of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> in opening the Box wherein
he thought the <hi>Eccho</hi> was; but his comparing him<U+017F>elf to <hi>Pandora, Aglaura,</hi> and

               <p>
                  <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s conformities are very remarkable, yet he wants not pre<U+017F>idents; for they

But I cannot but take notice of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s inventions in the Metamorpho<U+017F>is, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
his judgment far beyond the Poets; for they never give any rea<U+017F>on of their
Metamorpho<U+017F>es, it being the mo<U+017F>t ab<U+017F>urd thing in the world to advance things, even
in fictions, which defie probability. As for example, <hi>Polyphemus</hi> being jealous to
have <U+017F>een <hi>Acis</hi> with <hi>Galathea,</hi> ca<U+017F>t a great piece of a Rock at him, with which he
was forc'd into the ground; but his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s and the Nymphs chang'd him into a
River. Should they not rather have <U+017F>uccour'd him? But now I had rather <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
a man chang'd into water by an extraordinary <U+017F>weat, through <U+017F>ome violent
exerci<U+017F>e or <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, or by di<U+017F>tillation. Yet <hi>Carmelin</hi> unacquainted with the Poets,
cannot <U+017F>wallow that Metamorpho<U+017F>is; for <hi>Des Portes</hi> would have taught him, that
the teares of a <hi>Poet</hi> are a certain water di<U+017F>till'd from the Ro<U+017F>es, Lilies, and other
flowers of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es beauty; his Love is the fire, his Heart the furnace, and
his Eye the beak of the Alambick, and his Sighs are the bellows. I think <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s
propo<U+017F>ition to <hi>Carmelin</hi> is not more extravagant then what this Poet <U+017F>ays; only
I think fit <hi>Carmelin's</hi> no<U+017F>e be the beak of the Alambick, that <U+017F>o the water may be
pre<U+017F>erved for the u<U+017F>e of decay'd Ladies.</p>
               <p>I hope the Poets will pardon <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s cour<U+017F>e to multiply <hi>Carmelin</hi>'s water. <hi>Ocyro</hi>
was chang'd into a <hi>Mare,</hi> for pre<U+017F>uming to be a <hi>Prophete<U+017F>s.</hi> This is impertinent
enough; for what relation is there between a <hi>Prophete<U+017F>s</hi> and a <hi>Mare?</hi> But that the
hinder part of her gown <U+017F>hould be chang'd into a tail, is yet more: I wonder, if
<U+017F>he had had no cloaths on, whether <U+017F>he had been without a tail. Therefore I think
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>imple as he is, more di<U+017F>creet then all the Poets: for where his Ma<U+017F>ter
tels him, that when he is chang'd into water, he <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee the Divinities naked, he
asks where will be his eyes and other members? Hone<U+017F>t <hi>Ovid</hi> <U+017F>ayes, that <hi>Cyana</hi>
being to relate to <hi>Ceres</hi> the carrying away of her daughter, could not do it, becau<U+017F>e
being chang'd into water, <U+017F>he had neither tongue nor mouth. And yet in the next
fable, <hi>Arethu<U+017F>a</hi> who had run the <U+017F>ame fortune, lifted up her head above her waves,
and related all her ancient adventures. This is enough to <U+017F>hew how far the Poets
pre<U+017F>ume upon the ignorance of the people, who mu<U+017F>t receive what they bring, be
it ever <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>urd.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s rural <hi>Temple,</hi> which he would build to <hi>Charite, Des Portes</hi> will
needs build one for his Godde<U+017F>s; where his Eye <U+017F>hall be the Lamp, his Body the
Altar, his Sighs his Vows, and he will <U+017F>ing a daily office: provided his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
gave him a good fat Par<U+017F>onage; for this Poet was a benefie'd man. His avarice

a <hi>Souldier</hi> having a head-piece and boots and <U+017F>purs on, may be chang'd into a <hi>Cock.</hi>
But <hi>Ovid</hi> troubled not him<U+017F>elf with any con<U+017F>ideration of probability.</p>
               <p>The Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Fontenay</hi> hath much conduct and judgment in it. As for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
I <U+017F>hall not comment on them: It repre<U+017F>ents a <U+017F>ort of old Romances, which
brought Magicians, Sorcere<U+017F><U+017F>es, and their Miracles on the Stage, but without that
probability which <hi>Fontenay</hi> ob<U+017F>erves. As for in<U+017F>tance, that he lov'd him<U+017F>elf, he
gives you this rea<U+017F>on, that he was of a <U+017F>olitary and melancholick di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, and
'tis withall natural for <U+017F>uch a Complexion to con<U+017F>ult Sorceries.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s changing his place, to receive the ayr which came from <hi>Charite,</hi> 'tis
neither too amorous, nor too poetick: I <U+017F>hall quote but one authority, and that

but being at the utmo<U+017F>t of de<U+017F>pair for him, there comes into the Town a certain
German that was very like him. <hi>Catulla</hi> having heard of it, <U+017F>ends her woman to
give him directions how to come to her in the night, which was by the help of a
ladder of cord. He, though a <U+017F>tranger, yet perceiving the mi<U+017F>take, would needs
tru<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf to Fortune; but going at his hour appointed, he meets the Watch,
draws on them; and after he had kill'd two, was taken and carried to pri<U+017F>on, and
the next day condemn'd. <hi>Catulla</hi> hearing of this, knew there was no way to
<U+017F>ave him but to beg him, which <U+017F>he did by her maid. This was a notable re<U+017F>emblance,
that could not be di<U+017F>covered all the time: But that which put me on this <U+017F>tory is,
that cu<U+017F>tom of begging condemn'd per<U+017F>ons: 'Twas a priviledge of common whores,
who upon promi<U+017F>e of amendment of life, had <U+017F>uch as were de<U+017F>tin'd to the gallows

For the littlene<U+017F>s of his Ma<U+017F>ter, you mu<U+017F>t note, that the Poets de<U+017F>cribing a thing,
ob<U+017F>erve le<U+017F>s probability; el<U+017F>e what meant he that <U+017F>aid, That a little man having
gotten up on the back of a Pi<U+017F>mire, thought him<U+017F>elf upon an Elephant, but on a
<U+017F>udden got a fall from it as high as that of <hi>Phaeton.</hi> For <hi>Taupins</hi> changing his
name, and thinking to grow bigger with it, <hi>Carmelin</hi> had read <U+017F>ome <hi>Romance,</hi> where
he found a Gyant called <hi>Nagibu<U+017F>cantropocara,</hi> a name proportionable to his body.
There was a certain Roman, who be<U+017F>ides the making of his cloathes too big, as
<hi>Taupin</hi> did, would not eat of any <U+017F>mall creature, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould make him little like
what he eat, and that made him love Beef better then Partridge. His <U+017F>auce was
<pb facs="tcp:43725:14"/>
made of <hi>Pompions,</hi> but for Pea<U+017F>e and beans he could not endure the <U+017F>ight of them.

who<U+017F>e heroick vertue is rendred more illu<U+017F>trious by the glory of his vertues,
then by the antiquity of his race, &amp;c.</hi> Methinks the Epithets here are very cheap,
what need a mans valour come in to tell us of his <U+017F>on: but that word <hi>Flouri<U+017F>hing</hi>
troubled <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> mo<U+017F>t; 'tis <U+017F>o like the Legend, for alas he was afraid that for that word

               <p>
                  <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> believes <hi>Hircan</hi> took off the beards of the Gods of the waters; how

been Swi<U+017F><U+017F>ers; after which came up the Canon and Artillery, which was guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <U+017F>everal Regiments of <hi>Fro<U+017F>ts, Rains, Hail</hi> and <hi>Snow,</hi> with Scaling Ladders,
and Bridges of <hi>Ice.</hi> That three hours after they di<U+017F>covered a Squadrons of <hi>Fogs,</hi>
all in di<U+017F>order, and led up by the Amazon <hi>Cold,</hi> which was follow'd by the main
battel of General <hi>Winter,</hi> who had four Legions of Flakes of <hi>Ice</hi> had pre<U+017F>t the
<hi>frigid Zone,</hi> and all old and grey <hi>Travellers,</hi> who had provi<U+017F>ion for five months
and odde days; and that the<U+017F>e forces had quite routed <hi>Autumn.</hi> General <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
was not much troubled at this news, who thought it his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to joyn
battel with his enemy before his forces were refre<U+017F>h'd. While he was thus bu<U+017F>ie,
a <hi>Page</hi> comes from <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> and tells him he had there <U+017F>een two or three
Gentlewomen get green gowns, which made him believe that <hi>Winter</hi> could not
be <U+017F>o near. Whereupon he giving him<U+017F>elf over to <U+017F>ome little enjoyment. <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
advances with <U+017F>ome Troops of <hi>Hoar-Fro<U+017F>ts,</hi> which made <hi>Summer</hi> retreat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his works: Some days were thus <U+017F>pent in skirmi<U+017F>hes to no great advantage of
either <U+017F>ide; for what the <hi>Hoar-fro<U+017F>ts</hi> did in the morning, Captain <hi>Phoebus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
at noon. But <hi>Winter</hi> brought up all his forces, and took the works, and
froze the hearts of the hotte<U+017F>t Champions among them. <hi>Summer</hi> in the mean
time rallies, and brings on the rays of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> which were come to his <U+017F>uccor
from the high Countrey; but <hi>Winter</hi> had <U+017F>et a <U+017F>ort of good re<U+017F>olute <hi>Fogs</hi> all
about, who a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as they perceiv'd the rays, ri<U+017F>e up and gave alarm, having let
Captain <hi>Ayr</hi> pa<U+017F>s their guards. The <U+017F>ignal of the Battel was a <hi>Blu<U+017F>tering wind</hi>
on the one <U+017F>ide, and on the other <hi>Thunder.</hi> The Battel being joyn'd, <hi>Phoebus</hi>
would needs <U+017F>uccor the <hi>Summer,</hi> but the <hi>Mi<U+017F>ts</hi> being of the other <U+017F>ide, came and
cover'd both Armies, <U+017F>o that he could not <U+017F>ee them. The Duke of <hi>November</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43725:14"/>
would needs with a <U+017F>elect troop of <hi>Fair days</hi> reinforce the fight; but the Earl
of <hi>Shrove-Tue<U+017F>day</hi> came with a drunken de<U+017F>perate crue, and took him off. <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
<U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf put to the rout, fought <U+017F>toutly; but at la<U+017F>t was forc'd to flie to

               <p>This <U+017F>eems plea<U+017F>ant enough; and there is another fight between the <hi>Fle<U+017F>h-days</hi>
and <hi>Fi<U+017F>h-days,</hi> but it is too long for this place: but for this, I think it is much
more ingenious then <hi>Homers</hi> between the <hi>Mice</hi> and the <hi>Frogs.</hi> For what difference
could happen between two <U+017F>orts of Creatures, that had no acquaintance one with
another? one living in the water, the other in warm holes in hou<U+017F>es. That humor
of arraigning <hi>Banquet</hi> of certain crimes of <hi>Drunkenne<U+017F>s, Qnarrels</hi> and <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and referring her to the puni<U+017F>hment of <hi>Famine,</hi> was not much better in our

               <p>But <hi>Hircan</hi>'s Prophe<U+017F>ie a<U+017F><U+017F>ures him as to the taking of arms; there are two or

               <p>Nor is that humor of his, of having a <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Romances</hi> le<U+017F>s plea<U+017F>ant; but what

<hi>Homer</hi> <U+017F>ays of it.</p>
               <p>But the de<U+017F>ign of the Plays is that which is incomparable; as well for the di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition
of the Scene as the Language: To rip up the Fables which they propo<U+017F>e to
act, were to be too tedious; as for the lights which <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>aw, he <U+017F>ays nothing
which the vulgar opinion confirms not, whether they proceed from natural cau<U+017F>es
or diabolick, matters not here. In <hi>Euphormio</hi> you may know <U+017F>omewhat more
of them; the Author of that Satyr tells you they call Travellers to them, and
that <hi>Euphormio,</hi> with his friend <hi>Percas,</hi> going by a river <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>aw a man with a great
head of hair, and a great Beard, who was <U+017F>een to the navil, and that he turned
<pb facs="tcp:43725:15"/>
up his buttocks, and clapped him<U+017F>elf; which done, he laughed, and went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
water again.</p>
               <p>As for the Players habits, <hi>Black</hi> is the colour of <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Kingdom; <hi>Jupiters</hi> red
is the colour of his Thunder; <hi>Venus</hi>'s green is the colour of the Spring, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ents
Love; <hi>Ceres</hi>'s yellow is the colour of her harve<U+017F>ts. <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina</hi>'s blew is
the ordinary colour of maids to be married; and for <hi>Cyana</hi> and <hi>Arethu<U+017F>a,</hi> white
repre<U+017F>ents the <U+017F>ilver of their <U+017F>treams. But for <hi>Cupids</hi> being naked, with his Bow
and Arrow, as the Poets paint him, there is <U+017F>omewhat to be <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t it.
When he would <U+017F>hoot at one, what does he with his torch? doth he let it fall to
the ground? or does he put it out till he hath done, and then lights it again at the
eyes of <U+017F>ome Beauty? nor do I <U+017F>ee why he <U+017F>hould go naked in the cold; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I approve <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who being to repre<U+017F>ent him, would not for mode<U+017F>ty <U+017F>ake.
But it may be <U+017F>aid the enjoyments of it are naked: be it <U+017F>o.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> <U+017F>peaks by <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> yet not <U+017F>uch, but the Poets make them ordinary;
for to <U+017F>ay, that the beauties of a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s are able to make the Gods Idolatrous, is
much beyond any thing <U+017F>he <U+017F>aies. The di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es al<U+017F>o of <hi>Cupid</hi> are fit for <U+017F>uch a
per<U+017F>on, as the Poets make him: for his playing at Cockal, <U+017F>ince he is a childe, 'tis
natural; but pins are more proper for him, for 'tis his de<U+017F>ign to prick. Nor is <hi>Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>'s
loitering from <U+017F>chool ab<U+017F>urd, for you mu<U+017F>t note, <hi>Mercury</hi> taught the Gods
languages. While the <hi>Greeks</hi> <U+017F>tood, they <U+017F>poke all Greek, but when the Empire came
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Gods were fain to <U+017F>ubmit to the Latine tongue, otherwi<U+017F>e
they could not have convers'd with that people, nor an<U+017F>wer'd them by their
Oracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pluto</hi> hath taken the Pedantick <U+017F>tile, which is the mo<U+017F>t proper for a <U+017F>olitary God
as he is; and as this God pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing his time with the dead, mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>peak <U+017F>ome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Language; <U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e here who <U+017F>pend night and day in reading old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and never conver<U+017F>e with other men, furni<U+017F>h us with nothing but their Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
both in their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e and Books. For his mangling of the Latine words, he
may be ea<U+017F>ily under<U+017F>tood, as being not <U+017F>o ridiculou<U+017F>ly affected, as that of the <U+017F>chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in <hi>Rabelais;</hi> who <U+017F>ays he goes to the <hi>Lupanar</hi> in<U+017F>tead of a Bawdy-hou<U+017F>e, and
transfrets the <hi>Sequane.</hi> But <hi>Rabelais</hi> needed not have abus'd others in this point, for
his own ordinary <U+017F>tile is Pedantick enough.</p>
               <p>The Rencontre of <hi>Adrian</hi> ju<U+017F>t in this nick of time, mu<U+017F>t needs be very plea<U+017F>ant;
and his bidding the company adieu, and the Waggoner drive on both in a breath,
<U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>peak his quality.</p>
               <p>But the next Comedy is much more perfect, as being not interrupted. <hi>Zethes</hi>
and <hi>Calais</hi> <U+017F>peak the ordinary phra<U+017F>e, as being yong men; but <hi>Ja<U+017F>on</hi> being a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
and better at his hands then at this tongue, can <U+017F>peak no other but <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathias,</hi>
a kinde of <U+017F>peech hath no name neither among the <hi>Greeks</hi> nor <hi>Latines,</hi>
as con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of contradictions, and clinches upon the words, and 'tis only the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
declares what it is. 'Tis a Language that much pe<U+017F>ters the Courtiers; you
have enough of it in the <hi>Loves</hi> of <hi>Nerueza,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Des E<U+017F>cuteaux,</hi> and in
<hi>Loves Alarms;</hi> and though the<U+017F>e Books are <U+017F>lighted now, yet were they excellent
in their time, and tho<U+017F>e that are now in vogue, will come to the <U+017F>ame fate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our</hi> Medea <hi>is all in</hi> Metaphors; <hi>a <U+017F>tile proper for a Sorcere<U+017F>s; he that compos'd
the Travels of</hi> Ari<U+017F>teus, <hi>was excellent at it.</hi> De<U+017F>pair <hi><U+017F>aies he,</hi> like a re<U+017F>olute War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
having laid <U+017F>iege to the heart of that Shepherde<U+017F>s with an Army of his <U+017F>uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
took in at length that fort of her <U+017F>oul, having at his entrance knock'd down that
inflexible courage, cut the throat of his patience, ma<U+017F><U+017F>acr'd his furious re<U+017F>olutions,
and precipitated tho<U+017F>e thoughts, which had e<U+017F>caped the fury of the <U+017F>word, into a fire
perpetually burning with a de<U+017F>ire of death. <hi>This Author was the only admiration
of the Court; but how de<U+017F>ervedly</hi>—</p>
               <p>But to return to our Comedy. <hi>Ja<U+017F>on</hi> de<U+017F>irous to obtain the <hi>Golden-Fleece,</hi> which
was a Book of <hi>Chymi<U+017F>try,</hi> as <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay, though the Fable bears other expo<U+017F>itions.
But the Poets know not where the <hi>Colchos</hi> was, for <U+017F>ome will have it to be an I<U+017F>land,
others a Continent; nay, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay, they knew not by what river the <hi>Argo</hi> got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:43725:15"/>
the <U+017F>ea. But that trouble, you will <U+017F>ay, <hi>Orpheus</hi> <U+017F>av'd them; for he could as well
draw after him their <U+017F>hip as other things with his Harp. But I wonder, that being
at <U+017F>ea, the Rocks follow'd them not: but it is to be thought they heard him not.
When this Mu<U+017F>ician de<U+017F>cended into hell, the <hi>Acheron</hi> followed him even to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of <hi>Pluto,</hi> <U+017F>o that the Shades were like to be drown'd in the mid<U+017F>t of the fires.
'Twas a brave fellow; for with one touch on the Harp he could draw the faire<U+017F>t
Trees from his neighbours garden into his own; and if he chang'd Country, he
could make his hou<U+017F>e follow him: And yet this was the mo<U+017F>t beggerly Poet that
ever was. But I wonder how the Sun and the Stars, being more excellent bodies
then the Stones Trees, were not charm'd by his mu<U+017F>ick. But to pur<U+017F>ue the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
When the <hi>Argonauts</hi> were arrived in the Country of King <hi>Phineas, Zethes</hi>
and <hi>Calais</hi> relieve him again<U+017F>t the Harpies. The<U+017F>e young men were the <U+017F>ons of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas</hi>
and the fair <hi>Orithia,</hi> and had the gift of flying. But why the Harpies <U+017F>hould
hinder King <hi>Phineas</hi> to eat, I <U+017F>ee not; nor yet how this poor King could live <U+017F>o
long without meat. But having done their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, the <hi>Argonauts</hi> pur<U+017F>ue their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
and <hi>Medea</hi> <U+017F>o favour'd <hi>Ja<U+017F>on,</hi> that <U+017F>he gave him a charm to<U+017F>et the Dragon
a<U+017F>leep. What a <U+017F>imple Conquerour is this <hi>Ja<U+017F>on,</hi> that does all things by magick?
The Dragon being a<U+017F>leep, 'twas ea<U+017F>ie to take the Fleece. And his Companions never
drew <U+017F>word till they came to <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>aly.</hi> Are not the<U+017F>e excellent examples of valour?
As for the language of <U+017F>ome Actors in this Comedy, it is enough to <U+017F>ay it is fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tick
as the re<U+017F>t. The<U+017F>e two pieces could not be better repre<U+017F>ented. <hi>Carmelin</hi> and
the <hi>Harpies</hi> did excellently well, nor did <hi>Hircan</hi> who playd <hi>Orpheus</hi> do le<U+017F>s. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
if any of the Country chanc'd to <U+017F>ee them, they mu<U+017F>t needs think them mad:
but they had <U+017F>uch a lechery to make <U+017F>port with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that they cared not; and
therefore being <U+017F>atisfied with this diver<U+017F>ion, they find him other adventures in the</p>

               <head>Tenth BOOK.</head>
               <p>I Cannot but admire <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s reading and his judgment in the old Authors. His
attaque of the Fable of <hi>Thetis</hi> is excellent; but his heroick accoutrements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
him again: But that was becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome Poets even of his own time
<U+017F>o dre<U+017F>s'd before their Books. That <U+017F>ubtilty of <hi>Hircan,</hi> to make <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> believe that
the Coach was drawn by hor<U+017F>es as long as it was on firm ground, and did not flie
till it came to the <U+017F>ea, was not ordinary: but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> helps it by his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophie.</p>
               <p>But what he intends to do in heaven, is beyond all A<U+017F>trologie, and di<U+017F>covers the
Tenets of divers Philo<U+017F>ophers, and e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Platonicks</hi> concerning
<hi>Remini<U+017F>cence;</hi> and that was it made <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> believe there mu<U+017F>t be an Univer<U+017F>ity in
heaven for the <U+017F>ouls. After he hath <U+017F>poken of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Tuns of Good and Evil, he
falls afre<U+017F>h on the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> as if they had been things to be <U+017F>een
in heaven. Nor is his holding of <hi><U+017F>olution</hi> of <hi>continuity</hi> in <U+017F>pirits le<U+017F>s Philo<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical.</p>
               <p>The adventure of the Dragon <U+017F>hews how ea<U+017F>ie it is to deceive him that deceives
him<U+017F>elf. But for the things that come out of the Dragons belly, they are not <U+017F>o
<U+017F>trange as what comes from a Gentleman in the Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander,</hi> that vomited
images of wax, pieces of Looking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, Pen-knives and Ink-horns.</p>
               <p>The Deliverance of <hi>Pamphilia</hi> mu<U+017F>t needs be a great honour to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and <U+017F>uch as
mu<U+017F>t make him <hi>heroick.</hi> But his relation of his adventure is excellent. Becau<U+017F>e he had
<U+017F>een Birds that could <U+017F>peak at <hi>Paris,</hi> he thought there might be a Country whence
they came, and where they <U+017F>poke and did all things as we do. But this, and what he
<U+017F>ays of the <hi>Diaphonous</hi> people, is but a dream of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> yet not <U+017F>o impertinent as that
of <hi>Poliphilus,</hi> who in one night dreamt a book as big as ours.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s imagination, that being invulnerable, the Gyants could not force
<pb facs="tcp:43725:16"/>
out his <U+017F>oul but through the no<U+017F>e, 'tis an abu<U+017F>e of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who in his <hi>Alcoran</hi> <U+017F>ays
that <hi>Mo<U+017F>es</hi> having long wandered the de<U+017F>art, found a Tomb, whereof as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidering
the length and breadth, the Angel of death came to kill him: <hi>Mo<U+017F>es</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, How wilt thou get my <U+017F>oul out? <U+017F>ays he to him: Not through my mouth,
for that hath <U+017F>poke to God; not through my ears, for tho<U+017F>e have heard him; not
through my eyes, for tho<U+017F>e have <U+017F>een him; not by my hands, for tho<U+017F>e have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
pre<U+017F>ents from him; not through my feet, for tho<U+017F>e carried me into the Mount.
The Angel went his way thus baffled: but another time he pre<U+017F>ented <hi>Mo<U+017F>es</hi> with an
Apple of Paradice; which he <U+017F>melling at, the Angel took him by the no<U+017F>e and drew
out his <U+017F>oul, &amp; <U+017F>o di<U+017F>pos'd him into that Sepulchre which could never <U+017F>ince be found.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> will be accoutred according to his Authors, he <U+017F>till di<U+017F>covers his old
humour, that makes him believe there's as much truth in Picture as in Poetry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarimond's</hi> abu<U+017F>ing of tho<U+017F>e Shepherds that grave their amorous <U+017F>peeches and
expo<U+017F>tulations on Trees, is not without rea<U+017F>on, 'tis <U+017F>uch an impertinent and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
foolery: For they mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>end notice to their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es to go to that tree,
or all's lo<U+017F>t; which if they do, they might as well have <U+017F>ent what they writ on the
tree <U+017F>ome other way.</p>
               <p>The hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Anaximander</hi> may well go for canonical with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> He had <U+017F>een
in the fables, that <hi>Medea</hi> had taken <hi>Ae<U+017F>on</hi> by the throat, and let out all his old
blood, and fill'd his body with other, by which means he became young again. Nor
want our pre<U+017F>ent Romances the<U+017F>e renewings of age. <hi>Panurgus</hi> had his body mine'd,
as if it had been to be put into pa<U+017F>te; which done, it was molded anew, and made
hand<U+017F>ome then before, and they got life into him by blowing into his fundament.
Then does he relate <U+017F>tories of the other world. But if there be any wit in things of
this nature, 'tis <hi>Anaximander</hi> claims it. As for the God of <hi>Sleep,</hi> whom <hi>Clarimond</hi>
quotes, 'tis to keep even with the fables. Some grant this God a palace, <U+017F>ome a grot.
But to what purpo<U+017F>e either; <U+017F>ince all that are about him mu<U+017F>t be a<U+017F>leep, and cannot
do this Child of the night any <U+017F>ervice? And <U+017F>ince <hi>Ovid</hi> <U+017F>ays he is ever a<U+017F>leep, how
can he go about the earth to <U+017F>ow <hi>poppies?</hi> That's a task for the God of <hi>Vigilance</hi>
rather then the God of <hi>Sleep.</hi> Thus <U+017F>hall we never be rid of ab<U+017F>urdities.</p>
               <p>The in<U+017F>tructions which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> gives to his Hi<U+017F>toriographer, are certainly very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent:
but the new de<U+017F>cription of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es Picture is much more. <hi>La Roque</hi>
was a fool to him; for he <U+017F>ays only that he is a new kind of <hi>Spider,</hi> that makes a
web whereon Love <U+017F>hould work his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es picture, but how he tels us not,
whereas <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> de<U+017F>cribes his to the lea<U+017F>t particulars. As for the Copper-piece, you
<U+017F>ee 'twas all was left of the brazen age. For the gold into which <hi>Midas</hi>'s wine was
turn'd, why might not <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> think it might be made potable again, with the help of
the Chymi<U+017F>ts who have broke their heads <U+017F>o much about it? The white mu<U+017F>t be
made of the <U+017F>ame milk which made the <hi>via lactea;</hi> which though not very white,
yet might <U+017F>erve <hi>Charite</hi> well enough. The fle<U+017F>h-colour taken from the <U+017F>weat of
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> is a new invention; and <U+017F>o is the red that is borrowed from Autumn.
The black is <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina's</hi> Paint, yet may do well enough for an Eye-brow. The
Poets who have made <U+017F>uch mon<U+017F>ters of the Gods, have made <hi>Neptune</hi> always with a
blue beard. For the marble whereon the Colours were wrought, it mu<U+017F>t needs be a
peece of the fir<U+017F>t Altar that was erected to tho<U+017F>e Gods whom <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> honours <U+017F>o much.
<hi>Venus</hi>'s <U+017F>hell was that wherein <U+017F>he arriv'd at <hi>Cyprus;</hi> and <hi>Lada's</hi> egg was that out
of which <hi>Helen, Ca<U+017F>tor,</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> were hatch'd.</p>
               <p>That I have not altogether ob<U+017F>erv'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s directions for the titles of his Letters
and the Hi<U+017F>tories, is becau<U+017F>e I would not in <U+017F>uch a punctilio tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F>s the laws of
our <hi>Romances.</hi> But his ob<U+017F>ervation is never the le<U+017F>s commendable.</p>
               <p>As for him that would dedicate a Romance of Knighthood to <hi>Bethlem-Gabor,</hi> 'tis
a Satyre, he being a mo<U+017F>t warlike Prince: And where 'tis <U+017F>aid he <U+017F>hould have a
Love-<U+017F>tory dedicated to him to teach him to court his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, <hi>Germany</hi> and the
<hi>State of Venice,</hi> I may add, that he hath ever been in love with the <hi>Ocean,</hi> which he
enjoys more then tho<U+017F>e other Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es; and that if tho<U+017F>e old Cuckolds of <hi>Venice</hi>

As for that Raillery concerning the attribute of <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty</hi> to <hi>Kings,</hi> be<U+017F>ides that
it is but of late, and that Court-flattery hath brought it into vogue; con<U+017F>idered

weakne<U+017F>s that cannot fa<U+017F>ten things more hand<U+017F>omly together.</p>
               <p>That Triumph wherein <hi>Carmelin</hi> repre<U+017F>ents <hi>Bacchus,</hi> is like that which the Poets
celebrate him for, who <U+017F>ay he was the fir<U+017F>t conquered the <hi>Indies:</hi> but his greate<U+017F>t
glory was, that all his voyage he <U+017F>corn'd to drink water. But that which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
at in this Ceremony, is, that the old cu<U+017F>toms are not punctually ob<U+017F>erv'd;
which he would not have violated, not only in this, but al<U+017F>o in all other things, as
his Triumph, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But I cannot but hug that de<U+017F>ign of his of <U+017F>ending for the <hi>Mu<U+017F>es.</hi> For their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
you mu<U+017F>t note there were at fir<U+017F>t but <hi>three,</hi> but how they came to be <hi>nine</hi> I'll
tell you. The people of <hi>Sicyon</hi> de<U+017F>irous to have their Statues to place in <hi>Apollo</hi>'s
Temple, employed about it three Statuaries, thinking to choo<U+017F>e the three be<U+017F>t done:
but it happened they were <U+017F>o well, that they knew not whhich to refu<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o they
were all nine con<U+017F>ecrated in the Temple of the God of Poetry; and to make the
people believe there were really nine, <hi>He<U+017F>iod</hi> and a <U+017F>ort of Poets found them all
names. For their <hi>cha<U+017F>tity,</hi> it cannot be much, <U+017F>ince they have in<U+017F>pired all the la<U+017F>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Poets that ever have been. But that Fable of their <hi>Fountain</hi> made by a hor<U+017F>es

for what vertue can there be in a Bea<U+017F>t to make men Poets? It had been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to <U+017F>ay, that tho<U+017F>e who drank of that fountain became hor<U+017F>es, or rather
a<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s carrying away of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, 'tis an ordinary Romantick humour.
Young Wenches run away and wander forre<U+017F>ts and de<U+017F>arts with their Lovers, as
if they were brothers and <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters, yet mu<U+017F>t be thought hone<U+017F>t, nay though they fall
into the hands of robbers and pyrats. But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would not have Lovers live like
<hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno. Natalis Comes</hi> tels us how <hi>Jupiter</hi> came to lie with this <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter of
his the fir<U+017F>t time: He chang'd him<U+017F>elf into a <hi>Cuckow,</hi> and it being a great <U+017F>howre
<pb facs="tcp:43725:17"/>
of rain, fled into <hi>Juno's</hi> lap; but <U+017F>he hiding him under her coats, he in the mean
time got her with childe, and could not but for <U+017F>hame marry her. 'Tis true,
<hi>Jupiter</hi> might very well be a <hi>Cuckow,</hi> for he was always in <U+017F>ome other birds
ne<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> di<U+017F>covers a mo<U+017F>t ridiculous humor of the Romances, where you have
a <U+017F>illy young girl, that haply was never out of her mothers <U+017F>ight, upon the fir<U+017F>t
of a Lover, become <U+017F>o bold, that <U+017F>he will travel all over the world with him; and
in all the<U+017F>e travels, there mu<U+017F>t be tho<U+017F>e that will infallibly entertain them, as if they
had planted their <U+017F>tages beforehand; and if they build Sconces any where, they are
excus'd as Princes in di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who will reward their Benefactors, when they come

<hi>Cali<U+017F>thenes</hi> being alarm'd, laid hold on her. Which <hi>Straton</hi> <U+017F>eeing, put in too, and
between them they <U+017F>o drew, that each of them had both too much and too little

<hi>Clarimond</hi> needed not <U+017F>o much to have laugh'd at: for your <hi>Romantick Shepherds</hi>
being all <hi>Beggars,</hi> <U+017F>uch a thing might happen, if they came to <U+017F>ome good hou<U+017F>e,
where after good drink and victuals, 'twas ea<U+017F>ie to bring them into the humour, as
being <U+017F>uch as of whom it might be <U+017F>aid, when they caper'd in a dance, that all their
worldly wealth was in the Ayr. But for <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi>'s Hi<U+017F>tory, that treats of per<U+017F>ons
of Quality, to have all match'd of a day, and that in the Chappel of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> was
a little extravagant. But Romances can do more; they can rai<U+017F>e Armies, and
conquer Kingdoms in as little time: yet a man may fain a thing <U+017F>o, as not to be
openly tax'd for a Lyar.</p>
               <p>As for what is done by <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> at <hi>Hiccans</hi> Marriage, if any <U+017F>ee not the wit of it,

tell you of one that was per<U+017F>waded out of his fight. Three <hi>Italians</hi> were at Cards
at an Ordinary at <hi>Venice:</hi> One having lo<U+017F>t all his money, went to bed, with his
mouth full of cur<U+017F>es and bla<U+017F>phemies, leaving the other two at play: The<U+017F>e two
having given over play, would needs make <U+017F>ome <U+017F>port with the third, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
the lo<U+017F>s of his money was fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep. They put out fire and candle,
and began to quarrel about the game; one <U+017F>wore 'twas <U+017F>o, the other, 'twas not,
making <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e that the other awoke, and looking up and <U+017F>eeing no candle,
thought they had <U+017F>poke in their <U+017F>leep, and <U+017F>o laid him down again. But they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling,
and making greater noi<U+017F>e then before, he looks up again, and being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
awake, What, <U+017F>ays he, do you play in the dark? In the dark! <U+017F>ay one; what
are you blinde? do you not <U+017F>ee we have two candles? With that, rubbing his
eyes, I can <U+017F>ee neither you nor the candles, <U+017F>ays he. Sure he hath lo<U+017F>t his <U+017F>ight,
<U+017F>ays one; and withal going to the bed <U+017F>ide, made as if he were amaz'd. Bring the

But it may be he does but counterfeit, or imagine him<U+017F>elf blinde. With that he
<U+017F>wore he <U+017F>aw nothing; and withal calling to minde his cur<U+017F>ing and bla<U+017F>phemies
over night, he was per<U+017F>waded God had <U+017F>o puni<U+017F>h'd him for it, whereupon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to weep. They advis'd him to vow a Pilgrimage to <hi>Loretto,</hi> which he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his bed, did, promi<U+017F>ing her Ladi<U+017F>hip two <U+017F>ilver eyes, if he recovered his.
This done, one of his Companions brought a Candle lighted out of another room,
whereupon they laugh at him. He was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at it, that he could not <U+017F>o
much as <U+017F>peak; neverthele<U+017F>s, his Companions told him, he mu<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>h his
vows, <U+017F>ince he had obtained his de<U+017F>ire. Now if a <hi>Game<U+017F>ter,</hi> one who<U+017F>e wit is
<pb facs="tcp:43725:17"/>
more refin'd then other ordinary men, and an <hi>Italian,</hi> could be thus per<U+017F>waded,

               <p>HEre we have <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> relating his adventures to his Cou<U+017F>in, wherein though he
have an excellent gift of invention, and applyes things hand<U+017F>omely; yet
any action that relates to <U+017F>ome old fable, he thinks he may venture on as
a thing will be granted him. But that natural and Citizen-like per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion of <hi>Adrians</hi>

Country life. But <hi>Clarimond</hi> now intends to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the enchantment, as being
weary of abu<U+017F>ing <U+017F>o long, one whom they <U+017F>hould rather endeavor to convince of
his extravagant opinions. However, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> intends to make his party good; you
<U+017F>ee what inventions he can finde to live, though he lo<U+017F>t all his e<U+017F>tate. He thinks
he de<U+017F>erves entertainment as well as tho<U+017F>e his Authors quote, and I think <U+017F>o too.
As for his exhortation to Patience in Adver<U+017F>ities, you mu<U+017F>t note he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>Celadon,</hi> who upon the di<U+017F>dain of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, lived a great
while on herbs like a bea<U+017F>t, though he were not two miles from his own
hou<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> feigning him<U+017F>elf dead, I think him wi<U+017F>er then many other Lovers,
who have kill'd them<U+017F>elves through the cruelty of their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es. Had not <hi>Iphic</hi>
better have done <U+017F>o, then hang'd him<U+017F>elf at her door; or the <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilius</hi> in <hi>Don Quixot,</hi>
that pretended to <U+017F>tab him<U+017F>elf before his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>The main de<U+017F>ign of all Poets is, to celebrate their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es; and that is it made
<hi>Fontenay</hi> <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Pernella</hi> <U+017F>hould be more famous then <hi>Laura.</hi> But why all the
Poets compare them<U+017F>elves to Swans, tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>weet <U+017F>inging birds I know not; but I
believe, that the <U+017F>inging of that bird <U+017F>o melodiou<U+017F>ly before his death, may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
among the <hi>Vulgar Errors;</hi> and he that fir<U+017F>t advanc'd it, did it upon no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                  <hi>Fontenay</hi>'s de<U+017F>ire to change wives with <hi>Adrian,</hi> furni<U+017F>hes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> with excellent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation
of Antiquity, who knew there had been <U+017F>ome Republikes where <U+017F>uch a

Romances.</p>
               <p>You <U+017F>ee how much my Author <U+017F>tudies to make all things natural; why may not
<hi>Adrian,</hi> who is a Citizen, be much more jealous and tender of his <hi>Pernella,</hi> as
<hi>Menelaus</hi> was of <hi>Helen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ly<U+017F>i</hi>'s feigned death is very well acted, <hi>Carmelin</hi> doth al<U+017F>o his part; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
he will not always borrow of his Common-places, I think that about Clo<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourning
is his own, if he have not <U+017F>een it in <U+017F>ome Manu<U+017F>cript; but <hi>Hircan</hi>'s je<U+017F>t
about one laughing on the wheel, he that knows that in other Countrys Malefactors
are broken with an iron bar upon a wheel, <U+017F>ees it.</p>
               <p>Then follow <U+017F>ome excellent con<U+017F>iderations about the burying or burning of dead
bodies; wherein though <hi>Philiris</hi> play the Poet, the Shepherd, and the Heathen
altogether, yet <U+017F>eems he to quote <U+017F>omewhat out of Doctor <hi>Charon,</hi> who <U+017F>ays,
that the mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>honorable way to mankinde of di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing dead bodies, is that of
<pb facs="tcp:43725:18"/>
burying them; and the mo<U+017F>t honorable, that of burning them: that the earth is
the dregs and ordure of the Elements, the <U+017F>ink of the world, and mother of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
I cannot conceive the rea<U+017F>on why <hi>Charron</hi> <U+017F>hould thus abu<U+017F>e the poor
Earth: nor why he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, we have no parts we ought to be a<U+017F>hamed of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
to <U+017F>hew the inclination he had to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert that Paradox, <hi>That women ought to
go naked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Poets tell us, their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es make them dye, and that they rai<U+017F>e them again;
and therefore that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>hould think <U+017F>o, is not <U+017F>o extravagant. Be<U+017F>ides, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<hi>Ae<U+017F>culapius,</hi> rais'd up <hi>Hippolitus.</hi> Why <U+017F>hould not <hi>Charite,</hi> who is a Sun her
<U+017F>elf, do as much as that <U+017F>on of <hi>Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>ays, That <hi>Love</hi> led his <U+017F>oul into Hell, wherein he differs from <U+017F>ome of his
ancient Ma<U+017F>ters; who affirm'd, that death divided a man into three parts, the Body
return'd to earth, the <U+017F>oul went to Heaven, or el<U+017F>e was united to that of the
Univer<U+017F>e, and there went to Hell but the Shade, which what it could con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of,
I cannot conceive. Yet tho<U+017F>e others that <U+017F>ay the fouls go to Hell, tell us <U+017F>tories of
Shades, enough to di<U+017F>cover the contradictions of Poetry: but why a <U+017F>oul <U+017F>hould
be call'd a Shade, I <U+017F>ee not; for being a thing of more worth then the body, and
that in its <U+017F>eparation it lo<U+017F>es nothing, it ought to have a nobler name.</p>
               <p>Nor doth the fiction of the Waterman <hi>Charon</hi> and his fare hold any more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
What need had this fellow of any money, in hell, where there is nothing to
buy? <hi>Pluto</hi> needed not this Poll-money, for the earth and all the mines were his;
<hi>Ceres</hi> and the other rural Divinities having no more then they nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily took up.
Of equal ab<U+017F>urdity is that of <hi>Cerberus,</hi> the three-tongu'd Dog. Hath <hi>Pluto</hi> no
other guard then that of a Dog? but it mu<U+017F>t be thought there needs none in hell,
for the Devils need neither Dog nor Cat, <U+017F>ince they keep no hou<U+017F>e, but live like
Philo<U+017F>ophers.</p>
               <p>Then is <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> brought before the three Judges, and by their order <U+017F>ent to the
<hi>Elizian</hi> fields, where he rips up old Poetry and Fables <U+017F>o exqui<U+017F>itely, that if all
Books were lo<U+017F>t, we might have all of this nature from him. He <U+017F>aies that the pa<U+017F>times
of the Devils are Cards and Dice. 'Tis true, quarrels, oathes and bla<U+017F>phemy are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of them, and Avarice the Inventor; But the impatience is remarkable: But at
what is a Game<U+017F>ter mo<U+017F>t impatient? Is it for the lo<U+017F>s of time in eating or <U+017F>leeping?
is't want of money? is't a years <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s? No; 'tis when the candle is put out in the
mid<U+017F>t of a game, or when the Die falls down, and cannot be found.</p>
               <p>Now comes the famous <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> on the Stage, that excellent advancer of <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tories,</hi>
and Courtier of the <hi>Mu<U+017F>es,</hi> who is wellcome<U+017F>t of all to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> one that
for <U+017F>port-<U+017F>ake was admitted to <U+017F>ome great mens tables.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fontenay</hi> continuing his follies, give <hi>Clarimond</hi> occa<U+017F>ion, really to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s conviction; for that he had <U+017F>aid before, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
in his extravagance, in regard of the Felicity of Fools, 'twas only for a

<U+017F>hall where my <hi>Authour</hi> hath been very liberal, contribute <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.</p>
               <p>The War of <hi>Troy</hi> is by mo<U+017F>t acknowledg'd a fiction: and <hi>Homer</hi> grounded his Poem
on <U+017F>ome old wives Tales, yet <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>ays nothing of that, becau<U+017F>e truth and Poetry
travel not far together. But he quarrels at the <U+017F>ubject of his Books, which is ill,
and that grand fault, of not mentioning the cau<U+017F>es of that war; for that he had
written any thing before, is but a conjecture; which yet <hi>Philiris</hi> makes the be<U+017F>t
<pb facs="tcp:43725:18"/>
of, when he <U+017F>ays, that his <U+017F>ubject was well enough known in <hi>Greece,</hi> and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently
he might begin where he plea<U+017F>'d. But as to <hi>Homer's</hi> Country, which
<hi>Philiris</hi> <U+017F>aies is heaven, and that Poetry is the Language of the Gods, 'tis a little
extraordinary, though all Oracles were in ver<U+017F>e. For <hi>Homers</hi> <U+017F>entences, be<U+017F>ides
that they are <U+017F>uch as it may be were in every mouth in tho<U+017F>e days, all <U+017F>ects of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophy
have gotten <U+017F>omewhat out of him; as if he commend Vertue, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
a <hi>Stoick,</hi> &amp;c. Nor have they been more fortunate, that make him Ma<U+017F>ter of
all Arts; or to <U+017F>ay better, a Jack of all Trades. For to make him a Ship-Carpenter,
'tis enough that he makes his <hi>Vli<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> one: To <U+017F>hew he was a good Cook, he made
his Hero's turn the <U+017F>pit, and boil the pot, and in <hi>Vulcan</hi> he is an Armourer: This
was an ea<U+017F>ie way to be of all Trades; but it is to be thought, that Ignorance and
Pedantry were the Godfathers that gave him that name. That any Captains and
the like <U+017F>hould e<U+017F>teem him, as if his works could infu<U+017F>e courage, is as improbable;
and yet this is no great commendation; for <hi>Amadis</hi> hath <U+017F>harpen'd the courage of
<U+017F>ome, who<U+017F>e unacquaintance with affairs kept them in ignorance of what was truly
military. And for <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who going into a <U+017F>chool, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ma<U+017F>ter for <hi>Homer</hi>'s Iliads, gave him a box on the ear, when he told him he
had none, 'tis no great credit. <hi>Alcibiadas</hi> was a ra<U+017F>h yong fellow, that affronted
all where he came, not <U+017F>paring the very Images of the Gods, the no<U+017F>es whereof
he cut off; be<U+017F>ides that, it <U+017F>hews that it was in tho<U+017F>e days a Book fitter for School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys
then Souldiers; and indeed it was fit a Schoolma<U+017F>ter <U+017F>hould have it, it being
their <hi>daily-bread;</hi> as <hi>Hieron</hi> <U+017F>aid to <hi>Xenophanes,</hi> complaining of Poverty; That
<hi>Homer,</hi> though while he liv'd, begg'd his bread, yet dead, he maintained ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
men. And hence it came, that the Schoolma<U+017F>ters have ever been his greate<U+017F>t
celebrators. As for <hi>Hector</hi>'s leaving the Army in a fight, to go and deliver a me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
that was unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, 'twas <U+017F>uch an ab<U+017F>urdity as <hi>Philiris</hi> mentions it not. As
for the fable of <hi>Circe,</hi> 'tis ju<U+017F>tly tax'd: for dawb as you will with <hi>Mythologies,
Uly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi>'s lying with a Sorcere<U+017F>s, will be a thing of ill example. As for the Beauty
of <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Penelope, Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>ays what he ought, and <hi>Philiris</hi> an<U+017F>wers as well;
but for the cha<U+017F>tity of the latter, and that eva<U+017F>ion of the web, 'tis <U+017F>uch a poor
one, that <U+017F>o many yong Lovers could not but in <U+017F>o many years di<U+017F>cover it. But
there are that <U+017F>ay, that tho<U+017F>e yong men, all enjoy'd her, and that thence <U+017F>prang
the God <hi>Pan,</hi> you have the credit of the Poets for the one as well as the
other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarimond</hi> having <U+017F>poken of <hi>Homer,</hi> <U+017F>pends not time on the other <hi>Greek</hi> Poets,
<U+017F>ince it was but repetition; and <U+017F>o falls on <hi>Virgil</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Latine</hi> Poets.
That <hi>Dido</hi> liv'd not in <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s time, is ea<U+017F>ie to prove: for his Fables, they are
low enough; his Buckler of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> his golden branch to go to hell with; to
finde explications for them, were to no purpo<U+017F>e. But <hi>Philiris</hi> de<U+017F>ervedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
the harmony, weight, and fluency of his ver<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi> Ovid <hi>and his</hi> Metamorpho<U+017F>es, <hi>it hath been in divers places <U+017F>hew'd they are
not natural, and <U+017F>ome modern, have been more fortunate; as for example,</hi> A
Player being to repre<U+017F>ent all conditions and per<U+017F>ons, having offended Mercury, in not
repre<U+017F>enting him well, was by that God Metamorphos'd into a Looking-gla<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>o
he might repre<U+017F>ent things better then he did in his life time. <hi>And that other,</hi> of a
cruel di<U+017F>dainful Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who could not be charm'd by any complaints of her Lover,
the Gods to puni<U+017F>h the one, and reward the other, chang'd this de<U+017F>perate Lover into a
Load<U+017F>tone, and that ungrateful Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s into Iron, that <U+017F>o in <U+017F>pight of her teeth <U+017F>he
might be drawn by him, whom before <U+017F>he did avoid. <hi>To which if we adde the

other Poets the invention is borrow'd. You mu<U+017F>t not think <hi>Clarimond</hi> can quote
all the impertinences of any book, e<U+017F>pecially of this; as where <hi>A<U+017F>tolphus</hi> rides to
heaven upon his <hi>Hypogriph,</hi> and there meets with St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeli<U+017F>t,</hi> who
<U+017F>hews him all the curio<U+017F>ities of the place, having put up his hor<U+017F>e in a certain place,

is not much behinde; but it mu<U+017F>t be thought his de<U+017F>ign was only to reduce the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
into neater terms then it was in: but methinks, being to <U+017F>peak as a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tian,</hi>
he might have omitted the Suns coach and hor<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>uch other <hi>Pagan</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urdities.</p>
               <p>Next comes up <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> with his Poems, Sonnets, Elegies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For his Sonnets,
they are allu<U+017F>ions to the old <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Fooleries, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome traductions
out of <hi>Italians.</hi> But becau<U+017F>e he is often quoted with his ab<U+017F>urdities in the text it <U+017F>elf,
we <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>ay much here, only <U+017F>hake a little his hymn, wherein hee compares
<hi>Hercules</hi> to <hi>Je<U+017F>us Chri<U+017F>t,</hi> both as to his birth and labours. <hi>The three nights that</hi>
Jupiter <hi>made one, when he was to enjoy</hi> Alcmena, <hi>repre<U+017F>ent the number of years,
which pa<U+017F>t before the Son of God was born of his mother; That</hi> Juno, <hi>who <U+017F>ent two
great Serpents into</hi> Alcides<hi>'s cradle, is King</hi> Herod, <hi>who to de<U+017F>troy the childe</hi> Je<U+017F>us,
<hi><U+017F>ent his <U+017F>ouldiers to kill the children in</hi> Bethlehem; <hi>That it was thought that tho<U+017F>e
two children were purely humane, the one being thought the <U+017F>on of</hi> Jo<U+017F>eph, <hi>the other of</hi>
Amphitruo; <hi>though</hi> Je<U+017F>us <hi>was the <U+017F>on of</hi> God, <hi>and</hi> Hercules <hi>the <U+017F>on of</hi> Jupiter: <hi>That</hi>
Prometheus <hi>unchain'd, is humane nature <U+017F>et at liberty: That</hi> Hercules, <hi>who ever
obeys</hi> Euri<U+017F>theus, <hi>is the</hi> Saviour <hi>of the world, who is ever obedient to his Father:
That the envious</hi> Juno <hi>is</hi> Satan (for <U+017F>he <hi>repre<U+017F>ents both</hi> Herod <hi>and the</hi> Devil; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
Amphitruo <hi>and</hi> Euri<U+017F>theus <hi>doe both repre<U+017F>ent</hi> God the Father) <hi>That</hi> Hercules
<hi>puting on the Garment of</hi> Iole, <hi>is</hi> Je<U+017F>us Chri<U+017F>t <hi>cloath'd with the humanity of his Church:
That</hi> Hercules <hi>and</hi> Atlas <hi>who <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the Heavens, are the</hi> Father <hi>and the</hi> Son <hi>who
<U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the Vniver<U+017F>e: That</hi> Charibdis, <hi>which <U+017F>wallowed one of</hi> Alcides<hi>'s Bulls, is
Satan, that makes a prey on one of the di<U+017F>ciplies of</hi> Je<U+017F>us Chri<U+017F>t: <hi>And la<U+017F>tly, that</hi>
Hercules, <hi>who is burnt on a mountain, is our</hi> Redeemer, <hi>who offers him<U+017F>elf up a <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
unto God the Father.</hi> O lewd Poet! The Adulteries of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the
<hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> are they not fit compari<U+017F>ons? why is not <hi>Alcmena</hi> the
<hi>Virgin,</hi> and the Angel <hi>Gabriel Mercury?</hi> But that <hi>Alcides,</hi> who to <U+017F>atisfie his
lu<U+017F>t, di<U+017F>guis'd him<U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>pun with <hi>Iola,</hi> <U+017F>hould be <hi>Je<U+017F>us Chri<U+017F>t,</hi> is equally as
Impious. I am to note further, that he is <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>worn imitator of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the
Poets his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors, that he omits not their greate<U+017F>t ab<U+017F>urdities: for this is but
a patern of what might be quoted: for his de<U+017F>criptions and <U+017F>imilitudes, they are
as tedious as <hi>Homers.</hi> If a man be to get a little water boild, he tells how he clove
the wood to make the fire with, then how he kindled it and blew it, then comes in
the flame, that encircles about the Kettle, then the white <U+017F>cummings, then the
noi<U+017F>e it makes in boiling, and this is your con<U+017F>tant entertainment. This Poet would
finde a man perpetual Satyre, yet was the mo<U+017F>t renowned of his time.</p>
               <p>But if we catch Poets and Fabuli<U+017F>ts, we mu<U+017F>t not let the Mythologi<U+017F>ts e<U+017F>cape,
who by their impertinences <U+017F>eek to continue the credit of the former, and would
have us <U+017F>wallow down ob<U+017F>cure and ambiguous fooleries for Divinity. 'Tis hard but
<U+017F>ome allu<U+017F>ion or other may be found to <U+017F>ave the reputation of advancers. <hi>Apollo</hi>
and <hi>Neptune</hi> build the walls of <hi>Troy,</hi> <U+017F>aies the Fable; there mu<U+017F>t be water, <U+017F>ays the
Mythologi<U+017F>t to make the morter, and when the wall is built, the Sun mu<U+017F>t dry it.
If they had put in <hi>Minerva</hi> too, it had been <U+017F>aid that it was to give them in<U+017F>tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the <hi>Architecture,</hi> <U+017F>he being the Godde<U+017F>s of the Liberal Arts: But for <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s
accompanying <hi>Aeneas</hi> in his battels in <hi>Italy,</hi> as al<U+017F>o being at tho<U+017F>e before
<hi>Troy,</hi> and her being hurt there; if you would put all <hi>Pedantry</hi> to the rack, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
finde any good explication. Tho<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o that <U+017F>hift off the ab<U+017F>urdity of Fables by
<hi>Synonima's,</hi> are we not any thing more oblig'd to; as that <hi>Helen, Ca<U+017F>tor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi>
are engendred of an egg; you mu<U+017F>t conceive the feat was done in <U+017F>ome great <hi>Oval</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
Nay, <U+017F>o critical are they, that they find explications for the adulteries and ab<U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of the<U+017F>e pittifull Divinities; and <U+017F>o impudent, as to pre<U+017F>ent us with them as
pieces of <U+017F>olid learning. Nay further, <U+017F>ome in the defence of fables tell us, that the
<pb facs="tcp:43725:19"/>
Poets had read <U+017F>ome parts of the Bible, and grounded them on <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tories thereof;
as that the Chariot of the Sun, was that of <hi>Elijah:</hi> but they cannot choo<U+017F>e but
be impertinent, that excu<U+017F>e impertinence.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Romances,</hi> there is as much <U+017F>aid in the beginning of this Preface concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their impertinences, and that little entertainment that is in them, that we <U+017F>hall
not have much to adde. For <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Montemajor,</hi> the Pa<U+017F>torals of <hi>Julietta, Daph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Cloe,</hi> and <U+017F>ome others, my Author <U+017F>hall make good what is <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t them.
Nor does our <hi>Arcadia</hi> e<U+017F>cape the quick-<U+017F>ighted <hi>Clarimond. A<U+017F>traea</hi> is a book hath
gotten great reputation, as coming out with the fir<U+017F>t fruits of more poli<U+017F>hed lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
and that which hath continued it is, that it contains a many <U+017F>tories fitted to
the humours of all <U+017F>orts.</p>
               <p>Nor is what this great Antagoni<U+017F>t of Romances <U+017F>ayes touching the beginning of
the <hi>Argenis,</hi> <U+017F>o incon<U+017F>iderable. The Ver<U+017F>es are al<U+017F>o forc'd in; you find them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
graven on <U+017F>tones, and any occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>erves to foi<U+017F>t in a paper; <U+017F>o that we
may think that the Book was rather made for the Ver<U+017F>es, then the Ver<U+017F>es for the
Book.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>D' Audiguier,</hi> the Author of <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> and <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta,</hi> one thing may be <U+017F>aid
in his excu<U+017F>e, is, that he was rather a man of his <U+017F>word then his pen, as appears in
many of his Epi<U+017F>tles; very <hi>Ga<U+017F>conically</hi> bragging, that <hi>he made his Pen with his
Sword,</hi> to excu<U+017F>e his ill writing. But his mi<U+017F>take was, that having heard that Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ought to be full of miraculous adventures, he hath endeavoured to make his the
mo<U+017F>t mon<U+017F>trous he could; by mangling of his adventures, abruptly leaving
things undone, and carrying the Reader into another Country, where he had left
<U+017F>uch a one, whom it was time to look after.</p>
               <p>As for tho<U+017F>e that go into woods, and talk to them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o loud, that <U+017F>ome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear,
it is thought a mighty ornament, otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>o many would not have u<U+017F>ed it,
and that <U+017F>o frequently. The examples are obvious.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s interpo<U+017F>ition; that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tir <U+017F>o much in a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which
concerned the whole <U+017F>ex, for who<U+017F>e entertainment and diver<U+017F>ion the<U+017F>e excellent
works are compo<U+017F>ed, wants not example, as may appear by that an<U+017F>wer of a woman
to a certain book written again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ex: <hi>That as the Lyon <U+017F>eeing a man painted
with his foot on the throat of one of his kind, <U+017F>aid, that if Lyons were Painters, they had
the <U+017F>ame advantage over men: So did women but write books, they would make men as
contemptible as they make them, and would make it appear they are the nobler <U+017F>ex.</hi>
And this was it cau<U+017F>ed <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> to give <U+017F>uch a cautious judgment, as being unwilling
to di<U+017F>oblige any. But as for others, they may cen<U+017F>ure <hi>Romances</hi> as they plea<U+017F>e.
But what influence the<U+017F>e two Orations had on our excellent Shepherd, appears not
yet, nor how this rare per<U+017F>onage con<U+017F>ummates all his high and famous adventures.
But that is the work of the</p>

               <p>WHere in the fir<U+017F>t place we have him giving his good word for <hi>Carmelin:</hi>
but when he is demanded how rich he may be, an<U+017F>wers very eva<U+017F>ively,
that he mu<U+017F>t needs be rich, <U+017F>ince he ows nothing. He from whom he
had that, was al<U+017F>o u<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ay, (though an ancient Gentleman) that he was young
enough when he was in health. But that humour of a Schoolma<U+017F>ter was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant,
who being upon clapping up of a match with a rich Citizen, and ask'd what
means he had, whether it were in lands or ready money, he an<U+017F>wered, he had not
either, yet he thought him<U+017F>elf as rich as any. This went very well, and 'twas thought
he had great <U+017F>ums due to him, or that he was upon <U+017F>ome project, or that he had
found the Philo<U+017F>ophers <U+017F>tone. But being <U+017F>till pre<U+017F>s'd to declare, he told them, that
his riches con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in the <U+017F>aying of one of the Seven wi<U+017F>e men, who <U+017F>ays, That the
only Poor man in the world is the Covetous, and the Rich is the Contented. It
<pb facs="tcp:43725:20"/>
was an<U+017F>wered him, that if he had no other e<U+017F>tate, 'twere well he went into <hi>Greece,</hi>
and marry <U+017F>ome kin<U+017F>woman of <hi>Bias;</hi> for in <hi>London</hi> Maids did not marry with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
nor yet <hi>Greek</hi> Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>The di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e between the Hermite and the Shepherd is very plea<U+017F>ant, and the
graces of it are obvious; the one being a <U+017F>imple devout man, that wore out no
other books then Breviaries<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> the other, one poi<U+017F>oned with a pernicious reading, which
he was able well enough <U+017F>o to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, as that <U+017F>uch a one <U+017F>hould not perceive it.
But <U+017F>ince <U+017F>ome have thought <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> prophane, I mu<U+017F>t vindicate him <U+017F>o far as that he
is not without example. <hi>Cali<U+017F>to</hi> in the Comedy of <hi>Cele<U+017F>tina</hi> <U+017F>ays, That <hi>if the fire of
Purgatory be as tormenting as that of his Love, he <U+017F>hould wi<U+017F>h him<U+017F>elf the <U+017F>oul of a
Bea<U+017F>t rather then that of a man.</hi> And his man asking whether <U+017F>uch expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions were
Chri<U+017F>tian, or no: <hi>If I am no Chri<U+017F>tian,</hi> <U+017F>ays he, <hi>I am a Melibean; for I adore</hi>
Melibea, <hi>and believe in her.</hi> But the<U+017F>e abu<U+017F>es of <hi>Religion,</hi> the Ceremonies and
Saints of it, is <U+017F>o frequent in all <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Romances,</hi> that a man cannot avoid
them <U+017F>o are they be<U+017F>otted, that they care not where they fa<U+017F>ten their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> you may perceive, is not wanting to make his party good, to prove
his <hi>Divinities,</hi> his <hi>Satyres,</hi> and his <hi>Nymphs.</hi> He hath <hi>Agrippa</hi> up, but <hi>Clarimond</hi>
clears him; yet not <U+017F>o, but his book of the <hi>Vanity of the Sciences</hi> comes <U+017F>hort of
what it pretends to; for <U+017F>ome he hath only <hi>defin'd,</hi> and <U+017F>hewn what they were for,
whereas it was hop'd he <U+017F>hould have di<U+017F>covered the <hi>Vanity</hi> of them. But I wonder
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being <U+017F>o well read as he was, did not think on that <hi>Satyre</hi> which <hi>S. Hierome</hi>
<U+017F>ays appeared to <hi>S. Anthony</hi> the <hi>Hermite,</hi> and was afterwards brought alive to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria.</hi>
It may be he thinks better to quote his own <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is.</hi> But now is
the Enchantment to be broken up; now mu<U+017F>t the pernicious reading of <U+017F>o many
years, and the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion it had made on <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s mind, (which was but too <U+017F>u<U+017F>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
of all images) be rendred as contemptible as it had been plea<U+017F>ant to him.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> by a <U+017F>hort relation of his life and adventures makes a great progre<U+017F>s a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
but when all he <U+017F>aid was confirmed by <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Hircan,</hi> <U+017F>uch was his
confu<U+017F>ion, that he had not what to <U+017F>ay. Nor may this <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange; for I never
told you he was quite <hi>mad,</hi> but having good intervals, all could be <U+017F>aid of him was,
that he was <hi>extravagant.</hi> But <hi>Hircan</hi>'s proffering to <U+017F>hew him the dre<U+017F><U+017F>es of the
Aquatick Gods, and the final revolt of the <hi>Shepherds,</hi> fini<U+017F>hes the work of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ion.
Upon which <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>hews him many <U+017F>ecrets concerning <hi>Hi<U+017F>tories,</hi> and
that it was not conducing to <hi>Felicity</hi> to go in <hi>Shepherds</hi> habit; convincing him out
of tho<U+017F>e Authorities which he him<U+017F>elf e<U+017F>teemed the greate<U+017F>t; for <U+017F>ince he believed
what was in <hi>Romances,</hi> he mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o believe what <hi>Clarimond</hi> quoted out of them.
And thus is he made wi<U+017F>e by the maxims of Folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi>'s marriages need not much remark: Only as for the former,
where it was feared he might be as extravagant in his <hi>Philo<U+017F>ophy</hi> as in his <hi>Shepherdry,</hi>
'tis to <U+017F>hew that it was hard to cure <U+017F>uch a one <U+017F>o, as that there might not remain
<U+017F>omwhat of the old di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. <hi>Charron</hi> is now one of his Authors, and of him he'll
take in<U+017F>tructions how to get children. In the <hi>Trial</hi> of <hi>Wits,</hi> there is a whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <U+017F>hew how to get Boyes, and not Girls. But all is but <hi>Theory,</hi> and fragments
of Phy<U+017F>icians, grounded upon Diets. But were there any truth in it, there yet
wanted one thing, which is of mo<U+017F>t concernment in generation of fair children, that
the married be both, as neer as may be, of a temperament. So that they <U+017F>hould fir<U+017F>t
have taught a man how to choo<U+017F>e a wife <hi>moi<U+017F>t</hi> or <hi>dry</hi> to his own temperament; or
el<U+017F>e told us, that upon every marriage there ought to <U+017F>it a Grand-Jury of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itians.</p>
               <p>And thus have I given you an account of this Hi<U+017F>tory of the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi>
and tell you, that if you de<U+017F>ire to know what is become of the Per<U+017F>ons, you find in
the text what became of the principal: For the le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>iderable, we <U+017F>hall follow
the cu<U+017F>tom of the Romances <U+017F>o much, as not to trouble you with any thing further
about them. All which when you have con<U+017F>idered together, I doubt not but you
will <U+017F>oon re<U+017F>olve where to fa<U+017F>ten the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>extravagance</hi> which this <hi>Shepherd</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:43725:20"/>
hath entertained the world with; for he doth but conveigh it from tho<U+017F>e great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
the <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Romanceers</hi> that had lived in the <U+017F>everal Ages before him.</p>
               <p>For my part, in the mean time I mu<U+017F>t acknowledge my own deficiencies, which
yet I hope are <U+017F>uch as have not rendred my Author unlike him<U+017F>elf: And whereas
notwith<U+017F>tanding what is here <U+017F>aid, this Book may be lookt on by <U+017F>ome of a nature ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
and trivial, I am <U+017F>o bold as to tell them, that it is the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>erious <hi>Satyre</hi>
and grave<U+017F>t Work that ever came into the world, and of no <U+017F>mall importance: For
if in <hi>Religion</hi> we value <U+017F>o much Books that combat and overcome <hi>Errour,</hi> I <U+017F>ee not
why it <U+017F>hould be a le<U+017F>s acceptable action in <hi>Morality,</hi> to endeavour the eradication
of <hi>Folly.</hi>

which Books have brought into our acquaintance, have
not without difficulty accompli<U+017F>h'd. To tell us that it is

but rather cast thy <U+017F>elf into the bed which <hi>Amphitrite</hi> hath prepared for thee,
and <U+017F>leep by the noi<U+017F>e of her waves.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e were the words that were overheard one morning, by <U+017F>ome that could

white <hi>Taby;</hi> a pair of gray <hi>Pearly <U+017F>ilk-Stockings</hi> on, and <hi>white Shoos</hi> with green <hi>Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fata

rings, as <U+017F>ufficed to demon<U+017F>trate the dryne<U+017F>s of his head. His Countenance had <U+017F>ome

            <p>A young Gentleman of <hi>Paris</hi> having perceived him afar off, was <U+017F>omwhat a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h'd
at his extraordinary garb; and di<U+017F>continuing his walk, came and hid him<U+017F>elf
<U+017F>omwhat near him, behind a haycock; where he was <U+017F>o far from making any noi<U+017F>e,

mea<U+017F>ured as a <hi>Swi<U+017F><U+017F>-Captain,</hi> and heard him pronounce words with <U+017F>uch animation
as if he had been on a Stage: which made him believe that he conn'd the part of
<U+017F>ome Stage-play wherein he was to be an Actor, as indeed they had a little before

then a Painter puts his boys into when he would repre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome great hi<U+017F>tory.

he cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed his arms, lifting up his head towards heaven, as if he begged <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with his eyes. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, he con<U+017F>idered him<U+017F>elf all about with certain ge<U+017F>tures of
admiration; and cry'd out, <hi>O God! how am I now a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that I <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e my
Beauty in this new habit! Such was the Phrygian Pa<U+017F>tor, when he gave <U+017F>entence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the difference of the three Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es.</hi> After that, he <U+017F>ate him on the ground; and
taking a little Loaf out of his bag, drew out withall divers other things, which he
<U+017F>et in order by him, that he might the better con<U+017F>ider them. There was a little <hi>dry
Gra<U+017F>s, a withered Pink,</hi> <U+017F>ome very <hi>foul Paper,</hi> and a Peece of old <hi>worn Leather.</hi>
Ah precious <hi>Reliques!</hi> <U+017F>ayes he in the mid<U+017F>t of his contemplation, I mu<U+017F>t have a Box

I pre<U+017F>ume to ask you what fair things you have there expo<U+017F>ed, and why you e<U+017F>teem
them <U+017F>o highly as if they were Peeces taken out of the Cabinet of <U+017F>ome Antiquary:
I had rather for the pre<U+017F>ent that you gave me part of your <U+017F>ecret de<U+017F>igns, then of
your breakfa<U+017F>t. I adore thy humour, replies the <hi>Shepherd;</hi> <U+017F>eeing thou betraye<U+017F>t
<U+017F>o much <hi>curio<U+017F>ity,</hi> thou mu<U+017F>t needs have a good <hi>wit:</hi> Sit thee here down by me,
and I <U+017F>hall give thee an account of my <U+017F>elf. It's a plea<U+017F>ure to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of our <hi>Loves,</hi>
while a gentle <hi>Zephir</hi> breaths yet upon the earth: when the heat <U+017F>hall advance, we

            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> hearing all the<U+017F>e not <U+017F>o common things, was un<U+017F>peakably a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd,
and knew he had found one <U+017F>ick of the <U+017F>trange<U+017F>t folly in the world: So that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering

and the greate<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ure that may be, when humour'd, he pre<U+017F>ently
placed him<U+017F>elf by him. He re<U+017F>olved within him<U+017F>elf to bite his lips, whenever he

            <p>I put up my <hi>bread</hi> for the pre<U+017F>ent, that I may entertain thee with my <hi><U+017F>ufferings.
Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es</hi> are more plea<U+017F>ant then <hi>Banquets.</hi> Know then that this common <hi>Tyrant</hi>
of our <U+017F>ouls, this <hi>God</hi> that is <U+017F>o little in bulk, and <U+017F>o great in power, (who if he were
not, <hi>Shepherds</hi> might di<U+017F>pute, as to <hi>felicity,</hi> with the <hi>Gods)</hi> no <U+017F>ooner ob<U+017F>erved me
in the world, but he de<U+017F>tin'd me for one of tho<U+017F>e Captives which he will have drawn
after his triumphal Chariot. Yet he alone could not have robbed me of my Liberty,
had he not been <U+017F>econded by a fair Eye; who con<U+017F>pired with him to make
him Ma<U+017F>ter of the Univer<U+017F>e. The incomparable <hi>Charite</hi> receives his pay, or rather
he hers, <U+017F>o to perfect the conque<U+017F>t of all hearts. 'Twas in <hi>Paris,</hi> that Epitome of
the World, that I <U+017F>aw that onely Wonder; when I was in a richer habit, but not
<U+017F>o noble as this I now have on. She dwelt about the quarter of <hi>St. Honore,</hi> and that
not without rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he was honoured of all the World. <hi>Fortune</hi> with her
blind eyes denyed me often the means of <U+017F>eeing her; and it was only at <U+017F>ome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
hours that I enjoyed that object, in pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by the <hi>hou<U+017F>e,</hi> or rather the <hi>temple</hi>
of that <hi>Godde<U+017F>s,</hi> but wanted the opportunity of tendring my <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi><U+017F>acrifices</hi>
to her. I pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by that way above ten times in an afternoon; and becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould
have been a<U+017F>hamed that the neighbours <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee me <U+017F>o often, the fir<U+017F>t time I put
on a black Cloak, the <U+017F>econd a gray; one while I walked gravely, another with a
<U+017F>taff, as if I had been lame, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould have been ob<U+017F>erved. When I would not
pa<U+017F>s quite through the <U+017F>treet, I was content to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf of a corner, and <U+017F>ee
my <hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s</hi> afar off, though the mo<U+017F>t commonly I could perceive but the extremity
of her Petticoat. But I did more then all this: when I returned from <U+017F>ome part
where I had been at <U+017F>upper, I went out of my way three <U+017F>treets, to go into hers;
and it <U+017F>atisfied me to con<U+017F>ider the walls that kept her in, and to <U+017F>ee the candle in her
chamber; and if the gla<U+017F>s appear'd more ob<U+017F>cure in one place then another, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it was <U+017F>he that was near the window, and there I <U+017F>tood for to contemplate
that fair <U+017F>hadow <U+017F>o long as it continued. And though all this can be called no
other then a fal<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ure, yet I was nece<U+017F><U+017F>itated to continue in this torment a whole
year; A torment more cruel then that of <hi>Tantalus.</hi> But the<U+017F>e eight dayes <U+017F>ince, I
have found the Heavens more favourable to me: <hi>Charite</hi> is come to dwell here,
where I hope to find greater means to acquaint her with my flames. The <hi>Shepherd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi>
doe oftentimes retire into the groves, where the <hi>Shepherds</hi> may entertain them,
and yet no envious eye <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>cover it, as it falls out in Cities, where a man is <U+017F>pied
and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected by every one. To pro<U+017F>ecute therefore my <hi>Love</hi> with more <hi>liberty,</hi> I
have put on this habit, which I had wi<U+017F>h'd long before, and am re<U+017F>olved to pa<U+017F>s
away my dayes near tho<U+017F>e fair <hi>Rivers</hi> with this little <hi>Flock.</hi> But that I may not
conceal any thing from thee, and that I may be known to thee as to a Brother, I
tell thee what I would not every body; and that is this, that my own proper name
is <hi>Lewis,</hi> but I have quitted that to take <U+017F>ome <hi>Shepherd</hi>-name. I would have one
that came <U+017F>omwhat near my own, that <U+017F>o I might be always known; and <U+017F>ometimes
I had a mind to be called <hi>Lodovick,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Ly<U+017F>idor,</hi> but in the end I have not
found any name more fit then <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> a name that <U+017F>ounds <U+017F>omwhat, I know not what,
that is amorous and gentle. As for <hi>Charite,</hi> not to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, her true name is <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine;</hi>
I heard her <U+017F>o call'd but ye<U+017F>terday by a Nymph. But thou knowe<U+017F>t the

Eliza</hi> in<U+017F>tead of <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The<U+017F>e old names <U+017F>ound far better then the new, in the
mouths of the Poets. So after I had taken a<U+017F>under this name of <hi>Catherine</hi> for to
compo<U+017F>e another out of it, I found by way of <hi>Anagram</hi> that of <hi>Chariteé,</hi> and there
wants only an <hi>[n]</hi> but all the letters are there. How many Laurels have I de<U+017F>erved
for this rare invention, <U+017F>eeing that name is clearly the name of a Shepherde<U+017F>s,
and that lately there hath been a Book of Pa<U+017F>torals made, which is <U+017F>o called?
Neverthele<U+017F>s I have been content to cut off one letter more, and to call her <hi>Charite<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>

becau<U+017F>e the name <U+017F>eems to me more <hi>gentile,</hi> and more ea<U+017F>ie to come into <hi>ver<U+017F>e</hi>
Wherefore henceforward there <U+017F>hall not be <hi>rock</hi> nor <hi>tree</hi> in the Country, where
<U+017F>hall not be engraved the names of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Charite:</hi> nay, I wi<U+017F>h I could grave
them in the <hi>heavens,</hi> or make the <hi>clouds</hi> receive the form of our Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.</p>
            <p>But to <U+017F>atisfie thee more particularly as to the Jewels thou <U+017F>ee<U+017F>t me have, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<hi>Shepherd,</hi> know they are things which I look on as mo<U+017F>t exqui<U+017F>ite favours.
For the little that I have <U+017F>een <hi>Charite,</hi> I doe not think <U+017F>he knows me: <U+017F>he hath not
given me any <hi>bracelets</hi> of her hair, nor ca<U+017F>t <hi>amorous</hi> looks on me. For want of this,
I <U+017F>hall not forget my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o far, as not to keep <U+017F>omething that comes from her.
Ye<U+017F>terday as I came to <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> I <U+017F>aw her walking with one of her Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
In je<U+017F>ting <U+017F>he took a <hi>Pink</hi> that was in her brea<U+017F>t, and ca<U+017F>t it at the other whom
<U+017F>he met: I was carefull to gather it up, that the re<U+017F>t of my dayes I might have the
plea<U+017F>ure to ki<U+017F>s that fair Flower which had touched tho<U+017F>e fair Apples that are more
precious then tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>He<U+017F>perides.</hi> After that <U+017F>he took out of her pocket a peece
of <hi>Paper,</hi> which <U+017F>he tore all to peeces, and threw away as a thing nothing worth;
yet highly e<U+017F>timable to me, who took it up, de<U+017F>iring to pre<U+017F>erve whatever comes
from her. Pre<U+017F>ently after <U+017F>he <U+017F>tooped down, <U+017F>omewhat ailing her foot and hindring
her to go, and tore off a little <hi>peece</hi> of the <U+017F>oal of her <U+017F>hoe, which dragg'd along:
What grief would have <U+017F>eiz'd me, if I had not obtained that fair peece of <hi>Leather,</hi>
who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervice had once been to carry <U+017F>o worthy a body! Fate was favourable to
me: <hi>Charite</hi> and her Companion betook them into a hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that I being left
alone in the <U+017F>treet, pre<U+017F>umed to take up that rich trea<U+017F>ure; and what is more, that
my felicity might not be imperfect, I gathered of the <hi>Gra<U+017F>s</hi> which had received the
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of her divine paces. Behold, gentle Shepherd, I have all the<U+017F>e things in
my cu<U+017F>tody: Satisfie thy eyes with them, and ob<U+017F>erve quickly if they have not
<U+017F>ome extraordinary lu<U+017F>tre; for I am going to put them up: 'Tis a prophanation
of them, to expo<U+017F>e them <U+017F>o long in the aire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> wondering at the <hi>extravagances</hi> wherewith <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> entertained him,
could not withhold him<U+017F>elf from <U+017F>aying to him; But what, perfect <hi>Lover!</hi> if <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
had <U+017F>pat <U+017F>omewhere, or done <U+017F>omewhat le<U+017F>s decent, would you be <U+017F>o curious as
to keep whatever <U+017F>hould come from her? Who doubts it? replies he: ought any
thing that is <U+017F>o precious be lo<U+017F>t, when it may be recovered? I make a vow from
henceforward, to find me out a Cave <U+017F>omewhere hereabouts, where I will pre<U+017F>erve
all whatever <U+017F>hall come from her; and thither will I go every day, and there <U+017F>pend
whole hours in contemplation. You will never have done, <U+017F>ayes <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> if you
will keep <U+017F>o many things: How is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to get all the gra<U+017F>s that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall tread
upon? Let me tell you, you <U+017F>hall do well to content your <U+017F>elf with <U+017F>ome part: but
your <U+017F>atisfaction would be far greater, if you could get her Picture, and that would
make you remember her better. Ha! that's excellently imagined, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi>
It is true, I have <U+017F>een in all Books, that <hi>Lovers</hi> doe always endeavour to have the
Pictures of their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es: But how <U+017F>hall I have mine? Where is the Painter <U+017F>o
skilfull that can draw it? A mortal man cannot fixtly look on her. There is none
but <hi>Love</hi> that is able to accompli<U+017F>h this work, as he hath already painted her well
in my heart: yet I <U+017F>hould be well plea<U+017F>ed to have her (if it be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible) in another
draught, that I might place it upon an Altar, and make it my Idol. Whereupon
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> told him, that if he knew <hi>Charite,</hi> he might a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him<U+017F>elf that he would
draw her Picture <U+017F>o as he <U+017F>hould therewith be <U+017F>atisfied. And indeed he <U+017F>pake truth,
for from his very childhood he delighted in Painting; An accompli<U+017F>hment that
doth a man no hurt, though he doe not make it his profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing that
he proffered him <U+017F>o great a favour, could not imagine that any mortal had <U+017F>o much
power and will to <U+017F>uccour him; and hereupon embracing his knees, <U+017F>pake to him
in the<U+017F>e words: Pardon me, <hi>O great Divinity</hi> of our groves! if ere-while I could
not di<U+017F>cover who you were: Now doe I perceive well enough that you are the God
<hi>Pan,</hi> that hath di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf for to come and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me in my <hi>Loves;</hi> and I ea<U+017F>ily

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43725:26"/>
like mine: Henceforth there <U+017F>hall not pa<U+017F>s a day, that I <U+017F>hall forget to pour
out <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>milk</hi> before your Altars; and every moneth will I offer you <U+017F>acrifice
of the fatte<U+017F>t of my Lambs. Con<U+017F>ider well what you <U+017F>ay, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> I am
not he whom you conceive me to be; I have no <hi>cloven feet,</hi> nor any <hi>tail</hi> behind,
nor <hi>horns</hi> on my head. And thereupon pu<U+017F>hing him from him, he was <U+017F>omewhat
amazed to <U+017F>ee a man make towards them, crying as loud as he could, I have thee
<hi>Lewis,</hi> I have thee; henceforward I will <U+017F>hut thee up, <U+017F>o as thou <U+017F>halt not any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
amu<U+017F>e the world with thy follies. Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was interrupted by the
arrival of the man: who being near the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> took him by one arm, and <U+017F>aid
to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> Sir <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I pray afford me your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to convey this young man as
far as <hi>St. Cloud:</hi> You may have di<U+017F>covered that he is not <U+017F>ound in mind: I who
am his Guardian, cannot but be more con<U+017F>cientious then to <U+017F>uffer him to wander
thus from one place to another; if I were not, I <U+017F>hould be accountable to Ju<U+017F>tice:
I intend to bring him back to <hi>Paris.</hi> Silence, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> Let us <U+017F>tay a little here:
Good Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Adrian!</hi> give me but an houre or two, to <U+017F>hew you my rea<U+017F>ons:
This courteous <hi>Shepherd</hi> <U+017F>hall be our Judge: He is <U+017F>o perfect, that I took him but
now for the God <hi>Pan;</hi> and yet I cannot otherwi<U+017F>e per<U+017F>wade my <U+017F>elf but that he is
either <hi>Cupid,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other God in the habit of Man.</p>
            <p>At the<U+017F>e words the Guardian <U+017F>tayes, as having a de<U+017F>ire to hear what he would
<U+017F>ay. Whereupon the <hi>Shepherd</hi> re<U+017F>uming the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with a tone <U+017F>omwhat elevated,
<U+017F>pake to him thus. Is it not a <U+017F>trange blindne<U+017F>s to blame the <hi>happy</hi> condition that I
would follow? The name of <hi>Shepherd</hi> is as ancient as the World, and <hi>Pan</hi> is the
fir<U+017F>t God to whom men have <U+017F>acrificed. Heretofore Kings children kept Sheep as
I doe; and for to learn how to hold a <hi>Scepter,</hi> they were before fain to hold a
<hi>Sheep-hook.</hi> The <hi>Wooll</hi> which we have from time to time at the <U+017F>hearing of our <hi><U+017F>heep,</hi>
is like the Revenue that a Prince receives from his Subjects. The <hi>Gods</hi> them<U+017F>elves
have <U+017F>ometimes deigned to come down on earth for to be <hi>Shepherds:</hi> And if that
were not <U+017F>o, they cea<U+017F>e not to be <U+017F>uch always in heaven; for what are the <hi>Stars,</hi>
but a <U+017F>ort of <hi>living</hi> creatures which they drive to feed here and there in tho<U+017F>e va<U+017F>t
<hi>Plains?</hi> But as for us <hi>terre<U+017F>trial Shepherds,</hi> what is it that can be compar'd to our
glory? Could the world with any <U+017F>hift be without us? The Wooll of our Flocks,
doth it not furni<U+017F>h cloathing to all the world? The Tapi<U+017F>try of Temples and Kings
Palaces, is it not made of it? Some may tell me, that men may make u<U+017F>e of <hi>Silk:</hi> Is
that any noble thing in compari<U+017F>on of the other? It is but the excrement of a vile
creature. What if I have made me clothes of it? It is only for every day; I will have
others made of <hi>Cloth</hi> for Holy-dayes. The fle<U+017F>h of our <hi>Sheep,</hi> is it not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
nouri<U+017F>hment of men? If we had none, how <U+017F>hould we <U+017F>acrifice to the Gods?
Are not the<U+017F>e creatures, think you, acceptable to them, when <hi>Jupiter</hi> would be
adored in one of his Temples under the form of a <hi>Ram?</hi> and was it not for a <hi>Fleece</hi>
that <hi>Ja<U+017F>on</hi> and the <hi>Argonauts</hi> went to <hi>Colchos?</hi> This is to <U+017F>hew you, Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
that as our <hi>Flocks</hi> are very profitable, <U+017F>o is it a great honour to keep them, and
that no man indeed <U+017F>hould meddle with any other imployment. To what end <U+017F>erve
all the Trades in the <hi>City?</hi> Read the Pa<U+017F>torals of <hi>Julietta,</hi> and you will find that
there was in <hi>Arcadia</hi> neither <hi>Councellors,</hi> nor <hi>Attornies,</hi> nor <hi>Sollicitors,</hi> nor <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;</hi>
there was nothing but <hi>Shepherds:</hi> We mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o too here in <hi>France,</hi> if
we de<U+017F>ire to be happy. Buy you a Flock, take Shepherds habit, change your <hi>Ell</hi>
for a <hi>Sheep-hook,</hi> and come your wayes hither to be a <hi>Lover:</hi> And doe not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el
me to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to execute <U+017F>ome <hi>Office.</hi> You may bring hither my
Cou<U+017F>in your wife, and all your <hi>Prenti<U+017F>es,</hi> who will all be glad to become <hi>Shepherds:</hi>
You will find it a greater plea<U+017F>ure here to laugh and dance to the <hi>Bagpipe,</hi> then to
take the pains you doe at <hi>Paris,</hi> in <U+017F>hewing of <hi>Silks</hi> and <hi>Stuffs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O heaven! cry'd out <hi>Adrian:</hi> What hath our race committed, that mu<U+017F>t be
thus expiated? Now I plainly <U+017F>ee that the poor Youth hath lo<U+017F>t his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es quite
and clean. Sir, <U+017F>ayes he to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>eeing he places <U+017F>o much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in you, be<U+017F>tow your per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions to bring him to him<U+017F>elf. Whereupon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elme</hi>
taking <hi>Adrian</hi> a<U+017F>ide, tells him, that he had fully di<U+017F>covered his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43725:26"/>
it was requi<U+017F>ite to comply a little with him, leaving him there <U+017F>ome while longer to
entertain him<U+017F>elf with his own thoughts; and that in the mean time, he de<U+017F>ired to
know who he was, if <U+017F>o be he had the lei<U+017F>ure to tell him. <hi>Adrian</hi> an<U+017F>wered him,
that he would willingly doe it; believing, that when he had acquainted him with
the whole life of his Ward, he might be the more able to remove tho<U+017F>e imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
which troubled his mind.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, they retired <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance from <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who being alone <U+017F>et him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
to <hi>ruminate</hi> on his <hi>Loves,</hi> not dreaming any thing of what they went about:
And <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was an hone<U+017F>t man, but withall very <U+017F>imple, as mo<U+017F>t of your <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>
are, and one that knew very little be<U+017F>ides his <hi>Trade,</hi> continued thus his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
with much natural <U+017F>imlicity.</p>
            <p>That Young man whom you have now <U+017F>een, is the Son of a <hi>Silk-man,</hi> who lived
in <hi>St. Dennis <U+017F>treet:</hi> He had no more children; and hath left him <U+017F>o rich, that we
all hoped that he would re<U+017F>tore our Nobility, and that we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee in our race
a Regal Officer, who might be a protection to us. You know, there are many
<hi>Merchants</hi> Sons that are <U+017F>o: And though the <hi>Nobility</hi> contemn us, yet we are as
good men as them<U+017F>elves: They are not able, as we are, to be<U+017F>tow great Offices for
their children; and if they are <U+017F>o <hi>brave,</hi> it only demon<U+017F>trates their <hi>borrowing</hi> from
us. In the mean time they call us <hi>Sires,</hi> and they are not mi<U+017F>taken; for indeed we
are a <U+017F>ort of <hi>petty Kings.</hi> But to come to my Tale: <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Father and Mother
being dead, I was cho<U+017F>en his Guardian, as being the next of Kindred. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
gone through his Studies at the Colledge of <hi>Navar,</hi> and co<U+017F>t his friends more
mony then his weight. He was eighteen years of age, or thereabouts: I told him
it was time for him to bethink him<U+017F>elf what cour<U+017F>e of life he would follow; That
he was not brought up to Learning, to the end he might idle away his time; and
that he was old enough to make his own choi<U+017F>e how to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of him<U+017F>elf. For to
try him further, I asked him whether he had any inclination to be a <hi>Draper,</hi> as I am
my<U+017F>elf: but he an<U+017F>wering me, that he a<U+017F>pired to <U+017F>omewhat more noble, I was not any
thing di<U+017F>pleas'd at him. He tabled at my hou<U+017F>e, and I <U+017F>ent him to certain Ma<U+017F>ters in
<hi>Paris,</hi> who teach the Trade of <hi>Councellors.</hi> They are a <U+017F>ort of people that are <U+017F>o
expert, that when a young man is to be received a Di<U+017F>ciple, they undertake to teach
him in one moneth all that he hath to an<U+017F>wer, as if it were but to teach him to
whi<U+017F>tle, as one would doe a Starling; <U+017F>o that of an ignorant <hi>School-boy,</hi> they ever
make a learned <hi>Lawyer.</hi> My Cou<U+017F>in <U+017F>tudied a year under them, and was <U+017F>ent thither
to no other purpo<U+017F>e: yet could he never be per<U+017F>waded to put on the <hi>Long-robe.</hi>
In<U+017F>tead of <hi>Law-books,</hi> he bought none but a <U+017F>ort of tra<U+017F>hy books called <hi>Romances:</hi>
Cur<U+017F>ed be tho<U+017F>e that have made them! They are wor<U+017F>e then <hi>Hereticks:</hi> The books
of <hi>Calvin</hi> are not <U+017F>o damnable; at lea<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>peak not of any more Gods then
one, and the others talk of a great many, as if we <U+017F>till lived in tho<U+017F>e heathen times
which wor<U+017F>hipped blocks hewn into the <U+017F>hape of men. It doth not a little di<U+017F>turb
the minds of young people, who as in tho<U+017F>e Books they find nothing <U+017F>o much men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as <hi>playing, dancing,</hi> and merry-making with young <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> <U+017F>o would
they doe the like, and thereby incur the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of their friends. Tho<U+017F>e Books
are good for your medley-Gentlemen of the Country, who have nothing to doe
all day, but to walk up and down and pick their nails in an out-chamber: But as
for the <U+017F>on of a <hi>Citizen,</hi> he <U+017F>hould not read anything, unle<U+017F>s it were the <hi>Royal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi>
the <hi>Civility of Children,</hi> or <hi>Patient Gri<U+017F><U+017F>el,</hi> to make him<U+017F>elf merry on
<hi>Fle<U+017F>h-dayes.</hi> This was my advice to <hi>Lewis;</hi> but he would not believe me: And
then you would <U+017F>ay I had a fine task to command him to learn by heart the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drains</hi>
of <hi>Pybrac,</hi> or the <hi>Tablettes</hi> of <hi>Matthieu,</hi> that he might <U+017F>ometimes rehear<U+017F>e
them at the Tables-end when there were Company; alas! he could not endure the
<U+017F>peech of it. That put me into <U+017F>uch a fury, that I went one day into his chamber,
and took all his mi<U+017F>chievous books, and burnt them: But he bought him others,
and hid them <U+017F>ometimes in his Straw-bed, and <U+017F>ometimes in <U+017F>ome other place. I
could not hinder his reading of them; if he did it not at home, he did it abroad;
<U+017F>ometimes he walked out into the fields with a Book in his breeches. At la<U+017F>t being

at a lo<U+017F>s of all patience, I intreated him in the name of all his good kinsfolks and
friends, to tell me what profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion he would be of. He an<U+017F>wered me, that I <U+017F>hould
let him alone, that the hour to think of that was not yet come; and that in the
mean time he would be a <hi>Stage-player,</hi> <U+017F>aying it was a Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion that payed no
duties, and yet was very noble, <U+017F>eeing that although a Stage-player were of all
qualities and conditions one after another, yet did he not purcha<U+017F>e any of them.
This re<U+017F>olution of his I thought would have broke my heart, for I have ever loved
him as much as if he had been mine own child: but I found out at la<U+017F>t, that all that
he had told me was only in je<U+017F>t. Yet he continued his <hi>pernicious reading,</hi> wherein
he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over whole moneths, without ever going out of the hou<U+017F>e, unle<U+017F>s it were
one half houre on Sunday to go to Ma<U+017F>s. He always locked him<U+017F>elf up in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and came not to meals with me but once a day. I went ofttimes to li<U+017F>ten at his
door, and I could hear him make <U+017F>uch Love-di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, as if he were <U+017F>peaking to
<U+017F>ome fair Lady, and then a little after, he an<U+017F>wered him<U+017F>elf for her, counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his voice. You <U+017F>ee now how he hath pa<U+017F>s'd his time at my hou<U+017F>e till this year,
which is his five and twentieth, wherein he hath made appear that his mind is more
fraught with hurtful imaginations then ever. My wife had about a moneth <U+017F>ince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented
the con<U+017F>ecrated bread in our Pari<U+017F>h; the Beadle that over<U+017F>ees that work had
brought her back the wrought cloth it was carried in: He got hold of it, and having
wrapp'd him<U+017F>elf about with it, as the School-boys doe who repre<U+017F>ent <hi>Shepherds</hi> in
the Colledge-Comedies, he began to repeat <hi>ver<U+017F>es</hi> in my chamber, beholding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
in the Looking-gla<U+017F>s, to <U+017F>ee if he acted his his part hand<U+017F>omly. I came to him
while he was in this po<U+017F>ture, and jeered him <U+017F>o much, as if he had own'd any <U+017F>hame,
he had repented him of what he had done. It hath been his <U+017F>tudy ever <U+017F>ince, how
to counterfeit the <hi>Shepherd;</hi> and in<U+017F>tead of a <hi>Sheep-hook</hi> he took <U+017F>ometimes a <hi>Be<U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>taff,</hi>
and <U+017F>ometimes a <hi>Ra<U+017F>p;</hi> mo<U+017F>t commonly he took a <hi>Fork</hi> I had in my back-<U+017F>hop,
which was <U+017F>omewhat more commmodious for him, becau<U+017F>e it was of a good length;
and he hath broke me two or three, by leaning negligently his leg thereupon for to
per<U+017F>onate the <hi>Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Shepherd,</hi> as he once had ob<U+017F>erved at <hi>Bourgundy</hi>-Hou<U+017F>e.
At la<U+017F>t he found out the means to make him the habit which he now hath on, and
hath <U+017F>tollen away from me to come hither, where he intends to play the Shepherd
in good earne<U+017F>t, and act Comedies in the mid<U+017F>t of the field. 'Twere at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
better if he were at my hou<U+017F>e then in this place, where his follies will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
to all the world. Thus far therefore have I gone: I learned he was come
into the<U+017F>e quarters, and that he retired la<U+017F>t night to a poor Countrymans hou<U+017F>e,
who hath help'd him to buy <U+017F>ome <U+017F>heep, and hath <U+017F>uffered him to go abroad in his
new habit, without cro<U+017F><U+017F>ing him in any thing. My intention is to carry him back,
and lock him up in <U+017F>ome place, where he may <U+017F>ee nothing at all, untill this humour
be over.</p>
            <p>You will get nothing by that, <U+017F>aith <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t not go that way to work:
For <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e he were in <U+017F>ome place where there were no Books that could give any
entertainment to his Extravagances, he knows enough already for to feed him<U+017F>elf
in them, and in a Chamber that were no longer then a Perch, his mind would travel
500 leagues in half an hour; 'twere in this <U+017F>olitude that his imagination would be
in continual imployment. 'Tis better to let him enjoy company; for he will divert
and rid him<U+017F>elf of many errors, which haply had not po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t his thoughts but for
want of knowing how men live in the world. Let me have the tuition of him a little;
I have a hou<U+017F>e at St. <hi>Cloud</hi> that is at yours and his <U+017F>ervice, and I will entertain him
the be<U+017F>t I can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> thanked <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> for his courte<U+017F>ie, and told him, that come what will
on't, he would let him try, if he could prevail any thing with his Cou<U+017F>in. While
they were engaged in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, they came <U+017F>till nearer and nearer St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> and
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> drew <hi>Adrian</hi> with <U+017F>ome importunity thither for to dine at his hou<U+017F>e, telling
him, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> mu<U+017F>t be left in the fields till night, to <U+017F>ee if his patience would hold
out to <U+017F>tay there without the diver<U+017F>ion of any company.</p>
            <p>While they were ab<U+017F>ent, the <hi>new Shepherd</hi> made his meal on the fruits wherewith
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43725:27"/>
he was furni<U+017F>hed, and went and drunk at the River. Divers Country-people went
near by him, but there was not one that had the boldne<U+017F>s to <U+017F>peak to him; they
all took him for an Apparition.</p>
            <p>It was at length tedious to him, not to have any body to talk with: And <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Flock of Sheep at <U+017F>ome pretty di<U+017F>tance from him, he drove his towards that
<U+017F>ide, to pa<U+017F>s away the time with him that kept them: Though it was a lu<U+017F>ty
Country-fellow, and that he ob<U+017F>erved his habit to be much different from his: Yet
he <U+017F>tick'd not to approach him, with a ge<U+017F>ture as courteous as if it had been <hi>Celadon</hi>
or <hi>Sylvander.</hi> Courteous Shepherd! <U+017F>ayes he, Tell me what are thy occupations
here? Doe<U+017F>t thou think on the cruelty of <hi>Clorinda?</hi> How long is it <U+017F>ince thou ha<U+017F>t

<U+017F>poken to him in <U+017F>ome barbarous tongue, was very much amaz'd at his mode, not

no more hide her <U+017F>elf then the Sun? No, no, it is apparent: For if thou had<U+017F>t once

doth not feed on any thing but <hi>Hearts,</hi> and carrou<U+017F>es in nothing but <hi>Tears.</hi>
Alas, <U+017F>aid the Shepherd, (making the <U+017F>ign of the <hi>Cro<U+017F>s)</hi> it <U+017F>eems you <U+017F>peak to me

her: <U+017F>he bewitches the Flocks, the Dogs, the Wolves, nay even the Rocks, which
<U+017F>he makes follow her; the Plants doe not e<U+017F>cape her, and it is only <U+017F>he that cau<U+017F>es
the buds of the Ro<U+017F>es to <U+017F>hoot forth, and afterwards cau<U+017F>es them to wither away
through the <U+017F>ame heat that produced them. Ah! how <U+017F>hall I have a care not to
appear before her, <U+017F>aid the Shepherd; for I am not <U+017F>uch a one as the mo<U+017F>t part of

from the wicked woman you talk of; I doe not know how they make Characters;
I cannot <U+017F>ave my <U+017F>elf any way but by flight. Stupid fellow! replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> do<U+017F>t thou

The Shepherd, who <U+017F>aw that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> animated his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with a <U+017F>erious manner
of <U+017F>peaking, gave credit to all the<U+017F>e miracles; and though he was as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
as if he had already <U+017F>een the end of the world, yet had he the courage to
ask him who he was? I am a <hi>body</hi> without a <hi><U+017F>oul,</hi> an<U+017F>wers <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I doe not <hi>live,</hi>

            <p>Having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, he quitted the Shepherd; who was <U+017F>o much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed both at
the fa<U+017F>hion of the man, and his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that he certainly believed that it was a

            <p>As he had <U+017F>poken the<U+017F>e words, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> came from behind a long wall where

<U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect him, and que<U+017F>tion'd him divers times. So that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wa<U+017F>ible

found <hi>Charite</hi> more beautifull then he? But rather on the contrary, hath not <U+017F>he

<U+017F>he is <U+017F>omwhat extravagant? For my part, I believe it, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43725:28"/>
from a collation at the Tavern in the <hi>Heaume,</hi> where <U+017F>he had drunk a little too
much <hi>Sure<U+017F>ne</hi> wine. But what an error are you guilty of, to believe that the Eccho
which an<U+017F>wered you was the <U+017F>ame Nymph that was in love with <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us?</hi> There
are few rocks and other places in the world where there is any hollowne<U+017F>s, but there
are <U+017F>uch voices as the<U+017F>e: whereas <U+017F>he that was in love with that fair hunt<U+017F>man, who
loved none but him<U+017F>elf, lives only in a rock of <hi>Beotia,</hi> where her langui<U+017F>hing hath
made her <U+017F>o lean, that there remained of her no more then the bones, which were
turned into <U+017F>tones, and <U+017F>peech, which is heard there to this day. She could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer
us at that di<U+017F>tance; it mu<U+017F>t needs be, that in <hi>France</hi> and other Countries there
are <U+017F>ome Demy-godde<U+017F><U+017F>es which drive the <U+017F>ame Trade as <U+017F>he. Do not believe that,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> <U+017F>he hath a ready <U+017F>pirit, and hears well when one calls her, <U+017F>he comes
pre<U+017F>ently in what place <U+017F>oever it be. But <U+017F>ometimes, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> <U+017F>he returns our
la<U+017F>t words without ever being called, and it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he may be called in fifty
places at the <U+017F>ame time, how could <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wer all? But I will explain this to you:
Know that there were many Nymphs which were called <hi>Eccho.</hi> Fir<U+017F>t of all there
was <U+017F>he that loved <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> which for certain was changed into Voice, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wers
tho<U+017F>e that travel in the Country where <U+017F>he was metamorpho<U+017F>ed. Be<U+017F>ide that
there was one, an excellent Mu<U+017F>itian, and which we may rank among the antient <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomimes</hi>
who counterfeited the <U+017F>peech of all men, the cry of all bea<U+017F>ts, and the chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all birds: <hi>Pan</hi> fell in love with her, but could not obtain what he de<U+017F>ired;
<U+017F>he mo<U+017F>t unworthily <U+017F>corn'd him, and what is more, boa<U+017F>ted <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood Mu<U+017F>ick
better then he. That anger'd him <U+017F>o much, that he incited all the Shepherds to kill
her: They cut her body into infinite peeces, which they <U+017F>cattered through all the
world, le<U+017F>t they might be recompo<U+017F>ed again. But the Mu<U+017F>es which had been her
friends, ordered that they <U+017F>hould all imitate all manner of <U+017F>ounds, as <U+017F>he did while
<U+017F>he lived. <hi>Pan</hi> was thereby <U+017F>ufficiently puni<U+017F>hed: for whereas before <U+017F>he <U+017F>ham'd
him but in one place, <U+017F>he doth it now every where; and counterfeits not only the
<U+017F>ound of his <hi>Bagpipe,</hi> but al<U+017F>o that of divers other in<U+017F>truments whereon he could
never play: Thence it comes, that there are few places where there is not a Voice
that an<U+017F>wers us. But there is another thing worth your ob<U+017F>ervation, which I am
going to tell you. In one of the <hi>Fortunate I<U+017F>lands</hi> there was <U+017F>ometimes a very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Fairie,</hi> which having the tuition of the per<U+017F>ons of divers Princes and Knights
that were her friends, found out a means to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them <U+017F>uddenly in all manner of
dangers, and yet not go out of her palace: <U+017F>he by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>pirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd
a great quantity of Air, whereof <U+017F>he made many Conduits which <U+017F>he di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
into divers Cities, Mountains and Rivers, making them invi<U+017F>ible to all people;
and when <U+017F>he was to acquaint tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he affected with any thing, <U+017F>he acquainted
them by that means, <U+017F>o that in a <U+017F>mall time <U+017F>he gave them to know what was to
come, and gave them whol<U+017F>om advices, and they could al<U+017F>o an<U+017F>wer her the <U+017F>ame
way. But <U+017F>he departing the world, there was no body could make u<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>ecret,
though divers <hi>Magycians</hi> had try'd what they could doe in it. It is therefore come
to pa<U+017F>s, through the injury of time, that by little and little her long Conduits have
been <U+017F>pent and broken to peeces in divers places; and when men <U+017F>peak now, the
voice is carried thither, but it pre<U+017F>ently comes out again through the holes, as if it
were <U+017F>ome broken water-pipe, without going much further: If there be any places
where the voice is return'd to <U+017F>even times, the rea<U+017F>on is becau<U+017F>e it goes out of one
pipe into another near it. Let us now put all this together, that in one place the
Eccho of <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us</hi> an<U+017F>wers us, and in infinite others the members of the Eccho of
the God <hi>Pan,</hi> or the Channels of the <hi>Conduits.</hi> You would have me believe that,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ooner believe that I flie like <hi>Daedalus: Ovid</hi> never <U+017F>poke any
thing of this, you have it out of <U+017F>ome <hi>Apocryphal</hi> book: As long as the <hi>De<U+017F>tinies</hi>
<U+017F>hall be imployed to <U+017F>pin out the thread of my dayes, I <U+017F>hall credit what the good
<hi>old</hi> Authors <U+017F>ay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> who was a very under<U+017F>tanding per<U+017F>on, and took it a kind of recreation
to contradict <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> re<U+017F>umed the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to this effect. Doe not you now run into
a new folly in <U+017F>peaking of the <hi>De<U+017F>tinies?</hi> You believe they have nothing el<U+017F>e to do
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43725:29"/>
but to <U+017F>pin out your life: mu<U+017F>t they not al<U+017F>o <U+017F>pin mine and all other mens? In what
manner do you di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of them? Tell me how they are all imployed. The fir<U+017F>t
holds the Di<U+017F>taff which hath the Flax on it, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>he wets her fingers and
twi<U+017F>ts the thread: The <U+017F>econd turns the Spindle to wind it upon: And the third is
to cut it with the Sci<U+017F><U+017F>ers. Very good, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> is not that a <U+017F>trange ab<U+017F>urdity?
The <hi>De<U+017F>tinies</hi> being always a <U+017F>pinning as long as the life of a man la<U+017F>ts, can hold but
one <U+017F>pindlefull at a time, and yet there are a hundred thou<U+017F>and lives that la<U+017F>t at the
<U+017F>ame time. Is it not the <U+017F>ame ca<U+017F>e as that of the Nymph <hi>Eccho,</hi> which you think
an<U+017F>wers all the world? He who fir<U+017F>t advanced the<U+017F>e two things, had he not a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowne<U+017F>s
in his brain? and <U+017F>o many Poets as there have been <U+017F>ince, have they not
been blinded and be<U+017F>otted to follow him without any examination? Take another
doctrine that I <U+017F>hall teach you. The <hi>De<U+017F>tinies,</hi> whether they are in heaven or in hel,
are indeed charg'd with the ordering of our dayes to come, which <hi>fate</hi> hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed;
but they have neither Flax nor Spindle: They have a great Pannier,
where there are almo<U+017F>t as many Silk-worms as there are men living on earth; all
the threads of them are drawn and placed on a pair of windles: The fir<U+017F>t turns it,
that it may be made into skains; the <U+017F>econd comes and cuts <U+017F>ometimes one, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another, with the <U+017F>hears; and the third makes provi<U+017F>ion of new ones, in <U+017F>tead
of tho<U+017F>e that are fini<U+017F>h'd or cut. Now the threads which are drawn from one only
worm, are to wind the lives of tho<U+017F>e that are of the <U+017F>ame linage; and when there
is no more <U+017F>ilk about the Bottom, it <U+017F>ignifies that race is at an end. There is yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
thing to be con<U+017F>idered, and that is, That for to determine a life 'tis not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olutely
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that the thread <U+017F>hould be cut, it happens often that it breaks, and
then it is that we d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not <U+017F>eem to portend. But it is to be ob<U+017F>erv'd that they are always the fine<U+017F>t threads
which break, as it happens here on earth that the men of the mo<U+017F>t piercing wits
live <U+017F>horte<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>I never heard any thing of all you have <U+017F>aid, then cry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly are pump'd out of <U+017F>ome modern Author, who is not followed by any
other.</p>
            <p>You are angry already, <U+017F>ayes <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> but there is a great deal more to come:
A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, that neither in what you have <U+017F>aid, nor in what I have, there is
any thing of truth. There is no <U+017F>uch thing as a Nymph <hi>Eccho</hi> that an<U+017F>wers us: 'tis
our own voice, which retained in <U+017F>ome concavity, returns again, as the light of the
<U+017F>un is retorted by the reflexion of the place where it ca<U+017F>ts its rayes. Nor is there
any <hi>Parque</hi> or <hi>De<U+017F>tiny:</hi> and it is only the plea<U+017F>ure of God, that makes our lives
longer or <U+017F>horter. But we will di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s that point for the pre<U+017F>ent, and talk of <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whence there <U+017F>hall not ari<U+017F>e <U+017F>o much conte<U+017F>tation between us. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who
would not <U+017F>eek the occa<U+017F>ion of a quarrel with a per<U+017F>on whom he had much need of,
was very well plea<U+017F>ed to change di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and thereupon asked where his Cou<U+017F>in
was. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> told him that he had left him at his hou<U+017F>e, where he had met a certain
friend that <U+017F>taid him: but that he would neither <U+017F>up nor lodg there, though he had
much intreated him; and that he was de<U+017F>irous to go to the Inn where he had <U+017F>et up
his hor<U+017F>e in the morning. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>wore by the god <hi>Pan</hi> that he would not go <U+017F>eek
him there, and that he would go back into a little Hut which he had cho<U+017F>en for his
habitation: conceiving that <hi>Adrian</hi> would doe nothing but importune him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into the <hi>City. An<U+017F>elme</hi> an<U+017F>wered him, that haply his per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions might be <U+017F>o
effectual with him, as that they <U+017F>hould induce him to turn <hi>Shepherd:</hi> He <U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome
likelihood of it: yet would he not return <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, <U+017F>aying the <U+017F>un was yet too

there hath been great <U+017F>carcity of Apples, unle<U+017F>s it be tho<U+017F>e which are of a vermilion
colour. I meditate thereon <U+017F>omwhat that is excellent and rare, <U+017F>uch as never fell into
the brains of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t knowing Shepherd of <hi>Lignon.</hi> But it's enough!
let us return to the village, it is now time; for if I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay here any longer,
I <U+017F>hould fear the lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ome of my <U+017F>heep, being not yet provided of a Dog for to
keep them. <hi>Let us go: behold the Sun lies him down in the waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> who de<U+017F>ired nothing <U+017F>o much as to get him away, <U+017F>eeing him in a good
humour, led him into the way to <hi>St Cloud:</hi> And to try the <U+017F>ubtilty of his <U+017F>pirit,
<U+017F>aid to him as they went along, But Shepherd! you have a <U+017F>trange opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Sun: you think he goes to bed in the <hi><U+017F>ea,</hi> and that he repo<U+017F>es him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43725:31"/>
there till the morrow that he <U+017F>hall ri<U+017F>e for to continue his wonted journy. That
indeed is it that I believe of it, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and who doth not the like betrayes
much ignorance. Con<U+017F>ider then a little thus thing, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> Behold, the
Sun <U+017F>ets on that <U+017F>ide, and to morrow he will ri<U+017F>e on the other, which is quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ite:
how is that done? There is as much way for to go thither, as he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>patch'd
before when he was above us: In what manner can he doe it, if he re<U+017F>t
him<U+017F>elf upon a bed in the <U+017F>ea which the <hi>Nereides</hi> had prepared for him, or if he <U+017F>tay
a banqueting with <hi>Neptune,</hi> as I believe you imagine? The bed or chair wherein
he is, doe they go forward while he <U+017F>tirs not out of the <U+017F>ame place? But be<U+017F>ides
that, how does he go to his <hi>Orient?</hi> is it athwart the Earth that he returns thither?
is that pierced through to make him a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age? We mu<U+017F>t grant it is <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wers
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> and though I have heard much talk of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> I do not believe there
are any other then tho<U+017F>e we <U+017F>ee when we look into a Well. I have not <U+017F>o great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to your new Maxims, as that for them to di<U+017F>credit <U+017F>o many good Authors,
from whom I learn that the Sun pa<U+017F><U+017F>es over the night in the <U+017F>ea: It's a thing <U+017F>o
univer<U+017F>ally received, that the <hi>Poets</hi> of this age doe not <U+017F>tick to avow it, though they
would di<U+017F><U+017F>ent from all that their Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors have <U+017F>aid. I will conte<U+017F>t no further
with you, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> Clear but my mind of one doubt: If the Sun be all night
in the <U+017F>ea, hidden in <U+017F>ome cave, how can he communicate his light to the Moon?
for they <U+017F>ay, that if <U+017F>he be <U+017F>ometimes full, and <U+017F>ometimes in her increa<U+017F>e, tis accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the Sun enlightens her. Oh the blind minds of mortals! <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Is it
not <U+017F>ufficiently known, that whereas there hath never been but one Sun in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
there hath always been an infinite number on earth? and that at pre<U+017F>ent there
is one that hath more light then a hundred thou<U+017F>and others, which is the divine
<hi>Charite?</hi> Tis from her that the <hi>Moon</hi> borrows her light, and <U+017F>he is much more
<hi>Sun</hi> then the <hi>Sun</hi> him<U+017F>elf on high: <U+017F>o that when the <hi>Marigold</hi> beholds her, it looks
<U+017F>traight up, and is ravi<U+017F>hed into an exta<U+017F>ie: It does not know on which <U+017F>ide it
<U+017F>hould direct its yellow and langui<U+017F>hing leaves, and which is the true Sun, that it
might follow it. Truly, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> this is <U+017F>uch a new <hi>A<U+017F>trologie,</hi> as <hi>Sacrobo<U+017F>co</hi>
never imagined: And you are able to comment on the Great <hi>Shepherds Calendar:</hi>
you can give the rea<U+017F>on of <hi>Ecclip<U+017F>es, Comets,</hi> and <hi>Meteors,</hi> and all other natural
effects, without having recour<U+017F>e to any thing but your <hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this di<U+017F>pute ended, they entred St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> and were pre<U+017F>ently at the Inn where
<hi>Adrian</hi> was lodg'd, which was ju<U+017F>t at the Towns end: There was a world of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
met them, all being a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at the <U+017F>trange habit of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and at the <U+017F>heep
which he drove before him: but no body dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay any thing to him, <U+017F>eeing him
with <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> who was there much re<U+017F>pected, as being a per<U+017F>on of quality. <hi>Adrian</hi>
who waited for them at the Inne-gate, received them very courteou<U+017F>ly, being very
joyfull that his Cou<U+017F>in came with <U+017F>o good a will. The fir<U+017F>t thing that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> did, was
to provide a Stable for his Flock: there was one pre<U+017F>ently a<U+017F><U+017F>igned him, where he
locks it up, and afterwards returns to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> who was talking with <hi>Adrian;</hi> and
taking him a<U+017F>ide, put him in mind of drawing the Picture of <hi>Charite,</hi> <U+017F>eeing he knew
her, and had the means to <U+017F>ee her often. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him that he had already
a Copper-peece for that purpo<U+017F>e, and that he would not re<U+017F>t till he had fallen in
hand with it. But I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it a very hard peece of work, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> For as a man
cannot behold the Sun but in a gla<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o a man cannot <U+017F>ee <hi>Charite</hi> but in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ents
her. Open my brea<U+017F>t, <hi><U+017F>econd Apelles!</hi> take out my Heart, her Figure is
therein engraved, That <U+017F>hall be thy Original. But what doe I <U+017F>ay! I have no <hi>heart</hi>
at all: and though I had, thou would<U+017F>t not commit that cruelty. Take example
from every thing that approaches the beauty of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: I will teach thee how
thou mu<U+017F>t guide thy <U+017F>elf in they work: Make fir<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e <hi>fine twi<U+017F>ts of gold</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
her head, tho<U+017F>e <hi>inevitable <U+017F>nares,</hi> tho<U+017F>e <hi>hooks,</hi> tho<U+017F>e <hi>charms,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e <hi>chains</hi>
which <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e <hi>hearts:</hi> Next paint me that <hi>Forehead,</hi> where <hi>Love</hi> is as it were <U+017F>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his <hi>Throne;</hi> below that put tho<U+017F>e two <hi>Bowes</hi> of <hi>Ebony,</hi> and under them
tho<U+017F>e two <hi>Suns</hi> which perpetually dart forth <hi>arrows</hi> and <hi>flames:</hi> And then in
the mid<U+017F>t <U+017F>hall ri<U+017F>e up that fair <hi>No<U+017F>e,</hi> which like a little Mountain <U+017F>eparates the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43725:31"/>
               <hi>Cheeks,</hi> and that not without rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>eeing they continually <U+017F>triving which <U+017F>hould
be the faire<U+017F>t, would <U+017F>ometimes or other fall out, if they were not <U+017F>eparated. Thou
<U+017F>halt make tho<U+017F>e <hi>pretty Cheeks,</hi> intermingled with <hi>Lilies</hi> and <hi>Ro<U+017F>es:</hi> And then that
little <hi>Mouth,</hi> whereof the <hi>Lips</hi> are <hi>branches</hi> of <hi>Coral.</hi> If it were decent to leave
them half open, thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t draw her <hi>Teeth,</hi> which are two <hi>rowes</hi> of <hi>fine Pearl.</hi>
But content thy <U+017F>elf with this, and afterwards there is only the <hi>Neck</hi> to doe, and
her fair <hi><U+017F>nowy Bo<U+017F>om.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had heard this fine di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, as he was a per<U+017F>on of the greate<U+017F>t
courte<U+017F>ie in the world, <U+017F>o he pre<U+017F>ently conceived an excellent Invention as to this
Picture: and being impatient till he were at his own hou<U+017F>e to fall about it, he took
leave of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> When he was departed, <hi>Adrian</hi> believing that the folly of his Cou<U+017F>in
proceeded from over-fa<U+017F>ting, had a mind to make him good cheer, and asked him if
he could not feed on a di<U+017F>h of <hi>Carps</hi> and <hi>Pikes,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it was Saturn-day. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idered
a little thereupon, and <U+017F>miling to him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>aid, The time is come that I <U+017F>hall
doe the gallantry which I erewhile boa<U+017F>ted I would: I will outvie the fidelity of
<hi>Sirenus</hi> and <hi>Celadon,</hi> and doe a thing that <U+017F>hall be eternally memorable. No, no,
Cou<U+017F>in, I am not for the Fi<U+017F>h you have named: Let me have a Di<U+017F>h of <hi>Gurnards,</hi>
<U+017F>ome <hi>Salmon,</hi> <U+017F>ome <hi>Shrimps,</hi> and <U+017F>ome <hi>Beetroot</hi> or <hi>Carrets:</hi> And for, Fruits, give
me only Cherries, and Apples of <hi>Calleville.</hi> And doe not believe that this is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my<U+017F>teries: I will eat nothing but what is <hi>red,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the fair <hi>Charite</hi> loves no
colour but that. Alas! what excellent my<U+017F>terie is this? <U+017F>ays <hi>Adrian:</hi> What <U+017F>hall
we doe, if we cannot find what you now ask for? I will rather <U+017F>tarve then eat any
thing el<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> the Dy is already ca<U+017F>t for't, I am re<U+017F>olv'd. And <U+017F>o going
into the Kitchin; Dear <hi>Comus,</hi> God of banquetting! <U+017F>ays he to the Cook, Let
me have what I have called for. <hi>Adrian</hi> being gone in with him, gave order for
the providing of <hi>Beet-roots</hi> and <hi>Crabs,</hi> for to plea<U+017F>e him; and <U+017F>o led him into a
Chamber where the cloth was laid. When he was there, he con<U+017F>idered it all over;
and finding all painted with <hi>red,</hi> he thought in him<U+017F>elf it was very well; but that
he would not lie there, unle<U+017F>s they brought in another Bed, becau<U+017F>e that which was
there was green: He went into another chamber, where finding a red one, he <U+017F>aid
he would have it removed into his own chamber. <hi>Adrian,</hi> who would not they
<U+017F>hould be at the pains to take it down, began to contradict him, and would have
him to <U+017F>upper without any further troubling him<U+017F>elf about that. But he told him,
he would by no means hear of it, and <U+017F>o made unto him this fair complaint: How?
Cou<U+017F>in, are you <U+017F>o barbarou<U+017F>ly minded, that you will not grant a Lover a <U+017F>mall <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
that he de<U+017F>ires? Ha! I <U+017F>ee now you have a heart of <U+017F>tone, and that a fair
Eye never touched you: Would you have me commit this crime, to make u<U+017F>e of any
other colour then that of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s? I will dye rather then offend that fair one:
if I have a thought guilty of it, it is a Traitor. But what do I dream on, <U+017F>tupid man
that I am! I wear the <U+017F>ame colour as the bed in my chamber, which I will pre<U+017F>ently
be rid of: <U+017F>hall it be <U+017F>aid that I pre<U+017F>erve it? No, no, my fortitude <U+017F>hew thy <U+017F>elf!
While he <U+017F>aid this, he took his <hi>Sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>-<U+017F>trings,</hi> which were green, and ca<U+017F>t them out at
the window: As for Garters, he had not any, for his Breeches came down below
the calf of his leg. Alas, what folly is this! <U+017F>ays <hi>Adrian:</hi> why doe you ca<U+017F>t away
tho<U+017F>e Strings, which might well have <U+017F>erved one of my little children? Now you
talk of Love, we <U+017F>hall have <U+017F>omwhat to doe with you: if you will have all <hi>red,</hi> you
mu<U+017F>t always have <hi>Dyers</hi> at your breech, or el<U+017F>e you mu<U+017F>t have your train after you
like <U+017F>ome great man. Cannot one <U+017F>leep as well in a <hi>green</hi> bed as another? O Cou<U+017F>in!
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> how extreamly are you mi<U+017F>taken! and all becau<U+017F>e you have not read good
<hi>Authors:</hi> I am confident you never medled with my <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> and that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read any thing but your <hi>Shop-books.</hi> Cannot you judge by what charms I am
forced to have an aver<U+017F>ion to this <hi>green</hi> bed? Be<U+017F>ides that it is not of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es
colour, doe not you <U+017F>ee that <hi>green</hi> is de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed for many rea<U+017F>ons? As long as Fruits
are <hi>green,</hi> they are not fit to be eaten; while the Wheat is <hi>green,</hi> it is not ready for
the <U+017F>ickle: Tho<U+017F>e which are defeated in a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, wear the <hi>green</hi> Bonnet; and
out of a certain contempt, all your <hi>Clo<U+017F>e-<U+017F>tool</hi> cu<U+017F>hions are of <hi>green</hi> Serge. But that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43725:32"/>
which is mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable, <hi>Green</hi> is the colour which the <hi>Turks</hi> honour, and we
mu<U+017F>t hate what tho<U+017F>e people love, as being bruit bea<U+017F>ts who know nothing of <hi>Love,</hi>
or a <hi>Shepherds</hi> life. As for <hi>red,</hi> the amiable colour, the fle<U+017F>h and blood which
<U+017F>u<U+017F>tain our life are of it, the lips and cheeks of <hi>Charite</hi> wear it. That is the rea<U+017F>on
<hi>I</hi> de<U+017F>ire that even my <hi>Sheets,</hi> my <hi>Table-cloaths,</hi> my <hi>Napkias,</hi> my <hi>Shirts,</hi> and my
<hi>Handkerchiffs</hi> might be <hi>red,</hi> if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible.</p>
            <p>As he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, there <U+017F>tood behind him a little <hi>Bar-boy,</hi> that had a Napkin on his
arm, and a little light Cap on: who asked him, Sir! would not you have a <hi>red No<U+017F>e</hi>
too? We have good wine in the hou<U+017F>e to <hi>paint</hi> it withall. At which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>miling,
an<U+017F>wered, Thou would<U+017F>t laugh, little <hi>Foot-boy</hi> of <hi>Ganymedes!</hi> Ob<U+017F>erve what <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ay,
and bring me <U+017F>omebody to change the Bed. This is hand<U+017F>om: For Gods <U+017F>ake,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Adrian,</hi> let him have his will.</p>
            <p>There came pre<U+017F>ently two Servant-maids, who took down the Cuatains and Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
of both Beds, and put the <hi>red</hi> into the Shepherds chamber. In the mean while
he fat down at the Table with his Cou<U+017F>in, and Supper was brought in: There were
<U+017F>ome <hi>Beet-roots</hi> fryed, and <U+017F>ome cold in a Sallad, whereof <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> fill'd his belly: but
as for the <hi>Crabs,</hi> <U+017F>eeing that within they were all white, and were only red without,
he left them for <hi>Adrian.</hi> There waited at the Table a good big Servant-maid, who
took the pot and the gla<U+017F>s for to give him to drink: but he perceiving it was white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine
that <U+017F>he fill'd, Take it away, <U+017F>ays he, <hi>Nymph</hi> of the <hi>Kitchin!</hi> it is not of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite's</hi>
colour: Give me <U+017F>ome <hi>Claret,</hi> fair <hi>Godde<U+017F>s</hi> of the <hi>Pottage-pot!</hi> or el<U+017F>e we <U+017F>hall
not be good friends. Nay, for this time he is <U+017F>omwhat in the right, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Adrian:
Evening red, and morning gray, denotes the Pilgrim a fair day.</hi> Men <U+017F>ay that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the <hi>weather:</hi> but for my part, <hi>I</hi> apply it al<U+017F>o to <hi>wine.</hi> Yet doe not ca<U+017F>t
away that wine, <hi>I</hi> pray, as you did your Shoo-<U+017F>trings: we mu<U+017F>t not abu<U+017F>e Gods
creatures. When <hi>Adrian</hi> had <U+017F>poken thus, they took order that Claret-wine <U+017F>hould
be brought him, whereof <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> drank with much <U+017F>atisfaction.</p>
            <p>Supper ended, he began to walk up and down without <U+017F>aying ought to any body;
and at length his Cou<U+017F>in prevail'd <U+017F>o far with him, that he put off his cloaths and
went to bed. A while after <hi>Adrian</hi> went out of that chamber, making all fa<U+017F>t, and
went to bed in another. His <hi>Ward</hi> had found him <U+017F>o much trouble, that he fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>leep
as <U+017F>oon as his head was laid on the pillow: but it was not <U+017F>o with the amorous
<hi>Shepherd,</hi> who imagined that his eyes were little <hi><U+017F>tars</hi> upon earth, and that they
ought to <hi>twinkle</hi> all night like tho<U+017F>e in heaven.</p>
            <p>But he was not the only man that was awake that night in <hi>St. Cloud:</hi> there were
a many more, to whom his company had been very <U+017F>erviceable. That <hi>Shepherd</hi>
whom he had <U+017F>poken to in the fields, had acquainted his Ma<U+017F>ter, who was a <U+017F>tupid
Country-Clown, with all the <U+017F>trange di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es which had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between them.
This fellow went and related all again to nine or ten of his own quality, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
thereof <U+017F>eiz'd a many zealous devout women. All the <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious multitude
addre<U+017F>s'd them<U+017F>elves to the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> who repeated the <U+017F>ame things divers times from
point to point: He not being wanting as to the relation, nor they as to audience.
He told them, that he who had come to him was <U+017F>o beautifull and <U+017F>o brave, that he
took him at fir<U+017F>t for an Angel: but that having foretold him <U+017F>o much mi<U+017F>chief, he
took him for <U+017F>ome Devil, who had gotten <U+017F>ome <U+017F>heep, and had a <U+017F>heep-hook in his
hand, <U+017F>o to appear le<U+017F>s terrible, and make him believe he was of his condition. In fine,
all that we can judge of what he hath <U+017F>aid to me, (goes he on) is, That that cur<U+017F>ed
Woman, which is here for to ma<U+017F><U+017F>acre all men, and bring the world to an end, can
be no other then the wife of <hi>Antichri<U+017F>t,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> believe that he whom <hi>I</hi> have <U+017F>poken
with is <hi>Antichri<U+017F>t</hi> him<U+017F>elf, for he boa<U+017F>ts that he can doe great matters. As the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
had <U+017F>aid thus, there was one Country-fellow more re<U+017F>olute then the re<U+017F>t, who
drew a<U+017F>ide <U+017F>ome of his companions, and remon<U+017F>trated to them, how that that man
<U+017F>hould not be credited <U+017F>o lightly, though he had always been of a good reputation;
and that the hone<U+017F>te<U+017F>t men did <U+017F>ometimes lye, whether out of hope of gain, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e.
Upon that account they all went to him, and made a world of que<U+017F>tions to him
for to try him. He <U+017F>eeing that they did not <U+017F>ufficiently credit his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, began to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43725:32"/>
weep of very grief, making this complaint. Alas, my good friends! what have <hi>I</hi>
done to you, that you <U+017F>hould doubt of what <hi>I</hi> tell you? <hi>I</hi> would to God it were not
<U+017F>o true! but <hi>I</hi> never lyed le<U+017F>s in my life.</p>
            <p>Pre<U+017F>ently a woman of the village, who thought her<U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t knowing among
them, interrupted him, and <U+017F>aid, Alack my friend <hi>Richard!</hi> tell me all: Saye<U+017F>t thou
not that this old <U+017F>he-Devil mu<U+017F>t kill all the men? Doubtle<U+017F>s, replies the Shepherd:
<hi>I</hi> have been told nothing that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould doe to the women. Alack! what great
pitty it is, replies the woman: what <U+017F>hall we doe here by our <U+017F>elves? what's a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
without a man? <U+017F>he is but a Spindle without Flax, or like an Oven without an
Oven-fork. 'Twere better <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould take <U+017F>ome of both, and that the <U+017F>horte<U+017F>t cut
were drawn who <U+017F>hould be eaten fir<U+017F>t. To the<U+017F>e fair complaints the other Go<U+017F><U+017F>ips
added others, and that with <U+017F>o much weeping and <U+017F>obbing, that the whole hou<U+017F>e
where they were did eccho again.</p>
            <p>The Shepherd <hi>Richard</hi> thinking to comfort them, bid them not be <U+017F>o much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
that they <U+017F>hould not be long without Husbands, for they <U+017F>hould go after them,
<U+017F>eeing the world was <U+017F>hortly to end. But <U+017F>hall that be by fire, <U+017F>ays the ma<U+017F>ter of the
hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>hall we all burn together? If <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould put wet <U+017F>heets on the top of my hou<U+017F>e
as <hi>I</hi> did when my neighbours hou<U+017F>e was a fire, <U+017F>hould not <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ave my <U+017F>elf? <hi>I</hi> fear me,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Richard,</hi> that we mu<U+017F>t be de<U+017F>troyed by water: methinks the vi<U+017F>ion threatened
<U+017F>uch a thing. And as he <U+017F>poke the word, a light appeared in the sky, which <U+017F>mit the
<U+017F>ight of all that were pre<U+017F>ent, and immediately it began to rain. Ah! we need no
more doubt of it, cry'd out a Waterman, behold the deluge approaches: <hi>I</hi> will go
to the river with a hor<U+017F>e, for to draw my Boat a<U+017F>hore; if <hi>I</hi> can, <hi>I</hi>'ll bring it up
to the top of my chimney, where <hi>I</hi> will expect till the water ri<U+017F>e to that height, and
that it carry me where God plea<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>As he had done <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, yet without any great de<U+017F>ire to doe it, the Ma<U+017F>ter of the
hou<U+017F>e's Son approving the invention, would needs practi<U+017F>e <U+017F>omewhat that were like
it. 'Twas a Lad of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ixteen years of age, of whom it might have been <U+017F>aid that
there were wi<U+017F>er at <U+017F>ix. Having gotten a great wa<U+017F>hing-tub, he made a <U+017F>hift to get it
up to the top of the hou<U+017F>e, and placed him<U+017F>elf in it as if it had been a Boat. All this
he did without <U+017F>peaking ought to any body, for fear <U+017F>ome body <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>pute with
him for the <U+017F>afety of this fine Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el. In the mean while the women altogether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortle<U+017F>s,
re<U+017F>olved among them<U+017F>elves to go to Mount <hi>Valerian</hi> to the <hi>Hermites,</hi>
and the men would doe the like, <U+017F>aying that the water could not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon ri<U+017F>e to the
top of that mountain, and that till then they <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>afe enough.</p>
            <p>Thereupon they had an infinity of excellent con<U+017F>iderations: A <hi>Churchwarden</hi> of
the Pari<U+017F>h that was there, came and made this complaint. Alas! to what purpo<U+017F>e
have we <U+017F>o much troubled our <U+017F>elves, my good Pari<U+017F>hioners, about the repairing and
adorning of our Church? is it not <U+017F>o much lo<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing <hi>Antichri<U+017F>t</hi> will convert it
into <U+017F>tables? Ah! how <U+017F>hould we have <U+017F>pared that pains, if we had known the
world <U+017F>hould end <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon? <hi>I</hi> who have quite new built my hou<U+017F>e, and have fa<U+017F>ted
<U+017F>o much to <U+017F>pare <U+017F>omewhat, had it not been better that <hi>I</hi> had enjoyed what God
hath <U+017F>ent me? Ah! how doth man purpo<U+017F>e, and God di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e! And you that dre<U+017F>s
the Vineyards, and have planted <U+017F>o many Stocks, you <U+017F>hall not drink of the wine, but
the dog of Antichri<U+017F>t <U+017F>hall devour it. Ought <hi>I</hi> not to think that he will <U+017F>hortly come,
<U+017F>eeing that when <hi>I</hi> went a while <U+017F>ince to <hi>Paris</hi> with <U+017F>ome Apricocks to my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
<hi>I</hi> heard <hi>his coming</hi> cry'd openly upon the <hi>New-bridge</hi> by the Almanack-<U+017F>ellers?
<hi>I</hi> wi<U+017F>h now <hi>I</hi> had bought the book of it: <hi>I</hi> remember <hi>I</hi> heard two or three leafs
of it read by one that held it: 'Twas the mo<U+017F>t terrible thing that can be imagined,
and it mu<U+017F>t needs have been <U+017F>ome new Prophet that had compo<U+017F>ed it. In fine, the
time of our ruine is come upon us: And yet my Go<U+017F><U+017F>ip, the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of the hou<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>ticks not to be ju<U+017F>t now driving a buck, and dreams not that the Linnen <U+017F>he wa<U+017F>hes
is only to wipe the mu<U+017F>taches of the great Tyrant that we expect.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e words were heard with as much attention as if they had been prophe<U+017F>ies;
and yet the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of the hou<U+017F>e for <U+017F>ook not her Bucking-tub: <U+017F>he was a woman <U+017F>o
re<U+017F>olved, that when <U+017F>he once began a thing, <U+017F>he would go through with it. The rain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43725:33"/>
which fell down abundantly did not <U+017F>trike <U+017F>o much fear into her as the others; and
being oblig'd to be <U+017F>till <U+017F>tooping near the fire, <U+017F>he thought not of any thing but her
work. But <U+017F>he had put into the fire a certain <U+017F>ort of wood that crackled after a
<U+017F>trange manner, and a great coal flew out of the fire and lighted on her coat:
Pre<U+017F>ently after feeling the heat, <U+017F>he cry'd out, Ah! I burn, I burn! the world will
be de<U+017F>troy'd by fire. He who was mo<U+017F>t amaz'd was her <U+017F>on, who was upon the top
of the hou<U+017F>e, where he had been <U+017F>ufficiently wet, and held his hands together, <U+017F>haking
his teeth in expectation of what <U+017F>hould happen. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he heard them cry,
that the world was not to peri<U+017F>h by water but by fire, his tran<U+017F>portation was <U+017F>o
<U+017F>trange, that he ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf down together with the Tub, which <U+017F>taid not much
after him, but <U+017F>oon tumbled down: And if by chance there had not been a dunghil
in the yard, whereon he fell, he had without di<U+017F>pute broke his neck. His fall was
ea<U+017F>ily perceiv'd, and every one hearing him cry, they went to <U+017F>uccour him, but they
found he had more fear then receiv'd hurt. All being entred into the hou<U+017F>e, one of
the Village <U+017F>pake the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ententious words: What doe we fear <U+017F>o much? if we dye
not to day, we <U+017F>hall dye to morrow, it is the way we mu<U+017F>t go <U+017F>ooner or later: Let
us not climb up on the tops of our hou<U+017F>es, nor yet to the mountains, and leave all
at random: Hang all! we <U+017F>hould be more jovial: It is enough that the <hi>Pedees</hi> of
<hi>Antichri<U+017F>t</hi> have the vintage of this year, let us not leave them the wine we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
let us rather drink it (my dear friends!) when we have taken a little of it, we
<U+017F>hall know no more care, we <U+017F>hall not think <U+017F>o much on our <U+017F>orrows, and we <U+017F>hall
die more gently.</p>
            <p>This advice being approved, the good man of the hou<U+017F>e went him<U+017F>elf down into
the Cellar, and all the re<U+017F>t follow'd him with tankerds and pitchers; and having
<U+017F>truck out the heads of the Pipes, they drank <U+017F>o much, that they in a manner knew
not what they did. Afterwards they brought to the women what wine, remain'd,
and they in like manner invited one the other to drink, <U+017F>aying at every word, Ah!
we'll bur<U+017F>t rather then leave a drop to the fornicator <hi>Antichri<U+017F>t.</hi> So all the wine
was drunk: which now failing, and not raining <U+017F>o much, it began to dawn. Their
fear began then to dimini<U+017F>h a little, and they were <U+017F>o bold as to go into the <U+017F>treet,
where they perceiv'd that all the water ran along the channel, which <U+017F>oon <U+017F>mother'd
all further fear of the deluge. But the wine flying up into their brains, furni<U+017F>h'd
them with a new re<U+017F>olution: And the mo<U+017F>t witty among them, laughing at the fear
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, tels them, that he could not conceive for what rea<U+017F>on they <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and how they could imagine the end of the world to be <U+017F>o neer: For (continued
he) we fear the Deluge and Antichri<U+017F>t both together: If all the Earth were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troy'd,
what <U+017F>hould that fal<U+017F>e Prophet have to doe here? You <U+017F>ee that all this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<U+017F>tand together: and <U+017F>eeing he mu<U+017F>t come at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>even years before the end
of the world, as I believe I have heard affirmed, we have yet <U+017F>ome time to
live.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e words were approved by all the rout, only there was a little grambling at
him that <U+017F>aid them, becau<U+017F>e he had <U+017F>o long <U+017F>tudied for this fine advice. Thereupon
tho<U+017F>e that were mo<U+017F>t drunk went and <U+017F>lept; and the re<U+017F>t hearing the la<U+017F>t toll to
<hi>Mattins,</hi> went to the celebration of a low Ma<U+017F>s. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> his Landlord, who was a
very good <hi>Catholick,</hi> was there al<U+017F>o. When they had done their prayers, they
came and acquainted him with what news they had. That Shepherd whom <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
had <U+017F>o terrified, de<U+017F>crib'd his habit and countenance, <U+017F>o that the Inne-keeper knew
whom they would <U+017F>peak of, and laughing <U+017F>aid, Alas, my friends, you are of a very
ea<U+017F>ie belief, to have credited what hath been told you not by an Angel, nor yet an
evil <U+017F>pirit, nor yet a wi<U+017F>e man, but the mo<U+017F>t fool of all men, and who the la<U+017F>t night
lodg'd at my hou<U+017F>e: I well know his madne<U+017F>s, and by and by you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee the truth
of it. As he <U+017F>pake thus, there were others in the Church, who <U+017F>aid it was true, that
<U+017F>uch a one as the Shepherd had de<U+017F>cribed lodg'd in his hou<U+017F>e, and that the la<U+017F>t night
they had <U+017F>een him go in there. The Country-people were hereby convinced they
had been deceiv'd, and were <U+017F>o a<U+017F>ham'd of it, that they would have given <U+017F>omwhat
they had not <U+017F>poken of the fear they had been in the night before. The Par<U+017F>on who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43725:33"/>
<U+017F>aw them talking with great attention, would needs know what the matter was:
which when they had related to him, he made a good exhortation to tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>tray'd
<U+017F>heep, and <U+017F>hew'd them how that they <U+017F>hould not believe Impo<U+017F>tors; and that
though there be nothing more certain then the la<U+017F>t Judgment, yet there is nothing
more uncertain then the time it <U+017F>hall be. Which done, he di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s'd them in peace
with his benediction.</p>
            <p>Being returned to the hou<U+017F>e where they had <U+017F>pent the night, they awoke tho<U+017F>e
that <U+017F>lept, and among the re<U+017F>t the good man of the hou<U+017F>e, whom they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with what they had learn'd. When he <U+017F>aw it was a Fool had cau<U+017F>ed all this
their fear, and that his Shephered had been the fir<U+017F>t deceiv'd, and had afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the re<U+017F>t, he became furiou<U+017F>ly angry, and <U+017F>tirr'd up all the company again<U+017F>t
him, <U+017F>o that they began to beat the poor fellow, and had murther'd him with their
fi<U+017F>ts, if he had not <U+017F>omwhat appea<U+017F>ed them by his <U+017F>ad complaints, making it appear
above all things that he had done nothing maliciou<U+017F>ly, and that all the hurt they
had received was that they had had a <U+017F>leeple<U+017F>s night of it; and that he was the cau<U+017F>e
of that good work they had done in <U+017F>erving of God, which was meritorious, and
whereof they <U+017F>hould one day receive the comfort. 'Tis true, replies his ma<U+017F>ter: but
thou do<U+017F>t not withall <U+017F>ay that all my good wine is by that means gone, Nor doe I
mean to lo<U+017F>e it, I intend tho<U+017F>e that have drunk it <U+017F>hall return it me. While he <U+017F>pake
that, he who had drunk the be<U+017F>t part was di<U+017F>gorging behind the door: 'Tis not in
that manner (continues he) that I would have it returned; you mu<U+017F>t all come to
proportion, of the Judge <U+017F>hall hear of it: Will you have me now drink nothing
but water, or that I <U+017F>end to the Tavern for da<U+017F>h'd wine? You mu<U+017F>t every one of
you pre<U+017F>ently carry me to your hou<U+017F>es, and give me of yours. He had no <U+017F>ooner
ended this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, but his wife pur<U+017F>ues with the choi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t injuries all tho<U+017F>e that had
drunk of their wine: So that to avoid the tempe<U+017F>t, which was more heavy then
that of the night, they left them there and went to their homes.</p>
            <p>The report of the Adventure was pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>pread abroad, and e<U+017F>pecially among
the Citizens of <hi>Paris</hi> who were at St. <hi>Cloud.</hi> They wi<U+017F>h'd the day <U+017F>omwhat further
<U+017F>pent, that they might <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e that had been <U+017F>o neatly deceiv'd. They came to
high Ma<U+017F>s: which ended, and they gone out of the Church, they were infinitely
jeer'd. Yet I know not which prevail'd more with them, whether the indignation
of having been <U+017F>o troubled all night, and of <U+017F>eeing them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>till a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted by <U+017F>o
many abu<U+017F>es, or the joy of being a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that the world <U+017F>hould not end <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as
they had believed, and that they had time enough for the Vintage. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi>
and <hi>Adrian</hi> were at Church, and were extremely a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at the troubles which
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had already cau<U+017F>ed in St. <hi>Cloud.</hi> But that need not <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange: For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
of greater under<U+017F>tanding then the people of a Country-village might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
if they were <U+017F>oberly entertained with the extravagances of <hi>Poetry;</hi> and there
would be many who would innocently believe what <U+017F>hould be told them of the <hi>fire,
ice, chains,</hi> and <U+017F>o many other imaginary puni<U+017F>hments of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate per<U+017F>ons. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elme</hi>
asked <hi>Adrian</hi> where he had left his Cou<U+017F>in? He an<U+017F>wer'd, that he was a-bed,
but that he had barracado'd him<U+017F>elf in his chamber; and when he had asked him
whether he would go to Ma<U+017F>s, he told him that he would re<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf yet a while:
<U+017F>o that he had left him, knowing that <U+017F>leep would doe him no hurt. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> was
of opinion that they <U+017F>hould go and <U+017F>ee whether he would ri<U+017F>e: And in this delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
they walked to the Inne, and went to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s chamber-door. <hi>Adrian</hi> opened
it with the Key, but it was bolted within. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> <U+017F>poke, and pray'd the amorous
Shepherd to let him in. Knowing pre<U+017F>ently the voice of his be<U+017F>t friend, he opened
to him: And having bidden good morrow to his Cou<U+017F>in and him, he put on his
cloaths, telling them for excu<U+017F>e for his not being more early, that all night he had
not put his eyes together, and that he began to be <U+017F>leepy at the break of day. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that is not well done, Cou<U+017F>in, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Adrian:</hi> there is no more Ma<U+017F><U+017F>es to be
<U+017F>aid and you cannot hear any to day. Think you that God hath any need of tho<U+017F>e
fancies wherewith you entertain your <U+017F>elf? Yet this is pa<U+017F>t, and there is no remedy:
But what (when I think on't) if you went to Church, would you go in that mask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43725:34"/>
habit which you put on? Think you that there are any Masks, or that they act
Comedies in a con<U+017F>ecrated place? Away with it pre<U+017F>ently, I will <U+017F>end for another
for you. I will never put on any other then this, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> And I pray content
your <U+017F>elf that I do not, as I did ye<U+017F>terday, de<U+017F>ire one all red. Then turning him to
<hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> he cry'd out, O dear friend! what have I not done <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>aw thee!
Know then that I have gone through the noble<U+017F>t adventure in the world, and that
I give checkmate to all the Lovers in <hi>Europe.</hi> The la<U+017F>t night I ate nothing but what
was <hi>red,</hi> and all my <hi>thoughts</hi> have been <hi>red.</hi> Am I not as good as my word, as to
what I boa<U+017F>ted to thee? 'Tis enough to have <U+017F>hewn by one time, that it came from
my invention to doe it: Henceforward I will eat of any thing, and will not be any
more <U+017F>crupulous as to <hi>colour;</hi> it <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffice me to wear always about me <U+017F>ome little
<hi>red</hi> Riband, in remembrance of <hi>Charite.</hi> But when I think on't, what an ample <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
will there be here to exerci<U+017F>e the pen that <U+017F>hall write my hi<U+017F>tory! where could
he have found a more noble matter? By this means <U+017F>hall not his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e have
tho<U+017F>e ornaments which are not <U+017F>een in other books?</p>
            <p>Having fini<U+017F>h'd this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, he <U+017F>ent to the Mercers for red Ribaning, and put
<U+017F>ome to his <U+017F>hoes in<U+017F>tead of the green which he had ca<U+017F>t away: And when he was
all cloath'd, he asked <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> whether he would come along with him into the
fields, for he was going to lead out his Flock to graze. I pray <U+017F>tir not hence, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Adrian,</hi> but let us dine: Be<U+017F>ides you are out of the <U+017F>tory; here is no Flock for you,
I have <U+017F>old it to the ma<U+017F>ter of the hou<U+017F>e, who cau<U+017F>es all to be kill'd, and perhaps
you <U+017F>hall eat your <U+017F>hare of them. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thereupon look'd into the Yard, and <U+017F>aw a
man cutting the throat of one of his <U+017F>heep: which put him into <U+017F>uch a choler, that
he cry'd out pre<U+017F>ently, Ah cruel Cou<U+017F>in! what have I done to thee, that thou
<U+017F>hould<U+017F>t deal thus with me! Thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>old my dear Flock to the<U+017F>e Barbarians, and
there they ma<U+017F><U+017F>acre it. Ah innocent <hi><U+017F>heep!</hi> you will be no more the witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of
my <hi>Loves.</hi> Alas! how was I delighted in your company! Yet I <U+017F>hould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
if they made you dye upon <U+017F>ome noble occa<U+017F>ion: And if they offered you
up at the Altar of <U+017F>ome God, that is the wor<U+017F>t could happen to you, nay you <U+017F>hould
have been re<U+017F>erved for a Sacrifice; you <U+017F>hould have had the honour at lea<U+017F>t to die
within <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tately Temple, whereas now you die on a dunghill in a filthy yard.
Ah Butcher! ah Executioner! <U+017F>tay the fury of thy knife, leave me <U+017F>ome to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
me. Ah! I <U+017F>ee that thou never wert a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and that thou never read<U+017F>t
the <hi>Apotegms</hi> of <hi>Era<U+017F>mus,</hi> where it is written, That the good Shepherd <U+017F>hears, but
doth not fley his <U+017F>heep. Ah poor Innocents! that I have not here a <hi>Chalmia,</hi> to
celebrate your death in <U+017F>ad and Elegiack <hi>Ver<U+017F>es!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cea<U+017F>e your complaints, <U+017F>ayes <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> taking him a<U+017F>ide: You mu<U+017F>t not afflict
your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much for the death of Bea<U+017F>ts. We are not Di<U+017F>ciples of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> nor
doe we believe as he did, that the <U+017F>oul of our Grandfather is in the body of a Calf.
Why doe Shepherds breed up Sheep, but to <U+017F>ell them? we may have others in
<U+017F>tead of tho<U+017F>e: And if we <U+017F>hould have none at all, is it a prodigie to <U+017F>ee a <hi>Shepherd</hi>
without a <hi>Flock?</hi> it <U+017F>uffices that he <U+017F>ometimes hath had one. A Gentleman that
hath had Souldiers under his conduct, is <U+017F>till called Captain, though his Troops be
disbanded, becau<U+017F>e he hath <U+017F>hew'd him<U+017F>elf capable of being <U+017F>o. You <U+017F>peak well,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> And when I think on't, I <U+017F>aw you ye<U+017F>terday in the fields that you had
no Flock, yet I call'd you Shepherd: I have always believ'd you to be one, for
you <U+017F>peak with a <hi>Courtezy,</hi> which is not common but to <hi>us. An<U+017F>elme</hi> unwilling
to humour him then, <U+017F>aid to him, You were mi<U+017F>taken in calling me Shepherd,
for I am not one; and there is no per<U+017F>on of quality in the Country that is <U+017F>o,
unle<U+017F>s it be you. I doe not de<U+017F>ire you <U+017F>hould call me otherwi<U+017F>e then <hi>An<U+017F>elme;</hi> and
for my qualities, there is not any one I more e<U+017F>teem then that of your Friend and
Servant. Have you not <U+017F>een that they are only Country-Clowns that keep Sheep
all hereabouts? I grant what you <U+017F>ay, courteous <hi>An<U+017F>elme!</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but my
de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>hould be to re<U+017F>tore to its <U+017F>plendor that happy condition, and to cau<U+017F>e that
the mo<U+017F>t noble and rich per<U+017F>onages <U+017F>hould not di<U+017F>dain it; to the end that men may
no longer <U+017F>tudy how to plead and wage war, and that they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak no more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43725:34"/>
of any thing but <hi>Love.</hi> Would not you willingly <U+017F>econd me in it? When men <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>ee us both of an opinion, will not every one imitate us? Let us now talk a little of
this, now the time is propitious, and that <hi>Adrian</hi> is gone down to <U+017F>ee if dinner be
ready. That I may conceal nothing from you, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> know that it would
be very ill look'd upon to turn Shepherds in a place <U+017F>o neer <hi>Paris</hi> as this, whither
all the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians</hi> ordinarily come. We are not far enough from <hi>ambition</hi> and <hi>avarice</hi>
to lead <U+017F>uch an <hi>innocent</hi> life: were it not for that, I <U+017F>hould be of the de<U+017F>ign. Is there
<U+017F>o much to do, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is?</hi> For to <U+017F>horten the pains which we <U+017F>hall have to per<U+017F>wade
a people to receive new cu<U+017F>toms, let us go into a place where tho<U+017F>e which we would
follow have been already practi<U+017F>ed: There are many Countries in the world where
men live in a <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> way: Let us go into <hi>Arcadia,</hi> gentle <hi>An<U+017F>elme!</hi> it is a Country
much e<U+017F>teem'd by the Gods, they ordinarily live there among men. We mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s
the Sea to go thither, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> and I doe not love to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>hips but in the haven;
<hi>I</hi> would not be in a place whence a man cannot come away when he plea<U+017F>es, nor get
on a hor<U+017F>e which a man can lead by the tail. When one is there, he is much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <U+017F>ay, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hake, <hi>I</hi> am afraid, <hi>I</hi> am ill at the heart! <hi>I</hi> would return to our hou<U+017F>e!
No body hears you; or if any do, they abu<U+017F>e you. Let us go then, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
into the Plains of <hi>Leon,</hi> along the River <hi>Ezla,</hi> where the di<U+017F>graced <hi>Sirenus</hi> hath <U+017F>hed
<U+017F>o many tears. That is yet too far, <U+017F>ays, <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> and be<U+017F>ides, we <U+017F>hall not agree
well with the arrogant humour of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> You will then <U+017F>tay in <hi>France,</hi> <U+017F>ays
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Well then, there is nothing but may be done. <hi>I</hi> know many Provinces where
there are brave Shepherds. <hi>I</hi> have lately read a book called the <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals</hi> of <hi>Ve<U+017F>per,</hi>
wherein are de<U+017F>crib'd the Loves of certain Shepherds of <hi>Tourain?</hi> Shall we go into
that Country? they <U+017F>ay it is the Garden of <hi>France.</hi> Yet let me tell you, the<U+017F>e Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
who<U+017F>e hi<U+017F>tory <hi>I</hi> have <U+017F>een live a little too ru<U+017F>tickly for us: There is nothing
commendable in them, unle<U+017F>s it be that they love faithfully. What doe <hi>I</hi> dream on
all this while, or have <hi>I</hi> re<U+017F>erved it as the be<U+017F>t till la<U+017F>t! 'Tis into the Country of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>ts</hi>
that we mu<U+017F>t go, near the antient City of <hi>Lyons</hi> on the we<U+017F>t-<U+017F>ide: There we
<U+017F>hall find the <hi>Druid Adamas,</hi> who di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>es with much of his gravity, the better to
entertain <U+017F>trangers: We <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee <hi>Celadon, Sylvander,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>traea,
Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis. I</hi> leave it to you to imagine how much we <U+017F>hall be taken with
their conver<U+017F>ation, <U+017F>eeing the relation of their Hi<U+017F>tory is <U+017F>o noble, that in reading it
<hi>I</hi> have often wept for joy. But how confident am <hi>I</hi> to refute the rea<U+017F>ons of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>tant
<hi>Hylas,</hi> and di<U+017F>pute again<U+017F>t him with more heat then <hi>Sylvander!</hi> And if he
do not confe<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf vanqui<U+017F>h'd by my words, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>wear to you that <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tain
from blows; for <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould not brook it, that that little Ra<U+017F>cal <U+017F>hould deride the
fidelity of <hi>Thyr<U+017F>is.</hi> Moreover <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall not appear there as a <U+017F>tranger; for <hi>I</hi> know all
that is pa<U+017F>t there the<U+017F>e many years, and the Shepherds <U+017F>hall not relate their Loves to
me. It is more then three years that <hi>I</hi> conceiv'd my <U+017F>elf among them, for <hi>I</hi> was in a
company where the young men and maids took their names out of <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> and our
entertainment was a perpetual <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral:</hi> in<U+017F>omuch that <hi>I</hi> may truly <U+017F>ay that it was
there <hi>I</hi> went to School to learn to be a <hi>Shepherd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> hearing this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, had much ado to keep from laughing, yet could
he not but make <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> this an<U+017F>wer: <hi>I</hi> am willing to go into <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts, I</hi> know that
the <U+017F>ojourn wil be very delightful, and <hi>I</hi> doubt not but we <U+017F>hall find there abundance
of <hi>Shepherds</hi> and <hi>Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es:</hi> but as for tho<U+017F>e whom you name, it is mo<U+017F>t certain
we <U+017F>hall not meet them there; they lived in the time of <hi>Mercueur,</hi> reckon how long
it may be <U+017F>ince they are dead. How <U+017F>ay you! replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> doe you affirm that
in je<U+017F>t, or for want of judgment? The Author of the Pa<U+017F>torals of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> doth he
not dedicate an Epi<U+017F>tle in the beginning of his fir<U+017F>t book to the Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi>
and in the <U+017F>econd another to the Shepherd <hi>Celadon?</hi> Doth he not <U+017F>peak to them as
to per<U+017F>ons yet alive? Be<U+017F>ides, do you not <U+017F>ee that their hi<U+017F>tory is not yet fini<U+017F>h'd?
<hi>Celadon</hi> hath not obtain'd the favour of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: He per<U+017F>onates <hi>Alexis</hi> in the
fourth and la<U+017F>t book of him, who hath begun to put down his adventures in writing:
For as to what may be in the Books which others have written of it <U+017F>ince, or may do
hereafter, as if they proceeded from the true Hi<U+017F>torian of <hi>Lignon, I</hi> am not obliged
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43725:35"/>
to believe them. <hi>I</hi> think, if <hi>Celadon</hi> had married <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> or had dyed, as you <U+017F>ay, the
Author of this Hi<U+017F>tory would have mentioned it; and that is it confirms my belief
the more.</p>
            <p>It mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uppos'd that <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> would have been much to blame, if he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to deprive <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> of <U+017F>uch a rare and excellent opinion, therefore did he not
attempt it, but humour'd him in it, to make more <U+017F>port with him; affirming that all
he <U+017F>aid did more and more heighten his de<U+017F>ire to be a Shepherd as he was, but that
there was one thing troubled his mind extremely, which was, That if they <U+017F>hould go
to <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> they mu<U+017F>t quit the conver<U+017F>ation of the fair <hi>Charite,</hi> without which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
could not live. He an<U+017F>wered, that he had much con<U+017F>idered it; but that he hoped
the fir<U+017F>t time he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak to her, he would u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a charming per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion to
her, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>ent to go with them and turn <hi>Shepherde<U+017F>s. An<U+017F>elme</hi> <U+017F>aid
that were very well, if it could be obtained. And thereupon in comes <hi>Adrian,</hi> with
the people of the hou<U+017F>e after him bringing up Dinner. He bade <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> make ha<U+017F>te to
dine, that he might take him along with him to <hi>Paris,</hi> <U+017F>aying that his hou<U+017F>e was all
in di<U+017F>order when he was not at home, con<U+017F>idering his wife was not of the be<U+017F>t hou<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes;
the Prenti<U+017F>es were in league with the Servant-Maid, who would give them
the key of the Cellar to drink up his wine; and if <U+017F>he would not give it them, they
would go down half way the well, and pa<U+017F>s through a little window which was there
for to vi<U+017F>it his Pipes. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> an<U+017F>wered, There needed not <U+017F>o many words; that he
might go if he would; that as for his part, he would not live any longer under his
tuition, and that he was big enough to be without Guardian or Curator. <hi>Adrian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
he would <U+017F>tay there and continue in his follies, told him that if he would not
go by fair means, he would carry him away by foul; that it was not <U+017F>o hard a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to find a Coach, wherein he <U+017F>hould be chained and fetter'd; and that when they
were at <hi>Paris,</hi> he would clap him in pri<U+017F>on at <hi>St. Martins,</hi> where he <U+017F>hould be whipt
every day; or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>end him to the Almshou<U+017F>e, to keep company with <U+017F>uch fools as
they di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e thither. At that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was extremely angry, and his Cou<U+017F>in was no
le<U+017F>s: but <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> by his prudence reconciled all; telling <hi>Adrian</hi> in particular, that
as he had already remon<U+017F>trated, the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the Young-man could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by rigor, and that it were better to humour him. So that he conjur'd him
to leave him to his cu<U+017F>tody a moneth or two, and he would de<U+017F>ire nothing for his
entertainment. <hi>Adrian</hi> believing it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, for the <hi>di<U+017F>-<U+017F>hepherding</hi> of him,
that he <U+017F>hould be with <U+017F>ome hone<U+017F>t man which would acquaint him with the world,
con<U+017F>ented to leave him to his care, <U+017F>eeing he was willing to venture the trouble of
his importunity; and promi<U+017F>ed him a world of <U+017F>ervices in requital.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> having obtain'd his de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>ate at Table with them, and there was no
di<U+017F>pute while they were at dinner: Only <hi>Adrian</hi> told <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that he had re<U+017F>olved to
leave him with <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> and charg'd him to obey him in all things as his ma<U+017F>ter and
benefactor. He promis'd him he would not fail, and <U+017F>eem'd very joyfull to be left in
<U+017F>o good company. After dinner the <hi>Merchant</hi> took hor<U+017F>e; and leave taken, return'd
to <hi>Paris.</hi> He was in hope the good di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> would conduce much to
reform that of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and he gave all the kindred this account of him, that they
<U+017F>hould have more comfort for the time to come, then they had had before. Yet
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> tran<U+017F>ported with the impetuo<U+017F>ities of Youth, which loves nothing <U+017F>o much
as to pa<U+017F>s away the time merrily, would not task him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon to take away his
fancies; and in him<U+017F>elf accu<U+017F>ed <hi>Adrian</hi> of a great inju<U+017F>tice in de<U+017F>iring to deprive the
world of the mo<U+017F>t excellent Fool that ever was; believing that if he <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>tore
him to his under<U+017F>tanding, it would have been a hard matter to reduce him to his
folly. He re<U+017F>olved therefore to make <U+017F>port with him as long as he <U+017F>hould remain in
the Country, being rich enough to give him his entertainment. And as our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
is never perfect, if our friends are ignorant we receive it, and do not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of it, he re<U+017F>olved to recommend to all his Acquaintance this gentle Per<U+017F>onage,
when he thought it convenient. Having made him quit the Inne, he led him through
a many <U+017F>treets, to bring him to his own hou<U+017F>e. They were met by <U+017F>ome who knew
what had happened to the Country-people, who had <U+017F>o much fear'd the end of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43725:35"/>
world. They <U+017F>aw well enough that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was he that had been the cau<U+017F>e of it. His
extraordinary habit which had been de<U+017F>cribed to them, ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>covered him. The
novelty of his clothing, and of his proportion'd gate, obliged to follow him all the
Town<U+017F>men of <hi>S. Cloud,</hi> who were then in the <U+017F>treets. They who had already <U+017F>een him
ran a great way before, that they might <U+017F>ee him pa<U+017F>s by again: the Boys throug'd
at his heels, making a noi<U+017F>e as tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Paris</hi> do at the riding of a man beaten by his
wife. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> could not make them be quiet; and they had not <U+017F>o good luck as
they had had the day before, when they were not followed by any, it being a working
day. This malicious rout ca<U+017F>t <U+017F>tones at <hi>Lyfis;</hi> <U+017F>o that receiving <U+017F>ome hurt by one
in his back, he could endure no longer, and turning back with his hat in his hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
tho<U+017F>e that followed him, he <U+017F>aid, Sirs! leave off your conduct of me, <hi>I</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t
you <U+017F>hall go no further; <hi>I</hi> be<U+017F>eech you no further ceremony; <hi>I</hi> take the favour
for received.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e words amaz'd both great and <U+017F>mall, who under<U+017F>tood no more the one then
the other; and with the menaces which <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> us'd at the <U+017F>ame time, it prevail'd
with them to retire. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> admired the natural ingenuity of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and this
was haply one of the be<U+017F>t things had ever been heard from him. Being come home,
he a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd him a pretty Chamber; and having left him certain <hi>Books,</hi> he de<U+017F>ired
him to pa<U+017F>s away the afternoon in reading, while he in the mean time would go
vi<U+017F>it certain per<U+017F>ons whither he thought not fit to bring him along.</p>

no further with them; but in the mid<U+017F>t of his fond ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
would take a walk in the Garden. And indeed he
found not any Books that pleas'd him, they being <hi>Seneca,
Plutarch, Du Vair, Montagne</hi> and <hi>Charon,</hi> which do not
<U+017F>peak any thing of <hi>Romance.</hi> He affirmed that all was worth
nothing; and that it was only <hi>Plutarch</hi> that he valued a little, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aid <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
had been a <hi>Shepherd</hi> in his youth. When he had been at lea<U+017F>t two hours in
the Garden, he had a great de<U+017F>ire to go abroad, though <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had pray'd him
not to doe it by any means. He found a little door, who<U+017F>e lock was not of the <U+017F>trong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>o that he ea<U+017F>ily opened it with a knife: It went out into a narrow <U+017F>treet, where
he had not gone twenty paces, but he perceives that <U+017F>o fair <hi>Charite,</hi> the <U+017F>ource of
his de<U+017F>ires, who was returning all alone from <U+017F>ome hou<U+017F>e where <hi>Angelica</hi> had <U+017F>ent
her of an errand. However this recontre a little <U+017F>urpriz'd him, yet did he not
appear <U+017F>o fearfull; and having an intention to <U+017F>peak to her, he cho<U+017F>e rather to go
towards her, then expect her. But pre<U+017F>ently a huge Country Clout-<U+017F>hoe, who lay,
as it were in ambu<U+017F>h for her at <U+017F>ome door, came and ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf on her, <U+017F>aying,

of a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o unworthy her, ran as fa<U+017F>t as he could for to re<U+017F>cue her: But before he
could come at her, <U+017F>he had been already ki<U+017F>s'd above ten times, whatever re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance
<U+017F>he could make. Which put him into <U+017F>uch a fury, that lifting up a <U+017F>tick he had in his
hand, he di<U+017F>charg'd it about the ears of the Fellow; crying out, How now, filthy
<hi>Satyre!</hi> who hath taught you to be <U+017F>o pre<U+017F>umptuous, as to profane the Coral of
that fair Mouth? Go and profe<U+017F>s love to <U+017F>he Goats, <U+017F>tinking Bea<U+017F>t! The Clown
feeling him<U+017F>elf hurt, di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s'd <hi>Charite,</hi> and flew at the collar of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> He took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his <U+017F>taff, and did <U+017F>o mea<U+017F>ure his <U+017F>ides therewith, that he was convinc'd his <U+017F>afety
lay in his feet; but the other pur<U+017F>uing fa<U+017F>tned with him again, and threw him down,
in which po<U+017F>ture he gave him three or four kicks. He had be<U+017F>towed a little more on
him, had he not perceiv'd <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> coming with two Lacquays after him; which <U+017F>o
frighted him, that he took his heels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being ri<U+017F>en up, <U+017F>aw <hi>An<U+017F>elme;</hi> and going as gently as if he had had all his
bones bruis'd, went to tell him. Ah! that you had not come <U+017F>ooner! You might
have a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted me again<U+017F>t a <hi>Goat-footed</hi> god, which thought to have killed me. He
would have forced <hi>Charite.</hi> and I endeavoured to deliver her out of his hands, or
rather paws. The truth is, <U+017F>he got away while we were fighting: but indeed I have
got good blows, and have not reliev'd her but at the co<U+017F>t of my <U+017F>ides. What could
I do again<U+017F>t him alone? The<U+017F>e <hi>Fawns</hi> are much <U+017F>tronger then men: they have the
advantage in all things; and if your people <U+017F>hould have run after this, they could
not have overtaken him; he is as <U+017F>wift as tho<U+017F>e hor<U+017F>es which they <U+017F>ay that the wind
<hi>Boreas</hi> had engendred. I am very much troubled at this unhappy adventure, <U+017F>ays
<hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> but it is your own fault, you <U+017F>hould not have gone abroad, I had de<U+017F>ired
you as much. The rea<U+017F>on of it is, that in the<U+017F>e parts they under<U+017F>tand not what <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds</hi>
of your quality mean: You <U+017F>aw a while ago, that I had much ado my<U+017F>elf to
defend you: And henceforward if we go out together, we will be <U+017F>ure to be well
train'd. I had not a while ago my <U+017F>ervants about me, becau<U+017F>e I make no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
here to walk abroad all alone, as well as at <hi>Paris,</hi> where there is more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
required: But now I <U+017F>ee it is not ami<U+017F>s for a man to have always people about
him. But I pray tell me, why do you believe that he you fought with was a <hi>Satyre?</hi>
I perceived him a little, and he <U+017F>eem'd to me as proper a Country-fellow as any
hereabouts: He had breeches and doublet on, and do not you know that the <hi>Satyrs</hi>
go all naked? Alas, how are you out of the way! replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> have you not well
ob<U+017F>erved that it was a <hi>Satyre</hi> di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed? He had only taken the garb of a Country-fellow,
the more freely to come into this Town, and carry away <hi>Charite.</hi> For my
part, I am certain his feet were cloven; and his doublet being unbutton'd, and his
<U+017F>hirt open, I <U+017F>aw his brea<U+017F>t was all hairy: And if all this were not <U+017F>o, the deformity
of his countenance <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>covered him. Well then, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> I grant you
it was a <hi>Satyre,</hi> you have fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t him better then I: Let us now <U+017F>ee whether you are
much hurt. Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he conducted him home to his hou<U+017F>e, where the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi>
being well <U+017F>tretched and chaf'd, perceiv'd his hurt not <U+017F>o great as he had ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined:
And when they asked him which <U+017F>ide pain'd him mo<U+017F>t, he pointed to the
right <U+017F>ide; but the people a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him that they could not perceive any brui<U+017F>e
there, Then (<U+017F>aid he) I think 'tis the other. To cure him perfectly of his imaginary
evil, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> cau<U+017F>ed him to be rubb'd all over with a certain Unguent that did him
neither good nor hurt; and in the mean time while Supper was preparing, he went
and <U+017F>hut him<U+017F>elf into his Cabinet for to perfect <hi>Charite's</hi> Picture, whereon he had
been at work from betimes in the morning.</p>
            <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he had done, he returned to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and being both at <U+017F>upper, he told
him that he had fini<U+017F>h'd his work. This news put him into that impatience, that his
Ho<U+017F>t was fain to <U+017F>horten his meal to half of his wont, that he might <U+017F>hew him that
<U+017F>o excellent Peace. The Study being opened, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> entred therein with as much
re<U+017F>pect and veneration as if it had been a Temple; and <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> <U+017F>hewing him the
Copper-piece whereon he had wrought, our pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Lover beheld it a long time
with an extreme attention: But at la<U+017F>t crying out like one amaz'd, he <U+017F>aid, I do
not apprehend this, <hi>An<U+017F>elme!</hi> You have mi<U+017F>taken, and given me one Picture in<U+017F>tead
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43725:37"/>
of another. You are deceiv'd, an<U+017F>wers he: Do not you <U+017F>ee well enough by this
candle we have; or will you have me cau<U+017F>e four or five more to be brought, that
<U+017F>o you may the better <U+017F>ee how to judge of the Picture? Are you <U+017F>o blind, that you
do not perceive this to be the face of <hi>Charite?</hi> and that <hi>Du Mou<U+017F>tier</hi> him<U+017F>elf could
not draw it better? But how do you conceive it? replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I <U+017F>ee there are
Chains, and Suns, and Flowers; 'tis not a Face. I will make you under<U+017F>tand all
in one word, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> Do not you <U+017F>ee that I have done all according to your
directions, and that I have repre<U+017F>ented all the features of <hi>Charite's</hi> beauty in the
<U+017F>ame manner as you have expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them to me? Whereupon <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> di<U+017F>covering
the artifice of the excellent Painter, began to ob<U+017F>erve in order all the parts of the
Picture, which had amaz'd him when at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight he beheld them all confu<U+017F>edly.
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s acted a piece of ingenious knavery; ob<U+017F>erving what the
Shepherd had told him of the beauty of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and imitating the extravagant
de<U+017F>criptions of the Poets, he had painted a Face, which in<U+017F>tead of being of a <hi>fle<U+017F>h</hi>-colour,
was of a complexion white as <hi><U+017F>now;</hi> There were two branches of <hi>Coral</hi> at
the opening of the <hi>Mouth;</hi> and upon each <hi>Cheek</hi> a <hi>Lilly</hi> and a <hi>Ro<U+017F>e,</hi> cro<U+017F><U+017F>ing one
the other: Where there <U+017F>hould have been <hi>Eyes,</hi> there was neither <hi>white</hi> nor <hi>apple,</hi>
but two <hi>Suns</hi> <U+017F>ending forth <hi>beams,</hi> among which were ob<U+017F>erved certain <hi>flames</hi> and
<hi>darts:</hi> The <hi>Eye-brows</hi> were <hi>black</hi> as <hi>Ebony,</hi> and were made like two <hi>Bows,</hi> where
the Painter had not forgotten to expre<U+017F>s the <hi>holding-place</hi> in the middle, that they
might the better be ob<U+017F>erved: Above that was the <hi>Forehead,</hi> <U+017F>mooth as a piece of
<hi>Ice;</hi> at the top of which was <hi>Love,</hi> like a little Child, <U+017F>eated in his throne. And to
add perfection to the work, the <hi>Hair</hi> floted about all this in divers manners: <U+017F>ome
of it was made like <hi>Chains</hi> of <hi>Gold;</hi> other-<U+017F>ome twi<U+017F>ted, and made like <hi>networks;</hi>
and in many places there hanged <hi>lines,</hi> with hooks ready baited. There were a many
<hi>Hearts</hi> taken with the bait, and one bigger then all the re<U+017F>t, which hang'd down
below the <hi>left</hi> Cheek, <U+017F>o that it <U+017F>eem'd to <U+017F>upply the place of a <hi>Pendant</hi> to that rare
<hi>Beauty.</hi> This is mine own <hi>Heart!</hi> cries out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> when he <U+017F>aw it: I know it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
How judiciou<U+017F>ly is it placed in this part! Now that it is <U+017F>o near <hi>Charite's</hi>
Ear, it will continually repre<U+017F>ent unto her my <hi><U+017F>ufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have I not had rea<U+017F>on to conceive that you would like my work very well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>An<U+017F>elme?</hi> I can without vanity affirm that the fancie is incomparable. There
was never any that found out the way of painting the beauties of faces by a <hi>Poetical</hi>
figure: This ought to be called a Picture by <hi>Metaphor.</hi> Let me embrace you, my
dear friend! <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> after a little recollection apart: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s you have
given an incomparable proof of your ingenuity. That beautifull face of <hi>Charite</hi>
could not be painted but by <hi>Metaphor.</hi> We had before con<U+017F>idered that the<U+017F>e fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
could not be repre<U+017F>ented naturally. O Painter more excellent then <hi>Apelles,
Protogenes,</hi> and <hi>Parrha<U+017F>ius!</hi> I do not judge this a Mon<U+017F>ter, as I did erewhiles: I
hold it a thing extreme rational, and very full of art.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>atisfaction of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> di<U+017F>covered it <U+017F>elf by a many <U+017F>uch other expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions;
and as for the excellent Picture, he would pre<U+017F>erve it as long as he lived. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi>
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed it into a Box, le<U+017F>t it might receive any hurt; and then it was he received
the highe<U+017F>t thanks that could be for the pains he had taken. As he was ruminating
on his invention, he <U+017F>aid to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that as they had <hi>metaphorically</hi> repre<U+017F>ented the
fair <hi>Charite,</hi> <U+017F>o might be painted any ill-favoured woman. She <U+017F>hould have on a
<hi>Perriwig</hi> of <hi>Serpents</hi> like <hi>Megaera;</hi> or if <U+017F>he might be allowed <hi>hair,</hi> they <U+017F>hould be
<hi>big,</hi> and <U+017F>tanding <hi>upright</hi> like the bri<U+017F>tly head of a <hi>Wild-Bore:</hi> At which there <U+017F>hould
be <hi>chained</hi> nothing but <hi>Lice</hi> and <hi>Nits.</hi> Her <hi>Eyes</hi> <U+017F>hould be like two wa<U+017F>hed <hi>Prunes,</hi>
about which there <U+017F>hould be a quantity of <hi>birdlime</hi> for to catch the <hi>Files</hi> that <U+017F>hould
come neer it. Her <hi>Mouth</hi> <U+017F>hould be like the <U+017F>hutting of a <hi>Carriers pouch;</hi> and the
<hi>Complexion</hi> <U+017F>hould be like the <hi>folds</hi> of an old <hi>Boot.</hi> And <U+017F>o for the re<U+017F>t, which I refer
to the con<U+017F>ideration of more excellent wits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thought all this very ingenious, yet nothing witne<U+017F>s'd his approbation but
a <U+017F>hort <U+017F>mile; becau<U+017F>e indeed he was <U+017F>o taken up with <hi>Charite's</hi> Picture, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tow'd
not much of his thoughts on any thing el<U+017F>e. When bed-time was come, there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43725:37"/>
was a little Chamber a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd him alone, for he de<U+017F>ired it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o. He made
fa<U+017F>t the door and went to bed, but it was a long time ere he could <U+017F>leep. He had left
the candle (which was a good big one) burning, that he might con<U+017F>ider his Picture;
and it is not ea<U+017F>ily imaginable what prai<U+017F>es he <U+017F>till gave the Painter, who<U+017F>e invention
<U+017F>eem'd to him wholly divine. He was thinking within him<U+017F>elf, that as <hi>Poetry</hi> was
called a <U+017F>peaking Picture, <U+017F>o painting might be called a dumb <hi>Poe<U+017F>ie.</hi> So that he was
clearly of opinion, that Painting and Poetry were well met, and that both of them
di<U+017F>covered them<U+017F>elves in terms di<U+017F>tinct and intelligible enough to good wits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> having under<U+017F>tood that he had not put out the candle, was <U+017F>omwhat
troubled, for he was afraid le<U+017F>t he might <U+017F>et the hou<U+017F>e on fire. But though he was
<U+017F>ufficiently a fool, yet did he not advance <U+017F>o far; and unle<U+017F>s it were for <U+017F>ome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancie
that the betray'd in mi<U+017F>taking all the Fables of the Poets for real truths, and
thinking men <U+017F>hould live as the <hi>Heroes</hi> in <hi>Romances,</hi> he appear'd rational enough;
and be<U+017F>ides had judgment enough to know what could hurt him, or was for his good.
Neverthele<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ervants were charg'd to be carefull; and <U+017F>o at length the candle
being <U+017F>pent, every one went to his re<U+017F>t and <U+017F>lept, as he did al<U+017F>o. The next morning he
ri<U+017F>e, and gave his Entertainer a vi<U+017F>it, who was making him<U+017F>elf ready. While <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi>
was entertaining him with <U+017F>ome curious and choi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es concerning the divers
effects of <hi>Love,</hi> there entred into the Court a Gentleman of his acquaintance, called
<hi>Montenor,</hi> whom he immediately went to entertain, and was with him ere he was
off hor<U+017F>-back. He carried him into the Hall, <U+017F>peaking by his gladne<U+017F>s the obligation
he laid on him, in that he had been at the pains to come to his hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Montenor</hi> told
him that he came out of <hi>Paris</hi> betimes, for two rea<U+017F>ons: The one, to enjoy the cool
of the day; and the other (which was the <U+017F>tronger inducement) was, the likelier
meanes he had to finde him, which he was in <U+017F>ome impatience till he had
done.</p>
            <p>While they were thus engag'd, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> de<U+017F>irous to know who it was, entred
the place where they were, and <U+017F>aluted the Company very courteou<U+017F>ly. <hi>Montenor</hi>
was <U+017F>omwhat a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at his garb and mode; but pre<U+017F>umed not to <U+017F>peak of him
to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the other was <U+017F>omwhat neer, as al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e he was entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of that importance, that he could not wave it. I am very certain,
<U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> that be<U+017F>ides your de<U+017F>ire to give me a vi<U+017F>it, there is <U+017F>ome particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
hath cau<U+017F>ed your coming hither. So that the other found him<U+017F>elf oblig'd to
di<U+017F>cover what burthen'd his mind, in the<U+017F>e words.</p>
            <p>I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s (<U+017F>ays he to him) that I come hither partly upon the occa<U+017F>ion of an
afflicted per<U+017F>on, on whom there mu<U+017F>t be compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>hewn, or <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t not be
heard complain. That you may not langui<U+017F>h in expectation, 'tis <hi>Geneura</hi> that I <U+017F>peak
of: Ca<U+017F>t but your eyes on the vehemence of the affection <U+017F>he hath always born you,
and you will perceive, that not being able to beget any thing in you that were not
like it, the di<U+017F>quiet <U+017F>he is in to <U+017F>ee her<U+017F>elf for<U+017F>aken mu<U+017F>t needs be extreme. They <U+017F>ay
that in Love the <U+017F>eparation of Bodies is not truly ab<U+017F>ence, <U+017F>eeing there may be vi<U+017F>its
of Thoughts at every moment: But when a Lover ab<U+017F>ents him<U+017F>elf ab<U+017F>olutely, 'tis
then that his affections and inclinations wander from the Object on which they
<U+017F>hould be fa<U+017F>tened. <hi>Geneura</hi> is an example of this; and though you are now but
at the di<U+017F>tance of eight or nine miles from her, <U+017F>he hath more to <U+017F>uffer then at other
times when you were in <hi>Touraine,</hi> or in <hi>Britany;</hi> for then <U+017F>he was a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that if
in the night <U+017F>he dreamt of you, you did no le<U+017F>s of her; and that <U+017F>o it <U+017F>eem'd your
minds being di<U+017F>engaged, your bodies gave one the other the meeting at half way.
But now that <U+017F>he knows that you have quite forgotten her, he that would comfort
her contributes to her de<U+017F>pair; and <U+017F>he knows <U+017F>o much affliction, that for to learn
how to dye, there is no more required then to <U+017F>uffer the like. This hath made <U+017F>uch
an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion on me, that I promi<U+017F>ed her to come to you to repre<U+017F>ent part of her
<U+017F>orrows, that you might be induced to give her a vi<U+017F>it, at which time you <U+017F>hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the re<U+017F>t from her own mouth.</p>
            <p>Now am I fully convinc'd as to the artifices of <hi>Geneura,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> they mu<U+017F>t
needs be very <U+017F>trong, <U+017F>ith they have been able to overcome you. However, I am

<U+017F>orry <U+017F>he hath employed a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e, in <U+017F>o indi<U+017F>creet a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. I <U+017F>hall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
my pains, if I can <U+017F>atisfie your prejudice. But what! will you <U+017F>ay that <hi>Geneura</hi>
cannot accu<U+017F>e you of infidelity, <U+017F>ays <hi>Montenor,</hi> and challenge what you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
el<U+017F>where, to have been <U+017F>ometimes hers? Knew I not that what <U+017F>he bewails
was <U+017F>ometimes hers, and that <U+017F>he hath a right to require it, I <U+017F>hould not have been
<U+017F>o uncivil as to come to <U+017F>peak to you of a thing which would return as much to her
di<U+017F>honour as mine own. I mu<U+017F>t needs acknowledge, that if I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay I never
loved <hi>Geneura,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> the very <U+017F>tones of her hou<U+017F>e would convince me of
fal<U+017F>hood, and that it were not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak for to repeat the things
they have heard me <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>eeing in many places they bear yet the characters I trac'd
on them when I was in my amorous <hi>fondne<U+017F><U+017F>es;</hi> the Letters and Sonnets which
<hi>Geneura</hi> hath in her Cabinet, were al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ufficient evidences again<U+017F>t me. But, Sir,
what would you infer thence? That becau<U+017F>e I have been a long time expo<U+017F>ed to
the furges of a tempe<U+017F>tuous <U+017F>ea, mu<U+017F>t I therefore return thither again, and that I
remain there till the con<U+017F>equence mu<U+017F>t be a wrack? Tell me no more of the love
of the<U+017F>e Wenches, that are <U+017F>o fickle, that among them all there is not one con<U+017F>tant,
unle<U+017F>s it be in the de<U+017F>ire of change every houre. A man ought not to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
<U+017F>o far in loving them, as not to pre<U+017F>erve the better part of his Liberty for an
antidote again<U+017F>t the affliction which their lightne<U+017F>s may bring upon him. It <U+017F>eems by
what you <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>ays <hi>Montenor,</hi> that you your <U+017F>elf are quite metamorpho<U+017F>ed, and that
you are no more one of the Subjects of the Gode<U+017F>s of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as you have been; for
<hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> are the two mo<U+017F>t <hi>incompatible</hi> things in the world. <hi>Love</hi> mu<U+017F>t be
<hi>ab<U+017F>olute</hi> Ma<U+017F>ter where-ever he is: <hi>Rea<U+017F>on</hi> gives him the place; the <hi>Will</hi> obeyes;
and the Inclinations <hi>change</hi> for him, and the <U+017F>ervice done him is not thought half
what is due to him. But though this God have <U+017F>uch power, yet mu<U+017F>t we not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to avoid him: 'Tis well known, that if Love be a poi<U+017F>on, 'tis a plea<U+017F>ant
one; if it be a di<U+017F>quiet, 'tis de<U+017F>ireable; if it be a death, 'tis peaceable; if it be a
pri<U+017F>on, there wants nothing but liberty, and mi<U+017F>ery reigns not there as in other
pri<U+017F>ons. A per<U+017F>on that at your age <U+017F>hould love nothing, is like a dead Sea, wherein
if a <U+017F>hip cannot be ca<U+017F>t away, no more can it attain the haven; and if you can lo<U+017F>e
nothing by not loving, neither can you arrive at any con<U+017F>iderable good fortune.
When I <U+017F>ee a Mind <U+017F>o noble as yours not inflamed with Love, methinks I find a
Torch of mo<U+017F>t excellent wax, but without fire to light it, for want whereof we are
<U+017F>till in the dark.</p>
            <p>All this were good enough, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> had I not experience that Love is
an evil painted with the colours of good. The torments are much more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured then
the plea<U+017F>ures, to him that will <U+017F>ubmit to his conduct; and though <U+017F>ome take great
plea<U+017F>ure in ta<U+017F>ting its fruits, yet is it a <U+017F>ort of meat whereof a man cannot eat much
and think it's good. There is a <U+017F>entence as true as old, that <U+017F>ayes there are but two
happy dayes in marriage, the Wedding-day, and that of the Wifes death. But it is
withall to be granted, that <U+017F>ince this <U+017F>entence was fir<U+017F>t pronounc'd things are rather
grown wor<U+017F>e then better; nay, for my part, I <U+017F>hould not grant the Wedding-day
to be wi<U+017F>h'd. To be <U+017F>hort, A Woman is a dome<U+017F>tick danger, and under a humane
beauty there often lurks a <U+017F>avage bea<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>ome wi<U+017F>e men have doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was delivered of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with much choler; and <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

thus. Be not angry, my dear Friend! know that I do not blame all women: 'tis
only with this <hi>Geneura,</hi> of whom we <U+017F>peak, that I was afraid a marriage would have
proved my repentance. But that is contrary to what I <U+017F>aid, replies <hi>Montenor:</hi> you
are obliged to love <hi>Geneura,</hi> and to avoid all others. An<U+017F>wer that objection, friend,

be thought worthy to enter into the Temple of <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> if you have not continued
faithfull to your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. I have hearken'd a good while to your di<U+017F>pute, but I <U+017F>hall
be able to make nothing of it, if you give me not each his <U+017F>tory, and alleadge your

for to be Judge in your difference, and not <U+017F>pend your mony on the Pettifogers
of the Country? So <hi>Sylvander</hi> judg'd the difference between <hi>Leonice</hi> and <hi>Tyrcis;</hi>

I became acquainted, among others, with <hi>Lerantus,</hi> a Batchelour, one not

                           </gap>man. He carried me one day to <hi>Geneura</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
with whom he had <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and he did as good as bring a Victim to the
Altar to be <U+017F>acrificed. I had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>een her, but my de<U+017F>ires were <U+017F>o inflamed for
her, that I had no re<U+017F>t till I had returned to offer her the prey <U+017F>he had already gotten. The
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43725:39"/>
Father and Mother being a <U+017F>ubtile <U+017F>ort of people, di<U+017F>cover'd pre<U+017F>ently on what de<U+017F>ign I
came to their hou<U+017F>e, and gave me tho<U+017F>e entertainments that lur'd me to further vi<U+017F>its.
They perceived that a while before, I had gotten a Trea<U+017F>urer-<U+017F>hip; be<U+017F>ides, they knew
my Father had left me <U+017F>omewhat, and as for their part they had not much, the husband
being of the mo<U+017F>t incon<U+017F>iderable Officers belonging to the King; <U+017F>o that it had been to
their no <U+017F>mall advantage; if I had married the Daughter. I think they had not
forgotten to recommend to her, to receive me favourably, and to carry her <U+017F>elf before me
di<U+017F>creetly and mode<U+017F>tly. And indeed <U+017F>he was not wanting; and I vow to you, that as
<U+017F>he was yet very young, and of much <U+017F>implicity, I took an infinite plea<U+017F>ure to hear her
talk innocently of Love. I <U+017F>hall not tell you how many afternoons and evenings I have
pa<U+017F>tim'd away with her, nor how many <hi>Serenades</hi> I have given her, nor what Letters
and Ver<U+017F>es I <U+017F>ent. It's enough for me to tell you, that I lived not but for her, and that
<U+017F>he lived not but for me, and that preferring content before riches, I di<U+017F>pos'd my <U+017F>elf to
marry her as <U+017F>oon as I <U+017F>hould obtain the con<U+017F>ent of my friends. Yet from that very time I
ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>ome Artifices in the Mother, and in Her; but pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion blinding me, I thought
all <U+017F>upportable. When I was in the hou<U+017F>e, and that there came <U+017F>ome to vi<U+017F>it them, if he
were a per<U+017F>on of quality, as there frequented divers, they gave word they were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and had much ado to recover the courte<U+017F>ie they did me. But what dream'd I on at
that time, that I <U+017F>hould give them any credit, <U+017F>eeing <hi>Per<U+017F>ida, Geneura</hi>'s Mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as <U+017F>ubtile as woman could be, <U+017F>erved me in the like kinde, and cau<U+017F>ed me to be <U+017F>ent
back again, when I came to <U+017F>ee them, while they had others to entertain: And this
maxime <U+017F>he ever kept, that it might not be known they were familiar with all the world,
and that they might be thought very re<U+017F>erved. Now it hapned often, that I was told
they were not at home, and I doubted the principal rea<U+017F>on to be, that <hi>Geneura</hi> was not
dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed to her advantage: for when <U+017F>he had notice of the day I <U+017F>hould vi<U+017F>it her, I ob<U+017F>erved
<U+017F>he would make long mornings to dre<U+017F>s her head only. All this wind <U+017F>hook no corn:
And though I could remember <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages then, I <U+017F>hall conceal them, as being not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to make her be de<U+017F>pis'd. But one time, having been about a year ab<U+017F>ent about my
Charge, when I was return'd, I found her fir<U+017F>t innocency chang'd into the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
in the world; and that <U+017F>he might de<U+017F>ervedly be called the <hi>Queen</hi> of Tatling Go<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ips.
Her mother had carried her to great Ladies, who were pleas'd to e<U+017F>teem her for
her beauty, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he would govern as they, who were more then <U+017F>he could ever be; and
ever and anon <U+017F>he di<U+017F>cover'd an in<U+017F>upportable vanity. She never heard a Coach go by,
but <U+017F>he bid her maid look out at the window to <U+017F>ee if it were not <U+017F>ome great Lord of her
acquaintance: See if it be not <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> or <hi>Poliarchus,</hi> <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he to the Wench, though
'twere but <U+017F>ome Countrey La<U+017F>s, that knew neither of them. How's that? <U+017F>aid I to
her once on that occa<U+017F>ion, do you know when <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>es by, by the going of his hor<U+017F>es,
or by the noi<U+017F>e of his Coach-wheels? That is not it, <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, but I well know he fails
not to pa<U+017F>s by every day at a certain hour ju<U+017F>t by the hou<U+017F>e; and note here, that in <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>o, <U+017F>he bit her lips, as if <U+017F>he gave me a bone to pick, and to make me believe, that that
Lord pa<U+017F>s'd by that way for to <U+017F>ee her. Another imagination <U+017F>he had was, that all that
once <U+017F>aw her dyed for love; and <U+017F>he took <U+017F>uch a plea<U+017F>ure to be look'd on, that one evening
being in a <U+017F>treet wherein there is always much people, I <U+017F>aw her pa<U+017F>s by in a Coach, at
the boot whereof <U+017F>he <U+017F>ate with a lighted Taper in her hand. There was no Ma<U+017F>que or
Collation, where <U+017F>he appear'd not with the fir<U+017F>t; nay, <U+017F>he would not <U+017F>tick to come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
and danced with throngs of men, an action which was thought <U+017F>omewhat di<U+017F>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
by the di<U+017F>creete<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons. I found her one time in a great company, wherein we
were <U+017F>ix who loved her, and <U+017F>trove to obtain <U+017F>ome favour from her, when in the mean
time <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtil, that <U+017F>he obliged all together: For <U+017F>he <U+017F>ate on ones knee, trod on
the foot of another; <U+017F>he had one Gentleman by the hand, and <U+017F>poke to another that <U+017F>tood by
him. That hindred not but that <U+017F>he heard another Lover, who had a very good voyce,
<U+017F>inging, and ca<U+017F>t amourous looks on his neighbour. So every one thought him<U+017F>elf in greater
favour then his Rivals, but <U+017F>he knew not her <U+017F>elf what would plea<U+017F>e her. Whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<U+017F>he went to Ma<U+017F>s ever and anon in the morning, <U+017F>he went not now till almo<U+017F>t noon,
becau<U+017F>e that is the time the Nobility goes; and when <U+017F>he was in the Church, though <U+017F>he
<U+017F>aw a Ma<U+017F>s ready to begin, yet would <U+017F>he walk up and down as if <U+017F>he <U+017F>ought for one:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43725:40"/>
and if <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw a knot of Courtiers di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing together, <U+017F>he would pa<U+017F>s through them, that
they might all behold her. Nor indeed did the de<U+017F>ign mi<U+017F>carry, for there was not any
one that addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed not his eyes to her, but it was only to laugh at her folly. One gave
her a jog as <U+017F>he pa<U+017F>s'd by, <U+017F>o did the other: and I have heard, that a witty Gentleman
ob<U+017F>erving her, ferretting all about <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid, to her, Lady, you need <U+017F>eek no further, I
have what you look for; yet they <U+017F>ay, this <U+017F>harp abu<U+017F>e rais'd not the lea<U+017F>t blu<U+017F>h, <U+017F>o much
confidence was <U+017F>he guilty of, or to <U+017F>ay better, impudence. That which be<U+017F>ides further
pre<U+017F>ented the world with occa<U+017F>ion to laugh, was her gate, for <U+017F>he gave her whole body a
certain <U+017F>haking, as if it had been a Puppet, and <U+017F>he negligently bent her head on every <U+017F>ide,
with <U+017F>uch mea<U+017F>ure and proportion, that it <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>he had learn'd that method by <hi>Tabla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
As for her cloathes, there was <U+017F>o much matter for Reformation, that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erved
an EDICT for her alone; and though when <U+017F>he went abroad <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o gallant, that
there was much to be reproved, yet was <U+017F>he not content, but when <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed at home <U+017F>he had
better Cloathes then <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>hew abroad. Her Language was al<U+017F>o very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that there might not be any thing in her that <U+017F>welt not of Artifice. When <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke,
<U+017F>he us'd a wanton li<U+017F>ping, and of an imperfection of Speech <U+017F>he would make a grace. As
for her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, it was only of <U+017F>ome little Court-toyi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s; and <U+017F>he never looked on
any per<U+017F>on twice, but <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently gave him <U+017F>ome name of alliance, and that receipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<U+017F>he took not another from him, not once thinking that the mo<U+017F>t commonly <U+017F>he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F>s'd
her <U+017F>elf to infamous per<U+017F>ons. I well ob<U+017F>erved all the<U+017F>e things, yet I was <U+017F>o be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched,
that I excu<U+017F>ed them, rather then condemn'd them: And I an<U+017F>wered tho<U+017F>e
who <U+017F>poke to me of the affectations of <hi>Geneura,</hi> That it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to finde a Beauty
<U+017F>o accompli<U+017F>hed by nature, but there may be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary <U+017F>ome recour<U+017F>e to Art. Nay, I
could not rid my <U+017F>elf of the de<U+017F>ire of marrying her, and attributing all her indi<U+017F>creet
actions to the ill conduct of youth. I hop'd one day to furni<U+017F>h her with better di<U+017F>cipline
then her Mother. But what a mad man was I to think, that a woman will exchange
Liberty for Slavery? He that would keep her in, mu<U+017F>t give her her way; and he that
would have her de<U+017F>ire any thing, mu<U+017F>t pretend to <U+017F>tand infear of her. <hi>Geneura</hi> would
have done <U+017F>o too, and I am beholding to her di<U+017F>dains and remi<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which, when I was
the mo<U+017F>t enchanted, prevail'd with me to <U+017F>eek my remedy rather in her contempt, then in
her enjoyment. The proud <hi>Titifil</hi> forgot all re<U+017F>pect to me, that <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erved before, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ing
her <U+017F>elf a better fortune: <U+017F>o that to the end <U+017F>he might the more ea<U+017F>ily be found,
<U+017F>he freely entertained all that came. While St. <hi>Germains Fair</hi> la<U+017F>ted, <U+017F>he mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed not a
day to be there: <U+017F>he <U+017F>ate on the Counter of <U+017F>ome Shop, that <U+017F>he might the better be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as if <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>ome Commodity to be <U+017F>old. 'T had been no great matter,
had <U+017F>he only obliged tho<U+017F>e that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by of her acquaintance to treat her with <U+017F>weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats,
but <U+017F>he further importun'd them for <U+017F>ome little Diamond, or <U+017F>ome piece or other
out of the Gold<U+017F>miths: So that if <U+017F>he would do <U+017F>o every year, 'twould prove a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
to her. About that time <U+017F>he had purchas'd a great reputation for her Beauty;
and I think that when there came any <U+017F>trangers to <hi>Paris,</hi> they went to <U+017F>ee her in the
Church, and other places, as if <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>ome Rarity of the Citie. Tho<U+017F>e that had
any Suits of con<U+017F>equence at Law, endeavoured her acquaintance, for to de<U+017F>ire her to
<U+017F>peak for them to their Coun<U+017F>ellours, for they thought her beauty able to corrupt the
Judges of mo<U+017F>t integrity. But this might have been excus'd, were it not that <U+017F>he did it
for advantage, and that it gained her the frequentation of a many, who would not have
courted her but for to deceive her. I was extreamly troubled to <U+017F>ee it, though for my part,
I had all the rea<U+017F>on in the world to hate her, and I thence ea<U+017F>ily inferr'd her ruine. For
I know well, there could not be a wor<U+017F>e Guardian of a Maids cha<U+017F>tity then Poverty,
and that <U+017F>lender Revenues, Beauty and Cha<U+017F>tity <U+017F>eldom lodge all at the <U+017F>ame Inn. And
what is more; <hi>Geneura</hi> encouraged the le<U+017F>s confident <U+017F>ort of people, to ask her tho<U+017F>e
things which are hone<U+017F>tly refu<U+017F>able; and her Cloathes, words and actions <U+017F>eem'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titute

that it is hardly perceiv'd, but with this difference, that I intended no reflux.
So I in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly di<U+017F>ingag'd me out of her Love, to the end <U+017F>he might let go quietly what I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43725:40"/>
took from her, without knowing how it was lo<U+017F>t, as if it had been a <U+017F>hadow which had
di<U+017F>appear'd: So that if there remained any affection for her, 'twas only in con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that I had formerly born her, it being an incivilitie to make a <U+017F>table of that
place, which was before reverenced as a Temple. But <hi>it was to great</hi> purpo<U+017F>e for me
to wi<U+017F>h her happine<U+017F>s: for <U+017F>he met with that misfortune, which a La<U+017F>s of her quality
ought the mo<U+017F>t to fear. She never went with her Mother, becau<U+017F>e the woman was <U+017F>till
<U+017F>o fooli<U+017F>h, that <U+017F>he would have the reputation of fair, and by a maxim of Go<U+017F><U+017F>ipry, would
not take her in her company, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover her age, <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he had a daughter <U+017F>o
big. <hi>Geneura</hi> being once at a Wedding where <U+017F>he had but one Maid with her, a young
man who had taken her in divers times to dance, kept alwaies <U+017F>omwhat near her, and
proffer'd his <U+017F>ervice to wait on her home, <U+017F>eeing no body came to look after her. About
ten of the clock, when they talk'd of bedding the Bride, a <U+017F>ort of unknown di<U+017F>guis'd
Dancers came into the room, and putting out all the Torches, committed an un<U+017F>peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
di<U+017F>order. In the mid<U+017F>t of the tumult, they <U+017F>ay the Bride was ravi<U+017F>h'd by one of her
former <U+017F>ervants: and as for <hi>Geneura,</hi> there was one <hi>Gismond</hi> carried her away, and
di<U+017F>pos'd her into a Coach that waited in the <U+017F>treet. In the mean while he that held her
in talk before, made <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tir in the Hall, which was ob<U+017F>erved by her Maid, who knew
not where her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was. As <U+017F>he was asking him for her, he told her <U+017F>he was with
him, and bid her follow him. The Maid believing him, follow'd, and kept her eye on
him <U+017F>till in the dark; and when they were come into the <U+017F>treet, where it was not much
more light then on the <U+017F>tairs of the hou<U+017F>e whence they came, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him conducting a
Gentlewoman, which <U+017F>he took for her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he <U+017F>till followed on. She di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
not the cheat till the Gentlewoman <U+017F>poke, and then the poor Wench almo<U+017F>t amaz'd,
returned to the hou<U+017F>e where the Wedding had been, for to look for <hi>Geneura,</hi> where when <U+017F>he
had in vain as'd for her of all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he met, <U+017F>he return'd with the news of this lo<U+017F>s to the
Father and Mother; and I know not whether they were much di<U+017F>pleas'd at it or no, or
whether they had <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>urance that their daughter was in <U+017F>ome good place. <hi>Gi<U+017F>mond</hi>
having gotten the prey he de<U+017F>ired, bid the Coachman drive as fa<U+017F>t as he could, <U+017F>o that in
a little while they were gotten a League off <hi>Paris,</hi> where they accidentally met a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
a former Suitor of <hi>Geneura</hi>'s, who was coming out of the Countrey. He hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <U+017F>peak, draws his <U+017F>word, <U+017F>taies the Coachman, and gives <hi>Gi<U+017F>mond</hi> a
thru<U+017F>t in the left arm. <hi>Gi<U+017F>mond</hi> thereupon drew out a pi<U+017F>tol he had, but it went not
off, only the others hor<U+017F>e, being <U+017F>tartled, carried him away acro<U+017F>s the fields. In the
mean while the Coachman put forward, and having gotten a good di<U+017F>tance from the
place, met with no further mi<U+017F>adventure. He <U+017F>oon after recovered a hou<U+017F>e of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters,
three leagues from <hi>Paris. Gi<U+017F>mond</hi>'s wound was there lanc'd, but that <U+017F>o care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>ly,
that a feaver <U+017F>o violent en<U+017F>ued, that ten days after he dyed. Tho<U+017F>e that think it
their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>peak the truth without di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, affirm, his life was not <U+017F>hortned
but through his impatience in his loves; and that without regarding his wound, he would
enjoy the fruits of the <U+017F>poil he had taken, wherein he <U+017F>o overheated him<U+017F>elf, that he could
live no longer. This being very likely to be true, do you <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e <hi>Montenor,</hi> that I
would marry <hi>Geneura,</hi> though <U+017F>he be come back to her Fathers, and though <U+017F>he <U+017F>till pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to hone<U+017F>ty? I do not believe it the <U+017F>ame ca<U+017F>e with Women as the Sun, which though
it be common, lo<U+017F>es not of its beauty; and if I ever marrie, I will take one that is not
only not blamed, but not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected. I have now found out a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who is <U+017F>o far from
all <U+017F>ubtilty and affectation, that <U+017F>he hath nothing of it but the di<U+017F>dain give me leave to
<U+017F>erve her, and tell me no more of this <hi>Geneura,</hi> who would be better known then I, were

               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> having paus'd there, <hi>Montenor,</hi> who was not able to endure what he
had <U+017F>aid of his ancient Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, retorted thus. I do not <U+017F>o much wonder at what
you have <U+017F>aid <hi>An<U+017F>elme;</hi> for it is a thing generally granted, that there is no di<U+017F>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<U+017F>o violent, as that which <U+017F>ucceeds a friend<U+017F>hip? but I apprehend not whence
it comes that you are guilty of <U+017F>uch a change: you tax <hi>Geneura</hi> with many little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectations,
but it is well known, that <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he hath been out of <hi>Gi<U+017F>monds</hi> hands,
<U+017F>he hath only pre<U+017F>erved tho<U+017F>e that render her more hand<U+017F>ome, and more de<U+017F>irable.
As for her Cha<U+017F>tity, there is no doubt but <U+017F>he is as pure as ever. 'Tis generally
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43725:41"/>
known that <hi>Gi<U+017F>mond,</hi> who was an old Batchelor, and very rich, carried her away by
force out of the place where <U+017F>he was, by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his friends di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed
When he had her at his own hou<U+017F>e, I believe he gave <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>ault to her cha<U+017F>tity:
But to make it appear to you how that he prevailed nothing at all, you <U+017F>hall be
<U+017F>hewn the Te<U+017F>tament he made the day before he dyed, wherein he bequeaths all his
Chattels to <hi>Geneura,</hi> repenting him of the injury he had done her, and de<U+017F>iring to
make her <U+017F>atisfaction, and that preci<U+017F>ely for what, <U+017F>ays he, becau<U+017F>e that having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to corrupt her when <U+017F>he was at my hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted my a<U+017F><U+017F>aults, and
di<U+017F>covered that cha<U+017F>tity, that <U+017F>he well de<U+017F>erves an honourable acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Seeing <U+017F>he was carried away by force, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> why did <U+017F>he not cry out for
help among <U+017F>o many people; and when <U+017F>he was in an open coach, why did <U+017F>he not
<U+017F>trive to get out? When <U+017F>he was at <hi>Gi<U+017F>monds</hi> hou<U+017F>e, what endeavours was <U+017F>he <U+017F>een
to have to <U+017F>end to her friends for to come and relieve her, or to my <U+017F>elf who <U+017F>hould
have been more ready to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t her then any of them? You would al<U+017F>o have me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>uffer her<U+017F>elf to be vanqui<U+017F>h'd by her <U+017F>weet Enemy; and you
quote me his Te<U+017F>tament to prove it. But alas! how plain is this cheat? For what
appearance is there that <hi>Gi<U+017F>mond,</hi> an old Ruffian, who had de<U+017F>ign'd his means to be
the prey of di<U+017F>hone<U+017F>ty and lewdne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>hould make choice of this Wench to be his
Heirre<U+017F>s for having continued hone<U+017F>t. Was <U+017F>he then the fir<U+017F>t wherein he had found

               </gap><U+017F>ters and Cou<U+017F>ins? What a
miracle is this! There is only he that attempted her love, that thinks her
cha<U+017F>te, and all others e<U+017F>teem her uncha<U+017F>te. It mu<U+017F>t be conceiv'd it was <U+017F>he caus'd

him<U+017F>elf to hear it, and had cau<U+017F>ed his Adver<U+017F>ary to be <U+017F>ilent. But the Judge

I'll be back pre<U+017F>ently. And in that po<U+017F>ture went he to his Chamber, where he

day of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing his judgement was better couch'd then theirs.
Wherein they di<U+017F>cover'd they under<U+017F>tood not the Laws and the practi<U+017F>e as well as he
who had been de<U+017F>ign'd for the <hi>Long robe,</hi> and had <U+017F>tudied the <hi>Pandects</hi> of <hi>Ju<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterward he went to <hi>Montenor,</hi> and told him, that what was order'd mu<U+017F>t be
ob<U+017F>erv'd, without thought of appealing: And the Gentleman <U+017F>eeing by all his
abu<U+017F>es, that his contempt of <hi>Geneura</hi> was as high as might be, knew well enough he
had engag'd his heart el<U+017F>ewhere. He asked him who was his new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniou<U+017F>ly
told him it was <hi>Angelica,</hi> the daughter of a Patentee, dead not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<hi>Montenor</hi> who knew her, and withal knew <U+017F>he was very hand<U+017F>om, and very
rich, would not divert his pur<U+017F>uance of her, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid to him, A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf,
that though <hi>Geneura</hi> bewail'd your lo<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he hath repair'd it, by the devotion of as
faithful a Lover, whom <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olve to marry, now that <U+017F>he can hope no more
from you. I mu<U+017F>t with all ha<U+017F>te return to <hi>Paris</hi> to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e her thereto; for I am
certain <U+017F>he counts the hours <U+017F>ince I parted, and tho<U+017F>e my return might take up, <U+017F>uch
is her impatience to know what I have prevail'd with you. To which <hi>An<U+017F>elm</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer'd,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43725:42"/>
That he <U+017F>hould be very glad <hi>Geneura</hi> met with a good fortune; and that
what he had <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t her, was partly the better to ju<U+017F>tifie him<U+017F>elf as to the Crime
which he was charg'd with of having for<U+017F>aken her. In con<U+017F>equence of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
he took <hi>Montenor</hi> a<U+017F>ide and told him, who the Judge in the <hi><U+017F>hort R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> was, that
had reconcil'd them. He al<U+017F>o farther forc'd on him the plea<U+017F>ure to hear him di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
<U+017F>ome longer time, for he would not permit him to go before dinner. Which
being done, <hi>Montenor</hi> returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he gave an account of what had
pa<U+017F>s'd to <hi>Geneura,</hi> who thereupon re<U+017F>olved to take for husband him they <U+017F>hould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>pent that day within doors with <hi>An<U+017F>elm,</hi> and that very impatiently; for he
had a great de<U+017F>ire to be carried to <hi>Angelica</hi>'s, where CHARITE dwelt, but
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had no minde to't: and all the Shepherd could obtain of him, was only
to pa<U+017F>s by the door, which yet <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> was willing to do <U+017F>o far as he thought it <U+017F>o
much walk. As they were in the <U+017F>treet: O God! <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> what a propitious
hour is this to go and tickle the ear of a <hi>Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s</hi> with the <U+017F>ound of a <hi>Lute,</hi> that
crys Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for him that touches it! Can you play on the Lute Shepherd, <U+017F>ays
<hi>An<U+017F>elme?</hi> No, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but for the <hi>Guitar,</hi> I touch it in <U+017F>uch a manner, that
there is no Magick <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong as the <U+017F>ound I give it, when I <U+017F>ing to it <U+017F>ome ayr that is
amorou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>weet. Well, if you <U+017F>ing it <U+017F>uffices, replys <hi>An<U+017F>elm,</hi> the voyce is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trument
which may be carried every where. Come and <U+017F>ing before the window
of your Sherherde<U+017F>s. That would do very well, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> if I had but an ayr upon
that occa<U+017F>ion, but I thought not on't this afternoon to make one: be<U+017F>ides, I left at
<hi>Paris</hi> my Dictionary of French Rimes, and my Collection of Epithetes, without
which I cannot make Ver<U+017F>es. And now I think on't, He that not long <U+017F>ince hath
advanc'd in <hi>France</hi> tho<U+017F>e loo<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es according to the <hi>Italian</hi> mode, hath been
much in the right, for there is nothing <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie as to make of them; and when a man
is in ha<U+017F>te, they are <U+017F>oon di<U+017F>patch'd. They are <U+017F>ome long, and <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hort, <U+017F>ome
ma<U+017F>culines, <U+017F>ome feminines, <U+017F>ometimes with plain Rimes, <U+017F>ometimes a cro<U+017F>s, all as it
comes into a mans minde, without being oblig'd to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e them into <hi>Stanza</hi>'s or
<hi>Odes.</hi> I yet would not pre<U+017F>ume to practi<U+017F>e them, till <U+017F>ome others had lead me the
way: for I have heard <U+017F>ay, that at pre<U+017F>ent there are at <hi>Paris</hi> a <U+017F>ort of people, who
would be call'd the Ingenuities of the age, who would hi<U+017F>s at me, as if I pre<U+017F>ented
them with <U+017F>ome un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable Novelty. They would pre<U+017F>ently rank me among tho<U+017F>e
who have endeavored to make mea<U+017F>ured Ver<U+017F>es according to the Latines. A man
mu<U+017F>t a little fear them, for things are <U+017F>o far well or ill done, as they like or di<U+017F>like
them, and all depends on their approbation, and their cen<U+017F>ure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> thought the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations very rational, but he per<U+017F>waded him that
though he had not made Ver<U+017F>es purpo<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>ing before <hi>Charite</hi>'s window, yet mu<U+017F>t
he not omit to go thither, con<U+017F>idering, many Gallants gave <hi>Serenades</hi> every day with
ordinary Songs, and that it matter'd not, <U+017F>o that they were well <U+017F>ung. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was <U+017F>o
de<U+017F>irous to go and rai<U+017F>e up his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s with the melody of his voyce, that he ea<U+017F>ily
believed all this: <U+017F>o having bethought him<U+017F>elf a little, he <U+017F>aid chearfully to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi>
I have found what I had need of; have not you heard of an Ayr that begins
thus:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Charite,</hi> who<U+017F>e brighter eyes,</l>
                  <l>Our hearts do Tyranni<U+017F>e,</l>
                  <l>And tho<U+017F>e that dare rebel cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That's it <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ing, <hi>I</hi> believe it was made expre<U+017F>ly for me, and that the Poet
pre<U+017F>ag'd that a <hi>Charite</hi> <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e me under her Laws</p>
            <p>As he had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> gave him notice, that they were before the hou<U+017F>e of
<hi>Charite,</hi> and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, that his choice as to the Song was <U+017F>o excellent and <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
that he believed it was <U+017F>ome Divine in<U+017F>piration, wherefore he advi'sd him not
to think of taking any other. Then he <U+017F>hew'd him that part whence he might be
heard by his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e: and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having hemm'd divers times to di<U+017F>gorge all the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43725:42"/>
flegme that might have block'd up the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of his voice, began his aire <U+017F>o melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly,
that his mu<U+017F>ick was almo<U+017F>t as plea<U+017F>ant as the noi<U+017F>e of a Cart-wheel. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi>
in the mean time bethought him to take off his Galloches, and put them between
his fingers; and by making the <U+017F>oals clatter one again<U+017F>t another, he playd as if it had
been with Clappers, that he might bear a part with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> But the Shepherd not
approving it, intreated him to let him <U+017F>ing alone the <U+017F>econd and third Couplet, and
afterwards he <U+017F>hould do what he would. He had no <U+017F>ooner begun, but a Country-fellow
who<U+017F>e ears were grated with this mad mu<U+017F>ick, came to the window, and ca<U+017F>t
three or four <U+017F>tones at the Mu<U+017F>itian. See there! <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> your mu<U+017F>ick
is as powerful as that of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> it already draws the <U+017F>tones after it. That makes no
amends, <U+017F>ays the Shepherd; let us retire, 'tis not good to be here: The<U+017F>e <U+017F>tones are
not re<U+017F>pectfull as tho<U+017F>e that followed <hi>Orpheus;</hi> for they approach'd him not by
twenty paces, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould have orewhelm'd him, and were balanc'd in the air;
but of the<U+017F>e we may in the end feel the weight.</p>
            <p>When he had <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, they retir'd: For though <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> could have quieted the
Country-fellow, yet would he not, le<U+017F>t any <U+017F>hould know he were there. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in
the return, di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed much to him of the di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ie and <U+017F>avage humour of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Town, who would not permit Lovers to give <hi>Serenades;</hi> and he
<U+017F>pake <U+017F>omewhat too concerning his voice, <U+017F>aying it <U+017F>eem'd to him it was not very
good then, and that if he had not caught a cold, he had <U+017F>ung a great deal better.
As <U+017F>oon as they were come home, they went to bed, and <U+017F>lept both of them very
well till the next day, which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would <U+017F>pend in <U+017F>olitude in his chamber to write a
Letter to <hi>Charite.</hi> In the mean time <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> went to vi<U+017F>it <hi>Leonora, Angelica's</hi>
mother, at who<U+017F>e hou<U+017F>e dwelt the incomparable Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of our Shepherd. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
her with the excellent adventures of his Gue<U+017F>t, and of what plea<U+017F>ant folly
he was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed: which rais'd in her <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee him, that he promi<U+017F>ed to
bring him along with him as <U+017F>oon as he could conveniently. He forgot not to tell
her, that he was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately <U+017F>urpris'd with the beauty of her Waiting-gentlewoman;
and that the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es he made on his Love, excell'd the mo<U+017F>t excellent Comedies in
the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> being return'd, asked the Shepherd if he had fini<U+017F>h'd his Letter? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered,
He had but three words to add, and he would not <U+017F>up till he had done, and
had neatly enclo<U+017F>ed it in gilt paper, and <U+017F>eal'd it with Spani<U+017F>h wax, with red <U+017F>ilk about
it. While they were at Supper, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> told him that he had been where <hi>Charite</hi>
dwelt, and made him believe that he had <U+017F>poken to her of him, and that <U+017F>he thank'd
him for his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance again<U+017F>t the <hi>Satyre.</hi> This he thought a high glory; and he ask'd
his dear Ho<U+017F>t whether he would do him the favour to deliver his Letter to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s?
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> told him he would willingly do it; but withall, that he <U+017F>hould be
glad to know the contents of that Mi<U+017F><U+017F>ive. I have forgotten it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> If it were
burnt or lo<U+017F>t, and that I were to write another, I <U+017F>hould not put one word of the
<U+017F>ame. Shew me the foul Copy, <U+017F>eeing you will not un<U+017F>eal it, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme.</hi> I have
tore it in a thou<U+017F>and peeces, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> And not to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble with you any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
I tell you that if I had it, you <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>ee it, for it is not rea<U+017F>on you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee
the true draught of my affections, before her that hath caus'd them. Are you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about?
replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> how prettily capricious you are! I <U+017F>hall pay you in the
<U+017F>ame coyn; and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, you may go <U+017F>eek one to carry your Letter, for that
<U+017F>hall not I. Po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, <U+017F>eeing you will not <U+017F>hew it me, there is <U+017F>omwhat in't to my
prejudice. I have read of divers who have carried their own deaths in a Letter, and
receiv'd their puni<U+017F>hment as <U+017F>oon as it was in his hands to whom it was directed.
That's not the rea<U+017F>on, <hi>as I am a Shepherd,</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> And I tell you that I care
not much whether you carry my Letter, or no; nay I would not admit of <hi>Love</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
to be the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, were it not that he is blind, and cannot read my <U+017F>ecrets.
Know then that I could willingly give him this Pacquet, and that he would carry it
<U+017F>afely, though he have neither pocket nor budget, for he would hide it in the locks
of his hair; yet cannot I tru<U+017F>t him; for put the ca<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould not know the way to
<hi>Charite's</hi> chamber, he not <U+017F>eeing any thing at all, mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>ome other little Boy to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43725:43"/>
be his guide, as your Bag-pipers have; and he perhaps would mi<U+017F>take <hi>Angelica</hi> for
<hi>Charite,</hi> and <U+017F>o <U+017F>ome other then my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <U+017F>hould have the glory of my writings.
You offend <hi>Cupid</hi> to think <U+017F>o, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> For though he have no eyes, yet he
pre<U+017F>ently knows whom he hath any thing to do with; he hath a better no<U+017F>e then
any Dog in <hi>France,</hi> he'll go <U+017F>centing <U+017F>o long till he find out your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; he hath
as good an ear as a Cat that watches a Mou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that he'll pre<U+017F>ently know her by her
<U+017F>peech; then he hath the feeling <U+017F>o good, that he will not mi<U+017F>take another for her
But if all that were not <U+017F>o, <U+017F>hould he have <U+017F>o little wit as not to know his ordinary
lodging, having no nobler retreat then the eyes of <hi>Charite?</hi> If he <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>eek
her, would he not <U+017F>till go to her by cu<U+017F>tom? I grant your rea<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> But
le<U+017F>t this <hi>little God</hi> who is very quarrel<U+017F>om, <U+017F>hould be angry with me, I will not <U+017F>peak
to him of carrying my Letter: He would an<U+017F>wer me, that I was uncivil to take him
for my Lacquay. He is not like you, who proffer me that favour: For among us
men, who can make returns of courte<U+017F>ies, 'tis the office of a friend, and not of a <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
All this con<U+017F>idered, I have bethought me of an invention to <U+017F>pare both you
and him; but let us talk no more on't, for 'tis not yet time to execute the
de<U+017F>ign.</p>
            <p>So <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> could not <U+017F>ee the Shepherds Letter: and two houres being <U+017F>pent in
this conte<U+017F>tation and other things, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> de<U+017F>ired leave to go out, and de<U+017F>ired him he
would let one of his Lacquays go with him. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> granted it, though he <U+017F>eem'd
to be angry with him: And the Shepherd having taken the Lad a<U+017F>ide, promi<U+017F>ed him
a great reward, if he would a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him in his affairs. He <U+017F>hew'd him<U+017F>elf ready to obey
him in all things; and according as he had bidden, took the Hay-loft-ladder, and
carried it after him. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> <U+017F>eeing them go out <U+017F>o accoutred, ask'd them if they
were going to <U+017F>cale the Heavens, and take the Moon by a<U+017F><U+017F>ault? But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> bid him
only retire and be <U+017F>ilent, and that he <U+017F>hould ere long have an account of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>e.
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> letting him go his wayes without any further di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, expected a
good while for his return: but <U+017F>eeing he <U+017F>taid out long, and that it was very late, he
went to bed.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being come before <hi>Charite's</hi> hou<U+017F>e, look'd about to <U+017F>ee if
there were any light in the chamber where <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had told him <U+017F>he lay. There
was, contrary to his de<U+017F>ire, but it was pre<U+017F>ently put out; <U+017F>o that he then thought all
were abed in the hou<U+017F>e, and that opportunity favoured his de<U+017F>ign. He caus'd the
Ladder to be placed again<U+017F>t the wall; and bidding <hi>Gringalet, An<U+017F>elme's</hi> Lacquay,
hold it fa<U+017F>t below, he went up from rowel to rowel, with the Letter in his hand, for
to put it on the window of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: but being come to the upper end of the
ladder, all he could do was to reach the lower brink of the window; <U+017F>o that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to <U+017F>tand a tip-toe, and to <U+017F>tretch out his arm, that it had been as good for his
joynts to have been on the rack. While he thus lengthned him<U+017F>elf, there was a Car
within kept a pawing at the clappers of the window, which <U+017F>o alarm'd him, that he
made <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te back, that he very narrowly mi<U+017F>s'd falling to the ground. Having
been a little while in expectation of what might en<U+017F>ue, he bethought him<U+017F>elf'twere
better to give the Lacquay the Letter to put on the window: whereupon he came
down and <U+017F>poke to him of it: but having mea<U+017F>ur'd which were the taller, he was
two fingers <U+017F>horter then him<U+017F>elf; and be<U+017F>ides he perceiv'd his arms were very <U+017F>hort,
which rendred him the le<U+017F>s fit for his enterpri<U+017F>e. That caus'd him to get up again,
not looking for any a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance but from him<U+017F>elf; and taking heart, he went as high
as he had been at fir<U+017F>t. Hearing the <U+017F>ame noi<U+017F>e as before, he thought there might
be <U+017F>omebody that would <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e him; <U+017F>o that he de<U+017F>cended three <U+017F>taves; then
hearing nothing, he a<U+017F>cends again; the noi<U+017F>e beginning again, he de<U+017F>cends again.
Sometimes he lengthned his arm with all his might, <U+017F>ometimes he drew it back:
He would ofttimes lift him<U+017F>elf up altogether, and pre<U+017F>ently again be <U+017F>hrunk down:
And methought he was like tho<U+017F>e Capons legs, whereof children do leagthen or
contract the claws as they plea<U+017F>e, by pulling the <U+017F>inews. O how many pounds might
have been be<U+017F>tow'd on the curio<U+017F>ity of <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>uch plea<U+017F>ant po<U+017F>tures! But alas, they
had no other <U+017F>pectators then the Stars, and a mi<U+017F>erable Lacquay that knew not his
own happine<U+017F>s.</p>

               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having retir'd and as often approach'd the window, did at la<U+017F>t put the Letter
upon it, and being pre<U+017F>ently come down, he bid <hi>Gringalet</hi> take away the Ladder,
and return a long with him to <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e. He <U+017F>aid no more to him, he was <U+017F>o
taken up, to entertain the divers imaginations which <U+017F>eiz'd him, when he con<U+017F>ider'd
the Amazement his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <U+017F>hould be in, finding his Letter the next morning on
her window. He <U+017F>aid within him<U+017F>elf, That <U+017F>he would believe it were <U+017F>ome Bird had
brought it thither in his Break; or rather <hi>Love</hi> him<U+017F>elf, who flyes as well as the
Birds. In this Meditation he came to <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, but under<U+017F>tanding he was
a-bed, he would put his time to the be<U+017F>t advantage. He bought of the Gardener
<U+017F>even or eight Po<U+017F>ies half wither'd, wherein there were Pinks, Gilliflowers and
Marigolds, and <U+017F>ome other flowers, he fa<U+017F>tened them altogether to a long peice of
Packthread. Then out he went again, with the Lacquey, whom he made take the
Ladder with him, which was <U+017F>uch a burthen to him, that, if he had not fear'd to
di<U+017F>obey his Ma<U+017F>ter, who had charg'd him to do what<U+017F>oever <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>aid to him, he
had bid him carry it him<U+017F>elf. The Shepherd <U+017F>hewing him<U+017F>elf familiar with him, to
gain his more willing a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, asked him, If he had never <U+017F>een the Sonnets of
<hi>Ron<U+017F>ard:</hi> No; an<U+017F>wered the Lacquey, but I have <U+017F>een Sonnettes or little Bells at the
Knees of Morrice-dancers, and at the Collars of little Dogs. That's not it, replyes
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I <U+017F>peak to thee of a Book of Ver<U+017F>es: But I well perceive thou ha<U+017F>t not read
it, <U+017F>eeing thou <U+017F>peak'<U+017F>t of it <U+017F>o ignorantly. Know then, that the <hi>Poet</hi> <U+017F>ays in <U+017F>ome
places, that he adorn'd his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es door with <hi>No<U+017F>e-gays</hi> and <hi>Garlands</hi> of flowers.
I intend to imitate him; for he under<U+017F>tood the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Loving</hi> as well as any <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi>
alive. And to what purpo<U+017F>e, replyes <hi>Gringalet?</hi> were it not better keep the<U+017F>e
Po<U+017F>ies till to morrow? I would carry them to your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s in our <U+017F>ilver Ba<U+017F>in, with
a clean Napkin or'e my <U+017F>houlder, as the Attendants of Banquets do in the<U+017F>e parts,
and haply <U+017F>he would <U+017F>pit a couple of <U+017F>hillings into the Ba<U+017F>in to make the Boys
drink. Thou <U+017F>aye<U+017F>t very well, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but that I intend not my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <U+017F>hall be
at any charge; and then methinks thou art <U+017F>omewhat impudent, to think that I
would go drink with thee out of the money <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould give thee. Do not believe
it, but rather that there is nothing comparable to what I intend to do, for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
morning if <U+017F>he have a minde to any Po<U+017F>ies, there <U+017F>hall be no need to carry her
any, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall only need take them down at her door; be<U+017F>ides that, to <U+017F>end her any,
'tis a thing too ordinary. We mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>tore the cu<U+017F>toms of the Ancient <hi>Poets,</hi> who
fa<U+017F>tned flowers at the Portals of their Ladies Palaces, to repre<U+017F>ent to them that their
beauties were like Ro<U+017F>es, which they con<U+017F>idering continued not long <U+017F>hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve
to make their be<U+017F>t advantage of them, while they had the opportunity. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
con<U+017F>ider, that when it is Holiday at <U+017F>ome Temple, the Gates are beautified
with Garlands of Flowers, which ceremony is al<U+017F>o practi<U+017F>ed over the Gates of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
where <U+017F>ome Prince makes his Entrance. Now there is not any one on earth,
<U+017F>o much to be honor'd as <hi>Charite,</hi> and there is a perpetual Fe<U+017F>tival and Solemnity
in the place where <U+017F>he dwells, <U+017F>eeing men go ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly to adore her with all maner
of Ceremonies and Sacrifices. If it be Holiday in her Pari<U+017F>h, <U+017F>ays the Lacquey, why
do not you chime in her Steeple? This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e is in<U+017F>olent and in<U+017F>upportable, replys
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but I am not to puni<U+017F>h thee for't, for in what thou doe<U+017F>t, there is as much ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
as knavery. I wonder, that having <U+017F>o gallant a man to thy Ma<U+017F>ter, thou
art not more expert in the delightful Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Apollo.</hi> Why do<U+017F>t thou not learn
what the <hi>Mu<U+017F>es</hi> are? If I know not what <hi>Mu<U+017F>es</hi> are, I know well enough what
muzzling is and the <hi>mu<U+017F>ick</hi> of a Bagpipe: Is that it you would <U+017F>peak of? Ah! Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my!
cryed out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> have the gods given thee a tongue for no other purpo<U+017F>e then
to bla<U+017F>pheme again<U+017F>t them? be <U+017F>ilent henceforward, for thy <U+017F>ilence is better then
thy be<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>aid nothing at all to <hi>Gringalet,</hi> le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould oblige him to
<U+017F>peak and the Lacquey <U+017F>omewhat frighted with his reproofs, dur<U+017F>t not open his
mouth though he conceived he had not <U+017F>poken any thing ami<U+017F>s. When they were
come before the door of <hi>Charite</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, the Ladder was planted on one <U+017F>ide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and the Shepherd went to make fa<U+017F>t one end of the packthread to a nail which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43725:44"/>
he had ob<U+017F>erved there, but afterward he was in a peck of troubles, for he could not
tell where to make fa<U+017F>t the other. He had neither nail nor hammer; yet <U+017F>uch was
his opinion of his de<U+017F>ign, that he would execute it whatever came on't. At length
he thought it his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to fa<U+017F>ten his packthread to the iron-bar of a little win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
which was on the other <U+017F>ide: which, having carried back the ladder to that
<U+017F>ide, he pre<U+017F>ently did. Now though the<U+017F>e Garlands were acro<U+017F>s the door, and that
it might be conceiv'd they were put there out of <U+017F>pight, yet could he not believe
but they were very hand<U+017F>om, and were a great ornament to <hi>Charite's</hi> hou<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>Having accompli<U+017F>h'd this rare work, he came before the door; and having one
knee on the ground, he divers times ki<U+017F>s'd the clapper, calling it mo<U+017F>t happy, as
having often the honour to be touch'd by the fair hands of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, when <U+017F>he
knock'd at the door. As for the Lock, he ki<U+017F>s'd it not, nay on the contrary he <U+017F>poke
injuriou<U+017F>ly to it, becau<U+017F>e it kept in a Trea<U+017F>ure for which he <U+017F>igh'd, and hinder'd him
to enjoy it. But pre<U+017F>ently changing his conceit, he demands pardon for having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it, and acknowledg'd him<U+017F>elf oblig'd to it becau<U+017F>e it kept his Rivals from
offering any violence to <hi>Charite.</hi> While he was thus imploy'd, <hi>Leonora's</hi> Kitchin-maid,
who was lodg'd ju<U+017F>t over the gate, had occa<U+017F>ion to make water, and having
no chamber-pot, made u<U+017F>e of a broad-mouth'd gla<U+017F>s-viol that was in her window;
and having fill'd it, <U+017F>he emptied it into the <U+017F>treet, putting forth her arm, not looking
if there were any body under, for <U+017F>he was half a<U+017F>leep. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> feeling him<U+017F>elf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>prinkled
with that water, lifted up his head and perceiv'd the hand and the viol as
much as the time of the night would permit him. He thought it had been his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
who having di<U+017F>covered him, ca<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome perfum'd water on him as a <U+017F>ignal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:
So that to give her thanks, <U+017F>ays he, My faire<U+017F>t! what <U+017F>weet pre<U+017F>age is this!
Do you not ca<U+017F>t water on me, to <U+017F>ignifie unto me that you de<U+017F>ire to quench my
flames? But why, my <hi>Sun!</hi> do you deba<U+017F>e your quality, and will become <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora,</hi>
<U+017F>eeing you honour me with this <hi>dew?</hi> This he <U+017F>pake very low, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome of the
neighbours might overhear him; <U+017F>o that the Maid her<U+017F>elf did not hear it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>he had not quite emptied her bladder, <U+017F>he pi<U+017F>s'd a few drops more into the
viol, and ca<U+017F>t it ju<U+017F>t on his no<U+017F>e while he was looking up, which made him <U+017F>hake his
head a little as a Spaniel newly come out of the water; yet forgot he not to <U+017F>ay,
Ah <hi>Charite!</hi> Now I <U+017F>ee thy favours never go alone. But the Maid not thinking on
him, <U+017F>hut her window and went to bed again. So that being di<U+017F>aopointed the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of entertaining his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, as he conceiv'd, he knew not what was become of
her: And however <hi>Gringalet</hi> advi<U+017F>ed him to be gone, he told him he would not, and
that he had <U+017F>ome extraordinary di<U+017F>quiets whereof he de<U+017F>ired fir<U+017F>t to be delivered;
that is to <U+017F>ay, whether the window whence the water had been ca<U+017F>t, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he had left his Letter, belong'd to the <U+017F>ame chamber; and if that Paper were <U+017F>o
laid, that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s mu<U+017F>t perceive it? <hi>Gringalet</hi> told him, he doubted not but
'twas: But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> remon<U+017F>trated to him, that he was not <U+017F>o fully <U+017F>atisfied; and that
he would go up to the window which was above the gate, to try if he could <U+017F>ee <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
in her Chamber, and <U+017F>peak to her; and that to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf a true Lover, his
importunity mu<U+017F>t come to that point. The Lacquay, who knew not who <hi>Charite</hi>
was, and knew her not by any other name then <hi>Catherine,</hi> diverted him not from
his de<U+017F>ign, and <U+017F>o plac'd the ladder where he bid him. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> a<U+017F>cends, and finding
that window a great deal lower then the other, was very joyfull, and re<U+017F>olved in the
fir<U+017F>t place to ki<U+017F>s the ground thereof, becau<U+017F>e his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s had <U+017F>ometimes re<U+017F>ted her
elbow thereon. But in the mean time, <hi>Gringalet</hi> hearing people coming afar off, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>akes
the ladder which he held below, and ran away, fearing to be taken in an action
which could not <U+017F>eem otherwi<U+017F>e then wicked. As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> his amorous tran<U+017F>porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
kept him from thinking of any <U+017F>uch thing; and bowing him<U+017F>elf down to ki<U+017F>s the
<U+017F>tones which <hi>Charite</hi> had touch'd, he put his head into a platter of blood which the
Chirurgion had plac'd there, after he had that morning bled the Kitchin-maid. He
hath'd his no<U+017F>e in it, and overthrew it all on him<U+017F>elf; which put him into <U+017F>uch a
fright, that in violently removing him<U+017F>elf, he caus'd the ladder, which was not held
by any thing, to <U+017F>lip away, and <U+017F>o came to the ground with it. He recovered him<U+017F>elf
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43725:44"/>
on his feet the be<U+017F>t he could: But as he was calling <hi>Gringalet</hi> with a low voice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
four men, who pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by had heard the noi<U+017F>e of his fall, asked him what the
matter was; and perceiving the Ladder, take him for a Robber <U+017F>caling of hou<U+017F>es,
<U+017F>eeing he refu<U+017F>ed to make them any an<U+017F>wer. As for the Platter, which was al<U+017F>o faln
down, they <U+017F>aw it not, nor yet the Po<U+017F>ies he had fa<U+017F>tned; for their greate<U+017F>t care was
to make <U+017F>ure of him and carry him where they lodg'd, which was not far, that <U+017F>o
they might <U+017F>ecure his per<U+017F>on and know who he was <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>uffered him<U+017F>elf to be led
away peaceably, <U+017F>eeing his re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance would have been to no purpo<U+017F>e: Only what
he believ'd as to all the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, was, that they were Pyrates that would carry him
away, as hapned to divers Lovers mention'd in Hi<U+017F>tories. Do not you believe you
carry away <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ays he at every turn: You have but the one half of him; To
have him all, you mu<U+017F>t have had <hi>Charite</hi> too: And if you have but him alone, you
can make no advantage of him. Tho<U+017F>e that led him were <U+017F>ome <hi>Paris</hi>-Merchants
coming from the Tave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, who under<U+017F>tood nothing of all this: They only an<U+017F>wered
him, that he <U+017F>hould give them a good account of his planting of ladders again<U+017F>t the
walls of hou<U+017F>es. But as for his part, he no more regarded what they <U+017F>aid: And <U+017F>o
falling into his extravagarces, he imagin'd <U+017F>till that they carried him away for his
beauty, and that they would pre<U+017F>ent him to <U+017F>ome barbarous Prince<U+017F>s that was in love
with him. As he would have <U+017F>poken to them to that point, they came to the hou<U+017F>e
or the chiefe<U+017F>t of the company, who had brought the re<U+017F>t with him from <hi>Paris</hi> to
be merry. They had no <U+017F>ooner knock'd, but the Maid opens to them, having a
candle, by the light whereof they perceiv'd that he whom they led had his face and
cloaths all bloody: which made all cry out together, Ah mi<U+017F>chievous man! ah
murtherer! 'Tis not enough for him to take away peoples goods, but he mu<U+017F>t
take away their lives. But where's his <U+017F>word? Hath he thrown it in at <U+017F>ome cellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>window,
or hath he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> it in the wound of him whom he hath kill'd? Tell us, was't
in the <U+017F>treet that thou ha<U+017F>t committed this murther, or in <U+017F>ome hou<U+017F>e whence thou
came<U+017F>t out?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>et on thus with all their demands, began to apprehend what they would
<U+017F>ay to him; and viewing him<U+017F>elf all about, was amaz'd to <U+017F>ee his cloaths in that
pickle. If you <U+017F>ee any blood on me, <U+017F>ays he, it is none but my own, and it mu<U+017F>t needs
be that I have hurt my <U+017F>elf in the place where you found me. Alas! it is not I that
commit murthers; on the contrary, 'tis on my per<U+017F>on they are committed every
day, and <hi>Love</hi> him<U+017F>elf hath taken away my life above a thou<U+017F>and times already. If
you wonder you found me with a ladder, know I took it with me to do my devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to a Beauty, which is <U+017F>o wonderfull, that if there were <U+017F>uch another in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
there would be new Gyants who <U+017F>hould heap <hi>O<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> upon <hi>I elion,</hi> for to

            <p>This <U+017F>o extravagant a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e confirm'd to tho<U+017F>e Citizens, that the fellow had
a <U+017F>oft place in his head; and finding in him more <U+017F>implicity then mi<U+017F>chief, they
thought to make <U+017F>port with him, and <U+017F>o ask'd him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> What he would give them to
be <U+017F>et at Liberty? He told them he had no money, and that if he had, he would
not give them any, <U+017F>eeing he was not their Pri<U+017F>oner of War, that he <U+017F>hould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to pay his ran<U+017F>ome. While they were in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, one of the company
con<U+017F>idering his extraordinary habit, remembred, he had heard <U+017F>ay, that <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had
at his hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a one, and thereupon acquainting the re<U+017F>t therewith, they concluded

but it being too late to carry him thither, they di<U+017F>pos'd of him for that night. They
a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd him a bed apart, where he imagin'd more then <U+017F>lept; but the others being

<U+017F>pirit, that <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood not any thing of what he <U+017F>aid, but thought he tempted
her to di<U+017F>hone<U+017F>ty, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he ran away all in a fury, and went and conjur'd her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
not to keep a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o lo<U+017F>t as to his wits, any longer in his hou<U+017F>e. He to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
her, went to <U+017F>ee <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> and came ju<U+017F>t as he was going to beat <hi>Gringalet,</hi> for
having for<U+017F>aken the Shepherd. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> having had tidings of him, went to him,
and brought him to his hou<U+017F>e very joyfully. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being enter'd the hou<U+017F>e, reckon'd
up to him all his adventures. He would not have the <U+017F>pots taken out of his cloathes,
becau<U+017F>e not feeling him<U+017F>elf hurt any where, he did not imagine 'twas his own blood.
He remembred <U+017F>omewhat of the di<U+017F>h he had overturn'd, and believed it was <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
had been let blood in the arm, <U+017F>o that he conceiv'd it not di<U+017F>honorable for him
to carry her marks about him. Yet <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> having made appear to him, how the
te<U+017F>timonies of his affection ought not to be <U+017F>o publike, he put off his cloathes, and
bravely went to bed, while one of the Maids took them to wa<U+017F>h, <U+017F>aying there was
no <U+017F>hame in that, though 'twere day, <U+017F>eeing they might well affirm he was <U+017F>ick,
becau<U+017F>e he was in Love, health <U+017F>eldom lodging with Love. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> having left
him, a Lacquay from <hi>Leonora</hi> enters the hou<U+017F>e, and acquaints him, that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
de<U+017F>ir'd him to come and <U+017F>ee her pre<U+017F>ently. That Lady which pretended much to
gravity, was not accu<U+017F>tomed to betray <U+017F>o much familiarity; <U+017F>o that he wonder'd a
little at this me<U+017F><U+017F>age, yet withal, was very glad on't, becau<U+017F>e of the affection he bore
<hi>Angelica.</hi> He departed pre<U+017F>ently unknown of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and being come to <hi>Leonora</hi>'s.
She told him <U+017F>he had found a Letter on her window, which <U+017F>he would communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to him, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought it came from the Shepherd which was at his hou<U+017F>e,
and that there were found about her Gate, abundance of No<U+017F>e-gays, and a Ladder
in the mid<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>treet, which it was likely this excellent Lover had made u<U+017F>e of
to bring about his de<U+017F>ign. <hi>An<U+017F>elm</hi> told her <U+017F>he had gue<U+017F>s'd aright, and <U+017F>o gave her
the whole Hi<U+017F>tory of the adventure of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> wherein the Lover had omitted no
circum<U+017F>tance, but that he had not hang'd him<U+017F>elf at his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es door, as <hi>Iphis</hi>
did at <hi>Anaxareta</hi>'s, and that too, after he had di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed there a many Garlands of

                  <p>LOve having taken your <hi>Beauties</hi> for <hi>Armes,</hi> had long
<U+017F>ince laid a <hi>Seige</hi> to my <hi>Liberty,</hi> which was <hi>retreated</hi>
within the <hi>Fort</hi> of my Rea<U+017F>on, when without putting
him<U+017F>elf to the trouble of a <hi>Scalado,</hi> he is fled into my <hi>eyes,</hi>
and by that way is enter'd my <hi>heart,</hi> as a Robber breaks
into a hou<U+017F>e through the windows. The <U+017F>ufferings I am
in through its means are very violent, but being at length
appeas'd, he hath <U+017F>worn to me that the remedy lay in your
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43725:45"/>
power, and that all I had to do was to write to you of it.
But then <U+017F>eeing I was a <hi>Secretary</hi> very ill furni<U+017F>h'd with
the nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries of my profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he took a <hi>Quill</hi> out of his

<hi>Dart;</hi> He hath given me <hi>Paper</hi> made of his old <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,</hi>
by a <hi>cele<U+017F>tial</hi> Paper-maker: He took the <hi>Coals</hi> of
my Heart which was <hi>half-burnt,</hi> and having beaten them
to <hi>powder,</hi> he hath mingled them with my <hi>Teares,</hi> and
thereof hath furni<U+017F>h'd me with <hi>Ink,</hi> with which I have
written; and for to dry the Writing, he hath ca<U+017F>t <hi>A<U+017F>hes</hi>
which he took out of the <U+017F>ame place where he had the
Coals, which are already half con<U+017F>umed. When my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was written, he cut off a little peece of the <hi><U+017F>tring</hi> of his

            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> made <U+017F>port enough with this Letter, which was according to the <U+017F>tile
that mo<U+017F>t part of our ignorant Clarks u<U+017F>e to write at this day: who when they are
to write, excu<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves that they have not written a long time, or that they
have now pre<U+017F>um'd to write; and <U+017F>o be<U+017F>tow the whole Letter in telling they write
one, and acquaint you almo<U+017F>t with nothing el<U+017F>e. But there was one very plea<U+017F>ant
con<U+017F>ideration, which was, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> out of want of judgment had put down, that
<hi>Love</hi> had ca<U+017F>t du<U+017F>t on his writing to dry it, which yet could not be done till it was
fini<U+017F>h'd; and be<U+017F>ides he <U+017F>aid, that the <U+017F>ame <hi>God</hi> had given him of the <U+017F>tring of his
Bow, and <U+017F>ome wax out of his Torch, wherewith he had <U+017F>eal'd it: but how is't po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
he could write all this, if the Letter was already inclo<U+017F>ed? That made <hi>Leonora</hi>
laugh heartily, who was never weary to hear it read. Therefore <U+017F>he told <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi>
that <U+017F>he was de<U+017F>irous to enjoy the conver<U+017F>ation of his gentle Shepherd, as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
promis'd her. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> told her at his departure, that without fail he would
bring him with him in the evening. And indeed accordingly, when his clothes were
well wa<U+017F>h'd, and rub'd and dry, <U+017F>o that there was no <U+017F>pot to be <U+017F>een, he cloth'd
him<U+017F>elf; and having <U+017F>upp'd very cheerfully, went with his dear Entertainer to the
hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ired. They found no body in the Hall but <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
acco<U+017F>ted with a Complement taken out of one of the mo<U+017F>t celebrated <hi>Romances</hi> of
the Age; and if <U+017F>he had an<U+017F>wered him according to what was in the Book, he was
ready to return what follow'd. But <U+017F>eeing <hi>Angelica</hi> and <hi>Charite</hi> enter the room, he
was at a lo<U+017F>s of talk, and began to <U+017F>hake, as if he had been in a feaver. Yet taking
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> a<U+017F>ide, he had the boldne<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ay to him, Do you mark how tho<U+017F>e two
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43725:46"/>
Beauties enter'd in here? <hi>Angelica</hi> goes before, and <hi>Charite</hi> follows. A Clown
would think it is becau<U+017F>e <hi>Angelica</hi> is the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and <hi>Charite</hi> the Maid: But let us
bani<U+017F>h that opinion; the rea<U+017F>on is, that <hi>Angelica</hi> repre<U+017F>ents <hi>Aurora,</hi> to <hi>Charite</hi>
who is the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <U+017F>he always denotes her coming. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had an<U+017F>wered him
<U+017F>omwhat, to pre<U+017F>erve the honour of <hi>Angelica,</hi> if <hi>Leonora</hi> had not call'd him to know
what the Shepherd had <U+017F>aid. Fearing <U+017F>he might be angry for the di<U+017F>paragement he
did her Daughter, he made her believe that he <U+017F>aid, that Time that <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tracted from
all things, added every day <U+017F>ome fre<U+017F>h grace to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. <hi>Leonora</hi> ask'd him in
his ear, if 'twere not fit <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould tell <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>he took it not well that he came in the
night-time to <U+017F>cale her walls, and that it was a thing of ill example. But he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded
her to the contrary, <U+017F>aying, 'twere not good treating <U+017F>o rigorou<U+017F>ly the fir<U+017F>t
time a Mind <U+017F>o extravagant, if they intended to make <U+017F>port with him. Whereupon
there came in four Gentlewomen of the neighbourhood, and two young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who <U+017F>aid they came to dance to Songs. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> pre<U+017F>ently fearing any other
<U+017F>hould take <hi>Charite,</hi> went to her and demanded her hand with a mo<U+017F>t humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
But he was no <U+017F>ooner in the dance, but <hi>Angelica</hi> told him he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ing, and
that a Shepherd (as he was) mu<U+017F>t needs know a many Songs. Know the number of
the Stars, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> count the Shells in the Sea, the ripe Ears of the Harve<U+017F>t, the
Apples of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Chee<U+017F>es of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Grapes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and
you have the number of my Songs. But I <U+017F>hould have had here my <hi>Nomenclature,</hi>
which my Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Adrian</hi> hath taken away from me: I <U+017F>hall now <U+017F>ing but <U+017F>ome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Song. Ju<U+017F>t then a Gentlewoman of the company began to <U+017F>ing, being weary of
doing nothing; and when <U+017F>he had done, they made <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> believe it was his turn to
<U+017F>ing a Song: whereupon he began to <U+017F>ay,
<q>
                  <l>O Shepherde<U+017F>s! this is the time,</l>
                  <l>See now the gra<U+017F>s hath put on green.</l>
               </q>
And he <U+017F>till look'd on <hi>Charite</hi> with a corner of his eye, to tell her 'twas <U+017F>he he <U+017F>pake
of. His manner of dancing was very plea<U+017F>ant: For be<U+017F>ides that he pac'd it out of
<U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, he quaver'd his body from one <U+017F>ide to the other, as if his ribs had been di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed.
In the mean time the Company, who had been acquainted with his humor,
confe<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>till they were much honoured to enjoy him: But becau<U+017F>e they would
not importune him, there was none but the Gentlewomen <U+017F>ung afterwards. The
time to retire being come, they gave over dancing: And becau<U+017F>e it was not very
light on the <U+017F>tairs, there came a Lacquay with a candle to light down the company,
but the wind blew it out before he was half way down; <U+017F>o that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
at a lo<U+017F>s by rea<U+017F>on of the ob<U+017F>curity of the place, cry'd out in this extremity:
Page! go thy ways to <hi>Charite,</hi> and touch her <hi>heart</hi> of <U+017F>tone with an iron, and there
will i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out fire as out of a flint and <U+017F>teel. You are in the right on't, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> replies
<hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> But to <U+017F>trike out the <U+017F>parks of her heart, it mu<U+017F>t have been the iron of
the darts of your eyes that <U+017F>hould touch it; and the tinder of your Love, and the
Match of your De<U+017F>ire mu<U+017F>t have been all ready for to light our candle. Is there all
that ado, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is?</hi> I have another invention that's readier: Page, go thy ways
immediately, and light thy candle at the eyes of <hi>Charite,</hi> there <U+017F>he hath alwayes
flames; but take heed the tallow be not quite melted. As he <U+017F>pake tho<U+017F>e words,
<hi>Charite</hi> comes with a candle which <U+017F>he had bin to light in the Kitchin. Ha! prai<U+017F>e be
to <hi>Love</hi> (continued be) you <U+017F>ee the power of the fire of the rare<U+017F>t Beauty in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>.
And though every one began to laugh at his extravagant imagination, yet could
he not be per<U+017F>waded but that the candle had been lighted at the eyes of <hi>Charite:</hi> and
when <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> at his own hou<U+017F>e would <U+017F>eem to contradict him, he alleadg'd for a
very pertinent rea<U+017F>on, that it was read in the <hi>Poets,</hi> that <hi>Cupid</hi> always lighted his
Torch at the Eyes of his Mother and other Fair ones, and that it was not the fir<U+017F>t
time that the Beauties had flames. Not to flatter you, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> to him, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
you that I never ob<U+017F>erved any <hi>fire</hi> in the face of <hi>Charite;</hi> but once that <U+017F>he had a
certain <hi><U+017F>cab</hi> on her cheek, which they call <hi>wild-fire.</hi> And to convince you of your
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43725:46"/>
errour, do you not con<U+017F>ider, that when the candle was blown out, we <U+017F>hould not
have been without light, if that beauty had any in her eyes, <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he was in the
place where we were in darkne<U+017F>s: You are no good Phylo<U+017F>opher, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> you
are to know, that the fire which is in the eyes of <hi>Charite,</hi> is like the Elementary
fire, which we cannot <U+017F>ee, though we are well a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd that it is between the Ayr and
the Orb of the Moon. Now if this rare fire of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s be invi<U+017F>ible as to us, 'tis
becau<U+017F>e it is <U+017F>o pure and <U+017F>ubtile, that our eyes cannot perceive it; and if her flame
be fully <U+017F>een when <U+017F>he lights a candle, or <U+017F>ets a peice of wood on fire, 'tis the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>But how<U+017F>oever, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>trove to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf an able <hi>Naturali<U+017F>t,</hi> yet the next
day <hi>An<U+017F>elm</hi> renew'd the conte<U+017F>tation upon the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject, to make him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>port, but the Shepherd had the di<U+017F>cretion to be <U+017F>ilent, le<U+017F>t the other being incens'd
again<U+017F>t him, <U+017F>hould carry him no more to the place, where his heart was in Pri<U+017F>on.
A while after Dinner, walking together on the back<U+017F>ide of <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Garden, they
found the back door open. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> went in, and being advanc'd a good way into
the Garden, he came back and told <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> he had <U+017F>een <hi>Charite</hi> a<U+017F>leep on one of the
beds. The bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was, that her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s being gone abroad upon <U+017F>ome vi<U+017F>it, <U+017F>he
had taken the opportunity to walk, and having repo<U+017F>s'd her <U+017F>elf in that place, was
in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly fallen a<U+017F>leep. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> willing to take the advantage of this occa<U+017F>ion, made
<U+017F>igns to <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> that he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay at the door, while in the mean time he would
go <U+017F>ee her, but he <U+017F>till followed him to <U+017F>ee what were done. The Shepherd was <U+017F>o
afraid to make the lea<U+017F>t noi<U+017F>e, that he went as gently as if he had trod on thorns, and
when he was come to the bed which <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had <U+017F>hewed to him, he perceiv'd <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
laid down on a mo<U+017F><U+017F>ie bank, tapi<U+017F>tred with gra<U+017F>s. Her face was towards the
sky, and her mouth open, <U+017F>o that the Sun <U+017F>hining on it, as he did, the time of the day
might be known, by looking on her teeth, which were large, and proportionally
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>s'd, upon which reach'd the <U+017F>hadow of her no<U+017F>e, which was <U+017F>o <U+017F>lender, that
it <U+017F>eem'd to have been plac'd there as the needle of a Quadrant. The Shepherd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>h'd
with admiration to <U+017F>ee her, was jealous of every thing. He was angry that
her body made any <U+017F>hadow, and he could have wi<U+017F>h'd to have been there without
it. In the Sun beams which pa<U+017F>s'd through the trees, he ob<U+017F>erved the Motes turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>wiftly about, he was angry at that, and <U+017F>trove to drive them away with his hat,
believing they were a fighting who <U+017F>hould fir<U+017F>t go and ki<U+017F>s <hi>Charite.</hi> Con<U+017F>idering
al<U+017F>o, that the leaves were not thick enough for to fan his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s from the heat of
the Sun, he <U+017F>tood before her, to hinder him to <U+017F>ee her any more. That which
troubled him mo<U+017F>t, was that he <U+017F>till heard <U+017F>ome little noi<U+017F>e, which he was afraid
might awake her, and that if <U+017F>he went away, he might not <U+017F>ee her at his plea<U+017F>ure.
How trouble<U+017F>om is this wind! <U+017F>ays he, very <U+017F>oftly: 'tis not content to blow in her
no<U+017F>e, but it mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o keep a <U+017F>tir among the leaves. Methinks I can hear hither the
noi<U+017F>e of the wheels of the Suns Chariot, nay I think the trees make a noi<U+017F>e in grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the fruits in ripening; but above all, I hate tho<U+017F>e flyes that come humming
about here, they would go and <U+017F>uck the ro<U+017F>es out of <hi>Charite</hi>'s cheeks, like tho<U+017F>e of
<hi>Leucippus</hi> and <hi>Eudoxa,</hi> and in the mean time they'll <U+017F>ting her. If I can catch but
one, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall pay for the re<U+017F>t. I will <U+017F>acrifice it to my Deity, and will offer it up
before her. Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he put him<U+017F>elf into more different po<U+017F>tures to catch
flyes, then ever did the Emperour <hi>Domitian.</hi> He lifted him<U+017F>elf up, he <U+017F>hrunk down,
he leapt in the ayr, he opened his right hand, then <U+017F>hut it again pre<U+017F>ently, without
catching any thing but wind; and be<U+017F>ides that, he made <U+017F>uch faces, that no mask
or revels can have as plea<U+017F>ant vi<U+017F>ards. When he <U+017F>aw he could not catch any, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
him<U+017F>elf to drive them away with his hat, to hinder them to come near her
Yet there was one <U+017F>o pre<U+017F>umptuous, that when he was a little turn'd a<U+017F>ide, it pitch'd
on the no<U+017F>e of the Beauty, where it continued <U+017F>ome while with much gravity. 'Tis
very well, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> Is there the place where you intend to <U+017F>it Lady Pre<U+017F>ident? do<U+017F>t
thou prophane that fair Throne? but that plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>hall co<U+017F>t the dear. In <U+017F>aying
<U+017F>o very <U+017F>oftly, he put forth his hand gently, and thinking to catch the fly, <U+017F>truck
<hi>Charite</hi> on the no<U+017F>e with all his might; who thereupon awoke in a <U+017F>tart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43725:47"/>
he had <U+017F>truck her on purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ays to him, Be<U+017F>hrew you for a foul Game<U+017F>ter;
I <U+017F>hall feel this blow a good while. Could you not have awoken me more gently?
While <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> who had <U+017F>een all, and was hid behinde the trees, came
to appea<U+017F>e her, making it appear, that it was <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s intention to oblige her, by
taking a fly which would have <U+017F>tung her in the no<U+017F>e. And <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>aid it was true, and
the greate<U+017F>t misfortune was, that for all that he mi<U+017F>s'd the catching of that mi<U+017F>chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Vermine, that he might have puni<U+017F>hed it for the hurt it had cau<U+017F>ed. After
this, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> asked <hi>Charite,</hi> If there were no body at home? She an<U+017F>wered him,
That they were all gone abroad, but that <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> would be back very
<U+017F>uddenly. Well, <U+017F>aid he, lets go into the hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>tay for them. <hi>Charite</hi> as
<U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he came in, fell to work about <U+017F>ome Linen, to recover the time <U+017F>he had
lo<U+017F>t, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he wetted the thread between her lips, to make it the more
ea<U+017F>ily go through the eye of the needle, went and took it out of her hands, and <U+017F>uckt
it a good while, <U+017F>aying he would endeavour to moderate his flames by that charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moy<U+017F>ture, which was well as good as the dew of <hi>Aurora:</hi> And when <hi>Charite</hi>
<U+017F>natcht the thread from him again, wondring at his folly: What, my faire<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ays
he, <U+017F>hall I not ki<U+017F>s what hath touched your mouth, <U+017F>eeing all the la<U+017F>t night I did
nothing but ki<U+017F>s my own hand, becau<U+017F>e ye<U+017F>terday it toucht yours when we danc'd,
and the day before I did much more then that. There he <U+017F>topt, for what he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to <U+017F>ay, was <U+017F>o particular, that he mu<U+017F>t have conceal'd it. He would have <U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the door that he had ki<U+017F>t, and in con<U+017F>equence of that he mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>aid <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
concerning his Letter, whereof he would not <U+017F>ay any thing to <hi>Charite</hi> before
<hi>An<U+017F>elme.</hi> Yet he was not a little troubled, that <U+017F>he di<U+017F>covered not that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een
it, and that <U+017F>he were truly con<U+017F>cious of his affection; but he imagined it was her
mode<U+017F>ty, which indeed was to be admired. He thereupon re<U+017F>umes his former di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,
and on a <U+017F>udden, which <U+017F>uited well with his humour, he came and told her;
that he would thenceforward ki<U+017F>s his hand no more, if <hi>Charite</hi> did not pardon him
more <U+017F>olemnly then <U+017F>he had done for the blow he gave her, and <U+017F>o immediately he
went and kneel'd down before his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, expecting what <U+017F>he would order: But <U+017F>he
who was not accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>ee men cloathed as he was, took him for no other then
<U+017F>ome Jack-pudding in St. <hi>Germains Fair,</hi> and could not tell what to an<U+017F>wer to his
extraordinary di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, <U+017F>o that he was fain to take her <U+017F>ilence for con<U+017F>ent: It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a little after, that in <U+017F>owing <U+017F>he prickt her finger with the needle, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
<U+017F>eeing the blood, cryed out thus, Such is the <hi>Nectar</hi> that flows out of the wounds
which the Gods receive, <U+017F>uch was the blood i<U+017F><U+017F>ued out of the hand of <hi>Venus,</hi> when
<hi>Diomedes</hi> hurt her in the <hi>Trojan</hi> war, and it was in the <U+017F>ame manner <U+017F>he bled, when
going to gather Ro<U+017F>es the prickles prickt her: and if the Ro<U+017F>es which were then
white, had not been Metamorphos'd into red, and that it were yet to be done, it
were the blood of <hi>Charite</hi> <U+017F>hould do that miracle; but in<U+017F>tead thereof, it <U+017F>hall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<U+017F>ome new flower, as well as that of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us.</hi> In <U+017F>o <U+017F>aying, he took
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall <U+017F>hreds of cloath out of <hi>Charite</hi>'s Panier, wherewith he wiped off the
blood that run down her hand, and <U+017F>o put it into his pocket with <U+017F>ome other rags
of cloath: he believed him<U+017F>elf as happy in having this, as when he had the <U+017F>tains
they had taken out of his cloathes: yet was he not <U+017F>atisfied, having found a bottom
of red yarn, which his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s made u<U+017F>e of in <U+017F>ome Tapi<U+017F>try work, he took five
or <U+017F>ix needlefulls, and made a Bracelet of it. <hi>Charite</hi> who was not plea<U+017F>ed at it, told
him he was to blame <U+017F>o to <U+017F>poil the yarn, <U+017F>o that he was fain to make this fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to her. How now cruel one! do you deny this poor favour to one that <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<U+017F>o much affliction for your Love? have not you ob<U+017F>erved, that they be<U+017F>tow
collars on the dogs of great Princes, wherein their Arms are engraved, that where
ever they go, it may be <U+017F>aid they belong to <U+017F>uch a one? And do you not know, that
in a Forre<U+017F>t there was a Stag found with a golden collar, wherein were engraved
certain Letters, which made appear that fifty millions of years before, he had been
<hi>Alexanders</hi> the Great? In like manner it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>ome Bracelet,
whereby it might be judg'd as <U+017F>oon as I am <U+017F>een, that I am, not your Stag, for then
I <U+017F>hould be devoured by <hi>Acteons</hi> dogs, but your <U+017F>lave and <U+017F>ervant of Love. What

my inclinations, the <hi>Counte<U+017F>s</hi> of my conceptions, the <hi>Barone<U+017F>s</hi> of my actions, and the

            <p>While he was in the<U+017F>e Complements, <hi>Charite's</hi> finger bled <U+017F>till: which <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi>
ob<U+017F>erving, told the <hi>Shepherd</hi> he was to blame to amu<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much in vain talk,
and not look for <U+017F>ome remedy for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es wound. He wi<U+017F>h'd him<U+017F>elf as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as <hi>Machaon</hi> or <hi>E<U+017F>culapius</hi> for to lance it; and pre<U+017F>ently went out of the Hall
into <U+017F>ome <U+017F>lutti<U+017F>h place to look Cobwebs. He entreated <hi>Pallas</hi> to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him, that
he might <U+017F>oon find it; for he believed <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome power over that In<U+017F>ect which
had <U+017F>ometime been a Tapi<U+017F>try-maker, and that <U+017F>he her<U+017F>elf had thus metamorphos'd.
But <hi>Lemora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> coming in, he gave over his <U+017F>earch, as al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
had <U+017F>topt the blood her<U+017F>elf. <hi>Leonora</hi> having drawn in <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> into a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
of husbandry, came to tell him of <U+017F>ome young gra<U+017F>s in her garden which had born
fruit, and was de<U+017F>irous he might <U+017F>ee them. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> follow'd them out of civility,
though he was very loth to leave <hi>Charite.</hi> When he was returned, he found her in
the Court <U+017F>itting on a <U+017F>tone: Leaving all other company, he went and kneel'd on
one knee before her, for to entertain her.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Gringalet</hi> was entred the Court, and was bethinking him<U+017F>elf
how to be reveng'd of him, for having been the cau<U+017F>e that his Ma<U+017F>ter would have
beaten him; and that he had given him nothing of all he had promis'd him for his

yet he <U+017F>aid nothing. He <U+017F>uffer'd the Sun-beams to unite in the middle, and made the

he <U+017F>cratch'd it a good while before he would re<U+017F>olve to di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elf: At la<U+017F>t
flinging his hat down, and <U+017F>eeing it yet burning, he in a great a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment <U+017F>aid thus;
O miracle! <hi>Charite</hi> would have turn'd my whole body into a<U+017F>hes, if I had not <U+017F>tood
away: But why a miracle, <U+017F>eeing it is well known <U+017F>he can enflame all things? and
therefore I <U+017F>hould not have come <U+017F>o near her as I did, if I had not a de<U+017F>ire to be

            <p>Was there over <U+017F>uch a plea<U+017F>ant <hi><U+017F>ally</hi> as this heard on? <hi>Leonora, Angelica,</hi> and

to <U+017F>eem to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> that they believ'd all he <U+017F>aid, they took his hat and view'd all about

How now, hou<U+017F>wife! <U+017F>ays <hi>Leonora</hi> to her, will you burn all tho<U+017F>e that love you?
Go your ways I pray quickly into the Kitchin, and put your head in a pail of water

with good right given it me; if I <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>tore it, he would be angry with me,
and would di<U+017F>own me again for one of his favourites. <hi>Charite,</hi> who thought this no
<U+017F>atisfaction, pull'd him by the breeches as hard as <U+017F>he could; and another Maid a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting
her, he was forc'd into the Kitchin: where this other Maid, which was <U+017F>he
that had be<U+017F>prinkled him with the Ro<U+017F>e-water, told him, that he mu<U+017F>t not think to
carry any thing away from their hou<U+017F>e. And when he had replied, he had nothing
but tho<U+017F>e Favours which were due to him, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid that he <U+017F>hould then reciprocally
give others to <hi>Charite;</hi> and that it was never <U+017F>een that a <U+017F>ervant took any thing
away from his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, without leaving <U+017F>omwhat in<U+017F>tead of it. It happen'd in this
<U+017F>cuffle, that one of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is's</hi> <U+017F>hoes was untied: This maid, who was a <U+017F>turdy quean,
took it quite off his foot, and <U+017F>aid, This favour <U+017F>hall be for <hi>Charite</hi> from her <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:
Now in good time he may go his wayes, we do not ask any thing of him.
Whereupon <U+017F>he di<U+017F>mis'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who was very glad to have gotten off <U+017F>o cheap; and
having taken his leave of the company, went along with <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> in a very plea<U+017F>ant
po<U+017F>ture. Having but one Shoe, he went limping along for fear of <U+017F>poiling his Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<U+017F>u<U+017F>taining him<U+017F>elf with a <U+017F>taff that <hi>Gringalet</hi> had <U+017F>ent him. Be<U+017F>ides that he had
taken his half-burnt Hat, which render'd him <U+017F>o gracefull, that he <U+017F>eem'd to be <U+017F>ome
maim'd Souldier newly e<U+017F>caped out of a Battel. And indeed he him<U+017F>elf was <U+017F>aying,
that as Warriours that have been at <U+017F>ome skirmi<U+017F>h do carefully pre<U+017F>erve their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and Head-piece, if an unhappy blow hath made any impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion on them, that
<U+017F>o afterwards they may <U+017F>ay they were the fir<U+017F>t in the Charge; <U+017F>o would he pre<U+017F>erve
his burnt Hat, in remembrance of the danger he had been in by his approach to
<hi>Charite,</hi> and that peradventure he would hang it up for a Trophy in the Temple of
<hi>Love. An<U+017F>elme,</hi> with a <U+017F>erious look, told him he approved of the de<U+017F>ign: but it's
to be thought he laugh'd under the mask of <U+017F>uch an extravagancie; for he had well
ob<U+017F>erv'd how his Lacquay had burnt his hat with a burning-gla<U+017F>s, and had purpo<U+017F>ely
permitted it. As for <hi>Gringalet,</hi> who with his fellow-Lacquay came behind, he could
not refrain laughing, and made more wry faces then a Puppet-players Ape.</p>
            <p>When they were come home, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> gave <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> a gray Hat, and other Shoes.
And the Shepherd ruminating on what had happened to him that afternoon, <U+017F>wore
he never ob<U+017F>erv'd in any book, that any Lover had in <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a while met with <U+017F>o
many rare adventures. He took out of his pocket the Linnen rags which had <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite's</hi>
blood; and having ki<U+017F>s'd them divers times, and his bracelet of Yarn al<U+017F>o, he
accounted all his pains well be<U+017F>tow'd, and he was nothing troubled neither at the lo<U+017F>s
of his <U+017F>hoe, nor burning of his hat. As for the Bracelet, he made a vow to wear it
on his wri<U+017F>t for ever; and as for the Linnen, he lock'd it up with the other Jewels
he had before receiv'd of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>All <U+017F>upper-time he talk'd of nothing but the heat of the beams which i<U+017F><U+017F>ued out
of <hi>Charite's</hi> eyes, and all the night he dream'd of nothing el<U+017F>e. So that towards
break of day, the <U+017F>trong impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions he had of it made him dream that <hi>Love</hi> had
plac'd him on a great block, where he burnt from the <U+017F>ole of the foot to the crown
of the head. Awaking as he was in that torment, he per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in the opinion that
he was in a fire; and <U+017F>tarting out of his bed, he went out of the chamber without
any thing about him but his <U+017F>hirt, and went down <U+017F>tairs crying as loud as he could,
Help, help! I burn! Ah cruel <hi>Charite!</hi> why are not your flames more remi<U+017F>s?
In that po<U+017F>ture went he to a Spring which was in the middle of the Garden, and
ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf in, hoping to quench his fire. The ba<U+017F>on was four foot deep, and there
was water enough to drown him, if he had <U+017F>taid there any time. But God, who ever
relieves Innocents and fools, ordered the Gardener to be already at his work. He
hearing his outcries, and the noi<U+017F>e of his throwing him<U+017F>elf into the Spring, came to
<U+017F>ee what ail'd him: He came to him as he was dabling in the water like a Frog; and
after he had <U+017F>uffer'd him to bath and refre<U+017F>h him<U+017F>elf as much as he would, he help'd
him out. Had it not been for that good fortune, we <U+017F>hould not have been troubled
to make his Hi<U+017F>tory any longer, and his life and adventures <U+017F>hould here have been
at a period.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:43725:48"/>
When he was out of the water, he came a little to him<U+017F>elf, and imagin'd not he
felt any more heat, yet could he not get into the hou<U+017F>e without <U+017F>haking, and would
not go to bed again, out of an opinion he had, that his bed produced flames. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elme</hi>
got up to <U+017F>ee what rea<U+017F>on he had to make <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e, and having had the
<U+017F>tory from his own mouth, and from the Gardener, he made him change his <U+017F>hirt,
and put on his cloathes, that he might walk abroad with him to drive away the
time. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> was never more at a lo<U+017F>s then now, he believ'd he had undertaken a
greater charge then he imagin'd, and though <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> might be in the fault, yet would
they require him better then he was, <U+017F>o that he knew not if it were his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to
<U+017F>end him back to his Cou<U+017F>in. While they walkt, he thought fit to try if there were
no means to re<U+017F>tore his minde to a better compo<U+017F>ure. Pray tell me one thing, <U+017F>ays
he to him, Why do you <U+017F>o much dread the fire of <hi>Love?</hi> Why do not you get a
good Pail of water by your bed <U+017F>ide when you go to bed, that you may quench it if
it lighten in good earne<U+017F>t? Alas! friend, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> my fire is a wildefire; its
compo<U+017F>s'd of <hi>Sulphur vive, quick-lime, naphte</hi> and <hi>camphire,</hi> it burns in the water,
and if it hath been quencht in thy Spring, that hath only been by good hap. But
do not you think that the Frigidites of the minde, replyes <hi>An<U+017F>elm,</hi> may do <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
again<U+017F>t it? why do you not fortifie your <U+017F>elf with them? Alas! replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
with a <U+017F>igh, it is a long time ago <U+017F>ince my heart hath had no ice, and that there is
nothing but flames in<U+017F>tead. Will not artificial waters quench an artificial fire, <U+017F>ays
<hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> weep till yours be quite out. My tears flow from without, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
but the burning coals are within, to what purpo<U+017F>e were they? it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem rather
it were better not to <U+017F>hed them at all, that <U+017F>o remaining within they may a<U+017F><U+017F>wage the
internal ravages of my love. Yet not to lye, when I weep, I feel <U+017F>ome refre<U+017F>hment,
and I am glad that people put me in minde of it. That's very well, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi>
<U+017F>hed then abundance of tears. when you are before <hi>Charite,</hi> who<U+017F>e looks are <U+017F>o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,
that ye<U+017F>terday <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o near burning you, that you feel it yet. But now
I think of it, whence comes it <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>o many flames <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he hath al<U+017F>o as many
fro<U+017F>ts, at lea<U+017F>t for all other Lovers, if not for you? The fire is in her eyes, and the
fro<U+017F>t in her heart, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> its a good di<U+017F>tance between tho<U+017F>e two, <U+017F>o that they
both pre<U+017F>erve their power. You are in the right, replyes <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> but hath <U+017F>he not
<U+017F>now on her neck and brea<U+017F>t, nay, and on her face too? <U+017F>hould not all this mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the heat that is in the torches of her eyes? There is in that a Miracle, an<U+017F>wers
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and yet it is no novelty; for I have read of certain mountains in the world
covered with <U+017F>now, at the top whereof there i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out flames. I grant you that, <U+017F>ays
<hi>An<U+017F>elm,</hi> yet you mu<U+017F>t ever allow me, that the <U+017F>now which is about the flames of
<hi>Charite,</hi> doth extreamly abate the violence of the heat, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he cannot burn
you, but when you approach near her, as <U+017F>he did ye<U+017F>terday, and cannot ca<U+017F>t her fire
from her hou<U+017F>e hither? <U+017F>o that if you have felt any hear,'t hath been imaginary, and
the <U+017F>ubtile <hi>Morpheus</hi> hath deceiv'd you. I almo<U+017F>t believe it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> for that cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
companion changes him<U+017F>elf into fire and water when he plea<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> continued in that belief, <U+017F>uffering him<U+017F>elf to be per<U+017F>waded by the Antithe<U+017F>es,
and other <U+017F>ubtilties of Poetry, that it were in his power to make that there be fire, or
yee, or <U+017F>now, and many other <U+017F>trange things in his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, according as it pleas'd
him to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o. His opinion was, that there was no more to do then imagine them,
to give them reality. I do not know, whether the Poets are of <U+017F>o light a faith,
but they have at lea<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame conceits, and they build their de<U+017F>igns on the like
foundations. They hunt out plenty of contradictions, to advance their Artifices,
and they'll de<U+017F>cribe you a brea<U+017F>t of Ivory which arrows cannot wound, in the <U+017F>ame
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s to whom they had before given one of <U+017F>now, which receives any impre<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
'Twere a long work to <U+017F>um up all their ab<U+017F>urdities: it <U+017F>uffices as to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e,

and ever after entertained him with much confidence, <U+017F>hewing him how that
he mu<U+017F>t not fear that <hi>Charite</hi> would burn him, <U+017F>eeing there are no <hi>Divinities</hi> <U+017F>o re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pectle<U+017F>s

what is this departure <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden, that I <U+017F>hall not bid her adieu, and ki<U+017F>s her hand.
Ah! ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed opportunity! this long time <U+017F>hall I not recover thee. I mu<U+017F>t <hi>lo<U+017F>e</hi> my

mu<U+017F>t for<U+017F>ake the <hi>Fields</hi> and the condition of <hi>Shepherd.</hi> But that nothing <U+017F>hould
burthen his minde, his good friend a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him over and above, that they had elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
enough to per<U+017F>wade <hi>Charite</hi> to go along with them into <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> as they
had already propo<U+017F>ed. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> told him, that he ever cheer'd him<U+017F>elf up with that
hope: and that if he had not <U+017F>poken of it, 'twas becau<U+017F>e there had not any occa<U+017F>ion

which had been borrow'd for him. In the <U+017F>ame manner <U+017F>pent he the two

<U+017F>aid to <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> at Supper, that he thought that <hi>Nymph</hi> was dead. You are extreamly
deceiv'd replyes <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> <U+017F>he is naturally immortal. The Eccho which an<U+017F>wered
you a while ago, is a member of that Mu<U+017F>ician Eccho, which I mention'd to you:
now it is Metamorphos'd into a <U+017F>ubtile voyce, which can go from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

with a large peice of Linen cloath, I retird about fifty paces, and having call'd on her,
I let her an<U+017F>wer a good while then I pull'd a cord that I held, and all of a <U+017F>udden let
down the cloath, under which I took her, as a Partridge under the net. She is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo<U+017F>s'd

let me know it, and that thou conceal not from me if <U+017F>he <U+017F>tand in much the keeping.
She is no charge to me, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> I only <U+017F>ing <U+017F>ometimes near her little lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or el<U+017F>e I rap with a knife again<U+017F>t a trencher, and <U+017F>he is nouri<U+017F>h'd with that found
which <U+017F>he ea<U+017F>ily hears. Thou art as ingenious as <hi>Daedalus,</hi> and as <U+017F>ubtile as <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi>
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I remember that the Prince of <hi>Ithaca</hi> lock'd up the winds in a leather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag,
and carried them in that manner in his <U+017F>hip. They invention is well worth his;
there was never yet found in any book <U+017F>uch a thing as the tran<U+017F>portation of
Eccho's.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>peak no more of it, fearing to lo<U+017F>e the plea<U+017F>ure
which he hoped for. The time of their departure being come, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> <U+017F>aid to him,
that <U+017F>eeing they were to return to the City, 'twas nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary he ca<U+017F>t off his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit,
otherwi<U+017F>e people would follow him as an Inbabitant of the New world. At
fir<U+017F>t <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would by no means con<U+017F>ent; but at length <U+017F>eeing that <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> threatned
him that he would never take notice of him, he took his former Cloaths which were
brought from the Country-mans hou<U+017F>e, where he had lodg'd when he became a
Shepherd. The Cloak was of Spani<U+017F>h cloth of a light-foot gray, and the Linings of
Taby pink'd of the <U+017F>ame colour, and the Doublet and Breeches were of the <U+017F>ame
<U+017F>tuff: Yet did he not conceive him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o brave in this cloathing as in the other; and
the regret he had to quit it had not been <U+017F>ilenc'd, if <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had not remon<U+017F>trated
to him, that men cea<U+017F>e not to be of a profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, though they <U+017F>ometimes leave off

               </gap>al habit thereof; that the Souldier is not always oblig'd to have his armour
about him, and that Kings lo<U+017F>e nothing of their Maje<U+017F>ty when they have not on
their Royal robes. So the Pa<U+017F>toral habit and all its equipage was di<U+017F>pos'd into the
bottom of <hi>An<U+017F>elm's</hi> Coach; and when they had well din'd, they got in, and drave
away for <hi>Paris.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme's</hi> hou<U+017F>e was <U+017F>omewhere about the <hi>Temple,</hi> and was one of the faire<U+017F>t in
that quarter: yet <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> found it tedious to be there, and ever and anon made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
his de<U+017F>ire to go and <U+017F>ee <hi>Charite. An<U+017F>elme</hi> willing to content him, <U+017F>aid, that on
the morrow he would go and <U+017F>ee if there were any means to give her a vi<U+017F>it: but
a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he was return'd thence, he comes to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <U+017F>ays to him, You will be
amaz'd at the news I bring you; 'tis ill, and yet withall 'tis good. <hi>Charite</hi> is not in
<hi>Paris;</hi> but <U+017F>he is not departed hence, but to go into <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts.</hi> Ah! that's bravely
<U+017F>poken, cry'd out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for if I am troubled at her departure, I mu<U+017F>t on the other
<U+017F>ide be glad that <U+017F>he is gone into that place where I have <U+017F>o much wi<U+017F>h'd her. But
tell me, doth <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> go along with her, and how this is come about?
They go, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> So that to be neer the object I adore, I mu<U+017F>t be for that
journy my <U+017F>elf. <hi>Leonora,</hi> you are to know, being weary of the world <U+017F>ince the lo<U+017F>s
of her husband, intends to live in that Country, which is full of <hi>Shepherds,</hi> where <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hall be entertain'd by <hi>Tircis,</hi> who <U+017F>till bewails the death of his <hi>Cleon.</hi> Oh how well
is it con<U+017F>idered of her! <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I am confident <U+017F>he hath read the life of the good
King <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilius,</hi> and that <U+017F>he intends to imitate him. He for<U+017F>ook his Royalties, and
came and liv'd with his daughters among the Shepherds of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> who cheer'd
him up with their <hi>Ecclogues:</hi> <U+017F>o will <U+017F>he take a plea<U+017F>ure to hear our Country <U+017F>ongs;
for your part, you mu<U+017F>t become Poet and Mu<U+017F>itian as well as I.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> di<U+017F>cover'd his <U+017F>atisfaction by many more words to that purpo<U+017F>e; and if he
<U+017F>aid <hi>[you]</hi> to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> 'twas becau<U+017F>e he conceiv'd he ought not to be familiar with
all the world, and that e<U+017F>pecially in the City, where men lived not after the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
mode. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> promi<U+017F>ed, that within a few dayes they would go wait on
their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es. <hi>Leonora</hi> was not gone into <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> as he <U+017F>aid; 'twas a thing he
had devi<U+017F>ed, to be in more quiet with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> <U+017F>he was gone but to <hi>Brie</hi> to <U+017F>ee a <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter
of hers called <hi>Florida,</hi> married to <hi>Orontes</hi> a Gentleman of that Country. He had a
mind to go thither, and to take the Shepherd along with him, being re<U+017F>olved to take
up lodgings in a little Town neer <hi>Oronte's</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle, becau<U+017F>e he would not trouble him.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43725:50"/>
Now he had power enough over the <U+017F>pirit of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> to make him believe that <hi>Brie</hi>
was <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts.</hi> In five or <U+017F>ix days all the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s he had at <hi>Paris</hi> was di<U+017F>patch'd, <U+017F>o
that he was at liberty to pur<U+017F>ue his Loves, and make <U+017F>port with his <hi>extravagant
Shepherd.</hi> They went together to <U+017F>ee <hi>Adrian,</hi> and to take leave of him. He was very
glad to <U+017F>ee his Cou<U+017F>in in his ordinary cloaths again; and conceiving his brain bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>etled, he thru<U+017F>t into his hands <U+017F>ome Peeces towards the expences of his
journey. The next day, as <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> was upon his departure, there fell out a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s

            <p>THe<U+017F>e tedious expectations were <U+017F>uch an affliction to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that he
thought his life would not have done him the favour to let him

            <p>After that the <hi>Shepherd</hi> had thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed as to that point, he re<U+017F>olved to take
his cloak and walk a little abroad into the City. At the fir<U+017F>t corner of a <U+017F>treet he
met, there was a man looking on a Paper <U+017F>tuck up by the Stage-players: he al<U+017F>o
would needs read it, and having <U+017F>een that they promi<U+017F>ed to repre<U+017F>ent an <hi>Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Pa<U+017F>toral,</hi> one of the newe<U+017F>t pieces of their Author, and withal a Ma<U+017F>quarade,
he immediately returned to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> to per<U+017F>wade him to go <U+017F>ee the Play. As good
fortune would have it, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had no bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s that afternoon, he therefore was
willing to <U+017F>ee whether the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Players did as well as their Maje<U+017F>ties,
<U+017F>o that he bid the Coach-man make ready the Coach to go thither. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing his
re<U+017F>olution, went pre<U+017F>ently to his Chamber, and put on his Shepherds habit, which
done, he came and pre<U+017F>ented him<U+017F>elf to his dear friend. You <U+017F>hal not go along with me
in tho<U+017F>e cloathes, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> to him, all the world will laugh at us. And I'll laugh
at all the world, replyed <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> When a man is to go to <U+017F>ome place of Ceremony,
mu<U+017F>t he not ob<U+017F>erve the <hi>decorum</hi> as to cloathes? For this time permit me to dre<U+017F>s
my <U+017F>elf according to my fancy. The Shepherds are going to repre<U+017F>ent their Loves;
I go to <U+017F>ee them as a Judge, and yet you will not have me clad like them, I who
am of their Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion: there is no re<U+017F>pect <U+017F>hall prevail the lea<U+017F>t with me in this
ca<U+017F>e. Do you think a Judge would look hand<U+017F>omly in his <U+017F>eat with a <U+017F>hort cloak,
while all the Councellors plead before him in their long Robes? <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> knew not
how to an<U+017F>wer this; and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>o wilfully re<U+017F>olved, he received him into the
Coach clad like a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> only cau<U+017F>ing his <hi>Scrip</hi> to be taken away, and hindring
him to take his <hi>Sheephook</hi> with him, which had been a thing over-ridiculous. As for
cloak, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would have none: and yet tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>aw him in the <U+017F>treet, di<U+017F>covered
not his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, but thought him <U+017F>ome fanta<U+017F>tick Gentleman, who loved to be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
clad.</p>
            <p>When they came to <hi>Burgundy-hou<U+017F>e, An<U+017F>elme</hi> meeting there with three or four
Noblemen, his friends, placed him<U+017F>elf with them in the Kings Box, having the
Shepherd always at his Elbow. The Players having begun their Pa<U+017F>toral, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was
extreamly attentive; and <U+017F>eeing a very hand<U+017F>ome Shepherde<U+017F>s come on the Stage,
She is accompli<U+017F>h'dly hand<U+017F>om, <U+017F>ays he, but <hi>Charite</hi> goes beyond her.</p>
            <p>As <U+017F>he was <U+017F>peaking all alone in a thicket, there came a <hi>Satyre</hi> that would ravi<U+017F>h
her, but pre<U+017F>ently there hapned a Shepherd to <U+017F>tart out, that re<U+017F>cued her out of his
hands, and began to fight with him. 'Twas no <U+017F>mall bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> only to look
on; one while he turn'd to the one <U+017F>ide, another while to the other, as he wi<U+017F>h'd
the Shepherd <U+017F>hould do. And as men at Bowls, think the Bowl will go one <U+017F>ide
or other according to their <U+017F>everal po<U+017F>tures; <U+017F>o did he bend him<U+017F>elf divers ways,
and <U+017F>ometimes pull'd at one of the pillars as much as he could, as if by that means
he could make the <hi>Satyre</hi> be overcome by the <hi>Shepherd.</hi> At la<U+017F>t the <hi>Forre<U+017F>t-god</hi> was
overcome, and was led away chain'd by certain Hunt<U+017F>men who happen'd to pa<U+017F>s
by, <U+017F>o that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was very joyful, and <U+017F>aid that the Bea<U+017F>t did well to deliver him<U+017F>elf
up, and that if he had re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted any longer, he would have gone and helpt to beat
him, becau<U+017F>e he believ'd it was the very <U+017F>ame that would have done <U+017F>uch an affront
to <hi>Charite,</hi> as was done to that Shepherde<U+017F>s, and that he knew it again well enough.
This Act being done, the father of the <U+017F>ame Shepherde<U+017F>s came and <U+017F>aid, that there
was fallen into his hands a Love-Letter, that a <U+017F>ervant of his daughters had writ to
her, but that he would not have love him, and that he went to de<U+017F>ire a friend
of his to counterfeit the Characters of that Letter, and to write another, wherein
there <U+017F>hould be nothing but abu<U+017F>es, Thereupon he <U+017F>poke to that mi<U+017F>chievous Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,
and the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s effected, that Letter mu<U+017F>t come to the hands of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s.
When it was delivered to her, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> cryed out, he would never <U+017F>uffer
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43725:52"/>
<U+017F>uch a cheat, whereof he <U+017F>hould become a complice, if he did not di<U+017F>cover it. Will
you take the Play for a truth? <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> to him: Do you not <U+017F>ee it is but the
Fable of a Fable? <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> regarded not this, but went out of the Box to look for
<U+017F>ome place whence he might get upon the Stage. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> would have gone after
him, to keep him in, that he might not betray his madne<U+017F>s to all the world; but he
was hindred him<U+017F>elf by tho<U+017F>e that were with him, who de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee what <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
would do, who<U+017F>e extravagancy they had already ob<U+017F>erved. He was by that time
gotten into the Tyring Hou<U+017F>e, when the Shepherde<U+017F>s enter'd the Scene to make her
complaints upon the pretended infidelity of her <U+017F>ervant; <U+017F>o that he thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him to make ha<U+017F>te to <U+017F>peak to her, and taking a Sheephook he lighted on by
chance, he enter'd the Stage, without being perceiv'd by the Actors. He <U+017F>tood
<U+017F>till a good while in a hand<U+017F>ome po<U+017F>ture, hearing what the poor amorous Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s
<U+017F>aid; for he knew not at which end to begin his <U+017F>peech. Perceiving <U+017F>he
<U+017F>poke all in Ver<U+017F>e, he imagin'd <U+017F>he was not to be entertain'd in Pro<U+017F>e, and that <U+017F>he
under<U+017F>tood not haply the Language: in fine, he thought him<U+017F>elf able enough to
make a Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e in Rhime, as indeed he <U+017F>pake very good words, but <U+017F>hortning <U+017F>ome
and lenthening others, <U+017F>o to give them the form of Ver<U+017F>es, and pronounc'd them
with an harmonious Accent.

The <hi>Actre<U+017F><U+017F>e</hi> was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpris'd to hear this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and to <U+017F>ee the Author of it, that
<U+017F>he could not think on what <U+017F>he was to <U+017F>ay next; for indeed <U+017F>he had not been long
in the Quality. Being a<U+017F>ham'd to <U+017F>tay there and <U+017F>ay nothing, <U+017F>he went off the
Stage, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> follow'd her. The people <U+017F>eeing this, began to hi<U+017F>s at the Players;
and every one thinking that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was one of the company, they cry aloud, that
what he did was nothing worth. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and all tho<U+017F>e with him could not hold
them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>o heartily did they laugh at the admirable adventure, and being curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to know what <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was then doing, they went to him. They found the Players
quarrelling with him, for having interrupted their Play; and haply they would have
beaten him in the end, if they had not been appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to tell them, but that out of charity he would have undeceiv'd the Shepherde<U+017F>s,
which made them believe that he was come thither to abu<U+017F>e them. But the re<U+017F>pect
they bore the per<U+017F>ons that interceded for him, oblig'd them to <U+017F>ilence: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in their Pa<U+017F>toral, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>tanding at one corner of the Stage, the re<U+017F>t
returned into the Box. He was di<U+017F>pos'd into a place where he was not <U+017F>een of the
people; but towards the latter end, <U+017F>eeing a Shepherd brought before an Idol, where
they feign'd to <U+017F>acrifice him, he <U+017F>tarted out of his lurking hole, and believing that
all was real, went and <U+017F>aid,

            <p>The Mummery at the end of the Play was plea<U+017F>ant enough, yet he lik'd it not,

approving it, bid the Coach-man drive into St. <hi>James Street,</hi> among the Stationers.
They drove along our <hi>Ladies Bridge,</hi> where <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having ob<U+017F>erved a Painters <U+017F>hop,
cry'd out, Hold, hold Coachman, we have <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s here. The Coach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>taid: See you, <U+017F>ays he to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> the Painters of <hi>Paris</hi> have already heard
of me; look, they have painted me in my Shepherds habit, and that with my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds

            </p>
            <p>They went pre<U+017F>ently out of the Coach, to view it nearer, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the <U+017F>hop, ask'd for the Ma<U+017F>ter. When he was come, Sir, <U+017F>ays he to him, I
am very much oblig'd to you, that you have taken the pains to draw my picture:
but I finde here <U+017F>ome faults, I pray correct them. You have made the knots of my
<U+017F>hoe-<U+017F>trings <hi>blue,</hi> and they <U+017F>hould have been <hi>red;</hi> and here you have made me with a
<U+017F>et Ruff, whereas when I was at St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> I wore nothing but a plain band. Do
you think that Shepherds have the lea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>et Ruffs; and if they had, to what
purpo<U+017F>e were it in the fields, where the rain would <U+017F>poil them, and the <U+017F>torms rent
them? I prote<U+017F>t to you, I'll never wear any. Be<U+017F>ides, I finde you have be<U+017F>tow'd
too much Vermilion on my face, and tis nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in the complexion of a <hi>Lover,</hi>
the <hi>Ro<U+017F>e</hi> give place to the <hi>Lilly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Painter was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpris'd with this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that he was <U+017F>omewhat in doubt
they were come to jeer him; for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had not then on his white cloathes; but
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> taking him a<U+017F>ide, in a <U+017F>erious manner <U+017F>poke thus to him, The Gentleman
hath <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to imagine that your intention was to draw his picture; for be<U+017F>ides
that, that countenance <U+017F>omewhat re<U+017F>embles his, he hath worn <U+017F>uch cloathes, as
having been a long time of the company of Players, among whom he acted the
Shepherd. Ob<U+017F>erve him well now, take him for the pre<U+017F>ent in dry colours, and
henceforth put his face to all the <U+017F>hepherds you repre<U+017F>ent. They will <U+017F>ell extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for he is well known. Whereupon <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> turning to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> bid him have a
quarter of an hours patience, that he might be drawn more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the life. He was
very willing, and the Painter conceiving he might get <U+017F>omewhat by it, drew him the
be<U+017F>t he could. Other Painters have <U+017F>ince taken by that original, <U+017F>o that you hardly
<U+017F>ee any thing be<U+017F>ides their Shepherds, either at their hou<U+017F>es or their <U+017F>hops in St.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43725:53"/>
               <hi>Germains Fair.</hi> When the Painter had made an end, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> told him, he had done
but half his work, and that he mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o draw the picture of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, but he
would give him that which <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had drawn, for to make another in her full
length by it. He had in his pocket that little Copper piece, which he <U+017F>hew'd the
Painter, telling him that he mu<U+017F>t graft that head upon a body cloath'd like a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s.
Sir, I do not apprehend any thing here, <U+017F>ays the Painter, 'tis <U+017F>ome Ridle
or Embleme, if I <U+017F>hould put it upon a body, people would take it for a Mon<U+017F>ter,
'tis not fit for any thing unle<U+017F>s it were to repre<U+017F>ent Anticks in the border of a peice of
Tapi<U+017F>try. How, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> do you not <U+017F>ee it is a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> picture, full of
<hi>Scientifical Erudition?</hi> In what manner el<U+017F>e do you imagine my Shepherde<U+017F>s can
be painted? You may do as you plea<U+017F>e, but you will never do it more fortunately,
then the Courteous <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> here; and in<U+017F>tead of painting my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, you will
paint your own ignorance. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> <U+017F>eeing he began to be angry, got him into
the Coach again, and having taken leave of the Painter, bid him paint according
to his fancy the Shepherde<U+017F>s, that he <U+017F>hould place near <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> as he doth to his hour,
<U+017F>o that we never yet have had any true Picture of <hi>Charite.</hi> Thence <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> went to St. <hi>James-<U+017F>treet,</hi> to a Stationers that printed a world of <hi>Romances.
Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would <U+017F>ee none but the newe<U+017F>t, as for the old, he needed them not, for he
had them all by heart. As they were bargaining for <U+017F>ome of them, in comes <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor,</hi>
who having pa<U+017F>s'd his Complements, acquaints them that <hi>Geneura</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> in the mid<U+017F>t of his Congratulations takes him a<U+017F>ide, and tells him
of his de<U+017F>ign to go to <hi>Bry</hi> to <U+017F>ee <hi>Angelica,</hi> and his intention to take <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> with him,
making him believe it was the <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi> Country. I am heartily glad of it <U+017F>ays <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor;</hi>
do not you know that the hou<U+017F>e I have bought is but a League from <hi>Orontes</hi>'s?
you <U+017F>hall not think of any other Quarters then my hou<U+017F>e. We'll be as merry as
the Maids. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> accepting his courte<U+017F>ie, went to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and told him, that this
Gentleman had a hou<U+017F>e in <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> and that he would bear them company thither,
<U+017F>o that a many <U+017F>alutations pa<U+017F>s'd between them. They ask'd him, what he, who
had a <U+017F>oul perfectly martial, come to do in the <hi>Latine</hi> Country: he an<U+017F>wered, An
intimate friend of his had <U+017F>ent him a little book for to be printed, and that he had
given it the Stationer, to <U+017F>ee if it were worth it. The Stationer told him, he had
not had <U+017F>o much lea<U+017F>ure as to peru<U+017F>e it, and taking <U+017F>even or eight <U+017F>heets of Paper
written out of his Drawer, delivered them to him. This is what I <U+017F>poke to you
of, <U+017F>ays <hi>Montenor</hi> to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> I wi<U+017F>h you had the patience to hear a peice of it;
you'll finde it the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant and ingenious thing in the world. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> told him
he was ready to hear what ever <U+017F>hould be read. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> al<U+017F>o being entreated not to
di<U+017F><U+017F>emble his opinion, <U+017F>aid, he would do the like, and that all came very opportunely,
and was conformable to the adventures of all <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and all <hi>Heroes</hi> in <hi>Romances,</hi>
who never go to any place, but they are entertain'd with <U+017F>ome Hi<U+017F>tory: So that

a Mornings Draught of plea<U+017F>ant Dew, which gave occa<U+017F>ion
to tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>aw it to imagine, that the Gods were rin<U+017F>ing their

hands at her upri<U+017F>ing, or that <U+017F>he emptied her Chamber-pot: But though it might
have hapned to be any of all the<U+017F>e, according to the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons, as men know well by
the different Dews which fall from heaven, yet was it not either of all tho<U+017F>e things,
fell out then; for indeed it was nought el<U+017F>e, but that the hor<U+017F>es which draw the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot

out of the <U+017F>ea. The Sun being oblig'd to follow her, had by this time put off
his Night-cap, and having put on his Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ock of fine gold, had incircled his head
with beams. The minutes, who are his pages, help'd to make him ready, while
the hours having dre<U+017F>s'd his hor<U+017F>es, and given them their Oates, were putting them
into the Chariot. It was ea<U+017F>ie for <hi>men</hi> hence to judge it would not be long ere he

                        </p>
                        <p>He communicated his de<U+017F>ign to <hi>Juno,</hi> who was then a-bed with him, but <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his re<U+017F>olution, <U+017F>he told him <U+017F>he had not Napkins enough to entertain <U+017F>uch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

the Childe of Obedience, pre<U+017F>ently put on his <hi>Flying-<U+017F>hoes,</hi> and his <hi>Wing'd-hat,</hi> and

certain other Gods, with <hi>Saturn</hi> in his own Palace, he di<U+017F>charg'd him<U+017F>elf of his Duty

without giving him any occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>tay. This God promis'd him he would drive

if he took fre<U+017F>h hor<U+017F>es at every <hi>Sign,</hi> for to be at the place appointed <U+017F>oon enough.
<hi>Mercury</hi> having left him, comes down on earth, becau<U+017F>e neither <hi>Mars,</hi> nor <hi>Venus,</hi>
nor the <hi>Moon,</hi> were yet po<U+017F><U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of their <U+017F>everal Heavens. He went in the fir<U+017F>t

become <U+017F>o great, that there was need of an infinite number to puni<U+017F>h them all. He
de<U+017F>ired him to leave his work for a while, telling him that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was to make a
<hi>Banquet,</hi> to which he was come to invite him, and that he had the <U+017F>ame Me<U+017F><U+017F>age to

him go into his Wives Chamber, while <U+017F>he was yet a-bed; but that as for his Son,
he might freely go to him. Whereupon <hi>Mercury</hi> went out of the <hi>Forge,</hi> into a

no other end then to get water and a<U+017F>hes enough to drive a Buck. The Amba<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the King of the Gods laughing in him<U+017F>elf at his excellent invention, told
him the occa<U+017F>ion of his vi<U+017F>it, and de<U+017F>ired him to acquaint his mother with it. This
pa<U+017F>s'd, he took leave of him, as al<U+017F>o of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> cur<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch a jealous Cockscomb,

but <U+017F>eeing he had not medled with any thing, he di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed him peaceably.
<hi>Mercury</hi> having occa<U+017F>ion to cro<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ea, gave notice to <hi>Neptune,</hi> and all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime

thence he went to <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and did the like: That done, in one continued flight, he
got into <hi>Thrace,</hi> and having found <hi>Mars</hi> <U+017F>urbi<U+017F>hing his Armor under a Tent, he
invited him to the banquet with the <U+017F>ame Ceremony as the re<U+017F>t. Having by this

that part of his Amba<U+017F><U+017F>age, which was to the Deities of Hell. He de<U+017F>cends
into tho<U+017F>e Profundities, and in his way meeting certain Shades, who only <U+017F>taid for
his company, to pa<U+017F>s the <hi>Acheron,</hi> he drove them before him with his rod, as a
Shepherd drives his <U+017F>heep. Though he might have ea<U+017F>ily flown over the River, yet
he went into the Ferriboat for the entertainment <U+017F>ake of the Ferriman, whom he
had ever profe<U+017F>s'd a Friend<U+017F>hip to, there being <U+017F>ome relation between their <U+017F>everal

propo<U+017F>ed to him the building of a Bridg over this River, and hath endeavoured to
make it appear to him it were more commodious then my Boat, becau<U+017F>e then the

proud <U+017F>pirits of <hi>Princes, Captains,</hi> and rich <hi>Patentees,</hi> which would enter Hell, <U+017F>ome
in <hi>Sedans,</hi> <U+017F>ome on <hi>hor<U+017F>e-back,</hi> and <U+017F>ome in Coaches; all which might be ea<U+017F>ily

that they mu<U+017F>t needs re<U+017F>ide in good hou<U+017F>es, he went to a certain Kings palace; and
having put on the form of a Page, he ask'd the fir<U+017F>t Courtier he met, whether he
knew not where <hi>Vertue</hi> was? He <U+017F>hew'd him up a narrow pair of <U+017F>tairs, telling him
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43725:55"/>
he <U+017F>hould find her there. <hi>Mercury</hi> went up to the very top, and thence into divers
chambers, where he finds a <U+017F>ort of people diver<U+017F>ly imploy'd. Some were at Dice,
and at every ca<U+017F>t, ca<U+017F>t out bla<U+017F>phemies, as if their imprecations had been words of
conjuration to make them win. There were others di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of certain publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
wherein yet they regarded nothing but their private intere<U+017F>ts. And there were
a many others who<U+017F>e imployment was to <U+017F>ing, dance, drink, and court: Yet there
wanted not to be in the place <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Orators,</hi> who maintained all their actions
<hi>vertuous.</hi> But <hi>Mercury</hi> was not deceiv'd in them; and he di<U+017F>covered well enough
at the end of a Gallery, <hi>Fraud, Flattery,</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> debating the fortune of a
Favourite. Having asked them where Vertue was, the<U+017F>e lewd Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es laugh'd,
and told him they had no acquaintance with her, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly,
that <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood not <U+017F>o much as to ob<U+017F>erve civility and corre<U+017F>pondence
with the world; and that he <U+017F>hould never find her but among ru<U+017F>tick and <U+017F>imple
people. He pre<U+017F>ently vani<U+017F>ht away; and having fled into a very <U+017F>avage place, he
enters a little cottage, where a poor Country-fellow lay a dying. Having asked him
<U+017F>ome tidings of her whom he look'd for, the poor <U+017F>ick man told him, that while he
lived his endeavour had been ever to have her in his company; and that <U+017F>he had
ju<U+017F>t left him, having commended him to his good <hi>Genius</hi> to conduct him to the
<hi>Ely<U+017F>ian fields:</hi> but that he believed not his children had retain'd her, though it had
been always his de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have been entertained by them. <hi>Mercury</hi> being
<U+017F>omewhat troubled at this, bethought him it was mo<U+017F>t likely <hi>Vertue</hi> was among tho<U+017F>e
who taught her precepts to others: And <U+017F>o he went into an Univer<U+017F>ity among the
<hi>Philo<U+017F>ophers;</hi> but there he found nothing but <hi>Vociferation, Pride, Doubt,</hi> and <hi>Vanity.</hi>
He walkt all up and down, and at length entring into the <hi>Library,</hi> he perceives the
Godde<U+017F>s he look'd for <U+017F>eated among the Books. Having ask'd her what <U+017F>he did
there, <U+017F>he told him <U+017F>he had no other abode; and that though many came thither
to <U+017F>eek her, yet they never carried her away with them when they had found her.
<hi>Mercury</hi> told her that he came to invite her to <U+017F>upper in the Palace of <hi>Olympus,</hi>
whereat <U+017F>he was very joyfull, for <U+017F>he had long <U+017F>ince wi<U+017F>h'd to quit the earth as well
as <hi>Ju<U+017F>tice.</hi> He thereupon ask'd her where he might find the other Deities he
look'd for, and whether <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> ever came into her company? No, <U+017F>ayes
<U+017F>he, go <U+017F>eek tho<U+017F>e that drink lu<U+017F>tily, and tho<U+017F>e that are great Game<U+017F>ters, or
that are exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively expen<U+017F>ive, there you have them. As for <hi>Peace,</hi> <U+017F>he is only
among tho<U+017F>e that have nothing, and <hi>Victory</hi> among tho<U+017F>e that can be<U+017F>t deceive.
<hi>Mercury</hi> having had this intelligence, went pre<U+017F>ently to <U+017F>eek for tho<U+017F>e Deities, who
all promis'd him to come to the Banquet; except <hi>Fame,</hi> who excus'd her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That it was not for her that <hi>Ambro<U+017F>ia</hi> was made, and that <U+017F>he fed on nothing
but Wind. <hi>Mercury</hi> ob<U+017F>erving <U+017F>he had a hundred Mouths, bethought him it was
well done of her not to come to <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Palace, <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t have brought
<hi>Famine</hi> along with her, and that <hi>Juno</hi> would not have bidden her very welcome,
taking her rather for a Mon<U+017F>ter then a Godde<U+017F>s. After that, the Amba<U+017F><U+017F>ador
found <hi>Aurora</hi> in a Wood, where <U+017F>he <U+017F>ought a <hi>Hunt<U+017F>man,</hi> whom <U+017F>he was in love
with: Having done his Me<U+017F><U+017F>age to her, he returned to the palace of Mount
<hi>Olympus,</hi> to <U+017F>ee what they did there. As for the Gods which were <hi>fellow-Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
at his Fathers table, he invited them not, the Ceremony as to them was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s.
He found them all employed in the preparations of the <hi>Banquet;</hi> and divers
others who were oblig'd to <U+017F>ome attendance to their great King, were already
come. <hi>Vulcan</hi> who is accu<U+017F>tomed to be near the Fire, had the charge of head-Cook,
and was a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by the <hi>Cyclopes,</hi> whom he had brought with him. He was a

coming down over his ears. The fir<U+017F>t Me<U+017F>s they prepar'd was <hi>Ambro<U+017F>ia,</hi> which
they di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed infinite ways, becau<U+017F>e that food which was very common among the
Gods, was not of any delicacy, when dre<U+017F>s'd after the u<U+017F>ual manner. <hi>Vulcan</hi> made
<U+017F>ome into Broth, <U+017F>tew'd <U+017F>ome, fry'd <U+017F>ome, and <U+017F>ome he dre<U+017F>s'd hotch-potch wi<U+017F>e,
and <U+017F>ome he di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed like Oat-Cakes. But all that being no great matter, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ented
to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that <U+017F>eeing he was re<U+017F>olved to make a <U+017F>olemn BANQUET,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43725:55"/>
there mu<U+017F>t be other meats. <hi>Jupiter</hi> having given him commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to take what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he pleas'd, he caus'd <hi>Plato</hi> to be call'd, and <U+017F>ome other <hi>Philo<U+017F>ophers,</hi> whom
he had purpo<U+017F>ely <U+017F>ent for out of the <hi>Elizian Fields.</hi> He commanded them to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t
him, and to make appear they were not altogether unprofitable in the world, as
they had been often reproach'd; <hi>Plato</hi> was charg'd to make ready his <hi>Ideas,</hi> which
mu<U+017F>t needs be very delicate food for Divine Palates; and another Philo<U+017F>opher,
who<U+017F>e Tenent had ever been, that <hi><U+017F>ouls</hi> were <hi>Corporeal,</hi> received order to take the

of the Gods, and they are obliged to <hi>Vulcan</hi> who<U+017F>e invention was the cau<U+017F>e
they were not lo<U+017F>t. Yet <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who was only task'd with making the Sauces,
came all in a fume to <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and told him, in maintenance of his own Doctrine,
that he was to blame, and that tho<U+017F>e poor <U+017F>ouls which he caus'd to be ma<U+017F><U+017F>acred,
had <U+017F>ometimes lodg'd in humane bodies, and that they ought to return thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and that the Gods de<U+017F>ired not to make their food of the <U+017F>ouls of men. But it
was to much purpo<U+017F>e that he cryed out, the other Philo<U+017F>ophers ru<U+017F>h'd into the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
telling him, that though they were the <U+017F>ouls of men which they made ready,
yet they <U+017F>hould think them<U+017F>elves very happy to become the nouri<U+017F>hment of the
bodies of the Gods, and to be made a part thereof. Notwith<U+017F>tanding all this, when he
<U+017F>aw the neck of <U+017F>ome Pullet <U+017F>truck off, he cryed out as loud as if his own throat
had been Cut. Be<U+017F>ides, he did nothing but di<U+017F>turb the Cocks, being de<U+017F>irous to beat
his <hi>Numbers</hi> into their heads. He taught them, that there ought to be ten peeces in
every fryed Me<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>o it might not be without harmony, and that it might have
all its conveniences and proportions; and if they dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed any <hi>Ambro<U+017F>ia,</hi> he in<U+017F>truct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e it into three Me<U+017F><U+017F>es, affirming that that number was the mea<U+017F>ure
of all things, and that the Gods delighted in an uneaven number. <hi>Vulcan,</hi> who
under<U+017F>tood nothing of all this Philo<U+017F>ophy, took the Ladle out of one of the Kettles,
and <U+017F>triking him therewith with as much fury and good will as if it had been a dog
that had eaten a <U+017F>houlder of Mutton, bid him not interrupt him any further, and go
and make u<U+017F>e of his Arithmetick in the Hall, to <U+017F>ee if there were that number of
Trenchers and Chairs that <U+017F>hould be. That which had angred this Ma<U+017F>ter-cook the
more was, that in making towards him, he had with his crooked Leg overturn'd
a Me<U+017F>s of <hi>Ambro<U+017F>ia,</hi> which had been put on the hearth to be kept warm; <U+017F>o that he
repented him he had not made Minc'd-meat of that Philo<U+017F>opher, as he had done
of the <U+017F>ouls of Bea<U+017F>ts. When his anger was pa<U+017F>t, con<U+017F>idering, that all that was
prepared was not too much for <U+017F>o great an A<U+017F><U+017F>embly of Gods, he found the means
to dre<U+017F>s them another mo<U+017F>t excellent Service, but he mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t propo<U+017F>e it to <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
without who<U+017F>e permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion nothing could be done. He went therefore and told him,
that among the Cele<U+017F>tial bodies there were many living creatures, which did not
any good there; and that there would never fall out a better opportunity to eat
them then now. <hi>Jupiter</hi> would not con<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>o that <hi>Vulcan</hi> was fain to <U+017F>peak to
him to this effect; May it plea<U+017F>e your Maje<U+017F>ty, It is a long time <U+017F>ince you have
made any Entertainments, and they <U+017F>ay, no fea<U+017F>t like that of a Mi<U+017F>ers: It is to no
credit to be at the expence of a <U+017F>mall matter. <hi>Mortalls</hi> will not bear you that
reverence they do, if they come to know you keep not better chear then they:
Do you not ob<U+017F>erve how they kill the Bea<U+017F>ts they have on <hi>earth,</hi> for their nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
why will not you do the like by tho<U+017F>e you have in <hi>Heaven?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jupiter</hi> overcome by the rea<U+017F>ons of his Son, bid him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>end his <hi>Cyclopes,</hi> to take
down all the Signs that were good Provi<U+017F>ion. The bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was as <U+017F>oon done as
<U+017F>poken; <U+017F>o <hi>Brontus, Pyragmon</hi> and <U+017F>ome others of the Scullions brought away the
<hi>Hare,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> the <hi>Whale,</hi> the <hi>Ram,</hi> the <hi>Bull,</hi> the <hi>Crab,</hi> and the
<hi>Fi<U+017F>hes,</hi> all which they made ready in divers manners: Nay, they did not <U+017F>pare
the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Bear,</hi> the <hi>Hydra,</hi> nor the <hi>Wolf,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other Bea<U+017F>ts, who<U+017F>e
fle<U+017F>h was thought <U+017F>omewhat hard and indige<U+017F>tible: For <hi>Vulcan</hi> affirm'd they were
already half bak'd, becau<U+017F>e they had been <U+017F>o long fa<U+017F>tned to <U+017F>tars.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the meat was thus in making ready, <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Iris</hi> made it their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43725:56"/>
work to accommodate all within the Palace. It was built of <hi>Petrifi'd</hi> Clou'ds, and
the walls were enamell'd with <U+017F>uch a diver<U+017F>ity of colours, that they defi'd all Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi<U+017F>try.
There wanted nothing but the <U+017F>weeping of the floor, wherein tho<U+017F>e God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es
were <U+017F>omewhat at a lo<U+017F>s for a broom. In this trouble comes in <hi>Aeolus,</hi> with
a great bunch of Keys at his Girdle. He had lock'd up all the <hi>winds</hi> within their
Caves, except the <hi>Zephir,</hi> which as his Minion, went always with him, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up his train. He perceiving the trouble of the Queen of the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es, <U+017F>well'd
up his Cheeks, and blew <U+017F>o about the Hall, that he ea<U+017F>ily drove out all the du<U+017F>t
before him. His Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <hi>Flora,</hi> who could not for<U+017F>ake him, came pre<U+017F>ently after,
with divers other Nymphs, who <U+017F>trew'd Flowers all about. <hi>Hercules, Mercury,
Ca<U+017F>tor, Pollux,</hi> and other of the hou<U+017F>hold <U+017F>et the Tables right, laid the Cloathes,
and plac'd the chairs. The<U+017F>e moveables were made of the <hi>Trees,</hi> into which men
had been of old <hi>Metamorphos'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> having put on their be<U+017F>t cloathes, came in to entertain the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and pre<U+017F>ently after entered <hi>Ceres,</hi> who caus'd to be brought in as good bread
as ever was bak'd; and after that <hi>Bacchus,</hi> with <hi>Pan</hi> and the <hi>Satyres,</hi> who were
loaden with bottles, which they di<U+017F>charg'd them<U+017F>elves of near the <U+017F>ide Table. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus</hi>
who follow'd them was the Butler, and was already <U+017F>o drunk, that it was not
thought he could have drunk any more; he <U+017F>tumbled <U+017F>o oft, as if his legs had been
made of Tough, <U+017F>o that they gave him a chair, which came in good time for him
to repo<U+017F>e his panch in, which was <U+017F>wollen like the Sail of a <U+017F>hip in a good wind.
While <hi>Ceres, Bacchus,</hi> and all the Gods of the Fields were in their Complements,
<hi>Pluto</hi> came in with his wife, who <U+017F>ince her going to <hi>Hell,</hi> was become <U+017F>o fotti<U+017F>h,
that <U+017F>he had forgotten all manner of Civility and Complement. She made a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezy
to the Company, and with a ru<U+017F>tick <U+017F>implicity came and <U+017F>aid to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> We

were <U+017F>ad enough at home; when we were gotten into our Chariot for to come out of
hell, our <hi>Dog</hi> came and leapt upon me, and did <U+017F>o lick and ki<U+017F>s my cheeks with all his
three tongues, that I could hardly part with him. I thought once to have brought
him with me, he had at lea<U+017F>t done you <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice in turning the <U+017F>pit; and then
you will not believe what a pretty Cur it is, he dances on his hind feet, and fetches
any thing you ca<U+017F>t to him. You have done better to have left him behind you,
Daughter, <U+017F>ays <hi>Jupiter,</hi> for be<U+017F>ides that, it is not a Dog to be carried in ones <U+017F>leeve,
we have others here whom he might have bitten with his <U+017F>ix ranks of Jaws. Do you
not know-well, that we have here a <hi>Dog</hi> among the <hi>Stars?</hi> Tis he that picks the bones
of the Cele<U+017F>tial Fowl, which is <U+017F>ometimes eaten at our Table, and as for yours, he
<U+017F>hould only pick the bones of dead men? But how comes it you have not brought
my <U+017F>on <hi>Minos</hi> along? If we <U+017F>hould have brought him, replyes <hi>Pluto,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>uming
the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the two other <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>De<U+017F>tinies,</hi> the <hi>Furies</hi> and <hi>Charon</hi>
would have come too, and in the mean time you know they cannot quit their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
for one moment, without a de<U+017F>ign of de<U+017F>troying all mankinde.</p>
                        <p>As <hi>Pluto</hi> ended his Remon<U+017F>trance, the arrival of <hi>Mars</hi> dazzl'd the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly
with the glittering of his Armour. His Mu<U+017F>tachoes were turn'd like the Gard of
a Poignard, that <U+017F>o it might <U+017F>eem his very face was armed, and his eyes were fiery,
as tho<U+017F>e of a Lyon in a fury. Yet was there nothing but what was honorable in his
Salutations to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the re<U+017F>t; and <hi>Venus</hi> entring thereupon into the Hall<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> he
who <U+017F>poke nothing but of vanqui<U+017F>hing others, confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf overcome. She
was attended by her <hi>Son</hi> and the three <hi>Graces,</hi> who had <U+017F>pent the whole day in
dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her. After her came in <hi>Pallas,</hi> who in the mid<U+017F>t of her gravity had <U+017F>ome
features, that rendred her <hi>Amiable:</hi> And then came the <hi>Moon,</hi> and her <hi>Brother</hi> the
<hi>Sun,</hi> who having retain'd <U+017F>ome of his beams about his head, <U+017F>ufficiently enlightned
the place. He was <U+017F>o Complemental, that he would <U+017F>alute the Ladies one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but as his mouth was near that of <hi>Juno's,</hi> to ki<U+017F>s her fir<U+017F>t: <U+017F>he <U+017F>tarts back pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently,
feeling the heat of his mu<U+017F>tacho's, which began to burn her cheek. <hi>Jupiter</hi>
perceiving it, told him he was to blame, that he had not bath'd his chin in cold
water, when he laid a<U+017F>ide his fires. You do not con<U+017F>ider, that I was in <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te to

where my fair Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s <hi>Amphitrite</hi> ever prepares me a bathe. She entertains me there
at mine Ho<U+017F>t's Table, I am afraid <U+017F>he'll make me pay for to day, though I <U+017F>up not
with her.</p>
                        <p>While he <U+017F>aid this, <hi>Neptune, Amphitrite, Palemon,</hi> and many other Sea-Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
arriv'd, who told him that he was not <U+017F>o rigorou<U+017F>ly dealt with as he would
make believe, and that he had his lodging very cheap. Their di<U+017F>pute was not heard,
becau<U+017F>e <hi>Saturn, Janus,</hi> and the other ancient Gods came in at the <U+017F>ame time, whom
they were on all <U+017F>ides bu<U+017F>ie to receive. There was only <hi>Juno,</hi> who was not well
pleas'd with their coming. When <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <hi>Janus</hi> with his two faces, <U+017F>he cryed out
to her husband, did I not tell you that you would ruine your <U+017F>elf? You counted
but one per<U+017F>on in attendance to your Father, and behold there's two. This glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<hi>Janus</hi> hath two great faces, and two huge mouthes, which can each of them
devour as much meat as four. I am re<U+017F>olved he <U+017F>hall not be entertained here; he
<U+017F>hall not be at our Table, for he will <U+017F>tarve all the re<U+017F>t. Let him go to the gate, 'tis
his ordinary charge to keep it. Alas, what do you trouble your <U+017F>elf Sweet-heart!
<U+017F>ays <hi>Jupiter:</hi> What will my Father <U+017F>ay, when he hears you will not have him bring
along with him one he makes <U+017F>o much of. Con<U+017F>ider, that though <hi>Janus</hi> hath two
mouthes, yet he hath but one belly and two hands, <U+017F>o that he can eat no more then
any of the re<U+017F>t, and his body can contain no more then what is rea<U+017F>onable. The
mouth which he hath behinde, <U+017F>erves him to no purpo<U+017F>e but to draw in the wind
which comes that away: And I mu<U+017F>t tell you be<U+017F>ides that, he may be of good u<U+017F>e
at the Table, <U+017F>eeing that out of re<U+017F>pect to <hi>Saturn</hi> he mu<U+017F>t be admitted; for now I
think on't, he mu<U+017F>t be placed towards the <U+017F>ide Table, that with his hind-eyes he may
look to the wine, which this doting <hi>Silenus</hi> will not husband <U+017F>o well, and <U+017F>o hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the<U+017F>e drunken <hi>Satyrs,</hi> who are to wait, drink it not all: As for the Office
of Porter, do not you trouble your <U+017F>elf, for I have given it the <hi>Sagittary</hi> of the
Zodiack.</p>
                        <p>While <hi>Jupiter</hi> gave his wife the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>olations, the Gods made <U+017F>port with <hi>Janus,</hi>
who to make appear to them that there was nothing to be found fault with as to
his per<U+017F>on, went and ki<U+017F>t <hi>Venus</hi> with the mouth behinde, and with his hands draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him one of the <hi>Graces,</hi> ki<U+017F>s'd her with the mouth before. There's a Wag,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Phoebus,</hi> he <U+017F>hould have two wives, he hath this advantage over us, that he can
ki<U+017F>s two at once. But you may <U+017F>ay as well, <U+017F>ays the <U+017F>ubtil <hi>Prometheus,</hi> that he may
at the <U+017F>ame time receive four boxes in the ear.</p>
                        <p>In the mid<U+017F>t of this je<U+017F>ting, <hi>Aurora,</hi> the <hi>Mu<U+017F>es,</hi> and <U+017F>ome others arrived; <U+017F>o
that there was a great noi<U+017F>e of Chariots, and neighing of Hor<U+017F>es at the Palace gate.
<hi>Jupiter</hi> <U+017F>eeing all the Gue<U+017F>ts were come, commanded the <hi>Banquet</hi> <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>erved

of the Hall; however, to ob<U+017F>erve order and decency, they fa<U+017F>tned to the
walls certain plates of gold, which in<U+017F>tead of Torches had Armes of <U+017F>ilver, and at
the hands thereof, there were <U+017F>o many <U+017F>tars nailed.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon <hi>Mercury,</hi> who was the <hi>Clark</hi> of the <hi>Kitchin</hi> enters, with the <hi>Fawns</hi>
and <hi>Satyrs,</hi> who brought up Me<U+017F><U+017F>es, which he di<U+017F>pos'd upon the Table. <hi>Jupiter,
Saturn, Pluto, Neptune, Juno, Venus,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the Company having wa<U+017F>h'd
their hands in the water of <hi>Eridan,</hi> <U+017F>ate them down without any di<U+017F>pute, every one
according to their quality. The King of the Gods, according to the cu<U+017F>tom of all
great Princes, had his <hi>Phy<U+017F>ician</hi> on the one <U+017F>ide, and his <hi>Je<U+017F>ter</hi> on the other. And
that was <hi>Ae<U+017F>culapius</hi> and <hi>Momus,</hi> the one whereof was there to over<U+017F>ee what
meats were to be eaten, and the other to carp at the actions and words of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence.
The fir<U+017F>t bout <hi>Momus</hi> had, was with his Ma<U+017F>ter, telling him, that he knew
not the rea<U+017F>on why he had not invited <hi>Di<U+017F>cord</hi> to his Banquet, no more then he had
not done at the Marriage of <hi>Thetis,</hi> and therefore he mu<U+017F>t expect <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould come

the Narration of <hi>Montenor,</hi> be it known, there is at this pre<U+017F>ent one at the
foot of the Mount of St. <hi>Geneuieu<U+017F>ue,</hi> and let not the Gods be any thing troubled, I
am as able a Iudge as <hi>Paris.</hi> All this is long <U+017F>ince pa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ays <hi>Montenor,</hi> do not think
it a thing pre<U+017F>ent. There's no que<U+017F>tion but that if you had been in the world when this
<hi>Banquet</hi> was made, <hi>Momus</hi> had remembred you: I pray do not any further di<U+017F>turb
the Gods at their meat: A Ma<U+017F>ons Boy will have his hour. <hi>Montenor</hi> having <U+017F>o
<U+017F>aid, obtain'd <U+017F>ilence, and having look'd into his Paper, went on in this manner:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iupiter</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Momus,</hi> that he had well con<U+017F>idered what he <U+017F>aid, and that he
had already taken order that their enjoyments <U+017F>hould not be interrupted. And if
he had not invited <hi>Di<U+017F>cord,</hi> nor the <hi>Furies, Famine, Envy, Sadne<U+017F>s</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi>
who<U+017F>e company is ever unplea<U+017F>ant, he would <U+017F>end them each their Me<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>o they
might not grumble.</p>
                        <p>While this pa<U+017F>t, the mo<U+017F>t part of the Gods took bread: <hi>Saturn</hi> cut it with his
<hi><U+017F>ithe, Bacchus</hi> with his <hi>pruning-hook, Mars</hi> with his <hi>cymiter,</hi> and divers of the re<U+017F>t
with <hi>Ceres</hi>'s <hi><U+017F>ickle</hi> which <U+017F>he lent them. And as for meat, <hi>Neptune</hi> took him <U+017F>ome
with his <hi>trident; Pluto</hi> with his <hi><U+017F>cepter,</hi> which is made in the fa<U+017F>hion of a <hi>fork; Venus</hi>
with the point of her Sons <hi>dart;</hi> and the daughter of <hi>Latona</hi> would needs be doing
with the point of her <hi>javelin,</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> with the top of her <hi>lance.</hi> For the Gods
are never without their Arms, no not when they are at table; becau<U+017F>e if they had
them not about them, they could not be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed one from another. As for
example, if you <U+017F>ee a picture or <U+017F>tatue of <hi>Mercury,</hi> how will you know it is he, if he
have not his <hi>Caduceur?</hi> It <U+017F>tood them upon at lea<U+017F>t to have about them the marks
of their Divinity, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> who had his <hi>thunderbolt,</hi> which his <hi>Eagle</hi> held in his
beak clo<U+017F>e by him. Yet he thought it not hand<U+017F>om to permit the Gods to cut bread
with their Arms; for <hi>Saturn</hi> in u<U+017F>ing his great Sithe had already <U+017F>aluted his Go<U+017F><U+017F>ip
<hi>Janus</hi> in the jaw-bones with the handle of it, and had drawn blood at his teeth.
<hi>Mercury</hi> was much blamed, that he had not taken order for knives and forks at the
table, <U+017F>o that he was fain to go immediately to ask for <U+017F>ome of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> who had
enough: So he came immediately back, and furni<U+017F>h'd all the company.</p>
                        <p>

the Gods, whereas time was when thy own Liver was the food of birds. Do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
my antient mi<U+017F>eries, replies <hi>Prometheus;</hi> it <U+017F>uffices that <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath pardoned
me, knowing my offence was not <U+017F>o great as he had thought: He thought, that
having formed the body of a man, I impudently came even to heaven to <U+017F>teal fire to
animate it: But I made appear to him my more mode<U+017F>t carriage; I only had the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the Burning-gla<U+017F>s, which when I expos'd to the Sun, I drew his fire to
me without <U+017F>tirring from earth. I am glad of the occa<U+017F>ion to tell thee thus much,
before <U+017F>o many other Gods who knew it not before.</p>
                        <p>It is a very commendable thing, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Saturn</hi> interpo<U+017F>ing in the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
to forget old quarrels: Should I <U+017F>uffer any thing to be <U+017F>aid of what hath
happened to <hi>Prometheus,</hi> I <U+017F>ee it would be my turn at length to be made Table-talk.
In the mean time let there no <U+017F>tories be made of my fortune; I am no other then
what I would be. It is true, time hath been I <U+017F>ate on the <U+017F>ame throne whereon <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
now <U+017F>its; but it was no longer then Innocencie dwelt among men; and now
that they are become mi<U+017F>chievous, I would not be oblig'd to govern them. While
I reign'd, they cared not for riches; and if that Age was call'd the Golden age, it
was becau<U+017F>e their <U+017F>ouls were of gold, and not their Plate. Can it be imagin'd that I
who cau<U+017F>ed others to live with <U+017F>o little ambition and avarice, am troubled at the
lo<U+017F>s of my Kingdom? and may it not ea<U+017F>ily be di<U+017F>covered that it became me to <U+017F>hake
hands with the affairs of the world, for to enjoy that tranquility which others had
enjoyed by my means?</p>
                        <p>While <hi>Saturne</hi> <U+017F>aid thus, <hi>Momus,</hi> who knew he contemn'd not the royalty but
becau<U+017F>e he could not obtain it, went and made a thou<U+017F>and wry faces behind him, and
had a great itch to an<U+017F>wer him: but he was hindred by a loud <U+017F>hout of laughter,

alas poor <hi>God!</hi> (<U+017F>ays <hi>Momus</hi> with a Scoggin-ge<U+017F>ture) I know not who hath maim'd
him in that manner; he hath neither legs nor thighs, yet had he but arms and
hands, he might go on his Ar<U+017F>s like a Wa<U+017F>h-bowl, whereas now he mu<U+017F>t be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

Laughing-<U+017F>tock of him, <U+017F>ays <hi>Iupiter,</hi> my will is, thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t go and feed him.
With all my heart, <U+017F>ays <hi>Momus;</hi> and thereupon going behinde him, he took <U+017F>ome
meat on a Trencher, and having given him a little bit, he eat up the re<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf.
<hi>Iupiter</hi> <U+017F>eeing his Knavery, bid him come away from him, <U+017F>eeing he fed him after
that rate; and bid <hi>De<U+017F>tiny,</hi> who <U+017F>ate next him, have a care of him. After that,
ob<U+017F>erving that there were divers others complained that the Me<U+017F><U+017F>es were too hot,
he commanded <hi>Zephyrus</hi> to take <U+017F>ome cour<U+017F>e therein; <U+017F>o this God getting up on
his Chair, did <U+017F>o much <U+017F>hake his wings, and blow with his mouth, that all was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
cooled.</p>
                        <p>But this was not all, for at the other end of the Table there was the God of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
who was much troubled, becau<U+017F>e he could not eat at all, and who thought
it was to no purpo<U+017F>e to have invited him to the Banquet, if he had not the power
to do as others did. Time hath been, that he was contented only with putting his
finger on his mouth, to hinder him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>peak; but of late he had found out a
more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured cour<U+017F>e, and that was by locking his two lips together with a Padlock;
yet this invention brought its inconvenience along with it, e<U+017F>pecially at this time, he
being not able by rea<U+017F>on thereof to put one bit into his mouth. He made <U+017F>igns
to tho<U+017F>e whom he conceiv'd his friends, to take compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on him; but there
every one was for him<U+017F>elf; and <hi>Fate,</hi> who kept the Key of this Padlock, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
him<U+017F>elf to bring it with him. There was no other way, but to <U+017F>eek to <hi>Vulcan</hi>
who had been the Smith, and had made it. He under<U+017F>tanding well the pain that poor
God was in, out of Charity <U+017F>ent one of his Cyclopes, who with one <U+017F>troke of his
hammer broke it a<U+017F>under; but it put the God of Silence into the danger of lo<U+017F>ing
half his teeth, for the blow light upon his Chin, and was like to have batter'd to

much pain; for it was a long time <U+017F>ince his teeth had been in any employment. The
action of his eating was <U+017F>o ill-favoured, that he made <U+017F>port to all at Table; yet
was it <U+017F>oon over, and all were quiet and well pleas'd, except <hi>Venus,</hi> who complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

This divine Je<U+017F>ter directed all the<U+017F>e encounters to <hi>Cupid,</hi> who to be reveng'd of
him began to make ready his bow: but <hi>Venus</hi> per<U+017F>waded him, that the green and

<hi>Momus</hi> by the order of <hi>Iupiter</hi> commanded the <hi>Tritons,</hi> who <U+017F>tood by all this time,
to play on their Cornets, and appointed <U+017F>ome <hi>Fawns</hi> to play on their Flutes, that
by the <U+017F>ound of their In<U+017F>truments they might not <U+017F>uffer the jaw-bones of the Gods
to be idle. He him<U+017F>elf plaid his part with them on the bells he had at his knees,
wherewith he made a <U+017F>pecial noi<U+017F>e in dancing. He had al<U+017F>o a <U+017F>tick with two Swine-bladders

                        <p>The <U+017F>econd Cour<U+017F>e was hardly on the Table, but the Gods were extreamly
amaz'd at the new <U+017F>ort of meats that was <U+017F>erved in to them. The <hi>Ideas</hi> they found
mo<U+017F>t excellent: yet <hi>Ae<U+017F>culapius</hi> <U+017F>aid to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> Let your Maje<U+017F>ty commend this
to others; this kind of meat is not cordial for you, it is too windy. <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Fate</hi>
hearing this, took all to them<U+017F>elves, and it found them no more work then a Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry
to a Swine: though the Doctor told them al<U+017F>o, that he knew well their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution,
and that tho<U+017F>e <hi>Idaeas</hi> would prove purgative to them, and that he fore<U+017F>aw

to feed of them, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him they were extreamly nutritive. Hence grew an
occa<U+017F>ion of drinking abundance of wine and nectar, for <hi>Vulcan</hi> had <U+017F>pic'd the <U+017F>auces
a little too much. <hi>Ganimede</hi> gave <hi>Iupiter</hi> to drink, <hi>Hebe</hi> to <hi>Iuno,</hi> and the <hi>Satyres</hi> to
to all the other Gods. Now the good <hi>Ianus,</hi> who had been charg'd to <U+017F>ee that the<U+017F>e
brave Cupbearers did not drink, had in the beginning well di<U+017F>charg'd him<U+017F>elf of his
duty, and had rail'd at two Satyres who had confuted a bottle; but at length his
faithfulne<U+017F>s was corrupted: They promi<U+017F>ed him, that if he would <U+017F>ay nothing, they
would give him as much as any <U+017F>ix others. So that having accepted this propo<U+017F>ition,
while one pre<U+017F>ented him a gla<U+017F>s before, another gave him one behind. In the mean
time the <hi>Satyres</hi> drank by turns at the <U+017F>ide-table, without any fear of <hi>Silenus,</hi> who
by this time was fallen a<U+017F>leep in his chair, and <U+017F>nored <U+017F>o loud that he made almo<U+017F>t as
much noi<U+017F>e as the mu<U+017F>ick. Howbeit <hi>Ianus</hi> had two faces, yet had he but one head;
<U+017F>o that the wine and nectar which he had liberally taken fumed into his brain, and
<U+017F>omwhat troubled it: And being now arrived to a lo<U+017F>s of all mode<U+017F>ty and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
he drank a health to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> de<U+017F>iring he would pledge him. <hi>Bacchus</hi> ask'd
for wine; but the Waiters being bu<U+017F>ie about <U+017F>omwhat el<U+017F>e, heard him not. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o carele<U+017F>ly attended, took his knife and knock'd <U+017F>even or eight times
on the table as hard as he could for to make them hear: which action was very ill
taken, for it <U+017F>eem'd by that he thought he was in <U+017F>ome Tavern. Yet <hi>Iupiter</hi> pa<U+017F>s'd

                        <p>As for the la<U+017F>t Cour<U+017F>e, it was very <U+017F>umptuous: For <hi>Pomona</hi> had brought of all
<U+017F>orts of fruits, and the Cooks had made bak'd devices. <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina</hi> took a great deal
of Tart and Biskets, and put into her pocket, <U+017F>aying it was for her darling <hi>Alecto.</hi>
This was not thought well-be<U+017F>eeming; and it was ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>een that the good Lady
thought her<U+017F>elf at <U+017F>ome Country-wedding. But they had not time to <U+017F>peak of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
there were heard <U+017F>uch loud cryings at the entrance of the Hall, that every one
asked what the matter was. <hi>Mercury</hi> came and told them, that it was only the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi>
of <hi>Mars</hi> were at cuffs with the <hi>Pages</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> for the leg of the <U+017F>oul of a
Turky-hen, which they had <U+017F>natch'd from tho<U+017F>e that took away. <hi>Iupiter</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> to be <U+017F>ent to them to teach them <U+017F>ilence. For as for <hi>Harpocrates,</hi>
who was the God of <hi><U+017F>ilence,</hi> he could not now hold his peace him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince his
mouth was opened; and therefore was <U+017F>o much the further from being able to make
others hold theirs: Be<U+017F>ides, it was now but fitting he could enjoy the pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which he took in <U+017F>peaking, while he had the means and liberty. It mu<U+017F>t be
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed the plea<U+017F>ure he took in it was <U+017F>o much the greater, by how much it was
more then ordinary with him. Not to mention, that the good chear he had made
had <U+017F>o po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd his brain, that he had forgotten his Quality.</p>
                        <p>This tumult being appea<U+017F>ed, they look'd towards <hi>Ianus,</hi> who being quite drunk
was grown very in<U+017F>olent. When <U+017F>upper began, he had put on his <hi>Serpent</hi> that bites
its own tail, like a Scarf; but now he had taken it off to be<U+017F>tow it about the ears of
tho<U+017F>e were near him; and he would needs go play the Tumbler, and make hey-pa<U+017F><U+017F>es
as if it had been through a hoop, had they not hindred him. For want of this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
he be<U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf to prattle with both his tongues together. His two mouths
abus'd one the other, contradicted and belyed one another; and pre<U+017F>ently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
friends again, defied one another to drink. If the one laugh'd, the other
cry'd; and if he had promi<U+017F>ed any thing with the mouth before, he perform'd never
the more for that, for that behind recall'd it, <U+017F>aying it had not con<U+017F>ented thereto.
Be<U+017F>ides, the face he had backward was the more ancient; and to <U+017F>eem knowing, it
would never be of the <U+017F>ame opinion with the other, which was its younger brother.
<hi>Iupiter</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Iuno</hi> did nothing but lowre at all this, caus'd the good <hi>Ianus</hi> to retire,
and be di<U+017F>pos'd on <U+017F>ome bed. Then the Table was taken away, and the nine <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Vulcan,</hi> who was not much acquainted with matters of that nature, <U+017F>aid there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Creatures which were dedicated to them were taken out of a place where they did

which did him no hurt, and which be<U+017F>ides belong'd not to him; and that he <U+017F>hould
rather have kill'd his own <hi>Eagle,</hi> or his Wife's <hi>Peacock,</hi> and not entertain his gue<U+017F>ts
at their own charges. You are angry at a <U+017F>mall matter, <U+017F>ays <hi>Jupiter:</hi> Is there any
rea<U+017F>on there <U+017F>hould remain any Bea<U+017F>ts in Heaven, when we <U+017F>end <U+017F>o many generous
Captains and learned Philo<U+017F>ophers to Hell? What <U+017F>ervice had we from <U+017F>o many
creatures, unle<U+017F>s it were to find pa<U+017F>time for the petty Gods, as <hi>Ganimed</hi> and <hi>Cupid,</hi>
who made it their employment to lead them up and down in a <U+017F>tring? Moreover, if
we had had he and <U+017F>he of every one, you might <U+017F>tand upon't that <U+017F>ome profit might
be made of them, and that they might bring forth young: But they were all di<U+017F>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable;
and if they had once but been any thing hot, I leave you to con<U+017F>ider
what kind of mon<U+017F>ters they had produced; as if the <hi>Bull</hi> and the <hi>Hydra</hi> had gone
together, or the <hi>Ram</hi> and the <hi>Bear.</hi> What's more then all; there would not have
been any <U+017F>hould have had any milk fit to make chee<U+017F>e of, and I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e there's none
will avow it had been any great revenue to go and milk them every day for nothing.
But if haply it be <U+017F>aid they had <U+017F>ome feathers or furs which would have <U+017F>erved us to
<U+017F>ome purpo<U+017F>e, I have done well to kill them, that we might have them. And to the
end there <U+017F>hould be no partiality u<U+017F>ed as to all the other Signs of heaven, both ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and inanimate, I have caus'd them all to be taken away, leaving nothing but
the Stars to give their ordinary light. As for the <hi>Demy-Gods</hi> &amp; <hi>Demy-Gode<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi> as the
<hi>Centaure</hi> and <hi>Andromedes,</hi> I have al<U+017F>o caus'd them to be removed, to wait on me in
my palace: And as for whatever was in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, I have di<U+017F>pos'd all to tho<U+017F>e u<U+017F>es
whereto they are mo<U+017F>t fit, as the <hi>Crown</hi> to put on <hi>Iuno's</hi> head, and the <hi>Bowl</hi> for my
<U+017F>elf to drink in. As for the River <hi>Eridan,</hi> I have not conceiv'd we have any need
of it; for it runs <U+017F>o <U+017F>lowly, that it is but as dead water, which is not good either to
drink or wa<U+017F>h any thing withall; and we had much ado to get <U+017F>o much clean water
as to wa<U+017F>h our hands before meat, which we have been fain to <U+017F>train through a cloth
to make it look a little clearer: Therefore I have cau<U+017F>ed certain holes to be made
in that part of heaven where that River is, <U+017F>o that it <U+017F>till glides down upon the earth;
and I believe men are <U+017F>omwhat amaz'd to <U+017F>ee it rain <U+017F>o plentifully. Now it is partly
for their <U+017F>akes that I have taken all the<U+017F>e Signs out of heaven; 'tis for to puni<U+017F>h

And this is the Remon<U+017F>trance which <hi>Jupiter</hi> made to the re<U+017F>t of the Gods; and
to <U+017F>ay truth, he had entertained <U+017F>uch a jealou<U+017F>ie again<U+017F>t <hi>Bacchus, Love, Sleep,</hi> and
<U+017F>ome others, who many times were ador'd in his <U+017F>tead, that he was big with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
to bring <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>chief on Gods and men together. Yet was there not one in
the Company dur<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cover his re<U+017F>entment, bethinking them<U+017F>elves, that if he was
truly angry, he was powerful enough to ruine them. The fair <hi>Phoebus</hi> well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
the day when he had bani<U+017F>h'd him out of heaven, and reduc'd him to a po<U+017F>ture
of begging in the earth, till at la<U+017F>t he was commended to <U+017F>ome petty King to be his
Cowherd. There was not one who could not call to minde <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch token of
his indignation; but as they were ruminating on this <U+017F>ad <U+017F>ubject, <hi>Comus</hi> enters the
Hall, with a Torch in his hand. <hi>Momus</hi> follow'd him cloath'd like a King, and
<hi>Vulcan</hi> dre<U+017F>s'd like a Queen; but he would have been <U+017F>o much the more di<U+017F>guis'd,
if he could have forborn limping. The other Maskers were clad, <U+017F>ome like Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
others like Philo<U+017F>ophers, and many like Trade<U+017F>men. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> dre<U+017F>t like a
a Fool, was going to expre<U+017F>s the moral of the Mask, while there enters of a <U+017F>udden
into the place a <U+017F>ort of people which no body knew. <hi>Iupiter</hi> thought they had had
relation to the former Maskers, but <hi>Vulcan</hi> and his fellow Actors had not brought
them in. The fir<U+017F>t of the troop, who had a Flaxen curl'd head of hair, and a

all wealth and honors, who come and demand thy a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. I will tell thee one
thing that never came into the con<U+017F>ideration of the Gods. There are in this place
a <U+017F>ort of Affronters, who be<U+017F>ides the charge which hath been given them, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached

hath hapned that we were not invited to thy Banquet. That yong Gallant that
<U+017F>tands by thee, who pretends to <U+017F>o much beauty with his golden Mu<U+017F>tachoes, <U+017F>hould
he not be content with the conduct of that Chariot which brings the day with it;

Every one <U+017F>trove to give the mo<U+017F>t antient records he could of the power then in

to <U+017F>trike <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>imple wretch, whom they thought not able to hurt any body, nor
had any other faculty then that of Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting.</p>

di<U+017F>turb their enjoyments, was faln a<U+017F>leep him<U+017F>elf, having gotten drunk in the Kitchin
among the Turn-<U+017F>pits, whereof he was one. She therefore being awake, and having
a de<U+017F>ire of revenge, made it her bu<U+017F>ines to <U+017F>tir up the <hi>modern Gods</hi> again<U+017F>t the <hi>antient.</hi>
And <hi>Iupiter</hi> <U+017F>eeing that blows were dealt in the di<U+017F>order by all, without con<U+017F>idering
whether they were friends or foes, knew that the final ruine of <U+017F>o many different
Divinities was neer at hand: And not deigning any other but him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>hould have
the honour to end this difference, he hurl'd his Thunder-bolt among the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
not caring to de<U+017F>troy him<U+017F>elf withall. This blow was <U+017F>o effectual, that his
Palace was turn'd to a<U+017F>hes with it, and <U+017F>ince that time there hath not been any Poet
could tell us what became of all tho<U+017F>e were in it: But the more knowing <U+017F>ort of
men, who I expect <U+017F>hould give me <U+017F>ome credit, will hence ea<U+017F>ily in<U+017F>er that all tho<U+017F>e
fal<U+017F>e Gods are not now in the world; and if there cannot any more be <U+017F>een in the
heavens tho<U+017F>e living creatures they had plac'd there, it's to be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed they were all
eaten up at this Banquet, as I have told you, and that there remained nothing but
Stars. And if men cannot ob<U+017F>erve the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>chariots</hi> drawn by hor<U+017F>es,
it is becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e great Luminaries have their dependance on an Infinite Power
who makes them go alone, without having occa<U+017F>ion to be drawn by tho<U+017F>e excellent
Waggoners which the folly of Poets had be<U+017F>towed on them. Whoever therefore
that <U+017F>hall any more mention the<U+017F>e powerle<U+017F>s Divinities, after he hath heard what we
have deliver'd of them, let him a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him<U+017F>elf he <U+017F>hall be taken for one, who e<U+017F>teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <p>For my part, if you think it <U+017F>trange I have related all you have heard, know I
receiv'd it from <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who at the beginning of the fray of the Gods went out
of the Palace, and finding at the gate the Bow of <hi>Iris</hi> which is the Ladder of heaven,

lid down along to the earth; where having a long time wandred up and down,
a fancy took him to turn <hi>Iackdaw,</hi> as he had <U+017F>ometimes been a <hi>Cock.</hi> I had
bought him of a Bird-<U+017F>eller, and had made him <U+017F>o tame that he would come and
feed out of my hand. One day he jump'd upon my table, where there was an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet
in a great character: After he had divers times pointed at certain Letters
with his bill, I <U+017F>ate me down and ob<U+017F>erved him, imagining there might be <U+017F>omwhat
of de<U+017F>ign in it, as indeed there was; for not being able to <U+017F>peak, he acquainted me
with his fortune by that invention. I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>pent many long dayes to put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the letters he touch'd, and exactly write the words; and be<U+017F>ides I mi<U+017F>took
<U+017F>ometimes, and mi<U+017F>ob<U+017F>erved the characters: So that my Daw bethought it to take
ink in his bill, and to write me down his intentions, to <U+017F>pare me that trouble. By that
means I got from him one part; and for the other, he told it me with his tongue,
which by little and little began to be unbound, and <U+017F>o gave me the full relation of
the <hi>Banquet of the Gods.</hi> I think this learned Bird was unwilling I <U+017F>hould know any
more from him: For as <U+017F>oon as the la<U+017F>t Letter of the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e I received from him
was fini<U+017F>h'd, he flew away through a window which I had left open, not thinking

HEre <hi>Montenor</hi> gave over reading, there being no more in his Papers; and
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> affirm'd, that all he had heard was infinitely plea<U+017F>ant; but he
wondred at one thing only, which was, that the Gods took no <hi>Tobacco</hi>

carried <U+017F>ome always about him, and 'tis to be conceiv'd, that after this famous Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
he did take <U+017F>ome. The Author a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd it, and told me at the <U+017F>ame time, that
there was not any but <hi>Prometheus,</hi> who would ta<U+017F>te of this new di<U+017F>h. And that he
hath not mention'd it, was becau<U+017F>e he conceiv'd that did nothing again<U+017F>t the Poets:
no more hath he <U+017F>aid, that <hi>Mars</hi> dur<U+017F>t drink neither wine nor nectar, and that he had
by him <U+017F>ome Diet-drink in a bottle, which <hi>Ae<U+017F>culapius</hi> had pre<U+017F>ented him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he drank now and then, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Venus</hi> had given him the Running of the Reins.
In like manner divers other unde<U+017F>cent things have been pa<U+017F>t by, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould have
prov'd of ill example to the Readers; and particularly there hath been nothing <U+017F>aid

of his profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion. The Author re<U+017F>erves all that for the Commentaries he intends
upon his <hi>Banquet of the Gods;</hi> and in the mean time the<U+017F>e good things are only
<U+017F>poken under the Ro<U+017F>e, and to Good-fellows.</p>
            <p>But we are yet to know the opinion of our noble <hi>Shepherd</hi> of this Piece. In good
faith the Author is a crafty knave, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> yet he hath a good wit, 'tis his own
fault, if he make not good u<U+017F>e of it, but I <U+017F>hould have wi<U+017F>ht, he had <U+017F>poken of the
Gods more reverently then he hath. You do not apprehend the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, replyes
<hi>Montenor,</hi> do you not <U+017F>ee it is his de<U+017F>ign to abu<U+017F>e them? The Ancients have left
us many mon<U+017F>trous volumas, wherein there is neither rea<U+017F>on nor conduct. Every
one feigns and imagines a world of Divinities, as they plea<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves; and if one
hath a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd them <U+017F>uch a father and mother, he that writ after him, hath found
them others. As for the places of their birth, and their <U+017F>everal actions, they agree
as ill as the Clocks of the Suburbs do with tho<U+017F>e of the City. Be<U+017F>ides, they relate
<hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es</hi> and other miracles, that have not any probability at all. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
would laugh at all this, and note, that all the Poets are much oblig'd to him, for
in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he hath clear'd up abundance of ob<U+017F>cure things, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
under<U+017F>tood not, and whereof they could not give any <U+017F>hadow of rea<U+017F>on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
all he hath <U+017F>aid of the the <hi>Thread</hi> of the <hi>De<U+017F>tinies,</hi> of the <hi>Signs</hi> of heaven, of
<hi>Aurora</hi> and the <hi>Sun;</hi> they are things, which though they render the Fables ridiculous,
yet give withal a greater di<U+017F>covery of their ab<U+017F>urdities. As for in<U+017F>tance, The Poets
a<U+017F><U+017F>ure us that the <hi>Sun</hi> is a God fill'd with heat and light, who walking through the
heavens, enlightens us here; and yet they <U+017F>ay withal, that having lent his Chariot
to <hi>Phaeton,</hi> he gave the world the day in<U+017F>tead of the other, but that approaching
too near the earth, he was like to burn it up; what an ab<U+017F>urdity is this? for <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Sun</hi> him<U+017F>elf was not there, what light and what heat could there be? In
what manner have tho<U+017F>e egregious Cock<U+017F>combs ever explain'd this? No, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
troubled them<U+017F>elves to do it; for they <U+017F>peak confu<U+017F>edly of the power of their
Divinities, without laying any foundation for things. They have never given us
any certain information, whether that body which we <U+017F>ee be the head of the God
<hi>Apollo,</hi> (as it is likely, becau<U+017F>e there is an appearance of a face) or whether it be a
Torch he carries in his hand, or haply his Chariot all a fire. Some call him <hi>Phoebus</hi>
with the golden hair, others the Torch of the day, and others the burning Chariot.
How then <U+017F>hall we under<U+017F>tand the Fable of <hi>Phaeton?</hi> without que<U+017F>tion we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay
that there is in the heaven a great Globe of fire, which <hi>Apollo</hi> fa<U+017F>tens behinde his
Head, or behinde his Chariot, when he is to go his cour<U+017F>e, and that it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
he might have given it to his Son. But wher's he among the Poets, that hath thus
particulariz'd the<U+017F>e things. It is my Author hath found out this <U+017F>leight, and hath
taught it me; doth he not <U+017F>ay that the Sun <hi>fa<U+017F>tens his beams about his head?</hi> I <U+017F>hould
never have done, if I would <U+017F>pecifie all the places where he hath clear'd up the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

Remember it, that you may ob<U+017F>erve them, and believe what I tell you, and
that is, that the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e I have now read to you, excels all the Poets have ever
writ. All will not grant you that, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme;</hi> con<U+017F>ider, that the <hi>Fables</hi> of
the <hi>Poets</hi> are <hi>My<U+017F>tical</hi> things, wherein all the ancient wi<U+017F>dom lies hid. They have
done well to make you believe that, replyes <hi>Montenor:</hi> There is <hi>Notalis, Comes,</hi>
and <U+017F>ome other Gentlemen of Lea<U+017F>ure, who have employ'd them<U+017F>elves to make <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologies,</hi>
and have found out tho<U+017F>e expo<U+017F>itions of the Fables, which never came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the imaginations of the Poets. But a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, that if I had a minde to
moralize on the <hi>Romance</hi> of <hi>Mellu<U+017F>in,</hi> and <hi>Robin the Devil,</hi> I could finde out as
hand<U+017F>ome things, as upon that of the <hi>Syrens</hi> and <hi>Hercules.</hi> What do you think
my Author hath <U+017F>aid any thing without rea<U+017F>on? If the Night-cap and Spectacles of
<hi>Fate</hi> fall down in dancing, he <U+017F>hall tell you what it <U+017F>ignifies, and he is able enough
to make a Methologie on his <hi>Banquet of the Gods.</hi> Be not angry, we ea<U+017F>ily believe
it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you withal, that I have a great e<U+017F>teem of the ingenuity of
this Author; but I would not advi<U+017F>e him to print this piece by it <U+017F>elf, becau<U+017F>e it is
too <U+017F>hort. My <hi>Genius</hi> tells me he is de<U+017F>ign'd to compo<U+017F>e my Hi<U+017F>tory? 'tis there he
may di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of it. What know you whether it will be convenient, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi>
Men laugh at tho<U+017F>e who have foi<U+017F>ted into their <hi>Romances</hi> things which were not to
the purpo<U+017F>e. I'll furni<U+017F>h you with another invention, he mu<U+017F>t in its proper place
mention that the <hi>Banquet of the Gods</hi> hath been read to you, and then it <U+017F>hall be
put in the end of the Book by it <U+017F>elf. If divers Anthors I could name, had known
this cunning <U+017F>light, their works would have been better by much, and they could
not have been tax'd to have interlarded them with Hi<U+017F>tories and Ver<U+017F>es repeated to
<U+017F>o little purpo<U+017F>e, that the Readers pa<U+017F>s them over when they meet them. Thus in
the <hi>Argemi,</hi> there are <U+017F>uch long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es as might make a Book apart, be<U+017F>ides that
fine Story of the <hi>Excrement,</hi> with the Ver<U+017F>es on that <U+017F>ubject; which <hi>Barclay</hi> would
needs thru<U+017F>t into his <hi>Romance,</hi> for to give it a better <U+017F>ent in the world. Thou art Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical,
friend, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> keep thy advi<U+017F>e to thy <U+017F>elf, make thy own Hi<U+017F>tory, after
thy own fa<U+017F>hion, and let me alone to take order for mine. This <hi>Banquet of the Gods</hi>
is not improper for me as tho<U+017F>e pieces thou quote<U+017F>t. It treats of tho<U+017F>e things which
have mo<U+017F>t relation to what I have in de<U+017F>ign; and it is <U+017F>o much to my purpo<U+017F>e, that
I <U+017F>hall remember it as long as I live; and he that <U+017F>hould not put it in would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
an error, and <U+017F>hould not be a faithful Hi<U+017F>torian; for <U+017F>eeing it is true it hath been
read to me, it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary it <U+017F>hould be put down word for word, to <U+017F>hew what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence
the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e might have, and what judgement I <U+017F>hould make of it. But
<U+017F>tay, <U+017F>eeing my renown is di<U+017F>pers'd every where, and that the Painters have already
taken my picture, may it not be that <U+017F>ome <hi>Romanci<U+017F>t</hi> of this age hath already un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to write of my <hi>Loves;</hi> for there are tho<U+017F>e who hunt every where for <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to exerci<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves on. I am clearly again<U+017F>t it, that's a thing ought
not to be done without my approbation. He thereupon turn'd to the <hi>Stationer,</hi>
and <U+017F>aid to him, Sir, have you not THE LOVES OF THE SHEPHERD
LYSIS? No indeed Sir, replyes the Stationer, I do not know the Book; I do
not believe there is any hath <U+017F>uch a Tile. I am very glad on't replyes the <hi>Shepherd,</hi>
you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch a thing one day, and you <U+017F>hall have the Copy of it. I acquaint
you that I am going to <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> to run through divers adventures for to amplifie
the matter; and believe it, there will happen to me <U+017F>uch rare things, that when
they are well writ, as I hope they <U+017F>hall be, and that you <U+017F>hall make them be well
printed, there will <U+017F>ell more of the Book, then any other in the world: For know,
that I ob<U+017F>erve the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Loving</hi> better then any lover that ever appear'd on the
Theatre of Hi<U+017F>tory. I am <U+017F>orry I came not hither in my Shepherds habit, you
<U+017F>hould have <U+017F>een that it became me better then that <hi>Celadon,</hi> who is in the Fronti<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of your <hi>A<U+017F>traea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Stationer <U+017F>eeing that <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> could not forbear laughing at
the<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ant extravagancies, could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh too. There were <U+017F>ome in
the <U+017F>hop who came to buy Books, and they were <U+017F>omewhat amaz'd at it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering
the actions and words of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> did almo<U+017F>t take him for what he was. A
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43725:62"/>
Sallad-wench that was in the <U+017F>treet, quite ravi<U+017F>h'd with admiration to <U+017F>ee him,
pluck'd by the apron one that cry'd Hot bak'd Pears, for to <U+017F>tay her and make her
partake of the plea<U+017F>ure: Nay there was a Begger, who for being taken up there,
lo<U+017F>t a me<U+017F>s of Pottage which he <U+017F>hould have had three doors off.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> being in ha<U+017F>te to be gone, took five or <U+017F>ix books, and paid the
Stationer for them. But <hi>Montenor</hi> looking what they were, <U+017F>aid, Certainly you have
not much to do with mony, <U+017F>eeing you be<U+017F>tow it <U+017F>o ill: For my part, I am <U+017F>ick at
the heart if I but hear read three lines of tho<U+017F>e fopperies: The<U+017F>e books are as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to tho<U+017F>e that read them not, as to tho<U+017F>e that read them. You under<U+017F>tand not
our affairs, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to him: We buy the<U+017F>e books for no other end but to <U+017F>ee if
we can do greater wonders then what are related in them; you <U+017F>hall have your
<U+017F>hare of the plea<U+017F>ure there will be to <U+017F>ee them done: A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, that if the
Lovers in the<U+017F>e hi<U+017F>tories pa<U+017F>s two days without eating, I will four; and if they <U+017F>hed
tears as big as ones thumb, I will <U+017F>hed as big as ones head. You mean a pins head
perhaps, replies <hi>Montenor;</hi> and if you fa<U+017F>t all day, you will bur<U+017F>t with eating at
night. You are a <U+017F>coffer, <hi>Montenor,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> you <U+017F>hall find that my words and
my actions can well keep hou<U+017F>e together.</p>
            <p>That being pa<U+017F>t, he went into the Coach with <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> al<U+017F>o, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
he then had no hor<U+017F>e. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> took this Gentleman home to <U+017F>upper: And
as he was <U+017F>till <U+017F>hewing <hi>The Banquet of the Gods,</hi> which he had taken back from the
Stationer, he <U+017F>aid, that <U+017F>eeing <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thought the Piece too <U+017F>hort to be printed by it
<U+017F>elf, he would return it to the Author. Nor made he any difficulty to tell them, that
he who had made it was call'd <hi>Clarimond,</hi> a Young-man of mo<U+017F>t excellent parts,
and one that liv'd hard by his hou<U+017F>e in <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts. Ly<U+017F>is</hi> under<U+017F>tanding <U+017F>o much,
was infinitely <U+017F>atisfied, promi<U+017F>ing he <U+017F>hould one day di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of him as he
plea<U+017F>ed.</p>
            <p>He <U+017F>pent the night, and the be<U+017F>t part of the next day in reading the books which
were bought: And the day of their departure being come, <hi>Montenor</hi> came to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elme's</hi>
hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that they went all three together in the Coach. They ask'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
whether he knew how many leagues it were from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts?</hi> He an<U+017F>wered,
that to his remembrance he had heard <U+017F>ay there was a hundred. Who told you <U+017F>o
are deceiv'd, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme;</hi> and if they have counted a hundred leagues hence into
that Country, they have not known the neare<U+017F>t way. But without any further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
as to that point, I'll bring you thither in two dayes. I make no que<U+017F>tion
of that, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> it may be <hi>Love</hi> hath lent your hor<U+017F>es wings to make them go
fa<U+017F>ter.</p>
            <p>They entertained them<U+017F>elves in this manner with many excellent Poetical imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
by the way, as al<U+017F>o in the Innes where they baited. In the evening they
reach'd a Village, whereof <hi>Montenor's</hi> Brother was Lord; the Gentlemans name
was <hi>Fleurial,</hi> and his Wife's was called <hi>Cecilia. An<U+017F>elme</hi> was willing to go <U+017F>ee them
before he went to <hi>Brie,</hi> that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> conceiving they went a great way, might believe
he was carried into <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts. Montenor's</hi> Si<U+017F>ter-in-law, who was a merry Grig, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
di<U+017F>cover'd that the Young-man had not the <U+017F>ounde<U+017F>t brain: And to be more
certain of it, <U+017F>he <U+017F>et upon him and ask'd him why he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad as he <U+017F>eem'd to be?
Such a courteous Lady mu<U+017F>t not be denied, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Know therefore that if I
am melancholick, the rea<U+017F>on is, that I too much think on the beauties of one, who<U+017F>e
feir eye enchants me. What, <U+017F>he is one-ey'd then whom you love! replies <hi>Cecilia;</hi>
for you <U+017F>peak but of one eye. Pardon me, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> 'tis only that the be<U+017F>t Poets
always u<U+017F>e this phra<U+017F>e, though their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es have two eyes: And if you will have
a rea<U+017F>on of it, it is becau<U+017F>e the beams of both eyes meet together as if there were
but one; or el<U+017F>e becau<U+017F>e there is but one eye that hurts, and the other heals. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides,
there are Lovers which <U+017F>ay, that their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es have the Sun in one eye, and
the Moon in the other; and <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> believes that <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>andra</hi> had <hi>Venus</hi> in the left
eye, and <hi>Mars</hi> in the right. But to return to my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: You are to believe
<U+017F>he is adorn'd with the pillage of the <hi>Graces;</hi> and though <U+017F>he have a hue of <hi><U+017F>now,</hi>
yet doth <U+017F>he not cea<U+017F>e to <U+017F>et me on fire perpetually. Good God! if <U+017F>he be <U+017F>now,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43725:63"/>
and live in <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> there mu<U+017F>t be care taken <U+017F>he be not melted by the <U+017F>un, for it is
a great deal hotter there then 'tis here; and if we had now a little piece of her body,
we might make good u<U+017F>e of it to put into the gla<U+017F><U+017F>es to cool the wine. How could
that be, <U+017F>eeing I tell you it heats? <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Be<U+017F>ides, as for the <U+017F>un, <U+017F>he fears it
not, for <U+017F>he is a Sun her<U+017F>elf. How happy are you then, when you are neer her! if
you have but a Sun-dyal, you may know what it is of the clock. That cannot be,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> for her rayes are <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong, that they pierce through the opake bodies,
and make no <U+017F>hadow. Let us return to our fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that is to <U+017F>ay concerning
the whitene<U+017F>s of my Shepherde<U+017F>s: You are to know <U+017F>he hath a countenance of
<hi>milk.</hi> She hath an ugly one then, <U+017F>ays <hi>Cecilia;</hi> why do you affect her? I <U+017F>ay, of
<hi>curded-milk,</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> Do you apprehend me? I do, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Cecilia,</hi> that <U+017F>he
hath a countenance of Cows milk: but do not the Flies as they pa<U+017F>s by pitch on it
for to drink, and are there not <U+017F>ome drown'd? All that are there e<U+017F>cape <U+017F>hipwrack,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for there are blown Ro<U+017F>es on her cheeks, whereon the<U+017F>e filthy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
light and ride on them with as great pomp as if they were in a <U+017F>hip. If this
milk be good to make chee<U+017F>e of, <U+017F>ays <hi>Cecilia,</hi> you will get much by <U+017F>uch a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
<U+017F>he will be a great revenue to you. That it is good to make chee<U+017F>e, I can a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Montenor,</hi> who over-heard them; for there are already yellow <U+017F>pots on the
cheeks of this Beauty, as there are on a chee<U+017F>e that hath been <U+017F>ix moneths a ripening
in a cellar. Hold you your peace, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to him; you <U+017F>peak with little re<U+017F>pect of
the Wonder of this age; 'tis well <U+017F>een that you know her not. I return therefore
to what I <U+017F>aid before, that there are a many <hi>Ro<U+017F>es</hi> blown on the face of my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s,
and not <hi>Marigolds,</hi> as <hi>Montenor</hi> <U+017F>ays.</p>
            <p>This perfect Lover was in the road to have <U+017F>poken many other things to maintain
the glory of <hi>Charite:</hi> But the Ma<U+017F>ter of the hou<U+017F>e broke off all the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es,
that they might <U+017F>it down to <U+017F>upper, where he would not permit any talk but of
drinking. After <U+017F>upper there pa<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>o many divers di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es between <hi>Cecilia</hi> and
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that <U+017F>he was infinitely pleas'd with him, and the next morning her greate<U+017F>t
regret was the departure of her gue<U+017F>ts. The <U+017F>econd day at evening, they being
neer the place where they were to go, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> gave <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> notice of it, whereat he
took <U+017F>o great <U+017F>atisfaction, that he began to propo<U+017F>e to him<U+017F>elf what they <U+017F>hould do
when they were come to the banks of <hi>Lignon.</hi> As for you, <hi>Montenor!</hi> you are
well known there, <U+017F>eeing you have a <U+017F>eat there: But as for me and <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> we
are not known there at all. Methinks I imagine we are already <U+017F>urrounded with a
world of Shepherds, who ask what we are: We mu<U+017F>t give them an account of our
<U+017F>elves, and declare the nice<U+017F>t particularities of our life to all we meet, though we
know them not; for that hath been from the beginning the cu<U+017F>tom in amorous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.
For my part, I know well enough what I have to <U+017F>ay; but <hi>An<U+017F>elme!</hi>
ha<U+017F>t thou bethought thy <U+017F>elf? wilt thou <U+017F>peak of <hi>Geneura</hi> or <hi>Angelica?</hi> I'll do
neither, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> I'll <U+017F>peak nothing but fained things. I'll make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
I am <U+017F>ome Prince of <hi>Tran<U+017F>ilvania,</hi> and that I have already <U+017F>et out my <hi>Romance.</hi>
It will not be ami<U+017F>s to lye a little, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but I'll give thee an incomparable
<U+017F>hift, which I <U+017F>hould make u<U+017F>e of my <U+017F>elf, were it not that I de<U+017F>ire nothing but to
po<U+017F><U+017F>es <hi>Charite,</hi> and that there is no ambition can oblige me to leave the Country.
And it is this; Thou mu<U+017F>t not give any certain hints of thy race, take heed of that:
Make as if rather that thou knowe<U+017F>t not who were thy father and mother; and that
<U+017F>ome Shepherd finding thee as a <U+017F>heep was <U+017F>uckling thee, took thee up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
thee ever <U+017F>ince. By this means it may happen, that if <U+017F>ome great Prince hath
lo<U+017F>t a child, he'll believe thou art he; and <U+017F>o redeeming thee out of ob<U+017F>curity, thou
wilt be advanced to royalties. Who can tell, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> whether there be any
Prince at pre<U+017F>ent that hath lo<U+017F>t a <U+017F>on? and if there were any, do you <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e he would
acknowledge me for his? Woe is me! what a <U+017F>mall experience art thou ma<U+017F>ter
of! replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I will give thee an infallible argument for what I <U+017F>ay. Ha<U+017F>t thou
ever ob<U+017F>erved in Hi<U+017F>tory, that any of tho<U+017F>e that have been <U+017F>o expo<U+017F>ed to the

theirs?</p>

While <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was in the<U+017F>e propo<U+017F>als, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> gave him a very <U+017F>ober audience, as
if he had made it his de<U+017F>ign to make his advantage of what he <U+017F>aid; but bethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him<U+017F>elf,
that they were now in the mid<U+017F>t of <hi>Brie,</hi> and that he already <U+017F>aw the
little River of <hi>Morin,</hi> he cryes out with great chearfulne<U+017F>s, O Shepherd! now we
are come to the place where we de<U+017F>ire to be; Behold, there is the plea<U+017F>ant River of
<hi>Lignon. Ly<U+017F>is</hi> putting his head out of the Coach, There it is indeed, <U+017F>ays he, it is
ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch as the books repre<U+017F>ent it to us. I <U+017F>ee already the Bridge of <hi>Boutere<U+017F><U+017F>e,</hi> over
which we are to pa<U+017F>s. But where is the Palace of <hi>I<U+017F>oura?</hi> where is <hi>Mont-Bri<U+017F>on,
Feurs,</hi> and <hi>Verdun? Montenor</hi> then <U+017F>hew'd him certain Steeples thereabout, and
made him believe they were the places he ask'd for. While they were thus engag'd,
another extravagancy coming into the minde of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> he cry'd out, O what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>iderate
man am I! <U+017F>hall I enter into this Country with my City cloathes on?
What did I think on this morning, that I did not put on my Shepherds habit? I
mu<U+017F>t put off my cloathes pre<U+017F>ently. Stay a little, <U+017F>ays <hi>Montenor,</hi> we have but a
league to my hou<U+017F>e, we <U+017F>hall not meet any body till we come thither. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> not
regarding this Remon<U+017F>trance, made the Coachman <U+017F>tay, and <U+017F>ent a Lacquay after a
Mule of <hi>An<U+017F>elme's,</hi> which always went before with the luggage. There mu<U+017F>t needs
be had the Port-mantle, wherein the Shepherds habit was, and being gotten under
a Wall-nut tree, he put off the <U+017F>uit he had on, and put on the other.</p>
            <p>When he had done, he returnrd to the Coach, which drove on as before, and
was to pa<U+017F>s over the Bridge, which he called the Bridge of <hi>Boutere<U+017F><U+017F>e.</hi> Ah! dear
waves, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>peaking to the River, I believe you have no other <U+017F>ource then
the tears of <hi>Lovers;</hi> but if you can now bear but <U+017F>mall wherries, you <U+017F>hall hence
forward be able to carry <U+017F>hips, <U+017F>o much <U+017F>hall I <U+017F>well you up with my tears.</p>
            <p>While he <U+017F>poke this he wept, but it was for joy; and being revi<U+017F>h'd to <U+017F>ee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
in <U+017F>o brave a Country, <U+017F>ays he to tho<U+017F>e with him, we mu<U+017F>t not delay any longer
to <U+017F>alute it; and having caus'd the Coach to be <U+017F>taid again, and the boot taken down,
he enjoyn'd every one to ki<U+017F>s the earth, as he did. I <U+017F>alute thee dear Country, where
<hi>Love</hi> hath his <hi>Empire,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, with his hat in his hand, receive me for one of thy
inhabitants, and I promi<U+017F>e to render thee more famous then thou ha<U+017F>t ever been.</p>
            <p>Every one being gotten into the Coach again, after this Cermony, <U+017F>ays he to
<hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> Methinks your names are not fit for Shepherds; will you
not change them? You are to know, that when a man turns Shepherd, he ob<U+017F>erves
the <U+017F>ame cu<U+017F>tom, as when he turns Monk, he mu<U+017F>t ever change his name, ye mu<U+017F>t at
lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e yours. By no means replyes <hi>Monteonr;</hi> for we have each of us an
old Aunt, that hath no children, <U+017F>he will not acknowledge us for her heirs, if we
<U+017F>hould quit the name of our family. Well, we will excu<U+017F>e that, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but
you are both clad in gray Spani<U+017F>h cloath, will you <U+017F>ubmit to no change as to cloaths?
But to <U+017F>ay truth, this habit is <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> enough in my judgement; keep it, I am very
well pleas'd with it; if mine were yet to make, I would have <U+017F>uch another. Gray
is ever good for the Countrey; and I will tell you how <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the three
E<U+017F>tates of <hi>France:</hi> They <U+017F>ay there are <hi>Red, Black</hi> and <hi>Gray;</hi> by the <hi>Red,</hi> is meant a
<hi>Gentleman;</hi> by the <hi>Black,</hi> a <hi>Citizen;</hi> and by the <hi>Grey,</hi> a <hi>Countreyman.</hi> Now I
have heard a very excellent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e on this occa<U+017F>ion; which is, That if the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> commonly go in Scarlet, they do it to the end, that if they were hurt,
they might not <U+017F>ee their own blood run down their cloathes, and be thence di<U+017F>heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and that their adver<U+017F>aries not ob<U+017F>erving it neither, might not think to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
advantage thereby. As for <hi>Schollars</hi> and Lawyers, that they are in <hi>black</hi> is,
becau<U+017F>e their principal employment is to write, and becau<U+017F>e they will not wear a
colour, which might receive any injury from ink. And if the <hi>Pea<U+017F>antry</hi> wear gray,
'tis that being always in the du<U+017F>t, it might not be <U+017F>o apparent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> did much admire the<U+017F>e excellent ob<U+017F>ervations; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
rea<U+017F>uming the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, di<U+017F>cover'd much di<U+017F>atisfaction that he was not cloath'd as
they were, and among other things, <U+017F>pake the<U+017F>e words, <hi>I doubt not but my cloathes
are enough after the Pa<U+017F>toral mode: but the <U+017F>tuff likes me not, becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>mells <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the Ayr of</hi> Paris. <hi>It was good enough at St.</hi> Cloud, <hi>which is but eight or nine
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43725:64"/>
miles di<U+017F>tant from</hi> Pompe, <hi>I do not <U+017F>ay that of the New-bridge, I mean that of cloathes.
How I hate the <U+017F>umptuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of that proud Citie! The Porters go there in their <U+017F>ilks,
and I fear me the exce<U+017F>s will <U+017F>hortly come to that height, that your Coblers will have
their Aprons of perfum'd Leather, the Carmen carts of Ebony, and the Waterbearers
will have their yokes embroider'd, and have chains of gold in<U+017F>tead of leather <U+017F>traps.
Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having <U+017F>aid this, was per<U+017F>waded he <U+017F>hould not hate his own cloathes, <U+017F>eeing
they were made, and that all his actions were guided by a good Genius, who had
not coun<U+017F>ell'd him to wear it, if he had not thought it convenient; <U+017F>o that he was
not now troubled at any thing, but that it came into his minde, that he had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to bring his Gitarhe from <hi>Paris.</hi> Having acquainted <hi>Montenor</hi> with it, he bid
him not trouble him<U+017F>elf; and told him, he would furni<U+017F>h him with a very good one
at his hou<U+017F>e. That's very well, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> now I <U+017F>hall not be u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s here, no more
then others: All Shepherds <U+017F>hould play on <U+017F>ome in<U+017F>trument, for to recreate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
in their <U+017F>olitude. But <U+017F>tay, what an important thing have I forgotten be<U+017F>ides!
Ah! my dear <hi>Sheephook</hi> where are you? I have left you at <hi>An<U+017F>elme's</hi> hou<U+017F>e. That's
no great matter, <U+017F>ays <hi>Montenor,</hi> I promi<U+017F>e to furni<U+017F>h you with one worthy the hand
of fair <hi>Paris. Ly<U+017F>is</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of that, made no further complaint, but fell to ob<U+017F>erve
the fields on both <U+017F>ides with much content. A Little after, they came to a plain
Countrey-hou<U+017F>e, which was <hi>Montenors,</hi> where they alighted; and not long after,
Supper was brought in. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who dreamt not while he was eating, that the
night came on, would needs walk out after Supper, but <hi>Montenor</hi> calling for a candle,
told him, it was bed-time, and that <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>t were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary after the wearine<U+017F>s of
the journey, and that the next day there would be lea<U+017F>ure enough to <U+017F>ee the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
The Shepherd would not believe him, and notwith<U+017F>tanding all the per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they us'd, to detain him, he went out of the hou<U+017F>e, having not the patience to
expect day, that he might the better ob<U+017F>erve the <hi>Mountains,</hi> the <hi>Rocks,</hi> the <hi>Springs,</hi>
and the <hi>Woods.</hi> He cro<U+017F>s'd the fields up and down, without any heed at all, out of
an imagination that he was in <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts;</hi> and though he could not <U+017F>ee his hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, yet he conceiv'd he took notice of the places. Here, <U+017F>ays he, hath <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
many times entertain'd <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas, Phillis;</hi> there's the wood where was
the fal<U+017F>e <hi>Druid,</hi> and I think I am not far from the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas:</hi> While he
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, he came near an old decay'd hou<U+017F>e, whence there i<U+017F><U+017F>ues a great Dog, that
came and bark'd very earne<U+017F>tly after him. He bethought him<U+017F>elf, that if he could
catch him, he would be very fit to keep his <U+017F>heep, when he <U+017F>hould have any; <U+017F>o he
made towards the Dog, thinking by this fine Complement, to make him quiet.
Melampus, <hi>poor Cur! come to me, I will be <U+017F>o good a Ma<U+017F>ter to thee, that thou wilt not
de<U+017F>ire to change thy form into humane, <U+017F>uch an ea<U+017F>ie <U+017F>ervice wilt thou have under me.</hi>
Notwith<U+017F>tanding all this cajolling, the Dog bark'd <U+017F>till; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who was <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a Coward, runs away, and having got two or three <U+017F>tones, ca<U+017F>t them at him.
The Dog ran after him, and bit him in the legs, <U+017F>o that he made him make yet more
ha<U+017F>te to be gone. When he <U+017F>aw him<U+017F>elf out of danger, he re<U+017F>ted him<U+017F>elf a while
to take his breath; which when he had done, fearing <U+017F>ome wor<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>chance, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to return to <hi>Montenors;</hi> but he was above an hour ere he found his way, and
'twas by chance he found it at all. He forgot not to relate the misfortune had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to him, and he complain'd much of the great di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ie of the Dogs of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts.
An<U+017F>elme</hi> having <U+017F>omewhat comforted him, he went to bed where they had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him.</p>
            <p>The next morning, all the hou<U+017F>e being up, he admir'd the weather was <U+017F>o fair,
and <U+017F>aid, that he thought it was not the <U+017F>ame Sun in that Countrey, as in the <hi>I<U+017F>le
of France;</hi> <U+017F>o much did he think it more re<U+017F>plendent, but he attributed that to
the pre<U+017F>ence of his Shepherde<U+017F>s. After dinner, there hapned an opportunity to <U+017F>ee
her; for <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had de<U+017F>ign'd to wait on <hi>Angelica. Montenor</hi> gave order for the
<U+017F>adling of three hor<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>o went into the Court with <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and the <hi>Shepherd.</hi>
What do you intend to do? <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for my part, I will not ride, it is not the
cu<U+017F>tom of Shepherds: Go you thither if you will, and I will take my own time to
follow you; for I will not do a thing that none of my Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors ever did;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43725:64"/>
I'll rather not <U+017F>ee <hi>Charitie</hi> at all: I know <U+017F>he would laugh at me, if I <U+017F>hould. Before
I become a Cavalier, I'll <U+017F>tay here for good and all, I tell you plainly. <hi>Montenor,</hi>
give me your Gytar to employ my <U+017F>elf<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> And now I think on't, where's the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hook
you promis'd me? methinks I have not any pre<U+017F>ence at all, if I have
not one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montenor</hi> de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>atisfie him, carried him into a Cabinet; where he <U+017F>hew'd
him his Gytar, and afterward gave him a very hand<U+017F>om Sheephook, that had <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
been a Shepherds of his own. That done, he per<U+017F>waded <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to get a hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back:
but he would by no means do it, <U+017F>aying it was not hand<U+017F>om to be on hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
with a Sheephook in ones hand. So that <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> to determine all the<U+017F>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>ts,
was fain to cau<U+017F>e the hor<U+017F>es to be put into the coach; whereupon they got in
all three, and were brought to <hi>Oronte's</hi> ca<U+017F>tle. <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> were very
glad to <U+017F>ee him in that Country, where they had not much company; and were
very inqui<U+017F>itive to know what had happened to the Shepherd, <U+017F>ince they had
<U+017F>een him.</p>
            <p>While <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> were treating the Ladies, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> asked one of the
Lacquays where <hi>Charite</hi> was? He an<U+017F>wered him, that he knew her not: So that
the <hi>Shepherd</hi> began to be angry. In the mean while the Kitchin-maid came in; and
knowing well enough what he meant, told him that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was in the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drobe.
He went and courted her with that reverence he thought became him: And
the Fair one, who was not any thing proud, return'd his civility, and pray'd him to
<U+017F>it down. He was <U+017F>omwhat loth to do it, <U+017F>aying he <U+017F>hould ever be on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her: But at length, becau<U+017F>e he would not contradict her, he took a chair and
<U+017F>ate down. As it is the fir<U+017F>t talk of tho<U+017F>e who have no other thing to <U+017F>ay, to <U+017F>peak
of the weather; <hi>Charite</hi> <U+017F>ays to him, that <U+017F>he found it very hot. I am very glad,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to her, that you begin to feel the heat which you make others <U+017F>uffer: I
would the Gods were pleas'd that you al<U+017F>o knew how much you have hurt me!
Who? I! <U+017F>ayes <hi>Charite:</hi> It mu<U+017F>t then be when we play'd at St. <hi>Clou</hi> with the
Kitchin-maid. But what hurt have I done you? Have I <U+017F>cratch'd you, or prick'd
you with <U+017F>ome loo<U+017F>e pin, or have I trod on your foot? You are in the right on't,

You <U+017F>ee that my Lady here approves of what I <U+017F>ay; and that it will be to your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
renown, that you after my example have for<U+017F>aken the re<U+017F>idence of Cities:
You have begun well; but he does nothing, that fini<U+017F>hes not. Are you not re<U+017F>olved
that we buy each of us his Flock, and go keep them in the fields? There is no need
of that, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> I know there have been Courtiers have clad them<U+017F>elves as
Shepherds, yet never were ma<U+017F>ters of any <U+017F>heep: If they had been ask'd where their
Flocks were, they <U+017F>aid they had left it <U+017F>omwhere afar off in the cu<U+017F>tody of the dogs.
I do not believe that, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> <U+017F>hew it me written. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> by good fortune
light, on a <U+017F>ide-table, on <hi>Diana of Montemajor:</hi> where after he had turn'd over a
good many leaves, he <U+017F>hewed him that <hi>Delicio</hi> and <hi>Parthenio</hi> had put on Shepherds
weeds, without ever having any <U+017F>heep: And be<U+017F>ides all that, he cau<U+017F>ed him to call
to mind, that in <hi>A<U+017F>traea</hi> there were many Knights had done the like. Yet was he not
convinc'd; and his rea<U+017F>on was, that <U+017F>uch people were but half-Shepherds, and that
a man <U+017F>hould a<U+017F>pire to perfection; and that to avoid idlene<U+017F>s, 'twere good to have
the care and conduct of a Flock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montenor</hi> told them, that the difference was not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily decided; and that
his advice was, to have it referr'd to the arbitration of a Gentleman, a friend of his,
who was very expert in tho<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> asking him what his name was, <hi>Montenor</hi>
an<U+017F>wered, it was <hi>Clarimond,</hi> the Author of <hi>The Banquet of the Gods;</hi> and that it
were fit they went to him about it. Whereupon they took leave of <hi>Leonora</hi> and her
daughter, and of <hi>Orontes</hi> and <hi>Florida,</hi> who came in <U+017F>omwhat late, and were much
amaz'd at the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> Being gotten into the Coach, they drew towards
<hi>Clarimond's</hi> hou<U+017F>e, which was but a league off: And the Shepherd could not to
his mind expre<U+017F>s the content it was to him to go vi<U+017F>it a per<U+017F>on whom he imagin'd
of <U+017F>o extraordinary merit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> had a Ca<U+017F>tle, which being moted about was very hand<U+017F>om and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile:
But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> when he <U+017F>aw it, thought it better then it was; he call'd the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traves
Pillars, and the Corni<U+017F>hes Mil<U+017F>tones unpoli<U+017F>h'd, wherewith he <U+017F>aid it was built.
When they were come into the Court, an antient Gentlewoman, who was <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's</hi>
Mother, came out to receive them, and led them into the Hall, where they
were to <U+017F>tay for her <U+017F>on; who was gone abroad with his Peece, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
to return. She had a gla<U+017F>s of good fre<U+017F>h wine in the hou<U+017F>e; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
tho<U+017F>e who were come to <U+017F>ee him might be thir<U+017F>ty, <U+017F>he call'd for <U+017F>ome, and
caus'd to be brought in certain Sweet-meats. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> drank;
but when it came to the Shepherd, he refu<U+017F>ed. <hi>Clementia</hi> (that was the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans
name) de<U+017F>iring <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> might drink, went and took the gla<U+017F>s out of the
Maids hand, and pre<U+017F>ented him with it her <U+017F>elf. I will not by any means, <U+017F>ayes he:
You are deceiv'd in me, <hi><U+017F>age Felicia!</hi> I would rather <U+017F>wallow poi<U+017F>on, then take
your draught of oblivion. And with tho<U+017F>e words he runs out into the Court,
to the great a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment of all that were pre<U+017F>ent. They follow'd him thither
to <U+017F>ee what he would <U+017F>ay; and thereupon comes in <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who imbrac'd his
friend <hi>Montenor,</hi> and bid much welcome to the other two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clementia</hi> was extreamly troubled that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would not drink out of her
hand; and <U+017F>he thought it was out of <U+017F>ome fear he had that <U+017F>he might poi<U+017F>on him.
But her Son having brought them all back again into the Hall, and <U+017F>eated them,
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> waved the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and fell to complement with <hi>Clarimond,</hi> telling him
he <U+017F>hould be very glad of his acquaintance, his Works having made <U+017F>uch a good
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in him of his worth. Whereupon <hi>Montenor</hi> came, and <U+017F>poke of
<hi>THE BANQVET OF THE GODS,</hi> which he had divers
times read with great attention. And <hi>Clarimond</hi> fearing that Piece might not
give <U+017F>o generall <U+017F>atisfaction, whatever might be <U+017F>aid of it, <U+017F>poke to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e.</p>

            <p>I Have ob<U+017F>erved in the ancient <hi>Poetry</hi> <U+017F>o many <hi>ab<U+017F>urdities,</hi> which <U+017F>trike at all

<U+017F>omewhat might be built on them. But there is a perpetual wandring in
their ob<U+017F>curities, and I know not how it came to pa<U+017F>s, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> did not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h

in their <hi>Banquet,</hi> is irri<U+017F>ory and ridiculous; and yet you will finde, if you look nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
that I make them not guilty of any action, which may not be deduc'd out
of what others have <U+017F>aid of them. But if the ancient Poets were blamele<U+017F>s, how
much more are the modern, who are not blinded with Pagani<U+017F>me, and yet cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tain
mentioning the fained Deities, that were ador'd of old? I <U+017F>hall one day more

            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would give no long attention to this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, without replying, O how
art thou guilty of the blindene<U+017F>s which thou reproache<U+017F>t others with! <U+017F>ays he to
<hi>Clarimond.</hi> What! when thou finde<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome incomparable things in a Book, thou

Take notice, that when my Hi<U+017F>tory is written, it will be taken for a Fable,

            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> was much <U+017F>urpris'd at this <U+017F>ally; and <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> de<U+017F>irous to di<U+017F>cover

that all he hath <U+017F>poken, hath been by way of <hi>Paradox;</hi> he would <U+017F>hew his wit by
<U+017F>peaking again<U+017F>t the truth: But let us enter into <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Tell me
why you would not take the wine out of the Gentlewomans hand? 'Twas becau<U+017F>e
I thought my <U+017F>elf in the Palace of the <hi><U+017F>age Felicia,</hi> replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> <U+017F>he gave a drink
to <hi>Sirenus,</hi> to make him forget <hi>Diana;</hi> but whatever rigour <hi>Charite</hi> may exerci<U+017F>e
over me, I will ever adore her. Ah! unfaithful <hi>Sirenus!</hi> was it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible thou
could<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay tho<U+017F>e words which are written, and <U+017F>o finely couch'd in <hi>Montenor?
It may come to pa<U+017F>s, ingrateful Shepherde<U+017F>s, that thou <U+017F>halt <U+017F>eek me, when I <U+017F>hall
hide my <U+017F>elf from thee. O Jupiter!</hi> where are thy <hi>Thunderbolts?</hi> why are they
not hurl'd at the guilty head of this Shepherd? <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> taking him a<U+017F>ide, bid
him take heed what he <U+017F>aid; and that he was now in <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> and not in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Sirenus;</hi> and that be<U+017F>ides, he much wrong'd <hi>Clementia,</hi> to take her for a
Sorcere<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Clarimond</hi> much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at the Extravagancies of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
was acquainted by <hi>Montenor</hi> of what madne<U+017F>s he was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd. I have now
found what I have a long time <U+017F>ought after, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Clarimond:</hi> I vow to you, I
have us'd all the endeavours I could to infu<U+017F>e <hi>Romantick</hi> Imaginations into a
Per<U+017F>on I know, but he is now fallen into a <U+017F>ilent Madne<U+017F><U+017F>e: I believe your Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
is of a more Frolick humour. Be<U+017F>ides, it is not ami<U+017F><U+017F>e to encourage <U+017F>uch
people in their Imaginations; for by that means you rai<U+017F>e their mindes to the
highe<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ures. And thence comes that ordinary Saying, That to be happy
in the world, a man <U+017F>hould be either <hi>KING</hi> or <hi>FOOL;</hi> becau<U+017F>e if the
one have the greate<U+017F>t real Plea<U+017F>ures; the other hath the greate<U+017F>t Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
He therefore that cannot be <hi>KING,</hi> let him endeavour to become a
<hi>FOOL.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, <hi>Clarimond</hi> entreated the Company to <U+017F>tay Supper with
him; But <hi>Montenor</hi> told him, their comming to him was with the de<U+017F>igne to
carry him to Supper el<U+017F>ewhere; and his entreaties were <U+017F>o powerful, that they
made him leave his Mother. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having <U+017F>poken by the way, how his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

<hi>Charite.</hi> There you are deceiv'd your <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is, Love</hi> him<U+017F>elf hath nam'd her
<U+017F>o; and if <U+017F>he have any other name, it is only given her by the vulgar that know
not how they ought to <U+017F>peak.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charimond</hi> hearing this, began openly to abu<U+017F>e <hi>Ly<U+017F>is's</hi> Arithmetick: But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
he might give him occa<U+017F>ion to be angry, he abated to a fair compliance
with him. The Shepherd avow'd he was of a very plea<U+017F>ant humour; and that he
preferr'd a frolick and free di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, <U+017F>uch as his was, before another man's who
<U+017F>aid nothing, yet did not think the le<U+017F>s for it. Thereupon <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> ask'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in
what po<U+017F>ture his Loves were, and whether he thought him<U+017F>elf in the favour of
his <hi>Charite.</hi> He an<U+017F>wer'd, he was not far from it, and that it was the matter
and rea<U+017F>on of his cheerfulne<U+017F>s. But <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> returns to him in this manner: You
con<U+017F>ider not what you <U+017F>ay, Shepherd! For if your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s love you already, and
is ready to grant you what you <U+017F>hall demand, you will not have any brave occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to make appear your fidelity. This <U+017F>hould be your affliction; and it <U+017F>hould be
your de<U+017F>ire that <U+017F>he were <hi>cruel</hi> to you, that <U+017F>o there might happen to you <U+017F>ome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
adventures. Your rea<U+017F>on is very <U+017F>pecious, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but I fear me there
may be <U+017F>ome want of truth in it: Welcome is better then di<U+017F>dain, whatever may be
<U+017F>aid to the contrary. But you <U+017F>ee that <hi>A<U+017F>traea</hi> hath di<U+017F>dain'd <hi>Celadon,</hi> after <U+017F>he had
once loved him, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme;</hi> Do you hope to be better dealt with? What will
you advi<U+017F>e me to do then? <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> There is no doubt, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> but
that you <U+017F>hould ca<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elf, as he did, into the River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> at the lea<U+017F>t har<U+017F>h
word you <U+017F>hall receive from <hi>Charite.</hi> Let there be then three Nymphs on the <U+017F>hore
ready to take me out of the water, reply'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for what can I tell whether they'll
be there, if notice be not given them before-hand? I might be drown'd in the mean
time, for I cannot <U+017F>wim. It was out of a full intention to be drown'd, that <hi>Geladon</hi>
ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf into the water, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> Do you the like, and you <U+017F>hall be look'd
after: Faithfull Lovers never mi<U+017F>s relief; you <U+017F>ee <hi>Damon</hi> was <U+017F>av'd, and taken out
of a River. I will not tru<U+017F>t to that, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Let me have two Hogs-bladders
under my arms, and I will confidently ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf into <hi>Lignon.</hi> That's very wi<U+017F>ely
<U+017F>poken, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> but for my part, who am yet but an Apprentice in Love,
I will not pre<U+017F>ume to ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf into the water; I mu<U+017F>t leave that honour to my
Ma<U+017F>ter who is more knowing then <hi>I; I</hi> will not plunge my <U+017F>elf but in wine: And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43725:67"/>
now I think on't according to the <hi>Poets,</hi> it is only proper to the <hi>Sun</hi> to ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf
into the water: yet in the time of Vintage, they <U+017F>ay, he doth not lye down in the
Sea, but gets into one of the Fats of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Wine-pre<U+017F>s, where he treads the
Grapes, and that's the rea<U+017F>on he looks <U+017F>o red <U+017F>ometimes when he ri<U+017F>es. That's an
excellent imagination; well <U+017F>aid Shepherd, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> thou art worthy to be
my Comrade.</p>
            <p>Upon this Supper was ended, but <U+017F>o, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> fail'd not to perfect the number
of <U+017F>even, both in the fruits, and in drinking. That he was not drunk was, becau<U+017F>e
he drunk but <U+017F>mall Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es. The cloath being taken away, he went to the place
where the Gitarhe was, which <hi>Montenor</hi> had given him, and never con<U+017F>idering
whether it were in tune or no, he returns playing a <hi>Saraband.</hi> O God, cryes out <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
what do we hear? Hath <hi>Apollo</hi> committed <U+017F>ome new fault, that hath caus'd
<hi>Jupiter</hi> to bani<U+017F>h him out of heaven? Comes he once more hither among the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds?</hi>
Is it not the <U+017F>weet <U+017F>ound of his harp that tickles our ears? <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>taid a
good while, playing in the next Chamber to <hi>Montenors;</hi> being very proud they
took him for the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Mu<U+017F>ick,</hi> and thinking no le<U+017F>s then that he might ea<U+017F>ily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
others. <hi>Clarimond</hi> continued <U+017F>till to <U+017F>peak, and <U+017F>aid, Oh! I am ravi<U+017F>h'd I
am enchanted! O what Melody is this? I <U+017F>woun! <U+017F>ome vinegar here quickly to
comfort my heart. <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> made the like exclamations; but at length
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> appears to them laughing, and they gave him a thou<U+017F>and prai<U+017F>es for knowing
<U+017F>o well how to charm mens mindes by his harmony. Why have I not now <U+017F>ome
excellent Ayr? <U+017F>ays he: There is no other way but to compo<U+017F>e one, that <U+017F>hall
draw after me the mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible things. Tis fit I <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ently make <U+017F>ome ver<U+017F>es.
I <U+017F>hall be much more fortunate, having this in<U+017F>trument in my hand; for with the
<U+017F>ound of a Lute or Gittarhe the wandring <hi>Mu<U+017F>es</hi> are recollected, as the Bees are

            <p>This being agreed on, <hi>Clarimond</hi> bid <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> beware he made not <U+017F>uch imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

employ'd about it, there are Nymphs will take the charge on them here in <U+017F>ome

<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was already a-bed. The Shepherd would not <U+017F>uffer him to take any re<U+017F>t at

<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ri<U+017F>es, and awakens him by his running up and down the Chamber, and
crying out, I have found it, I have it, it is the be<U+017F>t humor of a Song that ever was.
I know what mea<U+017F>ure the Stanza's <U+017F>hall be of, and it <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>et to a better air then
ever <hi>Guedron</hi> was author of. Is there then no po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of <U+017F>leeping with you? <U+017F>ays
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> you have interrupted me in as fine a dream, as ever I dream'd And what
did<U+017F>t thou dream of? tell me, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> I dream'd that you were an <hi>A<U+017F>s,</hi> replyes
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> and that <hi>Charite</hi> was another, and that you were put into a Cart for to
draw it. This is <hi>Emblematical,</hi> replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> if the God <hi>Morpheus</hi> hath repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented

That might very well be, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> but you are not a <hi>Godde<U+017F>s,</hi> like that
of <hi>Apuleius:</hi> and if <hi>Apuleius</hi> under the likene<U+017F>s of an A<U+017F>s meant a man, you who
have a contrary de<U+017F>tiny, carry an A<U+017F>s in the likene<U+017F>s of a man. Whether it be <U+017F>o or
no, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> it matters not: but if thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>een <hi>Charite</hi> like a <U+017F>he A<U+017F>s, it is to
denote, <U+017F>he hath good ears, and that <U+017F>he very well hears my <U+017F>ighs. And if we were
drawing a cart: O happy pre<U+017F>age! 'tis to <U+017F>hew we <U+017F>hall be both <U+017F>ubject to the

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43725:68"/>
friend make an end of thy dream. I may <U+017F>leep again, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> but do you
think I can fa<U+017F>ten on the <U+017F>ame dream as I plea<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf? See whether you can do
it your <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>o accompli<U+017F>h what I have begun. Alas! I cannot, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi>
I mu<U+017F>t wake for to <U+017F>peak to the Mu<U+017F>es, who are not <U+017F>o liberal of their entertainments
when 'tis once hig-day, becau<U+017F>e they are a<U+017F>ham'd to be <U+017F>een <U+017F>peaking with men.
Certainly their cha<U+017F>tity is remarkable, not to come to men but in the night I replies
<hi>Clarimond.</hi> Do not jeer, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> what I <U+017F>ay is true: But there is another thing
hinders one from <U+017F>leeping; <hi>Love</hi> doth ever <U+017F>tand Sentinel on my bol<U+017F>ter with his
bow in hand, le<U+017F>t <hi>Sleep</hi> might enter into mine eyes: Before I can be overcome,
that Sentinel mu<U+017F>t be knock'd down. <hi>Clarimond</hi> return'd nothing to this, becau<U+017F>e
he would have a little re<U+017F>t: And <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> believing he would dream again, made no
noi<U+017F>e at all le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould awake him; by which means he had the opportunity to
<U+017F>leep a good while after.</p>
            <p>When he awoke, he found <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> quite dre<U+017F>s'd, very bu<U+017F>ie about his Ver<U+017F>es. He
had already deda<U+017F>h'd away above ten <U+017F>heets of paper, writing down a Stanza, and
then blotting it out to put another in <U+017F>tead, and then da<U+017F>hing out that to put down
the former. He had <U+017F>poil'd at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ix Pens, by biting them at the ends; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all the Stationers <U+017F>hops in the Country could not have furni<U+017F>h'd him, had he
been to compo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome heroick Poem. His nails were already gnawn to the very
<U+017F>tumps; and he put him<U+017F>elf into <U+017F>uch a diver<U+017F>ity of po<U+017F>tures in his imaginations, that
he was quite wearied out. <hi>Clarimond</hi> pittied him, ob<U+017F>erving that when he could
not light on the end of a Ver<U+017F>e to his mind, 'twas <U+017F>uch a vexation to him, that he
made more wry faces then a Cat that had <U+017F>wallow'd mu<U+017F>tard. Whereupon he ri<U+017F>e
pre<U+017F>ently; and having <U+017F>een in what forwardne<U+017F>s his work was, he reform'd what
was ami<U+017F>s, and gave him directions for to accompli<U+017F>h the whole peece. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
promi<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf all the credit, though he had been willing to be a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted; for

               <hi>Montenor</hi> <U+017F>aid he was <U+017F>omwhat in doubt whether the <U+017F>o often repeating the word
<hi>Charite</hi> was not a fault. But he was an<U+017F>wer'd, that it was very elegant; and that he
that did not acknowledge it, was no good Judge. To which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> added, that that a
name was the faire<U+017F>t ornament of his Ver<U+017F>es; and that he thought one time to make
Stanza wherein there <U+017F>hould be nothing el<U+017F>e. As for <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> he admir'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu<U+017F>ion,
which indeed was not to be found fault with, for there <U+017F>eem'd to be a many
Eccho's repeating the complaints of a Lover. But the <hi>Shepherd</hi> was wi<U+017F>e enough
not to di<U+017F>cover that the de<U+017F>ign came from <hi>Clarimond.</hi> That which was conceiv'd
mo<U+017F>t cen<U+017F>urable, was, that the Shepherd had no cau<U+017F>e to make any <U+017F>uch complaint.
To which he an<U+017F>wer'd, that never any Lover, <U+017F>uch as he, could be without affliction;
and if he feign'd him<U+017F>elf dead, 'twas only to move <hi>Charite</hi> to <U+017F>uccour him. Do you
not <U+017F>ee that all things have compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on me? <U+017F>ays he: Nature her<U+017F>elf believes not
I am alive; the Heaven is to day all dark, it is becau<U+017F>e it mourns for my departure.
Not to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, there is no <U+017F>uch matter, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> But you Gentlemen of
the Tribe of Poets never denominate your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>favourable,</hi> or <hi>cruel</hi>
and <hi>rigorous,</hi> but according as one of the<U+017F>e words is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to make up the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or rhime of your Ver<U+017F>es: And when your thoughts are taken up about <U+017F>ome
<hi>favour</hi> done, that they might hit right, it's a <U+017F>mall matter with you to call the Ladies
<hi>ungratefull.</hi> So that it may be <U+017F>aid, they are whatever you are pleas'd they
<U+017F>hould be.</p>
            <p>The amorous <hi>Shepherd</hi> return'd nothing to this railing, for he heeded it not, his
mind being taking up to con<U+017F>ider of an aire for his Song. He at la<U+017F>t made up one
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43725:69"/>
with the beginning and end of two other ayrs which he knew before, and yet he
conceiv'd there was nothing of all this which came not from him<U+017F>elf. When he had
<U+017F>ung it, all confe<U+017F>s'd it was admirable; and becau<U+017F>e it was pretty late, they went to
dinner. <hi>Clarimond</hi> a while after, went his ways, <U+017F>aying, that <U+017F>ome dome<U+017F>tick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
call'd him away, and that his good mother would conclude him lo<U+017F>t, if he did
not return in <U+017F>ome time. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> remembring him<U+017F>elf, that he had not yet <U+017F>een the
Shepherds of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> becau<U+017F>e his Loves had <U+017F>till diverted him, entreated <hi>Montenor</hi>
to bring him acquainted with them. They are no le<U+017F>s then two leagues off this
place, replyes <hi>Montenor,</hi> I am not now at lea<U+017F>ure to go <U+017F>o far: If you will not
go along with me, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I'll leave you pre<U+017F>ently and go my wayes: how
will you have me <U+017F>pend my time here? <U+017F>tudy your Song, <U+017F>ays <hi>Montenor,</hi> that <U+017F>o you
may not be <U+017F>urpris'd in any thing you do. There indeed you are in the right replyes
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that's a thing of no <U+017F>mall con<U+017F>equence.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he went and lock'd him<U+017F>elf into his chamber, being all alone with
his Gitarrhe, and would do nothing the remainder of that day, but learn the air of
his Song. In the mean time <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> went a hunting: when they
were return'd, he came to Supper with them, which being done, he entreated <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elme</hi>
to lend him one of his Lacquays to go with him as far as <hi>Charite's</hi> hou<U+017F>e. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elme</hi>
having given him permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to take which he would of them, he would not
take <hi>Gringalet,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he began to di<U+017F>cover he was too much a Wag: He cho<U+017F>e
<hi>Champagne</hi> his fellow Lacquay, who was a great Lad, and one whom he thought
tractable enough: <U+017F>o having taken leave of the company, he took him along, not
forgetting his Gitarhe; for his de<U+017F>ign was in good earne<U+017F>t to give his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renade.
An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> would not take the pains to follow him, nor indeed
was it his de<U+017F>ire they <U+017F>hould, as having no need of <U+017F>o many witne<U+017F><U+017F>es. The way
<U+017F>eem'd not to him either long or tedious: <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon did he recover <hi>Oronte's</hi> hou<U+017F>e,
where having put his Gitarhe in tune, he began to play, and withal <U+017F>ung his air. His
mu<U+017F>ick was <U+017F>o good, that <hi>Champagne,</hi> who might well be ranked among the duller
<U+017F>ort of people, was not much taken with it. There was <U+017F>uch a con<U+017F>ort between his
voyce and his in<U+017F>trument, as made a mu<U+017F>ick as delightful as the braying of an A<U+017F>s
would do, with the noi<U+017F>e of the wheel of a mill. But the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>port was, that for
to feign a <hi>Syncope,</hi> he de<U+017F>cended by degrees, that at la<U+017F>t he <U+017F>ung <U+017F>o low, that he could
not be heard. The air being fini<U+017F>h'd, he plaid certain Sarabands, with which his
<U+017F>ighes bear a part, and at every <U+017F>hake he fetch'd one from the bottom of his brea<U+017F>t.
Notwith<U+017F>tanding all this, he was <U+017F>o far unfortunate, that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s heard no more
of this <hi>Serenade,</hi> then <U+017F>he had done of that at St. <hi>Cloud;</hi> and there were only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
dogs, who by their noi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cover'd their attention to this mu<U+017F>ick As for his
own part, he was not <U+017F>o taken up in what he did him<U+017F>elf, but that he heard the touch
of a Late the other <U+017F>ide of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e. Follow me <hi>Champagne,</hi> <U+017F>aies he to the
Lacquay, here is <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ignal adventure pre<U+017F>ents it <U+017F>elf. When he had <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he
drew nigh the place where they had heard the Lute; but then they heard it, as if it
been farther off: and the more they came forward, the more did it <U+017F>eem to draw back.
At length having pa<U+017F>s'd through a many trees, they came into a field, where they
<U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome body going before them, but could not di<U+017F>cern who it was. They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
it lea<U+017F>urely, till it entred a little wood, towards which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ran as fa<U+017F>t as he
could: Ha! <hi>Champagne,</hi> <U+017F>aies he, 'Tis an <hi>Hamadryad</hi> that we <U+017F>aw but now; it was
come out of this Wood, to give my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s a Serenade as well as I. Now it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to its re<U+017F>idence again: we mu<U+017F>t needs follow it, to give it thanks for this
courte<U+017F>ie. <hi>Champagne</hi> <U+017F>aid it was time to return home, that they <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>pend
their time <U+017F>o vainly; and that he might go into the Wood as far as he pleas'd, but
that for his part, he was content to <U+017F>tay for him at the entrance. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hearing that,
flung him<U+017F>elf immediately into a hedge, which though it were <U+017F>omewhat thick <U+017F>et,
yet with much ado he made his way through. He heard the Lute <U+017F>till, <U+017F>o that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from one <U+017F>ide to the other through the trees, he thought at length to finde the
<hi>Hamadryad;</hi> but when he could hear nothing at all, he began to cry out, Whither
do you run away from me? fair Nymph, 'tis not for to do you any violence, that I am
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43725:70"/>
come hither: alas! my affections are engag'd el<U+017F>ewhere. Wherefore do you hide
your <U+017F>elf from me? come and bear a part in mu<U+017F>ick with me: Are you already lock'd
up within your bark? While he made tho<U+017F>e complaints, he had <U+017F>o travell'd up and
down the Wood, that <hi>Champagne</hi> could not hear him. He call'd him divers times, but
<U+017F>eeing he an<U+017F>wered not, and that it were a folly to look after him in the dark, he
return'd to <hi>Montenors,</hi> to whom he gave an account of his lo<U+017F>s. He was much
blam'd by his Ma<U+017F>ter, who made no plea<U+017F>ure of any misfortunes that hapned to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi>
Yet it was conceiv'd it would be no hard matter to finde him again, if there were but
any <U+017F>earch made for him the next morning. In the mean time, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being as much
troubled as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could be, embrac'd all the trees he met with, and asked them
tidings of the Nymph he had lo<U+017F>t. After he had thus employed him<U+017F>elf an hour or
two, he came among a <U+017F>ort of thorns &amp; briars, beyond which he perceiv'd the fields.
He thought to finde <hi>Champagne</hi> there <U+017F>till, for the time had <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort to him
that he imagin'd he had not been in the Wood above half a quarter of an hour.
When he <U+017F>aw it was to no purpo<U+017F>e to call, and that the other an<U+017F>wered not, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pair'd
not to return alone; but he was <U+017F>o far from knowing the way, that he went
far enough out of it, and for <U+017F>ome two hours follow'd certain unknown pathes. At
length wearine<U+017F>s forc'd him to ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf into a Thicket, where he re<U+017F>ted till day,
When the Sun had darted on his eyes, and oblig'd him to open them, he breaks
forth, and <U+017F>ayes, O how well have I pa<U+017F>s'd this night, methinks, better to my minde
then on a Feather bed! O how fine a thing it is to ri<U+017F>e at a <U+017F>tart, without having any
occa<U+017F>ion of a man to help me on with my cloathes! O what a plea<U+017F>ant adventure
have I gone through! and what a truly <hi>Romantick</hi> thing it is to lie on the hard
<hi>ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the end of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he went out of the thicket, and having his Gittarh
<U+017F>till in his hand, he be<U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf to play, to <U+017F>alute the new day, and conform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
to the birds, who were already warbling their notes. He went on <U+017F>till, till he
came to a little Hamlet, where keeping <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame po<U+017F>ture, he <U+017F>till <U+017F>crub'd over
certain tunes. There were five or <U+017F>ix children at a door, who ran after him <U+017F>inging
divers tunes, and pull'd <U+017F>o much at his coat, that he was fain to <U+017F>tay, and play be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them to buy his quiet, and appea<U+017F>e them. There was one among them, went
and told his mother, that he had heard mu<U+017F>ick; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he thinking it had been
<U+017F>ome poor Lad, that went from hou<U+017F>e to hou<U+017F>e to play before children, carried him
a piece of bread and chee<U+017F>e. He was <U+017F>o hungry, that he could not refu<U+017F>e what was
pre<U+017F>ented, and having eaten it up, he drank at a little fountain in his way.</p>
            <p>Thence he thought it was his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to go <U+017F>eek out the Shepherds of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi>
then to return to <hi>Montenors,</hi> <U+017F>eeing he would not bring him to them. Now there
was very little pa<U+017F>ture-grounds in that quarter; he met not <U+017F>o much as with any
Shepherds of the Countrey; and for what other people came in his way, they were
only Carters, whom he vouch<U+017F>afed not to trouble him<U+017F>elf with, though they lookt
upon him with admiration. When he <U+017F>aw any little hill, he was impatient till he came
to the top, to <U+017F>ee what was beyond it; and if a thicket came in his way, he mu<U+017F>t al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o
go through that, to <U+017F>ee what were behinde. At la<U+017F>t he meets a <hi>Hermite,</hi> who
walk'd along a hedge <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>aying his <hi>Breviary.</hi> He pre<U+017F>ently imagin'd him to be a
<hi>Druid,</hi> and making a low reverence to him, Father, <U+017F>aies he, do me the favour as
to tell me whether I am yet very far from the pa<U+017F>tures where <hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>traea</hi>
feed their flocks. The <hi>Hermite,</hi> who never had read any <hi>Romance,</hi> an<U+017F>wers him,
That he knew not tho<U+017F>e people he named. But tell me, whence come you with your
rebeck? Let us look out for a place to <U+017F>it down, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and you <U+017F>hall have
my hi<U+017F>tory:</p>
            <p>Father (continues he, being <U+017F>ate on a hillock with the <hi>Hermite)</hi> the <hi>I<U+017F>le of
France</hi> is my Country. In the<U+017F>e parts, <hi>Montenor</hi> is my entertainer, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> my
friend, <hi>Charite</hi> my enemy. It is true, there is <U+017F>ome <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s in her enmity, and I
was in hope the la<U+017F>t night to have charm'd her with the <U+017F>weet <U+017F>ound of my Gitarhe.
You know that the nights are <U+017F>o quiet, that there is nothing heard but the winds, and
the noi<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>prings, nor had I any thought to violate their their ordinary <U+017F>ilence;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43725:70"/>
for I have been the cau<U+017F>e of no noi<U+017F>e, but that of my <U+017F>ighs, and that of the fountain
of my tears. I have lain on no other bed then that which nature afforded me: And
<hi>Aurora,</hi> who is a very charitable Lady, <U+017F>eeing me this morning, had compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on
me; <U+017F>he wept very much, and 'tis not to be thought it was for the death of her <U+017F>on.
The <hi>Hermite,</hi> who was not guilty of much <U+017F>tudy, apprehended nothing of this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e;
all he could pick out of it was, that he thought it well done to lie on the
ground for to mortifie the fle<U+017F>h. He was forc'd to <U+017F>ay to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that above all things
he was de<U+017F>irous to know what profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion he was of. All my employment is to <hi>love,</hi>
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> if I <hi>write,</hi> if I make <hi>ver<U+017F>es,</hi> if I <hi>walk,</hi> if I <hi>meditate,</hi> all is for to learn
how to <hi>love</hi> well. You are a happy man, <U+017F>ays the Hermite, if <U+017F>o be you love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Divinity: If you will <U+017F>erve that, <U+017F>tay with me and take the habit of
Monk, we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>pend the re<U+017F>t of our days with much plea<U+017F>ure together: Nor indeed
can I think otherwi<U+017F>e then that you are a Vagabond, and that it were better you
had <U+017F>ome retreat. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> di<U+017F>covering by this that he had to do with an <hi>Hermite,</hi> <U+017F>aid
to him, Know, Father, that I have found the true tranquility of life. 'Tis true,
there are many which turn <hi>Monks,</hi> to withdraw from the vanities of the world:
but I have cho<U+017F>en another condition wherein there is a like felicity: I am turn'd
<hi>Shepherd</hi> not long <U+017F>ince, do you not <U+017F>ee I have taken the <hi>habit?</hi> To tell you no lye,
when my friends <U+017F>aw me take it, they endeavoured as much to make me quit it again,
as if they had <U+017F>een me enter'd among the bare-leg'd <hi>Carmelites;</hi> but all their cryes
have been to no purpo<U+017F>e. Whereupon the Hermite told him, that his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e
were to follow his fir<U+017F>t inclination, if <U+017F>o be it were not ill: however, to <U+017F>hew him
where he <U+017F>pent his life, he led him to his Cell, which was very well accommodated.
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having drank <U+017F>ome wine out of his begging-jack, de<U+017F>ired him to <U+017F>hew him the
right way to <hi>Montenor's;</hi> becau<U+017F>e that meeting no body that could bring him to
the Shepherds of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> he was re<U+017F>olved to go back thither. The Hermite told him
it was above nine miles to the hou<U+017F>e he ask'd for, and that he <U+017F>hould make ha<U+017F>te if
he had a mind to recover it before night. Thereupon <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> took leave of the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,
a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him that if he had not been a <hi>Shepherd</hi> he would have been a <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi>
and promi<U+017F>ing he would endeavour to <U+017F>ee him again one time or other. He
follow'd a great road that he had <U+017F>hew'd him; and as he went along he did nothing
but meditate on this la<U+017F>t adventure. He was <U+017F>omwhat <U+017F>orry he had not <U+017F>taid with
the Hermite, becau<U+017F>e it came into his imagination that he under<U+017F>tood Magick, and
that he could have taught him many <U+017F>ecrets.</p>
            <p>He had not gone five miles, but he came to the Wood where he had look'd for
the <hi>Hamadryad;</hi> but he knew not it was the <U+017F>ame. It belong'd to one called <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
who at the end of it had a hou<U+017F>e. This Gentleman was a great friend of <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's:</hi>
who returning from <hi>Montenor's</hi> hou<U+017F>e, had met him and acquainted him
with the excellent humour of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> He therefore having had notice that the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
was to give <hi>Charite</hi> a Serenade, would needs give her one too, and was come
to play on the Lute before <hi>Oronte's</hi> hou<U+017F>e at the <U+017F>ame time.</p>
            <p>It began to grow dark when <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> enter'd the Wood; <U+017F>o that not being able to
<U+017F>ee much, a certain fear <U+017F>eiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d his <U+017F>oul. Is not this Wood con<U+017F>ecrated to <U+017F>ome God!
<U+017F>aid he in him<U+017F>elf: Behold here is a place <U+017F>o de<U+017F>ert, that no body comes into it, if
he be not out of his way: Never any Shepherd nor Gra<U+017F>ier enter'd it, and there was
never heard the noi<U+017F>e of an axe in it: I dare not <U+017F>o much as lean again<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e bu<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<U+017F>uch is my fear they may lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome of their leafs, and that I commit <U+017F>o many
murthers.</p>
            <p>He advanc'd <U+017F>till with much re<U+017F>pect, till he perceiv'd <hi>Hircan,</hi> who was walking in
an Alley with a wand in his hand. He pre<U+017F>ently believ'd he was a Magician that
dwelt there; and making him a low conge, he <U+017F>ays to him, I crave your pardon
that I am come to di<U+017F>turb your <U+017F>olitude: Had you not de<U+017F>ired I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>een
you, you might have employ'd your Art to hinder my entrance into this Wood:
But I believe you are content I <U+017F>hould come before you, <U+017F>eeing you have permitted
it, and I hope you'll give me leave to addre<U+017F>s my vows to the Divinities which you
adore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:43725:71"/>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> hearing this, knew pre<U+017F>ently he was the man that <hi>Clarimond</hi> had given
him a character of; and being very glad of this rencontre, told him he might freely
come on any place that belong'd to him, even into his hou<U+017F>e, which was ever open
to per<U+017F>ons of merit.</p>
            <p>I am then to give my thanks to the <hi>De<U+017F>tiny</hi> that hath brought me hither, replies
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> A poor Lover, as I am, may receive much a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from <U+017F>uch a man as you;
you know the properties of herbs and <U+017F>tones, and by your Magick you afford reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to all that are afflicted. <hi>Hircan</hi> perceiving by this, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> took him for an
Enchanter, would continue him in that opinion, and an<U+017F>wered him thus: You are
not deceiv'd, if you believe that nothing is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to my charms: When the
Moon is ecclip<U+017F>ed, it is I that have drawn her from heaven for to lie with me; and
of the cha<U+017F>te<U+017F>t of all the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es I make my Concubine: I caus'd one morning
<U+017F>uch an Earthquake, that all the pots and kettles were overturn'd, and all manner of
hou<U+017F>hold<U+017F>tuff was turn'd top<U+017F>ie-turvie: Sometimes I <U+017F>tay the Rivers, and hinder
them to pay their tribute to the Sea: I root up the Trees of the Forre<U+017F>t as ea<U+017F>ily as
a Labourer plucks up the <U+017F>talks of corn; and if I have <U+017F>ome me<U+017F><U+017F>age to <U+017F>end any
where, I command the Spirits as I do my Lacquays. You <U+017F>hall not be de<U+017F>ired to
do <U+017F>o great things for me, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> nor do I de<U+017F>ire you <U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e the Trees
of my neighbour to remove into my ground, nor that you give the <U+017F>cab to the <U+017F>heep
of my Rival: All I de<U+017F>ire to know, is, whether my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s loves me or no, and
whether I <U+017F>hall one day receive the <U+017F>atisfaction of my wi<U+017F>hes. Come, you <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>up with me, Shepherd! replies <hi>Hircan</hi> to him: We'll con<U+017F>ider of tho<U+017F>e things
hereafter.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, he led him into his Ca<U+017F>tle; which was <U+017F>o well built, that the
Shepherd imagin'd it had been the workman<U+017F>hip of the Spirits, as the Palace of
<hi>Armida.</hi> So that he was fully <U+017F>atisfied that this was no counterfeit Magician, <U+017F>uch
as <hi>Clemantes</hi> was who deceiv'd <hi>Galathea. Hircan</hi> was a very loo<U+017F>e per<U+017F>on, and
had then with him a very hand<U+017F>om Gentlewoman that he entertain'd for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure.
He made <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> believe <U+017F>he was a Nymph of the waters, that he had con<U+017F>train'd
by his charms to come and live in his Ca<U+017F>tle. When <U+017F>he had been told of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the per<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he would needs make <U+017F>ome <U+017F>port with him. Being at table
only they three, <U+017F>he <U+017F>till ca<U+017F>t on him <U+017F>uch langui<U+017F>hing and amorous looks, as if <U+017F>he
had been deeply in love with him. Whenever he perceiv'd it, he bow'd down his
head as a ba<U+017F>hfull Girl, and dur<U+017F>t not look on her. After <U+017F>upper, <hi>Hircan</hi> left him
with her, <U+017F>aying he would go into his Study to con<U+017F>ult with the Spirits about his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s.
She talk'd with him about divers things; but chiefly <U+017F>he was inqui<U+017F>itive to
know certain particularities of his Loves, which he reckoned up to her with much
mode<U+017F>ty. The Magician being return'd, told him, that all he could di<U+017F>cover was,
that by per<U+017F>everance he <U+017F>hould overcome <hi>Charite:</hi> but that thence-forward he
<U+017F>hould find it a hard matter to come to her, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Leonora</hi> kept her very clo<U+017F>e.
There is a remedy for that, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I will di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf to go and <U+017F>ee her:
Cannot you by your art give me <U+017F>ome other form then what I have, and <U+017F>o render
me <U+017F>uch as I may not be known? I will con<U+017F>ider to night what face you <U+017F>hall take,
replies <hi>Hircan:</hi> Set your heart at re<U+017F>t, and to to bed where I have appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> went his way cheerfully to bed full of great hopes; and the next morning
the Conjurer coming to him caus'd him to put his head into a pail of water, while
he mumbled certain barbarous words over him; which when he had done, he <U+017F>aid
to him, A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf that you are now like a hand<U+017F>om Country-wench: You
have now no more to do, but to go immediately to <hi>Leonora;</hi> I know <U+017F>he wants a
Maid, doubt not but <U+017F>he'll take you, and by that means you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee <hi>Charite</hi> when
you will, and enjoy all the plea<U+017F>ure in the world. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having a confidence in this,
went down into the Kitchin: All the Servants had the watchword given them,
What would you, fair Maid! <U+017F>ays one; whence come you? Another by way of
abu<U+017F>e, <U+017F>wore he would willingly give his old breeches for her maidenhead. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
was out of him<U+017F>elf for joy at this; and runs laughing to <hi>Hircan,</hi> for to give him
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43725:71"/>
the commendations of his art. He was <U+017F>o impatient, that he took leave of him and
the <hi>aquatick Nymph;</hi> and taking a Lacquay for his guide, took his way to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
hou<U+017F>e. He was not gone fifty paces from the hou<U+017F>e, but he meets a Countrey wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
being de<U+017F>irous to try whether <U+017F>he took him for a maid, he went and made
her a low courte<U+017F>ie; and <U+017F>aid to her, with a counterfeit voyce, Good morrow Go<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ip!
pray <U+017F>hew me the way to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Ca<U+017F>tle, I am a poor maid out of my way.
Truly (an<U+017F>wers the Countrey woman grumbling) I would not <U+017F>uch a maid lay a
night with my daughter, I <U+017F>hould fear <U+017F>he might bring me more. What! you
have no compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on tho<U+017F>e of your own <U+017F>ex, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I pray <U+017F>hew me the way,
this Lad knows it not; mark what may happen, if I come not <U+017F>oon to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s:
I may be met by Shepherds, or Swineherds, or it may be by <hi>Satyrs,</hi> and then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
the flower of my virginity.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Lacquay laughing, told the woman, that it was a maid that he
conducted: but <U+017F>he grew a little angry, and pur<U+017F>uing her way, told them, they were
affronters, and bid them make <U+017F>port with <U+017F>ome other. The Shepherd <U+017F>eeing this, knew
that the charm of <hi>Hircan</hi> was not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong as he had conceiv'd, but he pre<U+017F>ently
bethought him, that it was his own fault, becau<U+017F>e he had <U+017F>till mans cloathes on,
which had not been chang'd with his body: <U+017F>o that he would needs return to the
Magician for <U+017F>ome remedy. He told him what he thought of it; and <hi>Hircan</hi> a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ur'd
him, that when he had maids cloathes on, he might a great deal better deceive
the world then in a mans. The watery Nymph was thereupon call'd for to dre<U+017F>s
him. He put off all to his drawers, which done, <U+017F>he put on him an under-petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,
and on that a green coat, and a gray wa<U+017F>tcoat, and coiff'd him after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hion
of <hi>Brie.</hi> She <U+017F>ighed <U+017F>o deeply in dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him, that the Shepherd could not
but ask her what <U+017F>he ailed. Alas! I ail nothing, <U+017F>aies <U+017F>he, but that though I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
your <U+017F>weet company, yet you for<U+017F>ake me to go to a Bitch, a Tygre<U+017F>s, and a
<U+017F>he-Wolf. Ah me! what <U+017F>ay you, <hi>Synopaz</hi> (replies the Shepherd, who imagin'd
<U+017F>he was <U+017F>o called) take heed the heavens puni<U+017F>h you not; for my part I excu<U+017F>e you,
it is not you that <U+017F>peak, but Rage and Jealou<U+017F>ie.</p>
            <p>By this time he was quite ready, and <hi>Hircan</hi> having brought a looking-gla<U+017F>s, he
beheld him<U+017F>elf therein, and cry'd out through exce<U+017F>s of joy, O God! it is impo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
more to re<U+017F>emble a Shepherde<U+017F>s then I do: Here's nothing left of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but a <U+017F>oft down that <U+017F>hadows my chin. That's not much, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
there are many women have more beard then that, and among others, my own
Kitchin-maid. However, let it be taken off, if you will. It is not to be much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at, if I have a little, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> for 'tis three years <U+017F>ince that a golden fleece
hath adorn'd my face; though it might be very decent, yet I have <U+017F>horn it once
in eight days, and have rub'd me every morning with a pumice <U+017F>tone, to hinder it
to grow, that I might <U+017F>eem the younger; but particularly, to be ready to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e
my <U+017F>elf like a maid, when there <U+017F>hould be any occa<U+017F>ion, as I have ever had a de<U+017F>ire
to do. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, <hi>Hircan's</hi> man took off what hair was on his chin. Then
did he believe, that his change of cloathes, together with the charm, was enough
to deceive all the world. Be<U+017F>ides that, <hi>Hircan</hi> told him, he would be at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
while he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>peaking to <hi>Leonora,</hi> to per<U+017F>wade her to take him into her <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
He pre<U+017F>ently took hor<U+017F>e, to be there the <U+017F>ooner, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in the mean time
took his time to go thither, with his former guide. <hi>Hircan</hi> being come to <hi>Orontes,</hi>
told him the plea<U+017F>ant adventure had hapned to him. <hi>Florida, Leonora,</hi> and <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica</hi>
were al<U+017F>o acquainted with it, and were impatient to <U+017F>ee the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphos'd
into a maid: So all that were pre<U+017F>ent being in a good humor, they
re<U+017F>olved to entertain him for to pa<U+017F>s away the time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being on his way, bethought him what name he <U+017F>hould take. There was
none <U+017F>eem'd more gentle, and more pa<U+017F>toral to him, then <hi>Amarillis,</hi> <U+017F>o that he
took that; and when he view'd him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ometimes in his Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es habit, he
<U+017F>aid in him<U+017F>elf, No, no, there is no <U+017F>hame to put on this garb, when <hi>Love</hi> commands
it. The great <hi>Alcides</hi> chang'd his <hi>club</hi> into a <hi>di<U+017F>taff,</hi> and put on <hi>Joles</hi> gown in<U+017F>tead
of his Lyons skin. Was not <hi>Poliarchus</hi> cloath'd like a maid, and was called <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crine?</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:43725:72"/>
and did not <hi>Celadon</hi> do the like, and was called <hi>Alexis?</hi> This is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<U+017F>ubject of <hi>Romances,</hi> and an amorous hi<U+017F>tory is never good, if there be not a
young man puts on maids cloathes; or a maid a mans. I appeal to all tho<U+017F>e who
pa<U+017F>s away their days in that delightful reading. I would to God <hi>Charite</hi> would
imitate me, and put on the habit of my <U+017F>ex, as I have put on that of hers. Then
mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>he pretend to love me, and if we were married, the change of cloaths would
not deceive any body; all would be very well.</p>
            <p>In the mid<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e noble thoughts, the di<U+017F>guis'd Shepherd came to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
hou<U+017F>e; and having ask'd to <U+017F>peak with <hi>Leonora,</hi> he was carried into the hall, where
<U+017F>he was, together with the re<U+017F>t of the Company. <hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>tood up pre<U+017F>ently, and
<U+017F>aid to her, <hi>Madam,</hi> here is a maid wants a <U+017F>ervice, <U+017F>he is a kin<U+017F>woman of my far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
wife; if you will take her, I will be accountable for her true <U+017F>ervice. <hi>Leonora</hi>
bid her draw near, and <U+017F>triving as much as <U+017F>he could to refrain laughing, ask'd her
what <U+017F>he could do. <hi>Amarillis</hi> promis'd to do any thing was commanded her with
a little <U+017F>hewing. I <U+017F>ee well, <U+017F>aies <hi>Leonora,</hi> how the ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>tands, this maid is not good
for the Chamber, nor for the Kitchin, but may <U+017F>erve to do <U+017F>omewhat every where.
What <U+017F>ay you as to wages? you need not think of that, replies <hi>Hircan,</hi> you <U+017F>hall
reward her according as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall have <U+017F>erved you: So <hi>Leonora</hi> re<U+017F>olved to take this
fine <U+017F>ervant, who pre<U+017F>ently told her name, whereat tho<U+017F>e that were pre<U+017F>ent could
not any longer forbear laughing. As for <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> <U+017F>he look'd like a <U+017F>car-crow in
a Hemp-yard. Her back was long and flat, as if <U+017F>he had carried a flat basket on it,
and for her brea<U+017F>t, it was no more plump then a Trencher; the re<U+017F>t was <U+017F>treight,
as if it had been a di<U+017F>taff <U+017F>wadled about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> being gone away, they gave <hi>Amarillis</hi> divers things to do, which <U+017F>he
did as well as any other <U+017F>hould have done. She laid the cloath, rin<U+017F>ed the gla<U+017F><U+017F>es,
and made clean the chambers, and all with <U+017F>uch mode<U+017F>ty, that all wonder'd at it.
The fair one dur<U+017F>t not as much as lift up her eyes, and when <U+017F>he was at dinner with
the men, <U+017F>he would have been very much out of countenance, had it not been
that there were other maids as well as <U+017F>he, and e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Charite,</hi> whom <U+017F>he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
con<U+017F>idered and view'd. The men and maids knew all that it was <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but
they were expre<U+017F>ly forbidden to di<U+017F>cover that they knew any thing, nor to call her
by any other name then <hi>Amarillis;</hi> <U+017F>o that le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he might betray any thing, there
was but little <U+017F>poken to her.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon came thither <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor,</hi> who had <U+017F>ent their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
all about to look for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> of whom not having receiv'd any tidings, they were
come to <hi>Leonora,</hi> to have <U+017F>ome news of him. She told them, that <U+017F>he had not <U+017F>een
him, and thereupon call'd <hi>Amarillis,</hi> to bid her do <U+017F>omewhat. As <U+017F>oon as they
<U+017F>aw her, they were <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpris'd, that they <U+017F>aid not a word, but when <U+017F>he was gone,
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> cryes out, well Madam, if that be not <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> it is a Maid extreamly like
him. <hi>Leonora</hi> told him, he was not mi<U+017F>taken, and acquainted him what adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
the Shepherd had run through at <hi>Hircans</hi> the Magician. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleas'd at the narration, and went into a Chamber where <hi>Amarillis</hi> was. She
made as if <U+017F>he knew him not, nor did <U+017F>he di<U+017F>cover her <U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o that he left her, and
be<U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf to talk with <hi>Angelica.</hi> About an hour after came <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
whom he had <U+017F>ent for; then was the time come, that they re<U+017F>olved to make
good <U+017F>port with the new maid. <hi>Clarimond</hi> made it his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to play tricks with
her, and would have ki<U+017F>t her. She thru<U+017F>t him back <U+017F>till as hard as <U+017F>he could; but that
which mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cover'd her was that <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>ufficiently counterfeit her <U+017F>peech,
and in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>peaking like a <U+017F>imple Country wench, <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke a quaint Court
phra<U+017F>e. Let me alone <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he, at every word, I would be touch'd no more then if
I were a ve<U+017F>tal. Be quiet, you would ravi<U+017F>h me; have you any attempt on the
Candor of my Cha<U+017F>tity, and would <U+017F>ee the wack of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el of my Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency.</p>
            <p>Sometimes <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke of her <U+017F>elf in the ma<U+017F>culine gender, in<U+017F>tead of the feminine,
yet no body <U+017F>eem'd to take any notice. <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>et on her <U+017F>till with fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements,
in which he call'd her his <hi>Godde<U+017F>s</hi> and his <hi>Nymph:</hi> They could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43725:72"/>
laughing to <U+017F>ee that he gave <U+017F>uch qualities to a Wench <U+017F>o ill dre<U+017F>t; and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi>
ask'd whether the Nymphs wore coifs? You need not doubt but there are
<U+017F>ome that do, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> for they are ever dre<U+017F>t according to the fa<U+017F>hion of the
Countrey where they re<U+017F>ide. That's the rea<U+017F>on that tho<U+017F>e of the river of <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and tho<U+017F>e of the River <hi>Seine</hi> wear french<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
after the <hi>Paris</hi> fa<U+017F>hion.</p>
            <p>There pa<U+017F>t divers other plea<U+017F>ant di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es on the like occa<U+017F>ions; but all this was
not much; for they conceiv'd they might have made much more <U+017F>port with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillis:</hi>
yet they made as nothing were, and tho<U+017F>e who were not of the hou<U+017F>e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
every one to his own home, leaving <hi>Leonora</hi> and her new maid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amarillis</hi> pa<U+017F>s'd over four days with all the <U+017F>atisfaction in the world. They had
a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd her a little chamber, where <U+017F>he lay alone, and never went out before <U+017F>he was
fully dre<U+017F>s'd by a gla<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had. Though <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke not to <hi>Charite,</hi> but as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ordinary <U+017F>ervant, yet <U+017F>he thought the heavens very favorable to her, that <U+017F>he
had the opportunity to <U+017F>ee her when <U+017F>he pleas'd. <hi>Leonora</hi> was not weary of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, for <U+017F>he took a plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ee with what diligence <U+017F>he <U+017F>erved her; and on
the other <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he fear'd not any ill report might come to her hou<U+017F>e by her means:
She was of tho<U+017F>e that are in love by way of contemplation, who<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ure are
rather tho<U+017F>e of the minde, then tho<U+017F>e of the body; and <U+017F>he always <U+017F>et before her
eyes the cha<U+017F>tity of <hi>Alexis,</hi> who when he had his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s naked in his arms, had
not the pre<U+017F>umption to do any thing to her: if <U+017F>he thought it a happine<U+017F>s to love
<hi>Charite,</hi> <U+017F>he thought it no le<U+017F>s to be her <U+017F>elf loved by <hi>Marcel, Orontes</hi>'s Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
This young Lad made excellent <U+017F>port with her when he <U+017F>poke to her of love,
but <U+017F>he thought his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es nothing but vanity. When <U+017F>he look'd into the gla<U+017F>s,
<U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf very hand<U+017F>ome; and <U+017F>he was not far from a misfortune dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
as that of <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us;</hi> for the <U+017F>oul of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> lov'd that countenance of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillis</hi>
which <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw, that made her often ki<U+017F>s the gla<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>he might be mouth
to mouth with that Shepherde<U+017F>s: though <U+017F>he beheld her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o often, yet is it not
to be thence inferr'd, that <U+017F>he was any of the be<U+017F>t dre<U+017F>s'd in the world. You will
tell me, that her amorous imaginations made her <U+017F>o negligent; but there was <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
el<U+017F>e in the wind; 'twas becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew not <U+017F>o well how to trick up her <U+017F>elf,
and could not make her <U+017F>elf as fine as <hi>Synopa</hi> had made her the fir<U+017F>t day.</p>
            <p>When <U+017F>he had been five days with <hi>Leonora, An<U+017F>elme, Montenor,</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi>
came thither without any noi<U+017F>e. They had not been there all that time purpo<U+017F>ely to
<U+017F>ee what <hi>Amarillis</hi> would do in the mean while, and that time they had <U+017F>pent in <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
vi<U+017F>its, and hunting. The di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had engag'd <hi>Orontes, Florida, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi>
and <hi>Angelica</hi> to read Romances, for to know more of his principles, and to
make the better <U+017F>port with him. <hi>Clarimond</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner propos'd that <hi>Amarillis</hi>
mu<U+017F>t be accus'd of uncha<U+017F>tity, but every one was in doubt how the accu<U+017F>ation <U+017F>hould
be carried on. After they had con<U+017F>ulted together, <hi>Leonora</hi> is <U+017F>eated in the Court
on a high chair, and <hi>Florida</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> one on the one <U+017F>ide, and the other on
the other on <U+017F>tools. Pre<U+017F>ently <hi>Amarillis</hi> is <U+017F>ent for by two Sergeants, who binde
her hands behinde her, and drag her in a rough manner to the place, without <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing to her, though <U+017F>he conjur'd them to tell her, wherein <U+017F>he had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
When <U+017F>he was come before <hi>Leonora,</hi> they made her <U+017F>it down on a low <U+017F>tool,
like a Criminal; which done, <hi>Orontes</hi> approaches with ten or twelve per<U+017F>ons, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and Gentlewomen about him, who had been <U+017F>ent for out of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
but came not there for any rea<U+017F>on but to make a number, and were not to
<U+017F>peak any thing, as Mutes in a Play. I have <U+017F>ent for this maid to have her puni<U+017F>h'd,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Leonora</hi> to <hi>Orontes;</hi> what do you accu<U+017F>e her of. He thereupon puts on a <U+017F>eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
countenance, and <U+017F>poke to this purpo<U+017F>e;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:43725:73"/>
               <hi>I</hi> Am very <U+017F>orry, Madam, that I am con<U+017F>train'd to importune your cha<U+017F>te ears with
a plea full of impurities; but <U+017F>eeing it is better to <U+017F>peak of vice, and to di<U+017F>cover
it, then to pa<U+017F>s it over unpuni<U+017F>h'd, I <U+017F>hall with confidence acquaint you what
enormous crimes <hi>Amarillis</hi> hath committed. You charitably had receiv'd into
your hou<U+017F>e this vagabond Wench, who di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>s'd a while the mi<U+017F>chief <U+017F>he had within her;
but to the di<U+017F>honor of this hou<U+017F>e where <U+017F>he hath been <U+017F>o well entertained, it hath not been
long ere <U+017F>he di<U+017F>covered what <U+017F>he was; and having with the eyes of concupi<U+017F>ence look'd
on the beauty of my man <hi>Marcel,</hi> <U+017F>he could not be at re<U+017F>t till <U+017F>he had brought him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>cend
to her lewd de<U+017F>ires; you know he hath tho<U+017F>e features in his face, that there is
not a maid within twenty miles about, which is not in love with him: but this would
engro<U+017F>s to her <U+017F>elf what all the re<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ired, and by <U+017F>ubtil allurements hath prevailed
<U+017F>o far, that he hath <U+017F>tained the purity of his continence. He is not the only man hath
been <U+017F>o <U+017F>erved, and if he hath gone a<U+017F>tray, he is to be pardoned, as far as his <U+017F>implicity
hath exceeded his evil intentions; but as for this <U+017F>he-wolf, I demand <U+017F>he may be puni<U+017F>ht
according to the Laws which have ever been ob<U+017F>erved in this Countrey, again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e
that <U+017F>in by fornication, as <U+017F>he hath done. Madam, do me ju<U+017F>tice; con<U+017F>ider the enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ca<U+017F>e, which is the pollution of this hou<U+017F>e; be<U+017F>ides corrupting the cha<U+017F>tity of
a yong man, that was cha<U+017F>ter then <hi>Hippolitus.</hi> He was al<U+017F>o my hope, and I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igned
to marry him to my Farmers daughter, of whom he might have gotten legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
children, whereas now he is undone for ever. He hath lo<U+017F>t his honor; his faire<U+017F>t
flower is already gathered, he is not now fit for any body. Let us at lea<U+017F>t have the <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to <U+017F>ee her dye, who hath been the cau<U+017F>e of it, that <U+017F>o this misfortune may be
repaired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orontes</hi> having made this Speech, <hi>Leonora</hi> asked <hi>Amarillis,</hi> whether <U+017F>he had
any thing to <U+017F>ay again<U+017F>t it? She an<U+017F>wered, That <U+017F>he denied all was laid to her charge:
So that they <U+017F>ent for <hi>Marcel,</hi> to know the truth. He came like a Ninny weeping;
and <U+017F>ays to <hi>Leonora,</hi> It is true, Madam, that this maid hath forced me to what I had
no minde to do. After <U+017F>he had for a great while ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>heeps eyes at me, <U+017F>he told
me la<U+017F>t night, that <U+017F>he had caught a great cold, and that <U+017F>he did nothing but cough;
but that which troubled her mo<U+017F>t was, that <U+017F>he lay alone, and had no body near
her to <U+017F>ay, <hi>God ble<U+017F>s you.</hi> Hereupon <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o importunate with me, that I could
not be at re<U+017F>t till <U+017F>he had prevail'd to do her that good office: and to be brief, I
was fain to lie with her la<U+017F>t night, and that hath been the occa<U+017F>ion of this mi<U+017F>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
If it be expected I <U+017F>hould proceed any further in this <U+017F>tory, <U+017F>hame will <U+017F>top
up the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of my voyce, and I dare <U+017F>peak no more.</p>
            <p>There <hi>Marcel</hi> gave over, and <hi>Amarillis</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>uming the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, cryes out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently,
Ah mi<U+017F>chief! where would<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>eek what thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay more? have
I de<U+017F>ired thee to do any thing to thy di<U+017F>honor and mine? and thou ha<U+017F>t lien with
me? Let the earth open now and <U+017F>wallow me up, if there be any <U+017F>uch thing. Do<U+017F>t
thou not remember, that when ever thou would<U+017F>t but ki<U+017F>s me, I have thru<U+017F>t thee
back with as much di<U+017F>dain as if thou had<U+017F>t been a mon<U+017F>ter? wilt thou imitate <hi>Paae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>
who accus'd <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> that had <U+017F>leighted her; and becau<U+017F>e thou ha<U+017F>t not been
able to force me, wilt thou <U+017F>ay that I have forc'd thee? Alas! Is there no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
here that will <U+017F>peak for me? He <U+017F>hall plead for Innocency it <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o <hi>Amarillis</hi> look'd about of all <U+017F>ides, but there was no body offered
any thing in her defence: nor had <U+017F>he any witne<U+017F><U+017F>es to prove that <U+017F>he had always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted
the care<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Marcel;</hi> and on the contrary, that it was he had come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
her. All the <U+017F>ervants came and bore witne<U+017F>s, that they had <U+017F>een her look
very wantonly on that Lad; and there was none but had <U+017F>omewhat to <U+017F>ay, even
<hi>Charite</hi> her <U+017F>elf, who came and <U+017F>wore, <U+017F>he had heard her <U+017F>igh before him. There

While <U+017F>he was in this con<U+017F>ideration, and dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay no more, <hi>Leonora</hi> making as

            <p>THe Complaint of <hi>Marcel</hi> and his Ma<U+017F>ter being heard, as to what they affirm,
That <hi>Amarillis</hi> hath corrupted this yong man, and hath betrayed her honor; and
fora<U+017F>much as the <U+017F>aid maid hath always denyed it, We ordain, That <U+017F>he be put to the
tryal of her cha<U+017F>tity before there be any further proceeding, according to the cu<U+017F>tom of
this Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amarillis</hi> was very well content with this judgement; <U+017F>o that pre<U+017F>ently the <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>Plate</hi> was <U+017F>ent for, which was kept among the trea<U+017F>ure of the Ca<U+017F>tle. Tho<U+017F>e
which were pre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>poke of it as a thing that were really <U+017F>o; and affirmed, that
none but cha<U+017F>te per<U+017F>ons could tread on it, without burning the <U+017F>oles of their feet.
There was one of the maids would needs go for it; but <hi>Orontes</hi> <U+017F>aid to her, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
not thou thy <U+017F>elf, I prethee, in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, thou know<U+017F>t too much di<U+017F>timula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I will not be accountable for thee. Know, that tho<U+017F>e who are but guilty of
the lea<U+017F>t matter that can be, dare not touch this Plate. It mu<U+017F>t be only <U+017F>ent for by
little children, of who<U+017F>e cha<U+017F>tity we are a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd. Let the Gardeners two daughters
bring it: whereupon the two little children were led where hung the bra<U+017F>s Plate,
whereon the maids dry'd the bands when they <U+017F>tarched; they brought it away, and
plac'd it in the middle of the Court. <hi>Amarillis</hi> thought all the<U+017F>e things real; for
<U+017F>he had ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>uch an other adventure in the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> hi<U+017F>tory; and if they
would try her by fire, <U+017F>he call'd to minde a certain <hi>Melite,</hi> whereof there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made in the Loves of <hi>Clitophon</hi> and <hi>Leucippus,</hi> who was put to the tryal of
water. While <U+017F>he was <U+017F>tripping her <U+017F>elf for to go upon the Plate, a <U+017F>turdy Groom
making as if he were curious, touch'd it with the top of his finger. But he drew
back pre<U+017F>ently, crying out, I burn, I burn, my hand is roa<U+017F>ted. Thou art well enough
<U+017F>erved prophane Ra<U+017F>cal, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Orontes,</hi> thou would<U+017F>t not believe a thing that <U+017F>o
many others have tryed. Could<U+017F>t thou forget that thou had<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s'd all thy youth
in Bawdy-hou<U+017F>es? And yet do<U+017F>t thou pretend to Cha<U+017F>tity after all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amarillis</hi> ob<U+017F>erving this adventure, fell into <U+017F>ome amazement, and being ready
to tread upon the Plate, <U+017F>he was a little afraid of burning. As for <hi>Amarillis,</hi> <U+017F>ayes
<U+017F>he in her <U+017F>elf, I am <U+017F>ure <U+017F>he is cha<U+017F>t; but as for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I am not <U+017F>o certain: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
my feet <U+017F>hall not be burn'd, for it is in body and externally that I am <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillis,</hi>
and am not <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> but in <U+017F>oul, <U+017F>eeing a Magician hath changed my Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
            <p>Having by this <U+017F>ubtility rea<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he recovers her courage, having before
examined her whole life pa<U+017F>t, and con<U+017F>idered, that if the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had <U+017F>inn'd,
it had been only by de<U+017F>ire, and that he had never committed folly with any of his
members. It being at la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olved, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Amarillis</hi> were as clear as when
they were born, the accu<U+017F>ed party went bare foot upon the Plate, and remained on
it a long while without feeling any heat; nor indeed was there any rea<U+017F>on it <U+017F>hould
be hot, for it was above two days <U+017F>ince there had been any fire under it. Some
that were pre<U+017F>ent, cry'd out thereupon, Come thence <hi>Amarillis,</hi> you are cha<U+017F>t,
we are <U+017F>atisfied you have been too much per<U+017F>ecuted. O <hi>Amarillis!</hi> the Queen of
fair and cha<U+017F>t ones, what light you ca<U+017F>t from that place. There is no other fire on
that Plate, but that of your eyes. She came down infinitely pleas'd at the<U+017F>e Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
but <hi>Orontes</hi> crying out louder then any of the re<U+017F>t, came and <U+017F>aid, That
this proof was not to be credited, and that it was not true as to her particular.
<hi>Amarillis</hi> is a Sorcere<U+017F>s, I know it well enough, <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>ome charms to <U+017F>ave her
from burning. Let her be <U+017F>trip'd naked, that her characters may be taken from
her, and then let her be condemned to the fire, or be ca<U+017F>t into the River with a
mill<U+017F>tone at her neck.</p>
            <p>Thereupon <hi>Leonora</hi> bid them <U+017F>ee whether <U+017F>he had any Witch-craft about her;
which command given, all the Lacquays that were there fell upon her. One took
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43725:74"/>
away her coif, another her wa<U+017F>tcoat, but <U+017F>he immediately cover'd her head with
her apron, that her hair might not be <U+017F>een, which was too <U+017F>hort to be a maids.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> upon this, i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of a place where he lay hid, came and delivered
her out of the hands of tho<U+017F>e mercile<U+017F>s mini<U+017F>ters of ju<U+017F>tice; and having carried her
into a corner where <U+017F>he might fit her cloathes about her, went and ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf on
his knees before the Judges. Have pitty on an innocent creature, Madam, <U+017F>ayes

her beauties, that I am willing to dye for her. You <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he hath charms about her,
it is true, <U+017F>he hath tho<U+017F>e of her eyes, that have no other operation but on me, and that
to hurt me; and if <U+017F>he have any other be<U+017F>ides, to <U+017F>ave her from the burning of the
<U+017F>acred <hi>Plate,</hi> I confe<U+017F>s it is I that have given them her, unknown to her. It is I
that am the Sorcerer: tis I that am guilty, let there be made ready a pile of fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,
that I may be ca<U+017F>t into the fire. I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffer no more then what I do every
day; the fire I <U+017F>hall be ca<U+017F>t in, will not be more ardent then that of the fair eyes of
<hi>Amarillis.</hi> If you alledge <U+017F>he is not only guilty of Witchcraft, but al<U+017F>o of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
for which <U+017F>he is neverthele<U+017F>s worthy to dye, I will al<U+017F>o <U+017F>uffer the puni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for her in that ca<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he may live; nay, you <U+017F>hall give me a thou<U+017F>and deaths
if you de<U+017F>ire it. You under<U+017F>tand not your <U+017F>elf, friend, replyes <hi>Leonora,</hi> know you
not that all crimes are per<U+017F>onal, and that they who have committed them are onely
to be puni<U+017F>h'd. If you are <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to dye, you <U+017F>hall both dye together. Make
ha<U+017F>te there, and bring <U+017F>ome faggots, and <U+017F>et them afire. <hi>Leonora</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner
pronounc'd that cruel <U+017F>entence, but abundance of Crackers were fired at the gate,
and <hi>Hircan</hi> i<U+017F><U+017F>ues out of a flame of Pitch and Ro<U+017F>in, like a Gho<U+017F>t in a Play. He held
in his hand a lighted Torch, that made a great <U+017F>moak; and the better to act the part
of a Magician, he had a long Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ock of black Canvas. The whole pre<U+017F>ence <U+017F>eem'd
to be much troubled at his coming, and every one ran his way: <U+017F>o that it was ea<U+017F>ie
for him to <U+017F>eize on <hi>Amarillis,</hi> whom when he had di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed into a Coach that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the gate: Fear not, fair Shepherd, <U+017F>ays he to her, I am thy friend <hi>Hircan,</hi> who
am come to <U+017F>uccour thee in thy nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity. Tho<U+017F>e who had de<U+017F>ign'd thee to death,
may now <U+017F>eek after thee to little purpo<U+017F>e. My Chariot is drawn by hor<U+017F>es wing'd
like Gryphons, who in a <U+017F>hort time will bring us to my hou<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The adventures pa<U+017F>t had <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpris'd <hi>Amarillis,</hi> that <U+017F>he knew not where <U+017F>he
was, but at length coming to her <U+017F>elf; and knowing <hi>Hircan,</hi> <U+017F>he thank'd him for
the favour he had done her. She told him that he <U+017F>hould have brought <hi>Clarimond</hi>
al<U+017F>o away with him; becau<U+017F>e that he being detained as her <U+017F>urety, they would put
him to death for her. Do not trouble your <U+017F>elf for that, <U+017F>ays <hi>Hircan,</hi> one of my
<U+017F>pirits hath carried him away, he is by this time at home. May we al<U+017F>o be conducted
along with the like dexterity, replyes <hi>Amarillis:</hi> for <hi>Claudian</hi> <U+017F>peaking of the
Chariot of <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> <U+017F>ays, That the roads of the ayr are as dangerous as tho<U+017F>e
of the <U+017F>ea.</p>
            <p>The Coach went a good pace, while they were <U+017F>o di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing; <U+017F>o that in a little
while they came to the Magicians Ca<U+017F>tle: <hi>Amarillis</hi> had much ado to per<U+017F>wade
her <U+017F>elf that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>till <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> <U+017F>he had quite forgotten that per<U+017F>on, and it <U+017F>eemed
<U+017F>trange to her to be called by that name: <U+017F>he felt her <U+017F>elf in tho<U+017F>e parts which
<U+017F>peak a man, and though <U+017F>he found there what was wont to be, yet was <U+017F>he not
confident it was there. This doubt could <U+017F>he not be delivered of, till the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
as if he had us'd a Countercharm, had ca<U+017F>t a little water on her head, <U+017F>peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>ome barbarous words. Which done, he rea<U+017F><U+017F>umed his Shepherds habit, and
went and related to the Nymph <hi>Synopa</hi> all the Adventures he had run through.</p>
            <p>All this was the de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> who had <U+017F>ent for <hi>Hircan.</hi> They
flaid at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Ca<U+017F>tle with the re<U+017F>t of the Company, and had good <U+017F>port and
laughing at all the follies of the amorous Shepherd. Every one affirmed, there was
nothing comparable to his conver<U+017F>ation, and that they had now really <U+017F>een a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
adventure, which before had never been <U+017F>een but in writing. But if they
were <U+017F>atisfied, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> (how hard I finde it not to call him <U+017F>till <hi>Amarillis)</hi> was no
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43725:74"/>
le<U+017F>s. He <U+017F>aid, that that had hapned to him which was not in any Hi<U+017F>tory in the
world: There was in the <hi>Faithfull Shepherd</hi> a Shepherde<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>ame name, who
had been fal<U+017F>ely accu<U+017F>ed to have been di<U+017F>honour'd; and in a later <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> that he
had read, there was another Shepherde<U+017F>s accu<U+017F>ed upon the <U+017F>ame account; but that
it was never heard that a Shepherd having put on Maids cloaths, had been call'd to
que<U+017F>tion for any <U+017F>uch thing. In all manner of adventures he <U+017F>till exemplified out of
divers <hi>Romances,</hi> which I <U+017F>hall not name: And it is not much to be wondred at if he
produced many examples to the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e; for it is ob<U+017F>erved that tho<U+017F>e rare wits
that compo<U+017F>e them, are <U+017F>o furni<U+017F>h'd with invention, that they can hardly advance
any thing which they have not <U+017F>toln from others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having his ordinary cloaths on, was already weary at the Magicians, and
had a mind to go vi<U+017F>it <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> He took the <U+017F>ame Coach wherein
he came, and returned to them. They were come home from <hi>Orontes</hi>'s; and a<U+017F><U+017F>oon
as they <U+017F>aw him, they <U+017F>tood as amaz'd, and ask'd him where he had been all that
while. Do you not <U+017F>ee that I have <U+017F>till my Gitarrhe in my hand? <U+017F>ays he, <U+017F>miling:
I have been to give my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s a Serenade; it is but one day <U+017F>ince I went hence.
You have then <U+017F>lept away <U+017F>ix in <U+017F>ome cave, replies <hi>Montenor:</hi> In the mean while
you have lo<U+017F>t a fair deal of time; you have not <U+017F>een a Maid that <hi>Leonora</hi> had, who
<U+017F>eem'd to us well as hand<U+017F>om as <hi>Charite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> who was in another chamber, came in thereupon, and avow'd the
La<U+017F>s was <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>om, that he was de<U+017F>perately fallen in love with her, and that he
knew not how <U+017F>he was taken away from him. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>miling, would not any longer
conceal the truth; and <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid to them, You have been deceiv'd, my dear friends!
it was I that acted the part of <hi>Amaryllis:</hi> Now I tell you, but <U+017F>ay nothing of it at
<hi>Orontes</hi>'s, le<U+017F>t <hi>Leonora</hi> be angry with me. Every one <U+017F>eemed to be ravi<U+017F>h'd with
admiration, and above all <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who could not give over <U+017F>aying, Shall I hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
love nothing but an Idaea? where <U+017F>hall I find the fair Nymph that hath
wounded me? Ah, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is!</hi> <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he is in thee, I mu<U+017F>t change my love into an
honorable friend<U+017F>hip. There was nothing el<U+017F>e talk'd of all <U+017F>upper-time; and the
next day after dinner they went all to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, who ask'd the Shepherd where he
had been for the <U+017F>pace of <U+017F>even or eight days, all which time they had not <U+017F>een him.
To which he an<U+017F>wered, that he had been vi<U+017F>iting certain Shepherds of the Country.
When they had given over que<U+017F>tioning him, he took his time to go and entertain
<hi>Charite</hi> a<U+017F>ide, where <U+017F>he was at work at <U+017F>ome linnen. <hi>Incomparable Shepherde<U+017F>s!</hi>
<U+017F>ays he to her; how long will you not regard my love? Know you not that <hi>Lignon</hi>
<U+017F>hall return to its <U+017F>ource, the Trees <U+017F>hall be leafle<U+017F>s in the Spring, and <hi>Love</hi> without
his <hi>quiver</hi> and <hi>torch,</hi> before the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>hall cea<U+017F>e to adore you? Will you
ever be a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> to draw men to you and devour them? or a <hi>Gorgon,</hi> or a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<U+017F>a,</hi>
to change hearts into rocks of con<U+017F>tancie, whereas your own is a rock of di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain?
Ha! well fare thou <hi>Diamantin!</hi> ah <hi>Anaxeretes!</hi> The Shepherd had no
<U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, but <hi>Charite</hi> runs away from him, and goes &amp; <U+017F>ays to <hi>Leonora,</hi> Truly
Madam, I cannot any longer <U+017F>uffer this <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> he doth nothing but abu<U+017F>e me.
Whereupon he drew near and <U+017F>aid, that he call'd heaven to witne<U+017F>s he had ever
courted his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s with as much re<U+017F>pect as if <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>ome Divinity, and that
he had not <U+017F>poken to her but in quaint terms taken out of the Poets, and that all
his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es were perpetual citations. Then he repeated what he had <U+017F>aid; and
<hi>Leonora</hi> thinking it very <U+017F>ignificant, bid <hi>Charite</hi> learn what Complements were, and
to receive her <U+017F>ervant more kindly thenceforward. However he entertain'd her not
any further at that time; for they had engag'd him into a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e about other
things.</p>
            <p>Being returned to <hi>Montenors,</hi> and having a mind to walk into the fields a little
before <U+017F>upper, he met a Country-man, whom he asked where he intended to lodge
that night. He told him, at <hi>Coulommiers.</hi> That put him into a little <U+017F>tudy; for it
<U+017F>eems he had heard <U+017F>ay that that Town was but thirteen leagues off <hi>Paris,</hi> whereas
he thought him<U+017F>elf a hundred di<U+017F>tant from it. At which <hi>Coulommiers?</hi> <U+017F>ays he to
the Country-man. At <hi>Coulommiers</hi> in <hi>Brie,</hi> <U+017F>ays the other. You are mi<U+017F>taken, friend,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43725:75"/>
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> You talk of lodging in <hi>Brie</hi> to night, whereas you are now in <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>ts,</hi>
there is a great di<U+017F>tance between them, I know well the Geography of them<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
I know my way as well as you can tell me, replies the Country-man: I have gone
this way the<U+017F>e thirty years, you <U+017F>hall not need teach me. And <U+017F>o kept on his way,
leaving <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in an un<U+017F>peakable a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment. A while after he met another man,
that came from that quarter where the other went: In what Country are we, <U+017F>ays
he to him? you'll do me a favour to tell me. You know better then I, Sir, <U+017F>ays the
other to him; what think you? are we not in <hi>Brie!</hi> In <hi>Brie!</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ure
we are in <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts;</hi> do you not <U+017F>ee I am clad like a Shepherd? But whence come
you now? whither go you? do you intend to lodge to night at <hi>Montbri<U+017F><U+017F>on?</hi> 'Tis
a great way thither, replies the Traveller, I know it well, it is my own Country; I
would I were there! but I am but a league off <hi>Coulommiers,</hi> through which Town
I came, and I <U+017F>hall lie to night at the fir<U+017F>t Town where I find good lodging. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
was now more amaz'd then before; and he could not re<U+017F>olve whether <hi>Brie</hi> were
tran<U+017F>ported to the place where <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi> <U+017F>hould be, or whether he him<U+017F>elf had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly
leap'd out of one Country into the other. He <U+017F>pake with much earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s
to this Traveller, who an<U+017F>wered him as <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, and gave him <U+017F>uch rea<U+017F>ons as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
him that he had been deceiv'd. The vexation it put him to was <U+017F>uch, that he
would not return to <hi>Montenor's.</hi> The man he met <U+017F>eem'd to him to be a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
fellow, <U+017F>o that he re<U+017F>olved to indent a friend<U+017F>hip with him, though his face
was <U+017F>omwhat of the roughe<U+017F>t. Having asked him what he was, he gave this account
of him<U+017F>elf: About five years <U+017F>ince (<U+017F>ays he) I was by profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion a Journyman-Joyner,
and had the occa<U+017F>ion to fa<U+017F>ten a board in the Study of a Learned man that
liv'd at <hi>Paris:</hi> He entred into talk with me; and finding my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es to his mind,
he told me, that if I would <U+017F>erve him, he would make me a knowing man. Now he
had found out the <hi>Philo<U+017F>ophers <U+017F>tone</hi> of Knowledge; and in the papers he cau<U+017F>ed to
be <U+017F>tuck up and down the City, he promi<U+017F>ed the Abridgment of tho<U+017F>e <hi>long Studies.</hi>
I quitted my former profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, for to become learned under him: And I <U+017F>wear to
you, that having <U+017F>erv'd him ever <U+017F>ince till now, he hath taught me very excellent
things. I know not what's become of him <U+017F>ince: I left him about a <U+017F>mall difference
that hapned between us; and now I travel up and down <hi>France,</hi> teaching what I
know to children. You never heard of any thing more admirable then what I know;
I <U+017F>peak readily on any <U+017F>ubject is given me; my name is <hi>Carmelin.</hi> Seeing you are
<U+017F>o eloquent, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> let me hear what you can <U+017F>ay of <hi>Vertue. Vertue</hi> is <U+017F>o <hi>fair,</hi>
replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that if men could <U+017F>ee her <hi>naked,</hi> they could not but fall in <hi>love</hi> with
her: They <U+017F>ay, that at <hi>Rome</hi> it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to pa<U+017F>s through her Temple to that of
<hi>Honour.</hi> As Silver is of le<U+017F>s e<U+017F>teem then Gold, <U+017F>o is Gold then Vertue. She it is that
takes deep root in the field of our <U+017F>ouls, but all other things fade and fall like the
flowers of the meadow. And what <U+017F>ay you of <hi>Plea<U+017F>ure?</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is. Plea<U+017F>ure</hi>
is the mo<U+017F>t importunate Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s in the world, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> the wages <U+017F>he gives
us in the end are di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es and de<U+017F>pairs: It abounds with honey and gall; if it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
us with Hyppocras, there's wormwood in the bottom of the bowl: She is a
treacherous whore, that doth not embrace, but to kill you. As I am a <hi>Shepherd,</hi>
cryes out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> here are as many <hi>French Margarites</hi> as ever I heard in my life:
It is clearly <U+017F>een that you have mo<U+017F>t exqui<U+017F>ite ob<U+017F>ervations, and excellent common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places.
You are the man I want, I <U+017F>hall never meet with a better companion. I <U+017F>ee
you are an un<U+017F>etled per<U+017F>on, you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>tay in this Country with me. A <U+017F>mall matter
maintains us, if you will but turn Shepherd as I am; for invitations are <U+017F>o forced
upon me, that I am hardly able to <U+017F>atisfie tho<U+017F>e that would have me to dinners and
<U+017F>uppers. Know you what a <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> life is? The <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> life is the happie<U+017F>t in the
world, replies <hi>Carmelin; Shepherds</hi> are <hi>content</hi> with the little they have, and he
that is <hi>content</hi> is <hi>happy.</hi> The Naturali<U+017F>ts teach us, that the thunder falls on the talle<U+017F>t
trees, and not on the lowe<U+017F>t <U+017F>hrubs; <U+017F>o calamities aim at great per<U+017F>ons, and pa<U+017F>s
over poor ru<U+017F>ticks. Say you <U+017F>o! there is the word indeed, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> out of exce<U+017F>s of
joy: what an able man are you! you <U+017F>peak nothing but <U+017F>entences. What wonders
<U+017F>hall we do, if you live with me! We will make Books, we will crack Arguments,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43725:75"/>
and Harangue it before the Nymphs. I will give you a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, if you have not
cho<U+017F>en one already. You <U+017F>hall court her, and receive <U+017F>ignal favours from her; but
you mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olve to <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>omewhat before you obtain her, for <U+017F>he is a mo<U+017F>t
di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F>s. Will you not treat her with fine amorous Complements?
They <U+017F>ay, that in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> there was a <U+017F>tatue of <hi>Memnon,</hi> which when the Sun
<U+017F>hone on it, made an harmonious <U+017F>ound, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Carmelin;</hi> in like manner, when you
or any other per<U+017F>on of equal merit <U+017F>hall dart your rayes on me, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak tho<U+017F>e
things that <U+017F>hall <U+017F>atisfie your ears. The cu<U+017F>tom of <hi>Per<U+017F>ia</hi> being to make pre<U+017F>ents
to the King, a poor handy-craftsman that met <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and had nothing to
give him, went and fetch'd a little fre<U+017F>h water, and pre<U+017F>ented him with it. So I
<U+017F>hall not indeed pre<U+017F>ent you but with <U+017F>mall matters, but you will e<U+017F>teem them much,
if you mea<U+017F>ure them by my good will, knowing that I have not the trea<U+017F>ure of
<hi>Crae<U+017F>us.</hi> Do not quote <U+017F>o much, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> let us return to the <U+017F>tatue of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
I think I am of the <U+017F>ame humour. As <U+017F>oon as ever my head is <U+017F>mitten by the
heat of the Sun, I begin to <U+017F>neeze. But to <U+017F>peak of what concerns you, without
any further digre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, I <U+017F>wear to you that you will finde tho<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ures with me,
that neither the mo<U+017F>t powerful words of your eloquence, nor mine can ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s.
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was not the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t in the world, was ravi<U+017F>h'd with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>es
of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> Upon this there pa<U+017F>t by a Countrey-fellow, of whom the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
ask'd the way to <hi>Clarimonds</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle; he told him he was going that way, and
bid him follow. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> did <U+017F>o, being re<U+017F>olved to go thither, becau<U+017F>e he had a good
opinion of the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of that Gentleman. He found him at home, for he had
left <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme.</hi> But <hi>Clarimond</hi> was amaz'd to <U+017F>ee him, and as'd him
why he had left his good friends. They are cheats, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> they have brought
me hither, making me believe it was the Country of <hi>Fore<U+017F>ts,</hi> and 'tis <hi>Bry;</hi> but if I
be a Shepherd, I <U+017F>hall live as happily here as el<U+017F>ewhere. My mother hath di<U+017F>charg'd
the Shepherd <U+017F>he had, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> will you take his place; the condition is
not to be contemned, you <U+017F>hall have wages, and <U+017F>hall be well entertain'd: In the
morning your Scrip <U+017F>hall be well furni<U+017F>h'd, and at night you <U+017F>hall have as much
pottage as you will. To prop<U+017F>e this to me, is to treat me unworthily, replyes
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> know, that I will not keep any <U+017F>heep but what <U+017F>hall be my own, I will not
be a Hireling. 'Tis not out of any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity I take this condition, but for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
of this kinde of life. 'Tis upon the <U+017F>ame grounds that <U+017F>o many Shepherds
of <hi>Arcadia</hi> and <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> who are come from noble hou<U+017F>es do the like. But you
that have <U+017F>worn to turn Shepherd with me, tell me, where is the memory of all
your oathes? I have forgot nothing of what I promi<U+017F>s'd you, replies <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
but I cannot yet perform it, becau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s I have to do of my
mothers, which I may not by any means neglect. A man mu<U+017F>t put away all <hi>cares,</hi>
before he can be a <hi>Shepherd</hi> as you are. You are in the right, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and
in the mean time this hone<U+017F>t man here, will bear me company. He is a knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
hear him <U+017F>peak, that you may <U+017F>ee what he is.</p>
            <p>When he had <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he <U+017F>hewed <hi>Carmelin</hi> to <hi>Clarimond;</hi> who pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>aid to
him, It <U+017F>eems you are a Companion of this brave Shepherd. <hi>Vertue</hi> will <U+017F>oon have
<hi>Companions,</hi> an<U+017F>wers <hi>Carmelin. Pliny</hi> and <hi>du Vair</hi> <U+017F>ay, that the <U+017F>tone <hi>Panthaura</hi>
draws to it <U+017F>elf whatever is near it; <U+017F>o vertue draws all the world after it. How!
he quotes Authors, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> you <U+017F>ee it, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> he is the principal
di<U+017F>ciple of the <hi>Authour of the Abridgement of Long-<U+017F>tudies.</hi> Nay, then I do not
wonder that he is learned, replyes <hi>Clarimond,</hi> there are none but excellent per<U+017F>ons
come out of the School of <U+017F>uch a Philo<U+017F>opher.</p>
            <p>That pa<U+017F>t, <hi>Clarimond</hi> gave order Supper <U+017F>hould be made ready, <U+017F>eeing he mu<U+017F>t
needs entertain the<U+017F>e new gue<U+017F>ts, notwith<U+017F>tanding his mothers niggardline<U+017F>s. While
they were at table, <hi>Carmelin</hi> di<U+017F>played the excellency of his knowledge, and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
about temperance. There were none, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> excepted, but could ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee,
that he <U+017F>poke like a Parrot, and that he had by heart things he under<U+017F>tood not:
for he pronounc'd the words fal<U+017F>e, never <U+017F>topp'd at any period, nor ever elevated or
let fall his voyce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:43725:76"/>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> propo<U+017F>ing to him what he ought to do to be a Shepherd, told him, that
in the fir<U+017F>t place he mu<U+017F>t choo<U+017F>e a fine name, and quit that of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> which was
not <U+017F>o proper for a man of their quality; and that he would have him called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rydon,
Thyr<U+017F>is</hi> or <hi>Melibeus;</hi> but <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>aid, that his Father and all his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>tors
had been call'd <U+017F>o, and that he would not do them the injury to change
their name. You mu<U+017F>t at lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e it whatever come on't, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and <U+017F>o
making a diminutive of it, I will call you <hi>Carmelinet,</hi> or <hi>Carmelinthus,</hi> or <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindor;</hi>
the<U+017F>e words have the full <U+017F>ent of a <hi>Romance.</hi> When I have <U+017F>aid a thing, I
am re<U+017F>olute to ob<U+017F>erve it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin.</hi> Well, <U+017F>eeing you are inconvincible, keep
your former name, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I know what's to be done. To give an Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of this name of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I will have it derived from <hi>Charmes,</hi> to <U+017F>hew that
you make <hi>Charms</hi> or <hi>Ver<U+017F>es,</hi> or that you de<U+017F>ire to make <U+017F>ome. While this pa<U+017F>t,
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ob<U+017F>erving the countenance of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and all the re<U+017F>t of his body, found
much that he had <U+017F>omewhat to object to. You mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o change your Phy<U+017F>iognomy
to be a Shepherd with me, <U+017F>ays he to him, you are as na<U+017F>ty as a Pedants boy: your
hair's as grea<U+017F>ie, as if it had been wa<U+017F>h'd in <U+017F>allet oyl; your beard is in <U+017F>uch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture,
as if it had never known what a ra<U+017F>or nor ci<U+017F>ers meant, and that you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been trim'd but with a wi<U+017F>p of lighted <U+017F>traw, or with the <U+017F>hells of burnt nuts, as
<hi>Diony<U+017F>ius</hi> the Tyrant was. I ob<U+017F>erve al<U+017F>o on your mu<U+017F>tachoes, certain little pearls
which fall out of your no<U+017F>e like dew. That hair mu<U+017F>t be taken away, where the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundicities
of the common <U+017F>hore of you brain are <U+017F>topp'd. Do you not <U+017F>ee that
I have the chin as clear as any <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor? why would you <U+017F>uffer your beard
<U+017F>o long? or do you keep it for a bib to <U+017F>ave your ruff, when you eat porredge?
you mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o have wa<U+017F>h-balls for your hands, which are as earthy, as if for want
of a plow, they had turn'd up an acre of ground; nor mu<U+017F>t you forget to keep
your nails <U+017F>hort, which towards the top are of a <U+017F>late colour, and are <U+017F>o overgrown,
that they may be u<U+017F>ed for lanthorns, or may <U+017F>erve for <U+017F>hooing-horns. This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
made <hi>Carmelin</hi> hold his peace a while; but at la<U+017F>t he <U+017F>wallowed down his
<U+017F>hame in a gla<U+017F>s of wine, and promi<U+017F>s'd to make him<U+017F>elf as neat as the Bridegroom
of a Country Village.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>ent a man to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> to bid him not trouble him<U+017F>elf about <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi>
and <U+017F>o commanded a Chamber to be prepared for the two Shepherds. Having di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
a little while after <U+017F>upper, they went to bed all three. The next day <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
being unwilling to defer his being a Shepherd in good earne<U+017F>t any longer, propo<U+017F>s'd
it to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and <U+017F>eeing that he was more willing to be his <U+017F>ervant then his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
becau<U+017F>e he was very poor, he was re<U+017F>olved to take him to his <U+017F>ervice; yet
not commanding him any thing but what was ea<U+017F>ie and honorable: So he gave
him money, and bid him go buy <U+017F>heep in <U+017F>ome market, and withal, charg'd him
not to forget to take off his beard, and clean<U+017F>e his hair. When he was gone, <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
came and drew <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> into <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es about his Loves; and asked him,
if he had not yet receiv'd <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ignal favour of <hi>Charite.</hi> He an<U+017F>wered, that his
own over-re<U+017F>pect towards her, had hindred him. A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf Lover, <U+017F>ayes
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> that fortune favours confidence, nay temerity. Contemn the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tances
of your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; maids do not run from us, but to be follow'd and overtaken.
They fight not, but to be overcome, and are plea<U+017F>s'd they are not the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t.
If your lips may touch theirs, you mu<U+017F>t not be content with that: for he that hath
obtain'd a ki<U+017F>s, and proceeds no further, <U+017F>hews him<U+017F>elf unworthy of what he hath
receiv'd. You'll bring me the examples of many cha<U+017F>te Shepherds, but they are
all Cock<U+017F>combs; there are divers others more to be commended then they, who
have made their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es leap again.</p>
            <p>A certain <U+017F>trange plea<U+017F>ure came thereupon, and tickled <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and for to be
<U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>atisfied in his love, he re<U+017F>olv'd to follow <hi>Clarimonds</hi> advice, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to arrive at <U+017F>ome enjoyment. In this con<U+017F>ideration he went out to walk
<U+017F>omewhere near the Ca<U+017F>tle. He had not been out half an hour, but he perceives two
women on the highway, who came lea<U+017F>urely towards him. At length he perceiv'd
it was <hi>Orontes</hi>'s gardeners wife, and the fair <hi>Charite.</hi> He went behinde a hedge, that

he might not be <U+017F>een: And as they went along, <U+017F>ays <hi>Charite</hi> to the other, I mu<U+017F>t
re<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf before I go any further; let's <U+017F>it down here. They pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ate them
down on the gra<U+017F>s: So that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> putting on what confidence he could, came and
acco<U+017F>ted them. They acquainted him that they were going in pilgrimage to St. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aere.</hi>
But he immediately changing the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, began to prai<U+017F>e the beauty of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
which was increa<U+017F>ed by the heat <U+017F>he had by going. The Gardeners wife, who
under<U+017F>tood nothing of all this, ri<U+017F>e up and <U+017F>aid to her companion, that <U+017F>he would go
lei<U+017F>urely before, and that <U+017F>he could not endure to be <U+017F>itting. The Shepherd <U+017F>eeing
him<U+017F>elf all alone with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, would put in practice that are of Loving that
<hi>Clarimond</hi> had taught him; and in the fir<U+017F>t place taking the fair hand which had
<U+017F>tollen away his heart, he would needs ki<U+017F>s it. <hi>Charite</hi> draws it back pre<U+017F>ently, <U+017F>o
that he was forc'd to <U+017F>ay to her, If you will not give me leave to ki<U+017F>s naked this thief
of my heart, I'll draw your <U+017F>mock-<U+017F>leeve over it, and ki<U+017F>s it <U+017F>o; will you not permit
me? People are fain to ki<U+017F>s Reliques through a gla<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, he <U+017F>trived <U+017F>o much, that he ki<U+017F>s'd the bare hand: And believing
he ought in con<U+017F>equence endeavour <U+017F>ome greater victory over his <U+017F>weet enemy,
Ha <hi>Charite!</hi> <U+017F>ays he to her with dying eyes and an amorous ge<U+017F>ture, Now that we
are alone, who<U+017F>e fault is it that we imitate not <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Cloe,</hi> and that we <U+017F>trip
not our <U+017F>elves naked as they did, to go and wa<U+017F>h together in <U+017F>ome fountain here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts?
There is one I know hath <U+017F>o much umbrage, that the Sun who <U+017F>ees all
things cannot di<U+017F>cover us there: I mu<U+017F>t lie on thy brea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing thou art my Altar,
and that I am the Victim that is to be laid on it. Wilt thou not <U+017F>uffer that my half
be glued to thine? Is there no means that both of us together make an <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was no <U+017F>ooner delivered of the<U+017F>e words, but his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s under<U+017F>tood well
enough what he meant; for it is a maxim, That a maid cannot be <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple
but <U+017F>he will apprehend this, in what terms <U+017F>oever it be <U+017F>poken. So that <hi>Charite</hi> ri<U+017F>e
up, and going her ways <U+017F>aid to him, Fear not, Impudence! but a<U+017F><U+017F>ure thy <U+017F>elf that
I'll tell my Lady of this; thou come<U+017F>t to di<U+017F>turb my devotions with thy follies: If
ever thou come<U+017F>t to our hou<U+017F>e again, thou <U+017F>halt find the door <U+017F>hut. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ri<U+017F>ing
up, cries out, O Virgin more tender then the vine-bud! thou run<U+017F>t away from me
fa<U+017F>ter then the young Fawn doth from the mercile<U+017F>s tooth of a Bear: I do not run
after thee like a Wolf for to devour thee; I am no <hi>Myrmidon,</hi> nor <U+017F>avage <hi>Dolopus.</hi>
Alas! <U+017F>tay till thou hear me, or hear me till I come to thee: Thou flie<U+017F>t like an A<U+017F>p
who<U+017F>e tail hath been trod on. Notwith<U+017F>tanding this complaint, <U+017F>he kept on her
way <U+017F>till: which <U+017F>o amaz'd him, that he dur<U+017F>t not run after her, but remained as
immoveable as a <U+017F>tatue. Oh how often did he cur<U+017F>e the advice of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> which
had procured him nothing but the disfavour of <hi>Charite!</hi> Oh how did he now wi<U+017F>h
he had <U+017F>aid nothing at all to her, and that he had been as mute that day as the fi<U+017F>h
in the river <hi>Mo<U+017F>in,</hi> which mu<U+017F>t no more be called <hi>Lignon!</hi> Oh how he wi<U+017F>h'd he
had had no more u<U+017F>e of his members then a Paralytick, before his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>o he
might have done her no violence! But what was pa<U+017F>t could not be recalled; all his
recour<U+017F>e now was to <U+017F>ighs and tears.</p>
            <p>Dinner-time was <U+017F>lipt away in the<U+017F>e imaginations: So that <hi>Clarimond</hi> wondring
he returned not, went out to look after him. Having found him weeping at the foot
of a tree, Ah <hi>Clarimond!</hi> <U+017F>ays the Shepherd to him, wonder not that I weep; it is
for to water this Elm, and to make it grow in requital for the <U+017F>hadow it hath given
<hi>Charite</hi> when <U+017F>he fate under it. But alas! if thou would<U+017F>t know another cau<U+017F>e of my
weeping, it is that I have offended that fair one by thinking to put thy doctrine in
practice. It may be you have not carried your <U+017F>elf di<U+017F>creetly in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> and you have betray'd the my<U+017F>terie. How is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould do
ami<U+017F>s? <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>eeing I <U+017F>aid not one word to her which I cannot <U+017F>hew in very
good Authors. 'Tis therefore becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he is not <U+017F>o well read, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and
before you <U+017F>hould have entertained her in that manner, you <U+017F>hould have brought
her to read. There's the <U+017F>ecret! replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> But <U+017F>eeing you are the cau<U+017F>e of my
misfortune, you are obliged to find out <U+017F>ome remedy, and to make my peace with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43725:77"/>
her. I be<U+017F>eech you remon<U+017F>trate to her, that if <hi>I</hi> have <U+017F>poken of making the <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne,
I</hi> meant no hurt thereby: Is it not well known that heretofore men were
double; but that to puni<U+017F>h their iniquities, they were divided in two? That's the
rea<U+017F>on that every one is <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to find his other half, and by joyning it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
to make up a perfect creature. Now there may be a juncture without fin, as
that of wills and de<U+017F>ires: And I may well <U+017F>ay that was the manner I meant. And if
<hi>Charite</hi> abhor the<U+017F>e copulations, let her beware the judgment of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> He hath
given men notice, that if they return to their offending him, he will further divide
every half in two. Seeing <U+017F>he will not hear of joyning her<U+017F>elf, the Gods might ju<U+017F>tly
divide her in that manner: And do you think it would be a fine <U+017F>ight to <U+017F>ee her in
two parts, each of them having but half a no<U+017F>e, half a mouth, one eye, one ear, one
buttock, one thigh, and one foot, with which <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould go leaping like a Flea, and
<U+017F>traighten her<U+017F>elf up again like a Bob. 'Twere great pitty to <U+017F>ee her in that po<U+017F>ture,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t know <U+017F>o much: If you were to <U+017F>atisfie your love in the
enjoyment of her, you mu<U+017F>t bring tho<U+017F>e two parts together, which would be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ive
trouble: And then if you <U+017F>hould be jealous, con<U+017F>ider what means there
were to look to <U+017F>uch a woman; while you had one half with you in your own bed,
the other would be in your neighbours.</p>
            <p>After the<U+017F>e learned con<U+017F>iderations, <hi>Clarimond</hi> per<U+017F>waded the Shepherd <U+017F>o far
of the po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of qualifying <hi>Charites</hi> cruelty, that he got him home to eat <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.
Thence they took their way to <hi>Hircan's</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle, for diver<U+017F>ion <U+017F>ake, and went
all by ea<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing of the miracles the Magician did. When they were come
thither, <hi>Hircan</hi> carried them into the Garden, where <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had never been before.
When he <U+017F>aw it was <U+017F>o fair, it <U+017F>eem'd to him to be the re<U+017F>idence of the Spring, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and Autumn, becau<U+017F>e there was all <U+017F>orts of Flowers, and all <U+017F>orts of Fruits:
He thought that <hi>Hircan</hi> had for ever bani<U+017F>h'd the Winter thence by the force of
his charms. Being in a Walk which was broad and very clo<U+017F>e at the top, he was <U+017F>o
much taken with it, that <U+017F>tretching out his arms he cryes out, Ha fair Walk! thou
<U+017F>halt have of my Ver<U+017F>es, I <U+017F>wear it to thee; thou de<U+017F>erve<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cription
of thee <U+017F>ome time or other. Out of that he goes into a Bowre, built for to
elude the heat of the day: There he <U+017F>ees a Spring <U+017F>o well painted, that he <U+017F>ays to
the re<U+017F>t, Come not <U+017F>o neer, we <U+017F>hall be wet. And perceiving a Hor<U+017F>e excellently
well drawn in a field, he brake forth into this fu<U+017F>tian: See you how that hor<U+017F>e runs!
you will lo<U+017F>e him, <hi>Hircan;</hi> why do you not tie him to <U+017F>ome tree? He runs away
from him<U+017F>elf! he leaves him<U+017F>elf behind! While he was thus bu<U+017F>ie, <hi>Hircan</hi> turning
a little Cock, made the water i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out in good earne<U+017F>t out of a Plank below, by a
many holes, O wonder! cries out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> running away: I knew this Magician had
thwarted the cour<U+017F>e of nature: whereas in other places the water falls down from
heaven to earth, here it i<U+017F><U+017F>ues out of the earth, as if it would threaten heaven:
Or is it that this peece of earth will weep in its turn, for the pains which I
<U+017F>uffer?</p>
            <p>There was with <hi>Hircan</hi> a Cou<U+017F>in of his, called <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who was come to <U+017F>ee
him. He wondred much at what <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>aid, as never having heard any thing equally
extravagant. He took a<U+017F>ide one of the <U+017F>ervants, and ask'd whether he knew him.
He an<U+017F>wered, that he knew no more of him, then that he was one become a Fool
through an exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive love he bore to <hi>Catherine, Leonora's</hi> Chamber-maid. He was
yet more to <U+017F>eek; for he knew the Wench, and thought it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>o much love: He knew <U+017F>he was of a fair complexion, and that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
flaxen-hair'd; but <U+017F>he had in requital <U+017F>ome features in the face, which were
<U+017F>o far from hand<U+017F>om, as were <U+017F>ufficient to rai<U+017F>e her the e<U+017F>teem of deformed. He
therefore not being <U+017F>atisfied, <U+017F>pake to <hi>Hircan</hi> of it, who in few words acquainted
him with the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> When he under<U+017F>tood it, he goes and confidently <U+017F>ets
upon the Shepherd, <U+017F>aying to him, I hope you'll pardon my curio<U+017F>ity, if I ask you
who you are; For <U+017F>eeing you have an extraordinary manner of <U+017F>peaking, I am very
de<U+017F>irous to learn it: All tho<U+017F>e of whom <hi>I</hi> have enquired concerning it, can give me
no <U+017F>atisfaction at all. <hi>I</hi> never refu<U+017F>ed any man living what thou aske<U+017F>t me, <U+017F>ays the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43725:77"/>
Shepherd, know then that I am <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and let that <U+017F>uffice thee. That's not enough,
replies <hi>Fontenay;</hi> know then, replies the Shepherd, that I am a Lover of the fair
<hi>Charite.</hi> All this is nothing, <U+017F>ays the other to him: what Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion are you of?
What an importunate fellow art thou? <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> <U+017F>ee<U+017F>t thou not I am a <hi>Shepherd?</hi>
doth not my habit di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>o much? But that you may not quarrel with words,
nor take things literally, I tell thee, that I am not of the number of tho<U+017F>e ru<U+017F>ticks
who<U+017F>e re<U+017F>idence are the fields: I am of tho<U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e hi<U+017F>tories are committed to
<hi>Romances,</hi> which are every day made, and who<U+017F>e actions are repre<U+017F>ented by the
Players on their <U+017F>tages. In good faith Ma<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who could conceal
nothing he knew) I think you are the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>or of <hi>Don-Quixote</hi> of <hi>Manca,</hi> and
that you have inherited his folly. After he had been <hi>Knight-Errant,</hi> he would be
a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> but he dyed in the de<U+017F>ign; and I believe you would be Shepherd in his
<U+017F>tead, and continue his extravagancies. You lye, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I do nothing but of
my own invention, I never imitated him you <U+017F>peak of; and if I have read his hi<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it hath been by the way. He was a fool, who imagin'd him<U+017F>elf a Lover of <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinea,</hi>
when he had never <U+017F>een her: whereas I have the advantage to conver<U+017F>e with
<hi>Charite</hi> every day. He under<U+017F>tood nothing of the <U+017F>overaign <hi>felicity.</hi> 'Tis not in
Arms it will be found, there is nothing but trouble, and the minde thereby becomes
bruti<U+017F>h: 'Tis in keeping of Flocks, that there is profit and plea<U+017F>ure. <hi>Fontenay</hi> <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Shepherd beginning to be hot; to vex him the more, <U+017F>aid to him: Thou
give<U+017F>t me the lye, infamous wretch, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure thy <U+017F>elf thou <U+017F>halt give me <U+017F>atisfaction.
What do<U+017F>t thou think thy <U+017F>elf to be? thou art the contempt of all the world. That
<hi>Charite</hi> for whom thou <U+017F>ighe<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much, cares not for thee, and 'tis of me that <U+017F>he
is pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate: every day <U+017F>he courts me. and yet I will not be catch'd by her entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for I have a many other Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es hand<U+017F>omer then <U+017F>he.</p>
            <p>Here it was that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was all afire, he was making towards <hi>Fontenay</hi> to <U+017F>trike
him; but <hi>Hircan</hi> held him by the arm, and carried him a walking another way,
while <hi>Clarimond</hi> entertain'd his enemy. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ask'd <hi>Hircan,</hi> whether he had not
<U+017F>ome Magical gla<U+017F>s, wherein he might <U+017F>ee whether it were true that <hi>Fontenay</hi> was
beloved by his Shepherde<U+017F>s. <hi>Hircan</hi> told him, that he had broken his, out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
that he had once <U+017F>een a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of his in the arms of one of his Rivals,
and that he had not yet had the lea<U+017F>ure to make another; but that he could tell him
what he de<U+017F>ired to know, by <U+017F>ome otherwayes; and that if <hi>Fontenay</hi> had offended
him any way, he would <U+017F>ee him reveng'd of him. Thereupon he <U+017F>hew'd him a
little grove of his, and told him, that all tho<U+017F>e trees he <U+017F>aw had <U+017F>ometimes been men
that he had metamorphos'd, becau<U+017F>e they had done <U+017F>ome injury to him or his
friends, and that to inrich him<U+017F>elf in a moment, he found nothing <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie as to
make a forre<U+017F>t of his Enemies, which <U+017F>hould be full grown timber, and ready for
the ax. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who had a while before read <hi>Ovids</hi> Metamorpho<U+017F>es, where there
are things far more incredible, ea<U+017F>ily believ'd this. He re<U+017F>olv'd to be ever a friend
of <hi>Hircans,</hi> both that he might not hurt him, and might a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him to puni<U+017F>h tho<U+017F>e
that <U+017F>hould injure him.</p>
            <p>A while after, <hi>Hircan</hi> having carried the company into the hou<U+017F>e to a Collation,
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>aid not a word to <hi>Fontenay,</hi> contenting him<U+017F>elf not to look on him. <hi>Synopa</hi>
was there, who as <U+017F>he was as impudent as need be wi<U+017F>h'd, <U+017F>he went and <U+017F>aid to the
Shepherd before all that were pre<U+017F>ent, Ah! inhumane heart! wilt thou never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

any Pa<U+017F>torals <U+017F>een, wherein that hath not been ob<U+017F>erved: But it is withal to be noted,
that one day all <U+017F>hall be reconciled, and by the power of <U+017F>ome God, it <U+017F>hall come
to pa<U+017F>s, that every one <U+017F>hall love what he <U+017F>hould love, as it happens in the end of
every good hi<U+017F>tory, which ever concludes with marriage.</p>
            <p>Every one <U+017F>eem'd to admire the<U+017F>e excellent rea<U+017F>ons; <U+017F>o that <hi>L<U+017F>is</hi> thinking he
had <U+017F>poken mightily to the purpo<U+017F>e, was very well <U+017F>atisfied. Yet when he had left
<hi>Hircans</hi> hou<U+017F>e, there came <U+017F>omewhat into his memory, that animated him again<U+017F>t
<hi>Fontenay.</hi> Had it not been for that, he would have return'd back to the Magicians,
for he was not well <U+017F>atisfied with <hi>Clarimonds</hi> mother; but to remain where his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was, he could not by any means <U+017F>ubmit to. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having <U+017F>poken to him
of the injury he had receiv'd, heightned his <U+017F>pirit to revenge: <U+017F>o that he was much
to <U+017F>eek what he <U+017F>hould do. You mu<U+017F>t fight, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Clarimond,</hi> there's no other way;
<U+017F>end <hi>Fontenaie</hi> a Challenge, he is a man of his weapon, he'll meet you in the field.
I have diligently peru<U+017F>ed all books of <hi>Shepherdrie,</hi> replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but I never found
any Shepherd that fought a duel: And if any one hath taken Arms, as <hi>Celadons</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did, it was not well done, and it was a tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of our Ordinances. I am not
<U+017F>uch an enemy to Laws, as to be a tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F><U+017F>or of them, as he was; and yet it is
not out of Cowardize, for if it were to fight with Sheephooks, I <U+017F>hould be the fir<U+017F>t
in the charge: or if it were to be at <U+017F>lings, to ca<U+017F>t peeble <U+017F>tones, I <U+017F>hould make one,
it hath been my exerci<U+017F>e ever <U+017F>ince I was a little boy: There's nothing becomes us
better; and tis certain, <hi>David</hi> had but a <U+017F>ling to overcome <hi>Goliah.</hi> He was one of
the mo<U+017F>t eminent Shepherds in the world, and therefore mu<U+017F>t be imitated in all
things. You mu<U+017F>t then <U+017F>end <hi>Fontenaie</hi> word, that you will fight with him at the
<U+017F>ling, replyes <hi>Clarimond.</hi> Let's not be <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> it may be he'll come
and ask me pardon for the injury he hath done me.</p>
            <p>Upon the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es they retch'd <hi>Clarimonds</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle, where they found <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
return'd. 'Twas much be<U+017F>ides the expectation of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who thought that
<U+017F>trange face having gotten <U+017F>o much money of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> would have gone his way, and
not have brought him any <U+017F>heep, as many would have done in the like ca<U+017F>e. But
he was as good as his word; for he con<U+017F>ider'd that he could hardly meet with a
better fortune, then he expected from his new Ma<U+017F>ter, with whom he was to live as
his Peer and Companion. He bethought him, he was lodg'd in a Ca<U+017F>tle, whereas
before he under<U+017F>tood not any thing above a Cottage: and above all, he was much
pleas'd to eat at a Gentlemans Table, whereas before, he had hardly ever eaten a
meals meat, but in <U+017F>ome wretched Victualing hou<U+017F>e But what was yet more, he had
<U+017F>ometimes heard read <U+017F>ome few leaves of the <hi>Plea<U+017F>ures of a Pa<U+017F>toral life,</hi> the charms
whereof had fully captivated him. He had therefore been at a <U+017F>mall Market Town,
where he had bought a dozen <U+017F>heep dearer then they were worth, for he was not
much skil'd in the imployment. He had al<U+017F>o been at the Brokers, and chang'd a black
<U+017F>uit he had on, for a gray one, and had trim'd him<U+017F>elf <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thought him very <U+017F>pruce
and neat, though he was not fully <U+017F>hav'd, and had long mu<U+017F>tachoes; for he <U+017F>aid he
might ea<U+017F>ily take off that when he had a minde to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf into a maid, to go
and <U+017F>ee his Sweetheart: As for the Flock, though it was in an ill ca<U+017F>e, yet was he
<U+017F>atisfied with it, both in regard he was in <U+017F>uch impatience to have one, that he would
take the fir<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elf; and that he thought it a glory to feed it: <U+017F>o that
whereas it was now very lean, he would within a while make it very fat.</p>
            <p>After Supper he began to con<U+017F>ider, that <hi>Clarimonds</hi> mother did not bid him <U+017F>o
welcome as he expected as indeed it was true: the good Lady being much given
to zeal and devotion, was not well pleas'd to <U+017F>ee a fool at her Table. He conceiv'd
him<U+017F>elf oblig'd to take a Lodging el<U+017F>ewhere, and hire <U+017F>ome little Cottage for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
and <hi>Carmelin.</hi> This con<U+017F>ideration was accompanied with a many other de<U+017F>igns,
which requir'd <U+017F>udden execution: <U+017F>o that he call'd his man, and <U+017F>aid to him, Put
the Flock into the <U+017F>table, if it be not already, bring me my Gittarrhe, give me pen,

of his ma<U+017F>ter, who<U+017F>e commands were <U+017F>o far from a po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of execution, that they
could not well be under<U+017F>tood. But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> made his excu<U+017F>es for it, that being in his

            <p>

was mo<U+017F>t excellent and ravi<U+017F>hing; but that it was a far greater recreation for
one to decipher his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, whether it were in pro<U+017F>e or ver<U+017F>e. He was of the <U+017F>ame
opinion; and putting away his Gitarrhe, ask'd for pen and ink to write a Letter to
<hi>Charite.</hi> 'Twas a thing <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>o far nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, as it concern'd him to know how

all night about it, and did nothing but write down and blot out a thou<U+017F>and conceits;
but at la<U+017F>t he brought it to that pa<U+017F>s, as it <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>uffer any further alteration.
And though it was not yet day, he went and awoke <hi>Clarimond</hi> for to communicate

            <p>The Shepherd was wholly ravi<U+017F>h'd at the repetition of it, and prote<U+017F>ted he had
<U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s'd him<U+017F>elf in this Letter; and <hi>Clarimond</hi> avow'd as much, by rea<U+017F>on it was
full of a certain more then common ingenuity. And indeed he was in the right;
for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had many good Intervals, in which <U+017F>o many <hi>Idaeas</hi> thronging into his fancy,
it was very hard that now and then he <U+017F>hould not hit on <U+017F>omwhat that were good.
Certainly for this humour it was happy enough; and by this he lets us under<U+017F>tand
why a <hi>Love-Letter</hi> was call'd a <hi>Pullet,</hi> a thing which many that u<U+017F>e the word wholly
under<U+017F>tand not. <hi>Clarimond</hi> therefore having admir'd his invention, he was content to
believe it would find no le<U+017F>s e<U+017F>teem with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and that there was no hardne<U+017F>s
of heart whatever that this could not <U+017F>often. Nay, the agitations of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions
were <U+017F>uch, that he was in a <U+017F>trong belief that <hi>Charite</hi> would immediately command
him to attend her; nay he did not <U+017F>tick to <U+017F>ay, that if he were to pa<U+017F>s the Sea like
<hi>Leander</hi> to <U+017F>ee his <hi>Hero,</hi> he would do it cheerfully. But <hi>Clarimond</hi> envying him this
enjoyment, and de<U+017F>irous to affront the fable, <U+017F>aid, That the poor <hi>Leander</hi> mu<U+017F>t needs
be too cold, after having pa<U+017F>s'd an arm of the Sea, (as he did every time) to enjoy
his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; and that he mu<U+017F>t be a lu<U+017F>ty man indeed, if after all that he were <hi>ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant;</hi>
and that it had been better to have hired <U+017F>ome Barge to pa<U+017F>s from one <U+017F>hore
to another, or el<U+017F>e to have <U+017F>teer'd it him<U+017F>elf, and that for his part he knew no rea<U+017F>on
why he might not hide him<U+017F>elf all day in <U+017F>ome ob<U+017F>cure hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>omewhere neer the
lodgings of his fair <hi>Hero,</hi> that he might <U+017F>ave <U+017F>o much trouble, and be the fitter to
vi<U+017F>it her at night. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> replyed, that a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly that Lover wanted not his hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
to all this; and that though the <U+017F>tory was not the mo<U+017F>t probable in the world,
yet was it not to be mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ted as to the truth of it, being reported by <U+017F>o many good
Authors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was not willing to enlarge him<U+017F>elf in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e he was at this time
more imployd about bringing to pa<U+017F>s his own loves, then to con<U+017F>ider by what means
others enjoy'd theirs. Nay, <U+017F>o impatient was he, that he left <hi>Clarimond</hi> to <U+017F>eal his
Letter, and in all ha<U+017F>te call'd <hi>Carmelin</hi> to go carry it to <hi>Charite.</hi> But <hi>Carmelin</hi> was
<U+017F>o <U+017F>ound a<U+017F>leep, that he had much ado to make him wake. Thou lazie fellow, quoth
he, ha<U+017F>t thou a mind to bury both body and <U+017F>oul in the<U+017F>e fathers? See<U+017F>t thou not
that the Sun begins to <U+017F>catter his beams upon the vaults of heaven? He is now a
gilding of the Mountain-tops, and it will not be long ere he ki<U+017F>s the lowe<U+017F>t herbs:
Yea, the Husband-men withdraw out of the bo<U+017F>oms of their wives, where they had
<U+017F>lept as on a pillow; and the Birds warble out their acclamations, to welcome
the Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> being forc'd to awake, <U+017F>aw that indeed it was break of day; <U+017F>o that
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> gave him his Letter, with commands to carry it to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. He rubbing
his eyes, which by this time were half open, be<U+017F>eech'd him to tell him what kinde
of woman <U+017F>he was, and where he might finde her. If thou <U+017F>ee<U+017F>t her, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
thou wilt know her well enough; <U+017F>he is a Sun that enlightens all the world, and

            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> being in bed, heard all this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and call'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to him, telling him
that he did ill for to <U+017F>end <hi>Carmelin</hi> to carry a Love-Letter to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and that
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he might be beaten by the way. I can help all this, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I have
<U+017F>ometimes read a Bood, called <hi>The Temple of Venus,</hi> where there are many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<U+017F>ecrets for concealing of Letters; among others, that of <U+017F>ending them by
Doves, that will carry them. But it were too much for me to de<U+017F>cend to the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any; for upon better thoughts I finde, that I have another de<U+017F>ign much
better. The Chicken that run about <hi>Orontes</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, will now and then get out into
the <U+017F>treet; I will tie my Letter to one of their legs, and it <U+017F>hall carry it into the

               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:43725:79"/>

artifice, which for the pre<U+017F>ent is not at all nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. But, <U+017F>ays he, I know another
invention better then this: Your Shepherde<U+017F>s, you are to note, is a little <U+017F>weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipp'd;
when <U+017F>he is at <hi>Paris,</hi> <U+017F>he is ever eating of Penny-pyes; you had be<U+017F>t entreat

are not now in the City, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he hath chang'd her cu<U+017F>tom;
be<U+017F>ides that, <U+017F>uch <hi>Pullets</hi> as mine u<U+017F>e not to be put in Pa<U+017F>te. You are very much in

this for your Ma<U+017F>ter, that he doth not <U+017F>end you to be his Pimp, but on a ju<U+017F>t and an
hone<U+017F>t errand. It co<U+017F>ts not <U+017F>o much to call any thing by an honorable name, but <U+017F>ince
you are <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtil do your duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> left <hi>Clarimond,</hi> for our Shepherd would needs <U+017F>et his man a
little on his way. He caus'd the <U+017F>heep to be brought out of the fold, but wanting
a Sheephook, he was not a little di<U+017F>contented, yet had he no mind to <U+017F>end to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenors</hi>
for his own. But becau<U+017F>e he could not endure to be without one, he fell
upon this pretty imagination: he found a long painted <U+017F>taff, which he thought fit
for his purpo<U+017F>e; and having taken a card, he tyed it with a thread to the head of it.
Now, as Good-luck would have it, it fell out to be the <hi>Queen of Hearts,</hi> which
exceedingly pleas'd him; in<U+017F>omuch, as he did not <U+017F>tick to <U+017F>ay, that nothing could
better become that place, in re<U+017F>pect it put him in perpetual remembrance of his
Shepherde<U+017F>s, who was really the <hi>Queen</hi> of his <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>De<U+017F>ires.</hi> Furni<U+017F>h'd with
this Sheep-hook, he left <hi>Clarimonds,</hi> and with a Country man named <hi>Bertrand,</hi> <U+017F>it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at his cottage door, he enquir'd of him, whether he could lodge him, his man,
and his <U+017F>heep. The man reply'd, Yes; and <U+017F>hew'd him his lodgings, which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
lik'd very well. He agreed with him for five groats a week, be<U+017F>ides his promi<U+017F>e,
that for what bread and fruit he had of him, he <U+017F>hould be paid for daily: This
being concluded, he <U+017F>hew'd his man which was the way to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
implor'd the favour and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> parted with him. He got
up on a little hillock, and thence look'd after him, as long as he could perceive him;
but having lo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ight of him, he began to be afraid he might not do his errand;
for he con<U+017F>idered, that <hi>Charite's</hi> name was <hi>Catherine du Verger,</hi> and he was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
troubled, that he had not told his <U+017F>ervant her true name, that he might the
more ea<U+017F>ily make his addre<U+017F>s to her. However, he could not repent of what he had
done, when he remembred him<U+017F>elf that he was oblig'd by a vow made to <hi>Love,</hi> not
to name his fair dear otherwi<U+017F>e then by the incomparable name of <hi>Charite:</hi> So that
falling into the depth of Extravagancy, he per<U+017F>waded him<U+017F>elf that her name was
really <hi>Charite,</hi> and that <U+017F>he was call'd <U+017F>o of all that knew her. As this quieted him
not a little, <U+017F>o he fell into very chearful thoughts; and fain'd to him<U+017F>elf, that there
was no doubt but <hi>Charite</hi> would receive his Letter, and the contents thereof would
be <U+017F>o happy, as to be the Object of her Eye, and the Subject of her Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

Mean while his Flock fed where it found any thing to feed on; and as good luck
would have it, a great Dog came into the way, as it were on purpo<U+017F>e to keep them.
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had <U+017F>o much wit, as that when he came from <hi>Clarimond's,</hi> he had furni<U+017F>h'd his
Scrip with a great piece of bread, which unknown to the <U+017F>ervants had been left out
of the Bing. He threw a piece of it to the Dog; and having clapp'd him o'th' back
and <U+017F>pat in's mouth, pre<U+017F>ently grew acquainted with him. So good friends they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> made account he was fully his <U+017F>ervant; <U+017F>o that he had no other
care to take for him, then to give him a name worthy of both the dog and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter.
This imployed his whole under<U+017F>tanding; and con<U+017F>idering that he was to name
him according to his qualities, he could not re<U+017F>olve whether to call him <hi>Tru<U+017F>ty, Stout,</hi>
or <hi>Watch.</hi> But all the<U+017F>e names being common, and therefore not <U+017F>uiting with his
humour, after profound meditation he light on this excellent one. The dog was
all <hi>white,</hi> only that he had the muzzle <hi>red</hi> This fell very fit for his thoughts; <U+017F>o
that he call'd him <hi>Muzedor,</hi> that is, a <hi>muzzle</hi> of <hi>gold,</hi> or a golden muzzle. <hi>I</hi> need
not tell you how proud he was of this brave adventure; for he remembred that
he had read in <U+017F>ome <hi>Romances</hi> the name of <hi>Mu<U+017F>edorus,</hi> which (<U+017F>etting a<U+017F>ide the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
which he gave it) <U+017F>ignifies in <hi>Greek</hi> the <hi>gift</hi> of the <hi>Mu<U+017F>es.</hi> This brought
him to <U+017F>uch an opinion of him<U+017F>elf, that he thought him<U+017F>elf able to give names to as
many per<U+017F>ons as could <U+017F>tand in the Plains of <hi>Beau<U+017F><U+017F>e;</hi> and conceiting him<U+017F>elf at this
happine<U+017F>s of invention, he thought fit to be<U+017F>tow a name upon every piece of his
equipage. He bethought him, <U+017F>eeing the <hi>Knights-Errant,</hi> whom he e<U+017F>teemed no
other then fools and mad-men, took a liberty to give names to their <hi>hor<U+017F>es</hi> and
<hi><U+017F>words;</hi> that <hi>Shepherds,</hi> who were far their betters, <U+017F>hould not be depriv'd the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of giving names to their <hi>Dogs, Sheep-hooks,</hi> and <hi>Scrips.</hi> 'Twas not certain
whether his Sheep-hook had <U+017F>ometime belong'd to a Country-Mona<U+017F>tery, or that
<hi>Clarimond</hi> had made u<U+017F>e of it in a Ma<U+017F>que, wherein he repre<U+017F>ented <hi>Thyr<U+017F>is:</hi> Certain
it was, that it was painted <hi>green,</hi> and <hi>gilt</hi> in <U+017F>ome places; <U+017F>o that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thought fit
to call it <hi>Green-gilt,</hi> or <hi>Gilt-green:</hi> And both tho<U+017F>e names <U+017F>eeming to him very
proper, it rais'd a mighty controver<U+017F>ie in him which he <U+017F>hould take. Till he could
ab<U+017F>olutely decide the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, he thought be<U+017F>t to keep both; and while he was in
the<U+017F>e thoughts, he went on <U+017F>till, driving his <U+017F>heep before him. There was one of
them broke into a Vineyard, the re<U+017F>t follow'd; and after all the Dog, who fell
pre<U+017F>ently to the grapes. The Shepherd him<U+017F>elf could not refrain, but broke his fa<U+017F>t
on them: But as he was picking up and down, not thinking what he was doing, <U+017F>o
much was he taken up with his <hi>names,</hi> there comes a rude Churl with a halbard in
his hand, and takes him by the collar, and <U+017F>ays to him, Come your way to pri<U+017F>on
immediately, you <U+017F>hall pay damage for this; is it no more with you to eat what
belongs to poor people? <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> endeavoured what he could to get out of his hands;
but there came up two other Country-fellows, who al<U+017F>o laid hold on him, <U+017F>o that
he thought it not <U+017F>afe to <U+017F>tand out any longer. What's this? <U+017F>ayes one of them,
(<U+017F>eeing the <U+017F>heep and dog) he hath brought his Cattel al<U+017F>o into the vineyard; they
<U+017F>hall be our <U+017F>atisfaction. He <U+017F>eeing that two were enough to conduct <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> left
him to his companions, and brought on the Flock after them: As for the Dog, he
al<U+017F>o follow'd barking at them that held his ma<U+017F>ter. Do me the favour at lea<U+017F>t to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
me without noi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ays the <hi>Shepherd:</hi> You need not hold me, I'll go quietly,
provided you'll tell me what place you intend to lodge me in, <U+017F>eeing you make me
run <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t. Do you not <U+017F>ee that I am a Vineyard-keeper? (<U+017F>ays the Fellow with
the halbard:) If we do not meet with out Judge to take order with you, we mu<U+017F>t
put you in pri<U+017F>on till he come. Take heed what thou do<U+017F>t, royal Vineyard-keeper,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I know not before what Judge thou wilt bring me; but know that
I acknowledge none but <hi>Pan,</hi> in whatever concerns Shepherds: I will not be judg'd
by men, nor yet by women, out of who<U+017F>e hands I e<U+017F>caped when I was <hi>Amaryllis:</hi>
There are none but the Gods above me; for even when I was at St. <hi>Clou,</hi> I was my
<U+017F>elf Judge in a ca<U+017F>e between <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Geneura.</hi> And as for the pri<U+017F>on, alas!
where can<U+017F>t thou find one narrower to put me in then that I am in already for the
fair <hi>Charite?</hi> Howbeit let us go forward, to <U+017F>ee what will be <U+017F>aid to us.</p>

            <p>After this he went along with the Country fellows without any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. And
as the Towns are very neer one to the other in <hi>Brie,</hi> they had not gone a quarter
of a league, but they came to certain Country-hou<U+017F>es, out of one whereof there
comes a <hi>Pettyfogger</hi> with a beard like a Goat, a no<U+017F>e like a Turky-cock, with white
Breeches, a Doublet of black <U+017F>erge, and a Hat that required no great labour to be
<U+017F>caled. He was the Judge of the place under <hi>Hircan,</hi> who was Lord of the <U+017F>oil, and
had all manner of juri<U+017F>diction civil and criminal in tho<U+017F>e parts.</p>
            <p>The Keeper perceiving him, told him how he had found <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in the vineyard,
and what <U+017F>poil he made there. But the Shepherd pre<U+017F>ently a<U+017F><U+017F>uming the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.
Are we not in the <U+017F>econd Golden age? <U+017F>ays he to him; Ought not all the fruits of
the earth to be common? Be<U+017F>ides, among <hi>Shepherds</hi> as we are, <U+017F>hould there be any
regard to <hi>Laws,</hi> which are only made for <U+017F>trangers?</p>
            <p>The Judge apprehended not any thing of all this, and was ready to pa<U+017F>s a <U+017F>evere
<U+017F>entence again<U+017F>t him: But as good fortune was, <hi>Hircan,</hi> who had been a hunting,
pa<U+017F>s'd by. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having perceived him, leap'd for joy, and thought that the dogs
that were about him were a Kennel of Devils that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted him. Deliver me, <U+017F>ays
he to him, out of the hands of the<U+017F>e Savages here! when I was a Maid, a Woman
judg'd me; and now that I am a Man, <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t be be judg'd by a Man. This is a
great di<U+017F>honouring of <hi>Love,</hi> who is the King of my <U+017F>oul; and of <hi>Pan,</hi> who is the
King of my body and goods. <hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was in a deal of trouble, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>et at liberty. They <U+017F>aid he had eaten their grapes: But <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
making an<U+017F>wer that that was no great matter, they were forc'd to obey their
Lord. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having his <U+017F>heep at his own di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al again, call'd his Dog to him, who
came and fawn'd on him. So that <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf in a po<U+017F>ture to return into the fields,
he took leave of the Magician, who had <U+017F>o <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably delivered him now this <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, and was infinitely pleas'd to have met with the opportunity to do him
that courte<U+017F>ie.</p>
            <p>While he drove his Flock a feeding up and down, <hi>Carmelin</hi> had almo<U+017F>t recover'd
<hi>Orontes</hi>'s Ca<U+017F>tle, and asked for the Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Charite</hi> of all that he met. He could
not learn any thing of her, only he was told that <hi>Orontes</hi> had had a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> but
he had neither wife nor daughter. He was much troubled at this, <U+017F>o that he de<U+017F>pair'd
to get any tidings of her. Keeping <U+017F>till on his way, he comes neer <hi>Hircan's</hi> Wood,
where <hi>Synopa</hi> and another Gentlewoman were walking. When <U+017F>he perceiv'd him,
<U+017F>he ask'd him whether he went, and whom he belong'd to. I belong to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> replies he, and I think my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is with you: I think you are the
Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Charite:</hi> for you have there a fine Comb-ca<U+017F>e, and a fine white Apron.
<hi>Synopa</hi> being very de<U+017F>irous to know what me<U+017F><U+017F>age <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>ent his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, re<U+017F>olv'd

him a<U+017F>ide to know what his errand was. He freely delivered her the Letter, which
<U+017F>he had no <U+017F>ooner read, but to make <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> de<U+017F>pair, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ays to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> Return to
thy ma<U+017F>ter, and tell him that which he will not be glad to know, that is, that my

but di<U+017F>dain: As for the <hi>Pullet</hi> he mentions, unle<U+017F>s it be good to make a <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F><U+017F>ee</hi>

            <p>With that <U+017F>he turn her back on <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who wi<U+017F>h'd he had not met her, and
thought it better not to carry his ma<U+017F>ter any news at all, then to bring him ill. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he returns, and having found him, he <U+017F>imply related to him all the Shepherde<U+017F>s

him<U+017F>elf be <U+017F>ilent for a long time, lying along on the ground as a man half dead?
At length he ri<U+017F>es up, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Carmelin</hi> went here and there as if he look'd for
<U+017F>omewhat, he ask'd him what he wanted? I look for a Spring, where I might get

            <p>Hereupon <hi>Carmelin</hi> endeavoured to comfort him: but <U+017F>eeing he did but lo<U+017F>e his

was neer retiring, yet would he not <U+017F>tir from the place; and that he would patiently

ob<U+017F>tinacie, went and <U+017F>tabled the Flock at the Coutry-mans where they were to
lodge, and return'd to him with a good piece of bread, and a quarter of a pound of

to leave him there to be eaten by the wolves, if the De<U+017F>tinies had <U+017F>o ordained it.

<U+017F>hould have no more light then that of <hi>Aurora,</hi> from
morning to night, by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s which the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
were in for his misfortune. But that imagination did
but increa<U+017F>e his torment; <U+017F>o that he was re<U+017F>olv'd to make
<U+017F>uch loud complaints, that <hi>Charite</hi> might hear them from
the hou<U+017F> where <U+017F>he lived, which was a good league off. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
who was wont to walk a little as <U+017F>oon as he was
up, heard his cryes, as being not far from the place; and accidentally meeting <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
at the <U+017F>ame time, he learn'd of him the de<U+017F>pair of his Ma<U+017F>ter. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
went both to him, whither when they were come: What, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond</hi> to
him, will you continue there <U+017F>till? Shepherd, of what do you intend to <hi>live?</hi> Alas!
replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> ask me rather what I <U+017F>hall <hi>dye</hi> of; and I will an<U+017F>wer you, I will dye
of <hi>Love.</hi> I do not hope any thing from <hi>Charite,</hi> <U+017F>he abhors me, and will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to hear me <U+017F>poken of.</p>
            <p>Thereupon <hi>Clarimond</hi> ask'd <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whether <hi>Charite</hi> was <U+017F>o cruel in good
earne<U+017F>t. If you had <U+017F>een her when <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke to me, replyes <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you would
have taken her for a Tygre<U+017F>s in a womans dre<U+017F>s; but it mu<U+017F>t be withal confe<U+017F>t, that
<U+017F>he was the faire<U+017F>t Tygre<U+017F>s that ever was <U+017F>een. Her eyes did <U+017F>o <U+017F>parkle, that as I have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43725:82"/>
heard from my Ma<U+017F>ter, and other amorous per<U+017F>ons, they <U+017F>eem'd to be a fire; and
I did really imagine that they did ca<U+017F>t <U+017F>quibs and crackers at me, as the Boys u<U+017F>e to
do at mid-Summer. See there, Is not that it I ever believ'd? <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>he was
then po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t by that <U+017F>pirit of choler which is ever about her. It is long <U+017F>ince that
<U+017F>he hath threatned to con<U+017F>ume me. But O ye Gods! you have ordain'd otherwi<U+017F>e
of me, and your Revelations this night have taught me, that your plea<U+017F>ure is I
<U+017F>hould be ranked among the <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es,</hi> that I might be added to tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Ovid.</hi>
This is no delu<U+017F>ion <hi>Clarimond;</hi> you might have ob<U+017F>erved, that when ever the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
know not what to do with a man, and yet would <U+017F>hew compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on his <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
they change him into <U+017F>ome new form. I believe it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and <U+017F>ince
it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o, let us con<U+017F>ider how to bring about things, and we <U+017F>hall finde all will
be well. Take you <U+017F>uch a cour<U+017F>e, as that of a di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate and a de<U+017F>perate Lover, as
you are now, you may be chang'd into a free and contented man, that you may
with as much ea<U+017F>e <U+017F>light this your ingrateful Shepherde<U+017F>s, as <U+017F>he doth you, and
that will be a very excellent <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es.</hi> You do not apprehend this Mi<U+017F>tery,
replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for in<U+017F>tead of being chang'd into the contrary, the change is ever
into <U+017F>ome thing that <U+017F>uits with the former humor. As for example, a Thief <U+017F>hall
be transform'd into <U+017F>ome ravenous Bird; a cozening companion, into a Fox; and
a tractable per<U+017F>on into a <U+017F>heep. Now that I am upon the point of lo<U+017F>ing my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<U+017F>hape, I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly put my <U+017F>elf into <U+017F>ome good humor, that I may not
be Metamoaphos'd into <U+017F>ome unplea<U+017F>ing creature. However, I have one <U+017F>ecret <U+017F>hall
bring me into a great e<U+017F>teem; and it is this, I will not take a form that any other
hath already had, and my de<U+017F>ire is, to have a Metamorpho<U+017F>is, that was never yet
talk'd of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> had already di<U+017F>cover'd, that his Ma<U+017F>ter and his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es were at a di<U+017F>tance;
but yet he did not think they were gone <U+017F>o far a<U+017F>tray, as that he <U+017F>hould imagine <U+017F>uch
gro<U+017F>s Extravagancies. Neverthele<U+017F>s, <U+017F>eeing <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly li<U+017F>tening to him,
and calling to minde what he had heard <U+017F>poken of the ancient <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es,</hi> his
piercing inginuity was at a lo<U+017F>s what to think of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having by this time made an end of <U+017F>ighing and <U+017F>obbing, lifted up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
a little, and bid <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>it by him. Well, come, <U+017F>ayes he to him, let's put
the ca<U+017F>e that the Gods will give me the liberty to choo<U+017F>e the form I am to take,
what will you advi<U+017F>e me to? for my part, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> if your ca<U+017F>e were mine,
I <U+017F>hould wi<U+017F>h to become a little <hi>Shock. Charite</hi> would <hi>ki<U+017F>s</hi> you, would <hi>trim</hi> you,
would <hi>feed</hi> you out of her own hand, and you <U+017F>hould <hi>lie</hi> with her. Do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
a little what plea<U+017F>ure you <U+017F>hould have. That's hand<U+017F>omly propos'd, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
but there is a dog already in the hou<U+017F>e, again<U+017F>t whom the Cats, which are at lea<U+017F>t
<U+017F>even or eight, are in perpetual ho<U+017F>tility, and do often give him <U+017F>uch clawing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
as he takes very unkindely. I <U+017F>hould not be well pleas'd to be <U+017F>cratch'd
in that manner by them. Be then Metamorpos'd into a <hi>Flea,</hi> replyes <hi>Clarimond,</hi>
you <U+017F>hall leap up and down her body, you <U+017F>hall go into the bo<U+017F>om of your Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s,
and thence a little lower, the re<U+017F>t I leave it to your <U+017F>elf to imagine. But
if <hi>Charite</hi> catch me, replyes the Shepherd, <U+017F>hall I be proof again<U+017F>t her nails; and
then what will become of poor <hi>Ly<U+017F>is?</hi> I am not for any of all the<U+017F>e, I think there
is nothing better then to be turn'd to <U+017F>omething without life; for then no body
meddles with one, but I am <U+017F>uffered to la<U+017F>t as long as I can. I do not <U+017F>peak of Plants,
for they live; I mean <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort of moveables and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary things; as for in<U+017F>tance,
a <hi>Looking-gla<U+017F>s,</hi> and that form I think very fit for me, for I have already <hi>Charite's</hi>
picture drawn in my heart. I <U+017F>hould repre<U+017F>ent her face as well pre<U+017F>ent as ab<U+017F>ent;
but withal, I would not receive any other images, and it <U+017F>hould be in vain for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to come to look in me. Now when one is thus chang'd into a moveable, one
is not for that in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, but the <U+017F>oul retires into <U+017F>ome corner. Ma<U+017F>ter, without
di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing you, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I have as excellent inventions on this occa<U+017F>ion as
your <U+017F>elf. Change your <U+017F>elf into a <hi>Smoak,</hi> and <U+017F>o you <U+017F>hall touch the delicate skin
of your <hi>Charite,</hi> or el<U+017F>e into <U+017F>ome <hi>Gorget,</hi> and you <U+017F>hall touch her brea<U+017F>ts, and
<U+017F>he will wa<U+017F>h you with her own hands! methinks it would come very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43725:82"/>
for you are grown very foul by lying on the ground to night. But a better then any
is to be chang'd into a <hi>Knife:</hi> I'll be the <hi>Pedlar</hi> that will go and <U+017F>ell you to her, and
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hall put you into her own <U+017F>heath, and wear you at the <U+017F>ide of her virginity:
That were indeed a fair transformation! Thou ha<U+017F>t given over to <U+017F>peak learnedly,
<hi>Carmelin!</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I believe the vexation thou art in to <U+017F>ee me thus afflicted,
hath caus'd thee <U+017F>ome lo<U+017F>s of wit. Thy two fir<U+017F>t Changes, methinks, are not glorious
enough for me; and for the la<U+017F>t, it is a mo<U+017F>t impertinent one, and very dangerous.
See<U+017F>t thou not that if I were a Knife, it might happen that I might cut the fingers
of my <hi>Charite,</hi> which I <U+017F>hould be infinitely <U+017F>orry for. Do not thou interpo<U+017F>e thy,
<U+017F>elf any more in this affair: Go immediately home, and bring away my Flock, or
rather thy own, into the fields.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> was forc'd to obey his Ma<U+017F>ters command. He was no <U+017F>ooner gone, but
<hi>Hircan,</hi> who was taking a walk all alone to <U+017F>ee his friend <hi>Clarimond,</hi> came into the
very place. Being perceived by <hi>Clarimond,</hi> he <U+017F>aid not a word, becau<U+017F>e he would not
interrupt <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; and be<U+017F>ide, he <U+017F>aw the other made <U+017F>igns to him to that
purpo<U+017F>e. <hi>Hircan</hi> coming <U+017F>oftly behind the Shepherd, to frighten him a little,
would needs turn his hat round; but he gave it <U+017F>uch a turn, that he to<U+017F>s'd it into the
branches of a <hi>Willow</hi> that was over again<U+017F>t him, where it <U+017F>tuck fa<U+017F>t. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being
turn'd about towards <hi>Hircan,</hi> gave him but a <U+017F>light <U+017F>alute, becau<U+017F>e he had no de<U+017F>ire
to laugh: He would needs have his Hat again, though he imagin'd him<U+017F>elf on the
point not to have any further occa<U+017F>ion for it. As ill luck would have it, neither
<hi>Clarimond</hi> nor <hi>Hircan</hi> had any <U+017F>tick to beat it down, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> had carried
away the <U+017F>heep-hook with him to bring the Flock abroad. The Willow-tree was
<U+017F>omwhat high; yet he made a <U+017F>hift to get up, by putting his foot into <U+017F>ome holes
that age and rottenne<U+017F>s had made in it: But as his <U+017F>tretch'd out his arm to reach his
hat, he <U+017F>lides down <U+017F>uddenly and falls into the hollow of the tree, which time had
<U+017F>o gnawn, that there was place enough for a man. There was nothing in <U+017F>ight of
him but his head and his arms, which he <U+017F>tretch'd on both <U+017F>ides to take hold of two
great branches; and being in this po<U+017F>ture, he began to cry out thus: There needs
no more con<U+017F>iderations, <hi>Clarimond!</hi> the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is effected; 'tis to no purpo<U+017F>e
now to deliberate in what manner I <U+017F>hall be metamorphos'd, it is the plea<U+017F>ure of my
De<U+017F>tiny I <U+017F>hould be chang'd into a <hi>Tree.</hi> O god! I feel my <hi>legs</hi> grow longer, and
begin to change into <hi>roots,</hi> and <U+017F>pread them<U+017F>elves into the earth; my <hi>arms</hi> are now
<hi>boughs,</hi> and my <hi>fingers branches,</hi> I already <U+017F>ee the leaves <U+017F>prouting out; my <hi>fle<U+017F>h</hi>
and <hi>bones</hi> are chang'd into <hi>wood,</hi> and my <hi>skin</hi> hardens, and is chang'd into <hi>bark.</hi> O
ye ancient <hi>Lovers,</hi> that have been Metamorphos'd, I <U+017F>hall henceforward be of
your quality, and I <U+017F>hall be eternally celebrated as well as you in the works of the
<hi>Poets!</hi> O my dear friends who are pre<U+017F>ent, receive my la<U+017F>t farewell, I am not any
more to be reckon'd among men!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> were <U+017F>o amaz'd to hear him break out in that manner, that
they knew not what to <U+017F>ay of <U+017F>uch an Extravagancy. At la<U+017F>t <hi>Clarimond</hi> approaches
the tree, and <U+017F>aies to the Shepherd, Come out thence; <U+017F>hall I help you out? when
you are once out, you'll finde you are what you were always. The heavens hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me to come hence, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and you may perceive the bark that a<U+017F>cends
by little and little, and will immediately cover my mouth, <U+017F>o that I <U+017F>hall not be
able to <U+017F>peak any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>eeing this folly, thought <hi>Hircan</hi> the cau<U+017F>e of it, and that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
him a Magican, believed withal, that he had bound him up in that tree. He
therefore <U+017F>oftly entreated him to retire; and when he was at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance off, he
did his utmo<U+017F>t endeavour to per<U+017F>wade the Shepherd to come out of the place where
he was, but he prevailed nothing with him; for he an<U+017F>wered him only with <hi><U+017F>ighs;</hi>
and bu<U+017F>ied not his minde, but in certain imaginations, which mu<U+017F>t needs have been
the mo<U+017F>t remarkable in the world. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having be<U+017F>tow'd an hour in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring
to deliver him out his Extravagancy, return'd home, where he found
<hi>Hircan,</hi> who kept his mother company. Having broke fa<U+017F>t together, they took
hor<U+017F>e, and went to vi<U+017F>it <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> and to acquaint them with the
<U+017F>trange adventure of the Shepherd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:43725:83"/>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> in the mean time, who had been gone to bring the flock abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his Shepherd-apprenti<U+017F>hip, and de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee his Ma<U+017F>ter, drew towards the
place, where he had left him. He was not a little amaz'd to finde him in a Willow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree;
and having ask'd him what he did there, the Shepherd replies, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
all the propo<U+017F>itions of Metamorpho<U+017F>es that had been made before, the
Gods had chang'd him into a tree. O Ma<U+017F>ter! <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you mi<U+017F>take your
<U+017F>elf, your face is as fair as ever it was. Do but come out, and you will finde you
are <U+017F>till a man. Behold, there's your hat among the bows. I'll bring it down with
my <U+017F>heephook: will you not have it on your head? you'll catch cold el<U+017F>e. Alas!
that which thou take<U+017F>t for a mans head, is the great end of my <hi>Boal.</hi> It is not the
cu<U+017F>tom to cover it, neither with hat nor night-cap, for it would hinder it to grow:
I mu<U+017F>t henceforth be always in the ayr. Why do you believe you have no head,
replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> do I not <U+017F>ee your hair, which is frizzled like the wool of one
of our <U+017F>heep? Thou art deceiv'd friend, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> 'tis not <hi>hair</hi> but <hi>mo<U+017F>s.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
this <hi>re<U+017F>uerie,</hi> which <hi>Carmelin</hi> could not comprehend, he beat down
the hat, and made a <U+017F>hift to put it on his Ma<U+017F>ters head. But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>hrug'd him<U+017F>elf
<U+017F>o, that it fell down. You are very ob<U+017F>tinate, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> why will you not
put on your hat, though you are become a Tree? you have your doublet and
breeches on, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e. Alas! friend, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> if I had had my hat on when
I was Metamorphos'd, I <U+017F>hould have had it <U+017F>till, nor would I de<U+017F>ire it <U+017F>hould be
taken from me but I had it not; <U+017F>o that now it is not fit I <U+017F>hould wear any. My
meaning is you <U+017F>hould put it on now, becau<U+017F>e you are <U+017F>till a man, as well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as any between this place and <hi>Paris,</hi> replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and I give it you not
as you are tree; for if you were really one, neither <U+017F>hould you have any need of
cloathes; and to prove that you are <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I <U+017F>hall bring you no other
rea<U+017F>on, then that you are <U+017F>till clad like a Shepherd, and that if you were a tree, you
ought to to be <U+017F>tript of all your cloathes. Wo is me! how ab<U+017F>urd thy rea<U+017F>ons are,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> I <U+017F>ee well thou <U+017F>peake<U+017F>t for thy own advantage: Thou would<U+017F>t fain take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
my Shepherds habit, that thou might<U+017F>t go and <U+017F>el it in the Brokery at <hi>Paris,</hi> and
advance thy <U+017F>elf by what thou <U+017F>poile<U+017F>t me of; but a<U+017F><U+017F>ure thy <U+017F>elf, thou <U+017F>halt never
have it. It's become part of my <U+017F>elf, and it is now nothing but a thick bark, which
is upon my skin; which being a more tender one, is covered with this, as thou
maye<U+017F>t ordinarily ob<U+017F>erve in trees. Upon <U+017F>uch skins the ancients wrote, before the
invention of paper: Yet I do not tell thee this, to the end thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t come
and disbark me for to write Letters to thy Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. I am a <U+017F>acred <hi>Tree,</hi> which may
not be touch'd, but by the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Charite,</hi> and it is principally to the <U+017F>ervice of
that fair one, that I am devoted. She may come and grave her characters upon
my trunk: I will <U+017F>uffer it without groaning. I under<U+017F>tand not all this, replies <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin:</hi>
though you your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>hould be changed, I <U+017F>hall never believe that your
cloathes are <U+017F>o too; for what have they to do with your <hi>Loves?</hi> have they receiv'd
ill entertainment from <U+017F>ome Shepherde<U+017F>s? Thou under<U+017F>tande<U+017F>t not the Divine <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> if thou had<U+017F>t, read <hi>Ovid,</hi> who is the mo<U+017F>t famous <hi>Divine</hi> among
the <hi>Poets,</hi> thou might<U+017F>t have learn'd, that the <hi>cloathes</hi> are ever Metamorphos'd, as
well as the <hi>body:</hi> and when he <U+017F>peaks of a man changed into a <hi>Flower,</hi> a <hi>Spring,</hi> or
a <hi>Bird,</hi> he doth not <U+017F>ay he was <U+017F>trip'd beforehand. Nay, when <hi>Atlas</hi> was chang'd
into a Mountain, his long gown, that had many folds, made many de<U+017F>cents and
<U+017F>tony eminences therein. Read good Authors, and thou wilt importune me le<U+017F>s with
thy fooli<U+017F>h demands. I am almo<U+017F>t per<U+017F>waded of all this; but that which troubles
me mo<U+017F>t, and indeed makes me <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o much, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> is, that I mu<U+017F>t now
quit all the hopes I had of you. I <U+017F>hall not enjoy tho<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ures with you, which
you promi<U+017F>ed me I <U+017F>hould. That's it will make me grieve a good while.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Carmelin</hi> made many complaints, which were very natural; for his wit
lay in <U+017F>uch a way, that it might <U+017F>eem he came into the world to no other end, but
to make others laugh; and abating ten or a dozen <U+017F>entences out of Common-places,
which he had learned as a bird in cage, he knew nothing but a kinde of ru<U+017F>tick <U+017F>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,
wherein he was <U+017F>harp enough. He <U+017F>poke enough to have moved his Ma<U+017F>ter,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43725:83"/>
but Love had <U+017F>o di<U+017F>turb'd his brains, that he could not approve any thing, but his
own imaginations. Two or three hours <U+017F>lipt away in their entertainment; and at
length there comes <hi>An<U+017F>elme, Montenor</hi> and <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who had made ha<U+017F>te to dine,
for to come and <U+017F>ee <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> As for <hi>Hircan,</hi> he had been entreated to go home, le<U+017F>t
his pre<U+017F>ence might be a torment to that poor Shepherd. They began to remon<U+017F>trate
to him, that it was wor<U+017F>e then to be hypo condriack, for him to imagine as he did,
him<U+017F>elf changed into a tree, when he was as much a man as any of them. When
they <U+017F>aw he per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in his opinion, they bid the Lacquays fetch <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tools, on
which when they were gotten, they endeavoured by force to pull him out of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<U+017F>eeing he would not come out by fair means. That made him cleave fa<U+017F>ter to
the boughs then before, and cry out <U+017F>o loud, that <hi>Mu<U+017F>edor,</hi> that was <U+017F>till with
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> began to bark at tho<U+017F>e that drew him. Ah! faithful Dog, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
thou ha<U+017F>t that <U+017F>impathy in thee, that though I am not a man thou knowe<U+017F>t me. Take
example by him, you that have <U+017F>ometimes been my friends; have at lea<U+017F>t as much
compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on me as he. Will you own le<U+017F>s pitty then a bea<U+017F>t? Per<U+017F>ecute me no
more.</p>
            <p>After this complaint, he cries out louder then at fir<U+017F>t, and kept him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>till <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t
to the tree, that they con<U+017F>idered they <U+017F>hould rather pull off his arms, then get him
out of the place, for he was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with <U+017F>uch a fury, as made him mighty <U+017F>trong.
His good friends were loath to hurt him, and <U+017F>o gave over, to bethink them of
<U+017F>ome better invention for to get him out of the tree. They <U+017F>ent for a faggot, and
<U+017F>et it a fire near the Willow, as if they intended to burn it. That did nothing, but
make him double his complaints, and cry out as if he already felt the flame, and think
it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible ever to come out. When they perceiv'd that the <U+017F>moak blinded him,
they cau<U+017F>ed the fire to put out; and <hi>Clarimond</hi> having called for a Wood-feller, he
bid him cut down the Willow, <U+017F>eeing <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would not out. At the fir<U+017F>t blow of
the Ax, the Shepherd gave a <U+017F>hreak, that I believe might have been heard three
leagues about; and afterward <U+017F>pake thus, Ah! impious fellow, what do<U+017F>t thou?
I am a tree con<U+017F>ecrated to <hi>Diana.</hi> Iron never did me any violence; I was as pure
a Virgin as my Godde<U+017F>s. Fear<U+017F>t thou not a clap of thunder will con<U+017F>ume thee?
Let live a poor Shepherd under this bark, he doth thee no hurt here.</p>
            <p>Upon that, <hi>Clarimond</hi> bethought him to ask him, What Shepherd! have you
forgotten what you <U+017F>aid to me erewhiles? you affirmed to me, that the bark was
a<U+017F>cending over your mouth, and that you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak no more, and now we <U+017F>ee
the quite contrary. If you are a Tree, you <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>peak; the other Trees
hereabouts <U+017F>ay nothing at all. Do<U+017F>t not thou al<U+017F>o perceive that I am an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Tree? replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I am not like my neighbours; I am a Prophet, like tho<U+017F>e
Trees in <hi>Dodona's Grove;</hi> and that is the rea<U+017F>on the Gods have continued me the
u<U+017F>e of my voyce: Ask me any thing, I <U+017F>hall make thee a pertinent an<U+017F>wer. This
place <U+017F>hall henceforth be more frequented then the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and I <U+017F>hall
be an Oracle to all the world. For my part, I <U+017F>hall ask you but one thing Ma<U+017F>ter,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> for any thing el<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hall never trouble your faculty of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Since you know what's to come, tell me how long you will yet continue
Mr. <hi>Tree.</hi> I believe all the company is as de<U+017F>irous to know it as I: I <U+017F>hall be a Tree
as long as it plea<U+017F>e the Gods, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and if thou think I do not <U+017F>atisfie thee
fully, take this particular <U+017F>ecret, that all tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s it is to foretell things,
know all things, but what <U+017F>hall happen to them<U+017F>elves; and this ought not to <U+017F>eem
<U+017F>trange, for <hi>Fate</hi> hath <U+017F>o ordain'd it, that it might have a Prerogative over men
for to abate the Pre<U+017F>umption, which otherwi<U+017F>e were likely to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e their
mindes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted <U+017F>till in his Errour, was much trouble; for he had
rather have <U+017F>een him in his frolick humours, that he might have brought him back
to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s <hi>Leonora</hi> was a woman <U+017F>o re<U+017F>erv'd, that he could not <U+017F>peak with her
when ever he de<U+017F>ired, nor yet with her daughter. The Extravagancies of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> which
were <U+017F>ome recreation to tho<U+017F>e Ladies, had been very <U+017F>erviceable to him, and had
procur'd him many entertainments: So that he did his utmo<U+017F>t to per<U+017F>wade him to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43725:84"/>
live as he had done before: What will you do within this tree, <U+017F>ays he to him?
who'll come <U+017F>o far to bring you any thing to eat? Do you think I'll take the pains?
Alas! Trees eat not, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> on the contrary, they give much food to men:
Prethee trouble not thy <U+017F>elf any further about that. When thou think<U+017F>t to oblige
me, thou do<U+017F>t the contrary. I have been angry enough with thee, for telling me
this Country was <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts;</hi> but now I pardon it, and I believe all hath been done
by an expre<U+017F>s fatality. All the<U+017F>e words will not fill your belly, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> do
you hope to live by ayr, and <U+017F>uck in the mind that pa<U+017F><U+017F>es by? I do not think you
have eaten any thing the<U+017F>e two days; for ye<U+017F>terday you took only a piece of bread
in your <U+017F>crip, which was no more then would have <U+017F>ufficed your Dog. Away,
away, tell me not on't: An empty Belly, and a hollow Brain-pan go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>All wondred at what <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>aid; and <hi>Clarimond</hi> pittying the Shepherd, who
had fa<U+017F>ted <U+017F>o long, <U+017F>ent home for <U+017F>ome meat for him. His Mother, who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
charitable, and had heard talk of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s madne<U+017F>s, came thither her <U+017F>elf
for to make him eat; but all her Remon<U+017F>trances were to no purpo<U+017F>e. 'Twas plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant
to hear the rea<U+017F>ons which the Shepherd brought her to prove he was a Tree.
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> could not but laugh at it, which <U+017F>o troubled the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that <U+017F>he was forc'd to tell them that it was more Chri<U+017F>tian-like to pitty a poor
man, then to laugh at him. For to appea<U+017F>e her a little, they al<U+017F>o endeavored to
make <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> eat; and coming at la<U+017F>t to foul means, <U+017F>eeing they could do nothing by
fair, they caus'd his teeth to be opened with a <U+017F>tick, and thru<U+017F>t in a little meat into
his mouth, but he pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>pat it in their faces. <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who was a piercing
wit, <U+017F>ays thereupon to him, Mr. <hi>Willow,</hi> if you cannot eat, will you not drink <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what?
I have brought along with me an excellent drink, it is as good as Nectar of
the fir<U+017F>t pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure. Trees neither eat nor drink I tell you, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> <U+017F>hall I never
per<U+017F>wade you to't? How are you now mi<U+017F>taken, replyes? <hi>Clarimond;</hi> how could
the Plants grow, if they were not water'd? I'll give you leave to water me, <U+017F>ayes
the <hi>Willow,</hi> but it mu<U+017F>t be at my root; and be<U+017F>ides, you mu<U+017F>t only make u<U+017F>e of clear
water. Wine will do better, replyes <hi>Clarimond,</hi> it's a <U+017F>ecret that all Gardeners
know not; nay, I will ca<U+017F>t it above, and it <U+017F>hall moi<U+017F>ten you <U+017F>o much the more:
Know you not, that the rain falls <U+017F>traight down on the tops of the trees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, would improve the occa<U+017F>ion, believing he had already
prevail'd with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to drink: He got upon a <U+017F>tool, and put into his mouth a tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
he had <U+017F>ent for; which done, <hi>Champagne</hi> pours into it at lea<U+017F>t three pintes of
wine. The <hi>Willow</hi> was very well content to <U+017F>wallow it; and <U+017F>aid to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> I
mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, dear friend, that thou knowe<U+017F>t well how to order Plants. My
pith is all moi<U+017F>ten'd by this liquor thou ha<U+017F>t given me; and my <U+017F>ap, which is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
moy<U+017F>ture of trees, is made much more vigorous thereby. I told you <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wers
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> I will now give you a ta<U+017F>te of another brevidge, that is more nutritive.
Having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, he <U+017F>oftly <U+017F>poke to <hi>Champagne</hi> to go and <U+017F>ee if there were not <U+017F>ome
good broth at his hou<U+017F>e ready. The Lacquay returns pre<U+017F>ently with <U+017F>ome Pompion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pottage,
that had been made for the Plough-men. They gave him that al<U+017F>o through
the tunnel; and when ever the bread that had been crum'd in it would not pa<U+017F>s
through, they forc'd it down with a little <U+017F>tick, as if they had been charging a piece
of Ordnance. The <hi>Willow</hi> receiv'd all very quietly; for though he believ'd that
trees <U+017F>hould not eat, yet his belly told him the contrary; and as it was not much
acce<U+017F><U+017F>ary to his follies, <U+017F>o was it well pleas'd it had gotten <U+017F>omewhat to feed on:
When all was done, and that the tunnel was taken from his mouth, he breath'd three
or four times, as not being able to have contained any longer, the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>piration
having been <U+017F>o long <U+017F>top'd. At length, <U+017F>ayes he to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> this <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
watering is not <U+017F>o liquid as the fir<U+017F>t, and yet I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s it is not the wor<U+017F>e
for it. Now you are furni<U+017F>h'd till to morrow, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> but I beg it of the
Gods, that you may <U+017F>hortly live after another maner among men.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he con<U+017F>idered, that to prevail any thing with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> all mu<U+017F>t be
done by fair means and artifice as he had done, and that he might not be di<U+017F>quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43725:84"/>
any further, his advice was, that all <U+017F>hould retire. They all <U+017F>upp'd at his hou<U+017F>e,
and in the mean time <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who had been left alone with his Ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>eeing
the night come on, ask'd him whether he would come away and lodge in <U+017F>ome hou<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>ince that the night before he had not re<U+017F>ted much, had lien in the fields. And
where ha<U+017F>t thou ever <U+017F>een beds made ready for trees? an<U+017F>wers the <hi>Shepherd-Willow.</hi>
It would be a fine <U+017F>ight to <U+017F>ee me a-bed between two <U+017F>heets with my earthly roots,
my back cover'd over with mo<U+017F>s, and my leafy branches. But if I <U+017F>hould have a
minde to lie down, think<U+017F>t thou I could do it? Mu<U+017F>t I not always <U+017F>tand upright?
Seeing you would have me imagine that you are a tree, I am content it <U+017F>hould be
<U+017F>o, replyes <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but tell me, why did you not order your change <U+017F>o, as that
you might have been <U+017F>ome more delightful, and more u<U+017F>eful tree then you now are?
you are of tho<U+017F>e wretched Willow trees, which are good for nothing but to binde
Hoops about with, and make Baskets of. It had been much better to have been <U+017F>ome
good Pear-tree: When you had been cut down, men would have made of your
wood <U+017F>tately chairs, whereon Kings and Pre<U+017F>idents would have <U+017F>ate; and you might
have born good Pears, which I would have carried to your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. Thou do<U+017F>t
but thread impertinences together, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for be<U+017F>ides that thou
corrupte<U+017F>t my name, thou do<U+017F>t mo<U+017F>t unworthily de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e me, by <U+017F>aying I <U+017F>hould be
good for nothing; for that is my happine<U+017F>s; and though my wood were the faire<U+017F>t
in the world, yet ought it not to be cut, becau<U+017F>e it were no other then the maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my limbs, and the committing of a <U+017F>ignal murther: Whoever <U+017F>hall touch
me, de<U+017F>erves a halter, as much as if he had ma<U+017F><U+017F>acred the true Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> As
for the fruit thou would<U+017F>t have me bear, whereof <hi>Charite</hi> <U+017F>hould eat, it's an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of thy little wit; for if that fair one hate me, <U+017F>he will not eat any thing
comes from me, be<U+017F>ides that I <U+017F>hould have the misfortune to be ta<U+017F>ted by others
as well as <U+017F>he, which would be a great di<U+017F>content to me. See<U+017F>t thou, <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
all the good I hope is, that my Shepherde<U+017F>s may come one day into this place
with her companions, and that they will dance about me a poor and de<U+017F>olate
willow, and <U+017F>ing every one a <U+017F>ong. I <U+017F>hall an<U+017F>wer them fir<U+017F>t by the <U+017F>haking
of my leaves, then I will bow down my boughs to the ground in reverence of
<hi>Charite;</hi> and la<U+017F>tly, I will make <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ad complaint to her, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall be
moved with compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Do you believe <U+017F>he'll take you for a tree? <U+017F>ays
<hi>Carmelin:</hi> for I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, the Gentlemen who are newly gone hence, and are
your very good friends, laugh in good earne<U+017F>t at it, and you have perceiv'd it your
<U+017F>elf. For my part, I have heard them <U+017F>ay, that you imagin'd your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>till in tho<U+017F>e
<hi>Pagan</hi> times, wherein it was an article of faith to believe all your <hi>Metaphorimo<U+017F>es,</hi>
(I know not how you call tho<U+017F>e Engines) and that thence proceeds all your hurt.
Get thee gone, or hold thy peace, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> For I will bend one of my bigge<U+017F>t
boughs, and di<U+017F>charge it over thy <U+017F>houlders <U+017F>o effectually, that I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>end thee into
the other world. Neither thou, nor tho<U+017F>e thou <U+017F>peake<U+017F>t of under<U+017F>tand the<U+017F>e <U+017F>acred

and approved by all the world: When any <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak of me, confute them with
that authority.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Willow</hi> was in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the heavens began to be dark of all <U+017F>ides,
both becau<U+017F>e the Sun was pa<U+017F>s'd into the other hemi<U+017F>phere, and by rea<U+017F>on a many
clouds gathered together from all parts. <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>eeing that, bid his ma<U+017F>ter good
night, that he might lodge the Flock. <hi>Mu<U+017F>idore</hi> follow'd him wittingly; for he was
<U+017F>uch a friendly Cur, that he was for him that gave him mo<U+017F>t; and <U+017F>ince <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had
not given him any bread, he <U+017F>tuck to his <U+017F>ervant who provided for him. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43725:85"/>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner come to his lodging, but it rain'd very heavily, <U+017F>o that
he was <U+017F>ore troubled for his ma<U+017F>ter. Yet could he not pitty him, when he con<U+017F>idered
that no hurt happen'd to him, whereof he was not him<U+017F>elf the cau<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Tree wherein <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was, had the boughs <U+017F>o <U+017F>cattered, that it gave him not
the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>helter. The water that quickly got through his thin cloaths, was <U+017F>oon felt,
though he imagin'd him<U+017F>elf within a Bark. No mad imagination could divert him
now; but he mu<U+017F>t quit the boughs whereto he had been fa<U+017F>tened all the time, and
<U+017F>hrunk him<U+017F>elf down as low as he could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly. In the mid<U+017F>t of his hypocondriack
imaginations he <U+017F>aid in him<U+017F>elf, That indeed a watering like that in the afternoon
was not to be refus'd; but that as for this he had receiv'd then, he was not pleas'd
with it, exce<U+017F>s being ever hurtfull. He was afraid his wood might rot away, if it
rain'd long in that manner; and he thought it but rea<U+017F>on that <U+017F>uch fair Trees as he
<U+017F>hould not be left de<U+017F>olate in the fields; and that if they could not be tran<U+017F>planted
into hou<U+017F>es during foul weather, 'twere fit there were certain Cales made them.
This brought him into a little indignation, that he was not a Tree in the Garden of
<U+017F>ome great Prince, who cover'd his Grove with <U+017F>late, with gla<U+017F>s-windows in it.
That <U+017F>eem'd a very good way to him, for the convenience of <U+017F>uch Trees as him<U+017F>elf.
But the ill luck was, he was bare-headed; and though his mind was much perplex'd,
yet he could not but think of his Hat, which <hi>Carmelin</hi> had carried away with him,
<U+017F>eeing he would not put it on. It had done him a courte<U+017F>ie then. At length the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
having pitty on this poor Fool, left off pouring water on his head: The clouds
were di<U+017F>pers'd, and he had lei<U+017F>ure enough to dry his cloaths by his own natural hear.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Montenor, An<U+017F>elme,</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> having <U+017F>ent for <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
learn'd of him how he had left his Ma<U+017F>ter, and where he was; and re<U+017F>olved not to
trouble him, to <U+017F>ee what would come of it, and whether he might have the patience
to be there all night. They lay that night in the Ca<U+017F>tle where they were: but as for
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> he would needs go home to his Ho<U+017F>t. The good man wondring to <U+017F>ee
him return without <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> as he had done the night before, ask'd him where he was.
He told him he was chang'd into a Tree, or that he imagin'd he was <U+017F>o: whereat he
was wonderfully a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed. He enquired of him further, out of what de<U+017F>ign they
kept <U+017F>heep. <hi>Carmelin</hi> an<U+017F>wered, There was no hurt in that; but that if the que<U+017F>tion
were asked his ma<U+017F>ter, he would give a better account of it then he could. <hi>Bertrand</hi>
receiving no better <U+017F>atisfaction, he and his family went quietly to bed, and the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
apprenti<U+017F>e did the like.</p>
            <p>About three hours after, it being very fair weather, the Moon began to <U+017F>hine
very bright; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> looking on her, <U+017F>aluted her in the<U+017F>e words: Thou art wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
fair <hi>Diana</hi> with the <U+017F>ilver-forehead; whither runn'<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t? Art thou
prick'd forward by <U+017F>ome new Love? Methinks in this <U+017F>ilence I hear from this place
the <U+017F>mack of the whip wherewith thou do<U+017F>t <U+017F>o <U+017F>prightfully drive thy hor<U+017F>es; thou
would<U+017F>t in a manner make them go po<U+017F>t. Stay a little for to behold the fortune
which is befallen to a poor Shepherd.</p>
            <p>As the Shepherd ended the<U+017F>e words, he <U+017F>aw three <hi>Nymphs</hi> come out from between
the trees of a Thicket hard by; and if they were not <U+017F>uch, he at lea<U+017F>t thought them
<U+017F>uch. The fir<U+017F>t was cloathed in a mantle of Canvas <U+017F>ilver'd over, and the two other
with white Fu<U+017F>tian. While they came <U+017F>till neerer and neerer him, Fair <hi>Hamadryads!</hi>
<U+017F>ays the mo<U+017F>t vi<U+017F>ible among<U+017F>t them, do me one favour; tell me one thing I de<U+017F>ire
much to be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of: Is it true, that the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was ye<U+017F>terday metam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orpho<U+017F>ed
into a Tree? There's nothing more certain, replies one of them; and we
are infinitely happy to have him our brother: He was the Phenix of all Lovers, the
glory of his age, and the object of the vows of all Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>olitude of the place, the words of the Nymphs, and the gli<U+017F>tering of their
cloaths in the moon-<U+017F>hine, ravi<U+017F>h'd the Shepherd into admiration; his eyes were as
much charm'd as his ears. What addition to his exta<U+017F>ie was it to hear the <U+017F>hining
Nymph continue thus: Can I by no means know in what place remains this happy
Tree, which encrea<U+017F>es the number of tho<U+017F>e of this Country? We are ju<U+017F>t at it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wers
the other: Do you not perceive that Willow, which I do not remember I
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43725:85"/>
ever <U+017F>aw before in that place? <U+017F>hall we go thither? <hi>Synopa,</hi> we will <U+017F>peak to our
Brother, and know how he does: And he'll tell us how he findes him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince he
hath chang'd his nature. 'Tis a noble curio<U+017F>ity, replies the fir<U+017F>t Nymph: let us go,
it may be he will be di<U+017F>pleas'd to <U+017F>ee me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having heard <hi>Synopa</hi> nam'd, was much amaz'd, and by her <U+017F>peech he knew
<U+017F>he was the <hi>Nayad</hi> of the Magician <hi>Hircan.</hi> The <hi>Nymphs</hi> by this time being come
near him, one of the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> <U+017F>aid to him, Alas! dear Brother, what do you
there all alone? will you not enjoy the plea<U+017F>ure of the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on? Come out thence,
and recreate your <U+017F>elf with us. What ever you are fair <hi>Nymphs,</hi> an<U+017F>wers the
<hi>Shepherd Willow,</hi> pardon me, if I cannot go with you; for my De<U+017F>tiny hath <U+017F>o di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of me, that I cannot come hence. You are mi<U+017F>taken, replyes the <hi>Hamadryad,</hi> I
have been a Shepherde<U+017F>s as well as you have been a Shepherd, and I am now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphos'd
into a Tree as you are, but I keep within my bark but only the day.
We mu<U+017F>t recreate out <U+017F>elves in the night. I'll never believe that, if you bring me not
an authority for it. That you <U+017F>hall have enough, <U+017F>aies <hi>Synopa,</hi> have you not ob<U+017F>erv'd
in the Ode, that <hi>Philip De<U+017F>portes</hi> hath made of a Country life, that when the Sun
gives place to the Moon, the Nymphs meet together in the Woods, and dance and
jig it, and get green gowns? 'Tis a <hi>Poet</hi> of reputation, will you not believe him? I
do believe him, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but he <U+017F>peaks only of <hi>Nymphs,</hi> he doth not mention
<hi>Demi-Gods.</hi> They are under<U+017F>tood, <U+017F>aies <hi>Synopa;</hi> for would you have us dance alone?
we mu<U+017F>t needs have <U+017F>ome males among us. If we have not you, and <U+017F>uch as you are,
we mu<U+017F>t be forc'd to take in the <hi>Satyrs</hi> into our company. And what would you
do there; grow wilde again? 'Tis true, in the day time you dare not venture out,
le<U+017F>t your Divinity might be <U+017F>een of men; but in the night, that all the worlds a<U+017F>leep,
you mu<U+017F>t take your time to be merry, and tread the gra<U+017F>s and your cares under your
feet. There are thickets hereabouts, where there are always <hi>Dryads,</hi> and <hi>Hamadryads,
Nayads</hi> and <hi>Napeans,</hi> 'tis thither you mu<U+017F>t go along with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hearing this, believ'd all the Nymph <U+017F>aid was true; and as there is nothing
<U+017F>ooner brings fools to <U+017F>ee rea<U+017F>on, then <U+017F>uffering; the inconvenience he found to be
<U+017F>o long in the hollow of a tree, per<U+017F>waded him it would not be ami<U+017F>s to go out for
a while. He was fain to put his whole <U+017F>trength to winde him<U+017F>elf up, and at length
he delivered him<U+017F>elf out of captivity, and leap'd down. My dear Si<U+017F>ters, quoth he
to the Nymphs, if I <U+017F>in, the Gods pardon me, for your per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions are the cau<U+017F>e
of my offence. Fear nothing, <U+017F>aies <hi>Synopa</hi> to him, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, you'll finde
nothing but what <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e you among us. But Si<U+017F>ters, <U+017F>aies <U+017F>he to the others,
<U+017F>hall we go and <U+017F>eek out <U+017F>ome private retreats, where we may not fear the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<U+017F>hes
of the <hi>Satyrs.</hi> I do not know any hereabouts, replies the <hi>Hamadryad,</hi> and we
have <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> for our Protector. Let's go couragiou<U+017F>ly to a little Meadow hard by;
having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, they three went on apace, and left <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to follow, which he did
with much ado, for his legs were grown <U+017F>o <U+017F>tiff, having been <U+017F>o long lockt up, that
when they were come to the Meadow, he <U+017F>ate him down on the gra<U+017F>s, and the
Nymphs about him. While he was yet giving his thanks to <hi>Synopa,</hi> that <U+017F>he had
remembred him, he hears a certain harmony, that made him prick up his ears, as a
Cat that hears a Mou<U+017F>e cry: It was a Lute, very unhand<U+017F>omely <U+017F>et to the violin;
but a little after the violin ceas'd and there was only heard the Lute and a Voyce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which made very excellent mu<U+017F>ick. The Aire was one that had been made
in a Mask, pre<U+017F>ented lately to the King by certain <hi>Nayads. Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hearing it, had
the curio<U+017F>ity to enquire who the Mu<U+017F>ician was: You <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, it is the God of the
River <hi>Morin,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Synopa</hi> to him; it mu<U+017F>t needs be he that plays on the Lute, for
he plays excellently well on it. As for her that <U+017F>ings, it is a Nymph of a Fountain
hard by, called <hi>Lucida;</hi> and for him that plays on the Violin, it is a <hi>Forre<U+017F>t-Demi-god,</hi>
who of a Shepherd was, as you are, chang'd into a tree. We <U+017F>hall have good
company to night, I warrant you, and good <U+017F>port withal.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Synopa</hi> ended the<U+017F>e words, the three per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>he <U+017F>pake of came, and made
it appear <U+017F>he was not mi<U+017F>taken. The God <hi>Morin</hi> had a Beard to his Girdle, and
Hair hanging down over his Shoulders, with a Crown of Reeds on his Head. He
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43725:86"/>
had on a Wa<U+017F>tecoat and Breeches like a Seaman, of white Canvas; as tho<U+017F>e Fi<U+017F>her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
at <hi>Paris</hi> who catch Eels, on their greate<U+017F>t Fea<U+017F>t-day. As for him that
plaid on the Violin, he had on a gray Suit, like a Countrey man; and the Nymph
of the Fountain <hi>Lucida,</hi> was in <U+017F>ilver'd Canvas like <hi>Synopa.</hi> The<U+017F>e two <hi>Nayads</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
and ki<U+017F>t one the other when they met; which done, <hi>Synopa</hi> turning to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
Father, <U+017F>aies <U+017F>he, behold, here's a time invites us to dance, it is <U+017F>o clear and
calm. 'Tis true, it rain'd a little a while <U+017F>ince; but as for us Divinities of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
it hurts us not; our channels are fill'd by that means. The God of the River
falls pre<U+017F>ently a <U+017F>noring like a Swine; whereat <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> wondring, pulls <hi>Synopa</hi> by the
fleeve, and ask'd her what language the Gods <U+017F>poke. 'Tis the language of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
replies <hi>Synopa,</hi> there can none under<U+017F>tand him but the <hi>Fi<U+017F>h</hi> and the <hi>Nayads:</hi>
'Tis great pitty, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that a God of his age hath not learned to <U+017F>peak <hi>French,</hi>
What do you wonder at, replies <hi>Synopa,</hi> he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubmit to his de<U+017F>tiny. There are
al<U+017F>o other Gods, who partaking of the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of their ho<U+017F>ts, are as mute as
Carps: But this doth not commonly make much noi<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e he would imitate
his own waters, which run <U+017F>lowly, and <U+017F>eem as if they were a<U+017F>leep, like tho<U+017F>e of
the Lakes: but this hinders not but that he can play excellently well on any mu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
in<U+017F>truments, and dance.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Nymph</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ld this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the God of the River very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly view'd
the <hi>Hamadryads,</hi> as if he had never <U+017F>een them before: So that <hi>Synopa</hi> went of a
<U+017F>udden, and <U+017F>aid to him, What do you dream on Father, that you do not <U+017F>ee a new
<hi>Demi-god</hi> that's here among us? Here is he that <U+017F>ometimes was the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi>
he was the glory of your Banks: he is now a <hi>Willow,</hi> and you ought to love him on
that account, <U+017F>eeing there are no other trees on your Banks. The God of the River
made a <U+017F>ign with his head, and went and embrac'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but he gave him <U+017F>uch a
hug, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> cryed out, O dumb God! <U+017F>ays he, do<U+017F>t thou expre<U+017F>s by thy arms
that which thou can<U+017F>t not with thy tongue? let me go, I <U+017F>hall bur<U+017F>t el<U+017F>e, thou cru<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
my wood; wilt thou make it as <U+017F>mall as <U+017F>aw-du<U+017F>t? In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he gave <U+017F>uch a
jerk, that he got out of the hands of the God; and went and told <hi>Synopa,</hi> that he
had rather lo<U+017F>e the friend<U+017F>hip of all the world, then meet with many <U+017F>uch Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But when <hi>Synopa</hi> had told him that the rudene<U+017F>s of that God was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
as to his embraces, and that in other things he was very good company, he
was appeas'd; and the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> having made the motion of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the time in
dancing, he was ready to make one. The whole company making a round, the
Nymph <hi>Lucida</hi> <U+017F>ung a Song, and afterwards the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> did every one the like.
When it came to <hi>Synopa,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>ung a ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing Song; and being near <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ays to

him a ki<U+017F>s which pleas'd him better: Ha! <U+017F>aies he to him<U+017F>elf, how <U+017F>oft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

I mu<U+017F>t avow, that this la<U+017F>t ki<U+017F>s hath taken away the hurt, which I had received by
the other. He thought there was a great deal of plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>port it <U+017F>o innocently;
and yet he wondred how it came to pa<U+017F>s, that <hi>Nymphs</hi> of reputation, and <hi>Hama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryads</hi>
<U+017F>o <U+017F>tately and gallant, amus'd them<U+017F>elves to <U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch Songs as Country-Chamber-maids
do. There was but the Mu<U+017F>ician <hi>Lucida</hi> who <U+017F>ang another ki<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
Song, which was very well compos'd, and plea<U+017F>ed him much. Being de<U+017F>irous
to ta<U+017F>te of all <U+017F>orts of meat, he went and ki<U+017F>t the Nymph that <U+017F>ang, and was more
<U+017F>atisfied, then with <hi>Synopa;</hi> becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>eem'd to him, that <U+017F>he was yet of a <U+017F>ofter
complexion, and hand<U+017F>omer. This rais'd him into <U+017F>o good an humour, that he
would have been content to do nothing el<U+017F>e all his life. But one of the <hi>Hamadryads</hi>
pre<U+017F>ently began another Song which was very ridiculous, and wherein they made
him dance <U+017F>o much, that he was quite tyred. <hi>Morin,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>ang not, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
thereof caper it in very <U+017F>trange po<U+017F>tures.</p>
            <p>At length every one being weary, they all lay down on the gra<U+017F>s; where <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
having taken breath a while, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf to all the company in the<U+017F>e words.
Ye great <hi>Divinities</hi> of this Country, <U+017F>ince that <hi>Fate</hi> hath decreed my abode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

                        <head>The Fable of the God Morin, and of the
River of Marne.</head>
                        <p>IT was a long time before <hi>Pharamond</hi> became King of <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Brie</hi>
had a King, the number of who<U+017F>e vertues was equal of that of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
His name was <hi>Bri<U+017F>efer,</hi> and his Son was called <hi>Morin,</hi> who is this
hone<U+017F>t <hi>God</hi> whom you <U+017F>ee. Now there pa<U+017F>t through this Countrey the
little Neece of a <hi>Fairy,</hi> who at her birth had had two gifts; that of
<hi>Beauty,</hi> and that of <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es.</hi> If <U+017F>he had a de<U+017F>ign to bewitch a man, <U+017F>he
had no more to do but to <U+017F>hew him her natural countenance; which when <U+017F>he
had done, <U+017F>he put on what form <U+017F>he pleas'd, as if her body had been made of
<U+017F>oft clay: She wandred about the world purcha<U+017F>ing of hearts; and all <U+017F>he got
by her amorous looks, <U+017F>he put them into a great Apron made like a Pur<U+017F>e, that
<U+017F>he had about her. <hi>Morin</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>een <hi>Marne</hi> (<U+017F>o was the Nymph cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
but <U+017F>he drew from him tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ighs that would have been able to make a <U+017F>hip
<U+017F>ail; and in te<U+017F>timony of his love, he made a deed of gift of his heart to her,
in the pre<U+017F>ence of the Notaries of <hi>Cupids</hi> Kingdom. She fa<U+017F>tned this great heart
of his to a part of her Girdle, and made it afterward her Pin-cu<U+017F>hion, which was
a great torment to him; for <U+017F>he would be ever and anon thru<U+017F>ting of pins into
it. Yet her new Lover would have taken this Martyrdom as <U+017F>upportable, had
<U+017F>he but accepted his <U+017F>ervices. But as he <U+017F>poke to her of it, being one day <U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by her, <U+017F>he made no more account of him, nor indeed was he any more in
compari<U+017F>on of her, then the <U+017F>heath of a knife hanging by her <U+017F>ide: For you
are to know, that <U+017F>he was of a Gyant <U+017F>tature; however, <U+017F>he was not e<U+017F>teemed
the le<U+017F>s for that, becau<U+017F>e if a thing be good, and fair, and plea<U+017F>ant, it is <U+017F>o much
the better if it be great; and there is no man <U+017F>o fooli<U+017F>h, but he had rather have
a great Capon then a little one: So you are to believe, that if <U+017F>he had great
cheeks, and great brea<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>he had by <U+017F>o much the more <hi>Lilies, Ro<U+017F>es,</hi> and <hi>Pinks;</hi>
and if her eyes were as large as Bucklers, they were <U+017F>o much the more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for her Lovers to behold them<U+017F>elves in. There was no calumny could ob<U+017F>cure
her glory, there was no default could be objected again<U+017F>t her but her cruelty. The
truth is, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>omewhat touch'd with that vice; and as <U+017F>he never boild her
Kettle, but with the fire of the affections <U+017F>he had enflamed; <U+017F>o did <U+017F>he never
wa<U+017F>h her hands, but in the tears of her Lovers. You might <U+017F>ee every morning
her Chamber-maid <U+017F>tanding at her door, holding a great Tray, whereinto tho<U+017F>e
poor wretches went and pour'd their tears, that there might not be want of that
water, and <U+017F>ometimes the cruel one went and held her own murthering hands
under. <hi>Morin</hi> was one of the fir<U+017F>t that paid her this duty, yet <U+017F>he regarded him
no more then the la<U+017F>t years <U+017F>now. He therefore re<U+017F>olved to get that by force,
which he could not by fair means; and being powerful in his fathers Kingdom, he
got a great number of Souldiers about <hi>Marn's</hi> hou<U+017F>e, who made <U+017F>o many works
and pali<U+017F>adoes about it, that it was thought <U+017F>he could not get away without his
leave. He enters into the <hi>Nymphs</hi> Court, where <U+017F>he was walking all alone; but
when he thought to embrace her, he was much amaz'd that <U+017F>he vani<U+017F>h'd away. He
<U+017F>earch'd for her all about, and could finde nothing but a <U+017F>pacious Quadrangle,
which to his ob<U+017F>ervation had ever before been cover'd with dry earth, but now
was carpeted with <hi>gra<U+017F>s.</hi> That gave him occa<U+017F>ion to imagine it was the fair <hi>Marn</hi>
had been <U+017F>o Metamorphos'd; and being de<U+017F>irous to enjoy her any way, he went
into the hou<U+017F>e to look for a <U+017F>ickle to cut that gra<U+017F>s. Being return'd with one in
his hand, he findes the place dry as before, and found nothing in the Court but
a <hi>Sheep.</hi> Wo is me! <U+017F>aies he, is't this <U+017F>heep that hath eaten up my gra<U+017F>s? how proud
<U+017F>he is to have my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s in its belly! <U+017F>hould I adore or puni<U+017F>h it? But before
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43725:87"/>
I re<U+017F>olve, I'll go and <U+017F>ee my <U+017F>ouldiers. He had no <U+017F>ooner turn'd his back, but he
bethought him that it were a <U+017F>in to pardon the <U+017F>heep. But turning him<U+017F>elf back,
he <U+017F>aw a <hi>Wolf</hi> in <U+017F>tead of it, whereat he was extreamly vex'd, believing that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had devoured the other. Now it was nothing but <hi>Marne,</hi> who to avoid the
dangers wherewith he threatned her, chang'd her<U+017F>elf from gra<U+017F>s to a <U+017F>heep, and
from a <U+017F>heep to a wolf. At la<U+017F>t he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch thing; but de<U+017F>irous <U+017F>till
to enjoy her, he endeavoured to <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e the bea<U+017F>t, offering it a peece of fle<U+017F>h,
and prevail'd <U+017F>o far, that he put a chain about her neck, and ty'd hen up in the
<U+017F>table. He by this time thought him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ure of what he de<U+017F>ired, and that he
<U+017F>hould now enjoy his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s whether <U+017F>he would or no. But the whole edifice
immediately took fire, and was all burnt in an in<U+017F>tant. It was to no purpo<U+017F>e to
ca<U+017F>t water on, the flame was never the more quench'd, nay it la<U+017F>ted after all the
combu<U+017F>tible matter was <U+017F>pent, nor was there any more Wolf to be <U+017F>een.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Morin</hi> <U+017F>eeing this, could not bethink him of any better invention then to put
on a Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ock of Stone-allum, which had been a Prie<U+017F>ts in the time of his ance<U+017F>tors,
wherein he was able to endure in the mid<U+017F>t of the flames without being burned,
that <U+017F>o he might embrace his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: But as he was going to accompli<U+017F>h his
de<U+017F>ign, he could <U+017F>ee nothing but a great River. Wretch that I am! <U+017F>ays he, this
water hath quench'd my amiable fire. And thereupon ca<U+017F>ts him<U+017F>elf headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: but finding no <U+017F>atisfaction that way, and being in danger to be drown'd
becau<U+017F>e he could not <U+017F>wim well, he came out pre<U+017F>ently, and contented him<U+017F>elf to
take his Lute and play mournful airs upon her banks. The water ran perpetually,
and was di<U+017F>gorg'd into the <hi>Seine:</hi> For from that time the Gods being offended
with <hi>Marne,</hi> who had di<U+017F>dain'd <U+017F>o faithfull a Lover, <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he was chang'd into
a River, ordained that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould always continue <U+017F>o, and there put an end to her
metamorpho<U+017F>es. <hi>Morin</hi> adverti<U+017F>ed of the decree of the Gods by one of their
Prie<U+017F>ts, was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with di<U+017F>quiet and de<U+017F>pair, that he lay down all along
on the ground, and began to di<U+017F>till into tears; He wept in <U+017F>uch abundance, that
his tears became a little <hi>River.</hi> The Gods having compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on him, made him
<U+017F>ubject to the <U+017F>ame decree as his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; <U+017F>o that whereas the other Gods of
Rivers have Pitchers under their arms, out of which flows their water, it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant
to <U+017F>ee how his i<U+017F><U+017F>ues at his eyes. Having <U+017F>pent all his moi<U+017F>ture to <U+017F>upply his
<U+017F>ource, he had the liberty to wander in his own channel, which from that time
disburthen'd it <U+017F>elf into <hi>Marne,</hi> to the end that if they have been a<U+017F>under while
they were in a mortal condition, they might be joyn'd together now that they
are immortal. But the brave <hi>Morin</hi> doth no longer remember his <U+017F>orrows pa<U+017F>t;
and <U+017F>eeing that <hi>Marne</hi> doth no more re<U+017F>pect him now then <U+017F>he did before, and
that <U+017F>he is always with the God of the <hi>Seine,</hi> whom <U+017F>he loves better then him,
he takes as much plea<U+017F>ure to be with us as with her; and if he hath lo<U+017F>t the u<U+017F>e
of his voice, that lo<U+017F>s is recompenc'd by the melody of his Lute which he hath
kept <U+017F>till.</p>

                        <p>KNow then <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> replies <hi>Synopa,</hi> that I am the daughter of a Duke of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> who promis'd me no meaner a match then a King of
FRANCE; but for all he could do, I would not <U+017F>ubmit to the
yoke of a marriage, which did not any ways plea<U+017F>e me. I was much
enclin'd to hunting, and I was ever in the woods <U+017F>ometimes, with a Javelin, and
<U+017F>ometimes with a bow and arrows. <hi>Diana</hi> having heard talk of me, invited me
to be of the quire of her Nymphs; and taking an affection to me, <U+017F>he gave me
one of the chiefe<U+017F>t places about her per<U+017F>on, which was to give her Dogs meat.
Having my hand on her Altar, I <U+017F>olemnly <U+017F>wore, I would ob<U+017F>erve cha<U+017F>tity as
long as I liv'd, but I have <U+017F>ince had much ado to keep my <U+017F>elf from breaking
this oath: For I was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately courted by an Earl of <hi>Champagne,</hi> who being
come to my fathers Court, gave me <U+017F>o many a<U+017F><U+017F>aults, that he was <U+017F>ometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very point of <U+017F>torming my honor: he prote<U+017F>ted I had brought him into that
<U+017F>lavery, that he ador'd whatever had relation to me; and confe<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf a <U+017F>lave
to the fleas of my Greyhounds. He <U+017F>uffer'd <U+017F>o many torments for my <U+017F>ake, that
he purpo<U+017F>ely learn'd Arithmetick, that he might give me the number of them;
and playing with me one evening at picquet, he took the counters and reckon'd
them, and the total <U+017F>um came to three hundred thou<U+017F>and, <U+017F>ix hundred twenty <U+017F>ix
and a half, not counting the <U+017F>maller <U+017F>orrows and cares of le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>equence. This
was an excellent invention, and if the Lovers of this age had it, there <U+017F>hould be
but a few Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es which <U+017F>hould be trip'd down, and fall with their faces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Yet pre<U+017F>ently calling to minde my vow, I continued as firm as a rock, and
brought my Lover to <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>pair, that he <U+017F>wore he would ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from <U+017F>ome mountain, if he <U+017F>hould meet with one high enough. His la<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
was to writing, and he <U+017F>ent me <U+017F>o many Letters, that he made paper dear
in the Country; and continued his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, till the Solicitors and Pettifoggers
petitioned again<U+017F>t him. I made no other thread (<U+017F>o little did I regard them) of
all his Mi<U+017F><U+017F>ives, then to winde up thread on, or to wrap up a piece of wilde Boar
in, if I had a minde to pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome Neighbour or Go<U+017F><U+017F>ip, when I was come home
from hunting. <hi>Diana</hi> being advertis'd of his continual applications to me, caus'd
me to be bath'd in a certain fountain of hers, which hath a propriety to make
tho<U+017F>e that go into it all <hi>Ice,</hi> if they wa<U+017F>h but three times in it: <U+017F>o that being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with coldne<U+017F>s, his <U+017F>ighs could not enflame me. But to remedy this, he goes
into a certain Temple of <hi>Love,</hi> that was near his own abode: The Prie<U+017F>ts of the
place had in their cu<U+017F>tody a certain fire, that was <U+017F>o powerful, that nothing could
<U+017F>tand again<U+017F>t it. This devout Pilgrim made <U+017F>o many prayers to the Divinity of
the place, that at length he merited <U+017F>o far, as that he obtained a little beam of
that flame, which he made fa<U+017F>t in a box of <hi>Diamond.</hi> He came to <U+017F>ee me with

                        <p>SEing you are de<U+017F>irous to have the relation of my fortune, <U+017F>ays <hi>Lucida,</hi>
know that I am daughter to a Lord of this Country; and that <U+017F>ince I
was fifteen years of age, I fell in love with one of his Gentlemen. He was
<U+017F>o beautifull, that he had never <U+017F>een his like but in a gla<U+017F>s: His hair was curled
like a <hi>Holland</hi> Water-Spaniel, and his countenance had as much vermilion as a
Ro<U+017F>e of <hi>Provence.</hi> All he did was with <U+017F>uch a grace, that if he playd on the Lute,
I took him for <hi>Apollo</hi> the younger; and if he <U+017F>hot with a bow, I took him for
<hi>Cupid</hi> the elder, for his beard was already <U+017F>prouted out. His attractions were <U+017F>o
powerfull over me, that being one day neer a Table which was very du<U+017F>ty, with
my finger I writ thereon, that <hi>Lucida</hi> was dying for him. But the Gallant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
it not; and having <U+017F>worn to me that he could not love me, it was <U+017F>uch
an affliction to me, that I <U+017F>ickned on't and kept my bed. The <hi>Love</hi>-feaver took
me <U+017F>o violently, that I did nothing but drink night and day, <U+017F>o that my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
turn'd to a Drop<U+017F>ie, and I became as big as a Ton. All the Phy<U+017F>itians in the
Country that vi<U+017F>ited me were at a lo<U+017F>s of their Latine; but when they had all
given me over, there was a knowing Chymi<U+017F>t made me take an excellent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
That made me pi<U+017F>s <U+017F>o much, that there i<U+017F><U+017F>ued out of my body great
brooks, and then it was that the Gods bethought them to change me into a

            <p>I find no difficulty in this Metamorpho<U+017F>is, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for your body continues
in the <U+017F>ame being as to its form, but not as to its nature, which is become immortal;
and as concerning your Urine, it hath only been chang'd to Fountain-water. But
when I con<U+017F>ider the adventure of <hi>Synopa,</hi> I cannot <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily under<U+017F>tand it: For <U+017F>he
<U+017F>ays, that being all Ice, the fire di<U+017F><U+017F>olved her: If it be <U+017F>o, how is it that <U+017F>he hath a
body <U+017F>till? Yet we <U+017F>ee it is <U+017F>o; and the Gods not having di<U+017F>cover'd the <U+017F>ecret to her
no more then they let children know what way they have been formed in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
belly, the poor Nymph hath given us no account of it. But I'll explain it to
her. The rea<U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F>e the Gods, when they have metamorphos'd a humane
body into a Fountain, di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e the <U+017F>oul into another body which is compo<U+017F>ed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatick
vapours. There was never any Poet, nor other that hath commented on any
of them, ever imagin'd this, though they attribute bodies to the Deities of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and this is the rea<U+017F>on they have left us in <U+017F>o much ambiguity. Nor may I be
afraid to boa<U+017F>t that I am guilty of as learned con<U+017F>iderations, that if a God came now
down on earth, I <U+017F>hould not court him for excellent imaginations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:43725:89"/>
I am very much oblig'd to you for <U+017F>o excellent an in<U+017F>truction, <U+017F>ays <hi>Sinopa:</hi> in
recompence whereof, <U+017F>eeing you cannot <U+017F>ee my abode, be plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee <hi>Lucida's.</hi>
That <U+017F>hall be when ever you are di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> Let's go pre<U+017F>ently, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Lucida,</hi> it's very good being there; I'll <U+017F>hew you the way. Having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, they
all ri<U+017F>e up, and having cro<U+017F>s'd certain meadows and thickets, this noble Company
came to a Brook which ran between two vallies. The God of the River, and the
Nymphs having taken up their coats, went into the water, which came up to half
the leg, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was obliged to do as much: He <U+017F>ometimes complain'd that he
was forced to go in that manner: but <hi>Lucida,</hi> who led him, excus'd his want of
courage, <U+017F>aying that he who was not a God of a Fountain, was not accu<U+017F>tomed to
walk in the water as they were; and to comfort him, <U+017F>he ever a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him that it
was not far to her grot.</p>
            <p>At length they came to a high <U+017F>tony eminencie, where was the <U+017F>ource of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
The earth was very hollow in divers places; <U+017F>o that <hi>Lucida</hi> ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that there was her abode. Then <U+017F>he takes up her coats a little higher then
they were before, and pi<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>o loud, that he heard it. O fair aquatick Nymph!
cries he out, <U+017F>tay your <U+017F>elf, I be<U+017F>eech you; I <U+017F>ee proofs enough of what you have
told me, it is certain this Brook hath no other recruit but what you pi<U+017F>s; but if you
<U+017F>hut not your cock, I <U+017F>hall be afraid of a deluge: I pray take heed; for though I
am a Tree, and that I keep above the water, and am not drown'd, yet my timber
would rot in time.</p>
            <p>The God <hi>Morin</hi> hearing this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, thought it <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant, that he could not
hold him<U+017F>elf from laughing a little outright: So that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> wondring at it, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
(<U+017F>ays he) to laugh very decently, there's hope he may in time learn to <U+017F>peak
<hi>French. Lucida</hi> having given over pi<U+017F><U+017F>ing, an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>he doubted not but
that in time he might be taught all good things; but that for the pre<U+017F>ent they mu<U+017F>t
go to a collation in her grot. They all came out of the water; and he that played
on the <hi>Violin,</hi> and the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> went away and <U+017F>aid nothing, <U+017F>o far that they
were quite out of <U+017F>ight. <hi>Synopa</hi> <U+017F>ate next to <hi>Morin,</hi> and <hi>Lucida</hi> next to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi>
The<U+017F>e two Nymphs did not much weigh the wetting their legs, for it was not cold,
it only made them the more frolick. <hi>Morin</hi> di<U+017F>covered a great affection to <hi>Synopa;</hi>
and having felt her brea<U+017F>t, ki<U+017F>s'd and embraced her often: And <U+017F>ometimes he put
him<U+017F>elf into <U+017F>uch wanton po<U+017F>tures, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> knew not what to <U+017F>ay of it; however
at la<U+017F>t he concluded it was the cu<U+017F>tom of the Gods of the waters, but he would have
gladly known whether it was al<U+017F>o the cu<U+017F>tom of the Deities of the thickets. <hi>Lucida</hi>
taking him by the hand, wrung it hard between her own, and <U+017F>ometimes brought it
to her mouth: but <U+017F>uch was his <U+017F>hamefac'dne<U+017F>s, that he dur<U+017F>t do nothing, though
the temptation was very great. It fortunately came into his mind to de<U+017F>ire <hi>Morin</hi>
to play an aire or two on his Lute, to which <hi>Lucida</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ing; for he would have
gladly entertain'd her, but knew not how to begin.</p>
            <p>It was not long ere the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> and the <hi>Violi<U+017F>t</hi> return'd with bottles and ba<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
which <U+017F>oon <U+017F>ilenc'd the mu<U+017F>ick; they had brought bread, and great pieces of
Pye-cru<U+017F>t, and a peece of Gammon of bacon, with good wine, and <U+017F>ome boxes of
Sweet-meats. <hi>Morin</hi> and <hi>Synopa</hi> having begun to eat, <hi>Lucida</hi> <U+017F>aid to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> And
will not you, <hi>rural Demy-god!</hi> do as we do? What, is there not any thing here
that you like? will you <U+017F>light me <U+017F>o? No, that I do not, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, an<U+017F>wers
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but you know that we <hi>Trees</hi> do not eat any thing, we do nought but drink;
we are not like you <hi>Fountains,</hi> who eat and drink all is given you, we cannot devour
in that manner. 'Tis true, you Trees cannot, <U+017F>ays <hi>Synopa;</hi> but you who are the
Souls of the Trees, you may eat any thing. I'll never believe it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> I'll give
you an example for it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Synopa:</hi> There is your Comrade as to fortune, that eats
like a Wolf.</p>
            <p>In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he gave the <hi>Violi<U+017F>t</hi> what to be doing withall; who having a good
<U+017F>tomach, <U+017F>oon made an end of all: whereat <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> much wondring, and <U+017F>eeing the
<hi>Hamadryads</hi> eat too, he would needs try whether he could do the like. Having eaten
a piece of Pye, it <U+017F>eem'd very favoury to him; but after that, all he had to do was to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43725:89"/>
chew the cud. His <U+017F>tomach increas'd for what he had eaten; and he thought all had
been brought, not too much for him<U+017F>elf. One of the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> having fill'd a
gla<U+017F>s of wine, he ob<U+017F>erved that <hi>Synopa</hi> and <hi>Lucida</hi> drank it not <U+017F>o, but da<U+017F>h'd it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
half water. I wonder you <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>o, <U+017F>ays he; what need have you to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
water with your wine, <U+017F>eeing you your <U+017F>elves are already all water, and that that
liquor lo<U+017F>es <U+017F>ufficiently of its force when it is within your bodies? We only do this
out of cu<U+017F>tom, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Synopa;</hi> we mu<U+017F>t needs ob<U+017F>erve an antient ceremony. But
if I am not deceived, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> you do this in remembrance of the education of
<hi>Bacchus</hi> among the <hi>Nymphs</hi> of the <hi>Fountains,</hi> who for that rea<U+017F>on requires water
<U+017F>hould be mixed with his liquor.</p>
            <p>While he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, the <hi>Violi<U+017F>t</hi> having eaten enough, began to recreate the company

               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> an<U+017F>wered not a word, for he was afraid that they would per<U+017F>wade him to
love one of the <hi>Hamadryads,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they were of the <U+017F>ame nature; and them he
could by no means fancie. But after a while bethinking him that <U+017F>he that propo<U+017F>ed
it might <U+017F>peak of her<U+017F>elf, he imagined he might freely love a <hi>Nayad,</hi> and <U+017F>o addre<U+017F>s'd
his affections to <hi>Lucida;</hi> though a certain remor<U+017F>e <U+017F>tuck in his con<U+017F>cience, that told
him he ought a <U+017F>ervice to <hi>Charite</hi> as well in the quality of a Tree, as that of a Man:
yet meeting with new charms, he ea<U+017F>ily forgot what was pa<U+017F>t. <hi>Lucida</hi> renewed
her care<U+017F><U+017F>es; and one time having ki<U+017F>s'd his hand, <U+017F>he let it fall directly into her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om,
which was all open. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> continued it there a while, and he was for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
at a lo<U+017F>s of his rea<U+017F>on among tho<U+017F>e incomparable delights, which before he was
not wont to enjoy. He had been one of tho<U+017F>e who in their addre<U+017F><U+017F>es are amorou<U+017F>ly
tran<U+017F>ported, and <U+017F>o re<U+017F>pectfull, that they dare not touch their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es. In the<U+017F>e
very fir<U+017F>t approaches, he could imagine no le<U+017F>s then that he had been in the <hi>Elyzian</hi>
fields. <hi>Synopa</hi> did him a great di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ie, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke of departing: He
thought it proceeded from her jealou<U+017F>ie of his enjoyments. Yet con<U+017F>idering it was
almo<U+017F>t day, he was content to retire, and went the <U+017F>econd time into the water with
the other Divinities, which thought them<U+017F>elves oblig'd to bring him back. When
they were come neer his Tree, <hi>Synopa</hi> told him that he mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily re<U+017F>olve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
two dayes were pa<U+017F>t, whether he would take her or <hi>Lucida</hi> to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and
that they would not any longer langui<U+017F>h in expectation. He told her, that he would
con<U+017F>ider of it, and immediately he would needs get into his bark. Stay a little, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Lucida</hi> to him; we'll give you a Hat, you have not any, and there was none of us
till now had the wit to take notice of it; if you continue bare-headed, you may catch
a cold. I am exempted from that inconvenience, fair Nymph! replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> A
head of wood, as mine is, the weather cannot <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily hurt, as a mans which is of
fle<U+017F>h and bone. It is true, that the better to pre<U+017F>erve the complexion, it were not
ami<U+017F>s to have a hat: But in regard I had not my own on when I was metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed,
it was not <U+017F>ubject to change; <U+017F>o that now it is not fit for me, nor any other
hat. I apprehend your meaning, <U+017F>ays <hi>Synopa;</hi> you will not have a Ca<U+017F>ter or a
Beaver, but you would <U+017F>uffer one of wood, that were conformable to your nature.
'Tis right, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and my own hat <U+017F>hould have been of that <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, if it had
been metamorphos'd with me. You <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ently have <U+017F>uch a one as <U+017F>hall become
you, replies <hi>Synopa:</hi> And in <U+017F>o <U+017F>aying <U+017F>he takes from one of the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> a
Goblet of <hi>China</hi>-wood, wherein (becau<U+017F>e they would be <U+017F>erved with an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
more divine and poetical) they had drunk at the collation, and put it on the
Shepherds head. This wooden Night-cap was <U+017F>o narrow, that it would not come
on the crown of his head, <U+017F>o that he ca<U+017F>t it away as being not fit for him, if <hi>Synopa</hi>
could not make it bigger. The fault is not in the Cap, <U+017F>ays <hi>Synopa,</hi> it is in your head
which is too great; it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>mooth'd about. You are mi<U+017F>taken, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi>
Do you not con<U+017F>ider that if the hat were large enough, it would ea<U+017F>ily come on my
head? And do you not <U+017F>ee too, replies <hi>Synopa,</hi> that if your head were le<U+017F>s, it would
<U+017F>erve you well enough? Their conte<U+017F>tation on this nice difficulty la<U+017F>ted a good
while; <U+017F>o that at length <hi>Lucida</hi> <U+017F>aid, that that mu<U+017F>t be done which could be mo<U+017F>t
ea<U+017F>ily; and that being the Cap could be made no bigger, a hatchet mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ought
for to le<U+017F><U+017F>en <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> his head round. That mu<U+017F>t not be, <U+017F>ays he to her, it would hurt
me too much, 'tis better to be bare-headed. You <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>ays <hi>Synopa,</hi> that the wood
of this young <hi>Cypre<U+017F>s</hi> is cut off every day to make new In<U+017F>truments withall, he fares
never the wor<U+017F>e for it: The bodies of Trees, have they not their <U+017F>uperfluities as well
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43725:90"/>
as tho<U+017F>e of men? put the ca<U+017F>e your nails were par'd or your hair cut, as if you were
<U+017F>till a Shepherd. I think that if but one of your leaves were taken off, you would
imagine your <U+017F>elf on the rack: Yea, though I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer no hurt, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
I mu<U+017F>t be left entire, for I am a <hi>Sacred</hi> Tree.</p>
            <p>While he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, the God <hi>Morin</hi> felt in the basket, where was the remainder
of the Collation; and having found a great hollow box, wherein there had been
marmalade, and whereof there was <U+017F>till a little at the bottom: he pre<U+017F>ented it to
<hi>Synopa,</hi> <U+017F>peaking to her by <U+017F>igns, This is it I wanted, <U+017F>aies <U+017F>he, and putting it on
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s head without further conte<U+017F>tation, it hapned to be very fit. The bottom of it
was <U+017F>o well pitch'd, that it clung to his hair, it needed no <U+017F>tay, Being thus arm'd,
and the company having promis'd to <U+017F>ee him again the night following, they took
leave of him, and went a little way off, where waited a Coach for them, to carry
them to <hi>Hircan's,</hi> who was he that had plaid the part of the God of the River
<hi>Morin. Lucida,</hi> was a jovial widow of the Neighbourhood; The <hi>Violi<U+017F>t,</hi> his own
man; and the <hi>Hamadryads,</hi> two of his maids. All the<U+017F>e had he di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to deceive <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> believing there would be as much entertainment with him as
at the greate<U+017F>t revelling in the world; and that they made him believe he was dumb,
was le<U+017F>t his <U+017F>peech might di<U+017F>cover him. Now he had not forgotten to give every
one his Cue, that they might not fail to <U+017F>peak in <hi>Poetical</hi> and <hi>Romantick</hi> terms. As
<U+017F>oon as they came home, they went to bed to re<U+017F>t them after this diver<U+017F>ion; and
in the mean time <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> though abus'd, was as well <U+017F>atisfied as they, believing he had
really <U+017F>een tho<U+017F>e divinities, which before he had only <U+017F>een in the imaginations of
them which his books furni<U+017F>h'd him with, by which means he became more a fool
then he had ever been.</p>
            <p>With much ado he got into his Tree, but he was no <U+017F>ooner in, but his belly
began to gripe, becau<U+017F>e he had taken cold by being <U+017F>o long in the wind and rain.
He lifted him<U+017F>elf up a little, and having untyed his Codpiece-point, <U+017F>ate a cro<U+017F>s one
of the boughs, and was a good while di<U+017F>charging him<U+017F>elf of a burthen did <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
importune him: which done, he put him<U+017F>elf into the po<U+017F>ture he was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Aurora</hi> began to appear, he entertain'd him<U+017F>elf with a world of
fanta<U+017F>tical imaginations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who had <U+017F>lept well all night, thought it time to get up, and come
abroad with the flock; and withal, to <U+017F>ee what humor his Ma<U+017F>ter was in. Well,
<U+017F>ays he to him, are you <U+017F>till a <hi>Willow,</hi> as you were ye<U+017F>terday? I never was, <U+017F>ayes
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and it was only the mi<U+017F>take of <U+017F>ome <hi>Nymphs</hi> to call me <U+017F>o. 'Tis true, I am
a tree, but not a common tree. The Gods have had more con<U+017F>ideration of me,
then that my body <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ubject to a vulgar Metamorpho<U+017F>es. Knowe<U+017F>t thou
not, that tho<U+017F>e whom the Poets mention, are ever chang'd into trees that were
never <U+017F>een in the world before, and that they are the principle of their being? I
am a new tree added to nature, and if thou would<U+017F>t know my name, 'tis <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> All
the trees mention'd in <hi>Ovid,</hi> bear the names of tho<U+017F>e from whom they came. And
that's a thing I thought not on till now. But all tho<U+017F>e new trees you <U+017F>peak of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> do they not afterwards become common. 'Tis very true, an<U+017F>wers
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is: Myrrha</hi> being once chang'd into a tree of her name, there hath been a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
afterwards <U+017F>een in <hi>Arabia</hi> of the <U+017F>ame kinde. Well, and is that <U+017F>ame <hi>Myrrha</hi>
in all tho<U+017F>e trees? <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin.</hi> Thou art very <U+017F>ubtil, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> know <U+017F>he
is only in the fir<U+017F>t, and that the others are graffs, or proceed from the kernel, and
are but the Progeny of the former. It <U+017F>eems then, that you may al<U+017F>o have in time
a very fair race, if God be <U+017F>o pleas'd, replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> well be it <U+017F>o; but <hi>I</hi> pray
tell me, is it any delightful thing to be what you are? Ah! <hi>Carmelin,</hi> cryes out
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> thou put<U+017F>t me on an excellent <U+017F>ubject. Alas! <hi>I</hi> never could believe there
had been <U+017F>o much plea<U+017F>ure to be a tree, as there is. Thou art <U+017F>o gallant a man,
that <hi>I</hi> dare tell thee a thing of importance, though <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould hazard <U+017F>ome puni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for di<U+017F>covering the <U+017F>ecrets of the <hi>Divinities.</hi> Know then, my friend, that the
lives of the greate<U+017F>t Monarchs is tedious and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ant in compari<U+017F>on of ours.
<hi>Diana</hi> no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>hews her <U+017F>ilver-face, but the <hi>Demi-Gods,</hi> and the <hi>Nymphs</hi> of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43725:91"/>
the <hi>Thickets,</hi> and the <hi>Aquatick Divinities</hi> meet together in the meadows, where
they divert them<U+017F>elves in all manner of recreations. The God <hi>Morin</hi> him<U+017F>elf did
me la<U+017F>t night the honor to come and <U+017F>ee me, with the <hi>Cypre<U+017F>s</hi> and <hi>Lucida. Synopa</hi>
and two <hi>Hamadryads</hi> did me the <U+017F>ame favour. <hi>We danc'd,</hi> we <hi><U+017F>ung,</hi> we <hi>plaid</hi> one
with another, and the gra<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e meadows bear yet the mark of our foot<U+017F>teps.
<hi>Lucida,</hi> who is a Nymph of a Fountain, brought us into her brook; we cro<U+017F>t her
waters, and were not wet to my thinking; for they divided to give us a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age;
making over us a vault of chry<U+017F>tal, under which was a plea<U+017F>ant walk. At length we
came to her Grot, which was <U+017F>et out with more branches of corral, ordinary <U+017F>tones,
mother of pearl, and all <U+017F>orts of <U+017F>hells, then all tho<U+017F>e of St. <hi>Germains.</hi> There <U+017F>he
made us a magnificent collation; where <hi>I</hi> learn'd that trees eat, and are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
depriv'd of all the contentments of this world. But all that's nothing to the
plea<U+017F>ure of being among Nymphs <U+017F>o fair as was our ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s; before whom <hi>Diana</hi>
was <U+017F>o much a<U+017F>ham'd to appear, that <U+017F>he for the mo<U+017F>t part vail'd her <U+017F>elf with a
cloud. O! <U+017F>hall <hi>I</hi> tell the re<U+017F>t! <U+017F>hall <hi>I</hi> pre<U+017F>ume to divulge tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ilent care<U+017F><U+017F>es,
whereof <hi>I</hi> receiv'd the favour, without entreaty? Yes, <hi>I</hi> dare tell thee, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thou come near me, and that this <hi>Zephyr</hi> which flies about here overhear it not:
he's <U+017F>uch a babler, that as <U+017F>oon as he knows any thing of news, he tells it every
where, and blows it into the ears of tho<U+017F>e that pa<U+017F>s by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> being come near, his Ma<U+017F>ter went on in his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and told him the
<U+017F>ecret; which was, that he had ki<U+017F>t his Nymph, and had touch'd her brea<U+017F>t. As <hi>I</hi>
am an hone<U+017F>t man, Ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> oblige me to what you plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that
you force me not to believe what you now tell me. I am but <U+017F>o much the gladder to
hear thee <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>eeing thou wilt not believe me: I infer, that my
felicity is <U+017F>o great that it is incredible: and if henceforward I endeavor to prove
any thing I <U+017F>ay to thee, it <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ignifie no more, then that it hath not been my
fault that thou ha<U+017F>t not believed me.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was <U+017F>aying this, <hi>Carmelin</hi> did nothing but <U+017F>mell; and at la<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his eyes on the willow, he perceives a yellow liquid matter that ran down from
the top to the bottom. Ah! Ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aies he, drawing backward, what have you
done there? What a na<U+017F>ty man are you? if any people of quality come hither to
<U+017F>ee you, they'll <U+017F>poil their cloathes as I have done. Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he took off a
little ordure that was on his cloathes, and with a <U+017F>harp <U+017F>tone <U+017F>crap'd off what was
on the bark of the willow. Gather dear <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> gather it, gather
it; be a good husband, it is the fir<U+017F>t fruits of the tree <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> 'Tis a precious gum that

much, and my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s hither is to know how you do. My ma<U+017F>ter is as well as can
be, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he eats and drinks like a man. Is it true, incomparable <hi>Willow!</hi>
<U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme?</hi> I am not <U+017F>o called, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> How then? <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme.</hi> I am
called <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ays he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> upon this was of opinion, <U+017F>eeing he fed quietly, and would be called
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that he had recovered his wits again, and that he did no longer imagine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
a Tree, which indeed was the madne<U+017F>s of his madne<U+017F>s; I mean a <U+017F>econd mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
added to the fir<U+017F>t, which was that of turning Shepherd. But when he asked him
whether he would come and breakfa<U+017F>t at <hi>Clarimon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'s,</hi> he an<U+017F>wer'd, that the <hi>Rural
Deities</hi> did not eat in the day, and that he kept his <U+017F>tomach till night, at which time
he was to fea<U+017F>t with tho<U+017F>e of his own condition, and not with mortals. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> was
much troubled that he had <U+017F>o much over-reckon'd him<U+017F>elf, and that he found him
<U+017F>till in his error: So that coming neer him, he gave him an account how he had
<U+017F>pent the night before, which made him hope he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>pend a many more as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily;
but more particularly he told him who had put that flat box on his head,
which was much like the gilt in<U+017F>criptions over Saints heads in Country-Churches.
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> having had a <U+017F>hort relation of all this, did more then <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect it was <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
had plaid the<U+017F>e tricks with him: He pre<U+017F>ently goes his way to <hi>Clarimond's</hi> to
give him and <hi>Montenor</hi> the <U+017F>tory; and as <U+017F>oon as they had broke fa<U+017F>t, they went to
<U+017F>ee this counterfeit God of the River, who found them much more <U+017F>port when he
told them all the particularities of this nocturnal adventure. They would have been
very glad for once to have known <U+017F>o much as he did; <U+017F>o that making it their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
to go and vi<U+017F>it <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> at night with the other Deities, they re<U+017F>olved not to <U+017F>ee
him all that day, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould have had any occa<U+017F>ion to per<U+017F>wade him he was no
Tree, and that if he <U+017F>hould believe it, they <U+017F>hould mi<U+017F>s the contentment they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
'Tis true indeed, that <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> having taken him into his charge out of the hands
of his Kin<U+017F>man, was obliged to endeavour the cure of his folly; nor indeed was he
wanting as to the de<U+017F>ire to do it: but he thought fit to delay it as long as he could;
and if he pretended to per<U+017F>wade him to come out of the Willow, 'twas only to carry
him up and down, and by his means make oftner vi<U+017F>its to <hi>Angelica:</hi> So that he
would not do much, till he had made otherwi<U+017F>e all the <U+017F>port he could with him.
<hi>Hircan</hi> being of the <U+017F>ame opinion, they plotted together how to make <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> a man
again by a <U+017F>econd Metamorpho<U+017F>is, when they had made what mirth they could with
him as he was; for they were <U+017F>omwhat afraid he might really come to <U+017F>ome hurt,
if he <U+017F>hould continue long in his habitation of the <hi>Willow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had all this while the company of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who <U+017F>et on him <U+017F>till with a
many notable objections, to <U+017F>hew that he was no Tree: but <U+017F>eeing that he prevail'd
nothing, he left him and went home for his dinner, which he had forgotten to bring
with him. Tho<U+017F>e who had ob<U+017F>erv'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> a di<U+017F>creet per<U+017F>on in <U+017F>ome other things, and
for the mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>poke eloquently, will haply be much amaz'd to find him <U+017F>o <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriack,</hi>
as to imagine him<U+017F>elf a <hi>Tree:</hi> But they are to believe, that in all this
there is not any contradiction or difficulty; and that this Shepherd, though he <U+017F>aw
all the world derided his opinion, yet did <U+017F>till per<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in it, and had been much di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
to quit it, out of a de<U+017F>ire he had it <U+017F>hould be true, that <U+017F>o he might rai<U+017F>e the
greater admiration in others.</p>
            <p>While he was deeply engag'd in his frantick imaginations, two men on hor<U+017F>-back
rode along in a way not far from his tree: They perceiv'd his head with a box on
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43725:92"/>
it; and not being able at a di<U+017F>tance to di<U+017F>cover what that antick figure meant, they
were <U+017F>o curious as to go to him. How now! what do you there friend, <U+017F>ays one to
him; are you put to <U+017F>care away the birds? Methinks there's no great nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of
it, here's no hemp-yard hereabouts. Or is't not that you are a hunting, and that
you have laid your Nets <U+017F>omewhere? Have you not al<U+017F>o put <U+017F>ome Lime-twigs on
your head? The Bird-lime, methinks, comes down along your hair; 'tis very ill
be<U+017F>towed there for to take any thing.</p>
            <p>This he <U+017F>pake becau<U+017F>e of the Marmalet which trickled down <hi>Ly<U+017F>is's</hi> head. But
the <hi>rural Demy-god</hi> an<U+017F>wers them thus: Pre<U+017F>ume not to enquire of any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
me, ye prophane men! Get you gone hence, and come not within a hundred
paces, le<U+017F>t you pollute a <U+017F>acred place. He that had <U+017F>poke la<U+017F>t, knowing by this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was not of the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t, was content only to <U+017F>trike him with his wand
over the wooden bonnet, and <U+017F>lighting him, kept on his way with his Companion.
The blow he gave him <U+017F>truck down the box over his no<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that he could not <U+017F>ee
any thing; which importun'd him much, becau<U+017F>e the Flies <U+017F>warming to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malet,
took occa<U+017F>ion to tickle him in the face. Now both his arms were <U+017F>tretch'd
out and held by the branches of the Willow, according to his wonted po<U+017F>ture; and
tho<U+017F>e he dur<U+017F>t not let go, believing he ought always to be in that po<U+017F>ture, to make
it appear that he was a Tree; and that if he had made u<U+017F>e of his hands, and <U+017F>ome
one <U+017F>hould haply over<U+017F>ee him, he mu<U+017F>t needs think he derogated from his quality.
All his remedy was to <U+017F>hake his head, which he did <U+017F>o effectually, that the third time
he <U+017F>hook down the Box, and was not much troubled at the lo<U+017F>s of it, by rea<U+017F>on he
began to be weary of it. A little after comes <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>uffering his Flock to feed
as he came, and feeding him<U+017F>elf on a piece of bread and bacon. I forgot one thing
I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>aid to <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> erewhile, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I <U+017F>hould have de<U+017F>ired him to
<U+017F>end me my Gittarrhe for to recreate my <U+017F>elf in my <U+017F>olitude, but more particularly
for to bear a part at night with the other Divinities. Why <U+017F>hould not I be <U+017F>uffered
to do <U+017F>o? I have <U+017F>een a <hi>Cypre<U+017F>s</hi> that plays well on the Violin: we have now the
<U+017F>ame Sciences as we had when we were humane, and our Exerci<U+017F>es are alike. I tell
you once more, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that I'll never believe a <hi>Cypre<U+017F>s-tree</hi> can play on
a Fiddle, unle<U+017F>s I <U+017F>ee it. There is a remedy for all this, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Become a
Tree, and thou <U+017F>halt <U+017F>ee all the miracles done by <U+017F>uch as we are: I would to god
thou would<U+017F>t! and that thou wert planted by my <U+017F>ide, that we might recreate our
<U+017F>elves by <U+017F>ome excellent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es: There are other trees good <U+017F>tore about me, but
they <U+017F>peak not; and if there by any <hi>Demy-gods</hi> or <hi>Demy-godde<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> under their barks,
they are very ill condition'd. If a man could be a tree only for one day, replies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> not to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, I <U+017F>hould willingly be one, <U+017F>uch is my de<U+017F>ire to know
whether all you have told me be true. But what <U+017F>hould I do to be of your quality?
Thou mu<U+017F>t mention it to the gods, and in the mean time be in love with <U+017F>ome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. That will require a long time, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and I am impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
My advice then is, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that thou make a deep pit in the earth, and
thru<U+017F>t thy <U+017F>elf into it up to the belly; it may come to pa<U+017F>s, that thy legs may take
root and fa<U+017F>ten in the earth, and then 'tis but for <U+017F>ome friend of thine to come and
water thee, that thou may<U+017F>t blo<U+017F><U+017F>om. Go <U+017F>eek others to follow your advice, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> I have no mind to rot alive: Think you it would be a fine <U+017F>ight to <U+017F>ee
me planted there without any means or <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence? 'twere <U+017F>uch an humour as
would invite all within fifty leagues about to come and <U+017F>ee me; I had rather at any
adventure lock my <U+017F>elf up, as you do, in the belly of a Willow. Have I not once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told thee that I was not in a Willow, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> what makes thee forge all
the<U+017F>e <hi>Chymaera's?</hi> I'll <U+017F>peak no more, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> I de<U+017F>ire only to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I may <U+017F>ee the recreations you have in the night, without adding to the number
of trees. I know not, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for Divinities have <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ubtile bodies, that
men cannot perceive them; however the trial <U+017F>hall co<U+017F>t thee nothing.</p>
            <p>The ma<U+017F>ter and the man had divers other di<U+017F>putes on this <U+017F>ubject; and <hi>Carmelin</hi>
at la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olv'd to participate in the adventures of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. The
dancing and ki<U+017F><U+017F>es whereof he had <U+017F>poken to him, <U+017F>o tickled his imagination, that he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43725:92"/>
would very fain make one in a company that <U+017F>pent their time <U+017F>o well. But the great
charm of all was the <hi>Collation,</hi> whereof he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome proofs, which almo<U+017F>t convinc'd
him of all the re<U+017F>t. He had <U+017F>tumbled on the box of Marmalet, which was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of the Banquet; and though good <U+017F>tore of earth had gotten in, yet did he
not <U+017F>tick to take out what was in't, and when he had done, lick'd it about with his
tongue. Being drawn in by the<U+017F>e delicacies, he brings home his Flock betimes, and
leaving word that they <U+017F>hould not look for him that night, he returns to his ma<U+017F>ter.
Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e then was of their future entertainments: And among other things
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> told <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that if he could enter him into the fraternity of the <hi>Rural
Deities,</hi> he knew an <hi>Hamadryad</hi> that might he wrought on to be his wife; and that
if her complexion was not <U+017F>o delicate, <U+017F>he had in amends a <U+017F>trong and lively body.
That would not be ami<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> for I do not love tho<U+017F>e women that play
the cockney <U+017F>o much: But I'll have a good portion with her. 'Tis a great que<U+017F>tion
whether the<U+017F>e Nymphs have any thing in marriage, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> We <U+017F>hall further
con<U+017F>ider of it, when we come to the beating of the bu<U+017F>h.</p>
            <p>It was by this time pretty far in the night, when <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who lay at the foot of
the tree, was overcome by <U+017F>leep, though the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of his Ma<U+017F>ter were very diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
What pitty it is that the adventures of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hapned in a place <U+017F>o little advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
for his glory, and the profit of the people! He was in a Country <U+017F>o de<U+017F>art, that
all the day there were but two men <U+017F>aw him; and now the night was come, there
was none to hear the excellent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es he had with <hi>Carmelin.</hi> If <U+017F>uch brave things
had been done within a league of <hi>Paris,</hi> as it might be at <hi>Charenton</hi> or <hi>Gentilly,</hi>
what a world of people would have come to vi<U+017F>it two <U+017F>uch rare per<U+017F>ons! But it <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
that the brave Nobility thereabouts were acquainted with them, that by that
means his friends might have an account of him.</p>
            <p>The time of the Mask being come, <hi>Lucida,</hi> who had all the while remained at
<hi>Hircan's,</hi> was cloathed as <U+017F>he had been the night before, as al<U+017F>o <hi>Synopa,</hi> the <hi>Cypre<U+017F>s,</hi>
and the <hi>Hamadryads.</hi> As for <hi>An<U+017F>elme, Montenor,</hi> and <hi>Clarimond,</hi> they were clad as
Gods of the River like <hi>Hircan,</hi> that <U+017F>o they might not <U+017F>peak, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould be
di<U+017F>cover'd. The whole troop of the<U+017F>e ha<U+017F>ty Divinities being coached, alighted about
a quarter of a league from the place where was the incomparable <hi>Willow.</hi> The <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s</hi>
playd on his Violin, and the re<U+017F>t followed him dancing. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
<U+017F>leep, <U+017F>oon heard the harmony, and pre<U+017F>ently calls out to <hi>Carmelin:</hi> Awake
thou lazy fellow, awake! The Nymphs are come; prepare they eloquence, that
when they <U+017F>hall ask thee any thing, if they take thee for a man, it may not be
for an ordinary per<U+017F>on. Call to mind the <hi>Common-places,</hi> through which Learning
hath been <hi><U+017F>iring'd</hi> into thy mind, by which means thou ha<U+017F>t not been troubled with
the reading of any ancient Author. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was awaked by the<U+017F>e words, which he
imperfectly or half heard: And his ma<U+017F>ter by this time perceiving the <hi>divine</hi> troop,
got cheerfully out of his tree, to <U+017F>hew his diligence to receive them. <hi>Lucida</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him fir<U+017F>t, he made her a low conge: which the Nymph returning, ask'd him
how he had done <U+017F>ince their la<U+017F>t interview. I have always been very jovial, an<U+017F>wers
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and I am <U+017F>ure my branches have ever <U+017F>ince been very flouri<U+017F>hing, for I liv'd
in hope to <U+017F>ee you again: And be<U+017F>ides I have good news to tell you; and that is,
that I con<U+017F>idered that I am not a <hi>Willow,</hi> but the <hi>tree Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> a tree whereof the name
was never known before; and I know there comes out of me a certain Drug more
precious then Amber. Seeing every one brings hither of their own Fruits, and
that your <hi>Hamadryads</hi> furni<U+017F>h us of their <hi>Cherries</hi> and <hi>Apricocks,</hi> I am <U+017F>orry I have
not brought what my Bark brings forth: You might have dry'd it in the <U+017F>un to
make Neck-laces and Bracelets of it. The Deities were very much plea<U+017F>ed at this
imagination; but they would have had more <U+017F>port, had they known what amber
he <U+017F>pake of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who who was much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o many <U+017F>trange per<U+017F>ons, was in
<U+017F>uch a fear, that he dur<U+017F>t not but keep clo<U+017F>e to his ma<U+017F>ter: So that <hi>Synopa</hi> having
perceiv'd him, Dear brother! <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who is that behind you? Who
<U+017F>hould it be! an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> See you not it is my <U+017F>hadow, and that the Moon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43725:93"/>
<U+017F>hines very bright? No <U+017F>uch matter, <U+017F>ays <hi>Synopa;</hi> I <U+017F>mell raw fle<U+017F>h here, we are
betrayed: Here is a Mortal; let us be gone, my companions! With the<U+017F>e words
<U+017F>he runs away as fa<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he could, and was immediately follow'd by the whole troop.
So that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> be<U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf to run after them, <U+017F>peaking to them as loud as he could
in the<U+017F>e words: Whither run you dear <hi>Divinities!</hi> <U+017F>tay a little; He whom you
<U+017F>hun is but a mi<U+017F>erable Shepherd: If you <U+017F>tay not here, he and other men will have
<U+017F>ome ground to believe that you fear them, <U+017F>ince you dare not appear before
them.</p>
            <p>All that ran away were by the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>tay'd; and being a<U+017F><U+017F>embled in a meadow,
they made as if they had taken heart, and ask'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> who he was that accompanied
him. 'Tis the Shepherd <hi>Carmelin,</hi> an<U+017F>wers he: When I was a man, he was my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of fortune; that <U+017F>hould oblige you to e<U+017F>teem him, were there no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on;
but be<U+017F>ides that, he hath many excellent perfections: Fear not to <U+017F>hew your
<U+017F>elves to him. <hi>Juno, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> <U+017F>hewed them<U+017F>elves to <hi>Paris,</hi> who was a little
lewd Ra<U+017F>cal, that was not <U+017F>o good a man as he. This man is a Shepherd who <U+017F>tands
upon his honour and reputation; and to tell you the <U+017F>ecret of all, it was his de<U+017F>ire
to <U+017F>ee our nocturial recreations. This curio<U+017F>ity proceeds from an ingenuity, which
ought not to be fru<U+017F>trated of its expectation: We mu<U+017F>t hear tho<U+017F>e that invoke us.
We will receive him into our company, <U+017F>ays <hi>Synopa,</hi> on condition he'll be faithfull.
He <U+017F>hall be, as I am a <hi>gummy Tree,</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> But by your favour, I <U+017F>ee three
Divinities which I know not. They are Gods of Rivers who are come with <hi>Morin,</hi>
<U+017F>ays <hi>Synopa;</hi> they live <U+017F>ometimes in the <hi>Sein,</hi> and <U+017F>ometimes in the <hi>Marn. Ly<U+017F>is</hi> upon
that faultes them, and they embraced him, a little more gently then their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had done the night before. That done, <hi>Lucida</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he would bring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
into a very plea<U+017F>ant place; and going before them, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ted not till they had
gone a quarter of a league. <hi>Carmelin</hi> went among the re<U+017F>t, but not without much
re<U+017F>pect, <U+017F>till holding his Ma<U+017F>ter by the skirt, le<U+017F>t they might lo<U+017F>e him.</p>
            <p>When they were come into a <U+017F>quare Clo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o well be<U+017F>et with trees, that it was
almo<U+017F>t like a Hall, the <hi>Cypre<U+017F>s</hi> plaid Coranto's, and the Gods of the River took in
the Nymphs to dance. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> admired their good di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions: but <hi>Lucida</hi> took
him off that admiration, telling him they had learn'd to dance from their <hi>Carpes.</hi>
There being no reputation to <U+017F>trive with them that way, he would not dance but to
Songs. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was in the dance, wherein there was required <U+017F>uch activity as
made him glad to find his legs. This exerci<U+017F>e having wearied them all, they <U+017F>ate
down on the gra<U+017F>s; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> made it his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to inform him<U+017F>elf of the new
Gods of the Rivers. <hi>Synopa</hi> told him, they never had been men, nor had not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
any metamorpho<U+017F>is, but were the children of others Gods, and yet could
not <U+017F>peak. This pa<U+017F>t, it was propo<U+017F>ed to go to <U+017F>ome little verbal recreations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
the Gods of the Rivers were not fit, becau<U+017F>e there was always <U+017F>ome word to be
<U+017F>poken. They therefore withdrew from that diverti<U+017F>ement, and were content to
li<U+017F>ten to the harmony of <hi>Morin</hi>'s Lute. <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was bu<U+017F>ie at play with the
re<U+017F>t, thought the time very tedious, and the <hi>Collation</hi> long a coming; <U+017F>o that ever
and anon he was at his Ma<U+017F>ter asking, And when comes this <hi>con<U+017F>olation? Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thus
importun'd, knew no remedy better then to find him <U+017F>ome excellent employment
to divert his mind; and having broke off the game they were at, My fair ones!
<U+017F>ays he to the Nymphs, now <U+017F>hall you receive the incomparable <U+017F>atisfaction of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my gentle Shepherd. And thereupon turning to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he <U+017F>ays to him, Make
a <U+017F>peech in the <hi>demon<U+017F>trative</hi> kind, in commendation of the<U+017F>e <hi>Nayads</hi> and <hi>Hama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryads,</hi>
and tho<U+017F>e <hi>aquatick</hi> Gods. Excu<U+017F>e me, Sir, I be<U+017F>eech you, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Carmelin;</hi>
my books <U+017F>peak not of any <U+017F>uch Nations. What <U+017F>aye<U+017F>t thou, ignorant Sot! <U+017F>ays
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> wilt thou make me be affronted, in not an<U+017F>wering to what is expected from
thee? mu<U+017F>t my boughs, which are always <hi>green,</hi> now put on <hi>red,</hi> and <hi>blu<U+017F>h</hi> for <U+017F>hame
of thee? Come hither, <U+017F>ays he, <U+017F>peaking to him in his ear, knowe<U+017F>t thou nothing
where there is mention of <hi>Beauty,</hi> or the effects of <hi>Love?</hi> That thou mu<U+017F>t in the
fir<U+017F>t place <U+017F>peak to the<U+017F>e Nymphs, and afterwards thou may<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider of a <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick</hi>
of the Gods. I can di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e excellently on <hi>Beauty,</hi> replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> let
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43725:93"/>
me alone: can you not at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak as you <U+017F>hould, I can never under<U+017F>tand one half
of your barbarous names, you <U+017F>peak nothing but Latine to me. In three words of
yours, there are ever four cannot be under<U+017F>tood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having thus <U+017F>aid, kneel'd down on one knee before the Nymphs, and
made them this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Fair Ladies, hide your bright eyes from me, they make me
dye: yet no, do not hide them, they give me life; yet do, for they have <U+017F>toln away my
heart: yet do not, for if they had taken away my heart, they had with it taken away
my <U+017F>oul.</hi> And this is in the fir<U+017F>t Chapter of my book of <hi>Collections:</hi> The <U+017F>econd
<U+017F>peaks thus much, <hi>O</hi> BRIGHT EYES! <hi>you are not eyes, but Suns: Suns!
no, ye are Gods: but <U+017F>ince you are Gods, how comes it you are the cau<U+017F>ers of my death?
Alas! I <U+017F>ee you are eyes as to your E<U+017F><U+017F>ence; Suns for your brightne<U+017F>s; and Gods for
your power; and that the occa<U+017F>ion of your coming down on earth, is to make me <U+017F>uffer.</hi>
I wi<U+017F>h I knew what to <U+017F>ay to the<U+017F>e Gentlemen with the great beards; but I believe
there is not any book extant that mentions them, and it may be, they are deaf as
well as dumb. Get thee gone, <U+017F>eeing thy di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es are <U+017F>o impertinent, cryes out
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> What need was there thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak of thy <hi>Collections?</hi> And mu<U+017F>t
thou withal, <U+017F>o far forget re<U+017F>pect, as to <U+017F>peak to <hi>Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> as if thou wert in love
with them? Why may he not, replies <hi>Lucida,</hi> he <U+017F>hall not be di<U+017F>dain'd: he <U+017F>hall
have for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s the greater of the <hi>Hamadryads.</hi> I give you thanks for him,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> he <U+017F>hall endeavor to de<U+017F>erve this favor; be pleas'd to excu<U+017F>e him, if
you think he hath committed any folly; for the <U+017F>plendor of your bright faces had
<U+017F>o dazled him, that he was quite out of him<U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucida</hi> upon that viewing <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>aw he had not on the fine cap they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tow'd
on him; She ask'd him the rea<U+017F>on of it, and withal told him, he was very
negligent of his health. I have already told you that my body was impa<U+017F><U+017F>ible,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and be<U+017F>ides, as for your fine covering, I have ca<U+017F>t it away for this
rea<U+017F>on, that among all the <hi>Gods,</hi> I never <U+017F>aw any one pictur'd with a hat on, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
it be <hi>Mercurie,</hi> who wears one as the badge of his dignity; and as for <hi>Heroes</hi>
and illu<U+017F>trious per<U+017F>ons, I have ever ob<U+017F>erv'd them bare headed, unle<U+017F>s it were <U+017F>ome
few that had helmets on; but that proves nothing, they wore them not but in
fights.</p>
            <p>There had been advanc'd more <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>iderations, had not <hi>Synopa</hi> come and
<U+017F>aid, that they had di<U+017F>cours'd <U+017F>ufficiently; and that it was time to collation. <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
commended her a thou<U+017F>and times within him<U+017F>elf for her profitable advice, while
the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> di<U+017F>charg'd their baskets of a many good things they had brought
and di<U+017F>pos'd them on the green gra<U+017F>s, which was all the Table-cloath they had.
The God <hi>Morin</hi> came near <hi>Synopa,</hi> and told her <U+017F>omewhat in her ear, which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
perceiv'd not: In the mean time <hi>Carmelin</hi> was help'd by his Ma<U+017F>ter with the wing
of a cold Turkey, which he fell pre<U+017F>ently on with his fingers, knowing that hands
were made before knives; but as he was putting a piece into his mouth, <hi>Synopa</hi>
withheld his arm: Be not too ha<U+017F>ty, Shepherd, <U+017F>aies <U+017F>he to him, you are not yet
permitted to eat with us. We mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t wa<U+017F>h you in one of our fountains: What
did <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> dream on, that he hath given you your portion? he was like to <U+017F>erve
us a fine trick. We mu<U+017F>t have gone to the God <hi>Pan,</hi> for to entreat him to purifie us
all. I was ignorant of this Ceremony, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I beg your pardon, if I have done
any thing ami<U+017F>s: I never read what you <U+017F>peak of in any Poet. However, it mu<U+017F>t
be believed <U+017F>o, and good bathing will do <hi>Carmelin</hi> no hurt, it may conduce to his
health. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was thinking what a plea<U+017F>ure it were to be wa<U+017F>h'd by <U+017F>uch fine
Ladies; but he wi<U+017F>h'd it might be ju<U+017F>t then, that <U+017F>o he might collation with the
re<U+017F>t, and he <U+017F>aw they did not make any ha<U+017F>te to do it. They had taken away the
meat from him, and withal fed <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>tly, and with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>tomacks, that there
needed no long time to di<U+017F>patch all that was; which con<U+017F>ideration made him <U+017F>ick
at the heart.</p>
            <p>The Divinities having ended their collation, <hi>Synopa</hi> thought it time to go and
bathe him, and to <U+017F>et all the re<U+017F>t in a forwardne<U+017F>s: but he angrily an<U+017F>wered, that
it was to no purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>eeing there was nothing to be eaten. <hi>Synopa</hi> reply'd, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43725:94"/>
it were <U+017F>o much <U+017F>par'd another night that he <U+017F>hould come and <U+017F>ee them.
Then comes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and whi<U+017F>pers to him, bidding him go where ere they <U+017F>hould carry
him, and that it would be a means for him to <U+017F>ee the Grots of the <hi>Nayads,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>tly de<U+017F>ired to go. <hi>Carmelin</hi> crediting him, went quietly with
the fair Deities; but when they were come to the brook of <hi>Lucida</hi>'s fountain:
<hi>Synopa</hi> <U+017F>aies to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> for your part, you need not be pre<U+017F>ent at our My<U+017F>teries,
<hi>Morin</hi> you <U+017F>ee, and two of the Gods of the River have left us, go your ways with
them. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who earne<U+017F>tly de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee their ceremonies, that he might be
initated in the divine Science, was much troubled, that he was forc'd to leave them.
But he was fain to go with <hi>Morin,</hi> and the two other Gods, who were <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi>
and <hi>Clarimond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Synopa, Lucida, Montenor,</hi> the <hi>Humadryads,</hi> and the <hi>Cypre<U+017F>s,</hi>
took <hi>Carmelin</hi> by the head and feet, and threw him into the water in his cloaths,
in a certain place that was deep enough. He found not <U+017F>o much plea<U+017F>ure in his
handling as he had imagin'd, but it was much wor<U+017F>e with him when the <hi>Cypre<U+017F>s</hi>
<U+017F>aid, that he mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>tripp'd <U+017F>tark naked. When he had put off his breeches and
doublet, they tyed him by the arms to a willow that was on the bank, as if it had
been a piece of the ceremony; which done, they turn'd up his <U+017F>hirt, and whipp'd
him <U+017F>o long with Ozier twigs, that from crying mercy and begging, he fell a rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heartily at all the company; but <hi>Lucida</hi> told him, that the water could not
clean<U+017F>e him; and that there was within him a corrupt blood that mu<U+017F>t be whipt
out, ere he could be made <U+017F>o pure as to be admitted to conver<U+017F>e with the Deities.</p>
            <p>All having done him what mi<U+017F>chief they could, they return'd to their Randez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz,
and left him fa<U+017F>t tyed. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being by this time come near the place, where
his tree was, took leave of the <hi>Aquatick</hi> Deities, who bid him farewell, by <U+017F>igns
with the hands and conges. Being left all alone, he was much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd that he
could not finde his abode, though the appearance of <hi>Auroroa</hi> made it <U+017F>omewhat
light. <hi>Hircan</hi> de<U+017F>irous to try all means to bring him out of his imagination, had
given order, that while he was ab<U+017F>ent, his willow <U+017F>hould be cut down at the root,
and carry quite away. Be<U+017F>ides all which, the place was <U+017F>o well made up with fre<U+017F>h
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urfs, that he could not perceive there ever had been any. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeks all about,
and his hollow brain wanted no matter of imaginations upon this accident: Yet
though he could not finde his willow, he did <U+017F>till imagine him<U+017F>elf a tree; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>ome body coming, he planted him<U+017F>elf near the place where the willow had
<U+017F>tood: and becau<U+017F>e he would do nothing before men, that were contrary to his
nature, he lifted up his arms, and widened his fingers, as though they had been
brances.</p>
            <p>In this po<U+017F>ture doth <hi>Hircan</hi> appear to him, in the <U+017F>ame black <U+017F>uit which he had
when he delivered him out of the danger he was in at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s. O Tree! <U+017F>aies the
Magician to him, my will is, that from henceforth thou become a man. 'Tis not in
thy power to do it, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> they are the great Gods that have Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd
me. The greate<U+017F>t Gods have but the power of Dwarfs if compar'd to me,
replies <hi>Hircan;</hi> and I will now <U+017F>hew thee the power of my charms. While he <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>o, he made a circle about him with a rod he had in his hand; which done, he read
certain barbarous words out of a great book. I <U+017F>ee I mu<U+017F>t double my Enchantments,
<U+017F>ays he to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for thou art <U+017F>o <U+017F>elf-will'd, that thou re<U+017F>i<U+017F>te<U+017F>t them. What would<U+017F>t
thou do? replies he, would<U+017F>t thou deprive me of all happine<U+017F>s? Let me alone,
thou know'<U+017F>t not what is fit for thee, replies <hi>Hircan:</hi> thou <U+017F>halt immediately be a
man, in <U+017F>pight of heaven<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> earth and hell; and <U+017F>eeing thou wilt not get out of thy
bark to come to me, I will cau<U+017F>e the winds to blow thee down. Thou <U+017F>halt be put
out of thy abiding place, and <U+017F>halt <U+017F>ee that I can command all the powers of the
world. <hi>O you Kings of the air, and bee<U+017F>oms of the earth</hi> (goes he on with a louder
voyce) you winds <hi>which blow, the one from the one quarter, and the other from the
othtr;</hi> that is to <U+017F>ay, <hi>from the North, and from the South. And you Boreas and Au<U+017F>ter,
I do conjure you by the pantofles of</hi> Fate, <hi>the old Gallogaskins of</hi> Saturn, <hi>and the
Clo<U+017F>e-<U+017F>tool of</hi> Pro<U+017F>erpina, <hi>and by whatever el<U+017F>e is venerable, and augu<U+017F>t in the world,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43725:94"/>
that you blow again<U+017F>t this tree, and bring it down in <U+017F>uch manner, as that it lo<U+017F>e its
vigor, and that I may change its form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as the Magician had pronounc'd the<U+017F>e words, behold there appear'd a
brace of knaves all clad with feathers: He had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aid to them, <hi>O winds do
your duty!</hi> but they began to blow one on the one <U+017F>ide, and the other on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> with certain bellows they had. Their cheeks withal were flu<U+017F>h'd and
fiery, <U+017F>o that they <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>o <U+017F>wollen up, as if they had been al<U+017F>o to blow with their
mouthes, when they were weary the other way. Their action was <U+017F>o effectual on
the imagination of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that he thought they did him <U+017F>ome violence; and as
if he had been much <U+017F>haken, one while he bowed one way, another while another
yet kept his feet as firmly to the ground as he could. At length, after a good
while's re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, the North-wind blew <U+017F>o violently, that he thought there was no
way but to give place to him: <U+017F>o that being quite amaz'd at it, he fell to the ground.
The winds pre<U+017F>ently vani<U+017F>h'd, or rather fled away; and the Magician having invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
all the powers of the Univer<U+017F>e, pour'd <U+017F>ome water out of a viol he had about
him on <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s head, and afterward <U+017F>prinkled it with du<U+017F>t <hi>O tree</hi> (<U+017F>ays he in the
action) <hi>my charms <U+017F>hall control the power of the Gods; and I now re<U+017F>tore unto thee
the form and nature of a man, which they had taken from thee. I command thee to ri<U+017F>e
up. Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ri<U+017F>e up immediately; but thinking to <U+017F>peak to the Magician, he had made
<U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te to get away from him, that he knew not which way he was gone; and as
for his part, he was in <U+017F>uch a fright, that he could not follow him. <hi>Hircan</hi> being
come to the place where the whole company <U+017F>taid for him in the Coach, got in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o,
and return'd to his own hou<U+017F>e. 'Twas <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> who were di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
and per<U+017F>onated the winds: but as they had been much pleas'd to <U+017F>ee the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tures

            <p>The imaginations which before had di<U+017F>turbed his brains, were now di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed,

return'd to his ho<U+017F>t, where having found his hat and <U+017F>heephook, he put him<U+017F>elf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his former Equipage; and having whi<U+017F>tled to his dog, that <U+017F>lept at the door, he
renew'd his acquaintance with him. He drove out his flock out of the fold, and
brought it into the fields to graze, thinking him<U+017F>elf oblig'd to return to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

very <U+017F>tayedly, as it had been a man taken up with <U+017F>ome
high thoughts; and gravely lifted up his <U+017F>heephook at every
<U+017F>tep, as a <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Pilgrim doth his <U+017F>taff. He had not gone a

a <U+017F>econd Metamorpho<U+017F>is; I now <U+017F>alute you in the quality of a <hi>Shepherd:</hi> there is
<hi>Hircan,</hi> who hath made me rea<U+017F><U+017F>ume my pri<U+017F>tine form. We are as glad of this,
<U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> as we were <U+017F>orry to have lo<U+017F>t you. But what do you think of it? are
you of our opinion? All I can <U+017F>ay, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> is, that I mu<U+017F>t have patience in
<U+017F>pight of my teeth. It's true, I had much plea<U+017F>ure when I was a <hi>Tree:</hi> but if it be
decreed I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o no more, I mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olve to <U+017F>ubmit: I <U+017F>uffer nothing now

<hi>Charite.</hi> Your con<U+017F>tancie is commendable, my friend, <U+017F>ays <hi>Hircan;</hi> and you are to
know that before you were made Man again, I had much ado to get up into heaven

what <U+017F>hould become of you for the future, le<U+017F>t I might have undertaken <U+017F>omewhat

but Shepherd, if I may be <U+017F>o bold, what's become of your <U+017F>ervant <hi>Carmelin?</hi>
Alas! now I think on't, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I doubt the Nymphs have gotten him away. He
was with me the la<U+017F>t night among tho<U+017F>e of the Divine company, whom he charm'd
with his eloquence, They made me believe that they had a de<U+017F>ign to bathe him for
purification-<U+017F>ake, but would not <U+017F>uffer me to be pre<U+017F>ent: <U+017F>o that now I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they had <U+017F>ome ill de<U+017F>ign, for he hath not yet been at his lodging. The Nymphs
have many nobler <U+017F>ervants then he, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> It may be that, <U+017F>ince he left
them, <U+017F>ome wilde bea<U+017F>t hath devour'd him. Alas! it may be thou fir<U+017F>t the nail

<hi>Carmelin?</hi> How have my thoughts been taken up till now, that I have not look'd
after him? Let us now do it; 'tis fit we had a care of him, his lo<U+017F>s would be very
con<U+017F>iderable.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he cro<U+017F>s'd the fields up and down, and all the re<U+017F>t follow'd him:
He cry'd out as loud as he could, <hi>Carmelin, Carmelin,</hi> where art thou? my Friend,
my Minion, my Delight, my Love. And <U+017F>eeing he an<U+017F>wered not; Que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F>s,
<U+017F>aies he, he is dead: we mu<U+017F>t provide for his Monument, and his Funeral Oration.
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> at length came to the brook of <hi>Lucida,</hi> and as he walk'd along it, renew'd
his crying, Where art thou <hi>Carmelin?</hi> and pre<U+017F>ently he heard a voyce, <U+017F>aying,
Here I am my dear Ma<U+017F>ter; have compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable Shepherd that
lives. Upon that he doubles his pace, and findes the poor <hi>Carmelin</hi> half naked tied
to a tree. Who hath fa<U+017F>tened thee there, my Friend? <U+017F>ays he to him. What <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
people have thus affronted <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition? No other but your <hi>Imps</hi>
hereabout, that have dragg'd me into their <hi>Crocks,</hi> replies <hi>Carmelin.</hi> Thy mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that the Nymphs and the Cypre<U+017F>s have carried thee into their
<hi>Grots.</hi> Very right, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> the Devil take their Dances, their Sports and
their Collations, if a man mu<U+017F>t buy the <U+017F>ight of them with <U+017F>o much mi<U+017F>chief as they
have done me. Thou may'<U+017F>t haply be mi<U+017F>taken in them, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> I am not, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> they were the very <U+017F>ame, let me be untyed, and I'll tell you more. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Hircan,</hi> who carried a knife in his <U+017F>word <U+017F>cabbard, cut the mi<U+017F>chievous garters
wherewith they had tyed him. When he had gotten his cloathes on, he related
what had hapned to him, whereat every one extreamly wondred; for the Nymphs
were not accounted <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>chievous as he made them. But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> interrupting his <U+017F>tory
came and <U+017F>aid to him, Be not troubled, the mi<U+017F>chief is pa<U+017F>t; and in recompence
thereof, I'll tell thee what thou <U+017F>halt be very glad of. Know then, what came not
yet into my minde to tell thee, <hi>I am no tree,</hi> I am the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> My vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath al<U+017F>o hindered me to inform my <U+017F>elf of it, replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> yet I <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected you had chang'd nature. Fair weather after it; let's forget what is
pa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing you will have it <U+017F>o, But above all things, let me not be entreated to
come any more among tho<U+017F>e fine Dames I <U+017F>aw la<U+017F>t night, it may be they are evil
<U+017F>pirits. I de<U+017F>ire not to have any thing to do with people of the other world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, was ready to go with the re<U+017F>t, but that he wanted his
hat. The Nymphs had not left it with his cloathes; after they had plaid with it a
good while, they had ca<U+017F>t it into the bryars, far from that place, where they were
<U+017F>ure he would not look for it. Let's go however, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> I'll give you
another. Nay, it <U+017F>hall not be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I cannot endure to be affronted
out of any thing: <U+017F>hould you give me as many hats as would reach from earth to
heaven: I would not lo<U+017F>e my own. You need no more but <U+017F>ummon the Lady-Nymphs
before the Magi<U+017F>trate of the place, <U+017F>aies <hi>An<U+017F>elme.</hi> Do <U+017F>o and fear not, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi>
<U+017F>ee there's a <U+017F>ergeant goes on the road, let's <U+017F>peak to him.</p>
            <p>That <U+017F>aid, they put forward, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> having overtaken the man, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was a Catchpole. My good friend, <U+017F>aies he to him, there are certain indi<U+017F>creet
Ladies have taken my hat from me, without any rea<U+017F>on: Have I not a good action
again<U+017F>t them? That you have without que<U+017F>tion friend, replies the Catchpole:
give me their names and dwellings, I'll <U+017F>ummon them. I mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t acquaint my
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43725:96"/>
Ma<U+017F>ter with it, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin.</hi> She that mu<U+017F>t have committed the Felony, is called
<hi>Lucida,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> as for her dwelling, it is in the <U+017F>ource of a Fountain hard by;
but <U+017F>he is hidden within it <U+017F>o, that thou wilt never finde her poor mortal Serjeant:
For this Arre<U+017F>t there is requi<U+017F>ite a cele<U+017F>tial Serjeant, <U+017F>uch as <hi>Mercury:</hi> As for her
companions who have been Acce<U+017F><U+017F>aries in the Felony, they are fa<U+017F>t in the barks of
trees: where would<U+017F>t thou finde all the<U+017F>e? For thy part <hi>Carmelin,</hi> let fall thy <U+017F>uit;
thou'lt get nothing by quarrelling with <U+017F>tronger then thy <U+017F>elf. The Nymphs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
not Terre<U+017F>trial Judges; or if they <U+017F>ubmit to them they corrupt them, as
they did the Son of <hi>Priamus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Catchpole went his way with this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, thinking they either had been
<U+017F>ome that would abu<U+017F>e him; or that <U+017F>omewhat was ami<U+017F>s in their mindes: In both
which ca<U+017F>es there was nothing to be gotten of them, <U+017F>ince he under<U+017F>tood not what
they <U+017F>aid. <hi>Carmelin</hi> being much troubled that he could have no <U+017F>atisfaction of tho<U+017F>e
felons; began to cry out. Alack! poor hat, mu<U+017F>t I needs lo<U+017F>e thee in the flower of
thine age and beauty? 'Tis very true, thou did<U+017F>t my Grandfather <U+017F>ervice and credit
at his fir<U+017F>t wedding; but thou might<U+017F>t have a long time <U+017F>erv'd my po<U+017F>terity. Ah!
how I grieve for thee, when I remember thou ha<U+017F>t been for <U+017F>o long a time the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
covering of tho<U+017F>e cares and thoughts that were forg'd in my head, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
tabernacle of my Doctrine. Do not weep for't, <U+017F>aies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> its hour was come.
'Twere to no purpo<U+017F>e to erect a Monument for it, as we <U+017F>hould have done for you,
when we gave you for lo<U+017F>t. Be<U+017F>ides, why will you not be comforted, <U+017F>ince you are
promis'd a better? <hi>Carmelin</hi> having recollected him<U+017F>elf a little, re<U+017F>umes the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
thus, But that hat, what <U+017F>hall it be made of, Ma<U+017F>ter, <hi>Fine Wool?</hi> He had not
the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ure to fini<U+017F>h what he intended to have <U+017F>aid; nor had <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> the time to
an<U+017F>wer him, for they all broke out into laughter; e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Montenor,</hi> who knew
that <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> by the Fathers <U+017F>ide came of a race of Merchants, and that <hi>Cloath</hi> and
<hi>Wool</hi> had been the foundation of his <hi>Nobility. Ly<U+017F>is</hi> de<U+017F>irous to end the laughter:
The error was, <U+017F>aies he, for want of a Comma or Parenthe<U+017F>is in the Period. Hear'<U+017F>t
thou <hi>Carmelin?</hi> ob<U+017F>erve it, that thy tran<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition be not deficient.</p>
            <p>The di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the Ma<U+017F>ter was thought as plea<U+017F>ant as that of his man, becau<U+017F>e
his words came out with a certain accent, that gave them great weight. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
him<U+017F>elf was pleas'd with it: but when <hi>Clarimond</hi> was come home, he made him
a much more joyful man, by giving him the hat he had promis'd him, which was
better then his own, though not much. They told him, that if he e<U+017F>teemed pieces
of Antiquity, that was a thing worthy as fair a Cabinet as any medal in the world.
He was almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elf for joy; for if he grieved for the other hat, 'twas
only becau<U+017F>e he had no great hope of this. Notwith<U+017F>tanding all this, he goes to
his Ma<U+017F>ter, to de<U+017F>ire him to de<U+017F>cribe unto him by name and cloathes all the <hi>Rural
Deities,</hi> that <U+017F>o he might know who had done him the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>chief. It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that it was the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> and <hi>Lucida,</hi> but as for <hi>Synopa,</hi> <U+017F>he had not
given him one <U+017F>troke, nay, <U+017F>tood at a di<U+017F>tance, all the while he <U+017F>uffered the la<U+017F>h.
O! what a great my<U+017F>tery is there hidden under that, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to him; thou ha<U+017F>t
ground to believe that <hi>Synopa</hi> is of a very amorous di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition: <U+017F>he hath di<U+017F>cover'd
her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for me, but perceiving that I always disdain'd her, <U+017F>he will henceforward
adore no merit but thine. I did much in<U+017F>pect it, and it is my opinion, <U+017F>he never
look'd on thee as an indifferent per<U+017F>on; <U+017F>o that now I will <U+017F>hew thee how I intend
to bring thee quite out of this trouble! Put the ca<U+017F>e it was <U+017F>he committed the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
on thy hat, thou mu<U+017F>t imagine it was for no other rea<U+017F>on but to keep it in<U+017F>tead
of a favour. I remember <hi>Charite</hi> took away one of my <U+017F>hoes upon the <U+017F>ame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
I know not what love you mean, replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> why did <U+017F>he not a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t
me then? <U+017F>peak no more of her; I do not like her humour. If I mu<U+017F>t have a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s;
be it that Shepherde<U+017F>s whom you <U+017F>poke to me of heretofore. <hi>Charite</hi> hath a
companion called <hi>Jacquelina,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I meant her. Thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t love her, were
there no other rea<U+017F>on but becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he hath a fine name, and becau<U+017F>e thou can<U+017F>t make
a very quaint allu<U+017F>ion thereon; <U+017F>aying <U+017F>he is called <hi>Jacquelina,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he is as
'twere a <hi>Javelin,</hi> wherewith love <U+017F>trikes hearts through. Be<U+017F>ides, when thy Hi<U+017F>tory
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43725:96"/>
<U+017F>hall be written, it will be a hand<U+017F>om title for it, <hi>The Loves of Carmelin and Jaque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina.</hi>
There is a <U+017F>ympathie between the two names, as there is a conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your two hearts; and when I have any lei<U+017F>ure, I promi<U+017F>e thee to find out
<U+017F>ome fortunate <hi>Anagram upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he <U+017F>aid this, he heard <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> propo<U+017F>ing to <hi>Clarimond</hi> a vi<U+017F>it in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
to <hi>Leonora.</hi> Take heart! all goes with us, <U+017F>ays he to <hi>Carmelin:</hi> Here thou
ha<U+017F>t an occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>ee thy new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; but thou mu<U+017F>t not go thither unprepared:
thou <U+017F>peak'<U+017F>t a many good things, but they are not always to the purpo<U+017F>e, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
thou do<U+017F>t not pronounce well. I will teach thee the method of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and
the graces of ge<U+017F>ture and pronunciation.</p>
            <p>This was <U+017F>poken very <U+017F>oftly; and immediately after our two Shepherds went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a little chamber on one <U+017F>ide of the hall, where <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being <U+017F>eated in a chair, and
<hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>tanding before him, he gave him his fir<U+017F>t le<U+017F><U+017F>on. Seeing it is of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence
in Love to have a plea<U+017F>ing way of acce<U+017F>s, and that the countenance hath
<U+017F>ometimes more charms then the words, thou mu<U+017F>t be very carefull and ob<U+017F>ervant
of thine, when thou art before thy <hi>Shepherde<U+017F>s.</hi> If thou ha<U+017F>t a clean handkerchiff
about thee, 'tis my advice thou have it always in thy hand; tho<U+017F>e that <hi>declaim</hi> ever
have one, nay the very <hi>Players</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> are not without one on the Stage. Now
the<U+017F>e are they thou mu<U+017F>t imitate; for if they do not things as they are done, they
do them at lea<U+017F>t as they <U+017F>hould be. Nor were it ami<U+017F>s to have a little neat Beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bru<U+017F>h
to turn up the Mu<U+017F>chato now and then: But above all, a man never ought to
be without a Comb in his pocket, I mean the<U+017F>e Horn-combs that your pre<U+017F>ent Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
carry about them to comb out their hair. You de<U+017F>ire (it <U+017F>eems) I <U+017F>hould never
have my head without horns, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin.</hi> Take it not in that <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
it may happen to thee: I have one of tho<U+017F>e Combs at <hi>Montenor's;</hi> and I tell tho<U+017F>e
that <U+017F>ee me make u<U+017F>e of it, that it is made of the <hi>horns</hi> of tho<U+017F>e I have made <hi>cuckolds,</hi>
and thus the je<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t be retorted back. This I grant you, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> but to
what purpo<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t I ever have a handkerchiff in my hand? I may be taken for
<U+017F>ome Snottypack; and the Bru<U+017F>h in like manner would denote the foulne<U+017F>s of my
Beard, <U+017F>ince it required <U+017F>o frequent bru<U+017F>hing. If thou wilt not ob<U+017F>erve the<U+017F>e nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
be <U+017F>ure thou ha<U+017F>t excellent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, and u<U+017F>e the mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>inuating forms of
<U+017F>peaking, and the mo<U+017F>t approved by the Gallants. As for example, if thou would<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ay, that thou come<U+017F>t out of the company of men that were in a good humour, thou
mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay, I have left the conver<U+017F>ation of <U+017F>ome <hi>faces of good humours.</hi> Men do not
<U+017F>peak only to faces, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> but to perfect men. It matters not, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
that's the manner of <U+017F>peaking, if a man will go according to the mode: And 'tis
<U+017F>aid every foot, How long is't <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>aw that <hi>face?</hi> That <hi>face</hi> would have quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel'd
with me: 'Tis a very proper, neat <U+017F>peech. Moreover if <U+017F>ome would carry thee
to a place whither thou would<U+017F>t not go, thou mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay, <hi>I am your humble <U+017F>ervant
as to that hou<U+017F>e: I am an humble <U+017F>ervant to that vi<U+017F>it,</hi> that is to <U+017F>ay, I am not for it.
And if they <U+017F>hould tell thee it were to hear good mu<U+017F>ick, thou mu<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer, <hi>I ki<U+017F>s
your hands as to mu<U+017F>ick</hi> this day. If it be ask'd whether thou play'<U+017F>t well on the Lute,
<hi>I break not my head with Crotchets, nor prick my <U+017F>elf to play on that In<U+017F>trument.</hi>
I <U+017F>hould willingly <U+017F>peak in that manner, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> yet I apprehend not what it
<U+017F>ignifies; For mu<U+017F>t a man <hi>prick</hi> him<U+017F>elf in the breech with a pin or an awl, to <U+017F>tir
him up to play on the Lute? And as for your <hi>Ki<U+017F>s your hands,</hi> and <hi>Your humble <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
may they be <U+017F>aid to a <hi>Hou<U+017F>e,</hi> or to <hi>Mu<U+017F>ick,</hi> which have no hands, and care
not for our <U+017F>ervices? All this is <U+017F>poken, and is very elegant, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> you hear
nothing el<U+017F>e in the <hi>Louure,</hi> and in all other Courtly places. If thou ha<U+017F>t overreach'd
any one, or put a hand<U+017F>om gull upon him, thou mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay, <hi>I have plaid him an excellent
piece;</hi> for that's now all the phra<U+017F>e. The <hi>pieces</hi> you will have me <hi>play,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
<U+017F>hall they be <hi>Tragicomedies</hi> or <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals,</hi> or <U+017F>hall they be <U+017F>ome <hi>Pieces</hi> to be plaid on
the Lute? That were not ami<U+017F>s, if thou could<U+017F>t do it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Yet I take not
the<U+017F>e things in that <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, I mean the playing of <U+017F>ome <hi>fourbe</hi> or over-reaching trick
in a company; and there's as much <U+017F>ubtilty required to do that, as to play a piece
on the Stage. But to return to our Phra<U+017F>es, there are yet others as exqui<U+017F>ite and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43725:97"/>
curious as the<U+017F>e; but I <U+017F>hall teach thee no more at pre<U+017F>ent, then that thou mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay
at every word, that thy Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s is a <hi>ravi<U+017F>hing</hi> treature. That's very proper to be
<U+017F>aid of <hi>Synopa,</hi> replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> <U+017F>he takes whatever's in her way, <U+017F>he hath ravi<U+017F>h'd
away my old Hat; <U+017F>he is as ravi<U+017F>hing as a Bird of prey, or a Wolf. 'Tis not to be
taken in that <hi>bias,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> When a <hi>Beauty</hi> is <U+017F>aid to be <hi>ravi<U+017F>hing,</hi> the meaning
is, that it is full of charms, allurements, and attractions; and if thou plea<U+017F>e, thou
may<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay that thy Shepherde<U+017F>s hath a <hi>ravi<U+017F>hing</hi> countenance. Thou may<U+017F>t make
thy advantage of the<U+017F>e <hi>French</hi> phra<U+017F>es, according as occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>hall require; and
thou art to repre<U+017F>ent to thy <U+017F>elf, that there is not in <hi>Paris</hi> any de<U+017F>picable Fellow that
pretends to the qualities of a Gentleman, no nor any contemptible Cockney-ba<U+017F>tard,
but hath them, when he is to put his be<U+017F>t <U+017F>ide outward. 'Tis not to be wondred at
that I <U+017F>hould know all this; for though I was ever very <U+017F>tudious, yet at certain
times I kept good company, and this was the manner of <U+017F>peaking among the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantillo's;</hi> if thou wilt have the reputation of a Carpet-Knight, thou mu<U+017F>t imitate
tho<U+017F>e words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin,</hi> without any further conte<U+017F>tation, fell to ruminate on his in<U+017F>tructions;
and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having gotten pen and ink, thought fit to give him <U+017F>ome amorous di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
in writing, be<U+017F>ides this language <hi>a-la-mode</hi> wherewith he entertain'd him, which
was only for familiar di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es. He therefore dre<U+017F>s'd him a fine Complement; and
having given it him, bid him learn it by heart. I <U+017F>hall have it pre<U+017F>ently, replies he
after he had <U+017F>een it, for I have read it in <U+017F>ome book heretofore. It's never the wor<U+017F>e
for that, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is: Novices</hi> in <hi>Love,</hi> as thou art, mu<U+017F>t follow the Books in all
things. Let's <U+017F>ee if thou ha<U+017F>t a good memory. There are but three periods; tell me
the fir<U+017F>t, and imagine thou wert <U+017F>peaking to thy Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. Whereupon <hi>Carmelin</hi>
without any previous ceremony began thus. <hi>Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e! <U+017F>ince a fortunate
lot hath brought me hither, and that your eyes give me no wound but <U+017F>uch as are dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
to me, I mu<U+017F>t needs avow it to you, that I am <U+017F>urpris'd by tho<U+017F>e attractions,
which, notwith<U+017F>tanding all re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, I <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>ure to <U+017F>uffer under.</hi> 'Tis very well, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> thou ha<U+017F>t not mi<U+017F>t a <U+017F>yllable; but yet I ob<U+017F>erved thou had<U+017F>t a corner of thy
eye in the paper; be<U+017F>ides there is <U+017F>omwhat in it more then <U+017F>peaking, the action is all
in all: In the fir<U+017F>t place put off thy hat, then make a conge <hi>a-la-mode,</hi> carry thy
eyes langui<U+017F>hingly; and moving thy right hand as it were in mea<U+017F>ure, put the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger
to the thumb, as the <hi>Orators</hi> do in their <hi>declamations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <U+017F>o <U+017F>aying <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>hewed him all tho<U+017F>e ge<U+017F>tures, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> imitated them the
be<U+017F>t he could: But his ma<U+017F>ter told him he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak at the <U+017F>ame time; <U+017F>o that he
began anew thus. <hi>Fair Shepherde<U+017F>s! <U+017F>ince an unfortunate</hi> Sot <hi>hath brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that your eyes give me no wounds but <U+017F>uch as are</hi> dete<U+017F>table <hi>to me, I mu<U+017F>t
vow to you that I am <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed with your</hi> detractions, <hi>that in <U+017F>pight of all</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance
<hi>I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffer under them.</hi> I know not how <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had the patience to hear out his
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e without beating him. At la<U+017F>t he cries out, Great a<U+017F>s! what an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
ha<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>poken? thou ha<U+017F>t made more faults then thou ha<U+017F>t pronounced
words: 'Twould make good <U+017F>port to hear thee <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o to thy Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. What will you
have me do, Ma<U+017F>ter? replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> The fear of mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing cau<U+017F>es me to make <U+017F>o many
faults; and I <U+017F>o much <U+017F>tudy the grace of the ge<U+017F>ture, that I forget the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e:
the likene<U+017F>s of the words makes me take one for another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> bid him <U+017F>tudy it longer, and he afterwards repeated it again: He was not
much out as to the words; but for countenance, he ob<U+017F>erv'd none at all; and was
all the time in <U+017F>uch an unhand<U+017F>om po<U+017F>ture, that his Ma<U+017F>ter chid him <U+017F>till. There's the
misfortune, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> when I think on the <hi>words,</hi> I forget the <hi>grace:</hi> But let's
begin again; I'll repeat it <U+017F>o often, that I will not mi<U+017F>s any thing. So he began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
but he was much out in the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and there was <U+017F>till <U+017F>omwhat ami<U+017F>s in
him: For when he <U+017F>tudied the action, he forgot the words; and when he <U+017F>tudied
the words, he forgot the action. So that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing his labour lo<U+017F>t, bid him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
him of a Complement to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s according to his own fancie, <U+017F>eeing it was
but time lo<U+017F>t to <U+017F>hew him any thing. <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> who was in the hall, had overheard
part of the Dialogue at the chamber-door, which he thought very plea<U+017F>ant, at
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43725:97"/>
length he enters the room, as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was <U+017F>aying to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that he wonder'd how
he could remember the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es he knew on <U+017F>everal <U+017F>ubjects, <U+017F>eeing it was <U+017F>uch a
task to him to overcome <U+017F>even or eight common words. What I have hath co<U+017F>t me
much pains, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> and not to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble with you, I tell you it hath been
beaten into my head as 'twere with mallets: I mu<U+017F>t have a moneth to learn a line;
but in recompence, when it is once in my head, 'tis as <U+017F>ure as the <U+017F>curf that's in<U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
from it. No, no, thou art an ignorant Fellow, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I have been much
deceiv'd in thee. Pardon him for this time, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> he'll learn better another:
There are <U+017F>ome dayes that our memories are a<U+017F>leep, and that our mind executes not
its functions freely. I <U+017F>hall take it <U+017F>o for your <U+017F>ake, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> perhaps the
vexations he hath gone through, have offu<U+017F>cated his under<U+017F>tanding. We mu<U+017F>t hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
conceive he will be another man then what he hath been; for to be in <hi>love,</hi>
is an advantagious means to become <hi>learned.</hi> I have read in a certain book, that
Love is <hi>Ma<U+017F>ter</hi> of all <hi>Arts;</hi> and I know by experience that it purifies the mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly.
'Tis very true, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but if you de<U+017F>ire the reputation of <hi>learned,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bring an authority without quoting it. I am content, <U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> who as he
had a very good memory, recited a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to that purpo<U+017F>e which he had taken
out of a late book, wherein there was <U+017F>o much naturalne<U+017F>s, that all were infinitely
pleas'd with it.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, <hi>Clarimond</hi> comes in and tels them that they mu<U+017F>t make ha<U+017F>te
to dine. There was brought from <hi>Montenor's</hi> abundance of Poultry and Fowl; <U+017F>o
that <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whom they di<U+017F>pos'd at the Ma<U+017F>ters table, thought he <U+017F>aw the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of tho<U+017F>e delights which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had promis'd him. After dinner he was taken
into the coach with the re<U+017F>t, whereat he was al<U+017F>o infinitely plea<U+017F>ed, for he had never
been <U+017F>o honourably wa<U+017F>ted in his life. Being come to <hi>Orontes's,</hi> the Gentlemen
ki<U+017F>s'd the Ladies, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> did the <U+017F>ame, but he dur<U+017F>t not ki<U+017F>s <hi>Charite,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the
re<U+017F>t had not ki<U+017F>s'd her, and that in this ca<U+017F>e he would not go beyond their example.
It was not their cu<U+017F>tom to ki<U+017F>s Chambermrids, and the Shepherd much wonder'd at
it: But if they had done it, and that he had done the like, the favour he <U+017F>hould have
obtained would have been accompanied with a regret to <U+017F>ee others receive the like.
While he was thus taken up, <hi>Hircan</hi> related his metamorpho<U+017F>is, and how he had
re<U+017F>tor'd him to his former <U+017F>hape. That gave <hi>Angelica</hi> occa<U+017F>ion to put a many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tions
to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and among others, <U+017F>he ask'd him whether the Trees led a plea<U+017F>ant
life, or no. For my part, an<U+017F>wers he, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you I was not weary of it; nor fear'd
I any thing but le<U+017F>t <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>hould cut down <U+017F>ome of my boughs to make Chairs
of, for he hath <U+017F>ometimes been a Joyner: And accordingly I <U+017F>hould have given him
notice, that if there were an extreme nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to take away <U+017F>ome bough from
me, it might not be employed otherwi<U+017F>e then to make my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s a Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had related in what manner he had entertained this <hi>Carmelin</hi>
into his <U+017F>ervice, and how that he hoped to make him as hone<U+017F>t a Shepherd as any in
<hi>France,</hi> he bid him draw neer; and <hi>Orontes</hi> having view'd him well, <U+017F>wore he knew
that face, that he had <U+017F>een it <U+017F>omwhere, and that he thought it might be at <hi>Troyes.</hi>
It may be you take him for <hi>Paris</hi> who was the Judge of the three Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and
think he is a <hi>Trojan,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but he is not, he told me he was of <hi>Lyons,</hi> which
was <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on that I made him my companion; believing that <hi>Lyons</hi> being neer
<hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> there might come good Shepherds thence. I do not mean great <hi>Troy,</hi>
replies <hi>Orontes,</hi> I <U+017F>peak of <hi>Troy</hi> in <hi>Champaigne:</hi> And <U+017F>eeing we are <U+017F>o far engag'd
in the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I'll tell you what I know of him. Being about a year <U+017F>ince in that
City, I went to a Stationers to enquire for a certain book I wanted: While I was
<U+017F>peaking with him in the <U+017F>hop, I heard a voyce from an upper-chamber, that <U+017F>aid,
Ma<U+017F>ter, I am come to the moneth of <hi>Augu<U+017F>t,</hi> what <U+017F>hall I put down? <hi>Warm rains,</hi>
an<U+017F>wers the Stationer. I thereupon look'd up, and through a little trap-door per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<U+017F>omwhat of a man: I thought I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>een the Gods talking from their
<U+017F>everal heavens; as if <hi>Mars</hi> ask'd the <hi>Sun</hi> what weather it <U+017F>hould be, and how he
<U+017F>hould direct his cour<U+017F>e. I went up to <U+017F>ee who it was that had <U+017F>poken, and it was
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43725:98"/>
this brave <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who help'd the Stationer to make an <hi>Almanack:</hi> I leave it to
be con<U+017F>idered if it mu<U+017F>t not be well done, <U+017F>ince it was their invention, and that the
predictions came out their brains. I do not deny that I have liv'd with that Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
not knowing what to do, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> but you are to take notice that he
hath rais'd him a good fortune by his Almanacks, and therefore he is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided.
When he married, he was <U+017F>o poor, that the Prie<U+017F>t being come to be<U+017F>tow a
benediction on his bed, found none in the chamber. Father! <U+017F>ays the woman, ca<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ome Holy-water in this corner, we <U+017F>hall have anon a bundle of <U+017F>traw. But <U+017F>ince
that time they have done very well; and had it not been my de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that made me leave them, I might haply have advanc'd my <U+017F>elf as well as they.
'Tis true, I have heard <U+017F>ay that now they are fallen into the <U+017F>ame po<U+017F>ture again; yet
I am a<U+017F><U+017F>ured they make a <U+017F>hift to keep hou<U+017F>e together, but that they <U+017F>ell away by
peeces what's left. It <U+017F>eems we <U+017F>hall find it at la<U+017F>t the high-way to the Ho<U+017F>pital, to

now met with a better Ma<U+017F>ter; and I believe, <U+017F>ince he knows you to be expert in
making <hi>Almanacks,</hi> he will employ you to calculate his Nativity. Believe it not, fair
Lady! replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I am not born either under the Signs of <hi>Cancer</hi> or <hi>Capricorn;</hi>
I am born under that of <hi>Charite's</hi> Eyes, who<U+017F>e <hi>influences</hi> I know better then any
<hi>A<U+017F>trologer:</hi> Tho<U+017F>e two bright Stars which are po<U+017F>ited in the Heaven of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
are a new <hi>Gemini,</hi> better then that in the Zodiake, and was never yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
by the Speculators of the Second cau<U+017F>es. How can you be born under the
Sign of <hi>Charite's</hi> Eyes, replies <hi>Florida,</hi> <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is younger then you? That's your
mi<U+017F>take, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> As <hi>Charite</hi> is immortal, and <U+017F>hall never know end, <U+017F>o never
had <U+017F>he beginning; and thought it be but nineteen or twenty years that <U+017F>he hath
been on earth, yet <U+017F>he was before in the heavens. I am very <U+017F>orry <U+017F>uch a fair Lady
as you are, <U+017F>hould be ignorant of any thing <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould know.</p>
            <p>While he was taken up in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Hircan</hi> had done relating to the re<U+017F>t
what had happened between the <hi>Shepherd</hi> and the <hi>rural Deities,</hi> repeating the very
<U+017F>tories they had told him word for word. So that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> turning towards him, <U+017F>ays,
And who, prethee, hath told thee all the<U+017F>e particulars? But 'tis true, thou art a
<hi>Magician,</hi> and there is nothing in the world hidden from thee. But 'tis to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e,
replies <hi>Angelica,</hi> we believe nothing of all he <U+017F>ays: Who could believe there
were any Nymphs of the woods &amp; waters? I have often been in the fields, and have
<U+017F>ometimes been in the water, but could never meet with either of them. What, will
you al<U+017F>o declare your want of learning! <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Know then that the Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not to mortals becau<U+017F>e of their <U+017F>ins; and that it is not now as it was in the fir<U+017F>t
Age, wherein Innocencie reign'd, and that they appeared openly, and in a manner
liv'd and conver<U+017F>ed with us. But for the good of mankind, <hi>I</hi> have an incomparable
de<U+017F>ign for to recover the lo<U+017F>t felicity. Hearken therefore all you that are pre<U+017F>ent,
and <hi>I</hi> would to god <hi>I</hi> might be heard to the four quarters of the earth what <hi>I</hi> am
going to tell you! And that is, that <hi>I</hi> have undertaken to reduce the <hi>Golden Age.</hi>
There are a many who would advi<U+017F>e the King in <U+017F>ome things that might be for the
peace of the people, but there is no advice neer mine: Seeing <hi>Charite</hi> is come to
live in <hi>Brie,</hi> there by my means <U+017F>hall the cele<U+017F>tial benediction be fir<U+017F>t poured out:
All <U+017F>hall live after my example; and the Gods ob<U+017F>erving the purity of our <U+017F>ouls,
<U+017F>hall bani<U+017F>h hence all tho<U+017F>e evils that <hi>Pandora</hi> hath <U+017F>own here: it <U+017F>hall be always
<hi>fair weather;</hi> we <U+017F>hall have the <hi>fruits</hi> of the Earth, without manuring it; all <hi>Rocks</hi>
<U+017F>hall be full of <hi>Pearls</hi> and <hi>precious <U+017F>tones;</hi> there <U+017F>hall be no place <U+017F>o <hi>de<U+017F>art,</hi> where
there <U+017F>hall not be <U+017F>ets of <hi>Thyme</hi> and <hi>Marjerom; Brooks</hi> of <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>milk</hi> <U+017F>hall run

            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was heard with great <U+017F>ilence; only <hi>Clarimond</hi> at the end
broke out into a laughter. What do you laugh at? <U+017F>ays the <hi>Shepherd</hi> to him. What
<U+017F>hould <hi>I</hi> laugh at, but your <U+017F>elf? replies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> You, and the re<U+017F>t of your
profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, the <hi>Poets,</hi> are all Fools with your <hi>Golden Age:</hi> Granting it were not a
Fable, you <U+017F>peak <U+017F>uch things of it, as, if they were true, would not make it <U+017F>o delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43725:98"/>
as that wherein we live. Is not the year more plea<U+017F>ant having four <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons, then
if it had but one, as the Spring or Autumn? And if there were none but precious
<U+017F>tones, would not that be a great inconvenience? As for your brooks of milk and
wine, they are <U+017F>ufficiently ridiculous; for whence <U+017F>hould they take their Springs? mu<U+017F>t
we milk all the kine in the Country, and let out all the tuns of wine in one place, that
<U+017F>o we might have rivers? and would you have no water at all? Are there not many
things wherein it is u<U+017F>eful? <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ee no rea<U+017F>on but you may as well promi<U+017F>e us <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
of <hi>fre<U+017F>h butter,</hi> and <hi>green chee<U+017F>e; Rocks</hi> of <hi>Sugar-candy:</hi> that we might catch
<hi>Larks</hi> ready <hi>roa<U+017F>ted;</hi> that there <U+017F>hould be places where it <U+017F>hould rain <hi>Sweet-meats</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> had lo<U+017F>t <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s favor by this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, had he not in the beginning
call'd him a <hi>Poet,</hi> whereat he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>atisfied, that he thought not on the re<U+017F>t. He
was <U+017F>o well pleas'd to be ranked among tho<U+017F>e honorable per<U+017F>ons, that he bit his
lips again, and his skin grew almo<U+017F>t too narrow to contain him. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> <U+017F>pake to
<hi>Clarimond</hi> for him, and <U+017F>hew'd him his error in blaming the delicacies of an age
that all men regretted. Thereupon turning to the Shepherd, he askes him, by what
means he thought to accompli<U+017F>h his noble de<U+017F>igns? What have <hi>I</hi> el<U+017F>e to do but to
per<U+017F>wade all my friends to become <hi>Shepherds,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> am, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is?</hi> 'Tis true, you
and <hi>Montenor</hi> have already denied me; and as for <hi>Clarimond,</hi> he <U+017F>eems not to be
much enclined to it. However, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall not want companions, there are at pre<U+017F>ent
a many good wits in <hi>France.</hi> I'll furni<U+017F>h you with an excellent invention, <U+017F>aies <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
you mu<U+017F>t addre<U+017F>s your <U+017F>elf to the <hi>Poets,</hi> and makers of <hi>Romances,</hi> who are
now in <hi>Paris:</hi> They are tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>peak of <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and are oblig'd to be <U+017F>uch,
thereby to effectuate the rare things, wherewith they have filled their books, or el<U+017F>e
we mu<U+017F>t take them for fools and madmen. That <hi>I</hi> was thinking on, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is, I</hi>
cannot finde any people fitter for my purpo<U+017F>e. And the more ea<U+017F>iely to draw them
in, <hi>I</hi> promi<U+017F>e them all their fir<U+017F>t Shepherds cloathes.</p>
            <p>That's the way indeed to oblige them, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> for they would not only
turn Shepherds, but Turks if need were for a <U+017F>uit of cloathes. They have ever been
a <U+017F>ort of wretches; and to begin with their Prince <hi>Orpheus,</hi> he was <U+017F>o beggarly, that
the very day of his wedding he had not wherewithal to give his wife a pair of <U+017F>hoes;
<U+017F>o that as <U+017F>he danc'd barefoot in a meadow, a Serpent <U+017F>tung her in the heel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<U+017F>he dyed. There was never any <U+017F>ince that made ver<U+017F>es, but hath been poor, or
had a de<U+017F>ire to be <U+017F>o. I know means to inrich all tho<U+017F>e that are of that noble quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I <U+017F>hall require nothing of them but their obedience. Now as <U+017F>oon
as they <U+017F>hall come to me, I <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ently propo<U+017F>e unto them the In<U+017F>titutions of an
<hi>Amorous</hi> and <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral Republique:</hi> I will found an <hi>Vniver<U+017F>ity,</hi> whereof they <U+017F>hall
be the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors.</hi> The mo<U+017F>t able man among them <U+017F>hall be the <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi>
and there <U+017F>hall be nothing read to the Students, but <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Romances.</hi>
They <U+017F>hall learn <hi>Ovids Epi<U+017F>tles, Diana, A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and they <U+017F>hall do <hi>exerci<U+017F>es,</hi> and take
<hi>degrees</hi> in <hi>love,</hi> in<U+017F>tead of doing it in the <hi>Law,</hi> as at <hi>Orleance.</hi> Yong men and maids
<U+017F>hall go pell mell to this School, and there <U+017F>hall thenceforth be bani<U+017F>h'd from among
us all ignorance and incivility. Upon this, <hi>Carmelin</hi> comes and <U+017F>aies to him, Ma<U+017F>ter,
give me leave to tell you, that for to get the more Scholars, it were not ami<U+017F>s to
put up Bills all about <hi>Paris.</hi> He that hath taught me <U+017F>o much learning, us'd this <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
&amp; was <U+017F>o afraid I <U+017F>hould pa<U+017F>s by <U+017F>ome place when I po<U+017F>ted them, that he vi<U+017F>ited
the <U+017F>treets ends, to <U+017F>ee if they were be<U+017F>tow'd in eminent places. Sometimes he <U+017F>tood
by to watch them, and if there came a mi<U+017F>chievous Lacquay by, that had an itch to
tear them off, he would be <U+017F>ure to get a good rap over the pate for his pains. One
time, without heeding much what I did, I pa<U+017F>ted up one the clean contrary way, <U+017F>o
that a man that would have read it, mu<U+017F>t have gone and looked out at the Chamber
window that was above: That angred him <U+017F>o, that he never wi<U+017F>hed me well <U+017F>ince.
All men are equally de<U+017F>irous to propagate their fame, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure thee,
that I have heard <U+017F>ay, that one of our mo<U+017F>t <hi>Famous Authors,</hi> who is <U+017F>o rich that he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43725:99"/>
needs not go a foot, was in the <U+017F>ame manner well pleas'd to <U+017F>ee his name at every
corner, and rode on hor<U+017F>e-back up and down <hi>Paris</hi> to <U+017F>ee it on the day he had a
Book to come out. Thou under<U+017F>tande<U+017F>t this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s very well, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and I
will follow thy advice, but not altogether as thou conceive<U+017F>t: for it is no mercenary
expectation makes me do any thing. Since the City of <hi>Paris</hi> is a place, where there
are a many people of quality and hone<U+017F>ty, and that <hi>I</hi> am not generally known of
all, <hi>I</hi> will <U+017F>end thither to have <U+017F>ome Bills printed, and pa<U+017F>ted up and down, which
<U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak <U+017F>omewhat to this purpo<U+017F>e:</p>

                        <p>THis is to acquaint all whom it concerns, That in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

teaches the <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Shepherdry,</hi> without
demanding any money or other recompence: And that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons,
of what condition <U+017F>oever they be, <U+017F>hall be entertained by
him at the fore<U+017F>aid place; and to <U+017F>hew the perfection of his
Knowledge, he will teach them how to live without any <hi>care</hi>
or <hi>pains,</hi> reducing among them the <hi>Golden-age.</hi>
                        </p>

            <p>O how hand<U+017F>om will this appear under that of the Players, they being both to the
<U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> There cannot many e<U+017F>cape the baits of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>es,
and you will have more Di<U+017F>ciples them ever <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> had. But your mu<U+017F>t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
that the credulous and <U+017F>imple people take you not for a <hi>Mountebank,</hi> like
the <hi>Jew</hi> who was burnt a while <U+017F>ince, that in his publike Bills promis'd his Schollers
Golden Mountains, but at his lodging entertain'd them with nothing but vain and
pernicious Lectures. Or I <U+017F>hould rather fear, that your Bills would be thought like
tho<U+017F>e of the Fryers of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ecroix,</hi> who <U+017F>poke <hi>all</hi> Languages, and deliver'd men from
<hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> As for tho<U+017F>e <hi>Doctors,</hi> 'tis well remembred, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> being
informed that they never fail'd to come to tho<U+017F>e who would <U+017F>peak with them, I have
gone out purpo<U+017F>ely divers times for to meet with them, and have expected them
every where. If I heard <U+017F>ome uncertain noi<U+017F>e, I thought it was one of them; and
though I <U+017F>aw no body, yet <hi>I</hi> went on <U+017F>till in my interrogations; becau<U+017F>e it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that they became invi<U+017F>ible. You are not alone deceiv'd in this ca<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Orontes,</hi> but <hi>I</hi>'ll tell you a thing, which <hi>I</hi> wi<U+017F>h all <hi>France</hi> knew for its deliverance
from the<U+017F>e fal<U+017F>e opinions. Being once engag'd in a debauch at <hi>Paris,</hi> with <U+017F>even or
eight of my friends, one of them, to finde the world talk, went and writ the Placard
of the Fryers of the <hi>Ro<U+017F>ecroix,</hi> who have made <U+017F>o much noi<U+017F>e in the world, and
po<U+017F>ted it up at the corner of a <U+017F>treet in the dark. Judge now whether this folly was
not a worthy employment for <U+017F>o many famous writers. A great piece of news in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but if it be granted that the Fraternity of our learned <hi>Invi<U+017F>ibles</hi>
be but an imaginary thing, <hi>I</hi> cannot choo<U+017F>e but be <U+017F>orry for it; for what rare things
might a man do if he were of their <U+017F>ect. A man might vi<U+017F>it his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s in <U+017F>pight
of Friends and Rivals. Trouble not your <U+017F>elf for that, replies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> The
Poets whom you endeavour to imitate, promi<U+017F>e as <U+017F>trange things as tho<U+017F>e unknown
Philo<U+017F>ophers. They <U+017F>peak altogether by miracles and Metamorpho<U+017F>es. You would
do me a favour to bring them hither, for <hi>I</hi> have <U+017F>ome things of no <U+017F>mall con<U+017F>equence
to tell them. Alas! what quarrel have you with them? <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> know you not,
replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that before a man enters into a <U+017F>ect or profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Religion, he
confers with the <hi>Philo<U+017F>ophers</hi> or the <hi>Mini<U+017F>ters?</hi> in like manner, before <hi>I</hi> turn
<hi>Shepherd,</hi> I would <U+017F>peak with tho<U+017F>e Soveraign Ma<U+017F>ters of this Art, that <hi>I</hi> might be
convinc'd as to certain <U+017F>cruples which trouble my minde. But perhaps you'll tell me
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43725:99"/>
you are as able as they to <U+017F>olve all arguments; but you are not, you are but their
di<U+017F>ciple, and I cannot be <U+017F>atisfied with what you might alledge. Tell me at lea<U+017F>t in
few words, what you could object again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e excellent ingenuities, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi>
I <U+017F>hall freely do't, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> And to begin with the ancient Poets, I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
as I have done before, that all their Fables are full of mo<U+017F>t ridiculous ab<U+017F>urdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
they have invented a thou<U+017F>and fopperies, according to the cu<U+017F>toms of the Ages
they lived in. If their times had been like ours, and had had the advantages of <U+017F>o
many inventions as we have, and that their Works were now to be compos'd, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
in <U+017F>tead of playing on the <hi>Harp,</hi> <U+017F>hould play on the <hi>Lute;</hi> and in <U+017F>tead of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Serpent <hi>Python</hi> with <hi>arrows,</hi> he <U+017F>hould have done it with a <hi>musket. Cupid,</hi>
in <U+017F>tead of his equipage of a <hi>bow</hi> and <hi>quiver,</hi> <U+017F>hould be accommodated with a Ca<U+017F>e
of Pi<U+017F>tols. Were I to have my mind, in <U+017F>tead of a <hi>torch</hi> he <U+017F>hould have a <hi>Fools bable</hi>
in his hand, for all his <hi>heat</hi> is but a fooli<U+017F>h imagination. As for the <hi>Sun,</hi> in <U+017F>tead of
riding in a <hi>chariot,</hi> he <U+017F>hould ride in a <hi>coach,</hi> or haply he <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>pos'd into a
<hi>wheelbarrow:</hi> But the imagination were yet more excellent, if it were <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed
that that Luminous globe which lights us, were one of the wheels of it. As for <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi>
who is very <U+017F>low of motion, he <U+017F>hould be carried in a <hi>Sedan,</hi> like an old man
that were <U+017F>ick of the Gout. In the <U+017F>ame manner <U+017F>hould all the re<U+017F>t of the Gods be
accoutred; and I am troubled with a little itch to reform all their fables, that <U+017F>o
they might be <hi>a la mode,</hi> and that people might under<U+017F>tand <U+017F>omwhat out of them.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>hewed you the folly of the ancient Poets, I am now to <U+017F>peak of that of
our modern ones. They conceit them<U+017F>elves very learned, if they di<U+017F>cover but a touch
or allu<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>ome ancient fable; and in their <hi>Romances</hi> they think they appear
very able men, if they can but bring in the Ceremonies, Sacrifices, and Religion of
the fal<U+017F>e Gods. The relation of the terrors of barbarous Nations, is it not an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ornament to a Book, and have we not great nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to burthen our minds with
the knowledge of them? Why may we not as well have <hi>Romances</hi> of all the fal<U+017F>e Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
of the <hi>Indies?</hi> Yet want there not at this pre<U+017F>ent a many able Wits, that <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them<U+017F>elves to be carried away with the torrent of this incon<U+017F>ideracie; and like
as <U+017F>heep ca<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves down where they have <U+017F>een others to fall before, <U+017F>o they
think them<U+017F>elves excu<U+017F>ed if they erre by <hi>imitation,</hi> never tasking them<U+017F>elves with
any <U+017F>erious inqui<U+017F>ition into things; and cannot write three lines, but they talk as
confidently of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> as if we lived in the time of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides
the<U+017F>e, there are other extravagances in <hi>Romances,</hi> which I <U+017F>hall more particularly
<U+017F>ift out in a Cen<U+017F>ure I intend of them.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi><U+017F>neaking</hi> Poems which we are furni<U+017F>h'd with by tho<U+017F>e who have not
<U+017F>o much <U+017F>trength of <U+017F>pirit as to undertake any thing that requires a longer breath,
and be<U+017F>tow three moneths on a Sonnet, O God! can there be any thing in the world
more unprofitable, or more contemptible? Tho<U+017F>e who make it their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, are
they not much in the right, to think that a flat dull di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e becomes very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
if it can but be put in ver<U+017F>e? And can they imagine that <hi>Rhiming,</hi> which is not
only a vice in our Pro<U+017F>e, but al<U+017F>o even in Latine Ver<U+017F>es, is <U+017F>o much to be e<U+017F>teemed,
that they mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ently de<U+017F>erve Crowns of Laurel for having been a little fortunate
therein? But indeed Rhiming is nought el<U+017F>e but a barbarous ornament of corrupt
and imperfect Languages; and I dur<U+017F>t maintain, it is the greate<U+017F>t argument in the
world of a low and cowardly mind, to <U+017F>pend a whole life in <hi>filing</hi> and <hi>licking</hi> of
<hi>Ver<U+017F>es.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides, the pre<U+017F>ent Authors betray <U+017F>o little capacity, that if by a <U+017F>olemn
Edict it were forbidden them to u<U+017F>e the words <hi>Fate, Chance, Charms, Smiles, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Love,</hi> and <U+017F>ome others, which mu<U+017F>t not fail to <U+017F>erve any where, though there be
no need, unle<U+017F>s it be to make up the mea<U+017F>ure and to rime, I would forfeit my life if
they could ever make Ode or Sonnet. And if ever they betray any <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
'tis but an <hi>Antithe<U+017F>is,</hi> which had been u<U+017F>ed a hundred thou<U+017F>and times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
as it may be <U+017F>omwhat about <hi>Ro<U+017F>es</hi> and <hi>Thorns, Fire</hi> and <hi>Ice, Night</hi> and <hi>Day,</hi> the
<hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars:</hi> Or el<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>ure to period with an <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> It comes not
once into their imagination, that <hi>Poetry</hi> ought to have other ornaments then the<U+017F>e;
for they think it a matter of reputation never to have read any good book, which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43725:100"/>
haply would have made them more capable: And if their invention be delivered of
any thing above common, it is <U+017F>ome rugged imagination which the <hi>Clown</hi> in the Play
would have been a<U+017F>ham'd to have <U+017F>aid, nay, and would blu<U+017F>h at it, were't not that his
face is powdered. And this is part of what I <U+017F>hould repre<U+017F>ent unto them; and when
they <U+017F>hall learn what remains, there will be a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity they <U+017F>hould defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
and convince me of <U+017F>ome opinions, if they de<U+017F>ire I <U+017F>hould enter into their
<hi>Caballe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Clarimond</hi> had here ended his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> told him that tho<U+017F>e
he challeng'd were able enough to an<U+017F>wer him, and that they would do it when they
were come into <hi>Brie</hi> as he expected; but that which he mo<U+017F>t doubted was, that they
were <U+017F>o enchanted with the plea<U+017F>ures of the Court, that they could by no means
leave it. Bani<U+017F>h that belief out of your mind, replies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> 'Tis true indeed
they do haunt <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Courts,</hi> and have not any thing el<U+017F>e to do but as <U+017F>o many
Spies to enquire who is newly in favour with the King, or if any one be upon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that they may make Ver<U+017F>es on tho<U+017F>e occa<U+017F>ions. But when they have given their
diurnal attendance, and made their utmo<U+017F>t advantages of the<U+017F>e opportunities, and
written on all the<U+017F>e fine occa<U+017F>ions, men contemn them as an unprofitable <U+017F>ort of
people. The<U+017F>e brave Sale<U+017F>men of <hi>Prai<U+017F>e</hi> and <hi>Fame,</hi> promi<U+017F>e immortality, di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e
Empires as they plea<U+017F>e; and as they pre<U+017F>ent nothing but <U+017F>moke, <U+017F>o are they paid in
the <U+017F>ame coin. To be <U+017F>hort, you may be <U+017F>ure that after they have haunted <hi>great</hi>
hou<U+017F>es, they mu<U+017F>t take up their lodging in the <hi><U+017F>mall</hi> ones, I mean tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Ho<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi>
Nor indeed is it long <U+017F>ince, upon an occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ecuring all beggers, the Beadles
found in the <U+017F>treet one of this famous tribe, and carried him thither: But there ri<U+017F>e
a great debate, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the <U+017F>illy Wretch <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed among the poor,
or among the mad, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>eemed to be both: At la<U+017F>t a Gentleman that chanced
to be pre<U+017F>ent, deliver'd him, and made him his dome<U+017F>tick Fool. Gentle Shepherd,

quoted to you: I remember your Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Adrian</hi> threatned to lodge you there
when you di<U+017F>obey'd him: I would gladly know how you would look if you were
there; would you take for <hi>Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> all tho<U+017F>e good old wives that are there?
would you entertain them with amorous complements? Go and <U+017F>eek who <U+017F>hould
an<U+017F>wer thee, di<U+017F>courteous friend! <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> thy interrogatories are odious. I pray
excu<U+017F>e the freedom I have taken, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> and go on in your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Poets.</hi> I'll no more of that neither, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> whether they be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
or no, the condition of <hi>Shepherdry</hi> is never the wor<U+017F>e: Good things mu<U+017F>t not
be e<U+017F>teemed ill, for having been ill de<U+017F>cribed.</p>
            <p>This entertainment being ended, every one entred into <U+017F>omwhat more particular,
even to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who had the means and opportunity to <U+017F>et upon <hi>Charite.</hi> He was <U+017F>o
much the more confident to <U+017F>peak to her, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>ometimes look'd on him
<U+017F>milingly? Are you not then the <U+017F>ame cruel one <U+017F>till, who di<U+017F>dain my <U+017F>ervices? <U+017F>ays
he to her: Are you no longer offended with me? My anger u<U+017F>es not to continue
<U+017F>o long, an<U+017F>wers <U+017F>he. Then am I obliged to heaven, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> you have done
what prudence it <U+017F>elf ought to have done: If I have at other times offended you, I
will do it no more henceforward; and I will live with you as mode<U+017F>tly as if I were
to conver<U+017F>e with a Nun, untill <U+017F>uch time as the <U+017F>weet tye of marriage <U+017F>hall open the
gate of my affections. And that is the rea<U+017F>on that I now make my humble <U+017F>uit to
you, that you will be plea<U+017F>ed to impo<U+017F>e what laws you think good on me, and I <U+017F>hall
ob<U+017F>erve them. Con<U+017F>ider, my fair one! what commands do you lay on me? I am
ready to obey you. I have not <U+017F>o great a power over you, <U+017F>ays <hi>Charite;</hi> I only
de<U+017F>ire you not to <U+017F>peak to me but in private, becau<U+017F>e my Ladies Brother in law
hath ever <U+017F>omwhat to <U+017F>ay to me concerning your love. Your intreaties are to me
commands, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> Is there any thing el<U+017F>e you would have me do? There is,
an<U+017F>wers <hi>Charite;</hi> and that is, that you follow all the good coun<U+017F>el I <U+017F>hall give
you, le<U+017F>t we both be laugh'd at. You might have <U+017F>pared that charge, replies

            <p>While the Shepherd was thus employ'd, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had gotten neer <hi>Angelica,</hi> for
to di<U+017F>cover his affection unto her. But he receiv'd not from her the lea<U+017F>t favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
an<U+017F>wer. So that bethinking him <U+017F>he might be <U+017F>till in the opinion that he lov'd
<hi>Geneura,</hi> as <U+017F>he had been inform'd before, he cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Montenor</hi> to advance, who from
one di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to another came to <U+017F>peak of this his fir<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, making it appear
how her Servant had left her, and that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ince married to another. However
<hi>Angelica</hi> per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in her di<U+017F>dains; and when <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> ever fell upon any demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tration
of the greatne<U+017F>s of his affection, <U+017F>he told him, that the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which he
<U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of, was as <hi>extravagant</hi> as that of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> You are too cruel if you
<U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, (<U+017F>ays <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> to her) for I do not think you believe it: You know that your
perfections never could rai<U+017F>e in my <U+017F>oul any thoughts or de<U+017F>ires which were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate;
and as for my actions, they differ much from tho<U+017F>e of our <hi>Shepherd.</hi>
The effects of Love are indeed divers, replies <hi>Angelica,</hi> but the folly of it is ever
alike.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was broke off by the approach of <hi>Florida.</hi> But <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> be<U+017F>etting
him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly to con<U+017F>ider, was much troubled to find out the cau<U+017F>e why his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
treated him more di<U+017F>dainfully then ordinary. He was not of tho<U+017F>e Fools who
marry Wenches before they know whether they entertain them with any affection,
and are ever after upon the thre<U+017F>hold of divorce. He was re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ay nothing
to <hi>Leonora,</hi> till he were a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of her Daughters good will; and it was <U+017F>he that he
would fir<U+017F>t gain, as being the place of mo<U+017F>t importance. He therefore re<U+017F>olved to
make provi<U+017F>ion of Con<U+017F>tancie for to per<U+017F>evere in a <U+017F>uit, whereof he doubted not his
<U+017F>atisfaction if he brought it about.</p>
            <p>The time to depart being come, he went home in the Coach with <hi>Montenor,</hi> and
<hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> were of the company. As for <hi>Hircan,</hi> he rode home to his
own ca<U+017F>tle: And for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he being oblig'd to look after the Flock, which he
had left to the care of <hi>Bertrand's</hi> <U+017F>on, took his way to the Cottage, whither he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd,
and was much di<U+017F>pleas'd that he was fain to go afoot, and alone. When <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
was come to <hi>Montenor's,</hi> he told the company, that the rea<U+017F>on of his coming thither
was to con<U+017F>ult with them, and con<U+017F>ider of the way which he <U+017F>hould take for to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
all the <hi>French</hi> his Countrymen with the plea<U+017F>ures he promis'd them. <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
an<U+017F>wered, There was no more to do but to write down the <hi>Si quis</hi> or Bill he

him to wander the fields for to take his former exerci<U+017F>e; and then it was that being

that I thought I had never <U+017F>een her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was appeas'd, and much taken with this <U+017F>ubtil eva<U+017F>ion. He afterward
asked <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whether he had <U+017F>een the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s he had a de<U+017F>ire to be<U+017F>tow on him.
I did indeed <U+017F>ee a great Swine of a <U+017F>ervant-maid, called <hi>Jacquelina,</hi> but as for a
wench worthy to be my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, I have not <U+017F>een any. Thou art very humourous,
but I'll not oppo<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t it. It's a <U+017F>ign thou beginne<U+017F>t to take courage:
however, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall not any more embark my <U+017F>elf in thy affections. Endeavor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for thy <U+017F>elf, though art old enough. <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ee well where thy <U+017F>hoe pinces. Thou
<U+017F>till grieve<U+017F>t for the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Synopa,</hi> that fair Nymph of the waters. The
Devil make a Gallows of her, if <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>o much as think on her, replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> you
are to know that when <hi>I</hi> was come home la<U+017F>t night, I related to our Land-Lord your
adventures, and my own. He was almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elf, when <hi>I</hi> told him of tho<U+017F>e
dances and banquets in the night with fair Ladies, and men with great beards, that
could not <U+017F>peak. He told me, that without que<U+017F>tion we had been at the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and
that tho<U+017F>e we had <U+017F>een were <U+017F>o many evil <U+017F>pirits: That as for the meat which was
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43725:101"/>
there eaten, it was nothing but wind; as indeed <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s it hath not much
burthened my <U+017F>tomach. When <hi>I</hi> con<U+017F>ider the mi<U+017F>chief they did me, and all the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
po<U+017F>tures of that cur<U+017F>ed crew, <hi>I</hi> am oblig'd to believe they were no other then
the inhabitants of hell. Wherefore if you have any de<U+017F>ire to conver<U+017F>e with them any
further, <hi>I</hi> am advis'd not to <U+017F>erve you any longer. Alas! what blindene<U+017F>s is this?
cryes out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> whither will the in<U+017F>olence of humane <U+017F>pirits reach, when it mi<U+017F>takes
the mo<U+017F>t favourable Deities that may be, for evil <U+017F>pirits? This is far from <U+017F>acrificing
to them. Since thou art in an error <hi>Carmelin, I</hi> will endeavor to deliver thee out
of it. Let's go to the fountain <hi>Lucida,</hi> po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly the Nymph of it will be <U+017F>o courteous
as to appear to us. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> goes forward, and being come near the <U+017F>ource,
he <U+017F>everal times calls <hi>Lucida;</hi> but not <U+017F>eeing her appear, he <U+017F>aid that patience mu<U+017F>t
be had, and that it may be <U+017F>he was gone a walking <U+017F>ome way; or that <U+017F>he would
not <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily to men in the day time. After this he made a light meal
on bread and nuts; and when the Sun was <U+017F>et, he return'd along with <hi>Carmelin</hi> to
his Land-lords. The Good man, who according to what he had been told of him,
thought him a wizard, and was in <U+017F>ome fear to <U+017F>up with him; yet had he the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to ask him, why he who had much money, and <U+017F>eem'd to come of good
friends, troubled him<U+017F>elf with the keeping of <U+017F>heep; <U+017F>ince they were only the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
lads in the Country that put them<U+017F>elves into that imployment. Thy di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e is
as ru<U+017F>tical as thy per<U+017F>on, hone<U+017F>t friend, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> can<U+017F>t thou wonder that I take
the <U+017F>heephook in hand, <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o many Knights have for<U+017F>aken the Lance upon the
<U+017F>ame account; nay, <U+017F>ince there have been Kings that have preferr'd it before their
Scepters, that <U+017F>o they might pur<U+017F>ue their Loves with more Liberty? It's true, this
is not <U+017F>een in this Countrey, but it is <U+017F>o in <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi> and other places: but it will
not be long ere there will be even here a many as illu<U+017F>trious Sheperds as my <U+017F>elf.
However, there is not <U+017F>uch plea<U+017F>ure in keeping of Sheep, reply'd the hone<U+017F>t Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant;
I had rather be at <hi>Paris</hi> in your brave hang'd Chambers, telling of crowns.
Behold what all the Philo<U+017F>ophers have taught us, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> that we are not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
commonly proceeds from our <U+017F>elves, but we have not the capacity to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it. Thou art in the mid<U+017F>t of the plea<U+017F>ures of the Country, which I come from
far to <U+017F>earch out, and thou art not content, for want of knowing how to enjoy them.
Well, well, it <U+017F>hall not be long ere thou be pack'd hence, and other more noble
per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>hall come in thy place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bertrand</hi> dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay no more after <U+017F>o rough a return: he re<U+017F>olved not to make any
further enquiry into the affairs of his gue<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>o that he might <U+017F>till get by them. So
the whole family went to bed: but there being but one bed for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
the Ma<U+017F>ter was not well pleas'd to be <U+017F>o di<U+017F>pos'd with this <U+017F>ervant. 'Twas not that
he di<U+017F>dained him; but becau<U+017F>e he was accu<U+017F>tomed to lie alone, that he might be in
what po<U+017F>ture he pleas'd, and turn from one <U+017F>ide to another in the mid<U+017F>t of his <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
The night before he had had a bed to him<U+017F>elf at <hi>Clarimonds,</hi> and had need
of it, having watch'd three nights together. This al<U+017F>o he was re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>leep with
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> who <U+017F>wore neverthele<U+017F>s the next day, that he never had <U+017F>uch an ill nights
re<U+017F>t, his Ma<U+017F>ter had been <U+017F>o unquiet. They led their flock abroad to graze, a good
di<U+017F>tance that day; and being near a clo<U+017F>e of <hi>Oronte's,</hi> they <U+017F>aw <hi>Charite</hi> coming out
of it all alone, <U+017F>o that they went forward to <U+017F>peak to her.</p>
            <p>This Wench having di<U+017F>cover'd by all the actions of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that he had indeed a
great pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion towards her, could not any longer wi<U+017F>h him ill; con<U+017F>idering al<U+017F>o that
the other maids of the hou<U+017F>e had put it into her head, that whatever folly he might
carry about him, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t needs be very happy if <U+017F>he married him, <U+017F>ince he was
very rich. 'Tis true, <hi>Angelica</hi> knowing <U+017F>he was in that opinion, had maliciou<U+017F>ly
endeavored to put it out of her minde: That <U+017F>he might <U+017F>eem cruel to towards her
<U+017F>ervant, <U+017F>he had taught her certain things to <U+017F>ay to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> when ever he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak
to her, making her believe it were the way, to finde out whether he lov'd her or no.
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having <U+017F>aluted her, and told her that he was come again to <U+017F>ubmit him<U+017F>elf to
her, and to know what commands <U+017F>he had to lay on him be<U+017F>ides what <U+017F>he had told
him at the la<U+017F>t waiting on her. She an<U+017F>wered him <U+017F>omewhat har<U+017F>ly, <hi>I command you
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43725:102"/>
not to obey me any more,</hi> and pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>he return'd the <U+017F>ameway <U+017F>he came, without
any further ceremony; for <U+017F>o her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s had advi<U+017F>ed her to do, who had al<U+017F>o taught
her the fore<U+017F>aid di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was as in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible as a Stock; <U+017F>o that <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>eeing him fixt upright, and
<U+017F>aying nothing, thought he <U+017F>lept <U+017F>tanding, and came and pull'd him by the skirts of
his coat, for to awake him. Let me alone, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to him, why do<U+017F>t thou oblige
we to <U+017F>peak. If I had been a quarter of an hour longer in my tran<U+017F>portation, my
hi<U+017F>tory would have been by <U+017F>o much the more noble, and more admirable. But let
us go hence, <U+017F>ince thou would<U+017F>t have it <U+017F>o. I <U+017F>hall finde my mi<U+017F>ery as well in one
place as in another: Alas! my memory dogs me every where; it will ever repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
to me the cruel words of <hi>Charite, I command you not to obey me any more,</hi> <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he. O God! what cruelty's this! After I had receiv'd <U+017F>o many te<U+017F>timonies of her
good will, in two days <U+017F>he is chang'd, and will not have me obey her any more; which
is as much as to <U+017F>ay in one word<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires not to be any longer my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
nor that I <U+017F>hould be her <U+017F>ervant: Wherein have I offended her? Let her tell me
my offence, and if I am found guilty, I <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire no other to ordain my puni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but a <hi>Bu<U+017F>iris</hi> or a <hi>Phalaris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate Shepherd utter'd many <U+017F>uch complaints as he walk'd along with
<hi>Carmelin;</hi> and when he came to a path that led to <hi>Montenor's,</hi> he would needs go
thither for to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omething to <hi>An<U+017F>elme.</hi> Having by good hap met with him, he
asked him whether he had <U+017F>till in his Box the <hi>Eccho</hi> of St. <hi>Clou,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he now
thought it time to make <U+017F>ome u<U+017F>e of it; and that he had found a cave very fit to be
its abode. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> an<U+017F>wered him, that he had been very careful to pre<U+017F>erve <U+017F>uch
a pretty little Nymphs, and that he thought it a fit time to pre<U+017F>ent him with it.
Upon that he left him, and returning again pre<U+017F>ently, he put into his hands a box,
wherein he a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him the <hi>Eccho</hi> was. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having given him many thanks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
with <U+017F>o much joy, as a little diverted the <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s which he had conceiv'd at the
di<U+017F>dain of <hi>Charite.</hi> But being withal very impatient, before he was come half way
to the place where the little Nymph was to be di<U+017F>pos'd, he was <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee
her, that he opened the Box. As <U+017F>oon as the lid was off, the Sparrow which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elme</hi>
had put into it fled away; <U+017F>o that he <U+017F>oon lo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ight of it. Whither flie<U+017F>t
thou? O mo<U+017F>t precious member of the body of the faire<U+017F>t Nymph that ever was,
<U+017F>ays the de<U+017F>olate Shepherd; my curio<U+017F>ity hath been as impertinent as that of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,
Aglaura</hi> and <hi>P<U+017F>yche.</hi> Why did I not <U+017F>tay till I were come into a le<U+017F>s <U+017F>paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
place then this? O <hi>Eccho, Eccho,</hi> where art thou?</p>
            <p>This he uttered as loud as he could, and yet there was not any Eccho made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer.
At length, being towards the evening come near the place of her abode, he
cry'd out again, and heard an <hi>Eccho,</hi> for indeed there was one there. If this be
not the Eccho I have lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>aies he, it is another as good. It mu<U+017F>t be thought there
may be as excellent ones in <hi>Brie,</hi> as in the <hi>I<U+017F>le of France.</hi> Dear Nymph, continues
he, I have been ill treated by <hi>Charite</hi> this afternoon; will <U+017F>he continue her cruelty.
The <hi>Eccho</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cruelty:</hi> And having ask'd her afterwards <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he
pronounc'd words, whence he could not dra any <U+017F>atisfaction; <U+017F>o that having
pre<U+017F>ently met with <hi>Clarimond,</hi> he made his complaint to him. You are in a
very great error, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond</hi> to him: you are to know, that if the Eccho an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wers
any thing to the purpo<U+017F>e it is by chance; and of a hundred words, there may
not be two wherein there is any <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. And whereas you finde in Books a long train
of an<U+017F>wers that are very good, they have been purpo<U+017F>ely invented, and that with
much difficulty. Be<U+017F>ides, 'tis to no purpo<U+017F>e to con<U+017F>ult that oracle, it is a vain and
ridiculous one. It knows little, <U+017F>ince it <U+017F>aies nothing but what it hath heard us <U+017F>ay,
and all it doth, is to repeat the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>yllables of a period where we <U+017F>top. You are
deceiv'd your <U+017F>elf, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> if I had the Eccho which I have now lo<U+017F>t, it woold
an<U+017F>wer me to any thing I <U+017F>hould ask it. <hi>I</hi> have el<U+017F>ewhere had experience of its
skill. He thereupon related part of what the Eccho had <U+017F>aid to him at St. <hi>Clou.</hi> And
indeed if we remember, though it was <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> that made him immediate an<U+017F>wers,
yet had the replies much <U+017F>en<U+017F>e in them: And if it be wondred how that could be,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43725:102"/>
and it be objected to me, that <hi>Clarimond</hi> thought the good an<U+017F>wers of an Eccho
could not be brought about without pains; I <U+017F>hall be excus'd if I <U+017F>ay, that be<U+017F>ides
that there was much hazard in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> then ended his periods with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
words he had cho<U+017F>en long before, as the be<U+017F>t he could find for to <U+017F>peak in to an
Eccho.</p>
            <p>After he had related that brave adventure, he told him what <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented
him withall, and of his curio<U+017F>ity: which made <hi>Clarimond</hi> wonder at his folly
more then ever. the Shepherd, when he had done that <U+017F>tory, could not but tell him
how the lo<U+017F>s of his Eccho had follow'd that of the favour and affection of <hi>Charite,</hi>
as indeed misfortunes go ever in company. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having learn'd of him the
words which his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s had <U+017F>aid to him, told him pre<U+017F>ently; Shepherd, you have
no rea<U+017F>on to be any ways troubled: If <hi>Charite</hi> hath commanded you not to obey
her any more, why will you obey her in this very command? What <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>aid
to you, <U+017F>ignifies as much as if <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid nothing at all: She will not have you to
obey her, and yet you <U+017F>ee <U+017F>he commands you; <U+017F>he will not lay any further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
on you, and yet <U+017F>he will have you to obey her: What may be concluded
thence, but that you mu<U+017F>t take no notice of this la<U+017F>t command, which you mu<U+017F>t not
obey, and ob<U+017F>erve the former ones which oblige you to obedience? <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had much
ado to comprehend the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: For <hi>Clarimond</hi> under<U+017F>tood it not too
well him<U+017F>elf, and would needs explain one piece of Gibri<U+017F>h by another more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cure.
However I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ays the Shepherd to him, dear friend! that thy
<U+017F>ubtilty is great, and that thy <U+017F>olutions are admirable. Yet my mind is <U+017F>till in di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
and I have <U+017F>ome particular opinions which <U+017F>eem to me as like to be true as
thine. Alas! I <U+017F>hall ever have a memory of tho<U+017F>e cruel words of <hi>Charite: I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you not to obey me any more.</hi> They will cau<U+017F>e no that grief that I <U+017F>hall die of.
<hi>A<U+017F>traea</hi> never <U+017F>pake any thing <U+017F>o har<U+017F>h to <hi>Celadon,</hi> and yet he <U+017F>tick'd not to ca<U+017F>t
him<U+017F>elf into the River. All <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid to him was, that he <U+017F>hould go his wayes, and
never appear before her till he was commanded. This was ea<U+017F>ie to be under<U+017F>tood,
and could not put his mind into <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>quiet. Well, <U+017F>ince you will not believe me,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> the only remedy remains, is, to propo<U+017F>e your difficulty to <U+017F>ome <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians:</hi>
but for my part, I <U+017F>hall ever be of opinion, that we mu<U+017F>t do by this knot as
<hi>Alexander</hi> did with that of <hi>Gordian;</hi> and that you mu<U+017F>t cut it a<U+017F>under; if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
untie it. I can well yet have the patience, till I meet with a convenience for to
ask <hi>Charite</hi> her<U+017F>elf about it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Or in ca<U+017F>e that take not, I mu<U+017F>t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to the Doctors of <hi>Amorous</hi> Philo<U+017F>ophy, which I intend to
<U+017F>et up.</p>
            <p>Upon this re<U+017F>olution <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> took leave of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> for to return to his lodging.
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was already come home, had put up his Flock, and was thinking of
the <hi>Kitchin,</hi> which was very empty and cold. After a <U+017F>ober <U+017F>upper, every one went
to bed: But no <U+017F>leep could fa<U+017F>ten on <U+017F>ad <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> he did nothing all night but repeat
the words of <hi>Charite:</hi> He would tell his man, that they caus'd him an affliction
wor<U+017F>e then death it <U+017F>elf. There is indeed a great matter to be troubled at, an<U+017F>wers
<hi>Carmelin:</hi> Let us not obey her in this, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he will not have us to do it. Alas!
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that's the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on as <hi>Clarimond's:</hi> But I will maintain again<U+017F>t all
the world, that the meaning of <hi>Charite</hi> is, that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ir'd me not to obey her in
any thing <U+017F>he hath heretofore commanded me. What commands were tho<U+017F>e? <U+017F>ays
<hi>Carmelin.</hi> 'Twas, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>peak to her but in private. Nay,
then you have a very <U+017F>hrewd turn done you, continues <hi>Carmelin;</hi> you <U+017F>hall hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
<U+017F>peak to her before all the world. Thou ha<U+017F>t a judgment good enough, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but there is <U+017F>omwhat more then that in it; <U+017F>he al<U+017F>o commanded me to
believe all the admonitions <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould give me; and now that <U+017F>he hath given me an
order not to obey her, there is no que<U+017F>tion but I mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olve not to obey her. All
this comes to what I <U+017F>aid before, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> That's it which I tell you, that <U+017F>ince
<U+017F>he commands you not to obey her, you mu<U+017F>t not do it. Do not obey her in this,
Ma<U+017F>ter: you take things in a contrary <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and you trouble your <U+017F>elf without
cau<U+017F>e; you may ob<U+017F>erve that you contradict your <U+017F>elf in your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43725:103"/>
yet in <U+017F>pight of your teeth you are ever within two fingers breadth of the
truth.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e two Shepherds pa<U+017F>s'd away the night in the<U+017F>e and the like conte<U+017F>tations,
wherein they <U+017F>o di<U+017F>till'd their <U+017F>pirits, that it was a fear they might lo<U+017F>e what little
remain'd. Though <hi>Carmelin</hi> had not <U+017F>tudied <U+017F>o much as his Ma<U+017F>ter, yet might he
now be thought able to teach him what he ought to believe: For pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion having
blinded <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> made him take all things in the wor<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. When it was day, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
carried his Flock abroad, not willing to <U+017F>tarve it, for to make it participate of his
<U+017F>adne<U+017F>s. He met in his way a man in black, riding on a lean Hackney, who in one
hand held the bridle, and in the other a bowl and a gla<U+017F>s-bottle. You'll not be di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd,
Sir, if I ask you who you are, and whence you come, <U+017F>ays the Shepherd to
him, who was <U+017F>omwhat amaz'd to <U+017F>ee him in that po<U+017F>ture. I am an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> at
your <U+017F>ervice, replies the other: I have been admini<U+017F>tring <U+017F>ome phy<U+017F>ick at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
to a <U+017F>ervant-maid call'd <hi>Catherine.</hi> She that you <U+017F>peak of is the Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but that's no great matter, it's but a mi<U+017F>take: Tell me what <U+017F>he
is <U+017F>ick of. 'Tis no great matter <U+017F>he is troubled with, replies the Apochecary; <U+017F>he
had a mind to be purg'd, for to be freed of <U+017F>ome little pains <U+017F>he felt in her members,
as being <U+017F>omwhat rheumatick. I have need to be purg'd too, and that without
delay, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I will go to bed pre<U+017F>ently: Do me the favour to bring
me my phy<U+017F>ick as <U+017F>oon as may be; my lodging is at <hi>Bertand's,</hi> the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F><U+017F>er.</p>
            <p>He had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>poke the la<U+017F>t word, but the Apothecary, who de<U+017F>ired nothing
but employment, promis'd to bring him very <U+017F>uddenly what he de<U+017F>ired. He began
to <U+017F>pur his Tit with the points of nails which he had fa<U+017F>tened to the heels of his <U+017F>hoes
in <U+017F>tead of <U+017F>purs, and in a little time he came to <hi>Coulommiers</hi> where his <U+017F>hop was.
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing him departed, leaves the <U+017F>heep in the cu<U+017F>tody of <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and went
very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly into bed. The Apothecary being return'd, gave him the Phy<U+017F>ick he
had prepar'd for him, and receiv'd the ordinary rate for it. In the mean time <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
walking abroad met <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and enquired of him where his ma<U+017F>ter was.
He an<U+017F>wer'd him, he was <U+017F>ick, and that he was to take a Purge. So that <hi>Clarimond</hi>
went to <U+017F>ee him, and ask'd him what was his indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition. Methinks I feel in my
<U+017F>tomach <U+017F>ome extraordinaay crudities, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> the rea<U+017F>on whereof I conceive
can be no other, then that I have yet <U+017F>ome reliques of the nature of the <hi>Tree:</hi> I
would fain be rid of all the<U+017F>e encombrances, that my dige<U+017F>tion may be more free:
It may be there is yet <U+017F>ome part of me that is wood, and haply hath not yet fully
arrived to the tenderne<U+017F>s of fle<U+017F>h. Entertain no <U+017F>uch imagination, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond:
Hircan</hi>'s a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o able, that he hath perfectly put you into your former condition;
you are better in health then ever you were Before you had taken phy<U+017F>ic, you <U+017F>hould
have con<U+017F>idered, that whereas it <U+017F>hould do you good if you were <U+017F>ick, it will do you
<U+017F>o much the more hurt <U+017F>ince you are well. I am to tell you a <U+017F>tory to this purpo<U+017F>e:
I brought home with me on a time three of my friends to my own hou<U+017F>e, where we
debauch'd it four days together; the fifth day in the morning I repre<U+017F>ented unto
them the exce<U+017F>s we had u<U+017F>ed before, and began to remon<U+017F>trate to them that our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
could not but be in <U+017F>ome danger, if we did not purge, and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>per<U+017F>e the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
which we had gathered together. They all believ'd me; <U+017F>o I <U+017F>ent for an
Apothecary, who brought every one his do<U+017F>e. We lay all four in my chamber, two
in a bed. When every one was pre<U+017F>ented with his gla<U+017F>s, and that I ob<U+017F>erved my
Comrades began to make wry faces, Take courage, <U+017F>aid I to them, let's <U+017F>hut our
eyes, that we may not <U+017F>ee any thing; he that <U+017F>hall have di<U+017F>patch'd fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hall pay
nothing. As <U+017F>oon as I had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, they made all the ha<U+017F>te po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to take off
their Phy<U+017F>ick: but while they took no notice of me, I ca<U+017F>t mine be<U+017F>ides the bed,
and pre<U+017F>ently jump'd into the mid<U+017F>t of the room, and began to laugh at the re<U+017F>t;
and that when they were the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ick at heart, and in the mid<U+017F>t of their gripings
and wry-faces. Then did they di<U+017F>cover my knavery, but were fain to take all in je<U+017F>t.
I made it appear to them, that I <U+017F>tood not <U+017F>o much in need of Phy<U+017F>ick as they did,
and that it came not ami<U+017F>s to them; though out of indignation to <U+017F>ee that I had taken
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43725:103"/>
none, they were in a manner ready to ca<U+017F>t it up. I did very well not to purge my
<U+017F>elf, when I had no other rea<U+017F>on but a merry humor; and you have done as ill to
pre<U+017F>ume on the <U+017F>ame remedy without nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, or the advice of any Phy<U+017F>ician. I
have no other Phy<U+017F>ician then Love, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> 'tis he hath written me a receit upon
his own headband. A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, there is in this a <U+017F>ecret greater then you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
and though I <U+017F>hould have found my <U+017F>elf in no indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition at all, yet <U+017F>hould
I not have ab<U+017F>tained from phy<U+017F>ick. I believe you have read in the Poets, that Lovers
are oblig'd to conform them<U+017F>elves to the humors, qualities and actions of their
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es. They are <U+017F>ad in their <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>es, <U+017F>ick in their di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, joyful in their joy,
and healthful in their health; they laugh, when they <U+017F>ee them laugh; they weep,
to <U+017F>ee them weep, <U+017F>haring with them both in their delights and their torments. Now
having been informed that <hi>Charite</hi> was ill, how could it po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be I <U+017F>hould be
well? You will no longer wonder that I am a-bed, and have taken phy<U+017F>ik; for
having under<U+017F>tood that <U+017F>he had taken <U+017F>ome, I would needs imitate her, that <U+017F>o I
might ob<U+017F>erve tho<U+017F>e Laws which Love lays upon me. But O the wonderful fate of
my happine<U+017F>s! I have made u<U+017F>e of no other Apothecary, then what <U+017F>he had; the
<U+017F>ame hand pre<U+017F>ented us both with the gla<U+017F>s, and the gla<U+017F>s I drank out of, was the
very <U+017F>ame whence <U+017F>he had already drunk; and there wanted nothing, but to know
which <U+017F>ide <U+017F>he had put her lips, that <U+017F>o I might have put mine in the <U+017F>ame place. This
being pa<U+017F>t, we mu<U+017F>t believe, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that there remains now nothing, which
we might call excellent to be done in the world. You have accompli<U+017F>h'd a thing,
which even the mo<U+017F>t faithful Lovers never imagin'd; and the miracles of your hi<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
will be more remarkable then tho<U+017F>e of all the Fables. All this is as much as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> 'tis a long time <U+017F>ince I have given my <U+017F>elf up to the<U+017F>e amorous
conformities. I eat not any thing but what <hi>Charite</hi> loves and likes; I am only
pleas'd in that wherein <U+017F>he is, If <U+017F>he wipe her no<U+017F>e, I wipe mine too; if <U+017F>he <U+017F>pit
on the floor, I endeavour to do <U+017F>o too, though I <U+017F>hould thereby dry up my lungs,
and <U+017F>pet five hundred times before I hit the mark: if <U+017F>he chance to walk before me,
I <U+017F>trive to put my feet in the <U+017F>ame place where <U+017F>he had trod before; and I put my
<U+017F>elf into all the po<U+017F>ture which I <U+017F>ee her in, as if I plaid with her that game, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a man mu<U+017F>t do all he <U+017F>ees done. You adde miracle to miracle, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond</hi> I
am infinitely glad to hear all this from your own mouth; for if I had had the relation
from another, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily have believed it, though the Relaters <U+017F>hould
have bequeath'd them<U+017F>elves to all the Catchpoles of <hi>Pluto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having in di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e entertain'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> a while with
other, left him, for to go home to dinner; and there being <U+017F>erv'd to the table a
good <U+017F>ort of Broth, he <U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome to the poor <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on. The re<U+017F>t of that day
his Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s took charge of him: and <hi>Carmelin</hi> being return'd in the evening out
of the fields, was very inqui<U+017F>itive to know how he did: who told him, that his <U+017F>ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
was nothing, <U+017F>o that <hi>Charite</hi> were recovered; and that a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as it were day he
mu<U+017F>t needs have <U+017F>ome account of her. <hi>Carmelin</hi> its <U+017F>uppos'd, <U+017F>lept not much, he
ri<U+017F>e before it was quite day, and went to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Ca<U+017F>tle. By that time he was
there, they were all ari<U+017F>ing; where having met with one of <hi>Leonora</hi>'s maids, he
asked her whether the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> were <U+017F>till <U+017F>ick? and if there
were no means to <U+017F>peak with her. She is <U+017F>icker then <U+017F>he was ye<U+017F>terday (an<U+017F>wers
the maid, who knew well enough whom he <U+017F>pake of) <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>leep yet a while<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
<U+017F>ince ye<U+017F>terday in the evening <U+017F>he hath had a <U+017F>welling over her cheek, and one eye,
<U+017F>o that <U+017F>he hardly <U+017F>ees any thing, and <U+017F>he hath her face half <U+017F>wath'd about: <U+017F>he
mu<U+017F>t be let blood anon, for to divert the humor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having receiv'd this an<U+017F>wer, return'd to his Ma<U+017F>ter to tell it him. When
he knew it, he fell into an un<U+017F>peakable affliction, yet not willing to be defective
in the imitation of <hi>Charite,</hi> he <U+017F>aid he would be let blood as well as <U+017F>he. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
knew not where there was any Chyrurgion; but his ho<U+017F>t directed him to a village
clo<U+017F>e by, where there was one. He was ready to be gone to fetch him, when <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
cryes out, Stay, <U+017F>tay <hi>Carmelin, I</hi> will have no other Chyrurgion but my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es,
thou mu<U+017F>t know who that is. Go again to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, thou wilt finde him there
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43725:104"/>
yet: but before thou goe<U+017F>t, finde me out <U+017F>ome linnen or other, and binde up my
eye and my cheek. To what end, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> you all nothing there! Ah!
Stupidity! cryes out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Can <hi>Charite</hi> ail any thing which <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t not feel? Now
that <U+017F>he hardly <U+017F>ees anything; would<U+017F>t thou have me have my perfect light? Now
that <U+017F>he hath the u<U+017F>e but of one eye, mu<U+017F>t <hi>I</hi> enjoy both? <hi>I</hi> will have but one eye
no more then <U+017F>he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing, notwith<U+017F>tanding all this, that <hi>Carmelin</hi> did not much make it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
to get him <U+017F>ome linnen, reach'd his breeches and took out his handkerchief,
which he gave him to binde up his face withal: But now there happens a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover<U+017F>ie
in his minde, becau<U+017F>e he knew not which cheek it was that <hi>Charite</hi> had
<U+017F>wollen. <hi>Carmelin</hi> told him he had not remembred to ask whether it were the right
or the left: So that his Ma<U+017F>ter, for fear of mi<U+017F>taking, thought it mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecure to binde
up all his face. <hi>Carmelin</hi> an<U+017F>wers, that that were not to any purpo<U+017F>e, and that it
were be<U+017F>t <U+017F>tay till the Chyrurgion were come, who <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>olve him on which
cheek he ought to ail any thing: So having pre<U+017F>ently given the flock in charge to
<hi>Bertrands</hi> <U+017F>on, he returned to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, to <U+017F>atisfie <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s humors, which were not
a little trouble<U+017F>ome to him. He came thither ju<U+017F>t in the nick; for he met with a
Chyrurgion of <hi>Coulommiers,</hi> who was coming out. He entreated him to come and
let his Ma<U+017F>ter blood. The Chyrurgion had no hor<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that he was fain to go along
with him a foot as far as <hi>Bertrands.</hi> When he ask'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in which arm he would be
bled; the Shepherd told him, in the <U+017F>ame arm as the fair Lady he had let blood at
<hi>Orontes</hi>'s. The Chyrurgion having told him it was the left, he took his, and took at
lea<U+017F>t three Porringers of blood. <hi>I</hi> fear me it is on the left cheek that that fair one
ails <U+017F>omewhat, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> You are in the right Sir, replies the Chyrurgion. Binde
up mine too then, replies the Shepherd. You have no <U+017F>welling there as <U+017F>he hath,
<U+017F>aies the other; why <U+017F>hould <hi>I</hi> do <U+017F>o? You will not do it? replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> let <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
do it then. Thereupon <hi>Carmelin</hi> willing to obey him, came and bound up
half his face: And the Chyrurgion being ready to be gone, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>poke to him to
this purpo<U+017F>e; <hi>If you would have me e<U+017F>teem you any thing, learn the art of Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
otherwi<U+017F>e then you have. Ob<U+017F>erve, that amorous wounds are much more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
then tho<U+017F>e you dre<U+017F>s every day; and that experience teaches us, that a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
is never in any <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, wherein the <U+017F>ervant <U+017F>ympathizes not with her; and in a Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e,
in<U+017F>tead of one <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on there are ever two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chyrurgion after this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, receiv'd his gratuity, and went away much
amaz'd. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having put his arm in a <U+017F>carf, bid <hi>Carmelin</hi> help him on with his
cloathes. As he walk'd up and down the hou<U+017F>e, comes in <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
careful to know in what po<U+017F>ture he was. Seeing him with all his <U+017F>wathings about
him, he ask'd him what hurt had hapned to him <U+017F>ince. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> told him, that he
would needs be let blood, and <U+017F>wath'd as <hi>Charite</hi> was, who had a <U+017F>welling on her
cheek. The imitation is very noble, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond</hi> to him; but it is not to the
full, for methinks you <U+017F>hould have your face <U+017F>wollen, as well as your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. That's
it <hi>I</hi> would have per<U+017F>waded him to, replies, <hi>Carmelin:</hi> and he <U+017F>hould either have
given him<U+017F>elf, or got another to give him a many good blows, to make his eyes
<U+017F>well. Thy knavery is not the lea<U+017F>t in the world, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> hold thou thy peace,
there's no body <U+017F>peaks to thee. As for your part <hi>Clarimond,</hi> you are to know,
that <hi>I</hi> was not only coment to have the left eye bound up, but that a while <U+017F>ince,
<hi>I</hi> would needs have them both, not knowing which it was that <U+017F>hould be. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
being gone to fetch the Chyrurgion, before he had bound me them up, <hi>I</hi> have
always kept my hand on them, le<U+017F>t <hi>I</hi> might <U+017F>ee any thing: for is it not fit the eyes
of a Lover <U+017F>hould be ob<U+017F>cur'd, when one of their <U+017F>uns <U+017F>hine not? As for my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of blood, be<U+017F>ides that it is in imitation of <hi>Charite,</hi> it is otherwi<U+017F>e very good
for me; but e<U+017F>pecially for this rea<U+017F>on, that <hi>I</hi> have been much pleas'd to <U+017F>ee my
blood. Look on't <hi>Clarimond,</hi> you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee therein the pourtraicture of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s:
for all my veins are filled with that fair figure, which takes up all my thoughts.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> beheld the blood, and to <U+017F>atisfie <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>aid, that he <U+017F>aw therein <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
re<U+017F>embling a face. With that little <U+017F>ight that is left me, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to him,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43725:104"/>
I can <U+017F>ee <hi>Charite</hi> there in her whole proportion. For your part, <U+017F>hould you ob<U+017F>erve
nothing, 'twere not your fault, but it were Loves, who would not permit you to
<U+017F>ee any thing therein,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s el<U+017F>where left <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> being now a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd, that he was
<U+017F>ick of a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, which no Phy<U+017F>ick or Phelbotomy could cure. He purpo<U+017F>ely <U+017F>ent a
Lacquay to <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elm,</hi> to acquaint them with the late actions of the
Shepherd. Had they not been taken up in the entertainment of <U+017F>ome that were
come to vi<U+017F>it them, they had given this poor patient a vi<U+017F>it.</p>
            <p>The night being come, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> went to bed as he was wont, but much re<U+017F>t he had
not, <U+017F>o much did the remembrance of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es command di<U+017F>turb his thoughts.
He was ever at <hi>Carmelin</hi> with his elbow, for to awake him, and to put him to <U+017F>ome
new explications of it. I cannot endure to repeat the <U+017F>ame thing <U+017F>o often, <U+017F>aies <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
to him, or at lea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>tay till it be day for to que<U+017F>tion me. The night is onely
made to <U+017F>leep, would you have me le<U+017F>s happy then the bea<U+017F>ts, which now are every
where a<U+017F>leep. I'll lay you a wager there is not at this pre<U+017F>ent one of our <U+017F>heep
awake. Wilt thou conform thy <U+017F>elf to the bea<U+017F>ts? replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> 'tis a bruital feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
that thou de<U+017F>ire<U+017F>t. The night is not only ordain'd to <U+017F>leep in, but al<U+017F>o to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ult
about affairs: Know that the greate<U+017F>t wits and ingenuities are they that re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t
the charms of <U+017F>leep, to entertain them<U+017F>elves with their imaginations. The <hi>Lovers</hi> are
they al<U+017F>o that have this cu<U+017F>tom, and e<U+017F>pecially among them the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> All
the fault thou art guilty of in not imitating me, proceeds from this, that thou ha<U+017F>t yet
thy Liberty. O what a prodigy it is to <U+017F>ee a <hi>Shepherd</hi> <U+017F>o <hi>free!</hi> Thou ought'<U+017F>t rather
be Soul-le<U+017F>s, then Love-le<U+017F>s. But it is true, that I fore<U+017F>ee thou wilt <U+017F>hortly be put
into the chain as well as the re<U+017F>t. Love is importunate, till he wound tho<U+017F>e that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t
him; and none loves more pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, then a cold di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, as thine is, when
it begins to be enflamed. Whether it be <U+017F>o or not, its no great matter, <U+017F>aies <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin;</hi>
but for the pre<U+017F>ent I am <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to re<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf, that though they <U+017F>hould
cry, Fire, I would not ri<U+017F>e, whether they <U+017F>hould mean the fire of Love, or that of
the Chimney.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, the two Shepherds <U+017F>pake no more one to another. When
it was day, they put on their cloathes both together, and for company-<U+017F>ake went
abroad with the flock: while they drave it <U+017F>till before them, being near a farm of
<hi>Hircans,</hi> where they had not yet been, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> made a <U+017F>ign to <hi>Carmelin;</hi> and <U+017F>aid
to him, if I am not deceiv'd, I hear the <U+017F>ound of a rural in<U+017F>trument, without que<U+017F>tion
we are now in the Shepherds Countrey. <hi>Carmelin</hi> confe<U+017F>t, that he al<U+017F>o heard <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
very harmonious: And de<U+017F>cending into a little valley, they perceiv'd a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
playing on the Bag-pipes. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being come near him, <hi>Pan</hi> defend thee gentle
Shepherd, <U+017F>aies he to him, I am ravi<U+017F>h'd to <U+017F>ee thee, it is a long time <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>aw
any of our quality, thy entertainment here is very delightful. Thou in<U+017F>pire<U+017F>t the
holes of thy <U+017F>weet <U+017F>ounding-pipe. Now am I certain thou art no idle per<U+017F>on; had
I my Gittarrhe here, we <U+017F>hould make a con<U+017F>ort together.</p>
            <p>This Shepherd, who was a Countrey fellow, <U+017F>imple enough, was amaz'd to <U+017F>ee
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> in the po<U+017F>ture they were in, that he view'd them one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from head to foot; in<U+017F>omuch, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing he <U+017F>aid nothing, continued his
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Do<U+017F>t thou think, <U+017F>aies he to him, that the in<U+017F>trument thou playe<U+017F>t on
is more proper for tho<U+017F>e of our quality then the Gittarrhe? Were I <U+017F>ure of it, I
would learn on the Bagpipes, to the end I might be <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> in all things. Ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> though <hi>I</hi> cannot play well on the Bag-pipes, yet I can do <U+017F>omewhat at
the Flute. Here's one <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircans</hi> Shepherd, lets <U+017F>ee what you can do. <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
took the Flute out of his hands, and began to play <hi>Gueridon's</hi> tune, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Shepherd bore a part with the Bagpipe, whereat <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was very well <U+017F>atisfied.
When they had di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s'd their in<U+017F>truments: My Lads, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to them, your
mu<U+017F>ick is <U+017F>weeter to the ear, then the noi<U+017F>e of a brook that <U+017F>lides through the peebles
'Tis delightful to hear the plaints of a Heifer, when Love pricks her; <hi><U+017F>weet</hi> is the
<U+017F>inging of a Swan, that's dying, <hi><U+017F>weet</hi> is the warbling of the nightingale, <hi><U+017F>weet</hi> is the
honey, which is prepar'd by the little bees; <hi><U+017F>weet</hi> is the <U+017F>ugar of <hi>Madera:</hi> but far
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43725:105"/>
more <hi><U+017F>weet</hi> are you Pa<U+017F>toral in<U+017F>truments. Some other time I will make you talk
of Eclogues, after the manner of <hi>Theocritus, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard;</hi> and I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
him that <U+017F>hall do be<U+017F>t with a basket of flowers, a birds-cage; a chee<U+017F>e-basket, or
<U+017F>ome fine garland. In good faith, I did not think <hi>Carmelin</hi> could have done <U+017F>o
much: O how much worthier do I now e<U+017F>teem him to make a Shepherd, then I
did before. However, I will not learn to play on the Flute as he doth, nor yet on
the Bag-pipes: For I remember I have heard it <U+017F>aid, that <hi>Minerva</hi> beholding her
<U+017F>elf in a fountain, while <U+017F>he plaid on the Flute, <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t it away immediately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd too deformed in that action, wherein one mu<U+017F>t over-<U+017F>well his
cheeks. I will not di<U+017F>figure my countenance. The <hi>Lute,</hi> the <hi>Guitarrhe,</hi> the <hi>Viol,</hi>
the <hi>Bandore,</hi> and the <hi>Timbrel</hi> are for us Shepherds of better quality; the <hi>Flute,</hi> the
<hi>Oaten-pipe,</hi> and the <hi>Bag-pipe,</hi> for Shepherds of a lower degree, as <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and
<U+017F>ome others of this Countrey. Since you are my <hi>Ma<U+017F>ter,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> there is
no que<U+017F>tion but <hi>I</hi> am below you: yet <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould wi<U+017F>h <hi>I</hi> might not be called <hi>Servant,</hi>
as there are <U+017F>ome that do call me <U+017F>o. <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire to have a more honorable title:
All the rea<U+017F>on in the world, <hi>Carmelin;</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is: I</hi> declare thee my <hi>Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary</hi>
in what <U+017F>hall concern <hi>Shepherdry,</hi> as <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> hath his <hi>Commi<U+017F><U+017F>aries</hi> in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
of the revenues: Thy principal charge <U+017F>hall be to have a care of my flocks, when
<hi>I</hi> am not in place. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was very well <U+017F>atisfied with this dignity, and his
Ma<U+017F>ter having bidden farewel to <hi>Hircans</hi> Shepherd, as he al<U+017F>o had done, they drave
their <U+017F>heep before them into another place: leaving the other <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd to <U+017F>ee
tho<U+017F>e two Shepherds marching after <U+017F>o wretched a flock, that it was one of the
<U+017F>trange<U+017F>t things he had ever <U+017F>een.</p>
            <p>Having left him, they march'd on <U+017F>till for a good while; and at length <U+017F>itting
down near a fountain, they are bread, and drank water. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was not the
be<U+017F>t pleas'd at this entertainment, this was not the life his Ma<U+017F>ter put him in hopes
of. He thought he <U+017F>hould have had none but Wedding-days, whereas they made
him temperate in <U+017F>pight of his teeth. Having been <U+017F>o ill treated as to chear, he
mu<U+017F>t di<U+017F>patch for <hi>Orontes's</hi> for an account of <hi>Charite's</hi> di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition; which employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would have gone much to his heart, were there not <U+017F>ome hope they might
have <U+017F>o much con<U+017F>ideration as to make him drink.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being left alone, his flock and his dog rather led, then were guided by him;
he follow'd them <U+017F>till, never con<U+017F>idering whither they led him. The <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s of his
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was all the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of his thoughts. While he was in this contemplation,
one of his <U+017F>heep clambred up a little hillock, whereon was a tree, and gra<U+017F>s all about
it; another pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>econds it: but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having <U+017F>truck at the former with his
<U+017F>heephook, it went round the tree, and came down; the <U+017F>econd did the like; As
al<U+017F>o a third, that al<U+017F>o was gotten up, and then a fourth and a fifth; and <U+017F>o did they
all, even to the la<U+017F>t. The fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>heep <U+017F>eeing the re<U+017F>t gotten up, got up again, and
came down, the re<U+017F>t did the like after it, going <U+017F>till about the tree, as being a <U+017F>ort
of creatures, who<U+017F>e nature being to do what they <U+017F>ee the re<U+017F>t do, they would never
have gotten into their way, before they had all been where they had <U+017F>een their
companions. They would have clambred up, and come down, and would have
gone about <U+017F>till, had there not pa<U+017F>s'd by a man that put an end to the <U+017F>port; for
<hi>Mu<U+017F>edor,</hi> which was not train'd up to Shepherdry, and could do nothing but bark at
tho<U+017F>e that pa<U+017F>s'd by, drew them not together; and as for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpris'd
with the <U+017F>port, that he could have wi<U+017F>h'd it might have la<U+017F>ted to the worlds end. He
who was come into the place, came and embrac'd him; and to take him out of his
Tran<U+017F>portation, <U+017F>aid to him, Heaven ble<U+017F>s thee! <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Shepherds</hi> of <hi>Brie,</hi> but
rather of all <hi>Europe,</hi> nay of all the earth: How fortunate am I to have met thee?
Fame having convey'd thy name and merit into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which is my Countrey,
I was pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>eiz'd with a de<U+017F>ire to come and learn of thee the art to become
happy. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having retreated three <U+017F>teps to view the man, who was clad like a
Shepherd as him<U+017F>elf, he found he knew him not; and yet conceiving him<U+017F>elf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to him for the pains he had taken to finde him, he went and embrac'd him
again, and <U+017F>aid to him, Welcome, gentle Shepherd, <U+017F>ince thou art the fir<U+017F>t that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43725:105"/>
ca<U+017F>ts him<U+017F>elf into the arms of my protection, I <U+017F>wear to thee thou <U+017F>halt be the fir<U+017F>t
of whom I <U+017F>hall take care. I have no more to beg then thy name, that I may know
whom I am obliged to. My name is <hi>Philiris,</hi> replies the Shepherd. Ah! what an
excellent good name is that! <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> how ea<U+017F>ie it is to <U+017F>ee that thou art a
Shepherd by birth! I make no que<U+017F>tion but thy hi<U+017F>tory mu<U+017F>t be the noble<U+017F>t in all the
world; wilt thou do me the favour to tell it me? I will tell thee even to tho<U+017F>e
things, whereof there are yet none con<U+017F>cious but the Rocks and the Woods, an<U+017F>wers
<hi>Philiris:</hi> But let us find <U+017F>ome place where coolne<U+017F>s dwells; for this is <U+017F>o open and
<U+017F>o hot, that it <U+017F>eems to be no other then that wherein Nature was delivered of
the Sun.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the two Shepherds took their way to a Thicket that was hard by,
while there pa<U+017F><U+017F>es by a Coach wherein were <hi>Orontes, Florida, Leonora, Angelica,
An<U+017F>elme, Montenor, Clarimond,</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whom the Ladies had newly taken
up, poor Rogue as he was, to make <U+017F>ome <U+017F>port with. They all pre<U+017F>ently lighted, and
<hi>Orontes</hi> told <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that taking the air in the fields, they had met his Journy-man
Shepherd, who had acquainted them that he was <U+017F>ick of the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e as his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that <hi>Carmelin</hi> had <U+017F>aid nothing but what was true; and <U+017F>o
was putting him<U+017F>elf into a po<U+017F>ture to make long narrations; but he hears certain
cries that made him be <U+017F>ilent. Putting his finger on his mouth, as a <U+017F>ign to the re<U+017F>t,
he drew neer the thicket whence the noi<U+017F>e came, and all follow'd him very lei<U+017F>urely,
till they came to certain trees, among which they <U+017F>aw two men cloath'd in white
<hi>Taffata,</hi> having very fine <hi>Scrips</hi> hanging in <U+017F>carfs, <hi>Strawn-hats</hi> on their heads, and
painted <hi>Sheephooks</hi> in their hands.</p>
            <p>They made as if they heeded not tho<U+017F>e that dogg'd them; and one of them being
lain down on the earth as it had been to <U+017F>leep, the other began this complaint.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Gentle Zephirs, who reign in the<U+017F>e places! were there ever <U+017F>adder <U+017F>ighs then
mine mingled with your breathings? Ye Trees who are now <U+017F>o green, have you
ever <U+017F>een fires as mine, which are <U+017F>uch as would dry you up to the very roots?
And you Springs, were your waters warmed by any tears bigger then mine? O
then you Zephirs, Trees, and Springs, if ever my Shepherde<U+017F>s come hither, tell
her what you have <U+017F>een me <U+017F>uffer. But alas! you are deaf as well as dumb, O
dear witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of my martyrdom. There's none but <hi>Polidor</hi> that is able to <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
me. What doth that faithfull friend think on? hath he no compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on
one in his own condition? How wilt thou have me a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t thee, dear <hi>Meliantes!</hi>
an<U+017F>wers that <hi>Polidor:</hi> Knowe<U+017F>t thou not that I want comfort more then thy
<U+017F>elf? She that I adore will not believe my love; and not meeting with any <U+017F>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
occa<U+017F>ions to make it appear I am <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable that I mu<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>h her <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
that I may <U+017F>hew my affection in her relief. Having the other day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
my eyes from hers, which dazled me, I fix'd them on her neck, thinking
there they might be more <U+017F>afe: But O God! that Neck is Snow; 'twas her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
to make me lo<U+017F>e an eye, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> did by fixing his too much on the <U+017F>now
of the <hi>Alpes.</hi> Nor can I indeed do any thing, but I am tormented by <U+017F>ome fre<U+017F>h
accident; and as <hi>Mithridates</hi> lived by poy<U+017F>on, <U+017F>o do I on amorous thoughts. Ah
wretch that I am, what <U+017F>hall I do then, cries out <hi>Meliantes,</hi> <U+017F>ince Heaven, Fate,
Nature, my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and <hi>Polidor</hi> for<U+017F>ake me? I am now on the amorous <U+017F>ea,
where a tempe<U+017F>t whirls about my <U+017F>hip; but though it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>unk, and I put
to fortune, yet if I can but embrace the neck of my Godde<U+017F>s, that fair pillar of
white marble planted above two living rocks, I <U+017F>hall e<U+017F>cape <U+017F>hipwrack.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus far was <hi>Meliantes</hi> gone, when <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> not being able to refrain <U+017F>peaking any
longer, cries out, God be prais'd! I have found what I look'd for. How learned
are the<U+017F>e Shepherds! they <U+017F>peak altogether by Allu<U+017F>ions and Metaphors. The
Shepherd <hi>Polidor</hi> upon that <U+017F>tarts up, and looking on him, <hi>Philiris,</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
Which of you three, <U+017F>ays he, is the <U+017F>ervant of the fair <hi>Charite?</hi> That am I, and no
other, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> O happy day to us, continued <hi>Polidor:</hi> It is a long time <U+017F>ince
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43725:106"/>
my Comrade and I have been to <U+017F>eek you: Seeing you all three of a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
I knew not which was <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> You are then to know that Love plays the
cruel Tyrant over us; and we believe there is not any one in the world of whom
we might hope better advice and direction then from you, in our affairs. I am a
true Phy<U+017F>itian of minds, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Tell me that of yours, and I will pre<U+017F>cribe
you excellent remedies. This made <hi>Polidor</hi> weep, and wiping his eyes with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiff,
You will oblige me to repeat and renew <U+017F>trange torments, <U+017F>ays he; I
<U+017F>hould not de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon to thru<U+017F>t the weapon again into my wounds: I <U+017F>hould cry
too loud, and importune the ears of the<U+017F>e Knights and Nymphs that are in your
attendance; I am ba<U+017F>hfull before <U+017F>o many. Let <hi>Meliantes</hi> <U+017F>peak then, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi>
Who, I? an<U+017F>wers the other: I have need of whole ages to prepare my <U+017F>elf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the hi<U+017F>tory of my adventures: I have <U+017F>o many things to <U+017F>ay, that when I <U+017F>hould
once begin, there cannot a word proceed from my mouth, no more then there do
drops of water out of a cup that is overfill'd. Ah! Love, who art the be<U+017F>tower of
the<U+017F>e torments, after thou ha<U+017F>t taken away my heart, wilt thou deprive me of the
liberty to complain? And if thou put<U+017F>t me every day to the rack, is it to any other
end but to make me confe<U+017F>s all my <U+017F>ecrets? Tyrant, Executioner! cut out my
tongue, or <U+017F>uffer me to tell what I endure.</p>
            <p>In <U+017F>aying this, <hi>Meliantes</hi> beat the ground with his foot, and began to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
into <U+017F>uch po<U+017F>tures as none but a mad man could be guilty of. So that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
taking him by the arm, endeavoured to give him the be<U+017F>t con<U+017F>olations he could. In
the mean time, mo<U+017F>t that were pre<U+017F>ent look'd one on another, and were <U+017F>ilent out
of amazement: They imagin'd that <hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> were no wi<U+017F>er then
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and that the other Shepherd he had brought with him was not much behind
them. But it is not to be conceived that Nature could furni<U+017F>h three men <U+017F>ick of
the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e as the <hi>Extravagant Shepherd,</hi> who mu<U+017F>t be individual in his kind.
However they knew not what to think, and they <U+017F>aw great demon<U+017F>trations of folly
in tho<U+017F>e new Shepherds. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having appeared, <hi>Meliantes</hi> <U+017F>ays to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that
he was very glad of his pre<U+017F>ence at the rencontre of the Shepherds, that in his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tory
he might <U+017F>et down the true relation: And that as for the meeting with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris</hi>
and another Shepherd, he had <U+017F>een that plaid on the Bagpipes, he would give
him the particulars. I tell thee this freely, continues he, becau<U+017F>e I believe thou ha<U+017F>t
already begun the Book of my Loves. As for my part, that I am lodg'd neer thy
Ca<U+017F>tle, 'tis principally becau<U+017F>e thou might'<U+017F>t be more particularly inform'd of my
adventures: And for the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on thou did<U+017F>t well to come and <U+017F>ee me when I
was <U+017F>ick, that thou might'<U+017F>t quote my <U+017F>everal fits. Will you not al<U+017F>o have me <U+017F>peak
punctually of your Phy<U+017F>ick, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> <U+017F>hall I count your <U+017F>tools, and tell
with what paper you wip'd your breech, as for example, if it were with <U+017F>ome Letter
the <U+017F>tile whereof was as <U+017F>mooth as cotton, or with <U+017F>ome Ver<U+017F>es which were as <U+017F>harp
as awls, <U+017F>o that they bled you behind? You are very much in the right to give me
this direction; for 'tis now adays the mode with <U+017F>ome to make Books of the relation
of their di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; and there are <U+017F>ome will needs in<U+017F>ert the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of their Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary.
Do as thou <U+017F>halt think fit, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> Sir, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> putting off his hat
to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> will you not al<U+017F>o write my hi<U+017F>tory? I be<U+017F>eech you Sir; I <U+017F>hall think
my <U+017F>elf as much oblig'd to you as my Ma<U+017F>ter. I will certainly do it, nay, I will
write the hi<U+017F>tory of thy Dog. I thank you Sir, replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> but I give you
notice of one thing, that is, that you call me not <hi>Lacquey</hi> nor <hi>Serving-man;</hi> I am
a <hi>Lieutenant</hi> or <hi>Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary</hi> in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of <hi>Shepherdry.</hi> How now, Impudence
and importunity together! (<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> taking <hi>Carmelin</hi> by the arm) be it <U+017F>ufficient
that thou art <U+017F>poken of as appearing in <U+017F>ome of my adventures, though it be to
carry a Letter, or do <U+017F>ome me<U+017F><U+017F>age. What, do<U+017F>t thou expect a particular Hi<U+017F>tory,
who never did<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>h any thing which may not be written in <hi>impalpable</hi> paper
with <hi>invi<U+017F>ible</hi> ink, or on the <U+017F>urface of the waters with a feather taken out of the
wings of the wind? Is it not a <U+017F>hame to <U+017F>ee thee as big as thy father or mother,
that yet ha<U+017F>t done nothing noble? Where did<U+017F>t thou ever make any Ver<U+017F>es, or be<U+017F>tow
a Serenade on a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, or ha<U+017F>t gone through <U+017F>ome adventure worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended

            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:43725:106"/>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> being <U+017F>omewhat ca<U+017F>t down at this rude reproof, retreated <U+017F>cratching
his head: but as he was going to make <U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>e, the three Shepherds came and
told <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that their loves were impatient, and that they would bring him to one
of their friends, whom they would gladly con<U+017F>ult with about their affairs. So they
carried him and <hi>Carmelin</hi> away, and amaz'd the company <U+017F>o much the more; for
if one <U+017F>aid, I'll <U+017F>tab my <U+017F>elf to be reveng'd of the cruelty of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, another
<U+017F>wore he would ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf headlong down <U+017F>ome rock: and they <U+017F>eem'd to be <U+017F>o
extravagant, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> appear'd as wi<U+017F>e in compari<U+017F>on of them, as <hi>Socrates</hi> the
Philo<U+017F>opher. This bred in every one a de<U+017F>ire to be acquainted with them, yet they
follow'd them not, becau<U+017F>e they thought they would not <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly leave the
Countrey, and that they might be <U+017F>een at lei<U+017F>ure <U+017F>ome other time. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Ladies got into the coach again, and made an end of their walk.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the five Shepherds having cro<U+017F>s'd certain thickets, came into a
little meadow, where two men and a woman were walking. One of them was
<hi>Hircan,</hi> whom <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> knew pre<U+017F>ently; and the other was <hi>Fontenay,</hi> whom he had
not known, had he not been named, becau<U+017F>e he was not clad in <U+017F>carlet, as he was
wont, but had a <U+017F>uit of white <hi>Taffata.</hi> As for the fair Lady which was with them,
it was <hi>Synopa;</hi> yet the Shepherd having told <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that <U+017F>he was a Shepherde<U+017F>s call'd
<hi>Parthenice,</hi> that they had brought with them, he believ'd it, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had on
a white petticoat, which <U+017F>he was not us'd to wear. O how like is this <hi>Parthenice</hi>
to a Nymph of the waters that I know, <U+017F>aies he then. You are much in the right,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin</hi> to him <U+017F>oftly: I believe <U+017F>he is the very <U+017F>ame, yet mu<U+017F>t I withal think
<U+017F>he is none of the <U+017F>he-devils of your <hi>Sabath,</hi> <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is pleas'd to be <U+017F>een in the
day. Would you be content I <U+017F>hould fall in love with her? Strike on <hi>Carmelin,</hi> it
will be very well done, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> methinks I <U+017F>ee Love having his Bow ready to
<U+017F>hoot at thee; open thy brea<U+017F>t, and prepare thy <U+017F>elf to receive that wound. Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
do what I bid thee. <hi>Carmelin</hi> would not di<U+017F>obey his Ma<U+017F>ter, being <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpris'd
with joy, that he knew not what he did; for he had ever believed what his Ma<U+017F>ter
<U+017F>aid, that there was no more to do but to choo<U+017F>e a wench; and that he would
cau<U+017F>e her to be given him in marriage, be <U+017F>he never <U+017F>o rich, or never <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>om.
<hi>Hircan</hi> having by this time perceiv'd them, came on and <U+017F>aluted them. Are you
not now well-pleas'd in <U+017F>o good company? <U+017F>aies he to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Tho<U+017F>e Shepherds have
travell'd up and down long ere they could finde you. Any one will be a Shepherd
with you, and here's my Co<U+017F>in hath put on the habit for to follow you. He is
much to be commended, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> out of that con<U+017F>ideration I pardon him the
affront he did me: It hath been heavy on my heart ever <U+017F>ince: But you <U+017F>hall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
him never to offer at me any more, really, or <U+017F>o much as in thought. I <U+017F>hould
abjure all kinred with him if he do: but think no more on it, replies <hi>Hircan:</hi> He
is now as gentle as a Lamb, we will henceforward lead a peaceable life, and it is my
de<U+017F>ire to become a Shepherd as well as the re<U+017F>t. Do not <U+017F>o by any means, <U+017F>age <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> do you not know, that in every good <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral,</hi> there is ever a
Magician, who is never habited as the other Shepherds; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t the Prie<U+017F>ts keep
in their Sacerdotal Ve<U+017F>tments, and the <hi>Satyrs</hi> continue in their nakedne<U+017F>s. <hi>Hircan</hi>
having granted him this, they with great admiration view'd the <U+017F>wathings about
his head; and the Shepherd <hi>Fontenay</hi> could not refrain asking him, What ails your
left eye, Shepherd, have you receiv'd <U+017F>ome blow on it? Mu<U+017F>t we all have our faces
bound for our accommodation of being Shepherds? This is particular to me, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wers
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> this binding up of my face is in imitation of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
is in this po<U+017F>ture; imitate thou thine in other things, as thou <U+017F>halt think fit.
But ob<U+017F>erve my incomparable <U+017F>ecret: <hi>Charite</hi> hath refus'd to honor me with any
of her commands; and for want of her commands, to comfort my <U+017F>elf, I do what
I <U+017F>ee her do; <U+017F>o that by my own miraculous <U+017F>ubtilty, I <U+017F>till obey her in <U+017F>pight of
her teeth, But 'tis very well remembred (<U+017F>aies he, turning to <hi>Carmelin)</hi> ha<U+017F>t thou
any tydings how that fair one does? I could not go and <U+017F>ee her, for the<U+017F>e Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<U+017F>taid me, and got me into the coach, replies <hi>Carmelin:</hi> yet thus much I have
learn'd, that her di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e neither advances nor declines. Let heaven do its plea<U+017F>ure,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43725:107"/>
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but as long as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall be bound up, I will be <U+017F>o too. This binding
makes you <hi>I</hi> know not how more graceful, <U+017F>aies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> and yet you are not as
yet but half <hi>Cupid;</hi> for you are but half blinde. <hi>By the borns of Pan</hi> thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> thou wilt advance; Thy meeting is fortunate, and I dare tell
thee, that though I am not <hi>Cupid, I</hi> am at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a one as could give him birth
in the world, were he not already.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>poke this, <hi>Carmelin</hi> twiching him behinde, ask'd him <U+017F>oftly, What
<U+017F>hall <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ay to this fair one? Offer her thy <U+017F>ervice, and go no farther for the fir<U+017F>t
time. <hi>Carmelin</hi> pre<U+017F>ently thinking his de<U+017F>igns could not but have a fair i<U+017F><U+017F>ue; went
and <U+017F>aid to <hi>Synopa,</hi> Madam, if you have any occa<U+017F>ion for a <U+017F>ervant as faithful as
any in the world, behold the Shepherd <hi>Carmelin</hi> offers him<U+017F>elf to you, 'Twere to
be known what wages you would have (an<U+017F>wers <hi>Parthenice</hi> very coldly) but indeed
<hi>I</hi> am not at lei<U+017F>ure to think of that now. Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>poken, <U+017F>he whi<U+017F>pered <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Fontenay:</hi> after which, they left <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and took their way by
an ob<U+017F>cure path, <U+017F>o that they were pre<U+017F>ently out of <U+017F>ight. <hi>Carmelin</hi> thought they
had <U+017F>omewhat to do together; but <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Fontenay</hi> being <U+017F>oon return'd, they
brought not <hi>Synopa</hi> with them; <U+017F>o that he took the boldne<U+017F>s to ask them where <U+017F>he
was. <hi>Hircan</hi> told him, he had left her on the brow of a <hi>hillock,</hi> entertaining her
<U+017F>elf with her own imaginations. He would have gone ju<U+017F>t then to <U+017F>eek her, but his
Ma<U+017F>ter going along with <hi>Hircan</hi> and the Shepherds, hinder'd the de<U+017F>ign. They
were come very near the Ca<U+017F>tle of this Magician, when they <U+017F>aw a very hand<U+017F>om
woman i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the grove: She was habited like the Shepherde<U+017F>s on a <U+017F>tage;
and for her countenance, it could not more re<U+017F>emble that of <hi>Lucida</hi> then it did, for
indeed it was <U+017F>he. Yet <hi>Hircan</hi> having <U+017F>aid it was a Shepherde<U+017F>s call'd <hi>Amaryllis,
Ly<U+017F>is</hi> firmly believ'd it. This is the day of Miracles, <U+017F>aid the Shepherd; behold
here's a Shepherde<U+017F>s in my judgement is very like an aquatick Nymph, who<U+017F>e image
is graven in my minde, though <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>aw her only by Moon-light. There is the <U+017F>ame
re<U+017F>emblances of faces in all your <hi>Romances:</hi> Tho<U+017F>e which hold them impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, why
are they not here now to acknowledge their error?</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Amaryllis</hi> came and did reverence to the company; and <hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was time to retire, ask'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> whether he would do him the honor to <U+017F>up with
him. He thank'd him very kindely for the civiltty; but for this time he mu<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
it, as not thinking fit to keep fe<U+017F>tivals, while his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was <U+017F>ick. So all the
Shepherds bid him adieu till the next day, that they were all to meet again in the
<U+017F>ame place, for to relate their <U+017F>everal fortunes. In the return <hi>Carmelin</hi> drew his
Ma<U+017F>ter towards the place where it was <U+017F>aid <hi>Parthenice</hi> was. It was a piece of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
ground, where there grew nothing but weeds; and there was in the mid<U+017F>t, a
great <U+017F>tone, which was at lea<U+017F>t two farthoms <U+017F>quare: but as for the Shepherde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he
appear'd not any where. Give over thy <U+017F>earch <hi>Carmelin</hi> (<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> with a <U+017F>cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
<U+017F>ight, as if he had <U+017F>poken like a Prophet) thy <hi>Parthenice</hi> hath clearly chang'd
her nature: See<U+017F>t thou not, that the Gods willing to puni<U+017F>h her cruelty, have meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd
her into a <hi>Rock?</hi> That's not credible, Ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> <U+017F>he only
<U+017F>aid one poor word to me, whereat <hi>I</hi> took no offence What <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid to thee, was
full of malicious deri<U+017F>ion, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> when <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke to thee of wages, after thou
had<U+017F>t profer'd her thy <U+017F>ervice; <U+017F>he would <U+017F>hew thee that thou wert much below her,
and that <U+017F>he thought thee fit to be her <U+017F>erving-man, and not her <U+017F>ervant in Love.
Thou had<U+017F>t not the apprehen<U+017F>ion to make an<U+017F>wer to it: <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t not thou have <U+017F>aid
that thou de<U+017F>erved<U+017F>t no other wages then her favour? My minde was taken up in the
contemplation of her, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> and be<U+017F>ides, <hi>I</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <hi>I</hi> thought not that
that word touch'd me <U+017F>o much to the quick; and <hi>I</hi> am <U+017F>til to avow, that not finding it
any thing con<U+017F>iderable in compari<U+017F>on of the rigors of others, which <U+017F>ometimes la<U+017F>t
ten years, <hi>I</hi> cannot believe <U+017F>he hath been chang'd into a <U+017F>tone for <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Then it <U+017F>eems thou ha<U+017F>t not read <hi>Ovid. Carmelin,</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43725:107"/>
the one was chang'd into a <hi>Laurel,</hi> and the other into a <hi>Reed.</hi> You have read more
then I have, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> I am very glad to receive your in<U+017F>tructions, and in
amends I will tell you what comes into my mind. It's likely your Magician, of whom
I have heard wonders, hath promoted the Metamorpho<U+017F>is: but when I <U+017F>hall believe
it, what have I to do? Weep and <U+017F>igh night and day, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that's the <hi>di<U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
befits a Lover that hath lo<U+017F>t his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: And then my company will not be
tedious to thee, becau<U+017F>e if I complain of one <U+017F>ide, thou wilt of the other. For my
part, I <U+017F>hall ever <U+017F>peak of the <hi>Command without Command</hi> of <hi>Charite.</hi> And in the
mean time, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I <U+017F>hall never cea<U+017F>e <U+017F>peaking of the <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Metamorpho<U+017F>is</hi> of <hi>Parthenice.</hi> Thou do<U+017F>t imitate my language very unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>omly,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> 'Tis very true, <hi>Charite</hi> hath commanded me without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
me; but 'tis not the <U+017F>ame thing to <U+017F>ay, that the Gods have meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd
thy Shepherde<U+017F>s without metamorpho<U+017F>ing her: She is really chang'd, and
<U+017F>ee if that <U+017F>tone be not white as her complexion and cloaths. In a certain place at the
top, which <U+017F>hould be the head, <U+017F>ee<U+017F>t thou not certain marks which approach to red,
and others which come neer black? They are the places where her eyes and mouth
were: There are lower certain peeces which <U+017F>eem not to be well joyn'd together;
they are the arms, which are not at all fa<U+017F>tened to the bulk of the body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> con<U+017F>idered all this; and though he believed but the lea<U+017F>t part of it,
yet his Ma<U+017F>ter having told him, that before he leave the place he mu<U+017F>t do all honour
to that <U+017F>tone, he was forc'd to go and ki<U+017F>s it: But becau<U+017F>e <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thought he went
not to it with affection enough, he with much fiercene<U+017F>s <U+017F>truck his no<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t it.</p>
            <p>In their return to <hi>Bertrand's,</hi> the faithfull Lover of <hi>Charite</hi> cea<U+017F>ed not to think
of the la<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer of that fair one, which becau<U+017F>e of its ob<U+017F>curity <U+017F>eem'd to him an
oracle. But ob<U+017F>erving that <hi>Carmelin</hi> conducting the Flock went along with much
indifferencie, What! <U+017F>ays he to him, weepe<U+017F>t thou not, poor Lover? ha<U+017F>t thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

in the world? What would you have me do? replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> my eyes are
not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oft. Why do<U+017F>t thou not an<U+017F>wer me, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that tears are the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trations
of light griefs, of great ones a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment? I excu<U+017F>e thee if thou can<U+017F>t not
yet <U+017F>hew great te<U+017F>timonies of grief: To morrow it will be thy bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, when thou
<U+017F>halt begin to remember thy <U+017F>elf. Thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>een the actions of tho<U+017F>e amorous
Shepherds which we have met; thou mu<U+017F>t not be le<U+017F>s de<U+017F>perate then they, but

            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that he would ever think on things pre<U+017F>ent, and that on
the morrow he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee what he had to do. This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
till they came home, where they hous'd their poor <U+017F>heep, which were <U+017F>o tired

that he was <U+017F>ure that <hi>Fame</hi> was <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to render him <U+017F>till more glorious, that

the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons, and cau<U+017F>e<U+017F>t the fruits to ripen; but becau<U+017F>e thou

Why have not I the <U+017F>ame power, that I may never be di<U+017F>tant from the centre of my

that <hi>Carmelin</hi> was <U+017F>till a<U+017F>leep; <U+017F>o that jogging of him twice or thrice, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked

Do you not <U+017F>ee that I attentively li<U+017F>tened to you? Ah! fool, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> am

how thou had<U+017F>t thy mouth and no<U+017F>trils open? now you are in the right, replies
<hi>Carmelin;</hi> you are to imagine that I opened my mouth to give utterance to <U+017F>ome
good <U+017F>aying, and in the mean time you have made me lo<U+017F>e it, and it's now fled <U+017F>o far

But for thy part, who ha<U+017F>t all the rea<U+017F>on in the world to be afflicted, I do
not think fit thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t je<U+017F>t it away, if it be not to <U+017F>hew thou ha<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>t thy wits

ever <U+017F>peak <U+017F>omewhat like a di<U+017F>tracted man, and run thy head again<U+017F>t the wall, or the
bed-po<U+017F>ts. It <U+017F>hall be again<U+017F>t the pillow, if I do it at all; I believe one as good as
the other. That were indeed better then to do nothing at all, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> for there
the ceremony were <U+017F>till pre<U+017F>erved; but trouble not thy head any farther about it,
put on thy cloathes rather, and return to the place where thy Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd.
Thou wilt be more moved by the object of that new <hi>rock,</hi> then by any
thing now in thy memory; and I hope that my remon<U+017F>trances will then have more
influence on thee then they have now. Be<U+017F>ides that, I have <U+017F>ome extraordinary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s

            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in <U+017F>o <U+017F>aying, being gotten up, <hi>Carmelin</hi> was oblig'd to imitate him; <U+017F>o that
they were both in a manner ready together. They had de<U+017F>ign'd the performance of
<U+017F>o many things that day, that they thought not fit to carry the flock abroad with
them, but commended it to the charge of their Land-lords <U+017F>on. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being thus
freed of all care, would in the fir<U+017F>t place go and <U+017F>ee <hi>Clarimond.</hi> He found him in
his <U+017F>tudy writing. Truly friend, <U+017F>aies he to him, I am glad to <U+017F>ee thee <U+017F>o indu<U+017F>trious;
for it cannot be but among <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal things of thy compo<U+017F>ition, thou mu<U+017F>t
needs remember to be<U+017F>tow <U+017F>omewhat on my adventures. Do me the favour to read
to me what thou ha<U+017F>t already begun. <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who had not yet troubled his head
with writing any thing for him, de<U+017F>ired him to have a little patience, till what he
had done were <U+017F>omewhat more re<U+017F>in'd, if he would <U+017F>ee <U+017F>omewhat. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and having caus'd this Hi<U+017F>torian to lay down his pen, he told him he came to
de<U+017F>ire his company into the fields, that he might bear witne<U+017F>s of the noble<U+017F>t actions
in the world.</p>
            <p>By that time they had gone a pretty way, they were come to the place where was
the rock of <hi>Parthenice. Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Phyliris</hi> were there already: and the fir<U+017F>t thing
they did was to embrace the Shepherd, <U+017F>wearing to him they had had no re<U+017F>t in his
ab<U+017F>ence; and that they were gotten up two hours before day to <U+017F>eek him. Having
thank'd them for their good will, he told them of a de<U+017F>ign he had to erect a rural
Temple to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and that without je<U+017F>ting, that was the occa<U+017F>ion of his making
<U+017F>o much ha<U+017F>te thither. It would not be ami<U+017F>s to build it in this place, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond,</hi>
here's a great eaven <U+017F>tone that may well <U+017F>erve for the altar. <hi>Carmelin</hi> would haply
be again<U+017F>t that, <U+017F>aie <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> This <U+017F>tone hath <U+017F>ometimes been his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who ye<U+017F>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
for her cruelty was metamorphos'd: <hi>I</hi> doubt whether it were fit to put upon
it the victimes <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould offer to <hi>Charite.</hi> If it be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> it mu<U+017F>t not
be touch'd, there's no rea<U+017F>on one Divinity <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve another. But is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,
that this <U+017F>tone hath <U+017F>ometimes been a maid? <hi>I</hi> tell you no lye, replyed <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> put
but your hand on it, and you will finde <U+017F>ome reliques of heat. Whereupon <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
touch'd the <U+017F>tone, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> touching it al<U+017F>o; nay more then that, <U+017F>aies he,
feel it towards the brea<U+017F>t, and you will finde the heart beats <U+017F>till. The Shepherd
imagin'd all this; and <hi>Clarimond</hi> having put his hand on the place he <U+017F>hew'd him,
feign'd a great a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, and acknowledg'd he <U+017F>poke nought but what was true.
<hi>Fontenay</hi> putting in among them, would needs know who that Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was, and how
it hapned <U+017F>he was metamorphos'd. You are to know, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that you no <U+017F>oon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
appear'd ye<U+017F>terday with <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Parthenice,</hi> but <hi>Carmelin</hi> was touch'd with
the beauty of that Shepherde<U+017F>s. His pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was <U+017F>o violent, that it was no <U+017F>ooner
conceiv'd then di<U+017F>cover'd: <U+017F>o that he proffer'd his <U+017F>ervice to the fair one, but <U+017F>he
di<U+017F>dainfully refus'd it, and went along with you: you, as I believe, left her in this
place, but in<U+017F>tead of finding her here, we found this <U+017F>tone, into which the Gods have
chang'd her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fontenay</hi> admir'd the imagination of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for he knew well enough what was
become of that <hi>Parthenice,</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e called <hi>Synopa.</hi> Now here <hi>I</hi> think fit to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43725:109"/>
<U+017F>ome things, which happly have held the Reader in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence. I have purpo<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imitated tho<U+017F>e <hi>Romances,</hi> which bring divers per<U+017F>ons on the <U+017F>tage, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
whence they come, nor what they did before, but by little and little, <U+017F>o to
cau<U+017F>e the greater admiration. I have accordingly ob<U+017F>erv'd this order; and <hi>I</hi> have
brought you a <hi>Philiris,</hi> a <hi>Polidor,</hi> and a <hi>Meliantes,</hi> without telling you why they
<U+017F>eem'd to be <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and that with as much extravagance as ours: But for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ones <U+017F>atisfaction, <hi>I</hi> acquaint you, that they were three Gentlemen, intimate
friends of <hi>Hircans,</hi> who were brought to his hou<U+017F>e by <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who had been to
fetch them there, to pa<U+017F>s away certain days. They had been already acquainted
with the extravagancies of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> which had rais'd in them <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>ire of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant
conver<U+017F>ation, that they had di<U+017F>guis'd them<U+017F>elves as Shepherds, the ea<U+017F>ier to <U+017F>et
on him. They con<U+017F>idered with them<U+017F>elves, that men do often change cloathes for
a Dance or Play, and that they might as well act natural Pa<U+017F>torals, that <U+017F>hould far
exceed all the fictions in the world, yet <U+017F>hould be perform'd with little pains, and
le<U+017F>s charge. <hi>Hircan,</hi> who began to fall more in love with <hi>Lucida</hi> then <hi>Synopa,</hi> whom
he was weary of, had had <U+017F>ome quarrel with this former Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he was
re<U+017F>olved to leave him. Being come out along with her to meet <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> there was a
Coach attended him at a little di<U+017F>tance, whereinto <U+017F>he was di<U+017F>pos'd, to return to
her Aunt, who had been <U+017F>o ill a guardian of her Neece, that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>uffer'd her
to be drawn away to naughtine<U+017F>s. Her hou<U+017F>e was about five leagues thence, <U+017F>o that
'tis to be imagin'd <U+017F>he could not get there before midnight. <hi>Hircan</hi> was very glad
to be rid of her; becau<U+017F>e among other his friends, he that acted <hi>Polidor,</hi> being a
per<U+017F>on of a <U+017F>evere vertue, was ever quarrelling with him for his loo<U+017F>e life, and ever
per<U+017F>waded him to marry. Were there any woman in the world could engage his
thoughts that way, it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>he whom we <U+017F>hall name <hi>Lucida,</hi> though <U+017F>he had
another name. He had <U+017F>taid her in his Ca<U+017F>tle, under pretence of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing away the
time with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but it was indeed for to finde the means to entertain her when he
pleas'd. She was of an humor <U+017F>o familiar and compliant, that <U+017F>he freely remain'd
in tho<U+017F>e Lodgings he had a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd her; and if you will credit the <U+017F>tory, you may be
a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd that <U+017F>he carried her felf nothing indi<U+017F>creetly, though <U+017F>he were in a hou<U+017F>e
where there were <U+017F>o many men. The free open natures, <U+017F>uch as hers was, <U+017F>tand
out the longe<U+017F>t. Be<U+017F>ides which, the hope <U+017F>he had of having the company of <U+017F>ome
yong Gentlewomen thereabouts, and the Pa<U+017F>torals wherein <U+017F>he was to act <U+017F>ome
part, and which could not have been done without her, were <U+017F>ufficient to excu<U+017F>e
all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiris</hi> and <hi>Fontenay</hi> had therefore left her in the Ca<U+017F>tle, with others that were
up no earlier then <U+017F>he, de<U+017F>irous to make <U+017F>ome <U+017F>port with the imaginary Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho<U+017F>is
of <hi>Parthenice,</hi> whereof they had ju<U+017F>t then receiv'd an account of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> If
it be true, <U+017F>ays <hi>Philiris</hi> to him, that there is any heat in this <U+017F>tone, and that you feel
the motion of the heart 'tis an evident <U+017F>ign that <hi>Parthenice</hi> is alive within it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I <U+017F>hould think it fit there were hammers <U+017F>ent for to break it open, that <U+017F>o the
poor Shepherde<U+017F>s may get out. Take heed of that, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> thou under<U+017F>tande<U+017F>t
not what a <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is</hi> is: Do<U+017F>t thou think <hi>Parthenice</hi> is enclos'd in this <U+017F>tone, as if
<U+017F>he were in a <U+017F>heath, or rather in a <U+017F>epulchre? No <U+017F>uch matter, that were no true
Transformation, and the Gods would but deceive us. Learn then, that each part
of her body hath put on the form and the quality of a <U+017F>tone: So that if a man
<U+017F>hould touch the lea<U+017F>t corner of it, he <U+017F>hould hurt it, and haply the blood would
i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of her veins, which are vi<U+017F>ible enough in divers places.</p>
            <p>I mu<U+017F>t tell you, <U+017F>ays <hi>Philiris,</hi> that this is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily apprehen<U+017F>ible, that there
<U+017F>hould be life and blood in a <U+017F>tone; and yet to <U+017F>peak truth, and not to wrong you,
you are not the fir<U+017F>t that ever affirm'd <U+017F>uch a thing: but the Poets who have <U+017F>aid it,
have not <U+017F>hewn how it could be effected. Is it not <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>ay it is done by the
omnipotence of the Gods? replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Will not that <U+017F>atisfie tho<U+017F>e who will needs
have natural rea<U+017F>ons of miracles? All this is right, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> but it hinders
not but I may believe that <hi>Parthenice</hi> may by <U+017F>ome means or other be re<U+017F>tor'd to
her fir<U+017F>t form. And to prove what I <U+017F>ay, I can alledge, that there were <U+017F>ometimes
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43725:109"/>
as many <U+017F>tones that were chang'd into men, as there were men chang'd inro <U+017F>tones:
I take the word Man for both <U+017F>exes. To give you an in<U+017F>tance, have you not read
that <hi>Pygmalion's</hi> Statue was chang'd into a Woman, and that he enjoy'd her after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
I have, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but that <U+017F>tone which was chang'd into fle<U+017F>h had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a humane <U+017F>hape, that advanc'd the matter very much. Will you think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
that <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>end to <hi>Paris</hi> for a Statuary for to bring this Stone to the
figure of <hi>Parthenice?</hi> That's but to return to the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e we had before; here
will be a many blows and knocks given, which will make as many wounds; for there
is a <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive <U+017F>oul which is in this <U+017F>tone, which never was in that of <hi>Pygmalion's</hi> which
had never been a woman. I have not yet done with you, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> you
may remember that <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha</hi> being to re<U+017F>tore the world, ca<U+017F>t <U+017F>tones of
all <U+017F>orts and <U+017F>izes over their <U+017F>houlders, which pre<U+017F>ently became humane creatures.
A brave conceit indeed, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> if we have a mind to imitate tho<U+017F>e Re<U+017F>torers
of Nature, we mu<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>t this <U+017F>tone over our heads. Now to do that, there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
the <U+017F>trength of <hi>Hercules,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t we mu<U+017F>t be as <U+017F>trong as <hi>Turnus</hi> who
ca<U+017F>t as big a <U+017F>tone as this at <hi>Aenaeas: Carmelin</hi> hath not <U+017F>o much <U+017F>trength as tho<U+017F>e
ancient <hi>Hero's.</hi> If you do not believe that this <U+017F>tone may be transform'd, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> and that you will not con<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer the lea<U+017F>t knock of a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
it remains that <hi>Carmelin</hi> endeavour to <U+017F>often it. There are tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ay,
that Blood mollifies the Adamant; po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly it hath the <U+017F>ame effect on all <U+017F>orts of
<U+017F>tones: Let <hi>Carmelin</hi> give him<U+017F>elf a <U+017F>tab, that he may bleed on the <U+017F>tone. You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
not that it is only Goats blood that <U+017F>oftens <U+017F>tones, <U+017F>ays <hi>Philiris.</hi> Excu<U+017F>e me,
I think on't, replies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> but I <U+017F>ee no rea<U+017F>on but an A<U+017F>s may have the <U+017F>ame
vertue as the Goat; <U+017F>o that <hi>Carmelin,</hi> not mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing of the or the other, may not
fail to do what he de<U+017F>ires. Let us not laugh at the mi<U+017F>erable, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I <U+017F>ay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
je<U+017F>ting, that all we can well advi<U+017F>e <hi>Carmelin</hi> to, is, that to leave a te<U+017F>timony of
a tran<U+017F>cendent love, and to make his memory eternal, he would endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Gods, that they would di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of him by <U+017F>ome noble Metamorpho<U+017F>is.
Some, it may be, would coun<U+017F>el him to be chang'd into a <hi>Rock,</hi> <U+017F>o to participate
of the <U+017F>ame nature with his Mi<U+017F>tte<U+017F>s; but that were not convenient, for he hath
not been guilty of the like cruelty. Then to be chang'd into <U+017F>ome <hi>Tree,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
planted hereabouts might give an eternal umbrage to his incomparable <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
is not that which were convenient for him; for you <U+017F>ee this ground is <U+017F>o dry,
that it is not fit for Trees; be<U+017F>ides they are never well neer Rocks, which ever hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <U+017F>preading of their roots. But that which I <U+017F>hould think the mo<U+017F>t proper, is,
that he were chang'd into a <hi>Fountain;</hi> 'tis the ordinary transformation of for<U+017F>aken
per<U+017F>ons, and 'tis often <U+017F>een that water i<U+017F><U+017F>nes out of a rock: He <U+017F>hall perpetually
wa<U+017F>h the root of this, as if he had a de<U+017F>ign to <U+017F>often it; and running clo<U+017F>e by it, will
become the honour and delight of the whole Country: I will con<U+017F>ecrate the <U+017F>ource
to <U+017F>ome Divinity; and whoever drinks of it <U+017F>hall fall in love, by a <U+017F>trange miracle,
that <U+017F>hall cau<U+017F>e flames to i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of the water. <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>hould have been me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphos'd
ever <U+017F>ince I mention'd it; and if he di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e not him<U+017F>elf thereto, I <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>ay he hath neither courage nor affection. How were it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to <U+017F>atisfie all
your <U+017F>everal imaginations? (<U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin</hi> very angrily) I know not what belongs
to turning <hi>Fountain,</hi> nor am I of opinion there may be any great good done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
for I find no great advantage in the water, unle<U+017F>s it be for to wa<U+017F>h before meat.
I will not forbid thee the u<U+017F>e of wine, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I <U+017F>ee well thy thoughts run upon
the juice of the Vine: but do<U+017F>t thou not remember that the <hi>Aquatick Deities</hi> which
we <U+017F>aw one night, were richly furni<U+017F>hed with the provi<U+017F>ions of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus?</hi>
Thou <U+017F>halt lead <U+017F>uch another life; bethink thy <U+017F>elf if it be not plea<U+017F>ant. Thy water
<U+017F>hall be as clean as thy <U+017F>oul; the <hi>Nymphs</hi> and the <hi>Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> will come and bath
them<U+017F>elves in it, and it may be <hi>Charite</hi> <U+017F>hall be one of the fir<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o that thou <U+017F>halt
take infinite plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o many Beauties all naked, and in feeling them all over,
as thou mu<U+017F>t: I <U+017F>hall then be jealous of thee, and <U+017F>hall think thy condition better
then my own. But if thou art <U+017F>o high-minded, that thou wilt have none but humane
creatures to drink of thy waters, there <U+017F>hall be notice given to all <hi>Shepherds, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:43725:110"/>
and <hi>Goatherds,</hi> not to bring any of their Cattel thither to water. The<U+017F>e are
indeed very excellent propo<U+017F>itions, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but I have told you already that
I care not for the company of tho<U+017F>e people of the other world, I'll never come
among them again. Thou can<U+017F>t not receive any more hurt, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> for thou
<U+017F>halt be of the <U+017F>ame condition with them; and being an <hi>aquatick Demy-god,</hi> thou
wilt be far otherwi<U+017F>e re<U+017F>pected then when thou wert a poor mortal: Po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly thou
may<U+017F>t have <U+017F>ome authority over the re<U+017F>t; and as to what concerns Men, they <U+017F>hall
addre<U+017F>s their vows and <U+017F>acrifices to thee; and I, and all tho<U+017F>e whom thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>een
in this country, will adore thee. The<U+017F>e promi<U+017F>es are great, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> And
for to ta<U+017F>te them, though I know not what you <U+017F>peak to me of, and that it cannot
enter into my imagination that a man of fle<U+017F>h and bone as I am can become water,
I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you that I would gladly be one, if you can make me become <U+017F>o: For I
<U+017F>wear to you that I am extreamly curious; and I <U+017F>hall not much <U+017F>tand upon the
changing of my condition often, <U+017F>o that in the end I attain happine<U+017F>s: But I pray
tell me how I mu<U+017F>t carry my <U+017F>elf for to be what you de<U+017F>ire I <U+017F>hould, that I may
know whether the pains exceed not the plea<U+017F>ure. Thy obedience is commendable,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee thou art <U+017F>o mode<U+017F>t, I tell thee there are divers wayes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Fountain:</hi> 'Tis true, I find not in Antiquity any other way then that of
weeping abundantly; but it is to be conceiv'd that both the Gods &amp; men are become
more <U+017F>ubtile and ingenious <U+017F>ince that time; for among the modern <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es</hi>
we find that <hi>Synopa</hi> who was all ice, was melted into water by the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>Love;</hi> and
that <hi>Lucida</hi> who had the Drop<U+017F>ie, hath pi<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>o much, that it became a Source.
But all this is nothing proper for thee, <hi>Carmelin:</hi> For fir<U+017F>t thy di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition <U+017F>uffers
thee not to weep, and be<U+017F>ides thou art not ice, nor yet ha<U+017F>t thou the drop<U+017F>ie. We
mu<U+017F>t therefore find out <U+017F>ome other way. I have known <U+017F>ome men who by violent
exerci<U+017F>e <U+017F>weated <U+017F>o, that the water dropp'd down as if they had been Statues of
<U+017F>now expo<U+017F>ed to the <U+017F>un. Go thy ways <U+017F>omewhither, and play at <hi>Tennis</hi> or at
<hi>Football</hi> a whole day together, that may be a good means to accompli<U+017F>h thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>You come not neer the mark, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> why do you not rather bid
<hi>Carmelin</hi> go and get him the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e which the <hi>French</hi> call the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of <hi>Naples,</hi>
and the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> the <hi>French</hi> di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e? He might then go to <hi>Paris,</hi> and <U+017F>weat at
his plea<U+017F>ure, with <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e that force their Empirick bills upon all that pa<U+017F>s by;
and then you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee him better metamorphos'd into a Fountain then the fair <hi>Acis.</hi>
Let's not bu<U+017F>ie our thoughts with mi<U+017F>chief, I pray thee: <hi>Carmelin</hi> may be meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd
without making him<U+017F>elf infamous by any <U+017F>uch filthine<U+017F>s. If there be no
more requi<U+017F>ite then to <U+017F>weat extreamly, he need not make u<U+017F>e of any <U+017F>ordid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
but go to <U+017F>ome hone<U+017F>t Hot-hou<U+017F>es; but I will furni<U+017F>h him with <U+017F>o many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
that he <U+017F>hall have to choo<U+017F>e. The <hi>Alchimi<U+017F>ts</hi> extract water out of herbs,
flowers, roots, and divers other things which are more dry, by putting them into
the Alimbeck; it will not be ami<U+017F>s <U+017F>o to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of our mi<U+017F>erably amorous Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
that he may be di<U+017F>till'd. No <U+017F>uch matter, I thank you, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I do not
intend to be <U+017F>et afire behind, nor do I conceive any goodne<U+017F>s can proceed from all
your <U+017F>ubtilties. What is more, my mind is wholly perplex'd in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
though all my body were melted into water, as you would de<U+017F>ire it, there
would not be as much as would fill an hog<U+017F>head: For, mea<U+017F>ure me by a Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
proportion, you will find that I am but three foot about, and five foot high, all
which would not <U+017F>uffice to fill a Fountain-head, and continually <U+017F>upply a brook that
<U+017F>hould mea<U+017F>ure the diameter of this ground, or by crooked windings <U+017F>hould find a
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age into <hi>Morin,</hi> and thence into <hi>Marne,</hi> and thence into the <hi>Seine,</hi> and <U+017F>o into
the <hi>Ocean.</hi> There thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>poken very learnedly, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and be<U+017F>ides that thy
terms are excellent, thy rea<U+017F>on is miraculous. I know thou doubte<U+017F>t of <U+017F>omwhat,
it is a <U+017F>ign of ingenuity; for I have often heard it <U+017F>aid, that Doubt is the mother of
Philo<U+017F>ophy; and that becau<U+017F>e when one is doubtfull of any thing, he de<U+017F>ires to be
more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of it, and never leaves <U+017F>earching for it till he have found out what was
mo<U+017F>t hidden and <U+017F>ecret therein.</p>
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:43725:110"/>
            <p>I believe, that with a <U+017F>erious meditation, thou would<U+017F>t thy own <U+017F>elf comprehend
how tho<U+017F>e things I told thee may be effected; but I will <U+017F>horten to thee the path
of truth, <U+017F>o that thou <U+017F>halt touch it with thy finger. Take notice then, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Metamorpho<U+017F>es which the Gods bring about, the bodies are either
dilated or contracted: it is no more difficult to the <U+017F>upreme Powers to make a
thing greater, then to make it le<U+017F>s; and if it be certain, that <hi>Arachne</hi> was chang'd
into a Spider, and the Inhabitants of <hi>Licia</hi> into <hi>Frogs,</hi> it is as well po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that
<hi>Pi<U+017F>mires</hi> have been chang'd into <hi>men, Atlas</hi> into a <hi>Mountain,</hi> and <U+017F>ome others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Rivers. Ovid</hi> never omits to <U+017F>peak of this contraction and dilation, nor <U+017F>hould
he: but I know one <U+017F>ecret, which neither he nor any other ever thought on, which
yet if it be not known, a man cannot explain the Metamorpho<U+017F>es; and this is it,
when there is a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity a man <U+017F>hould be chang'd into <U+017F>omething greater then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
then the Gods cau<U+017F>e certain winds to enter into him, which <U+017F>well him up to the
proportion required; and when another is to be chang'd into <U+017F>ome little creature,
they infu<U+017F>e a certain drought into him, that con<U+017F>umes whatever is <U+017F>uperfluous: <U+017F>o
though they do <U+017F>ome miracles which appertain only to them<U+017F>elves, and whereof
there cannot likely any natural rea<U+017F>on be given; yet do they not hinder but the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
cau<U+017F>es may operate <U+017F>omewhat therein. I have been fain to <U+017F>earch the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> for to be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of this miracle, and who ever under<U+017F>tands it, may
take away the vail of his ignorance. By this thou art to under<U+017F>tand, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that
it is ea<U+017F>ie for the Gods to change thee into a fountain, and that thou maye<U+017F>t <U+017F>upply
water enough for that end, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>ome men who were of no greater corpulence, then
thou, have been chang'd into Rivers and Mountains. The Inhabitants of heaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for whatever is done here below; and though they could not make the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
of thy current, neither broad nor long, yet would they <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of thee that
thy waters about fifty paces from the <U+017F>ource, <U+017F>hould be receiv'd under ground, and
by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret conduits <U+017F>hould return to the place whence they came, that <U+017F>o thou
might<U+017F>t never dry up. That were nothing extraordinary, there are in the world
great Rivers, which finde them<U+017F>elves channells under ground, nay it is to be believ'd
that the <U+017F>ea it <U+017F>elf is <U+017F>wallow'd in Aby<U+017F><U+017F>es, that it may re<U+017F>tore the water it receiv'd,
that <U+017F>o the earth might not be dryed up. Further, to take things at the wor<U+017F>t, though
the Gods <U+017F>hould not do thee the favour which they have done to many others, and
allowing thee only <U+017F>o much water as thou art big; and <U+017F>hould leave thee in <U+017F>ome
ditch where thou might<U+017F>t be drunk up by bea<U+017F>ts, or haply chang'd to Vapour by
the attraction of the Sun beams, yet would I take a cour<U+017F>e thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t not lo<U+017F>e
any thing: For I would cau<U+017F>e thee to be taken up with pails, and thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t be
put into a ba<U+017F>in in <U+017F>ome rich cabinet. There would I have made an admirable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
whereof I will di<U+017F>cover the invention for thy <U+017F>ake. Thy water being in a
cy<U+017F>tem, rais'd up on high, <U+017F>hould fall by a <U+017F>mall channel upon a little mill, which
it <U+017F>hould turn, and thence <U+017F>hould fall into a Ba<U+017F>in that were under. Now the
mill <U+017F>hould at one end have a wheel, which <U+017F>hould turn another, and that another,
and that a beam, about which there <U+017F>hould be a pipe made wave-like, or rather like
a chevron, whereof one end being plac'd in the water, <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>till <U+017F>upply'd, and
cau<U+017F>e it by little and little to a<U+017F>cend, the upper part becoming the lowe<U+017F>t, and
then immediately a<U+017F>cending: Thus the water <U+017F>hould be pour'd, as it were into a
trough, whence it <U+017F>hould return into its fir<U+017F>t receptacle, and be continually <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<U+017F>o that it <U+017F>hould never fail. Now I would take order, that no body <U+017F>hould
drink of it, no not <U+017F>o much as the flyes; and thy water never dimini<U+017F>hing, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and returning, thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t be an artificial fountain, portative and eternal, a
thing was yet never <U+017F>een, and there were no <U+017F>peaking of thee without admiration,
all believing thee to be an enchantment. Be<U+017F>ides, I am to tell thee, that there were
no great quantity of water requir'd for this; for though thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t afford but a
pailful, I <U+017F>hould make it <U+017F>erve the turn, by making my engine the le<U+017F>s: but I doubt
not but thou wilt yield a great deal of water; for before thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t be meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd,
thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t put on half a dozen cloaks, and <U+017F>o many night gowns,
and all that will become liquid as well as thee. The cloathes are ever metamorphos'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43725:111"/>
with the body in <hi>Ovid</hi> (as I think I have told thee before) and as the tail of <hi>Ocy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioes</hi>
gown became a hor<U+017F>e tail; <U+017F>o the skirts and <U+017F>hreds of thy cloathes will melt
into <U+017F>treams.</p>
            <p>This then is the recompence you promis'd me for my <U+017F>ervices, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> if
I ever <U+017F>tand to it, I will here <U+017F>wear once for all, that you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>eek another <U+017F>ervant,
and I will finde another Ma<U+017F>ter. You will load me with more cloaks, then if I
were <U+017F>ome boy belonging to the guard. You will have me <U+017F>weat in Frying-pans;
you will enclo<U+017F>e me in Alimbecks; and at la<U+017F>t you will di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e me into Ba<U+017F>ins, and
make me pa<U+017F>s through Conduit-pipes, Mills and Troughs. Where to the Devil
runs your wit? <U+017F>hall I not be burn'd up, and beaten to pieces after all this? Let
me know at lea<U+017F>t, what I have done to de<U+017F>erve to be put thus to the Rack, Gibbet
and Pillory? Have I ma<U+017F><U+017F>acred my Father? Have I betray'd a City? Have I coyn'd
bad money? Am I an uncon<U+017F>cionable Seller, or an U<U+017F>urer? Thou art nothing of
all this, I confe<U+017F>s, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> nor are there any <U+017F>uch puni<U+017F>hments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for thee, as thou conceive<U+017F>t. When thy body <U+017F>hall be all reduc'd to water,
thou art no more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of any hurt, poor fool: There will be much gotten by
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing thee, thy members cannot be cru<U+017F>h'd, for thou can<U+017F>t <U+017F>lide away through
the lea<U+017F>t hole. That then in good earne<U+017F>t is your meaning, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> and
'tis wor<U+017F>e then before: Your will is I <U+017F>hould not be any thing but water; when I
am to eat, where will be my mouth? If any body come near me, where will be
my eyes for to <U+017F>ee him? And if he <U+017F>peak, where will be my ears to hear him? In
fine, where will be all my members to execute the ordinary offices for which God
hath ordain'd them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was ready to give him <U+017F>ome extravagant rea<U+017F>on
for his complaints; and I believe he would have per<U+017F>waded him, that after he were
chang'd into a fountain, the Gods might ea<U+017F>ily form him a body of <U+017F>ubtile vapors,
according to the doctrine which had been infus'd into him: for he remembred him
he had <U+017F>een <hi>Lucida</hi> and <hi>Synopa,</hi> who yet had bodies, though they were chang'd
into water. But upon this <hi>Philiris</hi> comes and <U+017F>ays, Di<U+017F>pute not any more, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
your difference is ea<U+017F>ily reconciled. 'Tis true, <hi>Carmelin</hi> hath rea<U+017F>on to be
metamorphos'd into a Fountain, but he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tay till the Gods out of their full
power ordain it <U+017F>o: That we mu<U+017F>t expect from them, and not cau<U+017F>e him to be melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into water by natural inventions; that were to tempt the Divinities, and draw
their indignation on us. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> acknowledg'd this con<U+017F>ideration to be very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
and was angry with him<U+017F>elf that he had not been the Author of it. So that
he promis'd <hi>Carmelin</hi> not to importune him any further as to his Metamorpho<U+017F>is.
His thoughts now returned to the Temple he had a de<U+017F>ign to build; <U+017F>o that truning
towards <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who <U+017F>tood amaz'd at his <U+017F>ubtil argumentations, he
ask'd them if they would a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him to begin his edifice. We are no Ma<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Fontenay;</hi> be<U+017F>ides, a <U+017F>umptuous Temple cannot be built in a moment, without
materials or tools. But after what manner would you have it? Alas! that I am
not an <hi>Amphion,</hi> that I might with the <U+017F>ound of my harp bring together all the
<U+017F>tones in this Countrey, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I would build an incomparable Temple: But
<U+017F>ince that's wanting, I mu<U+017F>t this day <U+017F>eek out divers workmen for to be employ'd in
it. To <U+017F>pare all that co<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> 'twere better you would content
your <U+017F>elf to dedicate your heart as a Temple to your Divinity. There you may be
the victim and the Prie<U+017F>t together. The fire of your love will there <U+017F>hine ever;
your <U+017F>ighs will <U+017F>erve for incen<U+017F>e, and your tears <U+017F>hall be the holy-water. That's
well imagined, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but it hinders not but I may be much taken with my
de<U+017F>ign. To an<U+017F>wer therefore the Shepherd <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who de<U+017F>ires the particulars
of it; I declare, That my Temple being built of the faire<U+017F>t marble can be found,
I will place upon the Altar, the picture of <hi>Charite,</hi> which was drawn by <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi>
with this written above it:
<q>
                  <hi>To THE</hi>
METAPHORICALL GODDESSE.</q>
This Propo<U+017F>ition is <U+017F>o much the more noble, becau<U+017F>e it is not common; and that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43725:111"/>
it may be judg'd whether my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es picture do not well de<U+017F>erve a Temple, let
the world <U+017F>ee and judge.</p>
            <p>In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he took out a Box out of his pocket, wherein was that picture en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo<U+017F>ed,
which he ever carried about him, though it were of a pretty bigne<U+017F>s. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris</hi>
and <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who had never <U+017F>een it before, admir'd the invention; and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
who had <U+017F>een it the fir<U+017F>t time he met <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> viewing it al<U+017F>o, found in it <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
he had not ob<U+017F>erv'd before. Methinks, <U+017F>aies he to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that where before
the brea<U+017F>t was repre<U+017F>ented by two <hi>balls of <U+017F>now,</hi> there are now two <hi>Globes,</hi> where may
be <U+017F>een the <hi>Aequator,</hi> with the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> and other circles. You are in the right,
replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is, An<U+017F>elme</hi> hath reform'd it <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>aw it, having <U+017F>ent for colours
to <hi>Colommiers;</hi> but this la<U+017F>t thing is of my own invention, and as time makes us
wi<U+017F>er: I have left the <U+017F>now for <hi>Charite</hi>'s neck, and <U+017F>ome places adjacent; and as
for her brea<U+017F>ts, I thought fit they <U+017F>hould be repre<U+017F>ented as two worlds, for to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the picture more delightful by the variety. It is certain your Ma<U+017F>ters the Poets
do ordinarily compare the <hi>brea<U+017F>ts</hi> of their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es to <hi>worlds,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> but
very impertinently. You are mi<U+017F>taken, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that if I
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd <hi>Charite</hi>'s brea<U+017F>t, I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf happier then any Emperor; for I
<U+017F>hould be ma<U+017F>ter of two worlds, whereas the greate<U+017F>t Emperor that ever was, could
never enjoy one. An excellent fancy indeed! <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> becau<U+017F>e the brea<U+017F>ts
are round, therefore they are worlds, Apples and plums, and all things that are
round are wordls too. 'Tis a very <U+017F>lender re<U+017F>emblance of a thing, to have nothing
of it but the <U+017F>imple figure; but yet in this ca<U+017F>e you cannot make good all you <U+017F>ay,
The brea<U+017F>t of a woman hath but two half bowls, they mu<U+017F>t be put together to
make one whole one; <U+017F>o that you are <U+017F>till <U+017F>hort of your reck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning; for you can
finde but one world, which is divided into two, as the Co<U+017F>mographers repre<U+017F>ent
it in their univer<U+017F>al Maps: And I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that it was a far neater invention
of tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ay, That <hi>Venus</hi> having obtained of <hi>Paris</hi> the Apple, which was to be
given the faire<U+017F>t of the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o taken with it, that having cut it in
two, <U+017F>he plac'd it on her brea<U+017F>t, and wore it for an eternal <U+017F>ign of her victory, and
will'd all tho<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>ex <U+017F>hould do the like. However, if you de<U+017F>ire that <hi>Charite's</hi>
brea<U+017F>t have two Globes, <hi>I</hi> grant it you; and <hi>I</hi> will in that <U+017F>en<U+017F>e too teach you an
imagination which you never knew; and that is to <U+017F>ay, that half of each Globe is
<U+017F>unk into the body, and that there is only what remains apparent; and as for the
<hi>nibbles,</hi> it mu<U+017F>t be believ'd they are the <hi>Poles.</hi> Moreover, to render the picture more
judicious and rational, it <U+017F>hould be my advice to feign that one is a <hi>Terre<U+017F>trial</hi>
Globe, and the other the <hi>Cele<U+017F>tial;</hi> but though we <U+017F>hould grant all that, yet will
there be <U+017F>till <U+017F>omewhat to be reprehended; for if they be worlds, they mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>arily
have Suns to enlighten them, and it cannot be perceiv'd they have any, if we
do not <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the eyes; but they are at too great a di<U+017F>tance: But if you would
take them for two Suns, how can you imagine it, <U+017F>ince you call <hi>Charite</hi> a Sun, that
carries them about? One great <U+017F>tar therefore carries two little ones, and that al<U+017F>o
contains two worlds. Thus are all things confu<U+017F>ed among the Poets; and to hope
any <U+017F>atisfaction from their impertinent imaginations were the vaine<U+017F>t thing in the
world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having heard all this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, with an extream impatience; very angerly
an<U+017F>wered thus, I <U+017F>hould never have believed <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that thou had<U+017F>t <U+017F>o little
judgement as thou make<U+017F>t appear. Thou can<U+017F>t carp at the excellent de<U+017F>criptions of
Beauty us'd by Poets, and can<U+017F>t not believe that one Planet may carry others, and
worlds be<U+017F>ides. It <U+017F>hews thou knowe<U+017F>t little in <hi>A<U+017F>trologie,</hi> and ha<U+017F>t no great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the opinions of tho<U+017F>e Philo<U+017F>ophers, who hold there are worlds in
the Moon and Stars. Be<U+017F>ides, do<U+017F>t thou think it improper, that the eyes be the
<U+017F>uns of the brea<U+017F>t? do<U+017F>t thou think they are too remote, <U+017F>eeing they are fa<U+017F>tned in
the face as in their heaven, and that the two Globes which are under repre<U+017F>ent the
earth? Thou wilt haply tell me, there is no need of two Suns <U+017F>o near one the other.
But though there were but one world, yet were there no inconvenience; for I will
prove it to thee, that this great world wherein we all live, is not content with one;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43725:112"/>
and that this is true, look into all the <hi>Poets,</hi> both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> thou wilt finde
that when they <U+017F>peak of a man, that hath travelled about the earth, they <U+017F>ay that
he hath <U+017F>een the one and the other <U+017F>un. And this is it hath made me conceive there
are two <U+017F>uns in the world. But the greate<U+017F>t te<U+017F>timony in this ca<U+017F>e is, that it is held
for certain, that there are <hi>Antipodes;</hi> and if there be, they mu<U+017F>t have their Sun as
well as we ours. I remember, that being at St. <hi>Cloud, An<U+017F>elme</hi> laught at me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
I <U+017F>aid the Sun was going to <U+017F>leep in the waters; if I had then known what I
have imagined <U+017F>ince upon reading the ver<U+017F>es of a certain Poet, I had an<U+017F>wer'd him
to the purpo<U+017F>e. He asked me how it wos po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that the Sun <U+017F>hould pa<U+017F>s away
the night in the <U+017F>ea, in banquetting and taking his re<U+017F>t, and yet be <U+017F>een the next
morning in another end of the world, as if he had travell'd all the time. But now
I am a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd that there are two Suns which enlighten us one after another, and while
one <U+017F>leeps, the other perfects his carreer. I will not trouble my <U+017F>elf here to make
you any demon<U+017F>trations; I mu<U+017F>t then have had the compa<U+017F>s and rule. Finde your
<U+017F>elf out the rea<U+017F>on of what I tell you, when you are be<U+017F>t at lei<U+017F>ure. Then for the
<U+017F>everal faces of the Moon, whereof I might be demanded an account; I profe<U+017F>s to
you, that I under<U+017F>tand nothing of the<U+017F>e divers a<U+017F>pects of the Moon, wherewith I
have been <U+017F>o often entertained, I therefore believe there are three or four Moons in
the world; for otherwi<U+017F>e, how were it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee it <U+017F>ometimes round,
and <U+017F>ometimes cut in two. It is to be conceiv'd, that the full Moon and half Moon
are two <U+017F>everal Stars.</p>
            <p>Such excellent conceptions as yours, are worthy to be admir'd, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond;</hi>
I confe<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf overcome, and yet I cannot but <U+017F>ay, that let things be taken which
way you will, the little worlds of <hi>Charit</hi>'s brea<U+017F>ts, have no need of Suns, <U+017F>ince they
can have no other inhabitants then fleas. Thou <U+017F>peake<U+017F>t injuriou<U+017F>ly, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi>
tho<U+017F>e worlds are peopl'd with <hi>Cupids</hi> and <hi>Graces.</hi> I would gladly know what <U+017F>ort of

to communicate them to all that come near you. You talk of nothing but
<hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es;</hi> and you would make <hi>Carmelin</hi> and the other Shepherds of your
acquaintance, believe, that a man may be metamorphos'd into a Fountain, a Stone,
a Tree, a Bird, and divers other forms. <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t purge your brains of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trange

In the fir<U+017F>t place, for what concerns the <hi>Aquatick Metamorpho<U+017F>is:</hi> There was
<U+017F>ometimes in <hi>Arcadia</hi> the <U+017F>on of a great Lord, who fell into a fountain and was
drown'd in't, his friends were extreamly di<U+017F>comforted at it: But there was a <hi>Poet,</hi>
who to comfort them, and get a little money from them, made <U+017F>ome ver<U+017F>es, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he feign'd that the Gods had taken away that childe from among<U+017F>t men, for to
prefer him to a happier condition, and that they had metamorphos'd him into a
divine and <U+017F>acred <hi>Fountain.</hi> That was afterward by the <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious people taken
for truth. A while after that, a certain man whom <U+017F>ome theeves had kill'd, having
been buried in a field, there grew out by chance a <hi>flower</hi> out of the earth,
wherewith they had covered his body; <U+017F>o that it was believ'd, with much appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that it was a <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is,</hi> which the Gods had made of him. Another
having been <U+017F>hot through with arrows in the wars, was negligently cover'd with
earth, the <U+017F>hafts not taken out of his body, and being of a green and <U+017F>oon grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wood, they ea<U+017F>ily took root, and ca<U+017F>t out branches; <U+017F>o that it was given out,
that that body was chang'd into a <hi>Tree.</hi> There were a <U+017F>ort of Countrey people,
who reported the <U+017F>ame thing of another dead man, whom they had buried at the
foot of an Elm, in<U+017F>tead of a dog, for to make it bud forth. A certain traveller
going along the fields, a piece of a mountain fell on him, and cover'd him <U+017F>o that
he was never <U+017F>een after. Tho<U+017F>e who knew which way he was gone, not meeting
with him, but finding in<U+017F>tead a little mountain hard by the greatone, imagin'd the
Gods had be<U+017F>towed that form on him.</p>
            <p>As concerning tho<U+017F>e whom men have thought to have been chang'd into <U+017F>avage
creatures, they were onely <U+017F>ome people, who had cover'd them<U+017F>elves with wolf
skins, for to be thought wolves; or had put on Lyons skins, or any other bea<U+017F>t, for
to run about frightning little children, and exerci<U+017F>ing divers cruelties.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es</hi> of men into <hi>Birds,</hi> though it cannot be <U+017F>aid it was
effected by a like di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ing, becau<U+017F>e there is hardly any bird that hath not the body
le<U+017F>s then a mans, yet it hinders not but the rea<U+017F>on thereof may be found out; and
to that purpo<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hall give you an example, as plea<U+017F>ant as true: There was <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
in the Province of <hi>Greece</hi> a <U+017F>ubtle and mi<U+017F>chievous fellow, called in his language
<hi>Raven,</hi> who having committed a many Felonies and Adulteries, was furiou<U+017F>ly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecuted
by the Magi<U+017F>trates of the place. The Con<U+017F>tables having perceived him afar
off in a field, made as fa<U+017F>t as they could after him; but he was <U+017F>o well footed, that
he recovered a little thicket, and being got out of that, he was pre<U+017F>ently by a rivers
<U+017F>ide, into which he re<U+017F>olv'd to ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf for his <U+017F>afety: he immediately put off
his cloathes, and got into the deepe<U+017F>t of the water, where he might hold out long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t,
for he was one of the be<U+017F>t Divers in the world. The Con<U+017F>tables being come
to the Rivers <U+017F>ide, found nothing but his cloathes, on which by chance a great black
<hi>Bird</hi> was roo<U+017F>ted: They came nearer by little and little, and imagin'd, that he whom
they came to take, as he was capable of doing all <U+017F>ort of mi<U+017F>chief, <U+017F>o was he as well
a Magician as a Thief, and that by his charms he had chang'd his fir<U+017F>t body into that
of a Bird; for otherwi<U+017F>e they could not conceive in what manner he <U+017F>hould come
to di<U+017F>appear. But the bird having expected them <U+017F>ome time, and looking on them
very fixtly, as if he had defy'd them, fled away when they were come within ten
paces of it; and 'twas then in vain to think to <U+017F>hoot at it, or by running hither and
thither, to get any tidings of it. They never could learn any thing of certain of it;
<U+017F>o that they were forc'd to return into their City, for to tell the Judges, how that
the Felon was metamorphos'd. Since that time, the Bird whereof he was thought
to have taken the form, was from his name called <hi>Raven;</hi> and if that Bird be <U+017F>een
much about Gallow's, and places of Execution, to feed on carca<U+017F>es, people would
<U+017F>ay, that the Gods, the ju<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hers of crimes, did ordain, that notwith<U+017F>tanding
the change of his nature, yet would he ever be about the place where he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd
to end his life, and that he could not live but he mu<U+017F>t feed on tho<U+017F>e like him.
As for the Thief, after he had continued <U+017F>ome time in the water, he thought that
tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ought after him were far enough, but coming to the <U+017F>hore, he found no
cloathes; for one of the Officers had taken them away, both becau<U+017F>e there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43725:113"/>
el<U+017F>e to be gotten, as al<U+017F>o that he might <U+017F>hew them all the world for a miracle.
This wretch being <U+017F>tark naked, cro<U+017F>s'd the River; and when he was come to the
other <U+017F>ide, he kept him<U+017F>elf clo<U+017F>e in a Wood, where for <U+017F>ome time he lived like a
<U+017F>avage, and at length he betook him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ome Faggot-men that us'd there, and
pa<U+017F>s'd over the re<U+017F>t of his dayes unknown, being very glad whenever he heard any
one <U+017F>ay that he was not reckoned among<U+017F>t mankind.</p>
            <p>The metamorpho<U+017F>is which was imagin'd to have happen'd to him, was, to <U+017F>ay
truth, very excellent, and without any relation to the others; for there was no need
of his cloaths to bring it about, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> believ'd that he put them off for his
more ea<U+017F>ie transformation. On the contrary, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is, Ovid,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the <hi>Poets</hi>
will not have the cloaths exempted from the metamorpho<U+017F>is: If they change a man
into any creature, whether his Breeches be of cloth or of <U+017F>atten, it mu<U+017F>t be de<U+017F>ign'd
for hair or feathers; and if they transform an <hi>Italian</hi> woman into a Bird, the great
<U+017F>leeves of her <hi>Loo<U+017F>e-gown</hi> would <U+017F>erve to make her wings; and as for a Southern
woman with her little <hi>Furr'd-cloak,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould become a Winter-Crow. Were I
<U+017F>o minded, I could thus find the original of many Metamorpho<U+017F>es; but 'tis not to
be conceiv'd there is any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of it. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> is more then half converted: He mu<U+017F>t
now <U+017F>hake hands with the error he hath been <U+017F>o long in, otherwi<U+017F>e it is a great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
he may <U+017F>ome time or other die of hunger or thir<U+017F>t: for he imagining that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever
he <U+017F>aw on the earth had <U+017F>ometimes been men, he would not pre<U+017F>ume <U+017F>o much
as to drink water, left it might be blood; nor dare eat of any birds, or bea<U+017F>ts, or
fruit, out of a fear he might be at the buttocks of <U+017F>ome of his kinred.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Clarimond</hi> ended his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: but that it was not <U+017F>horter, was not <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s
fault; for not being able to hear him talk after that manner, he was ready to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
him at every word, and had done it, had not the Shepherd <hi>Philiris</hi> impo<U+017F>ed
<U+017F>ilence on him as <U+017F>oon as he would have open'd his mouth. However in the end he
an<U+017F>wer'd as followeth. Stupid <hi>Clarimond!</hi> I am now at a lo<U+017F>s what e<U+017F>teem I <U+017F>hould
have of thee, <U+017F>ince thou <U+017F>till continue<U+017F>t thy abu<U+017F>ing of <U+017F>acred my<U+017F>teries, and can<U+017F>t
not credit things that are mo<U+017F>t true. Thou wilt not believe there can be any <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morpho<U+017F>es,</hi>
and yet 'tis not long <U+017F>ince thou <U+017F>awe<U+017F>t me chang'd into a Tree, and be<U+017F>ides
thou ha<U+017F>t heard the Hi<U+017F>tories of the <hi>Hamadryads</hi> and <hi>Fountain-Nymphs</hi> of this

I tell you once more, that you were no more chang'd into a Tree then I

I am too peaceable a man. <hi>Fontenay,</hi> do you maintain to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> <U+017F>ays
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that I was chang'd into a Tree; and bear witne<U+017F>s of it al<U+017F>o to <hi>Philiris</hi> and
the re<U+017F>t lately come hither, that they may not take me for an Impo<U+017F>tor. I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s but by the relation I had of it, replies <hi>Fontenay;</hi> I was not in
this Country when this adventure happened, I was gone to a little Town whence I
returned but ye<U+017F>terday. But I mu<U+017F>t tell you by the way, that there are many that
hold the <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es</hi> for <hi>fictions,</hi> and do not believe there are any <hi>Divinities</hi> in
the <hi>woods</hi> or <hi>waters.</hi> For my part, I have <U+017F>ometime believed that there were, and
now I know not whether I ought to continue in the <U+017F>ame opinion. But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
I was not per<U+017F>waded of any thing <U+017F>o much, as that there were <hi>Nayads:</hi>
And if you plea<U+017F>e, I'll tell you for what rea<U+017F>on I was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd with that imagination.
I <U+017F>hall hearken to you very willingly, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly there may be <U+017F>omwhat

double your <U+017F>atisfaction; for together with it you <U+017F>hall have the re<U+017F>t of my life.
That's it <hi>I</hi> de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ee every one prepares him<U+017F>elf to

                        <p>YOU are then to know, dear Company! <U+017F>ays <hi>Fontenay,</hi> That the Sun had
not fourteen times mea<U+017F>ur'd the compa<U+017F>s of the Zodiack after <hi>I</hi> was born,
when in the mo<U+017F>t inten<U+017F>e heat of the Summer there <U+017F>eiz'd on me a de<U+017F>ire
to wa<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elf in the River <hi>Marne,</hi> which was within a league of my hou<U+017F>e.
<hi>I</hi> would needs one evening make experience of that plea<U+017F>ure <hi>I</hi> had before never
ta<U+017F>ted: but in <U+017F>tead of being refre<U+017F>h'd and cool'd, <hi>I</hi> was the more enflam'd. <hi>I</hi>
was no <U+017F>ooner gotten up to the reins in the water, but <hi>I</hi> perceiv'd a Maid who
was al<U+017F>o wa<U+017F>hing her<U+017F>elf; and being de<U+017F>irous to embrace her, <U+017F>he got away <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
into an i<U+017F>le where <U+017F>he hid her<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>o that <hi>I</hi> could find her no more.
<hi>I</hi> had <U+017F>o much fear to be drowned, that <hi>I</hi> dur<U+017F>t not advance <U+017F>o far; <U+017F>o that this
lo<U+017F>s was a great affliction to me. <hi>I</hi> look'd all about to <U+017F>ee for <U+017F>ome Boat where
the fair one might haply have got in, but there was none; or if there were, it
mu<U+017F>t be the other <U+017F>ide of the i<U+017F>le. That made me believe that <U+017F>he <hi>I</hi> had
<U+017F>een was no mortal creature; and calling to mind the different <hi>Divinities</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>I</hi> heard my Preceptors talk, <hi>I</hi> imagin'd it was a <hi>Nayad,</hi> <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd to me
to <U+017F>wim as well as any Fi<U+017F>h. Now though <hi>I</hi> had not ob<U+017F>eved the features of her
countenance, yet was <hi>I</hi> ea<U+017F>ily induc'd to conceive that <U+017F>he was extreamly fair;
and that kindled in my heart a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which <hi>I</hi> thought <U+017F>hould never be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>h'd.
When <hi>I</hi> had put on my cloaths again, all my comfort was to lie down
on the Rivers <U+017F>ide, and to <U+017F>hed abundance of tears to encrea<U+017F>e the waters of my
Nymph. The Stars were now ready to fall on the other Hemi<U+017F>phere, and Night
by little and little drew her curtains wherewith <U+017F>he had hidden the face of heaven,
when it came into my mind that there liv'd neer this place a <hi>Magician</hi> of whom
<hi>I</hi> might hope <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>I</hi> could receive any. All the
Shepherds in our quarters or neer us, were charg'd to look to their <U+017F>heep when
they <U+017F>hould ca<U+017F>t their lambs, for to fley them and bring their skins to him to make
<hi>virgin-parchment:</hi> the Midwives al<U+017F>o were in like manner very careful to pre<U+017F>erve
tho<U+017F>e thin Cawls wherewith there are <U+017F>ome children born: The Falconers, who
made in other Countries all Birds their game, dur<U+017F>t meddle with nothing but
Dormice and <U+017F>ome other unlucky birds; and all this for to provide materials for
the enchantments of <hi>Zenocritus,</hi> that was the name of this Magician. <hi>I</hi> heard <U+017F>ay
that he would pull the Gods out of their thrones, and that he broke open hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
and that he <U+017F>ent back Rivers to the <U+017F>ources, to the great a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hement of
their banks. Be<U+017F>ides it was reported, that all the riches he had in the world was
an Angel in gold; but that it was <U+017F>o enchanted, that when he had given it a
Trade<U+017F>man for <U+017F>ome commodity, it ever came back again into his pur<U+017F>e, a place
it <U+017F>eems it affected better then any where el<U+017F>e. 'Twas al<U+017F>o believ'd for certain,
that if he took a gimlet and pierc'd one of the Po<U+017F>ts of a Table, he would make
wine come forth; and if they went afterwards into the Merchants Cellar, they
found the Pipe which had lo<U+017F>t it, for he by his magick would cau<U+017F>e the wine to be
tran<U+017F>ported to his hou<U+017F>e. For what concerns the curing of di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, in that point
he defied all Phy<U+017F>itians; and whenever he cured any of his friends, he tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es into his enemies, that <U+017F>o he might not entrench upon Fate,
who<U+017F>e ordinance it was there <U+017F>hould ever be <U+017F>omebody <U+017F>ick. 'Tis true, <hi>I</hi> was not
de<U+017F>irous to be fully cured of my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; <hi>I</hi> took <U+017F>uch delight in it, that <hi>I</hi> was
content only to be a little eas'd. <hi>I</hi> went therefore and knock'd at this Magicians
door before day; and he, who was already at his <U+017F>tudy, came pre<U+017F>ently to the
door. It was an old man who<U+017F>e beard was of <U+017F>uch a length, that be<U+017F>ides that part
he had left in the middle, he had twi<U+017F>ted what was on both <U+017F>ides, and it <U+017F>erved
him for a girdle. That was a thing <U+017F>trange enough to <U+017F>ee: but <hi>I</hi> was much more
amaz'd when <hi>I</hi> ob<U+017F>erv'd that he had <U+017F>o many wrinkles on his face, whereof <U+017F>ome
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43725:114"/>
were in direct lines, and others in oblique, that they <U+017F>eem'd as <U+017F>o many magical
characters that time had drawn there, to make him ma<U+017F>ter of life and death.
A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he had bidden me good morrow, I <U+017F>hook as a reed on the brink of a
lake, at the <U+017F>ound of his whizzing voice, which <U+017F>eem'd to i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of hell through
<U+017F>ome aby<U+017F>s. But at length he <U+017F>poke more mildly to me, and re<U+017F>tor'd me bidding
me not fear at all, becau<U+017F>e I was <U+017F>o much in favour with heaven, that I <U+017F>hould find
the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance I look'd for; and that he well <U+017F>aw that what I ailed was nothing
more then ordinary to Youth, that is to <U+017F>ay, the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of Love, forwhich he
was <U+017F>tor'd with all <U+017F>orts of remedies. How well have you already ghe<U+017F>s'd! an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer'd
I: 'Tis true, I am in Love, but 'tis not with a mortal creature, but a
<hi>Nayad</hi> I <U+017F>aw ye<U+017F>terday in the River, but cannot <U+017F>ince recover the <U+017F>ight of, though
I waited till now: Do me but the favour that I may <U+017F>ee her once more before I
die, and I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>o recompence you, that you will re<U+017F>t as well <U+017F>atisfied as I.
<hi>Zenocritus</hi> promis'd me to do what I de<U+017F>ired; and having brought me into a dark
chamber, he put off my cloaths, and put them on again, mumbling over certain
barbarous words. Thence he led me into his Court; where when he had made a
circle, and lighted three candles about it, he ca<U+017F>t a vail over my head, and read a
while in his Conjuring-book. This done, he took me by the hand, and made me
go a great way vail'd as I was; then having made me kneel, he took the vail off
my head, and told me I was where I de<U+017F>ired to be, and that it was in my power to
remain two hours before my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. Upon that he left me, as being unwilling
to be a witne<U+017F>s of my amorous thefts: But the enchantments pa<U+017F>s'd had made
me <U+017F>o <U+017F>tupid, that it was a good while ere I remembred me that I was on the
<hi>Marne</hi> <U+017F>ide. As I ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>ight on the waters, which were very clear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
I <U+017F>aw in them a Nymph, the faire<U+017F>t could be imagin'd: <U+017F>he had on her
head a dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing of cloth of <U+017F>ilver, with <U+017F>mall purl-work, and a blew gown. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
conceiv'd it was my <hi>Nayad,</hi> and that I <U+017F>hould make u<U+017F>e of the opportunity
to gain her favours, <U+017F>ince the charms of <hi>Zenocritus</hi> had come to <U+017F>o good effect.
Fair <hi>Nayad!</hi> <U+017F>aid I to her in an extreme tran<U+017F>portation: <hi>I</hi> confe<U+017F>s mode<U+017F>ty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
you to appear <U+017F>o clad to the eys of men; yet <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t tell you, <hi>I</hi> would rather
have <U+017F>een you naked, as <hi>I</hi> did la<U+017F>t night; for it being now broad day, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould
have been incredibly <U+017F>atisfied in con<U+017F>idering you all over: Since the honour of
beauty con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in nothing <U+017F>o much as to be <U+017F>een, why are you <U+017F>o carefull to hide
your <U+017F>elf? Thus did <hi>I</hi> entertain her, thinking <U+017F>he would <U+017F>peak to me: but <U+017F>he
an<U+017F>wer'd me not at all, and was only content to look on me with langui<U+017F>hing
eyes. <hi>I</hi> perceiv'd her lips move, but her voice reach'd not my ears, <U+017F>o that <hi>I</hi>
thought it might be the water hinder'd it. That made me <U+017F>ay to her, Come out
of the water, my fair Sun! behold the great Sun of the world comes out too:
Come and enlighten our earth, where all men <U+017F>hall adore you: Come give me
your hand, that <hi>I</hi> may help you to get out. In <U+017F>o <U+017F>aying <hi>I</hi> ki<U+017F>s'd my right hand
and pre<U+017F>ented it to her: At the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>he ki<U+017F>s'd her left hand and pre<U+017F>ented
it to me, as if <U+017F>he had been de<U+017F>irous to come to me; but though my fingers
<U+017F>eem'd to be very neer hers, yet could I not touch them: which making me half
de<U+017F>perate, I fell to beating my brea<U+017F>t. The Nymph did the like for to <U+017F>ympathize
with my grief; whereat I was <U+017F>o troubled, that it <U+017F>et me a weeping, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
<U+017F>he wept too. You <U+017F>uffer too much, <U+017F>aid I then; 'tis nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary I come
to you, my fair one, <U+017F>ince you cannot come to me. And in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o I ca<U+017F>t my
<U+017F>elf into the water, which being <U+017F>hallow, I was not <U+017F>o high as my middle: but
there being nothing but <U+017F>and and gravel whereever I laid my hands, I came out
again pre<U+017F>ently; looking afterward into the water, which was all muddy, I could
<U+017F>ee my <hi>Nayad</hi> no more: who<U+017F>e lo<U+017F>s I <U+017F>o much regretted, that I laid me along on
the ground as if I had been ready to die. At length my grief being <U+017F>omewhat
abated, and my mind not being taken up with viewing the waters, I look'd ore
my <U+017F>elf. O Gods! <U+017F>hall I tell all! I perceiv'd that I had womans cloaths on, and
having put my hand on my head, found I had a dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing on like that of the <hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads.</hi>
By that I di<U+017F>cover'd the cheat of <hi>Zenocritus</hi>'s enchantments, and I had
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43725:114"/>
rea<U+017F>on to doubt that the face I had <U+017F>o much admir'd was my own, which being
di<U+017F>guis'd I had mi<U+017F>taken. Thereupon I return'd to the river, le<U+017F>s <U+017F>ad then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and there perceiving the <U+017F>ame figure, I <U+017F>poke thus, There's none but will
confe<U+017F>s that this face is hand<U+017F>ome; and for my own part, I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf
happy, could I finde a Wench that had one <U+017F>o fair. I would to God it were <U+017F>o!
But why do I de<U+017F>ire it, is there any thing more plea<U+017F>ant then to be Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s and
Servant together? I <U+017F>hall when I plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ee the beauty which hath <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed me.
If I <U+017F>igh, it will <U+017F>igh too; if I laugh, it will laugh al<U+017F>o; if I de<U+017F>ire any favour,
it will be as <U+017F>oon obtain'd as de<U+017F>ired; if I give my Nymph any thing, there will
be nothing at all lo<U+017F>t, for I <U+017F>hall give all to my <U+017F>elf; if I be<U+017F>tow my endeavors
to pre<U+017F>erve her, I <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>erve my <U+017F>elf with her. I <U+017F>hall not fear <U+017F>he will betray
me, for <U+017F>he will never be guilty of any thoughts which I <U+017F>hall not know, and
jealou<U+017F>ie, which po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>o many Lovers, will exerci<U+017F>e no tyranny over me. I
<U+017F>ee many others much troubled that they have Rivals; but for me to have any.
I <U+017F>hall account it a huge plea<U+017F>ure: <U+017F>o nothing being able to bring me any di<U+017F>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in my love, I <U+017F>hall ever live fully <U+017F>atisfied. And if it be objected, that I
trangre<U+017F>s the ordinary Laws of men, I will <U+017F>ay, that the faire<U+017F>t bird of natures
making, which is the Phoenix, is content to love him<U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>eeks no further
object for his affection. After this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I paus'd a good while, and as I
was bu<U+017F>ied in viewing my own fair countenance, <hi>Zenocritus</hi> comes and askes me,
Whether I had not <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>een my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s? and if I would not return to his
hou<U+017F>e? I am fully <U+017F>atisfied as to her <U+017F>ight, <U+017F>aid I to him; but I would al<U+017F>o have
been glad to have heard her <U+017F>peak, I have not yet been able to make her break
her <U+017F>ilence. Ask her <U+017F>omewhat, <U+017F>aies he, no doubt but <U+017F>he'll an<U+017F>wer you. I
had the curio<U+017F>ity to try his skill; <U+017F>o turning towards the water, Fair Nymph,
<U+017F>aid I, may I be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd that you will have a memory for the mo<U+017F>t perfect Lover
that lives? Then I heard a feeble voice, which <U+017F>eem'd to come from a league
off me; which <U+017F>aid to me, A<U+017F><U+017F>ure thy <U+017F>elf, that the <U+017F>ame arrow as hath wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thy heart, hath wounded mine al<U+017F>o. I was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at this, that I became
as in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible as a <U+017F>tock. <hi>Zenocritus</hi> put the vail again over my head, and a<U+017F><U+017F>uring
me that his charm was at an end, he led me back to his hou<U+017F>e, I not <U+017F>aying any
thing in the world to him. I could not come certainly to know, whether it were
a Nymph I had <U+017F>een, or my own repre<U+017F>entation only; the cloathes I had on
made me <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect the cheat, but withal, the voyce I had heard made me believe
there might be <U+017F>omewhat more in it. Being in the dark chamber of <hi>Zenocritus,</hi>
he took off my maids cloathes, and put on mans; but though I perceiv'd all this,
yet had I not the courage to accu<U+017F>e him of impo<U+017F>ture. My comfort was, that
however, he had given me <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction, by teaching me the invention of
loving my <U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o that as I parted from his hou<U+017F>e, to return to my own, I gave
him a Diamond for his recompence. The very <U+017F>ame day, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>poke of him to a
Gentleman, a friend of mine, who a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me he was the greate<U+017F>t cheat in the
world; and among other <U+017F>ubtil tricks, he had that of making a voyce proceed from
the bottom of his <U+017F>tomack, having his mouth <U+017F>hut, as if it had been another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance from him had <U+017F>poken, and that by this means he had abus'd
many, an<U+017F>wering them to what they de<U+017F>ir'd, as if he had been a <U+017F>pirit, or <U+017F>ome
departed <U+017F>oul. <hi>I</hi> remembred, <hi>I</hi> had heard <U+017F>ay, that in ancient time there were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete<U+017F><U+017F>es,
that <U+017F>poke through the belly, <U+017F>o that I ea<U+017F>ily believ'd <hi>Zenocritus,</hi> had
the <U+017F>ame power. Yet thinking ever on the plea<U+017F>ure he had done me, <hi>I</hi> would
not wi<U+017F>h him any hurt; and forgetting the imaginary beauty of the <hi>Nayad,</hi> which
<hi>I</hi> had not clearly <U+017F>een, <hi>I</hi> admir'd none but my own. <hi>I</hi> had at this time neither
father nor mother, but liv'd at my own liberty. <hi>I</hi> caus'd womens cloathes to be
made me, which <hi>I</hi> ordinarily wore, and being lockt up into my chamber, where
there was a looking-gla<U+017F>s four foot high, and three broad, <hi>I</hi> view'd my <U+017F>elf from
head to foot: <hi>I</hi> was quite ravi<U+017F>h'd in that contemplation, though all my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in the <U+017F>uperficies of a gla<U+017F>s; and <hi>I</hi> wi<U+017F>h'd my eyes had been di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
into <U+017F>ome other part then my face, that <hi>I</hi> might have view'd that in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43725:115"/>
Yet my faithful ice repre<U+017F>enting it to the life to me, <hi>I</hi> caus'd the Idea of
tho<U+017F>e beauties to pa<U+017F>s into my heart where it was pre<U+017F>erv'd. And thus was <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
by an extraordinary love; and if you have ob<U+017F>erv'd the adventure that
gave it its beginning, you will conclude, that he that fir<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>um'd to <U+017F>ay there
were <hi>Nayads,</hi> had <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome that were <U+017F>uppris'd as <hi>I</hi> was.</p>

            <p>That may very well be, <U+017F>aies <hi>Philiris,</hi> <U+017F>ome Poet had had a glimp<U+017F>e of a maid
in a River, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome Ideot <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf in the water, had believed his own
image was another Nymph. As for your part, <hi>I</hi> believe your de<U+017F>ign was to renew
the fable of <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> but yet you have done nothing <U+017F>o <U+017F>imply as he: if you knew
not your <U+017F>elf, when you fir<U+017F>t beheld your <U+017F>elf; and if you took the figure you <U+017F>aw
for a Nymph, 'twas becau<U+017F>e you had chang'd your cloathes; but <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> who
had no other then his ordinary cloathes, took his own repre<U+017F>entation for <U+017F>ome fair
Godde<U+017F>s. If that were true, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay that the yong man were turned fool; but
that being fal<U+017F>e, <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay that the Poet who invented it had no judgement: For
put the ca<U+017F>e that Looking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es were not in u<U+017F>e in the Country of <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> and
that in his mothers hou<U+017F>e there were not neither skillets nor ba<U+017F>ins, in the bottoms
whereof he might have <U+017F>een him <U+017F>elf; could he that was a Hunt<U+017F>-man, and had much
acquaintance with the fields, be without ever beholding him<U+017F>elf in a Fountain? Had
he lived to the age of <U+017F>ixteen, and never met any? And if he had met with any (as
it mu<U+017F>t be nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily conceived) why <U+017F>hould he behold his own face as a new thing,
and imagine there were a Nymph under the water? why had he not rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
this <U+017F>implicity at eight years of age? then it might have been excu<U+017F>ed. By
this it is ea<U+017F>ie to <U+017F>ee, that for to make the adventure probable, it <U+017F>hould have been
accommodated like that of the Shepherd <hi>Fontenay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> do not grant you that, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> for in the fir<U+017F>t place, <hi>I</hi> will not have any
thing reformed as to what hath been anciently believed concerning <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
it may have hapned, that he loved him<U+017F>elf after one manner, and <hi>Fontenay</hi>
after another. The lives of all men are different, and con<U+017F>equently their Hi<U+017F>tories
are <U+017F>o much the more delightful. As concerning the <hi>Nayads,</hi> though <hi>Zenocritus</hi>
have deceived this gentle Shepherd, and hath made him <U+017F>ee his own image in the
water in<U+017F>tead of a Nymph, it does not thence follow that there are none. The fair
one he had <U+017F>een the night before was one indeed, and <hi>I</hi> make no que<U+017F>tion but he
knew her well enough <U+017F>ince: Wherefore let him continue his Hi<U+017F>tory, and we <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>ee what were the end of his loves.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> have acquainted you erewhiles, replies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> that it was in my infancy,
that <hi>I</hi> believed there were <hi>Nayads;</hi> however for the future <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall be of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
were it but for complyance-<U+017F>ake with you: And to go on with my <U+017F>tory, <hi>I</hi>
am to tell you, that having accu<U+017F>tomed my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o long to dre<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf like a
maid, <hi>I</hi> never wore mans cloathes, but when <hi>I</hi> was forced to appear publikely; and
then al<U+017F>o were they heavy on my back. As <hi>I</hi> was one time at my window, there
pa<U+017F>t by a Nobleman of the Country, called <hi>Alcidamas,</hi> who having perceived me,
thought me the greate<U+017F>t Beauty he had ever <U+017F>een; <U+017F>o that he fell furiou<U+017F>ly in love
with me, and came to my hou<U+017F>e with <U+017F>ome fifty Bilbo-blades, for to carry me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
My people, who were accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>ee me di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, told him he was
much deceived if he thought to finde a maid there, and that there was not one in
all the hou<U+017F>e. He notwith<U+017F>tanding came up into my Chamber, where <hi>I</hi> was then
<U+017F>o bu<U+017F>ie at my gla<U+017F>s, that he had embraced me before <hi>I</hi> perceived him. You
have <U+017F>ufficently con<U+017F>ulted your gla<U+017F>s, my fair one, <U+017F>aid he, you have already <U+017F>o

arms to make new wounds, but heal tho<U+017F>e you have already given.</p>
               <p>Upon this, four of his Lacquays took me away in <U+017F>pight of my teeth, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me along with him into a coach. All the way I did nothing but weep; and
I remembred I complain'd in the<U+017F>e terms: Mu<U+017F>t I be taken away, and the deare<U+017F>t
friend I have, not brought with me? O faithfull witne<U+017F>s of my Loves! mu<U+017F>t I

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43725:115"/>
be ever ab<U+017F>ent from you? mu<U+017F>t I bid an eternal adieu to that fair Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s which
you made me always contemplate? 'Twas in you that I <U+017F>aw her, 'twas in you
that I al<U+017F>o <U+017F>aw my <U+017F>elf. Methought I was wholly chang'd into you, and I al<U+017F>o
thought that I comprehended you wholly in my <U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o were my thoughts fill'd
with you as their full object. I often repeated the<U+017F>e words, <U+017F>peaking of my gla<U+017F>s:
but <hi>Alcidamas,</hi> to whom <hi>I</hi> did not explain them, could take them for nothing
but riddles. He ask'd me <U+017F>ometimes what cau<U+017F>e <hi>I</hi> had to complain, <U+017F>ince <hi>I</hi> might
a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould receive no hurt with him: yet <hi>I</hi> gave him no rea<U+017F>on, but
cry'd out thus; Alas! <hi>I</hi> have lo<U+017F>t my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s and my Servant together: My
face was <U+017F>een in that of my Servant's, and in mine was al<U+017F>o <U+017F>een that of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s;
but one moment hath ruined our reciprocal loves. <hi>Alcidamas</hi> hearing
this, thought that the indignation <hi>I</hi> took to be <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>h'd away had made me
talk idly: And when he was come into his ca<U+017F>tle, he brought me to a Gentleman
whom he call'd his Brother, and prayd him to endeavour to bring me to my <U+017F>elf
again. <hi>I</hi> had <U+017F>o little con<U+017F>ideration, that heing removed from my gla<U+017F>s, <hi>I</hi> believ'd
<hi>I</hi> was removed from my <U+017F>elf, though <hi>I</hi> carried my<U+017F>elf well enough in all the places
where <hi>I</hi> went: But having ca<U+017F>t my eyes on <hi>Iphis</hi> his gla<U+017F>s, <hi>Alcidamas</hi>'s brother,
<hi>I</hi> perceiv'd that indeed my face, which by reflection was an object to it <U+017F>elf, was
not ab<U+017F>ent from that beauty which it ador'd. <hi>I</hi> was upon this <U+017F>o comforted, that
<hi>I</hi> <U+017F>mil'd, and with my eyes care<U+017F>s'd my ordinary Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, not thinking of <hi>Iphis</hi>
who very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly ey'd me. This young Lad <U+017F>eemed to be as jovial and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
as his Brother; and it quite amaz'd me to <U+017F>ee him ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou<U+017F>ly
about my neck, <U+017F>aying to me, You di<U+017F>e<U+017F>teem me too much, Fair one! to
prefer that Gla<U+017F>s before me: Am not I as worthy your looks as it? If you
would <U+017F>ee your <U+017F>elf, you may do it in my eyes. Though <hi>Iphis</hi> were very fair,
yet he <U+017F>eem'd not to me to come neer my Nymph, <U+017F>o that I <U+017F>till thru<U+017F>t him from
me, that he might not hinder me to look into his gla<U+017F>s. When it was night, I
would needs behold my<U+017F>elf in it by candlelight: but he caus'd me to go to bed, and
when I thought him gone out of the chamber, he came and lay down by me, <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me as if he had known my thoughts, My fair one! though it were true
that you loved none but your <U+017F>elf, yet can you not hate me, becau<U+017F>e it is you
that I love. I thought <hi>Iphis</hi> had rea<U+017F>on; and having felt his brea<U+017F>t, I found he
was a maid. Then without being mov'd at all, I received his ki<U+017F><U+017F>es, as coming
from my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es friend. I did not think there was any hurt in that, as if I had
received the <U+017F>ame care<U+017F><U+017F>es from his brother, becau<U+017F>e I thought my <U+017F>elf a maid as
well as he, and yet <hi>I</hi> made it <U+017F>oon appear to her that <hi>I</hi> was a man, or at lea<U+017F>t an
Hermaphrodite. <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall not tell you whether <U+017F>he was a<U+017F>ham'd of it or no, for
the darkne<U+017F>s hindered me to <U+017F>ee if <U+017F>he blu<U+017F>h'd, but <hi>I</hi> dare tell you <U+017F>he betrayed a
certain amazement by a mild complaint; yet <U+017F>he turn'd all into gladne<U+017F>s, and
had the confidence to tell me, that indeed <U+017F>uch a Lad as <U+017F>he was required <U+017F>uch a
Maid as <hi>I</hi> was: She al<U+017F>o confe<U+017F>s'd to me, that though her Brother were a very
powerfull man, yet was there a certain Prince who had de<U+017F>ign'd the <U+017F>ame violence
to her that <hi>Alcidamas</hi> exerci<U+017F>ed towards others; <U+017F>o that for fear to be <U+017F>tollen
away <U+017F>ome time or other, either when <U+017F>he were alone in the ca<U+017F>tle, or walking in
the fields, <U+017F>he had thought it her be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e her<U+017F>elf like a man. This
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, <U+017F>he conjur'd me to tell her the rea<U+017F>on why I was clad like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
but I made her believe that I would not reveal that <U+017F>ecret. In the morning
we put on our fal<U+017F>e habits; and having beheld my <U+017F>elf a while in the gla<U+017F>s, I was
in <U+017F>uch a good humour, that <hi>I</hi> went and walk'd into the Garden with <hi>Iphis:
I</hi> found a little door which opened into a field where a many cattel were feeding;
among the re<U+017F>t <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>py'd a Mare, on which as it had been in je<U+017F>t <hi>I</hi> got up; but hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the mane in <U+017F>tead of a bridle, and clo<U+017F>ing to her <U+017F>ides, <hi>I</hi> made her make
<U+017F>uch <U+017F>peed away, that <hi>Iphis</hi> <U+017F>oon lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight of me. She went to the people at
home, to <U+017F>end them to overtake me; but they were not quick enough for me.
<hi>I</hi> know not whether <U+017F>he were much troubled at the lo<U+017F>s of me, or if her Brother
his return were the more: But this <hi>I</hi> know, that <hi>I</hi> was never importun'd any
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43725:116"/>
further by them at my hou<U+017F>e, whither having retired as into a <U+017F>anctuary, <hi>I</hi> forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
my <U+017F>elf better then <hi>I</hi> was before. The affections <hi>I</hi> had for my <U+017F>elf <hi>I</hi> increa<U+017F>ed,
and <hi>I</hi> practis'd all the inventions in the world to rai<U+017F>e the greate<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ure out of
my <U+017F>olitude. <hi>I</hi> had <U+017F>ome <U+017F>even or eight Gowns of <U+017F>everal fa<U+017F>hions, which for
my plea<U+017F>ure <hi>I</hi> ever chang'd; <U+017F>ince <hi>I</hi> had <U+017F>uffered my hair to grow very long,
I pa<U+017F>s'd away whole dayes in curling and frizling it, as having no need of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruques.
Sometimes being laid down on a green couch before my gla<U+017F>s, I playd
on the Lute, and <U+017F>ung certain airs which I had compo<U+017F>ed in my own prai<U+017F>e; and
<hi>I</hi> was <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate, that <hi>I</hi> imagined that the harmony proceeded from the fair
Chantre<U+017F>s <hi>I</hi> had <U+017F>een, and not from me. <hi>I</hi> put on no other cloaths but womans;
and my <U+017F>ervants who would not contradict my delightfull humours, call'd me
rather Madam then my Lord. The neighbours who heard no more talk of <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenay,</hi>
thought him dead, or gone to travel; and as for the fair Lady which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in his hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he was thought to be his Si<U+017F>ter. When I look'd out at the
window, there would ever be <U+017F>ome Gentleman pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by, who<U+017F>e bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was to
<U+017F>ee me, <U+017F>o great was the fame of my beauty; nay there were <U+017F>ome who would
needs demand me in marriage. Now once above all there came to my hou<U+017F>e a
young Lady, who told my people that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ee me. <hi>I</hi> did not at that
time appear much at the window; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>ee me but in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
a thing <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould hardly permit; for <hi>I</hi> was afraid it might be <U+017F>ome man di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>ed
who came to ravi<U+017F>h me; or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome woman, who knowing <hi>I</hi> were a man
came to en<U+017F>nare me into Love. She was a good while at the door de<U+017F>iring me to
open; but <hi>I</hi> would not do it before <U+017F>he had declared to me her de<U+017F>ign. Know
then, fair and <U+017F>olitary Nymph! <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he to me, that <hi>I</hi> am called <hi>Theodora;</hi> and
that all the world having acknowledged that my beauty was incomparable, <hi>I</hi> have
been <U+017F>o vain as to have believ'd it till now: Yet the common report having
taught me that thou had<U+017F>t an admirable beauty, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall never be at re<U+017F>t till <hi>I</hi> have
<U+017F>een whether thou art fairer then a many other whom <hi>I</hi> have excelled. <hi>I</hi> who
conceived my face the hand<U+017F>ome<U+017F>t in the world, and believ'd it concerned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s not to <U+017F>uffer the pre<U+017F>umption of <hi>Theodora</hi> who thought
her<U+017F>elf incomparable, <hi>I</hi> promi<U+017F>ed her entrance on condition <U+017F>he <U+017F>wore not to <U+017F>tay
with me above a quarter of an houre. When <U+017F>he had taken her oath, <hi>I</hi> opened
the door: But O ye Gods! what miracles did <hi>I</hi> find in her? <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o many
attractions, that <hi>I</hi> was even dazled with them, and began to tremble out of a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment,
acknowledging <hi>I</hi> had nothing worth the comparing with her. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
finding in my heart a little ob<U+017F>tinacie, <hi>I</hi> thought it was becau<U+017F>e <hi>I</hi> remembred
not my own beauty; and <U+017F>o pre<U+017F>ently <hi>I</hi> addre<U+017F>s'd my <U+017F>elf to my gla<U+017F>s: But alas!
what inequality did <hi>I</hi> find? For be<U+017F>ides that <hi>Theodora's</hi> face was fairer then mine,
her brea<U+017F>t was uncovered, where the two Bowls, whiter then Alaba<U+017F>ter, were
without any thing el<U+017F>e able to make me peri<U+017F>h, con<U+017F>idering <hi>I</hi> was not furni<U+017F>hed
with any <U+017F>uch beauty. That gave me <U+017F>uch an a<U+017F><U+017F>ault, that <hi>I</hi> kneel'd down before
<hi>Theodora,</hi> and <U+017F>aid to her, Fair Godde<U+017F>s! a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf that this day you have
overcome the proude<U+017F>t creature in the world. She pre<U+017F>ently lifted me up; and
believing <U+017F>he were indeed <U+017F>omwhat above, <U+017F>he began very in<U+017F>olently to relate
how many other triumphs <U+017F>he had already made. Then <U+017F>he made me look on an
ancient woman <U+017F>he had brought with her, who was to te<U+017F>tifie to all the world
that <hi>I</hi> was not <U+017F>o fair as her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. After this <U+017F>he left me, though <hi>I</hi> entreated
her to <U+017F>tay with me that day; for <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he would not break her oath. So was
I <U+017F>oon deprived of her amiable <U+017F>ight through my own fault: but her Idaea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<U+017F>o engraven in my mind, that I would never any more behold my own
face in the gla<U+017F>s. I forgot my <U+017F>elf for her <U+017F>ake; and being weary to be the Lover
and the thing loved both together, I re<U+017F>olved to be pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate for <U+017F>omething
that were more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible then a <U+017F>hadow. Thereupon cur<U+017F>ing the Gla<U+017F>s which had
enchanted me <U+017F>o long, I took a <U+017F>tick and brake it into more peeces then times
I had look'd in it; I burn'd all my womans cloaths, repre<U+017F>enting to my <U+017F>elf, that
to be loved by <hi>Theodora, I</hi> mu<U+017F>t appear as a man. And to <U+017F>ay true, this change of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43725:116"/>
humour fell out very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably; for I could not long di<U+017F><U+017F>emble my <U+017F>exe, <U+017F>ince
my cheeks began to be hairy, and that it was no <U+017F>mall trouble every morning to
get it off. It was <U+017F>o long <U+017F>ince I had gone like a man, that I had much ado to
bring my <U+017F>elf to it again: yet I quitted my <U+017F>olitude, and <U+017F>hewed my <U+017F>elf to all the
world; <U+017F>o that then all the talk was of <hi>Fontenay,</hi> and that it was not known what
was become of his Si<U+017F>ter. My fir<U+017F>t vi<U+017F>its were to <hi>Theodora,</hi> with whom my bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
was <hi>Love:</hi> but I found her <U+017F>o cruel, that I imagin'd <U+017F>he were not to be
wrought to compliance by any natural remedies. I went therefore to <hi>Zenocritus,</hi>
who<U+017F>e reputation was much encreas'd; and having di<U+017F>covered my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion to him,
he promis'd me more effectual a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance then when I loved the <hi>Nayad,</hi> by how
much it was ea<U+017F>ier to gain a humane creature then a divine. His cajolling and
fair tales enchanted me more then his charms; and <U+017F>uch a confidence did I place
in him, that I never dreamt any thing which I did not relate to him, for to have
the interpretation of it: I <U+017F>aw no birds in the air, but I gave him the number of
them; and made him a regi<U+017F>ter of all my thoughts and actions, that he might
thence make his pre<U+017F>ages. If <hi>I</hi> were to return to <hi>Theodora's,</hi> he lookd ore certain
books, and ca<U+017F>t certain lots to <U+017F>ee if the day were fortunate for me. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
all this, there was no great appearance that my affairs were any thing
advanced, and <hi>I</hi> fed my <U+017F>elf with nothing but hope. So that calling to mind that
<hi>I</hi> had a Cou<U+017F>in in the<U+017F>e quarters who was thought a very able man in Magick, <hi>I</hi>
re<U+017F>olved to come and <U+017F>ee him, and renew that kinred and acquaintance with him
which my father had neglected. <hi>I</hi> vi<U+017F>ited <hi>Hircan,</hi> to whom <hi>I</hi> have related all
my fortunes. He advi<U+017F>ed me henceforward to beware the impo<U+017F>tures of <hi>Zenocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>
and he, who is acquainted with the true and <U+017F>ound doctrine, gave me an
herb that made <hi>Theodora</hi> love me, if whenever <hi>I</hi> was to <U+017F>peak to her <hi>I</hi> put it into
my mouth. To be withall reveng'd of my fal<U+017F>e Magician, and pay him in his own
coin, by the advice of my dear Kin<U+017F>man <hi>I</hi> pre<U+017F>ented him with a plea<U+017F>ant little
Book which treated of the means to find <hi>Trea<U+017F>ures.</hi> He was content with that
recompence; and le<U+017F>t <hi>I</hi> might pretend to part of his riches, he is gone out of
this Province to practi<U+017F>e his vain <U+017F>ecrets, which he conceived were above my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding.
<hi>I</hi> have <U+017F>ince married <hi>Theodora,</hi> to the <U+017F>atisfaction of all that knew
us, who rejoyc'd to <U+017F>ee the Fair married to the Fair; and we have hitherto liv'd a
very comfortable life together: And that <hi>I</hi> have now left this dear Spou<U+017F>e, it hath
been for <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of very great con<U+017F>equence which <hi>I</hi> have with my learned
Cou<U+017F>in. As to what concerns <hi>Charite,</hi> of whom <hi>I</hi> boa<U+017F>ted <hi>I</hi> was belov'd in the
pre<U+017F>ence of her faithfull Lover, he hath no rea<U+017F>on to be any way jealous; for
what <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>poke then, was out of error and vanity: <hi>I</hi> believe <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> perceiv'd it <U+017F>o,
and took it no otherwi<U+017F>e; and now that we were made friends ye<U+017F>terday, he will
not bear me any ill will henceforward.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Here <hi>Fontenay</hi> made an end of his <U+017F>tory, which he had related with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
many times recalling what he had <U+017F>aid, as if he had taken a great deal of pains
to lye. <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who laught ever and anon, There's an end it <U+017F>eems of your Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend,
<U+017F>ays he to him, in good time: <hi>I</hi> never heard any thing more impertinent;

Art thou not to blame to cen<U+017F>ure this Shepherd for loving him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince it is
well known, that in his youth he was of an excellent beauty: and that <hi>I</hi> my <U+017F>elf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clad like a maid at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, was enamour'd of my <U+017F>elf I could not but <U+017F>hed
tears at the relation of his adventure, <U+017F>o was I mov'd with it. There is but one
thing troubles me: whereas he lay with <hi>Iphis</hi> who was di<U+017F>guis'd like a man, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould
have wi<U+017F>hed with all my heart, that to make his hi<U+017F>tory the more perfect, his
<hi>Theodora</hi> had been <U+017F>o di<U+017F>guis'd, and that their friends <U+017F>eeing them equal in Beauty
and Riches had de<U+017F>ired to match them together. <hi>Fontenay</hi> taking <hi>Theodora</hi> for a
man, would have abhorr'd <U+017F>uch a marriage, and <hi>Theodora</hi> taking <hi>Fontenay</hi> for a maid,

would not have been joyned to her, fearing <U+017F>he might never receive any <U+017F>atisfaction
thereby. Their plaints would have been reciprocal, and yet being di<U+017F>pos'd into the
nuptial bed they would have found that they had wherewith to plea<U+017F>e one another,
and there was no more to be done the next morning to put all things in order, then
for them to exchange cloathes. <hi>Theodora</hi> taking tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Fontenay;</hi> and <hi>Fontenay</hi>

of <hi>Jantha.</hi> This con<U+017F>ideration is excellent, <U+017F>aies <hi>Fontenay;</hi> but lets not think
any more on it, <U+017F>ince what is done cannot be undone. As to the in<U+017F>olence of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
let us bear with it, as proceeding from a <U+017F>pirit of contradiction, which can
hear nothing and be pleas'd with it. <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould be very glad if <hi>Philiris</hi> would al<U+017F>o
take the pains to give us his hi<U+017F>tory, to <U+017F>ee if haply there will not be <U+017F>o much to
carp at. Let him then vouch<U+017F>afe us that diver<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is; I</hi> conjure him to
do it by the eyes of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. <hi>I</hi> am very tender, as to the refu<U+017F>ing of any thing
whereto <hi>I</hi> am pre<U+017F>s'd with <U+017F>o much civility, replies <hi>Philiris;</hi> prepare therefore your
ears, and you <U+017F>hall hear what ye<U+017F>terday it was my de<U+017F>ire to acquaint you with. While
<hi>Philiris</hi> <U+017F>aid this, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ri<U+017F>es out of his place, and <U+017F>eated him<U+017F>elf on the other <U+017F>ide. What
would you do, <U+017F>aies <hi>Fontenay</hi> to him, do you finde the ground too hard in your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
place? or do you think it any <U+017F>ofter here? There is in this a <U+017F>ecret, and that
no <U+017F>mall one, replies the <hi>Shepherd, I</hi> <U+017F>hould much wonder if you could but conceive
what it might be before <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould tell you: my thoughts are not <U+017F>o common, yet <hi>I</hi>
will di<U+017F>cover it, to let you know that <U+017F>uch a <hi>Lover</hi> as <hi>I</hi> cannot conceive any thing,
but what is rare and excellent. You are then to know, that in the place where <hi>I</hi>
<U+017F>ate before, my back was towards <hi>Orontes</hi> his Ca<U+017F>tle, where is the re<U+017F>idence of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite;</hi>
and that was a thing quite contrary to the rules of all civility: And that is the
rea<U+017F>on why <hi>I</hi> have planted my <U+017F>elf here, where I think my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o well <U+017F>cituated, that
<hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ixtly behold the aboad of my felicity, Had <hi>I</hi> all the mathematical in<U+017F>truments
in the world, <hi>I</hi> could not place my <U+017F>elf better. And that <hi>I</hi> perceive already; for <hi>I</hi>
finde the air more delicate here then there; and methinks the <hi>Zephir</hi> brings with
it <U+017F>ometimes a perfum'd <U+017F>ent, which it took up from the breath of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. <hi>I</hi>
will henceforth turn towards her with as much pertinacy as the Load-<U+017F>tone does
to the North: Whether <hi>I</hi> be a bed, or at table, or be in a <U+017F>hip, or in a Coach, <hi>I</hi>
will ever ob<U+017F>erve that. The de<U+017F>ign is noble, <U+017F>aies <hi>Philiris;</hi> but there is one thing <hi>I</hi>
<U+017F>tumble at, and that is when you are far from your <hi>Charite,</hi> <U+017F>he may go from one
place to another, and turn her back towards you; <U+017F>o that you will be deceiv'd, and
you will look towards a place where <U+017F>he is not, and you never know it. However,
<hi>I</hi> believe your good intention will be much con<U+017F>idered. There's more then <U+017F>o in
it, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> do you not <U+017F>ee that <hi>I</hi> cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be mi<U+017F>taken, <U+017F>ince <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall know
by the wind in what quarter my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s is. That indeed is a rea<U+017F>on that <U+017F>alves all,
replies <hi>Philiris;</hi> its time to di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, if you de<U+017F>ire the relation of my
amorous adventures. Let the brave Shepherd begin when he will, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is, I</hi>
<U+017F>hall not be he will interrupt him. Thereupon <hi>Philiris</hi> related his <U+017F>tory in this

                        <head>The HISTORY of PHILIRIS.</head>
                        <p>A Little Village in Burgundy was the place of my birth (<U+017F>aies this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd)
there my Father and Mother live yet, being per<U+017F>ons more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for their vertues then their wealth: Yet did they be<U+017F>tow the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
part of what little means they had, to bring me up with children of greater
hou<U+017F>es, and it was not their fault, if the good endowments I had acquir'd, did
not commend me to the attendance of great ones: But while I was at <hi>Paris,</hi> though
I wanted bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to look about, yet did I make it my greate<U+017F>t employment to go
wooing up and down. I was the mo<U+017F>t uncon<U+017F>tant thing that ever was known; for
when ever I went to give one La<U+017F>s a vi<U+017F>it, whom I had cho<U+017F>en for my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
I <U+017F>till went through <U+017F>ome <U+017F>treet, where I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee another by the way, le<U+017F>t I
might have lo<U+017F>t my labour. If I had made ver<U+017F>es for the fir<U+017F>t, I endeavored to
<U+017F>tart out the <U+017F>ame occa<U+017F>ion for to pre<U+017F>ent them to the <U+017F>econd; and as I once had
made a <U+017F>ong in commendation of a brown La<U+017F>s, if I had chanc'd afterward to be
acquainted with any more of the <U+017F>ame complexion, I pre<U+017F>ented them with it as
if it had been particularly made for any of them: So that there were a many
finely mump'd, when being in a mask, they confidently gave one another that
<U+017F>ong. I loved the white and the brown, the fat and the <U+017F>lender, the great and
the little; and when I <U+017F>aw one <hi>I</hi> never thought of any of the re<U+017F>t, and for that
time I thought that <U+017F>he were the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>irable: But when I was far from them
all, my affection I left as a booty among them, and <U+017F>he that came fir<U+017F>t into my
thoughts, had the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>hare of the pillage. The dre<U+017F><U+017F>ings and fa<U+017F>hions of cloathes
made me <U+017F>et a higher e<U+017F>teem on the beauties; and if I had loved a little wench,
while <U+017F>he wore a coif, I was <U+017F>ometimes more taken with her when <U+017F>he was in her
hood. There were <U+017F>ome Ladies could rai<U+017F>e no pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions in me but when they were
mask'd; and others, for whom I never <U+017F>ighed, but when I had a full view of
them: of <U+017F>ome, I affected nothing but the brea<U+017F>t; of others, only their eyes;
of <U+017F>ome their <U+017F>tature and their necks; <U+017F>o that to <U+017F>atisfie me fully, I mu<U+017F>t have
had all tho<U+017F>e parts taken and compos'd into a Beauty, <hi>à la mode.</hi> The fa<U+017F>hion
and the colour of the cloathes of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es had a certain grace and in<U+017F>inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which another, then my <U+017F>elf was not capable to di<U+017F>cover. The light flaxen
hair with a black velvet dre<U+017F>s, and carnation fancies on the confines of an ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
white complexion, had <U+017F>uch a lu<U+017F>tre, that I am <U+017F>till <U+017F>o charm'd with the very
remembrance of it, that I can only tell you that I cannot de<U+017F>cribe it; yet was I
in love with all the<U+017F>e, as if they had been e<U+017F><U+017F>ential dependances of the body.
When your little girls quitted their cawls and colour'd gowns, for dre<U+017F><U+017F>ings and
black gowns, my imagination ran on tho<U+017F>e flowers which grow up by little and
little, and when of tender buds they come to be full-blown in their pride, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
change their former colours. But all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal imaginations not onely
decreas'd, but vani<U+017F>hed when I returned into my Country, where I found a beauty
<U+017F>o rare, that it <U+017F>oon made me change all my incon<U+017F>tancy into fidelity. Yet had <hi>I</hi>
never any thoughts for the rai<U+017F>ing of my fortune; for I was more taken with a
<hi>Shepherds innocency,</hi> then any <hi>Court ambitition;</hi> and I thought my <U+017F>elf happy to
live in <U+017F>uch a Country as my own, where <hi>Ju<U+017F>tice,</hi> when <U+017F>he left the earth, had
left her la<U+017F>t foot<U+017F>teps: <U+017F>o that the profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of vertue come thither daily to find
out her treadings, that they might follow her. This happened, while I walk'd in a
Town that was near our Village, where I e<U+017F>pied at the door a yong <hi>Shepherde<U+017F>s,</hi>
who<U+017F>e attractions were <U+017F>uch as ravi<U+017F>h'd away my heart, and robb'd me of my
Liberty. My greate<U+017F>t misfortune was, that I knew not a thing which was <U+017F>o well
known to me; that is to <U+017F>ay, I kenw not who that fair one was, though I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<U+017F>aw her both pre<U+017F>ent and ab<U+017F>ent; but at length, after much enquiry, a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43725:118"/>
Shepherd, a friend of mine, called <hi>Valerius;</hi> acquainted me who her friends were;
and that as for her, <U+017F>he was called <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> a name that <U+017F>hall eternally remain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
in my minde. O Heaven! how joyfull am I to know it, and to be <U+017F>o hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as to name the cau<U+017F>e of my love, that I may accu<U+017F>e it before the throne of God,
for all the mi<U+017F>chief it hath done me. What explications did I not invent for this
name? and what Anagrams did I not endeavor to finde out on it? is there any
Critici<U+017F>m in language which I have not appropriated to it? When I try'd a pen,
<hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> committed a crime, if <hi>I</hi> writ any thing but the word <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia:</hi> <U+017F>o that
all my papers are fill'd with it. And if <U+017F>ometimes <hi>I</hi> writ and heeded not my hand,
it would never make any other Letters then tho<U+017F>e that make up that <U+017F>weet name,
<U+017F>o was I accu<U+017F>tom'd to it. It is not to be asked, if <hi>I</hi> put it into all the ver<U+017F>es <hi>I</hi>
made, and that <hi>I</hi> thought it added harmony to their cadences; though <hi>I</hi> may
<U+017F>afely <U+017F>ay, that they were otherwi<U+017F>e charming enough, to move any barbarous
heart; and that Love had taught me more in fifteen days, then the mo<U+017F>t learned
Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors in the world had done in eight or nine years. <hi>Valerius</hi> al<U+017F>o thought
my ver<U+017F>es <U+017F>o good, that he learn'd them by heart: and yet he endeavored to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
me from my love by this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; Can it be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that you who are
rank'd among the greate<U+017F>t wits in <hi>France</hi> (<U+017F>aies he to me) <U+017F>hould <U+017F>toop before a
little Shepherde<U+017F>s, that hath yet <U+017F>carce forgotten her Play-games? when you
have pre<U+017F>ented her with your ver<U+017F>es, do you think <U+017F>he can di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h them from
the Ballad-Ribaldry, which your Ploughmen <U+017F>ing when they go to work? <U+017F>he'll
<U+017F>hew them to all her companions, and will tell them without any di<U+017F>cretion, it
was you made them. <hi>I</hi> pray God <U+017F>he may not give them the fir<U+017F>t that de<U+017F>ires
them, as if it were a thing as well made for others as her. Ah! <hi>Valerius,</hi> an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, how malicious are you, to <U+017F>peak in this manner? Do you not con<U+017F>ider, that
<hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> will <U+017F>hortly be of age, and arrive to prudence and judgement? and have
you not told me divers times, that <U+017F>he had already no ordinary under<U+017F>tanding?
Now know, that though her words and actions had nothing in them but infancy,
<hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould not give over to <U+017F>erve her. You cannot believe what plea<U+017F>ure <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall think
it to talk with her of love innocently, and to have the honor to be the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hall
teach her what it is to have fires in the <U+017F>oul, and wounds in the heart. <hi>Valerius</hi>
confe<U+017F>t then, that he had commended <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> to me, and that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erved it;
but that he wi<U+017F>hed <U+017F>he were not <U+017F>o exqui<U+017F>ite, that <hi>I</hi> might not <U+017F>eem enchanted
with a Love, which in his opinion promi<U+017F>ed me nothing but affliction. <hi>I</hi> prayed
the Gods they would make him a fal<U+017F>e Prophet, and di<U+017F>cours'd on with him on
the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject, not indeed being able to take any other. He told me, that five
or <U+017F>ix days before <hi>I</hi> had <U+017F>een <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he was in mourning for her mother,
and that <U+017F>he was very hand<U+017F>ome in a black gown. <hi>I</hi> cannot tell you the grief that
<hi>I</hi> have ever <U+017F>ince felt, that <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>aw her not in that mourning. O ye mighty Gods!
why have you not <U+017F>uffer'd me to know her <U+017F>ooner? Had <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>een her in her
infancy, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould have lov'd her <U+017F>o well as <hi>I</hi> do now, and by that means having
the opportunity to <U+017F>erve her more then <hi>I</hi> have, <U+017F>he would have been the more
oblig'd to me. What a diver<U+017F>ity of thoughts came into my minde, whenever I
<U+017F>aw a picture of hers, that was drawn when <U+017F>he was about <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even years old.
O heaven! <U+017F>aid <hi>I,</hi> one time, why did I not know this pretty Minikin, when <hi>I</hi>
my <U+017F>elf was but eleven or twelve? even then <U+017F>hould <hi>I</hi> have <U+017F>ighed for her, and have
left the company of all other children for hers. How glad <U+017F>hould <hi>I</hi> have been to
play with her! <hi>I</hi> would have help'd her to dre<U+017F>s her babies; and would have <U+017F>old my
books, but <hi>I</hi> would have every day brought her <U+017F>ome plums or <U+017F>weet-meats. <hi>I</hi> have
had a world of other infantine and <U+017F>imple thoughts; which witne<U+017F>s my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
and becau<U+017F>e there was at my fathers hou<U+017F>e my own picture, taken when <hi>I</hi> was little,
<hi>I</hi> have often wi<U+017F>h'd to <U+017F>ee them hang'd clo<U+017F>e to one another, as if they were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together. Methinks two <U+017F>uch Children had made a fine couple; but <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s
to you, that I wi<U+017F>h rather the originals were joyn'd then the pictures, if all may
not be done together. But now <hi>I</hi> think on't, <hi>I</hi> vow to you, 'twere one of my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
plea<U+017F>ures to have <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> pictur'd in all ages; for her beauty at <U+017F>ix years old; is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43725:118"/>
not the <U+017F>ame at twelve; and that at twelve, not the fame at <U+017F>ixteen. When
<U+017F>he was little, her hair was flaxen, now 'tis brown: yet hath <U+017F>he always been
look'd on as the wonder of the age; and though her perfections have been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
different, yet her attractions and allurements have been ever the <U+017F>ame I
very well remember the fir<U+017F>t time I <U+017F>aw her, her brea<U+017F>ts appear'd not in their full
beauty, and that tho<U+017F>e vermilion buds which grow there, have been <U+017F>ince rais'd
to their pomp, as being to be rais'd on two mountains, which they <U+017F>hould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
But however it be, I cannot but <U+017F>till be of opinion, that <U+017F>he could not
appear fairer then on that fortunate day <U+017F>he made me her captive. Yet can
I not be rid of a fan<U+017F>tatical curio<U+017F>ity, to have her painted in all the dre<U+017F><U+017F>es
and fa<U+017F>hions that ever <U+017F>he wore, and I think it would much plea<U+017F>e me, had
I but her countenance drawn when <U+017F>he minded to be <U+017F>erious, or el<U+017F>e when <U+017F>he
laught, the time I fir<U+017F>t knew her. But though I might obtain all this, I
doubt not but I <U+017F>hould finde the occa<U+017F>ions of other wi<U+017F>hes, <U+017F>o hard is it to <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the humors of an amorous per<U+017F>on. But for want of all this, I was content
and glad to have a picture of <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> <U+017F>uch as could be had; and out of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on my own imagination I went to a Painter that knew her not, I bid him
draw me the picture of a maid, that had the face <U+017F>omewhat long, her eyes and
hair brown, her cheeks not over-colour'd; <U+017F>o I gave him in<U+017F>tructions for all the
parts, and yet he made above twenty draughts, and hit not right in any one. The
next day therefore I went into a place whence I might <U+017F>ee <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> at ea<U+017F>e; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had well con<U+017F>idered all the Lineaments of her face, I took a large note there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for to give it the Painter, who yet <U+017F>atisfied me not, though he went accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my directions. At length he began to be angry, and told me, he knew
not why I <U+017F>hould put him to <U+017F>o much trouble; and it were better I would carry
him into <U+017F>ome place whence he might <U+017F>ee my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and that it was in vain for
me to keep him from knowing her, <U+017F>ince that if he once drew her well, he might
ea<U+017F>ily call to minde the face <U+017F>hould be like that which he had taken. Be<U+017F>ides, he
repre<U+017F>ented to me, how that I ought not doubt of his fidelity; and if I freely nam'd
her to him, he would keep it more <U+017F>ecret then if I conceal'd it, and he come to
know it afterwards; becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e that are too di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful, <U+017F>eem to grant others
liberty to deceive them. The<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons I thought very pertinent, and bani<U+017F>hing
all fear, I ingenuou<U+017F>ly told my Painter, that I could not bring him to my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es
hou<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>peak truth, I had no entrance thither my <U+017F>elf; but
that there was one expedient, which was to go to the Church, where <U+017F>he <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<U+017F>taid very long: So I brought him pre<U+017F>ently thither, to <U+017F>hew him her place.
He <U+017F>aw <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> that very day, and brought me a rough draught of her, which
indeed had <U+017F>omewhat of her air. I met him the next day, coming from Church
running, but he made a <U+017F>ign to me with his hand, that I <U+017F>hould not advance, not
<U+017F>o much as looking on me, becau<U+017F>e he had ju<U+017F>t then <U+017F>een my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to lo<U+017F>e her perfect Idea, before he had taken a draught of it. I had lent
him <U+017F>ome Love <U+017F>tories, to put him into a good humour, and to make him go
through his work more chearfully. I al<U+017F>o went often to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him, but
I put him to a deal of trouble; for I never thought the picture fair enough.
At la<U+017F>t he came <U+017F>o near it, that I was forc'd to cry out, There's <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> <U+017F>hould
I deny it! methinks this picture <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak to convince me! After that time,
I comforted my <U+017F>elf with that picture; and when I was weary of viewing it, I
mu<U+017F>t needs go to <U+017F>ee <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> in the Church. When I went in, I directed my <U+017F>ight
to that part where <U+017F>he was; and when I came out, I could not refrain turning my
head for to <U+017F>ee her. <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> fear'd not the a<U+017F><U+017F>ault of an amorous look, as do <U+017F>ome
maids, who ca<U+017F>t down their eyes when they perceive they are look'd on. She di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
her <U+017F>ight the more fix'dly towards me; and mo<U+017F>t commonly, being <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd,
I <U+017F>eem'd to be the more ba<U+017F>hful, and drew a<U+017F>ide my eyes from her, till
<U+017F>he look'd off me: Ah fair eyes! what know I whether you did this through
confidence or innocency? but what I pray could my <U+017F>oul think to find you <U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
to commit murthers in <U+017F>uch tender age? yet was there a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to take
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43725:119"/>
all patiently; and it was a far greater cruelty, when <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> turn'd her back to me,
or kneel'd down to read. I often <U+017F>aid to her within my <U+017F>elf, that her prayers
were too long, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould allow <U+017F>ome of her time to hear tho<U+017F>e I made to
her; and that the Gods would not hear her if <U+017F>he did not hear others. My go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>o often to the <U+017F>ame Church, and placing my <U+017F>elf ever in the <U+017F>ame part, caus'd
my friends when they wanted me, to come and look for me there. Tho<U+017F>e that
pa<U+017F>s'd by, whether of my acquaintance or theirs, made a <U+017F>tay there; <U+017F>o that there
was no want of good di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e they were all very knowing per<U+017F>ons.
<hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> was the cau<U+017F>e of all our plea<U+017F>ant conferences; and yet there was none but
my <U+017F>elf that knew it. At length heaven willing to be more favorable to me, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
it <U+017F>o, that <hi>Valerius</hi> made acquaintance with <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> at a Cou<U+017F>ins of hers,
whither <U+017F>he was wont to go, called <hi>Amelita.</hi> I prayed him to que<U+017F>tion <hi>Amelita</hi>
about many things: and <U+017F>ee now the fancies of Lovers, I was <U+017F>o afraid he might
forget <U+017F>omewhat, that I gave him a note of all he was to do and to <U+017F>ay. I wi<U+017F>h'd
him among other things, to enquire whether <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> ever took notice of me; and
whether <U+017F>he had found any ver<U+017F>es, which I had a while before ca<U+017F>t on her win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
I had a very good account of that, and of divers other particulars: <U+017F>o
that I was more and more inflam'd in my pur<U+017F>uit; and I conjur'd <hi>Valerius</hi> to
acquaint me what day <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> went to <U+017F>ee her Cou<U+017F>in, that <U+017F>o we might go
thither together, and that I might there <U+017F>peak to her. At lea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid I, if I
may not be <U+017F>uffered to <U+017F>peak to her, let me have the liberty to <U+017F>alute her, as
often as I <U+017F>hall meet her: For it is in<U+017F>upportable to me, to <U+017F>ee my <U+017F>elf oblig'd
to pa<U+017F>s before her I mo<U+017F>t honor in the world, and not give her any te<U+017F>timony
of my <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which I mu<U+017F>t only do her in my thoughts.</p>
                        <p>Let all tho<U+017F>e Lovers that cannot have acce<U+017F>s to tho<U+017F>e they love, con<U+017F>ider this,
and they will confe<U+017F>s them<U+017F>elves to be in the <U+017F>ame affliction as my <U+017F>elf, and
that whoever knew the divers imaginations I had in my Love, will know all that
that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion makes us do. 'Twere <U+017F>ufficient matter of a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, to know
the <U+017F>trange Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ions <hi>Valerius</hi> had from me, and in what manner I gave
them him.</p>
                        <p>And <U+017F>eeing <hi>Amelita, Ba<U+017F>ilia's</hi> Cou<U+017F>in was <U+017F>omewhat a light Hou<U+017F>ewife, <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
found at home, I bid him endeavor to meet with her in the fields or in
the Town; but he could not do it in fifteen days; and yet when he went from
me in the morning, <hi>I</hi> charg'd him to tell her this or that, as if he were infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
to meet her; and in the evening <hi>I</hi> ever went to him to know what he
had advanc'd in my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; <U+017F>o that <hi>I</hi> even per<U+017F>ecuted him (if <hi>I</hi> may <U+017F>o <U+017F>ay)
by my importunities. One time he brought me very good news; for he told
me that <hi>Amelita</hi> had acquainted him that <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> would be at her hou<U+017F>e the
next day. We fail'd not at the time appointed; and <hi>I</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <hi>I</hi> was then
forc'd to put on <U+017F>tronger chains then tho<U+017F>e of my fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>lavery, <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me as well by her ingenuity as her beauty. <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Amelita</hi> de<U+017F>irous
to favour me with all the opportunity might be, left us together, and gave
me occa<U+017F>ion to declare my <U+017F>ufferings to her, who was the cau<U+017F>e of them. A
Captain that were to joyn battel with a mo<U+017F>t potent Enemy, would not have
been guilty of <U+017F>o many di<U+017F>tractions as <hi>I</hi> was then; and not knowing at what end
to begin, <hi>I</hi> ever and anon chang'd my de<U+017F>ign.</p>
                        <p>At length <U+017F>peaking to <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> of all the Ver<U+017F>es <U+017F>he had found, I acquainted
her they were only de<U+017F>ign'd for her; and if I had <U+017F>ought the means to <U+017F>ee her in
divers places, it was that <U+017F>he might <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome experiences of my affection. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
me, That I had not begun that Gallantry, and that I did not pur<U+017F>ue it for
any other rea<U+017F>on then to make my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>port, as other young Shepherds did. To
that I replied all that I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly invent, to per<U+017F>wade her that I lov'd her;
and yet <U+017F>he would never confe<U+017F>s that <U+017F>he believed ought I <U+017F>aid. And 'tis indeed
to be acknowledg'd, that though my cau<U+017F>e were good, yet had I not many <U+017F>trong
rea<U+017F>ons to maintain it: My mind was not free enough for to bethink it of fine
words, and <hi>I</hi> had much a do to keep my <U+017F>elf from vani<U+017F>hing away, <U+017F>o violently did
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43725:119"/>
my heart beat. <hi>I</hi> was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpris'd, and withall <U+017F>o fearfull, that my whole body
trembled, and <hi>I</hi> believe <hi>I</hi> had fallen down if <hi>I</hi> had not been <U+017F>eated. Methought
al<U+017F>o, without flattering my <U+017F>elf, that <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> had no greater confidence of her<U+017F>elf,
for <U+017F>he blu<U+017F>h'd and fix'd her eyes on the ground, not <U+017F>o much as looking on me.
<hi>I</hi> al<U+017F>o believ'd there had not any Shepherd <U+017F>poke to her of Love before; but
for me who was not an Apprentice in that trade, to be <U+017F>o much troubled, was
very <U+017F>trange. Whenever <hi>I</hi> remembred what action we were in, <hi>I</hi> had very <U+017F>trange
emotions; and <hi>I</hi> believe we were rather an object of pitty then matter of delight
to tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>aw us. <hi>I</hi> do not relate to you our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e word for word, for my
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment hindred me to ob<U+017F>erve it: Let it <U+017F>uffice you to know, that <hi>I</hi> advanc'd
nothing that time; and having met <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> eight dayes after in the <U+017F>ame place,
<hi>I</hi> was only <U+017F>o happy as to know that <U+017F>he <U+017F>omwhat favour'd me. Nay, finding a
Pack of Cards on the Chimney-piece, <U+017F>he was in <U+017F>o good a humour as to ask me
whether <hi>I</hi> would play a game with her at <hi>Picquet.</hi> When <hi>I</hi> lo<U+017F>t any thing, <U+017F>he
made <U+017F>ome little offers to jeer at me, and among other things told me <hi>I</hi> was ea<U+017F>ie
to be overcome. There's no greater glory then to be overcome by you, reply'd I;
and yet <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould think it better you were not <U+017F>o in<U+017F>olent in your victories as to be
abu<U+017F>ive; if <hi>I</hi> ever come to revenge my <U+017F>elf, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall have no pitty on you. Upon
that having put on a little confidence, <hi>I</hi> endeavour'd to ki<U+017F>s her in my play: but <U+017F>he
call'd <hi>Amelita,</hi> &amp; <U+017F>aid to her, Make <hi>Philiris</hi> be quiet, <hi>I</hi> pray; <U+017F>ee you how he treats
me without any re<U+017F>pect! What are you angry at? <U+017F>aid <hi>I</hi> to her: how do you
expect <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould be wi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince <hi>I</hi> have lo<U+017F>t my <hi>di<U+017F>cretion?</hi> This touch was <U+017F>o gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
that the Shepherds laught a good while at it, and in the mean time <hi>I</hi> found
the occa<U+017F>ion to take the ki<U+017F>s had been refus'd me. The next day I brought a pair
of Spani<U+017F>h gloves to <hi>Amelita,</hi> to pre<U+017F>ent to <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> having thru<U+017F>t a little Note
into one of the fingers, wherein the<U+017F>e words were written:
<q>Fair hands, who have <U+017F>tollen away my heart, receive
the Pre<U+017F>ent I make you of the<U+017F>e Gloves, which I do to be
out of your debt. Let your fingers confidently enter into
them, and there keep them clo<U+017F>e; there is nothing more
convenient for them, <U+017F>ince 'tis ordinary for Thieves to
hide them<U+017F>elves.</q>
I under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>ince from a good hand, that my Pre<U+017F>ent was acceptable to <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi>
and that <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent me thanks with much complement: Yet my amorous remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trances
ever met with <U+017F>mall refu<U+017F>als; and the poor Shepherde<U+017F>s had not <U+017F>o much
boldne<U+017F>s as to confe<U+017F>s my <U+017F>ervices de<U+017F>erved any recompence. Be<U+017F>ides <U+017F>he <U+017F>o little
<U+017F>tudied any compliance, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid all came to her tongues end; whereby <hi>I</hi>
might ob<U+017F>erve, that though her mind was of a <U+017F>weet compo<U+017F>ure, yet could <U+017F>he
not on any occa<U+017F>ions but betray <U+017F>omwhat of want of age, and di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>ome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
of infancie. Yet one thing <hi>I</hi> could not but take notice of, that while <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>igh'd
when <hi>I</hi> look'd on her, <U+017F>he would go and play with her little Dog, or a Lamb,
calling it her Minion and her Servant. <hi>I</hi> think <hi>Amelita</hi> pittied me, and that <U+017F>he
could not but pray her Cou<U+017F>in to treat me otherwi<U+017F>e; for within a little while <hi>I</hi>
perceiv'd that <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> took <U+017F>ome plea<U+017F>ure in my addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and came to love me
even to jealou<U+017F>ie. So that having de<U+017F>ired her to let me take her Picture, becau<U+017F>e
that which <hi>I</hi> had caus'd to be taken was not (as I thought) much like her, <U+017F>he
very hand<U+017F>omly refus'd it, telling me that <U+017F>he feared I might be more in love with
that then with her own true face; and that <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould after a while content my <U+017F>elf
to <U+017F>ee that, and <U+017F>peak to it at my own hou<U+017F>e, in <U+017F>tead of coming to entertain her
her<U+017F>elf. Now if Painting made her <U+017F>o <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitious, you may well think <U+017F>he was more
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pectfull of living per<U+017F>ons. She would not have me vi<U+017F>it any Maid; nay, out of a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43725:120"/>
a fear her Cou<U+017F>in might tempt me to her, <U+017F>he would not have me make any more
vi<U+017F>its at her hou<U+017F>e. Since that time, I very difficulty could find the occa<U+017F>ions to
entertain her: But the fir<U+017F>t time I <U+017F>aw her, I told her what I thought. Deare<U+017F>t
<hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia!</hi> <U+017F>aid I to her, You need no more di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t me then your own heart: I
had rather only think of you, then <U+017F>ee the faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F>s in the world; I
would rather <U+017F>ee you, then ki<U+017F>s another; I would value one of your ki<U+017F><U+017F>es more
then the perfect enjoyment of another; and if ever I have the happine<U+017F>s to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
you, I <U+017F>hall not believe any fortune equal to mine. The applications you have
<U+017F>ometimes made to <hi>Amelita,</hi> replies <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> your little reciprocal <U+017F>milings, and
<U+017F>o much whi<U+017F>pering in the ear, have made me think it not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible you might
build a new affection upon the ruines of the former. Ah <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia!</hi> cry'd I out,
will you ever per<U+017F>ecute me thus? Put me upon <U+017F>ome dangerous adventures, find
out the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtle inventions in the world for to try whether I love you: And
to the end I may chain my up <U+017F>elf the further in the fair pri<U+017F>on wherein I am, I wil
give you a <U+017F>trange advice: Seek out that which is <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t in all Magick for to
bind the affections, and make u<U+017F>e of it in my ca<U+017F>e; let me take a <hi>Philter</hi> as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as you would give an enemy who<U+017F>e courage you would abate. <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> took
her advantage of this advice; and taking me at my word, <U+017F>he went to an old Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere<U+017F>s
who promi<U+017F>ed her a Love-potion: But the old was not <U+017F>ecret, but
went and di<U+017F>cover'd the de<U+017F>ign to her Father; who not de<U+017F>iring there <U+017F>hould be
any love between me and his daughter, becau<U+017F>e I was not rich enough for her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
him how to deceive her. He gave a <U+017F>um of money to the Sorcere<U+017F>s, to
make two Drinks, one for love, the other for hatred: That of hatred was given
to <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> and that for love he took with him. He being gone out of the hou<U+017F>e,
I had the time to <U+017F>ee his daughter, for I ever watch'd when he went abroad: but
he pre<U+017F>ently was back, and brought along with him a Shepherd called <hi>Lyca<U+017F>tus,</hi>
whom he intended <U+017F>hould marry <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> becau<U+017F>e of his great wealth. Though
this were the fir<U+017F>t time he found me at his hou<U+017F>e, yet did he not look uncheerfully
on me, but de<U+017F>ired me to drink with him as well as <hi>Lyca<U+017F>tus,</hi> which familiarity I
was much pleas'd with. We drank of an excellent wine; and the <U+017F>econd time he
was to pre<U+017F>ent <hi>Lyca<U+017F>tus,</hi> he found the means to put in the Philter. <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> on
the other <U+017F>ide lo<U+017F>t not her time, and taking my gla<U+017F>s, put in <U+017F>ome of the Hate-potion.
So we took off what was much mi<U+017F>-directed to us. For my part, I was
above three hours before I felt any change in my body or mind: But as to <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>tus,</hi>
being return'd home pre<U+017F>ently after, he fell <U+017F>o <U+017F>ick, that they knew not
what remedy to apply. He <U+017F>oon di<U+017F>cover'd to his father and mother, that the
cau<U+017F>e of this accident was that he had drunk at <hi>Nerian, Ba<U+017F>ilia's</hi> father's: So
that he was call'd to que<U+017F>tion as a poi<U+017F>oner. <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> imagining all the fault might
proceed from her, went and declared it was <U+017F>he had put whatever there was in the
wine; and de<U+017F>irous to acquit her father, <U+017F>he prote<U+017F>ted he was not guilty. For my
part, having under<U+017F>tood the trouble they were in, I would needs deliver them out
of it, And though I felt in my <U+017F>elf a new <U+017F>lackne<U+017F>s towards <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> yet could <hi>I</hi>
have de<U+017F>ired to die for her: For that diminution of Love came to me only by
fits; and Rea<U+017F>on, which <U+017F>till <U+017F>way'd my mind, was a <U+017F>ufficient admonitor to me
that <hi>I</hi> ought to be faithfull. <hi>Nerian</hi> was accus'd for poi<U+017F>oning <hi>Lyca<U+017F>tus:</hi> but
<hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> <U+017F>wore he had given it him innocently, and that it was <U+017F>he had made the
compo<U+017F>ure: And <hi>I</hi> came and declared to the Judges, that it was upon my in<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<U+017F>he had prepar'd the drink, and that <hi>I</hi> ought to <U+017F>uffer for it, and not any
other. The bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was <U+017F>o confounded, that it was not known whether we were
guilty or innocent: but <hi>Lyca<U+017F>tus</hi> being <U+017F>oon recover'd, we were <U+017F>ent away ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted,
not <U+017F>o much as oblig'd to tell for what rea<U+017F>on we had dre<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>o danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a drink. <hi>Lyca<U+017F>tus</hi> having recovered to his perfect health again, the skill of
our Sorcere<U+017F>s <U+017F>o wrought in him, that he fell pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love with <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi>
and demanded her in marriage of her father, whom a while before he had que<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd.
<hi>Nerian</hi> <U+017F>eeing his de<U+017F>ign effected, very gladly treated with him about the
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, to the great regret of <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> who <U+017F>aw her Magick had not much ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated:

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43725:120"/>
for though I ceas'd not to love her, yet did I not think on her <U+017F>o often as
before, nor did look after the occa<U+017F>ions to <U+017F>ee her, but very indifferently<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
at la<U+017F>t my natural inclination overcame the charm, and two or three of my
Letters a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd her that I would live and dye in her <U+017F>ervice. On the other <U+017F>ide,
the drink which <hi>Lyca<U+017F>tus</hi> had taken being to work but fifteen dayes, he returned
to his former humor, which was far from the marriage he had talk'd of; <U+017F>o that
the next time he <U+017F>aw <hi>Nerian,</hi> he but very indifferently mention'd it to him. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
<U+017F>wore there <U+017F>hould never be any <U+017F>uch thing; <U+017F>o was he vex'd to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf
<U+017F>lieghted; and the <U+017F>ame day by divine permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, it happened that our Sorcere<U+017F>s
was ca<U+017F>t into pri<U+017F>on. Among other mi<U+017F>chiefs <U+017F>he had done, <U+017F>he declared to the
Judges how <U+017F>he had <U+017F>old potions to <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> and her fathr. <hi>Nerian</hi> <U+017F>eeing a
<U+017F>candal hanging over his hou<U+017F>e, would thus repair it; having found me out, he
<U+017F>poke to me of be<U+017F>towing <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> on me for my wife: I willingly accepted the
proffer, and my friends were very glad to <U+017F>ee me preferr'd <U+017F>o highly. As for
<hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> <U+017F>he, as having ever mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately lov'd me, was extreamly <U+017F>atisfied,
and repented her of the crime <U+017F>he had committed, by tru<U+017F>ting to the potions of
an inchantre<U+017F>s, who robb'd <U+017F>ome of their lives, and others of their wits. She
hath <U+017F>ince believed that there needed no other charms then tho<U+017F>e of her Beauty
and her Vertue for to make me love her, though tho<U+017F>e of her mutual affection
did nothing contribute; <U+017F>o that our marriage was thought the mo<U+017F>t fortunate
that ever happened in our Country. Yet having once the curio<U+017F>ity to ask a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-teller,
if there were any thing I might be further happy in? he an<U+017F>wered
me there was; and that I <U+017F>hould never be ab<U+017F>olutely happy, till I had <U+017F>een the
amiable Shepherd, who feeds his flocks <U+017F>ometimes on the banks of the <hi>Seine,</hi> and
<U+017F>ometimes on tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Morin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A while after this there came a Carrier out of this Countrey, who told me
that that Shepherd was called <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and that I <U+017F>hould profit much by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ation.
I was of opinion I could not re<U+017F>t while I <U+017F>tood in ho<U+017F>tility again<U+017F>t the
cele<U+017F>tial admonitions<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> So that having di<U+017F>covered my de<U+017F>igns to <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> I <U+017F>oon took
leave of her, that I might the <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>ee her again. She <U+017F>hed <U+017F>o many tears at
my departure, as <U+017F>ome fanta<U+017F>tical Poets would have thought enough to bring me
hither in a boat. Yet I came a foot, and re<U+017F>ted not, till <hi>I</hi> found the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Shepherd of whom my felicity depends. 'Tis you <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> whom my Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teller
told me of; and the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of your conver<U+017F>ation, bani<U+017F>hes the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
which the ab<U+017F>ence of my dear wife cau<U+017F>es me. Now that <hi>I</hi> am with you,
<hi>I</hi> believe <hi>I</hi> have found the <U+017F>overaign good, which <U+017F>o many others are a <U+017F>eeking;
and <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall carry into my Country a <U+017F>olid knowledge, which <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall be
fill'd with, when <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall have heard your Lectures.</p>

               <hi>Philiris</hi> having thus clos'd his <U+017F>tory, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> began to <U+017F>peak; and <U+017F>aid to him, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Shepherd, the Gods grant thou mai<U+017F>t finde with me the <U+017F>atisfaction thou hope<U+017F>t.
There's only one thing troubles me, that being married as thou art, and it being in
thy power to bring thy wife whither thou plea<U+017F>e<U+017F>t, thou ha<U+017F>t been <U+017F>o much to blame
as not to have brought her hither. I have the <U+017F>ame complaint to make again<U+017F>t
<hi>Fontenay,</hi> this <U+017F>econd <U+017F>tory makes me think on't: You <U+017F>hould both of you have
brought your dear Halves with you; <U+017F>o you <U+017F>hould not have wept for their
ab<U+017F>ence, your contentments had been never the <U+017F>horter, you <U+017F>hould have been in
<U+017F>olitude and viduity as you are; you <U+017F>hould have had Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es to entertain
and court as well as others; whereas now you may not pre<U+017F>ume to make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F><U+017F>es
with civility to any of this Country: Be<U+017F>ides, you would have done us a great
obligation, to let us <U+017F>ee <hi>Theodora</hi> and <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> who<U+017F>e perfections would have rendred
our company more illu<U+017F>trious.</p>
            <p>As for my dear <hi>Theodora,</hi> replies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> you may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf I would
have brought her along, had <U+017F>he not been <U+017F>omewhat indi<U+017F>pos'd when I came away.
And for my <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia,</hi> <U+017F>ayes <hi>Philiris, I</hi> have left her at home to bear her Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
who is an ancient man; be<U+017F>ides that, I thought that having for a while <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43725:121"/>
the rigors of ab<U+017F>ence, I <U+017F>hould at my return receive more infinite plea<U+017F>ure.
However, I am not void of comfort here, for the image of my fair Shepherde<U+017F>s
is ever before my eyes. <hi>I</hi> never <U+017F>ee <hi>Lillies</hi> nor <hi>Carnations,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> am put in
minde of her <hi>complexion.</hi> I never <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>tars, but <hi>I</hi> think on her <hi>eyes,</hi> which are
my two <hi>Planets;</hi> and if <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ee the <hi>Moon</hi> <U+017F>hine, <hi>I</hi> am extreamly chear'd up, becau<U+017F>e
at our parling, <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> and <hi>I</hi> mutually promi<U+017F>s'd to behold that Planet at the <U+017F>ame
hour; <U+017F>o that when <hi>I</hi> contemplate it, it joys me to know that my Shepherde<U+017F>s
doth the <U+017F>ame, and that we do both the <U+017F>ame action. Nay, <hi>I</hi> believe, that <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the fair <hi>Diana</hi> wi<U+017F>hes me <U+017F>o well, that <U+017F>he carries news to <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<hi>I</hi> am, and that <U+017F>he can al<U+017F>o give me an account how <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi> does, as if her
vi<U+017F>age were a <hi>Looking-gla<U+017F>s,</hi> wherein by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret <U+017F>cience things might be <U+017F>een
at di<U+017F>tance. The<U+017F>e are indeed mo<U+017F>t excellent entertainments for a Lover, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;
I</hi> prote<U+017F>t to you, that the hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Philiris</hi> hath given me <U+017F>o much content, as
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could be receiv'd from it; there's nothing in't but what is <U+017F>weet and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
Nay, <hi>I</hi> do not think the Critick <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath found any thing in it to carp
at. In my opinion <hi>Philiris</hi> is no more in the right then <hi>Fontenay,</hi> replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi>
there are al<U+017F>o a world of ab<U+017F>urdities in his <U+017F>tory. The<U+017F>e <U+017F>hittle-headed Lovers are
pure extravagances; and when <hi>I</hi> think on the many de<U+017F>ires he had about her picture,
<hi>I</hi> believe his fidelity hath not yet re<U+017F>tor'd him to his wits. Above all, <hi>I</hi> could not
but laugh at his conclu<U+017F>ion, when he <U+017F>peaks of the abundance of <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia</hi>'s tears;
for after the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of her <U+017F>tudied di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, he makes her fall into the lowe<U+017F>t
degree of folly. And though he hath made over his intere<U+017F>t to that conceipt of the
<hi>tears</hi> and the <hi>river</hi> to fanta<U+017F>tick <hi>Poets,</hi> yet <hi>I</hi> doubt not but he will be glad to keep
it for him<U+017F>elf, and will own it whenever it <U+017F>hall be father'd on him. Be<U+017F>ides, both
he and <hi>Fontenay</hi> are both as jealous as ever was <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia.</hi> That they have not brought
their wives hither, was for fear they might not be only for them, having heard <U+017F>ay,
that there are tho<U+017F>e who marry for them and their friends too. Thou art deceiv'd,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> they know well enough that every one here hath his Shepherde<U+017F>s, and
that it is in this Country that <hi>Fidelity</hi> hath e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd her Kingdom; we are all
<U+017F>candaliz'd at the ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s of thy language. If there be any point of their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
that can offend us, 'tis more then <hi>I</hi> have yet ob<U+017F>erv'd, but the fault is not theirs
but Fates. You all know, that in <hi>Romances</hi> the Love-<U+017F>tories you meet with never
come to any end; they are never fully accompli<U+017F>h'd till the end of the book: <U+017F>ee in
the mean time <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> are married already, and con<U+017F>equently have no
famous adventures to run through, whereas their marriage <U+017F>hould have been at the
<U+017F>ame time as mine, according to the ordinary method. There mu<U+017F>t be diver<U+017F>ity in
the world, el<U+017F>e it were not delightful, <U+017F>ays <hi>Philiris,</hi> if you have heard the <U+017F>tories
of two married men, you will happly hear anon tho<U+017F>e of two Batchelours. That's
my comfort, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> there's enough <U+017F>poken to that <U+017F>ubject. There is now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
troubles me, but that <hi>I</hi> con<U+017F>ider that <hi>Fontenay</hi> hath not quitted his name,
which is the name of a <hi>Lord<U+017F>hip,</hi> more proper to a <hi>Souldier</hi> then a <hi>Shepherd.</hi> Yet
<U+017F>ince the word is derived from <hi>Fountain,</hi> which is a thing ru<U+017F>tical and <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral,</hi> it
<U+017F>hall not be chang'd. As concerning <hi>Philiris, I</hi> have only one doubt as to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
He mentions his father, his Father in Law, and him<U+017F>elf as Shepherds; 'twas
a thing <hi>I</hi> knew not before, that there were any famous Shepherds in <hi>Burgundy.</hi> You
may be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd there are a many, replies <hi>Philiris;</hi> and they are not ru<U+017F>tical per<U+017F>ons,
but per<U+017F>ons of quality, that have renounc'd the pomp of the Court. I am very
glad of it, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is; I</hi> hope one day to <U+017F>ee a wonderful advancement of the <hi>Pa<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
life: Should <hi>I</hi> not accommodate my <U+017F>elf here, <hi>I</hi> would go into your Country,
which <hi>I</hi> had not yet <U+017F>o much as thought on.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>poke thus to <hi>Philiris,</hi> there came one of <hi>Hircans</hi> Lacqueys, who <U+017F>aid
his Ma<U+017F>ter expected the company to dine with him. Upon which they all ri<U+017F>e up,
and took their way towards his Ca<U+017F>tle. <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who had <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret talk with
<hi>Fontenay,</hi> learned of him who the new Shepherds were, whom he had <U+017F>een the day
before. When they were come to <hi>Hircans, Polidor, Meliantes</hi> and <hi>Lucida</hi> (who
was now called <hi>Amaryllis)</hi> came and receiv'd the company: and the Magician ask'd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43725:121"/>
them what they had been doing all the while. We fel from one di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e into another
concerning a Temple which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would build to the honor of <hi>Charite,</hi> replies <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
I now acquaint the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> faies <hi>Hircan,</hi> that be<U+017F>ides the Temple which
he hath erected to his Mi<U+017F>tris in his own <U+017F>oul, if there be need of a material one, <U+017F>he
hath one already, and that the mo<U+017F>t magnificent that can be imagin'd. All the earth
is her altar, the water is to wa<U+017F>h her victims, the ayr is fill'd with nothing but the
prayers and <U+017F>ighs of her adorers, the elementary fire <U+017F>erves for her <U+017F>acrifices, the
heaven is the roof of the building, and the Planets are the lamps that hang in it. I
will not contradict thee in <U+017F>o noble an imagination, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I will think no
further of building little Temples to <hi>Charite;</hi> But thou art withal to know, that
we have had other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e erewhile: we have had a great conte<U+017F>tation about <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphos'd</hi>
per<U+017F>ons, and <hi>rural Divinities,</hi> which there are divers that cannot believe
are at all. I will cure them of that error, <U+017F>ays <hi>Hircan;</hi> put me in minde of it. This
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, <hi>Fontenry</hi> made a brief relation to his Cou<U+017F>in of the <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is</hi>
of <hi>Pathenice;</hi> and after that they were all <U+017F>ate at table, not forgetting the Shepherd
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> whom they made <U+017F>peak in <U+017F>pight of his teeth, that he might pay his
reckoning in good di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who could <U+017F> of nothing but <hi>Charite,</hi>
engag'd the company on that <U+017F>ubject; and ask'd <hi>Philiris,</hi> if he had ever <U+017F>een that
Shepherde<U+017F>s. The que<U+017F>tion was impertinent enough, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Philiris</hi> was but newly
arrived into <hi>Brie;</hi> and yet to <U+017F>ee what <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would <U+017F>ay, he an<U+017F>wered, That he had
<U+017F>een that fair one, as he pa<U+017F>t by, <U+017F>tanding at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s door. I am glad of that, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> for that is a <U+017F>ign <U+017F>he is not <U+017F>ick. If <U+017F>he had continued <U+017F>ick <U+017F>till, I <U+017F>hould not
<U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily have been gotten abroad, I <U+017F>hould have kept my chamber as well as <U+017F>he
out of conformy. That I have come abroad while <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ick, I have committed
a fault, of which I repent me. But without je<U+017F>ting, Shepherd <hi>Philiris,</hi> is it then po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
that thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>een her, and do<U+017F>t not relate the <U+017F>trange a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment thou wert
then in? did <U+017F>he not make thy eyes twinkle, le<U+017F>t her great lu<U+017F>tre might dazzle thee?
did <U+017F>he not make thee forget, at lea<U+017F>t for one quarter of an hour, the beauty of
thy <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia?</hi> But without di<U+017F><U+017F>embling tell me, had<U+017F>t thou wa<U+017F>h'd thy eyes that
morning, for to purifie them, and take away the pollution which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from prophane objects, <U+017F>o to make them worthy to contemplate that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
countenance? Though <hi>Clarimond</hi> quarrel with my tears, <U+017F>aies <hi>Philiris,</hi> yet
<U+017F>hall I not forbear <U+017F>peaking of them; and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that it is with them that I
ever purifie my eyes, when I am ab<U+017F>ent from <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilia.</hi> Doubt not but I have <U+017F>een
your <hi>Charite,</hi> and that <U+017F>he hath put me into that admiration, which is forc'd on us
by all things incomparable. Let me <U+017F>ee thy eyes, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> looking on him; thou
lye<U+017F>t not, beloved Shepherd, thou ha<U+017F>t indeed <U+017F>een that Shepherde<U+017F>s. I ob<U+017F>erve in
the apples of thy eyes certain little fires, which proceed from hers, and <U+017F>he hath
al<U+017F>o left there certain touches of her image. There would have been much more,
had not her face been bound up, which mu<U+017F>t have hindred thee to have a full <U+017F>ight
of her. <hi>Philiris</hi> <U+017F>aid nothing to that, for he knew not what to an<U+017F>wer to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thought by that, he granted <hi>Charite</hi> to be <U+017F>till bound up; <U+017F>o that he
was well content to be <U+017F>o too; for he had not yet taken of his handkercher from
off his left eye, and he was of opinion, it was rather an ornament to him then an
inconvenience.</p>

way into a little Thicket hard by the Ca<U+017F>tle, where they
found <hi>Orontes, Florida, Leonora, Angelica, An<U+017F>elme</hi> and
<hi>Montenor,</hi> who had had notice that the a<U+017F><U+017F>embly of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
was to be there. <hi>Angelica</hi> pre<U+017F>ently acquainted <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was well: whereat he was <U+017F>o joyfull, that
he knew not how well to give her thanks to his mind for
bringing him <U+017F>o good news. But to oblige him the more, <U+017F>he
<U+017F>ent for <hi>Charite,</hi> who by her pre<U+017F>ence put him almo<U+017F>t out
of him<U+017F>elf. When he perceiv'd her face was not bound up, he immediately pluck'd
the handkerchief off his, which was ty'd over one eye; and cry'd out, <hi>I</hi> am no
longer <U+017F>ick, <U+017F>ince <hi>Charite</hi> is in health! <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t ever be conformable to her: <hi>I</hi> knew
well my eye ailed nothing, as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he appear'd. Now you are to know,
dear company, that there is <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ympathy between her and me, that <hi>I</hi> am not
well but when <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o: <hi>I</hi> would to God the re<U+017F>emblance were yet greater, and

to attain to: 'Tis the <U+017F>upreme degree of Love, to be changed into the thing lov'd,
according to the opinion of the Philio<U+017F>ophers. Now that this thought is come into
my mind, <hi>I</hi> value not my former metamorpho<U+017F>is: Oh how much better is it to be

replies the Shepherd; for <hi>I</hi> rea<U+017F>on in my <U+017F>elf as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was wont to do, and I find in

nothing el<U+017F>e then what I am.</p>
            <p>Had this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e been any while continued, it would have gravell'd the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
wit. But the<U+017F>e <U+017F>tarts being over, <hi>Hircan</hi> had a mind to <U+017F>ome other diver<U+017F>ion;
and when he had made them all <U+017F>it down on the gra<U+017F>s, he <U+017F>poke thus: Knights and
Ladies, and you Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es! Since we are <U+017F>o fortunately met
here, let us make good u<U+017F>e of our time: I think it convenient that tho<U+017F>e who have
run through any remarkable adventures in their life, relate the <U+017F>tory of them to the
re<U+017F>t; there will be as much profit as plea<U+017F>ure in it. Every one thought his advice
very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable: And though <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> had in the morning related
their <U+017F>tories, yet they <U+017F>tood not to begin the relation again to tho<U+017F>e who had not
heard them. They <U+017F>aid nothing which was not plea<U+017F>ant, whether it were truth or
fal<U+017F>hood. <hi>Fontenay</hi> <U+017F>et out his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with a many fre<U+017F>h thoughts; as when he
came to <U+017F>peak of the vi<U+017F>it of <hi>Theodora,</hi> he very naturally repre<U+017F>ented the tran<U+017F>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
he was in: He <U+017F>aid he plac'd him<U+017F>elf between his Looking-gla<U+017F>s and her, and
that he endeavour'd to <U+017F>ee <hi>Theodora</hi> with one eye, and his own Figure with the
other, not knowing which of them he ought to love. At the end of his <U+017F>tory, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
propos'd again how that they ought to regret, in that <hi>Theodora</hi> was not clad like a
man, to make their adventures more remarkable. But in<U+017F>omuch as the more there
are in a place together, the more different opinions will there be, <U+017F>o there were a
many that contradicted him. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> came neere<U+017F>t the mark: For <U+017F>ays he to him,
<U+017F>ince you are troubled that <hi>Theodora</hi> was not di<U+017F>guis'd, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not have been in
the <U+017F>ame manner as <hi>Iphis,</hi> who had only put on mans cloaths for fear to be ravi<U+017F>h'd;
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have been di<U+017F>guis'd out of the love <U+017F>he bore her<U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>o her hi<U+017F>tory
might have been more perfect, and more relative to that of <hi>Fontenay,</hi> there being
a conformity of Adventures, as is <U+017F>een in <hi>Romances:</hi> But it is to be known whether
a woman that lov'd her<U+017F>elf, would be forc'd by her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion to go clad like a man,
and renounce her <U+017F>ex? It's to he thought <U+017F>he would never do it; for Beauty hath
its principal <U+017F>eat in womens faces, and they will much the rather admire it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
then in mens countenances: That's contrary to <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who was forc'd to
<U+017F>eek that in a di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e which naturally he had not. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would have replied to this,
but the Ladies cau<U+017F>ed the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to be given over, as relating to a matter that
were too <U+017F>ubtile and too amorous. Upon that <hi>Philiris</hi> began to <U+017F>peak, ravi<U+017F>hing all
by the naturalne<U+017F>s of his conceptions. <hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> were de<U+017F>ir'd to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the company with the like diver<U+017F>ion; and <hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>aid to them, I know well
that your afflictions are <U+017F>o great, that you will not of your <U+017F>elves be couragious
enough to relate your own <U+017F>tories: But here will I make appear the power of my
Art, and <U+017F>et your tongues at liberty to declare your pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ufferings: Speak without
fear one after another. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Hircan</hi> had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o to them, they put off their
extravagant faces, and put on milder looks, as if really <U+017F>ome charm had had its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
on them. And <hi>Polidor,</hi> <U+017F>eeing that <hi>Meliantes</hi> give him the honour to <U+017F>peak
fir<U+017F>t, began his <U+017F>tory thus.</p>

                        <p>THe faire<U+017F>t City in the Kingdom of <hi>Per<U+017F>ia</hi> was the place of my birth: Nor
is it to be much admir'd if I <U+017F>peak <hi>French</hi> <U+017F>o well; for my father, who<U+017F>e
name was <hi>Cleon,</hi> was of this Country, and had been taken with a Cou<U+017F>in
of his call'd <hi>Luthydemus,</hi> by <U+017F>ome Pirats, who had <U+017F>old them to their King, in
who<U+017F>e attendance they were brought up and advanc'd. Having learn'd of my
father the language and cu<U+017F>toms of <hi>France,</hi> and divers other perfections, I was in
hopes one day to become a great man with our Ma<U+017F>ter. But O unhappine<U+017F>s! I
fell in love with <hi>Rhodogina,</hi> who is <U+017F>o cruel that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erves to be the Queen of
Hell. 'Tis true, there are <U+017F>o many lillies and ro<U+017F>es in her complexion, that they
have not el<U+017F>where to go for to adorn the portals of all the Temples; it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that her body is made up of pearls, diamonds, and threads of gold, <U+017F>o that
there falls nothing from her which is not enough to enrich the mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>atiable
Mi<U+017F>er in the world: but who is permitted to enjoy the<U+017F>e trea<U+017F>ures? Her pri<U+017F>ons
are <U+017F>tronger then tho<U+017F>e of our King; her attractions are <U+017F>o powerfull, that <U+017F>he
draws all to her, and by their gra<U+017F>pings, if a coach <U+017F>tuck fa<U+017F>t in the mire, would
draw it out at one pluck. Her eyes have in them <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong a fire, that one day
looking through her window, all the lead melted, and the gla<U+017F>s fell down to the
ground. Thence <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t her beams on a gutter that was over again<U+017F>t her, and the
lead thereof being al<U+017F>o melted, fell upon a Gentleman that pa<U+017F>s'd by, and enter'd
his head; wherein if <U+017F>he did him any courte<U+017F>ie, 'twas, that whereas his brains before
were light, now they were heavy enough. And the<U+017F>e are the <U+017F>trange qualities of
<hi>Rhodogina,</hi> which indeed <U+017F>he might employ well, but perpetually does the wor<U+017F>t
that may be: And whenever I went to <U+017F>ee her, I mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>tood in a po<U+017F>ture to
run away, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould have been impri<U+017F>on'd; and annointed my <U+017F>elf before
with whites of eggs and Mallows-water, for fear I <U+017F>hould be burnt up by her.
When I had declared to her the love <U+017F>he had rais'd in my heart, <U+017F>he nothing but
laught at it, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me <U+017F>he would never have any compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on me but on
certain conditions <U+017F>he would make with me. In the fir<U+017F>t place, having heard that
a certain Courtier call'd <hi>O<U+017F>thanes</hi> had a certain Ring that made him invi<U+017F>ible,
<U+017F>he told me I mu<U+017F>t bring her it. That I thought a hard task; for what means is
there to take away a thing from a man one <U+017F>ees not? 'Twas reported that <hi>O<U+017F>tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
had the plea<U+017F>ure to go into the womens Stoves, there to contemplate the fair
Ladies <U+017F>tark naked, and <U+017F>ometimes to enjoy them, without being perceived by any
body: He would be in the Kings Cabinet, when the mo<U+017F>t important affairs of
State were in debate: He filch'd up and down whatever was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
yet was not puni<U+017F>hed for his felonies, becau<U+017F>e he could not be taken
in the fact; and if they would have carried him to pri<U+017F>on, he would have vani<U+017F>h'd
away like a <U+017F>pirit. Yet I bethought me to cloath my <U+017F>elf like an outlandi<U+017F>h Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
and take a little <U+017F>hop neer his hou<U+017F>e, being <U+017F>omwhat in hope to get away
from him what I de<U+017F>ired. I had a Che<U+017F>t wherein I had put <U+017F>ome Knives with han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
made of <hi>Remora's</hi> teeth, a Fan of Phenix feathers, and <U+017F>ome other trifles:
But all about it I had <U+017F>o di<U+017F>pos'd certain <U+017F>mall wyres, wherein the hand that did
but touch it was pre<U+017F>ently caught and <U+017F>ecured. Now my hope was, that <hi>O<U+017F>thanes</hi>
would be caught there; and that if he were, he <U+017F>hould give me his Ring to be let
loo<U+017F>e. Having therefore given him notice that I had <U+017F>ome rare merchandi<U+017F>es to
<U+017F>ell, he told me he was <U+017F>ick, and that till two dayes were over he could not come
and <U+017F>ee them. But this was only that I might not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect him of the intended
knavery. I much doubted his intentions; <U+017F>o that I was <U+017F>o fearfull he might come
into my <U+017F>hop, that I kept always abroad, though I had been a<U+017F><U+017F>ured he could make
him<U+017F>elf invi<U+017F>ible when he pleas'd. He came that very day to <U+017F>ee my Che<U+017F>t; and
<U+017F>ince it was not only nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to have his Ring on his finger, but that, to blind
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43725:123"/>
the eyes of the world, he mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o put the Stone to his mouth, he thought at fir<U+017F>t
to put but one hand on my ware; yet <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf alone, his avarice coun<U+017F>ell'd
him to put them both: That with the Ring, to his <U+017F>orrow, was put out fir<U+017F>t, for
it was pre<U+017F>ently caught in the gin. <hi>O<U+017F>thanes</hi> not able to di<U+017F>engage his hand, drew
the Che<U+017F>t to him for to carry it away, but that was well chain'd to the wall. He
bethought him<U+017F>elf, that if he were taken in that po<U+017F>ture, he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>hamefull death; <U+017F>o that he was <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perate as to lay hold of a knife that hung
at his girdle with the hand that was loo<U+017F>e, and to cut off that which was fa<U+017F>t at the
wri<U+017F>t. I <U+017F>aw him afterwards run away, but I look'd not after him, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that his hand and Ring was in my che<U+017F>t. I therefore pack'd up my baggage,
and went to pre<U+017F>ent <hi>Rhadogina</hi> with the Ring <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired. She told me I had not
yet <U+017F>ufficiently demon<U+017F>trated my <U+017F>ervices, and that I mu<U+017F>t find her whereever <U+017F>he
hid her<U+017F>elf. Having therefore put the Ring to her mouth, <U+017F>he became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ible;
and I began to cry out to her, How now, perfidious one! will you now
fru<U+017F>trate me of the recompence you promis'd me? I have brought you what you
de<U+017F>ired, and you give me not what <hi>I</hi> de<U+017F>ire: I have therefore gotten nothing but
my own ruine. I <U+017F>hall fall into de<U+017F>pair, if you <U+017F>hew not your <U+017F>elf: I will break to
pieces all your hou<U+017F>hold<U+017F>tuff, I will <U+017F>lay all creatures both man and bea<U+017F>t, nay
I will not <U+017F>pare the very infects. While I <U+017F>aid this, I heard <hi>Rhodigina</hi> laugh <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
here, <U+017F>ometimes there; and I went about in vain with my arms <U+017F>tretch'd out
to be ready to embrace her if I met with her; if <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>aw a little <U+017F>moak any where,
<hi>I</hi> ran thither thinking to have her, becau<U+017F>e <hi>I</hi> imagin'd it was her breath; but my
arms would clo<U+017F>e again at my own brea<U+017F>t without gra<U+017F>ping any thing. This put
me into <U+017F>uch a fury, that <hi>I</hi> rudely took hold of a little Girl whom <hi>Rhodogina</hi> call'd
her Neece, though <U+017F>he was thought to be the mother of it, and made as if <hi>I</hi> would
ca<U+017F>t it into a Well. This made <hi>Rhodogina</hi> come pre<U+017F>ently to me; and her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
telling her that both hands were not too much to recover the Child, <U+017F>he took
out of her mouth the hand that had the Ring, and took from me the poor little
one, that cry'd mo<U+017F>t pittifully. <hi>I</hi> then embrac'd my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and forc'd her to
confe<U+017F>s <U+017F>he was overcome. But be<U+017F>ides that, this trick confirm'd me that the Girl
was her own daughter, which <U+017F>he had had by a more fortunate Lover then <hi>I:</hi> For
the pains <U+017F>he took to <U+017F>ave the Child <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly, <U+017F>poke a motherly tenderne<U+017F>s.
Yet <hi>I</hi> took no notice of it, only was content to entreat her not to be any longer
cruel towards me: But all <hi>I</hi> could obtain was, that in con<U+017F>ideration <hi>I</hi> had brought
her <hi>O<U+017F>thanes</hi> his Ring, <U+017F>he would not make u<U+017F>e of it again<U+017F>t me, and would never
be invi<U+017F>ible to me. But <U+017F>he provided me another torment in amends of this; and
having brought me to the entrance of a De<U+017F>art, told me <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s through it to
fetch her of a water, which caus'd <U+017F>uch a good memory to tho<U+017F>e that had but once
drunk of it, that they remembred all they ever <U+017F>aw in their lives, even to the lea<U+017F>t
particulars. My mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s gave me a ve<U+017F><U+017F>el to bring that liquor in, and <U+017F>ome arms
for to defend my <U+017F>elf if any one a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted me, and be<U+017F>ides nine loaves for my <hi>via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum.</hi>
You will find, <U+017F>ayes <U+017F>he, a many little Fountains in your way, before you
come to the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Memory,</hi> which by its beauty is ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd; and
that's the rea<U+017F>on <hi>I</hi> give you no water. But as for bread, you mu<U+017F>t take <U+017F>ome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with you, for you are to pa<U+017F>s through places where you will not meet with
any. If you are couragious, your journey will be over in nine dayes, and one loaf
a day will be enough: but if you are a coward, it will require a great deal more
time, and you will dye for hunger ere you return. For my part, <hi>I</hi> will get nine
torches, and will light one every night; and if you be not return'd by that time
they are all burnt, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall think no more of you, but think you lo<U+017F>t. <hi>Rhodogina</hi>
having <U+017F>aid this, <hi>I</hi> took leave of her; and after <hi>I</hi> had <U+017F>uffered many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
by the way, <hi>I</hi> came in four dayes to a certaine River, which I had heard
<U+017F>ay, was to be pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, to goe to the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Memory. I</hi> found very
opportunely on the Rivers <U+017F>ide a Tree cut down, on which <hi>I</hi> got, and by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my hands and feet <hi>I</hi> cro<U+017F>sd to the other <U+017F>ide. <hi>I</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner there, but
<hi>I</hi> perceived the Fountain, which fell into a Ba<U+017F>on of white marble: but with the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43725:124"/>
<U+017F>ame <U+017F>ight there appears a furious Dragon, which opening a throat like an aby<U+017F>s,
made towards me for to devour me. I had a club, which I <U+017F>ent down <U+017F>o far into
his throat, that it was not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to bring his jaws together to do me
any hurt. So that I confidently went to the Fountain, where I fill'd my ve<U+017F><U+017F>el,
and expected the Mon<U+017F>ter with <U+017F>word in hand. He ru<U+017F>h'd upon me <U+017F>o violently,
that had I not given way, he had ca<U+017F>t me to the ground: But that he might not
do me any hurt, I ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf on his back, where I <U+017F>ate as if I had been on hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.
He to rid him<U+017F>elf of me, ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf into the water: but I gave him <U+017F>o many
blows on the tail, that he thinking to e<U+017F>cape from him that <U+017F>truck him behind,
<U+017F>wam over the river and <U+017F>et me a<U+017F>hore very fortunately, for the current had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away my Tree. I then got off him and took my way, leaving him half dead.
I was <U+017F>o afraid I <U+017F>hould not be return'd to <hi>Rhodogina</hi> time enough, that I travell'd
day and night; and one evening was <U+017F>o dry, meeting with no fountain, that I
was forc'd to drink half the water I was to bring her; and thence it came, that I
now have an incomparable memory. The next day I bethought me to fill up my
ve<U+017F><U+017F>el with ordinary water; but I was afraid <hi>Rhodogina</hi> might di<U+017F>cover the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ture,
<U+017F>o I brought it her but half full. Yet <U+017F>he was content, and commended
my diligence, for I was back in a little more then eight dayes; and I had one of
my loayes left, and <U+017F>he one of her torches. I then thought I could not hope any
thing from her which I <U+017F>hould not obtain: But when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw I was <U+017F>o confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<U+017F>he laugh'd at me, and told me I <U+017F>hould not hope ever to enjoy her, if I
brought her not a piece of <U+017F>ome member of a <hi>Shepherd</hi> that had <U+017F>ometime been a
<hi>Tree.</hi> Having not met with any <U+017F>uch Shepherds in <hi>Per<U+017F>ia,</hi> I took <U+017F>hipping and
landed in this Country, where I met with <hi>Hircan,</hi> who hath related to me the
Hi<U+017F>tory of the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> I have put on the habit I now wear, that I might
the more freely conver<U+017F>e with this noble company; and having ye<U+017F>terday met

having caus'd <U+017F>ilence to be made, began thus:</p>

               <floatingText xml:lang="eng">

                        <p>YOu are to know, dear Troop! that this <hi>Euthydemus</hi> whom <hi>Polidor</hi> <U+017F>poke
of, is my own father. He brought me up after the <hi>French</hi> mode, in the
mid<U+017F>t of the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Court; and taught me <U+017F>o many exerci<U+017F>es, that I
thought the faire<U+017F>t Ladies of the world would be too happy to have me their <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
Yet was I forc'd to make my addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to the fair <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> in<U+017F>tead of
receiving any from her, though my <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ions could not obtain me her favour,
<U+017F>o high was her di<U+017F>dain. My only comfort was to <U+017F>ee, that greater per<U+017F>ons then
my <U+017F>elf were no better treated: For the King him<U+017F>elf who was call'd <hi>Siramnes</hi>
was of the number of her mi<U+017F>erable captives, becau<U+017F>e the deformity of his face
rendred him very di<U+017F>acceptable. He would no more be an<U+017F>wered with delayes
as he was wont, and his de<U+017F>ign was to make her be brought into his chamber, and
there to force her. <hi>Pamphilia</hi> having had the news of it, was much amaz'd; and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43725:124"/>
after <U+017F>he had made her remon<U+017F>trances of it in particular to <U+017F>ome of her Lovers,
<U+017F>he went and <U+017F>ecur'd her<U+017F>elf with <hi>Chry<U+017F>otemis</hi> her mother in the Ca<U+017F>tle of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<U+017F>ia,</hi>
which her father had built by the <U+017F>ea-<U+017F>ide. 'Twas not long ere <hi>Alicantes</hi>
her brother came thither; and <hi>Arima<U+017F>pus, Nicanor, Hippodamus,</hi> and I, who
were Servants to that Beauty, went al<U+017F>o to the <U+017F>ame place to defend her again<U+017F>t
all enemies. We were pre<U+017F>ently declar'd Traitors, and <hi>Syramnes</hi> <U+017F>ent two thou<U+017F>and
men to be<U+017F>iege our Ca<U+017F>tle, in ca<U+017F>e we <U+017F>hould not in time <U+017F>ubmit. <hi>Pamphilia</hi> was
now forc'd to make u<U+017F>e of her Servants, though again<U+017F>t her will: For her Brother
having <U+017F>lighted the Summons had been <U+017F>ent him, there was nothing now to be
look'd for but fighting and ruine. We were <U+017F>o ill muntion'd, that in the very
fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ault <hi>Nicanor</hi> having <U+017F>pent all his bullets, drew out three or four of his teeth
and charg'd his mu<U+017F>quet. <hi>Barzanes,</hi> Lieutenant to the Kings troops, had brought
no Canon; but not having the patience to <U+017F>tay the coming of any, he would
needs one day <U+017F>cale the ca<U+017F>tle. His people came off very <U+017F>adly; for we had unpaved
all our Court, and having beaten the <U+017F>tones to pieces, we had made them fiery
hot for to ca<U+017F>t on our enemies as they came up the walls. That being <U+017F>mall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly
got between their <U+017F>hirts and their skins, and did them a world of mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
<U+017F>ome of it falling into their eyes, immediately blinded them, <U+017F>o that they
were forced to retreat without doing any thing. That night we heard a little Bell
that rung at a good di<U+017F>tance from us: We all thought there might be no de<U+017F>ign
in that, except <hi>Alicantes,</hi> who made all be <U+017F>ilent, and told us he was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
if it were not <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ignal that were given us. When there is no convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Letters (continued he) to per<U+017F>ons be<U+017F>ieged, their friends <U+017F>peak to them
by other artifices: If they come to any eminent place, they <U+017F>hew them by
lighted torches, by the number whereof they <U+017F>ignifie the Letters one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
or for want of that, they have a Bell, whereon they give <U+017F>o many tolls as
the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e they intend requires Letters, and <U+017F>o they may <U+017F>peak at a leagues
di<U+017F>tance: This <U+017F>ecret I learn'd long <U+017F>ince, and now it comes very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably to
mind. <hi>Alicantes</hi> having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, hearkened to the <U+017F>everal <U+017F>ounds of the Bell;
which when he had done, he cries out, Let's be merry, friends! there will relief
come very <U+017F>uddenly: <hi>Cyniphus,</hi> who <U+017F>eems to be of the Kings party, promi<U+017F>es
me to betray him: I am very much given to believe it, for he ever profe<U+017F>s'd a
<U+017F>ingular friend<U+017F>hip to me. All admired to <U+017F>ee that <hi>Alicantes</hi> <U+017F>o well under<U+017F>tood
the language of Bells; and <U+017F>ince that we had none, he took a Kettle, and having
gotten on a Turret he beat within it with a <U+017F>tick to an<U+017F>wer <hi>Cyniphus.</hi> We had no
an<U+017F>wer; for as I heard <U+017F>ince, the Kings Sentinels di<U+017F>coverd the plot, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the Generall. He impri<U+017F>oned <hi>Cyniphus,</hi> and having put him to the rack
he confe<U+017F>s'd that he was in love with <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and that his de<U+017F>ign was to have
reliev'd her, that he might have enjoyed her afterwards at his plea<U+017F>ure. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reported to <hi>Siramnes,</hi> he would <U+017F>eem to appear gracious; and con<U+017F>idering
that <hi>Cyniphus</hi> only had a de<U+017F>ign to betray him, and enjoy her he had de<U+017F>ign'd for
him<U+017F>elf, but had effected nothing, he thought it enough to puni<U+017F>h him in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.
They told him, that the King did him the favour to give him the choice
of his death. He would have his veins opened; and when they went to blind him,
that (as they told him) he might not be troubled with the <U+017F>ight of his own blood,
he de<U+017F>ired to be at liberty, that dying he might behold a picture of <hi>Pamphilia.</hi>
The Executioner an<U+017F>wered him, that it was the Kings plea<U+017F>ure he <U+017F>hould not any
longer behold his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and that he was commanded to blind him. Being in
this extremity, he <U+017F>aid it could not but be permitted him to <U+017F>weeten the pangs of
death <U+017F>ome other way. He cau<U+017F>ed to be plac'd neer his no<U+017F>trils the Perfume he
mo<U+017F>t was taken with; he had in his mouth the Sweet-meats he be<U+017F>t loved: He
cau<U+017F>ed to be read a mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant Love-di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and at the <U+017F>ame time had a
Mufitian to <U+017F>ing an aire, which ravi<U+017F>h'd him above the re<U+017F>t: And all this, that
he might dye voluptuou<U+017F>ly. He knew not which of all the<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ures he <U+017F>hould
mo<U+017F>t intend, when having his eyes blinded, they pinch'd <U+017F>omwhat hard the veins
of his arm and foot only with their nails, and ordered water to fall abundantly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43725:125"/>
into Ba<U+017F>ons neer him. He believ'd his very veins were opened, and that it was his
blood that ran down; <U+017F>o that his imagination was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong, that weakening by
little and little, he died within half an hour. <hi>Siramnes</hi> was <U+017F>orry for it, becau<U+017F>e
this man had been all his Councel in love-affairs, and there was not any of us
which he could not have wi<U+017F>h'd in his room. Some <U+017F>mall Field-pieces being come
to the be<U+017F>iegers, they would batter down our walls: but we, to <U+017F>trengthen the
le<U+017F>s fortified places, laid over them our Straw-beds and Feather-beds, and a many
baskets of rags, that <U+017F>o the violence of the <U+017F>hot might be <U+017F>mothered, and we <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
as to the artillery and arrows. Yet all could not hinder the making a breach;
which done, the ditch being fill'd, the enemy came up to us. Whereupon we four
that were the <U+017F>ervants of <hi>Pamphilia</hi> took a generous re<U+017F>olution: We <U+017F>wore that
<hi>Barzanes</hi> <U+017F>hould never enter <hi>Noma<U+017F>ia,</hi> if he pa<U+017F>s'd not through our bellies; That
<U+017F>ince the <U+017F>tones could not any longer <U+017F>ecure <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> the pikes and the <U+017F>words
mu<U+017F>t do it, and men mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>erve for walls. We therefore plac'd our <U+017F>elves in a
rank on the breach, being fa<U+017F>tened one to another at the wa<U+017F>te with chains, having
al<U+017F>o fa<U+017F>tened to the two <U+017F>ides of the broken wall tho<U+017F>e which were at the two
ends. Thus were we oblig'd to fight, though there were no advantage to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
and we took away all means of flight, for to make good the breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
the enemy. They who made towards us felt our valour to their <U+017F>orrow,
and were forced to retreat. The wor<U+017F>t on't was, that we could not pur<U+017F>ue them;
but <hi>Alicantes</hi> who was loo<U+017F>e, made bold with half a <U+017F>core <U+017F>ouldiers to <U+017F>ee them
back again. He went <U+017F>o far from the Ca<U+017F>tle, that he found <hi>Barzanes</hi>'s company
<U+017F>o heavy on him, that he was forc'd to lean again<U+017F>t a Cypre<U+017F>s-tree; upon that
<hi>Barzanes</hi> run him through with a lance, and fa<U+017F>tened him to the tree. Our <U+017F>oul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<U+017F>eeing their Captain <U+017F>o ill handled, made ha<U+017F>te into the Ca<U+017F>tle, and with us
made good the breach, and help'd to beat off the enemy; who <U+017F>eeing the night
approach, were minded to re<U+017F>t, there being no need they <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty in a
thing which they mu<U+017F>t needs carry. In their return they <U+017F>aw <hi>Alicantes</hi> who was
nail'd to the Cypre<U+017F>s; and as it happens that in the agony of death a man holds
a thing fa<U+017F>te<U+017F>t, he had <U+017F>till in his hand a javelin wherewith he <U+017F>eem'd to menace
them, expecting them in a quiet po<U+017F>ture. His countenance it <U+017F>eems had <U+017F>omwhat
of horror in it, that <U+017F>o frighted <hi>Barzanes</hi>'s <U+017F>ouldiers, that they took him for a
Devil, and ran away; but their Captain convinc'd and rea<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd them. As the
Birds, when they have <U+017F>ome time con<U+017F>idered the Scarcrow that's plac'd in the
middle of a field and <U+017F>eems to threaten them, perceiving at length it is no man,
do not then think it enough to fly about it, but having rea<U+017F><U+017F>um'd their confidence
come neer it, light on it, nay leave their ordure on it, and eat the grain it guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e:
So <hi>Barzanes</hi>'s <U+017F>ouldiers having di<U+017F>covered that <hi>Alicantes</hi> was no more then
a poor ma<U+017F>s of earth, made him a But for their arrows, and <U+017F>hot at him <U+017F>o many
as would have kill'd him, had he not been dead before. After that they did him
a many indignities, whereof we <U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome part; and yet we could not think him
unfortunate, <U+017F>ince he had the honour to die <U+017F>tanding, as became a brave Captain.
Only <hi>Chry<U+017F>otemis</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia</hi> bemoan'd him; yet were they fain to quit their
mourning, and provide for their own <U+017F>afety. We had not men enough to make
up the breaches which might be ea<U+017F>ily made any where in our walls; and if we
had had, they would have been a burthen to us, for we wanted all manner of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition.
We had already made away all our dogs and all our hor<U+017F>es, we were
ready to make pottage of the leather of our bucklers, and <U+017F>ome parchment-books
we had found in a <U+017F>tudy; <U+017F>o that there was no further means to make good the
place; and if we intended to avoid the Kings fury, we mu<U+017F>t needs quit a place
<U+017F>o unfortunate to us. We therefore got out all in the night at a fally-port, and
having buried <hi>Alicantes,</hi> we embarqu'd our <U+017F>elves in a ve<U+017F><U+017F>el that was a Knights
a friend of <hi>Nicanors,</hi> who was very willing to put that obligation on him. We
had put fire to part of the Ca<U+017F>tle of <hi>Noma<U+017F>ia,</hi> that it might be all burnt, and that
<hi>Barzanes</hi> might not be the better for the riches in it, which having <U+017F>harpened his
avarice had made him <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olute to ruine us. When we were gotten into the <U+017F>ea,

we <U+017F>aw the flames, which encrea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>till, and enlightned all the coa<U+017F>t, whereat
we were <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>atisfied, con<U+017F>idering we left nothing for our enemies, whereof
they might triumph. They <U+017F>eeing the Ca<U+017F>tle afire, knew not whether it were
<U+017F>ome of theirs had put it afire, or we our <U+017F>elves through negligence or de<U+017F>pair;
and they were troubled mo<U+017F>t, to know whether we had <U+017F>taid in it to be con<U+017F>umed<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
I know not whether ever they came to know any thing. But I have been told
<U+017F>ince, that having quench'd the fire, they be<U+017F>tow'd a whole moneth, to look for
what gold and <U+017F>ilver was melted.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time we <U+017F>ail'd very pro<U+017F>perou<U+017F>ly, being bound for <hi>Greece,</hi> to avoid
the Tyranny of <hi>Syramnes:</hi> But when we thought we were not far from <U+017F>ome har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
there ri<U+017F>e a wind that quite cro<U+017F>s'd our de<U+017F>ign, and was withal <U+017F>o churli<U+017F>h, that
it <U+017F>oon made away with <U+017F>ail and tackling: One while our <U+017F>hip <U+017F>eem'd to be in the
clouds, another <U+017F>he would be <U+017F>o low, as if <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>wallow'd down into hell.
The Ma<U+017F>ter called one way, the Marriners another; every one commanded,
and no body would obey. The Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el had gotten <U+017F>o many leaks, that there came
in more water then could be pump'd out; and at la<U+017F>t having met with a rock, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one catch'd at what he could, that might a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him ought to <U+017F>wim. There
the men were <U+017F>een floating with the pack of merchandize, and <U+017F>ome had their
<U+017F>ides gall'd wich meeting with boards full of nails. No body had any other friend
then him<U+017F>elf, and every one preferr'd his own <U+017F>afety before that of another <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oternis,</hi>
and all my companions, were drown'd in my <U+017F>ight; but as for <hi>Pamphilia,</hi>
I kept her fa<U+017F>t to a piece of the <U+017F>hip, that <U+017F>aved her from <U+017F>hipwrack; and the
tempe<U+017F>t being over, I <U+017F>aw great fi<U+017F>hes that thru<U+017F>t forward our wretched Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el,
and kept it up, as if <U+017F>ome God had put them on that employment. We at length
arriv'd at an I<U+017F>land, which <U+017F>eem'd to be a de<U+017F>art; and we had not gone a league
in it, but we <U+017F>aw a Fortre<U+017F>s, with a fine pro<U+017F>pect: Thither went we for <U+017F>uccour
in our affliction; but in<U+017F>tead of that there i<U+017F><U+017F>ued out two Gyants, who taking
<hi>Pamphilia,</hi> carried her away more rudely then <U+017F>he expected. I thought to have
gone in with her, but the gate was <U+017F>hut again<U+017F>t me, and I went a little way off for
to di<U+017F>charge my <U+017F>elf by weeping, as being uncapable of any comfort, for having
been <U+017F>uch a da<U+017F>tard as to <U+017F>uffer my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s to be taken away from me. As <U+017F>oon
as I turn'd my back, the gate was open, upon which I put my hand to my <U+017F>word,
thinking to recover what I had lo<U+017F>t; but when I came near the Fortre<U+017F>s, the
gate was fa<U+017F>tned again. So was I abu<U+017F>ed for a many times, till there came out an
aged man; who <U+017F>aid to me, Trouble not thy <U+017F>elf, <hi>Pamphila</hi> is in a place where
<U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t remain <U+017F>ome time, if thou de<U+017F>ire<U+017F>t <U+017F>he may not fall into the hands of
<hi>Siramnes.</hi> If thou would<U+017F>t recover her again, get the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the <hi>French
Shepherd,</hi> who is he alone that can one day re<U+017F>tore her to thee. I asked the good
man, where I might finde that valiant Shepherd, who telling me he would effect
my de<U+017F>ire, gave me a drink, which made me <U+017F>leep along time. When I wak'd,
I was near <hi>Hircans</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle, where I met my Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Polidor,</hi> who told me what
Country I was in; and we came together, and made acquaintance with this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Magician, who hath caus'd us to be cloath'd as we are, and hath told us won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd us that it is only through his means

<hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> <U+017F>eem'd to be angry, and <U+017F>aid, that <hi>Clarimond</hi> was an
ignorant fellow, for to doubt of any thing they had related before <hi>Hircan,</hi> who
was <U+017F>o learned, that he knew the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret things, and could convince them of
fal<U+017F>hood, if they were guilty of any <U+017F>uch thing. The Magcian thereupon confirm'd

Shepherd that was chang'd into a Tree, or if you will, a bough of a tree that <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
was a Shepherd. She will haply content her <U+017F>elf with that of a tree; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
a Shepherde<U+017F>s was <U+017F>ometimes metamorphos'd, as there are enough in this

one of them <U+017F>hall give us what we de<U+017F>ire, either by fair means or foul. It
comes into my minde, that a while <U+017F>ince you complain'd to me of the incredulity
of <U+017F>ome, who deny that a humane creature can be chang'd into a tree; I promis'd
you to bring them out of their error, and <U+017F>ince there are <U+017F>ome of them here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent,
I am content for their <U+017F>akes to do a miracle, and to <U+017F>hew you even in broad
day, a Divinity which never appears to the eyes of men, if my charms do not force
it. You will oblige us all infinitely, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> begin your enchantments when
you plea<U+017F>e, you never had a fairer occa<U+017F>ion to make u<U+017F>e of them.</p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Hircan</hi> ri<U+017F>es out of his place, and taking out of his pocket a High-Dutch
Book, he began to read a loud ten or twelve lines. The Ladies, who knew
he was no Magician, were yet <U+017F>omewhat afraid to hear him pronounce <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ort
of <U+017F>trange words, which they all took for the names of Devils; and they were
ready to run away, had not <hi>Orontes</hi> rea<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd them, by whi<U+017F>pering <U+017F>omewhat to
them. No body therefore <U+017F>tirr'd, except <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who for very fear began to take
his way. <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> ran after him, and brought him back to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
telling him he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tay and <U+017F>ee if <hi>Hircan</hi> could make a <hi>Hamadryad</hi> appear,
<U+017F>ince he was one of tho<U+017F>e that did not believe there were any in the world. <hi>I</hi> will
not <U+017F>ee any of tho<U+017F>e creatures, reply'd he, <hi>I</hi> had rather grant my Ma<U+017F>ter that there
are abundance in this very Country; and that <hi>I</hi> have <U+017F>een but too many to my
<U+017F>orrow one night that <hi>I</hi> was in his company: But if you will force me to <U+017F>tay here
to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch <U+017F>he-devils, give me fir<U+017F>t leave to go <U+017F>omewhere and get <U+017F>ome <U+017F>alt: for
<hi>I</hi> remember that my great Aunt talking to me one night by the fire <U+017F>ide when <hi>I</hi>
was little, told me, how that a certain man, being gotten into an a<U+017F><U+017F>embly of
Witches, where there was good chear enough, ask'd of tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>erved, for <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>alt, <U+017F>eeing there was none, and that the fea<U+017F>t <U+017F>eem'd to be imperfect without it;
be<U+017F>ides, you know well enough, that in <U+017F>ome hou<U+017F>es, when the <U+017F>alt-<U+017F>eller is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among other nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary things at meal, they bid the men or maids take a ladder,
for to <U+017F>ee what is wanting at the table. Now they brought to this man a <U+017F>alt-<U+017F>eller
full of the crum of bread; <U+017F>eeing which, he cry'd out, O my God! <U+017F>hall <hi>I</hi> have no
<U+017F>alt? which done, all that were pre<U+017F>ent vani<U+017F>h'd. By this it is known, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
hate <U+017F>alt, and that they will not <U+017F>tay in the place where there is any, nor where
it is <U+017F>poken of, becau<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>pirits of di<U+017F>cord, and that <U+017F>alt is an embleme of
concord, witne<U+017F>s the proverb, which <U+017F>aies, that to know a man well, a man <U+017F>hould
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43725:126"/>
eat a bu<U+017F>hel of <U+017F>alt with him. Now there is no body can know <U+017F>o fraudulent a bea<U+017F>t
as the Devil, for a man never eats any <U+017F>alt with him: Since I know 'tis a thing he
hates <U+017F>o much, I would have <U+017F>ome to make him fly away; I pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>tart away
a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as there is any mention of tho<U+017F>e black Angels. <hi>Carmelin</hi> is <U+017F>o learned to day,
that a man cannot confute him, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> he draws con<U+017F>equences from every
thing; and yet I will not <U+017F>uffer him to go for any <U+017F>alt at pre<U+017F>ent, nor <U+017F>eek for any
other <U+017F>ubtilty that might make the <hi>Hamadryad</hi> vani<U+017F>h, <U+017F>ince it is our de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee
her, and that there is no danger to <U+017F>tay. She'll come alone, and we are a great many
to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t her, if <U+017F>he were minded to do us any mi<U+017F>chief; and be<U+017F>ides, there's no <U+017F>uch
fear of Spirits in the day as in the night.</p>
            <p>I know not whether the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons prevail'd with <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but he was forc'd to
<U+017F>tay, for <hi>Philiris</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> held him fa<U+017F>t by the arms. <hi>Hircan</hi> in the mean time
reading his book, made <U+017F>ome figures on the ground with a rod he had; and at
length he with a loud and cleer voice cries out, <hi>Fair Hamadryad! fair Cherry-tree
Nymph! I conjure thee by</hi> Horta <hi>Godde<U+017F>s of the Gardens, and by</hi> Pan <hi>God of the Fields,
immediately to appear here in a vi<U+017F>ible and delightfull form, <U+017F>o that thou frighten
no body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every one then look'd about, not knowing what would happen; and <hi>Hircan</hi>
having iterated his conjuration three times, there i<U+017F><U+017F>ued a mon<U+017F>trous <U+017F>hape of a
Woman out of the thicke<U+017F>t part of the Thicket. She was coif'd with green mo<U+017F>s;
her face was nothing but flat bark, wherein there were holes, two for the eyes, and
one for the mouth, without any appearance of no<U+017F>e. All her body was in the <U+017F>ame
manner cover'd with barks of tree, which were di<U+017F>pos'd like the <U+017F>cales on a fi<U+017F>hes
back; <U+017F>o that this <hi>Hamadryad</hi> cau<U+017F>ing them by her frisking to knock and beat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
made no <U+017F>mall noi<U+017F>e. By this <U+017F>tirring to and fro, a piece of bark broke off,
and <hi>Hircan</hi> very carefully taking it up, Be of good comfort, <U+017F>ays he to <hi>Polidor;</hi>
<U+017F>ee here the <hi>Hamadryad</hi> grants your de<U+017F>ire. This wood I e<U+017F>teem very excellent;
for to obtain which I doubt not but your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s hath made you undertake this
great journey: When <U+017F>he hath it once, <U+017F>he will make handles for knives with it,
or haply <U+017F>he will <U+017F>tamp it for to make a drug of it for <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret receipt. Now you
that are pre<U+017F>ent, con<U+017F>ider well the <hi>Hamadryad,</hi> and henceforth give credit to <U+017F>acred
my<U+017F>teries.</p>
            <p>The no<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s <hi>Nymph</hi> danc'd all the while he <U+017F>aid this, and at la<U+017F>t having taken a
turn about the company, <U+017F>he went away the <U+017F>ame way <U+017F>he came, leaving all much
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>ht at the <U+017F>ubtilty of <hi>Hircan.</hi> It was a Servant-maid of the Nymph <hi>Lucida,</hi>
who was lately become the Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Amaryllis.</hi> The Magician had cau<U+017F>ed her
to be <U+017F>o di<U+017F>guis'd, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had <U+017F>poken to him of <hi>Clarimond's</hi> incredulity.
They had made her a Mask of Bark, and a Gown of a many pieces of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tuffe
fa<U+017F>tened together; and <hi>Hircan</hi> having made <U+017F>ign to <U+017F>ome of his people to make
her be ready, <U+017F>he came ju<U+017F>t in the nick.</p>
            <p>Here was <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> as prettily cheated as ever he was in his life; and the Nymph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
retired, there was only one <U+017F>mall <U+017F>cruple that troubled his mind. I pray you tell
me one thing, <U+017F>ays he to <hi>Hircan;</hi> why hath this <hi>Hamadryad</hi> appeared now with
<U+017F>uch a rough face and gro<U+017F>s body, whereas when I was a Tree I <U+017F>aw her every night
in a form fair and favourable enough. That fault is only to be imputed to your
eyes, replies <hi>Hircan;</hi> you were then a <hi>Demy-god</hi> of the Forre<U+017F>ts, but now you are
a man, and cannot <U+017F>ee through the veils which cover the Deities. Now that none of
all that are here pre<U+017F>ent may doubt of the greatne<U+017F>s of my power, I will re<U+017F>tore to
this Hamadryad her humane nature which <U+017F>he <U+017F>ometimes had; nor indeed is it the
will of Fate <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould alwayes live within a tree. <hi>Hircan</hi> having <U+017F>aid this, read
<U+017F>omwhat in his book, and then call'd, <hi>O Hamadryad! I command thee to become a
Maid, and that immediately there appear</hi> Amaryllis<hi>'s Maid in her ordinary cloaths.</hi>
Behold her that <U+017F>ometimes was an <hi>Hamadryad!</hi> cries out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I know her well
enough again: Oh how great is the power of <hi>Hircan!</hi> You <U+017F>ee, an<U+017F>wers the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,
that this <hi>Cherry-Nymph</hi> hath been very ea<U+017F>ie to transform; <U+017F>he hath not
been <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinate as you, who put me to <U+017F>o much trouble, that I was forc'd to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43725:127"/>
conjure the winds to come and bring you down. I was afraid to lo<U+017F>e any thing
of my felicity by change of form, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> you know it better then my
<U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was interrupted by the arrival of the Nymph, whom all called <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>etta.</hi>
When <U+017F>he was come neer <hi>Polidor,</hi> he fell on his knees before her and humbly
thank'd her for the wood <U+017F>he had be<U+017F>towed on him. She knew not how to return
his complement, and was bu<U+017F>ie to hearken to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who ask'd <hi>Hircan</hi> if there
were no means to re<U+017F>tore their former <U+017F>hapes to the <hi>Cypre<U+017F>s</hi> and the <hi>Apricock-Nymph.</hi>
He an<U+017F>wer'd, that Fate had ordain'd it otherwi<U+017F>e; but the rea<U+017F>on was,
becau<U+017F>e the Youth that plaid on the Violin was gone from him, and the other <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madryad</hi>
was gone with <hi>Synopa,</hi> whom the evening before <U+017F>he waited for in the
coach, while that Nymph <U+017F>poke to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> under the name of <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and when <U+017F>he parted from them without bidding them farewell, to <U+017F>hew the
more indifferencie in the vexation <U+017F>he was then in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> in this mean time was perpetually pulling his Ma<U+017F>ter by the <U+017F>leeve,
which the other took no notice of; but at la<U+017F>t being forc'd to turn his head, he
ask'd him what he would have. My ma<U+017F>ter! <U+017F>ays he to him, Methinks this <hi>Li<U+017F>etta</hi>
is as good as another; tell me whether it will be convenient for me to fall in love
with her. Ha! <hi>incon<U+017F>tant</hi> wretch, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I <U+017F>ee thou would<U+017F>t be perpetually
agitated among the divers <U+017F>ighings of the Nymphs, like a leaf by the breathings of
the winds: Know that <hi>Fidelity</hi> honours men with eternal renown, and that
thou ought'<U+017F>t to love thy <hi>Parthenice</hi> to the death, if thou de<U+017F>ire<U+017F>t to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to Po<U+017F>terity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> was much troubled at this an<U+017F>wer, for he could not be content to have
a <U+017F>tone for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e ki<U+017F><U+017F>es were cold and rough. Yet had he not the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
to reply, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Philiris</hi> came and told him he mu<U+017F>t do what his ma<U+017F>ter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him. And in the mean time <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> viewing all the company one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<U+017F>poke to them to this purpo<U+017F>e. As for <hi>Orontes, Florida,</hi> and <hi>Leonora,</hi> who
have already gone through the ardors of youth, they are not oblig'd to relate their
Loves; they are here only to judge of ours. As for <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> I know
<U+017F>omwhat of their affairs, <hi>Fontenay, Philiris, Polidor,</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> have already
related their <U+017F>tories. I know well enough that of <hi>Li<U+017F>etta,</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e called the
<hi>Cherry-Nymph: Hircan's</hi> life is well known: <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath nothing worth the
telling us. Therefore there remains none but the Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Amaryllis</hi> that can
entertain the company: We mu<U+017F>t enrteat her to let us have her <U+017F>tory; I believe
there mu<U+017F>t be very brave things in it; for having the countenance like that of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida,</hi>
divers be<U+017F>ides my <U+017F>elf both Gods and men might have taken her for that
Nymph. Now 'tis certain the<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>takes cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>trange adventures, as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd,
if it be con<U+017F>idered what misfortunes <hi>Lydamon</hi> <U+017F>uffer'd being taken for <hi>Lydias.</hi>
Fair <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Orontes,</hi> will you <U+017F>atisfie our de<U+017F>ires? I humbly be<U+017F>eech you
and the re<U+017F>t of this honorable company to excu<U+017F>e me, reply'd <U+017F>he; for I have made
a vow never to di<U+017F>cover my Loves till they are more fortunate, and that I therein
effectuate my expectations. If my Shepherd <U+017F>hould turn his love from me, I <U+017F>hould
be too much troubled it <U+017F>hould be known I ever bore him any affection: There's
nothing more in<U+017F>upportable then di<U+017F>dain, and <U+017F>o much the more when it is publike.
We mu<U+017F>t not take away mode<U+017F>ty from women and maids, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> we <U+017F>hall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
rob them of their honour. There are in all companies <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>creet re<U+017F>erv'd
per<U+017F>ons, who are willing to know the affairs of others, but will not di<U+017F>cover their
own. That is practis'd in all good <hi>Romances,</hi> when the Authors endeavour plea<U+017F>ure
by variety. I willingly excu<U+017F>e <hi>Amaryllis</hi> for not relating her Loves to us; yet mu<U+017F>t
<U+017F>he at the lea<U+017F>t acquaint us with <U+017F>omwhat of her condition. In this I <U+017F>hall ea<U+017F>ily
<U+017F>tudy your <U+017F>atisfaction, <U+017F>ays <hi>Amaryllis:</hi> I am a Gentlewoman of good birth, and
ally'd to <hi>Hircan;</hi> but this learned per<U+017F>on being come to vi<U+017F>it me at my hou<U+017F>e which
is not far hence, hath per<U+017F>waded me to put on the habit of a Shepherde<U+017F>s to live
more contentedly. Your intentions are <U+017F>o good and <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
heaven cannot but pro<U+017F>per them: For my part, I <U+017F>hall do whatever lies in my
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43725:127"/>
power for you. <hi>Amaryllis</hi> thank'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> for his courte<U+017F>ie, and was very glad to be
pardon'd the relating of her <U+017F>tory, for <U+017F>he was not prepared for it; be<U+017F>ides, that
<U+017F>he was <U+017F>omewhat high-conceited, and would not finde <U+017F>port for the other Ladies,
if they did not the like to her. She would very fain have had <hi>Angelica</hi> relate a
<U+017F>tory as well as <U+017F>he; and in this renowned company, <U+017F>he was much more re<U+017F>erv'd,
then with <hi>Synopa,</hi> whom <U+017F>he e<U+017F>teemed not <U+017F>o much, when they per<U+017F>onated the
<hi>Nymphs</hi> of the <hi>Fountains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orontes</hi> perceiving <U+017F>he had no minde to <U+017F>peak any more: The be<U+017F>t is yet to come,
<U+017F>ays he; every one hath been commanded to relate his <U+017F>tory, and none hath <U+017F>poken
to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who is a gallant per<U+017F>on. He mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>cape without telling us of his
noble adventures: You'll pardon me, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> for I <U+017F>ee my Ma<U+017F>ter will not
have me appear among hone<U+017F>t people, no more then if <hi>I</hi> were <U+017F>ome Renegado or
Rogue redeem'd from the Galleys. Thou wrong<U+017F>t me to think <U+017F>o of me, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> for in ca<U+017F>e thou mai<U+017F>t be now a<U+017F>hamed to <U+017F>peak, I give thee free leave to do
it: But what will you have me tell you? replies <hi>Carmelin; I</hi> am not of the<U+017F>e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
people that fall into Tran<U+017F>es, who have already <U+017F>poken: what Loves have
<hi>I</hi> to relate to you? 'Tis true, thou ha<U+017F>t not much to <U+017F>ay, as to the love of <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but take the <U+017F>tory higher, and relate to us thy whole life <U+017F>uch as
it is. And if thou ha<U+017F>t any knavi<U+017F>h conceits, <U+017F>o much the better; for after <U+017F>o many
<U+017F>erious things as we have heard, it will not be ami<U+017F>s to hear <U+017F>omewhat more face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and it will be as good as if we had a Mask after a <hi>Tragicomedy.</hi> Very well,
you take me then for <U+017F>ome <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> do <hi>I</hi> look like one that
could make others laugh? Thou art already worthy to be laught at for <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o
(replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is)</hi> but in the wor<U+017F>t way; for thou art ignorant what a glory it is to play
the fool hand<U+017F>omely; and that if thou could<U+017F>t do it, thy je<U+017F>ting were honorable:
Be not therefore angry, but acquaint us with thy life as thou plea<U+017F>e<U+017F>t. If thou wilt
not fill it with Gallantry, let it be <U+017F>tor'd with Doctrine, and <U+017F>hew us that thou art
indeed <U+017F>o well qualifi'd, and of <U+017F>o good parts as thou art, and that thou ought<U+017F>t not
to be li<U+017F>ted among fools. <hi>Carmelin</hi> having upon that a little bethought him<U+017F>elf of
what he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay; thus began his <U+017F>tory, putting him<U+017F>elf into a more chearful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
then before.</p>

<U+017F>uch order in my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, that they <U+017F>hal be link'd together like pearls. That
<hi>I</hi> may <U+017F>peak of my Father and Mother, before <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>peak of their childe, <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t tell
you, they were born and bred in <hi>Lyons;</hi> and that it was in the <U+017F>ame fair City
they forg'd me; my Father was called Goodman <hi>Alleaume,</hi> and my Mother
Goodwife <hi>Pa<U+017F>quet,</hi> people without reproach, who ought neither God nor the
world any thing, and liv'd upon what they got by making of Canvas: They were
<U+017F>o well known in the City, that when they walk'd out on Sundays, a man could
hear nothing here and there, but Goodman <hi>Alleaume,</hi> and Goodwife <hi>Pa<U+017F>quet;</hi>
and they met not an Alehou<U+017F>e where they took not their <U+017F>tage, though they drank
but a pinte. They received <U+017F>o many pre<U+017F>ents from all parts, that when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home, the belly was ever full, and the back loaden: Alas! they dyed
too <U+017F>oon for me, and <hi>I</hi> have only known their great pro<U+017F>perity but by hear-<U+017F>ay.
At <U+017F>even years of age was <hi>I</hi> an Orphan, and was forc'd to go and live with an
uncle of mine, who would have kept me with ayr, had it been po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. His
caitiff-life was <U+017F>uch a plague to me, that <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>oon had a de<U+017F>ire to put my <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
with <U+017F>ome good Ma<U+017F>ter that could afford me better chear. <hi>I</hi> was but eleven
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43725:128"/>
year old, and was not very tall, nor very <U+017F>trong, and yet my uncle made a <U+017F>hift
to get me a <U+017F>ervice: He plac'd me with a pretty little man, that liv'd upon his
rents; and one that would not keep a Lacquay any bigger then <hi>I,</hi> le<U+017F>t he might
beat him. 'Twas a miracle how nature had been able to make a man out of <U+017F>o
little matter: nor indeed do <hi>I</hi> well know whether <hi>I</hi> may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you it was one,
for he was not <U+017F>o tall as <hi>I</hi> was then.</p>
                        <p>It was reported in the Town, that his father, when his mother was half gone
with childe, was gone to travel; and that having not the wit to cau<U+017F>e the work
to be fini<U+017F>h'd by another, <U+017F>he had brought forth an imperfect thing. For my
part, when I follow'd Mr. <hi>Taupin</hi> (that was his name) I was <U+017F>omtimes in much
fear le<U+017F>t the wind might carry him away as a <U+017F>traw; and if he were to cro<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome
kennel, I had the <U+017F>ame fear he might be drown'd, and that it were as hard a task
to look for him, as for pins. He had no great minde to go a foot, for the avoiding
of all the<U+017F>e misfortunes; <U+017F>o that he caus'd a little coach to be made, drawn by
one little hor<U+017F>e, and driven by a Coachman proportionable, that all might be in
a conformity. When I was gotten up at the coach tail, our equipage was lookt
on with admiration; and there was a certain Citizen <U+017F>aid very plea<U+017F>antly, that
there was no need to go to Cabinets for Rarities, to <U+017F>ee a <U+017F>hip cover'd with the
wing of a flye; or a box compleat in all its parts, that weigh'd not in all the
weight of a grain of Turky wheat; when that without any trouble <hi>Taupin</hi> was
to be <U+017F>een, with his Coach, his Hor<U+017F>e, his Coach-man and his Lacquay, that
weigh'd but a Mu<U+017F>tard-<U+017F>eed. My ma<U+017F>ter was not a little vex'd that he was <U+017F>o low,
and a man could never plea<U+017F>e him better, then to tell him that there were le<U+017F>s then
he in the world: but tho<U+017F>e that told him that lye, would have been <U+017F>omewhat
puzzled to tell him the place where they had <U+017F>een any <U+017F>uch, if they meant not
your Puppets in Fairs; for as for your Princes Dwarfs, they were Gyants in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari<U+017F>on
of him. Yet would he take <U+017F>ome heart, when any body would tell him
that he was a man of a middle <U+017F>tature, and that all might <U+017F>o e<U+017F>teem him: when
he walk'd the <U+017F>treets, he would take it where it was highe<U+017F>t; and if he were in a
Chamber, he ever got up on a <U+017F>tool.</p>
                        <p>To <U+017F>um up his mi<U+017F>ery, the fates ordain'd he <U+017F>hould fall in Love with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
and bigge<U+017F>t woman in all <hi>Lyons,</hi> as if out of a hatred to littlene<U+017F>s, he had
<U+017F>ought for nothing but height, and would not marry one proportionate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
le<U+017F>t they might have gotten children too little. He had already been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to a woman of a middle <U+017F>tature, who had not carried her <U+017F>elf over hone<U+017F>tly,
but he had taken order with her; for having known how that her private friend
came to her every night into an arbour, which was at the end of the garden, he
caus'd the floor of it, which was but of wood to be un-nail'd and loo<U+017F>en'd; <U+017F>o
that the fir<U+017F>t time they met there, they <U+017F>tirr'd <U+017F>o much about, that at la<U+017F>t down
they fell, and were kill'd with their fall, cru<U+017F>hing a poor Grey-hound, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the hou<U+017F>e, and had follow'd the woman. He ea<U+017F>ily obtain'd his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and it was generally thought the whore and the knave were well <U+017F>erv'd, and
that all the hurt was done, was to the poor dog, who had not de<U+017F>erv'd it. Though
the great woman, which <hi>Taupin</hi> was a <U+017F>uitor to, knew all this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, yet did
<U+017F>he not fear the <U+017F>ubtle de<U+017F>igns of <U+017F>uch a husband, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was a woman lived
as hone<U+017F>tly as another. I know not whether it were again<U+017F>t her will, but the
truth was, that in the memory of man it was not known <U+017F>he was otherwi<U+017F>e called
then Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <hi>Radegonda:</hi> now this was her true name; and for tho<U+017F>e ba<U+017F>e names,
which out of re<U+017F>pect to the Ladies I <U+017F>hall not here mention, they had never
grated any skin off her ears. I know well enough, that there are <U+017F>ome malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
people would per<U+017F>wade us, that it was the wor<U+017F>t you could <U+017F>ay to her to call
her by that name, being the mo<U+017F>t known name <U+017F>he had, was that of an ill-liver;
<U+017F>o that another woman would have been angry to be called <U+017F>o, and that it were
not to be <U+017F>poken, without reverence u<U+017F>ed before. However, let us not hearken
to calumny, and let us believe <hi>Radegonda</hi> had no hurt in her, but that <U+017F>he was
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="208" facs="tcp:43725:128"/>
As for <hi>Taupin,</hi> Love <U+017F>o blinded him, that he thought not of any thing but how
to get into his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es favour. He wore Galloches and a high-crown'd Hat,
that he might appear tall; but he mu<U+017F>t have had Stilts, had he been only to reach
the knees of his fair one. Nay, the day they were married, the Prie<U+017F>t unwilling to
be at <U+017F>o much trouble as to ca<U+017F>t down his eyes towards him, and perceiving he
could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly reach the Brides hand unle<U+017F>s he was rais'd higher, he was by his
order <U+017F>eated upon the Poor-mens Box. Every one <U+017F>aid, that <hi>Radegonda</hi> would
hide <U+017F>uch a Husband in her pocket; and that it was to be fear'd, le<U+017F>t being
abed with her, <U+017F>he might cru<U+017F>h him between her nailes in <U+017F>tead of a
Flea.</p>
                        <p>For to find the Town more work to laugh at, it happened that the next day
after the wedding, <hi>Radegonda</hi> would bring all her hou<U+017F>hold <U+017F>tuff to her husbands
hou<U+017F>e; but her equipage was <U+017F>o much too big, as his was too little. There was a
great Couch, great Chairs, and a great Table; <U+017F>o that they were fain to enlarge
<hi>Taupin's</hi> doors for to bring them in: But that was not only requi<U+017F>ite as to that
end, but al<U+017F>o to receive in <hi>Radegonda</hi> her<U+017F>elf, who would have been forc'd to lie
in the <U+017F>treet, had things continued as before. About this time a new de<U+017F>ign came
into <hi>Taupin's</hi> mind, which was, that he thought it <U+017F>ufficient to be little only in
regard of his Body, without making him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o otherwi<U+017F>e, as having but <U+017F>mall
hou<U+017F>hold<U+017F>tuff: He therefore gave order to make every thing great, de<U+017F>iring, as
he <U+017F>aid, to imitate <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who had been called the <hi>great,</hi>
though he were but little; and had us'd no other invention to make po<U+017F>terity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he was of an high <U+017F>tature, but by leaving at the ends of his Conque<U+017F>ts <U+017F>uch
Arms as <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve a Gyant, as if they had been his own. <hi>Taupin</hi> accordingly
thenceforward made him<U+017F>elf great Doublets, and great Breeches, and long Cloaks,
which he <U+017F>eldom wore, but laid them up in his Wardrobe for a Bravado, that
tho<U+017F>e which <U+017F>aw them might think he was no <U+017F>mall per<U+017F>on. He <U+017F>tudied nothing
<U+017F>o much as to <U+017F>eem rich, that <U+017F>o it might be <U+017F>aid he were <U+017F>ome <hi>great</hi> man; and
out of a de<U+017F>ire not to be mentioned without <U+017F>ome imagination of <hi>grandeur,</hi> he
thought it would not be ami<U+017F>s to make his name up from two <U+017F>yllables to <U+017F>ix or
<U+017F>even, and to be call'd <hi>La Taupinicre</hi> in<U+017F>tead of <hi>Taupin.</hi> For my part, I was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pleas'd with this change, but in as much as I hoped there might al<U+017F>o be
an increa<U+017F>e in the hou<U+017F>e-keeping as well as in the other things; for a great Body,
<U+017F>uch as <hi>Radegonda's,</hi> doth nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily require more meat to nouri<U+017F>h it then a little
one, <U+017F>uch as her husbands; and thence did I propo<U+017F>e to my <U+017F>elf that my belly might
fare better then it did before with my ma<U+017F>ter, who when he fed alone caus'd but a
very <U+017F>mall matter to be provided, thinking his <U+017F>ervants had been as <U+017F>mall feeders
as him<U+017F>elf.</p>
                        <p>The advantage which be<U+017F>ides came to me by this marriage, was, that his wife
being a charitable woman, put me to learn to read and write, hoping to bring me
to <U+017F>ome good. As for <hi>Taupin,</hi> I know not whether he had any de<U+017F>ire to put me
forward: But one thing I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay for him, he ever kept what he promis'd;
but let me explain my <U+017F>elf, I mean that if he promi<U+017F>ed you any thing, he kept it
<U+017F>o well that he would never give it you. And this is the rea<U+017F>on I did not much
<U+017F>tick to anger him divers times together. One day above all, being in his Country-hou<U+017F>e,
and having <U+017F>ent me to <hi>Lyons</hi> to buy <U+017F>ome provi<U+017F>ions, he asked me at my
return, what they <U+017F>aid in the Town when I came out? They <U+017F>aid Evening-prayer,
Sir, <U+017F>aid I to him. He in <U+017F>tead of laughing at my <U+017F>implicity, was mo<U+017F>t furiou<U+017F>ly
angry with me, <U+017F>aying I did nothing but abu<U+017F>e him; and two dayes after he di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>s'd
me. I have under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>ince, that the greate<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on he had to put me
away, was, that he <U+017F>aw I grew up daily, and that he grew not as well as I. I was
at that time couragious enough and <U+017F>trong enough to deal with him, if he would
have beaten me. He thought it not be<U+017F>t to keep <U+017F>uch naughty boys, 'twas enough
to have a naughty wife, who had now left off her good conditions, and did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <U+017F>light him. When he thought to cry, it <U+017F>eem'd to be a Chick that had
the pip; but <hi>Radegonda</hi> had a voice that fill'd his ears as if it had been the <U+017F>ound
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43725:129"/>
of a bell. She by way of abu<U+017F>e would ask him, Who's that below? or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>he
would <U+017F>ay to him, How's this, that I hear you <U+017F>peak, and cannot <U+017F>ee you? I have
been told, that one day being in a fury, <U+017F>he look'd for him all the hou<U+017F>e over for
to whip him: He <U+017F>ometimes hid him<U+017F>elf in a Rats ne<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>ometimes in a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard;
but at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>hifting from one place to another, he was found in a corner
of the Study which the Maid had forgotten to make clean, and there had he <U+017F>o en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
him<U+017F>elf in a great cobweb, that he was taken like a bird in the net. <hi>Rade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonda</hi>
came to him, and having under <U+017F>ome pretence di<U+017F>entangled him, <U+017F>he brought
him to the beds-po<U+017F>t, where one hair was enough to tie him; and when <U+017F>he had
done, <U+017F>wept his buttocks. He would after that be <U+017F>eparated from her as to body
and goods, as I believe he is now, whether he be dead or alive.</p>
                        <p>When I parted from him, I went and liv'd with a Doctor of Phy<U+017F>ick, who
took me for to be his Groom, and to dre<U+017F>s his Mule, and to follow him up and
down: But being one evening in the <U+017F>table, methought the bea<U+017F>t was not well.
I went and told my ma<U+017F>ter that his mule had caught a cold, and had a cough; I
ask'd him what he thought fit I <U+017F>hould do to her. Put my night-cap on her head,
an<U+017F>wer'd he. I pre<U+017F>ently believ'd that the Doctor was <U+017F>o skilfull, that all that he
pre<U+017F>cribed mu<U+017F>t infallibly be done: be<U+017F>ides that, I thought it not ami<U+017F>s to keep
the Bea<U+017F>t warm. But her head being too big for the cap, I came and told my
ma<U+017F>ter that his cap was too little, and that but one ear could get in. He was much
taken with the <U+017F>implicity of my youth, which hath furni<U+017F>hed him with <U+017F>tories to
divert his Patients; for he cured them as much by his merry Conceits, as by his
Receits. His Mule having afterwards been well dre<U+017F>s'd by a Farrier, I wondred
to <U+017F>ee that a Phy<U+017F>itian could cure men, and not cure bea<U+017F>ts. The plea<U+017F>ant humour
of him I <U+017F>erved, was indeed enough to make me love him. 'Twas he, who having
<U+017F>een the urine of a <U+017F>ick woman which was brought him by a Country-fellow, ask'd
him twice as much as he was wont to take. Why do you ask me <U+017F>o much, Mr.
Doctor? <U+017F>ays the Country-man. Becau<U+017F>e I have <U+017F>een two urines, friend, an<U+017F>wered
he; I have <U+017F>een that of your wife, and that of your dog that hath ju<U+017F>t now pi<U+017F>s'd
again<U+017F>t my carpet.</p>
                        <p>In as much as at that time I was of an humour jovial enough, I was much
pleas'd with the<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ant rencontres, and I was ever very proud to learn <U+017F>ome
good word. But all that did but <U+017F>atisfie the mind, and nor the body: I could ea<U+017F>ily
perceive a decay as to the good condition of the <U+017F>heath of my <U+017F>oul, and the mould
of my doublet grew le<U+017F>s and le<U+017F>s. The Doctor <U+017F>o pe<U+017F>ter'd my head with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Ab<U+017F>tinence, and he would needs have me content my <U+017F>elf with one meal a
day, <U+017F>o to rid my <U+017F>elf of my fatne<U+017F>s, and be more nimble to run after him. Could
his Mule have <U+017F>poken, <U+017F>he would have complain'd of his niggardline<U+017F>s as well as I;
and as for her being <U+017F>ick, it was purely for want of meat. The Doctor never went
into any hou<U+017F>e, but coming out he brought away <U+017F>ome old piece of Mat for to
give his Mule, who <U+017F>ometimes had not broke her fa<U+017F>t at five in the afternoon.
For my part, I <U+017F>o much pittied the langui<U+017F>hing condition of the poor creature,
that I had not the heart to be her Governour any longer, <U+017F>ince I had more will
then ability to do her any good. I thereupon left my Doctor; and having made
acquaintance with one of his Patients, I engag'd my <U+017F>elf in the honorable quality
of a <hi>Lacquay,</hi> as I was thought de<U+017F>erving. This Patient was a Gentleman who<U+017F>e
name was <hi>Tri<U+017F>tan,</hi> one very ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>erv'd: For being in a quartan Ague, which
had now <U+017F>tuck to him a year, he never went out of his chamber, and I had no
other work to do but to reach him the gla<U+017F>s and the chamber-pot, and <U+017F>ome other
nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries. His conver<U+017F>ation was very plea<U+017F>ant: <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Solitude</hi> had
half made him an <hi>Ideot.</hi> He had gotten mea<U+017F>ures of Parchment, <U+017F>uch as Tailors
have, wherewith he mea<U+017F>ured him<U+017F>elf every day all over his body, to <U+017F>ee if the
<U+017F>welling were nothing dimini<U+017F>h'd. He had a mea<U+017F>ure for every toe, another for
each leg, another for each thigh, another for the wa<U+017F>te, another for the brea<U+017F>t:
And when he found that any of tho<U+017F>e parts grew le<U+017F>s, he accordingly <U+017F>hortned his
mea<U+017F>ures. I was the faithfull guardian of tho<U+017F>e mea<U+017F>ures, all which I lock'd up
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43725:129"/>
into a Drawer before him, taking an oath not to lengthen nor <U+017F>horten them.</p>
                        <p>This humor found me a great deal of <U+017F>port; but I'll tell you of another, an
admirable one, which was of <U+017F>ome advantage to me: <hi>Tri<U+017F>tan</hi> having no other
employment all day long, but to con<U+017F>ider what he found in his clo<U+017F>e-<U+017F>tool, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to finde there <U+017F>ometimes yellow matter, <U+017F>ometimes green; <U+017F>ometimes hard,
and <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>oft. He would needs know whether that proceeded from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition
or no, and finding me as he thought <U+017F>ufficiently in health, he re<U+017F>olv'd
I <U+017F>hould eat of the <U+017F>ame meat that he did, to <U+017F>ee if I <U+017F>hould void the like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
To <U+017F>atisfie this humor, I had brought me in the morning a broath, which I
took at the <U+017F>ame time he took his. We afterward together took a jelly made of
Knuckles and Marrow-bones, and then eat a boild Capon, and at night we had
<U+017F>ome tame fowl roa<U+017F>ted; I never had made <U+017F>o good chear, the change of meat
put me into <U+017F>uch a loo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s the fir<U+017F>t day, that <hi>Tri<U+017F>tan</hi> was almo<U+017F>t per<U+017F>waded that
his diet was not whol<U+017F>ome; but the <U+017F>econd day, having recovered my former
temper, and he on the contrary having done nothing but clear water, he de<U+017F>pair'd
of imagining him<U+017F>elf extreamly <U+017F>ick. At la<U+017F>t he bethought him<U+017F>elf, that to make
better experience, I mu<U+017F>t be gotten into bed as well as be. There was pre<U+017F>ently
made ready a pallet in his chamber for me, where I was to continue a long time;
and this <hi>I</hi> took no plea<U+017F>ure in, but my felicity was now a burthen to me. I had
rather have been at liberty, then have made <U+017F>o good chear, I was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trictly lookt
to, that though I <U+017F>hould have dyed for hunger or thir<U+017F>t, yet would they not
give me any thing to eat or drink, but at my Ma<U+017F>ters hours; and that if I were
to go to <U+017F>tool, it mu<U+017F>t be al<U+017F>o near about the time that he went, and that in a
ba<U+017F>in that was at his beds feet, le<U+017F>t in ca<U+017F>e I went a<U+017F>ide to do it, there might be
<U+017F>ome fal<U+017F>ification in the matter. He kept a memorial of the quantity and colour
of my <U+017F>tools and his own, and all he wanted, was to know the weight and the
ta<U+017F>te. But let that pa<U+017F>s: I <U+017F>hould not have car'd, if when he took gli<U+017F>ters, or any
phy<U+017F>ick, I had not al<U+017F>o been oblig'd to take the <U+017F>ame, to <U+017F>ee the difference of
the operation; and to make a <U+017F>hort end of me, he had a de<U+017F>ign to have a diet
pre<U+017F>crib'd, to <U+017F>ee if the change of diet would change the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition. At certain
times I mu<U+017F>t have fa<U+017F>ted as he did, to my great indignation: but at length, God
took compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on us both, and my Ma<U+017F>ter having recovered his health, gave
me leave to be well too, that I might wait on him on all occa<U+017F>ions: Yet there was
<U+017F>till a relique of folly in his head, which did <U+017F>ome injury to his feet. However, I
lived peaceably with him, and in all the precipitate journeys he put me upon. I
re<U+017F>olutely attended him to <hi>Paris,</hi> where being advi<U+017F>ed by <U+017F>ome wi<U+017F>e and con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
per<U+017F>ons, I begg'd of him that he would put me out to <U+017F>ome Trade, whereby
I might get my living: in con<U+017F>ideration of my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance when he was <U+017F>ick, he
bound me Apprentice to a <hi>Joyner</hi> in that brave City, where I cho<U+017F>e rather to live,
then in my own. I was not now <U+017F>o fooli<U+017F>h as when I was yong, when it being
propos'd to me to be bound to this or that, or the other Trade; I <U+017F>aid, I would
not be any of all tho<U+017F>e, why do you not tell me of a great many others that
are better? It is better I were <hi>Apprentice</hi> to a <hi>Councellor</hi> or a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> I
thought that for to be a <hi>Judge</hi> or a <hi>Councellor,</hi> 'twas enough to be a <hi>Clerk</hi> or a
<hi>Serving-man;</hi> and to be a <hi>Lord</hi> or a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> there were no more then to be a
<hi>Lacquay:</hi> but <hi>I</hi> was now grown wi<U+017F>er.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tri<U+017F>tan</hi> returning to <hi>Lyons,</hi> left me with the Ma<U+017F>ter where he had placed me,
of whom I thought in a little time to have learned the Trade: and when he
<U+017F>ometimes beat me, becau<U+017F>e my work was not to his minde, <hi>I</hi> was <U+017F>o ingenious,
as to go and per<U+017F>wade the Carriers of our Countrey, that if my Ma<U+017F>ter was rough
to me, was becau<U+017F>e it vexed him to <U+017F>ee me already a better workman then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I</hi> will tell you one remarkable thing that hapned in his hou<U+017F>e: This Joyner was
a good big fellow, and none of the wor<U+017F>t faces, and had been cho<U+017F>en Corporal
of the Trained Bands in his quarter; and in that quality had appeared in <U+017F>everal
mu<U+017F>ters, and had with his company guarded one of the gates: This <U+017F>ervice had
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43725:130"/>
made him <U+017F>o proud, that he imagined him<U+017F>elf de<U+017F>cended from one of the <hi>Nine
Worthies.</hi> When ever he had on the <U+017F>carlet <U+017F>uit with gold lace, which he had made
him for his days of Triumph, I mu<U+017F>t have doubled the accu<U+017F>tomed honors and
re<U+017F>pects.</p>
                        <p>Having made acquaintance with a yong man, a Painter, he would needs be
drawn in that fine <U+017F>uit (which he was mightily taken with) with a Gorget, a
gray Hat on his head, with a great Feather, a Sword by his <U+017F>ide, booted and
<U+017F>purr'd, and having one hand on a little table, wherein there was to be a Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
and two Gantlets. The Painter having done this rare piece, brought it
to my Ma<U+017F>ter, and received his money. There was no fault in it, but that the
colours had not lu<U+017F>tre enough. 'Tis true, the Painter told him, that when the
picture were dry, there were no more to do then to take a wet napkin and rub it,
and that would make it the faire<U+017F>t thing in the world; but that he <U+017F>hould not put
him<U+017F>elf to that trouble, unle<U+017F>s he were to <U+017F>hew it to <U+017F>ome people of good rank.
The Joyner believ'd it, and a while after, he invited <U+017F>even or eight Citizens, kin<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk
and friends, to dine at his hou<U+017F>e, and as it was on purpo<U+017F>e to <U+017F>hew them his
own fine picture. When they had quaff'd it to <U+017F>ome purpo<U+017F>e in the Parlour, where
they had <U+017F>taid a while, becau<U+017F>e of the coolne<U+017F>s, he told the gue<U+017F>ts, that he would
<U+017F>hew them a picture he had caus'd to be drawn. He brought them up into his
chamber, where hung this Ma<U+017F>ter-piece, which every one look'd very <U+017F>trangely
on. They <U+017F>aw it was very poorly done, yet no body dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay any thing, becau<U+017F>e
of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing him. But my Ma<U+017F>ter thinking they e<U+017F>teemed not that picture as they
<U+017F>hould, becau<U+017F>e they <U+017F>aw not all the perfections of it, was re<U+017F>olv'd to make u<U+017F>e of
his <U+017F>ecret to make it look fair. You <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ee what miracle there is in
this picture, <U+017F>aies he to the company; I'll make it look for otherwi<U+017F>e. Boy, bring
hither a napkin, and a pail of water. I obeyed his command, and the Joyner
having wetted the cloath, rubb'd the picture all over: But O the <U+017F>trange Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy!
Was not this one of the Metamorpho<U+017F>is whereof the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hath
<U+017F>o often <U+017F>poken? in<U+017F>tead of having a plume of feathers on the hat, there was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a huge pair of horns; in<U+017F>tead of boots, a high pair of Countrey <U+017F>hoes; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of a <U+017F>word, there was a compa<U+017F>s; and upon the table a plank, and a <U+017F>moothing
place, in<U+017F>tead of the head-piece and gantlets. O the great <U+017F>candal there was I
my Ma<U+017F>ter having received <U+017F>uch an affront, before people that could not but laugh
at it, <U+017F>wore he would make the Painter repent it, and that without any more ado,
he would indict him, but he had left <hi>Paris,</hi> and was gone to travel. It was <U+017F>aid
he had in the fir<U+017F>t place drawn in oyl the picture of the horned Joyner, and that
afterwards he had made the Gentleman Joyner upon the other in di<U+017F>temper, <U+017F>o
that the water might ea<U+017F>ily wipe out this la<U+017F>t draught. This Painter bore a <U+017F>pight
to my Ma<U+017F>ter, becau<U+017F>e that being once on the guard, he had <U+017F>uffer'd him to <U+017F>tand
<U+017F>entinel longer then his time; be<U+017F>ides, that he could not brook <U+017F>o great an in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
as that a Joyner would be painted like a Gentleman. And this was the
rea<U+017F>on of the cheat; but that which troubled my Ma<U+017F>ter mo<U+017F>t, were the horns,
for to threaten him with tho<U+017F>e, was to make him utterly de<U+017F>pair, who had a yong
woman to his wife.</p>
                        <p>All the misfortune fell on my head, there being no other he could quarrel with:
he was angry that I had brought him the water <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, and it was not enough to
excu<U+017F>e me, to tell him I had done nothing but by his command. He never bore me
good will <U+017F>ince; and yet when my time was out, I was a long while Jorneyman
with him, but I have nothiag to tell you as to that. I am only to acquaint you,
that at length a famous Doctor, in who<U+017F>e <U+017F>tudy I put up <U+017F>ome <U+017F>helves, taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of me, entertain'd me, for to make me a knowing and learned man. Since
that I <U+017F>erved a Stationer that made Almanacks, as you have already heard; and
now I am in <U+017F>ervice with the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> where if my condition be good, I
appeal to this honorable company. 'Tis well known, what I have done <U+017F>ince I
came to this Countrey: <U+017F>o that I may here end my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and crave your
pardons if it have not pleas'd: As for example, if I have <U+017F>poken of a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43725:130"/>
too ob<U+017F>cene in the hi<U+017F>tory of my Ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Tri<U+017F>tan.</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you not to to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for as the <U+017F>peaking of oyl and grea<U+017F>e doth not <U+017F>pot our cloathes, <U+017F>o I conceive
my words <U+017F>tink not.</p>

            <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <hi>Carmelin</hi> had given over <U+017F>peaking, the whole company gave him a
thou<U+017F>and commendations, <U+017F>wearing they never had heard a more plea<U+017F>ant <U+017F>tory.
'Twas the opinion even of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who preferred his eloquence before that of
<hi>Philiris</hi> and the other Shepherds, and told him there was nothing he could be tax'd
for, <U+017F>aving that he ly'd a little when he <U+017F>poke of <hi>Taupin,</hi> whom he made <U+017F>o little
and weak, that he <U+017F>eem'd to relate a fable. Yet have I <U+017F>aid nothing of his <U+017F>tature
which divers of his acquaintance will not affirm, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> if I have added
any thing, it hath been for the ornament of the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: but if you had given me
time to prepare my <U+017F>elf, I had <U+017F>poken more bravely, and would have di<U+017F>played all
my <U+017F>cience, whereof I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>cattered <U+017F>ome hints up and down. 'Tis a <U+017F>ad lo<U+017F>s
you have not done it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Orontes,</hi> we have lo<U+017F>t much by the bargain, you mu<U+017F>t
make us amends <U+017F>ome other time. He <U+017F>hall not fail, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> But there's none
of you all con<U+017F>iders what he <U+017F>aid of the Joyners picture; He almo<U+017F>t believes that
the change that hapned therein was a Metamorpho<U+017F>is, like tho<U+017F>e whereof I have
given <U+017F>o many examples. And to be <U+017F>erious, he were better be of that opinion, then
to go and imagine that the Painter put one colour on another. I do not believe
there can be any <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ubtilty u<U+017F>ed. It will be a thing more noble, and withall more
probable, that all here pre<U+017F>ent who are a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of the power of the Divinity, <U+017F>hould
imagine that the Picture of the Gentleman was metamorphos'd into that of a Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old,
by a cele<U+017F>tial miracle, to puni<U+017F>h a Knave that would appear what he was not.
To avoid quarrelling, I'll believe what you plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin:</hi> Then, as for the
humour of this Corporal, was it not <U+017F>uch as it <U+017F>hould be, as I have already made
appear? He was not any thing liberall; and I forgot to tell you that he never
made any provi<U+017F>ion for his hou<U+017F>e, for he never bought neither bread nor wine, but
as much as would <U+017F>erve at the meal; becau<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) if he had a great Loaf, or a
Pipe of wine, and <U+017F>hould die and leave any thing behind, his heirs in their merry
humours would <U+017F>ay, That there was a great Fool indeed, he hath taken the pains to
buy a deal of wine, and hath not drunk it up: We'll never do <U+017F>o. I <U+017F>ee then, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Orontes</hi> to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that you will <U+017F>till remember <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of your <U+017F>tory, which
you pa<U+017F>s'd by unmentioned. But where are our wits all this while, that we have
made you and the re<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak, and have forgotten the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> your Ma<U+017F>ter,
as if he were not of this a<U+017F><U+017F>embly? He, who is one of the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ummate inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities
of the world, will entertain us with nothing but miracles; and we have no
need to importune the Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Charite</hi> to relate her <U+017F>tory, <U+017F>ince there can be
but one between them both, and the adventures of the one depend on tho<U+017F>e of
the other.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Orontes</hi> <U+017F>aid this, <hi>Charite</hi> thought that they were minded to abu<U+017F>e her;
and being of a <U+017F>imple Cockney-humour, <U+017F>he ri<U+017F>e out of her place, where <U+017F>he was as
'twere on the rack, as being <U+017F>et neer her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and ran home without any <U+017F>top.
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would needs go after her; but <hi>Angelica</hi> told him, that for that time he mu<U+017F>t
let the di<U+017F>dainfull Gentlewoman take her cour<U+017F>e, and that when <U+017F>he came home
<U+017F>he would chide her for it. Am I not the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable of all the Lovers that the
Sun ever <U+017F>hone upon? replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> My Shepherhe<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>ees me going
to relate my <U+017F>tory, runs away: It is becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he is afraid to under<U+017F>tand my amorous
torments, and will not be oblig'd to <U+017F>uccour me by the prayers and per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions of
this honourable company, as if there were not Gods that <U+017F>aw and knew all, and
would condemn her as guilty, though her crimes were hidden from men. But mu<U+017F>t
the ab<U+017F>ence of <hi>Charite</hi> be a rea<U+017F>on why we may not have your <U+017F>tory? <U+017F>ays <hi>Leonora.</hi>
I have not the courage to tell you any thing, Madam, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but there is
a remedy for that. There's <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who hath every where taken Notes of my
actions pa<U+017F>t, and is re<U+017F>olv'd to make a Book of my Loves; let him tell you what he
<U+017F>hall be able; I <U+017F>hall be very glad my <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ee in what manner he hath <U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf
to work in it: Though I quarrell'd with him erewhile, he mu<U+017F>t forget what is pa<U+017F>t.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43725:131"/>
I <U+017F>hall not relate much, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> for I have not my papers here, which I
<U+017F>hould want very much, becau<U+017F>e my memory is at this time very <U+017F>hort and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Yet I <U+017F>hall endeavour to come as neer as I can to what I have written.</p>
            <p>All being very attentive to what <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay: He began
thus;</p>
            <p>UNder the happy Reign of the mo<U+017F>t invincible King of
the <hi>Flowerdeluces,</hi> there flouri<U+017F>h'd at <hi>Paris</hi> the Son
of a Silkman, who<U+017F>e Vertue paralel'd the Antiquity of his race,
and who<U+017F>e Antiquity of race was far below his Riches.</p>
            <p>Let's have no more, I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> if my Hi<U+017F>tory be made in that
manner, it will not plea<U+017F>e me. When I hear that word of <hi>Flouri<U+017F>hing,</hi> methinks
'tis the life of <U+017F>ome <hi>Saint:</hi> That's the <U+017F>tyle of your <hi>Martyrologies;</hi> you do me a
greater honor then <hi>I</hi> de<U+017F>erve. If you will have me make it better, replies <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
give me what directions I mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve. My hi<U+017F>tory mu<U+017F>t begin in the middle,
(continued <hi>Ly<U+017F>is)</hi> that's the way of all your famous <hi>Romances:</hi> A man mu<U+017F>t en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by degrees into the body of the hi<U+017F>tory, and not di<U+017F>cover the de<U+017F>ign to the
Reader till the very la<U+017F>t. It <U+017F>eems then you would have your <U+017F>tory compos'd like
that of <hi>Polixena,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond.</hi> There are two or three have imitated that way,
and they have done very hand<U+017F>omly. I <U+017F>hould in the beginning have mention'd,
that when <hi>Charite</hi> had under<U+017F>tood by <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s Letters, the extream affection he bore
to her, her minde was charg'd with <U+017F>undry maginations, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch thing. After
I had a while pur<U+017F>ued the narration, I <U+017F>hould bring my Shepherd to <hi>An<U+017F>elme's,</hi>
to whom he <U+017F>hould relate his fir<U+017F>t adventures. That's your meaning, is it not?
but for my part, I am not of that opinion. 'Tis a pretty impertinence, to bring in
this man or that man, without telling the Reader who they were, or naming the
Countrey where the things related were done. Were not this to di<U+017F>oblige an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding
man, who through this means <U+017F>hould finde our relations <U+017F>o confu<U+017F>ed,
that he would make nothing of them. I know well enough, that he who fir<U+017F>t ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd
that method, made u<U+017F>e of it in <hi>Chariclea;</hi> and having heard <U+017F>ay, it was a
fine thing to begin a <hi>Romance</hi> in the middle, hath done what he could to begin his
his <U+017F>o; a way, which di<U+017F>covers le<U+017F>s then any other the matter he was to treat; but
<U+017F>ee how well he hath imitated the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Hi<U+017F>tory, which <U+017F>o many others have
taken for their patern; that <U+017F>aies, <hi>That it began to dawn, when there met a <U+017F>ort of
Robbers upon a mountain, near a certain mouth of the Nyle;</hi> and <U+017F>o of the re<U+017F>t. Here
you have the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>per<U+017F>ons,</hi> and the <hi>places</hi> <U+017F>et down; and <hi>Heliodorus</hi> would not
<U+017F>peak to us like a mad man, relating things we <U+017F>hould not at all under<U+017F>tand; as if
he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, <hi>Chariclea knew not as yet whether</hi> Theagenes <hi>were dead or alive, when
<U+017F>he fell among a company of robbers.</hi> That would have been a fine put-off; would
it not have been thought, that this were the <U+017F>econd Book, and that there mu<U+017F>t
needs go <U+017F>omewhat before? But this Author is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple, and you <U+017F>ee he
names not tho<U+017F>e yong people whom the robbers met with, becau<U+017F>e it would have
been an impertinency to have done it, if at the <U+017F>ame time he had not al<U+017F>o related a
good part of their life: <U+017F>o that to conclude, 'tis to be thought that there is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<U+017F>ome grace to begin a Romance in the middle, but it mu<U+017F>t be done with <U+017F>uch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
that that middle may <U+017F>eem to be the true beginning. It mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F>s'd that
thou explaine<U+017F>t this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s as hand<U+017F>omely as may be, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee
'tis thy principal de<U+017F>ign to be<U+017F>tow all thy indu<U+017F>try to adorn my hi<U+017F>tory, I allow of
thy opinions, but thou mu<U+017F>t promi<U+017F>e me to reform what thou ha<U+017F>t already done,
and to make <hi>Heliodorus</hi> thy pre<U+017F>ident, <U+017F>ince thou art of his opinion, as to what
concerns the order of the narration. For the pre<U+017F>ent thou <U+017F>halt <U+017F>ay nothing of
me, nor needs it, <U+017F>ince there are few here but know my <U+017F>everal For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>

All the pre<U+017F>ence was troubled, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had interrupted <hi>Clarimond,</hi> of whom
they expected a plea<U+017F>ant relation; yet <hi>Hircan</hi> having <U+017F>ent for <U+017F>ome kinde of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
it was thought fit to make a little ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to eat, there came into his minde the late flight of <hi>Charite,</hi> and the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
without <hi>command</hi> he had received from her a while before: That put him <U+017F>o
much out of humor, that he of a <U+017F>udden cry'd out, Mu<U+017F>t I enjoy my <U+017F>elf among
others, being <U+017F>o uncertain of the <U+017F>tate of my affairs? Alas! no, this is the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on
for me to weep, and to live in <U+017F>olitude. Farewell then, dear Company, I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
my <U+017F>elf from you a little, that I may not di<U+017F>turb your enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, he went his way into the thicket, and would appear no more.
No body ran after him, and he that had lea<U+017F>t maw to it was <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was
grown very dry with telling his <U+017F>tory, and would gladly have drunk with the re<U+017F>t.
Becau<U+017F>e he was there, they <U+017F>aid no hurt of his Ma<U+017F>ter, for they would give him no
occa<U+017F>ion to leave his <U+017F>ervice, and there was only <hi>Clarimond</hi> pre<U+017F>um'd to tell him,
that his hi<U+017F>tory was very remarkable, in that he ever had the happine<U+017F>s to live with
<hi>Hypocondriakes,</hi> and that all his Ma<U+017F>ters had <hi>Chambers to let</hi> in their heads; but
he was interrupted to make way for another di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that there might be no ill
<U+017F>poken of the ab<U+017F>ent.</p>
            <p>The Sun being near <U+017F>etting, they all retir'd: Tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Orontes's</hi> company went
with him, and the re<U+017F>t with <hi>Hircan,</hi> who at his return found <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in his Ca<U+017F>tle,
To live with <hi>Shepherds,</hi> <U+017F>uch as the<U+017F>e are (<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> the fir<U+017F>t word) I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,

its a thing <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t di<U+017F>claim, while <hi>I</hi> continue unhappy as <hi>I</hi> am.</p>
            <p>A while after he <U+017F>upp'd with the re<U+017F>t, without any appearance of mirth or <U+017F>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
and his minde was employ'd in making divers ob<U+017F>ervations on the hi<U+017F>tories he
had heard related. All being ri<U+017F>e from Table, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was a per<U+017F>on of much
curio<U+017F>ity, goes into <hi>Hircans</hi> <U+017F>tudy, which by chance he found open; and being
come again in a maze. O the horrid cruelty (whi<U+017F>per'd he to his Ma<U+017F>ter) that <hi>I</hi>
have now <U+017F>een! This Magician hath pluckt off the heads of <U+017F>ome of his enemies, and
hath them in his <U+017F>tudy, to behold at his plea<U+017F>ure: Come along with me, and <U+017F>ay
nothing, I'll <U+017F>hew it you. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> went <U+017F>oftly with him to the place, and <hi>Carmelin</hi>
having opened a Pre<U+017F>s, wherein the key had been left, <U+017F>hew'd his Ma<U+017F>ter three or
four great blew periwigs, which had each a long beard. Mad fellow! <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
do<U+017F>t thou not <U+017F>ee here is not any head at all; and that there's nothing but hair,
where are the eyes, the no<U+017F>e and the ears? I cry you mercy, replies <hi>Carmelin, I</hi> had
but a glance of it, and fear made me forget it pre<U+017F>ently. But hear'<U+017F>t thou, <U+017F>ayes
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> here is <U+017F>omewhat that's <U+017F>trange; for methinks they are the <U+017F>ame beards which
the <hi>Gods of the Waters</hi> had la<U+017F>t time we <U+017F>aw them. That which methinks is an ell
and three quarters long, was the God <hi>Morin's.</hi> 'Tis the <U+017F>ame and no other. <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t
know the <U+017F>ecret of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he and <hi>Carmelin</hi> went out of the <U+017F>tudy, and coming to <hi>Hircan;</hi>
Ha! <U+017F>aies he to him, what wonders have <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>een, learned Magician. <hi>I</hi> have found
in thy <U+017F>tudy the periwigs of the <hi>Aquatick Divinities;</hi> how came<U+017F>t thou by them?
<hi>Hircan</hi> was here <U+017F>ur<U+017F>pris'd, for they were indeed the fal<U+017F>e periwigs which he and his
companions had on, when they per<U+017F>onated the Gods of the waters. It troubled
him that he had been <U+017F>o carele<U+017F>s as to leave his Pre<U+017F>s open; but he yet found a
means to cheat <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who him<U+017F>elf gave him the occa<U+017F>ion. Thou mu<U+017F>t know, gentle
Shepherd<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>aies he to him, that having re<U+017F>tor'd thee to the form thou now ha<U+017F>t, the
<hi>Aquatick Gods</hi> with whom thou did<U+017F>t conver<U+017F>e when thou wert a tree, have ever
<U+017F>ince bore me a grudge, for having depriv'd them of a conver<U+017F>ation <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant as
thine. <U+017F>o that by a treacherous plot they took me, and would have carried me into
a river and drown'd me: they had done it, had I not betaken me to my charms, by
the means whereof <hi>I</hi> made them as immoveable as rocks. Then thinking <hi>I</hi> could
not any way be better reveng'd of them, then by making them deformed, becau<U+017F>e
'tis their greate<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire to be beloved of the Nymphs, <hi>I</hi> made them bald, as if
their hair had fallen away, and having rais'd up the skin a little above the ear, <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:43725:132"/>
pull'd <U+017F>o long, that I brought away all their hair and beards. I afterward let them
go whither they pleas'd, to be the laughing-<U+017F>tock to all the rural Divinities. Ah!
Ra<U+017F>cals, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> how glad am I they are <U+017F>o <U+017F>erv'd! they'll never frighten
me no more with their blew hor<U+017F>e-hair beards. Peace thou, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> 'tis not
for us to <U+017F>peak ill of the Gods, we are not <U+017F>o powerful as <hi>Hircan,</hi> for to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t their
revenge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> after this, carried all the other Shepherds into his <U+017F>tudy, to <U+017F>ee the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
beards; and they beheld them with a feign'd admiration and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment.
However, the Magician <U+017F>pake thus to the company:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have <U+017F>hewn you this, le<U+017F>t it might have been too great grief to you, not to have <U+017F>een
it as well as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi> but had they not <U+017F>een it by chance, never any
other eyes but my own had beheld it; for prophane per<U+017F>ons mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>o much as enter
into this place: Wherefore I give you notice, that hence forward none pre<U+017F>ume to <U+017F>et
foot into this place without my leave.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, the Shepherds went out of the <U+017F>tudy; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> talking of
returning to his ordinary lodge, to look after his flock; they told him, his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
would have a care of them, and that he mu<U+017F>t accept the lodging that <hi>Hircan</hi>
proffer'd him. 'Tis true indeed, <U+017F>aies <hi>Philiris</hi> to him, that the <U+017F>heep you ye<U+017F>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
kept, are troubled that they are depriv'd the conduct of <U+017F>o illu<U+017F>trious a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd;
and that as in the ancient Roman Republike, the earth brought forth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when manur'd by a <hi>Triumphant</hi> Labourer; <U+017F>o that poor bea<U+017F>ts would extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thrive, had they the perpetual conduct of a Sheephook guided by the hand of <U+017F>o
rare a per<U+017F>on as you are; but con<U+017F>ider with your <U+017F>elf, that you have another flock
to govern now. There is that of your amorous thoughts, which mu<U+017F>t be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carried abroad to graze, nor mu<U+017F>t you carry them far from this place, which is
more proper for them, then the place whither you intend to go, becau<U+017F>e you are
here near <hi>Charite.</hi> O God! how elegant art thou? <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I wi<U+017F>h it had co<U+017F>t
me <U+017F>ome money, <U+017F>o that I had had that conceipt. Why came it not into my minde
as well as into thine, <U+017F>ince it wholly concerns me? I <U+017F>hall be troubled at it as long
as I live. To remedy my misfortune, Gentle <hi>Philiris, I</hi> pray thee be<U+017F>tow on me
that rare and incomparable conceipt. It's a very common one, replies <hi>Philiris,</hi> yet
if you de<U+017F>ire it, it is at your <U+017F>ervice, and all tho<U+017F>e <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall have this moneth. <hi>I</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
thank thee for thy good will, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but now <hi>I</hi> think on't, 'twere not
hand<U+017F>om at the pre<U+017F>ent <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould pretend to that conceipt, for that were to be done
<U+017F>ecretly. Here are <U+017F>o many that hear us, that when <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould make account <hi>I</hi> were
Ma<U+017F>ter of <U+017F>ome thing, and had made a fair purcha<U+017F>e, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould be amaz'd to finde
<hi>I</hi> had nothing at all; and that it would be reported, that all the ware in my <U+017F>hop
were thine. What do you mean by all this? <U+017F>aies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> are you of tho<U+017F>e peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that <hi>Traffique</hi> in <hi>Conceipts?</hi> Have there been any to be <U+017F>old this year at St.
<hi>Germans Fair? I</hi> tell thee once more, that that is not publikely <U+017F>old, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi>
yet know, there is a trading in them all manner of ways: They are bought, they
are lent, and they are barter'd; and <hi>I</hi> may <U+017F>ay, there is <U+017F>uch a one, who having
occa<U+017F>ion for <U+017F>ome in a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of <U+017F>ome ha<U+017F>te, as it may be for <U+017F>ome Ball, that were
to be danc'd the next day, would be glad to take up, upon great intere<U+017F>t, though
they were found on the Exchange. <hi>I</hi> know no rea<U+017F>on, why the Scriveners cannot
give us directions where to finde any, it would be no mean gain to them. <hi>I</hi> am
of opinion, that <U+017F>ometimes they may be al<U+017F>o <U+017F>tollen, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
author having had one taken away from him, as he pa<U+017F>s'd in the night over the
Newbridge with his bag of Conceipts under his arm; all his friends went one after
another to comfort him in his affliction. For my part, <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t tell you, that when
any <U+017F>uch accident happens to me, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall not need any of the <hi>Gapuchin</hi> fathers to
keep me from de<U+017F>pair: <hi>I</hi> am <U+017F>o liberal of this merchandize of conceits, that <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tow
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:43725:132"/>
them on all the world: yet I mode<U+017F>tly hit them in the teeth that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the theft. As for example, a certain Poet having <U+017F>tollen an Humour out of
my <hi>Banquet of the Gods,</hi> whereof a many Copies have been <U+017F>cattered abroad, I
could not, when I <U+017F>aw his Ver<U+017F>es, but <U+017F>ay, that it was like <U+017F>omwhat in my Book.
'Twas an<U+017F>wered, that however it were, the Poet <U+017F>ays on his credit he hath <U+017F>tollen
nothing from you. He hath not indeed, <U+017F>aid I, he hath not <U+017F>tollen it; for take but
the pains to look into the <hi>Banquet of the Gods,</hi> and you will find it there yet.</p>
            <p>That's hugely good, that's hugely <U+017F>ubtle, cries out <hi>Hircan;</hi> what a natural ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contre
it was! let me die if I ever heard the like, and if it be not beyond all <hi>Era<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus's
Apothegmes!</hi> The wittine<U+017F>s of this reply proceeds from this, that commonly
things which are not <U+017F>tollen, are <U+017F>till in their places: But contrary to the generall
maxim, if this conceit be in its right place, it's a <U+017F>ign it was <U+017F>tollen. One might <U+017F>ay
this were very <U+017F>trange: But certainly a man that <U+017F>peaks of the lo<U+017F>s of a conceit, by
another hand<U+017F>om conceit, is never to be pittied, for he invites the thieves to come
and <U+017F>teal from him again. I confe<U+017F>s <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>poke there unhappily enough, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> nor am I <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>t as not to believe he hath a good wit when he plea<U+017F>es,
and that 'tis his own fault if he quit not tho<U+017F>e errors that po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s him. All this
is good, <U+017F>ays <hi>Philiris:</hi> but give me al<U+017F>o leave to <U+017F>peak to this point concerning the
Thieves of Conceits. I was a while <U+017F>ince in a company, where one who pretended
to be an able Poet, told me that he endeavoured to be ma<U+017F>ter of two things which
<U+017F>eldom met together, <hi>Youth</hi> and <hi>Continence.</hi> I thereupon calling to mind that I had
<U+017F>een that conceit in a certain Author of the time, which I will call <hi>Salu<U+017F>t,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
him, Pardon me, Sir, tho<U+017F>e two things are in <hi>Salu<U+017F>t</hi> as well as you. You
<U+017F>ee well, I would have rather <U+017F>aid that the <U+017F>ame Conceit was in that other Author,
then either Continence or Youth. That was very covertly and <U+017F>ubtilly <U+017F>poken,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I <U+017F>hould never be weary to hear <U+017F>uch excellent things. You mu<U+017F>t there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<U+017F>tay here, <U+017F>ays <hi>Hircan,</hi> if you would enjoy the plea<U+017F>ant conver<U+017F>ation of tho<U+017F>e
that are here. Are you now not fully per<U+017F>waded, Shepherd? <U+017F>ays <hi>Philiris:</hi> there is
now no going hence, for it is too late: <hi>Night,</hi> who is now in her turn to come
into her <hi>Empire,</hi> hath brought with her an <hi>Army</hi> of thick <hi>Clouds,</hi> who have
<hi>defeated</hi> the <hi>Light:</hi> The great <hi>Winds</hi> which now blow, <U+017F>eem to be in the <hi>pur<U+017F>uit:</hi>
The God of <hi>Sleep</hi> with his Regiment of <hi>Dreams</hi> brings up the <hi>Rear;</hi> and though
it be arm'd with nothing but <hi>Poppies,</hi> yet doth it hope to overcome all the World.
What excellent imaginations are the<U+017F>e! <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I am charm'd with them, I
confe<U+017F>s it; it <U+017F>hall be in this hou<U+017F>e that I will be overcome by <U+017F>leep. After he had
<U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, they a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd him a bed by him<U+017F>elf, and to <hi>Carmelin</hi> al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>o that they
<U+017F>lept at their ea<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>They were no <U+017F>ooner awake the next morning, but they were acquainted that
<hi>Orontes</hi> had <U+017F>ent to invite them to dinner with the re<U+017F>t of the Pa<U+017F>toral a<U+017F><U+017F>embly;
and there came into their chamber a Lacquay that did the me<U+017F><U+017F>age. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> knew not
whether he <U+017F>hould promi<U+017F>e, or deny to go, becau<U+017F>e he thought it not <U+017F>o convenient
to mind his enjoyments while <hi>Charite</hi> continued cruel towards him: But con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the other <U+017F>ide, that to obtain her favour he mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ent him<U+017F>elf to her,
he would not neglect the occa<U+017F>ion to go to the hou<U+017F>e where <U+017F>he liv'd, as al<U+017F>o that
he was loth to procure the ill will of his Fellow-<U+017F>hepherds in ca<U+017F>e he for<U+017F>ook their
company. He therefore promi<U+017F>ed the Lacquay that he would dine at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s;
and pre<U+017F>ently after <hi>Hircan</hi> and the <hi>Shepherds</hi> came and fill'd up his chamber, di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>ing
with him about <U+017F>everal things for to make them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>port. There was
only <hi>Meliantes</hi> that <U+017F>eem'd to be <U+017F>ad: He was gotten into a corner, where he
fetch'd <U+017F>uch deep <U+017F>ighs, that they <U+017F>eemed to hear the bellows of a Forge. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
who was of a very pittifull nature, was the fir<U+017F>t took notice of it, and <U+017F>poke thus
to him: Do not refu<U+017F>e to tell me what thou aile<U+017F>t, brave Shepherd! Is it <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>titch in the <U+017F>ide, or the tooth-ach that makes thee groan; or is there <U+017F>ome kin<U+017F>man
or friend dead? If thou wilt tell me the cau<U+017F>e of thy griefs, thou may<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ure thy
<U+017F>elf thou ha<U+017F>t met with a man, who as to what concerns the <U+017F>uccouring of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
is as good as four. 'Tis very certain thou can<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me much, Compa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43725:133"/>
and generous <hi>Carmelin!</hi> an<U+017F>wers <hi>Meliantes:</hi> And therefore I mu<U+017F>t not
conceal from thee, that it is thy Ma<U+017F>ter who is the cau<U+017F>e of my grief. Alas!
Ma<U+017F>ter, come hither, cries out <hi>Carmelin,</hi> will you <U+017F>uffer a poor mi<U+017F>erable man that
implores your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to langui<U+017F>h? <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hearing his voice, turn'd towards him;
and <U+017F>eeing that <hi>Meliantes</hi> did nothing but <U+017F>igh. Come hither, <U+017F>ays he to him, what
ails thee Shepherd, that thou art not merry as well as the re<U+017F>t? Alas! how will
you have a wretch as I am, of whom there is no regard had, to be merry? replies
<hi>Meliuntes.</hi> Others find a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from you, but I cannot, though I need it <U+017F>o
much to bring my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s out of captivity. I am forgotten, and there hath been
no <U+017F>peech of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting me, ever <U+017F>ince the relation of my Hi<U+017F>tory.</p>
            <p>We are certainly to blame, <U+017F>ays <hi>Hircan;</hi> and you <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> are not the lea<U+017F>t guilty:
For having heard that the <hi>French Shepherd</hi> mu<U+017F>t deliver <hi>Pamphilia</hi> out of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
pri<U+017F>on, you <U+017F>hould have enquired whether it were not meant of you.
But I now a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that it is not to be thought of any Shepherd but your <U+017F>elf:
For by naming only the <hi>French Shepherd,</hi> as it were by way of excellence, 'tis not to
be que<U+017F>tion'd but that it is meant of the mo<U+017F>t illu<U+017F>trious Shepherd in that Country.
But though that were not apparent as it is, yet by my deep knowledge I <U+017F>hould
certainly know it to be you, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who by your incomparable force mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>tore
to <hi>Meliantes</hi> his <hi>Pamphilia.</hi> You will do that which the mo<U+017F>t invincible Knights
could not do, and your Arms <U+017F>hould bring down the pride of Mon<U+017F>ters and
Devils.</p>
            <p>I have ever given you equal credit with the oracle of <U+017F>ome God, <U+017F>acred Magician,
replied <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and yet at pre<U+017F>ent I am to confe<U+017F>s to you that I am in <U+017F>ome doubt
whether you <U+017F>peak the truth or no: For what appearance is there that I <U+017F>hould
do any great exploits in matter of Arms, and that I <U+017F>hould take in a Fortre<U+017F>s gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>on'd
with Mon<U+017F>ters and Spirits? What likelihood is there, I <U+017F>ay, that I <U+017F>hould
do the<U+017F>e things, who know better what it is to conduct <hi>Sheep</hi> then <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and
who never intend to fight again<U+017F>t any man, unle<U+017F>s it be for to <U+017F>ing the be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t
amorous Songs, or who <U+017F>hall give the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t ki<U+017F><U+017F>es?</p>

feathers of an Eagle, and <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>troy the Falcons: The Country-mans Coat <U+017F>hall
be turn'd into a Cor<U+017F>let; the <U+017F>tring whereby the Scrip hangs, into a Belt; and the
Sheephook into a Half-pike. Let tho<U+017F>e that are wi<U+017F>e credit things <U+017F>o true: And e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
let <hi>Meliantes</hi> give over <U+017F>ighing; for it will be for his <U+017F>ake that the<U+017F>e miracles
<U+017F>hall be done.</p>
            <p>Every one admired the prophecie of the Magician, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> among others was
much troubled to find out the true interpretation of it. He de<U+017F>ired it of <hi>Hircan;</hi>
but he told him, it was not yet time he <U+017F>hould know it, and that in the mean while
he might enjoy him<U+017F>elf without thinking on it. All the Shepherds invited him,
thereupon, not to trouble his mind with any di<U+017F>quiet imaginations; and he <U+017F>eeing
that <hi>Meliantes</hi> was no longer <U+017F>ad, he thought he <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>o neither, finding
withall in him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome great pre<U+017F>ages of a future pro<U+017F>perity. <hi>Carmelin</hi> mu<U+017F>ing on
what had pa<U+017F>t, imagined, that <U+017F>ince his Ma<U+017F>ter was de<U+017F>ign'd for to deliver out of
pri<U+017F>on <hi>Meliantes</hi>'s Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, he mu<U+017F>t make great journies, and that haply he would
carry him with him, whereto he knew not whether he <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>ent or no: And
upon this incertainty of what was to come, he had many pretty imaginations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the life he <U+017F>hould lead in tho<U+017F>e remote Countries; <U+017F>o that he could not
withhold <U+017F>aying to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> My ma<U+017F>ter, do me one favour; Tell me, I pray, when
<hi>Meliantes</hi> is return'd into his Country, whether he will continue a Shepherd, and
whether you would do <U+017F>o too, in ca<U+017F>e you went thither with him. There's no
que<U+017F>tion but we <U+017F>hould, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> But that is not all, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> would
you al<U+017F>o keep the Sheep of that Country? They have, it may be, other cu<U+017F>tomes
then tho<U+017F>e of <hi>France;</hi> and then I believe they bleat in a <U+017F>trange language, which

Every one laugh'd at <hi>Carmelins</hi> conceit: but his Ma<U+017F>ter remon<U+017F>trated to him,
that the language of dumb Creatures was not more under<U+017F>tood in one Country
then another; and that it was not given to any to under<U+017F>tand it at all, except <U+017F>ome
Magicians, whereof there was no great number. 'Twas a doubt whether <hi>Carmelin</hi>
had put this que<U+017F>tion out of knavery, or <U+017F>implicity: 'Twas a thing could not be
di<U+017F>covered, becau<U+017F>e of the inequality of his Naturals, which <U+017F>ometimes pa<U+017F>s'd from
<U+017F>ubtilty to childi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s. He had not continued much his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which was like
that before, but it being dinner-time, <hi>Hircan</hi> and his company went their way
cheerfully to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, taking along with them the Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Amaryllis</hi> and the

Shepherds that ever were in <hi>Brie,</hi> had prepar'd a long ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
upon one of the beds of his garden, that the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
might be the more <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral.</hi> There was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
astoni<U+017F>hment to <U+017F>ee him and <U+017F>ome of his hou<U+017F>e clad like
Shepherds: 'Twas <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>atisfaction to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that he went
and embrac'd them all with extream joy. But he was quite
tran<U+017F>ported, when he <U+017F>aw <hi>Florida, Leonora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi>
appear in white, clad like Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es: He told them,
that he never fear'd to be mi<U+017F>erable, now that he had <U+017F>een <U+017F>uch exqui<U+017F>ite per<U+017F>ons

off his Complement, for to ask where <hi>Charite</hi> was. We mu<U+017F>t not conceal the truth
from you, <U+017F>aies <hi>Angelica;</hi> your <hi>Charite</hi> was <U+017F>o proud, that <U+017F>he would change nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<U+017F>o that <U+017F>he <U+017F>wore <U+017F>he would not come with us one way nor other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> firmly believed this, though it were only an abu<U+017F>e; for that <hi>Charite</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd

never quit this <U+017F>evere humor which makes her ever keep at a di<U+017F>tance from other
people?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Angelica</hi> perceiving that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> began to be troubled, <U+017F>ent for <hi>Charite,</hi> but <U+017F>he
would by no means appear; and <hi>Li<U+017F>etta,</hi> who was <U+017F>ent for her, <U+017F>taid with her. This
however hindred not, but that they were about <U+017F>itting down, when there comes
in two unknown Shepherds: They were two Gentlemen of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s acquaintance,
di<U+017F>guis'd, who having ask'd for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> were <U+017F>hew'd him they look'd for. They very
courteou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>aluted him; and the more ancient of the two <U+017F>poke thus to him:</p>
            <p>ILlu<U+017F>trious Shspherd, We are <U+017F>ent to you on the behalf of a many per<U+017F>ons of quality,
who having <U+017F>een the Letter and Bill that you <U+017F>ent to <hi>Paris,</hi> are extreamly de<U+017F>irous
to come to you, for to learn that admirable art of being happy. There are above
two hundred, both yong men and maids upon re<U+017F>olution to come hither, and put on Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
habit. As for our parts, we have already taken it, that we might not appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you in a habit disbecoming our Amba<U+017F><U+017F>age. The charge and In<U+017F>tructions laid on
us, is to pre<U+017F>ent you with the <U+017F>ervice of our Companions; and to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that they
will wait on you a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as they <U+017F>hall be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of a reception from you, upon <U+017F>uch<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> terms
as they <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>erve. They would have already been here them<U+017F>elves, but that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering
there was much abu<U+017F>e in the world, it might haply be <U+017F>ome Impo<U+017F>tures had put
up the Bill, and not you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being overjoy'd at this Legation; made this An<U+017F>wer to the Amba<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors:</p>
            <p>GGentle Shepherds, I cannot di<U+017F>approve the intentions of our brave <hi>Pari<U+017F>ian</hi>
Shepherds, they have done well to <U+017F>end you hither, to <U+017F>ee if it were true that
there was a Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who had undertaken to re<U+017F>tore the world to its former feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
You <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee what I know; and <U+017F>ince you are come <U+017F>o <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably into this good
company, you <U+017F>hall ta<U+017F>te of our plea<U+017F>ures, that you may give your Companions a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
account of what you finde.</p>
            <p>The Shepherd having <U+017F>aid this, every one fell a que<U+017F>tioning the Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors:
one ask'd them the names of the mo<U+017F>t famous Shepherds of <hi>Paris;</hi> another ask'd,
how they found out <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ince he had not lyen at <hi>Bertrands</hi> the night before. They
an<U+017F>wered all the be<U+017F>t they could; while in the mean time <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi>
came in. We only <U+017F>taid for you, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to them, but you come not <U+017F>o clad as
to plea<U+017F>e me: Will you be like that <hi>Clarimond?</hi> who is <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinate in what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
that he would think it a di<U+017F>honor to be clad like a Shepherd? <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and
<hi>Montenor</hi> perceiving that <hi>Orontes</hi> and divers others were cloath'd like Shepherds,
were <U+017F>orry they were not <U+017F>o too, that it might not be thought they <U+017F>hould have
made any di<U+017F>parity in the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly: Yet they were more inqui<U+017F>itive after the news
of the Amba<U+017F><U+017F>age which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had receiv'd, then how to excu<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves; when
in the mean time one of the<U+017F>e <hi>Pari<U+017F>ans,</hi> who would be called <hi>Silvian,</hi> hearing
<hi>Clarimond</hi> divers times named, ask'd him before all that were pre<U+017F>ent; Are you
that <hi>Clarimond,</hi> whom I have heard <U+017F>o much <U+017F>poken of in the <hi>City,</hi> and that hath
made a little book called the <hi>Banquet of the Gods,</hi> which is <U+017F>cattered up and down
in writing? I am without doubt the Author of that Book, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> I
will not di<U+017F>own what I have done. Then I have a deal of news to tell you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Silvian:</hi> Know then, that <hi>The Banquet of the Gods,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other pieces
of yours, which tax <U+017F>ome Authors, hath rais'd you <U+017F>o many enemies, that I did
not think to finde you alive. One threatens to beat you, another to <U+017F>tab you; there
are <U+017F>ome almo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>ell their be<U+017F>t cloak, for money to give <U+017F>ome A<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>ins;
and as for tho<U+017F>e that have relation to the Court, they a<U+017F><U+017F>ure them<U+017F>elves on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of their Ma<U+017F>ters, and believe that by their means they <U+017F>hall ab<U+017F>olutely ruine
you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> neither knew <hi>Silvian,</hi> nor his companion <hi>Menelas,</hi> who <U+017F>wore, that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43725:135"/>
all the other had <U+017F>aid was true. He knew not whether he <U+017F>hould believe them;
but whatever were in it, there being nothing in all this could move him; he made
this cold an<U+017F>wer: You are come a great way to tell me things which I knew before:
I never que<U+017F>tion'd, but what I had <U+017F>aid would procure me the hatred of tho<U+017F>e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
whom I have <U+017F>poken. A man need not be very cunning to gue<U+017F>s at that; and
you are to know, that there's nothing hapned to me, which I de<U+017F>ired not. It's bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be hated of fools and impertinent people, then to be lov'd by them; for to
comply with them, a man mu<U+017F>t be like them, a thing I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>hun as much as I can
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. And as for their menaces, they trouble me not, for I do not think my <U+017F>elf
le<U+017F>s powerful then they; and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the wor<U+017F>t, though their hatred were mortal,
I know a way to appea<U+017F>e them; 'tis but to dine them once, or give them a gla<U+017F>s of
good wine, and they are my intimate friends. The<U+017F>e are your mercenary Clerks, the
pillars of Taverns, Para<U+017F>ites, and infamous Sycophants, who are for him that gives
them mo<U+017F>t. I would fain <U+017F>peak with one of the Crew, before <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch brave people
as are here, you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee how I would confound them. But tell me I pray, Have
they no de<U+017F>ire to turn Shepherds at the entreaty of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is?</hi> They have read his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, reply'd <hi>Silvian,</hi> but they <U+017F>aid it was your <U+017F>tyle; and laughing
at your invention, would not believe there were any Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in the world.
How am I <U+017F>lighted by tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>pect me? interrupts <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> what do the
<hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Romanci<U+017F>ts,</hi> who<U+017F>e <hi>qualities</hi> I have <U+017F>tudied to advance, do they, I <U+017F>ay neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
me? where could they have found a greater <U+017F>upport then I? with whom have
they obtained more credit? Ha! I renounce the protection of their per<U+017F>ons, though
I continue it towards their doctrines; and <U+017F>ince <hi>Clarimond</hi> is re<U+017F>olv'd to di<U+017F>pute with
them, I freely permit him. I would they were already met, that we might have
the plea<U+017F>ure of their controver<U+017F>ies. Be not angry, I pray, <U+017F>ays <hi>Orontes</hi> to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ee
here my <U+017F>ervants have brought in the meat, that will be cold, while you enter into
a heat.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he made all wa<U+017F>h, and a<U+017F><U+017F>igned every man his place, according
to the quality he pretended to, not forgetting the Seignior <hi>Carmelin. Ly<U+017F>is</hi> de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to gain a good opinion with <hi>Silvian</hi> and <hi>Menelas,</hi> and to make them believe
the life he led was very plea<U+017F>ant, had quitted much of what troubled him, and
thought by that means to win them, that <U+017F>o they might <U+017F>ay nothing to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
that were di<U+017F>advantageous to him. He was not one of the la<U+017F>t to <U+017F>et upon
<hi>Clarimond</hi> concerning the menaces of the Writers of the Time: and <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every one made it his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to bait him about it; made this reply, I mu<U+017F>t
needs confe<U+017F>s I have not gotten much from our <hi>Poetlings,</hi> by telling them of their
Fopperies; for they are <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinate, that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for a man to make them
<U+017F>ee the truth; and I have done nothing el<U+017F>e but provoke a <U+017F>ort of fools, with whom
there is no glory to conte<U+017F>t. However, my labour is not lo<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince I have in their
tongues found that perpetual motion, which many Philo<U+017F>ophers have <U+017F>o much <U+017F>ought
after, and have di<U+017F>covered, that in their brain might be found that emptine<U+017F>s, which
was thought impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible in nature. Be<U+017F>ides, I have oblig'd a many hone<U+017F>t people,
who are glad <hi>I</hi> have help'd them out of the errors whereinto the<U+017F>e Idiots endeavor'd
to bring them. As for the fear they think to have put me in, by telling I have to do
with tho<U+017F>e that have le<U+017F>s to lo<U+017F>e then my <U+017F>elf, and affront all tho<U+017F>e they hate; <hi>I</hi> an<U+017F>wer
you, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for them to do me any hurt that way: for though they <U+017F>hould
catch me, <hi>I</hi> do not think it would be any more prejudice to my reputation, then if
one of the mad people that walk up and down in <hi>Paris,</hi> <U+017F>hould quarrel with me; and
as for their railing, I make as much account of it as the braying of an A<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> would have <U+017F>poken many other things to the contempt of his enemies;
but <hi>Orontes</hi> interrupted him, <U+017F>aying, There mu<U+017F>t be no more quarrelling, <U+017F>ince it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the tranquility of their <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> life.</p>
            <p>The company on that, began to give it <U+017F>elf over to mirth; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being in a
deep con<U+017F>ideration of the variety of the meat, <U+017F>aid to <hi>Orontes, I</hi> think, O magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Shepherd, that thou de<U+017F>ire<U+017F>t to <U+017F>atisfie our eyes, as well as our bellies: The
greate<U+017F>t part of the fowl I <U+017F>ee on the table, are methinks alive <U+017F>till; <hi>I</hi> think they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43725:135"/>
are readier to eat, then to be eaten. As for tho<U+017F>e which are in <U+017F>awces, or in broths,
methinks they <U+017F>wim there, as they did in the ponds before; and as for the re<U+017F>t,
which are otherwi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>pos'd, I finde them <U+017F>o lively, that its to be fear'd they'll fly
off the table. To hinder this from flying away, <U+017F>aies <hi>Orontes,</hi> cutting up one, there's
a wing, which I pluck off and pre<U+017F>ent to you. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> accepted it, but having ob<U+017F>erv'd
what pleas'd him better on another part of the Table, which he could not reach, I
am <U+017F>omewhat skill'd, <U+017F>aies he very confidently, in the flight of Birds; I have
learn'd the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the <hi>Roman Augurs.</hi> All the<U+017F>e common <U+017F>owl that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, are unfortunate; but if tho<U+017F>e I <U+017F>ee there at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance could pa<U+017F>s this
way, I <U+017F>hould make <U+017F>ome good pre<U+017F>age for my affairs. The pre<U+017F>age will be worth
nothing if they are made to fly towards you, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> for it mu<U+017F>t be chance,
and not of <U+017F>et purpo<U+017F>e. It matters not for that, <U+017F>aies <hi>Orontes,</hi> let the Sooth<U+017F>ayer do
as he plea<U+017F>e; and with the<U+017F>e words he <U+017F>ent <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>ome of the choi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t, wondring at
the invention he had us'd to bring it about: but the amorous Shepherd <U+017F>hew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
<U+017F>o civil, that he refus'd it, <U+017F>aying he had ask'd in je<U+017F>t, and to try how they would
an<U+017F>wer him; and be<U+017F>ides that, he was not <U+017F>o ill bred, as to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf a glutton
in <U+017F>o honorable an A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, he, who<U+017F>e principal nouri<U+017F>hment were amorous ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>
            <p>After this, he freely fed on all, and in the mean time <hi>Orontes</hi> urg'd the Shepherds
to drink one to another: Shall we not drink to our Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es? <U+017F>aies <hi>Philiris;</hi> <U+017F>hall
we not take <U+017F>o many gla<U+017F><U+017F>es as there are letters in their names? I never fail drinking
to <hi>Charite's,</hi> though I <U+017F>ay nothing, reply'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> thy invention is not new to me. I
have already drunk thrice to the three fir<U+017F>t Letters of the faire<U+017F>t word that can be
pronounc'd. No body hath <U+017F>een it, replies <hi>Philiris;</hi> 'twas <U+017F>ecretly done: Begin<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
the game again. Thou do<U+017F>t not under<U+017F>tand the <U+017F>ubtilty of it, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> Knowing
that if I began again, I <U+017F>hould commit a great fault, becau<U+017F>e the gla<U+017F><U+017F>es I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
drunk, <U+017F>hould be counted, and being added to tho<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould drink with thee,
would amount to a greater number then the letters of the name of <hi>Charite:</hi> So
that <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould trangre<U+017F>s the vow I long <U+017F>ince made to do all things in the number of
<U+017F>even.</p>
            <p>So the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> made it appear, that nothing could make him quit his
former de<U+017F>igns; <U+017F>o that the re<U+017F>t making a party by them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>uffer'd him to do
what he pleas'd. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> every one drank to him, and he was of <U+017F>o good
an humour, that he <U+017F>wore he would make all tho<U+017F>e lyars, who <U+017F>aid he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
and that he would do it to all the world. He had ply'd it <U+017F>o well, that when
he was ri<U+017F>en from the table, he <U+017F>tagger'd at every <U+017F>tep; and <hi>I</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you there were
others that were not much behinde him, whether they were drunk indeed, or that
they feign'd it. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> began to laugh, having a long time ob<U+017F>erv'd how they <U+017F>tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd,
and ju<U+017F>tled one another. The<U+017F>e are good youths, <U+017F>aies he, they are not content
to be po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with two furies, that is to <U+017F>ay, that of <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> but having
read there was a third, which is that of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> they would needs be po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed of
that too. <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall not think it much ami<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o that they commit not over great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olences.
<hi>Bacchus</hi> is an amiable, and a plea<U+017F>ant God, and requires our devotions
at lea<U+017F>t once a moneth, when a man hath his friends about him. <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall by no means
forbid any man to conver<U+017F>e with him, <U+017F>ince <hi>I</hi> finde that the ancient Poetry is as ful of
good-fellow<U+017F>hip as loves; and that <hi>I</hi> know by experience, that there are <U+017F>ome Poets
who can never compo<U+017F>e any thing, but when they are drunk. Gentle Shepherds,
weep now for having drunk too much, to morrow you will weep for your loves,
that your lives may be diver<U+017F>ifi'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>poke this out of his ordinary judgement; for though he had taken his <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
cups, he had not drunk much at a time, as being of tho<U+017F>e that are not much
given to wine. <hi>Clarimond</hi> was not well pleas'd to <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>o re<U+017F>erv'd and temperate;
for he would gladly have known what extravagancy he would have committed, if
there had been a mixture of drunkenne<U+017F>s with his Extravagance. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
he had eaten and drunk <U+017F>o much, that he went a little a<U+017F>ide and return'd it; which
his Ma<U+017F>ter perceiving: Ah! villain, <U+017F>aies he to him, mu<U+017F>t thou offend <U+017F>uch a pre<U+017F>ence
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43725:136"/>
with thy bea<U+017F>tline<U+017F>s? I allow thee to be merry and to drink, but I would not have
thee forget the quality of a man and a Shepherd, and participate in brutality with
the bea<U+017F>ts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orontes,</hi> who heard this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, came and <U+017F>aid to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> You are to blame to
find fault with <U+017F>uch an hone<U+017F>t man: Con<U+017F>ider, if that which he ca<U+017F>ts out be a thing
<U+017F>o foul, that it is a loathing to you to <U+017F>ee it, he hath rea<U+017F>on to disburthen him<U+017F>elf of
it, for how do you think he could <U+017F>uffer it on his <U+017F>tomack? What thou <U+017F>ay<U+017F>t <U+017F>alves
the matter well for the pre<U+017F>ent, reply'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but why had he before <U+017F>o little
di<U+017F>cretion as to <U+017F>wallow down what <U+017F>hould hurt him? I will allow him to be drunk
<U+017F>o far as to be frolick, but not to be <U+017F>tupid. I am not drunk, my <U+017F>weet ma<U+017F>ter,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> 'twas only my drinking out of a great gla<U+017F>s, that hath made me
<U+017F>o <U+017F>ick at the heart, that I was fain to vomit as you <U+017F>ee. This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by three or four hickocks, which brought out with them wine and broth,
which a dog of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s did a<U+017F><U+017F>oon lick up, lifting up his no<U+017F>e every foot to <U+017F>ee if
there were any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> approv'd the <U+017F>pecious rea<U+017F>ons of his faithfull <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and <U+017F>o return'd to
the re<U+017F>t of the company to know what they were re<U+017F>olved to do. They had notice
of a Wedding hard by, <U+017F>o that they re<U+017F>olved to go thither to pa<U+017F>s away the time.
At the end of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e there was a Hamlet of five or <U+017F>ix hou<U+017F>es, in one
whereof there was a Country-La<U+017F>s that married a Husband-man of the next village.
They had brought from <hi>Coulommiers</hi> the great Mu<U+017F>ick-Company, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted
of a Ba<U+017F>e, a Tenor, and a Kit which <U+017F>erved in<U+017F>tead of a Violin. The gue<U+017F>ts having
already din'd, had paid their Reckoning, and made their Pre<U+017F>ents according to the
cu<U+017F>tom: whereupon the Mu<U+017F>ick began to cheer up the Company, and there was
not any <U+017F>o wretched Lobcock but took his Sweetheart into the dance. Our cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Shepherds being come thither, would not <U+017F>tand out; but ru<U+017F>hing in among
the Country-people, they danc'd together, where every one <U+017F>hew'd what he could
do, though there were <U+017F>ome who<U+017F>e paces were very circumflexe, and who<U+017F>e capers
were not above half an inch from the ground. The Pea<U+017F>ants <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of quality in <U+017F>uch ridiculous po<U+017F>tures, and in <U+017F>uch extraordinary habits as they
had on, thought they did it out of <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>ign to abu<U+017F>e them, <U+017F>o that they were
not well pleas'd at it.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Orontes</hi> was weary of dancing, and the re<U+017F>t too, he would needs have them
to <U+017F>ome of your childi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ports. Shall we go to <hi>Blind Cupid?</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to the
company; it is a very <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> <U+017F>port; it's u<U+017F>ed by <hi>Amaryllis</hi> and her companions in
the <hi>Faithfull Shepherd,</hi> and methinks 'tis much like that which all the Children
know, which they call <hi>Blind-man-buff.</hi> But to be more ingenious yet, I <U+017F>hould
de<U+017F>ire we might not fix on any <U+017F>port, but that which Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> makes the
Shepherds of <hi>Aacadia</hi> recreate them<U+017F>elves with, in that long Proeme which is as I
take it in the fir<U+017F>t Tome of his incomparable Work; but it is <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtle, that nobody
can make any thing of it.</p>
            <p>Every one gave his voice for <hi>Blind Cupid;</hi> and being retired a little di<U+017F>tance
from the place where the Wedding was, there was none but voted <hi>Carmelin</hi> to be
the <hi>Cupid.</hi> They blinded him with a foul napkin; and every one being gone out
of his way, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> taught the re<U+017F>t the words of the game. But in<U+017F>tead of courteous
treating the poor <hi>Cupid,</hi> they pelted him with clods of earth, which fell on him
of all <U+017F>ides <U+017F>o unmercifully, that he was forc'd to unblind him<U+017F>elf and run away,
<U+017F>wearing that as long as he liv'd he would never meddle with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>port. Having
taken <U+017F>anctuary among the Country-people, he thought better to be merry with
them; and having perceiv'd <hi>Li<U+017F>etta,</hi> who<U+017F>e fair eye had deeply wounded him, he
would needs dance a Coranto with her. The Gentlemen-Shepherds return'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a while to make up their <U+017F>port with him: They <U+017F>aw that <hi>Carmelin</hi> was not any
thing <U+017F>ick, and that he danc'd it <U+017F>o well, as would have bred a mortal jealou<U+017F>ie in
the mo<U+017F>t illu<U+017F>trious Dancers of all the villages thereabouts. <hi>Leonora's</hi> Kitchin-maid
chanced al<U+017F>o to be in the place; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having <U+017F>poken to her, made account to
know of her a many particulars concerning his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. It came into his mind, that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:43725:136"/>
when he was let blood, it had <U+017F>eem'd to him and <hi>Clarimond</hi> too, that there might be
<U+017F>een in his blood the Figure of <hi>Charite.</hi> He would have gladly known, if in like
manner there was not <U+017F>een his Figure in hers, or whether there appeared the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of <U+017F>ome other Lover. He thought that by that means he might di<U+017F>cover
whether he were belov'd or no. He therefore put the que<U+017F>tion to the Maid, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>he had been pre<U+017F>ent when <hi>Charite</hi> was let blood three or four dayes before.
She told him he was an idle jeering Companion; that <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood nothing of
his fine talk; and that for his full <U+017F>atisfaction, <U+017F>he could only tell him, that no body
employ'd him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o vainly as to ob<U+017F>erve <hi>Charite's</hi> blood, and that it was ca<U+017F>t into
a <U+017F>ink the very day it was let. Ah! what imprudence was that, and what impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
both together! cry'd out the Shepherd: Ought not <U+017F>o precious a thing to
be pre<U+017F>erved? What would you have had done with it, replies the maid, would
you have had puddings made of it? Do not <U+017F>coff, fair one! replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> It trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
me that <hi>Carmelin</hi> did ca<U+017F>t away my blood, for it was as worthy to be pre<U+017F>erved,
<U+017F>ince it bore the image of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. You may tell us of this another time, <U+017F>ayes
the Maid, but for what is done there is no remedy.</p>
            <p>While this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between the Shepherd and the Maid, <hi>Carmelin</hi> was
not <U+017F>atisfied to have drawn <hi>Li<U+017F>etta</hi> once into the dance, but he mu<U+017F>t have her twice
more: And there coming afterward a young Country-fellow to take her in, he
thru<U+017F>t him back, and di<U+017F>dainfully told him that <U+017F>he was not meat for his birds. This
Clown perceiving him<U+017F>elf wounded in his honour, gave <hi>Carmelin</hi> a good blow on
the brea<U+017F>t, and was ready to <U+017F>econd it, when <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> coming between them cry'd out,
Hold, hold, my Lads! will you have this Wedding <U+017F>o full of butchery as that of
<hi>Andromedes,</hi> wherein <hi>Per<U+017F>eus</hi> transform'd the ra<U+017F>h <hi>Phineas</hi> into a <U+017F>tone, after he had
kill'd all his companions? Would you renew the marriage of <hi>Hippodamia,</hi> where
the <hi>Centaures</hi> fought again<U+017F>t the <hi>Lapithae?</hi> I here interpo<U+017F>e my Authority; give
over the<U+017F>e outrages, I pray.</p>
            <p>Notwith<U+017F>tanding the<U+017F>e words, all the Clowns came about <hi>Carmelin,</hi> ready to
revenge their companion. But <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> rai<U+017F>ing his voice, continued thus: Vile rout!
infamous Clowns! dare you commit the<U+017F>e impudences before me who am the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
Shepherd in the world, and before <hi>Hircan</hi> who is the mo<U+017F>t knowing Magician
of this age? Do you not fear our di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure? The Country-people of <hi>Lycia,</hi>
for having offended <hi>Latona,</hi> were turn'd into <hi>Frogs.</hi> Learn to be mode<U+017F>t by the
example of your Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors; for we could as ea<U+017F>ily metamorpho<U+017F>e you into poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onous
toads, or into hi<U+017F><U+017F>ing <U+017F>erpents.</p>
            <p>While he thus cry'd out, <hi>Orontes</hi> went and roughly thru<U+017F>t back the Clowns, and
made them retire. Yet did they not give over their de<U+017F>ign to be reveng'd, when
they could, of <hi>Carmelin</hi> and his ma<U+017F>ter, who had done them <U+017F>uch injury. The tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
being in appearance appeas'd, the Mu<U+017F>ick, who were fled le<U+017F>t in the charge
their In<U+017F>truments might have been broken, came back and cheer'd up the company
with the merry <hi>Jigs</hi> of <hi>Poicton.</hi> See now the di<U+017F>order is over, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I am glad
of it, for it might have been of ill example, and a very unlucky pre<U+017F>age for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
couple. This mu<U+017F>ick cheers me up; 'tis to be conceived they are <U+017F>ent for to
weddings, to put us in mind that the husband and wife ought to live in perpetual
<hi>concord,</hi> and ob<U+017F>erve <U+017F>uch a harmony as that of mu<U+017F>ical In<U+017F>truments. They are al<U+017F>o
to acquaint the gue<U+017F>ts that they <U+017F>hould live in good intelligence one with another,
at lea<U+017F>t for that day, to the credit of tho<U+017F>e that have invited them.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> will'd his company to leave the Clowns dance, and
not meddle with them any more. And having call'd <hi>Silvian</hi> and <hi>Menelas</hi> to him,
he thus <U+017F>pake to them. You are <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creet, <hi>my Lords,</hi> that I cannot believe you will
leave us with any di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfaction: An ignorant man would doubt it, that <U+017F>hould
have <U+017F>een the late tumult; nay there are tho<U+017F>e that would think, that after a thing
<U+017F>o <U+017F>trange and blameworthy, you would acquaint your Compatriots that I cau<U+017F>e
not <U+017F>uch order to be ob<U+017F>erved in this Country as I boa<U+017F>ted I would. But I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
my <U+017F>elf that you well con<U+017F>ider that our Government is not yet fully e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed;
and that having not men enough under me, I am not able to drive away the <U+017F>editious.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:43725:137"/>
Be<U+017F>ides you are to ob<U+017F>erve, that tho<U+017F>e who are guilty of the di<U+017F>order, are not famous
Shepherds as you and I; they are infamous Churls, that under<U+017F>tand nothing of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>ty
or honour, and never read any book. To the end that no man be henceforth
deceiv'd in them, and that <U+017F>eeing them with <U+017F>heep might think they were of us, I
ordain they <U+017F>hall not be called by the <U+017F>ame name as we, but they <U+017F>hall be call'd
<hi>Feeders,</hi> whereas we'll be call'd <hi>Shepherds</hi> or <hi>Pa<U+017F>tors: Carmelin</hi> him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>hall be of
their degree, till he have made it appear by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ignal action that he de<U+017F>erves to
be of ours.</p>
            <p>You have taken very good order, replies <hi>Silvian;</hi> and yet<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> without all this, I
a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till believe we had not found any thing that might prejudice
your reputation. However you would much oblige us, if you would briefly tell us
what the principal things are which you would do to re<U+017F>tore the Golden age. We
are not here in a Hall fit to give audience to Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> But yet
I <U+017F>hall make no <U+017F>cruple to give you <U+017F>atisfaction, becau<U+017F>e it is a plea<U+017F>ure to me to <U+017F>hew
how free I am, and how little I have of the pomp of Kings. You are then to know,
that though from the Golden age men pa<U+017F>s'd into the Silver one, thence to the
Brazen one, and <U+017F>o to that of Iron, yet I will bring you back to the former with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the<U+017F>e degrees; nay, you <U+017F>hall not be troubled with the Silver age to go into
the Golden one, that is to <U+017F>ay, it <U+017F>hall co<U+017F>t you nothing. As concerning Divine
Wor<U+017F>hip, which is the fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable, you are to know that we will honour all
the Divinities which the Antients did adore: But be<U+017F>ides that, as I make it my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion
to add to antient things in ca<U+017F>e they be not compleat, I will bring into repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<U+017F>ome modern Divinities; as for example, my will is there <U+017F>hould be a <hi>God</hi>
of <hi>Romances,</hi> a thing never enter'd the imagination of any <hi>Poet,</hi> though they create
Gods at their plea<U+017F>ure. This God <U+017F>hall have his Temple in <U+017F>ome Grot, where in
honour of him <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>ung every day choice hymns, and all the <hi>bad Romances</hi>
<U+017F>hall be burnt on his Altar in <U+017F>acrifice, whereas the <hi>good</hi> ones <U+017F>hall be pre<U+017F>erv'd in
the <U+017F>anctuary. This fir<U+017F>t year I will be the Prie<U+017F>t of the place, and will al<U+017F>o take
the title of <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>French Shepherds,</hi> as being honour'd and obey'd by all.
But that all may pretend to <U+017F>overaignty, and that there may be a <U+017F>haring of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
to prevent a Monarchical government, all the other Shepherds <U+017F>hall be <hi>Prie<U+017F>ts</hi>
and <hi>Princes</hi> from year to year in their turns. That's an excellent propo<U+017F>ition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
(<U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who heard all this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e) but if you pur<U+017F>ue it, I fear me
you will be declar'd a Rebel by the King, who will not <U+017F>uffer you to quit your <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h a Republike within his Kingdom. You had better do as <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ard</hi>
did, who in a Poem of his dedicated to <hi>Muretus,</hi> invites him and a legion of
other Poets, whom he names, to leave <hi>France</hi> which was troubled with civil wars,
and to go for the <hi>Fortunate I<U+017F>lands,</hi> there merrily to <U+017F>pend the remainder of their
lives: 'Tis one of the be<U+017F>t fancies he ever had. I grant it, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but yet
I have no mind to plant Colonies in remote Countries, where I know not whether
I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>afely arrive, be<U+017F>ides that it is only for <hi>Theutons</hi> and <hi>Cimbrians</hi> to <U+017F>eek

us as Traitors, for we will deprive him of nothing of his rights, and our power
<U+017F>hall reach no further then our <U+017F>elves. Your meaning is, that your government will
be like that of a King at <hi>Twelf-tide,</hi> or among School-boys, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> if it
be <U+017F>o, I believe you may be tolerated in <hi>France.</hi> Thou might<U+017F>t have u<U+017F>ed fitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari<U+017F>ons,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but <U+017F>ince there were never any end, if a man <U+017F>hould teach thee
all thou art ignorant of, I return to my former di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to <U+017F>atisfie my Lords the
Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors. They are further to know, that be<U+017F>ides the care I <U+017F>hall take of divers
<U+017F>acrifices, and of a many other things. I will e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h a <hi>Poetical</hi> and <hi>Amorous Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ity,</hi>
as I have already de<U+017F>ign'd. Upon certain <U+017F>olemn dayes there <U+017F>hall be <hi>Love-que<U+017F>tions</hi>
propo<U+017F>ed, much like tho<U+017F>e I <U+017F>ometime <U+017F>aw at <hi>Paris.</hi> Some Schollers <U+017F>hall
maintain them, others <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>pute again<U+017F>t them, both for the exerci<U+017F>e of their
parts, and that truth may i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of the<U+017F>e altercations, as a <U+017F>park of fire from the

               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:43725:137"/>
As for example, there <U+017F>hall be tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hall in the

                  <hi>Secondly, That</hi> it is better to <U+017F>ee a Wench that one loves
dead, if one be reciprocally loved by her, then to <U+017F>ee her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to another, and not be loved by her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the affection is greater after enjoyment then
before it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the fourth place, That,</hi> it is better for one to enjoy his
Shepherde<U+017F>s twice a week, with all the torments and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets
in the world, then to enjoy her fifteen days together in

have her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the fifth place, That</hi> the remembrance of any thing that
is good, is a greater plea<U+017F>ure then the good <U+017F>elf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the <U+017F>ixth place, That</hi> it were better for one never to

               <p>
                  <hi>And in the <U+017F>eventh place, That</hi> the jealou<U+017F>ie of a Lover,

            <p>A man may advance a many other as <U+017F>ubtil propo<U+017F>itions, and by <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>putati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<U+017F>hall every one be fully in<U+017F>tructed. On the days when this diver<U+017F>ion is not to

Pa<U+017F>toral <U+017F>ports. This indeed is a very plea<U+017F>ant, and much de<U+017F>irable way of
life, <U+017F>aies <hi>Menelas,</hi> but <U+017F>ince we <U+017F>hall have no offices or profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions among us, it is
mo<U+017F>t certain we <U+017F>hall get nothing; and if <U+017F>o, I know not how the family <U+017F>hall be
maintain'd, and the taxes paid. Our condition is noble and free, and con<U+017F>equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exempted from all impo<U+017F>itions, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> trouble not your <U+017F>elf as to that;
As for matter of livelihood, we <U+017F>hall want nothing: There is no bird <U+017F>o incon<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but findes his dinner, though he have neither <U+017F>tore-hou<U+017F>e nor fee-farm rent;
heaven provides for all the creatures in the world. 'Tis very certain, you cannot
want your entertainment, <U+017F>ince you can re<U+017F>tore the golden age, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond.</hi> In
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:43725:138"/>
that fir<U+017F>t age of the world, all the rivers were not milk, and all the trees bore not
fruit of <hi>Lotos,</hi> as many fools have imagin'd. Nature brought forth nothing but what
it does now, and that not <U+017F>o abundantly then, becau<U+017F>e nothing was advanc'd by
cultivation, but men were content with what they could finde; and to make a true
relation of the felicity of that time, it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F>s'd, that men fed on Acorns,
as well as the <U+017F>wine; and drank out of the river, as all other creatures did. They
had no coverture but their skin, or haply <U+017F>ome garment of leaves: The earth
was their Table and their Bed, the gra<U+017F>s their Carpet, the bu<U+017F>hes their Curtains,
and the caves their retreats: And thus it is mo<U+017F>t certain the fir<U+017F>t men lived; <U+017F>o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea<U+017F>onable
a thing it is to conceive they liv'd in a golden Age, <U+017F>ince gold was not
yet di<U+017F>cover'd. Let it be con<U+017F>idered, whether their life was not rather bruti<U+017F>h then
humane, and if they are not mad men which grieve for it, and that de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e ours,
whereof the ornament and civility cannot be over commended. You have much
rea<U+017F>on to believe you will ea<U+017F>ily finde your livelihood, if you regulate your <U+017F>elf to
that ancient manner of life; for indeed, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> you <U+017F>hall not be deny'd <U+017F>uch a nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as we allow bea<U+017F>ts; but what you do, is, as if the Law-makers were not yet
come into the world, to make men leave the forre<U+017F>ts and rocks, and to per<U+017F>wade
them to live in community in Cities. I believe there will be very few <U+017F>hall envy you;
for my part, I <U+017F>hall only bemoan you, to <U+017F>ee you become <U+017F>avage: for if you will
needs re<U+017F>tore your golden age, you mu<U+017F>t go naked as an <hi>American,</hi> and at the be<U+017F>t
be no better hous'd, then with a few turfs, as your beggars on the high-way, who
<U+017F>ell wands to Travellers. I do not believe the ancients entertain'd them<U+017F>elves as
thou <U+017F>aye<U+017F>t, reply'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but though it were <U+017F>o, know, that I will imitate onely
what is good in their life. I intend al<U+017F>o, to joyn to it the happine<U+017F>s of this la<U+017F>t age,
wherein all the curio<U+017F>ities in the world have been invented. It <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffice me to
live in the innocency and freedom of the fir<U+017F>t age, and it may be thou wilt be of my
opinion, when thou <U+017F>halt have ta<U+017F>ted the plea<U+017F>ures which I have imagin'd; we <U+017F>hall
not envy any, nor be envied by any. Of all the <hi>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions,</hi> there is only <hi>Love</hi> <U+017F>hall
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s us: And if <U+017F>ometimes we <U+017F>hall be guilty of any hatred, we <U+017F>hall exerci<U+017F>e
it only again<U+017F>t the wolves, which are in ho<U+017F>tility again<U+017F>t our Shepherdry. What
plea<U+017F>ure will it be to love Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, who<U+017F>e affection will be mutual, and will
freely di<U+017F>cover it <U+017F>elf, when re<U+017F>pect <U+017F>hall not cau<U+017F>e re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F>s, and breed in their
mindes what <U+017F>hall torment them! We <U+017F>hall finde, that tho<U+017F>e fair ones will be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Cockneys</hi> nor <hi>Courtizans,</hi> and that the unfaithfulne<U+017F>s of Lovers will not teach
them to carry two hearts in one brea<U+017F>t. As concerning divine wor<U+017F>hip, and the
<U+017F>ciences which we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>tudy, I have <U+017F>poken to that point already; but as for our
ordinary recreations, I have fancied to my <U+017F>elf mo<U+017F>t excellent ones. Tho<U+017F>e of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quality among us <U+017F>hall act a Comedy every day: The <U+017F>ubject <U+017F>hall be taken out
of <U+017F>ome piece of ancient Poetry; and the parts being a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd to tho<U+017F>e who already
know the <U+017F>tory by heart, they <U+017F>hall only be told the ca<U+017F>t of the Scenes, and then they
mu<U+017F>t compo<U+017F>e, as it were on a <hi><U+017F>udden,</hi> what they have to <U+017F>ay. Be<U+017F>ides, I have
found out an incomparable kinde of <U+017F>tage. I have <U+017F>een your Players at <hi>Burgundy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hou<U+017F>e,</hi>
I have <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome plays in the Colleges, but all was but fiction: There was
a sky of Canvas, a rock of Parport, and in all things the painting cheated our eyes;
but I will have it far otherwi<U+017F>e: our plays <U+017F>hall be acted in the open field, and our
<U+017F>tage <U+017F>hall be the great Theatre of nature; we'll have no heaven but the true hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
if a Shepherd be to i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of a Thicket, he <U+017F>hall do it out of a true thicket;
if he mu<U+017F>t drink at a <U+017F>pring, he <U+017F>hall drink at one indeed: and <U+017F>o all things being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
repre<U+017F>ented, men will believe they <U+017F>ee the true hi<U+017F>tory; <U+017F>o that the actors
being thereby animated them<U+017F>elves, will put on the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of tho<U+017F>e parts which
are a<U+017F><U+017F>ig'd them, and the <U+017F>pectators be as much pleas'd as a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at it. And all
this I do not any thing doubt of; when I con<U+017F>ider, that when ever I was at any play
at <hi>Paris,</hi> though they were not <U+017F>o natural and lively as ours will be, yet have I
ever been <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported by them, that I have imagin'd it was no fiction. Nay, <U+017F>ince
you make us <U+017F>uch excellent propo<U+017F>itions, I am much in doubt whether I <U+017F>hould ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
credit you, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> But as for your plays, I approve them beyond any
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:43725:138"/>
thing I ever heard. For to make them compleat, I will contribute <U+017F>omewhat of
my invention. You know there are <U+017F>ome Actors who never put off the parts they
once take: As for example, one is the <hi>Doctor,</hi> another the <hi>Captain,</hi> and another
the <hi>Fool.</hi> All the de<U+017F>ign is carried on accordingly, their parts change not, there is
only a change in the <U+017F>tory. I do not intend we <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>o; it mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily be
expected that our qualities and habits change, if we will repre<U+017F>ent all <U+017F>orts of ancient
fables: but as for our manner of <U+017F>peech, it <U+017F>hall not change at all. Every one <U+017F>hall
have a certain language, whereto he <U+017F>hall <U+017F>o accu<U+017F>tome him<U+017F>elf, that it will be ea<U+017F>ie
for him to find what he is to <U+017F>ay; as for example, one <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak by <hi>Allu<U+017F>ions</hi> and
<hi>Equivocations,</hi> another by <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> a third by <hi>Metaphors,</hi> and a fourth by <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that heard <hi>Clarimond's</hi> propo<U+017F>ition found it very excellent, except <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
who at the fir<U+017F>t could not dige<U+017F>t it. But <hi>Hircan</hi> forc'd him to do as the re<U+017F>t did, <U+017F>o
that every one had the liberty to choo<U+017F>e his <U+017F>peech. <hi>Fontenay</hi> cho<U+017F>e the <hi>Allu<U+017F>ions</hi>
and <hi>Equivocations; Polydor,</hi> the <hi>Hyperboles; Meliantes,</hi> the <hi>Metaphors;</hi> and
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> the <hi>Galamathias,</hi> which is a <U+017F>tile compo<U+017F>ed of <U+017F>hifts and windings of
words, which render the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>cure, that it can hardly be known what to make
of it. As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> he <U+017F>aid he would <U+017F>peak a neat and poli<U+017F>h'd phra<U+017F>e, which he
call'd the <hi>amorous</hi> and <hi>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate</hi> <U+017F>tile. There was propo<U+017F>ed al<U+017F>o the <hi>Pedantick</hi> <U+017F>tile,
<hi>Paris</hi>-Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <hi>Proverbs, Similitudes,</hi> and the <hi>Poetical</hi> <U+017F>tile, and <U+017F>ome others
which they re<U+017F>olv'd to make u<U+017F>e of when there were need. The Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es came
not into the number of the Actors who appear'd on the Stage, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Clarimond</hi>
had re<U+017F>olved there <U+017F>hould nothing be done but what were <hi>grote<U+017F>que,</hi> wherein it was
not fit the Ladies <U+017F>hould be engag'd. As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> he thought it well they were
excluded, for he was glad to <U+017F>ee men acting womens parts, as being a thing that
<U+017F>eemed to him more comical.</p>
            <p>All the que<U+017F>tion now was, What piece <U+017F>hould be fir<U+017F>t acted for tryal. Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
that of the <hi>Ravi<U+017F>hing of Pro<U+017F>erpina,</hi> and that of <hi>P<U+017F>yche;</hi> and others the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cent
of Orpheus</hi> into <hi>hell,</hi> the <hi>Loves of Pyramus and Thisbe,</hi> the <hi>Conque<U+017F>t of the
Golden Fleece,</hi> and the <hi>Deflowring of Philomela.</hi> At la<U+017F>t <hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>aid, that the next
day they would repre<U+017F>ent the <hi>ravi<U+017F>hing</hi> of <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina</hi> by <hi>Pluto,</hi> which was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
peece, and as being often <U+017F>een acted would be very ea<U+017F>ie. It was re<U+017F>olv'd <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
<U+017F>hould act <hi>Venus;</hi> that the fair <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who had been us'd to be clad like a
Maid, <U+017F>hould be the fair <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina;</hi> that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>hould be <hi>Cyana; Clarimond, Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thu<U+017F>a;
Hircan</hi> <U+017F>hould act the part of <hi>Pluto, Meliantes</hi> that of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi>
that of <hi>Ceres.</hi> There wanted nothing but a <hi>Cupid:</hi> And <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
who had newly acted him, <U+017F>aid he was as pretty for to act him, as if he had
been painted for that purpo<U+017F>e. <hi>Carmelin</hi> being very low in compari<U+017F>on of <hi>Polidor,</hi>
who was to be his mother <hi>Venus,</hi> 'twas thought no part could be more convenient
for him; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> for his <U+017F>ake imagined a new <U+017F>tile, which he call'd the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
<U+017F>tile, wherein he thought he might be able enough becau<U+017F>e of his ordinary <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities.
It was only he that made <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, calling to mind that the part
they gave him had not been very fortunate to him, and had been the cau<U+017F>e he had
been well beaten that afternoon. They per<U+017F>waded him out of that fear, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured
him that the part he was to have would be both plea<U+017F>ant and honorable to him.
Upon this one of the men went to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s for an <hi>Ovids Metamorpho<U+017F>es,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris</hi>
having read aloud the <U+017F>ubject of the future Comedy, <U+017F>hewed every one what
he had to do. The day being <U+017F>pent in the<U+017F>e entertainments, they left the wedding;
and all tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s company going along with him, <hi>Hircan</hi> took away his to
his Ca<U+017F>tle. As they were ready to go in, I am exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively hot, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I know
not whether it proceeds from the weather, or from the Love which po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es my
heart: I have a great de<U+017F>ire to go into the water to night; is there any body el<U+017F>e
of the <U+017F>ame mind?</p>
            <p>It happened that <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> had a mind to go into the water; <U+017F>o
that they left the re<U+017F>t of the company to go into the river <hi>Morin.</hi> 'Twas about half
a league off, and yet they cheerfully overcame the way, di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing of divers things
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43725:139"/>
with <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whom they carried with them to look to their cloaths, though there
were no need of it. As they were putting off their cloaths, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> not able any
longer to conceal the de<U+017F>ign he had, <U+017F>poke thus to them. 'Tis very true, my friends,
that it is a plea<U+017F>ure to me to go into the water, both for to refre<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elf a little
in this hot <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, and to wa<U+017F>h my body: But be<U+017F>ides this, my intention is to go
and <U+017F>ee the <hi>aquatick Divinities</hi> that lodge in this River. I have not mention'd it to
<hi>Hircan,</hi> becau<U+017F>e I doubt he would have endeavoured to divert me, by making me
believe I am no <hi>Demy-god,</hi> as I have <U+017F>ometimes been, and that I am not any longer
permitted to conver<U+017F>e with tho<U+017F>e of that quality. I know no rea<U+017F>on why he <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>ay <U+017F>o; for in all Hi<U+017F>tories we have a many examples of humane per<U+017F>ons that have
<U+017F>poken to Divinities. Is it not becau<U+017F>e he hates them, and will have me hate them
too? As for the aquatick Gods, <U+017F>ince he hath pluck'd off their beards, 'tis certain
he loves them not much: And if I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>poken to him of going to <U+017F>ee them,
he would not have come, for fear of receiving <U+017F>ome affront. But I who am one
of their greate<U+017F>t friends, as I have good te<U+017F>timony, I will confidently go and <U+017F>ee
them, and if I can, I will have their Chry<U+017F>tal palaces opened to you.</p>
            <p>With the<U+017F>e words the <hi>Shepherd</hi> ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf headlong into the water. <hi>Clarimond</hi>
and <hi>Philiris</hi> fearing he might be drown'd, made ha<U+017F>te in after him, and recovered
him, when he had drunk <U+017F>o much that he was almo<U+017F>t gone. Being a little <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of
his fault, he told them there was no means to vi<U+017F>it the <hi>Aquatick Divinities</hi> that day,
and that they de<U+017F>ired not to be <U+017F>een, <U+017F>ince they had not divided the water to make
him a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to their Courts. He afterward wa<U+017F>h'd him<U+017F>elf quietly, and put on his
cloaths with the re<U+017F>t, without any extravagancy at all. Only he <U+017F>aid it troubled him
that he had not <U+017F>poken to the Gods of the waters, becau<U+017F>e he would have invited
them to their <U+017F>ports, to make them more compleat, if they were to repre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome
Story wherein it were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary <U+017F>ome aquatick Deity appeared on the Stage. He
al<U+017F>o <U+017F>aid they mu<U+017F>t needs find out <U+017F>ome <hi>Hamadryads,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome <hi>Satyres,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to act a good <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral.</hi> He would not have them coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
as the other Divinities; becau<U+017F>e he had read in the <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals</hi> of <hi>Julietta,</hi>
that tho<U+017F>e Goats familiarly appeared to Shepherds, and that they ravi<U+017F>h'd the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>es.
Be<U+017F>ides he imagined he had once <U+017F>een one, and that he might again meet
with a true one.</p>
            <p>Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with this imagination, he prayd <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> to return to <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi>
and to leave him neer a Thicket wher he hoped to meet with <U+017F>ome rural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities.
They, who were <U+017F>omwhat hungry, went their way and left him with <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
who had rather have gone with them then <U+017F>tay with his ma<U+017F>ter, who<U+017F>e imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
pleas'd him not. However they <U+017F>taid together, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> began to <U+017F>peak
thus: Fair <hi>Hamadryads!</hi> divine <hi>Fairies!</hi> who dance all night by the moon-<U+017F>hine;
and you la<U+017F>civious <hi>Fawns!</hi> can I by no means <U+017F>ee one of you?</p>
            <p>He had <U+017F>carce <U+017F>poken this, but he perceives afar off ten or twelve torches, which
pa<U+017F>s'd from one place to another. Ah good god! they are fal<U+017F>e lights which will
lead us to drowning, cries out <hi>Carmelin:</hi> O ma<U+017F>ter, do not follow them I let me
never be thought my mothers <U+017F>on, if they do not de<U+017F>troy you: If you will prevent
it, lie down on the ground. Ah da<U+017F>tard! <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> do thou <U+017F>tretch thy <U+017F>elf as thou
wilt, this adventure is re<U+017F>erve'd for me: I mu<U+017F>t follow tho<U+017F>e torches, for I <U+017F>ee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now favours me. 'Tis <hi>Ceres Eleu<U+017F>ina,</hi> who having heard that to morrow we
were to repre<U+017F>ent her <U+017F>tory, will be pre<U+017F>ent in per<U+017F>on, and act her own part. Tho<U+017F>e
are her torches that appear, they are her true badges. Now all my wi<U+017F>hes are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd: All the Gods will come down on earth, to repre<U+017F>ent before us what
they <U+017F>ometime did before; <U+017F>o that tho<U+017F>e to whom we have a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd their parts,
mu<U+017F>t mode<U+017F>tly re<U+017F>ign them, confe<U+017F><U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves unworthy to act them, and content
them<U+017F>elves to be <U+017F>pectators.</p>
            <p>In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, he runs up and down, thinking to catch one of the torches; but
they <U+017F>taid not long in a place. At la<U+017F>t they came all together; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thinking
he <U+017F>hould then catch them, ran <U+017F>o much the fa<U+017F>ter, and that <U+017F>o confidently, that pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
between two trees where a cord was fa<U+017F>tened, he <U+017F>hewed a feat of activity, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43725:139"/>
tumbled into a ditch full of ru<U+017F>hes and reeds. Tho<U+017F>e who carried the torches, were
the Countrey people of the wedding, who having taken notice of all his actions,
knew that he and <hi>Carmelin</hi> were gone into the water with <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris.</hi>
Their de<U+017F>ign was to frighten them, and to make them fall into <U+017F>ome <U+017F>nares, which
they had plac'd up and down to catch tho<U+017F>e that had offended them. Some of them
having ob<U+017F>erv'd that <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> were gone into <hi>Hirtans,</hi> but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and
<hi>Carmelin</hi> not, they concluded they were fallen <U+017F>omewhere, and that they were <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
reveng'd. They thought be<U+017F>t to leave them where they were, as al<U+017F>o be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
they thought it would have been to no purpo<U+017F>e to look for them in the dark,
were they minded to beat them. <hi>Carmelin</hi> not hearing any more the voyce of his
Ma<U+017F>ter, lifted up his head a little; and not <U+017F>eeing the torches, which were put out,
he pre<U+017F>umed to get up on his feet, and to look for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> He call'd him on every
<U+017F>ide, when at la<U+017F>t a mournful voyce came to his ears: he thought it were <hi>Ly<U+017F>iis</hi>
that <U+017F>poke. Where am I? <U+017F>aid he; am I in the infernal fens? is <hi>Charons</hi> boat
any thing near me? Alas! my poor ma<U+017F>ter, cryes out <hi>Carmelin,</hi> tell me where
you are, and I will come and help you. O Godde<U+017F>s <hi>Ceres!</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> again to him,
if you will <U+017F>end me to hell, do me at lea<U+017F>t the favor to tell me for what crime. Is it for
going to entertain your daughter <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina,</hi> and to teach her the art of Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry?
<hi>Carmelin</hi> hearing this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o little to the purpo<U+017F>e, cryed his heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
out, to let his ma<U+017F>ter know it was his faithful <hi>Carmelin;</hi> and at length, having
<U+017F>oftly <U+017F>lidden into the ditch, he drew him out. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> taking him then for no other
then he was, joyn'd with him to <U+017F>eek out the way to <hi>Hircans</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle, which after
many turns they met with. They made long complaints of the accident had
hapned to them; and <hi>Carmelia,</hi> to <U+017F>hew how infinitely he was afraid, <U+017F>wore there
were as many torches as <U+017F>tars in the sky. For to chear them up, there was a fire
<U+017F>et on, and <U+017F>upper brought them: and afterwards they were di<U+017F>pos'd into good
beds, where they <U+017F>lept till the next day.</p>
            <p>All got up betimes in the morning to <U+017F>tudy their parts: There was none but
<U+017F>earcht in <hi>Hircans</hi> <U+017F>tudy for the books that were mo<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for to learn the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
he was to ob<U+017F>erve. The <hi>Gallimathia<U+017F>i<U+017F>t</hi> turn'd over the <hi>loves</hi> of <hi>Des E<U+017F>cuteaux,</hi>
and other modern books. The <hi>Hyporboli<U+017F>t</hi> pick'd out what was mo<U+017F>t for his purpo<U+017F>e,
out of <U+017F>ome other books, and <U+017F>o every one endeavor'd to make him<U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t
perfect he could. Only <hi>Carmelin</hi> di<U+017F>cover'd his ignorance; for not finding any means
to make u<U+017F>e of the <hi>Common places</hi> he had by heart, there was nothing in his mind
that contributed any thing to his part. <hi>Polidor,</hi> who was to come into the <U+017F>cene with
him, lectur'd him a little, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him, that be<U+017F>ides what he taught him, the
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of <U+017F>peaking would furni<U+017F>h him with many conceptions, when it came to
the pu<U+017F>h. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was confident thereupon, and troubled not him<U+017F>elf with any
further <U+017F>tudy.</p>
            <p>When they had all din'd, <hi>Pluto</hi> put on a black Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ock, <hi>Jupiter</hi> a red, <hi>Venus</hi> was in
<hi>green, Ceres</hi> in <hi>yellow, Pro<U+017F>erpina</hi> in <hi>blew, Cyana</hi> and <hi>Arethu<U+017F>a</hi> in <hi>white;</hi> and as for
<hi>Love,</hi> It was re<U+017F>olv'd he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>tark <hi>naked.</hi> He told them, he would never do
it; and that he was more mode<U+017F>t then to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf uncovered, before <U+017F>o many
women. He therefore was permitted in his drawers, having Goo<U+017F>e-wings on his
back. They hang'd about him a quiver, and gave him a bow in his hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean time,</hi> Clarimond <hi>having been to look out a place, the fitte<U+017F>t could be
found for the <U+017F>tage, found out one near</hi> Hircans <hi>wood. Thither came the whole
company, and</hi> Orontes <hi>and all his train came to be <U+017F>pectators. There was a little
hillock, that <U+017F>erv'd to repre<U+017F>ent the mountain of</hi> Erix, <hi>whereon</hi> Venus <hi>appear'd fir<U+017F>t.
There were over again<U+017F>t it two trees, whereon there was a cro<U+017F>s piece laid, with a
long rope in the middle, at the end whereof they had fa<U+017F>tened a <U+017F>hort <U+017F>tick. They
commanded</hi> Cupid <hi>to <U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf a<U+017F>tride thereon, and then they began to wag him
from one <U+017F>ide to another, as if he had been in a <U+017F>wing, to make him imagine he fled.
He was <U+017F>o amaz'd to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf in the air, that he began to cry out, that he would
ca<U+017F>t away his bow to have his hands free, and hold fa<U+017F>t by the rope, if they did not
give over frightning him. Upon that they ca<U+017F>t a cord to him for him to tie him<U+017F>elf
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:43725:140"/>
withal, and having put it about him with a <U+017F>ingle knot, a Lacquay, who was gotten
upon one of the trees, took the other end of it. After this,</hi> Venus <hi>looking on him,
<U+017F>poke to him in this manner, in her</hi> Hyperbolical <hi>Language,</hi> Dear Son, who art ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my <U+017F>elf, wilt thou not that one dart of thine pierce the heaven and the earth, and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
an axletree for this great fabrick, that it may be believ'd it is only thou that
do<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain it? Thy fires have lighted the <U+017F>un and the <U+017F>tars; have they not already burnt
up Neptune and all his waters? That thou maye<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ummate thy victories, mu<U+017F>t they
not devour the fires of hell? Come and repo<U+017F>e thy <U+017F>elf on this mountain, which is
a pillar that <U+017F>upports the heaven; may, advances its crown above that fair vault, for to
make a throne for our Divinity; come hither, my delight, thou ha<U+017F>t already <U+017F>hredded the ayr
with thy wings, more times then there are grains of <U+017F>and on the <U+017F>ea <U+017F>hore. Come my
childe, and I will wipe of the <U+017F>weat off thy forehead, which makes an ocean big enough
for a fleet. Do not <U+017F>tay any longer my Minion, I will <U+017F>hew thee thy uncle, whom thou
mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>o grievou<U+017F>ly wound, that all his body <U+017F>hall be but one wound. Venus <hi>here held her
peace, and the pre<U+017F>ence expected <U+017F>ome fine an<U+017F>wer from</hi> Cupid, <hi>when he began to
cry out as loud as he could,</hi> Oh my friends, help, help, I am choak'd! <hi>Some were
amaz'd, others laught at it, but all look'd towards</hi> Carmelin. <hi>The Lacquay that was
on the tree, drew the cord <U+017F>o hard, that it tickl'd his throat more then it <U+017F>hould:
<U+017F>o that they bid him hold his hand; and the poor</hi> Cupid <hi>calling to minde the <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities
which they had put into his head, <U+017F>pake thus, with a voyce as clear as the
<U+017F>ound of a gla<U+017F>s,</hi> What is your plea<U+017F>ure? Mamma, if you will have me come and <U+017F>ee
you, you mu<U+017F>t promi<U+017F>e to buy me a hobby-hor<U+017F>e at the fair, that when I am weary
of flying, I may go gallantly by Land. You mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o give me, and't plea<U+017F>e you, a new
whi<U+017F>tle; for I have <U+017F>old mine to Mercury, for to make u<U+017F>e of in his pimpages. What
would you with me? will you have me tell you what I have lo<U+017F>t at Cockcal to my Brother
<hi>Anteros</hi> and your Graces? I plaid too t'other daie at pu<U+017F>hpin, with <hi>Ganimed,</hi> but he
is a cheating companion. He would ever win, and under pretence that <hi>Jupiter</hi> loves
him, he thinks he may do any thing, and not fear the rod, nay, that he may one daie
have my quality, and di<U+017F>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s me of my torch; but when I <U+017F>hall finde him by him<U+017F>elf,
I'll order him as he de<U+017F>erves, and I'll tell his ma<U+017F>ter of his <U+017F>eeking birds-ne<U+017F>ts, in<U+017F>tead
of going to <U+017F>chool; you know he gees to learn Latine of <hi>Mercury.</hi> There is yet a great
deal more news: I'll tell you all, but, Oh God, I dye, I dye, if I am not let down! But
quickly then, my friend, take me hence, I <U+017F>hall make <U+017F>awce in my <U+017F>hirt el<U+017F>e; let me
down, let me down, in good faith I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>poil all the ceremony el<U+017F>e. Carmelin <hi>having <U+017F>o
<U+017F>aid, they knew not whether he <U+017F>poke this as his part; but at length he cryed out
<U+017F>o loud to be let down, that they <U+017F>aw he <U+017F>poke in good earne<U+017F>t, and not as an actor.
They took him down out of his <U+017F>wing; and he a<U+017F><U+017F>oon got him behinde the Mountain</hi>
Erix, <hi>where he di<U+017F>charg'd him<U+017F>elf of a burthen which <U+017F>omwhat troubled him. 'Twas
<U+017F>uppos'd that that accident of not being able to command his belly, proceeded from
that agitation. Being therefore excu<U+017F>ed, he came chearfully into play again, &amp; having
crept up to the place where</hi> Venus <hi>was, he went to receive her embraces and care<U+017F><U+017F>es.</hi>

the pri<U+017F>on of her ineffable pulchritude: I will as <U+017F>oon be a ravi<U+017F>her, as a lover of her.
<hi>With that word he leap'd down, and took up</hi> Pro<U+017F>erpina, <hi>whom he carried to his

What, wilt thou take me, never to for<U+017F>ake me? 'Tis not thy <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t way, to ravi<U+017F>h me

            <p>Notwith<U+017F>tanding this fine complaint, and a many <hi>allu<U+017F>ions, Pluto</hi> drove his hor<U+017F>es

infernal Kingdom. He pa<U+017F>s'd by a ditch, whence i<U+017F><U+017F>ued <hi>Cyana</hi> half naked, and with
long di<U+017F>chevel'd hair as if <U+017F>he were come out of the water: But the Chariot went
on <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, that <U+017F>he could not give <hi>Pluto</hi> the check <U+017F>he had thought on; yet would
<U+017F>he not omit her part, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he ran up and down as it were to overtake the God
of Hell. In<U+017F>tead of going into the Wood whither he was enter'd, behind the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Eryx,</hi> <U+017F>he went into the high-way, there <U+017F>he found a Waggon covered with
cloth; there was in it a man and a woman, whom <U+017F>he took for <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Pro<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina.</hi>
She drove the hor<U+017F>es into the Scene, while the Waggoner was making water
a little behind. <hi>Thou <U+017F>halt go no further,</hi> thou robber <hi>Pluto,</hi> (cry'd out the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who acted the part of the Nymph <hi>Cyana.) Love delights more in mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
then violence: Thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t have won</hi> Pro<U+017F>erpina <hi>by thy <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ions and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>timonies
of affection, and not have ravi<U+017F>h'd her. As long as I have arms, I will hinder
the violence of thy charriot; and I who am but a poor <U+017F>illy Maid, will re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t a
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Waggoner at length running after his waggon, imagin'd the woman had
led it away was <U+017F>ome <U+017F>pirit; but finding him<U+017F>elf engag'd among <U+017F>o many as was
there, he was in a greater perplexity then before, and tho<U+017F>e in the waggon were not
le<U+017F>s amaz'd, praying <hi>Cyana</hi> to let them go on their journey. At la<U+017F>t the man that
was in the waggon made bold to come out to thru<U+017F>t her away; and having narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ob<U+017F>erv'd her, and attentively heard her voice, he pre<U+017F>ently cry'd out, Ah mad
fool! is it then thou whom we have now met! I thought thou had<U+017F>t been far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
hence, whereas thou come<U+017F>t now to pre<U+017F>ent thy <U+017F>elf before me in a wor<U+017F>e
condition then at <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>S. Cloud:</hi> Now thou art di<U+017F>guis'd like a Witch. O God!
what affliction is this to our family! Mu<U+017F>t this mi<U+017F>erable Wretch di<U+017F>credit
us all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> who was among the <U+017F>pectators, had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>een the man, but he
knew him to be Mr. <hi>Adrian, Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s Guardian. He pre<U+017F>ently went out of his place
and <U+017F>aluted him, de<U+017F>iring him not to be angry with his Ward, <U+017F>ince what he <U+017F>aid
was not out of folly, but it was the Part a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd him in the <U+017F>port they were then
about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean time</hi> Cyana <hi>went and ca<U+017F>t her<U+017F>elf into her ditch, and began to cry
out thus:</hi> Alas! how am I now well puni<U+017F>h'd for my ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s? My blood is turned
into water, my bones <U+017F>often; there's nothing of me which becomes not liquid: <hi>Pluto</hi>
hath metamorphos'd me into a Fountain, that <U+017F>hall ever weep for the ravi<U+017F>hing of the
fair <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> hearing this, believ'd not what <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had <U+017F>aid to him; he told him
he could not believe but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was madder then ever, and that he was made do all
tho<U+017F>e ab<U+017F>urdities for to make others <U+017F>port. Do you not al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ee, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi>
<U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even other per<U+017F>ons of quality di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed as well as he? And upon that <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
Philiris,</hi> and <hi>Meliantes,</hi> whom the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F>s of the accident had forc'd to
come out of the places where they were retired, <U+017F>hewed them<U+017F>elves unmask'd to
<hi>Adrian.</hi> He <U+017F>aw they were people well enough in their wits, and was <U+017F>omwhat
appeas'd, thinking his Ward could do nothing undecent among<U+017F>t them. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
came in with the re<U+017F>t; and having under<U+017F>tood that <hi>Adrian</hi> would not believe they
were acting a Comedy in that place, I was al<U+017F>o of it, <U+017F>ays he to him, I tell you <U+017F>o
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43725:141"/>
much, that you may no longer doubt of it: See, here's my bow; look on it, is it
not of good wood?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>While they laugh'd at this <U+017F>implicity,</hi> Philiris <hi>habited as a Godde<U+017F>s went to</hi> Ly<U+017F>is.
<hi>He found his mind was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported, that he could not con<U+017F>ider it was his Cou<U+017F>in
he had met.</hi> Gracious <hi>Ceres! (<U+017F>ays the Nymph</hi> Cyana <hi><U+017F>peaking to</hi> Philiris) have
you already <U+017F>ought every where your <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina</hi> with your burning torches? Hath not
<hi>Arethu<U+017F>a</hi> told you that <hi>Pluto</hi> detains her for his Spou<U+017F>e in hell? Have you not yet
made your complaint of it to <hi>Jupiter</hi> King of the Gods? <hi>We are not there yet, <U+017F>ays</hi>
Philiris; <hi>come away quickly, there's need of you.</hi> How's that? <U+017F>ays <hi>Cyana,</hi> is
the order of our Play di<U+017F>turb'd? Who is in fault that it goes not forward? who are the
perturbators of our enjoyments? Have not I plaid my part of the Fountain well? me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I am already melted into water, as <U+017F>ugar in the mouth. <hi>I tell you there's one
of your friends come, replies</hi> Philiris, <hi>come quickly and <U+017F>alute him, He is much
troubled about you: I think I have heard him call'd</hi> Adrian; <hi>remember your<U+017F>elf
whether you know him or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This news bred a change in <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and though he were accu<U+017F>tom'd to take all
fictions for truths, yet the name of <hi>Adrian</hi> <U+017F>o di<U+017F>turb'd him, that he <U+017F>oon forgot the
ravi<U+017F>hing of <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina</hi> was a doing. Yet he <U+017F>unk into his hole, not that he thought
him<U+017F>elf a Fountain, but that he might not be <U+017F>een. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> de<U+017F>irous to have him
appear, went to the ditch with <hi>Adrian,</hi> who <U+017F>aid to him, So, <U+017F>o! do not hide your
<U+017F>elf, Cou<U+017F>in, I know well enough 'tis you. Then was he forced to come out and <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>Adrian,</hi> and afterward went to the waggon where his Cou<U+017F>ins good wife was,
whom he had taken for <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina.</hi> While he was in his complements and excu<U+017F>es
to her, <hi>Adrian</hi> told <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> that he wondred to find them in <hi>Brie,</hi> whereas <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
had a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him they were to go into <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts.</hi> 'Tis be<U+017F>ides our intention that we are
in this Country, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme;</hi> and I believe it hath happened <U+017F>o, that we might
have the happine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ee you here: But I pray what great de<U+017F>igns have brought
you this way? I am on a pilgrimage to St. <hi>Fare</hi> with my wife, an<U+017F>wers <hi>Adrian;</hi>
though I am not the be<U+017F>t in the world, yet mu<U+017F>t a man endeavour to be <U+017F>o. Be
pleas'd to day to be merry with us, <U+017F>ayes <hi>An<U+017F>elme;</hi> and to morrow you may go on
your way, and be in as good time at <hi>Faremon<U+017F>tier,</hi> as if you lay there to night.
You'll excu<U+017F>e me, replies <hi>Adrian,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t by your favour into the waggon again,
Not before you drink with us, <U+017F>ays <hi>Orontes;</hi> you <U+017F>hall bait here.</p>
            <p>After this there was brought on the place a many good things to eat; and the
Play being interrupted, both the Actors and Spectators came to the Banquet. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>
and his wife, and the Waggoner having <U+017F>atisfied them<U+017F>elves, were re<U+017F>olved to
continue their journey: So they got into the waggon, and asking where <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> liv'd,
He is <U+017F>o good Company, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> that all will have him by turns: He is
<U+017F>ometimes at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, <U+017F>ometimes at <hi>Montenor</hi>'s, <U+017F>ometimes at <hi>Clarimond</hi>'s; but
at any time you will have tidings of us at <hi>Hircan</hi>'s Ca<U+017F>tle. When I have done my
devotions at <hi>Faremon<U+017F>tier,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Adrian,</hi> I will endeavour to get in a little mony due
to me from a Gentleman of this Country, and then I <U+017F>hall be able to <U+017F>tay here two
or three dayes: But as I come back, I will take <hi>Lewis</hi> along with me to <hi>Paris,</hi> for
I believe he is too trouble<U+017F>om to you. Farewell Gentlemen and Ladies! adieu Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>in!
Drive on, Waggoner.</p>
            <p>The Waggoner <U+017F>et forward, and all the Company wi<U+017F>h'd a good journey to the
Merchant and his wife. None was di<U+017F>contented but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> He was troubled at the
promi<U+017F>e his Cou<U+017F>in made to fetch him away, and knew not how to remedy it. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
comforted him the be<U+017F>t he could; and <hi>Hircan</hi> de<U+017F>irous to put <U+017F>omething
more plea<U+017F>ant into his mind, told him, that <U+017F>ince the ravi<U+017F>hing of <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina</hi> had
been interrupted, and that there was no means to begin it again, they would the
next day act the <hi>Golden Fleece.</hi> That's an excellent de<U+017F>ign, <U+017F>aves <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> but where
<U+017F>hall be the Sea? We'll go to a Lake that's a quarter of a league hence, replies
<hi>Hircan.</hi> It's better we went to the River <hi>Morin,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> I know a place
where there is a little I<U+017F>le, that <U+017F>hall be the I<U+017F>le of <hi>Colchos.</hi> That will be excellent,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to him: Thou <U+017F>halt be <hi>Ja<U+017F>on; Meliantes</hi> <U+017F>hall be <hi>Medea; Hircan</hi> that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:43725:141"/>
playes on the Lute, <U+017F>hall be <hi>Orpheus</hi> that accompanied the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> and cheer'd
them up with his mu<U+017F>ick. For my part, I'll be <hi>Zethes</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> <U+017F>hall be <hi>Calais,</hi>
two brothers twins, the children of <hi>Boreas</hi> and <hi>Orithia;</hi> and for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he <U+017F>hallbe
the King <hi>Phineus,</hi> a part very convenient for him in my opinion, for he is ever hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
enough. As for the other parts, as <hi>Ca<U+017F>tor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other of the
<hi>Argonauts</hi> and the <hi>Harpies,</hi> they that <U+017F>hall act them <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>uch as need not <U+017F>peak
unle<U+017F>s they will.</p>
            <p>This order being approved, the Company parted with hope the next day to have
good <U+017F>port. All the Actors read the Fable of <hi>Ja<U+017F>on,</hi> and every one con<U+017F>idered the
fitte<U+017F>t words for his part. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he told them he would now <U+017F>peak learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
and not <U+017F>imply; and that he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>hew <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>ts and da<U+017F>hes of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> with his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance compo<U+017F>ed what he had to <U+017F>ay, and gave it him
in Notes, which he did nothing but read all night and the next morning, <U+017F>uch was his
de<U+017F>ire to do well: His <U+017F>tile was half Proverbs, and the re<U+017F>t was Fancie.</p>
            <p>The time of the <U+017F>ports come, all the Actors dre<U+017F>s'd them<U+017F>elves, and went to the
River of <hi>Morin,</hi> where the re<U+017F>t of the company met neer about the <U+017F>ame time. The
Actors were only of <hi>Hircans</hi> Train, becau<U+017F>e they <U+017F>eemed to be of the better humor,
and as it were fit for nothing but to make <U+017F>port for others. <hi>An<U+017F>elme, Montenor,</hi>
and <hi>Orontes</hi> were there only as <U+017F>pectators with the Ladies and <U+017F>ome other friends.
The <U+017F>pectators having <U+017F>eated them<U+017F>elves on the River <U+017F>ide, there was hard by them
a Table, and at that a Chair. <hi>Carmelin</hi> came and fate in it, having on a fair Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown,
a fal<U+017F>e white Beard, and a Crown of yellow Pa<U+017F>sbord. He was very glad to <U+017F>ee
him<U+017F>elf a King once in his life; and ob<U+017F>erving three or four Waiters <U+017F>erving up
<U+017F>ome meat before him, he was not a little proud to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o magnificently treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
He well remembred that <hi>Clarimond</hi> had told him he <U+017F>hould not eat, and that all
his meat would be taken away from him; but he thought he had je<U+017F>ted with him,
and that there were no danger to eat a bit or two, if <U+017F>o be he could do it. His Carver
had no <U+017F>ooner pre<U+017F>ented him with a Pullets wing, but the two Harpies very odly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
came in; one with her claws took away the wing, while the other <U+017F>natcht away
the whole carka<U+017F>s with an iron crook. King <hi>Phineus</hi> <U+017F>eeing they were gone, began
to <U+017F>peak in this manner. <hi>Ah mi<U+017F>erable Prince that I am! to what purpo<U+017F>e have I <U+017F>o
much mony, which I rake up with <U+017F>hovels, and mea<U+017F>ure by the bu<U+017F>hel? To what purpo<U+017F>e
have I <U+017F>o many Country-hou<U+017F>es, where I may be fed of all <U+017F>orts of creatures, if I cannot
eat becau<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e abominable mon<U+017F>ters which take away all from me? 'Tis to much
purpo<U+017F>e to kill for me <U+017F>o many tender Chickens, which die young, to make me live the
longer: Of all this I have nothing but the <U+017F>moak. My Courtiers do <U+017F>ufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trate
to me, that patience pa<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>cience; but a <U+017F>tarv'd belly hath no eares. In the
po<U+017F>ture I am, I could eat through <U+017F>tone-walls, for there's no <U+017F>auce to hunger.</hi> King
<hi>Phineus</hi> having <U+017F>aid this, ca<U+017F>t his eye on his Notes which he had laid on the table for
to look in <U+017F>ometimes, if his memory failed him. <hi>Clarimond</hi> had <U+017F>et down all he was
to do; <U+017F>o that he read aloud the<U+017F>e words which he found there: Carmelin <hi>who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ents
King</hi> Phineus, <hi>mu<U+017F>t now call to drink. Give me <U+017F>ome wine there, I command
you, <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o in the writing,</hi> continued he.</p>
            <p>All began to laugh at this plea<U+017F>ant <U+017F>implicity. But he, who thought of nothing
but his profit, made ready to receive the gla<U+017F>s out of the hands of his people, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
he <U+017F>hould drink, though he could not eat: But as he thought to carry the
gla<U+017F>s to his mouth, comes a Harpy, and with her clawes breaks it all to peeces. That
made him angry in good earne<U+017F>t; and in <U+017F>pight of all the precepts of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> he
re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>wallow <U+017F>omwhat. They had no <U+017F>ooner brought him a <U+017F>houlder of mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
but he pre<U+017F>ently fell on, without <U+017F>taying to be carv'd to. He fell a biting it <U+017F>o
revengefully, as if he would have devoured all at a bit; but the Harpies came in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
and tugg'd with him, and had almo<U+017F>t broke his teeth. He <U+017F>eeing they were
too <U+017F>trong for him, call'd for a rib of Beef, and taking a <U+017F>taff from one of the waiters
he in good earne<U+017F>t <U+017F>et on the fingers of tho<U+017F>e Mon<U+017F>ters when they came neer his
table, though he had not been taught to do that, and act his part well. Yet the
Harpies carried away the meat, and left him <U+017F>o di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate, that he would not have
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:43725:142"/>
any thing more <U+017F>erv'd up. While he groaned in his chair, they <U+017F>aw afar off a boat,
wherein were the Argonauts, clad like brave Gentlemen. They had all branches
in their hands, except <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who plaid on the Lute; and <U+017F>ung a <U+017F>ea <U+017F>ong, which
began thus:
<q>
                  <l>Gentles, command, I will not fail,</l>
                  <l>My <U+017F>hip is going to <U+017F>et <U+017F>ail, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The re<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wered him in a <hi>Chorus,</hi> and made a very excellent mu<U+017F>ick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ve<U+017F><U+017F>el being arriv'd at a port near the table of</hi> Phineas, Zethes <hi>and</hi> Calais
<hi>were <U+017F>et a <U+017F>hore, for to finde out this</hi> King. O fair youths, <hi><U+017F>ayes he to them,</hi> what
good wind hath brought you into my territories? you are here both wello-ome, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receiv'd.
Can I not by your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance be delivered from a <U+017F>ort of filthy birds, who

King, <hi>replied</hi> Zethes, Feathers are come out at our backs, at the <U+017F>ame time as hair

            <p>
               <hi>Phineas</hi> upon that, commanded his people to bring him <U+017F>omewhat; they <U+017F>et on
the table a fat Capon, and the Harpies were pre<U+017F>ently there to take it away; but
<hi>Zethes</hi> and <hi>Calais</hi> laid hand on their <U+017F>words, and frighted them <U+017F>o, as they fled:
They ran after them <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, as it might be thought they fled. In the mean time
<hi>Carmelin</hi> looking on his paper, <U+017F>aw a marginal note that pleas'd him very well, and
which he had not before at all taken notice of: he could not but plainly deliver it
ju<U+017F>t as he found it written: <hi>'Tis now,</hi> <U+017F>aies he, <hi>that King</hi> Phineus <hi>delivered from
the Harpies, may eat at libertie,</hi> He afterwards <U+017F>ed very couragiou<U+017F>ly of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon;
and utter'd this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, half by heart, and half reading out of his paper,
<hi>Oh! how delicious is this meat, after a long fa<U+017F>t, which had contracted and <U+017F>hrunk
up my bowels, like <U+017F>corch'd parchment? What plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>hall I have henceforward, to
feed on tho<U+017F>e meats, whereof I had forgotten the ta<U+017F>te? I <U+017F>hall no longer believe that
my <U+017F>ervants are happier then my <U+017F>elf, as heretofore, when they ate their belly fulls,
I was always emptie.</hi> As he had done <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, the children of <hi>Boreas</hi> return'd
victorious, <U+017F>o that he <U+017F>poke the<U+017F>e words to them, as he read them word for word
in his paper, <hi>Sacred young men, you have re<U+017F>tor'd me my life, <U+017F>ince you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tor'd
me to eating. A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elves, that this good office <U+017F>hall not be an<U+017F>wered
with ingratitude. I will have a Temple built you as high as the clouds, where I
will every daie adore you as mo<U+017F>t favourable Gods.</hi> At the end of this he cryed
out aloud, <hi>FINIS;</hi> becau<U+017F>e <hi>Clarimond</hi> had written that word at the end of
his notes.</p>
            <p>After this, he retir'd to the Spectators, who applauded him, as if he had done
wonders, becau<U+017F>e the faults he had committed were <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant, that if he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd
the precepts had been given him, he had done nothing near <U+017F>o well. As for
the children of <hi>Boreas,</hi> they got into their ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, which <U+017F>et <U+017F>ail towards the I<U+017F>le of
<hi>Colchos,</hi> where was a fleece fa<U+017F>tned to a tree. The <hi>Argonauts</hi> being all landed, <hi>Ja<U+017F>on,</hi>
who <U+017F>eem'd to be <U+017F>touter then any of the re<U+017F>t, began to <U+017F>peak thus in his <hi>galima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias,
Behold the ground where are the greate<U+017F>t riches in the world, and where is a
world of riches. I alreadie <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>hining of that golden fleece, which with a ray fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
radiating, wounds the eies, and yet doth not hurt them, and makes us as much
live by hope, as we die for fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other Argonauts an<U+017F>wered to that in divers <U+017F>tyles; and they <U+017F>poke <U+017F>o loud,
that tho<U+017F>e on the other <U+017F>ide could hear them. A while after appear'd</hi> Medea, <hi>with
tho<U+017F>e temptations that <U+017F>tole away the liberty of</hi> Ja<U+017F>on. <hi>He pre<U+017F>ently courted her
in the<U+017F>e words,</hi> Fair <U+017F>oul of my <U+017F>oul, de<U+017F>ire of my de<U+017F>ire, the re<U+017F>idence of my concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
will you not believe that my libertie is <U+017F>acrific'd on the altar of your beauties?
<U+017F>ince I know you I am miraculou<U+017F>ly fallen in love with an amorous miracle; and all I
de<U+017F>ire, is but to die for you a living death, which is better then a drying life. But if
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43725:142"/>
your attracting <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s be changed into a cruelty <U+017F>o cruel, as mo<U+017F>t cruelly to de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e
me; and that the ability whereby you are able to heal me, finde impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility in its power,
doubt not but my amorous misfortune, and my unfortunate love will principitate me
headlong into <U+017F>ome precipice.</p>
            <p>All the fine words, wherewith you harne<U+017F>s your Language <hi>(replies</hi> Metaphorically
<hi>the Sorcere<U+017F>s</hi> Medea) cannot pour into my minde the belief of your love. I will not <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my <U+017F>elf to be lull'd a<U+017F>leep on the <U+017F>oft pillows of your words. You come out of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which is over glutted with fairer women then I am, and I <U+017F>hall never be bound up,
into <U+017F>o high a pre<U+017F>umption, as to per<U+017F>wade my <U+017F>elf that you are in<U+017F>nared in the lines of my
affection. And this makes me believe you have <U+017F>et up a <U+017F>hop of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation; but my
rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>tands <U+017F>o well on her guard, within the fort of my <U+017F>oul, that you need not hope
to take it by a<U+017F><U+017F>ault. I know well, if you were once entered there, you would put all
to fire and <U+017F>word, and you would <U+017F>ack even my firme<U+017F>t con<U+017F>tancy. I mu<U+017F>t not follow
the flags of folly, nor the cheating allurements which would bring me into the hook: I
had rather coo<U+017F>t along <U+017F>ome happy river, where I might be <U+017F>heltered from all misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
in the Haure de Grace of Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ja<U+017F>on</hi> and <hi>Medea,</hi> who were very able per<U+017F>ons, continued their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e a good
while, being of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tuff as what we have heard. Were they all to be written
down, with the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of the play, 'twere to put one book in another, and to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and importune the Reader with humors that are already <U+017F>tale, and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
loo<U+017F>e much of the grace they had when fir<U+017F>t acted. It <U+017F>hall then <U+017F>uffice me
to tell you, that <hi>Medea</hi> beings as much taken with the merit of <hi>Ja<U+017F>on,</hi> as <hi>Ja<U+017F>on</hi> was
with her beauty, gave him certain drugs for to lay a<U+017F>leep the waking dragon, that
watch'd the golden fleece. He came near the place where it was according to the
fable; but as he thought to take it, the dragon came and frighted him away. 'Twas
an engine made of Pa<U+017F>tboard, which a man plac'd within made to go. <hi>Ja<U+017F>on</hi> ca<U+017F>t
on it a certain liquor, and pre<U+017F>ently the bea<U+017F>t lay along without any motion; <U+017F>o
that he ea<U+017F>ily took down the fair fleece which he de<U+017F>ired, and took <hi>Medea</hi> by the
arm, for to embarque her in his ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, and bring her into <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having ob<U+017F>erved all this, was not content with the words which he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to <U+017F>peak, but he went and held <hi>Ja<U+017F>on</hi> by the arm; Thou <U+017F>halt not go <U+017F>o, <U+017F>ays he
to him, thou ha<U+017F>t done but half thy work: Doe<U+017F>t thou think the golden fleece
can be <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily obtain'd? Ha<U+017F>t thou not read that it is kept by Bulls with brazen
feet, and iron horns, as well as by the waking Dragon? Thou mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o charm
the<U+017F>e creatures, and make them <U+017F>ubmit their necks to the yoke for to til this ground,
wherein thou mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ow Serpens teeth. This fatal <U+017F>eed <U+017F>hall grow up, being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
with blood and venome, and <U+017F>hall produce armed men, again<U+017F>t whom thou
mu<U+017F>t fight, until a mutiny happening among<U+017F>t them, they ruine them<U+017F>elves. And
it is after the<U+017F>e Labours that thou <U+017F>halt de<U+017F>erve to be recompenc'd. Stay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here, or I <U+017F>wear there <U+017F>hall none of the <hi>Argonauts</hi> follow thee. Come away
then, let the Bulls be brought. We have not any here, <U+017F>ays <hi>Hircan;</hi> do you think
that all things can be <U+017F>o punctually repre<U+017F>ented? There is never any Comedy,
wherein <U+017F>ome things of the hi<U+017F>tory are not pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over in <U+017F>ilence; or it is made
believe, that what is mo<U+017F>t difficult, is done behinde the curtain, and is afterward
related on the <U+017F>tage. That way is worth nothing, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I would have all
things natural. I mu<U+017F>t have that done which I tell you, if you intend to act
parts with me. Now all our <U+017F>port is <U+017F>poiled for want of fore<U+017F>ight. But ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time let tho<U+017F>e that are charg'd with preparing things, forget nothing of what
is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having thus <U+017F>poken, got into the boat, with all tho<U+017F>e that were in the I<U+017F>le,
for it could not be denyed but the Comedy was hand<U+017F>omely performed. This
di<U+017F>order that had hapned in it, was more plea<U+017F>ant, then any thing of order; and
'twas good recreation to hear <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s complaints, who all that day left not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
with <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Hircan,</hi> for not having brought bulls into the I<U+017F>le. He
was at la<U+017F>t appeas'd, with promi<U+017F>es that all Comedies <U+017F>hould be acted very magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently,
or el<U+017F>e that they would act none at all; and his propo<U+017F>ition was, That,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43725:143"/>
when they had caus'd cloathes of all fa<U+017F>hions to be made, they might repre<U+017F>ent all
<hi>Ovids Metamorpho<U+017F>es</hi> one after another; and then all <hi>Virgils Aeneads,</hi> be<U+017F>ides
<U+017F>ome other Poetical fictions. 'Twas conceiv'd it might be excellent pa<U+017F>time to <U+017F>ee
<U+017F>o many Fables <U+017F>o conceitedly repre<U+017F>ented, and yet <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> met with extream delays,
becau<U+017F>e the world is pleas'd with change, and that the Company were re<U+017F>olved to
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e otherwi<U+017F>e of them<U+017F>elves; and be<U+017F>ides, it would have been a very difficult
matter to repre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal actions as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> did imagine; for when there
<U+017F>hould be occa<U+017F>ion that <U+017F>ome Gods <U+017F>hould have come down from heaven, by what
invention could it have been done? That could not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily have been repre<U+017F>ented,
as hell, which might have been <U+017F>ignified by <U+017F>ome Quarry, or <U+017F>ome low brick
oven.</p>
            <p>But our Shepherd had yet a much <U+017F>tranger de<U+017F>ign; for the more natural acting
of a Comedy, he thought not <U+017F>ufficient to make u<U+017F>e of one <U+017F>cene; becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>aid he,
<U+017F>ometimes they had to repre<U+017F>ent things done in divers Countrys; he therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired
that what was done in a village, <U+017F>hould be done in a village; and that which
had been done on a mountain, <U+017F>hould be done on a mountain; though haply the
Actors mu<U+017F>t have walk a League, before they could come to one; <U+017F>o that the
Spectators mu<U+017F>t have a great deal of trouble to follow them from place to place:
and go along with them <U+017F>ometimes about a <U+017F>pring, <U+017F>ometimes follow them into a
Temple to <U+017F>ee them act their parts.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s way, and not to build upon the <U+017F>tage Ca<U+017F>tles of Pa<U+017F>tbord, and
to call the <U+017F>eene <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Thrace,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Greece.</hi> You may ea<U+017F>ily perceive by
the<U+017F>e extraordinary imaginations, that his de<U+017F>ire was to come as near as he could
to the truth: But <U+017F>o many difficulties could not but be very importune and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<U+017F>om:
Be<U+017F>ides, it was con<U+017F>idered, that if they continued any while to act plays
<U+017F>o publikely, the Nobility for twenty leagues about would have come to <U+017F>ee the
<U+017F>port, and haply would have laughted at <U+017F>uch conceits, which could not be to the
liking of all the world; for it happened to this true repre<U+017F>entation, as it did to this
<U+017F>imple relation which I make of it, which haply will not plea<U+017F>e your vulgar
mindes, who under<U+017F>tand not what true Satyre is. Some Country people and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
who pa<U+017F>t by the way, <U+017F>taid to <U+017F>ee the Comedy of our Shepherds, and had left
them not without a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, thinking they had all <U+017F>ome worm of folly in their
heads.</p>
            <p>The diver<U+017F>ion of Comedies was therefore quite hi<U+017F>s'd out, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had now
nothing of greater concernment to think on, then to know whether his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s had
<U+017F>een nothing of all this, becau<U+017F>e he was afraid <U+017F>he had not vouch<U+017F>afed to appear.
Though <U+017F>he had not <U+017F>tirr'd out of the hou<U+017F>e, yet did they make him believe, that
<U+017F>he had been to <U+017F>ee the Conque<U+017F>t of the <hi>golden fleece,</hi> for a while, and that <U+017F>he was
return'd with the fir<U+017F>t. I am certain <U+017F>he takes no plea<U+017F>ure in any thing of all that
I do, <U+017F>aies the <hi>Shepherd;</hi> but <U+017F>ince in all my pa<U+017F>t actions <U+017F>he hath not found <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
te<U+017F>timonies of my affection, I am re<U+017F>olved my death <U+017F>hall convince her of it.
Moderate thy de<U+017F>pair, incomparable Shepherd, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan;</hi> Thou mu<U+017F>t not end
thy life without the will of the Gods: Thou art obliged to pre<U+017F>erve thy <U+017F>elf for the
good of others, for thou art not only born for thy <U+017F>elf. I now tell thee in good
earne<U+017F>t, that it is thou that art the <hi>Dove,</hi> that mu<U+017F>t be chang'd into an <hi>Eagle.</hi> The
time is now come that I mu<U+017F>t expound my prophe<U+017F>ie to thee: thou mu<U+017F>t now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
that peaceable compo<U+017F>ition of minde, for a mar<U+017F>hal courage; and it is only
by thy means that <hi>Meliantes</hi>'s Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s mu<U+017F>t be belivered out of pri<U+017F>on. That thou
maye<U+017F>t under<U+017F>tand how this may be accompli<U+017F>hed, know, I will make thee as invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
as ever <hi>Achilles</hi> was. If thou can<U+017F>t do that, learned Magician, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
there is no doubt but I will as confidently engage in all combats, as any <hi>Heroes</hi> that
ever was. I never boa<U+017F>t of any thing I cannot accompli<U+017F>h, replied <hi>Hircan:</hi> but
thou art to know, that thou can<U+017F>t not bring the adventure about, without the
Shepherd <hi>Carmelin,</hi> though the Magician of the enchanted Ca<U+017F>tle did not mention
him: The Gods have revealed this to me; be<U+017F>ides, the courteous <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>hall be
equally incapable of being wounded, for I will not favour him le<U+017F>s then his ma<U+017F>ter.</p>

the De<U+017F>tinies, and fore<U+017F>aw things to come, why did <U+017F>he not make armour-proof
that dangerous part of <hi>Achilles</hi> his body? Knew <U+017F>he not well enough, that when
his enemies once had notice there were a part of his body could not be hurt, they
would not make at that, and would di<U+017F>patch him as <U+017F>oon as another that had but a
common body? Be<U+017F>ides, I know not how <U+017F>he ordered the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
his heel to be <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, as to be capable of a mortal wound. The wounds
which we may any way receive about the feet, are not dangerous; nay though it
were the <hi>Gangrene,</hi> there were no more then cutting off the foot, to hinder it from
gaining on the heart, and con<U+017F>equently that the party die not. Had this <hi>Thetis</hi> been
minded to make <hi>Achilles</hi> ab<U+017F>olutely invulnerable, why did <U+017F>he not put him quite
under water, and hold him by the hair of the head, and not hold him by a part
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43725:144"/>
which mu<U+017F>t needs keep dry, and con<U+017F>equently remain mortal; if his hair were not
yet come, why did <U+017F>he not plunge his feet in after his head? You forget your <U+017F>elf,
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Hircan,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t not go <U+017F>o far in reforming the actions of the Divinities.
It mu<U+017F>t be believed, that whatever they have done hath been for the be<U+017F>t. Were you
<hi>Clarimond</hi> who carps at all things, you could <U+017F>ay no more. Yet I excu<U+017F>e you for the
pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ince 'tis only the fear you are in le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould not do my duty, makes you
<U+017F>peak thus; and you would advi<U+017F>e me, if I were to thru<U+017F>t you over head and ears
in <U+017F>ome water, to wa<U+017F>h your members one after another. But know there's no need
of all this: My charms are <U+017F>o powerfull, as to make you invulnerable with le<U+017F>s
ceremony then was u<U+017F>ed by the Divinities. How do you properly explain that
word of <hi>Invulnerable?</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin.</hi> That is to <U+017F>ay, a thing that cannot be hurt
or wounded, replies <hi>Hircan.</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you then let my Breeches have its part of
your charms, replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that it may never be hurt by u<U+017F>e nor accident. If
there are wounds in thy cloaths, replies <hi>Hircan,</hi> make plai<U+017F>ters for them of the
<U+017F>ame <U+017F>tuffe; I do not employ my Art in things <U+017F>o low. But let's have no more
prating, be <U+017F>ilent; I mu<U+017F>t charm you two with as much efficacie, as if you were in
the Palace of <hi>Circe</hi> the Suns daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> having <U+017F>aid this, did <U+017F>ome extraordinary ceremonies, and repeated <U+017F>ome
barbarous words: Then <U+017F>aid he to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi> A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elves that
nothing can henceforth hurt you: You have no more to do then to get into my
Coach, which <U+017F>hall infallibly carry you to the enchanted Ca<U+017F>tle, where the fair
<hi>Pamphilia</hi> is. The two Shepherds went along with him out of the chamber into
the hall, where the company expected them. <hi>Hircan</hi> giving each of them a <U+017F>tick
in his hand, bid them <U+017F>trike at an old earthen pot, which they pre<U+017F>ently broke in
pieces. See you, <U+017F>ays he to them, it will be as ea<U+017F>ie for you to break the head of a
mon<U+017F>ter, as to break this ve<U+017F><U+017F>el. As for your parts, nothing can hurt you; and
that it is <U+017F>o, you <U+017F>hall now try. In <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, <hi>Hircan</hi> took a Fire-pan; and making
as if he would give <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> a good blow, he moderated the violence of his arm when
he was neer his <U+017F>houlders. 'Tis true, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> thou ha<U+017F>t but tickled me a little.
Let me al<U+017F>o know what it is, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin. Hircan</hi> thereupon turn'd the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan
from the place where he <U+017F>eem'd to <U+017F>trike, and di<U+017F>charg'd it on <hi>Carmelins</hi> but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks,
but <U+017F>o roughtly, that he made him <U+017F>cratch him<U+017F>elf a good while after. This is
no je<U+017F>ting, <U+017F>ays he; methinks I <U+017F>hould have been arm'd there. All this is well,
replies <hi>Hircan:</hi> Thou <U+017F>halt never <U+017F>uffer more hurt then thou ha<U+017F>t now felt; for
tho<U+017F>e whom thou art to deal with are not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong as I am; and this is to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
thee thou <U+017F>halt never receive wound after what I have given thee. <hi>Carmelin</hi> being
a little comforted by this, wi<U+017F>h'd for more pots and gla<U+017F><U+017F>es for to try his forces
on; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>ire, if <hi>Hircan</hi> had kept them any longer at their
exerci<U+017F>e. He therefore would di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s them pre<U+017F>ently; but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>poke to him in
this manner: Learned Magician! what do<U+017F>t thou think on? See<U+017F>t thou not we
have yet our garments of <hi>peace</hi> on? We <U+017F>hall be nothing terrible, if we have not
<hi>warlike</hi> habits on. For my part, I will be like a <hi>Heros,</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e I will not hence.
Ha<U+017F>t thou not ob<U+017F>erved that repre<U+017F>entation of <hi>The<U+017F>eus</hi> de<U+017F>cent into hell, which
thou ha<U+017F>t in thy <U+017F>tudy? Since I am to fight with Mon<U+017F>ters and Robbers, as that
brave Warriour did, I will be accoutred as he was.</p>
            <p>This put <hi>Hircan</hi> in mind of an old blew Guard-coat he had in the bottom of a
che<U+017F>t, which had <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>erv'd him in a mask: His man went and fetch'd it, and
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having viewed it, found it for his purpo<U+017F>e. He took off his doublet for to put
it on; but becau<U+017F>e it was half-<U+017F>leev'd, and was plated, and had little <U+017F>ilver-nails, he
turn'd up his <U+017F>hirt above his elbow, and fa<U+017F>tened it there with pins, for to have his
arms bare, as your ancient Warriours are painted. He would al<U+017F>o needs have his
thights bare, <U+017F>o that he went into the Wardrobe, where he put off his breeches and
his drawers, and ty'd up the fore and hind-part of his <U+017F>hirt. When he had done,
there were buskins brought him, which he had before ask'd for, he would put them
on his bare legs, and in this equipage he came back to the re<U+017F>t. Somebody told him,
that he was very well accommodated according to the ancient mode, but nothing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43725:145"/>
to the pre<U+017F>ent, and that there was no Captain in the Kings Army that was <U+017F>o. Let
them follow their fancie, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and let me alone to follow mine. They <U+017F>hall
not make me believe that a <U+017F>ort of raw younger brothers under<U+017F>tand the <hi>Militia</hi>
as well as <U+017F>o many invincible <hi>Heroes</hi> that are placed in heaven. I <U+017F>hould not make
known my de<U+017F>ire to be of their number, if I did not imitate them as well in their
modes as in their manners. Be<U+017F>ides 'tis not to be thought I am the only man of this
age, that is clad as you <U+017F>ee me: I can <U+017F>hew you how that the mo<U+017F>t able men that we
have, are cloathed as I am. 'Tis true they are <hi>Writers,</hi> but it it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F>s'd
they are <hi>Warriours</hi> too, <U+017F>ince they have the confidence to be in the <U+017F>ame garb as
<hi>The<U+017F>eus, Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Ajax.</hi> If it be replied again, They are not men of arms, I
will tell them that I have <U+017F>o much the more rea<U+017F>on to be clad like a <hi>Hero,</hi> <U+017F>ince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
of <U+017F>o mean quality pre<U+017F>ume to do it.</p>
            <p>Upon that he call'd for the Works of <U+017F>even or eight French <hi>Poets</hi> which <hi>Hircan</hi>
had in his Study, and he <U+017F>hewed them all, how at the beginning of every book
the Authors had cau<U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves to be drawn with <hi>Cor<U+017F>lets</hi> according to the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
mode. He concluded they went <U+017F>o clad, <U+017F>ince they were <U+017F>o drawn; and that
they mu<U+017F>t needs grant him that, or freely confe<U+017F>s that tho<U+017F>e people were very fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<U+017F>tick
and very extravagant, to be drawn in that po<U+017F>ture. That which was mo<U+017F>t ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
was the picture of a <hi>Poet</hi> that was a <hi>Coun<U+017F>ellor,</hi> who in<U+017F>tead of his <hi>long robe</hi>
had as the re<U+017F>t a <hi>Ca<U+017F>aque,</hi> after the ancient mode, like a <hi>Heros</hi> in a Medal, though
his countenance was the mo<U+017F>t pedantick thing in the world. Be<U+017F>ides, to avoid the
word <hi>Coun<U+017F>ellor,</hi> which he thought not Court-like enough for a Love-book as his
was, he had put for his quality.</p>
            <p>All having <U+017F>ufficiently laughted at the<U+017F>e excellent imaginations, they told <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
that he yet wanted <U+017F>omwhat for to be ab<U+017F>olutely accommodated to their imitation,
and that was, that he had no Crown of Laurel on his head. Nor have I yet gotten
any Victory, replies the new Warriour; I mu<U+017F>t wear only a Ca<U+017F>quet till that time.
But there is another thing wanting which you think not on: Do you not <U+017F>ee that
the<U+017F>e <hi>Heroes</hi> have I know not what about their necks? I cannot tell you what it is,
and yet I mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>uch an ornament. Certainly 'tis a Napkin, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Clarimond.</hi>
Thou art deceived, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that's unworthily <U+017F>poken of <hi>Heroes,</hi> they are only
Tavern-boys that carry napkins on their <U+017F>houlders. So do al<U+017F>o the Sewers in Kings
hou<U+017F>es, replies <hi>Clarimond:</hi> But now I have better con<U+017F>idered it, I'll tell you what
it is. 'Tis true, it is a Napkin; but about the necks of the<U+017F>e people it is tied with a
knot upon their right <U+017F>houlder, as if they were a trimming, and I believe the Painter
came to draw them when the Barber was <U+017F>etting up their mu<U+017F>tachoes, and that they
were repre<U+017F>ented in the po<U+017F>ture they were then in. Do not thou believe that, <U+017F>ayes
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> it never was a Napkin, now I know the truth what it is; 'tis a Scarf which
the<U+017F>e gallant men wear for a note of di<U+017F>tinction between them and your common
Gentlemen, who wear theirs under their arm: I mu<U+017F>t needs have <U+017F>uch a one. I will
give you a blue one, if you will wear it, <U+017F>ays <hi>Hircan.</hi> I thank thee for that proffer,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> But let us not go to work with <U+017F>o little con<U+017F>ideration. I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the<U+017F>e Scarfs which Heroes <U+017F>hould wear are <hi>blue,</hi> or <hi>red,</hi> or <hi>green,</hi> or <hi>yellow:</hi>
I am of opinion they are <hi>white,</hi> for to <U+017F>ignifie the <hi>candor</hi> of their <U+017F>ouls. That's very
hard to determine, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Clarimond;</hi> for all ours are Copper-cuts, and here's no
limming to <U+017F>hew what colour the cloaths are of. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hath rea<U+017F>on to believe that
his Scarf <U+017F>hould be white, <U+017F>ays <hi>Hircan;</hi> the <hi>white</hi> is the colour of new-made Knights,
he mu<U+017F>t bear it, though I have heard <U+017F>ay his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es colour is <hi>red.</hi> But this is the
mi<U+017F>ery, that we have not ever a white <U+017F>carf. There is only one remedy; I will give
him a Napkin as fine as any <U+017F>ilk. In the time of the <hi>Ligue,</hi> the hone<U+017F>t Citizens which
were Royali<U+017F>ts had no other <U+017F>carfs to <U+017F>hew which party they were of. I will not
contradict thee in any thing, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>o great is my de<U+017F>ire to be immediately
accommodated according to the ancient mode. Give me what <U+017F>carf thou plea<U+017F>e<U+017F>t,
whether it be <U+017F>ilk, or whether it be thread; it will make me very brave, and very
proud, <U+017F>ince it comes from thy hand.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Hircan</hi> went to fetch him a fair clean Napkin, which he put about his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:43725:145"/>
and fa<U+017F>tened it with a red riban upon his <U+017F>houlder, that he might at lea<U+017F>t by that
little knot have <hi>Charite</hi> in minde. They both in the mean time <U+017F>earch'd into their
books, to <U+017F>ee if they did any thing which were not conformable to the pourtraictures
of the Poets.</p>
            <p>When the Shepherd was accommodated to his minde, <hi>Hircan</hi> put on his head
and old head-piece; but he told him, he yet wanted a <U+017F>word, and entreated <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
who had a good one to lend it him. <hi>Hircan</hi> an<U+017F>wered him, he had another
fitter for him, becau<U+017F>e it was an old fa<U+017F>hion'd one. He caus'd it and a belt to be
brought, and girt it about <hi>Ly<U+017F>is. Carmelin</hi> ob<U+017F>erv'd all this my<U+017F>tery without <U+017F>aying
any thing; and his ma<U+017F>ter calling him to minde, acquainted <hi>Hircan,</hi> that he al<U+017F>o
mu<U+017F>t be accommodated like an Heroes of Antiquity. <hi>Hircan</hi> an<U+017F>wer'd, it was
enough for him to have arms according to the pre<U+017F>ent mode, becau<U+017F>e he was not <U+017F>o
de<U+017F>erving as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> <U+017F>o that having <U+017F>ent for old armor, that had been his great
Grandfathers, he was forc'd to put them on, much again<U+017F>t his minde. Never was
man more amaz'd then <hi>Carmelin,</hi> when they had endors'd him with the Cor<U+017F>elet, and
fa<U+017F>tened on the arm pieces and the Ta<U+017F>les. He <U+017F>aid, they put him into an iron pri<U+017F>on,
but it was wor<U+017F>e when they put on the head piece: he told them, that they put his
head into a Kettle, and would never <U+017F>uffer the vi<U+017F>or to be let down. <hi>Hircan</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
with his continual complaints, made him believe, that though his body
were as invulnerable as his Ma<U+017F>ters, yet was he not <U+017F>o valiant as he, and that to
heighten his courage, 'twas not ami<U+017F>s for him to be arm'd Cap-a-pea. What u<U+017F>e
<U+017F>hall I have of the<U+017F>e arms? replied he; they cumber me <U+017F>o, that I know not where
I am. I cannot carry my hand to my mouth, I cannot advance one foot before
another; and I am loaden, as if I carried a Tower.</p>
            <p>This burthen will <U+017F>eem light to thee after a while, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan;</hi> and thereupon
having put into his hand a Target of tann'd leather, he told <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> it was time to
be gone. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> an<U+017F>wered he was ready, if they would but give him a Javelin, or a
half-pike. But the Magician a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him he <U+017F>hould never need any; <U+017F>o that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to be gone; and having embrac'd all that were pre<U+017F>ent, one after another,
he went down into the Court. He got into the coach with <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was
very glad to <U+017F>it down and re<U+017F>t him with his burthen. This is then the Chariot that
mu<U+017F>t carry us to the enchanted Ca<U+017F>tle, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I have look'd on the hor<U+017F>es,
but I cannot <U+017F>ee any wings they have, though the Magician a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me divers times
they had. When you are once within, their wings will begin to appear, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can;</hi>
and yet I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that for the pre<U+017F>ent there will be no u<U+017F>e for them, as
long as there is any ground for them to go on; they <U+017F>hall not take their flight, till
they come to the <U+017F>ea: Then <U+017F>hall you go <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, that you <U+017F>hall think the coach
moves not at all: And there will be yet another miracle, and that is, that days <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>eem but minutes to you. When you come near the enchanted Ca<U+017F>tle, a Magician,
a friend of mine, will invite you to re<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elves in a neighbouring I<U+017F>le which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to him: Do not you refu<U+017F>e his proffers. We will ob<U+017F>erve thy directions,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but before I part, do me the favour as to let me <U+017F>ee <hi>Meliantes,</hi> for
whom <hi>I</hi> am to do <U+017F>o many warlike exploits. This Gentleman had ever <U+017F>ince <U+017F>upper
been bu<U+017F>ie in writing of letters to <hi>Paris;</hi> they went to him, and bid him give over,
if he would <U+017F>ee the departure of the valorous Champions. He with a fained joy
came to them, and a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he came into the Court, cryed out, O Generous War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors!
<U+017F>ince you undertake to deliver my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s out of captivity, I be<U+017F>eech hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
pro<U+017F>per your arms: Farewell my dear friends, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elves you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
a man will <U+017F>erve you in life and death. Farewel friend, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> be confident
I'll do any thing I can for thy <U+017F>atisfaction: I de<U+017F>ire no other requital of thee, but
that to morrow morning thou go to the Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors of the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ian</hi> Shepherds, and
bid them return to tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ent them, and give them an account how I live, and
how happy they may be with me. If they be here before my return, I de<U+017F>ire <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
to appoint a Harbinger to take up lodging for them, for they will be a great
number; but above all things, let there be a care had that no di<U+017F>order or falling
out happen about the pa<U+017F>tures. I hope in a <U+017F>hort time to be back to regulate all
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:43725:146"/>
things my <U+017F>elf. As for my Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Adrian,</hi> who returns by this way, I <U+017F>hall be glad
to mi<U+017F>s him, and that he get him to <hi>Paris</hi> without me. You may tell him what high
enterpri<U+017F>es have taken me up. And as concerning my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, whom I re<U+017F>erve to
the la<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e I cannot <U+017F>peak of her without dying a thou<U+017F>and times of grief:
Alas! I need <U+017F>end her no excu<U+017F>es for my ab<U+017F>ence, for I have well ob<U+017F>erv'd <U+017F>he was
never much pleas'd at my pre<U+017F>ence.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ended the<U+017F>e words, they made fa<U+017F>t the boots of the coach with chains,
and the Coachman drave on, taking his way towards a hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Hircans,</hi> which was
about a league off. This Gentleman bethought him of this extravagant invention to
make more <U+017F>port with the humors of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is. Amarillis</hi> was return'd to her own hou<U+017F>e
before night; <U+017F>o that having no Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s to entertain, he went from his Ca<U+017F>tle with
the re<U+017F>t, and follow'd the coach of the two Warriors. They follow'd a good way
off on hor<U+017F>e-back; and when they came to the Countrey-hou<U+017F>e, they found the
hor<U+017F>es taken out the coach, and that left under an arch of the hou<U+017F>e near the gate.
They alighted with as little noi<U+017F>e as they could, and went to hearken what the brave
Champions <U+017F>aid. See<U+017F>t thou <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> how true is every thing that
<hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>aies? This Magician a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd us, that when we came to the <U+017F>ea, his hor<U+017F>es
<U+017F>hould take their flight, and would go <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, that we <U+017F>hould think we <U+017F>tirr'd not
from the place. That it is <U+017F>o, do<U+017F>t not ob<U+017F>erve how that the coach <U+017F>tirs not all?
nay, we do not <U+017F>o much as hear the wheels, though its to be thought they turn
round as they pa<U+017F>s through the clouds. The rea<U+017F>on of that is, becau<U+017F>e extreamity
of motion <U+017F>eems to be immobility; and to this purpo<U+017F>e, I will teach thee an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
piece of learning. A while ago I read <hi>Ovids Metamorpho<U+017F>es,</hi> where I found
that the dog <hi>Laelaps,</hi> which had been pre<U+017F>ented to <hi>Cephalus,</hi> pur<U+017F>ued a bea<U+017F>t <U+017F>o live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that one went no fa<U+017F>ter then the other. The bea<U+017F>t run as fa<U+017F>t as the dog; <U+017F>o
that they were <U+017F>till at the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>tance, and <hi>Laelaps</hi> gave many <U+017F>natches in the
air in vain. At la<U+017F>t the Hunter <hi>Cephalus</hi> having recour<U+017F>e to his dart, was quite out
of him<U+017F>elf, when thinking to ca<U+017F>t it at the bea<U+017F>t, he found that the dog and it were
nothing but marble <U+017F>tatues, which were fa<U+017F>tned in the mid<U+017F>t of the field. Having <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
very much to finde a hand<U+017F>ome explication of this, it came into my minde,
that the Poets <U+017F>aying that the<U+017F>e two creatures were chang'd into <U+017F>tatues, was to
repre<U+017F>ent the extream <U+017F>wiftne<U+017F>s of their cour<U+017F>e, and to teach men, what I now would,
that extream motion comes neare<U+017F>t to re<U+017F>t. This is a delicate expo<U+017F>ition it mu<U+017F>t be
confe<U+017F>t, and I would not have it peri<U+017F>h, though my ordinary Tenent is, that Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morpho<U+017F>es
are rather truths then fictions; for I <U+017F>ee not how this can anyway pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
my opinion: Let it be taken for an Allegory, rather then a Mythology. 'Tis
well known the learned<U+017F>t Doctors do allegorize on the greate<U+017F>t verities in the world.
But to return to my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> thou art to believe, that the extream <U+017F>wift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of our Chariot, hinders us to perceive its motion. Thou art not a man <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h,
but thou ha<U+017F>t often <U+017F>een experience of what I would per<U+017F>wade thee too. If thou
turn a <U+017F>tick or a <U+017F>tring very fa<U+017F>t about, thou can<U+017F>t not ob<U+017F>erve the divers turns of it.
And by this means would our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es deceive us in every thing, if the under<U+017F>tanding
which governs and directs them, did not a<U+017F><U+017F>ure us things were otherwi<U+017F>e then they
are repre<U+017F>ented. As much Philo<U+017F>ophy as you will, replies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but tell me
not that our hor<U+017F>es flie. When you tell me we are now in the air; there's not a
vein about me that trembles not; and believe me, were it not that I am with you,
and that I think I cannot come to any ill fortune in your company, I <U+017F>hould cry
out murther. Thou would<U+017F>t frighten the hor<U+017F>es, which haply would precipitate thee
into thee <U+017F>ea, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> 'tis better be <U+017F>ilent: it may be they'll flie <U+017F>o high, that
they'll carry us into heaven, where we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e things whereof <hi>A<U+017F>trologers</hi>
<U+017F>peak only by conjecture: then <U+017F>hall we be able to make <hi>Almanacks,</hi> better then
any they <U+017F>ell at <hi>Paris,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e thou did<U+017F>t <U+017F>ometimes make. I will al<U+017F>o calculate
Nativities; and that I may not fail in my <U+017F>peculations, I will hold the <U+017F>tars in my
hands, and finde by looking on them, what fortunes they promi<U+017F>e my friends: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be animate, or whether they can <U+017F>peak, or whether they have every one
an intelligence that conducts them, and <U+017F>peaks for them: I <U+017F>hall endeavor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ult
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43725:146"/>
with them about their <U+017F>everal influences, and que<U+017F>tion them upon other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
We will thence go to the <hi>Colledge,</hi> where the <hi>Souls</hi> learn before they are
born what they mu<U+017F>t one day know. In that place there are good Spirits which
are <hi>Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors</hi> among them, who put them to mighty di<U+017F>cipline, if they profit not
under their in<U+017F>tructions. <hi>Plato</hi> never thought of this, though he hath <U+017F>poken <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
of <hi>Remini<U+017F>cence.</hi> We <U+017F>hall al<U+017F>o meet with the two <hi>Tuns</hi> wherein <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
according to <hi>Homer's</hi> <U+017F>aying, puts in all the Good and Evil which he <U+017F>ends among
men. I would have thee bring away with thee a Wallet-full of the Good thou <U+017F>halt
find, that thou may<U+017F>t never more complain of being unhappy. I hope we <U+017F>hall al<U+017F>o
be <U+017F>hewn the <hi>Ideas</hi> of all things in the world, and that we may come thither <U+017F>o
happily, as that we may be pre<U+017F>ent at the ceremony of <U+017F>ome <hi>Apotheo<U+017F>is,</hi> that is to
<U+017F>ay, we <U+017F>hall be there when <U+017F>ome illu<U+017F>trious man is made a God. How <U+017F>hall we <U+017F>ee
any thing, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>ince we are now as deep in the dark, as if we were in
our mothers bellies? Hope better and better, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> <U+017F>ome good Angel will
come and deliver us out of this ca<U+017F>e wherein we are now lock'd up. Ah wretch that I
am, replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I may well <U+017F>ay I am double-cas'd: be<U+017F>ides the ca<U+017F>e of our Coach,
I am lock'd up into my Arms as an Oy<U+017F>ter in the <U+017F>hell, or a knife in a <U+017F>heath.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen having heard the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, whereat they were ravi<U+017F>h'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
every one into the lodging a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd him; there they laugh'd it out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to leave the valorous Champions in the coach till the morning. They had
word brought them, that they had given over di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing; <U+017F>o that they inferr'd
they were a<U+017F>leep; and becau<U+017F>e it was <U+017F>omewhat late, they all laid them down
to re<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> awoke at three in the morning, <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate was he for the humours of
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and <U+017F>oon after he made the re<U+017F>t get up and make them<U+017F>elves ready to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent
this valiant Shepherd. All things being ready, he went to the coach, and
having opened the boots, he with a counterfeit voyce call'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> He, who was
not a<U+017F>leep, ask'd him pre<U+017F>ently what he would with him. Know that I am the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician
which mu<U+017F>t conduct thee to the enchanted Ca<U+017F>tle, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Hircan;</hi> come out
and follow me: Let the good man that is with thee, come al<U+017F>o. Upon that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
call'd <hi>Carmelin</hi> as loud as he could, but yet he awaked not; the encumbrance of
his arms, it <U+017F>eems, hindred not his re<U+017F>t. His Ma<U+017F>ter at length call'd him <U+017F>o often,
that he awoke; but he bidding him come out of the Coach, he told him 'twas a
thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to do, and that he thought he was nail'd to it, <U+017F>o heavy
was the burden he had upon him. Upon that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and the Magician took him out
of his place by force: Hold by the tail of my gown, <U+017F>ays the Magician to the two
Warriours, I will bring you under ground to the place where you de<U+017F>ire to go.
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> took <hi>Hircan</hi> by the gown, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> took <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> by his <U+017F>hort coat; and
thus they pa<U+017F>s'd through ob<U+017F>cure <U+017F>tables, where the two Warriours were in as much
fear one as another. At la<U+017F>t <hi>Hircan</hi> having brought them down certain <U+017F>tairs, told
them he mu<U+017F>t leave them, and that now they need but come forwards, and be <U+017F>ure
to be on their guards. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>orry to leave <U+017F>o good a guide, pa<U+017F>s'd along a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
at the end whereof was a great Cellar, where there was <U+017F>ome light, by rea<U+017F>on
of two candles <U+017F>tuck to the wall. Before he went in, he ask'd <hi>Carmelin</hi> whether he
had a good <U+017F>word, or no. I a <U+017F>word! <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I never dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>ee one naked;
I could better handle a Hedg-bill: you never thought to give me one, and I never
thought to ask you for one. I have here a great Flake to defend my <U+017F>elf (for <U+017F>o he
call'd his Buckler) but I would to God, continued he, I had my Smoothing-plane
for to <U+017F>mooth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the no<U+017F>es of the Mon<U+017F>ters we <U+017F>hall meet with, or that I had my
Wimble to bore holes in their buttocks! Since thou art armed only for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen<U+017F>ive,
and not for the offen<U+017F>ive part, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t fight for thee; and I
am not <U+017F>orry for it, for the greater will be my glory. Let us advance then, and <U+017F>ee
in what kind of place we are.</p>
            <p>The two Warriours were no <U+017F>ooner entred the Cellar, but they perceiv'd the
forms of two Gyants making towards them. The<U+017F>e two Mon<U+017F>ters running towards
them, <U+017F>ometimes became as little as men of ordinary <U+017F>tature; then pre<U+017F>ently they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43725:147"/>
lifted up their heads to the roof, as if their necks were lengthened by <U+017F>crues. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
finding him<U+017F>elf per<U+017F>ecuted by one of the<U+017F>e Gyants, cry'd out as loud as if he
had been flaid alive. But his ma<U+017F>ter ob<U+017F>erving that they had no arms, he was not <U+017F>o
much afraid, and imagined there were no more to do but to cut off that long neck
that made them <U+017F>eem terrible. He went to draw his <U+017F>word, but it was <U+017F>o ru<U+017F>ty that
it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to get it out of the <U+017F>cabberd. 'Twas then he thought him<U+017F>elf an
improvident Warriour, to come to a combat without <U+017F>eeing that his arms were fixt.
Yet in nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to make u<U+017F>e of what he had, he took the <U+017F>word out of the belt, and
with it as it was in the <U+017F>cabberd he be<U+017F>tow'd good blows on the Gyants necks, but
he did them no hurt, for he <U+017F>truck only again<U+017F>t a <U+017F>tick covered about with cour<U+017F>e
cloaths, at the end whereof was a fal<U+017F>e head, which he that was under lifted up and
let down at his plea<U+017F>ure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> acted this part, and 'twas no <U+017F>mall plea<U+017F>ure to them to
terrifie the Warriours. But at la<U+017F>t <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> perceiving he was never the neerer cutting
off their heads, directed his blows below, which made them run away as fa<U+017F>t as they
could, the <U+017F>ame way that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> were come thither. I need not de<U+017F>pair
though I cannot draw my <U+017F>word, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> The<U+017F>e are evil <hi>Spirits,</hi> which as <U+017F>oon
as they are touch'd with any weapon what<U+017F>oever, <U+017F>uffer a <hi><U+017F>olution</hi> of <hi>continuity</hi> (to
<U+017F>peak in Philo<U+017F>ophical terms:) Let them come in multitudes; the more they are,
the more will be my victories.</p>
            <p>While the valiant Shepherd <U+017F>aid this, there i<U+017F><U+017F>ued out at a little door three hulch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back'd
fellows, who had faces <U+017F>o ugly, as could not be look'd on without horror.
One of them, which was <hi>Philiris,</hi> began to <U+017F>ound an alarm on a Barrels head with
two <U+017F>ticks, as if he had beaten a Drum; and the other two, who were <hi>Meliantes</hi>
and <hi>Polidor,</hi> came and gave <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> a many blows with the breadth of
their <U+017F>words. How now, Ra<U+017F>cals! (<U+017F>ays one of them with a hollow hoar<U+017F>e voice)
we'll <U+017F>end you back again to keep your <U+017F>heep: 'Tis a fine employment for <U+017F>uch
Ru<U+017F>ticks to go clad like Knights, and to imagine they can bring about the <U+017F>trange<U+017F>t
adventure in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in the mean time avoided the blowes the be<U+017F>t he could: And as for <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
having not the wit to put them off with his buckler, he held it by one end
as if it had been a trencher, and at la<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>t it at the head of one of the mon<U+017F>ters.
He would afterwards have gladly run away; but he found his Arms <U+017F>o heavy, that
he thought them a greater hinderance then help to him. For to be therefore rid of
them, and to do <U+017F>ome good with them by leaving them behind him, he <U+017F>trove to
get them off. The thongs of his Head-piece were <U+017F>o worne, that they were ea<U+017F>ily
broken; <U+017F>o that he took it with both hands and threw it at his enemies: He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
took off the Arm-pieces, and <U+017F>ent them the <U+017F>ame way; and then he unlac'd
his Armour and hurl'd it at them, till he was quite di<U+017F>arm'd. Some of his blowes
reach'd them <U+017F>o home, that they had a great de<U+017F>ire to return them. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
renewed their charge both on the ma<U+017F>ter and man; though only <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and gave them <U+017F>ome blows on the bunch they had before, which <U+017F>erv'd them
for a brea<U+017F>t-plate. At la<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e two Mon<U+017F>ters got the two Warriours <U+017F>o neer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that with a thru<U+017F>t they laid them on the ground. They fell down upon
them; and after they had well pinch'd their no<U+017F>es, and pull'd them by the ears, they
ran away with him that beat the drum. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> had much ado to
get up again, <U+017F>o weak were they grown; yet did they firmly per<U+017F>wade them<U+017F>elves
they were the Conquerours, <U+017F>ince they were ma<U+017F>ters of the field. Ah Cowards!
cries out <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you are run away to die in <U+017F>ome hole; for the hurts we have
given you will not <U+017F>uffer you to live long: You were a<U+017F>ham'd to die before us; but
if you come in my way, I will give you good bangs after you are dead. 'Tis not
yet time to brag, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> 'tis want of con<U+017F>ideration, rather then true valour,
makes thee <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o big. What wilt thou do, poor fellow, if there be yet more
enemies? thou art quite di<U+017F>arm'd. My confidence is, that I can receive no more
hurt then your <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin.</hi> But alas! have we gone through our exploits?
do I not <U+017F>ee a terrible Dragon appear?</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thereupon look'd towards a corner of the Cellar, which he had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd
before; he there perceives a great Bug-bear, that had the head of a Wolf, and
a body like that of a Crocodile, It was a good while ere he dur<U+017F>t come near it;
but <U+017F>eeing that the Mon<U+017F>ter <U+017F>tirr'd not, he pre<U+017F>um'd to give it a blow, with his
<U+017F>word. <hi>Carmelin</hi> ca<U+017F>t at it a piece of his armor that he found, <U+017F>o that the Engine
began to <U+017F>hake, it being fa<U+017F>tned on one foot, and con<U+017F>equently ea<U+017F>ily moved. The
motion of it put our two Warriors into <U+017F>uch a fear, that they thought it liv'd; and
yet <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was <U+017F>o couragious that he laid on <U+017F>till, till <U+017F>uch time as he had brought it
to the ground, and made it immoveable. His charges were <U+017F>o home, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Mon<U+017F>ter, which was but of rotten Canvas, bur<U+017F>t in divers places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
came out mo<U+017F>s, hay, foul paper and rags, which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was <U+017F>o amaz'd at; that he
cry'd out, See here, <hi>Carmelin,</hi> what lewd entrals come out of the body of this
hideous bea<U+017F>t: methinks we are poi<U+017F>oned with them. On my <U+017F>oul, they are nothing
but rags, <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin;</hi> do you not <U+017F>ee them? Thou art in the right, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi>
but that is it makes me wonder the more, when I con<U+017F>ider that Spirits have
<U+017F>ometimes animated this Engine <U+017F>tuffed with filth, for to deceive men. It may al<U+017F>o
well be, that this was a true Dragon, but that all the<U+017F>e tatters come out of its body,
as we <U+017F>ee bewitched people vomit coals, pieces of gla<U+017F>s, inkhorns, and <U+017F>uch trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
Hone<U+017F>t <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ures us it is <U+017F>o, in his hi<U+017F>tory, which the gentle <hi>D' Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier</hi>
hath compo<U+017F>ed. There came <U+017F>uch things out of his body, when he was dres'd
by charms of <U+017F>ome wounds he had receiv'd in a Combat.</p>
            <p>While the two Champions were viewing the hideous body of the Mon<U+017F>ter, a <U+017F>ad
voyce comes to their ears, <U+017F>hall I never be delivered out of the captivity wherein
I am? <U+017F>aies it; when will the mo<U+017F>t illu<U+017F>trious valour in the world be employ'd for
my relief? <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> pre<U+017F>ently conceiv'd it was <hi>Pamphilia</hi> <U+017F>poke; and pittying her
mi<U+017F>ery, he with his foot made at a little door, which <U+017F>eemed to be that of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on.
It opened pre<U+017F>ently, and in a little Cellar, he found a de<U+017F>olate Maid, whom
he took for <hi>Meliantes</hi>'s Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. 'Twas a youth di<U+017F>guis'd for that purpo<U+017F>e, who
could act his part very well. He ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s feet a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw him;
and embracing his knees, call'd him her deliverer. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> made the fair Lady ri<U+017F>e,
and taking her by the hand, bid <hi>Carmelin</hi> take a candle to light them out of the
darkne<U+017F>s of the Pri<U+017F>on. <hi>Pamphilia</hi> made as if <U+017F>he trembled as <U+017F>he went; <U+017F>o that
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> for her greater confidence, told her, that he had kill'd all her Jaylors, and
that <U+017F>he need not fear to fall into their hands any more. As they went through
low rooms, and <U+017F>tumbled again<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome hou<U+017F>hold-<U+017F>tuff that lay in their way. <hi>Hircan</hi>
di<U+017F>guis'd as before, appear'd again, and with the <U+017F>ame voyce <U+017F>aid to them, Follow
me incomparable Heroes, I will bring you hence <U+017F>afely. Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he led
them to the Coach, whereinto al<U+017F>o enter'd the fair <hi>Pamphilia:</hi> he afterwards made
fa<U+017F>t the boots with chains; and being return'd to his companions, they all put on
their ordinary cloathes, got on hor<U+017F>eback, and returned with him to his Ca<U+017F>tle,
where they pre<U+017F>ently went to bed to re<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves a little. In the mean time <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
Coachman having kept the Adventurers three or four hours in the Coach,
put the hor<U+017F>es into it, and brought them to his Ma<U+017F>ters; according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
he had receiv'd. When the coach mov'd not from the place, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thought
<U+017F>till it went through the ayr; and when it began to make a noi<U+017F>e, he then thought
it was on firm ground, and that it would not be long ere they came to <hi>Hircans</hi>
hou<U+017F>e. As indeed a little while after, the boot being unchain'd and opened, he found
him<U+017F>elf in a Court he was well enough acquainted with. <hi>Carmelin</hi> being come out
of the coach with him, they helped out <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and led her to <hi>Hircans</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who was a bed with <hi>Meliantes.</hi> Welcome be the generous Heroes, who have
delivered <hi>Pamphilia</hi> out of pri<U+017F>on, cry'd out the Magician: Ri<U+017F>e <hi>Meliantes</hi> to give
them thanks. Upon that <hi>Meliantes</hi> put on a night gown, and went and embrac'd
them with a many complements. He afterwards turn'd to <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
with a many care<U+017F><U+017F>es, and much Court<U+017F>hip. She was no longer cruel to
him, <U+017F>ince his pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervices, and the care he had had of her deliverance out of capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
had <U+017F>oftned her heart towards him. <hi>Hircan</hi> in the mean time having put on his
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43725:148"/>
cloathes, caus'd to be brought him two crowns of Lawrel, whereof he put one on
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is's</hi> head, having taken away the head-piece, and the other on <hi>Carmelins.</hi> Think
you I will be content with this hat? <U+017F>ays <hi>Carmelin,</hi> it will keep off neither the cold
nor the rain, let me have my own, which I left off to take a rotten head-piece. Its
a long time <U+017F>ince I have been bare-headed. Thy head is well enough covered for a
Conqueror, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan:</hi> ask thy Ma<U+017F>ter, if the pictures of all Heroes, are not as
thine is now. Let my picture be drawn all naked, if you plea<U+017F>e, but for my own
true body, I <U+017F>hould have it cloath'd Cap-a-pea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing that <hi>Carmelin</hi> would not hear of accommodating him<U+017F>elf in an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
manner as he was, permitted he might have his hat: which when he had, he
put the Lawrel-crown about it like a hat-band, which look'd very prettily. <hi>Philiris,
Polidor, Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> upon this came into the room, and made great
acclamations of joy for the happy return of the valorous Shepherds. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was
entreated to relate the divers fortunes he had run through; who <U+017F>eeing they were
all dre<U+017F>t, and expected the <U+017F>tory, began in this manner.</p>

                        <p>YOu are then to know, courteous Pre<U+017F>ence, that our coach being parted
hence, we were nothing a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd while it went on firm ground; but when
it went through the air, 'twas then that I had a hard task to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin;</hi>
for we heard the winds blowing, the thunder whirling, and the <U+017F>ea to<U+017F><U+017F>ing
up her waves, even to the clouds. But at la<U+017F>t we were as quiet, as if we would have
repos'd our <U+017F>elves a little; when there comes a <U+017F>age old man, who opening the
boot, led us into a mountain to recreate our <U+017F>elves, where we <U+017F>taid <U+017F>ometime. I
am not certain whether we were in an I<U+017F>land, or whether this Magician was <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
friend, whom he had <U+017F>poken to us of: But <U+017F>o it is, that he brought us into a
Grot, which <U+017F>hin'd all over, by the Diamonds and Carbuncles wherewith the
walls were all cover'd over; and having laid a white cloath on a black marble
table, there were <U+017F>erved up ten or twelve di<U+017F>hes of meat, whereon we fed till we
were <U+017F>atisfied; and we drank of <U+017F>uch a delicate wine, that I think Nectar is not
more. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>hed at it, that he confe<U+017F>t he never had been <U+017F>o en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained.
I pray bate <U+017F>o much of your Bill, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> all you <U+017F>ay is fal<U+017F>e,
under correction of the company: Do not <U+017F>ay that I made <U+017F>uch a good meal
with you, I have not eaten a bit <U+017F>ince I went hence. How <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t thou live then?
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> very angrily: its at lea<U+017F>t fifteen days <U+017F>ince we went hence; ha<U+017F>t thou
lived all this while without eating? Well, impudence, were it not out of re<U+017F>pect
to tho<U+017F>e who are pre<U+017F>ent, I would cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e thee as thou de<U+017F>erve<U+017F>t; but I mu<U+017F>t
not interrupt my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e for <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a matter as thee.</p>
                        <p>This Company then is to know, that the old man having made us both eat,
without di<U+017F>arming us, carried us into a garden, where the Gods <U+017F>eem'd to have
married together the Spring and Autumn; for there <U+017F>hin'd a clear Sun without
heat, and yet the fruits on the trees were ripe, and in the Level all <U+017F>orts of flowers.
As for Summer and Winter, I think they were eternally bani<U+017F>hed thence, and that
the one was gone to burn up <hi>Mauritania,</hi> the other to freeze up <hi>Scythia.</hi> The
place was inhabited by great yellow and green <hi>Birds,</hi> which had the charge to
cultivate it: Some with their bills prun'd off their <U+017F>uperfluous branches, and
others lopp'd off and levell'd the hedg-rows; there were <U+017F>ome that brought
water in little <U+017F>hells to water the Plants, and others made Po<U+017F>ies. But that which
was mo<U+017F>t to be admired, was, that they <U+017F>poke like men, and told one another
what ought to be done with much ratiocination. I learned of them <U+017F>ome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titutions
of their Republique, and they brought me to <U+017F>ee their Shees and their
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43725:148"/>
young ones: I al<U+017F>o <U+017F>aw all their provi<U+017F>ions, and heard them <U+017F>ing certain aires
which they u<U+017F>ed to make them<U+017F>elves merry with on their dayes of recreation. So
that I <U+017F>wore to them, that I wi<U+017F>h'd with all my heart I had been metamorpho<U+017F>ed
into a Bird, that I might have led <U+017F>uch a plea<U+017F>ant life as theirs. They an<U+017F>wered,
it was not <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant as I thought it; for though they were in a very delightfull
place, yet had they not much joy in it, when they con<U+017F>idered it was the place of
their captivity, and that they were only Tenants, and not the owners of it, and
that it belong'd to certain men, whom I might <U+017F>ee if I would go a little
further.</p>
                        <p>I went <U+017F>o far, that I came to their walls, which were <U+017F>o high that they were
not able to flie over them; and my Conductor having opened a little door, I
pa<U+017F>s'd through with him and <hi>Carmelin.</hi> We <U+017F>aw a field that was very dry and
very <U+017F>andy, wherein were men <U+017F>tark naked, who had on their bodies neither fle<U+017F>h
nor fat, and were only cover'd with a skin tran<U+017F>parent as oyl'd paper: A man
could <U+017F>ee through it their bones, their veins, their <U+017F>inews, their mu<U+017F>cles, and their
intrals; <U+017F>o that for to learn Anatomy, he needed but look on them. Their
Hearts were mo<U+017F>t cleery <U+017F>een, as al<U+017F>o what was imprinted in them: As for
example, in one you might <U+017F>ee the countenance of <U+017F>ome fair Lady, who was his
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; and in another, a great heap of <U+017F>ilver which he ador'd as his God.
There was al<U+017F>o to be <U+017F>een an Hieroglyphical figure of the words they were to
<U+017F>peak, from the <U+017F>tomach to the throat; and by rea<U+017F>on they had no hair, 'twas
ea<U+017F>ily perceiv'd what <U+017F>trange imaginations they had in their brains, which they
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed there under <U+017F>everal repre<U+017F>entations of divers colours. Though my guide
laught at them, yet I thought their conver<U+017F>ation very plea<U+017F>ant, and was <U+017F>orry
to leave them. They came very confidently near me; but they kept off from
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he was armed, and that they feared le<U+017F>t he might come and
embrace them, or <U+017F>o much as touch them as he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould grate off
their delicate skin. I <U+017F>hould have been very glad to have lived among men that
could not conceal what they thought, though they <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire it; but the old
man told me that <U+017F>hould I but <U+017F>ee their wives, which <U+017F>ex I loved better then the
ma<U+017F>culine, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>oon hate that people, for they were not of the humor to
be willing that men <U+017F>hould be acquainted with their affairs; and having their
bodies Diaphanous as their husbands, they put gown upon gown for to hide it,
that their fanta<U+017F>tical imaginations might not be <U+017F>een. To <U+017F>atisfie my curio<U+017F>ity, he
brought me to a Furnace under ground, where tho<U+017F>e people put their children
to make them tran<U+017F>parent as them<U+017F>elves, for they were not <U+017F>o from the mothers
womb. I put my finger into the fire, to <U+017F>ee if it were hot; and <hi>Carmelin</hi> would
do the like: but it burn'd <U+017F>o, that we were fain to pull them out immediately.
If you will know the truth, look on mine and <hi>Carmelin's</hi> right hand.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <U+017F>ome others look'd on their hands, whereon they found
certain redne<U+017F><U+017F>es which were there by chance; <U+017F>o that every one <U+017F>aid that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
was to be believed in what<U+017F>oever he <U+017F>aid. Yet <hi>Carmelin</hi> did nothing but grumble,
as if he had a mind to contradict all his Ma<U+017F>ter <U+017F>aid.</p>
                        <p>Walking on <U+017F>till with the old man, continued <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I came to a River; which
though it was very cleer, yet was it not more tran<U+017F>parent then the bodies I had
<U+017F>een. My Guide having invited me to cro<U+017F>s it, I ask'd whether there were either
any boat or bridg. Come over this bridg, <U+017F>aid he to me <U+017F>miling; and I pre<U+017F>ently
<U+017F>aw him going through the air upon the water: I told him I could not do the
like, but he came and took me by the hand, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> al<U+017F>o; and making us
go the <U+017F>ame way as he did him<U+017F>elf, we were amaz'd to find re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance under our
feet, as if we had gone on firm ground, whereas we thought we had pa<U+017F>s'd through
the aire. My eyes at length being more clear'd up, I perceiv'd we were on a chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tal
bridge, which was <U+017F>o clear, that a man could not di<U+017F>cern it from the water.
<hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>till ignorant of what it was, came forwards extream fearfully.</p>
                        <p>At the end of this bridge, there <U+017F>tood a Tower, the walls whereof were of gla<U+017F>s,
<U+017F>olid enough, and tran<U+017F>parent enough; but as to the walks on them, they, as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43725:149"/>
as wel as the bridge were of cry<U+017F>tal <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>parent, that being out of curio<U+017F>ity got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
up on them, I dur<U+017F>t not walk thereon, imagining there were none at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
being on high, I could <U+017F>ee the ground below toward the foundation. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood,
that that was one of the marches of the Country of the Diaphanous
people; and having walk'd yet another half hour with the old man, I came to
a very barren Champion. We have walkt a long time, <U+017F>aid he to me, I mu<U+017F>t now
have you to a collation in a magnificient palace, which I have here: I thought
he had jeered me; for I <U+017F>aw no building, and yet I took it patiently from him.
But he <U+017F>eeing I an<U+017F>wered not, I think, <U+017F>aid he, you doubt of my power; you
<U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee the effects of it. Turning my <U+017F>elf pre<U+017F>ently about towards the ea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>outh,
we<U+017F>t and north, I <U+017F>aw that from each quarter there came a great <U+017F>ide of wall:
The<U+017F>e four flying pieces of building meeting together, made up but one edifice,
which was a fair <U+017F>pacious Hall, in the mid<U+017F>t whereof we found our <U+017F>elves: imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after, there fell down upon that a roof, like that of a Banqueting hou<U+017F>e,
on the top whereof there was a gla<U+017F><U+017F>en Turret to let in the light. While I lift up
my head to look on it, I perceived not the <U+017F>tarting up of a round table, and three
chairs at my feet: <hi>Carmelin</hi> took notice of it, as having his under<U+017F>tanding fix'd
on tho<U+017F>e things which concern the reparation of his <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. He pre<U+017F>ently told
me of it: Here's a fair table, <U+017F>aid he, but it were better it did not appear <U+017F>o
fair. 'Twere a greater credit to the Ma<U+017F>ter of it, if it were well cover'd. Let's
<U+017F>it about it however, <U+017F>aies the old man, my <U+017F>ervants will bring us <U+017F>omewhat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently.
I thought this Magician did <U+017F>till nothing but abu<U+017F>e us, and looking about
the hall, I could perceive no body; the walls only were hung with the riche<U+017F>t <U+017F>ort
of Tapi<U+017F>try, behinde which I knew not but his <U+017F>ervants might be hidden. Hola!
my Lads there! crys out the Magician, you make us <U+017F>tay long: Is there no meat
in the hou<U+017F>e? I was then looking on the <U+017F>tory that was repre<U+017F>ented in the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which was the marriage of <U+017F>ome Roman Emperor, and methought I <U+017F>aw all
the per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>tirring, and a many <U+017F>laves who were <U+017F>erving up di<U+017F>hes on their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters
table, came out of the hangings, and walk'd up and down the hall, as if they
had been alive, and came and brought us what they had in their hands. To
make it appear it was no fained thing, that piece of the Tapi<U+017F>try whence they
came out was empty, and there remained only the Canvas; <U+017F>o that they were
men of <U+017F>ilk and wool that <U+017F>erved us. I never had <U+017F>een <U+017F>uch attendants; and when
the old man pray'd me to eat what was on the table: I told him I knew not how
to eat hangings. Its very excellent hangings, replyed plea<U+017F>antly <hi>Carmelin;</hi> I
have ta<U+017F>ted the corner of a cake, which was <U+017F>o delicious, that I wi<U+017F>h to God
all the re<U+017F>t may be like it, there would be <U+017F>triving who <U+017F>hould have mo<U+017F>t. He
per<U+017F>waded me <U+017F>o far, that I eat of a Tart made of herbs, and certain <U+017F>weet-meats,
which I found very excellent. Thir<U+017F>t forc'd me al<U+017F>o to ask for drink of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<U+017F>laves. They brought me a wine <U+017F>o delicious, that it made me forget the
ta<U+017F>te of that I had drunk with the old man in the Grot. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he
drank above ten times, and becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>laves took the flagons of wine out of a
buffet in the Tapi<U+017F>try: Ha! would he <U+017F>ay every foot; now it may be ea<U+017F>ily
<U+017F>een that this is Tapi<U+017F>try-wine. It <U+017F>lides down the throat by threads <U+017F>maller then
tho<U+017F>e of gold and <U+017F>ilk.</p>
                        <p>This good companion was <U+017F>o frolick, that he would <U+017F>ay to me, Ma<U+017F>ter, let us
even leave <hi>Meliantes</hi> and his fair enchanted Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: Let's here accompli<U+017F>h our
adventure; if you value my advice any thing you will <U+017F>tay here, <U+017F>ervants will co<U+017F>t
us nothing to maintain, and the meat will <U+017F>tand us in nothing, all will come out
of the Tapi<U+017F>try. Do<U+017F>t thou think this good fortune can la<U+017F>t long? replyed I: we
have already eat up all the provi<U+017F>ions that was brought hither, and I know not
whether tho<U+017F>e grave Roman Senators, whom I <U+017F>ee at table in the tapi<U+017F>try, will
not be angry with us. We have diverted their <U+017F>laves from <U+017F>erving them, and we
have made good chear of what was provided for them. Its a long time they have
waited there, and the <U+017F>econd cour<U+017F>e is not yet come; I believe they grow <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
out of patience, and will not vouch<U+017F>afe to ta<U+017F>te of what's before them. They
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43725:149"/>
<U+017F>hall not want what is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for them, <U+017F>aies the Magician to me; and they
will never be <U+017F>o uncivil as to be angry at us. That they are now <U+017F>o quiet and <U+017F>ilent,
'tis becau<U+017F>e they are con<U+017F>ulting about <U+017F>ome great warlike expedition, which they
are to undertake, Be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>hould you <U+017F>tay here a hundred years, you <U+017F>hould
not want any thing; but <hi>I</hi> am <U+017F>orry <hi>I</hi> can no longer enjoy <U+017F>uch gue<U+017F>ts. As he
<U+017F>aid this, the <U+017F>laves took away our di<U+017F>hes, gla<U+017F><U+017F>es and bottles, and with all, that
equipage went again into the Tapi<U+017F>try, which <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange to me, that I yet
feele an amazement of it in my <U+017F>elf. The roof of the hall rais'd it <U+017F>elf up, and
fled into heaven, and our table <U+017F>unk into the ground, and then our four walls
return'd to the four quarters of the world. Our coach we found in the Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and being gotten into it with <hi>Carmelin, I</hi> thank'd the old man for all his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities.
He made all fa<U+017F>t as it was before; and <hi>I</hi> believe the hor<U+017F>es pre<U+017F>ently took
their flight: but we <U+017F>et our <U+017F>elves to <U+017F>leep till <U+017F>uch time as another old man came
and advertis'd us that we were in <hi>Pamphilia's</hi> pri<U+017F>on. We were by him led through
places <U+017F>o hideous and full of darkne<U+017F>s, that <hi>Hercules</hi> him<U+017F>elf would there have
lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>omewhat of his confidence.</p>

            </q>
            <p>This is indeed the place where you begin to tell the truth (<U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who
could hold his tongue no longer) 'Tis true, that a grave old man brought us out
of the coach, to carry us into the pri<U+017F>on; but before this we had not <U+017F>een any at
all, nor know I any thing of all the adventures wherein you engage me. You dreamt
them likely when you <U+017F>lept in the coach; and as mens dreams have no relation, though
they re<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>ame place, <U+017F>o my minde hath not been entertain'd with any <U+017F>uch
imaginations. I pray excu<U+017F>e me, if I <U+017F>peak freely; but of all you have related,
nothing troubles me more then what you <U+017F>ay of my fea<U+017F>ting with <U+017F>o much gluttony,
I am at this pre<U+017F>ent hungrier then a Hunt<U+017F>man; and I prote<U+017F>t to you once more,
as I did before, that nothing enter'd my body, nor nothing hath gone through it
<U+017F>ince we went from this place. And to take away all controver<U+017F>ie, I profer to ea<U+017F>e
my <U+017F>elf in any place, and tho<U+017F>e that are skill'd in <U+017F>uch matters, <U+017F>hall judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I have return'd what I ate when I la<U+017F>t <U+017F>upp'd here, or <U+017F>ome more exqui<U+017F>ite
<U+017F>tuff. After the eating of <U+017F>o much enchanted Tapi<U+017F>try, I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>end down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
fine skains of <U+017F>ilk and yarn, or rather fair twi<U+017F>ts of gold: I would it were
<U+017F>o, 'twould be a great credit to me, 'twould be <U+017F>aid I disburthen'd my <U+017F>elf of gold,
and not any filthy excrement.</p>
            <p>Peace <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan,</hi> thy di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e and wit is ob<U+017F>cene; thou think<U+017F>t thou
art now with thy <U+017F>ick Hypocondriake Ma<U+017F>ter, who knew the weight and mea<U+017F>ure of
all thy <U+017F>tools. Whatever thou can<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> is rather to be believed then thou;
and the company entreats thee not to interrupt his relation any farther. <hi>Carmelin</hi>
being ty'd up to <U+017F>ilence, which the re<U+017F>t keeping al<U+017F>o, his Ma<U+017F>ter continued his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
in this manner:</p>
            <q>
               <p>The old man having left us, we were in a Cellar, where there was light, but
only <U+017F>o much as to let us <U+017F>ee the mo<U+017F>t horrible things in the world, and <U+017F>o to
terrifie us. There pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves unto us two Gyants, who were <U+017F>o big,
that I know not how they did not thru<U+017F>t up the roof, when they lifted up their
heads. Sometimes, which was the thing mo<U+017F>t to be admir'd, they became as
little as we, to recollect their forces as may be conceived; and though they had
no arms, yet did they annoy us much, by running again<U+017F>t us. However, I made
a <U+017F>hift to rout them; and afterwards I had no more work but to fight with two
knappy fellows, that fell on us with <U+017F>words in their hands. At every blow they
had at my head-piece, I think it made more <U+017F>parkles then an iron red hot, which
the Smith beats on the Anvile: For my part, I could not get my <U+017F>word out of
the Scabbard, yet did it not hinder but I gave them terrible blows. Why had
I not a Club, with <U+017F>o many iron <U+017F>pikes in it, as that of <hi>Hercules?</hi> Or why had
I not a half Pike, as <hi>I</hi> de<U+017F>ired of <hi>Hircan</hi> at my departure? He <U+017F>wore to me I
<U+017F>hould have no need of it; but yet if I had had one, it would have done me
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43725:150"/>
<U+017F>ervice; my enemies <U+017F>hould not have <U+017F>tood it out <U+017F>o long. I remember that in
your prophe<U+017F>ie <hi>Hircan,</hi> you <U+017F>aid, that, <hi>The Dove <U+017F>hould be covered with Eagles
feathers, and that it <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>troy the Faulcons;</hi> I believe that I am that <hi>Dove</hi>
without gall, who am become an <hi>Eagle;</hi> and que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F>s the <hi>Faulcons</hi> which <hi>I</hi>
have de<U+017F>troyed are my enemies. You al<U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, that the <hi>Clowns jump <U+017F>hould be
chang'd into a Cor<U+017F>let.</hi> This is fulfill'd in <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and in me al<U+017F>o, for this <hi>Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat</hi>
is as good as a <hi>Cor<U+017F>let.</hi> It follow'd, <hi>that the <U+017F>tring that hangs the Scrip, <U+017F>hould
be chang'd into a <U+017F>words belt;</hi> that al<U+017F>o is come to pa<U+017F>s in me: but when I find <hi>that
the Sheephook <U+017F>hould be changed into a half Pike,</hi> and that there is nothing accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>hed
as to that point, methinks there is <U+017F>omewhat wanting in the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            </q>
            <p>You mu<U+017F>t not be <U+017F>o <U+017F>crupulous, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan,</hi> Prophe<U+017F>ies are not always taken
litterally. I <U+017F>aid all that by a figure, it <U+017F>uffices that of a Shepherd, you are become
a man of arms, and that according to my promi<U+017F>e you have delivered <hi>Pamphilia</hi>
out of Pri<U+017F>on.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I will then go on with my relation, as being extreamly <U+017F>atisfied, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi>
Though I defended my <U+017F>elf the be<U+017F>t I could again<U+017F>t the hulch-back'd Souldiers, yet
was I <U+017F>o unfortunate, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> too, that we both fell down, having <U+017F>tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
again<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tones that were under our feet. The hulch-back'd Knaps
pre<U+017F>ently came upon us, and knowing we were invulnerable, they imagin'd there
was no other way to make us dye, but to choak us. They would drive the <U+017F>ouls
out of our bodies by <U+017F>ome new <U+017F>ecret; for they pulled us by the no<U+017F>es as hard
as ever they could, that it might drop out with wiping them, <U+017F>ince it could not
go out at any wound. At la<U+017F>t we gave them each of us <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>hock, that they
were forc'd to leave us. This done, we perceived a Dragon, which though it
was a terrible <U+017F>ight, yet I made towards it, and notwith<U+017F>tanding its hard <U+017F>caline<U+017F>s,
I gave him a great wound on the back, whereof he dyed. That done, I went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Dungeon, where <hi>Pamphilia</hi> was, whom I brought out of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
places; and by doubtful ways led her to the coach, with the help of the
Magician, whom I met again.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Meliantes</hi> is to know, that I bring him his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s as cha<U+017F>te as I found
her, &amp; though <U+017F>he hath been lockt up with two men, <U+017F>he hath been no more toucht
then if <U+017F>he had been among <U+017F>tatues: For my part, I did not <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>peak to
her, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect I would corrupt her; and the remembrance of <hi>Charite</hi>
fortified me again<U+017F>t any loo<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ires that <U+017F>hould a<U+017F><U+017F>ault me. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
becau<U+017F>e he was an incon<U+017F>tant per<U+017F>on, I prevented him as much I could po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
from meddling any thing; and I think carried all things <U+017F>o well, that <U+017F>he hath
no cau<U+017F>e to complain. She will tell you how I di<U+017F>pos'd her behinde, and <hi>Carmelin</hi>
before, and my <U+017F>elf in the boot, to be between them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having thus ended his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, there was none but confe<U+017F>t in him<U+017F>elf, that the
relation was excellent; and that though there were <U+017F>ome that knew mo<U+017F>t accidents
in the adventure, yet was his de<U+017F>cription of it <U+017F>o natural, that he grac'd the bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
more then was imagin'd. As for his dream of enchantments, every one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
its variety. <hi>Meliantes</hi> renewed his thanks, but they were interrupted by
<hi>Carmelin;</hi> who comes and <U+017F>aies, And <U+017F>hall I have no thanks? or is it conceiv'd I
have <U+017F>uffered nothing? Can I <U+017F>uffer that my Ma<U+017F>ter <U+017F>hould darken my reputation,
by laying incontinence to my charge? The ill opinion he hath of thee, <U+017F>aies <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
is but an illu<U+017F>ion. That is not all neither, continues <hi>Carmelin,</hi> I would not
that in the relation of his victory over the Mon<U+017F>ters, he make you believe he hath
done all him<U+017F>elf: Should he <U+017F>peak on his honour and his oath, and if he were to lift
up his hand, he will not deny, but I have helped him much. I acknowledge thou
art the true companion of my travels, <U+017F>aith <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> if I am <hi>Hercules,</hi> thou art my
<hi>Euri<U+017F>teus;</hi> if <hi>I</hi> am <hi>The<U+017F>eus,</hi> thou art my <hi>Perithous.</hi> Excu<U+017F>e me, if I have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thy a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, it being in <U+017F>o extraordinary a manner; which was, thou ha<U+017F>t
<U+017F>hewn thy <U+017F>elf as valiant in ca<U+017F>ting away thy arms, as others are in keeping
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43725:150"/>
them. If I <U+017F>hall one day have draughts or <U+017F>tatues to repre<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>tory, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
thy <U+017F>elf thou <U+017F>halt not be forgotten there, but <U+017F>halt be put in a very good po<U+017F>ture.
Yet now I think on't, when our enemies were vanqui<U+017F>hed, there would have been
no danger to have taken up thy arms again, and brought them hither; for if <U+017F>ome
cunning knave finde them, he will give it abroad, that it was thou wert defeated. It
al<U+017F>o repents me we have not brought with us whatever we might have found of
booty from the Mon<U+017F>ters we fought with, which might have been vi<U+017F>ible te<U+017F>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of our valour to all the world. We <U+017F>hould have carried away the drummer
of the Crump-back'd Souldiers, and the entrails of the enchanted Dragon, of which
might have been rais'd a Trophy upon the top of a pike, before this Ca<U+017F>tle. Our
hor<U+017F>es would not have fled <U+017F>o chearfully, had they had <U+017F>uch a weight to draw, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Carmelin:</hi> Lets then content our <U+017F>elves with what is done, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but if
ever <hi>Meliantes</hi> pa<U+017F>s by the enchanted I<U+017F>land, <hi>I</hi> would de<U+017F>ire him to rai<U+017F>e a <hi>Pyramid</hi>
to our <U+017F>empiternal glory.</p>
            <p>After <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, <hi>Hircan</hi> invited the company into the Hall to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
They all came except <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> who vani<U+017F>hed away, becau<U+017F>e the Lad that
acted that part was in ha<U+017F>te to put on his former cloathes. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> asked <hi>Meliantes</hi>
what he had done with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. He an<U+017F>wered, that he lock'd her up into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
whither was brought her what <U+017F>he wanted, until <U+017F>uch time as they <U+017F>hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into their Country, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was much given to a <U+017F>olitary life.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon <hi>Orontes, An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> came to <hi>Hircans: Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had
<U+017F>till on his Heroick habit, which <U+017F>eem'd to them the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant thing in the
world; but it was better <U+017F>port to them to hear him and <hi>Carmelin</hi> briefly relate
their <U+017F>everal adventures. But <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es ended, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> remembred him to ask
whether the Pari<U+017F>ian Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors were not yet return'd? and if that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Shepherds of whom they had brought intelligence were not yet come. The
Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors are departed, replies <hi>Orontes;</hi> but we have heard nothing of them
<U+017F>ince; and <hi>I</hi> know not what hindrance hath met with <U+017F>o many honorable Shepherds
as were to come hither. <hi>I</hi> wonder they are not here, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I have been hence
at lea<U+017F>t fifteen days upon my adventure to the enchanted Ca<U+017F>tle; for the hours pa<U+017F>t
away as fa<U+017F>t as minutes in <hi>Hircans</hi> coach. Have they haply had notice of my ab<U+017F>ence?
O God! how dangerous is it to be di<U+017F>tant from a people a man is to govern: cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and change <U+017F>eizeth all things, now <hi>I</hi> perceive it well; for even <hi>Orontes</hi> is
grown loo<U+017F>e, and hath quitted the Shepherds habit, to put on that of a Gentleman.
You have done as much your <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>aies <hi>Orontes;</hi> are not you in a habit di<U+017F>conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to your quality? There was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould take it, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and <hi>I</hi>
promi<U+017F>e thee, though many think it becomes me well, to quit it to morrow, and
to put on the Pa<U+017F>toral; for it <U+017F>uffices that I am <U+017F>een one day in this Countrey clad
like a <hi>Heros,</hi> to <U+017F>hew that <hi>I</hi> am <U+017F>uch a one, and will be <U+017F>o as long as <hi>I</hi> plea<U+017F>e, and
that <hi>I</hi> do not turn Shepherd, but to enjoy my minde in greater <U+017F>erenity. You will
al<U+017F>o give me leave, <U+017F>aies <hi>Orontes</hi> to keep on the cloathes <hi>I</hi> am in for this day, and
for <U+017F>ome days to come; for <hi>I</hi> intend to go a hunting, and <hi>I</hi> conceive my <U+017F>elf well
enough clad like a Hunt<U+017F>man. Your rea<U+017F>on's not ami<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> be<U+017F>ides, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is an exerci<U+017F>e which is not forbidden Shepherds; and for what concerns the <hi>Heroes</hi>
all books acquaint us they are generally given to it: The habit <hi>I</hi> have on <U+017F>uits me
well enough to go a hunting with you; all that are pre<U+017F>ent, if they plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>hall

Meliantes</hi> and <hi>Polidor,</hi> who were in Shepherds habit, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would by no means
permit them to ride, if they had not riding Coats to hide their Pa<U+017F>toral habit, which
in his opinion <U+017F>uited not well with a Cavaliers. As for his own part, <U+017F>ince he was
clad like a Commander in chief of Antiquity, he made no <U+017F>cruple to get on hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
as he had <U+017F>ometimes before. He would have no other arms then a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pole, which was to <U+017F>erve him in<U+017F>tead of a dart; and he would openly wi<U+017F>h it
were the dart of <hi>Cephalus,</hi> that never mi<U+017F>s'd the prey. He was of opinion, that if
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43725:151"/>
he had <U+017F>uch a one, he would more judiciou<U+017F>ly u<U+017F>e it then that mi<U+017F>erable Hunt<U+017F>man
did, and that he would not kill his own dear half with it, becau<U+017F>e he would not
have been <U+017F>o ra<U+017F>h as to ca<U+017F>t it, before he had fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>een the bea<U+017F>t he would di<U+017F>patch.
He was a long time con<U+017F>idering whether he <U+017F>hould keep on his buskins, or put on
his boots and <U+017F>purs. At length he concluded him<U+017F>elf well enough accommodated;
and remembring he had <U+017F>een a many ancient Knights painted without <U+017F>tirrupts, he
would have his taken off. 'Twas a great con<U+017F>ultation whether he <U+017F>hould have a hat
or no, or whether he <U+017F>hould only keep on his crown of Laurel. That was enough
to make him alight, and return to <hi>Hircans</hi> chamber, where there was a book of
Pictures, among which he <U+017F>aw divers Captains without hat or cap, or bonnet, and
only crown'd with Laurel. He came back again fully re<U+017F>olv'd not to change his
dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, though <hi>Philiris</hi> <U+017F>poke to him to this purpo<U+017F>e: 'Tis true, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ays he,
that in Tapi<U+017F>try and Pictures you may <U+017F>ee a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor in the mid<U+017F>t of his Army
without helmet or headpiece, having on his head a <U+017F>imple Crown of Laurel; but
that is not that they are truly <U+017F>o. What advantage were it to them, they would
not be as well arm'd as the common <U+017F>ouldiers, and at the fir<U+017F>t blow they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
dangerous wounds in the head? But the rea<U+017F>on of all is, that the Painters do
oftentimes go from the hi<U+017F>tory, and take the liberty of their Art, and paint a man
bare-headed and crown'd with Laurel, that he as being Emperor may be known
from the re<U+017F>t, though it is not to be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed he always wears <U+017F>uch a Crown.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e hindred not <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to remain in the <U+017F>ame po<U+017F>ture he was in; <U+017F>o that
the hunters without any further conte<U+017F>tation <U+017F>et out from <hi>Hircan's</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle, leaving
<hi>Carmelin</hi> behind, who would by no means ride and take <U+017F>o much pains for a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bea<U+017F>t. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ask'd for the Kennel of Hounds, the Nets and Snares, and whether
the preparation were not as great as that of King <hi>Diceus</hi> in <hi>Francias.</hi> They <U+017F>hew'd
him <U+017F>ome Greyhounds, and told him their de<U+017F>ign was only to cour<U+017F>e a Hare. What
have you put me to the pains to get on hor<U+017F>-back for <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a matter? <U+017F>aid he;
think you that I'll trouble my<U+017F>elf to pur<U+017F>ue a fearful creature? That employment
mu<U+017F>t be for the delicate <hi>Venus,</hi> who dares not deal with any dangerous bea<U+017F>t. I
remember the admonitions <U+017F>he gave <hi>Adonis,</hi> and I know what misfortune happen'd
to him for not believing her: yet for all this will I not <U+017F>tick to hunt after the mo<U+017F>t
furious creatures. Am not I who have defeated Gyants, Mon<U+017F>ters, and Dragons, a
<U+017F>touter man then that little Wanton? Hunt your Hares as long as you will; for
my part, I'll go to the <U+017F>ide of a mountain, and <U+017F>tay till a roaring Lyon come out, as
the young <hi>A<U+017F>canius</hi> does in <hi>Virgil.</hi> You con<U+017F>ider not that you are not now in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frique,</hi>
<U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> there are no Lyons here: But <hi>Virgil</hi> in another place does
as much as you do, for he makes <hi>Aenaeas</hi> hunt Stags as if he had been in <hi>Europe.</hi>
I do not think they are <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily found in that Country, e<U+017F>pecially in <U+017F>uch numbers
as he mentions. But alas, hone<U+017F>t <hi>Virgil</hi> was in <hi>Italy</hi> when he writ this, and thought
<hi>Aenaeas</hi> was there too. If <hi>I</hi> cannot find Lyons in this Country, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is, I</hi>
<U+017F>hall at lea<U+017F>t meet with <U+017F>ome Bore, as furious as that of <hi>Erimanthus;</hi> it <U+017F>hall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
him that I'll try my force. You <U+017F>hould then have your <hi>Atalanta</hi> here, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Clarimond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the dogs <U+017F>tarted a hare, which they pur<U+017F>ued over
the fallow of a little valley. The hunters followed; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> not knowing what
to do with him<U+017F>elf if he kept them not company, went after them, partly with his
will, partly again<U+017F>t it; becau<U+017F>e his hor<U+017F>e, which he could not guide as he plea<U+017F>ed,
would carry him to the re<U+017F>t, by a cu<U+017F>tom he had. The cour<U+017F>e was <U+017F>o violent, that the
poor Hero could not keep his crown of Laurel from falling, and could not hinder
but that the wind blowing up the napkin he had about his <U+017F>houlders in<U+017F>tead of a
<U+017F>carf, it cover'd all his head. His amazement encrea<U+017F>ed by the <U+017F>hocks he at the <U+017F>ame
time receiv'd; <U+017F>o that he let fall his hunting-pole, and embrac'd his hor<U+017F>es neck,
for fear of falling. The hunt<U+017F>men having taken their plea<U+017F>ures a while to <U+017F>ee him in
that po<U+017F>ture, bid a Lacquay <U+017F>tay his Cour<U+017F>er and <U+017F>et him aright. A while after the
Hare was caught, and <hi>Orontes</hi> had a mind to carry the company to his hou<U+017F>e which
was not far off. 'Twas an incomparable plea<U+017F>ure to <hi>Florida, Leonora,</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:43725:151"/>
to <U+017F>ee <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> as he then was: his thighs and legs were one half naked, and his arms
bare, but embroidered in <U+017F>ome places with a certain <U+017F>curf which might well pa<U+017F>s for
the itch; nor wanted there a little na<U+017F>tine<U+017F>s, that the variety might make the better
<U+017F>hew: As for his Guard-coat, it was <U+017F>uch a good one as your <hi>Paris</hi>-Brokers u<U+017F>e to
hire out to Prenti<U+017F>es when they revel it on Shrove-Tue<U+017F>day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> in few words told the Ladies what dangers the Shepherd had run through
<U+017F>ince they had <U+017F>een him; which made up the miracle. In the mean time <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s in his heroick habit, look'd for her
all over the hou<U+017F>e: Nay he went into the garden, and came to a little Grove, where
finding a very fair Elder-tree, he re<U+017F>olved to write <U+017F>omwhat on the bark of it; but
having no knife about him, he went and borrowed the Gardeners. He fir<U+017F>t of all
cut his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es name, and then his own. <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> having <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>ed
him in this employment, thought him engag'd in an excellent de<U+017F>ign; but he
told them he had more then that to do, and that he had long before compo<U+017F>ed a
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e purpo<U+017F>ely to grave upon a Tree, when he <U+017F>hould meet with the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
You mu<U+017F>t let us hear that di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Philiris,</hi> we have not the patience
to <U+017F>tay till it be written; be<U+017F>ides that it will not be ami<U+017F>s to tell it us before, it may
be our advice may do <U+017F>omwhat; for who<U+017F>oever puts any things abroad, is glad to
have the judgment of his friends in it. 'Tis rationally <U+017F>poken, reply'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> hear
then what I intend to put.</p>
            <p>Fair Tree! <hi>will</hi> I <hi><U+017F>ay;</hi> <U+017F>ince thou art ordain'd to be the ordinary paper of the Lovers
of this country, do that courte<U+017F>ie now for the faithfulle<U+017F>t Shepherd that ever carried
<U+017F>heephook: Receive into thy bark the divine characters which compo<U+017F>e the name of my
faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and permit al<U+017F>o that I therein minute my <U+017F>orrows, that thou may<U+017F>t
one day <U+017F>hew them to her who is the cau<U+017F>e thereof, when <U+017F>he comes to repo<U+017F>e her<U+017F>elf under
thy <U+017F>hade. May<U+017F>t thou every year grow a fathom, and may the letters thou beare<U+017F>t grow
with thee, <U+017F>o that our ancient Gra<U+017F>iers may di<U+017F>cern them at half a league without
<U+017F>pectacles.</p>
            <p>That's very hand<U+017F>om as you <U+017F>peak it, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> but I do not think you
can make this tree contain it all. Why not, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I have read a certain book,
called <hi>Carithea,</hi> wherein there is mentioned a Shepherd that had written on a
poplar, a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>ix times as long as mine. You are in the right replies <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond;
I</hi> have read that book as well as you. That di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e is <U+017F>o long, that though
a man <U+017F>hould write from the top to the bottom, and not exempt the branches nor
the leaves, <hi>I</hi> do not think it would contain all; for you know, that for to make the
Letters legible and di<U+017F>cernable, they mu<U+017F>t be made <U+017F>omewhat big. But what? the<U+017F>e
are the greate<U+017F>t ornaments of our Romances; and you <U+017F>hall commonly finde tho<U+017F>e
that cut entire Odes upon trees, though there would be much ado to write a Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.
A man does not <U+017F>o ordinarily meet with barks <U+017F>o large and proper, and the
mo<U+017F>t can be done is to grave <U+017F>ome Character, or little Embleme. <hi>I</hi> wonder <U+017F>o
many Authors are drawn into <U+017F>uch impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities, and that in tho<U+017F>e things whereof
they were as ea<U+017F>ily convinc'd as de<U+017F>ire it. A man would think, they had never <U+017F>een
Trees, or never <U+017F>tirr'd out of Pri<U+017F>on: but the rea<U+017F>on of it, is their own <U+017F>tupidity,
which makes them not con<U+017F>ider tho<U+017F>e things that continually pre<U+017F>ent them<U+017F>elves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes; and becau<U+017F>e they who went before them, <U+017F>aid that Lovers writ
long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es on the barks of Trees, they are ea<U+017F>ily carried away to put <U+017F>uch things
into their Hi<U+017F>tories, for want of other invention. But that which is yet more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant,
is, that this mu<U+017F>t be grav'd in a moment, as if it were as ea<U+017F>ie as to write on
paper. They in the mean time con<U+017F>ider not, that fifteen days were not enough to
form <U+017F>o many Characters, and that <U+017F>o well that every one mu<U+017F>t read them as they
feign; for they <U+017F>ay that <U+017F>ometimes by the draught, it was known who<U+017F>e the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
was. There's yet another <U+017F>trange thing they do; though all tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es
be compo<U+017F>'d as well as might be, yet will they have it believ'd that their Lovers
made them on a <U+017F>udden. They will al<U+017F>o introduce men an<U+017F>wering one another in
ver<U+017F>e, without any previous <U+017F>tudying of what they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay; and their Love-Letters,
they make them di<U+017F>patch pre<U+017F>ently. This is a very wonderful thing; for
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:43725:152"/>
'tis known that they them<U+017F>elves who <U+017F>hould be greater Clerks then tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e
loves they de<U+017F>cribe, and do e<U+017F>teem them<U+017F>elves far beyond them, would gladly turn
Hermits to be at lei<U+017F>ure to adorn one period; and that there's no Carrier <U+017F>o <U+017F>low,
but would in the mean time go twice to <hi>Rome.</hi> There's rea<U+017F>on for what you <U+017F>ay,
interrupts <hi>Philiris;</hi> though the<U+017F>e Authors make <U+017F>uch long things, be grav'd on
trees, yet are they read with plea<U+017F>ure, taking them for fictions; and as for the
Letters and Ver<U+017F>es which a Lover makes on a <U+017F>udden, <U+017F>o that they be well done men
are <U+017F>atisfied, and no body is <U+017F>o <U+017F>crupulous as you are; on the contrary, people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into greater admiration, <U+017F>eeing tho<U+017F>e that are in love have <U+017F>uch <U+017F>mart and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fancies, and the hi<U+017F>tory is thereby made more plea<U+017F>ant. You <U+017F>hall have it, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Clarimond,</hi> you are then of tho<U+017F>e who finding in a <hi>Romance</hi> <U+017F>omething irrational
and contrary to cu<U+017F>tom, imagine it makes the adventure fuller of miracle. Hold
thy peace <hi>Clarimond,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> thou art nothing but a <U+017F>pirit of contradiction; I
am more taken with <hi>Philiris:</hi> He hath <U+017F>poken <U+017F>o well in the defence of Love-<U+017F>tories,
that I could have <U+017F>aid no more my <U+017F>elf. I thank you for this honor, <U+017F>ays <hi>Philiris;</hi>
but yet I advi<U+017F>e you not to trouble your <U+017F>elf with graving your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e on the tree,
le<U+017F>t you might not <U+017F>ucceed, and <U+017F>o give <hi>Clarimond</hi> occa<U+017F>ion to laugh at us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides,
there is one very con<U+017F>iderable thing I am to tell you; 'Tis no good pre<U+017F>age
to write your pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on a bark, becau<U+017F>e it might be thence inferr'd, that your
Love were only grav'd on the bark of your heart, and that you <U+017F>hould never grave
it any further on the heart of <hi>Charite.</hi> This hath a <U+017F>hew of rea<U+017F>on, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi>
and yet there is in it <U+017F>omwhat hurts me. What manner of <U+017F>peaking's this? <U+017F>ays
<hi>Clarimond:</hi> Are you da<U+017F>h'd again<U+017F>t the edge of <U+017F>ome Rock, or hath <U+017F>ome Bull
<U+017F>hewn you the di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ie of his horns? or hath your friend <hi>Philiris</hi> <U+017F>ome <U+017F>o great,
that he pu<U+017F>hes at all the world? What a little is it which thou knowe<U+017F>t, replies
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Thou wert never acquainted with the ingenuities of <hi>France,</hi> <U+017F>ince thou art
ignorant, that when we are not <U+017F>atisfied with a Fancie, we <U+017F>ay it <hi>cla<U+017F>hes;</hi> not that
this is done vi<U+017F>ibly, and that it <hi>hurts</hi> us in the body; for being purely <U+017F>piritual, it
can only touch the mind. Now we are much better, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> I would fain
know what you mean by the word <hi>Fancie.</hi> 'Tis true, that to accommodate my <U+017F>elf
to your humour, I have often <U+017F>poken of the<U+017F>e fine Fancies as well as you; but it
troubled me <U+017F>o much, that I could no longer <U+017F>tay the di<U+017F>covery of it to you. Tell
me now, were it not a crime among your Poets to <U+017F>ay <hi>conception?</hi> Is that word
out of u<U+017F>e with them, le<U+017F>t it might be thought they <U+017F>poke of the <hi>conception of a
woman?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not except again<U+017F>t the word <hi>conception,</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> it <U+017F>eems to repre<U+017F>ent
the thing when it is <hi>conceiv'd;</hi> but the word <hi>Fancie</hi> is more general, for it <U+017F>ignifies
all things which we can think of or imagine. Yet I confe<U+017F>s I thought it <U+017F>trange the
fir<U+017F>t time I <U+017F>aw it us'd, becau<U+017F>e there's no <U+017F>uch language in the Univer<U+017F>ity, and I am
<U+017F>omwhat trouble to u<U+017F>e my<U+017F>elf to it. As for <hi>conceits,</hi> every one knows what they are;
that it is properly a <U+017F>light winding up and down of words, or an allu<U+017F>ion, or <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>uch thing, You are in the right there, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond:</hi> but as to a <hi>fancie,</hi> I take
it to be a thing which the Poet imagines for the ornament of his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, as if you
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, <hi>My Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s 'ro<U+017F>e <U+017F>o betimes, that</hi> Aurora <hi>out of ba<U+017F>hfulne<U+017F>s return'd,
thinking <U+017F>he had lain abed longer then the Sun.</hi> 'Tis well known there's no <U+017F>uch
thing; and the Poet only <hi>fancies</hi> it, and therefore that ought to be call'd a <hi>Fancy,</hi>
and that's all can be conceiv'd of all other fanta<U+017F>tical imaginations that may have
their birth in a hollow brain. And this is a definition of <hi>Fancy,</hi> which the Poets of
the<U+017F>e times would think them<U+017F>elves happy to know; for I have <U+017F>ometimes put them
hard to it, when I ask'd them difference between a <hi>conception,</hi> a <hi>fancy,</hi> and a <hi>conceit.</hi>
Some told me there was not any, others gave me very poor and irrational differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and <U+017F>ome would give me no an<U+017F>wer at all.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Clarimond</hi> ended this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the re<U+017F>t of the company came into the place:
So that he took occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>ay, Wherein is it the plea<U+017F>ure of the<U+017F>e fair Ladies,
that we pa<U+017F>s away the day? What entertainment <U+017F>hall we fix upon? For my part,
my vote is for playing at <hi>Fancy-game,</hi> for it's a good while that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> talks to me
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43725:152"/>
of nothing el<U+017F>e. I'll tell you what the game is: There <U+017F>hall be one to ask the re<U+017F>t,
What do you think on? or what is your <hi>Fancy?</hi> And every one tells him his
thought. Then <U+017F>ayes he, Such a one hath thought <U+017F>uch a thing, 'tis for <U+017F>uch and
<U+017F>uch rea<U+017F>on; and <U+017F>o he is to give the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant rea<U+017F>ons he can find of all things,
to make the company <U+017F>port. There's no great <U+017F>ubtilty in that, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I know
<U+017F>ome more gentile <U+017F>ports, not to mention that of <hi>Love blinded:</hi> There's one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
every one is obliged to give <hi>Epithetes</hi> on every Letter of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es name; as
if I <U+017F>hould call <hi>Charite</hi> Cha<U+017F>te, Hone<U+017F>t, Amiable, Rich, Incomparable, Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
and Excellent. I have al<U+017F>o <U+017F>een excellent games in the <hi>Civil Conver<U+017F>ation</hi>
of <hi>Stephen Guazzo,</hi> and in the <hi>Courtier</hi> of <hi>Count Baltazard;</hi> for your <hi>Italians</hi> are
ingenious in this above any other, and it may be <U+017F>aid they <U+017F>port it very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly.
There's required much ingenuity to meddle with their pa<U+017F>times, and there's as
much employment for judgment and rea<U+017F>on, as if a man were in a Parliament where
every man were to propo<U+017F>e his advice. Let's have no more on't, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ayes <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica:</hi>
When people would recreate them<U+017F>elves, they mu<U+017F>t not make choice of
the mo<U+017F>t difficult pa<U+017F>times, the trouble would exceed the plea<U+017F>ure; let's content
our <U+017F>elves with <hi>Que<U+017F>tions</hi> and <hi>Commands.</hi> The propo<U+017F>ition is good, replies <hi>Philiris;</hi>
and to advance and ennoble this <U+017F>port equally with any other, the Commands <U+017F>hall
be of things of importance.</p>
            <p>Every one promoted this opinion, <U+017F>o that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was forced to <U+017F>ubmit to the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of voices. The company retir'd into an Arbor in the Garden, where the
Game begun: Some were condemn'd to tell a <U+017F>tory, others to tell how many
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es they had had; and it being come to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> his turn, they made him <U+017F>ing a
Song. When it came to him to command, it happen'd <hi>Philiris</hi> was under his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
He commanded him to choo<U+017F>e a Lady, and entertain her as if <U+017F>he were
his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and that he <U+017F>hould more particularly de<U+017F>cribe her beauty with te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of an extreme pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. <hi>Philiris,</hi> who had a nimble wit, and knew all the pretty
Love-conceits, was content; and having cho<U+017F>en <hi>Angelica</hi> for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and
ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf on one knee before her, he made this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to her, with his hat in
his hand.</p>
            <p>I am extremely glad, mo<U+017F>t incomparable Lady, that I have this pre<U+017F>ent liberty to
tell you what my heart is full of. There needed not a command to make me do
that, which that I might be admitted to my prayers were ever ready. Though there
are here a many per<U+017F>ons, the diver<U+017F>ity of who<U+017F>e inclinations I know not, yet <U+017F>hall
it not hinder me from repre<U+017F>enting unto you the ardencie of my affection, that <U+017F>o
many witne<U+017F><U+017F>es may make you blu<U+017F>h that you have been <U+017F>o long incredulous and
ingratefull towards me. I know not whether you are ignorant of the perfections
you are Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of; and if for that rea<U+017F>on you think it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer
under <U+017F>o much pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, yet whatever I hazard, can I not but once more give my
<U+017F>elf the <U+017F>atisfaction to repre<U+017F>ent unto you tho<U+017F>e excellent beauties wherewith you
have ravi<U+017F>h'd my <U+017F>oul. Tho<U+017F>e <hi>twi<U+017F>ts</hi> of <hi>gold</hi> which adorn your <hi>head,</hi> how gracefull
do they appear to tho<U+017F>e who de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>uch a noble captivity! they are able to chain
up tho<U+017F>e things that never were <U+017F>o before; and if <hi>Jupiter</hi> were to u<U+017F>e a golden
chain to draw the Earth to him, as he pretends to do in <hi>Homer,</hi> he mu<U+017F>t needs
make u<U+017F>e of this. Under this I di<U+017F>cover a <hi>Forehead</hi> <U+017F>o fair, that for to commend it
I mu<U+017F>t not imitate their imagination, that Love made his re<U+017F>idence there; for 'tis <U+017F>o
<U+017F>mooth, that that fickle Child could not fix on it: 'tis on wrinckled foreheads that
he hath the opportunity to erect his throne, and it mu<U+017F>t be thought that the <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wrinckles are the <U+017F>teps whereby we a<U+017F>cend to his chair of <U+017F>tate. But when he
<U+017F>et his foot there, he <U+017F>lid into your <hi>Eyes,</hi> where he found his mo<U+017F>t certain retreat:
but <U+017F>o it is, that whether with his will or again<U+017F>t it, he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tay there, for he burnt
his wings as <U+017F>oon as ever he enter'd in. This is the rea<U+017F>on that the wounds I receive
when you look on me are <U+017F>o dangerous, and it may be cleerly <U+017F>een that a powerful
Divinity is become the intelligence of tho<U+017F>e two bright <U+017F>tars which govern the
cour<U+017F>e of my life. But what miracles do I find on your <hi>Cheeks!</hi> the complexion
is white, but never pale, and the redne<U+017F>s is never ob<U+017F>cure. There is the <U+017F>ame bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:43725:153"/>
on the corral upon your fair <hi>lips,</hi> which are the portals of the Temple of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
What <U+017F>hall I <U+017F>ay of that <hi>neck</hi> and <hi>brea<U+017F>t!</hi> but that it is a mo<U+017F>t extravagant
imagination to compare them to Ivory and milk, <U+017F>ince they have a quite different
lu<U+017F>tre. The Poets celebrate their Mount <hi>Parna<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> whereon there are twins of
hills, and the tradition is, that he that hath <U+017F>lept thereon, becomes a con<U+017F>ummate
<hi>Poet;</hi> but its to be conceiv'd, that he that <U+017F>hould enjoy tho<U+017F>e two little mounts
which are on that fair brea<U+017F>t, would be far more divinely in<U+017F>pir'd, either for Poe<U+017F>ie
or Eloquence. As for the re<U+017F>t of the body, where though the beauties mu<U+017F>t be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
conceal'd, yet do I not doubt their perfection: And it mu<U+017F>t needs be great
<U+017F>ince it is honoured with the burthen of that fair head, wherein I finde <U+017F>o many
miracles: It hath more glory to <U+017F>upport that, then <hi>Atlas</hi> to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain heaven; for
here are far more divinities then in <hi>Jupiters</hi> Pallace. O how happy then mu<U+017F>t I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teem
thee, amiable <hi>body,</hi> to have <U+017F>o fair a <hi>face!</hi> and thou fair <hi>face,</hi> to be <U+017F>o happy
in <U+017F>uch bright <hi>eyes!</hi> and you bright <hi>eyes</hi> to be <U+017F>o full of <hi>Charms</hi> and <hi>Attraction!</hi>
But what's above all, how happy art thou fair body in the general, to be the
lodging of the faire<U+017F>t <U+017F>oul in the world? Methinks I have <U+017F>till <U+017F>omewhat to <U+017F>ay
in thy prai<U+017F>e, and that I have forgotten one part which <hi>I</hi> often <U+017F>ee. I have not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
the <hi>ears,</hi> though near neighbors to the cheeks, and are umbrag'd by the hair
with <U+017F>o much beauty. But why <U+017F>hould I <U+017F>peak of tho<U+017F>e unmerciful things? 'tis from
them proceeds the chiefe<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of my torment: They wil not hear what I <U+017F>uffer, that
<U+017F>o they might give an account to that divine <U+017F>pirit, which governs all the other
<U+017F>en<U+017F>es. As long as they <U+017F>hall continue in this <U+017F>everity, I cannot but take them
for my enemies; but if it happen they abate their rigour, I promi<U+017F>e them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
and redeem the time <hi>I</hi> have not honor'd them.</p>
            <p>I know not whether <hi>Philiris</hi> had <U+017F>omething further to <U+017F>ay; but there he <U+017F>tuck,
as it had been to call to minde <U+017F>ome other fine imagination to entertain <hi>Angelica:</hi>
They were all very attentive to his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which he delivered with a <U+017F>weet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and a delightful ge<U+017F>ture. <hi>Angelica</hi> her <U+017F>elf was nothing troubled to hear
her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o prais'd, though <U+017F>he blu<U+017F>hed a little; and as for the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> he was
<U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>h'd, that he went and embrac'd the courteous Orator: <U+017F>peaking to him in
the<U+017F>e words; <hi>Dear Friend, what charms are there in thy di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es! how <U+017F>weet and
amorous is thy <U+017F>tyle! I promi<U+017F>e thee quite to di<U+017F>engage</hi> Clarimond, <hi>and have no more
to do with him, thou art far the fitter to compo<U+017F>e my hi<U+017F>tory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiris</hi> thank'd the Shepherd for the honor he did him, and promis'd him his
utmo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervices. As for <hi>Clarimond,</hi> he <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf di<U+017F>engag'd, made a vow ever
to contradict <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and that in open Ho<U+017F>tility. The talk which ri<U+017F>e about this,
broke off the <U+017F>port, and thence they in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly fell upon the <U+017F>trange exploits of
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin.</hi> I have heard, <U+017F>aies <hi>Leonora,</hi> the Story of <hi>Meliantes,</hi> whereby
that Shepherd had <U+017F>hewn how his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was <U+017F>ecur'd in a Fortre<U+017F>s; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
<U+017F>he remembred all the particulars of her deliverance, as it had been related
to her; but <U+017F>he had not been told the true cau<U+017F>e of her captivity, nor who was the
author of it. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that if <U+017F>he would be <U+017F>atisfied in that,
<U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t addre<U+017F>s her <U+017F>elf to <hi>Hircan,</hi> who knows the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret things. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
having entreated him to tell what he knew of that bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: He began thus,
without any want of fabulous invention.</p>

                        <head>The Hi<U+017F>tory of the Magician Anaximander.</head>
                        <p>YOu are to know, dear Company, that in the I<U+017F>le where <hi>Pamphilia</hi> was
a captive, there is a Magician call'd <hi>Anaximander,</hi> who hath liv'd there
the<U+017F>e thirty years. Its no longer <U+017F>ince he was born, as mo<U+017F>t believe, and
yet he boa<U+017F>ts him<U+017F>elf to be the true Son of the Sorcere<U+017F>s <hi>Circe:</hi> As for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he knew not his name, becau<U+017F>e his mother was <U+017F>omewhat common. This
is not to make us believe that <U+017F>he liv'd to this age; that he expounds otherwi<U+017F>e.
He <U+017F>ays, that when <U+017F>he was alive, two thou<U+017F>and years <U+017F>ince, he having learned
of this good mother all magical <U+017F>ecrets, de<U+017F>ired to live eternally on earth, and
not go with her to heaven, nor yet to the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, becau<U+017F>e he took great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
plea<U+017F>ure to be here below. When he had examin'd all the receipts for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of age, he found none ea<U+017F>ier then that of exchanging of Bodies: He
thought it not fit to de<U+017F>ire one of his friends to kill him, and to take his body all
to pieces, to form another <U+017F>tronger out of it; he was afraid <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>hould
interrupt the operation, and that he might be left half made. A little Nephew
of his being knock'd in the head with a quoit, as he look'd on his Comrades
at play; he found a way to di<U+017F>charge his former body, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ume that of the
childe, which he afterwards animated to the great amazement of all the world,
who thought him dead. Four<U+017F>core years after, another little childe playing
among others who carried him pri<U+017F>oner, and made as if they would put him to
death, it hapned his companions throtl'd him in good earne<U+017F>t, <hi>Anaximander</hi>
made u<U+017F>e again of that body: and <U+017F>o hath he done with divers others to this day,
having the power to di<U+017F>engage his <U+017F>oul from this terre<U+017F>trial ma<U+017F>s, and fa<U+017F>ten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
as firmly, that it is equally fitted for the execution of all its functions, as
any other. He drinks, he eats, he <U+017F>leeps, he gets children, and yet is never <U+017F>ick.
His <U+017F>oul takes up bodies, as travellers do Inns, where they are as well accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
as at home. But one great advantage of his immortality is, that he hath
been of all conditions, which he hath freely pa<U+017F>s'd through, as they had been
only parts of a Play; and <U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t needs know a many things which others are
ignorant of. For the pre<U+017F>ent, the government of the I<U+017F>le where he lives is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into his hands, and becau<U+017F>e the place is very <U+017F>olitary, he delights much to
<U+017F>tudy Magick: But as his inclination is extreamly amorous, he looks much
into an enchanted gla<U+017F>s, wherein he <U+017F>ees the faire<U+017F>t women in all parts of the
world. When any one plea<U+017F>es him, he tran<U+017F>ports him<U+017F>elf into the Country where
<U+017F>he remains, and then makes her be brought away by <U+017F>pirits to his Ca<U+017F>tle. There
he enjoys her at his plea<U+017F>ure; but <U+017F>uch is his lewdne<U+017F>s, that when he hath done
him<U+017F>elf, he turns over to his <U+017F>laves the beauties, which before he had cho<U+017F>en for
the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es of his <U+017F>oul. Yet I have it from a good hand, that his mother ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to him a while <U+017F>ince, and advi<U+017F>ed him to give over his lewd life; becau<U+017F>e if
he would marry a certain Lady that was de<U+017F>tined for him, he <U+017F>hould have a <U+017F>on
by her that <U+017F>hould be more valiant then <hi>Cyrus</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <U+017F>hould bring
him the conque<U+017F>t of the world. He ask'd his good mother, by what means he
<U+017F>hould know that fatal woman; and of a <U+017F>udden <hi>Circe</hi> <U+017F>hews her <U+017F>elf to him, as
<U+017F>he was at the age of fifteen, and bid him view her well, becau<U+017F>e the woman he
<U+017F>hould have <U+017F>hould be like her.</p>
                        <p>He <U+017F>ince confulted with his gla<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Pamphilia</hi> in it, he imagin'd <U+017F>he
was much like <hi>Circe;</hi> <U+017F>o that after he had <U+017F>av'd her from <U+017F>hipwrack, and for pitty
<U+017F>ake her lover al<U+017F>o, he <U+017F>ent two Gyants to fetch her, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he came within
his I<U+017F>land. They are the <U+017F>ame which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is's</hi> incomparable valor hath defeated.
<hi>Meliantes</hi> thinking to relieve her, was divers times deceived; for the gate of
<hi>Anaximanders</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle had <U+017F>uch an enchantment, that though he left it open, yet
it <U+017F>hut of it <U+017F>elf when any enemy came near it. As for the old man who appear'd
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43725:154"/>
to him, and told him his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was in a place whence he could not deliver her,
but by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the <hi>French Shepherd;</hi> I acquaint you, that it was the <U+017F>ame
<hi>Hircan</hi> who now <U+017F>peaks to you: I had found out by my art, that one of the
brave<U+017F>t <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Per<U+017F>ia</hi> was in an extream affliction, and that if I did <U+017F>uccor
him, he would one day be my intimate friend; <U+017F>o that I chang'd <U+017F>hape, and
having found him, I put him into a <U+017F>leep, and <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported him into this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
He hath now obtain'd of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> what he de<U+017F>ired. That invincible Heros hath
been in the enchanted Fortre<U+017F>s, whence he delivered <hi>Pamphilia</hi> as you know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anaximander</hi> having had this Beauty in his power, had made his applications
to her, promi<U+017F>ing her great wonders, if <U+017F>he would be his wife. He was in hope
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould bring forth that great Warrior, as <hi>Circe</hi> had promis'd; and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
after he had conquered all the world, to make him away, and to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his body, that <U+017F>o he might him<U+017F>elf be King of all the world. But <hi>Pamphilia</hi>
calling to minde the merit and affection of <hi>Meliantes,</hi> could have none but him;
and in<U+017F>ultingly <U+017F>lighted him that had ravi<U+017F>h'd her away. This he was <U+017F>o angry at,
that he caus'd her to be put into a dungeon, where his two Gyants guarded her
with three or four hulch-back'd Souldiers, and a terre<U+017F>trial Dragon, a mo<U+017F>t hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
creature. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> went through all the<U+017F>e, when he was in the pri<U+017F>on; and that
<hi>Anaxiander</hi> did not appear to hinder him to force his guards, 'twas I had ca<U+017F>t him
into a deeper <U+017F>leep, then if he had been in the Palace of Sleep it <U+017F>elf; for I cannot
deny but it was I that brought <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> out of the coach, and led them
into the pri<U+017F>on, and brought them back to the coach together with <hi>Pamphilia.</hi>
I tran<U+017F>port my <U+017F>elf in an in<U+017F>tant to what place I plea<U+017F>e, and I put on what <U+017F>hape
<hi>I</hi> plea<U+017F>e. Now it was not for the wor<U+017F>t that <hi>Pamphilia</hi> remain'd <U+017F>ome time with
<hi>Anaximander,</hi> for <U+017F>he was in the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret place in the world, which was not
ami<U+017F>s for her, becau<U+017F>e the King of <hi>Per<U+017F>ia</hi> had made <U+017F>uch diligent <U+017F>earch for her,
that had <U+017F>he been any where el<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he had been certainly met with. Now there's
nothing to fear; <hi>I</hi> know for certain that <hi>Siramnes</hi> is killed by one of his Eunuchs:
<U+017F>o that all tho<U+017F>e who were per<U+017F>ecuted by him, may <U+017F>afely return into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
A Nephew of his, who now bears the Scepter, hath pardon'd all Criminals,
and hath recall'd all bani<U+017F>h'd per<U+017F>ons, on condition they <U+017F>erve <U+017F>ix years in the
wars without pay. Now <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e you are all <U+017F>atisfied, as having a perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of whatever was of importance in the captivity of <hi>Pamphilia.</hi>

               <hi>Hircan</hi> having <U+017F>poken thus, the Ladies admired in them<U+017F>elves his vivacity of
<U+017F>pirit, and were amaz'd to con<U+017F>ider that he could invent <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ort of lyes <U+017F>o readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was out of him<U+017F>elf to hear <U+017F>uch great <U+017F>ecrets, and <hi>Meliantes</hi> feign'd to be
no le<U+017F>s. <hi>Florida</hi> ask'd him why he brought not his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s with him, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
upon her <U+017F>olitary humor. <hi>Angelica</hi> al<U+017F>o ask'd what was become of <hi>Carmelin;</hi>
and why he was not come to relate his acts of valour. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> an<U+017F>wer'd, that he would
not come a hunting with the re<U+017F>t. <hi>Polidor</hi> <U+017F>aid at the <U+017F>ame time, that his Cou<U+017F>in
<hi>Meliantes</hi> was more happy then he, and by the relief done him, he had receiv'd his
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, whereas he for his part was far enough from his, and knew not whether
he <U+017F>hould ever obtain her favor. My intentions are more noble and more ju<U+017F>t then
yours, replies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> and therefore heaven hath pro<U+017F>per'd them. <hi>I</hi> love a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and an honorable Lady, in who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervice I think <hi>I</hi> do my duty to vertue it <U+017F>elf:
but you, you <U+017F>igh for a <hi>Rhodogina,</hi> whom <hi>I</hi> have heard accounted as common as
the high-way. Dye confidently for her, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>es you <U+017F>o much affliction;
you will receive as great glory by it as ever had <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> for ca<U+017F>ting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
into the gulf at <hi>Rome,</hi> for you <U+017F>hall dye for what is publike.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polidor</hi> made as if he had been angry at the<U+017F>e over-free words, but there pa<U+017F>s'd no
blows. <hi>Hircan</hi> appeas'd all; he told <hi>Meliantes</hi> he was deceiv'd in his licentious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion;
and as for <hi>Polidor,</hi> he promis'd him, that a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he were returned to
<hi>Per<U+017F>ia,</hi> he <U+017F>hould obtain the reward of his love, provided he brought <hi>Rhodogina</hi> the
bark of the <hi>Hamadryad.</hi> He <U+017F>wore to him that he had enclo<U+017F>ed that precious piece
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43725:154"/>
in a <U+017F>ilver-box, and that he had been already gone, were it not for the inevitable
charms of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s conver<U+017F>ation. You do well to <U+017F>tay here till <U+017F>uch time as you are a
perfect ma<U+017F>ter of the art of <hi>Shepherdry,</hi> <U+017F>ays the <hi>Hero</hi>-Shepherd, for <U+017F>o you wilbe able
to read Lectures to your Countrymen. 'Tis my de<U+017F>ign to bring up a many Youths
in the <U+017F>ame manner, that I may <U+017F>end them away afterwards, one into <hi>Turkey,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <U+017F>o others into other places, to teach all the Earth the way to
live happily. Now this Art of Shepherdry is not learned in a day, for it is the
Art of all Arts; I mean it is the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of all, and all other Arts and Sciences
depend of it. For to be a good <hi>Shepherd,</hi> a man mu<U+017F>t be a good <hi>Orator,</hi> a good <hi>Poet,</hi>
a good <hi>Mu<U+017F>itian,</hi> a good <hi>Painter,</hi> and a good <hi>Dancer;</hi> but above all things in the
world he mu<U+017F>t know well how to <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was <U+017F>o late when this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, that <hi>Orontes</hi> was forc'd out of civility
to invite the company to <U+017F>upper; and indeed it was not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie to break it up, and
quit <U+017F>uch plea<U+017F>ant entertainments. After <U+017F>upper <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would needs made a party
with <hi>Philiris,</hi> leaving <U+017F>ome playing at Picquet, others di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing. Dear friend,
<U+017F>ays he to this Shepherd, I mu<U+017F>t profe<U+017F>s to thee that <U+017F>ince the fir<U+017F>t time I <U+017F>aw thee,
a certain fatality in<U+017F>pir'd me that thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t write my Hi<U+017F>tory: Therefore that
this in<U+017F>piration may be effectual, I de<U+017F>ire thee to <U+017F>et thy <U+017F>elf to it; and do not think
I expect any thing from <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who is but a trouble<U+017F>om and a railing fellow.
If you think me able to <U+017F>erve you, I <U+017F>hall willingly undertake the employment,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Philiris,</hi> but I fear me I <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>atisfie you; for a man <U+017F>hould be in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of your thoughts to con<U+017F>ider what you have there, and expre<U+017F>s tho<U+017F>e things
which no man could be<U+017F>ides him to whom they happened. Trouble not thy <U+017F>elf for
any thing, I will give thee <U+017F>ufficient in<U+017F>tructions, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> This is not the fir<U+017F>t
time that a Lover hath turn'd over the de<U+017F>cription of his Loves to another, wanting
the convenience to do it him<U+017F>elf; his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion either denying him the patience, or
haply making another <U+017F>peak, that might give him tho<U+017F>e prai<U+017F>es which he dur<U+017F>t not
give him<U+017F>elf. 'Tis not long <U+017F>ince that one of my acquaintance did the like. When
he gave the Author directions, Let this Gentleman and that Lady, <U+017F>ays he, be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
one of another; let tho<U+017F>e two fight with <U+017F>uch two, but let the more incon<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
per<U+017F>on be kill'd, for I have occa<U+017F>ion for the other three in <U+017F>ome following
adventures, as being per<U+017F>ons of more eminent quality. A while after you mu<U+017F>t have
a Letter written to one of our mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Lovers, and then <U+017F>hall he entertain
his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s with a Serenade; and the Mu<U+017F>ick <U+017F>hall fir<U+017F>t be loud, and then de<U+017F>cend
to Ba<U+017F>es and other In<U+017F>truments to awaken all that are near, and after this let the
Gentleman <U+017F>ing to the Lute, whereto <U+017F>hall an<U+017F>wer a full Con<U+017F>ort: let the Ver<U+017F>es be
<U+017F>weet and polite, and let there be no fancies that <U+017F>hall touch at any.</p>
            <p>And thus did this Lover direct his Hi<U+017F>toriographer, and I doubt not but that
great Clerk performed what was excellent: For it is he, that walking once with four
or five of his friends, be<U+017F>poke them thus: Let me have ten thou<U+017F>and men well
armed, and let me be allow'd three moneths time, and I promi<U+017F>e the King my
ma<U+017F>ter and his Princes my good friends, that by true acts of valour and by lawfull
<U+017F>tratagems I will conquer a Country <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>ix hundred leagues about, and <U+017F>hall
have a hundred Cities as <U+017F>trong and as well peopled as <hi>Orleans,</hi> be<U+017F>ides all Towns
and Ca<U+017F>tles. When will you do it, <U+017F>ayes <U+017F>omebody to him, <U+017F>hall we ever <U+017F>ee it?
where <U+017F>hall it be? In a <hi>Romance,</hi> replies he very confidently. That was an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
fellow; he maintain'd that he who was able to make a <hi>Romance,</hi> was able
to do any thing: He's fit to be the <hi>Generall of an Army,</hi> a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> a <hi>Pre<U+017F>ident,</hi>
a <hi>Lover,</hi> and a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> if you plea<U+017F>e; for <U+017F>ince he can make every one of the<U+017F>e
<U+017F>peak according to his quality, and can make them govern with all requi<U+017F>ite ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of order, there's no que<U+017F>tion but he him<U+017F>elf would very well di<U+017F>charge all
tho<U+017F>e places if they were be<U+017F>tow'd on him. But you do not tell us, interrupted <hi>Philiris,</hi>
that he's as fit to be a Drummer as a Captain, and a Catchpole as well as a Judge:
your Romanci<U+017F>ts do as well repre<U+017F>ent the lowe<U+017F>t as the highe<U+017F>t actions. Thou
ha<U+017F>t a mind to be merry, dear friend, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> yet know our Author was a
very able man, without any di<U+017F>paragement to thee or any other. To return to my
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:43725:155"/>
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, if thou wilt write my hi<U+017F>tory, I will give thee the conduct of it. I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e
thou may<U+017F>t have gathered <U+017F>omwhat here and there of me already, but I <U+017F>hall tell
thee much more; and now take it from the very beginning.</p>
            <p>In the fir<U+017F>t place thou <U+017F>halt make me take the Shepherds habit at <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> for
there was the beginning of my noble adventures: And then thou mu<U+017F>t de<U+017F>cribe
with what affection I contemplated tho<U+017F>e incon<U+017F>iderable things which I pre<U+017F>erv'd
in remembrance of <hi>Charite,</hi> that is to <U+017F>ay, the <hi>peece of Leather,</hi> the <hi>Paper,</hi> and the
re<U+017F>t. Now here thou mu<U+017F>t make u<U+017F>e of <hi>amplification,</hi> <U+017F>aying, that I <U+017F>o loved my
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, that I would not only pre<U+017F>erve whatever came from her, but that I al<U+017F>o
made a vow carefully to keep whatever were about me when I had the happine<U+017F>s to
<U+017F>peak to her, or receive any favour from her. As for example, if I chanc'd to go to
<U+017F>ee her where <U+017F>he lived, and that <U+017F>he entertained me favourably, my de<U+017F>igne
was ever after to pre<U+017F>erve, as a precious relique, my good and beloved Shoes
which had brought me into <U+017F>o <U+017F>acred a place. And this was in my thoughts ever
<U+017F>ince that time, though I never <U+017F>poke of it. In the next place thou <U+017F>halt bring in
how I met <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> and gave him the <U+017F>tory of my Youth, and acquainted him with
the original of my Loves, which mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>oon pa<U+017F>t over: And then <U+017F>halt thou men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that excellent <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Picture of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, which he drew at his hou<U+017F>e.
'Tis there that is required a triumph of eloquence: My advice is, that thou make u<U+017F>e
of divers Rhetorical figures, e<U+017F>pecially if thou make my affections relate to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of the draught and all that concerns it, thou wilt make a <U+017F>piritual thing of a
corporal. The <hi>Copper-piece,</hi> <U+017F>halt thou <U+017F>ay, is a <hi>rough metal, poli<U+017F>h'd</hi> by the <U+017F>everity
of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s <U+017F>ufferings; the <hi>Gold</hi> that <U+017F>hines in it is his <hi>fidelity;</hi> the <hi>white</hi> is his <hi>purity</hi>
and <hi>innocence:</hi> The <hi>fle<U+017F>h-colour</hi> that's in it, is his <hi>amorous</hi> inclination; the <hi>Fermilion</hi>
his re<U+017F>pectfull <hi><U+017F>hamefac'dne<U+017F>s;</hi> the <hi>black,</hi> his <hi><U+017F>adne<U+017F>s</hi> and <hi>affliction;</hi> the <hi>blue,</hi> the
<hi>divinity</hi> of his <hi>imaginations:</hi> The <hi><U+017F>eparation</hi> and divi<U+017F>ion are <hi>bani<U+017F>hments</hi> and <hi>opticks;</hi>
but as for <hi><U+017F>hadow</hi> there's very little, becau<U+017F>e <hi>jealou<U+017F>ie</hi> which is the cau<U+017F>er of them,
can finde no place there. All the<U+017F>e colours have been <hi>di<U+017F>temper'd</hi> with the <hi>oyl</hi> of
<hi>indulgence</hi> of a thou<U+017F>and <hi>attractions</hi> of love-looks, and <hi>beaten</hi> on the marble of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy.</hi>
This done, there may be us'd a hand<U+017F>om <hi>revocation,</hi> and thou maye<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak
thus, The affection which <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> bore <hi>Charite,</hi> made me believe a while that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
had him<U+017F>elf furni<U+017F>h'd what was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for this picture; but <hi>I</hi> have under<U+017F>tood
<U+017F>ince, that it was his de<U+017F>ire it might be done with nobler things, at lea<U+017F>t as noble as
could be found. There are tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ay, there was no more left of the <hi>Brazen-Age</hi>
then that <hi>Copper-piece,</hi> and that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had purpo<U+017F>ely taken away that, being
to pa<U+017F>s out of the <hi>iron</hi> age into that of <hi>gold.</hi> As for the <hi>gold</hi> that gli<U+017F>ters in <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite's</hi>
eyes, and her chained tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, 'tis certain that it is <U+017F>ome of that into which
<hi>Midas</hi>'s wine was turn'd when he was to drink, after he had the gift of changing
whatever he touch'd into <hi>gold;</hi> and it may be <U+017F>aid by parenthe<U+017F>is, that that gold
might ea<U+017F>ily be made potable. The <hi>white</hi> is the milk which <hi>Venus</hi> had in her
brea<U+017F>ts, when <U+017F>he nurs'd <hi>Cupid;</hi> for her milk was far better then <hi>Juno's,</hi> who was
too cholerick to be a nur<U+017F>e: As to the <hi>fle<U+017F>h-colour,</hi> we know not what to <U+017F>ay to it,
but at la<U+017F>t we have imagin'd it made of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s <hi><U+017F>weat;</hi> for he being of a perfect
red, as may be <U+017F>een, his <U+017F>weat is dy'd by it, nay, his very tears are colour'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
and if there be no likelihood of this, it mu<U+017F>t be conceiv'd that this fle<U+017F>h-colour
is compos'd of <U+017F>ome other.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Vermilion,</hi> 'tis the <hi>blood</hi> of the Godde<U+017F>s of <hi>Autumn,</hi> which is one of
the four Sea<U+017F>ons, who having a while <U+017F>ince overheated her<U+017F>elf, <hi>E<U+017F>culapius</hi> was
forc'd to let her blood; for in heaven he is both <hi>Doctor</hi> and Surgeon, and ob<U+017F>erves
whatever is pre<U+017F>crib'd there. The <hi>black</hi> is <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpina's</hi> Paint: For as in the<U+017F>e Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
there's much pains be<U+017F>towed to become white, <U+017F>o there <U+017F>he takes as much to
make her<U+017F>elf black, as being one of the mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>pecial parts of beauty. The <hi>blue</hi>
without que<U+017F>tion comes from <hi>Neptunes</hi> hair, which he cut off <U+017F>ome dayes <U+017F>ince,
which by <U+017F>ome rare <U+017F>ecret hath been made liquid. As for the <hi>partitions,</hi> I believe
<hi>good fortune</hi> made them, becau<U+017F>e nothing <hi>departs</hi> from us <U+017F>ooner: And as for the
<hi><U+017F>hadows.</hi> I believe the great Sun of the world, or tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Charite's</hi> eyes are the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:43725:155"/>
cau<U+017F>ers of them; for though the Sun be the giver of light, yet he cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<U+017F>hades, but makes them a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever any <U+017F>olid body oppo<U+017F>es its beams. The
<hi>oyl</hi> wherewith all the<U+017F>e colours have been <hi>di<U+017F>temper'd,</hi> is the very <U+017F>ame wherewith
<hi>Hercules</hi> anointed him<U+017F>elf, when he was to wre<U+017F>tle at the <hi>Olimpick Games.</hi> As for
the <hi>marble</hi> whereon they were beaten, 'twas a piece of the fir<U+017F>t <hi>altar,</hi> which was
erected to the Gods after the deluge. We had erewhiles forgot the <U+017F>hells to put
the<U+017F>e different colours in; but it mu<U+017F>t be thought <hi>Venus</hi>'s <U+017F>hell was made u<U+017F>e of,
with the Egg<U+017F>hel of <hi>Loeda,</hi> and for the <hi>Pencils,</hi> they are made of <hi>Loves feathers,</hi>
and his <hi>Mothers hair;</hi> this mu<U+017F>t be rather <U+017F>aid, then they made u<U+017F>e of any feathers
of the wind <hi>Boreas:</hi> Lovers have not <U+017F>o much to do with him.</p>
            <p>When thou ha<U+017F>t thus <U+017F>poken of <hi>Charites</hi> Picture, dear <hi>Philiris,</hi> thou mu<U+017F>t bring
in the Letter that I writ to her, which I will dictate to thee word for word. But here
I mu<U+017F>t have a conceit which all the world knows not yet. Mo<U+017F>t part of your <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manci<U+017F>ts,</hi>
when they introduce a man telling a Story, after they have made him <U+017F>ay,
<hi>I writ a Letter to my faire<U+017F>t, to this purpo<U+017F>e,</hi> put down afterwards in Capital Letters,
<hi>PHILIRIS</hi>'S <hi>LETTER TO BASILIA, POLIDOR</hi>'S <hi>LETTER TO RHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOGINA;</hi>
and <U+017F>o of others, and then the whole Letter at length. That's no way
hand<U+017F>om, <hi>I</hi> like it not; as for example, if I <U+017F>hould relate to you my hi<U+017F>tory from
one end to another, if <hi>I</hi> were to <U+017F>ay I write a letter to <hi>Charite,</hi> which was to this
purpo<U+017F>e, mu<U+017F>t <hi>I</hi> pronounce aloud the<U+017F>e words, <hi>LYSIS</hi>'S <hi>LETTER TO CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITE?</hi>
that were ridiculous. As there's no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of reciting that title, <U+017F>o there's
none to write it, unle<U+017F>s it haply be in the margent, as an Annotation or Remark
for the convenience of the Readers; but <hi>I</hi> have an incomparable invention to this
purpo<U+017F>e, when the book comes to be printed; it <U+017F>hall be thus, <hi>Being highly de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to di<U+017F>cover my affection to that fair one, I writ her this:</hi> here the line di<U+017F>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues,
and a little lower there <U+017F>hall be <hi>LETTER</hi> in a great character, and then
the Letter follows. This <U+017F>hall <U+017F>erve for a title for the convenience of the Reader,
and this <U+017F>hall nothing interrupt the Sy<U+017F>tem of the narration. In like manner may
be <U+017F>aid, <hi>This Gentleman, that Prince, that Lover or Shepherd, willing to lighten his
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion by the charms of Poetry, on a <U+017F>udden broke into the<U+017F>e</hi> (and a little under)
<hi>STANZA'S,</hi> and <U+017F>o the Ver<U+017F>es afterwards. <hi>That Knight not being able to <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>uch
an affront from his Rival, <U+017F>ent him this</hi> (under it) <hi>CHALLENGE,</hi> with the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
following. And this is an ingenious way to acquire reputation; nor is it a <U+017F>mall
fault to <U+017F>ay, <hi>Polidor having obtained <U+017F>ilence, began thus his Hi<U+017F>tory;</hi> and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to make a great title of the<U+017F>e words, <hi>THE HISTORY OF POLIDOR
AND RHODOGINA,</hi> or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch thing; for <hi>Polidor</hi> being to tell his Story,
will not pronounce that title aloud: 'Tis a folly to put it, and by that means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. 'Twere enough to put it in the margent, or make u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome
invention like that beforemention'd. Yet there are good Authors fail in this point;
but <hi>I,</hi> who take from others but what is be<U+017F>t, mu<U+017F>t freely reform what's ami<U+017F>s.
When thou ha<U+017F>t hand<U+017F>omly brought in my Letter, thou mu<U+017F>t tell by what means it
came to <hi>Charite's</hi> hands; how <hi>I</hi> got up and laid it on her window, and fa<U+017F>tened
<hi>Garlands</hi> at the door; and then how <hi>I</hi> was carried away by <hi>Pirates,</hi> who yet kept
me not long a captive, becau<U+017F>e they were <hi>An<U+017F>elms</hi> Friends.</p>
            <p>I forgot the meeting with the <hi>Satyr,</hi> and many other particulars, which I <U+017F>hall
give thee another time in order: As for what hath been done in this Country. I
believe thou art in good part inform'd. Thou mu<U+017F>t put down the adventures I ran
through when I was di<U+017F>guis'd like a <hi>Maid,</hi> and then thou <U+017F>halt affirm for certain
that I was Metamorphos'd into a <hi>Tree,</hi> though divers hold the contrary. But as
for tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>hall be concern'd in any of the<U+017F>e accidents, my humble <U+017F>uit is they
may be honorably treated, they mu<U+017F>t be con<U+017F>ider'd according to the affection they
bore me, that they may be worthily recompen<U+017F>ed. Thou maye<U+017F>t adde what loo<U+017F>e
pieces thou plea<U+017F>e to my hi<U+017F>tory; as for example, the Loves of tho<U+017F>e of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
it will make the work the more recommendable. Now I acquaint thee,
that when thou art to <U+017F>ay, I am in this place or that, when I am in any <U+017F>olitary
place, it will not be ami<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ay, I was making of <hi>Ver<U+017F>es;</hi> for indeed, when I am
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:43725:156"/>
alone, I do nothing but ruminate on them. Yet I permit thee to make <U+017F>ome thy
<U+017F>elf to adorn the Narration, or to thru<U+017F>t in <U+017F>ome old papers of thine, that <U+017F>o they
may not be lo<U+017F>t; for there are a many have compos'd <hi>Romances,</hi> on purpo<U+017F>e to
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of their ancient Poetry. I <U+017F>hall furni<U+017F>h thee with <U+017F>ome of my own; and
as for what <U+017F>hall come from thee, it mu<U+017F>t be purely an imitation of my <U+017F>tyle. I
am in doubt whether we <U+017F>hould bring in more <hi>Stanza's</hi> or <hi>Elegies.</hi> I know not
whether is the better; They <U+017F>ay that the making of <hi>Elegies,</hi> is like our ordinary
<hi>walking;</hi> and the making of <hi>Stanza's</hi> in divers cadencies and mea<U+017F>ures is as it were
<hi>dancing:</hi> <U+017F>o that the one is much harder then the other. There are others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Philiris,</hi> that <U+017F>ay that the making of <hi>Stanza's</hi> is like the <U+017F>hifting of little
birds from bough to bough, as being yet not fully fledg'd; but that the making of
<hi>Elegies</hi> is the taking of a far flight, which is proper only for <U+017F>uch birds as know their
trade. The<U+017F>e <U+017F>imilitudes confound me, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I know not whether I <U+017F>hould
believe, wherefore let there be of both as thou think<U+017F>t fit. The<U+017F>e degre<U+017F><U+017F>ions have
kept us from <U+017F>peaking of the principal things that concern us. Thou art to take
notice, that before thou <U+017F>et thy <U+017F>elf on work about my Loves, thou mu<U+017F>t for a
long time go a hunting after <hi>fancies,</hi> that thou may<U+017F>t be well provided on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions
and <U+017F>ubjects. As for thy <U+017F>tyle, it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>mooth and not rough, as that of
<U+017F>ome Writers of the<U+017F>e times, in who<U+017F>e works a man cannot read three pages, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hazarding the skin of his throat, <U+017F>o far as would require above two ounces of
Lickeri<U+017F>h to make it whole again. But to aim at perfection, I think it were not fit
to bring in twice in the <U+017F>ame page, the word <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> nor divers others which I <U+017F>hall
call to minde. I would not yet have thee follow in all things the rules of our
new Reformers of language; becau<U+017F>e (for<U+017F>ooth) they never read any thing, nor
can cite any thing; they would have nothing at all quoted, neither in Pro<U+017F>e nor
Ver<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that a man mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>hake hands with Hi<U+017F>tories and Fables, <U+017F>ince a man dur<U+017F>t
not <U+017F>peak of them: but we mu<U+017F>t contemn their ignorance, for I would gladly have
your ancient things brought into competition with the modern, were it for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rea<U+017F>on, but that this cau<U+017F>es the bringing in of a many proper names, which by
their great letters would extremely <U+017F>et out the <U+017F>tory. Next to this, comes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idered,
that thy di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es mu<U+017F>t not be tyed to one kinde of period, nor be always
of one dre<U+017F>s like the fools coat in a Play. 'Tis an excellent <U+017F>ecret <hi>I</hi> heard one boa<U+017F>t
of at <hi>Paris; I</hi> think he had an Ell wherewith he mea<U+017F>ured all his periods, clipping
them if they chanc'd to fall out too long, or el<U+017F>e he ca<U+017F>t them in a mold, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ured
them by the pottle, <U+017F>uch was his dexterity in that point; whereof he gave this
rea<U+017F>on, becau<U+017F>e he was a Poet, an Orator, and a Mu<U+017F>itian (which <U+017F>eldom happens)
and knew all the mea<U+017F>ures, cadences and harmonies of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which others were
ignorant of. But we <U+017F>hall do well enough to imitate him, nay exceed him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
when the book <U+017F>hall be fini<U+017F>hed, thou mu<U+017F>t not dedicate it to <hi>Charite</hi> alone,
as I <U+017F>ometime propos'd to <hi>Clarimond.</hi> Thou <U+017F>halt dedicate it to me too, and <U+017F>halt
make either of us an Epi<U+017F>tle. But here's one thing troubles me extreamly, to know
when the book is bound up in read Spani<U+017F>h Leather, with our Characters upon it;
whether thou wilt come and pre<U+017F>ent it with only a <U+017F>imple complement; as to <U+017F>ay,
Incomparable Shepherd, <hi>I</hi> pre<U+017F>ent you with this work in my dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing; or whether
it will be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that thou repeat to us by heart the Epi<U+017F>tle that <U+017F>hall be in the
book, which thou <U+017F>halt pronounce, as if it were an Oration. The Author <hi>I</hi> quoted
before, de<U+017F>irous to dedicate his book to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was in the <U+017F>ame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity.
Now thou art to know, that he having <U+017F>ufficiently dedicated his books in this
Kingdom, goes from Country to Country to <U+017F>eek new Gods to <U+017F>acrifice unto, and 'tis
thought that one of the<U+017F>e days he wil go and pre<U+017F>ent <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> with a <hi>Romance</hi>
of <hi>Knight-Errantry,</hi> to in<U+017F>truct him in the <hi>Militia;</hi> and the great <hi>Turk</hi> with a book
of <hi>Love-Letters,</hi> to teach him how to overcome the cruelty of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, which
mu<U+017F>t be <hi>Per<U+017F>ia, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> whom he hath along time
been a <U+017F>uitor to. This Author, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ay, being on his departure, thought it was but
civility to repeat his Epi<U+017F>tle Dedicatory all through before him he <U+017F>hold pre<U+017F>ent his
book to, though he had never done it-before. But to be more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured in the bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:43725:156"/>
he knew not whether he <U+017F>hould take the advice of a <hi>Ca<U+017F>ui<U+017F>t,</hi> a <hi>Civilian,</hi> or a
<hi><U+017F>worn Stationer.</hi> At la<U+017F>t a certain Poet told him, that <U+017F>ince men put Epi<U+017F>tles before
their books 'twas a <U+017F>ign the Authors never pre<U+017F>ented them them<U+017F>elves, but <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>end them, though they liv'd in the <U+017F>ame hou<U+017F>e with their <hi>Mecenas,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the
Epi<U+017F>tles would <U+017F>peak for them, there being no need of their pre<U+017F>ence; I think he
took his advice, for he gave over his voyage into <hi>Spain.</hi> Thou mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>eriously con<U+017F>ider
what judgement thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t make on <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion: But <U+017F>ince we are come
<U+017F>o far, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall note to thee the opinion of the <U+017F>ame Author upon a <U+017F>onnet in <hi>Pa<U+017F>quire</hi>
again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>peaking to the King, make u<U+017F>e of the word <hi>Your Maje<U+017F>ty,</hi> as if
they <U+017F>poke of another per<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>o make the Royalty <hi>feminine,</hi> which was, never
to call the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his <hi>Catholick Maje<U+017F>ty</hi> in his Epi<U+017F>tle. He <U+017F>aid that when
he heard that word, he imagin'd it <U+017F>poken of the Kings wife, and to give the King
a more convenient title, it mu<U+017F>t be a ma<U+017F>culine; as if one <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, <hi>Sir, <U+017F>ince it
hath plea<U+017F>ed your Ray to <U+017F>hed its favours on me;</hi> or to <U+017F>peak yet better, <hi>Sir, <U+017F>ince
your Power hath vouch<U+017F>afed to look on me with a favourable eye, I will dye in the <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of your power: I am your Powers mo<U+017F>t humble Va<U+017F><U+017F>al.</hi> Thus you <U+017F>ee this writer
had hand<U+017F>om inventions: but 'tis true, for <U+017F>ome we have no need of them, and for
the re<U+017F>t, they are not much better then <U+017F>uch as we <U+017F>hould find out our <U+017F>elves. You
give me <U+017F>uch excellent in<U+017F>tructions, <U+017F>ays <hi>Philiris,</hi> that if I have but the ingenuity to
follow them, I <U+017F>hall be the be<U+017F>t Author in the world, but mu<U+017F>t acknowledge an
obligation to you, both for my eloquence and reputation: I wi<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elf already
retir'd, that I might take notes of all you have <U+017F>aid. I have not told thee all, <U+017F>ayes
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> There will be one thing very remarkable in my Hi<U+017F>tory, if thou write it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
before there happen any notable change in my affairs; and that is, that
all who <U+017F>hall read it will be finely decoy'd; they will imagine to find at la<U+017F>t a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
between the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and the Shephedre<U+017F>s <hi>Charite</hi> according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
rules of all <hi>Romances,</hi> but there will be no <U+017F>uch thing. `Tis certain they will
be much deceiv'd there, replies <hi>Philiris</hi> <U+017F>miling; but your marriage <U+017F>hall come in
in the continuation of your adventures, which I <U+017F>hall one day fini<U+017F>h. But that <U+017F>hall
not be till <U+017F>uch time as we <U+017F>hall have no Readers but <U+017F>uch as will be abu<U+017F>ed. Yet I
mu<U+017F>t tell you, the circumvention will be ever thought remarkable. I have known
divers <hi>Romanci<U+017F>ts,</hi> who would come and make their brags to me, that they would
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e and decoy all the world; for the fir<U+017F>t Romance they would make <U+017F>hould
begin at the end, and that there was no great art or <U+017F>ubtilty to begin one but in the
mid<U+017F>t. As for yours, I <U+017F>hall begin it according to your order and in<U+017F>tructions to <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond:</hi>
but though your adventures be already very eminent, and able to <U+017F>atisfie
the mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>dainfull and nau<U+017F>eous intellects, yet I <U+017F>hould entreat you to add to and
heighten them if it may be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that <U+017F>o the work may be the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
            <p>While the two Shepherds were thus quietly taken up, <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi>
overheard all their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, having gotten clo<U+017F>e by them without making any
noi<U+017F>e. They were mightily taken with the excellent and admirable directions of
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> yet <hi>Clarimond</hi> would needs go to his own hou<U+017F>e, bethinking him it was a
long time <U+017F>ince he had <U+017F>een his mother, who haply wanted him in <U+017F>omwhat or other.
He took leave of all the company, and <U+017F>aid to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> Though you are my enemy,
yet I am more your friend then you imagine. We <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee that hereafter, replies
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is. Clarimond</hi> got immediately on hor<U+017F>-back, leaving at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s tho<U+017F>e who had
not <U+017F>o great occa<U+017F>ion to be gone as him<U+017F>elf.</p>

<hi>Claricia,</hi> who was <U+017F>o deep in your affections, that when you were at <hi>Paris</hi> you
<U+017F>tirred not from her hou<U+017F>e, and carried her often to Court. O God! who told

He came to <U+017F>ee me at St. <hi>Clou</hi> without your knowledge, and there he
gave me an account of you. 'Tis the greate<U+017F>t cheat in the world, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi>
now that I know the crime whereof I am accu<U+017F>ed, I <U+017F>hall ea<U+017F>ily make my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

An<U+017F>elme</hi> being thus permitted to <U+017F>peak to the pre<U+017F>ent occa<U+017F>ion, began his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e

                        <head>The HISTORY of CLARICIA.</head>
                        <p>I Suppo<U+017F>e you are not to be acquainted that this <hi>Claricia</hi> is a lewd one, who is
at his <U+017F>ervice that paies her be<U+017F>t: It is <U+017F>ix months <U+017F>ince that taking notice of
me <U+017F>omewhere, <U+017F>he would have me to be her <U+017F>ervant: I do not <U+017F>peak this out of
vanity, nor yet out of any e<U+017F>teem I make of the endowments either of my mind
or body; for I am not ignorant how that <U+017F>he never knew any other merit then
riches. She did what <U+017F>he could to meet me in the Churches whether I went,
that I might at la<U+017F>t haply be touched with <U+017F>ome affection towards her; but I
had no more thought of her then if <U+017F>he had never been; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t needs
have practized <U+017F>ome invention to have catched me. As I walked one evening
near the Ar<U+017F>enal, a Souldier came and acco<U+017F>ted me with the<U+017F>e words, Sir, I
under<U+017F>tand you are a per<U+017F>on very <U+017F>tudious of curio<U+017F>ities and rarities, and that
hath made me <U+017F>o bold as to acquaint you that there is a friend of mine who hath
got <U+017F>ome of the rare<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecrets in the world. I was <U+017F>o curious as to hearken to
what he <U+017F>aid; and though I knew there were a many Mountebanks in <hi>Paris,</hi>
yet would I try whether this were one. I askd the Souldier what was his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<U+017F>tudy whom he <U+017F>poke to me of; he told me by a certain <U+017F>ecret knowledge
he had, he would <U+017F>hew me whom I <U+017F>hould marry: and after this he an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>o
pertinently to divers que<U+017F>tions, that I took him at lea<U+017F>t for an hone<U+017F>t fellow, and
<U+017F>uffered him to walk with me till I came to my own hou<U+017F>e. I told him at parting
that I much de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee his friend<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and bid him come the next morning to
bring me to him. He failed not to come; <U+017F>o that I went along with him to a little
hou<U+017F>e near the Temple, where being entred, he told me his friend was not yet
come, and that I mu<U+017F>t wait a little in the Ma<U+017F>ter of the hou<U+017F>e's chamber; which
was <U+017F>o low and <U+017F>o unhand<U+017F>om that I had rather have <U+017F>taid in the <U+017F>treet. Swords
and Halbards were di<U+017F>po'sd over the chimney on the <U+017F>ame rack with the Spits.
Again<U+017F>t the chimney-<U+017F>tock were nailed up two or three wooden <U+017F>hooes, one <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for a <U+017F>alt<U+017F>eller, another for blacking, another held matches and <U+017F>pice. All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
were broken half-pecks turn'd up-<U+017F>ide-down in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>tools, nor indeed
were there any other all about the chamber. At one end there was a piece of mat
made a partition, which <U+017F>erved both for Wardrobe and Buttery, and thence was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43725:158"/>
brought me out a lame joint-<U+017F>tool, which was made to <U+017F>tand even by the help
of a faggot-<U+017F>tick. I <U+017F>ate thereon as a Pre<U+017F>ident in his <U+017F>eat, while in the mean time
the Souldier practi<U+017F>ed the five po<U+017F>tures he had learn'd a while before. He whom
we <U+017F>tay for wil be here now <U+017F>uddenly (would he <U+017F>ometimes tel me) he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
me to be here at eleven. I might have brought him to your hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o
have <U+017F>pared you the Pains to come hither; but the mo<U+017F>t part of things he makes
u<U+017F>e of in his operations are not portable. I told him, 'twere better have a little
patience, <U+017F>ince he would not <U+017F>tay long, and that I was loath to lo<U+017F>e my labour.
An houre being <U+017F>pent in the<U+017F>e fine <U+017F>tories, the Souldier told me at la<U+017F>t that he
thought it be<U+017F>t to go look for his friend, and thereupon he left me. I was
<U+017F>ometimes of opinion it was <U+017F>ome <U+017F>waggerer, and that he was now gone to fetch
his Comrades to rob me; yet would I not be gone, as being better re<U+017F>olv'd,
though I had brought no Lacquay with me, becau<U+017F>e I would not have any body
know whither I went. Nothing troubled me <U+017F>o much as hunger, which now
began to make its approaches, being as then fa<U+017F>ting; otherwi<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould have
thought it no hard task to wait till night, <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous was I to <U+017F>ee a Magician.
I asked the Ma<U+017F>ter of the hou<U+017F>e whether he had din'd, who having an<U+017F>wered me
that he had broke his fa<U+017F>t <U+017F>o well that he would eat nothing till night: I told
him plainly the ca<U+017F>e was not the <U+017F>ame with me, and that I <U+017F>hould take it well if
<U+017F>omewhat were brought me. I had no other money about me but a piece of
gold, which I gave him to provide <U+017F>omewhat but he <U+017F>taid <U+017F>o long that I thought
he had been run away with my money, and left me ma<U+017F>ter of his hou<U+017F>hold-<U+017F>tuff;
for all that was in the hou<U+017F>e was not worth it. At la<U+017F>t he returns with bread
only, and went out again to get <U+017F>omewhat el<U+017F>e. Being not able to eat <U+017F>o much
bread without drinking, I gave a good deal of it to a dog that barked at me as if
I had been <U+017F>ome thief. When I had appea<U+017F>ed him there came a beggar to the
dore, who was <U+017F>o important for an alms, that I gave him all my provi<U+017F>ion to be
quiet. The dog it <U+017F>eems envied at that, and began to quarrel with me afre<U+017F>h.
Seeing that his ma<U+017F>ter came not, I had a mind to go to the dore to <U+017F>ee if he
were not coming at the <U+017F>treets end, but I was afraid <U+017F>ome of my acquaintance
might pa<U+017F>s by, and would haply have been frighted to <U+017F>ee me in <U+017F>uch a place.
About half an hour after mine ho<U+017F>t returns with a bottle of wine, and a little
piece of beef half roa<U+017F>ted. When he had given me the re<U+017F>t of my money, I
gave him to fetch more bread, and <U+017F>o I eat and drank. Upon this, he tels me
that he knew not what he thought on all the time that he kept me in a low room
<U+017F>o ill furni<U+017F>hed, <U+017F>ince he had the key of an upper Chamber which was <U+017F>omewhat
better. He pre<U+017F>ently brought me up to that Chamber, which was hung with
<U+017F>trip <U+017F>tuff, and had a pretty little bed; but it was <U+017F>ome wonder to me not to
find any Books, nor Mathematical In<U+017F>truments, nor any other thing nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
to a knowing man. I pre<U+017F>ume of your pardon faire<U+017F>t <hi>Angelica,</hi> that I tell you
<U+017F>o many particulars: nor may you wonder that I relate to you things that are
plea<U+017F>ant, when I have mo<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e to be <U+017F>ad, becau<U+017F>e I force my humour to it
out of opinion it plea<U+017F>es you. Know then that mine ho<U+017F>t having left me all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in the Chamber; a little while after a young Gentlewoman comes up, and
askes me what I did there, and whether I had any thing to <U+017F>ay to her. I was
much amazed to <U+017F>ee her in<U+017F>tead of the Magician I expected; and I <U+017F>aid to my
<U+017F>elf, Does he whom I would <U+017F>peak with know my de<U+017F>igne already? Hath he not
been told that I intended to ask him what kind of woman I <U+017F>hould have? and
to <U+017F>atisfie me with the <U+017F>ight of her, hath he not <U+017F>ent this, who haply is one of his
wenches, <U+017F>o to make me believe that it is <U+017F>he I mu<U+017F>t fall in love with? Though
this came into my thought, yet I gave the Gentlewoman this an<U+017F>wer, That I was
brought thither to <U+017F>peak with one I had <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s with, but that I had been
abus'd. She replyed that <U+017F>he was very much beholding to that abu<U+017F>e which
got her my acquaintance; and thereupon fell upon <U+017F>ome very free talk, to
which I an<U+017F>wered with that mode<U+017F>ty which men ought to ob<U+017F>erve. At length,
being weary of tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>eeing the Souldier returned not, I took
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43725:158"/>
my leave of her. As <U+017F>he brought me down, <U+017F>he told me that if ever I <U+017F>hould
come and repo<U+017F>e my<U+017F>elf in her chamber, <U+017F>he would take it as a <U+017F>ignal favour.
Had it not been for the<U+017F>e words, I <U+017F>hould haply have <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected no ill, for <U+017F>he
di<U+017F>covered that gravity which is not <U+017F>o common among lewd ones; but on the
other <U+017F>ide, the place where <U+017F>he lived, and her Maid and Lacquey <U+017F>o ill accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated,
made me think the wor<U+017F>e of her. I returned home very <U+017F>ad at my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture;
and two days after, it hapned I met <hi>Alican</hi> in an Academy. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of acquaintance I told him of the Gentlewoman I had <U+017F>een; and he, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
univer<U+017F>ally acquainted, told me it was <hi>Claricia,</hi> and that <U+017F>he was well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cended,
but that <U+017F>uits at Law had <U+017F>o impoveri<U+017F>hed her, that it was generally
conceived, that to live in the hight and bravery <U+017F>he did, <U+017F>he <U+017F>old her favours to
any one; yet he believed it not, becau<U+017F>e he could never obtain any thing of
her in that way. He very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably <U+017F>ell into this flouri<U+017F>h of vanity. For I
afterwards took him into my Coach, and much again<U+017F>t my mind, he brought me
to this <hi>Claricia</hi>'s, telling me he would <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e her, and put her upon <U+017F>uch di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
as <U+017F>hould plea<U+017F>e me. I cannot deny, but that having found <hi>Claricia,</hi> I
was more <U+017F>atisfied with her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, then that of <hi>Alican,</hi> for it is the mo<U+017F>t
impertinent fellow in the world. He it was, de<U+017F>ired her company to a Race,
which obliged me to take her with us. And this is it he <U+017F>hould have told you.
Since that time I never had ought to do with <hi>Claricia.</hi> He made you believe
that I loved her, that you might hate me, that <U+017F>o nothing might hinder you to
affect him; for I doubt not but that was one of his principal de<U+017F>ignes. Had
he no other vices then Treachery and unfaithfullne<U+017F>s, I <U+017F>hould believe he might
yet be wrought to <U+017F>ome good; but <U+017F>ince he carries about him <U+017F>o many ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
I dare <U+017F>peak no more of him, le<U+017F>t you might think I would commend my
<U+017F>elf by blaming him. There's <hi>Montenor,</hi> who can give you a better account

                        <p>HE whom you mention, <U+017F>aid <hi>Montenor,</hi> is the <U+017F>on of a Gentleman who was
extreamly rich, but withall the mo<U+017F>t covetous that ever was. In the time
of his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s which was his la<U+017F>t, he was advi<U+017F>ed to change the air; he an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he would willingly go to his Country-hou<U+017F>e, but conditionally, that his two
be<U+017F>t friends were carried along with him. They <U+017F>hall not fail to be there, <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>ome about him; there were none but thought he being at the point of death,
otherwi<U+017F>e then the two be<U+017F>t friends he talked of, were his Phy<U+017F>ician and his
Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or, which were they he had mo<U+017F>t need of: but when the time to depart
was come, he made it appear that by tho<U+017F>e two good friends, he meant two
<U+017F>trong Che<U+017F>ts wherein he put all his money. When it was <U+017F>aid to him that he
was to blame to <U+017F>uffer his thoughts to be carried away to dotage on his wealth:
he an<U+017F>wered that they were indeed his be<U+017F>t friends, <U+017F>ince they a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted him at all
times, procuring him whatever he de<U+017F>ired, and that there were few in the world
that loved him but for their <U+017F>akes. Some of the kindred being unwilling that
<U+017F>o much money <U+017F>hould be carried from the hou<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e of what ill accident
might happen. The <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on continued <U+017F>till in the City, and upon that a
very remarkable thing fell out: Though his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s was in the extremity, yet
would he him<U+017F>elf keep an account of all was <U+017F>pent, le<U+017F>t his <U+017F>on, and <U+017F>ervants
might deceive him. So that he had in the bed with him a great bag of money
whereon he <U+017F>till lean'd his arm as if it had been a pillow, and when there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43725:159"/>
any thing towards the hou<U+017F>e, he him<U+017F>elf gave what to buy it withall. One
day it came into his mind to go to his <U+017F>tudy, to <U+017F>ee if his two Che<U+017F>ts were as they
<U+017F>hould be; and though he were very <U+017F>ick, yet mu<U+017F>t he be carried to the place
where he de<U+017F>ired. Having with much adoe opened one of his Coffers, and
kneeling on a pillow for to contemplate his Trea<U+017F>ure, at his ea<U+017F>e, he died <U+017F>udden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
The dead <U+017F>hould not be cen<U+017F>ured, yet it may be <U+017F>aid he died in a mo<U+017F>t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
po<U+017F>ture, as if he were then adoring his money. God <U+017F>uffered him to
come to that unhappy end for an example to others; and 'tis an article of my
faith, that it is no <U+017F>in to divulge the <U+017F>ins of <U+017F>uch, to induce people to live better.
<hi>Alican</hi> being left <U+017F>ole heir, makes it <U+017F>ufficiently appear that it is not the will of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Ju<U+017F>tice that <U+017F>o great riches <U+017F>hould remain in that Family, for he is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
as his father was covetous, and he is his greate<U+017F>t friend that can be<U+017F>t fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h
him with inventions of expence. Yet having once lent me a piece in a
Church to be<U+017F>tow in <U+017F>ome charitable way, which I could not then avoid, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meets me but he fanta<U+017F>tically demands it, telling me that I <U+017F>hall not be<U+017F>tow
alms at his charge. My an<U+017F>wer to him ever is, That I not pay him till he
hath con<U+017F>umed all, becau<U+017F>e then a piece will be more to him then a thou<U+017F>and
now, and he will thank me for having kept it <U+017F>o long. He taketh all this in je<U+017F>t,
but I <U+017F>peak it in good earne<U+017F>t; for I believe he will <U+017F>oon find the end of his
riches, according to the rate he lives at. If he lo<U+017F>es any money at play, he'll
ca<U+017F>t what he hath left out at the windows, and for that the lacqueys only are
obliged to him. He never bargains for any thing he buyes, becau<U+017F>e he hath
that e<U+017F>teem of him<U+017F>elf, that he would think it a di<U+017F>paragement unto him, if he
<U+017F>hould conte<U+017F>t with the populacy. As for his follies, they are incomparable,
and <U+017F>o remarkable that all that meet him, though they know him not, yet think
him not free from extravagance. There's ever <U+017F>omewhat extraordinary in his
clothes, either for fa<U+017F>hion, or colours, not to mention his affectations of <U+017F>uch and
<U+017F>uch garments. Sometimes he will needs make people believe he hath been let
bloud, or hath been wounded in his arm, only to take occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>hew a fine
Scarf he got at the Fair. He wears Pendants at his ears of all fa<U+017F>hions: he hath
<U+017F>ome little golden Cro<U+017F>s, or <U+017F>ome other trinket at the end of his mu<U+017F>tachoe. He
hath ever <U+017F>ome bracelet in <U+017F>ight, and <U+017F>ome Fancy in his hat, to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he is in favour with <U+017F>ome Lady. He hath al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome Knots or other at the
welts of his <U+017F>hoes, when he is in <U+017F>ilk <U+017F>tockins. To be <U+017F>hort, if he be con<U+017F>idered
all about, it will be found there will not be one piece of him which hath not
<U+017F>omewhat different from what's in others. Be<U+017F>ides all this, if it happen <U+017F>ome
morning that a Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s looks not graciou<U+017F>ly on him, he thinks his clothes are in
the fault, as wanting <U+017F>omewhat to charm her; and this makes him put on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>uit in the afternoon to recover her favour. This makes him <U+017F>o infinitely
curious in his apparel, that when he is to enter into a fa<U+017F>hion, he <U+017F>ends for four
Ma<U+017F>ter-Tailors into con<U+017F>ultation, as if 'twere four able Councellers to have
their judgement in a Ca<U+017F>e, and he gives them money for their opinion, for his
<U+017F>ummer fa<U+017F>hion or his winter fa<U+017F>hion, and to know which are the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>umptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Modes. Nor mu<U+017F>t the Lacqueys but <U+017F>mell <U+017F>omewhat of the extravagance
of him they <U+017F>erve, and make <hi>Alican</hi>'s folly apparent. Sometimes their skirts are
pointed, <U+017F>ometimes like <U+017F>cales: If one year they weare Coats with <U+017F>leeves, the
next they are in Cloaks after the Spani<U+017F>h mode. Their Liveries <U+017F>ometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts
of <U+017F>everal pieces of divers colours, like Jackpuddings, or el<U+017F>e cro<U+017F>s laced with
Galoom, into Characters and Love-knots, <U+017F>o that any one would <U+017F>ay they wore
the Livery of Folly, rather then that of their Ma<U+017F>ters Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s. I do not blame
this as being an enemy to hand<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s, and fa<U+017F>hions, for I love to <U+017F>ee Gentlemen
and their attendance well clad, <U+017F>o the ordinary decent mode be ob<U+017F>erved; but
<hi>Alican,</hi> as I tell you, is not content to clothe his <U+017F>ervants fanta<U+017F>tically, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
do, but he will be <U+017F>o him<U+017F>elf, that the relation may be <U+017F>een, and that it
might not be thought his <U+017F>ervants are borrowed. But there are yet greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences.
One day he would needs have a gla<U+017F>s in the Crown of his hat, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43725:159"/>
<U+017F>ee ever and anon if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e courted the Ladies hand<U+017F>omly. It can hardly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
what trouble he puts his Cloak and that to, by cocking and tru<U+017F><U+017F>ing them
as he does, and I think he doth it only to <U+017F>hew he hath now nothing but what's
new; whereas in his fathers time, all he had came from the brokery, <U+017F>o that
all was <U+017F>o mellow that it could hardly be touched. Being one day at a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
he would needs <U+017F>alute a Gentlewoman that was going in, though he
knew her not for his gallantry was already very remarkable) putting on his
hat in a fury, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not be <U+017F>aluted, he unawares pulled the brim <U+017F>o
hard, that he tore it, and drew it down over his no<U+017F>e, as if it had been the vi<U+017F>or
of a headpiece. That hapned before a many people to his great di<U+017F>grace, and
all his revenge was to <U+017F>wear he would be the death of the Haberda<U+017F>her had <U+017F>old
it him. But now he redeems the time wherein he was <U+017F>o ill accoutred, and
I believe he wi<U+017F>hed him<U+017F>elf in this po<U+017F>ture long ere he came to it, and that he
would not have given any thing to <U+017F>ave his fathers life. His chiefe<U+017F>t diver<U+017F>ions
were to go into Churches and Walks to <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf: Sometimes he takes a
great delight to drive a Coach about <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                           </hi> and thinks he hath done a great act,
though the humour be <U+017F>tale enough. If he keep home, he is <U+017F>o idle that he
knows not what reading or any <U+017F>uch thing means, and can find him<U+017F>elf no other
imployment then to <U+017F>tand at the window and <U+017F>hoot peas through a Trunk at
tho<U+017F>e that pa<U+017F>s by or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch diver<U+017F>ion, for which he is beholding to his Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quays.
Yet I <U+017F>hould forgive him this did he but come off hand<U+017F>omly with his
<U+017F>implicities; but when he hath abu<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome hone<U+017F>t Trade<U+017F>men who have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
him as he de<U+017F>erves, he hath no other name to call them by but Citizens.
As for his ordinary di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>, 'tis as <U+017F>imple as can be imagined; he'll be ever telling
you how many pieces he lo<U+017F>t or got at play, and what rare de<U+017F>ignes he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Cloathes, whereof he will <U+017F>hew you draughts in paper, as if they were
<U+017F>ome de<U+017F>ignes of Architecture. I think I have told you enough to know him
by, and you may ea<U+017F>iy judge that there cannot be an action of this man that
<U+017F>peaks not <U+017F>omewhat of his folly. I am weary to entertain you <U+017F>o long on <U+017F>o

               <hi>Angelica</hi> hearkned very attentively to <hi>Montenors</hi> di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and thought in
her <U+017F>elf that it had been well her mother had heard it, that <U+017F>he might have known
what kind of per<U+017F>on <hi>Alican</hi> was; for <U+017F>he imagined that <hi>Leonora</hi> had a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of him, and would have been content he were her <U+017F>on in law. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<U+017F>he <U+017F>aid not a word, obliged her to <U+017F>peak by this que<U+017F>tion: Well what
<U+017F>ay you now of this illu<U+017F>trious (ourtier? Will you hereafter believe a man that
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es him<U+017F>elf every day as well in his words as in his cloathes? Truely, replies
<hi>Angelica,</hi> I can only tell you, that <hi>Claricia</hi> would be excellently well for his turn,
and that he ought to marry her. I am of your opinion, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, for my part, I <U+017F>hall give him no occa<U+017F>ion to be jealous.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, and <hi>Montenor</hi> being returned to the Cards, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> put
<hi>Angelica</hi> <U+017F>o hard to it, that <U+017F>he openly confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that <U+017F>he thought him not <U+017F>o
poorly minded, as that he did ever affect <hi>Claricia;</hi> who though <U+017F>he was very
hand<U+017F>ome, yet had the reputation of <U+017F>ome lightne<U+017F>s: and as for <hi>Alican,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>oon
di<U+017F>covered how little <U+017F>he e<U+017F>teemed him. 'Twas then that <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> rea<U+017F><U+017F>umed his
good hopes, and <hi>Angelica</hi> who truly loved him, could no longer u<U+017F>e her ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations. She favoured him <U+017F>o far, that when he de<U+017F>ired to wait her in
private to entertain her with his affection, <U+017F>he a<U+017F><U+017F>igned him the next day at night,
but told him, <U+017F>he was not yet re<U+017F>olv'd of the place; this promi<U+017F>e <U+017F>atisfied him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly.
He thank'd her the be<U+017F>t he could, but contracted his complements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
he thought he was di<U+017F>covered by all, and that there came <U+017F>till <U+017F>ome one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them to hear what they <U+017F>aid. As for his part he was <U+017F>o cunning as to <U+017F>peak
aloud then, and that of <U+017F>ome indifferent matter, that it might be thought the
re<U+017F>t of his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was of the <U+017F>ame.</p>
            <p>When the Gam<U+017F>ters had given over, he returned with <hi>Montenor,</hi> though <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontes</hi>
had entreated them both to lodge at his hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Hircan, Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43725:160"/>
of that gang returned al<U+017F>o to their home. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elf not to
find <hi>Carmelin</hi> there, and which was wor<U+017F>e, no body could tell any news of him:
He had been <U+017F>een to go out of the Ca<U+017F>tle, but it was thought only to walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about;
and in the mean time he was not come to <U+017F>upper to <hi>Hircans. Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was
extreamly afflicted at this lo<U+017F>s; he knew not what to do to find the faithfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of his travels. To go into the Gardens was to no purpo<U+017F>e, there was no
likelyhood he <U+017F>hould be there; and as for going into the fields, what could have
been done in the dark? His recour<U+017F>e therefore was to complain, which he did in
this manner. Ala<U+017F>s! my faithfull <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>hall I not know for what cau<U+017F>e
thou ha<U+017F>t left me? I never threatned to beat thee, I have not dealt roughly with
thee, or if I have, it hath been only in je<U+017F>t. When thou de<U+017F>ired<U+017F>t to participate
in the glory of my Prowe<U+017F><U+017F>es, I have been content, and I have permitted thee to
be crowned with Lawrel as well as my <U+017F>elf. Wherein then have I offended thee,
thou who wert the <U+017F>econd per<U+017F>on in my e<U+017F>teem next my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s? Had<U+017F>t thou
<U+017F>taid with me, of a hireling as thou wert, I would have made of thee an <hi>Illu<U+017F>trious
Shepherd,</hi> for 'tis not a Warrier who hath gotten a victory <U+017F>hould be ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ru<U+017F>ticks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having ended this complaint, was forced to go to bed as well as the re<U+017F>t:
and while he is a<U+017F>leep, I will tell you if you plea<U+017F>e to give me leave, what became
of <hi>Carmelin.</hi> His Ma<U+017F>ter being gone with the re<U+017F>t a hunting, his thoughts ran
on <hi>Li<U+017F>etta,</hi> whom he could not forget, though his Ma<U+017F>ter commanded him to
love no other then <hi>Parthenice.</hi> Having asked one of the <U+017F>ervants where <U+017F>he was,
he an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>he was gone with her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who was the fair Lady he
might have <U+017F>een awhile before in the Ca<U+017F>tle. He knew well enough that they
<U+017F>poke of the Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> and becau<U+017F>e he thought him<U+017F>elf much in her
favour, he re<U+017F>olved to give her a vi<U+017F>it, and by that means to <U+017F>ee his love. The
<U+017F>ame <U+017F>ervant told him that <U+017F>he lived about three miles from the Ca<U+017F>tle, and gave
him the be<U+017F>t directions he could to find the hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Carmelin</hi> very joyfully left
the fellow, and being gone out from <hi>Hircans</hi> as nothing were, he walked <U+017F>oftly
awhile, but at la<U+017F>t he began to run as fa<U+017F>t as if his Ma<U+017F>ter had already been in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uit
of him, till he was gotten out of <U+017F>ight of his ordinary Lodging. He met by
the way with <U+017F>ome Country people, who directed him <U+017F>o well that he <U+017F>oon came
to <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s as <U+017F>he was in the Hall with five or <U+017F>ix Gentlewomen of the <U+017F>ame
Village. What good wind hath blown you hither? courteous <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he to him, I did not think this day to be <U+017F>o happy as to have <U+017F>een you: what
good prayer have I <U+017F>aid this morning that hath brought this ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing on me?
If I could remember it, I would <U+017F>ay it every day, that my felicity might <U+017F>till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.
Tell me I pray, how does the Prince of the Shepherds of <hi>France?</hi> What
hath he done <U+017F>ince I have <U+017F>een him? Do you come hither expre<U+017F>ly from him to
give me an account? I come hither from no man but my <U+017F>elf, replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
and con<U+017F>equently you are the more obliged to me. As for the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
I left him very well, and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you that we have done <U+017F>uch rare things <U+017F>ince your
departure, that they can hardly be related to the full. You mu<U+017F>t needs tell us
the whole <U+017F>tory, replyes <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> were it only to honour my good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
here, who que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F>s will be extreamly taken with the relation.</p>
            <p>She had already related a many of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s adventures to the Gentlewomen,
who knowing immediately that this was the <U+017F>ervant of that illu<U+017F>trious Shepherd,
they all <U+017F>et upon and about him, to conjure him to tell what he knew had hapned
to his Ma<U+017F>ter, whom they did <U+017F>o highly e<U+017F>teem. <hi>Carmelin</hi> who was not made
of iron or wood, <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf entreated by <U+017F>o many fair ones, thought he could
do no le<U+017F>s then <U+017F>atisfie them, <U+017F>o that having by the command of <hi>Amaryllis</hi> taken
a <U+017F>eat, he began to <U+017F>peak in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ladies, Gentlewomen, Nymphs, Hamadryads, Nayads,</hi> or fair <hi>Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi>
(I know not how to call you, <U+017F>uch a confu<U+017F>ion hath the Ma<U+017F>ter I now <U+017F>erve made
in my former Learning, by forcing me to new principles.) <hi>It being then <U+017F>o,</hi> that it
is your de<U+017F>ire to know <U+017F>ome incomparable adventures of the Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> 'tis
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43725:160"/>
not without <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on that I make u<U+017F>e of this expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, for I have been told
that a famous Author began thus all his Chapters. <hi>It being then <U+017F>o,</hi> that it is
your de<U+017F>ire to know tho<U+017F>e noble and plea<U+017F>ant adventures, I am fir<U+017F>t to tell you
of <hi>Meliantes,</hi> who is a Sepherd, as he <U+017F>aies, of that Country, which, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
is <U+017F>omewhat near tho<U+017F>e people, who wear great Balls of Linnen about
their heads. 'Tis <hi>Per<U+017F>ia,</hi> now I have hit it. To bring it into my mind, I was
fain to think on a peece of wine that a while <U+017F>ince was pierced before me, for I pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize
Artificial Memory. Now though this <hi>Meliantes</hi> <U+017F>aies he is that Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he <U+017F>peaks as good French as you or I and his no<U+017F>e and eyes are made alike,
and of the <U+017F>ame colour as ours. He <U+017F>aid then that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e name I
cannot remember, unle<U+017F>s I hear it, was <U+017F>tollen away by two Gyants, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oned
in a Ca<U+017F>tle, whence it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary my Ma<U+017F>ter <U+017F>hould redeem her. As
for my part, <hi>Hircan</hi> engaged me al<U+017F>o in the de<U+017F>igne; and becau<U+017F>e my Ma<U+017F>ter nor
I could not pretend to any great <U+017F>ouldiery, and that in matter of War, we were
more likely to retreat then advance, he promi<U+017F>ed to make our bodies <U+017F>o hard, that
<U+017F>words <U+017F>hould not hurt them. This <hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>aies he is a Magician, and I believe
he may be one, for certainly he is a gallant man, as to that point. He doth no
more at his hou<U+017F>e then <U+017F>ay, Lacquay lay the cloath, and pre<U+017F>ently you find the
Table excellently well furni<U+017F>hed. He might as well therefore make us as valiant
as he <U+017F>aid. My Ma<U+017F>ter put on a habit which they tearm an <hi>Heroical</hi> habit: and
for my part, I was armed <hi>cap à pee;</hi> but it was <U+017F>uch an encumbrance to me, that if
my no<U+017F>e had dropped, I mu<U+017F>t have de<U+017F>ired my Ma<U+017F>ter to wipe it. After a great
many ceremonies we were put into a Coach which at fir<U+017F>t went by land, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
through the air, as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>aid, but for my part I could perceive no <U+017F>uch
thing. I <U+017F>lept in the place where I <U+017F>ate, and my Ma<U+017F>ter having done the like, he
dreamed that a Magician drew us out of the Coach, and that he made us eat on a
marble Table. You are to conceive that was only to cool the broath; that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
us to <U+017F>ee birds that were Gardeners, men that were as clear as gla<U+017F>s, and a
furnace wherein we were burnt, and then that having rai<U+017F>ed a great hall in the
Wilderne<U+017F>s, he made <U+017F>ervants come out of the hangings, and bring us <U+017F>omewhat
for collation, and that I drunk and eat as much as <U+017F>ix men. I maintain'd again<U+017F>t
him that there was never any <U+017F>uch thing, and that my guts cryed vengeance on
this dream. This made him <U+017F>omewhat angry, but he is <U+017F>ince appea<U+017F>ed. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
then to our adventure, 'tis true that an ancient grave man having awaken me,
drew me out of the Coach with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and that through ob<U+017F>cure waies, we came
at la<U+017F>t to a great Cellar where we fought with Mon<U+017F>ters. To tell you what
blowes we gave, and what we received, is more then I can do, for I had not the
lea<U+017F>ure to count them, <U+017F>o was I amazed. 'Tis true, I was not <U+017F>o much out of
my <U+017F>elf, as if I had <U+017F>een my bloud running out of my body, for had that hapned,
I think I <U+017F>hould have been no longer for this world, and <U+017F>hould have died for
fear, though my wounds were no more dangerous then <U+017F>cratches: and this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would have hapned, had our enemies had any fire-arms, for if they had had any
muskets or Canons, the very report would have carried away my wits. But we
were <U+017F>o fortunate as to overcome our adver<U+017F>aries, and over and above killed a
Dragon. I mu<U+017F>t indeed confe<U+017F>s it was not very terrible, for it <U+017F>tirred not from
the <U+017F>ame place, and there came out no fire at his throat; yet my Ma<U+017F>ter was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of it and thought it a great glory to have overthrown it. After this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
we delivered <hi>Meliantes</hi>'s Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s out of pri<U+017F>on, and returned with her into
the Coach. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> related all this this morning to <hi>Hircan,</hi> and then it was he and I
had <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>pute about his fond imaginations: but to tell you the troth, after
<U+017F>uch travel undergone, where it was my hope we <U+017F>hould have been made rich
men, there was only be<U+017F>tow'd on each of us a Crown of Lawrel. Here's mine,
which I <U+017F>till wear in<U+017F>tead of a hatband. Nay they would have had me lo<U+017F>e my
at by the bargain, for I had much adoe to get it. The prai<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
would by that time have co<U+017F>t me dear enough. I am now at length <U+017F>uch as
you <U+017F>ee me, and <U+017F>uch as I am, having learned out <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e I am come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43725:161"/>
while my Ma<U+017F>ter is gone a hunting with all the re<U+017F>t of the company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having thus fini<U+017F>hed his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which had plea<U+017F>ed the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
very well, <hi>Amaryllis</hi> told him, that if it were true, that he came purpo<U+017F>ely
to her hou<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ee her, <U+017F>he was extreamly obliged to him, but that <U+017F>he imagined
he was come rather to <U+017F>ee the Nymph <hi>Li<U+017F>etta,</hi> whom <U+017F>he had entertained for her
<U+017F>ervant. The an<U+017F>wer to this was a <U+017F>mile a very unhand<U+017F>ome one, and <hi>Amaryllis</hi>
continuing her <U+017F>peech, asked him whether he did not firmly believe that <hi>Li<U+017F>etta</hi>
had been an <hi>Hamadryad.</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs believe it <U+017F>ince all the world <U+017F>aies <U+017F>o, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
he. I am made believe that I have not <U+017F>o much judgement as others, and
that I do not <U+017F>ee things as they are, <U+017F>o that though my own rea<U+017F>on per<U+017F>wades me
to any thing it apprehends, yet mu<U+017F>t I not be <U+017F>uffered to give it any credit. I
have often <U+017F>een <U+017F>carecrows of wood, but I know not what the other means, nor
ever <U+017F>hall till I have read my Ma<U+017F>ters Books. Not to lie for the matter, his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
are extreamly trouble<U+017F>ome, and were it not that he is of a quiet di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition,
I had left him ere this. 'Tis true, there is <U+017F>ome plea<U+017F>ure in his company,
for if <U+017F>ometimes I have fared hardly, <U+017F>ince he came to <hi>Hircans</hi> I live like a little
Prince. What a miracle was that Fea<U+017F>t whereat <hi>Orontes</hi> entertained us the other
day? I made one there, and remembring I had read in a certain book, that <hi>red</hi>
is the colour of <hi>Vertue,</hi> I drank as much Wine as I could for to paint my no<U+017F>e and
my cheeks. I <U+017F>ee then, <U+017F>aies <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> that of all the Gods your Ma<U+017F>ter hath
quoted to you, there's none you honour more then <hi>Bacchus.</hi> If you plea<U+017F>e,
though we drink not much Wine, you <U+017F>hall keep his Fea<U+017F>t to morrow with us. I
am to cut down a little Vinyard I have in my Clo<U+017F>e. <hi>Carmelin</hi> upon this betook
him to his con<U+017F>iderations, <U+017F>aying, that if he returned not, his Ma<U+017F>ter would be
much troubled for him: But <hi>Amaryllis</hi> told him <U+017F>he would excu<U+017F>e him, <U+017F>o that
he pre<U+017F>ently re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay. There were only two Gentlewomen <U+017F>taid <U+017F>upper
there, the re<U+017F>t went to their homes; but at night they came again to pa<U+017F>s away
the time with their neighbour. They danced and <U+017F>ung together, and <hi>Carmelin</hi>
with his <hi>Li<U+017F>etta</hi> were taken in. When it grew late they a<U+017F><U+017F>igned him a bed, and
the re<U+017F>t retired.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Amaryllis</hi> <U+017F>et the Gatherers on work, and was very plea<U+017F>ant
with them, and <U+017F>omwhat the more becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had <hi>Carmelins</hi> good company, who
with her a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, <U+017F>tarted out a mo<U+017F>t heroical de<U+017F>igne.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> to whom it is time to return, ro<U+017F>e in very much di<U+017F>quiet, not
thinking it was yet time to leave off his Heroical accoutrements, though he had
promi<U+017F>ed the day before not to be in them any longer. He bethought him<U+017F>elf
that <hi>Charite</hi> had not yet <U+017F>een him in that bravery, and that <U+017F>he had not appeared
at all at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s. He therefore made a vow not to quit his Coat of Male till he
<U+017F>hould meet that fair Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of his. He <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o to all he met, to prevent the
wonder they might be in not to find him clad as a Shepherd. Every one appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his re<U+017F>olution, he dined very quietly, though he <U+017F>till <U+017F>eemed to have <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to <U+017F>ay, either as to the <U+017F>trange and unfamiliar humour of <hi>Charite,</hi> who hid
her <U+017F>elf from him a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him, or as to the lo<U+017F>s of <hi>Carmelin.</hi> As
for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, he was promi<U+017F>ed a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>ight of her; and for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> they
told him that they had <U+017F>ent to <U+017F>eek him.</p>
            <p>About two or three in the afternoon, <hi>Hircan</hi> and the re<U+017F>t being gone abroad
for <U+017F>ome recreation, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> perceived in the highway a great du<U+017F>t, and having
looked a long time that way, he imagined there had been a great train of hor<U+017F>es
and Carts. Are they not the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ian</hi> Shepherds that are now come? cries he
out. There comes the baggage.</p>
            <p>Every one looked that way, and they di<U+017F>covered a Wagon, and a Coach after
it, with a many people afoot. As this Pageant came nearer and nearer, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Waggon a man <U+017F>itting a<U+017F>tride a Barrel, and it was <U+017F>oon known to be
the courteous <hi>Carmelin.</hi> He had on a white pair of drawers and a white wa<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,
a skarf of vine-leaves, a Crown of Ivy, and a Cup in his hand, <U+017F>o that he
<U+017F>eemed to be very plea<U+017F>ant to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf repre<U+017F>ent the Father of Good-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43725:161"/>
There was a deal of boughes all about the Waggon, and two <U+017F>turdy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
fellows that led it, were al<U+017F>o crowned with vine-branches. Eight women ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
went before, with their Paniers and pruning Hooks, and the two Basket-carriers
followed them. An old man who yet had a plea<U+017F>ant countenance, rid
on an A<U+017F>s after the Waggon, to repre<U+017F>ent <hi>Silenus. Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>ung a drinking
Song, to which all the re<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wered. Being come upto the company of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
he cau<U+017F>ed the Waggon to be <U+017F>taid to begin another Song, of the be<U+017F>t he
had and that done, he was pre<U+017F>ented with <U+017F>ome Wine which he took off. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Amaryllis</hi> and her neighbours, who were all in Petticoats, came out of the
Coach, having each of them a basket of <U+017F>mall Ozier under their arms, and little
guilt hooks in their hands; and <hi>Amaryllis</hi> advancing the foremo<U+017F>t, made towards
<hi>Hircan,</hi> to whom <U+017F>he made a low courte<U+017F>y, <U+017F>aying to him, Learned Magician, I
am come hither, <U+017F>ent by <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to make you this <U+017F>mall pre<U+017F>ent, which you will
accept when you con<U+017F>ider it comes from that God who is more powerfull then
all the re<U+017F>t. 'Tis he that cau<U+017F>es and continues our mirth; 'tis he makes <U+017F>ervants
<U+017F>peak confidently to their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and 'tis he that makes the Souldier
couragious, though he were naturally a coward. If you adore him
with a con<U+017F>tant minde, he will alwayes pre<U+017F>erve your vines from the fro<U+017F>ts,
and will <U+017F>end you <U+017F>uch <U+017F>tore of Wine, that it <U+017F>hall be as cheap as the water of
<hi>Morin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amaryllis</hi> having <U+017F>aid the<U+017F>e words, <hi>Hircan</hi> took from her a basket of Grapes,
which <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ented to him, and thus he returned her his thanks. Faire<U+017F>t Nymph
<U+017F>ayes he to her, I chearfully receive this pre<U+017F>ent both for the God <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s <U+017F>ake,
and hers that brings it me from him. And if you tell me that he whom you
adore is <U+017F>o powerfull that it makes Lovers <U+017F>peak without fear, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you I have
much need to acknowledge him, to the end I may freely di<U+017F>cover to my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
the afflictions I am in for her <U+017F>ake. <hi>Amaryllis</hi> knew well enough what he aimed
at, yet made no reply, to give way to another Nymph, who addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> Incomparable Shepherd, the glory and Ornament of <hi>France,
Bacchus</hi> having been acquainted with thy merit, would not be the la<U+017F>t to vi<U+017F>it
thee. He knows that the <hi>Aquatick</hi> Gods, the <hi>Hamadriads</hi> and the <hi>Nayads</hi>
have conver<U+017F>ed with thee, and therefore he <U+017F>hould have thought him<U+017F>elf unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
<U+017F>hould he not have the honour to <U+017F>ee thee. In te<U+017F>timony of the re<U+017F>pect he
acknowledges due to thee, he <U+017F>ends thee by me this basket of <hi>Grapes,</hi> with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
of <U+017F>ome of his new Wine when it is pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; in the mean time, accept this
pre<U+017F>ent. Thou art al<U+017F>o to know that I have <U+017F>upplanted my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters to obtain this
my Amba<U+017F><U+017F>age to thee, for having all left our Country to come and <U+017F>ee thee, 'twas
no mean contention for the honour to <U+017F>peak to thee fir<U+017F>t. Fair Nymph, replies
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I know not in what words to thank your <hi>Bacchus</hi> for all his favours; for
how can I <U+017F>atisfie a God, <U+017F>ince I do not think my <U+017F>elf in a capacity to recompence
you, who are but his Waiters, or his Prie<U+017F>te<U+017F><U+017F>es? However, be plea<U+017F>ed to receive
my good will, and excu<U+017F>e my performances.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, one of the Country fellows that led the Waggon, came
and brought a bottle of <U+017F>weet Wine for the Company, without any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
then <U+017F>aying, Behold what <hi>Bacchus</hi> hath <U+017F>ent you. He had but little to
<U+017F>ay, and yet he delivered it <U+017F>o unhand<U+017F>omly, that all the company laught at it.
That hindred not the Ladies from getting into the Coach again and follow <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
his Chariot, which began to put forward with all the Brigade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t taken at this <U+017F>ight, and had he not heard all conclude it
was <hi>Carmelin</hi> that rid in the Waggon, he would have thought it had been <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
him<U+017F>elf, according to the fir<U+017F>t imagination he conceived of things, which
was that of taking all fictions for truths. <hi>Carmelin</hi> indeed was well enough made
for a <hi>Bacchus,</hi> <U+017F>ave that he had a little too much beard, for his no<U+017F>e was as red as
a ro<U+017F>e, and his cheeks were no le<U+017F>s. Nor did his Ma<U+017F>ter think him ill accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated,
which made him <U+017F>ay, This is indeed an excellent piece of Gallantry. See
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43725:162"/>
how <hi>Carmelin</hi> is become a brave per<U+017F>on, I am afraid he'll go beyond me. Con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how knowing he is in matter of <hi>Metamorphe<U+017F>is</hi> and the <hi>Divinities</hi> I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
of belief he hath been changed into that God which makes the Vine flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>h.
If it have been for <U+017F>o excellent a de<U+017F>igne as this, that he hath been ab<U+017F>ent
this la<U+017F>t night, I confe<U+017F>s he hath had rea<U+017F>on to do <U+017F>o.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>poke thus, all the equipage of the God <hi>Bacchus</hi> went in at <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>'s,
the great Gate being opened to let in the Waggon. The noi<U+017F>e which the
Gatherers made with their <U+017F>inging, made <hi>Angelica</hi> look out at the window. As
<U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he perceiv'd this great pomp, <U+017F>he gave notice to her mother and her aunt,
who with <hi>Orontes</hi> came pre<U+017F>ently down, and thereupon <hi>Amaryllis</hi> and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
pre<U+017F>ented them with Grapes, as pre<U+017F>ents from the God. They gave
them al<U+017F>o <U+017F>weet Wine, for which they returned them infinite thanks, and <U+017F>poke
much in the prai<U+017F>e of <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> who they were beholding to for this conceited
invention. <hi>Amaryllis</hi> perceiving that <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> were plea<U+017F>ant enough
in their humours, quitted all her re<U+017F>ervedne<U+017F>s and gravity before them, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
among the Gatherers to <hi>Carmelins</hi> Songs.</p>
            <p>Awhile after their arrival, four Gentlemen, husbands and fathers to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen
that were with <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> being come another way on hor<U+017F>eback, came
and had their part of the Vintage-recreation. About the <U+017F>ame time <hi>Hircan, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is,</hi>
and the re<U+017F>t who came <U+017F>oftly after, entred the place, <U+017F>o that <hi>Orontes</hi> had by
that time a con<U+017F>iderable A<U+017F><U+017F>embly at his hou<U+017F>e. Have we not <U+017F>ome noble de<U+017F>igne
in hand? <U+017F>aies <hi>Amaryllis;</hi> I have this morning gathered all the Grapes in my
Clo<U+017F>e, there being not many Vines; and this afternoon I bring my Gatherers in
triumph. You make it appear that you have read the <hi>Dyoni<U+017F>iacks,</hi> <U+017F>ayes <hi>Orontes,</hi>
you are the mo<U+017F>t knowing Shepherde<U+017F>s that ever was. Yet there's <U+017F>omewhat
wanting in this triumph of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> you have neither <hi>Fawns</hi> nor <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
and they are ever of attendance to this God. The<U+017F>e women al<U+017F>o whom you
have brought with you, have been too mode<U+017F>t to be the Prie<U+017F>te<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Bacchus;</hi>
they <U+017F>hould have had the Javeline, a Timbrell, or Cymbals in their hands, and
they <U+017F>hould have danced mo<U+017F>t furiou<U+017F>ly and vehemently. Content your <U+017F>elf
with what is done, without thinking of reforming us, replies <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> all tho<U+017F>e
I brought with me are of my neighbourhood, where never were celebrated the
Fea<U+017F>ts of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> another time we'll do better.</p>
            <p>After this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Carmelin</hi> was taken down from his Chariot, and all the
company went into <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Hall, where was pre<U+017F>ented the Collation. Upon
that; <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> come in, they were <U+017F>oon told they were come
too late to <U+017F>ee the greate<U+017F>t piece of mirth in the world, and they de<U+017F>cribed to them
the preparation of the <hi>Bacchanals. Montenor</hi> was <U+017F>orry he had <U+017F>taid <U+017F>o long,
but <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> thought he was there <U+017F>oon enough, <U+017F>ince he found <hi>Angelica</hi> there.
When he was at any di<U+017F>tance from her, he <U+017F>poke to her by his amorous looks, and
made it appear how impertinently the Poets make Loves without eyes, for how
could one that were blind, teach us the u<U+017F>e and advantage of Looks?</p>
            <p>While this Lover was <U+017F>atisfied thus, <hi>Hircan,</hi> who knew that <hi>Amaryllis</hi> had not
undertaken this gallantry but for his <U+017F>ake, took it for <U+017F>uch an expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of her
affection, as plea<U+017F>ed him extreamly, <U+017F>o that it inflamed him more and more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, and his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es to her were the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant he could think on.
As for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who was not then <U+017F>o much taken up with his Loves, but he
could attend other things that pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves; he told <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that he
wondred not much he had left him, and that he conceived it was the affection he
bore <hi>Li<U+017F>etta,</hi> had forced him to that e<U+017F>cape. I am a con<U+017F>cientious man, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> 'tis true, I love that wench, yet I had no de<U+017F>igne to lodge at <hi>Amyril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>'s,
had I not been kept there. It <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>een what the Gods will decree upon
thy incon<U+017F>tancy, <U+017F>aies <hi>Li<U+017F>is;</hi> had<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>till loved the rock <hi>Parthenice,</hi> <U+017F>he might
haply have recovered her former <U+017F>hape, and con<U+017F>cious of the obligation, would
have be<U+017F>towed her <U+017F>elf on thee. But let's talk of <U+017F>omewhat el<U+017F>e, this plea<U+017F>es thee
not. Give notice to all that are here, that they hear me. Gentlemen and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43725:162"/>
cries out <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and you Gentlewomen and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, be plea<U+017F>ed
to hearken to my Ma<U+017F>ter.</p>
            <p>Gracious pre<U+017F>ence, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is!</hi> the Triumph of <hi>Bacchus</hi> puts me in mind, that
it were fit there <U+017F>hould be order taken I might ride in Triumph too. I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
<hi>Gyants</hi> and <hi>Mon<U+017F>ters,</hi> I have accompli<U+017F>hed an incomparable adventure;
'tis for this that I de<U+017F>ire to triumph, riding in a Warlike Chariot, in my Heroical
accoutrements, with my Crown of Lawrel on my head, as I now have it. This
Chariot <U+017F>hall be drawn by four white hor<U+017F>es; there <U+017F>hall Souldiers march order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before me, carrying Pictures, wherein <U+017F>hall be repre<U+017F>ented divers things: In
one <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>een the flying Hor<U+017F>es, in another the enchanted Ca<U+017F>tle, and <U+017F>o of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things that make up the Hi<U+017F>tory; but <U+017F>ince I cannot have tho<U+017F>e I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
neither dead nor alive, there <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>ome <U+017F>turdy ru<U+017F>ticks to repre<U+017F>ent
them, and <U+017F>hall be fa<U+017F>tned with iron Chains behind the Chariot, as if they were
my <U+017F>laves. There <U+017F>hall be the Conqueror <hi>Anarimander,</hi> the two Gyants, the
hulchback'd Souldiers, and after that <U+017F>hall come the Effigies of the Dragon.
Can it be thought that the <hi>Romans</hi> who were <U+017F>o great Captains, did not <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>hifts, and gave not money to poor people to be their
<U+017F>laves for one day, to make their triumph the more magnificent? Let this be put
off for a while, <U+017F>aies <hi>Philiris,</hi> till the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ian</hi> Shepherds are come. 'Tis well
advis'd, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> for there will be more to <U+017F>ee me, and my glory will be the
greater: I will have as much patience as can be expected.</p>
            <p>Tho<U+017F>e who had never <U+017F>een <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> before, and had only heard of him, found
him a more egregious fool then they imagined, and above all things wondred at
his extravagance in his cloaths. It hapned ju<U+017F>t then that he him<U+017F>elf took notice
of them <U+017F>o that he <U+017F>poke further thus; Now, <U+017F>aies he, that I am clad after the
<hi>Grecian</hi> mode, I think on all the <hi>Grecian</hi> <U+017F>ports. Their Olympick games were an
excellent diver<U+017F>ion. I <U+017F>hould wi<U+017F>h there were as well in this Country all <U+017F>orts of
Games, we <U+017F>hould renew the ancient Running, Wra<U+017F>tling, Leaping, and other
Recreations when I am fully e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed, I <U+017F>hall be<U+017F>tow <U+017F>ome thoughts that way.
Be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>ince it is my re<U+017F>olution to govern altogether according to the ancient
Cu<U+017F>toms; it <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>uffice to Crown the Conquerors, but there <U+017F>hall al<U+017F>o be
Odes <U+017F>ung in their, prai<U+017F>e, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ymns to the honour of the Gods. Now to doe
this there mu<U+017F>t be excellent Poets, which we cannot have if we have not <hi>Mu<U+017F>es</hi> to
<hi>in<U+017F>pire</hi> them; for the Poets di<U+017F>cover by their Invocations of tho<U+017F>e fair Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es
at the beginning of their Works, that their <U+017F>pirits langui<U+017F>h without their a<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance.
We <U+017F>hall therefore endeavour to have that Novenary Company, which
is no hard matter, <U+017F>ince all good Poets bring them over to their own Countries.
I think I have heard <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> went to Mount <hi>Parna<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> and brought
them away and planted them in the Province of <hi>Vando<U+017F>me,</hi> but that they returned
to their former habitation a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he died. Are not we able to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
hither again? We need only <U+017F>end <hi>Philiris,</hi> who, to divert him in his journy,
may have <hi>Carmelin</hi> with him: They are very fit for the de<U+017F>igne, for <hi>Philiris</hi> is
already as good in Ver<U+017F>e as Pro<U+017F>e; and as for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> he is al<U+017F>o a lettered man;
<U+017F>ometimes he <U+017F>peaks nothing but Sentences. You mu<U+017F>t take your journey one of
the<U+017F>e daies, my friends: the enterpri<U+017F>e will be to you reputation. Then <U+017F>hall
you be able to do miracles in <hi>Poetry,</hi> and the <U+017F>even Liberal Sciences; for the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es
you <U+017F>hall bring with you, will teach you all things: You <U+017F>hall take <U+017F>hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at <hi>Mar<U+017F>eilles.</hi> I do not believe the <hi>Mu<U+017F>es</hi> will come hither by Sea, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Philiris,</hi> they would be afraid le<U+017F>t all their Learning might be <U+017F>hipwrack'd. <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>

and this is it makes me believe it will be hard to make them keep in
<hi>France,</hi> for they mu<U+017F>t ever be on <U+017F>ome Mountain, where every one mu<U+017F>t have her
Grot to <U+017F>tudy in, as your Hermits do in their Cells; whereas here they'll be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
di<U+017F>turbed by importunate vi<U+017F>its; and though they were troubled with
none but <U+017F>uch as de<U+017F>ire to be <hi>Poets,</hi> yet would they have enough to divert them
from their meditations; Nay I believe if they will permit all to drink at their
Fountain, it would be dry in one day. There is yet another inconvenience they
are <U+017F>ubject to, if there be not order taken, and it is this, <hi>France</hi> is well <U+017F>tored with
a <U+017F>ort of people who make it their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to cajoll and corrupt young Maids;
it's to be feared they may do the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome injury, and <U+017F>o that honourable Cha<U+017F>tity
which they pro<U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>o much before, will be de<U+017F>troyed; and you know

to the devotion of a <U+017F>ort of Pimps, and <U+017F>uch other props and pillars of Taverns

as ba<U+017F>e and la<U+017F>civious as Satyrs, which is the rea<U+017F>on that commonly their Works
come out under that name. I am obliged to you for the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> you <U+017F>hew your tenderne<U+017F>s of the honour of the <hi>Mu<U+017F>es;</hi> but is your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<U+017F>o weak as to believe I had not prevention enough to provide for all the<U+017F>e
di<U+017F>orders? When they <U+017F>hall have cho<U+017F>en <U+017F>ome little Mountain in this Countrey

to come and <U+017F>ee them: They <U+017F>hall be kept in with good Walls, and there <U+017F>hall be
<U+017F>trong Guards at the Gates.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> ended this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, it hapned <hi>Charite</hi> had <U+017F>omewhat to <U+017F>ay to <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi>
<U+017F>o that <U+017F>he came into the Hall to acquaint her with it; but <U+017F>he went out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
immediately <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o many people, and e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> for <U+017F>he was a<U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to appear before him, and was afraid <U+017F>omwhat might be <U+017F>aid to her as <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
by. The Heroick Shepherd <U+017F>hifted off his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e when he perceived her,
<U+017F>o abruptly, that all wondred at it. O God! <U+017F>aies he in him<U+017F>elf, I have <U+017F>een her,
and <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>een me, now I have my de<U+017F>ires, <U+017F>he hath at length <U+017F>hown her <U+017F>elf,
notwith<U+017F>tanding her <U+017F>olitary humour.</p>
            <p>But after this, perceiving that <hi>Charite</hi> was gone, he was <U+017F>ad as might be, <U+017F>o
that he entred not into any further talk with any body. <hi>Hircan</hi> in the mean time
having <U+017F>poken to <hi>Amaryllis</hi> more clearly of his affection then ever, <U+017F>he told him
that <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf much honoured, if he loved her only on honourable
grounds; and thereupon an ancient Gentleman, a kin<U+017F>man of <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near them, <U+017F>aid that the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly was <U+017F>o great and noble, that he imagined
him<U+017F>elf at the contract of a Marriage. It <U+017F>hall not be my fault if it be not <U+017F>o,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan;</hi> I wi<U+017F>h the things I have <U+017F>poken to your fair Niece here, were already
effected; and if you plea<U+017F>e, you <U+017F>hall know what they are. He thereupon told him
his <U+017F>uit to <hi>Aamaryllis,</hi> and the advantages of her marriage with him; <U+017F>o that the
old Blade liked all very well; and having under<U+017F>tood that his Neece, who was
the mo<U+017F>t concern'd in it, con<U+017F>ented, he went and propo<U+017F>ed the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to <hi>Orontes,</hi>
and the other Gentlemen. The matter was <U+017F>o advanced, that they <U+017F>ent for a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to pa<U+017F>s the Contract, and a Prie<U+017F>t to make them <U+017F>ure. 'Twas <U+017F>aid that a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion had brought this A<U+017F><U+017F>embly together, <U+017F>ince that if they had been
to be betroathed upon previous a<U+017F><U+017F>ignation, they could have invited none other
but what were pre<U+017F>ent, for the chiefe<U+017F>t friends of <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>Amaryllis</hi> were
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43725:163"/>
there. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ee the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon effected,
and becau<U+017F>e he was for its going forward, he <U+017F>igned the minutes of the Contract
as well as the re<U+017F>t. While all this was in agitation, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had the oportunity
to <U+017F>peak to <hi>Angelica,</hi> and their pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions were <U+017F>o violent, that though they had
<U+017F>ufficiently declared one to another their minds, yet they re<U+017F>olved on a vi<U+017F>it at
night, as they had de<U+017F>igned the day before. <hi>Angelica</hi> told him that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
might be about ten of the clock in a Bower of the Garden where <U+017F>he would
be <U+017F>ure to be, and that <U+017F>he would order the back-gate to be left open for <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi>
to come in at.</p>
            <p>The complot being made, they <U+017F>eparated, to avoid <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, when in the mean
time <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who<U+017F>e mind was burthened with excellent de<U+017F>ignes, went out of the
Hall and <U+017F>et upon <hi>Jacquelina</hi> the Kitchenmaid. Fair Companion of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
<U+017F>aies he to her, <U+017F>hall I never obtain of you that favour which you may grant me
without any hurt to your <U+017F>elf? Tell me what hour I may entertain <hi>Charite</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
'Tis <U+017F>o long <U+017F>ince I have <U+017F>poken with her<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that it even grieves me to death.
Come at night between nine and ten into the Garden, replies the maid, there you
will find her; <U+017F>he commonly re<U+017F>ts her <U+017F>elf on a green Plat in one of the Alleys,
<U+017F>o much is <U+017F>he taken with the coole of the evening; when <U+017F>he is to go to bed, we
mu<U+017F>t ever go and fetch her thence. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thank'd the maid for this notice, and
promi<U+017F>ed her not to fail at the time a<U+017F><U+017F>igned.</p>
            <p>The Sun being already <U+017F>omewhat low, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor</hi> retired, <U+017F>o did
the Gentlemen of <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s quarter; and as for her part, <U+017F>he took Coach with
the Gentlewomen her Gatherers. <hi>Hircan</hi> being unwilling to leave his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
went along with them in the Coach. As for the Countrey-people whom
<hi>Bacchus</hi> had brought with him, they had before taken their leave. <hi>Fontenay</hi> and
the other Shepherds <U+017F>eeing their Ho<U+017F>t had left them, returned neverthele<U+017F>s to his
Ca<U+017F>tle, and carried <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> along with them. Now that there is a fre<U+017F>h
gale of wind <U+017F>tirring, would you not gladly be a little warmer about the head,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Philiris?</hi> this <U+017F>ingle Lawrel cannot keep off the inconvenience of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I feel nothing I <U+017F>wear to thee, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and I would not by any means
have been Crowned otherwi<U+017F>e in <U+017F>o honourable an A<U+017F><U+017F>embly as we have been in;
be<U+017F>ides, that <hi>Charite</hi> hath <U+017F>een me in this po<U+017F>ture, which comforts me above all:
Not will I be otherwi<U+017F>e cloathed then I am now, at <hi>Hircans</hi> Wedding. 'Tis true,
that when it is once night, I <U+017F>hould not think my hat any inconvenience.</p>
            <p>With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e the Pa<U+017F>toral Company came to their ordinary abode; and
while Supper was making ready, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf thus to <hi>Carmelin,</hi> Thou
ha<U+017F>t known the be<U+017F>t part of my noble<U+017F>t adventures, courteous <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and I
believe there is not any one which thou do<U+017F>t not admire, and celebrate to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
as the eloquent <hi>Philiris</hi> does, who hath promi<U+017F>ed me to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e them into a
<hi>Romance,</hi> that <U+017F>hall go beyond all have been yet <U+017F>een in the world. But I am not
to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble or di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf to thee: I am not yet <U+017F>atisfied, though it may be
<U+017F>aid I do but dream when I think to effect any great matters to make my Hi<U+017F>tory
the more remarkable. I never <U+017F>poke to my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s in any <U+017F>ecret place, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any de<U+017F>igne to <U+017F>teal her away; yet it may be found in Books, that a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lovers that were not comparable to me, have done all this. 'Tis true, they
are not the more to be e<U+017F>teemed for any of all the<U+017F>e things, for the<U+017F>e were all the
adventures they were ever guilty of; whereas I have run through ten thou<U+017F>and:
yet mu<U+017F>t I not omit this. I am re<U+017F>olved this night to <U+017F>peak to <hi>Charite,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to deliver her out of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s: for indeed <U+017F>he is not in a condition
worthy her perfections. She hath <U+017F>ometimes told me that <U+017F>he was abu<U+017F>ed, and
that <U+017F>he was kept in great <U+017F>ubjection. If thou wilt but a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me in this occa<U+017F>ion,
I will do as much for thee in another. I cannot deny you, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but if
I love the great Stone you would have me, would you undertake to bring away
<U+017F>uch a heavy piece? We <U+017F>hall try, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> Love will furni<U+017F>h us with force
and artifice. Let's for the pre<U+017F>ent think on what I propo<U+017F>e: Know then that I
have had notice from <hi>Jacquelina,</hi> to come into <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Garden, there to <U+017F>ee my
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43725:164"/>
My Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. But I pray tell me, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> what <U+017F>hall we do with her when
we have her? We will carry her into <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trange Country till our friends
<U+017F>hall agree to the match, repy'd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> But in the mean time, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
will you take nothing of her by way of advance? What a propo<U+017F>ition do<U+017F>t thou
make? <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that's a thing <hi>Pamphilus</hi> would never do to <hi>Ni<U+017F>a, Per<U+017F>iles</hi> to
<hi>Sigi<U+017F>monda, Li<U+017F>ander</hi> to <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta, Polexander</hi> to <hi>Ericlea;</hi> and to go a little higher in
the Chronology, what <hi>Clitophon</hi> never did to <hi>Leucippa,</hi> nor <hi>Theagenes</hi> to <hi>Chariclea:</hi>
All the<U+017F>e Lovers had about them a mode<U+017F>ty which kept them from asking any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
favours of their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es then ki<U+017F><U+017F>es; They lived together like brother
and <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter; I do not mean as <hi>Jupiter</hi> with his <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter <hi>Juno:</hi> be<U+017F>ides, thou art to
know <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that <hi>Charite</hi>'s thighs are two Pillars of white Marble, which I
compare to tho<U+017F>e which the great <hi>Alcides</hi> erected at the end of his Travels. There
will be found written that there is no going beyond, and that to do it is a thing
forbiden our hands, nay our very de<U+017F>ires; it is not yet time that the <U+017F>pring of that
Beauty <U+017F>hould be rob'd of its ro<U+017F>e. You are <U+017F>o hone<U+017F>t a man, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that
you <U+017F>hall not need <U+017F>wear that you de<U+017F>ire the pre<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Charite</hi>'s cha<U+017F>tity;
but that which troubles me is, to know how we <U+017F>hall be tran<U+017F>ported into tho<U+017F>e
far Countries where you de<U+017F>ire to go: It will co<U+017F>t us much to carry all nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries
with us; I know not at pre<U+017F>ent whether your pur<U+017F>e be <U+017F>o heavy or no. Mu<U+017F>t we
not go to <hi>Bertrands</hi> for our Sheep, and take them along with us? That were
too great a trouble to us, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that imagination of thine is very ru<U+017F>tick:
Can people that run away carry a Flock with them? yet I am obliged to thee
for what thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>aid, for thou ha<U+017F>t often put me in mind of my poor <U+017F>heep,
whereof I have had no great care <U+017F>ince we came hither, becau<U+017F>e our Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and other recreations have made me pa<U+017F>s away the time the more plea<U+017F>antly.
I know I am to blame that I have not brought them hither to feed with <hi>Hircans;</hi>
But to <U+017F>atisfie thee in the re<U+017F>t, know that we need not be <U+017F>o rich to undertake this
de<U+017F>igne I now have. We will take <hi>Charite</hi> with us into <hi>Hircans</hi> Coach, and <U+017F>o
we <U+017F>hal be tran<U+017F>ported immediately into far Countries. We <U+017F>hal want nothing by
the way, we <U+017F>hall meet with <hi>Magicians</hi> that will entertain us, and if there be but
Hangings in their Chambers, we <U+017F>hall never die for want of meat. But if they be
hang'd with <hi>Mats,</hi> <U+017F>hall we like A<U+017F><U+017F>es feed in the <U+017F>traw? Thou are too di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> know that if we plea<U+017F>e we <U+017F>hall need take no Inn by the
way, for we <U+017F>hall be in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> in an in<U+017F>tant, and there we'll put on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
weeds, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>hall be magnificently entertained in the Palaces of <U+017F>ome
great Lords; for it's <U+017F>een that in all Romances, Lovers have <U+017F>omewhat charming
about them, which makes them be e<U+017F>teemed and <U+017F>ought after by all they meet
with, <U+017F>o that they never go into any place but they fare well, they having no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
<U+017F>o much as to open their Pur<U+017F>es. Let what will come on't then, <U+017F>aies <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
I'll <U+017F>ee the effects of your enterpri<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>As the<U+017F>e Shepherds were engaged in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who commanded
all in his Couzens ab<U+017F>ence, cau<U+017F>ed Supper to be brought up, and all <U+017F>ate down.
Supper ended, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> of his own accord put off his Crown and took his hat,
thinking it more convenient to wear in the night. He went out <U+017F>ecretly with
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> and <U+017F>uffered the re<U+017F>t to go to bed, who thought he had been abed
too.</p>
            <p>After a many di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es in the fields, <hi>Carmelin</hi> told his Ma<U+017F>ter, it might very
well be about the time appointed; <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thought <U+017F>o too, <U+017F>o that he took his way
towards <hi>Orontes</hi>'s with his faithfull Companion in Love and Arms, who was <U+017F>o
de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee what he would do, that it was curio<U+017F>ity rather then duty obliged
him to follow him.</p>
            <p>They found the Garden dore open, <hi>Angelica</hi> having given order it <U+017F>hould be
left <U+017F>o, to keep promi<U+017F>e with <hi>An<U+017F>elme.</hi> This <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>uch a fortune to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who
was glad to avoid the <U+017F>caling of the Walls, that it put him into great hopes his
de<U+017F>igne might have a happy i<U+017F><U+017F>ue. As he went about the Garden to find that
gra<U+017F><U+017F>y place where <hi>Charite</hi> re<U+017F>ted her <U+017F>elf, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> who was carefull of his hour,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43725:164"/>
comes in at the <U+017F>ame dore, and went directly to the Bower where <hi>Angelica</hi> was
to expect him; <U+017F>he was already there, and waited for him with <U+017F>ome impatience.
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> courted her with all the Love-Complements that a favour <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>he
had done him could de<U+017F>erve, and as <U+017F>he promi<U+017F>ed him far greater, if he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a faithfull Love to her, <U+017F>o he made a thou<U+017F>and prote<U+017F>tations of an eternal
con<U+017F>tancy. He was pre<U+017F>ently paid again by her in the <U+017F>ame coine; and this gave
him the confidence to ki<U+017F>s his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, as if he wi<U+017F>hed that their lips pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing
one anothers, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eal with a Love-<U+017F>ignet, the promi<U+017F>e they had made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> in the mean time, who had a better <U+017F>ight then his Ma<U+017F>ter, told <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
he had found a Walk wherein there was a bank of Trifoly, and that he perceived
<U+017F>omebody lying down thereon: <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> looking towards it, thought it had been
<hi>Charite,</hi> but it was only a Faggot dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed and <U+017F>wath'd about, which <hi>Jacquelina</hi>
had put there to deceive <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> he makes towards it very <U+017F>oftly; and as he
thought he had <hi>Charite</hi> by the Coat, the apparition retreats a little: How's this?
<U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <U+017F>lides along the gra<U+017F><U+017F>e like a Snake; Speak lower,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> or hold thy peace le<U+017F>t thou frighten her.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he came nearer and nearer, and took hold of a <U+017F>leeve <U+017F>tuffed
with rags, which was fa<U+017F>tned to the Faggot, thinking he then had his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
fa<U+017F>t enough; What do you here <U+017F>o <U+017F>olitary? my Faire<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aies he, do you not
fear the Mildew? that you prefer this place before <hi>Orontes</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
you are more di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfied then ever? Tell me without di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, for I
am come hither to deliver you out of your mi<U+017F>ery; you <U+017F>hall henceforth be with
him, who is more carefull of you then him<U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>As he had ended the<U+017F>e words, his fair <hi>Charite</hi> made a great <U+017F>truggle to get out
of his hands, for the Kitchen-maid, and <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>ervants of <hi>Orontes</hi>'s being
at the end of the Walk, held a Cord that was fa<U+017F>tned to the Faggot, which when
they pulled, drew it away; Come and help me <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> there is
<U+017F>ome rival takes away <hi>Charite</hi> by the other arm: I mu<U+017F>t needs think <U+017F>o though
I can <U+017F>ee none, the night hinders me to perceive it; but yet do not come, le<U+017F>t we
<U+017F>hould by that means pull this tender bodie in pieces. Thus was the fair <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>toclea</hi>
di<U+017F>membred by her Lovers, who would all have her. Here he paws'd a-little,
whereupon the <U+017F>ervants having given another good pull, brought away
clearly the dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Faggot. <hi>Li<U+017F>is</hi> had nothing left him but an old glove <U+017F>tuffed
with paper that had been <U+017F>ewed to the <U+017F>leeve for to make a hand. Wo is me!
<U+017F>aies the poor Lover, what have I done? wretch that I am, is not this <hi>Charite</hi>'s
hand? my violent pulling of her hath now left her but one hand.</p>
            <p>This he <U+017F>poke <U+017F>omewhat lowd, and the <U+017F>ervants made no <U+017F>mall noi<U+017F>e with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<U+017F>o that <hi>Leonora</hi> who was not yet a<U+017F>leep, called her daughter to know what
was the matter below; <U+017F>he perceiving that <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered not, though <U+017F>he were
alwaies ea<U+017F>ily awoken, concluded <U+017F>he was not abed; her Chamber being near
hers, <U+017F>he put on her coat, and out of curio<U+017F>ity went in, and not finding her,
would needs know what <U+017F>he did: <U+017F>he comes down into the Garden, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
whereof <U+017F>he found the maid and <U+017F>ome of <hi>Orontes</hi> his men: What do you
here, what noi<U+017F>e you make? <U+017F>aies <U+017F>he to them. 'Tis only to put to a trick on
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> replies the maid, who took a bu<U+017F>h for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. You want <U+017F>omewhat
to do indeed; Tell me where my daughter is: are my brother and <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter abed?
is <U+017F>he not with them? They are abed Madam, replies the man, and <U+017F>ure my
young Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s is abed too: But <U+017F>he is not, <U+017F>aies <hi>Leonora,</hi> almo<U+017F>t out of her <U+017F>elf,
I mu<U+017F>t find her out. Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he went directly to the Bower where her
daughter was with <hi>An<U+017F>elme;</hi> and the two Lovers knowing who it was, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<U+017F>urprized; and <U+017F>he a<U+017F><U+017F>oon knew both <hi>Angelica</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> too: Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him there at an un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable hour, <U+017F>he could not but <U+017F>peak the<U+017F>e words to
him, Is it thus then Sir, that you abu<U+017F>e my goodne<U+017F>s? Are you not content with
the honourable Liberty which I have ever granted? Does it not <U+017F>uffice you to
<U+017F>peak to my daughter every day in my pre<U+017F>ence, but you mu<U+017F>t bring her to this
place? As for her part, I <U+017F>hall puni<U+017F>h her impudence; <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t have a great
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43725:165"/>
deal of confidence to leave me to come hither at <U+017F>uch time as I think her abed
Where was it ever <U+017F>een that Gentlewomen of quality have ever taken <U+017F>o much
liberty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonora</hi> was thus chiding both the one and the other, and <hi>Angelica</hi> an<U+017F>wered
her already by her tears; when <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who went all about looking for <hi>Charite</hi> in
an extream affliction, as thinking he had pulled off one of her hands, came into
that place, where on the one <U+017F>ide there was <U+017F>o much cholor, and on the other <U+017F>o
much amazement: The fir<U+017F>t he perceived was <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom his extravagance
made him take for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o that he ran to her with his arms open, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
embraced her <U+017F>aid to her in a <U+017F>ad accent, Pardon me the outrage I have done
you my faire<U+017F>t, there may be means to make all good again; my friend <hi>Hircan</hi>
can do any thing. Who hath brought this fool hither again? <U+017F>aies <hi>Leonora,</hi>
thru<U+017F>ting him from her; is it you <hi>An<U+017F>elme?</hi> I believe you have brought him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely
from <hi>Paris,</hi> to amu<U+017F>e me with his extravagances, <U+017F>o that I might not heed
your ill de<U+017F>ignes; you are to blame for it, and you have done what misbecomes
the reputation which you have in the world. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> de<U+017F>irous to appea<U+017F>e this
angry Mother, <U+017F>poke to her in the<U+017F>e words, I am yet ignorant, Madam, <U+017F>aies he,
of that wherein you <U+017F>hould think I have committed <U+017F>o great a fault, for I will
<U+017F>wear to you that I have done nothing with <hi>Angelica</hi> which I <U+017F>hould not before
you: all that you can <U+017F>ay is, that I have <U+017F>poken with her at a time when you
thought me far hence; but can you find no excu<U+017F>e for that, and will you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that true one which I <U+017F>hall give you? I am <U+017F>o much a lover of <U+017F>olitary
walking, that in <U+017F>ome melancholick thoughts I came thus far, and finding the
dore open, came into the Garden; your daughter being walking for coolne<U+017F>s, I
could do no le<U+017F>s then <U+017F>alute her; and our fir<U+017F>t complements ended when you <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
us. This is a fine tale to feed fools with, <U+017F>aies <hi>Leonora,</hi> I am not <U+017F>o light
of belief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hearing this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e not without amazement, perceiv'd <hi>Charite</hi> was
not there, and not de<U+017F>iring to be informed of the occa<U+017F>ion of this debate, he <U+017F>poke
thus, Tell me quickly where my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s is, and <U+017F>uffer me not to langui<U+017F>h <U+017F>o long.
Alas I have pulled off one of her hands which I have here; it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ew'd to the
arm again, and the wound anointed with <U+017F>ome Bal<U+017F>ome, that while it is yet green
the fle<U+017F>h may knit again. Make this fool hold his peace, if you will, <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi>
<U+017F>aies <hi>Leonora,</hi> I can no longer endure his impertinency; he hath no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne
in it then to abu<U+017F>e me. I was as ignorant, Madam, as your <U+017F>elf of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s
being here, replyes <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> he comes from <hi>Hircans</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle, and not from
<hi>Montenors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed thus, <hi>Carmelin</hi> came and told his Ma<U+017F>ter that he
had no occa<U+017F>ion to be troubled, and that he thought he had heard <hi>Charite</hi>
laugh, <U+017F>o that it was to be conceived <U+017F>he had had no hurt: But have I not her
hand here, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I pray let me <U+017F>ee it, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin. Ly<U+017F>is</hi> gave it him
to hold; and <hi>Carmelin</hi> finding pre<U+017F>ently it was but a glove, acquainted his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
with it, who coming <U+017F>omewhat to him<U+017F>elf, began to <U+017F>ee the truth: he took
back the glove with admiration, and taking his <U+017F>ervant a<U+017F>ide, <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aies he, there's
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> in the Bower, he is with <hi>Angelica,</hi> and que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F>s he had a de<U+017F>igne to
carry her away. Thou mai<U+017F>t infer from this, I am not the only Lover that hath
<U+017F>uch intentions; but take notice that <hi>Leonora</hi> is there too: I took her erewhiles
in the dark for <hi>Charite;</hi> <U+017F>he is extreamly angry with <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> all this have I
ob<U+017F>erved, though my mind was in an extraordinary agitation: wherefore we
were be<U+017F>t begone, le<U+017F>t we be taken as acce<U+017F>aries, and be endicted as ravi<U+017F>hers of
young maids; 'tis true, if things be taken as they <U+017F>hould be, I am not <U+017F>o much in
fault as my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; for whereas I had only the de<U+017F>igne to ravi<U+017F>h her, but have
effected nothing, <U+017F>he hath effectually ravi<U+017F>hed me; and if I would have ravi<U+017F>hed
her fair body, <U+017F>he hath ravi<U+017F>hed my poor <U+017F>oul: But the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ubtile rea<U+017F>ons haply
are not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily under<U+017F>tood, therefore it's be<U+017F>t provide for our own <U+017F>afety; I have
already <U+017F>uffered for it. Then, Ma<U+017F>ter, let's begone, replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43725:165"/>
<U+017F>hall not need <U+017F>peak to me twice: I have ever feared dangers.</p>
            <p>Hereupon they took the <U+017F>ame way they came, without the notice of any body;
and when they had recovered <hi>Hircans</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle, they both went to bed well <U+017F>atisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for though <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had not brought away <hi>Charite</hi> as he intended, yet was he glad
he had not pulled off her hand, as he imagined, which made him re<U+017F>olve ever to
pre<U+017F>erve the glove he had gotten in<U+017F>tead of it. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> his comfort was,
that he was not beaten, becau<U+017F>e he imagined that enterpri<U+017F>es, <U+017F>uch as he had
engaged in, were <U+017F>eldome attempted, but at the hazard of the <U+017F>houlders.</p>
            <p>While they were going their waies, <hi>Orontes</hi> having heard a noi<U+017F>e in his Garden,
asked one of his Lacquays what the matter was; he was loath to tell him that it
was only a trick put upon <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but cho<U+017F>e rather to tell him that <hi>Leonora</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with her daughter: The <U+017F>trangene<U+017F>s of that accident made him pre<U+017F>ently get
up, and putting on a night-Gown, he came down into the Garden; he fir<U+017F>t of all
asked his <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter in law what was the occa<U+017F>ion of her crying out, <U+017F>he in few words
told him the cau<U+017F>e of her di<U+017F>quiet: I believe your complaints may be ju<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid he
to her, but there are means to remedy all: and thereupon taking <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> by the
hand, he took him a<U+017F>ide to tell him, that if he loved <hi>Angelica,</hi> he <U+017F>hould openly
acknowledge his pretentions to her, and not make u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e amorous <U+017F>hifts, as
being not a little prejudicial to the reputation of young Ladies. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
that if he thought <hi>Leonora</hi> did not <U+017F>light him, he <U+017F>hould think him<U+017F>elf much
honoured to <U+017F>erve her daughter before all the world, and that he could never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>po<U+017F>e
of him<U+017F>elf into a better allyance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orontes</hi> being <U+017F>atisfied with this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, went to appea<U+017F>e <hi>Leonora,</hi>
a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her that <hi>An<U+017F>elmes</hi> intentions were honourable: and that he had no
other de<U+017F>igne then to marry her daughter. This <U+017F>he gave ear to, knowing
that <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> was rich, and that <U+017F>he could not meet with a better match: She ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his pardon for having been <U+017F>o rough with him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and told him that on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
they would talk further of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. Now <U+017F>ince it was too late for
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> to go back to <hi>Montenors, Orontes</hi> kept him at his hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ent for one
of his Lacquays, who <U+017F>taid for him in the fields with his hor<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montenor</hi> was <U+017F>omewhat troubled for his friend who returned not; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the morning, his Lacquay brought him an account of him, and de<U+017F>ired
him from his Ma<U+017F>ter, to come to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he could: he failed not to
come, and <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> propo<U+017F>ed the pre<U+017F>ent tran<U+017F>action. The pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of this Lover
was more violent then to <U+017F>uffer any delay; <U+017F>o that <hi>Orontes</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> having
drawn up the Conditions of the Contract, he granted all they de<U+017F>ired one only
thing provided, that there <U+017F>hould be no further <U+017F>tay in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; <hi>Leonora</hi>
made <U+017F>ome exception<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and would not be <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty <U+017F>aying that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t return
to <hi>Paris:</hi> But <hi>Florida</hi> advi<U+017F>ed her not to put her <U+017F>elf to that trouble, <U+017F>o that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elme,</hi>
and <hi>Angelica</hi> were made <U+017F>ure that morning.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being got up, the fir<U+017F>t thing he did was to contemplate
<hi>Charite</hi>'s glove: he took out al the rags of paper that were within, and when he had
unfolded them, thinking they had been Love-Letters that <U+017F>ome Rival had <U+017F>ent to
his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, he found occa<U+017F>ion to quit the jealou<U+017F>ie, for he found nothing but
pieces of accounts for the Kitchin; tho<U+017F>e he valued not, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing they were
thru<U+017F>t in there by chance<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but as for the glove, he folded it up in white paper,
to <U+017F>hew it <U+017F>ome day to <hi>Philiris,</hi> as an evidence of the de<U+017F>igne he had to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<hi>Charite,</hi> which would have been as great an ornament to the <U+017F>tory, as if he
had effected it.</p>
            <p>He and <hi>Carmelin</hi> being alone talking of divers things, <hi>Fontenay</hi> and the other
Shepherds came into the Chamber. He wondred to <U+017F>ee them clad like Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and that of the brave<U+017F>t: What, <U+017F>aies he to them, will you for<U+017F>ake me, my
dear friends? will you continue no longer in the happy condition you had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
your <U+017F>elves in with me; Alas! who is the author of this di<U+017F>order? but if
any leave me, let <hi>Philiris</hi> <U+017F>tay, the incomparable ingenuity that promi<U+017F>ed me to
do <U+017F>uch great matters: Do not imagin we <U+017F>hall be guilty of <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ignal unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullne<U+017F>s
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43725:166"/>
as to for<U+017F>ake you, replies <hi>Philiris,</hi> that we are not now clad as Shepherds,
but as the Country requires, 'tis becau<U+017F>e <hi>Hircan</hi> is married to day, and that we
mu<U+017F>t be gallant to <U+017F>et forth the <U+017F>olemnity of the Wedding: Nay then you give a
good account, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and for my part here's my Heroical habit which I have
put on with my buskins as doubting much <U+017F>uch a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; I will al<U+017F>o put on my
belt and Sword, and will wear my Crown of Lawrel on my head, to do all the
honour I can to the incomparable <hi>Hircan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having <U+017F>poken thus, took all his equipage; and being he was invited to
the Wedding with the re<U+017F>t, as al<U+017F>o <hi>Carmelin,</hi> they took <hi>Hircans</hi> Coach for to go
to <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s, where the <U+017F>olemnity was kept; There they found <hi>Clarimond</hi> and
his mother, who were in like manner invited: They had been married betimes
in the morning, and few people were pre<U+017F>ent; but at Dinner there was a fair
Company: They now <U+017F>taid only for <hi>Orontes</hi> and tho<U+017F>e of his hou<U+017F>e, with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elme</hi>
and <hi>Montenor,</hi> but they came in good time, and excu<U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<U+017F>taid <U+017F>o long, becau<U+017F>e they had been bu<U+017F>ie at a betroathing<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> You je<U+017F>t, do
you not? <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> or is it only <hi>Orontes</hi> his man that marries a Countrey
La<U+017F>s he's fallen in love with? 'Tis notably gue<U+017F>t, replies <hi>Orontes;</hi> no, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
per<U+017F>ons of greater quality; ask <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> what they know of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montenor</hi> hereupon related the whole truth of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, whereat they were
all very joyfull; and yet <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> could not but break out thus; Since all the world
is re<U+017F>olved to be married here, without <U+017F>taying till I marry, to make a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu<U+017F>ion
of all amorous adventures; why are you not all marryed together? Why
was not <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> made <U+017F>ure ye<U+017F>terday, that he might have been-married to day as
well as <hi>Hircan?</hi> that had been according to the mode of the mo<U+017F>t famous Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
where all the Marriages happen on the <U+017F>ame day, and in the <U+017F>ame place.
Would you not al<U+017F>o have them lie all in the <U+017F>ame bed? <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him, you give us indeed fine examples by quoting your Fables to us. Do
you not yet perceive that they are ab<U+017F>urdities imagined at the Authors plea<U+017F>ure?
can there be <U+017F>uch a concernment and relation between the affairs of <U+017F>eaven or
eight <U+017F>everal Families, that they <U+017F>hall in one day agree all on Marriages? Is there
not ever <U+017F>ome delay of one <U+017F>ide or other? And as for the Weddings of divers
per<U+017F>ons all in the <U+017F>ame place, where hath there ever any <U+017F>uch thing been <U+017F>een? In
<U+017F>uch a confu<U+017F>ion, how can each Bridegroom ob<U+017F>erve his duty to his friends, and
place them all according to their qualities?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would have made <U+017F>ome lewd reply to this, but his de<U+017F>igne was prevented
by a<U+017F><U+017F>igning him his place at Table, where he was <U+017F>o placed, that he had a hard
task to an<U+017F>wer all that <U+017F>hould que<U+017F>tion him on divers points of his Loves. When
his mind was any thing at liberty, he fell into a very deep con<U+017F>ideration: It came
into his mind, that when he was di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed like a maid, he was called <hi>Amaryllis;</hi>
and <U+017F>eeing now another <hi>Amaryllis</hi> marryed to <hi>Hircan,</hi> who was the per<U+017F>on <U+017F>he
mo<U+017F>t loved; he knew not whether he might thence pre<U+017F>age any thing to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and that it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ignifie that he <U+017F>hould one day by the Knot of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
be joyned to her whom he adored above all things. Be<U+017F>ides, this <hi>Amaryl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
was <U+017F>omewhat like the Nymph <hi>Lucida,</hi> of whom he thought he had been lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
for whom al<U+017F>o he had <U+017F>ome <U+017F>park of affection; but <U+017F>eeing this <hi>Lucida</hi> had
repre<U+017F>ented <hi>Charite</hi> to him, and that this <hi>Amaryllis</hi> had repre<U+017F>ented to him that
<hi>Lucida,</hi> and that he now <U+017F>aw this <hi>Amaryllis</hi> between <hi>Hircans</hi> arms, he ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<U+017F>uffered a vici<U+017F>citude of imagination, and <U+017F>tood between hope and fear.
Thus out of too great <U+017F>uper<U+017F>tition, he reflected on particulars of no con<U+017F>equence,
thinking thence to pre<U+017F>age what was to come.</p>
            <p>In the mid<U+017F>t of their dancing after dinner, comes into the Hall the Wor<U+017F>hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Adrian,</hi> with his wife <hi>Pernella;</hi> all that knew them were very glad to <U+017F>ee
them, except <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who forgetting all other con<U+017F>iderations, went to hide him<U+017F>elf
in the Chimney-corner: You are welcome, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan,</hi> I wi<U+017F>h you had been
here <U+017F>ooner to have dined with us; Truly Sir, replies <hi>Adrian,</hi> I thank you for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43725:166"/>
your good wil, I come hither only to fetch away my Cou<U+017F>in; I have bin at a Ca<U+017F>tle,
which I think belongs to you, where I asked for him, but I was told he was here,
<U+017F>o that I have cau<U+017F>ed the Waggon to come thus far out of the way: I had told
you I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay in this Countrey <U+017F>omewhat longer then my Pilgrimage requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for I have been with a Gentleman that ought me <U+017F>ome money, he hath paid
me, I thank God, and be<U+017F>ides he hath entertained me well till now, which, without
offence to you, is a quality <U+017F>eldom found in <U+017F>uch people; but it may be he did it
to draw me in to tru<U+017F>t him further another time: That may very well be, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Hircan,</hi> but I pray re<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elves a little, while <U+017F>omewhat be made ready for your
dinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> hereupon <U+017F>aid he had din'd, and that he de<U+017F>ired only to <U+017F>peak with his
Cou<U+017F>in, which obliged <hi>Meliantes</hi> to bring him into the mid<U+017F>t of the Hall; <hi>Adrian</hi>
<U+017F>eeing him accoutred as he was, was extreamly angry; What, <U+017F>aies he to him,
wilt thou never give over thy follies? thou every day take<U+017F>t up new fa<U+017F>hions:
At St. <hi>Clou</hi> thou wert clad like a Shepherd; the other day thou wert like a Witch,
and now thou art like a Player: Well Gentlemen, continues he, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
tho<U+017F>e that were pre<U+017F>ent, you are to blame to make your <U+017F>port of this poor
lad: 'Tis true, your Cou<U+017F>in finds us much <U+017F>port, <U+017F>aies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> but it <U+017F>hews his
ingenuity greater then ours to invent new pa<U+017F>times: That he is clad as you <U+017F>ee
him, is only out of gallantry. How now Cou<U+017F>in, (<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> not heeding what had
been <U+017F>aid in his excu<U+017F>e) are you amazed to <U+017F>ee me clad thus? know that I am not
<U+017F>imply a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> but that I am an <hi>Heroical Shepherd;</hi> you <U+017F>hall find me one
day painted in Books as you <U+017F>ee me now. <hi>Adrian</hi> thought not the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons good
payment, and <U+017F>wore he would carry away his Ward with him to <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
               </hi> You <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>tay here two or three dayes, <U+017F>aies <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> to him, this is but a Wedding: you
<U+017F>hal <U+017F>ee it is <U+017F>o, and withall con<U+017F>ider whether our actions are <U+017F>o much to be found
fault with, as that there <U+017F>hould be any danger to leave your Ward among us.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>omewhat appea<U+017F>ed <hi>Adrian;</hi> and though he had a pair of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Boots on, yet a Gentlewoman went and invited him to dance a Galliard;
he dur<U+017F>t not refu<U+017F>e her, and took it as an occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>hew what he could have
done in his youth. After that they danced a Roundelay, wherein both he and
his wife were ingaged, as al<U+017F>o <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>o that it was no <U+017F>mall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
to <U+017F>ee their <U+017F>everal po<U+017F>tures. The Company decrea<U+017F>ed by little and little,
becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome that were invited to dinner, were not to <U+017F>tay <U+017F>upper: There were
in a manner none but what belong'd to <hi>Hircan,</hi> that <U+017F>taid. <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella</hi>
having <U+017F>taid the Wedding Supper, though they were <U+017F>trangers, yet were they
lodged in another hou<U+017F>e, for they had need of re<U+017F>t, being quite wearied, both
with dancing and travel.</p>
            <p>Awhile after the Married Couple went to bed, and <hi>Philiris</hi> with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
having <U+017F>ung an <hi>Epithalamium</hi> at the dore, as they were to come down; there
were Nuts <U+017F>o <U+017F>cattered on the <U+017F>tairs, that they came to the bottom <U+017F>ooner then
they de<U+017F>ired: Be<U+017F>ides which there were a many thrown at them, which made a
<U+017F>trange noi<U+017F>e; however they had no hurt, and took all in je<U+017F>t; but it made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>port when they under<U+017F>tood all proceeded from the Illu<U+017F>trious Shepherd, who
had not been with them to <U+017F>ing, but had been on the top of the <U+017F>tairs to <U+017F>hew
them this trick. You have done nobly, <U+017F>aies <hi>Meliantes</hi> to him, I believe
you have ran<U+017F>acked all the Town, to what purpo<U+017F>e is it to ca<U+017F>t away <U+017F>o many
Nuts? Ah! <U+017F>ayies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> with a di<U+017F>dainfull <U+017F>mile, how little are you acquainted
in the <hi>Grecian</hi> and Heroick affairs! 'Tis to be learned out of all good Authors,
that the Wedding night, Nuts were ca<U+017F>t all about the hou<U+017F>e, that the noi<U+017F>e was
made in gathering them again, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tifle the crying out of the Bride: 'twas
my de<U+017F>igne to imitate that good Cu<U+017F>tome. Having by chance found a quantity
of Nuts in the Cockloft of this hou<U+017F>e, I put them into bags, and ca<U+017F>t them at you
as you pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by: And thus ought we to ob<U+017F>erve the excellencies we find in the
Poets, and ancient Authors. You never mind the<U+017F>e things, and that I now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
is le<U+017F>t you might omit any of the nuptial rites: Have you <U+017F>ung <hi>Hymen,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43725:167"/>
Hymen, Hymenaee?</hi> Have you invocated <hi>Juno?</hi> have you lighted the Sacred
Torch? We have done all this, <U+017F>aies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> but for your part you have been
much out: You have ca<U+017F>t away abundance of Nuts, for <hi>Amaryllis</hi> does not cry
out, there's no Maidenhead to lo<U+017F>e; did you not know <U+017F>he was a Widow, and
that her fir<U+017F>t husband had the fir<U+017F>t fruits? You <U+017F>hould have kept your Nuts till
to morrow that <hi>Angelica</hi> is to be married: There you might have be<U+017F>towed them
according to the ancient Cu<U+017F>tome. Whatever's done, <U+017F>aies <hi>Polidor,</hi> we mu<U+017F>t ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s ingenuity, to be <U+017F>o ready to put in practice a thing <U+017F>o ancient as that
no body thought on't, it being a thing of no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity in the times we live in,
when both widows and maids are <U+017F>o tractable, that they never cry out the fir<U+017F>t
night. For my part, <U+017F>aies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> I am not <U+017F>orry for my fall, were it not but to

            <p>
               <hi>Philiris</hi> hereupon, who was more plea<U+017F>ed with this humour then any, went and
knocked at the Chamber-dore where the married couple were abed, not de<U+017F>iring
it might be opened, and bid <hi>Amaryllis</hi> cry out as lowd as <U+017F>he would, teling her no
body would hear her, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had taken order to the contrary, having <U+017F>own
Nuts all about the hou<U+017F>e, according to the ancient Cu<U+017F>tom which he finds in his
Books. <hi>Hircan</hi> who had heard the noi<U+017F>e, whereof he would gladly have known
the rea<U+017F>on, was very well plea<U+017F>ed at this news, which made him laugh heartily;
and as for <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> <U+017F>he was no le<U+017F>s <U+017F>atisfied, as having now <U+017F>hared with him
the greate<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ures of this life. But in the mean time the Dairy-woman hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the noi<U+017F>e of the Nuts cracking under their feet, began to remon<U+017F>trate the
lo<U+017F>s <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffered, becau<U+017F>e all belonged to her. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> who was free enough, would
have given her money to hold her peace, and let him alone; but his Heroick
Coat had neither money nor pockets, <U+017F>o that <hi>Fontenay</hi> could not but tell him
that the Heroes were poor people, <U+017F>ince they never carried a half-penny about
them, nor had any bag nor pocket to put in their nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries, as may be a knife,
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>weet-meats, or notes, In the time when the<U+017F>e habits were ordinarily worne,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> a man needed not carry any thing about him; all he met were <U+017F>o
courteous as to furni<U+017F>h him with all nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries. As for Handkerchiefs, were
there none worne? <U+017F>aies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> I believe not, for the Hi<U+017F>tories nor Fables
mention no <U+017F>uch thing: 'Twas hand<U+017F>om to <U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

becau<U+017F>e it was the fa<U+017F>hion: We do now things that are more ridiculous, which
yet no body wonders at, becau<U+017F>e every ones does them, and that we have <U+017F>een them
done ever <U+017F>ince we came into the world. As concerning the convenience of an
handkerchief, I <U+017F>hall only tell you what <hi>Montagne</hi> <U+017F>aies of a Gentleman, who
thought nothing <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>urd, as that a man <U+017F>hould carry about him the filth of his

            <p>While this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e la<U+017F>ted, the Dairy-woman cau<U+017F>ed her children to gather up

that was tyed up between his legs was unbound, which becau<U+017F>e it di<U+017F>covered tho<U+017F>e

abu<U+017F>ed him for the inconvenience of his Heroick habit. This gave him occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

his privy parts, and that the mo<U+017F>t part of the Golden age knew not what cloathes
meant. I believe, <U+017F>aies <hi>Philiris,</hi> you are of Doctor <hi>Charron</hi>'s opinion, who is
his Book of <hi>Wi<U+017F>dom,</hi> would per<U+017F>wade us to go naked, proving as much as he can,

The next day <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> married <hi>Angelica</hi> as he had re<U+017F>olved; and as they had
been at <hi>Hircans</hi> and <hi>Amaryllis</hi>'s Wedding, they al<U+017F>o came to theirs: they brought
along with them <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife, who though they much ob<U+017F>erved civility,
yet never fared better then when it co<U+017F>t them nothing. Their Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> came
with <hi>Fontenay</hi> and his gang, but he had not his <hi>Heroes</hi> habit on. He was <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad at
his Guardians coming, that he would not cloath him<U+017F>elf magnificently; he cho<U+017F>e
rather to put on his Shepherds cloaths. <hi>Adrian</hi> thought that Fa<U+017F>hion not <U+017F>o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
and therefore chid him not; <hi>Clarimond</hi> came al<U+017F>o to this Fea<U+017F>t, but
quarrelled not at all with the Shepherd, becau<U+017F>e he was engaged in <U+017F>ome other
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>There was no great dancing after dinner, <U+017F>o that <hi>Hircan</hi> and his wife return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Ca<U+017F>tle, and his friends brought <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella,</hi> and their Cou<U+017F>in
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> thither afterward. The poor <U+017F>hepherd was the <U+017F>adde<U+017F>t man in the world,
to <U+017F>ee that his Cou<U+017F>in was come back to fetch him away in a time when he hoped
to be mo<U+017F>t merry with the new married: Had it not been for him, he would
have found out a thou<U+017F>and waies to pa<U+017F>s away the time jocondly; and would not
have parted from <hi>Orontes</hi>'s without <U+017F>peaking to <hi>Charite,</hi> or <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>eeing
her. His Companions di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed the be<U+017F>t they could to cheer him up at <U+017F>upper,
but he took no plea<U+017F>ure in any thing they <U+017F>aid.</p>
            <p>Awhile aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r all went to bed; <hi>Hircan</hi> was now a lover of the night rather
then the day. When he was up the next day, he de<U+017F>ired his friends to put on
their Shepherds Weeds again, and to play the fools more then ever, to make
<U+017F>port with <hi>Adrian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the hone<U+017F>t Citizen was up, he was for his return to <hi>Paris</hi> immediately,
re<U+017F>olving not to go to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s to take his leave of <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he would
not di<U+017F>turb the enjoyments of Marriage: He went only to <U+017F>ee <hi>Hircan,</hi> and gave
him thanks for the honour he had done him and his Cou<U+017F>in, telling him he would
be no further trouble<U+017F>ome to him, but return to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither if ever he came,
he would entertain him the be<U+017F>t he could. As he was in his <U+017F>hallow Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Fontenay, Philiris, Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> came into the room, and <hi>Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi>
<U+017F>poke the fir<U+017F>t; What, <U+017F>aies he, Seigneur <hi>Adrian,</hi> you will rob us of the deare<U+017F>t
trea<U+017F>ure we can ever po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s; will you take away <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> from us, who is the Prince
of the Shepherds of <hi>France?</hi> you would carry him into a dirty City, which is not
his element<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 'tis here he takes plea<U+017F>ure to be, you do him as much injury as us:
If he go hence, all the Divinities of the Country will bewail his departure, and
will endeavour to puni<U+017F>h you for it: I under<U+017F>tand nothing of your Shepherdry,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Adrian,</hi> and my Cou<U+017F>in <U+017F>hould know no more then I: His father was no
Shepherd, he was a good hone<U+017F>t Silkman, as I am; let him follow the way we
have gone before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hearing this conte<U+017F>tation out of another Chamber, went down pre<U+017F>ently,
where he found <hi>Carmelin,</hi> and bidding him take his <U+017F>heephook, as he had his,
told him he would go into the fields to hide him<U+017F>elf from his Cou<U+017F>in, who would
carry him away: <hi>Carmelin</hi> thought it the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e; he began to be in love
with a Country where he had <U+017F>o long fared well; he did not imagine he could
meet with a better fortune in <hi>Paris:</hi> He therefore cheerfully followed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter;
and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> meeting in his way one of <hi>Hircans</hi> Lacquays, de<U+017F>ired him to
bid <hi>Philiris</hi> return to his Flock, and come to him <U+017F>ecretly in his ordinary Pa<U+017F>tures,
if he had any thing to <U+017F>ay to him. <hi>Adrian</hi> in the mean time being re<U+017F>olved to
carry him away, whatever they <U+017F>aid to the contrary, <U+017F>ought him out every where,
but not finding him, grew very angry, <U+017F>aying they were much to blame to keep
from him a youth that was committed to his Tuition: You know not where you
are, <U+017F>aies <hi>Fontenay</hi> to him, if you had <U+017F>poke to your Ward of this Ca<U+017F>tle, he
would have told you it belonged to a Magician that hath great power: If you
do not hearken to our admonitions, do you know how he will puni<U+017F>h you, and
that ju<U+017F>tly? He will take <U+017F>uch order that you <U+017F>hall never hear any thing again:

The Shepherds having re<U+017F>olved with <hi>Hircan</hi> what they <U+017F>hould do, began to

alone, told his Companions that they mu<U+017F>t break fa<U+017F>t <U+017F>o as to need no dinner,
and that done, go to the place where he <U+017F>hould find their incomparable Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,

this his wife returns, who <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he could hear nothing of her Cou<U+017F>in: They bid
her not trouble her <U+017F>elf, for it would not be long ere <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee him. The
Shepherds after they had eaten, took every one his Sheephook, and leaving <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>

<hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife with the wonders of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> his life,
and his <U+017F>trange adventures. They knew not whether they
<U+017F>hould take all for true misfortunes, or for fictions; and
that which troubled them mo<U+017F>t was, to <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>erious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hions
of tho<U+017F>e from whom they had tho<U+017F>e fine relations.
They went on till they came near the little hou<U+017F>e of the
Vine-dre<U+017F><U+017F>er <hi>Bertrand,</hi> whence they <U+017F>aw <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>

you hate us <U+017F>o much Shepherd, that you would be gone and not bid us a diew?
My journey hath not been far, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and be<U+017F>ides, I u<U+017F>e no ceremony to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you: But alas! can I call my <U+017F>elf a Shepherd and not <U+017F>hed tears? <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin</hi>
will tell you I am a Shepherd without Sheep: 'Tis too true, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
Our Ho<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing we came not back in a long time, and that we ought him <U+017F>ome

<U+017F>till in his debt; the poor dumb creatures being <U+017F>o out of ca<U+017F>e that he could make
nothing of them: My Ma<U+017F>ter was much the better to tell him again, that he
<U+017F>hould have kept them for us, and have <U+017F>ent them abroad every day: He told
him he had not the lea<U+017F>ure to do it, that they would have grown wor<U+017F>e and
wor<U+017F>e, and that he had a Vintage to look after. That's the true account of my

misfortune, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> with a <U+017F>ad countenance; this is all the <U+017F>atisfaction I could
get of the ru<U+017F>tick bea<U+017F>t. The wor<U+017F>t on't is, that being unwilling to be at the

him <U+017F>o, that he is run away to get a condition <U+017F>omewhere el<U+017F>e; If I knew

but for that time I was comforted by <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> as being re<U+017F>olved to leave the
place I was in then: As for this Country, the ca<U+017F>e is not the <U+017F>ame, for I intend to
live here alwaies, and in the mean time I <U+017F>hall have nothing to do, having no
flock to look after. You <U+017F>peak as if there were no more <U+017F>heep in the world, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Philiris,</hi> I undertake you <U+017F>hall find enough; you mu<U+017F>t not be troubled for <U+017F>uch

a<U+017F>ide) is that thou ha<U+017F>t not done as I de<U+017F>ired thee by the Lacquay; thou art not
come privately to me that <U+017F>o no body might know where I was, but ha<U+017F>t brought
<hi>Adrian</hi> along, who is the only man in the world that I fear, and whom I de<U+017F>ire
not to be near. I mu<U+017F>t tell you the rea<U+017F>on why I did it, replies <hi>Philiris,</hi> 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e

a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that you will enter into <hi>Shepherdry</hi> as well as we: O what a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Shepherd,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ince you are he among my friends, to whom Authority
hath given me in charge, 'tis fit I give you an account of my actions. It's only
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary we go into the <U+017F>hade; Here we have it, <U+017F>aies <hi>Polidor,</hi> <U+017F>hewing him a
little thicket; but is there no need you feed your own body before you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the minds of others; I and <hi>Carmelin</hi> have ju<U+017F>t now been at a banquet where
a man fears neither poy<U+017F>on nor exce<U+017F>s, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> bread, nuts and grapes which
we bought of the Countrey-people, have been varieties wherewith we have <U+017F>ati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
nature, to reduce our <U+017F>elves to moderation after the <U+017F>umptuous Fea<U+017F>ts at the
Marriages of <hi>Hircan</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme.</hi> A little water taken up in the hollow of the
hand out of the fluid Cri<U+017F>tal of a Fountain hath afterward bani<U+017F>hed our thir<U+017F>t,
in commemoration of that happy time of the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> which knew no other
drink, nor other cup. There needs not much to <U+017F>atisfie the man who bridles his
appetite with his rea<U+017F>on; but he that <U+017F>uffers him<U+017F>elf to be carried away by the
flattery of his <U+017F>ence, though there were a thou<U+017F>and worlds; yet 'twere not enough
to <U+017F>atisfie him. The<U+017F>e indeed are golden words, <U+017F>aies <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was a lover
of Temperance, if you <U+017F>peak thus alwaies, I <U+017F>hall have a better opinion of you
then ever I had yet. He having <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, they made towards the thicket, where
all being <U+017F>ate down on the gra<U+017F>s, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>poke thus.</p>
            <p>Since you are already acquainted with a good part of my life, Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Adrian,</hi>
you de<U+017F>ire not I <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e time in long relations; I <U+017F>hall only tell you briefly
the <U+017F>um of my affairs: Being come into this Countrey with <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor,</hi>
the fir<U+017F>t thing we did was, to go and <U+017F>ee <hi>Leonara</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
hou<U+017F>e, where I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s to you, I love to be above any place, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
lives there, which <hi>Charite</hi> is that incomparable Beauty by whom I have long
<U+017F>ince bin enchanted: The amorous di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es we had together, are un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43725:170"/>
to the pre<U+017F>ent occa<U+017F>ion: It <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffice to tell you that when I parted thence, I
made acquaintance with <hi>Clarimond,</hi> who lives here hard by, one who<U+017F>e di<U+017F>po<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
plea<U+017F>es me extreamly, were it not that he be<U+017F>tows his wit in abu<U+017F>es. The next
day I gave my fair one a <hi>Serenade</hi> with much reputation, for I did wonders on the
Gitarre; but in pur<U+017F>uing a <hi>Hamadryad</hi> that plaid on the Lute, I lo<U+017F>t my way, <U+017F>o
that I lay that night in the fields, which was an adventure rather plea<U+017F>ant then
trouble<U+017F>ome. The next day I met with a Hermit who put me into my way, which
I lo<U+017F>t again, but <U+017F>o fortunately that I met with the Magician <hi>Hircan,</hi> who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
me very courteou<U+017F>ly, did me the honour to let me <U+017F>ee his <hi>Nayad Synopa:</hi>
He afterward changed me into a Maid, and I lived in that condition at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s
with all the content in the world. He after that unchang'd me again, becau<U+017F>e
they would have put me to death upon a fal<U+017F>e accu<U+017F>ation: And awhile after I
met in the fields this <hi>Carmelin,</hi> whom you <U+017F>ee, who told me I was in <hi>Brie,</hi> and
not in <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts;</hi> upon which con<U+017F>ideration, as al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e of his great learning,
I took him into my <U+017F>ervice; and went my waies to <hi>Clarimonds,</hi> re<U+017F>olv'd to have
no more to do with <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and <hi>Montenor,</hi> who had put <U+017F>uch an affront upon
me. I <U+017F>ent to buy Sheep, which done, I went to <hi>Hircans,</hi> where I had almo<U+017F>t
quarrelled with <hi>Fontenay.</hi> I was once like to be impri<U+017F>oned by the Vineyard-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
I received a un<U+017F>atisfactory an<U+017F>wer to a love Letter I <U+017F>ent to <hi>Charite;</hi> and at la<U+017F>t
my afflictions obliged the Gods to change me into a Tree: I could not become a
man again for all <hi>Clarimond</hi> could do; he did nothing but water me to make me
bud forth, and when it was once night, I play'd, I danc'd, I collation'd with t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
Divinities of the Country. <hi>Carmelin</hi> would not believe any of the<U+017F>e miracles,
but I made him ta<U+017F>te part of our entertainments: After this <hi>Hircan</hi> re<U+017F>tored me
to my former <U+017F>hape. I returned again to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s being as much a man as ever I
was, I <U+017F>ent a Letter and a Bill to be po<U+017F>ted up and down, to <hi>Paris,</hi> to invite the
Wits of the times to come and <U+017F>ee me, which hath already had its effect. About
that time I received a heavy <hi>Command without Command</hi> from <hi>Charite,</hi> and was
<U+017F>ick in imitation of her: I met with <hi>Philiris, Polidor,</hi> and <hi>Meliantes,</hi> who were
newly arrived into this Country, and I <U+017F>aw two converted Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenice</hi>
and <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> one is married to <hi>Hircan,</hi> and the other was chang'd into
a great <hi>Stone.</hi> The<U+017F>e brave Shepherds here pre<U+017F>ent have all related their Hi<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to me, which are mo<U+017F>t admirable: They have <U+017F>een the Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors were
<U+017F>ent to me from the Shepherds of <hi>Paris:</hi> We have acted Playes before them, to
<U+017F>hew them how plea<U+017F>antly we pa<U+017F>s away our time; you came hither when we
were at one but <U+017F>ince that, <hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>ent me to an Inchanted Ca<U+017F>tle, whence I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the fair <hi>Pamphilia;</hi> but the dangers I ran through were <U+017F>o great, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
relation is enough to cau<U+017F>e horror: I was fifteen daies in the air with <hi>Carmelin,</hi>
much higher then the region wherein the Meteors are formed; I have bin in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
blacker then the abode of <hi>Pluto:</hi> I have fought with Gyants, <U+017F>o high as that
they might have <U+017F>cal'd heaven without Ladders, and with crump-back'd and
brea<U+017F>ted fellows, who <U+017F>eemed to be made to di<U+017F>grace nature. I overcame al<U+017F>o a
Dragon, which ro<U+017F>e up out of the foam of the Serpent <hi>Python,</hi> which was killed
by <hi>Phoebus.</hi> And the<U+017F>e are my principal adventures, which I am very glad I have
had the occa<U+017F>ion to relate, both that you may believe, aud to rub <hi>Philiris</hi>'s me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
who hath undertaken to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e them into a Book. When it is perfected
you will find the<U+017F>e things better de<U+017F>cribed and more adorn'd; for being to <U+017F>peak
to you in ha<U+017F>te, I have not had the lea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>crue my <U+017F>elf up to any imbelli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having <U+017F>poken thus, <hi>Adrian</hi> was quite be<U+017F>ide him<U+017F>elf to find that what he
<U+017F>aid, an<U+017F>wered to what the other Shepherds had told him. He knew not what to
think of it, and yet he told his Cou<U+017F>in that he did not half under<U+017F>tand his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
becau<U+017F>e his terms were extreamly Poetical. He thereupon takes <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
a<U+017F>ide, and there being no other of whom to enquire the truth of what he de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<U+017F>aid to him, I <U+017F>ee thou ha<U+017F>t the countenance of an hone<U+017F>t fellow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
am I glad my Cou<U+017F>in hath entertained thee, for he mu<U+017F>t have one to help
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43725:170"/>
him in a place which is not his native Countrey. I will do any thing lies in my
power for thy preferment, thou <U+017F>halt in requital only tell me whether all thy
Ma<U+017F>ter hath related be true or no: I <U+017F>hall tell you no more then I know, replies
<hi>Carmelin;</hi> as concerning his transformation into a Tree<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 'twas not <U+017F>o much as he
thought it, for his face could be <U+017F>een; but for the Divinities which vi<U+017F>ited him,
to pa<U+017F>s away the time, I have known by experience but too much of the certainty
thereof, as a puni<U+017F>hment of my incredulity. As for our Combats with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters
they are as true as that I am <hi>Carmelin;</hi> though we got the victory yet did
we receive good blowes, but I cannot <U+017F>hew you any marks to verifie what I <U+017F>ay,
for <hi>Hircan</hi> had made us both, as he cals it, invulnerable, that is to <U+017F>ay, that we
could not be wounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having <U+017F>aid thus, <hi>Adrian</hi> turned to the re<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>aid to them, this
hone<U+017F>t man doth al<U+017F>o confirm what his Ma<U+017F>ter told me; but though I <U+017F>hould
believe all more firmly then I do, yet it but obliges me the more to take him with
me to the good City of <hi>Paris,</hi> for there's not <U+017F>o much danger there, nor any
Mon<U+017F>ters to fight with: If any one have done you wrong, there's ju<U+017F>tice to do
you right; and if a Witch <U+017F>hould change one thing into another, <U+017F>he may be
burnt in the <hi>Greve.</hi> What <U+017F>implicities do you <U+017F>peak, good man? replies <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes,</hi>
if your Cou<U+017F>in hath run any danger for me, he hath done the greate<U+017F>t work
of charity in the world; and be<U+017F>ides that the Gods will reward him, he hath gotten
eternal renown thereby: <U+017F>uch a reputation as his, cannot be too dear bought.
That he hath undergone a Metamorpho<U+017F>is in this Country, and <U+017F>uffered much
affliction, it hath been on occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>o noble, that there's not any but could have
wi<U+017F>hed the <U+017F>ame fortune. 'Tis for love that he <U+017F>ighs, 'tis for love that he weeps;
and which is yet more remarkable! 'tis for the love of the fair <hi>Charite:</hi> would
you forbid him <U+017F>o noble a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion? would you put off humanity to commit <U+017F>uch
a <U+017F>ignal act of brutality? Since you have married the Gentlewoman your wife,
is it to be que<U+017F>tioned whether you love her? If it be <U+017F>o, would you forbid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man that you could not be without your <U+017F>elf: But is it in your power, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mans in the world, to hinder <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to love, <U+017F>ince Nature hath furni<U+017F>hed us with
the precepts thereof from our infancy? All this is well and good, <U+017F>aies <hi>Adrian,</hi>
I know well, that as one hand wa<U+017F>hes the other, and both the face, <U+017F>o the husband
and the wife help one another mutually, and may afterward do good to their whole
race: and this is the rea<U+017F>on why I married, and I <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>orry if my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>in
were <U+017F>o too, nor con<U+017F>equently can I find fault with him for being in love;
but there are many things to be wi<U+017F>hed in his per<U+017F>on, before we entertain any
thoughts of that bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. We have it from <hi>Plutarch</hi> that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> put a note
of Infamy on tho<U+017F>e that did not marry, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin.</hi> They dur<U+017F>t not appear
at the publick Fe<U+017F>tivities, and in mid-winter they were forced to dance naked,
<U+017F>inging a certain Song made in abu<U+017F>e of them<U+017F>elves. Be<U+017F>ides all this, when they
were old, the younger <U+017F>ort of people went before them, and did them no re<U+017F>pect.
Thus you <U+017F>ee how the ancients dete<U+017F>ted <hi>Coelibate,</hi> and de<U+017F>ired nothing <U+017F>o much
as to propagate man, who is the King of all the other creatures. Moreover,
happy marriages make us enjoy on earth the felicity of heaven. Tis all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
we have again<U+017F>t the mi<U+017F>eries of this life: There is no affliction <U+017F>o grievous
which the hearts of a husband and a wife joyn'd together, cannot <U+017F>upport. Thus
the wife of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> having cau<U+017F>ed her hair to be cut off, bore arms as well
as he, which comforted him infinitely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> having ended his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>cratch'd his head a little, as if he would
have made <U+017F>omewhat more come out by the <U+017F>tirring it received from his nails:
This <U+017F>tart of <hi>Carmelin</hi> is not to be wondred at, <U+017F>aies <hi>Philiris,</hi> we know he hath
his common places as a Sergeant of a Company his Halbards. If all his ancient
Lectures came but into his mind, there's no Subject on which he is not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
us: Truly, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> when I heard Marriage <U+017F>poken of, I could
not but out with what was at my tongues end. There's <U+017F>omewhat el<U+017F>e in the
wind, <U+017F>aies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F>s thou ha<U+017F>t a great mind to be married, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43725:171"/>
would<U+017F>t fain have us find out a wife for thee. But not to quit the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e we
were in before; let's <U+017F>peak to <hi>Adrian:</hi> We de<U+017F>ire him to tell us what fault he
finds in his Cou<U+017F>in. He wants many things, replies <hi>Adrian,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially that he
knows neither Trade nor Traffick to get his living by: How <U+017F>hall he maintain a
wife and children? what quality <U+017F>hall he be of in the world? He will be <U+017F>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every where, and taken for an idle per<U+017F>on: 'Tis true, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that <U+017F>ince
man <U+017F>inned, God hath condemned him to get his bread in the <U+017F>weat of his brows:
'tis <U+017F>aid that he that doth not labor <U+017F>hal not eat, and that to do nothing is to do ill;
<U+017F>o <hi>Solomon</hi> <U+017F>ends the idle per<U+017F>on to <U+017F>chool to the <hi>Ant.</hi> Hold thou thy peace <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to him, no body asks thee any thing: Thou wilt anon <U+017F>peak
more again<U+017F>t me then thou can<U+017F>t for me, for thou powre<U+017F>t out thy <U+017F>entences as
they come without any con<U+017F>ideration. Be not thou among tho<U+017F>e that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<U+017F>ome
to me; I am <U+017F>ufficiently afflicted to be far from my expectation, as al<U+017F>o
to <U+017F>ee that my cou<U+017F>in will not be a Shepherd, nor <U+017F>uffer me to be one, as I had
been made believe. Do not impo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ilence on your man, who <U+017F>peaks
<U+017F>o well, replies <hi>Adrian,</hi> I am glad you are with <U+017F>uch a brave Doctor; you have
in him a good preceptor; he would <U+017F>hew you that you ought not to <U+017F>pend your
time here in acting of Comedies and dancing with young maids: 'Twere better
be in <U+017F>ome good imployment, that were the way to find a good match, <U+017F>ince you
are <U+017F>o much in love, for it is <U+017F>aid at <hi>Paris,</hi> That Offices are the Porters that let a
man into the Palace of Marriage. Will you never give over doating, <U+017F>aies <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantes?</hi>
Is not <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in the noble<U+017F>t condition in the world? Is he not one of
the<U+017F>e illu<U+017F>trious Shepherds which we find in the <hi>Arcadia?</hi> That we are clad in
white, is only in imitation of him; he hath undertaken to re<U+017F>tore the felicity of
the fir<U+017F>t age of the world. If you will participate with us, you mu<U+017F>t be a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
as well as he: Otherwi<U+017F>e you mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>till live at <hi>Paris,</hi> where all vices are in
their thrones, and where you are lock'd up to the mercy of afflictions and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets.
The infections are <U+017F>o great, that the Phy<U+017F>ician often dies before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and tho<U+017F>e that carry the dead to the ground, leave them at half way. 'Tis
true, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> Multitude is never without contagion, and what is wor<U+017F>t of
all, there is a plague of <U+017F>ouls as well as of bodies; I de<U+017F>ire my Ma<U+017F>ters pardon
for this word: I'll <U+017F>peak no more. When he <U+017F>peaks only of Shepherdry or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorpho<U+017F>is,
I <U+017F>eem to be ignorant enough; but when it comes to morality, I'll
make it known I am no <U+017F>mall Clark, and therefore 'tis not to be wondred if I lay
hold on any occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>hew my Learning. Every one is glad to <U+017F>hew what he
knows; 'tis I know not how long <U+017F>ince I have <U+017F>poken <U+017F>o much: I pardon thee
<U+017F>ince thou de<U+017F>ire<U+017F>t it <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but do not interrupt any body but to <U+017F>om purpo<U+017F>e.
<hi>Carmelin</hi> ob<U+017F>erves his time to <U+017F>peak very well, <U+017F>aies <hi>Polidor,</hi> it puts me in mind of
tho<U+017F>e pickeerers in an Army, who charge, and fall off, then charge again, <U+017F>o doing
for a many times together.</p>
            <p>Every one was taken with that conceit, and as the Shepherds went on <U+017F>till in
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Pernella</hi> takes her husband a<U+017F>ide, and told him <U+017F>he knew no rea<U+017F>on
why he <U+017F>hould talk <U+017F>o long with people, who <U+017F>eemed to be as great fools as their
Cou<U+017F>in, and that if <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would not return to <hi>Paris,</hi> they mu<U+017F>t were it but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the re<U+017F>t of his friends with it. He an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>ince the day was farr
<U+017F>pent, there was no thinking of going till the morrow, becau<U+017F>e he would not lie
by the way, and that then they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee what were to be done.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Clarimond</hi> who had been abroad upon <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ions pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed
by, and alighted to <U+017F>alute the Shepherds. We are here in a great conte<U+017F>tation,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Fontenay</hi> to him. Here's <hi>Adrian</hi> who would take away from us the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who is the honour of this Country: He will have him by all means
take another cour<U+017F>e of life, and get into <U+017F>ome Office in the City. He is in the
right, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> with a <U+017F>mile, and you that would hinder it, I mu<U+017F>t tell
you you are all fools: That's it we would tell them Sir, cries out <hi>Pernella,</hi> ah!
you are a brave Gentleman. For my part I have been the<U+017F>e three hours with
them, but I dur<U+017F>t not open my mouth, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak to me, for their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43725:171"/>
<U+017F>trange di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es do <U+017F>o amaze me, that I think my <U+017F>elfe in another world. I'll
promi<U+017F>e you Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, continued <hi>Clarimond,</hi> to make them find their wits, before
a few daies be over. They are per<U+017F>ons at lea<U+017F>t of as good quality as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and
yet they will do no good in the world: They entertain them<U+017F>elves with Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
extravagances, and becau<U+017F>e they find your Cou<U+017F>in <U+017F>ick of the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e as
them<U+017F>elves, they love his company. I am now come from a great man in this
Country who hath promi<U+017F>ed me to found an Ho<U+017F>pital purpo<U+017F>ely for them; there
<U+017F>hall they mo<U+017F>t charitably by whipt till this humour be over. May that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
have his hearts de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>aies <hi>Pernella,</hi> he mu<U+017F>t needs be a very devout man,
I would I might <U+017F>peak with him, that I might get him to do <U+017F>omewhat for our
Cou<U+017F>in: We'll talk of it when we meet next, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> at the pre<U+017F>ent I
am <U+017F>omewhat in ha<U+017F>te.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> in <U+017F>aying this went his way, and the Shepherds would <U+017F>till make <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
and his wife believe that they would live in a Pa<U+017F>toral way, and that they were
not out of their wits. They therefore looked very mode<U+017F>tly, and <U+017F>wore that
<hi>Clarimond</hi> him<U+017F>elf was mad, and that it would not be long ere he <U+017F>hould put on
the fools Coat. They advi<U+017F>ed <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> not to walk any more near his Ca<U+017F>tle, nor
take any Pa<U+017F>tures that way if ever he had any <U+017F>heep.</p>
            <p>He thought their councel very good, and <U+017F>o returned cheerfully to <hi>Hircans</hi> with
his Companions and his Cou<U+017F>ins too, <U+017F>ince he could not avoid it. <hi>Fontenay</hi> told
<hi>Hircan</hi> what di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, wherein there wanted not matter to laugh
at. <hi>Adrian</hi> comes to <U+017F>ee <hi>Hircan,</hi> to whom he <U+017F>aid, that he could not but wonder
how a man <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e and <U+017F>o learned as he was, would entertain into his hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch
people as <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and his companions, and that he had met a Gentleman who told
him they were all out of their wits, which was ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>covered by their actions
and words, though <U+017F>ometimes they <U+017F>trived to be very <U+017F>erious. <hi>Hircan</hi> reply'd,
that that Gentleman was deceived, and that he would give him the lie wherever
he met him So <hi>Adrian</hi> was <U+017F>ent back again with little <U+017F>atisfaction: He and his
wife retired to con<U+017F>ult what they <U+017F>hould do, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> did the
like.</p>
            <p>Thou mai<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ily perceive <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that this Cou<U+017F>in of mine who
cals him<U+017F>elf my Guardian, is a mo<U+017F>t importunate fellow: Though I were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to pa<U+017F>s away my time in the Country, yet <U+017F>hould I hardly be brought to
live with him in the City. As for his wife, <U+017F>he is no better then he; I mu<U+017F>t
therefore find out <U+017F>ome way to get them hence, without force or noi<U+017F>e; but the
my<U+017F>tery of all will be at the <U+017F>ame time to accompli<U+017F>h <U+017F>omewhat that may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
me to <hi>Charite</hi> and all po<U+017F>terity. 'Tis there I mu<U+017F>t make appear the very
edg of ingenuity. Without any long preambles, I will in a word tell thee the be<U+017F>t
expedient I know, and that is to counterfeit my <U+017F>elf dead for awhile: <hi>Adrian</hi>
will pre<U+017F>ently return to <hi>Paris,</hi> as having no more to do here: But you do not
con<U+017F>ider, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that he or your heirs will po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s them<U+017F>elves of all you
have, and you <U+017F>hall be forced to beg: I can re-enter into my po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion when I
plea<U+017F>e, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>oon make my <U+017F>elf known: and be<U+017F>ides, though I
had nothing of all my father and mother left me, mu<U+017F>t I be ca<U+017F>t down and fare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the wor<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince that in all <hi>Romances</hi> you will find divers in <U+017F>trange Countries
having nothing in the world, who yet were Princes or Knights, of better hou<U+017F>es
then I am of. They lived only by what they borrowed of good friends whom
they found every where; does that <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange to thee? Do the <hi>Romances</hi> <U+017F>peak
any thing incredible as to that point? Sometimes <hi>Montenor</hi> hath entertained us,
<U+017F>ometimes <hi>Orontes,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Hircan,</hi> nay <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Clarimond,</hi> though he <U+017F>eem
now to be my greate<U+017F>t enemy; and this is a thing not to be pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.
As plainly <U+017F>hewing that all true lovers are favoured by heaven. Thou
<U+017F>ee<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o that <hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi> who are of a Country further di<U+017F>tant hence
then ours, and have nothing of their own, do yet live plentifully enough, by the
courte<U+017F>ie of tho<U+017F>e friends they meet, who are their benefactors. There are in
<U+017F>ome books Lovers mentioned who have lived only upon Roots in the de<U+017F>erts like
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43725:172"/>
Hermits, and divers have been hirelings to Shepherds to get a livelyhood: What
<U+017F>hould hinder but we may do the like if we be brought to that extremity, <U+017F>ince 'tis
no more then we have done for our recreation? You are wi<U+017F>er then I, replies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> and therefore all the an<U+017F>wer I make you is, that I will not contradict
you in any thing, but will be alwaies of your opinion, Hear then what my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne
is, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I will feign my <U+017F>elf dead, both to get away this <hi>Adrian,</hi> and
withall, to find out whether my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s will have any compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on me, and
that's it I aim at principally. Now there's a great difference between <hi>death</hi> and
a <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is;</hi> for I <U+017F>uffered my <U+017F>elf to be metamorpho<U+017F>ed into a Tree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, becau<U+017F>e there was <U+017F>ome hope I might one day be re<U+017F>tored to
my former <U+017F>hape; but as concerning death, when we go that journey we <U+017F>hall
never return: That makes me re<U+017F>olve to die only in je<U+017F>t, for if I <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>patch
my <U+017F>elf as many have done that I could name, 'twere a <U+017F>trange folly, <U+017F>ince 'tis
not beyond hope I may one day be happy. There are a many in your <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
that have killed them<U+017F>elves becau<U+017F>e of the cruelty of their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es; and they
again, <U+017F>ome of them having notice of their death, have murdered them<U+017F>elves after
them, or at lea<U+017F>t have all their lives repented their cruelty and di<U+017F>dain. It may
be <U+017F>een by this, that if tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>perate people had had the wit to feigne death,
they might have been extreamly happy. My intention thereof is <U+017F>o much the
more excellent, and there is now no more to do then to bethink us of the means
to put it in execution. There are <U+017F>ome that hide a piggs bladder full of bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their skins and their <U+017F>hirts, and give them<U+017F>elves a <U+017F>tab there; they fall and
<U+017F>eem to be quite gone, till every one runs to help them; but I do not like that
way: a man might hurt him<U+017F>elf if the Ponyard went a little further then it <U+017F>hould;
but there are other accidents <U+017F>tranger yet; be<U+017F>ides, that when they came to <U+017F>earch
your wound, the cheat would be di<U+017F>covered, which would be <U+017F>candalous and
laught at. I will therefore play my game better if I can. I will take a gla<U+017F>s of
Wine with <U+017F>omewhat in it which every one will conceive to be poi<U+017F>on, and when
I have drunk it off, I will be as <U+017F>tiffe as an iron barre, and will keep in my breath
as if I were dead; a while after thou <U+017F>halt make as if thou ha<U+017F>t buried me, and
the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is done. Now I will lurk <U+017F>omewhere till <hi>Adrian</hi> be gone, and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
being acquainted with my death, <U+017F>hall have time enough to bewayle my lo<U+017F>s.
When thou <U+017F>halt perceive her grief exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive, and that <U+017F>he wi<U+017F>hes from her heart
I were alive again, that <U+017F>he might honour me with her affection, which <U+017F>he had
denied me before, let me know it immediately, that I may go and take her
at her word, and receive the recompence of my afflictions. Now when we are
come thus farre, there are inventions enough to make the world believe I have bin
rais'd again; and thus I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>o much the more ingratiate my <U+017F>elf with <hi>Charite,</hi>
who will look on me as a man highly in favour with the Gods. Thus will I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F>s
my de<U+017F>ire; and what will mo<U+017F>t comfort me is, That I have run through all
the adventures of the be<U+017F>t Hi<U+017F>tories, and that my own will be the mo<U+017F>t accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>h'd
in all the world. As for the <U+017F>tealing away of <hi>Charite,</hi> I think no more
on't; 'tis enough I once had <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>igne. My thoughts are now all taken up
with my feigned death; perhaps 'twill be generally believed that I was dead in
deed, and was rai<U+017F>ed again; <U+017F>o that <hi>Philiris</hi> <U+017F>hall not mention it as a fiction in
his book, or if he do, he <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak of it as an opinion of <U+017F>ome few but which he
<U+017F>hall condemn as erroneous, affirming my death to have been real.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>aid this, he thought little of <hi>Polidors</hi> being behind him, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. This Shepherd having heard <hi>Li<U+017F>is</hi> his de<U+017F>igne, retired as if
he had heard nothing, and re<U+017F>olved to give notice to his Companions, that they
might act their parts well when the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s came upon the Stage. As for <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melin,</hi>
his Ma<U+017F>ters enterpri<U+017F>e, to him, was very indifferent, for he thought better
to do <U+017F>o then lo<U+017F>e him quite, which haply he had done if <hi>Adrian</hi> had taken him
away to <hi>Paris.</hi> He therefore promi<U+017F>ed him his utmo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and <U+017F>o they
went both to <hi>Hircan. Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> came thither at the <U+017F>ame time to
know whether they might be gone with their Cou<U+017F>in the next day; <hi>Hircan</hi> told
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43725:172"/>
them that after three daies they <U+017F>hould have him away, de<U+017F>iring in that time, to
<U+017F>atisfie him<U+017F>elf with his conver<U+017F>ation; <hi>Pernella</hi> told him they could not <U+017F>tay <U+017F>o
long, that it was a good while <U+017F>ince they had been from home, and that they had
left in the Shop but one Prentice of who<U+017F>e fidelity they were not over-confident.
<hi>Hircan</hi> regarded not much the<U+017F>e remon<U+017F>trances, and while <hi>Pernella</hi> was thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up, <hi>Fontenay</hi> who had bethought him<U+017F>elf of a new invention to make <U+017F>port,
<U+017F>ate down in a chair, whence he pronounced the<U+017F>e words with a langui<U+017F>hing voice,
What my bright Sun, <U+017F>aies he, will you leave us already? Would you <U+017F>hine in
another hemi<U+017F>phere, whence you will never return? Ala<U+017F>s, 'tis fit the
world be all <U+017F>erved by degrees: Why will you for<U+017F>ake me fair <hi>Pernella,</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of this age; life of my <U+017F>oul, what will you return to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to be
the Pearl of your Quarter? Continue rather in this Country, where you <U+017F>hall
receive greater honours; I will make Ver<U+017F>es of you <U+017F>hall make you famous over
all the world, and you will be more talked of then <hi>Petrarch's Laura.</hi> If the fair
<hi>Cytherea</hi> be <U+017F>ometimes drawn by Swanns; I would have you like that Godde<U+017F>s,
and I will be your <U+017F>weet <U+017F>inging Swan to draw your glorious Chariot. What
do you think on dear Cou<U+017F>in, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan,</hi> have you forgot you are married?
have you lo<U+017F>t all remembrance of the fair <hi>Theodora</hi> your wife? You mu<U+017F>t love
her eternally, you mu<U+017F>t not be incon<U+017F>tant: When I married her, I was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <hi>Pernella,</hi> replies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> had I known her, I <U+017F>hould have
loved none but her: 'tis <U+017F>he that is de<U+017F>tined for me, let <hi>Adrian</hi> turn her over to
me, I earne<U+017F>tly intreat him, and let him look after <hi>Theodora,</hi> he <U+017F>hall have her
in exchange that he may have no occa<U+017F>ion to complain: What trick is this put
on me? cries out <hi>Adrian,</hi> am I come among a <U+017F>ort of Adulterers? what vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
is this to propo<U+017F>e to me the greate<U+017F>t ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>e in the world! I will have my
wife and my Cou<U+017F>in together; if I <U+017F>hall not be <U+017F>uffered to take them away, I will
bring the power of ju<U+017F>tice to do it. You do not con<U+017F>ider where you are when
you <U+017F>peak this, <U+017F>aies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> no Officer dares come within three miles about of
this place. There are in this hou<U+017F>e charms that can reduce them all to du<U+017F>t:
There came hither one once and took one of <hi>Hircans</hi> men by the chollar, his
hand pre<U+017F>ently fell off, and <U+017F>ome Sergeants being <U+017F>omewhat incivil, were all fa<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <U+017F>takes, and after they were rubb'd well with oyle and brim<U+017F>tone, they
burned a long time to give light to Travellers in the night.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Meliantes</hi> <U+017F>aid this, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> asked <hi>Hircan</hi> whether he and <hi>Carmelin</hi> were
<U+017F>till invulnerable, and whether for his own part, he had not lo<U+017F>t that priviledge
by putting off his Heroick Coat: <hi>Hircan</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him he had not, <U+017F>o that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to defend him<U+017F>elf couragiou<U+017F>ly, if any Sergeants pre<U+017F>umed to touch his
body to carry him away to <hi>Paris.</hi> There came up on this occa<U+017F>ion a fre<U+017F>h ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
into his mind, which he never had before: he would needs know how
<hi>Hircan</hi> could a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him he was invulnerable, <U+017F>ince he was wonnded every day by
the darts of love: <hi>Hircan</hi> told him it was true indeed, that love had wounded
him, but that it was before he had made u<U+017F>e of his charms, and that be<U+017F>ides, he had
promi<U+017F>ed only to fortifie his body again<U+017F>t the <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> but not again<U+017F>t the
<hi>Arrows</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> which are <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall that they are invi<U+017F>ible, and pierce in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly
through the eyes even to the heart. This <U+017F>atisfied <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and being retired with
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> he told him he was very glad to know he was as invulnerable as when
they were in the Ca<U+017F>tle of <hi>Anaximander;</hi> and there's one thing, <U+017F>aies he, will
much promote my de<U+017F>igne, which is, when I have taken the poi<U+017F>on, it will be <U+017F>aid
that in regard I could not be hurt in any part of the body, and that <U+017F>words
and daggers could do no good upon me, I could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly die but by a drink.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> approved this, and in the mean time <hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Adrian</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
mad for anger, entertained him with this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. You are to
con<U+017F>ider my good friend, <U+017F>ayes he to him, that you are now among
<hi>Shepherds,</hi> who<U+017F>e principal profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion is to love: All their books <U+017F>peak of nothing
el<U+017F>e; they know nothing el<U+017F>e, and therefore be not offended at their too free di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es;
they are a <U+017F>ort of people that are much given to the exerci<U+017F>e of the pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43725:173"/>
and will be in the pur<U+017F>uit of a woman ten years, <U+017F>o that at the end of <U+017F>uch
a term <U+017F>he requite them with a piece of old ribbond wherewith <U+017F>he have tied up
her hair: They are not impudent as you think them: their Laws are again<U+017F>t it:
they do not <U+017F>peak to their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es but they tremble; and if they de<U+017F>ired to
touch her bre<U+017F>t, fear would <U+017F>o benum them, that their hands would grow <U+017F>tiff at
half way. I have a wife as well as you, but if fifty Shepherds, <U+017F>uch as <hi>Fontenay,</hi>
<U+017F>hould be in love with her, I <U+017F>hould have never a worm the more in my head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
I know he is the fearfulle<U+017F>t man in the world; and be<U+017F>ides, that he hath the
reputation to be impotent; you mu<U+017F>t in your <U+017F>elf laugh at <U+017F>uch a mans pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
yet make as if you were angry before him, that he may not take you for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
fool: if you carry your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o, I believe you cannot do ami<U+017F>s, and you
may afterward tell <U+017F>tories of your Lovers affections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> was not <U+017F>atisfied with the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons, nor indeed did <hi>Hircan</hi> endeavour
much to appea<U+017F>e him; what he had <U+017F>aid to him was by way of abu<U+017F>e. <hi>Adrian</hi>
therefore was extreamly troubled, and though his wife had turned over thirty,
and was black and lean, yet did he think her hand<U+017F>ome, and was a little jealous:
'twas an infinite plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ee him ever and anon look towards <hi>Fontenay,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
what countenance he made on <hi>Pernella.</hi> This feigned Lover having fetcht
three or four deep <U+017F>ighs, fell down all along upon chairs as if he had <U+017F>wouded,
whereat his companions <U+017F>eem'd much troubled, rubbing his temples, and ca<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
water on his face.</p>
            <p>When they had brought him to him<U+017F>elf again, he for a long time <U+017F>tared on all
that were about him, Ala<U+017F>s! my dear friends, <U+017F>aid he, why have you <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
the <U+017F>weet exta<U+017F>ie? My mind plea<U+017F>ed it <U+017F>elf in the Ideas of all worldly
plea<U+017F>ures, and now it knows nothing real but its own affliction: I burn witout
hope of enjoyment, for an ungratefull woman, that hath not vouch<U+017F>afed me <U+017F>o
much as a look, <U+017F>ince I have declared my affection to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> upon this, <U+017F>aid that <U+017F>ince he was <U+017F>o ill he were be<U+017F>t be had to bed, which
made his companions lead him to his chamber, making a thou<U+017F>and extravagant
po<U+017F>tures. Thus the<U+017F>e Gentlemen, <U+017F>ince they became acquainted with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> were
<U+017F>o accu<U+017F>tomed to abu<U+017F>e him, that they abu<U+017F>ed one another, and would not <U+017F>pare
<hi>Adrian</hi> nor his wife, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing their minds of the <U+017F>ame mettal with their Cou<U+017F>in,
and that <U+017F>implicity was entailed on the whole race from generation to generation.</p>
            <p>There was only <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> that <U+017F>taid with <hi>Hircan,</hi> who began to bring afre<U+017F>h into
his mind the plea<U+017F>ures of their former life, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Adrian</hi> was pre<U+017F>ent, whom he
would al<U+017F>o per<U+017F>wade that the <U+017F>hepherds life was the mo<U+017F>t happy. In the mean time
<hi>Carmelin</hi> took occa<U+017F>ion to go and <U+017F>ee <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> who was alone in her Chamber,
where <U+017F>he asking him what the other Shepherds had done <U+017F>ince they were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
He an<U+017F>wered, that he knew not what to <U+017F>ay of them, and that they knew not
what they did them<U+017F>elves, they were <U+017F>o in love. And is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>Carmelin</hi> can be,
and not be in love? Truly Madam, reply'd he, <U+017F>ince I have ever found you my
good friend, I will freely tell you what my heart thinks. A man mu<U+017F>t once in his
life at lea<U+017F>t, di<U+017F>cover what his inclinations are. 'Tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I may be in love,
but not with <hi>Parthenice:</hi> Were I a <U+017F>tone like her whom my Ma<U+017F>ter will have me
love, 'twere not ami<U+017F>s I were joyned to her; but then <U+017F>hould I not love her nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and thus would I rea<U+017F>on; I would <U+017F>ay, that in <U+017F>uch a condition I could
neither receive nor return any thing of love. Let every thing love what's like
it, let <U+017F>tones be in love with <U+017F>tones, gra<U+017F>s with gra<U+017F>s, plants with plants, and let
the vine if it will, clime up an elme: I have often heard it <U+017F>aid that this is done
by a certain <U+017F>ympathy of nature, who<U+017F>e de<U+017F>igne is to joyn all things together: But
it makes for me, whatever my Ma<U+017F>ter <U+017F>aies; I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>in again<U+017F>t nature if I <U+017F>hould
not love what were of my own <U+017F>pecies: It <U+017F>ignifies much indeed, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> tels
me that Ivie <U+017F>cales the walls to <U+017F>hew it loves <U+017F>tones, and that I <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>o too,
as having <U+017F>ome relation to the Ivie, <U+017F>ince I repre<U+017F>ented <hi>Bacchus.</hi> This was the
<U+017F>ubject of our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e this morning, where we were alone; but my full and
final an<U+017F>wer was, that I was a man, and could eat and drink, and not Ivie, good
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43725:173"/>
for nothing but to clap on i<U+017F><U+017F>ues. He thereupon told me, that to puni<U+017F>h my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Ivie, the Gods would change me into that plant, and that he
thought the part I plaid in the pa<U+017F>times of the Vintage, was a great pre<U+017F>age there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<U+017F>ince I was then compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed about with branches which I <U+017F>hould one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
bear. At la<U+017F>t, <hi>quoth he,</hi> 'tis the mo<U+017F>t convenient Metamorpho<U+017F>is for thee, and
<hi>quoth he,</hi> thou art to hope no le<U+017F>s. I have given over, <hi>quoth he,</hi> the de<U+017F>igne of
changing thee into a Fountain, as I once thought, <hi>quoth he,</hi> when I thought it fit
thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t water the bottom of the beloved rock. It will be more proper,
<hi>quoth he,</hi> that thou be Ivie, that <hi>quoth he,</hi> thou mai<U+017F>t climb up the rock of <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and embrace it, <hi>quoth he,</hi> with thy branches. Your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e indeed is not
ami<U+017F>s, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aies <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> interrupting him, but I mu<U+017F>t tell you one
thing, if you did not u<U+017F>e that <hi>quoth he,</hi> <U+017F>o often, you would do better: I have
often heard you u<U+017F>e that kind of expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which is not good, for that repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is <U+017F>uperfluous: but yet I would not tell you <U+017F>o much till now that we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
I am obliged to you for being <U+017F>o tender as to the ornament of my lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
replies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> for it is a <U+017F>igne you will <U+017F>hew me favour in things of
more importance: but I mu<U+017F>t tell you it is not without rea<U+017F>on that I repeat the
word <hi>quoth he,</hi> <U+017F>o often; for 'tis to let you know that it was not I, but my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>uch a thing: if I dur<U+017F>t, I would not clo<U+017F>e up every period, but <U+017F>econd
every word with it, that you may not be mi<U+017F>taken; and know that all I tell you,
is by way of allegation. I <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry you <U+017F>hould think I my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>aid
that it was convenient for me to be metamorpho<U+017F>ed into Ivie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amaryllis</hi> laught at this very heartily, and confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that <hi>Carmelin</hi>'s excu<U+017F>e
was extream plea<U+017F>ant, and thought that no other body could have had the wit
to imagin <U+017F>uch a one, though many in their relations u<U+017F>ed the like repetition, and
that as frequently: However <U+017F>he told him, that if he was troubled to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that his Ma<U+017F>ters di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es were not his, it <U+017F>ignified he did not e<U+017F>teem him
much: You'll pardon me there, <U+017F>aies <hi>Carmelin,</hi> but I mu<U+017F>t tell you freely, that
my Ma<U+017F>ter <U+017F>peaks many things which a man mu<U+017F>t not believe, which proceeds
from that di<U+017F>turbance of mind he is in by rea<U+017F>on of his love, and in this he will not
contradict me, for it were not for his credit. Since you will not believe him,
<U+017F>aies <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> what is your de<U+017F>igne then? 'Tis only that I dare not declare
my <U+017F>elf, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould be thought uncon<U+017F>tant, reply'd <hi>Carmelin;</hi> as for your part
Madam you know partly what I would <U+017F>ay: I would to God I had <U+017F>een <hi>Li<U+017F>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
before <hi>Parthenice!</hi> I <U+017F>ay no more. You would tell me, <U+017F>aies <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> that
if you had fallen in love with <hi>Li<U+017F>etta</hi> before <hi>Parthenice,</hi> you <U+017F>hould have been
<U+017F>ent to the former, which you would have been glad of, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he were the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
company. I have found out an expedient in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of yours, for <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
having related to me all your adventures, told me how that one night, being
with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> while he was a Tree there was a Nymph called <hi>Lucida,</hi> who <U+017F>aid that
you <U+017F>hould have for Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s the greater of the <hi>Hamadriads</hi> which were in the
Company: She that was <U+017F>poken of was <hi>Li<U+017F>etta,</hi> who is now re<U+017F>tored to her
former <U+017F>hape. Now it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>aid that you have been in love with her ever <U+017F>ince
that time; and that all the hurt you have <U+017F>aid of her <U+017F>ince, was only to <U+017F>hew
how far you were <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the <U+017F>mart of your whipping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> was almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elf at this good councel, which he was the
gladder to receive from <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> becau<U+017F>e 'twas <U+017F>he had been the Fountain
<hi>Lucida:</hi> She was thanked with almo<U+017F>t as many conges as words, whereupon
<hi>Carmelin</hi> left her and returned to his Ma<U+017F>ter, to whom he <U+017F>aid that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
a great <U+017F>ecret from him out of a certain fearfullne<U+017F>s, but that he could hide
it no longer. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> told him he <U+017F>hould be glad to hear it, <U+017F>o that <hi>Carmelin</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him, that he had been in love with <hi>Li<U+017F>etta,</hi> <U+017F>ince the time <U+017F>he was an
<hi>Hamadryad,</hi> and that he had obeyed the command he had received from <hi>Lucida</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> having <U+017F>aid this, retired, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> pre<U+017F>umed to ask his Ma<U+017F>ter what
were the mo<U+017F>t certain and remarkable pre<U+017F>ages be<U+017F>ides the flight of birds; He
told him that when a man undertook any bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, he mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve the per<U+017F>ons
he fir<U+017F>t met, and what di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he had with them, or <U+017F>ome other circum<U+017F>tance,
and thence make <U+017F>ome conjecture at what may happen. <hi>Carmelin</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
able enough for this; and <U+017F>o leaving his Ma<U+017F>ter to his melancholick thoughts,
he would go and <U+017F>ee his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, but before-hand would trie <U+017F>ome pre<U+017F>age,
thereby to know the end of his loves: he went into a place where he found a maid
heating the oven, which having acquainted his Ma<U+017F>ter with, he told him that
that maid repre<U+017F>ented <hi>Li<U+017F>etta,</hi> who had put fire into his bre<U+017F>t; and as for the bread
<U+017F>he put in to bake, that <U+017F>hewed that the fair one <U+017F>hould participate of his flames,
and <U+017F>hould give him her heart to heat. This good pre<U+017F>age could no le<U+017F>s then <U+017F>tir
up <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to <U+017F>eek <U+017F>uch another; but he would go more ceremonially to work, and
the many other de<U+017F>ignes he had to bring about, diverted him from thinking on
this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> being over head and ears in love, would needs trie one more whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he could meet with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. He came down into a Parlor where he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43725:174"/>
found <hi>Amaryllis</hi> talking with three Countrey-peoyle, who had brought her <U+017F>ome
wheat which they ought her for rent. There was a napkin laid at the Tables end,
with a piece of <U+017F>alt pork, the better to make them ta<U+017F>te a gla<U+017F>s of wine. <hi>Amaryl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
bid <hi>Carmelin</hi> do as they did, which he would not be entreated twice to do, <U+017F>uch
was his fear to be trouble<U+017F>ome.</p>
            <p>Being all four at Table, there was a Lacquay filled them <U+017F>ome wine, and laid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man his gla<U+017F>s at his trencher; <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>eeing the others did nothing but
eat, and were not yet di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to drink, as being not <U+017F>o bold before <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> he
who had a greater gift of confidence, took his gla<U+017F>s that <U+017F>ate next him, and drank
it clearly off. This it may be was a mi<U+017F>take, for that gla<U+017F>s <U+017F>tood as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; but awaile after he took anothers gla<U+017F>s and did the like, <U+017F>o that for
this there could be no excu<U+017F>e; it is to be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed that he <U+017F>eeing he came off <U+017F>o
well, no body <U+017F>aying ought to him, would needs try to <U+017F>hew the <U+017F>ame trick for
the third: He took therefore the third mans gla<U+017F>s, and di<U+017F>patched it <U+017F>o neatly,
that there remained not <U+017F>o much left, as to make a ruby on the nail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> who in the mean time looked out at the window, turns towards
them, and <U+017F>eeing that the Country-men had taken off their gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi>
only <U+017F>tood full before him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> <U+017F>he thought they had all drunk but he: Why
do you not drink <hi>Carmelin,</hi> <U+017F>aies <U+017F>he to him? you are too ba<U+017F>hfull. Upon this
the Country-men began to murmur, and <hi>Carmelin</hi> to laugh. What would
the<U+017F>e good people <U+017F>ay, continued <hi>Amaryllis;</hi> the Lacquay who had <U+017F>een <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
play the trick, went and acquainted his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: She thought it a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant
one, yet asked the feigned mode<U+017F>t man, why he would drink others mens
wine? he an<U+017F>wered, That he thought they would not drink any, and that for
his part who had much need of it, he had taken it without <U+017F>aying ought, becau<U+017F>e
he was loath to trouble any body to fill <U+017F>o often. Having <U+017F>atisfied him<U+017F>elf, ro<U+017F>e
from the Table, and the Countrey-men had other wine. If <hi>Amaryllis</hi> excu<U+017F>ed
<hi>Carmelins</hi> drunkenne<U+017F>s, the Lacquay who had <U+017F>een it did not; nor had he <U+017F>uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it but to <U+017F>ee his impudence, and he made it his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to relate this action to
his Comrades, to enrage them the more again<U+017F>t him: Nor was this all they had
to <U+017F>ay to him, for they could not but be envious to <U+017F>ee <hi>Carmelin,</hi> who was but a
<U+017F>ervant no more then them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>peak as confidently to their Ma<U+017F>ter as if he had
been his companion, be<U+017F>ides, they could not brook to <U+017F>ee him at Table every
day with Gentlemen of quality; and their greate<U+017F>t regret was, that they were
forced to <U+017F>erve one that was no better then them<U+017F>elves, and pre<U+017F>ented him with
wine as the re<U+017F>t. Upon this occa<U+017F>ion they all entred into a league again<U+017F>t him,
which may teach us not to wonder <U+017F>o much to find envie in Kings Courts, <U+017F>ince
it can find room under the roof of a Country-Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Being therefore at <U+017F>upper, the <U+017F>ervants minded not <hi>Carmelins</hi> drink, whereas
at other times they were wont to pre<U+017F>ent him before he asked for it. He <U+017F>hak'd
his head as he looked on one of the Lacquays, to tell him be wanted <U+017F>omewhat,
but the Lacquay looking on him as <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, <U+017F>hook his head as the other did: If
<hi>Carmelin</hi> made any <U+017F>igne with his hand, the other made the like, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lacquays did the like whenever he made any addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to them: For they
were re<U+017F>olved to puni<U+017F>h him now, for having drunk too much at collation. When
the fruits were <U+017F>erved up he was <U+017F>o drie, that he would have cry'd out for drink,
but that he was loath to make any noi<U+017F>e: He therefore ro<U+017F>e from the Table, and
went and drank at the <U+017F>ide-Table him<U+017F>elf. <hi>Hircan</hi> taking notice of it, <U+017F>aid that
he would have him waited on as well as the re<U+017F>t, and that he would not have his
men think them<U+017F>elves his fellows, becau<U+017F>e he was neither waiting-man nor groom,
but might be rank'd among Gentlemen dependants, as being received into an a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ociation
of Shepherdry with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This troubled the <U+017F>ervants extreamly, but for the pre<U+017F>ent there was no further
tumult. <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> <U+017F>ate at <hi>Hircans</hi> Table, and <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who <U+017F>till plaid
the di<U+017F>contented per<U+017F>on. After a <U+017F>hort walk in the Garden, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi>
were di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed to bed, and for <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife, they might when they pleas'd
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43725:175"/>
have done the like. <hi>Adrian</hi> had all <U+017F>upper time ob<U+017F>erved whether <hi>Fontenay</hi> did
not out of affection drink out of the <U+017F>ame gla<U+017F>s as <hi>Pernella,</hi> or trod not on her foot
to appoint the time. He had all the while been in <U+017F>he like di<U+017F>quiets, <U+017F>uch was his
jealou<U+017F>ie, and as they walked, he was almo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olved to tye her to a lethern gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
he wore on his doublet, le<U+017F>t any body might take her away from him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therefore <U+017F>een her a bed in the chamber a<U+017F><U+017F>igned them, he <U+017F>earcht under
the bed, and on the bed-<U+017F>tead, nay under the very feather bed and mat, behind
it, and in the chimney, to <U+017F>ee if <U+017F>ome body were not hidden there. Finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
he made fa<U+017F>t the dore with a bar, and be<U+017F>ides put a Cupboard again<U+017F>t it;
and yet he did not think him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>afe enough, as fearing there might be <U+017F>ome
body locked up in a great che<U+017F>t which was near the window, who might force his
wife, for he was not only jealous of <hi>Fontenay,</hi> but of all the other Shepherds.
At la<U+017F>t finding the Che<U+017F>t emptie, he laid him<U+017F>elf by <hi>Pernella's</hi> <U+017F>ide.</p>
            <p>He was no <U+017F>ooner a bed, but <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who was re<U+017F>olved to make what <U+017F>port he
could with him, comes to the dore and <U+017F>ings a Court-air with a langui<U+017F>hing voice,
as if he had been ready to dye for love. <hi>Hircan</hi> helped him with his Lute, and a
while after, the other Shepherds and <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>hare in the <U+017F>port,
made an excellent con<U+017F>ort with them. They <U+017F>ung all manner of <U+017F>ongs, and that
in <U+017F>uch abundance, that <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> were almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>tunn'd with the noi<U+017F>e.
When they had given over, <hi>Fontenay</hi> fetch'd three or four <U+017F>ighes, and made this
complaint.</p>
            <p>Mu<U+017F>t then another be ma<U+017F>ter of her whom. I cannot be <U+017F>ervant to? Mu<U+017F>t ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
body enjoy my <U+017F>oul? Ah my Faire<U+017F>t! why do you <U+017F>light me? There is
<U+017F>uch a Nymph of <hi>Diana</hi> that loves me better then her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. There are tho<U+017F>e
that run after me, and offer me all that I offer you; but I re<U+017F>erve my <U+017F>elf for you
alone. If you will grant me nothing, yet refu<U+017F>e not my heart, which I pre<U+017F>ent
unto you. Do me the favour to accept it, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me only by one word of
your mouth, that you do it: Let your fair lips, who<U+017F>e motion is the re<U+017F>t of the
ear, neatly pronounce what they ought to <U+017F>ay to me. Though you lo<U+017F>e nothing
thereby, yet I <U+017F>hall think my <U+017F>elf a great gainer.</p>
            <p>The Shepherd <hi>Fontenay</hi> uttered a many other amorous di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<U+017F>ung with the re<U+017F>t. <hi>Adrian</hi> in the mean time <U+017F>wore he would be gone the
next day, though he left <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> behind him; and that he would <U+017F>ue for reparation
for the affronts done him. The more he <U+017F>poke, the greater noi<U+017F>e did they make,
that it might encrea<U+017F>e his madne<U+017F>s that he was not heard.</p>
            <p>This diver<U+017F>ion having la<U+017F>ted above an hour, the company of Mu<U+017F>itians per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him to <U+017F>leep. The good mans ears was <U+017F>o <U+017F>tunn'd, that he thought he
<U+017F>hould be deaf, as he had been before: however the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>quiets were not <U+017F>o great
but they <U+017F>uffered him to take <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>t. Being gotten up the next day, as he came
down to <U+017F>ee if there were anymeans to be gone, <hi>Carmelin</hi> comes out of his ma<U+017F>ters
chamber, and told the other Shepherds that he was very <U+017F>ick. <hi>Fontenay</hi> and his
companions went thither immediately, and <hi>Adrian</hi> with them, but his wife was
not with him; for he had locked her in the chamber while <U+017F>he was a dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing.
A while after, <hi>Hircan</hi> comes in; and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing all that company, <U+017F>ate up in his
bed and began this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Gods have at length had compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on me, and delivered me out of
<hi>Adrians</hi> tyrannie. See they have <U+017F>ent me a <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s which I <U+017F>hall never recover.
He that having <U+017F>ometime been a tree, ought to have hard fle<U+017F>h: He who hath
been invulnerable, who hath quelled <U+017F>o many Mon<U+017F>ters; and he la<U+017F>tly, who
thought him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o re<U+017F>erved to re<U+017F>tore the earth to its fir<U+017F>t felicitie, behold he is
beaten down by the fir<U+017F>t approaches of a feaver that have a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted him. Fear
not that <U+017F>ayes <hi>Hircan,</hi> be of good courage; what ails you? will you have any
thing to breakfa<U+017F>t? I have an extreme head-ach replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but I think that
when I have drunk a little wine, I <U+017F>hall be able to <U+017F>uffer my pain more patiently
and more chearfully.</p>

<U+017F>aid, that if it were a feaver, it would encrea<U+017F>e it; but <hi>Hircan</hi> having felt his pul<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>aid he had yet no feaver, and that he might have what he de<U+017F>ired. <hi>Carmelin</hi> had
wine ready in a little bottle, he brought him a gla<U+017F>s of it. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> drank it off <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as if he avoided the ta<U+017F>ting of it, and when he had done, he made <U+017F>uch wry faces
as if it had been phy<U+017F>ick, and after that, he continued his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e thus:</p>
            <p>My dear friends, be not amazed that I have with <U+017F>ome trouble taken down this
wine, though I gave it no long time to <U+017F>tay in my palate: it is becau<U+017F>e it hath <U+017F>uch
a lewd ta<U+017F>te, that if all the drink in the world were <U+017F>uch, you would dye for thir<U+017F>t
rather then ta<U+017F>te any. 'Tis not but that the Territorie of <hi>Brie</hi> is favourable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to the wines, for the wines of this Country, is in its nature good: but it is
becau<U+017F>e I have made it otherwi<U+017F>e on purpo<U+017F>e, and having a de<U+017F>ign to dye, I put in
the la<U+017F>t night a certain poi<U+017F>on which I had carryed about me a long time to make
u<U+017F>e of, as I have, when any occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elf. And if you de<U+017F>ire
to know more particularly why I would at this pre<U+017F>ent di<U+017F>patch my <U+017F>elf, it is not
only to avoid going to <hi>Paris</hi> with <hi>Adrian,</hi> but al<U+017F>o to obey the command of my
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. When I asked her a while <U+017F>ince, what Laws I <U+017F>hould ob<U+017F>erve under her
Empire, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered me roughly, <hi>I command you not to obey me any more.</hi> I had
much adoe to under<U+017F>tand this command, and therefore propo<U+017F>ed the difficultie
of it to <hi>Carmelin</hi> and <hi>Clarimond.</hi> All I could gather from their an<U+017F>wer was that
I <U+017F>hould not obey <hi>Charite</hi> in that command which charged me not to obey her,
and contradicted it <U+017F>elf; and that I was only to regard her former commands,
taking this to <U+017F>ignifie nothing. This <U+017F>ubtle explication had <U+017F>ome appearance of truth
and I was <U+017F>atisfied with it for wantof a better. But it being not in my power to
<U+017F>peak with <hi>Charite,</hi> to have one from her own mouth, I had a day or two <U+017F>ince,
a certain in<U+017F>piration which hath given me all the <U+017F>atisfaction I de<U+017F>ired. Methinks
I hear it <U+017F>till in my ear, telling me that all tho<U+017F>e who have offered at any explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Charites</hi> command, under<U+017F>tood nothing in it, and that there is no doubt
but to have commanded me not to obey her any more, was as much as to bid me
dye as <U+017F>oon as I could, and not be any longer <U+017F>ubject to her laws. Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that is unworthy to <U+017F>erve her, dye; and in his death will be found the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of that inviolable Commandement. <hi>I command you,</hi> <U+017F>ayes <hi>Charite</hi> to me,
that word tells me I ought to obey her, and that according to her good plea<U+017F>ure
I <U+017F>hould dye. That is a thing <U+017F>oon doon, and as for the other part which will
have me <hi>to obey her no more,</hi> that will be executed when my <U+017F>oul and body are <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.
This argues not but that I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>till love <hi>Carite</hi> even in the other
world, but becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hall be nothing but an unprofitable <U+017F>hade uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do her any <U+017F>ervice, it may be conceived I <U+017F>hall obey her no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having ended this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, began to roll his eyes in his head and to
<U+017F>eign tremblings; <U+017F>o that <hi>Adrian</hi> was in a pittiful taking, and asked <hi>Carmelin</hi>
whether it were true his Ma<U+017F>ter had put any poi<U+017F>on into the wine he had drunk.
I am <U+017F>ure <U+017F>ayes <hi>Carmelin,</hi> that I having brought this bottle hither la<U+017F>t night, not
knowing what occa<U+017F>ion there might be of it, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> put I know not what into it:
But wretch that I am I was not <U+017F>o careful as to ask him what it was, and yet it
will be <U+017F>aid that I am partly a cau<U+017F>e of his death, by rea<U+017F>on of my negligence.
Be<U+017F>ides that it breaks my heart, when I think he took that mortal draught from
my hand, O heavens! why would you <U+017F>uffer it?</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>eem to be extreamly troubled according to the directions
of his Ma<U+017F>ter, and <hi>Adrian</hi> amazed as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, turned to <hi>Hircan,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
him to apply <U+017F>ome remedy to his poor Cou<U+017F>in, and to <U+017F>end for an
Apothecarie that might give him <U+017F>omewhat to make him ca<U+017F>t up what he had
taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> and all the <U+017F>hepherds who had been acquainted by <hi>Polidor</hi> of the di<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> made as if they were extremely troubled; and one of them
tells <hi>Adrian</hi> that he knew not of any means to give his Cou<U+017F>in an Antidote,
though the Apothecary had brought any, becau<U+017F>e he being re<U+017F>olved to die, would
never take it. Yet <hi>Hircan</hi> made as if he would <U+017F>end a Lacquay to the City for
that purpo<U+017F>e.</p>

               <hi>In the mean time</hi> Ly<U+017F>is <hi>having trembled a great while, pronounced the<U+017F>e words
with a dying voice.</hi> A certain benummedne<U+017F>s begins to <U+017F>eize my noble<U+017F>t parts; I am
gone my friends. Farewel Shepherds, choo<U+017F>e out one from among you, who being the
mo<U+017F>t illu<U+017F>trious, may give you lawes. If my advice be of any weight with you, take
<hi>Philiris.</hi> I believe the <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians</hi> that are to come, will be much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed not to find
me; but there is no remedy, I mu<U+017F>t obey my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s one moment, that I may obey her
no more: I will execute her command without command. As for your part Cou<U+017F>in,
you are partly the cau<U+017F>e why I embrace death, for <U+017F>eeing that you would needs carry
me to <hi>Paris,</hi> it <U+017F>hould be my endeavour to dye, though I received no occa<U+017F>ion as being
de<U+017F>irous to end my dayes here, that I may have the honour to be buried by my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and in <U+017F>pight of your teeth remain in this happy country.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>lides down into the bed, as if he had fainted; and
after he had fetched <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ighes, he turned to the other <U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>poke no more.
He kept him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much from moving and taking his breath aloud, that the <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
concluded he was dead, who was the deare<U+017F>t friend they had in the world
<hi>Carmelin</hi> ca<U+017F>ting him<U+017F>elf on his bed, cryed out, Alas my poor Ma<U+017F>ter! why
would you dye in the flower of your age? you might have yet a good while
enjoyed the plea<U+017F>ures of life. Ah! <U+017F>ince he is dead that comforted us all in
our afflictions, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Fontenay,</hi> it is fit I dye too. He hath <U+017F>hewed me the way,
I am not le<U+017F>s mi<U+017F>erable in my Loves then he. I love cruel one whom the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my <U+017F>ufferings can make never the more favourable to me. Give me
poi<U+017F>on as thou did<U+017F>t thy Ma<U+017F>ter, <hi>Carmelin:</hi> I will take it off pre<U+017F>ently, and lye
down by him that I may dye in his company. Am I a common Executioner
<U+017F>ayes <hi>Carmelin?</hi> Am I an admini<U+017F>trer of poi<U+017F>on? Had I known that the wine
I had given my Ma<U+017F>ter had been poi<U+017F>oned, do you think I would have <U+017F>uffered
him to take it? Go <U+017F>eek poi<U+017F>on <U+017F>omewhere el<U+017F>e, there is no more in our bottle:
I would to God there never had been any. If I cannot get poi<U+017F>on, cryes out
<hi>Fontenay,</hi> I will take a knife and cut my throat; and if I am denyed weapons,
I <U+017F>hall find <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>hift to di<U+017F>patch my <U+017F>elf: I will ca<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf out at the
window, I will hang my <U+017F>elf, or <U+017F>wallow burning coals, and will keep in my breath
till I am choaked. Take away this de<U+017F>perate per<U+017F>on, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Hircan,</hi> you <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
and <hi>Meliantes,</hi> carry him into <U+017F>ome chamber, where let him be chained up as
a mad man. O God! how does Love let us <U+017F>ee this day the <U+017F>trange effects of
his mighty power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> having <U+017F>aid this, <hi>Fontenay</hi> was conveyed away, and <hi>Adrian</hi> having
him<U+017F>elf felt his Cou<U+017F>in, was <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple as to think him dead. He went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
to his wife and told her this <U+017F>ad news. They were both extremely troubled,
con<U+017F>idering it would be <U+017F>aid generally that they were the cau<U+017F>e of this poor lads
death, for want of having a better care of him; and were too blame to let him
goe into the Country among <U+017F>trangers, who had <U+017F>o confounded his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that he dyed out of de<U+017F>pair. Their recour<U+017F>e was to di<U+017F>charge their fury on
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> telling him he was a Rogue, a Traytor, and a Mutherer, and that it
was he had put poi<U+017F>on into his Ma<U+017F>ters wine. He reproached them with being
the cau<U+017F>e of all this unhappine<U+017F>s, and that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed at his death, that he
dyed to avoid going with them to <hi>Paris. Hircan</hi> came and told them it was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent
to quarrel in the place where the dead body lay; and that there was as
much re<U+017F>pect due to the dead as to things <U+017F>acred. He thereupon cau<U+017F>es all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the chamber and locked the dore, not permitting any to go in, and then takes
up <hi>Adrian</hi> after this manner. Let us <U+017F>peak a little with rea<U+017F>on good friend, <U+017F>ayes
he to him: What do you mean by making <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e here? Will you have all
the world take notice that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> is poi<U+017F>oned? If that be once known, his body
will be taken hence, and ju<U+017F>tice will proceed again<U+017F>t him as a <U+017F>elf-homicide. He
will be hanged at a Gibbet by his feet: he will have a brand of infamie, and his
goods will be confi<U+017F>cate: You that are of his kindred will get neither profit nor
eredit thereby. All you have of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s in your hands will be taken away, and
the children will point at you as they goe to <U+017F>chool, as being of near kin to one
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43725:176"/>
that was hanged. You mu<U+017F>t therefore conceal the truth, and give out that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
dyed a natural death.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap><U+017F>ilenced <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife: They had <U+017F>ome part in
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s inheritance, which would have fallen to them very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably, for they had
already two children, one tabling abroad, and the other at nur<U+017F>e, and they were
not over-rich. As for <hi>Carmelin,</hi> nothing could make him give over his complaints;
the<U+017F>e and the like were alwayes his words. I who have <U+017F>o faithfully a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted my
ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>hall now be no more thought on He that hath laboured <U+017F>hall go without
his reward, and they that have done nothiug <U+017F>hall carry away all. Who hath
been with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> night and day? Who hath fa<U+017F>ted with him for companys <U+017F>ake,
when there was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>itie? Who hath broke his <U+017F>leep to entertain him with
love di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e? Who made clean his cloaths? Who told him fine tales? Who
taught him <U+017F>entences taken out of the choice<U+017F>t Common-places? Alas! It was
his faithful <hi>Carmelin:</hi> Yet he <U+017F>hall inherit nothing of his. Now he is dead, he
mu<U+017F>t be thru<U+017F>t out of dores like a Rogue. Had he but made his Will, I
<U+017F>hould have <U+017F>een whether he had loved me me or no; I <U+017F>hould have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with what he would have left me. Mu<U+017F>t the next of kin whom he loved not
at all, and to avoid whom, he is departed the world; be his ab<U+017F>olute heirs? Tis
as much as the be<U+017F>towing on the murtherer the goods of him he hath murthered.
Here are his freinds who pretend to be very <U+017F>ad for his death, but they have not
the fiftieth part of my affliction. 'Tis a good author hath taught me, that if heirs
have tears in their eyes, they laugh in their hearts and as for that invention of
Clo<U+017F>e Mourning at the burial it was out of a di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t they might not con<U+017F>tantly
ob<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s in their count-nance, and that their joy might not be
di<U+017F>covered at their eyes, which would be a thing of ill example to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Carmelin</hi> continue his complaints, which I believe he had <U+017F>tudied,
but <hi>Hircan</hi> told him that he would order things <U+017F>o, that his <U+017F>ervices <U+017F>hould not
be forgoten, and though his Ma<U+017F>ter had ordered him neither wages, nor con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
yet <U+017F>hould he have what would <U+017F>atisfie him. He bid him not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
that his Ma<U+017F>ter made no will, for that would have been only a <U+017F>eminary of
<U+017F>uits, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s heirs would not have paid what had been bequeathed. To give
you an example of the<U+017F>e inconveniences, continues he, a rich man making his will,
left all he had to a company of his fellow Citizens to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of it, and to let his
right heirs have what part thereof plea<U+017F>ed them. The heir <U+017F>uing the communitie,
the Judge told them: Well, if you are de<U+017F>irous to accompli<U+017F>h the Will of the
Te<U+017F>tator, you mu<U+017F>t let this <U+017F>on have what plea<U+017F>eth you. What divi<U+017F>ion will you
make? he <U+017F>hall have a tenth part; and we will have the other nine replyed the
company. Take then the tenth part to your <U+017F>elves, <U+017F>ayes the Judge, and leave the
re<U+017F>t to the heir, for he is to have what part plea<U+017F>eth you. By this querck the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
heir was re<U+017F>tored to his right: but all Judges have not <U+017F>uch good judgments
as this had; <U+017F>o that it would be very doubtful pleading, both for the Inheritors
and Legataries. What ever <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had left you, Sir <hi>Carmelin, Adrian</hi> would have
gotten one half, and the Law another. What cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>hall I take then? <U+017F>aies
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> were it not better be in hazard to get <U+017F>omewhat, then to be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of
nothing? What <U+017F>hall I <U+017F>tay for? wretch that I am, fortune never <U+017F>miled on me
in my life. Do you wonder <hi>Fortune</hi> never <hi><U+017F>miled</hi> on you, rep<U+017F>ies <hi>Hircan,</hi> did you
ever <U+017F>ee one <U+017F>mile upon the <hi>wheele?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> under<U+017F>tood not this <U+017F>coffe at the fir<U+017F>t, but at length he remembred
that that uncon<U+017F>tant Godde<U+017F>s was repre<U+017F>ented on a wheele: He prayed <hi>Hircan</hi>
not to add to his affliction by deriding his mi<U+017F>ery: and though <hi>Hircan</hi> knew he
was not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad as he pretended, yet he <U+017F>wore to him, that in ca<U+017F>e the heirs
would give him nothing, he would <U+017F>atisfie him out of his own.</p>
            <p>About this time comes in a Lacquey from <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> who <U+017F>aid his Ma<U+017F>ter was
much troubled about <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> having heard nothing from him <U+017F>ince the la<U+017F>t time he
had <U+017F>een him, and that he was <U+017F>ent to know whether he had been <U+017F>o ill bred as to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43725:177"/>
return without bidding him adiew, or asking whether he would any thing to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
My friend, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan,</hi> tell your Ma<U+017F>ter that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> is ju<U+017F>t now departed
this world. The Lacquey would not have believed it, had not <hi>Carmelin</hi> with a
<U+017F>ad countenance confirmed it. He therefore returned with this an<U+017F>wer to his
Ma<U+017F>ter. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> knew not whether it was only a trick put upon him, or that it
was true, <U+017F>o that however it were, he thought be<U+017F>t to go immediately to <hi>Hircans.</hi>
At the outer gate he met <hi>Meliantes,</hi> who acquainted him with the whole bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.
To comply with the brave Shepherds that were there, <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
the di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate as much as could be.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> asked <hi>Hircan</hi> what he intended to do
with the body, and de<U+017F>ired it might be buried, and put into the ground: He <U+017F>hall
not be interred to day, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan,</hi> his fellow Shepherds will not permit it, their
Cu<U+017F>tom is to keep the bodies two daies at lea<U+017F>t, and then wa<U+017F>h them to <U+017F>ee if they
are quite dead; for there are <U+017F>ome who being only fallen into a lethargy have
been thought dead, and <U+017F>o buried, they recovering again have died mad. Be<U+017F>ides
that you are to know that the bodies of <hi>Illu<U+017F>trious Shepherds</hi> and <hi>Heroes,</hi> <U+017F>uch as
your Cou<U+017F>in was, are never intered, that's a thing was never <U+017F>een. Read all good
Authors, and you will find it was never done: We think it a ba<U+017F>e thing to be
thru<U+017F>t into the earth; you cannot do wor<U+017F>e with tho<U+017F>e that die as Malefactors:
is there any thing more ignominious then to rot, and to be eaten of worms? Is it
not a de<U+017F>picable thing to be be<U+017F>tow'd into the gro<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t of all the Elements? 'tis
better chu<U+017F>e the pure<U+017F>t, as a thing more noble and more de<U+017F>irable. We per<U+017F>ons
of quality, have our bodies burned after our death. The fire which <U+017F>eems to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pire
to the highe<U+017F>t <U+017F>phere, <U+017F>eems tocarry thither with it our Reliques, and that
our bodies are conveyed to the Gods as well as our <U+017F>ouls. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s body <U+017F>hall
therefore be burn'd on a heap of fagots, in the mid<U+017F>t of my Court; but there
are <U+017F>ome nece<U+017F><U+017F>arie ceremonies to go before <hi>Hercules</hi> was burnt alive before he
went to heaven; is there any danger to burn a dead man? the bodies of all the
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ars</hi> have been <U+017F>o.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> who under<U+017F>tood nothing of Hi<U+017F>tory nor fables, was be<U+017F>ide him<U+017F>elf at
this propo<U+017F>ition of <hi>Hircan,</hi> and prote<U+017F>ted more then ever to apply him<U+017F>elf to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice
for <U+017F>atisfaction for all the injuries he had received. He <U+017F>aid they were to
blame not to <U+017F>uffer his Cou<U+017F>in to be buried after the ordinary manner, <U+017F>ince it did
not appear he died a Heretick, nay contrary to <hi>Hircans</hi> opinion, he maintained
that it was an ignominious thing to be burn'd; nay wor<U+017F>e then to be ca<U+017F>t into the
common <U+017F>hore, <U+017F>ince they were the mo<U+017F>t wicked that were condemned to the
fire, as Witches, and Traitors. <hi>Philiris</hi> <U+017F>tood up to make good what <hi>Hircan</hi> had
<U+017F>aid, and would have brought his rea<U+017F>ons out of the <U+017F>ubtile <hi>Wi<U+017F>dom</hi> of Dr. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi>
but <hi>Hircan</hi> told him he mu<U+017F>t keep within the limits of <hi>Poety,</hi> and that
they ought not to engage them<U+017F>elves in things over <U+017F>erious. <hi>Adrian</hi> not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any longer to keep in his vexation, turn'd to <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> and quarrelled with
him in this manner; If I come to any trouble for my decea<U+017F>ed Cou<U+017F>in, I declare
to you now as I did then, and I <U+017F>hall declare to you then as I now do, that I will
be righted again<U+017F>t you. You have taken this poor youth from under my hands,
and though you promi<U+017F>ed me to treat him well, yet you have brought him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
among a <U+017F>ort of people that have made him run quite out of his wits. 'Tis
quite contrary to what you <U+017F>ay, replies <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> for if they are mad as you <U+017F>ee
they are <U+017F>ometimes, 'tis your Cou<U+017F>in is in fault; they were di<U+017F>creet enough when
he came hither, but he hath perverted them, and filled them with his corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
If I had not had a great care of my <U+017F>elf, and kept at a di<U+017F>tance from him,
he would have brought me into the <U+017F>ame high-way of madne<U+017F>s: I have <U+017F>ufficient
witne<U+017F>s to prove that he would have per<U+017F>waded me above a hundred times to
turn Shepherd. The<U+017F>e are cheats, <U+017F>aies <hi>Adrian,</hi> you are all of you old enough to
look to your <U+017F>elves; 'tis not to be conceived that one young man alone <U+017F>hould cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<U+017F>o many; my cou<U+017F>in could not be wor<U+017F> in any place of the world: the<U+017F>e are Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians
&amp; Athei<U+017F>ts that fear neither God nor devil; <U+017F>ince I came into this place I have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43725:177"/>
not heard one word of our Religion. How is it that the<U+017F>e Apo<U+017F>tates are <U+017F>uffered
in <hi>France,</hi> who are wor<U+017F>e then <hi>Nero</hi>'s and <hi>Julian</hi>'s?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> uttered a many exclamations to the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e, but <hi>Meliantes</hi> told
him that it were not his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch language, and that he had already
felt the greatne<U+017F>s of <hi>Hircans</hi> power. You are an ignorant Cockney, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
very roughly to him, you know not what belongs to Heroick grandeur: Know
that <hi>Heroes,</hi> <U+017F>uch as we are, have priviledges which other men have not. They
live after another manner, they are clad otherwi<U+017F>e, they <U+017F>peak otherwi<U+017F>e, and
they die otherwi<U+017F>e. <hi>Adrian</hi> had an itch to ask whether they had not a Paradice
by them<U+017F>elves, but he kept it in for fear of further offence. Con<U+017F>ider with your
<U+017F>elf if you have a mind to <U+017F>ee the Ceremonies we u<U+017F>e to the dead, continued
<hi>Hircan,</hi> we will not do any thing the le<U+017F>s, or more <U+017F>ecretly for you; if you will
not appear there, hide your <U+017F>elf where you plea<U+017F>e; nay the truth is, you are too
profane to be pre<U+017F>ent at <U+017F>uch <U+017F>acred Funerals.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e made <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife retire to their Chamber and in the
mean time <hi>Hircan</hi> opens <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s, whereinto the whole company entred, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<hi>Fontenay,</hi> who having overcome his de<U+017F>pair, thought it <U+017F>ufficient to be
<U+017F>ad. <hi>Carmelin</hi> went and ca<U+017F>t the <U+017F>heet over <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s head, who di<U+017F>covered no more
motion then before; and the Gardiner having brought <U+017F>uch flowers and <U+017F>weet
hearbs as could be found in that <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, all the Shepherds ca<U+017F>t of them upon the
dead body.</p>
            <p>Hereupon comes in <hi>Amaryllis</hi> <U+017F>inging an aire had been purpo<U+017F>ly made on the
death of the Shepherd. Her voice was <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet and langui<U+017F>hing, that <hi>Adrian</hi>
thought at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ung <U+017F>ome good prayer, or hymne; but when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood
the <U+017F>ence of what <U+017F>he <U+017F>ung, and the other Shepherds an<U+017F>wering her, he
was <U+017F>tark mad, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ubject of it was <U+017F>ome amorous pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. See here my
duck, among what a <U+017F>ort of people we are fallen in<U+017F>tead of praying to God for
the <U+017F>oul of the poor dead party or <U+017F>ending for Prie<U+017F>ts to do it, they go even into
his Chamber <U+017F>inging <hi>French</hi> aires whereas the <hi>hymnes</hi> of the Church are in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
In the mean time I doubt not but my Cou<U+017F>in hath more need of good pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
for he died without confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
            <p>The Mu<U+017F>ick having la<U+017F>ted a good while, he <U+017F>till complained, and in the mean
time <hi>Carmelin</hi> being come out of the Chamber for more branches of Cypre<U+017F>s
which <hi>Hircan</hi> wanted, a Lacquey met him, and fell on him in the<U+017F>e words; Thy
glory is now in the du<U+017F>t, poor <U+017F>nake, thou <U+017F>halt play the fool no more, thou ha<U+017F>t
lo<U+017F>t the ma<U+017F>ter for who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ake thou wert entertained every where. I <U+017F>hall now
<U+017F>ee thee a poor rogue again. <hi>Carmelin</hi> was <U+017F>o peaceable a man that he made no
return again to the<U+017F>e abu<U+017F>es, but fell a weeping to <U+017F>hew how great his grief was;
but yet in him<U+017F>elf he took comfort, when he con<U+017F>idered that tho<U+017F>e who domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neered
over him, as if he had no dependance of any man, would be one day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
when they <U+017F>hould find <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>till alive. He went therefore to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and gathered <U+017F>ome Cypre<U+017F>s, and carried it quietly to quietly to <hi>Hircan.</hi> who <U+017F>trewed
it all about the Chamber, according to the cu<U+017F>tom of the Ancients, who held
that Tree mournfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> hereupon reflecting on what he had heard <hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s
body <U+017F>hould be burn'd and not interr'd, fell into <U+017F>trange di<U+017F>quiets; for as to the
effecting his Ma<U+017F>ters de<U+017F>igne, it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary he <U+017F>hould be interr'd, to the end
that there being nothing to detain <hi>Adrian</hi> in <hi>Bris,</hi> he might return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> get out of the Sepulcher in the night, and go into <U+017F>ome private place, whence
he might afterwards return to his former way of life; whereas on the contrary,
<U+017F>hould they burn him, the poor man knew not whether he were not oblig'd to
declare that he was not dead, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould commit <U+017F>uch a cruelty as to burn
him alive. At la<U+017F>t he re<U+017F>olved to be patient a while, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould have incurr'd
the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of his Ma<U+017F>ter, who would have been angry to find him no better
a keeper of his <U+017F>ecrets, <U+017F>o that he re<U+017F>olv'd not to declare the truth, till extream
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>hould require it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:43725:178"/>
While he was thus con<U+017F>idering, <hi>Philiris</hi> being gotten up into a chair on his knees,
and leaning his hands on the back of it, began to hem, as one that prepares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
for a long <U+017F>peech. All the Shepherds <U+017F>ate down knowing his intention was to
make a <hi>Funeral Oration</hi> on the death of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and every one keeping <U+017F>ilence,
he <U+017F>poke thus.</p>
            <p>I am not able to tell you, <U+017F>ad and di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate Shepherds, what we have left
us we can call good, if we con<U+017F>ider what we have lo<U+017F>t, unle<U+017F>s it be the reflection
of our memory on the content and <U+017F>atisfaction we had to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> for we are rather to continue our thanks to the Gods that we enjoy'd
him <U+017F>ome time, then cen<U+017F>ure them that they have now taken him from us. They
are po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly our crimes have caus'd it, in that we de<U+017F>erve not to have among us <U+017F>o
rare a Ma<U+017F>terpiece, to who<U+017F>e excellence heaven and nature had contributed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually.
Whether we con<U+017F>ider the features of his countenance, and the
proportion of his body, or repre<U+017F>ent to our <U+017F>elves the delicacy of his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition,
and the excellency of his mind, there was nothing the earth could be worthy
of. Neverthele<U+017F>s this common mother of men being de<U+017F>irous to enjoy him eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
had obtained of <hi>Jupiter</hi> that he might be received into the quality of
<hi>Trees,</hi> which <U+017F>he nouri<U+017F>hes by their roots; but the <U+017F>age <hi>Hircan</hi> oppo<U+017F>ed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and delivered the illu<U+017F>trious Shepherd out of captivity; which though it
was honourable, yet could not but be inconvenient. But heaven not being long
able to be without its own work, hath prevailed <U+017F>o far as that it hath taken him
hence, and it might be ea<U+017F>ily judg'd it was re<U+017F>olv'd to have him, <U+017F>ince it was the
decree of fate he <U+017F>hould expo<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf to all manner of dangers to deliver a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
out of the Pri<U+017F>on of an Enchanter, though his principal profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion was far
from that of a Souldier, Notwith<U+017F>tanding all this, 'twas no violent death
<U+017F>natcht him from us; but methinks the fir<U+017F>t fruits of tho<U+017F>e delights he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes,
<U+017F>hould not have been <U+017F>o burden<U+017F>ome to him; a natural death came and
gently clo<U+017F>ed up his eyes, and hath not broken nor cut the knots which fa<U+017F>tned
his <U+017F>oul and body together, but hath mo<U+017F>t dexterou<U+017F>ly and without any violence
untyed them.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e words moved <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>o far, that he almo<U+017F>t forgot he was departed. He
was ready to <U+017F>peak, and to tell the Shepherds they were to blame to <U+017F>ay his death
was natural, <U+017F>ince it was violent. He thought that if it was not <U+017F>aid he had poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oned
him<U+017F>elf, his hopes would have been fru<U+017F>trated, and he <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>erve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>Charite.</hi> He never imagined it would have been ignominious to him if
it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>aid he had di<U+017F>patched him<U+017F>elf. The agitation of his mind was <U+017F>o
great, that his body moved a little, which <hi>Meliantes</hi> perceiving, acquainted the
Oratour with it; but they per<U+017F>waded him it was an illu<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>o that <hi>Philiris</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in his Oration.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>hould then have told you, Pa<U+017F>toral A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, that it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
<U+017F>hould die, <U+017F>ince it was the plea<U+017F>ure of heaven, but yet there was no con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<U+017F>hould oblige us to receive his death otherwi<U+017F>e then with the greate<U+017F>t afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that men are capable of. There's none among us ought for ten years be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>mile, and if any <U+017F>uch thing happen it <U+017F>hall be a forfeit. How can
we di<U+017F>claim <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s? <U+017F>ince love him<U+017F>elf, though a God, is not exempted; and I
believe he will no more go naked as he was wont to do, becau<U+017F>e he mu<U+017F>t now put
on mourning: Nor indeed could he not but be extreamly obliged to this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
as who made it his daily employment, the dilatation of his Empire while he
lived, and at his death commended and con<U+017F>ign'd his <U+017F>oul into his hands to be
conducted into that place, where all faithfull Lovers are eternally rewarded. I
<U+017F>hould not tell you all the<U+017F>e things, did I not herein obey cu<U+017F>tom, who will have
it <U+017F>o; for I conceive you are all ready to do <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> all that is due to him, without
any excitation from my words. However I <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ume to de<U+017F>ire you again<U+017F>t
to morrow to prepare your <U+017F>elves for the <U+017F>olemnity of his Funerals, then I <U+017F>hall
have more to <U+017F>ay then I have now, and then I <U+017F>hall make a particular relation of
all his perfections, and the noble<U+017F>t adventures of his Loves, not for your <U+017F>akes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43725:178"/>
who are acquainted with them; but to <U+017F>atisfie <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>trangers to them that
may happen to be then pre<U+017F>ent, and would be glad to under<U+017F>tand the life of the
<hi>Heroick Shepherd,</hi> who<U+017F>e de<U+017F>igne was to introduce among us the felicity of the
fir<U+017F>t age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philiris</hi> here ended his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, whereof <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed not a word, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
elevated with the honour they did him. <hi>Hircan</hi> cau<U+017F>ed all the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
to leave the Chamber, and left <hi>Carmelin</hi> alone to watch the dead body.
They dined a while after, and they brought him what he wanted; but though
there was not too much for him<U+017F>elf, yet was he <U+017F>o charitable, as having lockt the
dore, to pre<U+017F>ent his Ma<U+017F>ter with half, who confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed he never had a better <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
then <U+017F>ince he was dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> returned to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, there to give an account of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s plea<U+017F>ant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
and to <U+017F>atisfie all as to the report they might have received of his death.
In the mean time <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> would needs eat apart, and not go any
more among the Shepherds, whom they took for excommunicated and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
people: Their re<U+017F>olution was not to return till they had <U+017F>een their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ins
body put into the ground in <U+017F>pight of all <hi>Hircans</hi> oppo<U+017F>itions; though they
had bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s that much required their ha<U+017F>tening to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day being <U+017F>pent in divers entertainments, as every one was plea<U+017F>ed to pa<U+017F>s
it away, it was thought fit <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>hould lie in the Chamber where the dead
body lay, though he <U+017F>eem'd to be <U+017F>omewhat unwilling, and the re<U+017F>t were di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
into their ordinary Chambers. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf alone with his faithfull
<hi>Carmelin,</hi> talked with him a good while, and would needs know what was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<U+017F>aid of his death. Having under<U+017F>tood that every one bewailed it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
it might be <U+017F>ome affliction to <hi>Charite;</hi> and as for the con<U+017F>ulation was had
about the burning of his body, it troubled him more then all. At la<U+017F>t he de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Carmelin</hi> to bind a faggot about with cloathes, and to put it upon the heap
in his <U+017F>tead. <hi>Carmelin</hi> promi<U+017F>ed to do whatever lay in his power. The morning
was not far <U+017F>pent, but <hi>Orontes</hi> and all his hou<U+017F>e came to <hi>Hircans,</hi> being extreamly
de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of this feigned departure of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is. Montenor</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>
were al<U+017F>o pre<U+017F>ent, the report it <U+017F>eems having <U+017F>pread <U+017F>o far. All the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
were already entred <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s Chamber, when <hi>Adrian</hi> comes thither once
more to relate his afflictions, telling them they were to blame, not to have be<U+017F>tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chri<U+017F>tian burial on the poor decea<U+017F>ed party. <hi>Clarimond</hi> comes in ju<U+017F>t as he
was <U+017F>peaking, <U+017F>o that having known him to be the man he had <U+017F>poken with in the
fields, and finding him more <U+017F>taid and di<U+017F>creet then any of the re<U+017F>t, he entreated
him to <U+017F>tand his friend. <hi>Clarimond</hi> who was of a very good di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, went
and <U+017F>poke <U+017F>oftly to <hi>Hircan,</hi> telling him, that he knew not what plea<U+017F>ure they took
by per<U+017F>ecuting the poor Citizen in that manner, and that he was <U+017F>ufficiently abus'd.
You may perceive well enough, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan,</hi> that it is his cou<U+017F>in <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> hath begun,
we have only promoted the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s a little; when an humour took him to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
him<U+017F>elf dead, would you have us <U+017F>ay immediately that there was no <U+017F>uch
thing? Not <U+017F>o neither, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> the humour was too plea<U+017F>ant to let it
die; but let it now have an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> made no other an<U+017F>wer to that, then with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the power to make it die, you may by the <U+017F>ame power revive it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> perceived by this di<U+017F>cout<U+017F>e, that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was there, and being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it <U+017F>hould be reproacht to her in time to come, that <U+017F>he was not able to rai<U+017F>e

up her Lover, he re<U+017F>olved to return immediately into the world in her pre<U+017F>ence.
He therefore rais'd up his head by little, and having uncovered it with one hand,
he rub'd his eyes a long time together, as if he had had a deal of trouble to get
them open.</p>
            <p>The Shepherds cry'd out pre<U+017F>ently a miracle, a miracle, a miracle of <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>'s
eyes, this beauty hath not only re<U+017F>tored life to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but even to all his friends
who would have died with him. Let us give her thanks, let us adore her, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Temples to her as a Godde<U+017F>s. On your knees Shepherds before this fair
one, <U+017F>ubmit your <U+017F>elves to her. <hi>Charite</hi> <U+017F>eeing that they came to embrace her
knees and ki<U+017F>s the border of her garment, was <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>hfull that <U+017F>he repented <U+017F>he
had come along with her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and would have run away, had not <hi>Hircan</hi> held
her very fa<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> beheld her with a langui<U+017F>hing look, and after a while <U+017F>aid to her, Is it you
fair <hi>Charite</hi> that commands me from the other world after you had <U+017F>ent me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
What new re<U+017F>olution have you taken? Will you have me <U+017F>tay and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>h
here for ever? Do not you imagin any <U+017F>uch thing, <U+017F>aies <hi>Hircan,</hi> 'tis to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tore
you to happine<U+017F>s, that you are re<U+017F>tored to life. O! if it be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi>
how much better is it for me to be on earth, then to be in hell, or the Eli<U+017F>ian fields,
whence I am now come, and where I have <U+017F>een wonderfull things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was in the Chamber with the re<U+017F>t to <U+017F>ee what <U+017F>hould be done,
was extreamly overjoy'd to hear <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>peak. he went and cry'd out to his wife
that their Cou<U+017F>in was <U+017F>till alive; but <hi>Polidor</hi> told him that he was mi<U+017F>taken if he
thought that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had not been dead at all, and that he had not <U+017F>een him depart,
but that he was rai<U+017F>ed again both through the charms of <hi>Charite,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e of
<hi>Hircan. Adrian</hi> who under<U+017F>tood nothing of <U+017F>uch miracles, an<U+017F>wered
not a word, to avoid further di<U+017F>pute, but with <hi>Pernella</hi> returned to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>The Shepherd would have ri<U+017F>en to have ca<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf at <hi>Charite</hi>'s feet; but they
told him he were better keep his bed a little, becau<U+017F>e a man could not die without
being very <U+017F>ick, and that there was <U+017F>till <U+017F>ome reliques of the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. However he
lifted him<U+017F>elf up a little higher then he was before, and having a pillow under his
head, he began to <U+017F>peak thus to all that were pre<U+017F>ent:</p>
            <p>It is but rea<U+017F>onable, dearly beloved companions, that I tell you from what
place I come, and that I give you an account of tho<U+017F>e things I have <U+017F>een. My <U+017F>oul
was no <U+017F>ooner out of my body, but <hi>Live</hi> came and <U+017F>eiz'd it to carry it to <hi>Hell:</hi>
I would not have my Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Adrian</hi> nor yet his wife, whom I <U+017F>ee there in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<U+017F>tart back at that word; they are not to think that going to hell in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
of Shepherdry is to be damn'd, as it may be they have heard their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
teach; but it <U+017F>ignifies only tran<U+017F>lation into the other world, which is called
hell, becau<U+017F>e it is lower then this. It is certain that in that place there is a pri<U+017F>on
for tho<U+017F>e that are found guilty of any crime, but that is called <hi>Tartarus.</hi> All men
are obliged to go into tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ubterraneous places to do homage to <hi>Pluto,</hi> who is
the King thereof, unle<U+017F>s it happen by e<U+017F>pecial favour to <U+017F>ome to be deified a<U+017F><U+017F>oon
as they are dead, and that <U+017F>ome God plunge them into a river to purifie them, as
<hi>Venus</hi> did her <U+017F>on <hi>Aeneas</hi> This honour being not due to me, Love carried me
away into hell; for you are to ob<U+017F>erve that though they are the good or bad
Angels which do this Office for all other mortals, yet this little God did it for
me, becau<U+017F>e the fates never commended me into the cu<U+017F>tody of any other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
then him. When we had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed down through an ob<U+017F>cute valley, we came
to the banks of the River <hi>Acheron,</hi> where Love left me, and I met with the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryman,
who was going to tran<U+017F>port certain <U+017F>ouls: I would needs have gone with
them into the boat, but he thru<U+017F>t me back with all his might, <U+017F>aying he would
not carry me over unle<U+017F>s I paid him his fair before-hand. I have no other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
then that which is within me, that is my <U+017F>elf: thou fee<U+017F>t there are remain'd
in me certain grains of the fir<U+017F>t age, and that by my vertues I have guilt the iron
of the pre<U+017F>ent. Con<U+017F>ider if I may not be able to <U+017F>erve thee in <U+017F>omewhat may
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43725:179"/>
recompence thy pains; for as to the pieces of bra<U+017F>s which others give, I have not
brought it with me. All this would have <U+017F>ignified nothing had not there been
a charitable <U+017F>oul that had a double piece, and <U+017F>aid it was for us both, con<U+017F>idering
<U+017F>he had no further u<U+017F>e of money. When I had cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed over and was got a<U+017F>hore,
I went to Hell-gate, where <hi>Cerberus</hi> could do me no hurt, becau<U+017F>e he was at that
time tyed up with a great iron chain. Being come into the mid<U+017F>t of that great
Palace, I perceived all the other <U+017F>ouls flying before me, whereat I was extreamly
troubled, for I would have been glad to have di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed with them, and have
asked them how they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away their time in that place. At length there were
two more confident then the re<U+017F>t, who took me and lead me before the <hi>three
Judges</hi> to whom they repre<U+017F>ented, that <hi>Pluto's</hi> Kingdom was decaying, if there
were not <U+017F>ome order taken; for whereas a <U+017F>oul incur'd greater torment if it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to avoid the darkne<U+017F>s, I had at once brought <U+017F>o much light with me,
that I had frighted all the inhabitants of that low Region. I well perceive the
rea<U+017F>on of it, <U+017F>aies <hi>Radamanthus,</hi> 'tis the <U+017F>oul of a Lover, who<U+017F>e fire is as pure and
as clear as the Sun, it mu<U+017F>t be plunged into tho<U+017F>e frozen Rivers, wherein we quench
the flames of <hi>Ambition, Avarice,</hi> and other pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. Let it not be <U+017F>ent thither,
replies <hi>Aeacus,</hi> it de<U+017F>erves far otherwi<U+017F>e, we were unju<U+017F>t if we did it: You have
not maturely con<U+017F>idered the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. <hi>Minos</hi> was of the <U+017F>ame opinion, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a long time con<U+017F>ulted with his brethren, it was ordered I <U+017F>hould be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Ely<U+017F>ian fields.</hi> I <U+017F>aw, as I pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by <hi>Tartarus,</hi> where the <U+017F>infull are <U+017F>o
tormented, that their cryes are heard a league off. <hi>Tantalus</hi> is there, <hi>Ixion</hi> is
al<U+017F>o there, and a many others that have offended the Gods. After I had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
a great way with a <U+017F>pirit that was my guide, I <U+017F>aw the aire grew by little
and little more clear, and in a moment I found my <U+017F>elf in a Countrey which had
light enough to di<U+017F>cover the excellent things that were in it. There was a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
cheequered with an infinity of flowers, which could not be <U+017F>een otherwi<U+017F>e
then by travelling over all the Countrys of the world, at the end of that there was
a Grove which had as many different trees, and there I met with a many happy
<U+017F>ouls who began to receive me with complements for the <U+017F>atisfaction they found
in my company. I had not left my civility behind me here, <U+017F>o that I an<U+017F>wered
them in as courteous expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. They were all clad in white, and their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
recreation was to recite Ver<U+017F>es, to play on the Lute or the Gitarre, and not at
Cards nor Dice, which was the diver<U+017F>ion of evil <U+017F>pirits. As they were <U+017F>hewing
me all their plea<U+017F>ures, it came into my mind to ask them why we were called by
no other name then <hi>Souls,</hi> and why we were put in the feminine gender, <U+017F>ince di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
among us had been <U+017F>ometimes men? There was one going to an<U+017F>wer me, when
I perceived Love hovering over my head, who took me in his arms, and carryed
me <U+017F>o <U+017F>wiftly through the air, that the greatne<U+017F>s of the agitation <U+017F>oon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ulled me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>leep,
<U+017F>o that I found my <U+017F>elf in this place ere I thought on't.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having thus ended his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which was a knot of lyes invented on
the <U+017F>udden, all admir'd the fruitfulne<U+017F>s of his conceptions. <hi>Philiris</hi> told him,
that as to the doubt he was in, that we were but <U+017F>ouls only after our death, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc><<U+25CA>></desc>
               </gap> was
not becau<U+017F>e were were women rather then men, but that not being of one <U+017F>ex
more then another, we had been called by a name u<U+017F>ed in the feminine gender,
without any de<U+017F>igne. Be it as it will, <U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but I am glad that my <U+017F>oul is
feminine, for then it <U+017F>hall be of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ex as the object of its love; <U+017F>ince it is
the only de<U+017F>ire of the <hi>Lover</hi> to be changed into the thing loved. See fair <hi>Charite</hi>
how great the affection I bear you is, continued he, nay when I was in the other
world, I had no other regret, but that I had left this too <U+017F>oon, and had not <U+017F>taid
to <U+017F>ee you, that you might not have doubted but that you were the cau<U+017F>e of my
death: But fate hath laid this obligation on me, that if I dyed not in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence,
it was in your pre<U+017F>ence that I was rai<U+017F>ed up again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charite</hi> knew not what an<U+017F>wer to make to the<U+017F>e fine words, <U+017F>o that when <U+017F>he
perceived <hi>Hircan</hi> loo<U+017F>en his hold <U+017F>omewhat, <U+017F>he made but one <U+017F>tride of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
into the gallery, and as <U+017F>he went down, being followed by no body, <U+017F>he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43725:180"/>
con<U+017F>idered of her returning to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s to avoid further abu<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> in the mean time was extremely comforced at the arrival of tho<U+017F>e who
were come in la<U+017F>t, who <U+017F>eemed to him to be of more <U+017F>taid minds then the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.
He therefore approaches his Cou<U+017F>in, and asked him whether he would
not return to <hi>Paris;</hi> whereat the Shepheard was extreamely troubled, imagining
his di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation had been all to no purpo<U+017F>e, and had not la<U+017F>ted long enough to
<U+017F>end away that trouble<U+017F>ome Guardian. As he was <U+017F>tudying what to an<U+017F>wer, <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
prevented him, <U+017F>aying, he was too importunate in di<U+017F>turbing a poor man,
who was but newly returned to life, and that it was <U+017F>ufficient if <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had <U+017F>o much
<U+017F>trength as to get up and walk about the hou<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>This check roughly delivered, made <hi>Adrian</hi> retire, and <hi>Hircan</hi> having promis'd
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> on his word, that his Cou<U+017F>in <U+017F>hould not di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of him as he plea<U+017F>ed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to ri<U+017F>e and come to dinner with the company. He was at that time
in <U+017F>o good an humour, that he <U+017F>uffered <hi>Carmelin</hi> to help him put on his cloaths.
<hi>Hircan</hi> had retained to dine with him all that were in the hou<U+017F>e. As they were
ready to <U+017F>it down, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was like to make an ill meal of it, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw not
<hi>Charite</hi> whom he had <U+017F>ought all over the hou<U+017F>e. He thought the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of
Love he had made to her, were come to nothing: but <hi>Angelica</hi> having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
<U+017F>ome of her complaints, would give him <U+017F>ome comfort, making him believe
that the rea<U+017F>on he found not <hi>Charite</hi> there; was not becau<U+017F>e that <U+017F>he had left
him out of di<U+017F>dain, but that <hi>Leonora</hi> had <U+017F>ent her to <hi>Orontes</hi>'s about <U+017F>ome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>On the other <U+017F>ide <hi>Adrian,</hi> who imagined his Cou<U+017F>in would be no better then
he was before, had not quitted his de<U+017F>ire to carry him away; and his recour<U+017F>e
was to <hi>An<U+017F>elm</hi> though he had quarrelled with him, but a little before.</p>
            <p>He asked if he might not be permitted to be gone; to which <hi>An<U+017F>elm</hi> replyed,
if you are in <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>t you may go your wayes pre<U+017F>ently: but as for <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
you, that as I brought him hither, <U+017F>o I will bring him hence. Within 15
dayes at farthe<U+017F>t I mu<U+017F>t be at <hi>Paris,</hi> there being <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ions that call me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It is not <U+017F>o long that there can happen any great alterations in your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ins
mind, that you <U+017F>hould much fear. <hi>Adrian</hi> was loath to <U+017F>ub<U+017F>cribe to this,
but <hi>Clarimond</hi> interpo<U+017F>ing, advi<U+017F>ed him to accept what was propo<U+017F>ed. He was
forced to it out of the good opinion he had of that Gentlemans faithfulne<U+017F>s and
<U+017F>inceritie. However, <U+017F>ince it was too late to get to <hi>Paris</hi> that night, he deferred
his journey till the next day, and <hi>Hircan</hi> being acquainted with his re<U+017F>olution,
made him very welcom, becau<U+017F>e he gave him that further time to make <U+017F>port with
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While all this was working, <hi>Carmelin</hi> knew not whether he ought to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or <U+017F>ad. As <U+017F>oon as his Ma<U+017F>ter was gotten up, he went to <U+017F>ee <hi>Ly<U+017F>etta,</hi> to whom
he had not proffered his <U+017F>ervice <U+017F>ince he had <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion. His Ma<U+017F>ters death
had taken away all <U+017F>uch thoughts. The fir<U+017F>t propo<U+017F>ition he made thereof to her,
<U+017F>he only laughed at him for his pains, <U+017F>o that he was very ill <U+017F>atisfied. The wor<U+017F>t
on't was, that he dur<U+017F>t not declare it to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he would have given him
no other advice then to play the mad Lover like <hi>Fontenay.</hi> He could not <U+017F>ing to
entertain her with <hi>Serenades,</hi> and could play upon no other In<U+017F>trument then a
Flute. Be<U+017F>ides he was a man that would not abate any thing of his re<U+017F>t, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
your Lovers laws. He returned therefore with the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>quiets to dine with
per<U+017F>ons of honour and qualitie, as he was wont to do.</p>
            <p>As they were wa<U+017F>hing before they <U+017F>ate down, <hi>Hircans</hi> man acquainted him
that there was below an ill favoured fellow, and as ill accounted, who had a great
de<U+017F>ire to come up. How came he to thee <U+017F>ayes <hi>Hircan,</hi> <U+017F>aid he nothing of any
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s he had with me? When I <U+017F>aw him alight, replies the man, I asked him
what he would have. I am lately come out of <hi>Champagn,</hi> replyed he, and de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to return thither again, I am gotten out of the way, <U+017F>o that I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
in vain <U+017F>ought out an Inne for to bait in, in the<U+017F>e Quarters. You are very
ill directed, <U+017F>aid I to him, Do you think to lodge here? Do you not know that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43725:180"/>
this is a Gentlemans hou<U+017F>e, and not an Inne? Notwith<U+017F>tanding the<U+017F>e words, he
<U+017F>ticked not to tye his hor<U+017F>e up to a Lattice and give him <U+017F>ome hay, which he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
up and down near the <U+017F>table; and very faintly made this reply, Since it
is a Gentlemans hou<U+017F>e, it is better for me then if it were an Inne. I am every
day honourably received at Princes tables, and therefore your Ma<U+017F>ter will be
glad of my company, and I de<U+017F>ire you only to acquaint him that <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> is
here, that name is <U+017F>ufficiently known all over <hi>Europe;</hi> they that know it not
mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>uch as have not forgotten their pap. Having told me <U+017F>o I thought
be<U+017F>t not to di<U+017F>pute with him any further, but rather to make ha<U+017F>te up to acquaint
you with his coming: but becau<U+017F>e he followed me very clo<U+017F>ely, I entreated him
to <U+017F>tay at the <U+017F>tair-foot<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> as I believe he does <U+017F>till. You will find it is <U+017F>ome Ma<U+017F>ter
Fool I warrant you, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Clarimond.</hi> Do not <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> art thou
come hither again to <U+017F>pight me, and quarrel with all good people that <U+017F>hall
come to me? If this <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> be he I mean, he is one of the mo<U+017F>t excellent
men of this age. I will go and entertain him upon your commendation, <U+017F>ayes
<hi>Hircan.</hi> He went pre<U+017F>ently to this man, who had a cloak and breeches of black
Serge, with a doublet of Dowla<U+017F>s, foul enough in con<U+017F>cience, <U+017F>o that the per<U+017F>on
<U+017F>eemed not to be of any great qualitie.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Hircan</hi> coming to him, made a low congie, and <U+017F>aluted
him with this complement, which he had <U+017F>tudied before. <q>I crave your pardon
Sir, <U+017F>aid he to him, that I have pre<U+017F>umed to give you a vi<U+017F>it <U+017F>o privately; for I
beleive, that <U+017F>ince you may not at any time <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e labours of my mind
which I have put forth a while <U+017F>ince, I may al<U+017F>o be permitted to <U+017F>ee you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He thought he had done wonders in di<U+017F>covering him<U+017F>elf by this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that
he was an Author of the Times; but <hi>Hircan</hi> made him this return. 'Tis true
indeed Sir, that you have a priviledge to vi<U+017F>it when you plea<U+017F>e all tho<U+017F>e that have
<U+017F>een your excellent Works, and that they are every one obliged to entertain you
once at lea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o that if you will you need never eat at home; and I mu<U+017F>t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that though the Books I think you <U+017F>peak of, never came to my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
yet <U+017F>hall I be one of tho<U+017F>e who think them<U+017F>elves not the lea<U+017F>t honoured
to <U+017F>ee you at their table.</p>
            <p>Though this an<U+017F>wer was full of <U+017F>ecret Satyre, and touched this Para<U+017F>ite with
his impudence, yet he re<U+017F>olved to accept what was proffered him. He told <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
al<U+017F>o that he was out of his way, but that he was happy in the misfortune
that had procured him <U+017F>o noble an acquaintance. <hi>Hircan</hi> without any farther
ceremonie, de<U+017F>ired him to walk up, and <U+017F>ent a Lacquey to the <U+017F>table to <U+017F>ee his
hor<U+017F>e provided for. When he was come into the dining room, he was <U+017F>omewhat
put out of countenance to find <U+017F>o many there. Here is a man knows you very
well by reputation, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Hircan</hi> to him, pointing at <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> he hath read the
Books you have put out. This is then the <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> I <U+017F>poke of, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently,
let me embrace him, let me ki<U+017F>s him; he is my dear friend though he <U+017F>ay
nothing of Shepherdry in all his books. In <U+017F>aying this, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> embraced him about
the neck, and <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> told him he was much obliged to him that he had
vouch<U+017F>afed to look on his Works. After this <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> turned to his companions,
and <U+017F>aid to them, run Shepherds and <U+017F>alute this excellent wit. There are above
eighteen books that bear his name, and they are all Love <U+017F>tories. O the rare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity!
cryed out <hi>Phyliris,</hi> he teaches us to govern our <U+017F>elves amid<U+017F>t the violent
flames of that noble<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which <U+017F>eizeth our <U+017F>ouls. Why are not all that
live in <hi>France</hi> like him! Ignorance <U+017F>hould then be bani<U+017F>hed the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The other Shepherds made <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch like exclamations in <U+017F>aluting him, <U+017F>o
that it heightned him into an in<U+017F>upportable vanitie, and made him believe he had
already obtained the general approbation. <hi>Hircan</hi> commanded a ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of
the<U+017F>e complements, and that all <U+017F>hould <U+017F>it down to table according to their <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
qualities. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> who<U+017F>e memory was very much taken up with the cu<U+017F>toms of
Antiquitie, <U+017F>aid he did not think fit they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>it all about the table, but only
on one <U+017F>ide, and leave the other for the Steward and waiters. He wi<U+017F>hed al<U+017F>o
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43725:181"/>
they were laid on beds to eat, and not <U+017F>it on chairs; and his de<U+017F>ign was that they
<U+017F>hould not go to the table, but that it <U+017F>hould be brought to them, and taken
away when they had done. 'Tis very convenient indeed to lie on a bed and eat, <U+017F>ays
<hi>Hircan,</hi> for a man hath this advantage at lea<U+017F>t, that if he be drunk, he is in a good
place to <U+017F>leep. But if we <U+017F>hould now get Workmen to make tables and beds as
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would have them, we might <U+017F>tarve before they were done. Wherefore let
us now fall to dinner, another time we'l think on't.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> made no reply at all, becau<U+017F>e he in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly fell into another thought.
He thought <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> to be a very good Author, and was in doubt whether it
were not better give him his Hi<U+017F>tory to compo<U+017F>e then to <hi>Philiris,</hi> of who<U+017F>e elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
he had experience only in his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and had no tryal of his Elegance,
which is a thing requi<U+017F>ite to write well. At length, to look further into the man,
then he could di<U+017F>cover by his books, he thought it not ami<U+017F>s to ask him whether
he had not <U+017F>een the Letter he had <U+017F>ent to <hi>Paris,</hi> directed to all Poets and Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>ts.
<hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> replyed, that his friend the <hi>Fabuli<U+017F>tus</hi> had <U+017F>poke to him of a
Letter <U+017F>ent from an unknown Shepherd, but that he had not <U+017F>hewed it him. Then
it <U+017F>eems you are not come hither purpo<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>ee me, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that <hi>Fabuli<U+017F>tus</hi> whom you <U+017F>peak of, though he be as great a <hi>Poet</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manci<U+017F>t</hi>
as your <U+017F>elf, as his works <U+017F>peak him; yet it <U+017F>eems according to what you
<U+017F>ay, he thought very indifferently of my Letter, <U+017F>ince he hath not communicated
it. By this I perceive you are not of that company of <hi>Pari<U+017F>ians</hi> who are to come
hither and turn Shepherds; you <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>hewn others the way, and you
give me occa<U+017F>ion to remit of that good e<U+017F>teem I had of you. You <U+017F>ee all that
are about me clad in white, they are Shepherds, <U+017F>uch as I would have you to be
al<U+017F>o.</p>
            <p>The Shepherds to comply with <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed they were all of that happy
condition he attributed to them; and to make the better <U+017F>port, they fell into the
mo<U+017F>t extravagant di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es they could imagine. Their talk was like that of their
late comedies, unle<U+017F>s it were that they changed their <U+017F>tile oftener, and that the
<U+017F>ame Shepherd <U+017F>poke <U+017F>ometimes by <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> and <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Gallimathias. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris,</hi>
who read bad books as well as good, had had the patience to read <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ardans,</hi>
and picked out the ridiculous ab<U+017F>urdities; <U+017F>o that having a good memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he <U+017F>poke only in the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of that Author, which was the be<U+017F>t humour
of all. 'Twas not to give his words any other <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, they were ridiculous enough
of them<U+017F>elves, without any addition. <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> was nothing moved at it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he took no notice of it, or was proud to hear him<U+017F>elf quoted.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Fontenay,</hi> after he had a long time beheld <hi>Pern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lla</hi> with a langui<U+017F>hing
eye, he renewed his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of the de<U+017F>perate Lover, whereat <hi>Adrian</hi> and <U+017F>he
were not well plea<U+017F>ed; but yet <U+017F>uffered all, as being fully re<U+017F>olved to be gone the
next day. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having ob<U+017F>erved the divers po<U+017F>tures of tho<U+017F>e Shepherds,
thought them <U+017F>uch as he could not bear with, <U+017F>o that he was not able to contain
him<U+017F>elf any longer. He told <hi>Hircan</hi> that he thought their de<U+017F>ign was to play
the fools perpetually at this hou<U+017F>e, but that it was now time to break up the
enchantment, <U+017F>ince they both abu<U+017F>ed tho<U+017F>e that knew them and that knew them
not; and that for conclu<U+017F>ion of the Comedie, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> mu<U+017F>t be convinced of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
What errours doe<U+017F>t thou mean? <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> ever <U+017F>ince I have known you
I have done nothing el<U+017F>e but told you of them, replyes <hi>Clarimond,</hi> I mean tho<U+017F>e
imaginations which the <hi>Romances</hi> have infu<U+017F>ed into you. Its now time you <U+017F>hake
hands with them. Thou art then it <U+017F>eems the <U+017F>ame <hi>Clarimond</hi> who contemne<U+017F>t
the inventions of good Authors, replyes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I am glad <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> is come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>o <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably. He <U+017F>hall maintain his companions quarrel and his own. I have
often promi<U+017F>ed thee that when we met with any able wit of the age, I would give
thee leave to <U+017F>ay what ever thou can<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t the books which thou doe<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much
hate, that thou maye<U+017F>t be confuted and confounded by one that can tell how to
an<U+017F>wer thee. I do now take you at your word, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Clarimond.</hi> I will <U+017F>et upon
all your <hi>Fabuli<U+017F>ts</hi> both ancient and modern, we cannot choo<U+017F>e a fitter time then

now that we are in the mo<U+017F>t honourable A<U+017F><U+017F>embly in the world. For my part
I take <hi>An<U+017F>elm</hi> for our Judge. Be it <U+017F>o <U+017F>ayes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> he is an indifferent per<U+017F>on, he

            <p>Every one having heard this controver<U+017F>ie which was newly ri<U+017F>en, all endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to advance it by approving it, that that excellent re<U+017F>olution of a fair and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

is called Prince of the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets: A man needs do no more then read his
<hi>Iliads</hi> and his <hi>Ody<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> to find all the fopperies imaginable ama<U+017F>s'd together. I
will not taxe him with the overturning of the whole <hi>Hi<U+017F>tory,</hi> and whereas it
is held that the <hi>Trojans</hi> overcame the <hi>Grecians,</hi> he hath feigned that the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
overcame the <hi>Trojans,</hi> to honour his own Country; but there's <U+017F>o much
to be <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t him, that that may be abated: Let all his Works be read,
and there will be found le<U+017F>s invention in them then in tho<U+017F>e of your old
Knights of the <hi>round Table.</hi> The whole <U+017F>ubject of the <hi>Iliads</hi> is briefly this,
That <hi>Bri<U+017F>eis</hi> being forced away from <hi>Achilles,</hi> he <U+017F>taid all alone in his Ship, and
would go no more to the Wars, during which time the <hi>Trojans</hi> made <U+017F>everal

them<U+017F>elves to that <U+017F>on of <hi>Peleus,</hi> who would not bear arms till his friend
<hi>Patroclus</hi> was dead he after this kils <hi>Hector</hi> in a duel, and having fa<U+017F>tn'd his body
behind his Chariot, drew it up and down through the Camp. Though this name
of <hi>Iliad</hi> <U+017F>eems to promi<U+017F>e an entire relation of the <U+017F>iege of <hi>Ilium,</hi> which is a
Fort, by which was meant the whole City; we find in <hi>Homer</hi> neither the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
nor ending thereof; and if we had it not from other Poets, we <U+017F>hould
have known nothing. 'Twas a <U+017F>trange want of judgement not to put down nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the cau<U+017F>es nor progre<U+017F>s of <U+017F>o great alterations: 'twould not have co<U+017F>t
him much; he had no more to do then to bring it in by way of relation from
<U+017F>ome old Captains to one new come into the Service: So that whereas we
now can hardly under<U+017F>tand what was done in two or three months of the War,
we <U+017F>hould then have been acquainted with the actions of ten years and above,
for he <U+017F>aies the <U+017F>iege of <hi>Troy</hi> la<U+017F>ted <U+017F>o long, which <U+017F>o embroyles our minds,
that we cannot imagin how both <U+017F>ides <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tand it out <U+017F>o long, and what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
adventures pa<U+017F>t between them. it had been better <hi>Homer</hi> had made it his
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to tell us that, <U+017F>o to leave a perfect work, then to have undertaken
that of the <hi>Ody<U+017F><U+017F>eys.</hi> But all this <U+017F>ignifies not much, for it may be <U+017F>aid he died
in his de<U+017F>ignes, or that <U+017F>ome of his works have been lo<U+017F>t; we mu<U+017F>t therefore
be content that he hath left us any thing worth our notice. In<U+017F>tead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>Olympus</hi> the war of his imaginary Gods fighting among them<U+017F>elves,
he brings them fighting among<U+017F>t men. He makes them rail at one another,
and commit <U+017F>uch palpable impertinences, that I know not how the <hi>Grecians</hi>
that did adore them, could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>uffer him. He makes the Gods carefull
and tender only of the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> as if there were no more people
in the world. They never <U+017F>peak of any other Nations, whereof there were no
<U+017F>mall number on earth and whom they were equally obliged to protect. But
though they are only troubled to make tho<U+017F>e two peoples fight, and ever and
anon have their A<U+017F><U+017F>emblies to that purpo<U+017F>e, and are as many for one <U+017F>ide as
the other, yet have they not the wit to reconcile the difference, and prevent the
ruine of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ignal Heroes in the Camp. Do you think it a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for men to <U+017F>ee <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> quarrelling every foot, when they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, husband and wife? Is it not a fine tale that <hi>Jupiter</hi> tels that
Godde<U+017F>s, when to threaten her, he asks her whether <U+017F>he had forgotten the time
that being angry with her, he hanged her up in the air with two anvils at her
feet? Was it not a fine <U+017F>ight to <U+017F>ee her in that po<U+017F>ture, was it not an invention
worthy a God? 'Twas indeed an expedient to make his wife longer by a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43725:183"/>

her, pre<U+017F>ented her with a drink, and <U+017F>he had a trick to put her husband a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>leep,
and in the mean time execute all her de<U+017F>igns; for though he were King
of Gods and men, yet he knew not what was done in the world while he <U+017F>lept
As for the Ornaments of this <hi>Iliad,</hi> you will find them all of a barrel, and
that <hi>Homer</hi> convers'd with no other Poetical figures then <U+017F>imilitudes; <U+017F>o that he
could not expre<U+017F>s the lea<U+017F>t engagement or <U+017F>cuffle of the Army, but by one;
but that which is mo<U+017F>t ridiculous is, that they are all of a <U+017F>ort. You will find
that a man that's mortally wounded and falls to the ground, is every where
compared to a Tree blown down by the wind, or cut down with an axe; and
what is yet more tedious is, that in every page almo<U+017F>t, you <U+017F>hall find <U+017F>ome He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
furiou<U+017F>ly a<U+017F><U+017F>aulting his enemies, ever compared to <U+017F>ome wild bea<U+017F>t rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
among a flock of <U+017F>heep, or a bird of prey, pur<U+017F>uing or devouring the le<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>er

in the world. The <hi>Grecians</hi> marching in battalia are compared to
Cranes which flie in Troops; and in a certain place where they make a great
noi<U+017F>e about <hi>Sarpedon</hi> who had been put to death, they are compared to flies
buzzing about the milk-pans and the chee<U+017F>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who <U+017F>hould have <hi>Patroclus</hi>'s body, are compared to the prentices of a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
liquoring an oxe-hide to make it <U+017F>upple, and pulling it with their nails to
<U+017F>tretch it. As for <hi>Homers</hi> language, it mu<U+017F>t be conceived the <hi>Greek</hi> is not too
pure or elegant, for that <U+017F>even Cities <U+017F>trove who<U+017F>e Citizen he <U+017F>hould be, was
only becau<U+017F>e he made u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>o many different dialects, <U+017F>o that it could never
be judged what Countrey-man he was; and I only leave it to be judg'd what
grace it were in one of our Poets, for to make up his rimes and cadences, to
huddle together, with the pure French, the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions and phra<U+017F>es of <hi>Ga<U+017F>cony,

with <U+017F>entences; but what <U+017F>entences are they doe you think? They are, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,

word, without <U+017F>eeking to Philo<U+017F>ophy, though a mans language know nothing
of the flowers of Rhetorick. There are a many that make u<U+017F>e of examples
drawn out of <hi>Homer</hi> as moral and political di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, as to <U+017F>ay that <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>

what commendation can ari<U+017F>e to him hence? Is there any thing <U+017F>o miraculous
in all this? Are not the lea<U+017F>t things in the world applicable thus? It will
be inculcated again, that if <hi>Homer</hi> be not to be e<U+017F>teemed for his language,
he <U+017F>hould be for the excellent precepts he gives Souldiers; and that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi>

among <hi>Darius</hi>'s Gods a rich Cabinet, <hi>Alexander</hi> thought nothing worthier to

this <U+017F>tory to be true, I <U+017F>ay the book is never the better for it, and that if
that Prince made <U+017F>uch u<U+017F>e of it, it was for want of other books: For is there
any likelyhood that he who was <U+017F>o great a Captain, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o highly e<U+017F>teem
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of Warr written by a man that was never in any, and <U+017F>peaks of Arms
with as much impertinence, as that a School-boy that were at this time to write
a Romance, could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly commit <U+017F>o many faults of judgement: Can
there be any greater then to make his Heroes relate long <U+017F>tories on their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogies,
or <U+017F>ome other as trivial di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, in the heat of the battel, when it
<U+017F>hould be conceived they had not time to breath, and that the re<U+017F>t who were in
the <U+017F>cufflle had not the lea<U+017F>ure to hear them? Is there any thing in the world
more ridiculous then that combat between <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi> which was fought
with a great preparation in <U+017F>ight of both Armies? The<U+017F>e two valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
having broke a Lance or two, fell to throw <U+017F>tones at one another, and
pre<U+017F>ently the Herald came and <U+017F>eparated them, fearing they <U+017F>hould come to
di<U+017F>pute the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s with their <U+017F>words: Is it not a plea<U+017F>ant combat to make
<U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e in the world as it does? Is it not another fair impertinence in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
engagement, to make <hi>Helenus</hi> who perceived that the <hi>Trojans</hi> had the
wor<U+017F>e, go and bid <hi>Hector</hi> charge <hi>Hecuba</hi> to pray to the Godde<U+017F>s <hi>Minerva?</hi>
why did he not go to her him<U+017F>elf, he who was a Prophet? Was there any
rea<U+017F>on that great Captain <U+017F>hould leave his Souldiers to go upon a me<U+017F><U+017F>age
which any boy belonging to the Army might do as well? and yet <hi>Hector</hi> was
<U+017F>uch a cock<U+017F>combe as to return to <hi>Troy,</hi> where he trifles away a deal of time
to talk with his wife, and play with his <U+017F>on, while the <hi>Grecians</hi> committed a
great <U+017F>laughter on their enemies. <hi>Alexander</hi> was too great a wit to think well
of this, and I could never imagin he could e<U+017F>teem him<U+017F>elf more unhappy then
<hi>Achilles,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he had not <U+017F>o good a voice to <U+017F>ing his prai<U+017F>es, <U+017F>ince he could
not but know that if his conque<U+017F>ts had been as fabulou<U+017F>ly de<U+017F>cribed as the
<U+017F>iege of <hi>Troy,</hi> the world would not have believed the lea<U+017F>t part of them. That
he cau<U+017F>ed a City to be built to the honour of <hi>Homer,</hi> there's not <U+017F>o much glory
in it as it conceived, <U+017F>ince he built another to the honour of his hor<U+017F>e. This
Poet hath nothing that can any way entertain great minds: He makes Heroes
do things mean and unworthy, they turn the <U+017F>pit, boyle the pot, and they are
<U+017F>uch gluttons, that to <U+017F>tir them up to their duty, their Captains are to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate
to them that they <U+017F>hall have the be<U+017F>t bits at the Fea<U+017F>ts, and their Goblets
full. It may be al<U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily ob<U+017F>erved that hone<U+017F>t <hi>Homer</hi> hath not ob<U+017F>erved any
decorum at all: and if we will pa<U+017F>s into the <hi>Ody<U+017F><U+017F>eys,</hi> we <U+017F>hall that when
<hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> was to depart the I<U+017F>land, where <hi>Calip<U+017F>o</hi> retained him, that Nymph makes
him build his own <U+017F>hip, as if <U+017F>he who was <U+017F>o powerfull could not have found
<U+017F>ome other to have taken that pains in<U+017F>tead of her Lover. But 'tis true, he
was not only a Carpenter, but a Joyner too, for he had made in her hou<U+017F>e a
fine bed-<U+017F>tead, having no other tool but a pair of Ci<U+017F><U+017F>ers, as he makes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to his wife at his return.</p>

who<U+017F>e travels are de<U+017F>cribed in it, is <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>imple fellow, that hearing a certain
Poet <U+017F>ing the Wars of <hi>Troy,</hi> at the relation whereof he <U+017F>hould have rejoyced,
<U+017F>ince he had gotten great fame there, he could never refrain weeping; and
yet his Ho<U+017F>t <hi>Alcinous</hi> is <U+017F>o well <U+017F>atisfied with his per<U+017F>on, though he had been
found naked as a worm at the river <U+017F>ide, that the very fir<U+017F>t day he asks him
whether he will be his <U+017F>on in law: But 'tis true, he makes the propo<U+017F>ition
very plea<U+017F>antly, and <U+017F>hews how little he de<U+017F>ires it <U+017F>hould take effect; for he
tels him at the <U+017F>ame time, that if he have no mind to <U+017F>tay any longer, he
will give him a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el to be gone.</p>

head; and if the good man be to relate any thing, he weeps exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively; and
the rea<U+017F>on why he gives over talking is (<U+017F>aies he) <hi>that it might not be thought it
was the wine that made him weep.</hi> I know no rea<U+017F>on why that <hi>Pallas,</hi> who was
<U+017F>o <U+017F>trong of his <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>hould not re<U+017F>tore him to his po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ions, without <U+017F>uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to commit <U+017F>o many <U+017F>implicities. From all this it may be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that <hi>Homer</hi> who was the author of all this, was but a Bagpiper, that beg'd
his bread from dore to dore, and would needs de<U+017F>cribe <U+017F>ome part of his own

are repre<U+017F>ented the voluptuous; and by <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> who kept him<U+017F>elf from that
charm<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> the vertuous and di<U+017F>creet per<U+017F>on<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but there is a <U+017F>ecret in this which ever
any Author was troubled with; <hi>Homer</hi> <U+017F>aies that <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> lay with <hi>Circe</hi> a whole
year together: Is this the rare example of continence that your Mythologi<U+017F>ts
find here; Were tho<U+017F>e who had but drunk of a plea<U+017F>ant poi<U+017F>on, more blamable then
he that had committed adultery with a <U+017F>orcere<U+017F>s? The Poet de<U+017F>irous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to take occa<U+017F>ion to make the <U+017F>hades of the dead, do <U+017F>omewhat in their
turn, makes it be told <hi>Circe</hi> that <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> mu<U+017F>t go to hell to <U+017F>peak with the divine
<hi>Tire<U+017F>ias,</hi> to know how he <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>erve him<U+017F>elf as he went into his Country,
as if <U+017F>he who was daughter to the Sun, and a knowing <U+017F>orcere<U+017F>s, could not have
done him a courte<U+017F>ie in that point; but there is be<U+017F>ides herein a notable imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency:
for without all the<U+017F>e ceremonies the <U+017F>illy fool might have as ea<U+017F>ily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Ithacia,</hi> as traver<U+017F>e a <U+017F>nacious Sea that brought him into the Countrey
of the <hi>Cimmerians,</hi> a horrid and folitary pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, through which he was to go
into hell.</p>
               <p>Thus are there an infinity of <U+017F>uperfluous things in the <hi>Ody<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi> as well as in the
<hi>Iliad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been brought about <U+017F>ome other way, without making a bea<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak.</p>
               <p>As for the adventure of the <hi>Syren's,</hi> was it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that this <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> who was
<U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e a man, <U+017F>hould be bound to keep him from going to them? As for the
principal occa<U+017F>ion of the Hi<U+017F>tory that mentions the young Lovers of <hi>Penelope,</hi>
who wooed her with <U+017F>o much beat; I find that too, extreamly impertinent; for
<U+017F>he having a <U+017F>on of age to beat arms, and twenty years being pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over <U+017F>ince,
mu<U+017F>t needs be at lea<U+017F>t forty years of age, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he could not rai<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
as <hi>Homer</hi> would make us believe.</p>
               <p>The <U+017F>ame thing may be in a manner <U+017F>aid of <hi>Helen,</hi> when <U+017F>he had continued
ten years in a City full of de<U+017F>olation, her beauty mu<U+017F>t needs be decayed, and
that might take away much of the eagerne<U+017F>s of having her in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>Now I have told you all that lies open to cen<U+017F>ure in this Poet; its time I
<U+017F>peak of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who without di<U+017F>pute<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> is more polite, as having conver<U+017F>ed with
great one, yet is he no more cen<U+017F>ure-proof then the other. I meddle not with
his <hi>Aeglogues,</hi> nor yet with his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> for 'tis not there he hath mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>hew'd
him<U+017F>elf a <hi>Poet,</hi> and fallen into fabulous narrations. We mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s immediately
to the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> and to <U+017F>hew you it de<U+017F>erves not the reputation it hath obtained,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43725:184"/>
be<U+017F>ides that the cha<U+017F>te <hi>Dido</hi> is there innocently calumniated, and that there
is a huge error in the Chronologie, in regard <hi>Aeneas</hi> could not go to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
which was not built in two hundred years after the taking of <hi>Troy;</hi> I
declare to you that there is not in that piece any thing of invention that may
<U+017F>urprize an ordinary mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aeneas</hi> being to<U+017F><U+017F>ed up and down at <U+017F>ea, <hi>Juno</hi> promi<U+017F>es <hi>Aeolus</hi> a wife
on condicion he perform her will, as <U+017F>he promi<U+017F>es one to <hi>Somnus</hi> in the
<hi>Iliad. Aeneas</hi> relates to <hi>Dido</hi> the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> with the <U+017F>tratagem of the
woodden hor<U+017F>e, which was an invention ab<U+017F>urd enough; but we mu<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e
this Author, <U+017F>ince it is borrowed of <hi>Homer,</hi> who mentions it in his <hi>Ody<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es.</hi>
He afterward gives an account of his Voyage, and how he e<U+017F>caped the
Gulfs of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> as <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> had done. If that <hi>Grecian</hi> took a
journey to hell, this <hi>Trojan</hi> mu<U+017F>t do the like; all that I wonder at is, how
they met not there.</p>
               <p>The exerci<U+017F>es which were at the Anniver<U+017F>ary of <hi>Anchi<U+017F>es,</hi> were the <U+017F>ame
which were at <hi>Patroclus</hi>'s death. <hi>Juturna</hi> helps <hi>Turnus</hi> in the fight, and
<hi>Venus</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts <hi>Aeneas,</hi> for the Gods are no le<U+017F>s concerned in all the<U+017F>e affairs
then in tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War. To quote yet a more <U+017F>tudied imitation,
as <hi>Thetis</hi> gave her <U+017F>on a buckler made by <hi>Vulcan, Venus</hi> gives her <U+017F>on one. I
forgot erewhile to <U+017F>peak of this <hi>buckler,</hi> though it be one of <hi>Homers</hi> mo<U+017F>t
egregious impertinences, becau<U+017F>e I would mention it with that of <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
that <U+017F>o I might compare them together. In the Buckler of <hi>Thetis</hi>'s <U+017F>on, the
heavens were repre<U+017F>ented, with all the <U+017F>ignes of the <hi>Zodiack, Vulcan</hi> had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
therein two different Cities, in the one there was nothing <U+017F>een but fea<U+017F>ting,
dancing, and marriages; and in the mid<U+017F>t of the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly might there be <U+017F>een
two Councellers pleading before the Judges; one <U+017F>aid he had <U+017F>atisfied the debt,
the other prote<U+017F>ted he had received nothing; and at length they agreed the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
<U+017F>hould be referred to arbitration, and the people ery'd out that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired
it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o. The other City was all in arms, by rea<U+017F>on of the many
factions among the Inhabitants; <U+017F>ome lay in ambu<U+017F>h near a River, where the
herds came to be watered, <U+017F>aies <hi>Homer,</hi> and as two Shepherds came near play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their pipes, they ru<U+017F>hed on them, and having killed them, carryed away
their oxen and their <U+017F>heep. This tumult being heard, there came others on
hor<U+017F>eback to fight the enemy; <hi>Vulcan</hi> had be<U+017F>ides made on this Buckler a
Harve<U+017F>t and a Vintage, with <U+017F>ome other conceits which I mention not. But was
not this an excellent piece of <U+017F>culpture? This comes nearer a true Hi<U+017F>tory
then a Picture; and as <hi>Homer</hi> de<U+017F>cribes it, it is to be believed that all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
he <U+017F>peaks of marched in the buckler, and fought one with another, and
talked <U+017F>o loud that you might have heard them. There was no le<U+017F>s want of
judgement in that of <hi>Aeneas. Virgil</hi> would per<U+017F>wade us that <hi>Vulcan</hi> had
inclo<U+017F>ed in it the whole fate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and thus he repre<U+017F>ents it to
us: He <U+017F>aies there was <U+017F>een in it the <U+017F>hee-Wolfe that <U+017F>uckled the twins, and
<hi>Rome</hi> at a little di<U+017F>tance, where the <hi>Sabine</hi> Virgins were ravi<U+017F>hed. There was
al<U+017F>o repre<U+017F>ented the Warre between the two peoples, and then their agreement
before the Altar of <hi>Jupiter; P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r<U+017F>enna</hi> there be<U+017F>ieged the City; <hi>Cocles</hi> cau<U+017F>es
a bridg to be broken under him. <hi>Cloelia</hi> cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed the <hi>Tyber</hi> on hor<U+017F>eback:
<hi>Manlius</hi> <U+017F>toutly defended the Capitoll; the Gee<U+017F>e awoke the <U+017F>leeping Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels.</p>
               <p>The Poet de<U+017F>cribes all the<U+017F>e things as if they had hapned all of a day. I
would fain know how all this could be repre<U+017F>ented in the <U+017F>ame place. For old
<hi>Rome</hi> who <hi>Romulus</hi> founded, was nothing like what it was in the time of the
<hi>Gaules:</hi> Be<U+017F>ides that, it mu<U+017F>t needs be very hard to repre<U+017F>ent a City <U+017F>ometimes
full of mirth, <U+017F>ometimes of war, <U+017F>ometimes be<U+017F>ieged by the <hi>Etru<U+017F>ei,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes
by the <hi>Gaules.</hi> All the<U+017F>e divers faces of affairs cannot be at once de<U+017F>cribed;
and <hi>Virgil</hi> <U+017F>peaks of <U+017F>o many particulars, that to make them be under<U+017F>tood
clearly, as he relates them; there mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity have been above fifty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43725:185"/>
in the buckler, like <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal pictures to repre<U+017F>ent the different
conditions of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other affair which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed at <U+017F>ome
di<U+017F>tance; but <hi>Virgil</hi> never troubled his thoughts with any <U+017F>uch order. It may
be now <U+017F>een how well he hath thrived in imitating his predece<U+017F><U+017F>or; and if there
were an exact inqui<U+017F>ition made, it will be found that other places lie as open to
cen<U+017F>ure. He <U+017F>aies <hi>Vulcan</hi> forged a Thunderbolt which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted of three
parts of rain, three of a moi<U+017F>t cloud, three of fire, and three of a <U+017F>outh-wind.
Is it not a huge ab<U+017F>urdity to make a Smith work in moi<U+017F>t things? This cannot
be pardoned him, unle<U+017F>s it be an<U+017F>wered that he is conformable to the other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
who <U+017F>peak diver<U+017F>ly of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> that the Gods have nothing which
comes not through his hands. He makes their Arms, he makes them Jewels
inriched with divers precious <U+017F>tones, he furni<U+017F>hes them with Chariots, and he
builds them hou<U+017F>es, <U+017F>o that at this rate it can never be di<U+017F>covered whether he
be an Armorer, a Gold<U+017F>mith, a Carpenter, or a Ma<U+017F>on?</p>
               <p>And thus is <hi>Virgil</hi> wanting al<U+017F>o, as to the di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing of things: nor can
I learn what age <hi>A<U+017F>canius</hi> was of when his Father went into <hi>Italy,</hi> for though
the Poet ordinarily <U+017F>peaks of him as a child to be carried in ones arms, yet he
attributes (very undecently) as much <U+017F>trength and valour unto him as to his
Father. Moreover he finds us more work when he <U+017F>peaks of the Golden
branch about which the Mythologi<U+017F>ts have <U+017F>weated <U+017F>o much; he <U+017F>aies that
that branch is like the Mi<U+017F><U+017F>eltoe that grows on Oaks; it mu<U+017F>t be then no <U+017F>mall
trouble to know what it is, <U+017F>ince it mu<U+017F>t be conceived to be infallibly the
Mi<U+017F><U+017F>eltoe it <U+017F>elf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> <U+017F>hall come next this Poet; as being his contemporary, and I <U+017F>hall
only quote his Book of <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is</hi> which is his Ma<U+017F>terpiece. His only
de<U+017F>igne in that Book was, to faggot together all the fables which his predece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ors
had invented; and if he added any thing not written before, they
were only old Tales he had learned of the Spin<U+017F>ters in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I oppo<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t all the Divinities he there mentions, that little Treati<U+017F>e
of mine, called the <hi>Banquet of the Gods,</hi> which I believe my Judge hath
read, and divers in this company; and as for his <U+017F>everal tran<U+017F>mutations, I
have already made them ridiculous enough by the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es I have divers
times made upon them in <U+017F>o many places, that there's none here pre<U+017F>ent
can pretend ignorance. Yet I <U+017F>hal add thus much, that though the Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is
be nothing but an extravagance, yet it is not <U+017F>o much to be found fault with
when there is a pertinent rea<U+017F>on given thereof, as to <U+017F>ay that <U+017F>uch a Lover
was Metamorpho<U+017F>ed into an hour-gla<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould have no more re<U+017F>t
after his death then he had before; but to make a man be changed into I know
not what Tree, and bring in no occa<U+017F>ion that carries any likelyhood of <U+017F>uch
a thing, then is it a thing below contempt.</p>
               <p>Now you <U+017F>hall find that <hi>Ovid</hi> fails in this particular almo<U+017F>t every where;
and for to quote his incongruities, a man mu<U+017F>t quote the whole book: I
will only touch at that which <U+017F>eems to be mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olid, and fulle<U+017F>t of Philo<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
I come to the Metemp<U+017F>ycho<U+017F>is, or tran<U+017F>migration of <U+017F>ouls he would
<U+017F>peak of. He puts down, That <hi>Pythagorus</hi> <U+017F>aid that he had <U+017F>ometimes been
<hi>Euphorbas,</hi> and that in the Temple of <hi>Juno</hi> he knew again the Buckler he had
u<U+017F>ed in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Warr: But how comes it that this impertinence hath
been <U+017F>uffered and he not laught at? I will not reproach it unto him, that
the tran<U+017F>migration of <U+017F>ouls out of one body into another is a fal<U+017F>hood; we
will forgive the<U+017F>e opinions in Heathen Poets; but on condition they bring
<U+017F>ome colour for their lies, and not <U+017F>uffer them to lie open to contradictions.</p>
               <p>Now here's a manife<U+017F>t one, not only in <hi>Ovid,</hi> but al<U+017F>o in all tho<U+017F>e who
<U+017F>econd him in the <U+017F>ame opinion: For they affirm that the God <hi>Mercury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <U+017F>end away the <U+017F>ouls that were in hell, to a<U+017F><U+017F>ume new bodies, makes
them drink of the river of oblivion, that having lo<U+017F>t all memory of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eries
they had <U+017F>uffered in the world before, they <U+017F>hould make no difficulty
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43725:185"/>
return thither. It may be infer'd hence, that <hi>Pythagorus</hi> could not call to
mind the parts he had plaid before, and if he could have done <U+017F>o, I would
have asked him why others had not the <U+017F>ame priviledg. I que<U+017F>tion not but the
chiefe<U+017F>t glory <hi>Ovid</hi> can pretend to is, to have knit together <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal
Narrations: But in <U+017F>pight of all the Pedants from whom I have heard that
<U+017F>aid ever <U+017F>ince I was a child, I will maintain that couching of them, to be
the mo<U+017F>t impertinent thing in that Poet: He that will fill a book with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<U+017F>tories, ought to ob<U+017F>erve <U+017F>ome order through his work; as for example,
he <U+017F>hould follow the Chronology, or treat of every thing according to the
<U+017F>everal heads which he divides his books into; but <hi>Ovid</hi> hath done no <U+017F>uch
thing. His <U+017F>tories do naturally and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly ari<U+017F>e out of the Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is,
they are nailed one to another; and 'tis ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>een he rather wanders then
follows a direct line, <U+017F>o that there's no memory ever <U+017F>o great and happy,
which reading his book, mu<U+017F>t not lo<U+017F>e the occa<U+017F>ion of the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e where it
is once interrupted. Some Metamorpho<U+017F>is having hapned, there chances to
be <U+017F>omebody that relates a thing as <U+017F>trange as that, and after his narration,
the Author introduces <U+017F>omewhat of his own, and then thinks him<U+017F>elf obliged
to <U+017F>peak of what had fallen out before in all that Countrey where this was
done. To be <U+017F>hort, his method is <U+017F>o un<U+017F>atisfactory, that I could never read
his book but I pittied him, and all tho<U+017F>e blind people that e<U+017F>teem him.</p>
               <p>There were <U+017F>ome other <hi>Latine</hi> Poets of his time, but they are not very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
or they have left behind them nothing but <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Epigrams,</hi> which
do us no hurt.</p>
               <p>I come forward to the <hi>Italian</hi> Poets. There's <hi>Ario<U+017F>to</hi> hath made a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>
that's pe<U+017F>tered with mo<U+017F>t ab<U+017F>urd inventions. His Fable is an imitation
of tho<U+017F>e of the Knights errants, and yet it contains many things taken out
of <hi>Ovids</hi> Metamorpho<U+017F>is. The flying hor<U+017F>e of <hi>A<U+017F>tolphus</hi> is the <hi>Pega<U+017F>us</hi> of
<hi>Per<U+017F>eus,</hi> and both tho<U+017F>e Warriers relieve a young Virgin expos'd to a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter.
Any one may find other relations: Be<U+017F>ides, the order is <U+017F>o disjoynted,
that there's above fifty <U+017F>tories heaped one on another. The Authour at <U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight times fini<U+017F>hes them, and will leave you two Knights with their
<U+017F>words lifted up ready to <U+017F>trike, to go and <U+017F>ee what another does; and then
he returns to them and makes them exchange two or three blows, and then
leaves them again.</p>
               <p>Thus does he make us langui<U+017F>h after his fooleries, and his Knights are
tran<U+017F>ported from one Countrey into another with as much <U+017F>peed as if their
hor<U+017F>es had wings.</p>
               <p>As concerning <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o,</hi> we are as much beholding to him as to <hi>Ario<U+017F>to,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
turn'd our Hi<U+017F>tory into a Fable. This la<U+017F>t hath made it equi<U+017F>itely imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent;
for though he be obliged to <U+017F>peak as a Chri<U+017F>tian in his <hi>Jeru<U+017F>alem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieg'd;</hi>
yet he makes nothing to talk as a Pagan, and bring all the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
divinities on the Stage. There are a many more who have thus made a
confu<U+017F>ion of things without any judgement; but its enough to condemn
them all at once.</p>
               <p>To come up to our own time, I <U+017F>hall bring in play the mo<U+017F>t famous Poet
that ever was in <hi>France:</hi> Any one may conceive I mean <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard;</hi> and what
reputation <U+017F>oever his works have gotten, I <U+017F>hall venture to encounter them.
Let a man con<U+017F>ider his <hi>Sonnets,</hi> his <hi>Poems,</hi> and his <hi>Elegies,</hi> they are all full
of ancient ab<U+017F>urdities; and as for his <hi>Hymnes,</hi> wherein he is thought to have
been mo<U+017F>t fortunate, pitch upon that of the four Sea<U+017F>ons of the year, which
is the mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>teem'd becau<U+017F>e the Fables are mo<U+017F>t of his own invention. The
Father and Mother which he attributes to the winter in one, are not attributed
in another; and thus does he make the Sea<U+017F>ons change parents to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
them to his de<U+017F>igne. As for his <hi>Franciad,</hi> the <U+017F>ame things in a manner
may be <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t it as again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e other pieces of Poetry we have already
quoted; for if <hi>Virgil</hi> hath imitated <hi>Homer, Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> hath imitated <hi>Virgil</hi> and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43725:186"/>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> together; but the imitation is <U+017F>o low and poor, that it will never be
forgiven him. If <hi>Pallas</hi> hides <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> in a cloud when he goes to King
<hi>Alcinous,</hi> and if <hi>Venus</hi> does the like for <hi>Aeneas</hi> when he goes to <hi>Dido, Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ard</hi>
mu<U+017F>t needs tell us that that Godde<U+017F>s did the <U+017F>ame favour for <hi>Francus</hi>
when he was to go to King <hi>Diceus,</hi> though he tels us not what nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity there
was that that Heros <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o hidden. This <hi>Francus</hi> had <U+017F>uffered <U+017F>hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
at Sea as well as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and his good Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F><U+017F>es mu<U+017F>t needs fall in
love with him: He <U+017F>lights them both, though they were very favourable to
him, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>till reflects on the de<U+017F>tinies who a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him he <U+017F>hall be the
founder of a new <hi>Troy.</hi> All this <hi>Aeneas</hi> does, and what is yet far more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
for a more punctual imitation of <hi>Homer, Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> cannot make his Heroes
go three <U+017F>teps without the command of <U+017F>ome God. Sometimes <hi>Mercury</hi> mu<U+017F>t
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Venus;</hi> one while he <U+017F>ees them in his <U+017F>leep, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when he is waking, and a third time he meets with <U+017F>ome auguries and
predictions, wherein is contained all <U+017F>hould happen to him; <U+017F>o that when
it comes to pa<U+017F>s, it mu<U+017F>t be repeated once again, nay a third time if there
be any body to relate it to, which is <U+017F>o tedious, that it is no <U+017F>mall trouble
to read him. Is it not <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame invention for want of other? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides,
would it not have been a rude impertinence among the very Pagans, to
believe that the Gods <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hift from one place to another <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly to
the relief of a mortal? The<U+017F>e Poets never <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e any addre<U+017F><U+017F>es by prayer
to tho<U+017F>e whom they have undertaken to honour, but they <U+017F>ay there was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
thunder heard on the left hand, to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure them that <hi>Jupiter</hi> heard them.
Thunder was very common in that time, in any <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on of the year. <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi>
mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o make his compari<U+017F>ons and de<U+017F>criptions like tho<U+017F>e he made his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons;
but though that be a thing hath gotten much e<U+017F>teem with others, for
my part it lo<U+017F>es with me.</p>
               <p>He makes it a great bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to de<U+017F>cribe the noi<U+017F>e of an axe <U+017F>triking again<U+017F>t
a tree, the great number of boards were <U+017F>awen to build Ships, how many
nails were employ'd, and the trouble there was to get the<U+017F>e great Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea. This is too mechanical, and I <U+017F>hould have wi<U+017F>hed he had rather
<U+017F>tudied to de<U+017F>cribe mens divers pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and things of greater importance;
it would have been a matter of greater advantage to the Readers. I will not
urge again<U+017F>t him his lewd rimes. He is <U+017F>o con<U+017F>cientious in point of rime, that
it cannot be judg'd whether <hi>Hectors</hi> <U+017F>on was called <hi>Francion</hi> or <hi>Francus;</hi> for,
to an<U+017F>wer <hi>Vanicus,</hi> he puts <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Francus,</hi> and to rime <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o? <hi>Nation,</hi> he <U+017F>aies
<hi>Francion</hi> I will not tell you that his Ver<U+017F>es are ill form'd, and that there are
faults in the <U+017F>yntaxe; I am <U+017F>o fair and gentle an adver<U+017F>ary, that I will not take
the utmo<U+017F>t advantage again<U+017F>t him. Let us only con<U+017F>ider the de<U+017F>igne which
<hi>Francus</hi> or <hi>Francion</hi> had to know things to come, which was not to go to hell
for it, but by calling up the <U+017F>hades thence, by the means of the Sorcere<U+017F>s
<hi>Hyantha.</hi> She brings up to him all the Kings of <hi>France</hi> his <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ors, and
thence had <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> the invention to bring in all our Hi<U+017F>tory in his <hi>Franciad,</hi>
which though it be a great volume, yet mentions only the fir<U+017F>t race, <U+017F>o that
there mu<U+017F>t be two books more as big, for to treat of <hi>Pipin</hi> and <hi>Capet:</hi> That
had been too too long and tedious, and would have carried with it a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
inequality: but what obliged him in the mean time, to mingle our
Hi<U+017F>tory with his Fables? <U+017F>ince <U+017F>o many Authors have written it, we knew it
well enough, and it would have <U+017F>uffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Hyantha</hi> related to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
<U+017F>on certain actions of <hi>Pharamond, Clodion; Meroveus</hi> and the other Kings.
Does he not <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf rather an Hi<U+017F>torian then a Poet? If it be objected
that this Sorcere<U+017F>s was able, word for word, to foretell things to come, and
that con<U+017F>equently <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t be made tell them; may not I an<U+017F>wer, that there
is no likelyhood that a per<U+017F>on po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with divine fury, as this Sorcere<U+017F>s was,
could deliver her <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>uch clear tearms, and that with <U+017F>uch a conduct<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> as if
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>poken of a thing pa<U+017F>t, who<U+017F>e particulars <U+017F>he had by heart. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43725:186"/>
and mo<U+017F>t credible prophecies that ever were, never had any <U+017F>uch order,
there is ever <U+017F>omewhat of ob<U+017F>curity, that they which know them, may not
forget them<U+017F>elves, but acknowledge tho<U+017F>e have alwayes need of God; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be to explain what they do not fully under<U+017F>tand, or a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them to
make that effectual to them which hath been revealed. Be<U+017F>ides all this, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive how it came about that <hi>Hyantha</hi> who was a gentile, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak
of <hi>Je<U+017F>us Chri<U+017F>t,</hi> the <hi>Church, Bapti<U+017F>m,</hi> and the contempt of <hi>Idols,</hi> as if <U+017F>he
had been already a Chri<U+017F>tian; and I wonder how <hi>Francus</hi> whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke
to, and who mu<U+017F>t admire the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trange novelties, <U+017F>hould never ask her what
<U+017F>he meant: If <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> had obtained the pen<U+017F>ions he pretended to, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he would have done nobler things. He would have obliged us <U+017F>o far as
to bring <hi>Hectors</hi> <U+017F>on to the banks of the <hi>Seine,</hi> to build the City of <hi>Paris</hi> to
the memory of his Uncle. 'Twas an excellent imagination to believe that he
would have called his City by the name of a man who had been the ruine of
all their Country and Family; he would rather have called it <hi>Hector. Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ard</hi>
had no great rea<U+017F>on to promote by his Poetry the ridiculous opinion of
<U+017F>ome fooli<U+017F>h Chronologers, who would have the <hi>French</hi> de<U+017F>cend from
this <hi>Francus,</hi> though the name be rather <hi>German</hi> then <hi>Phrygian,</hi> and that it
is not certain that there was a <hi>Hector,</hi> and that <hi>Troy</hi> was ever taken. Since
this Poet, there have been in <hi>France</hi> an infinite number of them of all <U+017F>orts; but
<U+017F>ince their works are but <U+017F>mall and incon<U+017F>iderable, and that without inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any fable, they have only renewed the ancient ones, I <U+017F>hall need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rea<U+017F>ons again<U+017F>t them, then what I have already alleadged again<U+017F>t ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as for example, that we mu<U+017F>t permit the ancients to be mad after their
mode; and if we <U+017F>hould talk idly in our way, and accommodate our <U+017F>elves
to our own times, as they did to theirs, we mu<U+017F>t make the Gods ride in
Coaches or Sedans in<U+017F>tead of Chariots, and we <U+017F>hould feign that <hi>Cupid</hi>
<U+017F>hoots at us with a Pi<U+017F>tol, in<U+017F>tead of an arrow, and the fiction were much
more natural: For <U+017F>ince it mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>et our brea<U+017F>ts a fire, it is much more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we are wounded with a flaming bullet, then with an arrow, who<U+017F>e
head were only of iron or <U+017F>ome other mettal.</p>
               <p>And thus indeed might the new Poets <hi>tran<U+017F>late</hi> and <U+017F>et up the ancient Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
again<U+017F>t which I am briefly to add this, That I find in it no certain rule,
and that I cannot imagin how the Gods <U+017F>hould be immortal, <U+017F>ince there are
<U+017F>ome of them <U+017F>ubject to old age. I am al<U+017F>o to wonder why <hi>Apollo</hi> is <U+017F>till young,
<U+017F>ince <hi>Saturn</hi> is grown decrepit, and <U+017F>ince I have heard talk of Gods and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
Gods, I could never imagin how any could be half a God.</p>
               <p>The divers Signes which the Poets have placed in the heavens, are no le<U+017F>s
di<U+017F>turbance to my thoughts; I <U+017F>hould only de<U+017F>ire to know whether there
were any <U+017F>tars in the firmament before they writ their Metamorpho<U+017F>is: But
if any tell me I am too capricious in <U+017F>ifting of Poetry, and that I am to blame
to endeavour to make it ridiculous, becau<U+017F>e the fables may haply be <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
my<U+017F>teries, and that there's not any thing which includes not <U+017F>ome hidden
<U+017F>ence; I an<U+017F>wer, That a man may find what he plea<U+017F>e by way of <hi>Allegory</hi> in
any relation that is, and that of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject, an inventive mind may
make a thou<U+017F>and explications; but this evinces not that the Poet had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne
to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch excellent truths under his fables; nay though I <U+017F>hould
grant that the Poets did purpo<U+017F>ly di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e certain <U+017F>ecrets, I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>till never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s
deny that any of them did it any thing fortunately. There's too much
confu<U+017F>ion in their fictions, to draw any thing certain out of them. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a fable a man may light of a piece of <hi>Mythologie,</hi> becau<U+017F>e a man
may give a thing any face at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight; but what follows <U+017F>hall have no
acquaintance with it; or if there be any, it will be with a very remarkable
violence.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Homer</hi> <U+017F>aies that <hi>Jupiter</hi> embraced <hi>Juno,</hi> and that the <U+017F>pring was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
under them; tho<U+017F>e who endeavour to explain it, <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43725:187"/>
the heaven, and <hi>Juno</hi> the air; and that when the air is warmed by the heat of
the heaven, the earth brings forth plants, as the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of that congre<U+017F>s. This
explication thus far is ea<U+017F>ily made, but how <U+017F>hall it be pur<U+017F>ued? Why
<U+017F>hould the air bear <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>pight to the <hi>Trojans?</hi> Why mu<U+017F>t <hi>Neptune</hi> too,
who is the Sea, be their enemy? Is it becau<U+017F>e <hi>Laomedon</hi> did not pay him his
hire for building their Walls with <hi>Apollo,</hi> who is the Sunne? What an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance
is it to <U+017F>ay that the Sea and the Sunne built the Walls of a City. But
let us <U+017F>ee whether <hi>Virgil</hi> do any better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aeneas</hi> is the <U+017F>on of <hi>Anchi<U+017F>es</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> 'twere bla<U+017F>phemy to take this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally;
for we mu<U+017F>t grant that a Godde<U+017F>s had pro<U+017F>tituted her <U+017F>elf to a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
But I will give the Mythologi<U+017F>ts leave to <U+017F>ay, that divers mortals have
been reputed the children of Gods and Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es, not that they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
begotten of them, but to in<U+017F>inuate that they were given to tho<U+017F>e things
which are in the power of tho<U+017F>e divinities. Thus the valiant are e<U+017F>teemed the
<U+017F>ons of <hi>Mars,</hi> able Mu<U+017F>itians the children of <hi>Apollo</hi> and the <hi>Mu<U+017F>es,</hi> and the
hone<U+017F>t drunkards the children of <hi>Bacchus:</hi> Upon the <U+017F>ame account <hi>Aeneas</hi>
is <U+017F>aid to be the <U+017F>on of <hi>Venus,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he was given to <hi>Love.</hi> This goes very
well thus far for this Godde<U+017F>s brings <hi>Aeneas</hi> to <hi>Carthage,</hi> where <U+017F>he makes
him enjoy <hi>Dido,</hi> and when he hath done, <U+017F>he promi<U+017F>es him another Kingdom
and another wife; but when <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t come into fights and relieve him, and
does other actions which have no relation with Love, what explication <U+017F>hall
we find for them, <U+017F>ince <hi>Venus</hi> hath ever been under<U+017F>tood to be the plea<U+017F>ure
which is found in amorous enjoyments? And thus the <U+017F>ence of fables, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
either by Phy<U+017F>icians or moral Philo<U+017F>ophers, is very cla<U+017F>hing and confu<U+017F>ed,
unle<U+017F>s they take things all to pieces as they plea<U+017F>e: But though this could be
<U+017F>o effectually done, as that it might <U+017F>erve for <U+017F>omewhat, yet would it not
ju<U+017F>tifie the extravagance of the Poets.</p>
               <p>What I have <U+017F>aid may <U+017F>uffice to <U+017F>hew the ab<U+017F>urdity of the<U+017F>e explications, and
it may <U+017F>erve for a rule to di<U+017F>cover all the re<U+017F>t. It's time I <U+017F>peak of the Poets
which are now in vogue, who invent not any fables wherein they pretend to
any truth, as being not able to advance any higher then Sonnets and Songs. I
need <U+017F>ay no more again<U+017F>t them then what I have <U+017F>aid already, when I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that their <hi><U+017F>miles,</hi> their <hi>charms,</hi> and a few <hi>drolli<U+017F>h</hi> expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, are the
greate<U+017F>t ornaments of their works, with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of a few <hi>Antithe<U+017F>es,</hi>
and <U+017F>ome <hi>Hyperboles.</hi> But I am to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you that they are now at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
pitch of their art, and that they cannot write any thing which they mu<U+017F>t
not vamp out of their Companions. All their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e things,
which they do <U+017F>o palpably, that they ea<U+017F>ily put us into an imagination that
their Poetry is like an old pair of breeches, which the Broker hath turn'd
and alter'd <U+017F>o often, that at length he knows not which <U+017F>ide to <U+017F>et out. Some
will <U+017F>ay that their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es eyes are Torches to burn over them when they
are dead; and others that they are Suns whence they receive their light and
life. There are <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>ome petty contradictions in their conceits, which
they accommodate after any fa<U+017F>hion to come to their purpo<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>It may be ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>een that all this is but a pure foolery, and that it is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
much of kin to Love, fit for tho<U+017F>e have nothing to do.</p>
               <p>There is yet among us another kind of Books again<U+017F>t which I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to <U+017F>peak. The<U+017F>e Books are called <hi>ROMANCES;</hi> and to <U+017F>peak
properly, 'tis <hi>Poetry</hi> in <hi>Pro<U+017F>e;</hi> there are a many fa<U+017F>hions of them. The fir<U+017F>t
that ever were <U+017F>een in <hi>France,</hi> treat only of <hi>Knighthood,</hi> but they are <U+017F>uch
Mon<U+017F>ters as I <U+017F>hall not meddle with; they are already quelled, and I am
confident there are not any in this company that e<U+017F>teem them. In<U+017F>tead of
their <hi>Enchantments,</hi> there are books which treat of things with much more
likelyhood, and that in my judgement, whereon they were all begotten, is
the Romance of <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> That Fable made after the manner of a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tory,
is not free from the <U+017F>otti<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s of the ancient Poets. All the per<U+017F>ons
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43725:187"/>
he introduces are commonly acquainted in their dreams with what they are to
do, <U+017F>o that for to procure good dreams they had no more to do then to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tle.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Gnemon</hi> whereof <hi>Heliodorus</hi> talks, is in my opinion a very impertinent
fellow: he would always repre<U+017F>ent the things which <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris</hi> relates to him
as if they were pre<U+017F>ent; and not being content to have <U+017F>aid that the ceremonies
of an Anniver<U+017F>ary were not pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed for him, and that the good old man mu<U+017F>t
needs let him <U+017F>ee them; he afterward importunes him to tell him who got the
race, becau<U+017F>e he is in as much perplexity for <hi>Theagenes</hi> as any then pre<U+017F>ent.
This humour is repeated too often to be plea<U+017F>ant, and that we may have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
like tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Guemon,</hi> we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay that the relation hath cau<U+017F>ed us
<U+017F>o much trouble as to the Prie<U+017F>t <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris.</hi> But what a contemptible fellow
was that young <hi>Grecian!</hi> though <hi>Heliodorus</hi> makes him the <U+017F>on of an <hi>Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite,</hi>
yet we are to believe he was one of a low poor <U+017F>pirit. He ever and anon
<U+017F>hakes for fear, and hath no more courage then a woman; but indeed it was
fit he <U+017F>hould not be much more valiant then <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who is the principal
per<U+017F>on in the <U+017F>tory This man is not guilty of any generous actions, and I know
not to what purpo<U+017F>e are introduced the Hi<U+017F>tory of the <U+017F>iege of <hi>Syenea,</hi> nor the
fight between the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> <U+017F>ince he hath no part in <U+017F>o great
tran<U+017F>actions, and is but a poor captive in chains; whereas it might have been
as ea<U+017F>ie for the Author to have imployed him in <U+017F>ome noble exploits of war,
and <U+017F>o have given us <U+017F>ome true <U+017F>atisfaction. <hi>Heliodorus</hi> hath al<U+017F>o forgotten
to make his <U+017F>tory compleat: He <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>poken with <hi>Theagenes</hi>'s parents
as well as tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Chariclea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> be<U+017F>tows his daughter in marriage on a <U+017F>tranger, who
can hear no news out of his Country. This Hi<U+017F>tory de<U+017F>erves well to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with that of the <hi>Loves</hi> of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Cloe;</hi> the Author makes
the<U+017F>e young people <U+017F>o fooli<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creet both together, that there can be
nothing more unlikely: but that which puts me quite off patience is, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that book hath been the occa<U+017F>ion that divers others have written books
of Shepherdry, and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you they have imitated it <U+017F>o well, that they make
all their Shepherds ba<U+017F>tards, not knowing neither father nor mother no more
then <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Cloe;</hi> and that when they were children, they had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away in their cradles by the overflowing of a River, and were afterward
found by <U+017F>ome body that brought them up. See if <hi>Bapti<U+017F>ta Guarini</hi> in his
<hi>Faithfull Shepherd</hi> be not <U+017F>uch a fool as to make u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ame invention,
and if a very many others do not the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>till, as if it were of the e<U+017F><U+017F>ence
of Shepherdry to be lo<U+017F>t in the infancy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had Books of <hi>Shepherdry</hi> before us, <hi>Montemajor</hi> hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed
them with his <hi>Diana,</hi> wherein I find no order at all. Nay what is
more, I meet with nothing in it but fables and enchantments concerning <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia.</hi>
This Sorcere<U+017F>s had a Chamber wherein <hi>Orpheus</hi> was kept inchanted,
though the Poets <U+017F>ay he was di<U+017F>membred by the Prie<U+017F>te<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Bacchus</hi> at
<hi>Thebes.</hi> He plaid on his Harp, and as he <U+017F>ung he acquainted the Shepherds
the Statues of what Ladies tho<U+017F>e were about him: They were the Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es
of <hi>Spain,</hi> who<U+017F>e lives the Author might very well have known; and this is a
huge piece of ingenuity, which a many Authors are beholding to, to relate by
way of prophecy what hath been done in their own times. They foretell
things after they are come to pa<U+017F>s. 'Tis true, the fir<U+017F>t of our Shepherds, that
is to <U+017F>ay, <hi>Ollenix</hi> of <hi>Mont<U+017F>aere</hi> hath no <U+017F>uch thing in his Pa<U+017F>torals of <hi>Julietta,</hi>
but he had done better to imitate that, then have done what was wor<U+017F>e. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
his books into daies, and brings the Shepherds together out of the fields
and thickets, and never tels us whether they retire, nor how they live. There
are a many Satyrs which lie in ambu<U+017F>h for the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, but that may be
forgiven, <U+017F>ince it may be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed he <U+017F>peaks like the Poets, who make tho<U+017F>e ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Gods as frequent in the woods, as if they were but Boars or Stags. It is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43725:188"/>
al<U+017F>o no le<U+017F>s to be ob<U+017F>erved what he makes tho<U+017F>e do who<U+017F>e loves he de<U+017F>cribes.
His Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es are the mo<U+017F>t impudent things in the world, they do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
di<U+017F>cover their pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions to the Shepherds without any mode<U+017F>ty; but they
run after them through hills and dales, as it were to force them to their Loves.
Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es and their ver<U+017F>es are <U+017F>o abominable, that if I read but a leaf,
'tis enough to put my thoughts out of order for fifteen daies, if I do not <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
take <U+017F>ome antidote.</p>
               <p>All the adventures a man meets with are no other, then that the Shepherds
and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es avoid, or <U+017F>eek one another; but to make amends for this,
when they are altogether in the <U+017F>ame place, there's <U+017F>ome one relates a <U+017F>tory
every day. Though they are many times Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es that are put upon this
task, yet they confidently cite <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Authors, (as if it were to
be conceived that ru<U+017F>ticall per<U+017F>ons, nay and women, had read <U+017F>o much) and
which is more, they bring in the choice<U+017F>t examples out of the Philo<U+017F>ophers
and other illu<U+017F>trious men. Be<U+017F>ides the Author not con<U+017F>idering that he made
them all heathens, makes them quote divers pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages and per<U+017F>onages of the
Bible. As for example, there was one <U+017F>aid,</p>
               <p>That as <hi>Tobias</hi> who was blind and de<U+017F>titute of all things, became through
the means of the Angel more happy then ever he had been; <U+017F>o that poor Lover
of whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>peaks, came to be happy by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his Page, whom God
<U+017F>tirred up to relieve him.</p>
               <p>'Tis as true that <hi>Ollenix</hi> does very much ob<U+017F>erve the Chronology: For though
by all circum<U+017F>tances it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem that his Pa<U+017F>torals are things as ancient as
the birth of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> <U+017F>ince there have not been <U+017F>ince that time in <hi>Arcadia</hi> any
<U+017F>uch as he de<U+017F>cribes; yet the find <U+017F>tories that his Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es tell, relate to
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the<U+017F>e times, one at <hi>Vevice,</hi> another at <hi>Florence,</hi> and a third at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona;</hi>
nay there are <U+017F>ome <U+017F>o late as that they happened in the reigne of the
great King of <hi>France.</hi> The Shepherde<U+017F>s that <U+017F>peaks, commends that Prince,
as though <U+017F>he had known him, which is the gro<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t impertinence that can be;
for though this were not a mi<U+017F>take of the Authors, as to the time, yet is it an
over<U+017F>ight great enough, in regard <U+017F>uch <U+017F>avage people as he brings in, could
not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly know <U+017F>o many particulars of <hi>France,</hi> which lay at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
from them.</p>
               <p>After <U+017F>o many defaults of judgement, and the profanation of <U+017F>o many
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of holy Scripture as he hath quoted to <U+017F>o little purpo<U+017F>e, I believe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
favour, that if this Author were now living, they could do him no le<U+017F>s
favour then <U+017F>end him to the Gallies for having <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>pent his time. Nor hath
<hi>England</hi> wanted its <hi>Arcadia,</hi> whereof it is not long <U+017F>ince we have had the
tran<U+017F>lation. I find no more order in that then in the re<U+017F>t, and there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things whereof I am not at all <U+017F>atisfied. At the very beginning you have
the complaints of the Shepherds, <hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Clavis</hi> upon the departure of
<hi>Vrania,</hi> without telling us who <U+017F>he was, nor whither <U+017F>he went. Now an
Author ought never to begin his book, but he <U+017F>hould mention the per<U+017F>ons
principally concern'd in the Hi<U+017F>tory, who<U+017F>e actions he is to rai<U+017F>e up beyond
any of the re<U+017F>t; yet this man makes afterward no more mention of the<U+017F>e two
Shepherds then if he had never named them; and though he bring them in
again at <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ports before <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilius,</hi> yet that <U+017F>ignifies nothing, <U+017F>ince a man
finds no period of their adventures, and that tho<U+017F>e ver<U+017F>es wherein they <U+017F>peak
of their Loves, are <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>cure, that they may be taken for the Oracles of a
<hi>Sybill.</hi> It is true that Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> dying young, might have left his
Work imperfect; but there's no rea<U+017F>on we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer by that misfortune,
and be obliged to take a thing for perfect becau<U+017F>e it might have beene made
<U+017F>o.</p>
               <p>There's nothing now hinders me from <U+017F>peaking of <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> which I put
after the <hi>Arcadia,</hi> as being a later piece, though we had <U+017F>een it before the
other. I know there are a many defend it, but <U+017F>ince I have put my<U+017F>elf on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43725:188"/>
this task, can it be thought I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay nothing of it? Is it fit that Book
<U+017F>hould be called <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> <U+017F>ince that in all the volumes of it there is more
<U+017F>poken of <hi>Diana, Galathea, Silvia</hi> and others, then of that Shepherde<U+017F>s?
When <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>peaks in good earne<U+017F>t, and gives greater te<U+017F>timonies of his foul
incon<U+017F>tancy, mu<U+017F>t it not be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed he is a fool in the highe<U+017F>t degree, and
that con<U+017F>equently he is not <U+017F>lighted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s he ought to be? If I could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded
he is no fool, and that he did it in a merry humour, I an<U+017F>wer, It is
a great omi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, in <U+017F>uch large di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es not to have let <U+017F>lip one word to tell
us <U+017F>o, and withall to <U+017F>atisfie us as to what <U+017F>cruples we might conceive upon
the inequality of his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I am in doubt whether the rea<U+017F>ons of his Philo<U+017F>ophy
are alwaies good, and whether he do not <U+017F>ometimes fall into the <U+017F>ubtile<U+017F>t of
<hi>Platonical Idea's.</hi> All the Hi<U+017F>tories which are related concern <U+017F>trange per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons,
but there is but one and the <U+017F>ame invention to bring them all into <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>ts;</hi>
'tis ever <U+017F>ome <hi>Oracle</hi> <U+017F>ends them thither. There are al<U+017F>o in <U+017F>ome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
very long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, which I wi<U+017F>h the Author had never made, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to make the work compleat. Then might we have made a more
certain and <U+017F>olid judgement of them. But I dare affirm, from what we have
in our hands, that there is no likelyhood there were in Forre<U+017F>ts any Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
<U+017F>o civiliz'd in <hi>Meroveus</hi> his time, <U+017F>ince we have the a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tory
that all the <hi>Gauls</hi> were in tho<U+017F>e times very <U+017F>avage. I have ob<U+017F>erved al<U+017F>o
a horrid fault in the <hi>Chronology;</hi> for <hi>Childerick</hi> having <U+017F>ucceeded his father,
and having been driven out of his Kingdom in the time when all the<U+017F>e Loves
happened, <hi>Clotilda</hi> had remained a long time with her Uncle, and was at
lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ixteen years of age, as <U+017F>he is de<U+017F>cribed. Now <hi>Childerick</hi> was eight
years in exile, and he reigned fifteen years afterward, and his <U+017F>on <hi>Clovis</hi> did
not marry <hi>Clotilda</hi> till <U+017F>eaven years after his death, <U+017F>o that by this account
this Prince<U+017F>s was above five and forty years of age, whereas our Hi<U+017F>tories
tell us, that <U+017F>he was very fair and very young.</p>
               <p>If the Author mu<U+017F>t needs invent fables of <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> they might have been
<U+017F>o couched into the Hi<U+017F>tory, as not to make any di<U+017F>order of time. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
all this, and many other things over tedious to relate, that Book
hath gotten <U+017F>o into the vogue, that I have divers times heard <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and his
companions <U+017F>ay, that it was the <hi>Breviary</hi> of the <hi>Amorous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are other <hi>Romances</hi> which <U+017F>peak not of <hi>Shepherds,</hi> but <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>Gentlemen.</hi> We have of this kind the <hi>Argenis,</hi> a book I am not <U+017F>o ready to
grant that reputation to that many doe. You find in the beginning.</p>
               <p>That the Vniver<U+017F>e had not yet ador'd <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the Ocean given place to
<hi>Tyber,</hi> when, upon the Coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the River <hi>Gelas</hi> enters the Sea,
there arriv'd in the Port a <U+017F>trange <U+017F>hip, out of which came a<U+017F>hore a young Knight,
tran<U+017F>cendently hand<U+017F>om.</p>
               <p>Who <U+017F>ees not but this ob<U+017F>ervation is too general for <U+017F>o particular a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance?
Had the que<U+017F>tion been about the conque<U+017F>t of one of the four parts
of the world, or that an univer<U+017F>al change of Religion and Cu<U+017F>tomes had
hapned over the whole earth, it haply would not have beene unhand<U+017F>ome
to note the time <U+017F>o particularly; but <U+017F>ince it only concerns the time of a
Ships arrival in <hi>Sicily,</hi> it had been enough to have <U+017F>aid what it was of
the clock, whether it was night or day, Summer or Winter; or what could
have beene mo<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>umed, it might have been permitted to relate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
the affairs of that I<U+017F>land were in at that time. To be <U+017F>hort, no
man will deny me but that if the Authour had <U+017F>aid that <hi>Meleander</hi> reigned
at that time in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and that <hi>Lycogenes</hi> who had taken up Arms again<U+017F>t
him, was upon the point of concluding a peace when <U+017F>uch a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>ell arrived
into the Haven, it had <U+017F>poken more judgement. When there is a failing in
the fir<U+017F>t word, I know not what may be expected in the pur<U+017F>uit: You find
immediately after, that a Lady finds two young Knights <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>ome, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43725:189"/>
<U+017F>he made a vow to have their pictures, and though <U+017F>he accompli<U+017F>hed not
her vow till a long time after, the Authour diverts from the narration
to relate certain ver<U+017F>es which <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed to be put under the picture: This
is a di<U+017F>turbance of the order, to acquaint us with a thing which was not
very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. You will find al<U+017F>o all through the book, certain ver<U+017F>es
which are thru<U+017F>t in to interrupt the Hi<U+017F>tory: and I know not any which
are not un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably brought in, except <U+017F>ome hymnes that are <U+017F>ung to the
honour of the Gods: As for the divers adventures that are in it, there is
not any thing more miraculous then what we find in ordinary Love-<U+017F>tories.
A young Prince is brought up ob<U+017F>curely, for fear he might have beene
made away: Certain robbers carry him away, and <U+017F>ell him to a King,
that makes as much of him as if he were his own <U+017F>on. This King lo<U+017F>ing a
battel, the young Prince is taken and carryed into his Country, where he is
redeemed by his mother. A while after it being di<U+017F>covered what he was, the
fame of <hi>Argenis</hi>'s beauty makes him fall in love with her. He goes into <hi>Sicily</hi>
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed as a maid to live with her. Certain Rebels being de<U+017F>irous to have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
K. <hi>Meleander,</hi> he defends him, and after he had made him<U+017F>elf known to his
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, goes away. A while after he returns again in mans habit, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the favour of <hi>Meleander</hi> and <hi>Argenis;</hi> but at length his enemies force
him to quit <hi>Sicily:</hi> He is carried twice into <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and the <U+017F>econd
time he relieves the Queen of that Countrey. She <U+017F>ends him back with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chombrotus,</hi>
who is acknowledged to be the <U+017F>on of <hi>Meleander,</hi> who quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the pretentions he had to marry <hi>Argenis,</hi> he re<U+017F>ignes her to <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a <U+017F>ummary of all the <U+017F>tory wherein I find not ought to be ravi<U+017F>hed
at. On the contrary, I think it <U+017F>hould be very unplea<U+017F>ant, <U+017F>ince the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomes
of Countreys are not ob<U+017F>erv'd, and that there was never any <U+017F>uch
government in <hi>Sicily</hi> as you find there. Tho<U+017F>e who pretend to critici<U+017F>mes, tel us
there is a key to the <hi>Argenis,</hi> but I fear me the lock is <U+017F>o much out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that it cannot open that Cabinet, where we are promi<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch
rarities. They will have <hi>Meliander</hi> to be <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Poliarchus Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the fourth, and <hi>Argenis</hi> to be <hi>France;</hi> but though the Authour <U+017F>hould
have meant it <U+017F>o, what ground is there to make an Analogy between our
<hi>Hi<U+017F>tory</hi> and tho<U+017F>e divers Romantick adventures? You find indeed that the
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of State relate to our way of Government, and when he <U+017F>peaks
of the <hi>Hyperefanians,</hi> all the world knows he means the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> that
<hi>V<U+017F>inulca</hi> is <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Aquilius</hi> the <hi>Emperour:</hi> but we go no further, and
when we have known all the<U+017F>e explications we have learned but very triviall
and ordinary things.</p>
               <p>Why <U+017F>hould we love truth better under a vail then when <U+017F>he is naked?
Some may haply come and tell me I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>peak of this book as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Romance, as being full of maxims of State which prefer it before
all other; doe but read any book that treats of nothing but Politick know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
and you will find a hundred times as much in it. That this book rai<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it <U+017F>elf into <U+017F>uch an e<U+017F>teem at the beginning was, becau<U+017F>e in other Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
tho<U+017F>e things were not commonly <U+017F>o frequent, and the Authours
made it their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to de<U+017F>cribe the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. Be<U+017F>ides, any other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
whatever were as much to the purpo<U+017F>e as tho<U+017F>e you find in the <hi>Argenis,</hi>
and I wi<U+017F>h the Authour had <U+017F>et him<U+017F>elfe rather to <U+017F>peak only things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Archombrotus</hi> found <hi>Poliarchus</hi> at his Mothers, the<U+017F>e two Lovers
became furious at the fir<U+017F>t interview; they <U+017F>hook again for indignation, and
viewed one another from head to foot, as two men that were upon the
point to fight. All this is good; but I would fain know whether they
<U+017F>poke or no, and what they <U+017F>aid in the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Hyamisbe,</hi> who mu<U+017F>t
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43725:189"/>
needs oblige them to <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Two words would have <U+017F>atisfied me;
but this was the harde<U+017F>t nut of all to crack. The<U+017F>e Authours when they
fall into <U+017F>uch lurches, pa<U+017F>s over them <U+017F>lightly, and I have ob<U+017F>erved in very
famous Books, that when a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was to be made on <U+017F>ome tickli<U+017F>h
occa<U+017F>ion, you only find that <U+017F>uch a one <U+017F>aid <U+017F>ome fine words to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
and we are <U+017F>atisfied; but when it comes to an ea<U+017F>ie conjuncture, you have
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es in their full length. As for any e<U+017F>teem may be made of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
of the <hi>Argenis</hi> I am clearly of the contrary opinion, for there are
a many new words which were never currant at <hi>Rome,</hi> <U+017F>o that if <hi>Salust</hi>
returned into the world, he would hardly under<U+017F>tand it. A man may
lawfully add <U+017F>ome words to a language that is in vogue, becau<U+017F>e u<U+017F>e may in
time naturalize them; but we mu<U+017F>t leave a dead language <U+017F>uch as we
find it in the Monuments of Antiquity, and it is <U+017F>acriledg to meddle
with it.</p>
               <p>Now I am to let you know what a thing the Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> is. I
prote<U+017F>t to you that book hath no invention in the world. The Authour
having heard that the be<U+017F>t Romances <U+017F>hould be full of miraculous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
hath no other <U+017F>ecret to win us into admiration, then to make a many
unexpected rencontres, wherewith he hath filled his book, which is a thing
very low and extream tedious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> coming from <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta</hi>'s relieves her father again<U+017F>t Robbers in the
Forre<U+017F>t of <hi>Fontainbleu;</hi> the next day he is <U+017F>econd to <hi>Claranges</hi> again<U+017F>t
<hi>Lidian</hi> his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es brother. <hi>Cleander</hi> leaves his wife to go to <hi>Holland</hi>
with the<U+017F>e brave adventures: There <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> relieves the husband and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta.</hi> They return like <U+017F>trange Knights to challenge <U+017F>ome
French at a Tournament, which done, they take off their Helmets, and
di<U+017F>cover them<U+017F>elves. <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> being in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> <U+017F>ick, is comforted by a
Capuchin, whom he finds to be <hi>Claranges,</hi> and being gone like a Pilgrim to
<hi>Mont<U+017F>errat,</hi> he finds <hi>Cleander</hi> and his <U+017F>ervants clad like <U+017F>laves, having
been taken by a Pirate upon the Coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Genua</hi> as they returned from <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly.</hi>
The Sermon being begun, they find the Preacher to be <hi>Lidian,</hi>
whom an amorous de<U+017F>pair had forced into devotion, as well as his rivall
<hi>Claranges.</hi> They bring him back to <hi>Paris,</hi> and di<U+017F>cover them<U+017F>elves in the<U+017F>e
habits one after another.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Cleander,</hi> and many other adventures, <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi>
goes over to a Tournament in <hi>England,</hi> where he fought again<U+017F>t <hi>Lidian,</hi>
and at length knew him, and <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> who were there upon
the <U+017F>ame occa<U+017F>ion. In the mean time <hi>Lucidan</hi> having demanded leave of the
King to fight with <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> who had killed his Uncle; his father <hi>Adra<U+017F>tus</hi>
appears for his <U+017F>on, <U+017F>o does <hi>Dorylas Cali<U+017F>tas</hi>'s father, and <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta</hi> her <U+017F>elf di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>ed.
The <hi>Amazon Hypolita</hi> makes a fourth; but the combat is <U+017F>taid by
the coming in of <hi>Lidian, Alcedon,</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> who had been <U+017F>eparted
from <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> by a Tempe<U+017F>t. Not to tell you the whole book by heart, you
<U+017F>ee by the<U+017F>e examples, it contains nothing but meetings and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es.
Some are <U+017F>eparated, others return, and then they all meet at an hour, <U+017F>o that
the Authour deals by the<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons as a Puppet-player by his Puppets, makes
them enter and <hi>exit</hi> off the Stage as he plea<U+017F>es. And this is all the <U+017F>ubtilty
in it.</p>
               <p>There are other pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages farre enough from probability of being <U+017F>o as they
are related. Who will believe that <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> having hurt <hi>Cloridan</hi> with a

rage could animate them to <U+017F>uch a mi<U+017F>chief, <U+017F>ince <hi>Cloridan</hi> denied he knew
any thing of it? Yet a while after, the Author wanting an invention to find
his <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> fighting work, brings him a challenge from that <hi>Cloridan:</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:43725:190"/>
As for the <hi>Operatour</hi> that dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the cloathes in <U+017F>tead of the body, 'tis a
Magick I permit in a <hi>Romance.</hi> But as to the <U+017F>pirit that appears to <hi>Cleander</hi>
and prays him to bury his body which was in the bottom of a wel, methinks
it is a tale made in imitation of that of <hi>Athendorus,</hi> but not <U+017F>o good, for
certain Pagans were of belief, that tho<U+017F>e who were not buried, were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the <hi>Ely<U+017F>ian</hi> fields; but as for Chri<U+017F>tians, that they are <U+017F>o care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be put into holy ground, 'tis onely out of devout cu<U+017F>tom, and
tho<U+017F>e that mi<U+017F>s of it are not accounted the le<U+017F>s happy for that, <U+017F>o that it is
not credible a <U+017F>oule can be troubled with the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations in the other
World, and di<U+017F>turb its own re<U+017F>t, to come and de<U+017F>ire one to bury the body
wherein it had once dwelt: But this <U+017F>pirit is be<U+017F>ides very complementall;
it asks <hi>Cleander</hi> whether he will command him any <U+017F>ervice into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
whither he goes. As for his promi<U+017F>e to give him notice of his death
three days before it <U+017F>hould happen, 'tis a que<U+017F>tion whether God permits
any <U+017F>uch premonitions. For my part I believe they are onely Saints have
that favour done them. Yet this <U+017F>pirit comes one morning to give <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
notice of his death; but the manner of it is very plea<U+017F>ant. 'Tis thought
that <U+017F>pirits can in a moment tran<U+017F>late them<U+017F>elves whither they plea<U+017F>e, and
can finde us as ea<U+017F>ily in the bottom of a Sellar, as on the top of a Tower:
They need no <U+017F>taires to go up not down by, nor yet door nor window to
come in at: But this knocks at <hi>Cleanders</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle gate till the Gentleman
him<U+017F>elf came and opened; but it was out of mode<U+017F>ty, becau<U+017F>e he would no

               <p>'Tis as hard a thing to believe that a young <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, <U+017F>uch as

'twere the mode of <hi>France</hi> to goe <U+017F>o in times of peace, or as if we <U+017F>till li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

accu<U+017F>er of <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta</hi> to fight with any that <U+017F>hould defend her. She in the

cu<U+017F>tome. There are other <U+017F>trange accidents, as when <hi>Hippolita</hi> and
her maid <hi>Erifila</hi> keep the Arms at the Tournament. He <U+017F>hould not have
put in adventures <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>coverable for lies; for they are <U+017F>o extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,

length the water having cea<U+017F>ed, they read the Prophe<U+017F>ies which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thereon. The Author tells us not whether this was done by art, or
by Enchantment, for he knew not him<U+017F>elf, and his de<U+017F>igne was to pur<U+017F>ue

to <U+017F>peak thus. Sirs, This Gentleman, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, hath <U+017F>poken the

            <p>This fellows impertinence was in<U+017F>upportable; <hi>Clarimond</hi> was <U+017F>uffered to <U+017F>peak

de<U+017F>erved to be to<U+017F>t in a blanket. Be<U+017F>ides, it was thought ba<U+017F>e in him to <U+017F>peak
again<U+017F>t what he had promi<U+017F>ed to maintain; but he could not have kept his word
had he endeavoured it, becau<U+017F>e he had not read all the books that <hi>Clarimond</hi>

cau<U+017F>e in the world might not <U+017F>uffer any prejudice for want of defence. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond</hi>

there's nothing to be found but may be cen<U+017F>ured; but O ye Gods!
does he not fear, that <U+017F>o many excellent men as he hath injur'd, may not be

The latter I am more then confident of; and I doubt not but I <U+017F>hall
<U+017F>ay whatever makes for my purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>hall not want the <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>tion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of tho<U+017F>e excellent Genius's. Ah! <hi>Divine Homer,</hi> who would ever have
thought it would have been nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to <U+017F>eek rea<U+017F>ons for thy defence in <U+017F>o
great an A<U+017F><U+017F>embly as this? Yet it mu<U+017F>t be done: and <U+017F>ince thy <hi>Iliad</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<U+017F>ed,
as containing only the fights which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed in the <U+017F>olitude of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
with the death of <hi>Patroclus</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi> it <U+017F>atisfies to an<U+017F>wer that it was
not thy de<U+017F>igne to do any more, and as thou <U+017F>ai<U+017F>t in the beginning, thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended<U+017F>t
only to write of the anger of the <U+017F>on of <hi>Peleus:</hi> The re<U+017F>t of the
Hi<U+017F>tory was <U+017F>ufficiently well known among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> <U+017F>o that thy pains
were well <U+017F>pared; and as for the name <hi>Iliad,</hi> which is al<U+017F>o condemn'd, it is
proper enough, <U+017F>ince the fights it treats of happened during the <U+017F>iege of <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
As for the <hi>Gods</hi> whom the Poet makes <U+017F>o valiant in this war, as if the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> were the only men in the world, there's nothing to be
wondred at, for at that time they were more con<U+017F>iderable then all the world
be<U+017F>ides: and it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to engage the force of <hi>Europe</hi> again<U+017F>t that of
<hi>A<U+017F>ia.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides, though the <hi>Iliad</hi> mentions only the care of the Gods over
tho<U+017F>e people, it infers not they had forgotten the re<U+017F>t, nor yet that <hi>Homer</hi>
had forgot them; but they could not be <U+017F>poken of without digre<U+017F><U+017F>ing from
the matter in hand. And that tho<U+017F>e whom the<U+017F>e different divinities affect
mo<U+017F>t, are not alwayes delivered from misfortunes, is not to be wondred at,
<U+017F>ince they are <U+017F>o divided that one power oppo<U+017F>es another. As for their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<U+017F>ome
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43725:191"/>
quarrels, they are things pardonable in Fables. I come to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>ons
which <hi>Clarimond</hi> finds <U+017F>o much fault with, becau<U+017F>e they are taken
from hunting. To what can fighting be better compared then to that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e
which is as it were a novice<U+017F>hip to the War. That <hi>Homer</hi> makes his
Warriors <U+017F>ometimes like furious bea<U+017F>ts; is it not the greater miracle, in <U+017F>o
much as it <U+017F>o divercifies the accidents by compari<U+017F>ons, that they <U+017F>eem to be
quite different, though they are drawn from the <U+017F>ame bea<U+017F>t. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he often draws his compari<U+017F>on from a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and if a great <hi>Heros</hi> be to
fight with <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>erable <U+017F>ouldier, he <U+017F>aies 'tis as if a Lyon <U+017F>hould fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <U+017F>heep; if there comes <U+017F>ome brave Captain to relieve that Soldier, he
compares him to a good Shepherd that will defend his flock; and if one
<hi>Heros</hi> fight with another, 'tis as if one Lyon fought with another. And
thus he goes on, and for my part I find it an incomparable grace. For when
he <U+017F>peaks of the <U+017F>ame men, he ever u<U+017F>es the <U+017F>ame compari<U+017F>ons, which is much
more rational then to make them <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Suns,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes <hi>Trees,</hi> and
<U+017F>ometimes <hi>Rivers.</hi> The <U+017F>everal natures of <U+017F>o many things cannot be found
together. As for the other compari<U+017F>ons, they are not <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>cene and low
as is imagined. <hi>Clarimond</hi> finds fault al<U+017F>o with the Language, and <U+017F>ayes
<hi>Homer</hi> <U+017F>poke not good <hi>Greek,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>o many Countries di<U+017F>puted about
him who<U+017F>e child he <U+017F>hould be: but he is to know that it is al<U+017F>o <U+017F>aid he is not
any Countryman on earth, but that he came down from heaven. If he u<U+017F>e
divers dialects, and <U+017F>ome words which are <U+017F>trange to other common authors,
'tis becau<U+017F>e Poetry being the language of the Gods, hath a peculiar <U+017F>tile
which is not familiar to men. I will go no further for a te<U+017F>timony of the
excellence of his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, then the comon opinion, that he is full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
which generally <U+017F>erve all mankind. His <U+017F>entences are not <U+017F>o low; as
you have been told, but they cannot be otherwi<U+017F>e conceived; and if you
find not in them that maje<U+017F>ty that is expected, we are to blame <hi>Clarimond,</hi>
who by his tran<U+017F>lation of them into <hi>French,</hi> hath rob'd them of tho<U+017F>e
beauties which they have in their own language. The mo<U+017F>t learned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophers
have <U+017F>ought them out to ground their tenents on, and the Painters
and Armorers, and the <U+017F>ubtile<U+017F>t mechanicks, have acknowledged <U+017F>o much
from this Poet, that they confe<U+017F>s they have learned their profe<U+017F><U+017F>ions of him.
He is accordingly called the Ma<U+017F>ter of all Arts, and he is painted vomiting,
and all the other Poets licking what he had ca<U+017F>t up. As for Military per<U+017F>ons,
they are the mo<U+017F>t beholding to him for his in<U+017F>tructions, and out of his
Works may be learned with what courage a man <U+017F>hould a<U+017F><U+017F>ault his enemies.
how <U+017F>ouldiers <U+017F>hould obey, and the Generals command, and with what
ma<U+017F>culine eloquence a Captain <U+017F>hould encourage his troops. As for the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es
of the Heroes in the mid<U+017F>t of a fight, they are not <U+017F>o irrational:
They might have been come out of the charge, as being weary of fighting,
and in the time of that repo<U+017F>e, they might di<U+017F>cover them<U+017F>elves one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As for the combat of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi> that they made u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>tones,
is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange, <U+017F>ince fury thinks no weapons ami<U+017F>s. That e<U+017F>teem which
<hi>Alexander</hi> and others had of <hi>Homer,</hi> is no fiction; all Hi<U+017F>torians agree in
it, and there was never any imagined that that great Poet did ever doe any
thing indecent: In his time, and in that of <hi>Achilles's,</hi> Luxury and Pride
did not reigne as they do now, <U+017F>o that the Heroes might well conde<U+017F>cend to
dre<U+017F>s what they ate them<U+017F>elves; and to mention that delicacies <U+017F>hould be
pre<U+017F>ented to them at Fea<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>hews the honour was done them even to tho<U+017F>e
<U+017F>mall circum<U+017F>tances, which haply cu<U+017F>tom had in tho<U+017F>e times made the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t.
If <hi>Vli<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> built a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity forced him to a thing which was not
di<U+017F>honourable to a Warriour, and it was only a great Boat which needed
not a Carpenter <U+017F>o much to help him, be<U+017F>ides that the <U+017F>olitude of his Nymph
would have been troubled with the <U+017F>ight of <U+017F>o many other men. And as for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43725:192"/>
the bed he tels <hi>Penelope</hi> of, he might have done <U+017F>omewhat by way of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the pa<U+017F>times of Princes are divers. In fine, the places and the times
might have rendred tho<U+017F>e things commendable, which now <U+017F>eem ridiculous.
As for the lowne<U+017F>s of <U+017F>pirits which my adver<U+017F>ary objects to <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi> I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it to be fal<U+017F>e. That this great Heros wept at the relation of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi>
Warr, 'twas not for the hard<U+017F>hips he had endured there him<U+017F>elf, but
tho<U+017F>e of his friends, and perhaps he wept out of affection, which is a thing
permitted the mo<U+017F>t generous; it may be he regretted the ab<U+017F>ence of his
wife; <hi>Alcinous</hi> knew his condition by his maje<U+017F>tick countenance, though he
had been found naked, and the proffer he made him of his daughter, is a
certain argument of the re<U+017F>pect he bore him. If this <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> be ill handled
by the Lovers of <hi>Penelope,</hi> the fault is to be imputed to them, or at the wor<U+017F>t
to his di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, which was <U+017F>o far nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that he could not get into his
own hou<U+017F>e but by <U+017F>ome artifice, his ancient acquaintances being much lo<U+017F>t.
It was the will of <hi>Pallas</hi> he <U+017F>hould go through tho<U+017F>e afflictions, who would
not pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>uccour him as <U+017F>he might have done, to <U+017F>hew that the Divinity
will not help us unle<U+017F>s we al<U+017F>o help our <U+017F>elves; and permits the good to <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
to recompence them afterwards with happine<U+017F>s far tran<U+017F>cending their
former mi<U+017F>ery. I will not grant <hi>Clarimond</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> was a beggar, and got
his living by <U+017F>inging at dores; I know divers have been of that opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
he was blind, and that <U+017F>uch mu<U+017F>itians commonly are <U+017F>o; but 'tis not
likely a beggar could conceive <U+017F>uch rare things. Where <U+017F>hould we have
learned the art of War, and the councels of Captains? Are the<U+017F>e things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to low-<U+017F>pirited per<U+017F>ons? If it be true that <U+017F>uch a Mu<U+017F>ician could
<U+017F>ing the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>Ody<U+017F><U+017F>ey</hi> through all <hi>Greece,</hi> I <U+017F>hould rather believe he
had compo<U+017F>ed tho<U+017F>e incomparable Works, then that he did only own them,
having found them in the Authors notes, who was <U+017F>ome great per<U+017F>on of the
age. <hi>Clarimond</hi> de<U+017F>irous to di<U+017F>credit the <hi>Ody<U+017F><U+017F>ey,</hi> would have us believe
there's nothing in't but Country-Tales; but the worthy things of it he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits:
Is not that courte<U+017F>ie of <hi>Polyphemus</hi> to <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> an excellent pa<U+017F><U+017F>age,
where he tels him that he will eat him the la<U+017F>t becau<U+017F>e he gave him good
wine? could the humour of a <U+017F>avage be better repre<U+017F>ented? As for the
name of <hi>Nobody</hi> which <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> took on him, the <U+017F>ubtilty was <U+017F>o fortunate
that the other <hi>Cyclops</hi> <U+017F>ought not after him to puni<U+017F>h him for the mi<U+017F>chief
he had done to their companion, becau<U+017F>e they believed <hi>Nobody</hi> had <U+017F>truck
out his eye, but that he had done it him<U+017F>elf. When an action is incon<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in it <U+017F>elf, yet if great effects follow it, 'tis thought great. The Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morpho<U+017F>is
of <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> companions follows, and <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>cofs at this Heros,
in that he re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted the charms which had cau<U+017F>ed the others to be transformed,
and <U+017F>uffered him<U+017F>elf to be <U+017F>o carried away by the care<U+017F><U+017F>es of the <hi>Sorcere<U+017F>s,</hi>
that he openly lay with her; but I <U+017F>hall here find a Mythology <U+017F>hall take
away the contradiction, and <U+017F>hew that <hi>Homer</hi> hath not made <hi>Vly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

Cele<U+017F>tial influence which incited the <hi>Grecians</hi> to follow plea<U+017F>ures; they <U+017F>uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Cele<U+017F>tial influence, and that when he is confident that it advi<U+017F>es him
to nothing but what is vertuous, he <U+017F>huns it not, but joynes him<U+017F>elf to it by
a happy marriage, that all things it <U+017F>ignifies may come to pa<U+017F>s to his own
glory. And thus we may <U+017F>atisfie tho<U+017F>e that imagin there are any ab<U+017F>urdities
in fables. As for the rencontre of the <hi>Syrens,</hi> it is al<U+017F>o taken for example in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
noble occa<U+017F>ions, and there are <U+017F>uch excellent Mythologies in it, that it's a

                           <hi>Circe</hi> would have him go thither, to <U+017F>ee what wonders were there, that he
might be encouraged to live well by the reward of the good, and the puni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the bad. Thus is there nothing <U+017F>uperfluous in <hi>Homers</hi> Works<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and
if in the <hi>Iliad Achilles</hi>'s hor<U+017F>e prophecies, 'tis to <U+017F>hew us that the Divinity
will <U+017F>ometimes make u<U+017F>e of irrational creatures to tell us of our duty. I have
no more to <U+017F>ay upon this occa<U+017F>ion, but that though <hi>Penclope</hi> had been as old
as <hi>Clarimond</hi> would make her, yet it was not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but that many
young men might court her, were it only for her means. And as for <hi>Helene,</hi>
though her beauty might lo<U+017F>e much of its glory, yet <hi>Menelaus</hi> might have
tryed all means to have her again, as if <U+017F>he had been as fair as ever, and he
as deeply in love with her, in regard he and all the <hi>Greeks</hi> were re<U+017F>olved and
<U+017F>worn to the enterpri<U+017F>e; and if they had left <hi>Troy</hi> without doing any thing,
it would have been a great di<U+017F>credit to them. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having <U+017F>ufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cen<U+017F>ured <hi>Homer,</hi> falls upon <hi>Virgil;</hi> and I am not to wonder he <U+017F>hould
fight again<U+017F>t Poetry in the gro<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ince he attacques this Poet. He blames
him for making <hi>Aeneas</hi> go to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and 'twas for that he obtained the
greate<U+017F>t reputation among the <hi>Romans.</hi> They thought it a wonderfull piece
of conduct, to have gone <U+017F>o high for the motive of the Warr between <hi>Rome</hi>
and <hi>Carthage,</hi> when the di<U+017F>pute was for nothing but the Empire of the
World. The City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> the Patrone<U+017F><U+017F>e of it, bore an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
hatred in his opinion again<U+017F>t the race of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who had for<U+017F>aken
<hi>Dido,</hi> and thence aro<U+017F>e the Wars between the <hi>Punick</hi> Nation and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
'Tis true, the<U+017F>e are but Poetical fictions, yet they give the mind great
<U+017F>atisfaction. As for the places where <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wars of <hi>Troy,</hi> in the per<U+017F>on of one of the mo<U+017F>t illu<U+017F>trious Heroes that were
there, 'twas fit he <U+017F>hould conform him<U+017F>elf to his <U+017F>tile who had fir<U+017F>t writ on
that <U+017F>ubject. <hi>Clarimond</hi> here takes occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>peak of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Buckler in
relation to that of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> for that agitation of mind, whereinto the de<U+017F>ire
to calumniate had put him, hath been the rea<U+017F>on that being at a lo<U+017F>s in his
order, he hath confounded many things. He blames <hi>Homer</hi> for de<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
what was engraven in this Buckler, becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem to make the
Hi<U+017F>tory the more true: but will he not acknowledge that if the Poet being
to <U+017F>peak of the pleading of two Advocates, and the fighting of two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Factions, if he make the Reader as 'twere hear their noi<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ee them
march to do their nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary actions, he does as good as <U+017F>ay that the work was
<U+017F>o perfect, that by the only countenances of the per<U+017F>ons that are <U+017F>een there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
it might be conceived they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch things, and by what
they did then, might be judged what they had done, and what they <U+017F>hould do.
Thus it appears <hi>Homer</hi> hath rather done a miracle in this ca<U+017F>e, then commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any fault of judgement; and for <hi>Virgil</hi> in the Buckler of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erves
not to be cen<U+017F>ured for having graven in it the mo<U+017F>t remarkable things
<U+017F>hould happen to <hi>Rome.</hi> It may be they were <U+017F>evered by divi<U+017F>ions, as <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
would have it; but <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e they were not, and that there had been
but one City of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Buckler, and that in one place there was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented
the Bridg broken under <hi>Horatius Cocles,</hi> and in another the <hi>Capitoll
be<U+017F>ieged,</hi> and at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance another thing, though they were adventures
<U+017F>hould happen at <U+017F>everal times, the invention was by <U+017F>o much the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for this bearing the nature of a Prophecy, things mu<U+017F>t have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ed,
to be conformable to the cu<U+017F>tome of the Divinities, who<U+017F>e Oracles
have ever <U+017F>omewhat of ob<U+017F>curity. From hence <hi>Clarimond</hi> falls into frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
reprehen<U+017F>ions, and is angry that <hi>Virgil</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay that <hi>Vulcan</hi> forged a
Thunder bolt for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of three darts of rain, and three of

perceive that this is <U+017F>poken my<U+017F>teriou<U+017F>ly, and that <hi>Vulcan</hi> <U+017F>ignifies that <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile

air that is changed into fire in the upper region, and violently breaking
through what ob<U+017F>tacles do environ it, makes that noi<U+017F>e which we call thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
cau<U+017F>ing at the <U+017F>ame time the rain to fall out of tho<U+017F>e moi<U+017F>t clouds which
it hath bur<U+017F>t a<U+017F>under. Thus do the Phy<U+017F>icians hide their <U+017F>ecrets under the<U+017F>e
fables, and that <hi>Vulcan</hi> is Jack of-all-trades among the Gods, 'tis to <U+017F>hew
that the operations both of Art and Nature are not effected without fire, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
corporal or <U+017F>piritual, which is the vehemence of the action, or the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the workmen. <hi>Clarimond</hi> troubles him<U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o with trivial particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities,
as to know the true age of <hi>A<U+017F>canius,</hi> and whether it was a golden
bough that <hi>Aeneas</hi> found. He quarrels too much with words, and I think
therefore de<U+017F>erves no an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> He con<U+017F>iders not the excellent phra<U+017F>e of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
nor the <U+017F>weet fluency of his Ver<U+017F>es, which is <U+017F>o apparent, that one that
under<U+017F>tands no <hi>Latine</hi> may perceive it. He next <U+017F>ets upon <hi>Ovid,</hi> and blames
him <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on, that he will never meet with any of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He thinks it not well that he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak of <U+017F>o many different Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;
as if he could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>peak of any thing el<U+017F>e in a time wherein he
was bred up in idolatry. As for his <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es,</hi> they are not <U+017F>o extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
as he would make them at lea<U+017F>t to make them appear <U+017F>o he <U+017F>hould have
quoted them; but for his part, he mentions only the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> of
<hi>Metemp<U+017F>ycho<U+017F>y.</hi> If that Philo<U+017F>opher had never been <hi>Euphorbas,</hi> 'twas his
fault that fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>et the <U+017F>tory on foot, not theirs that writ it <U+017F>ince; yet if a
man would maintain he had <U+017F>aid truth, he might ea<U+017F>ily do it, though it be
held that <hi>Mercury</hi> made the <U+017F>ouls drink the water of oblivion when they a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>um'd
new bodies; For it may be imagined that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> alone had the
priviledg not to drink of it, that he might tell others that he had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times in the world, and that it was <U+017F>o with them all, as who pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into the bodies of bea<U+017F>ts, that <U+017F>o they might ab<U+017F>tain from all creatures
that had any <U+017F>oul in them. <hi>Clarimond</hi> endeavouring to bring <hi>Ovid</hi> quite
into di<U+017F>credit, hath not <U+017F>tuck to <U+017F>ay that there is no order at all in his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
He <U+017F>hould have con<U+017F>idered that <hi>Ovid</hi> is a <hi>Poet,</hi> and not an <hi>Hi<U+017F>tori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and that if he ob<U+017F>erved that order which Hi<U+017F>torians mu<U+017F>t not tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F>s,
his Metamorpho<U+017F>es had not been near <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant. <hi>Poetry</hi> is an <hi>art</hi> full of
<hi>fury,</hi> who<U+017F>e ornament is <hi>variety,</hi> and this is the rea<U+017F>on that <hi>Ario<U+017F>to</hi> for our
greater diver<U+017F>ion, hath <U+017F>o interlaced his narrations. Nor is <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o</hi> to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for quoting the ancient Divinities in his de<U+017F>criptions; he were no Poet
that <U+017F>hould not u<U+017F>e Poeticall figures. And <U+017F>o I pa<U+017F>s by all tho<U+017F>e Poets which
may be vindicated in that one word; and now I come to <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard,</hi> whom
<hi>Clarimond</hi> hath al<U+017F>o pre<U+017F>umed to quarrel with, and reproach with a many
things he hath <U+017F>aid concerning the ancient <hi>Divinities,</hi> and his de<U+017F>ign to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> I cannot put my <U+017F>elf to the trouble to an<U+017F>wer his
impertinent rea<U+017F>ons, for they were <U+017F>o feeble that I did not regard them nor
<U+017F>uffer them to make any impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion on my mind. I only remember that he
blamed <hi>Pre<U+017F>ages,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other <hi><U+017F>uper<U+017F>titions,</hi> without which a man cannot
<U+017F>peak <hi>naturally</hi> of any matter of Antiquity. He al<U+017F>o rejects the de<U+017F>cripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which have made <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> highly famous and e<U+017F>teemed; for the di<U+017F>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
of a <hi>Poet</hi> <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>o <hi><U+017F>evere</hi> as tho<U+017F>e of a <hi>Stoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<U+017F>ometimes for the diver<U+017F>ion of the readers, 'tis haply nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary he <U+017F>hould
digre<U+017F>s to the de<U+017F>cription of the noi<U+017F>e of a Cart-wheel when it is overburthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or the cryes of birds of prey when they fight. As for the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of
<hi>Ron<U+017F>ards</hi> ver<U+017F>e, it could have been no greater con<U+017F>idering his time. All the
world confe<U+017F>s that the honour of having opened the dore to the advancement
of the French Tongue is due to him. Another thing my adver<U+017F>ary quarrels
at in his <hi>Franciad</hi> is, that all our Hi<U+017F>tory is thru<U+017F>t into it; but is there any
thing <U+017F>o clear as that <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> began to write in a Poetical <U+017F>tile, <U+017F>o that there
would have been no inequality in the piece though he had fini<U+017F>hed it? And
if <hi>Clarimond</hi> think it ill that <hi>Hyanta</hi> <U+017F>hould relate things in <U+017F>uch order as if
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43725:193"/>
<U+017F>he had read an effective <U+017F>tory out of <U+017F>ome book, and if he think her expre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions
too clear for a Prophete<U+017F>s in a fury, I will not condemn him, becau<U+017F>e I
<U+017F>aid erewhile that Prophecies ought to be ob<U+017F>cure; for I maintain hers were
<U+017F>uch, and my rea<U+017F>ons <U+017F>hall be but what <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath <U+017F>aid him<U+017F>elf. He <U+017F>aies
that <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke of the my<U+017F>teries of <hi>Chri<U+017F>tian</hi> Religion, which
though we who under<U+017F>tand them, think a thing clear, yet <hi>Francus</hi> could
not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly hear any thing more ob<U+017F>cure. To <hi>Clarimonds</hi> que<U+017F>tion, Why
he de<U+017F>ired not to know what it was, and how <hi>Hyanta</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak of <U+017F>uch
things being a <hi>Pagan,</hi> I an<U+017F>wer, That <hi>Francus</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed it by as a thing unknown
that touched him not; and as for <hi>Hyanta,</hi> <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the <U+017F>pirit
that made her <U+017F>peak that <U+017F>he knew not what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid her <U+017F>elf. I doubt
not but <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> would have given us this <U+017F>atisfaction, had he continued his
work. As for the de<U+017F>igne he had to bring <hi>Francus</hi> into the Country of the
<hi>Gaules</hi> there to build a City, he is very unju<U+017F>tly blamed, <U+017F>ince that being a
Poet, he was permitted to feign what he plea<U+017F>ed, be<U+017F>ides that his fiction was
not at <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>tance from the truth, but it had the warrant of mo<U+017F>t of our
Hi<U+017F>torians. When <hi>Clarimond</hi> had cen<U+017F>ured <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard,</hi> to whom <U+017F>o many Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
of his time gave place, he could not but contemn all the re<U+017F>t, yet hath he
not pre<U+017F>umed to <U+017F>ift their works, le<U+017F>t it would have been too much pains, for
it mu<U+017F>t be conceived it could be no <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition to <U+017F>earch out rea<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o
de<U+017F>tructive to the common opinion: He therefore generally condemns them
all, becau<U+017F>e they have quoted the ancient Fables. It mu<U+017F>t not be believed in
his opinion<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that there can be any good <hi>Mythologies,</hi> whereas we have <U+017F>uch
abundance of mo<U+017F>t excellent ones, that I know not how he hath been <U+017F>o im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
as to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o. I pa<U+017F>s by all his proofs as being of no weight. I know
my Judge hath read books enough to have learned the contrary to what he
hath alleadged. But it is to much purpo<U+017F>e for me to be angry with a man
who cannot be reconciled to the Poetry of the pre<U+017F>ent age. Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
that <U+017F>o many excellent wits as are at the Court could never do any thing
to <U+017F>atisfie him? Their <U+017F>weet <U+017F>ongs, are they not able to charm him and make
him change his opinion? But here he comes to the <U+017F>econd part of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and falls foul upon the books he calls <hi>Romances.</hi> He hath dealt mo<U+017F>t
unworthily by the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Hi<U+017F>tory, and not finding any thing in that
piece de<U+017F>erving ju<U+017F>t cen<U+017F>ure, he quarrels with little formalities. He thinks it
not fit that <hi>Pagans</hi> <U+017F>hould regard their dreams who are <U+017F>o ful of <U+017F>uper<U+017F>tition.
That natural impatience that <hi>Gnemon</hi> is in to know the end of a Hi<U+017F>tory,
he would make a <U+017F>trange incongruity, and not con<U+017F>idering that the world is
furni<U+017F>hed with cowards as well as <U+017F>tout men, he falls out with the Author for
making that young man fearfull. Though <hi>Theagenes</hi> hath di<U+017F>covered his
genero<U+017F>ity in all actions what<U+017F>oever, yet he excu<U+017F>es him not, and thinks he
hath not done enough. He would al<U+017F>o per<U+017F>wade us that the Loves of <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
and <hi>Cloe</hi> are impertinent, though they excell in an incomparable natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.
And there he begins his controver<U+017F>ie with <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals,</hi> again<U+017F>t which, all he
can <U+017F>ay is, that the books which treat of that <U+017F>ubject, imitate one another.
This makes nothing again<U+017F>t them, if <U+017F>o be they are good; and what he hath
alleadged again<U+017F>t <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Montemajor</hi> is of no great weight. Though the
order of it <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>turbed, yet were the thing no le<U+017F>s plea<U+017F>ant, and as for
the Fables and Enchantments in it, all's pardonable. As for the <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals</hi>
of <hi>Julietta,</hi> I think my <U+017F>elf the more obliged to vindicate that book, as being
the fir<U+017F>t was written in <hi>France</hi> of that kind. The happy condition of a
Shepherd to which heaven hath called me, engages me to do it. To an<U+017F>wer
therefore what <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath <U+017F>aid of the Works of <hi>Ollenix</hi> of <hi>Mont<U+017F>acre,</hi>
I <U+017F>ay that if that Author mentions not the abode of his Shepherds, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
little particulars; 'tis becau<U+017F>e they are of no concernment. That he
makes the maids court the men, 'tis only to repre<U+017F>ent that they lived as 'twere
in the <hi>golden age,</hi> during which the laws of <hi>honour</hi> were not invented. And if
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43725:194"/>
in relating Hi<U+017F>tories, they quote prophane and <U+017F>acred Authors, and mention
things hapned in our times, the rea<U+017F>on is, that all being fiction, and it being
granted it is the Author that <U+017F>peaks all through, he hath taken the liberty to
accommodate things as well to this age as to the ages pa<U+017F>t, for the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of the readers. He is not therefore to be cen<U+017F>ured for that; and as for
<hi>Sidney</hi>'s <hi>Arcadia,</hi> <U+017F>ince it hath cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed the Sea to come and <U+017F>ee us, I am <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Clarimond</hi> receives it with <U+017F>uch poor complements. If he hears nothing
of the Loves of <hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Clavis,</hi> he mu<U+017F>t not quarrel with the Author
who hath made his Book one of the mo<U+017F>t excellent in the world. There are
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of <hi>Love</hi> and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of <hi>State</hi> <U+017F>o generous and plea<U+017F>ant, that I
<U+017F>hould never be weary to read them. I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay much in his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were I not in ha<U+017F>te to <U+017F>peak of <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> which <hi>Clarimond</hi> brings in next,
and I am very glad to find that Book generally e<U+017F>teemed, which <U+017F>hould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him to e<U+017F>teem it al<U+017F>o. If in<U+017F>tead of the Title of <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> it had born
that of <hi>Galathea</hi> or <hi>Diana,</hi> he would have made the <U+017F>ame complaint he does:
he would have asked why that Title more then another: But does he not
con<U+017F>ider that the book begins with the Loves of <hi>A<U+017F>traea</hi> and <hi>Celadon,</hi> and that
mo<U+017F>t of the other Hi<U+017F>tories are but circum<U+017F>tances, <U+017F>o that the de<U+017F>ign is very
excellently taken. I mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o tell <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that <hi>Hylas</hi> may be incon<U+017F>tant,
and yet not be mad, as he <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es, and that there are in the<U+017F>e daies a many
more incon<U+017F>tant then he. As for <hi>Sylvander,</hi> if his Philo<U+017F>ophy be <hi>Platonick,</hi>
it is <U+017F>o much the better, <U+017F>ince it is that Philo<U+017F>opher hath taught us to love <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely.</hi>
If it be alleadged that in the time of <hi>Meroveus</hi> and <hi>Childerick,</hi>
there were no Shepherds in <hi>Forre<U+017F>t</hi> could be acquainted with <U+017F>o much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and civility as the<U+017F>e, 'tis very indi<U+017F>creetly <U+017F>poken. Who knows not but
that in books, things are rai<U+017F>ed to the greate<U+017F>t perfection, and that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
mind that compo<U+017F>ed the <hi>A<U+017F>traea,</hi> hath he not made it appear that he
doth not relate the Hi<U+017F>tories of ob<U+017F>cure per<U+017F>ons, but de<U+017F>cribes a <U+017F>ort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
of quality who<U+017F>e names and condition he di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>es? And if the order
of his narration had been nicely ob<U+017F>erved, he would not have been found to
fail in the <hi>Chronology,</hi> that's only a vain illu<U+017F>ion to frighten us withall. And
that <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>hould be angry that he hath not perfected his Book; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<U+017F>tice
is it! what imprudence! will he not anon quarrel with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
We were not worthy to have amon<U+017F>t us any longer that wonderfull
man whom death hath taken away from us: but I hope <U+017F>ome able pen will
oblige us by the accompli<U+017F>hment of what he hath de<U+017F>ign'd according to his
excellent notes and directions. Yet <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing this were not to be hoped, I dare
affirm, that though there wants a conclu<U+017F>ion to this Work, yet it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as perfect. He that is ignorant of it, let him read it, he will be <U+017F>uddenly
ravi<U+017F>hed into admiration, he will find what will make him <U+017F>light all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of our adver<U+017F>ary, he will be touched in the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible part of his
<U+017F>oul, and if he weeps not <U+017F>ometimes for joy, and <U+017F>ometimes for grief, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the occa<U+017F>ion, I will confe<U+017F>s the envious and detractive have gained
the cau<U+017F>e. I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay as much for the Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Argenis,</hi> which can be di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ant
to none but men without rea<U+017F>on. <hi>Clarimond</hi> unju<U+017F>tly blames the
Author for having <U+017F>aid in what condition the affairs of the world were when
a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el arrived in <hi>Sicily;</hi> for that does not relate only to the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, and
that the que<U+017F>tion is not about that alone, but all the other things that are in
the body of the book which concern the affairs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Gaules, Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
Mauritania,</hi> and divers other Countries, <U+017F>o that here's no inequality;
nor any mixture of great things and little together. As for the Ver<U+017F>es which
are di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed here and there, <U+017F>ince they are mo<U+017F>t excellent, mo<U+017F>t unju<U+017F>t <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond,</hi>
will you find fault with him that gave them us, for to divert our
minds after they have been long employed in <U+017F>omething more <U+017F>erious? You
do well to tell us that the true cu<U+017F>tomes of <hi>Sicily</hi> are not ob<U+017F>erved in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tory,
every one confe<U+017F><U+017F>es it as well as your <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince it was only the Authors
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43725:194"/>
de<U+017F>ign, to repre<U+017F>ent divers accidents hapned in <hi>France.</hi> If you e<U+017F>teem not
his intention becau<U+017F>e he treats of the<U+017F>e things with <U+017F>ome ob<U+017F>curity, <U+017F>hould
you not con<U+017F>ider that he was obliged to carry him<U+017F>elf with that caution, it
being a thing not a little dangerous to <U+017F>peak openly of the affairs of great
ones? As for the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of State which are <U+017F>o <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably introduced,
'tis a black malice to blame a thing <U+017F>o noble. As for the interview of <hi>Poliar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
and <hi>Archombrotus,</hi> tis credible they <U+017F>poke not but by tho<U+017F>e furious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which <hi>Barclay</hi> de<U+017F>cribes, and that <hi>Hyanisbe</hi> pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>eparated them.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> keeps al<U+017F>o a <U+017F>tirr with the language of this book; he thinks there
are <U+017F>ome new words; but if he ob<U+017F>erve it narrowly, there are none which
are not derived of other <hi>Latine</hi> words which are roots that may <U+017F>till <U+017F>end
forth <U+017F>omewhat. He is no le<U+017F>s inju<U+017F>t when he <U+017F>peaks again<U+017F>t <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander,</hi> He
hath made long narrations of the divers <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>es of the whole Hi<U+017F>tory,
to prove they are but <hi>rencontres;</hi> but what would he have had more miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in a Hi<U+017F>tory of our time? We have no more to do with tho<U+017F>e ancient
ceremonies, and triumphs with all their <U+017F>umptuous preparations. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
de<U+017F>cribe Wars or <U+017F>trange Combats, but we mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hood.
We are now reduced to <U+017F>peak only of ordinary things. <hi>Clarimond</hi>
mi<U+017F>likes al<U+017F>o that <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> <U+017F>hould be a<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>inated by the friends of <hi>Cloridan,</hi>
who had no hand in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, as he afterwards declared to the King. Is
it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible they <U+017F>hould bear him <U+017F>o much affection as to have engaged in
<U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>ign for his <U+017F>ake; and may it not be pre<U+017F>umed on the other <U+017F>ide that
he had intelligence of it, but that he denied it to pre<U+017F>erve the favour of his
Prince? The Challenge he afterwards <U+017F>ent to <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander,</hi> <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>covers
his indignation; and this ju<U+017F>tifies <hi>d' Audiguier,</hi> whom, <hi>Clarimond</hi> taxes not to
know whom to make this Gentleman fight with, <U+017F>ince <hi>Cloridan</hi> had a fair oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
to challenge him, having been wounded by him in <U+017F>ight of all the
Court. As for the <hi>Tale of the <U+017F>pirit,</hi> I will not maintain it to be true; it's
a query for a <hi>Divine,</hi> to know whether the <U+017F>ouls departed can return hither; it
<U+017F>uffices I <U+017F>hould tel you that <hi>d' Audiguier</hi> making a Romance according to our
mode could not adorn it better, then by putting in it <U+017F>uch things as the<U+017F>e, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of the apparitions of the heatheni<U+017F>h Gods, as you have them in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Romances;</hi> nor indeed is it alwaies nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to bring in true things into
Hi<U+017F>tories of this kind, but <U+017F>uch as <hi>the many</hi> take to be true: Now there is
nothing more certain then that there are many believe that <U+017F>pirits may be
<U+017F>poken to, and have been <U+017F>een <U+017F>ometimes. <hi>Clarimond</hi> does al<U+017F>o think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<hi>Lidian</hi> <U+017F>hould preach, as if he knew the accompli<U+017F>hments of that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
He would not have <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta</hi> bear arms, as being too <U+017F>oft, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing of the art of War; but doth not <hi>d' Audiguier</hi> make this thing
ea<U+017F>ily credible, <U+017F>ince he <U+017F>aies <U+017F>he would not fight but purpo<U+017F>ly to die? As for
<hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Erifila,</hi> they had a long time exerci<U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves in feats of
arms; nor was it <U+017F>uch a miracle to <U+017F>ee people armed about <hi>Paris,</hi> <U+017F>ince the
Author feigns that <hi>Tournaments</hi> were very frequent. What he hath in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence
to this, relates much to the warlike humour of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi>
and though there was no <U+017F>uch thing, yet it was enough to <U+017F>hew it might be.
The admirable adventure of the Nymph is no more to be cen<U+017F>ured then the
re<U+017F>t; for you find in modern Hi<U+017F>tories, that Magitians of the<U+017F>e times have
done the like. As for the faults of the language, if a point be forgotten, the
Author paies not the Printers <U+017F>core; and if there be in <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> any <hi>Ga<U+017F>con</hi>
phra<U+017F>es, there needs good eyes to find them. To be <U+017F>hort, <hi>Clarimond</hi> is like
that malicious Painter, who repre<U+017F>ented the feet of the Peacock, and not his
train. He mentions only what he likes not, but tho<U+017F>e things he could not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve,
he meddles not with. Why does he not con<U+017F>ider tho<U+017F>e duels which
are <U+017F>o well de<U+017F>cribed? Why does he not take notice of tho<U+017F>e ingenious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wers
of <hi>Claranges</hi> to him that repre<U+017F>ented to him the grandeurs of the world,
to make him quit his <hi>Capuchin</hi>'s Cell? Hath he not ob<U+017F>erved how <hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi>
                           <pb n="77" facs="tcp:43725:195"/>
upon a di<U+017F>dainfull humour of <hi>Cali<U+017F>ta,</hi> fell off from his marriage when all
their friends had con<U+017F>ented to it. In the<U+017F>e and other places there are di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es
<U+017F>o charming, that though the Reader de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee the end of the
Book, yet would he wi<U+017F>h withall it <U+017F>hould not end at all. For the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of <hi>Polyxena,</hi> though there be nothing but relations, yet are they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant.
Since the principal end of <hi>Romances</hi> is to <hi>delight,</hi> 'tis requi<U+017F>ite there
<U+017F>hould be of all <U+017F>orts. And as to Romances in general, <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath <U+017F>aid
nothing but what he had <U+017F>aid divers times before. He imagins that all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<U+017F>teal one from another, nay he hath been <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>t as to <U+017F>ay that there
are few adventures in the <hi>Argenis</hi> which are not as common in other Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but he does not con<U+017F>ider aright. If there be a war in a book, or the
ravi<U+017F>hing of a maid, or the death of a King, and that in another there be
the <U+017F>ame accidents, does that make the books alike? it cannot be, for upon
that account, the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<U+017F>tory were no other thing then the <hi>Greek,</hi> becau<U+017F>e
in both there are wars, ravi<U+017F>hings of maids, and deaths of Princes, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tances
make difference enough between things. Wars are begun upon
divers occa<U+017F>ions; maids may be ravi<U+017F>hed divers waies, and Princes are not
<U+017F>ubject to one only kind of death, <U+017F>o that you <U+017F>till find variety in our books;
and if you are not <U+017F>atisfied with them, you may in vain wi<U+017F>h that God would
create another world, or another nature; for as long as we <U+017F>hall be what we
are, our Hi<U+017F>tories can never con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of any thing but <U+017F>uits of Law, Wars,
Death and Marriage. If my adver<U+017F>ary take it ill that in a Romance a man
relate a Hi<U+017F>tory in the <U+017F>ame words as another hath related it to him, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iders
not that it is the principal grace of a book, and that if he can make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, 'tis for want of attention. It's ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>een he knows not what to
<U+017F>ay again<U+017F>t us, and that he can do nothing but follow the imaginations of his
own corrupt humours, <U+017F>ince that in the conclu<U+017F>ion of all, he could reproach
us with nothing but the complaints which are lowdly made again<U+017F>t us, which
is a thing no le<U+017F>s natural then that there <U+017F>hould be diver<U+017F>ity of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. I
therefore conjure you, mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t Judge, not to regard his <U+017F>eeble rea<U+017F>ons,
whereby he endeavours to make it appear to us, that the be<U+017F>t <hi>Romances</hi> in
the world are worth nothing. It is mo<U+017F>t certain, that being made only for
<hi>plea<U+017F>ure,</hi> and not ob<U+017F>erving the rigorous laws of Hi<U+017F>tory, there may be
brought whatever the Author plea<U+017F>es, <U+017F>o that they pre<U+017F>ent us with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of <hi>Vertue</hi> that can be imagined. 'Tis in the<U+017F>e we find plea<U+017F>ure and
profit together, and where even women may learn Civility and Court<U+017F>hip.
The<U+017F>e things being true, and that it is granted there was never any man hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
but <hi>Clarimond</hi> that doubted of them, I be<U+017F>eech you to pre<U+017F>erve <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi>
in that reputation which they have gotten in the world, and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially
to confirm unto tho<U+017F>e I have named, the honour and re<U+017F>pect they
de<U+017F>erve.</p>

talking about tho<U+017F>e things that <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Philiris</hi> had
<U+017F>aid, and their admiration of <hi>Philiris</hi> was not little; he
without any notice given him to an<U+017F>wer to what was then

had an<U+017F>wered in order to all the rea<U+017F>ons of <hi>Clarimond,</hi> with
very little he<U+017F>itation. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elf for joy; and though the Poer
<hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan</hi> had not <U+017F>o much wit as to judge of wit in others, yet he thought be<U+017F>t
to follow the Propo<U+017F>itions of him that had <U+017F>poken for <hi>Romances.</hi> As for the re<U+017F>t,
they were, as I told you, of different opinions; but he that was mo<U+017F>t for <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
was <hi>Adrian,</hi> who taking his opportunity to <U+017F>peak; <U+017F>aid to him, <hi>Sir, you
have done wonders in your <U+017F>peech, methinks your adver<U+017F>ary made not <U+017F>o good a plea as
you, and therefore I am very <U+017F>orry you have not received that <U+017F>atisfaction you de<U+017F>ired:
For my part, I have ever born a great hatred to the<U+017F>e ridiculous</hi> Romances. There

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43725:197"/>
he did it only to exerci<U+017F>e his wit, and that his heart hath ever thought contrary to
what his tongue hath <U+017F>poken. 'Tis the <U+017F>ame ca<U+017F>e as that of your Coun<U+017F>ellors, who
to get money or reputation, entertain and maintain all the cau<U+017F>es that come to

again<U+017F>t mine; but to what purpo<U+017F>e are they, <U+017F>ince they only <U+017F>hew the <U+017F>ubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his wit, and not the innocency of tho<U+017F>e he hath vindicated? They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
had never con<U+017F>ider'd of maintaining their works by any <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>iderations
as his: for if they had had any <U+017F>uch, they would not have done their reputation
that injury as to have conceal'd them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having over-heard this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, turns to <hi>Clarimond;</hi> Do<U+017F>t thou think
thou <U+017F>peake<U+017F>t truth in this? <U+017F>aies he to him; for my part I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, that though
thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>poken again<U+017F>t what I lov'd, yet had I a greater e<U+017F>teem of thy eloquence

you notwith<U+017F>tanding all this, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that you will finde <hi>Philiris</hi> anon
of another opinion then what he held. That will be a <U+017F>trange blow indeed, <U+017F>aies
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> with a <U+017F>mile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> by chance ob<U+017F>erving <hi>Li<U+017F>etta</hi> near him, who was come to whi<U+017F>per <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

<U+017F>aid to <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> that their loves <U+017F>hould not be drawn out any further,

for her, that <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf very happy to be married to <hi>Carmelin;</hi> but
the que<U+017F>tion was, whether he had means enough to maintain her. He hath ever
told me he was nothing in debt, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> and therefore I think him rich.
What's more, he's willing enough to work, and by that means he may in time come
to have a good flock of <U+017F>heep: As for his vertues, I pa<U+017F>s my word for him; and
if you will clap up an agreement, <hi>Love</hi> <U+017F>hall be the <hi>Notary,</hi> and <U+017F>hall draw up the
contract, and keep the copies of it. <hi>Amaryllis</hi> told him it were better to delay it
a little, that the two Lovers might try whether their conditions were <U+017F>uch as would
agree together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> upon this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, went a<U+017F>ide to <U+017F>peak with <hi>Hircan,</hi> who was gone
into a <U+017F>tudy at the end of the Hall, and all the counterfeit Shepherds with him.
Dear friends, <U+017F>aid he to them, we have taken our plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>ufficiently of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi>
His follies would henceforth be rather trouble<U+017F>ome to us then delightful, if we
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer him to continue in them; be<U+017F>ides, it is <U+017F>ome touch to con<U+017F>cience, to
entertain a man <U+017F>till in tho<U+017F>e extravagances, which are repugnant to rea<U+017F>on. You
are a great Orator, replies <hi>Meliantes,</hi> you would teach us the precepts of charity,
which we know as well as your <U+017F>elf. Why may we not yet a while enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant
conver<U+017F>ation of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is?</hi> If he were po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with any hurtful folly, you had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
to be <U+017F>o ready to re<U+017F>tore him. His imaginations never carried him to do mi<U+017F>chief
to any man. If he does not hurt, 'tis certain he does no good, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond;</hi>
and wheaeas his minde is capable of great things, if it were well guided; he is
now in <U+017F>uch a decay of <U+017F>pirits, that if he go on a while longer, it may be de<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to re<U+017F>tore him. If you do not con<U+017F>ider this, repre<U+017F>ent to your <U+017F>elves, that if
you were re<U+017F>olved to make further <U+017F>port with this poor Shepherd, you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it much longer, for <hi>Adrian</hi> or <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> will carry him away to <hi>Paris.</hi> 'Tis
there we would have him, replies <hi>Meliantes;</hi> 'twill be good <U+017F>port to govern him
in great companies. 'Twere a pitty <U+017F>o famous a place <U+017F>hould want this recreation.
That will never be, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> for a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he were there, they would chain
him up, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould run up and down the <U+017F>treets and di<U+017F>grace his friends. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
him now upon his departure, and learn in time to quit that <U+017F>atisfaction you
mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome time be depriv'd of. Con<U+017F>ider that there will be no le<U+017F>s plea<U+017F>ure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tore
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to his wits, then there would be to continue him in his madne<U+017F>s as you
de<U+017F>ire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hircan</hi> was of the <U+017F>ame opinion, and <hi>Philiris</hi> too, <U+017F>o that they <U+017F>oon brought
their companions to the <U+017F>ame point. They then thought it a very good work to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tore
their Shepherd to him<U+017F>elf again; and the hopes they had to do it were not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43725:198"/>
<U+017F>mall, when they repre<U+017F>ented to them<U+017F>elves, that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had good natural faculties,
which he could not but di<U+017F>cover in his greate<U+017F>t extravagances. His di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es and
his inventions amaz'd all the world; and if his errors had not hindred him from
employing his <U+017F>ubtilty in good things, he had never done any thing di<U+017F>commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>While they were in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, a <U+017F>erving man came and told <hi>Hircan</hi> that the
<hi>Hermit</hi> was at the door for an alms. They call'd him by no other name, becau<U+017F>e
there was no other Hermit thereabouts, and it was the <U+017F>ame that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
<U+017F>ome time before. <hi>Hircan</hi> having given order he <U+017F>hould come up, the Shepherd
pre<U+017F>ently call'd him to minde, and went and <U+017F>aluted him with a great deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement.
I am very glad my Cou<U+017F>in is acquainted with you, <U+017F>aies <hi>Adrian</hi> to the
Hermit, I <U+017F>hould heartily wi<U+017F>h you would make him walk in the way of vertue. I
doubt not but he is very well given thereto, replies the Hermit; he was almo<U+017F>t
per<U+017F>waded to enter into that contemplative way of life that I follow; but I believe
all the hurt that's in him, is that he is <U+017F>till in love. I am <U+017F>o, and <U+017F>hall be eternally
(<U+017F>aies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> in a loud Tone) <hi>Charite</hi> is <U+017F>he that I love; my Cou<U+017F>in hath <U+017F>een her,
all the Shepherds know her, the Birds, the Trees, the Rocks and the Fountains
are not ignorant who <U+017F>he is; for when I complain of my mi<U+017F>ery, every thing, even
to that which hath no <U+017F>oul, a<U+017F><U+017F>umes one to hearken to me. Provided your love
aims not but at a faithful marriage, <U+017F>aies the Hermit, I <U+017F>hall never be among tho<U+017F>e
that will blame you; for marriage was in<U+017F>tituted by our Saviour, who after the
creation of the world, be<U+017F>tow'd <hi>Eve</hi> on <hi>Adam;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> <U+017F>aies, <hi>It is better
to marry then to burn;</hi> but away with <U+017F>inful concupi<U+017F>cence, if <U+017F>o be your <U+017F>oul be
<U+017F>tain'd with it. The waters of the cleare<U+017F>t <U+017F>prings are not more pure then my de<U+017F>ires,
replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> I know incontinence de<U+017F>troys both mens bodies, and their mindes,
and that it is like tho<U+017F>e fruits that grow about the Lake <hi>A<U+017F>phalt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes,</hi> which <U+017F>eem fair
and ripe, but within are nothing but a<U+017F>hes. Ever from my infancy, I have known
what belong'd to the two ways which pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves to the great <hi>Alcides;</hi>
and two women made their orations to me, as they did to him, but I follow'd her
that led me into the rough way of vertue, though the other would have led me an
ea<U+017F>ier way. I now go upon thorns, whereas others tread upon ro<U+017F>es; but I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o
<U+017F>ure to come to that eternal glory which <U+017F>o many Heroes have <U+017F>ought after. 'Tis
for that we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>wear, 'tis for that we mu<U+017F>t go naked, having nothing but a club
to overcome mon<U+017F>ters, the enemies of mankinde: And 'tis for that in brief, that
we mu<U+017F>t for<U+017F>ake the plea<U+017F>ures of this life, and live upon earth, as if we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
of the other world; that is to <U+017F>ay, have no other entertainment for the mo<U+017F>t
part then good meditations.</p>
            <p>The Hermit was extreamly pleas'd at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, for he interpreted all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly,
and imagin'd that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>poke of the glory of Paradice, and that he would
quell the Mon<U+017F>ters which are our enemies; that is to <U+017F>ay the Devils. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
turning to <hi>Adrian,</hi> <U+017F>aid to him, Do you not <U+017F>ee your own happine<U+017F>s in <U+017F>o

he does. What reputation would he in time come to, <U+017F>hould he enter into that
calling! I <U+017F>hould be very glad would he give him<U+017F>elf thereto, replies <hi>Adrian;</hi> if
you had heard other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of his, you would have been amaz'd. He will <U+017F>peak
to you three hours together, without any trouble, and I know not whence he
hath what he <U+017F>aies: for the mo<U+017F>t part he is <U+017F>o deeply learned, that I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
one half. It mu<U+017F>t be conceiv'd he hath done nothing all his life time but
read. And it hath <U+017F>o happen'd, he hath taken a man, who is almo<U+017F>t as great a
Schollar as him<U+017F>elf. But I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that I think all their knowledge is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
or rather hurtful to them; for they employ it only in tho<U+017F>e things
which I can by no means approve. Is this true? <U+017F>aies the Hermit to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> do
you abu<U+017F>e the good gifts which God hath be<U+017F>tow'd on you? My friend, will you
not ob<U+017F>erve all the articles of our faith? I ob<U+017F>erve my faith to <hi>Charite,</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;

               <hi>Hircan</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the Gentlemen came in at this noi<U+017F>e. <hi>Clarimond</hi> having
under<U+017F>tood the controver<U+017F>ie, perceiv'd the Hermite was not able enough to convert
the Shepherd. As for his own part, he thought now was the time to try whether
he might be more fortunate then another in the de<U+017F>ign he had to re<U+017F>tore him to his
<U+017F>en<U+017F>es, by the help of tho<U+017F>e artifices which he had re<U+017F>olved to make u<U+017F>e of. There are
a many things which I mu<U+017F>t communicate to you before this honorable a<U+017F><U+017F>embly,
<U+017F>ays he to him. 'Tis now that I am to <U+017F>hew you that I am really your friend, as I
told you <U+017F>ome dayes <U+017F>ince: 'Tis <hi>Philiris</hi> and his companions that are your enemies,
though you have ever thought the contrary; they have hitherto promoted your
humours, and 'tis that hath put you into the way of de<U+017F>truction. Since your coming
to years of di<U+017F>cretion you have read a many fabulous books, which you have taken
as true, for want of being acquainted with <U+017F>ome one that could di<U+017F>creetly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
you of your erroneous opinions. I mu<U+017F>t not any longer conceal my thoughts
as I have heretofore, which I did only by degrees to in<U+017F>inuate into your good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that I might be permitted one day to <U+017F>peak freely to you. You have ju<U+017F>t now
di<U+017F>cover'd the greate<U+017F>t extravagance in the world; you have <U+017F>poken of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
as of <U+017F>omwhat divine, though you cannot but know <U+017F>he is a mortal creature
that eats and drinks as any of us do. You <U+017F>aid you had no faith but for her; have
you quite forgotten the faith of your Fathers, and turn'd Idolater?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing he was <U+017F>et upon more vehemently as to this point then ever he had
been before, was not <U+017F>o extravagant, but he call'd to mind the good precepts had
been infus'd into him in his infancie; <U+017F>o that at this very fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ault of <hi>Clarimonds</hi>
he was almo<U+017F>t chang'd into another man. He was therefore forc'd to an<U+017F>wer, that
he acknowledged no other God then him that had created heaven and earth, and
that he had ever ador'd him in the <U+017F>ame manner as his father had taught him. As
for <hi>Charite</hi> to whom he gave divine attributes, it was only to accommodate him<U+017F>elf
to the <U+017F>tile of the <hi>Poets,</hi> whom he was re<U+017F>olved to imitate. This is not all you have
done, there's much more, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond,</hi> you have ever talk'd of an infinity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Gods, as if there were really any <U+017F>uch; and yet who<U+017F>oever adores this great
God who hath given us our beings, looks upon all tho<U+017F>e little Gods as having no
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence but in fables, which men feign'd while they were yet in their fir<U+017F>t errors.
Have you not told us a hundred times, that there was a <hi>Diana</hi> in the woods with
her <hi>Nymphs,</hi> that there are <hi>Hamadryads</hi> and Gods of the River, and Nymphs of
Fountains? You have endeavoured to make all tho<U+017F>e believe it that you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ed
with, or came neer you; and you once ca<U+017F>t your<U+017F>elf into the water to go and
vi<U+017F>it the <hi>aquatick</hi> Divinities. <hi>I</hi> know not whether your fellow-Shepherds were <U+017F>uch
fools as to believe there were any in the world. It need not <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange that <hi>I</hi>
believe there are <U+017F>uch Divinities, replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is: I</hi> have not only read it in Books
which have been made by <hi>Pagans,</hi> but in <U+017F>uch as have been made by <hi>Chri<U+017F>tians</hi> who
are alive at this day. What you <U+017F>ay may be true, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> but tho<U+017F>e Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have writ that only as a fable; and if you doubt of it, be judg'd by <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan.</hi>
This Poet was <U+017F>till in the place; <U+017F>o that he confe<U+017F>s'd that it was not to be que<U+017F>tion'd
but that him<U+017F>elf and all tho<U+017F>e that wrote books <U+017F>poke of tho<U+017F>e ancient Divinities as
a thing fained, only for the ornament of their Poe<U+017F>ies, though it had <U+017F>ometime been
a main truth, and believ'd, and that very pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, by a many nations. You <U+017F>ee
what they think of it whom you have ever followed, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> <U+017F>ince you will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43725:199"/>
needs embrace their doctrine, you mu<U+017F>t believe what they <U+017F>ay, and you are not more
learned then your ma<U+017F>ters in the lectures they read to you. You are moreover to
con<U+017F>ider, that <U+017F>ince there is but one Almighty God, all your little Gods cannot
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>Since you will have me follow the dictate of rea<U+017F>on with you, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> I will
declare one thing to you, which I would not communicate to any other per<U+017F>on
what<U+017F>oever; and that is, that I know very well that they are not really <hi>Divinities</hi>
which are conceived to be in the fields, but they are <U+017F>o called in a certain manner
of <U+017F>peaking; They are only <hi>Spirits</hi> under divers forms. And to make it appear to
you that it is <U+017F>o, I have not only read in the <hi>Poets</hi> whom you tax with <hi>lying,</hi> but
al<U+017F>o in Authors that pretend to be <hi>Philo<U+017F>ophers,</hi> and <U+017F>uch as I dare <U+017F>ay would be
<hi>Divines.</hi> Witne<U+017F>s <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his <hi>Occult Philo<U+017F>ophy:</hi> 'Tis well known he <U+017F>peaks
every where as a good Chri<U+017F>tian, and quotes pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the holy Scripture; but yet
having di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed his Spirits through all the Elements, when he comes to tho<U+017F>e he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
for the Earth and the Water, he calls them by all tho<U+017F>e divers names we
find in the Poets: He grants there are <hi>Fawns, Dryads</hi> and <hi>Hamadryads</hi> in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>ts,
and <hi>Nayads</hi> in the Fountains; nay he denies not but <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and the
other Gods are each of them in his <U+017F>everal heaven, exerci<U+017F>ing that power which the
Ancients attributed to them. He al<U+017F>o tels you at large what names to call them by,
and in what manner they are to be invocated in his operations. Now we never u<U+017F>e
invocation towards things that have no power. As for his part, he calls them the
Governours of the World: but it is my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s only to tell you, that his meaning
was, that they are Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> then it <U+017F>eems is one of your Authors, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Clarimond:</hi> you have been
extremely re<U+017F>erv'd, that we never knew you <U+017F>tudied his doctrine before. Know then
that it is as impertinent a Fellow as ever you met with; he mingles Divinity with
fables: And though he hath a mind to dre<U+017F>s up a <hi>Chri<U+017F>tian</hi> and <hi>lawfull</hi> Magick,
yet he makes u<U+017F>e of that of <hi>Hermes</hi> and other prophane Authors. Becau<U+017F>e that in the
magick of the Ancients the Planets were invocated, as al<U+017F>o the re<U+017F>t of the inferior Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities,
he hath <U+017F>poken in the <U+017F>ame manner, as if it could be done <U+017F>till: But the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urdity
was <U+017F>o great, that he hath entreated all the world to pardon him, excu<U+017F>ing
it as an error of his youth. This I find in his book of the <hi>Vanity of the Sciences:</hi>
there he retracts all. <hi>Clarimond</hi> is in the right, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Philiris,</hi> there's no an<U+017F>wer to
be made to what he hath <U+017F>aid. But though <hi>Agrippa</hi> <U+017F>hould not believe there were
<hi>Dryads</hi> and <hi>Nayads,</hi> <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> it follows not I <U+017F>hould be of his opinion: Do I not
remember that I have <U+017F>een <U+017F>o many rural Divinities, when I was chang'd into a
Tree? There was never any <U+017F>uch thing, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and I tell you once more,
that there was never in this world any body <U+017F>o changed. Do you not remember
the rea<U+017F>ons I alleadg'd once again<U+017F>t <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es?</hi> I told you there was none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the heathens but the <U+017F>imple people, that believed any <U+017F>uch thing could be;
be<U+017F>ides that it was by accident that the<U+017F>e opinions got any credit among them. I
gave you an account of divers per<U+017F>ons who were thought to have chang'd forms,
and more particularly that of the Robber, who was thought to be chang'd into a
Raven. I told you the Poets had brought tho<U+017F>e things into reputation by their
Ver<U+017F>es; and if I am not deceiv'd, <hi>Philiris, Fontenay,</hi> and <hi>Carmelin</hi> him<U+017F>elf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
my rea<U+017F>ons: I know not whether they have been <U+017F>ince poi<U+017F>oned by your
errors.</p>
            <p>I remember all this, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> but I value it not. We remember it very well,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Fontenay,</hi> but we found a great deal of truth in it. You then believe impo<U+017F>tures,
replies the Shepherd all in a heat. This is not the only point you will be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
in, <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> be not angry yet, <U+017F>tay a while, and you <U+017F>hall have much
more rea<U+017F>on. I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that <U+017F>ince all the<U+017F>e Divinities you have talk'd of are
but fictions, you had no rea<U+017F>on to make all the<U+017F>e Gentlemen put on Shepherds
habit, making them believe that you would make them happy by that means, and
bring them into conver<U+017F>ation with the immortals. As for your <hi>golden age,</hi> you know
what I <U+017F>aid to you of it; I told you plainly, that to make that return, we mu<U+017F>t put
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43725:199"/>
on as much <U+017F>avagene<U+017F>s as tho<U+017F>e of the new found world. There was never any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
that that kinde of life could be as delightful as ours.</p>
            <p>What hath <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> then deceiv'd us? cries out <hi>Philiris;</hi> I had little rea<U+017F>on to come
<U+017F>o far to finde him. If he knows no more then I have yet <U+017F>een, the Shepherds of our
Country know as much, I will return to them. And <U+017F>hall I, <U+017F>aies <hi>Fontenay,</hi> <U+017F>tay
here with an Impo<U+017F>tor, who hath promis'd me <U+017F>uch wonders if I would continue
Shepherd? O! Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Hircan,</hi> give me my red <U+017F>uit again. <hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes</hi>
<U+017F>aid al<U+017F>o, they would be no longer Shepherds; <U+017F>o that <hi>Hircan</hi> de<U+017F>ired them to be
quiet, and told them they <U+017F>hould all have what cloathes they had brought to his
hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> extreamly troubled at this revolt, told them they would at lei<U+017F>ure
repent their for<U+017F>aking him: but <hi>Clarimond</hi> bid him not to be <U+017F>o per<U+017F>waded, and
told him he would make it appear to him, that he had never known the lea<U+017F>t hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F>s
of condition, <U+017F>ince he turned Shepherd, and that of all he had believed,
there had nothing happened to him; and to that purpo<U+017F>e he thus continued the
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>You are then to imagine, that I am better acquainted with your adventures then
your <U+017F>elf, for I have not only learn'd what you thought of them, but al<U+017F>o what
others conceiv'd who have abus'd you.</p>
            <p>In the fir<U+017F>t place, being come to St. <hi>Clou,</hi> where you put on your Pa<U+017F>toral habit,
<hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> having found you, as you admir'd your precious reliques, was <U+017F>o far from
blaming you for it, that he hearkned attentively to your extravagant hi<U+017F>tory; but
what amazement mu<U+017F>t he have been in, to <U+017F>ee you e<U+017F>teem <U+017F>o highly the foule<U+017F>t things
in the world; and having promis'd you great a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, <U+017F>uch as was that of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Charite's</hi> picture, you took him for the God <hi>Pan.</hi> The Poets never told you
that the <hi>Sylvane</hi> God pretended to any skill in painting, but you thought there
could be nothing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to a god. I will not mention the rea<U+017F>ons you alledg'd
to your Gardian, to per<U+017F>wade him that you ought to be a Shepherd, and that he
<U+017F>hould be one too, if he had any de<U+017F>ign to be happy. There hath been laughing
enough at that impertinence already; I <U+017F>hall only mention that <U+017F>implicity of yours
to go and <U+017F>peak to a country Lobcock in <hi>Poetical</hi> and <hi>Romantick</hi> terms. The powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
you attributed to <hi>Charite,</hi> put him into <U+017F>uch a fright, that he and all his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
were alarm'd all that night, imagining the end of the world to be at hand;
I know not whether any dyed upon that fright. If any <U+017F>uch thing had happened,
you had been the cau<U+017F>e of their death, and you would have been puni<U+017F>h'd as a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer.
You would al<U+017F>o needs interrogate the <hi>Eccho,</hi> but you were neatly cheated;
for whereas you imagin'd it was the Eccho of the Poets that had an<U+017F>wered you, it
was this <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> whom you <U+017F>ee, who cannot deny it. You might have perceiv'd
then, how much he <U+017F>lighted and laught at the extravagances of the Poets, by the
<U+017F>tories he told you about that repetition of the voyce, and concerning the three
De<U+017F>tinies. He al<U+017F>o laugh'd at that opinion of yours about the Sun, taking what is
<U+017F>aid of it litterally. You are to know, there is but one, and if we finde it in the
morning in another quarter, though he hath been hidden from us, yet it did only
pa<U+017F>s under us, to enlighten the other Hemi<U+017F>phere, and did not re<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>ea, as
your impertinent Authors tell you. Yet <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> comply'd with you <U+017F>o far, as to
make you another promi<U+017F>e of <hi>Charites</hi> picture. I pa<U+017F>s by your extravagance in
the Inn, of not eating ought but what was red. This you would needs do, and
your humor was <U+017F>atisfied. You perceived well enough that you had already deceiv'd
your <U+017F>elf, when <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> told you that it was not hand<U+017F>ome to play the <hi>Shepherd</hi> at
St. <hi>Clou,</hi> and it was a great argument he told you the truth, when <U+017F>uch a rout bore
you company with <U+017F>tones. You were al<U+017F>o pittifully abus'd when you took a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
fellow for a <hi>Satyre;</hi> for who hath ever <U+017F>een any in <hi>France,</hi> unle<U+017F>s it be in
picture, or only by di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e in Pa<U+017F>torals and Masks? Nay, where were there ever
any <U+017F>een in the world; There's mention only of two or three, but they were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters,
things extraordinary in nature. As for the picture which <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> gave you,
do you not <U+017F>ee he did it only to abu<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>criptions of beauty which are in the
Poets? Do you think your <U+017F>elf that the features of that <hi>Metaphorical</hi> face are like
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43725:200"/>
tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Natural</hi> face of your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s? Though that were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, amid<U+017F>t <U+017F>o
many <U+017F>everal colours, 'tis not <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> hath done it, for he is not <U+017F>o good a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as that there can any excellent things come from him, he can only <U+017F>hadow
Copper-pieces. I <U+017F>tick not to <U+017F>ay this before him, becau<U+017F>e his reputation lies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. 'Twas al<U+017F>o out of abu<U+017F>e, that he permitted you to be Judge in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between him and <hi>Montenor;</hi> and though you had not given judgement on
his <U+017F>ide, <hi>Geneura</hi> had neverthele<U+017F>s been fru<U+017F>tated of her expectation. He <U+017F>eem'd
to attribute great authority to your words: your <hi>Serenade</hi> and your Love-letters
were in his opinion ridiculous enough, but you abus'd your <U+017F>elf more egregiou<U+017F>ly,
when you ki<U+017F>s'd the clapper of <hi>Leonora's</hi> door, while you perceiv'd not you were
<U+017F>prinkled with Urine in<U+017F>tead of Ro<U+017F>e-water. I omit many little particulars, as the
Garlands wherewith you would adorn the portalls of <hi>Charites</hi> pallace, and the
meeting with the Merchants of <hi>Paris,</hi> whom you took for <hi>Pirates.</hi> In all the<U+017F>e
were you as <U+017F>trangely deluded as could be imagin'd. When you were one evening at
<hi>Charite's,</hi> 'twas plea<U+017F>antly imagin'd of you that the candle could have been lighted
at her eyes: If the Poets finde out <U+017F>o many conceptions upon the flames which
i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out of their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es eyes, they mu<U+017F>t be e<U+017F>teem'd no other then Poetical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences.
I cannot but laugh at your extravagant jealou<U+017F>ie the day following,
when you found <hi>Charite</hi> a<U+017F>leep in the garden. You were jealous of your own <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
nay of the very Atoms, and therefore with much more rea<U+017F>on of any thing
that touch'd her, as the gra<U+017F>s whereon <U+017F>he lay. You imagin'd the Sun made a noi<U+017F>e,
as he went through the heaven, and that the plants did the like in growing: You af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
committed a world of fooleries, and the perfection of your extravagance
was, that being near <hi>Charite</hi> in the Court, you believed the fire of her eyes had
burnt your hat, when it was one of <hi>An<U+017F>elmes</hi> Lacqueys had done it with a Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-gla<U+017F>s:
In con<U+017F>equence of this opinion, you imagin'd the next day that you were
all afire, and went and ca<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elf into a fountain, where you had been drown'd
had not <U+017F>udden relief come. Being after this at <hi>Paris,</hi> you went to <hi>Burgundy-hou<U+017F>e,</hi>
where you took the <hi>Comedy</hi> for a <hi>truth,</hi> making better <U+017F>port to all the world then
any play. 'Twas another good humor of yours, when you believed that the picture
of an imaginary Shepherd was your own, and when you a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd the Stationer
in St. <hi>James</hi> <U+017F>treet with your words and actions. The di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e you held with <hi>Cecilia</hi>
when you lay at her hou<U+017F>e were very plea<U+017F>ant, and 'twas pretty to <U+017F>ee you come
into this Country, when you thought you had gone into <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts.</hi> This cheat you
are convinc'd of, you can <U+017F>ay nothing to it. Here's <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> pre<U+017F>ent that can Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
it, and not only this, but all the re<U+017F>t, in ca<U+017F>e you will deny them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> upon this advanc'd, and very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly confirm'd all that <hi>Clarimond</hi>
had <U+017F>aid; whereat <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was <U+017F>o da<U+017F>h'd, that he <U+017F>uffered the other to proceed in his
reproaches.</p>
            <p>Do you not al<U+017F>o remember, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that I began to di<U+017F>cover you by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
error of yours at my hou<U+017F>e: You took my mother for the <U+017F>age <hi>Felicia;</hi> 'tis
true, <U+017F>he is <U+017F>age, but not <hi>Felicia.</hi> You were afterward mightily deceived, when you
thought I would have taken your part; and again, when you gave your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s a
<hi>Serenade,</hi> you thought it was an <hi>Hamadryad</hi> that an<U+017F>wered you on the Lute, for it
was our friend <hi>Hircan,</hi> whom I had given notice to of your enterpri<U+017F>e. The good
Hermit here pre<U+017F>ent can al<U+017F>o witne<U+017F>s, that you <U+017F>poke to him as if he had been a
<hi>Druid,</hi> or <U+017F>ome <hi>Magician,</hi> becau<U+017F>e you had read in your books, that the Hermites
did <U+017F>ometimes practi<U+017F>e Magick, and thought there was no <U+017F>in in it. The mo<U+017F>t match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
delu<U+017F>ion was, that when you afterwards met <hi>Hircan,</hi> you took him for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,
and thought the Gentlewoman whom you called <hi>Synopa</hi> a Nymph of the
waters. 'Twas as good a trick when you imagined that this cunning man, had
changed you <U+017F>o perfectly into a maid, that you were taken for no other. Being a <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
in that <U+017F>ex at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s, you were accu<U+017F>ed of incontinence; and for tryal, they
made you get up on a bra<U+017F>s plate, which could not hurt you, there being no fire
under; I came and proffered to dye for you; and when <hi>Leonora</hi> had commanded
you to be burnt, <hi>Hircan</hi> came and deliver'd you from the inju<U+017F>tice of your enemies;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43725:200"/>
but all this was but a Comedy, for it was <U+017F>o well known that you were <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> that
the very children knew it, and they had much ado to keep them from telling you
<U+017F>o. Being afterward come to my hou<U+017F>e with <hi>Carmelin,</hi> you did <U+017F>o many extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances
that my Mother was amaz'd at it; but I pa<U+017F>s by that, to come to your
<hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>is.</hi> Having fallen by chance into a hollow Willow, you imagin'd
you were become a tree, though none el<U+017F>e thought <U+017F>o. What confirm'd you in
this was, that <hi>Synopa</hi> came and vi<U+017F>ited you that night with two maids, who called
them<U+017F>elves <hi>Hamadryads:</hi> one of them is here yet. As for the God <hi>Morin,</hi> who
came after, it was <hi>Hircan,</hi> and <hi>Lucida</hi> was <hi>Amaryllis;</hi> and for the <hi>Cypre<U+017F>s-tree,</hi>
it was a <U+017F>erving-man. The fables which were related to you, were purpo<U+017F>ely made
to abu<U+017F>e you; and all the other particulars of that adventure were out of de<U+017F>ign.
The <U+017F>econd night <hi>An<U+017F>elme, Montenor</hi> and my <U+017F>elf clad our <U+017F>elves like Gods of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to come and vi<U+017F>it you; and that we <U+017F>poke not, was for fear we might be di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
When we had <U+017F>ufficiently made <U+017F>port with you and <hi>Carmelin, Hircan</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to you like a Magician. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and I acted the two winds which blew
down the Tree <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> who afterwards thought he was become a man again: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was no hard matter to per<U+017F>wade him to be one. If you will not credit this,
call to minde the fal<U+017F>e birds which you found in this hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome days <U+017F>ince, they
were the <U+017F>ame we had on when we acted the Gods of the Rivers, and for the re<U+017F>t
of our dre<U+017F><U+017F>ings, you <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>hewn them at any time. Since that, many things have
happened to you which were very remarkable; and above all, the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which
pa<U+017F>t between you and me concerning the Poets was very excellent, which had this
effect, that you <U+017F>ent a Bill to be po<U+017F>ted up in <hi>Paris.</hi> You receiv'd a <hi>Command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Command</hi> from your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and then you would needs be <U+017F>ick, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he
was. But that which is mo<U+017F>t admirable, is the abu<U+017F>e which <hi>Philiris, Polidor, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantes</hi>
and <hi>Fontenay</hi> put upon you. They made you believe they were turn'd Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
for your <U+017F>ake, and that indeed you may make good, but if they did it, 'twas
to make <U+017F>port with you. <hi>Philiris</hi> is no Shepherd by birth, <hi>Fontenay</hi> never had any
minde to that condition of life; and as for <hi>Polidor</hi> and <hi>Meliantes,</hi> they are <hi>Per<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ians</hi>
as much as I am: All the <U+017F>tories they have related to you, have been forg'd
out of their own brains. As for <hi>Lucida</hi> and <hi>Synopa,</hi> you were very credulous when
you <U+017F>aw them, to imagine they were both Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and not the Nymphs
you had <U+017F>een before. As for <hi>Synopa,</hi> <U+017F>he is return'd to her own hou<U+017F>e, and was
not; as you conceive, chang'd into a Rock: The Country people hereabouts will
tell you, that the rock which you would have <hi>Carmelin</hi> love, hath been time out
of minde in the <U+017F>ame place where you found it. The <hi>Hamadeyad</hi> you <U+017F>aw in the
day, was <hi>Li<U+017F>etta</hi> cover'd over with <hi>bark.</hi> As for the Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adors from <hi>Paris</hi> who
came to you, they had only put on the names: And as for the enchanted Ca<U+017F>tle,
whither you were carried in a Coach, 'twas a hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Hircans,</hi> which you may
<U+017F>ee when you plea<U+017F>e: we were the Gyants, and the hulch-back Souldiers, and you
were no more invulnerable then any other. You went not through the ayr, neither
coming nor going; for I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you that <hi>Hircan</hi> never pretended to be a Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
When you thought to have carried away <hi>Charite,</hi> you only laid hold of a
Bug-bear, which <hi>Orontes</hi>'s Maids had dre<U+017F>s'd on purpo<U+017F>e for you. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, you have not taken any poi<U+017F>on to make away your <U+017F>elf, and
con<U+017F>equently <hi>Charites</hi> eyes have not rais'd you to life again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having thus ended his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was on the point to render
him<U+017F>elf, and yet he made him this an<U+017F>wer. What, wilt thou then deprive me of the
glory of <U+017F>o many noble actions? Can it be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that <U+017F>o many hone<U+017F>t people
have deceiv'd me? <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> hath already confe<U+017F>s'd he hath done <U+017F>o, but may I
believe it for the re<U+017F>t? Though we came to take our leaves of you, as pretending
to return into the Country whence we came<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> replies <hi>Philiris,</hi> yet mu<U+017F>t we confe<U+017F>s
that it was to play the la<U+017F>t of our pranks with you. And for my part, <U+017F>ays <hi>Hircan,</hi>
I was never any Magician: I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you that all that <hi>Clarimond</hi> hath <U+017F>aid is true,
and I will give you what proofs of it you plea<U+017F>e to de<U+017F>ire; I will <U+017F>hew you all the
dre<U+017F><U+017F>es wherein we have been di<U+017F>guis'd to bring about the<U+017F>e notable adventures,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43725:201"/>
and will bring you all the Country hereabouts to tell you who I am, and who the<U+017F>e
Gentlemen are that have plaid the Shepherds.</p>
            <p>All that were pre<U+017F>ent having made <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> the like a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of the truth, and that
very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, he was <U+017F>o touch'd with grief and indignation to have been <U+017F>o long
deceived, that notwith<U+017F>tanding all his extravagance he fell a weeping, which with
an acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>hame made him run away into a chamber where there was nobody.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> having followed him thither, he cries out as <U+017F>oon as he perceiv'd him,
O God! with what impo<U+017F>tures hath my youth been abu<U+017F>ed? You would needs
make us believe you were a <hi>Tree,</hi> and many other <U+017F>uch things, <U+017F>ayes <hi>Clarimond;</hi>
we could do no le<U+017F>s then endeavour to abu<U+017F>e you too. You have no rea<U+017F>on to be
angry with any for deluding you, for we were all forc'd to it, <U+017F>ince you were the
fir<U+017F>t deceiv'd your <U+017F>elf, and that to comply with you there was no other way but
by deceiving you. We mu<U+017F>t needs have given way to the fir<U+017F>t violence of your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
le<U+017F>t by too great oppo<U+017F>ition they would have turn'd to fury. For my part
I am he hath with the fir<U+017F>t endeavoured to undeceive you, and you may have taken
notice of it; and 'tis in this ca<U+017F>e that you have had te<U+017F>timony of that friend<U+017F>hip
which I have <U+017F>o often boa<U+017F>ted you. Let it appear that I have employ'd my time
well this day, and that you will no longer per<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in tho<U+017F>e errors which have hitherto
troubled your brain.</p>
            <p>What mu<U+017F>t I then do? <U+017F>ays <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> advi<U+017F>e me, that <U+017F>o I may not be de<U+017F>titute of
all things. I have erewhiles <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>hewn you the impertinences of tho<U+017F>e fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
books, replies <hi>Clarimond;</hi> and through a fatal chance, all tho<U+017F>e who have
entertain'd you hitherto have <U+017F>hewn you as much, though po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly without any
de<U+017F>ign of theirs. All the <U+017F>tories which were told you one night of the rural Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were <U+017F>o ridiculous, that you need no more to di<U+017F>engage your faith from Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Transformations. As for the hi<U+017F>tories of the four Shepherds, I have already
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>omwhat by way of example concerning the four kinds of <hi>Romances.</hi> Since
<hi>Synopa</hi> had before given you a Relation of <hi>Metamorpho<U+017F>es,</hi> it was requi<U+017F>ite the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tory
of <hi>Fontenay</hi> <U+017F>hould repre<U+017F>ent a <hi>Romance</hi> after the ancient mode, where they
talk of <hi>Nayads,</hi> men falling in love with them<U+017F>elves as <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us</hi> did, and the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Magicians. As for the hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Philiris,</hi> it repre<U+017F>ented a Romance full of
<U+017F>ympathie, <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>uch as might pa<U+017F>s in this age, giving only the
names of Shepherds to the per<U+017F>ons introduc'd. As for what pa<U+017F>s'd between <hi>Polidor</hi>
and <hi>Rhodogina,</hi> there's an example of tho<U+017F>e tales that old wives tell children, and of
<U+017F>uch as I call <hi>Italian</hi> fables, becau<U+017F>e the Italians were the fir<U+017F>t broachers of them.
<hi>Straparole</hi> hath made a <U+017F>ort of them in his <hi>Merry-nights,</hi> and divers others have
imitated him. As for the adventures of <hi>Meliantes,</hi> they are according to the mode
of your military <hi>Romances;</hi> and it is not to be forgotten that even <hi>Carmelin</hi> in the
relation of his life hath given us an example of tho<U+017F>e <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Romances, wherein
are repre<U+017F>ented the <U+017F>hifts and cheats of Beggers and Servants. It will be ea<U+017F>ily
granted that all the<U+017F>e Narrations exceed tho<U+017F>e I allow them for pre<U+017F>idents; for
though they are not <U+017F>o long, yet do they contain better things, and all through
di<U+017F>cover both order and invention. However I mu<U+017F>t tell you they are <U+017F>ufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
and worthy to be contemn'd: And upon this ground I am to per<U+017F>wade
you not to give your<U+017F>elf any more to the reading of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>tories, <U+017F>ince the be<U+017F>t of
them are not worth any thing; and that if you read any, it may be to laugh at
them, or at the mo<U+017F>t for a tran<U+017F>ient plea<U+017F>ure, without ever imagining that you
<U+017F>hould live like the per<U+017F>ons which are mentioned in them. Your de<U+017F>ire was to
imitate the Shepherds, though there be no plea<U+017F>ure in that kind of life; a
man may live well enough in the Country, without carrying a <U+017F>heephook: See
how <hi>Hircan</hi> lives, <U+017F>ee how <hi>Orontes,</hi> <U+017F>ee how I live: We live always here, we go a
hunting, we go a fi<U+017F>hing, we walk abroad, we do what we plea<U+017F>e; is not that all
you can de<U+017F>ire? Whereas if we were Shepherds, we mu<U+017F>t look after our Flocks,
which were a thing of too much trouble: one while a Sheep would be gone a<U+017F>tray,
which mu<U+017F>t be found again; another while a Wolf would make bold with one,
and that mu<U+017F>t be pur<U+017F>u'd and recover'd; or it may be a Rot would <U+017F>eize all our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43725:201"/>
flock, and it would be no <U+017F>mall employment to make them <U+017F>ound again. What
means is there for men to enjoy them<U+017F>elves, as you would de<U+017F>ire to do, amid<U+017F>t
the<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal occupations which belong only to <U+017F>ervants? you will tell me, that the
Shepherds mention'd in the books, were not <U+017F>o careful of their flocks, and that they
entru<U+017F>ted them to others; or it may be they had not any at all. You mu<U+017F>t then
grant me, that there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of keeping <U+017F>heep in point of happine<U+017F>s; nor
con<U+017F>equently to be clad in white, and carry a <U+017F>heephook: for the equipage of a
Shepherd, is not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to him that does not actually profe<U+017F>s Shepherdry; and
when you <U+017F>hall quote me the examples of divers who have wore <U+017F>uch a habit as
yours, and yet kept no flocks, I <U+017F>hall confe<U+017F>s that your Books are true; but if ever
any did wear <U+017F>uch a habit, they did it only out of conformity to <U+017F>ome they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
with, which cannot be <U+017F>aid of you, <U+017F>ince you were for ought we know the
only <hi>Romantick</hi> Shepherd in <hi>France,</hi> when you began to be <U+017F>o fir<U+017F>t. Now do not
tell me, that you know well enough that there are not many of your quality, but
that your de<U+017F>ign is to bring Shepherdry into its former reputation; for to what
purpo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould you do <U+017F>o? I tell you once more, that without all that trouble you
may enjoy all the plea<U+017F>ures in the world. Remember what <hi>Fontenay</hi> did one day
ca<U+017F>t in your teeth, when he compar'd you to <hi>Don Quixot;</hi> there will be many
who will not <U+017F>tick to believe you imitate him, and when your adventures <U+017F>hall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cend
his, they will be look'd on no otherwi<U+017F>e then greater arguments of your
madne<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was in a deep con<U+017F>ideration all the time of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and his minde
being more clear'd up then ordinary, the admonitions of <hi>Clarimond</hi> were not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ing
to him. Now that you have deprived me of my companions, <U+017F>aies he to
him, will you have me quit the Shepherds habit? I am <U+017F>o far from robbing you of
your Companions, replies <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that <hi>Philiris</hi> and the re<U+017F>t will be more with
you then ever, and will be eternally your friends; but for the Shepherds habit, you
have no mans approbation to wear it any longer. If you only took that from me,
'twere no great matter, <U+017F>afes <hi>Ly<U+017F>is;</hi> but you will al<U+017F>o take away all te<U+017F>timonies of
the affection I de<U+017F>ire to bear <hi>Charite,</hi> and 'tis a great hazard you will not take away
that very <hi>Charite</hi> from me. The te<U+017F>timonies of your affection to your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
hitherto have been too extravagant, <U+017F>aies <hi>Clarimond.</hi> Tho<U+017F>e must con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in things
that <U+017F>peak rea<U+017F>on, and di<U+017F>cretion, and you will finde, if you follow my directions,
that you <U+017F>hall obtain whatever you de<U+017F>ire of her, for I am very far from doing any
thing might hinder you to <U+017F>erve her. Be<U+017F>ides that, the more to induce you to quit
this Shepherds habit, I mu<U+017F>t tell you it is the onely thing wherein you di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e
her. I leave you here a while to con<U+017F>ider of it.</p>

               <hi>Clarimond</hi> having with the<U+017F>e words left <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> return'd to the re<U+017F>t of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
He told them all how gently <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had receiv'd his directions, and how <U+017F>tayed
and di<U+017F>creet his an<U+017F>wers were, and what hopes there were that in a <U+017F>hort time he
might be brought into a fair way: whereupon <hi>Amaryllis</hi> asked, whether it were
not fit to <U+017F>end the <hi>Hermit</hi> to him, who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ence might oblige him to <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>pect,
and put him the more in minde of his dutie; but it was not thought convenient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
it was more likely <hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>hould better go through with the good de<U+017F>ign
he had undertaken; <U+017F>o that the Hermite was a while after di<U+017F>patched away. 'Twas
generally confe<U+017F>t that the artifices which <hi>Clarimond</hi> had made u<U+017F>e of to re<U+017F>tore <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
to him<U+017F>elf, were <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant, that all the extravagant <U+017F>allies of the Shepherd had
not given near <U+017F>o great <U+017F>atisfaction. <hi>Carmelin</hi> him<U+017F>elf, who had heerd all, was
very glad his Ma<U+017F>ter was convinced of <U+017F>o many truths, which he had <U+017F>ometimes
taken great pains to per<U+017F>wade him to, and though he knew not what kinde of life
they <U+017F>hould lead together for the future, yet was he never the <U+017F>adder, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idered
that thenceforward no man would abu<U+017F>e them, nor would they <U+017F>uffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
to be abu<U+017F>ed: For as for his part, to remedie all the delu<U+017F>ions and cheats
which might be put upon them, he re<U+017F>olv'd, that if ever he were called to any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
or Metamorpho<U+017F>is, he would never give credit to any <U+017F>uch thing, no,
not though all the men in the world <U+017F>hould per<U+017F>wade him to a thing contrary to his
opinion.</p>

As for <hi>Adrian,</hi> he was <U+017F>o overjoi'd to <U+017F>ee how <hi>Clarimond</hi> be<U+017F>tirr'd him<U+017F>elf to re<U+017F>tore
his Cou<U+017F>in to his wits, and how far he had advanc'd, that he gave him all the thanks
imaginable. <hi>Clarimond</hi> not finding <hi>Mu<U+017F>ardan,</hi> enquir'd where he was. They told him
he was gone away, intending to lie that night at <hi>Lagny,</hi> though <hi>Hircan</hi> would have
<U+017F>taid him; &amp; that the cau<U+017F>e of his departure was, that <hi>Adrian</hi> having under<U+017F>tood at his
fir<U+017F>t coming in, that he was a maker of <hi>Romances,</hi> and that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> had read his books,
bore him <U+017F>uch an inplacable grudg, that he <U+017F>et upon him a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he could po<U+017F><U+017F>iby,
and rail'd at him he could, whereto the Author not knowing what to an<U+017F>wer, and
withal, <U+017F>eeing his adver<U+017F>arie back'd by <U+017F>o many, thought it his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to di<U+017F>lodge.
<hi>Clarimond</hi> was much vex'd that he had not <U+017F>een the conte<U+017F>t; but what he had done
in the mean time was of greater con<U+017F>equence. He was <U+017F>atisfied with the particular
account which <hi>Adrian</hi> gave him of all that had been <U+017F>aid; and afterwards turning
to another di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, he told the good man that his Cou<U+017F>ins fir<U+017F>t maladie was love,
and that the only de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>erve a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s perfectly, was that which had form'd
in his head the imaginations of <U+017F>o many adventures, which he grounded upon tho<U+017F>e
of the Romances, as he had gather'd from all that had pa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o that to per<U+017F>wade
him that a woman may be pleas'd without all tho<U+017F>e extravagances, mu<U+017F>t needs be the
only means to bring him perfectly to him<U+017F>elf; but that it were dangerous to deceive
him in this ca<U+017F>e, unle<U+017F>s there were a de<U+017F>ign to make him <U+017F>tark mad: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if he be told that <hi>Charite</hi> would not be cruel to him, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t not di<U+017F>cover the
lea<U+017F>t cruelty: Whereupon <hi>Hircan</hi> <U+017F>aid, it was no hard matter to make him a happy
man, and that was to work a marriage between him and that fair <hi>Charite. Adrian</hi> would know truly who <U+017F>he was, to <U+017F>ee if the match were any thing con<U+017F>iderable.
<hi>Leonora</hi> told him, that <U+017F>he was a near Kin<U+017F>woman of her la<U+017F>t husbands, and that
<U+017F>he had taken her into her <U+017F>ervice, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was not too forward in the world,
but that <U+017F>he would give <U+017F>omewhat with her in marriage. They repre<U+017F>ented to <hi>Adrian</hi>
that though his Cou<U+017F>in had great wealth, yet could he not meet with a more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
match, becau<U+017F>e he having the reputation of a hollow brain, there would be
no <U+017F>uch <U+017F>triving for him. <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife e<U+017F>teeming an alliance with <hi>Leonora</hi>
very honorable, and con<U+017F>idering other rea<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>aid that they thought very well of
<hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s marriage with <hi>Charite,</hi> if <U+017F>o be the re<U+017F>t of his friends would con<U+017F>ent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
They al<U+017F>o remembred them, that they had <U+017F>een that <hi>Charite</hi> in the morning,
and that <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd to be of a good calm nature, <U+017F>o that they thought very well of
her.</p>
            <p>And thus were they very <U+017F>erious about the marrying of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> out of a confidence
he would be wi<U+017F>er by it, as indeed there was much appearance. <hi>Leonora</hi> under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was very rich, <U+017F>aw that at all adventure it would not be ami<U+017F>s to be<U+017F>tow <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
on him, by rea<U+017F>on that though he <U+017F>hould continue in the <U+017F>ame cra<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, yet
his madne<U+017F>s was harmle<U+017F>s, and haply he had not been guilty of <U+017F>o many extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
had not others <U+017F>tarted the occa<U+017F>ions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orontes</hi> upon this going home with all tho<U+017F>e that had any relation to him, <hi>Adrian</hi>
took his leave of them, promi<U+017F>ing <hi>Leonora</hi> that he would treat with his friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the marriage of his Cou<U+017F>in, and that he would write to her what he <U+017F>hould
do in it. <hi>Clarimond</hi> went up into the chamber where <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was, and <U+017F>aid to him.
You mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s that the moment wherein you began to contemn your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
opinion was very happy to you; for it was no <U+017F>ooner heard that you would
hearken to rea<U+017F>on, but all the world are per<U+017F>waded you will obtain your own wi<U+017F>hes
of <hi>Charite: Leonora, Angelica, Adrian,</hi> and <hi>Pernella</hi> are of your <U+017F>ide; who can
now do you any hurt? That very <hi>Charite,</hi> replies <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> You will find the contrary,
<U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> fell afre<U+017F>h to con<U+017F>ider of this, and yet he was extremely glad to under<U+017F>tand
that tho<U+017F>e who were mo<U+017F>t concern'd in his affairs were <U+017F>o favourable to him. When
<U+017F>upper-time came, he <U+017F>ate down at table with the re<U+017F>t: But the <U+017F>hame which <U+017F>eiz'd
him that he was <U+017F>o long abu<U+017F>ed by tho<U+017F>e in whom he had plac'd the greate<U+017F>t confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
had <U+017F>o ca<U+017F>t him down, that he dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>peak a word. <hi>Adrian</hi> and his wife
thought it a good <U+017F>ign, and conceiv'd he would thenceforward be more di<U+017F>creet;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43725:202"/>
<U+017F>o that the next day they return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> very well <U+017F>atisfied, promi<U+017F>ing him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he de<U+017F>ired, on condition he would be no more a <hi>Shepherd.</hi> As for <hi>Clarimond,</hi>
he thought that <U+017F>ilence no good pre<U+017F>age, and that it was to be fear'd he might fall
out of one misfortune into another, and that his extravagance would turn to <U+017F>tupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.
To remedy this, he thought it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary he were withdrawn from tho<U+017F>e per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
who oblig'd him to <U+017F>o much fear and ba<U+017F>hfulne<U+017F>s. This de<U+017F>ign communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to <hi>Hircan,</hi> who thought it very convenient that <hi>Clarimond</hi> took <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> and
<hi>Carmelin</hi> to his own Ca<U+017F>tle.</p>
            <p>They were no <U+017F>ooner gone, but <hi>Fontenay</hi> and his companions took their way for
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> whither <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s call'd them. They gave infinite thanks to <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
not only for their entertainment <U+017F>o long, but al<U+017F>o for the rare diver<U+017F>ions which
by his means they had had. In the mean time <hi>Angelica</hi> told <hi>Charite,</hi> that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be married to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is.</hi> Her an<U+017F>wer was, that it was only to abu<U+017F>e her,
to be<U+017F>tow her on a man that was a laughing-<U+017F>tock where-ever he came. <hi>Angelica</hi>
a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd her, that for the future he would be wi<U+017F>er, and that nobody would per<U+017F>wade
him to any further extravagances. She had no quarrel with his per<U+017F>on, for his face
was not <U+017F>o deformed as to frighten; and if all were as well in his mind, <U+017F>he would
not be long entreated to make good what was undertaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> being at <hi>Clarimond's,</hi> found that <hi>Montenor</hi> had <U+017F>ent from his hou<U+017F>e the
cloaths he was accu<U+017F>tom'd to wear in the City, which <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> had not fogotten
to pre<U+017F>erve. <hi>Clarimond</hi> told him that he mu<U+017F>t put them on; and indeed they were
more convenient for the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on then the Shepherds habit. His Coat was all <U+017F>potted
and all torn, it could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly hold out in <U+017F>o many adventures; and it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<U+017F>o ill lined, that it could not defend him from the cold and rains which in the
Autumn were <U+017F>omwhat frequent. He therefore took the Cloaths, which it was a
long time <U+017F>ince he had worn; but he was <U+017F>o long making him<U+017F>elf ready, that it was
ea<U+017F>ily perceiv'd he was not perfectly re<U+017F>olv'd to do what he did. I cannot di<U+017F><U+017F>emble,
<U+017F>ays he to <hi>Clarimond;</hi> it troubles me much to quit a garment that I was long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>tom'd
to: I thought that the only wearing of it was a powerfull means to make
me enjoy all the plea<U+017F>ures of this life. The<U+017F>e opinions are hard to overcome. Are
you not then yet converted? <U+017F>ays <hi>Clarimond;</hi> have you not been a <hi>Shepherd</hi> long
enough? I will bring one of the true<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>ons in the world to convince you. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your<U+017F>elf, and you will find that in all your Books of <hi>Shepherdry,</hi> they only
that are in Love are clad like Shepherds: As for tho<U+017F>e that are married, it is not
<U+017F>aid that they meddle with any Flocks. You mu<U+017F>t do <U+017F>o if you marry <hi>Charite,</hi> as I
hope you will. 'Tis true, you are not yet married; but what will you be the wor<U+017F>e
to quit the habit of a Batchelour a little before, <U+017F>ince your friends advi<U+017F>e you
to it?</p>
            <p>This was a huge <U+017F>ubtilty of <hi>Clarimonds:</hi> He would bring <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> to rea<U+017F>on by the
authority of tho<U+017F>e ancient Authors, and bring him to wi<U+017F>dome by the maxims of
folly. Yet <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>millingly <U+017F>aid to him, Dear friend! you do not con<U+017F>ider, that when
it is not mention'd that tho<U+017F>e that are not married kept Flocks, it is only that they
are not brought upon the <U+017F>tage <U+017F>o openly, in regard it is the Authors de<U+017F>ign to
write only the hi<U+017F>tory of young Lovers that are to be married. And when you find
any fathers of families withdraw to their hou<U+017F>es, 'tis by rea<U+017F>on of their old age, or
becau<U+017F>e they have children big enough to look after their <U+017F>heep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarimond</hi> hearing this, was afraid <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted <U+017F>till in his former imaginations;
<U+017F>o that he roughly return'd him this an<U+017F>wer. Whatever you can alleadge, it matters
not: So it is, that I mu<U+017F>t have you in good earne<U+017F>t <U+017F>hake off this Shepherds habit.
Is there any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to wear it to charm a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s? Con<U+017F>ider, I pray, who hath
been more fortunate in their Loves, you or <hi>An<U+017F>elme:</hi> Did <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> ever turn Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
to get <hi>Angelica?</hi> Had he done it, he had not obtain'd her yet; and for your
part, as long as you are one, you <U+017F>hall never obtain <hi>Charite.</hi> Have I not told you,
that the Maids in the<U+017F>e times do not affect Shepherds? You that do all you can to
plea<U+017F>e your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, do you not perceive that you have done nothing but di<U+017F>pleas'd
her hitherto?</p>

The<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably pre<U+017F>s'd, and <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie to be apprehended, fini<U+017F>h'd the
work of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> his conver<U+017F>ion. And to make him yet conceive the truth more fully,
<hi>Clarimond</hi> <U+017F>eeing he <U+017F>aid not a word, continued his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e in this manner. What
could you hope to do by cloathing your <U+017F>elf thus like a Comedian, and living like
a <hi>Romantick</hi> per<U+017F>on? I will rub over your memory with the misfortunes have
happen'd to you upon that occa<U+017F>ion. You could never bring about any one of your
Love-de<U+017F>igns. When you de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak with your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, or at lea<U+017F>t ki<U+017F>s the
window whereon <U+017F>he learn'd, you fell down the ladder, having your no<U+017F>e bath'd in
blood, <U+017F>o that you were taken by the collar for a thief and a murtherer. As for your
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ing your<U+017F>elf like a Maid, you were never the better for it, it came to nothing;
and <U+017F>o did your Metamorpho<U+017F>is. If it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible a man could be chang'd into a
Tree, what were he the better for it? You imagin'd it a matter of honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
and 'tis true, the Poets bring examples of a many per<U+017F>ons favour'd by the
Gods, which have chang'd forms: but do you not find al<U+017F>o in the <U+017F>ame Authors,
that tho<U+017F>e who had committed the greate<U+017F>t crimes were in like manner transform'd?
'Tis therefore a que<U+017F>tion whether the Metamorpho<U+017F>is be a puni<U+017F>hment or a reward;
and the true judgment that may be given of it, is, that it ought every way to be
taken as a mo<U+017F>t ridiculous ab<U+017F>urdity. As for the imaginary deliverance of <hi>Pamphilia,</hi>
wherein you thought you had done <U+017F>uch miracles of valour, and merited a name
and place among<U+017F>t the mo<U+017F>t famous Heroes, who<U+017F>e hath lived till now;
what wonders could you have done, had you been invu<U+017F>nerable as you imagin'd?
'Twas only your confidence of being <U+017F>o, that made you go <U+017F>o cheerfully to fight.
It was the <U+017F>ame ca<U+017F>e with <hi>Achilles</hi> and a many other Heroes, who could not be
wounded, whom you thought to imitate. Be their adventures either fabulous or
true, I <U+017F>hall laugh at all tho<U+017F>e that take them for valiant Champions, and compare
to them all the Princes they would celebrate: For had they believ'd they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
wounds, it would have di<U+017F>covered <U+017F>ome natural cowardi<U+017F>e in them, and they
had never gone to the battel <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olutely. I believe you do not intend to play the
<hi>Heros</hi> any more; but you will have me think that you cannot <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily take your
leave of the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> becau<U+017F>e you would <U+017F>till continue your extravagancies, which
you think are te<U+017F>timonies of your affection to <hi>Charite.</hi> What, will you <U+017F>till ob<U+017F>erve
how many bits you eat, and how many times you drink; and that to honour <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite?</hi>
Would you al<U+017F>o eat nought but <hi>red</hi> things, and will you never be at ea<U+017F>e till
you are turn'd towards that quarter where you conceive your fair one to be? Will
you henceforth ob<U+017F>erve your amorous conformities? will you eat nothing but
what <hi>Charite</hi> likes? will you cough when <U+017F>he coughs; and if <U+017F>he have the eye bound
up, will you have yours too? What other end can there be of this, but to make you
be laugh'd at? A woman is never touch'd with any love for any of the<U+017F>e fooleries:
this is not the way to render <U+017F>ervices to a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. All your pa<U+017F>t actions can <U+017F>ignifie
nothing to this purpo<U+017F>e. And if it was your de<U+017F>ign to <U+017F>hew by that means how great
your compliance was, I tell you, you will di<U+017F>cover it much more, if you quit the
Shepherds habit. That's the point I drive at, and I will make it cleerly appear to
you where your great error lies; and that is, that you have not labour'd at all the
principal conformity which is now required, <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o much given to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities.
<hi>Charite</hi> is dre<U+017F>s'd as an ordinary Maid of her condition, and you are clad
like a Shewer of Puppet-playes. Since <U+017F>he is not clad like a Shepherde<U+017F>s, you <U+017F>hould
not go like a Shepherd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having heard all this, was a<U+017F>ham'd he had <U+017F>aid any thing that <U+017F>hould make
<hi>Clarimond</hi> believe he would contradict him. The rea<U+017F>ons that Gentleman had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg'd,
wrought <U+017F>o powerfully on him, that he re<U+017F>olv'd to follow them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The fear he was in to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e <hi>Charite,</hi> kept his mind within compa<U+017F>s; <U+017F>o that
he <U+017F>uffer'd them to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e his Shepherds habit where they pleas'd, <U+017F>o it <U+017F>hould be
never <U+017F>een again. Having found al<U+017F>o among his tromperies the <hi>Metaphorical Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
and all tho<U+017F>e things he had <U+017F>o carefully pre<U+017F>erv'd becau<U+017F>e, they had come from
his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, he of his own accord gave them to <hi>Clarimond</hi> to, do what he pleas'd
with them. It was not fit he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee any more the badges of his ancient follies,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43725:203"/>
and his hope was he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hortly obtain of <hi>Charite</hi> favours of greater con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
then tho<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>Since the bare reading of <hi>Romances</hi> had been able to put <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
into him, <U+017F>econded by the cheats and abu<U+017F>es had been put upon him, 'tis to
be conceiv'd he was of a tender per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ible compo<U+017F>ition of mind, and that it was as
ea<U+017F>ie to make him hate his extravagances, as it had been to bring him in love with
them. He accordingly confe<U+017F>s'd to <hi>Clarimond,</hi> that he heartily repented him of all
he had done; but that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to refrain doing them, becau<U+017F>e that
though he was not ignorant of the truth, yet he <U+017F>ometimes would deceive him<U+017F>elf
purpo<U+017F>ely to deceive others, <U+017F>o to make his adventures the more remarkable. As
for example, he was never half per<U+017F>waded that he was chang'd into a Tree, nor did
he believe tho<U+017F>e other extraordinary things; but he pretended to believe them, that
others might believe them too, and that there might be made of him a <hi>Romance</hi> that
<U+017F>hould make him eternally famous. He at length came to an excellent good humour
and was more apprehen<U+017F>ive of rea<U+017F>on then he had ever been, as it happens that mens
minds pa<U+017F>s from one extreme to another: which <hi>Clarimond</hi> ob<U+017F>erving, told him
that he was the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfied man in the world, to <U+017F>ee him as other men. And
thereupon to make a final riddance of all tho<U+017F>e corrupt imaginations, he made a
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to him about the <hi>Divinity,</hi> repre<U+017F>enting to him that we <U+017F>hould adore none
but God alone, and not idolize his Creatures, which we mu<U+017F>t only love in order to
him; whereas it <U+017F>eem'd he did not love God but for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>ake. He <U+017F>hew'd
him, that the Eyes of a Beauty are no Suns, that give us day, or could reduce to
a<U+017F>hes tho<U+017F>e things whereon they ca<U+017F>t their rayes. And thus he gave him cleerly to
<U+017F>ee the errors he committed in relation to all Sciences, when he took the Poets for
warrant and authority for what he <U+017F>aid. For his further in<U+017F>tructions, he permitted
him to go into his Study, and there choo<U+017F>e out <U+017F>ome good Books.</p>
            <p>They <U+017F>pent five or <U+017F>ix dayes in <U+017F>uch entertainments, in which time <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> and
<hi>Hircan</hi> neglected not to <U+017F>end daily to know what they did. They were very glad to
hear that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> began to hearken to Rea<U+017F>on; for it would have been a huge bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s,
if after they had made as much <U+017F>port with him as they could de<U+017F>ire, they
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>till wi<U+017F>h to <U+017F>ee him in his extravagances. <hi>Clarimond</hi> being de<U+017F>irous that all
might <U+017F>ee what an excellent Phy<U+017F>itian of the mind he was, would needs carry his
Gue<U+017F>t abroad to vi<U+017F>it their common friends: but <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> told him that he had no great
de<U+017F>ire to go, becau<U+017F>e he was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the many follies he had committed before
them, and fear'd they might jeer him. <hi>Clarimond</hi> made great prote<U+017F>tations to him,
to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him there <U+017F>hould be no <U+017F>uch thing; and told him withall, that any one
might ea<U+017F>ily conceive that a per<U+017F>on in Love is not him<U+017F>elf, and that his pa<U+017F>t actions
were as much to be excus'd as the ravings of one in a burning feaver.</p>
            <p>They went therefore in the fir<U+017F>t place to <hi>Hircan's,</hi> and thence to <hi>Oroutes's,</hi>
where they were all amaz'd to <U+017F>ee that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> was not the <U+017F>ame man who had plaid
<U+017F>o many ridiculous tricks before them. He was extreme <U+017F>ad, according to his di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition;
and he was now of the <U+017F>ame humour he was of in his infancie. Yet he <U+017F>pake
when he was <U+017F>poken to earne<U+017F>tly, but it was without any laughing, how plea<U+017F>ant
<U+017F>oever the occa<U+017F>ion might be. 'Tis the cu<U+017F>tom of tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e brains are too light,
whether they laugh, or whether they rejoice, they do it in the heat of their <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s;
their joy is but an extravagance, and their laughing from the teeth outward; but
when their phren<U+017F>ie is <U+017F>omwhat over, they make no noi<U+017F>e, and whatever is <U+017F>aid is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to them. I wonder at nothing <U+017F>o much, as that <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> did not change his
Love with his humour: but it is to be conceived his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion proceeded from another
cau<U+017F>e then that of his folly.</p>
            <p>He <U+017F>ecretly learn'd out the place where his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was, and he was permitted
to vi<U+017F>it her. He demanded her pardon, if he had at other times importun'd her with
extraordinary di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, and that for the future the te<U+017F>timonies of his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her <U+017F>hould be no other then what were according to the precepts of rea<U+017F>on.
She, who had been commanded by <hi>Lenora</hi> to receive him courteou<U+017F>ly, an<U+017F>wered
him, that <U+017F>he thought her<U+017F>elf much honour'd in his Love, if <U+017F>o be his affections did
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43725:204"/>
not exceed the limits of hone<U+017F>ty. This gave him <U+017F>uch <U+017F>atisfaction, that he imagined
there were no more mi<U+017F>eries ordain'd for him; nor indeed was he deceiv'd; for
about this time <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi> received Letters from <hi>Adrian,</hi> by which he under<U+017F>tood
that all <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s friends, whereof <U+017F>ome by chance knew <hi>Charite,</hi> con<U+017F>ented he <U+017F>hould
marry her, provided he were fully delivered from his former imaginations. <hi>An<U+017F>elme</hi>
return'd him an an<U+017F>wer to the great commeudation of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> and de<U+017F>ired him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>Brie,</hi> and bring with him tho<U+017F>e he thought convenient to his Cou<U+017F>ins wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
The me<U+017F><U+017F>enger departed immediately, and <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of his happine<U+017F>s, was
inexpre<U+017F>sibly glad. Yet he <U+017F>aid not much of it, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Clarimond</hi> had forbidden
him to engage into unprofitable di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es when he were in company, le<U+017F>t through
negligence he might <U+017F>lip into <U+017F>ome of his ancient <hi>Romantick</hi> talk. He <U+017F>o extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lov'd this Gentleman, <U+017F>ince he under<U+017F>tood that he bore him <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>incere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he was ever afraid to di<U+017F>obey him, nay when he but <U+017F>aw him, he corrected
his behavior, and thought that all the imaginations came into his minde were <U+017F>uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous;
<U+017F>o that he held his peace for a good while after.</p>
            <p>Two days after came <hi>Adrian,</hi> with two other of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s Cou<U+017F>ins. <hi>Lenoora</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
them very kindely at <hi>Orontes</hi>'s: When they <U+017F>aw their Kin<U+017F>man, they thought
they had never <U+017F>een a wi<U+017F>er man; as indeed there was <U+017F>uch a difference between what
he had been, and what he was, that if he chanc'd to <U+017F>lip into <U+017F>ome little imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
they were <U+017F>o dull, that they could not perceave it. The contract of his
marriage was pa<U+017F>s'd without his notice, all he troubled him<U+017F>elf with was to <U+017F>ign it.
<hi>Adrian</hi> had the care to <U+017F>ee it in form, he him<U+017F>elf being <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported in his loves,
that he could not de<U+017F>cend to <U+017F>uch low thoughts as relate to the goods of fortune.
<hi>Charite</hi> had <U+017F>omewhat left her by her father, and be<U+017F>ides that, <hi>Leonora</hi> gave her
a hou<U+017F>e; which <U+017F>tood <U+017F>omewhat near that of <hi>Orontes.</hi> There it was re<U+017F>olved the
new married couple <U+017F>hould keep hou<U+017F>e together; for though <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> would be no
longer a Shepherd, yet would he not leave the Country. There was a great fea<U+017F>t at
their making <U+017F>ure, and the next day they were married: Though the company was
not great, yet they were merry enough, but nothing all the while <U+017F>aid to <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> that
might offend him; it being but a little while <U+017F>ince he began to follow the common
opinion of all other men, 'twould have been dangerous to put him into any di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmelin</hi> <U+017F>eeing his <hi>Ma<U+017F>ter</hi> married, wi<U+017F>h'd him<U+017F>elf the <U+017F>ame happine<U+017F>s. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>
having given him a <U+017F>mall <U+017F>um of money for his good and faithful <U+017F>ervice, <hi>Li<U+017F>etta</hi>
continued no longer in rebellion, but <U+017F>ubmitted. The next day they were married,
and though he was but <U+017F>imple, and no great Clerk, <hi>Orontes</hi> made him Bailiff with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Lord<U+017F>hip, finding him able enough for that charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi>'s friends returned to <hi>Paris</hi> with <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi>
who carried his wife with him. <hi>Orontes</hi> writ to them <U+017F>ince, that the two lovers his
neighbors liv'd a very comfortable life together, and that there wanted nothing to
make them perfectly happy, but to finde <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>ome little office, for to exempt him
of the taxes. When they had purchas'd him one, he thought him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>uch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
as might defie misfortune, <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf a Country Gentleman, and the
cloathes he wore of <U+017F>everal colours pleas'd him no le<U+017F>s then the Countrymans coat:
yet whenever he heard the bleating of <U+017F>heep, he could not but call to minde the
fal<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ure he once took to keep <U+017F>ome. He <U+017F>ometimes as he read a Book, <U+017F>traid
into the woods; but he had quite <U+017F>haken hands with all Love-books, he medled
now with none but Treati<U+017F>es of Moral Philo<U+017F>ophy. Yet <hi>Clarimond</hi> perceiving that
his minde receiv'd all impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions with too much vehemence, was afraid he would
fall into <U+017F>ome other new folly, and more particularly become a <hi>Ssoick</hi> or <hi>Cinick</hi>
Philo<U+017F>opher. He had already read in <hi>Charron</hi> and <U+017F>ome other Authors, that a man
mu<U+017F>t take pains in the generation of children, and yet not give ones <U+017F>elf bruitally
over to it, and that there were <U+017F>ome certain ob<U+017F>ervations whereby to get fair chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<U+017F>trait and witty. He would ob<U+017F>erve with <hi>Charite</hi> the <hi>Dict pre<U+017F>crib'd</hi> for that
purpo<U+017F>e, and his care<U+017F><U+017F>es and embraces were limited to the appointed time. But
<hi>Clarimond</hi> de<U+017F>irous to keep him from being either <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious or extravagant, rid
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43725:204"/>
him of tho<U+017F>e fancies a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he perceiv'd him po<U+017F><U+017F>es'd with them. He told him,
he <U+017F>hould laugh at tho<U+017F>e Philo<U+017F>ophers, who though never married them<U+017F>elves, yet
importune us with their fanta<U+017F>tick notions of marriage; and moreover a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him,
that to get perfect children, it was enough to live temperately, referring the bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
to nature; and that when the children were born, good education perfected the
re<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Clarimond</hi> and <hi>Orontes</hi> alwaies divert him from things that were not
commendable; and though a many came to <U+017F>ee him out of de<U+017F>ign to put his follies
afre<U+017F>h into his head, yet they prevailed nothing. I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s that there
happened to him adventures plea<U+017F>ant enough <U+017F>ince his marriage, but his particular
friends were the only witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of them, and it is not my de<U+017F>ign to make my hi<U+017F>tory
any longer. I mu<U+017F>t leave that to <U+017F>ome other that will take the pains, that when <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
per<U+017F>ons have employed their endeavors on the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject, it may be judg'd
who hath done be<U+017F>t. All I have now to do, is to give you that account which is
ever requir'd at the end of all Love-<U+017F>tories, which is to let you know what became of
all the per<U+017F>ons therein mentioned. Know therefore, that <hi>Philiris</hi> and <hi>Fontenay</hi> are
married in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that <hi>Polidor</hi> was kill'd in a duel, and that <hi>Meliantes</hi> is gone
to travel. <hi>Montenor</hi> and <hi>Clarimond</hi> are <U+017F>till Bachelors. <hi>Leonor a</hi> is dead; and as for
<hi>Hircan, Orontes</hi> and <hi>An<U+017F>elme,</hi> they keep good hou<U+017F>e with their wives, and <U+017F>o does
<hi>Carmelin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have now all; it was in my de<U+017F>ign to tell you of the divers fortunes of the
Shepherd <hi>Ly<U+017F>is,</hi> according to the notes I had of them from <hi>Philiris</hi> and <hi>Clarimond,</hi>
who it <U+017F>eems had not the lei<U+017F>ure to put them into order. <hi>Ly<U+017F>is</hi> having read <U+017F>ome
part of this, was nothing troubled to <U+017F>ee his adventures made publicke, becau<U+017F>e he
believes <U+017F>uch as they are, they will be a te<U+017F>timony of the affection he ever bore
<hi>Charite;</hi> and that be<U+017F>ides, it will be an example for youth not to regulate their
lives according to tho<U+017F>e impertinences, which are contrary to the order of the
world. But becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>peak to you of him as one that is <U+017F>till alive, I am in doubt
whether many who <U+017F>hall read his Hi<U+017F>tory, may not be guilty of a curio<U+017F>ity to go
into <hi>Brie,</hi> to <U+017F>ee if they can finde that <U+017F>o famous <hi>Ly<U+017F>is:</hi> Wherefore I give them
notice, that henceforth they <U+017F>hall not need take the pains, and that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly they
may not finde him, becau<U+017F>e he is <U+017F>o chang'd, that he hath left off that very name
he was call'd by when he was a Shepherd. And be<U+017F>ides, why may they not di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t
me? What know they whether I have not related a fable to them in<U+017F>tead of a true
Hi<U+017F>tory; or that I have not, to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e things, and not di<U+017F>cover the per<U+017F>ons I have
<U+017F>poken of, as indeed I have, call'd them by other then their ordinary names, and
mi<U+017F>taken <hi>Brie</hi> for <U+017F>ome other Province?</p>
