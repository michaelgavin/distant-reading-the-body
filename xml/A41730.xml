         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the Year 1663. in the <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>niver<U+017F>ity of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
I hearing the mo<U+017F>t Famous, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
Man in Studies, <hi>Francis de
le Boe-Sylvius,</hi> daily teaching concerning
the <hi>Pancreatick Juyce,</hi> to be one of the chiefe<U+017F>t
Foundations of Phy<U+017F>ick, I endeavoured to find
out that, hitherto undi<U+017F>covered Juyce; the which
when I had done, and indeed after that manner
which he had fir<U+017F>t de<U+017F>cribed to us; he having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding
thereof, with all Diligence did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
me to Print tho<U+017F>e things, which I had ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
worthy of Notice, concerning this Subject,
through diver<U+017F>e Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections of various Animals:
And I, willing to gratifie his Reque<U+017F>t, publi<U+017F>hed
a little Treati<U+017F>e, concerning the Nature, and
Office of the Pancreatick Juyce; which, although
in an unpoli<U+017F>hed manner, neverthele<U+017F>s, it <U+017F>o took
with the Curious Indagators of Nature, that in
a <U+017F>hort time, <U+017F>ufficient Examples of that Nature,
were de<U+017F>ired of me: For which cau<U+017F>e, in the Year
1666, I publi<U+017F>hed, at <hi>paris,</hi> this little Treati<U+017F>e, in
the <hi>French</hi> Tongue; which, three or four Months
<pb facs="tcp:64159:4"/>
together, I pre<U+017F>ented to the Famous Dr. <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot,</hi>
to be publickly examined; to who<U+017F>e Hou<U+017F>e
the mo<U+017F>t Curious Wits of the <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>niver<U+017F>ity do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
re<U+017F>ort. And I, <U+017F>eeing that this <U+017F>econd
Edition wonderfully took with the mo<U+017F>t Learned
Phy<U+017F>itians of all <hi>France,</hi> who have their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and returning to my own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
I found that there were remaining no Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of my Fir<U+017F>t Edition, being in<U+017F>tigated by the
Printer, and my Friends, for their <U+017F>akes who
under<U+017F>tood not the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, have again
turned the <U+017F>ame little Treati<U+017F>e into <hi>Latine,</hi> and
that not barely, but in <U+017F>everal places have in<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
new Ob<U+017F>ervations, and re<U+017F>olves to <U+017F>everal
Objections, put to me again<U+017F>t this Treati<U+017F>e, both
in <hi>France,</hi> and other Countries, that my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might not <U+017F>eem, in any Re<U+017F>pect, to be faulty;
So that, the Treati<U+017F>e, which I now publi<U+017F>h, may
bear the name of a new one; which I hope, will
not be unacceptable to the <hi>Reader.</hi> But <U+017F>eeing
no writing (as <hi>Plato</hi> <U+017F>aith) can be <U+017F>o exact, that
it may avoid the Cen<U+017F>ures of <hi>Criticks,</hi> without
doubt, there will be Carpers, who are better af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with Brawlings, and Drinkings, than the
Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections of Bodies, which will laugh at me,
for the <U+017F>pending <U+017F>o much time in the di<U+017F>covery of
this Juyce: But <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in an Epi<U+017F>tle to
<hi>Damagetus,</hi> hath taught me in an Hi<U+017F>tory of
<hi>Democritus,</hi> that tho<U+017F>e Gibeings ought not to
be regarded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So much of which Hi<U+017F>tory,
as mo<U+017F>t nearly appertaines to us, I will briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late:
<hi>Democritus,</hi> inferiour to none of the
<hi>Abderitans,</hi> when, to find out the nature of the
<pb facs="tcp:64159:4"/>
Bile, had betaken him<U+017F>elf, apart from the City,
and there alone had di<U+017F><U+017F>ected many Animals;
he was generally reputed to be mad; wherefore
the Senate, and People of the <hi>Abderitans</hi> being
<U+017F>ad, and troubled, did very much importune the
Prince of <hi>Phy<U+017F>itians,</hi> that he would vouch<U+017F>afe to
come, and cure the madne<U+017F>s of <hi>Democritus:
Hippocrates,</hi> by the Merits of <hi>Democritus,</hi>
and the Intreaties of the <hi>Abderitans,</hi> taking Ship
went to <hi>Abderis,</hi> where he found all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and Inhabitants gathered together, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him without the Gates; part of whom
running before, and part following, led <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
to a high Hill without the City, (cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out <U+017F>ave, help, heal,) that he might <U+017F>ee the
Madne<U+017F>s of <hi>Democritus:</hi> From whence they
<U+017F>aw <hi>Democritus</hi> <U+017F>ometimes di<U+017F><U+017F>ecting Animals,
<U+017F>ometimes mu<U+017F>eing, and <U+017F>ometimes writing.
<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> going all alone to <hi>Democritus,</hi>
and making an exact tryal of him, although then
he under<U+017F>tood he was not mad, asked him what
he wrote there? <hi>Democritus</hi> an<U+017F>wered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Madne<U+017F>s; And being further asked,
What he wrote of Madne<U+017F>s? <U+017F>aid, What el<U+017F>e,
than what it is, and how generated, and how
allayed in the Bodies of Men? For, the<U+017F>e A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
which you <U+017F>ee here, that I open for this
purpo<U+017F>e, is not becau<U+017F>e I hate the Works of God, but
<U+017F>earch out the Nature and Seat of the Bile:
For, you know, this is the cau<U+017F>e of Mens
Madne<U+017F>s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which being under<U+017F>tood,
<U+017F>aith <hi>Hippocrates, Democritus</hi> in truth, I call

Fir<U+017F>t of all, Let the <hi>Reader</hi> be per<U+017F>waded in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
that our Pancreatick Juyce is no Fictions,

<U+017F>o all men will be ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded, that as

late Renowned Profe<U+017F><U+017F>or of Phy<U+017F>ick in the <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ity
of <hi>Leyden,</hi> the fir<U+017F>t part of who<U+017F>e <hi>Praxis</hi>
is already in Engli<U+017F>h; for in regard that he
urgeth the Pancreatick Juice to be an Agent of
Fermentation and Concoction of the Chyle, and
<pb facs="tcp:64159:9"/>
<U+017F>o con<U+017F>equently a con<U+017F>titutive part of the Blood,
and Authour of many grievous Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and
Enormities of the Body. It nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follows
1. That the certainty of this Juyce ought to be
known; that is, that it be a real Juyce, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in all Mens Bodies, and not a thing only
immaginary or uncertain, which this Author hath
evidently demon<U+017F>trated. 2. The way and manner of
collecting it, by <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Experiment (the <U+017F>urest
of Guides) to convince tho<U+017F>e who oppugne, and
re<U+017F>olve the Doubting, which he hath largely
<U+017F>hewn. 3. Becau<U+017F>e the Anatomical Di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition
of the Pancreas, and its Juyce, is omitted by
<hi>Sylvius,</hi> in the fir<U+017F>t part of his Praxis, as not
pertinent to his pre<U+017F>ent Scope, which omi<U+017F><U+017F>ion this
Book <U+017F>upplies, and to which the <U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvius,</hi> in
a manner, refers his Readers: So that he which
deliberately reads this Book, will be thereby
highly inducted to the <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nder<U+017F>tanding of the
Doctrines and Notions of the mo<U+017F>t Learned <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
concerning the Pancreatick Juyce, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his whole Writings, as they relate to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and Affections of the Body of
Man.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd Commodity I <U+017F>hall propound is,
That this Book doth mo<U+017F>t Indubitably contain
the certain Cau<U+017F>es of all Agues, or Intermitting
Feavers, with their true and effectual Rules of
Curation. It is a wonder to <U+017F>ee the many Books
which have been written concerning Agues, and
Feavers, (perhaps as many as there are Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Medicines for the cure thereof) and the
great Diver<U+017F>ity of Opinions concerning their
<pb facs="tcp:64159:9"/>
Cau<U+017F>es and differences; <U+017F>o that, for a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci<U+017F>ed
with a tedious Ague, to call a Councel
of <hi>Phy<U+017F>itians</hi> to his A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, u<U+017F>ually received
no more Relief, than a Criminal Per<U+017F>on doth by the
Verdict of a Jury, which delivers him from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
either to Death, or Bani<U+017F>hment. Which
hath formerly enrolled this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of tho<U+017F>e which were wont to be termed
<hi>Opprobrium Medicorum,</hi> the Reproach of
Phy<U+017F>itians.</p>
            <p>Neither, in my Judgment, is it greatly to be
wondered at, that Phy<U+017F>itians were wont to have
no better <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s in the Cure of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>eeing they were involved in <U+017F>o many <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
about the Seat, and Cau<U+017F>e thereof; <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igning
the Seat to be in the Blood in general, others
in <U+017F>ome perticular Parts of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, where
the Blood happened to be <U+017F>tagnant; others in the
Me<U+017F>eraick Veines; others in the Guts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the Colon, and <U+017F>everal other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
as if they went about to gain the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the true Seat, Arithmetically, by the
rule of fal<U+017F>e Po<U+017F>ition. Then again, as to the
Cau<U+017F>es, and Rea<U+017F>ons of Differences, whil<U+017F>t
they a<U+017F>cribed them to the Four Humours, <hi>viz.</hi>
Blood, Choler, Phlegme, and Melancholy,
and their different Degrees of Mi<U+017F>tion, and
Putre-Faction, they ran upon <U+017F>uch Rocks as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tantly
<U+017F>hip-wracked the Barks of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
For, <U+017F>till, as they endeavoured to
<U+017F>olve one difficulty that would ari<U+017F>e, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
the Ri<U+017F>e of another. But this Author's Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe<U+017F>is,
<pb facs="tcp:64159:10"/>
being <U+017F>o free from all Intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and Difficulties, renders it agreeable to
Truth.</p>
            <p>I have yet further to <U+017F>ay in the behalf of its
Certainty, that is the Con<U+017F>equence of Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which, although every <U+017F>ingle Cure of a Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e
doth not indeed declare the Admini<U+017F>trator of
the Medicine, to have a certain Intelligence of
the Cau<U+017F>e of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; yet, when a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper
<U+017F>hall be certainly cured, at divers times,
in different Per<U+017F>ons, and with different Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments;
alwayes from the Notions, Doctrines,
and Con<U+017F>iderations of the <U+017F>ame Cau<U+017F>e, that
<U+017F>urely is a certain Argument that the Cau<U+017F>e is
known. And this I my <U+017F>elf have oft-times
done even to Admiration, by removing Ague-Fits
in a few dayes <U+017F>pace, and never yet failing of
the Cure of any kind of Ague, whether Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
Tertian, or Quartan, with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds;
and am yet (by God's ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
at any time, to undertake the cure of
the wor<U+017F>t Ague-Fits that are; which Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition,
I acknowledge, I owe to this Author:

There is yet a Third <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>tillity of this Book,
which is, That it refutes <U+017F>everal Errours in
Phy<U+017F>ick, and Anatomy; many of which, in
times pa<U+017F>t, have been received for certain
Truths, and <U+017F>ome of them perhaps yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the Principle whereof relate to the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas,

            <p>I have nothing more to <U+017F>ay, but to beg the

him of the Difficulty of things of this Nature,
(e<U+017F>pecially when an Author writes in <U+017F>uch a
<U+017F>tyle as <hi>de Graaf</hi> hath done) that if he meet

Nature, are referred only to four Kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
Veins, Nerves, and it's own proper
Ductus. The <hi>Arteries</hi> borrow their Original
from the Caeliaca, the <hi>Veins</hi> from the Ramus
Splenicus; the <hi>Nerves</hi> from the <U+017F>ixth pair of
Nerves, and the <hi>Ductus Pancreaticus</hi> <U+017F>eems to be
derived from the Parenchyma of the Pancreas.

            <p>We think it to be worth our while to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
that in many and different Animals, which
belongs to the In<U+017F>ertion of the Ductus Pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aticus;
<U+017F>eeing that Nature oftentimes in one is
more depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed and ob<U+017F>cure, in another, more
clearly manife<U+017F>ted; <U+017F>o that none can truly
determine concerning the U<U+017F>e, and Office
of any part, which hath not diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the Fabrick, and Scituation, the Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els
annexed, and other accidents in divers Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
            <p>For which Cau<U+017F>e, we will briefly in<U+017F>ert below
the Differences, which we have ob<U+017F>erved in <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
kinds of living Creatures; as well that
which belongs to the Ductus, as that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to it's In<U+017F>ertion, that all may be able the
better to judge of it's u<U+017F>e. There are <U+017F>ome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
which have only one <U+017F>ingle Pancreatick
Duct. Others there are which have it double,
and la<U+017F>tly, <U+017F>ome have three, when the Ductus
is <U+017F>ingle; <U+017F>ometimes it enters with the Ductus
Biliarius into the Inte<U+017F>tinum Duodenum, and
<U+017F>ometimes a part. When the Ductus is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate,
<U+017F>ometimes one, <U+017F>ometimes both meet
together with the Ductus Biliarius in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tine.
But when the Ductus is threefold, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one only, <U+017F>ometimes two, and <U+017F>ometimes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64159:21"/>
all three enter into the Inte<U+017F>tine by the <U+017F>ame
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and al<U+017F>o therein lay down a contained
Humour. And if you con<U+017F>ider the place of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ertion,
it very much differs in divers living
Creatures; for <U+017F>ome are found in which the
Ducts do disburden them<U+017F>elves into the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tines,
and al<U+017F>o others in which they are di<U+017F>charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Ventricle.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>ingle Ductus for the mo<U+017F>t part is found
in Man, Calves, Hogs, Hares, Conies, Cats,
Dogs, Pikes, Carps, Eells, Barbils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
we have formerly a<U+017F><U+017F>erted; for in Men and
Dogs we find it <U+017F>ometimes double, yet <U+017F>o as the
<U+017F>econd is le<U+017F>s than the former, <hi>viz.</hi> then that
which pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth into the Duodenum with the
Ductus Biliarius.</p>
            <p>As often as the<U+017F>e two Ducts happen in the
Animals but now cited, for the mo<U+017F>t part they
are conjoyned in the Pancreas; <U+017F>o that the one
being blown up, the other will <U+017F>well; yet we
find them <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tituted in Man, that they are
not joyned together, although both be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the extremity of the Pancreas almo<U+017F>t in
the <U+017F>ame Longitude and Magnitude. A two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Ductus is commonly found in Phea<U+017F>ants,
Peacocks, Gee<U+017F>e, Ducks, and other Animals,
e<U+017F>pecially of the number of Fowls.</p>
            <p>The threefold Ductus, for the mo<U+017F>t part is in
Cocks, Hens, Pigeons and Magpyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When
the Ductus Pancreaticus is <U+017F>ingle, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
joyned with the Ductus Biliarius about
it's In<U+017F>ertion into the Inte<U+017F>tinum, Duodenum,
in Men and Fi<U+017F>hes, as we have above declared;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64159:21"/>
as al<U+017F>o in Cats, in which once we found by the
<U+017F>ide of the Gall-bladder, another little whiti<U+017F>h
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el towards which the Pancreas in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
manner extending it <U+017F>elf, which being
lightly compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, there flowed a certain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Ductus Pancreaticus, like to the
Juyce thereof, both in colour and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance:
But the Bile in the <U+017F>ame Cat retained both it's
natural <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and colour, <U+017F>o that nothing
<U+017F>eem'd to be changed which related to it's natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Con<U+017F>titution.</p>
            <p>The Ductus Pancreaticus, and the Ductus
Biliarius are not joyned together, but enter the
Inte<U+017F>tine in divers places in Hogs, Calves, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and Hares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Ductus Pancreaticus is twofold,
or threefold, <U+017F>ometimes only one of them is
joyned with the Ductus Biliarius, as is evident
in Pyes, and <U+017F>ome other Birds, Sometimes two,
as appears in Peacocks, Gee<U+017F>e, Ducks, Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ants;
and Pigeons, in which now and then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one is joyned to the Ductus Biliarius: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
all three being joyned therewith do pa<U+017F>s
into the Inte<U+017F>tine, as we have <U+017F>ometimes ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in Hens<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing we have already <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>poken of
it's In<U+017F>ertion into the Inte<U+017F>tine, it al<U+017F>o remains
for us to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>omething concerning the place
of In<U+017F>ertion, as more nearly appertaining to our
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. The <hi>Pancreatick Juyce</hi> doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
di<U+017F>charge it <U+017F>elf into the Stomach in
Barbils and Carps; but in other Creatures (for
as much as we have ob<U+017F>erved) it di<U+017F>chargeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64159:22"/>
it <U+017F>elf into the Inte<U+017F>tines, and that in divers
places; for in Men it is performed about four
Fingers breadth, under the Pylorus, and in Birds
about eight Fingers breadth, but in Hares and
Conies, the breadth of fifteen or <U+017F>ixteen Fingers
below the Pylorus.</p>
            <p>Here we would diligently note, that as often
as we name the Ductus Biliarius, we always
thereby under<U+017F>tand the Cy<U+017F>ticus and Hepaticus;
becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e two are always joyned together
about the end, only in Pigeons excepted, which
want the Gall-bladder, and furthermore, are
<U+017F>aid to have no Gall; neverthele<U+017F>s, they have
u<U+017F>ually a threefold Ductus Biliarius, one of
which enters immediately under the Pylorus,
the other two make their entrance into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>tine
at a lower di<U+017F>tance. Where tho<U+017F>e Ducts
enter the Inte<U+017F>tines or the Ventricle, the inner
Tunicle of that part buncheth out, being
wrinckled like a Navel; for which cau<U+017F>e it
more difficultly admits the Stile then the
Ductus Biliarius, which is broader and not <U+017F>o
lax.</p>
            <p>There is no value found throughout the
Ductus Pancreaticus, nor in it's In<U+017F>ertion to
the Ductus Biliarius, as is ra<U+017F>hly and fal<U+017F>ly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <U+017F>ome. And the<U+017F>e few Ob<U+017F>ervations
may be <U+017F>ufficient as concerning the Sy<U+017F>teme of
the Pancreas; and no man ought to think, who
hath ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>o great a variety in it, and <U+017F>o
many notable <U+017F>ports of Nature about it, that
the Pancreas is <U+017F>lightly made; for the Liver,

            <head>CHAP. II. The Opinions of <U+017F>undry Authors concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Office and U<U+017F>e of the Pancreas
examined.</head>
            <p>AS concerning the u<U+017F>e of the Pancreas, it
was not <U+017F>o much accounted of in former
dayes as now it is; for <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> the reverend
light and deity of <U+017F>ome Phy<U+017F>icians gave the
Pancreas no Name, concerning which now a
dayes, <U+017F>o many Opinions are <U+017F>een in Authors:
For <U+017F>ome think it only to <U+017F>erve as a Pillow
placed underneath the Ventricle, or Stomach,
and for the di<U+017F>tribution of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. Others
that it received the Chyle from the Inte<U+017F>tines:
Others imagined that it purged the Excrement
of the Chyle: Others that it were as the Bilar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>icle
of the Spleen: Others, that the thicker
and more unapt purgations of the Blood, were
purged into it by the ordinary cour<U+017F>e of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Others, that this part was made for the
Reception of the Excrement of the Nerves.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64159:23"/>
Finally, others have publickly taught, that the
Humour in the Pancreas was not only u<U+017F>eful, but
highly nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to be under<U+017F>tood.</p>
            <p>The fir<U+017F>t Opinion may be a<U+017F>cribed to the
Ancients, that this part is as a pillow under
the Stomach, and <U+017F>erveth to di<U+017F>tribute the Veins
and Arteries; as <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t ingenious
<hi>Anatomi<U+017F>t</hi> of his time <U+017F>ufficiently affirmes, who
broke forth into the<U+017F>e words about the Fabrick
of Mans body, <hi>Lib. 5. cap. 4. De omento.</hi> 
               <q>This
body in Man (<U+017F>peaking of the Pancreas) is
more white than red, every where attended
by the branches of the Vena porta, Arteries
and Nerves, that their Complications may be
the more firm, being only <U+017F>upported by the
lower Membrane of the Omentum; that it
may be placed under the Stomach like a prop,
or pillow.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But this Opinion is no way probable; <U+017F>eeing
then the Pancreas in Birds, Fi<U+017F>hes, and many
other living Creatures, in which it is otherwi<U+017F>e
<U+017F>cituate then in Men would be u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s; becau<U+017F>e
in tho<U+017F>e it is in no wi<U+017F>e found to be <U+017F>o placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Ventricle, neither doth it admit a pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
to the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, unle<U+017F>s in a very few. But
becau<U+017F>e the Ancients never had a true knowledge
of the Glandules, we mu<U+017F>t not blame them for
not delivering to us the true U<U+017F>e of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd Opinion is attributed to <hi>Baccius</hi>
and <hi>Folius,</hi> both which <U+017F>harply maintained, that
the Chylus pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth from the Inte<U+017F>tines to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and Spleen, through the Ductus Pancreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64159:23"/>
The contrary of which is as clear as the
Meridian Sun: Seeing that nothing is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Gutts into this Ductus, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Juyce <U+017F>ent forth by it <U+017F>elf to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tines.</p>
            <p>The third Opinion is a<U+017F>cribed to <hi>Johan.
Ve<U+017F>lingius;</hi> becau<U+017F>e in his Sy<U+017F>teme of <hi>Anatomy,</hi>
chap. 4. he thus <U+017F>peaketh of the Pancreas: <q>The
u<U+017F>e of this Ductus is not ob<U+017F>cure, for <U+017F>eeing it
hath acertain Juyce not much unlike to the
Bile, it is manife<U+017F>t that <U+017F>uch an Excrement is
<U+017F>eparated from the Chylus by a further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
and being conveyed into this Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, is
thence emitted into the Duodenum.</q> 
               <hi>A<U+017F>ellius,
Riolanus</hi> and others favour this Opinion; but
Experience contradicts it, and manife<U+017F>tly
<U+017F>heweth, that the Humour contained in the
Pancreas is never really in it <U+017F>elf bitter, and
therefore in no wi<U+017F>e to be compared with the
Bile.</p>
            <p>If at any time it happens that the Probe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put into this Ductus be yellow, every one
will ea<U+017F>ily believe, that this is not occa<U+017F>ioned by
the Humour contained in the Pancreas, but
from the Bile, as well flowing from the Ductus
Cy<U+017F>ticus, as the Hepaticus immediately into
the Inte<U+017F>tine; e<U+017F>pecially if he con<U+017F>ider that the
Stylus is <U+017F>potted by the Bile, before it pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth
from the Inte<U+017F>tine to the Ductus Pancreaticus;
and again, that it pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth through the Bile
whil<U+017F>t it is drawn out: For the Ductus Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,
and the Ductus Biliarius in Men perforate
the Inte<U+017F>tine in the <U+017F>ame place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:64159:24"/>
And although the mo<U+017F>t famous <hi>D. Van. Horne,</hi>
in a Bilious Diarhaea <U+017F>aw that Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el full of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
we <U+017F>ay it was Preternatural, in as much as
the Bile, which Copiou<U+017F>ly adhered to the end
of the Ductus (as is wont to happen in a Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haea)
was thrown into the Cavity thereof,
by the Agitation of that dead Body: Al<U+017F>o that
the excrement of the further Elaboration or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of the Chylus, is not <U+017F>ent into this pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age,
is manife<U+017F>t, in regard the <U+017F>ame is witne<U+017F><U+017F>ed
by Occular In<U+017F>pection. In <U+017F>ome Animals, that
Glandulous Body doth not at all touch the
Milky Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; and in others it only pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and in no wi<U+017F>e enters their Sub<U+017F>tance; as
al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e they are ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eparated from the
Pancreas, without the Effu<U+017F>ion of any Chyle,
as we have formerly demon<U+017F>trated in Dogs,
Cats, and other Animals.</p>
            <p>Therefore we do not <U+017F>ee upon what ground
they might maintain the further Concoction
of the Chylus to be celebrated in it, unle<U+017F>s
they following the Opinion of <hi>A<U+017F>ellius,</hi> would
take this Glandulous body for the Middle
Glandule of the Mefentery, into which the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae
Lacteae are altogether immer<U+017F>ed. The
fourth Opinion is of <hi>Bartholinus,</hi> as is manife<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparent from his Anatomy <hi>Chap. 13. De
Pancreate;</hi> where he thinks the Bile to be
purged Naturally by its Ductus, and will have
it to be the Bilar-Ve<U+017F>icle or Gall-Bladder of the
Spleen; <U+017F>o that the <U+017F>ame u<U+017F>e which the other
affords to the Liver, he believes that this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
to the Spleen: Which Opinion (by the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64159:24"/>
leave of <U+017F>o great a man) Anatomy in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<U+017F>eems to confute: Seeing the Ductus
Pancreaticus pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth not to the Spleen;
neither are there any other Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which
do convey any thing from the Spleen to
it: For, there are found only two kinds of
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which carry any thing back from the
Spleen, <hi>viz.</hi> The Veines and Lymphatick Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els:
But the Veines carry back the Blood to
the Liver, and the Complication of the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticks
carrying from the Spleen, do not in
like manner go to the Pancreas, but to the great
Receptacle of the Chyle; <U+017F>o that nothing can
be di<U+017F>charged out of the Spleen to the Pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
as our tryal in <hi>France</hi> hath <U+017F>ufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>ted,
for their <U+017F>akes, who judging this to
be the be<U+017F>t Opinion of mo<U+017F>t Authors, rejected
ours. We tyed a Dog upon a Table, as is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trated
by the fir<U+017F>t Figure of the third Table;
and when we had made a little Hole in the
left Hypocondrium, with our two fore-Fingers
we pull'd out the Spleen, who<U+017F>e Bloody Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els
we tyed with two or three <U+017F>everal Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and afterwards we cut the <U+017F>ame in <U+017F>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
between the Spleen and the Bonds; and
when we had quite taken away the Spleen, we
drew together the Lips of the Wound with
<U+017F>mall threds in three or four <U+017F>everal places,
whereby this Dog, in a<U+017F>hort time, being well
cured, was returned to us, (at which we did
not at all wonder, becau<U+017F>e we once had a Bitch,
which brought forth three or four Puppies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Extirpation of her Spleen); and two
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64159:25"/>
Mouths after the lo<U+017F>s of the Spleen in the <U+017F>ame
Dog, we collected a notable quantity of the
Pancreatick Juice, which the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degave,</hi>
the Doctors of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>trecht,</hi> D. <hi>Haverloo,</hi>
and D. <hi>de Maets,</hi> judged to be acidly Salt:
which being true, none as we think free from
Prejudice, will maintain that the Succus Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaticus
proceeds from the Spleen.</p>
            <p>Al<U+017F>o, it is worthy to be noted, That tho<U+017F>e
Dogs did no le<U+017F>s greedily de<U+017F>ire, or better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>t,
their Food after the Extirpation of the
Spleen, than before; from whence we, receding
from the Common Opinion, judge that no Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
Matter or Humour is <U+017F>ent from the
Spleen to the Stomach.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Opinion is attributed to the mo<U+017F>t
Famous <hi>Lindanus,</hi> <U+017F>eeing that in his <hi>Medic-Phy<U+017F>iol.
c. 5. Art. 5. pag. 114.</hi> he <U+017F>aith, <q>When
I con<U+017F>ider what appertains to the <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g><U+017F>e, be<U+017F>ides the
<U+017F>tructure of the Pancreas; how many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es
Practi<U+017F>e takes notiee of in it, I cannot doubt but
that the thicker, and more u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s Purgations of
the Blood, are thrown out into it, by the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Law of Nature; <U+017F>o as they may be corrected
by the Spleen: and al<U+017F>o by an Extraordinary:
all the Melancholy which either an Intemperate
Diet, or Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e hath bred. The Ductus it <U+017F>elf
gives us cau<U+017F>e to believe, That they are both car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
to the Intestines; and Curation teacheth the
<U+017F>ame by the Medicines often required.</q> And this
Opinion <U+017F>eems al<U+017F>o to us to be contrary to the
Truth, <U+017F>eeing that the Pancreatick Juice, as
often as it hath been truly collected by us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
appeared Limpid like Wine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:64159:25"/>
But what we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay concerning the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
Humour, will <U+017F>ufficiently appear by
the following Article, and al<U+017F>o by tho<U+017F>e things
which <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>poken of pre<U+017F>ently after. The
Sixth Opinion is manife<U+017F>t enough from <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Treati<U+017F>e of the Glandules, <hi>Chap. XIII.</hi>
whil<U+017F>t he writes. <q>Therefore I think that this
Glandule (as likewi<U+017F>e all others) do mini<U+017F>ter to
the Nerves, and that it receives <U+017F>ome of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities
of the Nerves, of the Sixth Paire, with the
little Branches of the Spinal Marrow, in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
folding of the <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nitings; and by its own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el carries it to the Inte<U+017F>tines.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But <U+017F>eeing that the Nerves are de<U+017F>igned to
carry Animal Spirits, we do not under<U+017F>tand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what ground the indu<U+017F>trious Anatomi<U+017F>t will
hold, that the Excrementitious humour is
carryed through them, and wherefore he will
affirm that it is rather carryed into the Pancreas
than into the Spleen, or other parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to which Nerves of the <U+017F>ame Original do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
            <p>Truly the Pancreas is too far from the Brain
to receive its Excrement; moreover, the
Nerves abhor all acrimony, <U+017F>o as to receive
any <U+017F>harper Juice: For which cau<U+017F>e, we judge
this Opinion to <U+017F>tand upon too <U+017F>light a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to be admitted for Truth; and <U+017F>o much
the le<U+017F>s, <U+017F>eeing we could never perceive any
Cavity or Liquour in the Nerves, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
all the diligence we could u<U+017F>e to this
purpo<U+017F>e, the mo<U+017F>t accurate Micro<U+017F>copes have
been of no u<U+017F>e to us, for the di<U+017F>covery of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64159:26"/>
lea<U+017F>t pores in them: We do not here <U+017F>peak of
the di<U+017F>tances which are like Pores, <U+017F>een be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <U+017F>mall Conveyances of the Nerves; but
of the Cavity it <U+017F>elf, of the little Pipes, by which
the<U+017F>e Excrements ought to pa<U+017F>s. Furthermore,
it is proved by Ligatures that no remarkable
quantity of Humour is carryed by the Nerves,
in which there is not the lea<U+017F>t Swelling, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>ide the Ligature which we have ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved,
nor yet by any other that we read
of.</p>
            <p>That which Chyrurgions cry out of the
dropping of the Nerves, we rather a<U+017F>cribe to
the hurt of the Lymphatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, being
nigh to the Nerves, than the hurt of the Nerves
them<U+017F>elves; for which rea<U+017F>on, that we might
have a more certain information, we have
<U+017F>ometimes in Dogs, laid bare that notable Nerve
in the hinder-mo<U+017F>t part of the Legs, and cut it
cro<U+017F>s through the middle, and have put it into
a Vial, being freed from the Lymphatick Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els
(as we u<U+017F>e to do in collecting of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice), the neck of which was <U+017F>o
<U+017F>traightned for this purpo<U+017F>e, as that the Nerves
being cut a<U+017F>under, the Orifice might be well
clo<U+017F>ed by its thickne<U+017F>s, that Spirits, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever
<U+017F>ubtile Matter pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth through the
Nerves, might not vani<U+017F>h into the Aire. We
fixed this Vial to the skin with the Nerve hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down into its Hollowne<U+017F>s, hoping that if
any Liquor did pa<U+017F>s through the Nerves, we
<U+017F>hould by that means attain it, but in vain:
For, in the <U+017F>pace of four or five hours, we got
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64159:26"/>
not the lea<U+017F>t drop; nor did we ob<U+017F>erve that the
Animal Spirits did adhere by Conden<U+017F>ation to
the <U+017F>ides of the Gla<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>Such Birds are to be catcht with more <U+017F>ubtile
nets; which after they are taken, we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to break-fa<U+017F>t withal. Seeing therefore
little or no vi<U+017F>ible matter is carried through the
Nerves, we pray the Propugners of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to tell us, Why Nature in the Pancreas
(as they will have it) hath only formed a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
to receive the Excrements of the Nerves,
which <U+017F>ometimes exceed in Magnitude the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
Nerves them<U+017F>elves, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>mall
Branches often touch the Pancreas. What ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains
to the word Excrement, whereby
they point out our Juice, we think it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for it, if they under<U+017F>tand what<U+017F>oever
is <U+017F>eparated from the Blood, whether good or
evil; but it is in no re<U+017F>pect agreeable to the
Pancreatick Juice, if by the word Excrement
they under<U+017F>tand what<U+017F>oever is carryed from the
Blood to be unprofitable, for Rea<U+017F>ons hereafter
to be declared.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Opinion is a<U+017F><U+017F>igned to the mo<U+017F>t

            <head>CHAP. III. In what manner the Pancreatick Juice
was found out.</head>
            <p>THE Fir<U+017F>t Experiment by which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to collect the Pancreatick Juice
in a living Dog, was a Ligature with which we
tied the upper-part of the Pancreas, together
with the thin Gut; for, by that means, we
hoped that after <U+017F>ome Hours we <U+017F>hould have
found the Pancreatick Duct <U+017F>well'd with Juice,
but in vain: which <U+017F>eemed to our Judgment
to happen by rea<U+017F>on that the Motion of the
Blood being hindered to the Pancreas, the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the Juice from it was prevented al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o.</p>
            <p>The Second Experiment was al<U+017F>o by a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
made about the In<U+017F>ertion of the Ductus
into the Inte<U+017F>tinum Duodenum, but al<U+017F>o in vain.
The Rea<U+017F>on perhaps was the Glandules of the
Pancreas being hurt, by who<U+017F>e Ductus all the
Pancreatick Juice might the more ea<U+017F>ilier have
flown out, by rea<U+017F>on that neither in the great
Ductus nor in the lateral branches is there any
values found.</p>
            <p>The Third Experiment was by two boards or
planks, higher in the middle, than at the ends,
applyed and <U+017F>traightly bound to the Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64159:28"/>
at the ingre<U+017F>s of the Pancreatick Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus;
from whence, after <U+017F>ome hours, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen
being opened again, which before had
been lightly <U+017F>titched up, we found the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Ductus <U+017F>welled with a clear and limpid
Juice; neverthele<U+017F>s, we could not conveniently
either take it out, or ta<U+017F>t it. By which <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s
we being animated the more, re<U+017F>olved a fourth
Tryal, by opening the Inte<U+017F>tinum Duodenum,
according to the Longitude thereof; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
applying a little ve<U+017F><U+017F>el to the Orifice of
the Ductus Pancreaticus, as the fir<U+017F>t Figure of
the following Table <hi>A.</hi> demon<U+017F>trates; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by <U+017F>traightly tying the <U+017F>aid Inte<U+017F>tine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the neck of the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el: <U+017F>o that its Orifice
was diametrically oppo<U+017F>ite to the end of the
Ductus Pancreaticus, not doubting but by this
means we <U+017F>hould gather a rare quantity of the
Pancreatick Juice; but this al<U+017F>o in vain: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, becau<U+017F>e the air included within the
ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, denyed entrance to the Pancreatick Juice,
lightly touching it. Therefore we re<U+017F>olved to
try a Fifth Experiment, with a little ve<U+017F><U+017F>el <U+017F>mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perforated, as the fir<U+017F>t Figure of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Table <U+017F>hews under the letter <hi>B.</hi> By which
advantage, in the <U+017F>pace of five hours, we col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<U+017F>o great a quantity of Liquor, that the
ve<U+017F><U+017F>el was almo<U+017F>t half full; who<U+017F>e contained
Liquor was of a bitter reli<U+017F>h, and of a yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>h
colour; which we judged to happen,
becau<U+017F>e the bile, (by rea<U+017F>on the Inte<U+017F>tine was
not fir<U+017F>t clean<U+017F>ed) was intermixed with the
Succus Pancreaticus. Wherefore, after many
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64159:29"/>
and tire<U+017F>ome vexations of mind, we came to
a Sixth Experiment; which <U+017F>eeing it in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pects
<U+017F>ufficiently an<U+017F>wered our Expectations;
here wee will add its exact de<U+017F>cription for the
<U+017F>ake of the Curious, that they may give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to their proper <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, which in others words
mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ily le<U+017F><U+017F>en the Credit.</p>
            <p>A little Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, with a longer neck, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
as the II. Table under the letter <hi>A.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ents;
in the upper part of who<U+017F>e Belly a
little hole was pierced <hi>B.;</hi> by which the air
included in it, gave way to the Pancreatick
Juice.</p>
            <p>Let the neck of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el be encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ed
with a little cord <hi>C.;</hi> and <U+017F>everall Rings of
Iron, thereunto affixed, or any other conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
thing; by the advantage of which, the
Inte<U+017F>tine may the more ea<U+017F>ily be <U+017F>tretched
up.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, you mu<U+017F>t take a wild Ducks
quill <hi>D.</hi> becau<U+017F>e that kind of bird hath longer
and thinner than all others, which mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
about the larger part thereof with Paper,
a little be<U+017F>meared with boiled Starch, that the
Orifice of the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el <hi>H.</hi> whil<U+017F>t it is included
in it, may be mo<U+017F>t exactly clo<U+017F>ed: le<U+017F>t either
the Bile or Blood, penetrating by the <U+017F>ides of
the quill, defile the Juice collected, or to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el.</p>
            <p>This quill is affixed to the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of the <U+017F>traightne<U+017F>s of the Pancreatick Duct,
which will not admit the neck of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el.
Pre<U+017F>ently you mu<U+017F>t take a little tap or <U+017F>top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64159:29"/>
made of <U+017F>oft Wood, and of <U+017F>uch thickne<U+017F>s
that it may fill up the narrower Orifice <hi>G.</hi>
which with the Alligated thred <hi>K.</hi> by the help
of the Style may be <U+017F>o far protruded through
the larger part of the quill <hi>F.</hi> that a little there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may remain in the larger part of the quill <hi>G.</hi>
and there may <U+017F>tick <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, that it may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of its own accord into the Ductus Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaticus:
becau<U+017F>e then the Pituitous or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miculous
cru<U+017F>ted matter, of the Inte<U+017F>tines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
adhering about the end of the Ductus
being moved, would ea<U+017F>ily cau<U+017F>e it to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructed;
which need not be feared, if the <U+017F>topple
remain in the quill.</p>
            <p>But the Tap is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly to be forced
into the Quill, but that by the help of the
thred it may ea<U+017F>ily be retracted. You have all

As often as we have rightly collected the
Pancreatick Juice, we have found it like clear
Fountain Water, with <U+017F>ome-thing of Vi<U+017F>cidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but not without the a<U+017F><U+017F>ociating of Di<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated

Functions depending upon it, not <U+017F>eldome to
be vitiated, and the <U+017F>ame is evinced by our
Experience; For, we <U+017F>ometimes have found
it mo<U+017F>t gratefully acid, <U+017F>ometimes almo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
<U+017F>ometimes au<U+017F>tere, often times <U+017F>alt, but
mo<U+017F>t often acidly <U+017F>alt.</p>
            <p>Of this our Experience, we cite an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Witne<U+017F>s, the mo<U+017F>t excellent <hi>D. Vander

in their pre<U+017F>ence judged with us, that in <U+017F>uch a
Collection it were both of an au<U+017F>tere, and acidly

            <p>The notable Effect of the Au<U+017F>terity thereof,
then al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erved, we will hereafter declare.
Now having found out the Pancreatick Juice,
that we may clearly and di<U+017F>tinctly <U+017F>ubject the
Generation thereof to your Eyes, we will
propo<U+017F>e a de<U+017F>cription of all the Glandules, by
di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing them with the Famous D. <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
into Conglobated and Conglomerated.
We call them conglobated, which are Con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
as it were, from one continued Sub<U+017F>tance,
having an equal Superifices; <U+017F>uch as in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entery,

Body, many are found.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64159:34"/>
But we call tho<U+017F>e Conglomerated, which
ri<U+017F>e from many le<U+017F><U+017F>er Glandules joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<U+017F>uch are the Pancreas, Salival Ducts,
and many others in the Fauces, No<U+017F>trils; yea
they con<U+017F>titute the Thyme it <U+017F>elf, or Glandule,
under the Channel bone, concerning which we
are willing here to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omewhat of what we
have <U+017F>ome years <U+017F>ince ob<U+017F>erved, whil<U+017F>t we were
Conver<U+017F>ant about the di<U+017F><U+017F>ecting of Calves (in
which this Glandule was found very great, and
that which is mo<U+017F>t worthy of note, no le<U+017F>s in
Calves, than in other Animals, That it is <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly
dimini<U+017F>hed after the Birth) that this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Ductus was found repleat with a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
humor, which we <U+017F>ometime pro<U+017F>ecuted;
but becau<U+017F>e, upon the laying open thereof, the
Liquor did continually Flow out, the intire
Ductus vani<U+017F>hed away before we could enter its
end: For which rea<U+017F>on, we were con<U+017F>trained to
defer its further Enquiry till another occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>That this Di<U+017F>tinction of the Glandules is
not Fained but Real, the following Experiment
doth prove. As well the Conglomerated as
the Conglobated are cloathed with a Coat
or Membrane; which being taken away, and
a certain Liquor immitted, as well through
the Ductus Pancreaticus, as through the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livales;
al<U+017F>o by the Arteries of all the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,
by the help of a Syringe with divers
little pipes fa<U+017F>tned to the <U+017F>ame, contrived by
us, and propo<U+017F>ed in our Treati<U+017F>e concerning
the Organs of men; as <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient to many
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64159:34"/>
things in Generation; and there will be ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by a mo<U+017F>t Elegant Spectacle Conglome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Glandules, receding or parting by cour<U+017F>e
from them<U+017F>elves; e<U+017F>pecially if from hence the
little Membranes, whereby they are connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
be cut with a Knife: Which, in no wi<U+017F>e,
is to be expected from the Conglobated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,
notwith<U+017F>tanding the greate<U+017F>t dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>Be<U+017F>ides the Glandules differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
in relation to their Sub<U+017F>tance: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
in the ordinary cour<U+017F>e of Nature, we
have found a Cavity in the middle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated
Glandules; but not in the Conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated;
which, by that great Expounder
of Nature, and by an indi<U+017F><U+017F>oluble bond of
Friend<U+017F>hip endeared to us, <hi>Nicholas Stenon,</hi>
we have <U+017F>een noted; and ob<U+017F>erved; who in his
Anatomical Ob<U+017F>ervations concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated
Glandules, <U+017F>aith:</p>
            <q>For, outwardly the Conglobated Glandules are
hollow not inwardly like a Ba<U+017F>on, yet if you right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enter the Separation between the protuberating
Lips on every <U+017F>ide, you <U+017F>hall find as it were a
Cleft or Chap, by which go forth certain Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick
Roots returning with the Membrane.</q>
            <p>Their Sub<U+017F>tances differ not only among
them<U+017F>elves by way of Connexion, as they are
Conglobated and Conglomerated, but al<U+017F>o in
the peculiar Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; for, the Conglobated are
given to the Lymphatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and at the Common Ductus Thoraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,

Con<U+017F>picuous in Dogs, drive out a Liquor
prepared in them<U+017F>elves, or received from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But the Conglomerated di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e their
Liquour into peculiar Cavities, as the Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
into the Mouth, the Pancreas into the Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum,
and <U+017F>o of others.</p>
            <p>That the Motion of the Lympha is <U+017F>uch, as
we have even now a<U+017F><U+017F>erted, and not from
the Centre to the Circumference, is proved
by the Values in the Lymphatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-where
exi<U+017F>ting, as may be <U+017F>een in a little
Treati<U+017F>e, concerning the Values of the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, by the mo<U+017F>t Famous, and our

Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1665. by who<U+017F>e Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable

that Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el which he calleth the Bronchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

in<U+017F>erted into his little Book, aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and worthily Communicated to us.</p>
            <p>Seeing that the Duct's, and al<U+017F>o the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances
of the Glandules are diver<U+017F>e, it is
worthy our enquiry, Whether the Humour,
ob<U+017F>erved in all the Glandules, be of the <U+017F>ame,
or a different Quality? But we <U+017F>hall an<U+017F>wer,
That the <U+017F>ame, or like Humour is <U+017F>eparated in
all the Glandules, of a diver<U+017F>e Species; for one
Liquor is depo<U+017F>ed in the Conglobated, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Conglomerated: For, that which is <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
in the Conglobated is all of the <U+017F>ame
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64159:35"/>
Nature: which is proved, not only by the
Sub<U+017F>tance of the <U+017F>ame Glandules, every where
Con<U+017F>imilar, but al<U+017F>o by the wayes by which they
are all di<U+017F>tburdened; for as much, as further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to us, ending in the Ductus Thoracicus.
Moreover, it is further Demon<U+017F>trable, by the
Liquor of the Conglobated Glandules, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
found more Salti<U+017F>h, and le<U+017F>s Acid in
them, than in the Conglomerated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
of the Pancreas; neverthele<U+017F>s more
of Acidity, and Sal<U+017F>itude, than that of the
Conglomerated Salivales. From whence it is
manife<U+017F>t, that a Liquor is <U+017F>eparated from the
Conglomerated Glandules of the Salivales, and
Pancreas not alike in all its Qualities, as we have
a<U+017F><U+017F>erted even now to be done in the Congloba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
in which matter, that we might be more
certain, at the <U+017F>ame time, and to the <U+017F>ame Animal,
we applyed the In<U+017F>trument depicted <hi>Tab.</hi> II.
<hi>Fig.</hi> II. both to the Ductus Pancreaticus, and
to the upper Salivary Duct, as is exhibited
<hi>Tab.</hi> III. <hi>Fig.</hi> II. But we found a notable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ity
of the afore<U+017F>aid Liquors; For, the
Salival is either Temperate or In<U+017F>ipid; but the
Succus Pancreaticus is acidly Salt, or <U+017F>uch like,
for the mo<U+017F>t part, as we have de<U+017F>cribed it in the
former Chapter.</p>
            <p>Seeing there is a diver<U+017F>e Juice of diver<U+017F>e
Glandules, it de<U+017F>erves our enquiry, What u<U+017F>e
every one may have, and whether it be pro<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
or unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary? That is, Whether it
bringeth any Commodity to the Body? Or,
Whether it be <U+017F>uch as is in no wi<U+017F>e Sub<U+017F>ervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64159:36"/>
to the Oeconomy of the Humane Fabrick?
It will not be hard to <U+017F>atisfie this difficulty, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially
if we make a more exact Scrutiny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Motion of tho<U+017F>e Liquors; for <U+017F>eeing
that all the Liquor of the Conglobated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,
is in<U+017F>erted into the Ductus Thoracicus,
and there permixed with the Chyle, the chief
part of Aliments, and with the <U+017F>ame may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and be purged into the Jugular Veine,
or left Subclavian Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el; from whence, being
confu<U+017F>ed with the de<U+017F>cending Blood, nece<U+017F><U+017F>ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth through the right Ear of the Heart,
into its right Ventricle. We do not <U+017F>ee by
what name it may be called Excrementitious
and unprofitable; becau<U+017F>e the Excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Humours are <U+017F>eparated from the Blood:
<U+017F>o that, according to the Order of Nature, they
may not any more be commixed therewith;
but are wholly <U+017F>eparated from the Body;
which is clearly <U+017F>een in the Urine; the
which, being <U+017F>eparated from the ma<U+017F><U+017F>e of
Blood in the Reines, and thence deduced
through the Ureters into the Bladder: from
whence, after <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tay, according to the
Dictate of the Will, by the Urinary pa<U+017F><U+017F>age it
is excluded from the Body; <U+017F>o that it can never
again return.</p>
            <p>So, the Juice of the Conglomerated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,
is effu<U+017F>ed through particular Ducts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
divers Cavities of the Body, where it may
be mingled with other Humours nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for

            <p>The Spittle is <U+017F>eparated from the Blood, in

of the cleanne<U+017F>s of the place, in which we are, we
will not <U+017F>pit out, neither dare we <U+017F>wallow it
down; for the Mouth is very quickly fill'd with
Spittle.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Spittle, although without our
knowledge, is continually <U+017F>wallowed, and
mingled, and confu<U+017F>ed in the <U+017F>tomack with
the Aliment, which truly would be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent,

to the <U+017F>ubclavian Vein, and <U+017F>o for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

which indeed would happen again<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on, if
the <U+017F>aid humours were Excrementitious, and
unprofitable to the oeconomy of the body of
Man.</p>
            <p>To this Opinion, be<U+017F>ides <hi>Sylvius,</hi> agrees <hi>Godofri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Moebius,</hi> who in his Phy<U+017F>iological foundations
of Medicine, <hi>c.</hi> 12. concerning the u<U+017F>e of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tines,
thus <U+017F>peaketh: <q>But this Juice (namely
the Pancreatick) <U+017F>eeing that it may be admixed
with the Chyle, together with the Bile in the
Duodenum, without all doubt it further helps
and promotes its Fermentation: For, if the
pure purged Excrement <U+017F>hould be of no u<U+017F>e,
Nature would have derived that Channel to
the lower Inte<U+017F>tines, wherein hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Excrements are lodged, not to the
Superiour, where the Chyle begun in the
Stomach, ought to be perfected.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing than that by Rea<U+017F>ons and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
already <U+017F>ufficiently inferd, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t,
That the Humours, as well of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated,
as the Conglomerated Glandules,
are not Excrementitious. We think fit, before
we proceed any further, to propo<U+017F>e their Way
or Mode of Generation.</p>
            <p>It hath been, in times pa<U+017F>t, believed by the
Antients, (to <U+017F>ay nothing concerning Faulties,
and other their Figments) that the Glandules
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64159:37"/>
did imbile Superfluous Humidities, like unto
Sponges. But to the Neotericks, it <U+017F>eemed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a more attentive Examination of their
Structure, that this Simillitude was greatly
wide of the Truth; by rea<U+017F>on the Glandules
are not every where open to the Pores, but are
<U+017F>ufficiently cloathed on all <U+017F>ides with a <U+017F>trong
Membrane; &amp; therefore they think that nothing
entreth into the Glandules, unle<U+017F>s it be thither
propelled by the Arteries and Nerves.</p>
            <p>But the Arteries carry the Humours of every
kind to the Glandules, under the Colour of
Blood; every of which, by rea<U+017F>on of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the Pores, even as Seives
do admit <U+017F>uch Particles of the Humours, which
in re<U+017F>pect of their Magnitude, and Figure,
have the greate<U+017F>t Analogy, with the little
Pores; in the mean while excluding others,
which have with them a le<U+017F><U+017F>er Simillitude;
which therefore by the name of Blood, are
con<U+017F>trained to return to the Heart; from
whence, being more exalted in their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age,
they are pre<U+017F>ently driven indi<U+017F>criminately, by
the Pul<U+017F>ifick force thereof, to the Glandules,
and other parts of the Body; but, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
the Particles fitted to the Generation
of the Pancreatick Juice, are no where more
ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eparated than in the Pancreas, no
where more <U+017F>erous than in the Reins, no where
more commodiou<U+017F>ly Bilious than in the Liver;
&amp; <U+017F>o of the re<U+017F>t: Becau<U+017F>e there are <U+017F>ome parts of
the Body which do more commodiou<U+017F>ly receive
this or that Humour into the Pores than others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64159:38"/>
Nature hath therefore invented a <U+017F>ingular
Artifice, whereby it doth <U+017F>o happily ab<U+017F>olve <U+017F>o
diver<U+017F>e a work, in diver<U+017F>e parts of Animals;
which they do le<U+017F>s admire, who diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
with them<U+017F>elves, that the like thing doth
nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily happen in Plants: For, we <U+017F>ee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Plants, po<U+017F>ited in the <U+017F>ame Sand, each to
admit a peculiar Juice; which, neverthele<U+017F>s, is
<U+017F>o Homo-geneous, that it may contain in it
<U+017F>elf diver<U+017F>e Particles, as we <U+017F>ee in Trees, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the Indu<U+017F>try of Gardeners, divers
Fruits do grow; whereas al<U+017F>o divers Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

which by rea<U+017F>on of the different Con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Pores, they admit this, and not
that part of the Liquor or Sap, others being
excluded, which have a le<U+017F><U+017F>er Affinity with their
Pores.</p>
            <p>The which things being equally gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
we may inferre, that the matter fitted to
the generation of the Pancreatick Juice, is
<U+017F>eparated from the Blood by a certain di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition
of the Pancreas; yet not <U+017F>o exactly,
but that it may bring divers other Particles with
it; as occular In<U+017F>pection doth a<U+017F>certain us to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the Reins; in which indeed primarily the
more Serous Particles of the blood, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

which are, as it were, <U+017F>natcht away therewith,
by rea<U+017F>on of them or tho<U+017F>e Particles largely

continually <U+017F>eparated from the Blood,
with which, being joyn'd together by an Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Connexion, they run into the Inte<U+017F>tinum

that our Pancreatick Juice is not <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but compounded of divers; this e<U+017F>pecially,
Acid, Aqueous, Saline, and other Particles
therein found, adjoyned to the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
by who<U+017F>e Volatile Sweetne<U+017F><U+017F>e the force
of Acids is re<U+017F>trained; whence it happens, that
the Pancreatick Juice is Naturally Acidly-Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</p>
            <p>Some may <U+017F>ay, after what manner may
the Pancreatick Juice be Acidly Temperate,
<U+017F>eeing that in the Precedent Chapter we
have <U+017F>aid, that it is very often Acidly-<U+017F>alt,
and naturally may be <U+017F>aid to be <U+017F>uch
as alwayes, or for the mo<U+017F>t part, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
to be? But, we <U+017F>hall An<U+017F>wer, That
perhaps it <U+017F>o happeneth in Dogs onely;
becau<U+017F>e they ought to dige<U+017F>t Bones, and other
things of a harder Concoction, but in Men
we judge there is no <U+017F>uch Sal<U+017F>itude exi<U+017F>tant
or required; Becau<U+017F>e, in Men, that which
is Vomited, is either In<U+017F>ipid, or Bitter, or
Acid, very rarely, and perhaps never Acid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Salt; the which undoubtedly would happen
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64159:39"/>
if their Pancreatick Juice were Naturally
<U+017F>uch.</p>
            <p>But being granted, that in men, likewi<U+017F>e

Whether then will our Hypothe<U+017F>is run? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whither:

            <p>Be<U+017F>ides the Rea<U+017F>ons and Authorities already
brought, we will add the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which after a wonderful manner doth
confirm the natural acidity of the Pancreatick
Juice in Men. In the Year 1666. whil<U+017F>t we
were re<U+017F>ident in the Academy of <hi>Andegave,</hi> a
Shipman, about thirty years of Age; a man
of a good Habit of Body, and for as much as
we could under<U+017F>tand by the Standers by, very
Healthful; in his little Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, endeavouring to
pa<U+017F><U+017F>e under an old Bridge, <U+017F>tanding upon the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64159:41"/>
River <hi>Moene,</hi> with his Ma<U+017F>t erected, was by
the Bridge, unhappily thrown down, which,
falling upon the man, killed him; who<U+017F>e dead
Body was immediately brought to the Ho<U+017F>pital,
where the <U+017F>ame being as yet warm, was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Dr. <hi>Cro<U+017F>nier,</hi> the Chyrurgion of the
<U+017F>ame Ho<U+017F>pital, and our <U+017F>elf; in which we
collected the Succus Pancreaticus, which we
exhibited to diver<U+017F>e curious Ta<U+017F>ts, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to be acid; and for our own part we freely
profe<U+017F>s never to have found it more gratefully
acid in Dogs.</p>
            <p>Who is he, the<U+017F>e things being rightly con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that doubteth of the Efferve<U+017F>cency happening
between the Pancreatick Juice, and the Bile
rightly Con<U+017F>tituted? Yet, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part <U+017F>eem deficient, we will <U+017F>et down, in
few words, tho<U+017F>e Primary Objections and
Difficulties, both here and in other Countries
propo<U+017F>ed to us again<U+017F>t this Efferve<U+017F>cency; the
which being ca<U+017F>t off, doubts of le<U+017F><U+017F>er mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be ready to fall of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p>The fir<U+017F>t Difficulty is, That the Pancreatick
Juice, as often as it hath been found by us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ipid,
hath not in the lea<U+017F>t been able to rai<U+017F>e an
Efferve<U+017F>cency with the Bile in the thin Gut.
To this Objection we an<U+017F>wer, That it doth not
follow, that the Pancreatick Juice, <U+017F>ometimes
found by us In<U+017F>ipid, <U+017F>hould, at that time,
have in it no Acidity. Concerning which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
let them con<U+017F>ult <hi>Galen De Simp. Med.
Fac.</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 13, 14, 15. as al<U+017F>o <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:64159:42"/>
in that place before alledged, <U+017F>aying,
<hi>That in many mixed things, there are Sub<U+017F>tances of
various Qualities by Act, in which, neverthele<U+017F>s,
tho<U+017F>e Sub<U+017F>tances are not <U+017F>ound.</hi> The <U+017F>ame is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by daily Experience, whereby it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that diver<U+017F>e Liquors are rendered in<U+017F>ipid,
who<U+017F>e Effects we allow to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, partly in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,
partly in Lixivious parts; for example,
the Spirit of Salt, which is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>harp, may
be <U+017F>o dulcified with Spirit of Wine, that no
acidity may be perceived in it; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
it failes not to Efferve<U+017F>ce, if it be
permixed with a Lixivious Salt; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
other things, which appear not acid, by
rea<U+017F>on of the Acid Particles which are in them,
do excite Perceptible Efferve<U+017F>cencies both to
the Sight and Touch. But we do not ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
deny, but that the Pancreatick Juice may
be <U+017F>ometimes generated <U+017F>o Sluggi<U+017F>h, as that
it may <U+017F>carcely, indeed not at all ferment with
the Bile; but we then judge it to be di<U+017F>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or Sick. Yea, that tho<U+017F>e Animals in whom
it <U+017F>o happens, do <U+017F>ometimes dye by rea<U+017F>on of
the Non-contingent Efferve<U+017F>cency: But
this doth not de<U+017F>troy the Natural Efferve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p>The Second Difficulty which hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed
to me, is, that <U+017F>eeing our Bile and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice is diluted with the Chyle, they
cannot Efferve<U+017F>ce: But to this Objection we
<U+017F>hall an<U+017F>wer; That Oyle of Vitriol, being
mingled with Pure water, doth <U+017F>tir up a greater
Efferve<U+017F>cency with the fileings of Steele, than
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64159:42"/>
if it were mingled therwith alone without
Water; and which is yet more, if after the
<U+017F>aid Efferve<U+017F>cency hath cea<U+017F>ed, if fre<U+017F>h Water
be added to it, the Oyle of Vitriol, with the
Steele Du<U+017F>t, will ferment again afre<U+017F>h. But that
we might have an Experiment which might
come nearer to our bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, we have taken
Cows Milk, as having a very great Affinity with
the Chyle, and have poured to it Spirit of
Vitriol, mingled with the Lixivious Salt of
Tartar, and the Efferve<U+017F>cency was pre<U+017F>ently
excited, which continued a great deal longer,
than if the Oyle of Vitriol, and Oyle of Tartar
per Deliquium, had been mingled without the
Milk.</p>
            <p>We judge that the long continuance of the
Efferve<U+017F>cency, ought to be a<U+017F>cribed to the Vi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity
of the Milk, <U+017F>eeing that daily Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
teacheth us, that Milk, Honey, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, may be more, and longer rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
whil<U+017F>t boyling, than Di<U+017F>tilled Waters,
Spirits, and other the like things, not having a
Vi<U+017F>cidity.</p>
            <p>According to which, in the <U+017F>aid Experiment,
it is worthy of note, That the Efferve<U+017F>cency
(perhaps by rea<U+017F>on of the Coagulation of the
Milk) doth not <U+017F>o well happen, if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Vitriol be put to the Milk, before the
Oyle of Tartar per Deliquium: Hence
(with the <U+017F>afe Opinion of the more Learned)
a Rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>eems to us to be <U+017F>ought into; why
commonly, in all Animals, the Ductus Biliari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
either fir<U+017F>t, or with the Ductus Pancreaticus,
do enter into the Inte<U+017F>tine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64159:43"/>
From hence may be an<U+017F>wered their Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who <U+017F>ay, That in <U+017F>ome Animals the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
between the Ductus Pancreaticus, and
the Ductus Biliatius is too great: It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary,
that this Efferve<U+017F>cency <U+017F>hould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
happen immediately under the Pylorus;
but the Matter may be carryed <U+017F>ome fingers
breadths further, where at length it may fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
namely, when the Pancreatick Juice,
with the Diluted Bile, is mixed with the
Chyle: becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e Animals, in whom <U+017F>o
notable a Di<U+017F>tance is found, have alwayes
(for as much as we have happened to <U+017F>ee) very
long Inte<U+017F>tines; as may be <U+017F>een in Coines,
Hares, and very many other Animals. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
neither need it be feared, that our deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
Efferve<U+017F>cency, by which the profitable
parts of the Aliment, are <U+017F>eparated from the
unprofitable, <U+017F>hould happen too <U+017F>lowly; <U+017F>eeing
that in tho<U+017F>e Animals <U+017F>ome one Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age or
Channel of the Inte<U+017F>tines, may be over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
<U+017F>ufficient to receive the profitable Particles
of the Chyle.</p>
            <p>The third Thing which we have ob<U+017F>erved is,
That the natural heat of our Hand would more
increa<U+017F>e that Efferve<U+017F>cency, than the artificial
Heat of Fire. After the <U+017F>ame manner we read
in Chymical Books, That the Heat of Hor<U+017F>e
dung performs many things, which could not
be expected from our Artificial Fires, but with
the greate<U+017F>t Difficulty.</p>
            <p>Which <U+017F>eeing it is <U+017F>o, no man ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
that we are not able to Demon<U+017F>trate the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64159:43"/>
Efferve<U+017F>cency, between the Bile and the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice, without our Body, whil<U+017F>t they
remain in their Temperate and Natural E<U+017F>tate;
becau<U+017F>e neither artificial Fire, nor the natural
heat of our Hand, can <U+017F>tir up <U+017F>uch a heat as
we know to be excited in the Small Gut, by
rea<U+017F>on of the Circumjacent Bowels, which are
mo<U+017F>t hot.</p>
            <p>But <U+017F>ome perhaps, being little content with
the<U+017F>e Rea<U+017F>ons, will <U+017F>ay, That to <U+017F>ee that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Efferve<U+017F>cency, it behoveth to open a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Heat is in its Vigour: the which <U+017F>eems to
carry <U+017F>omething of force with it, with tho<U+017F>e
who con<U+017F>ider not that in a Preternatural Di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition
of the Body, we cannot know its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Operation; as al<U+017F>o with tho<U+017F>e who have
never moved their Hand to the Work; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e

(as we have often experienced) to <U+017F>ee the
de<U+017F>ired Efferve<U+017F>cency.</p>
            <p>Add, that the Succus Pancreaticus cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

augmented after the Air is <U+017F>ucked out, and that
there are <U+017F>ome things which in a <U+017F>pace of time,
are intended in the Air to a great Vacuity,
who<U+017F>e action after the air is drawn out, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
extingui<U+017F>hed: So that without rea<U+017F>on
they de<U+017F>ire that the Efferve<U+017F>cency between the
Bile, and the Pancreatick Juyce <U+017F>hould be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>ted
to the Eye without the Body: For it is
plainly ridiculous to be willing to <U+017F>ee the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferve<U+017F>cency
of tho<U+017F>e Humours, and to impede
the Humours by which they are performed; or

which are performed in the Bowels of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>

neverthele<U+017F>s being de<U+017F>titute of Natural helps,

            <p>La<U+017F>tly, The third difficulty which hath been
propo<U+017F>ed to us again<U+017F>t the Efferve<U+017F>cency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Bile and the Pancreatick Juyce, is,
that the Pancreatick Juyce being acidly <U+017F>alt (as
it is ordinarily found in Dogs) ought not to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the Bile: Seeing that the acidite
thereof, by rea<U+017F>on of the Salt therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
helping the innervated Liquor will be <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
            <p>But we may ea<U+017F>ily an<U+017F>wer this Objection al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o,

and others compounded of a Lixiviate-Salt,
and Acid-Spirit, from the pure Lixiviate Salts.
No man will ever deny, but that the la<U+017F>t of
Acids doth lo<U+017F>e its Force and Energy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently
hinders its Efferve<U+017F>cency. But that
which appertaineth to the fir<U+017F>t, of who<U+017F>e Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64159:45"/>

that that in no wi<U+017F>e hindereth the Efferve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
of tho<U+017F>e things, e<U+017F>pecially, which have
an acid Spirit; as for example, that of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol,
in which was di<U+017F><U+017F>olved Sea-Salt, mixed with
the Lixivious Salt of Tartar, or Oyle of Tartar

            <p>Yea it is <U+017F>o far from dimini<U+017F>hing the Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>cency,
that it exciteth a greater than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e

it, that it di<U+017F><U+017F>olveth Gold, the which without
it could not be done. Hence perhaps it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

thereof; neither de<U+017F>troyes its Efferve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
which we have taught to be made
in the Thin Gut, without any Interruption.</p>
            <p>But we have <U+017F>ometimes ob<U+017F>erved a plea<U+017F>ant

But that we may come nearer to the matter,
we will declare the Experiments brought by

               <p>Therefore (<hi><U+017F>aith he</hi>) the Abdomen of a Living

Sick, and in the Sound; and what
Benefit Accrews to the Body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</head>
            <p>SEeing then that it is more than <U+017F>ufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
and granted by Rea<U+017F>ons and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
that there is an Efferve<U+017F>cency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Bile and the Pancreatick Juice, in
the Thin Gutt, and that continually, we will
further enquire, what it is in the Sick, what
in the Sound, and what Utility it bringeth to
Humane Bodies.</p>
            <p>In the Sick, we often ob<U+017F>erve, That this
Efferve<U+017F>cency, either by its Fretting, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Paines, or el<U+017F>e by Heat or Cold, is
very trouble<U+017F>ome, as <U+017F>ome Years <U+017F>ince, we
knew in our dear Kin<U+017F>man; who <U+017F>ometimes,
for a whole week together, came him<U+017F>elf to
us, to perceive a cold Ebullition in his Right
<U+017F>ide, and that in the place where the Inte<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Duodenum is <U+017F>eated; and the Bile runs
together with the Pancreatick Juice; and that
afterwards, by the meanes of Medicaments,
meanly hot, to be changed into mo<U+017F>t hot, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
a Fortnight, and longer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64159:47"/>
That both the<U+017F>e Efferve<U+017F>cencies, <hi>viz.</hi> Cold
and Hot, may be excited, is proved by the
Thermometry, mo<U+017F>t ingenuou<U+017F>ly contrived by
the Learned <hi>Swammerdammius,</hi> and depicted in
his Treati<U+017F>e of Re<U+017F>piration, <hi>Page</hi> 108. In the
depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed part of which Supream Sphear <hi>A.</hi> if
you mingle together Salt of Tartar, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Vitriol, an Efferve<U+017F>cency will pre<U+017F>ently
be excited; and <U+017F>uch indeed as will <U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<U+017F>e,
or thicken the Air contained in that
Spheare, that the Water, contained in the
lower part of this In<U+017F>trument <hi>B,</hi> may a<U+017F>cend
upward: being a manife<U+017F>t Experiment of Cold,
produced by that Efferve<U+017F>cency. But, on the
contrary, if you mingle Spirit of Tartar with the
Spirit of Vitriol, you <U+017F>hall ob<U+017F>erve, by the
Efferve<U+017F>cency excited between them, that the
Water is depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; and the more if with tho<U+017F>e
Spirits, you conjyne the Oyle of Turpentine;
from whence no man, who is endowed with
the lighte<U+017F>t Tincture of Philo<U+017F>ophy, but
will judge, that to proceed from the hot Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferve<U+017F>cency,
rarifying the Air contained in that
Sphear.</p>
            <p>Therefore we judge, that in the Sound, that
Efferve<U+017F>cency happens after a gentle manner,
becau<U+017F>e then there is no Sence thereof: The
<U+017F>ame thing is to be <U+017F>aid concerning the Motion
of the Heart, and beating of the Arteries;
the which, although they are Continual, are not
perceived by tho<U+017F>e in Health; but when we are
evilly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, they <U+017F>ometimes manife<U+017F>t them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
in diver<U+017F>e parts of the Body, e<U+017F>pecially
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64159:47"/>
in Temples, the Pul<U+017F>ation of the Arteries is <U+017F>o
manife<U+017F>tly mole<U+017F>ted, as if they were contu<U+017F>ed by
<U+017F>ome hard body. By the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>on the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Heart, is <U+017F>ometime <U+017F>o vehement, that as
it hath been ob<U+017F>erved by Practitioners, it might
in a manner be heard to their
Neighbour Hou<U+017F>es;<note place="margin">Surely this is an Hyperbole.</note> yea it hath
<U+017F>ometimes broke the Ribs; as
in like manner, we have <U+017F>een at
<hi>Leyden,</hi> in a Baker's Son, dwelling in the Fi<U+017F>h-Market;
who<U+017F>e Ribs, by the Vehement Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation
of the Heart, or rather the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive
Motion thereof, were Con<U+017F>picuou<U+017F>ly dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
outwards; from which Vehement Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
it was freed in a <U+017F>hort time with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,
pre<U+017F>cribed by Dr. <hi>Sylvius;</hi> yet
not <U+017F>o, but that the Ribs <U+017F>till remained driven
outwards.</p>
            <p>But now if any ask unto what end and u<U+017F>e
this Efferve<U+017F>cency between the Bile and the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce, being naturally excited, doth
happen? We an<U+017F>wer fir<U+017F>t of all, that it <U+017F>erves

adhering to the <U+017F>ides of the Gutts, left they
being <U+017F>tufft up, the pores of the <hi>Venae Lactea</hi>

               <p>For that cau<U+017F>e therefore Nature hath from
the beginning provided a Defence for them,
that this Juyce being <U+017F>harp, might be clean<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as it ought be altogether <U+017F>eparated
from the body, not into any Inte<U+017F>tine near the
Anus; but into the fir<U+017F>t Inte<U+017F>tine taking its
beginning from the Pylorus, neither <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
may it want the external Help of <U+017F>ome
of the inferiour Inte<U+017F>tines. Moreover, as
long as the body is rightly governed, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous
Excrement is daily clean<U+017F>ed. But
when it is more copiou<U+017F>ly collected by <U+017F>ome

grievous Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es which happen to the belly,

be occa<U+017F>ioned by it. Neither therefore is

            </q>
            <p>The <U+017F>ame Office is no le<U+017F>s to be a<U+017F>cribed to the
Pancreatick Juyce, then to the Bile hereafter
to be made con<U+017F>picuous by the De<U+017F>cription of its
acid Qualities. Before we go any further in
declaring the Effects ari<U+017F>ing from this Efferve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
we will premi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome Fermentations,
that the<U+017F>e things being with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pected,
it may become the more obvious,
what benefit the Inte<U+017F>tinal Efferve<U+017F>cency bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Aliments after their propul<U+017F>ion to the
Gutts.</p>
            <p>As many as have mingled filings of Steel with
Oyl of Sulpher, prepared Per Campanum, or
Spirit of Vitriol, having added a <U+017F>ufficient
quantity of water, they might ob<U+017F>erve an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferve<U+017F>cency
to be excited after a certain manner
by the concour<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e contraries; by help
whereof, the laudable parts of the Steel are
joyned to the acid Spirits, whil<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as refu<U+017F>e, do partly go to the bottome, and
partly like Froth <U+017F>wim or flote upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
            <p>But I think that the more purer parts of the
Steel, and tho<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t exactly mixed, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
joyned to the acid Liquor, becau<U+017F>e they
have therewith a more greater affinity, becau<U+017F>e
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64159:49"/>
of which they <U+017F>uffer them<U+017F>elves to be di<U+017F><U+017F>olved;
but not the other more Impure and le<U+017F>s mixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, whether they be more Terrene, and
therefore <U+017F>eek the bottome, or whether they
they be more Oleus, and therefore Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>ame, greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er, Affinity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
with the di<U+017F><U+017F>olved Matter, doth further
appear, if in the <U+017F>ame Liquor more Mettals
be <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ively immitted; Fir<U+017F>t, tho<U+017F>e which
have a le<U+017F><U+017F>e; afterwards, tho<U+017F>e which have a
greater Affinity with it: So, when Silver is put
into Aqua-Fortis, and <U+017F>o long detained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
till it be all di<U+017F><U+017F>olved; which Efferve<U+017F>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
is ab<U+017F>olved with its Coagent: hence let
Copper be put to the afore-<U+017F>aid Solution, the
Aqua-Fortis will leave the Silver, and begin a
new Efferve<U+017F>cency with the Copper, whil<U+017F>t
that the Silver, being gradually neglected by
the Aqua-Fortis, gets to the bottome; which
Mutation, by the Chymi<U+017F>ts, is called by the name
of Precipitation.</p>
            <p>But if afterwards, you ca<U+017F>t Iron to this Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Copper, the <U+017F>ame thing will again
come to pa<U+017F>s, and by degrees the Copper will be
precipitated to the bottom. Which if again,
to the Solution of the Iron, you affu<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome
Lixivium of Calcind Tartar, Vine A<U+017F>hes, or
the like, the Acid Spirit will joyne it <U+017F>elf
more <U+017F>trictly to the Solution of that, than of
the other Mettalick bodies, and will <U+017F>carcely
<U+017F>uffer it <U+017F>elf to be <U+017F>eparated from the <U+017F>ame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64159:49"/>
The Rea<U+017F>on of this more <U+017F>traight Union is
to be required from the more pure Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that is le<U+017F>s mixed, and therefore more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
joynes it <U+017F>elf with the <U+017F>aid Lixiviate fixed
Salt, hitherto al<U+017F>o more pure and le<U+017F>s mixed,
than with the <U+017F>ame Salt; but le<U+017F>s pure, that is
more mixed: So that, here the purity of the
contrary Parts ought to be under<U+017F>tood by their
Affinity.</p>
            <p>By rea<U+017F>on of this greater Affinity, the Oyle
of Tartar prepared per Deliquium, (which is
nothing el<U+017F>e but the Salt of Tartar, di<U+017F><U+017F>olved
by the Humidity of Air) when it is in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
poured with the Vitriol into Water, it joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
it <U+017F>elf to the acid Spirit, exi<U+017F>ting in the
Vitriol, whil<U+017F>t its Sulphureous part, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a le<U+017F><U+017F>er Affinity with Acidity, by little
and little departs, and gets to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
            <p>Which being permi<U+017F>ed we will con<U+017F>ider,
what things may happen in the Aliments in the
Stomach by its Fermentation, and what al<U+017F>o
befalleth the <U+017F>ame; (after the aforementioned
Fermentation) in the thin Gut e<U+017F>pecially, that
we may conclude <U+017F>omething more certain, and
more probable than u<U+017F>ual. Fir<U+017F>t, The Stomach,
being opened, together with the Guts, <U+017F>eeing
that the Aliments, by an ab<U+017F>olute Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are wont to be driven from the Stomach
to the Inte<U+017F>tines, we have ob<U+017F>erved a notable
Change between that which is contained in the
Stomach, and that in the Guts: For, that in
the Stomach hath had a more gro<U+017F><U+017F>er, and Vi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64159:50"/>
Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, and by the Diver<U+017F>ity of the
Aliments, and other things a<U+017F><U+017F>umed, a diver<U+017F>e
Colour, and oftentimes le<U+017F>s White.</p>
            <p>Certainly, this Mutation cannot be derived
from any other thing than from the Bile, and
Pancreatick Juice: Becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e Humours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flow in a large Quantity to the Superiour
part of the <U+017F>mall Gut, and are admixed with the
Aliments.</p>
            <p>The Examen of both the afore-<U+017F>aid Liquors,
doth confirm this our Opinion: For, the Bile,
abounding with a Volatile Salt and Oyle, hath
a force of Inciding, Attenuating, and making
Fluid mo<U+017F>t things where-with it is permixed,
e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch as are pituitous; as <hi>Galen</hi> al<U+017F>o

            <q>
               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, he declares that Aqua Mul<U+017F>a, or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromel,
or if to clean<U+017F>e more powerfully, with the
Decoction, or bitter Juice before-mentioned,
of Worm-Wood, Centaury, or Lupines, that may
be effected, adding Honey or Gall, which, above
all other things, as hath been often <U+017F>aid doth

and Pituitous Vi<U+017F>cidity; we <U+017F>hall only <U+017F>ay
that in our Judgement it <U+017F>o happeneth; for as
much, as by the Tenuity, and Sharpne<U+017F>s of
the Parts, <U+017F>tirred up by the Efferve<U+017F>cency, the
Phlegme is thereby as with Swords, incided,
and attenuated into very Minute Parts. That
which attaineth a Whiti<U+017F>h Colour, then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervable
in the more Fluid part of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we think it deducible from the Acidity
of the Pancreatick Juice; becau<U+017F>e we may
note, that many other things, abounding with
a Lixivious Salt and Oyle, do wax White upon
the affu<U+017F>ion of Acids: So, that Vinegar or
Sharp Wine, being poured upon common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
di<U+017F><U+017F>olved with any Lixivium, and grown
Red, that Reddi<U+017F>h Colour is <U+017F>o changed, that
it is made almo<U+017F>t like to Milk: Wherefore al<U+017F>o
it is called by the Chymi<U+017F>ts <hi>Lac Sulphuris.</hi>
The <U+017F>ame is apparent in the Re<U+017F>inious Extracts
of Vegitables, as al<U+017F>o in Spirit of Hart's Horne
or Soot, being Replete with much Volatile
Salt; with which an Acid Spirit being mixed,
acquires a Milky Colour. All tho<U+017F>e things
being rightly con<U+017F>idered, we judge, <hi>Secondly,</hi>
That the Efferve<U+017F>cency, in the thin Gut is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the right Separation of
the profitable Parts from the unprofitable. But

perhaps <U+017F>ome, who are altogether wedded to
Antiquity, admitting nothing which to them
is Novel, becau<U+017F>e they have read or under<U+017F>tood
nothing, in the Antients, concerning this our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Secretion, by Fermentation, will not
think that <U+017F>uch a preparation is required to <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
the profitable parts of the Aliment from
the unprofitable; but that the alteration which
is performed in the Stomach, is <U+017F>ufficient to
this purpo<U+017F>e; in which, if any thing be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
it may be Con<U+017F>ummated by the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>taltick
Motion of the Guts; by the help
whereof its more Fluid parts are thru<U+017F>t for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

            <p>To the which we deny not, but that <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is contributed to this matter both by
the <U+017F>aid Fermentation and the Peri<U+017F>taltick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Guts; neverthele<U+017F>s we do not
think that any Phy<U+017F>itian, unle<U+017F>s a Slave

are daily ob<U+017F>erved in the di<U+017F><U+017F>ecting of Brute A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,

<U+017F>ometimes mixed with a whiti<U+017F>h Liquor are
purged out.</p>
            <p>But this Diver<U+017F>ity of Colour happens, by a
Contingent, or Non-contingent, Secretion of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64159:51"/>
profitable parts from the unprofitable, by the <U+017F>aid
Efferve<U+017F>cency; which, who can but in vain, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion alone.</p>
            <p>Yet we deny not, that by the Fermentation
of Aliments alone, rightly performed in the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle,
<U+017F>omething Fluid may, Spontaneou<U+017F>ly, pa<U+017F>s
away from the re<U+017F>t of the Aliments more Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious;
neverthele<U+017F>s that is but little, if it be
compared with the large quantity of noble
Chyle, which is continually <U+017F>trained through
the Venae-lacteae, or al<U+017F>o from thence <U+017F>wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up in the Caeliack Flux; <U+017F>o that, then
the more watery part of the Chyle, freely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

is more without Efferve<U+017F>cency, than the
other which is more white, or, as we may <U+017F>ay,
more Milky.</p>
            <p>In that Spontaneous Separation of the parts
wont to happen through Fermentation, the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

for the Reparation of the Animal <U+017F>pirits:
We have an example in the Fermentation of
Plants, &amp; other things, abounding with a Volatile
Spirit, in which the Spirituous Particles, alwayes
expanded, and endeavouring to flee through
the Pores of the Stomach and Guts, being loo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from their Fetters, ru<U+017F>h through the Pores:
From whence we are fully per<U+017F>waded, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

a <U+017F>uddain <U+017F>trength is found in men;
and although it be Incon<U+017F>picuous to our Bodily
Eyes, that the Spirits, by the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, are
diffu<U+017F>ed through the Pores of the Body; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64159:52"/>
after a manner, we under<U+017F>tand it
with the Eyes of our Mind, whil<U+017F>t we <U+017F>ee a
Stupendious Vertue in <U+017F>ome Medicaments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
applyed: The <U+017F>ame thing is often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
by Anatomi<U+017F>ts, when after the Inci<U+017F>ion

            <p>But becau<U+017F>e the Spirituous and Volatile parts
are not <U+017F>ufficient to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain Life; but, More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
Acid, Oleous, and Salt parts, are al<U+017F>o

            <p>We do not only judge by that Efferve<U+017F>cency<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
mediateing the more Subtile and Fluid parts of
Aliments, but al<U+017F>o the Pituity by the help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in the thin Gut, part of which is
carryed together, with the better Portion of
the Bile, and Succus Pancreaticus, through
the Vermiculous cru<U+017F>t of the Inte<U+017F>tines into the
Milky Veines; from hence to the Ci<U+017F>terne or
Common Receptacle of the Chyle, and Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,
placed in the Region of the Loynes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

from thence a<U+017F>cends through the Chyliferus, or
more rightly the Lymphatick Ductus, Thoraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
(becau<U+017F>e it continually carryeth the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,
and the Chyle, only by Intervals) to the
Subclavian, or left Jugular Veine, that from
thence it may de<U+017F>cend, with the Blood, through
the Superiour Trunck of the Vena Cava, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cending
into the right Eare of the Heart, and
the right Ventricle thereof. And in the right
Ear, and right Ventricle of the Heart, it is
confu<U+017F>ed both with the a<U+017F>cending and de<U+017F>cend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Blood, and al<U+017F>o impregnated with the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice, the Bile, Phlegme, and Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha;
from whence it acquires a requi<U+017F>ite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tency
of Blood.</p>
            <p>This confirms what we have <U+017F>aid; That
any thing acid Coagulates all Fatne<U+017F>s and
Oyle.</p>
            <p>But becau<U+017F>e, on the other <U+017F>ide, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid
humours have in them<U+017F>elves a force of
attempering, we need not fear too great a
Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency of the Blood; <U+017F>o long, as at lea<U+017F>t
they remain in a Laudable and Natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tate.</p>
            <p>But <U+017F>eeing that the more fluid and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
parts, as well of the Aliments a<U+017F><U+017F>umed,
as of the three nominated Humours, do go to
the Heart; the re<U+017F>t more gro<U+017F>s, and le<U+017F>s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
by the Peri<U+017F>taltick Motion of the Guts,
gradually without Sen<U+017F>e, are driven forwards
to the thick Guts, where they are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed
by the name of Alvinary Foeces. Whether al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o
the Exhalations, excited by this Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>cency,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64159:53"/>
or even the Juice it <U+017F>elf may not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
a natural Fermentation in the Stomach,
we dare not as yet a<U+017F><U+017F>ert; although <U+017F>ome Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
<U+017F>eem to per<U+017F>wade it to us, of both who<U+017F>e
Ducts, to wit, the Pancreatick and Bilar, Nature
hath determined a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age into the Stomach.
We judge this Pancreatick Juice is not onely
Sub<U+017F>ervient to the Functions, already declared,
but al<U+017F>o by the Sub-acid Spirit with which it
is impregnated by the mo<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>e God, we
think it to be ordained after a certain manner,
to Incra<U+017F><U+017F>ate, and In<U+017F>pifate the more fluid
Bile, and al<U+017F>o to temper its too much Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
This thing is manife<U+017F>t in the Bile by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ing
any acid Spirits thereto, which pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
either more or le<U+017F>s, will be thickned, and
its more gro<U+017F>s part precipitated to the bottom,
whil<U+017F>t its Thinner part floats on the top like
Phlegme. Hence peradventure <hi>Hippocrates,
Lib. De Victu Accutorum,</hi> Text 29. 8. 9. teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that bitter things are di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, and pa<U+017F>s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Phlegme, that is, They become <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>h whiles
they are <U+017F>pread or mixed with an acid, which
is not only confirmed by the Authority of the
Divine old Gentleman, but al<U+017F>o by a daily Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferve<U+017F>cency;
whereby it is evident that Acids,
and Salts, being put into a Conflict among<U+017F>t
them<U+017F>elves, do <U+017F>o infringe their <U+017F>harp Particles,
that they become almo<U+017F>t temperate: Wherefore
not without Rea<U+017F>on <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> I. Sect. VI.
hath taught us in the daily Levities of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>tines,
That if an Acid belching <U+017F>hould <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervene,
which had not been before, we ought
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64159:53"/>
to hope well: For it is a <U+017F>igne that the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juice, by its acidy, will, in a <U+017F>hort time, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
the Acrimony of the Bile.</p>
            <p>We have <U+017F>aid that the Pancreatick Juice is
ordained by Nature, after a <U+017F>ort to incra<U+017F><U+017F>ate
the more Fluid Bile; but it may al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o happen
that the Bile, by its Acidity, may be rendered
more Fluid, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Vi<U+017F>cidity of the
Bile dependeth upon the Vi<U+017F>cidity of Phlegme;
therefore in one re<U+017F>pect Acids may render the
bile more gro<U+017F>s, but in another more Fluid;
for Acids do incra<U+017F><U+017F>ate Fats, and Lixivious Salts.</p>
            <p>Among tho<U+017F>e things which we have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
it is <U+017F>ufficiently evident, in the Humours
naturally con<U+017F>tituted in the <U+017F>mall Gut, and the
Friendly Efferve<U+017F>cency of Nature from thence
occurring, that many Functions in the Body are
rightly performed; which by the <U+017F>aid Efferve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
evilly happening, are wa<U+017F>ted, and become
Vitious. The verity of which thing, that we
may make it more clearly appear, we <U+017F>hall, fir<U+017F>t
of all, declare <U+017F>ome Vices which happen in the

<U+017F>everal Phi<U+017F>itians, and Anatomi<U+017F>ts. <hi>Riolanus,
Anthropog. Lib. 2. Cap. 10.</hi> writeth, that he
had ob<U+017F>erved in many people, who were of a
Melancholy Nature, and Habit of Body, that
the Pancreas equalled the weight of the Liver;
and al<U+017F>o confirms the <U+017F>ame, by the Example of
the mo<U+017F>t Illu<U+017F>trious Augu<U+017F>tinus Thuanus; <q>Who,
by the Melancholy Habit of Body, did complain
for four Years together of a Collick Pain, about
the Region of the Colon, with a Sen<U+017F>e of a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
or Weight, at his Stomach, while he <U+017F>tood
upright, or walked: But his Hypoconders did
not <U+017F>well: At length being taken with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt-for
Gangreen, from his right Foot <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
to the Superiour parts with Horrible and
Direful Pains, in the <U+017F>pace of Six Hours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.
His Body being opened, and the Liver
taken out, was round like to a Sphare, <U+017F>tuffe
with Fat, and tran<U+017F>-fixed with a certain pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
hardned Matter like to Mortar: But the
Pancreas, by its Amplitude and Weight, did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize
the Liver, wholly Schirhous with many
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64159:55"/>
little Knobs, which were filled with the Species of
a Pigeons Egg; the Spleen was <U+017F>o wa<U+017F>ted that it
<U+017F>carce weighed an Ounce.</q>

            <p>For which rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>ome have called the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas,
the Vicar or Supply of the Spleen; not
con<U+017F>idering that this Diver<U+017F>ity might happen to
other parts al<U+017F>o; and likewi<U+017F>e in Doggs, after
the Extirpation of the Spleen, the Sub<U+017F>tance of
the Pancreas did in no wi<U+017F>e grow into a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
weight; which, according to them, ought to
happen, if the Pancreas <U+017F>upplyed the Office of
the Spleen.</p>

Anatomi<U+017F>t, by him before ob<U+017F>erved:</p>
            <p>A Noble Man, aged about thirty, being
Melancholy, was Obnoxious to Catthars, by
the intemperate u<U+017F>e of Wine, and Fruits; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

whereby after <U+017F>ome <U+017F>pace, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a Flux of Blood; from whence, more
and more failing in Strength, the Tenth day
he Changed Life with Death. His body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
opened, he found in the Pancreas, about
the end of the Ductus Pancreaticus going into
the Inte<U+017F>tines, <U+017F>even or eight Stones, having
the bigne<U+017F>s of the large<U+017F>t Pea<U+017F>e; <U+017F>ome of which
being given us by him<U+017F>elf, we keep among our

            <p>Neverthele<U+017F>s, this Ob<U+017F>ervation to us, <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not <U+017F>o wonderful, who believe that Stones
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64159:57"/>
are generated in all the Glandules of the Body,
e<U+017F>pecially in the pineal Glandule: becau<U+017F>e in

Stones in men, extingui<U+017F>hed either by a gentle
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, or a violent Death; which thing
happens more frequently in <hi>France,</hi> than in
<hi>Holland;</hi> a more profitable account whereof,
we do not <U+017F>ee, than that the Anima of the
<hi>French,</hi> as by Nature more Volatile, may be
bound to a more firm Re<U+017F>idence in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>We have al<U+017F>o found in a certain Dog, in
that part of the Ductus Pancreaticus, where
the A<U+017F>cending concurs with the De<U+017F>cending,
and is only <U+017F>imple; a Cartilagineous Excre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
about the Ductus and its end, which
like a Nipple, did hang out into the Inte<U+017F>tine,
to the bigne<U+017F>s of a Finger, in the middle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a <U+017F>ufficient pa<U+017F><U+017F>age was afforded to the <U+017F>lid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the whole Pancreas hardned like a Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.</p>
            <p>We might be able to inferr many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es
of the Pancreas, were it not already <U+017F>ufficiently
evident by what hath been <U+017F>aid, That the Pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
al<U+017F>o may be afflicted with common Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es;
neither that its evil Con<U+017F>titution followeth the
affections of the Liver or Spleen: For, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the other Bowels being unhurt, the
Pancreas alone, hath been the cau<U+017F>e of Death,

For which rea<U+017F>on, it is manife<U+017F>t that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas
is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to Life, which is al<U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by an Experiment made by us at <hi>Paris,</hi>
in the Year 1667. when in the Hou<U+017F>e of Dr.
<hi>Bourdelot,</hi> where, every Monday, the mo<U+017F>t
Curious of Phy<U+017F>itians and Phylo<U+017F>ophers did

live no le<U+017F>s without the Pancreas, than the
Spleen: For which cau<U+017F>e, before all that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
we extirpated the Spleen, and al<U+017F>o mo<U+017F>t
exactly the Pancreas, of a certain Dog: The
Abdomen again being clo<U+017F>ed, Dr. <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi>
commanded his Servants to keep the
Dog mo<U+017F>t diligently, who, notwith<U+017F>tanding
all their Dilligence, in a <U+017F>hort time Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Tho<U+017F>e Vices being declared, which <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
befall the Sub<U+017F>tance of the Pancreas, we
<U+017F>hall proceed to tho<U+017F>e things which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to its juice; from whence, not a few Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Functions depending upon its Natural
Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, are wa<U+017F>ted and hurt. Fir<U+017F>t of all;
The Pancreatick Juice offendeth when it is
more <U+017F>paringly effu<U+017F>ed into the thin Gut, which
<U+017F>ometimes comes to pa<U+017F>s by the more <U+017F>paring
Generation, or Separation thereof in the
Pancreas; or when there is an Ob<U+017F>truction
in one or more of its lateral Branches; becau<U+017F>e,
for a time the Juice is therein <U+017F>tagnated, till at
length the Ob<U+017F>truction is opened.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:64159:58"/>
It is more <U+017F>paringly generated, when the
Matter thereof is more or le<U+017F>s deficient in the
blood, and not being re<U+017F>tored with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Aliments; or when the <U+017F>ame is carryed
off another way; or when it is more <U+017F>trictly
conjoyned with the blood, that it cannot be <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<U+017F>eparated from it. One or more of
the Ducts of the Pancreas are ob<U+017F>tructed by a
pituitous, and vi<U+017F>cid Matter, together with the
Matter of the Pancreatick Juice, <U+017F>eparated in
the Pancreas, and tran<U+017F>lated into, and detained in
tho<U+017F>e Ducts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Pancreatick Juyce doth al<U+017F>o
offend, when it is carryed into the Inte<U+017F>tines
in greater plenty, whether it be generated
more Copiou<U+017F>ly, or for a time being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by Stagnation, in one or more of
the Laterall Ducts, is then more plentifully
Effu<U+017F>ed, when the Ob<U+017F>truction is Di<U+017F><U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>It is generated more plentifully by rea<U+017F>on of
the Liberal u<U+017F>e of acid Aliments, or at lea<U+017F>t
of Condited Acids; for example, <U+017F>oure Wine,
Vinegar, Pomecitrons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as al<U+017F>o, by rea<U+017F>on
of <U+017F>ome Vice of the Glandules, by which the
Separation of that juice, from the blood is
promoted; as al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>ometimes perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
of more larger Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els tending into the
Pancreas, and as is u<U+017F>ual, affording a larger
Matter to the juyce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When it flows inequally into the
thin Gut, that is, at one time more abundantly,
at another more <U+017F>paringly: Which, fir<U+017F>t of all,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64159:58"/>
pens by an Ob<U+017F>truction of one or more of the
Lateral Ducts, which continuing, nothing
floweth out from them; and therefore a
more <U+017F>paring juyce is then effu<U+017F>ed into the
whole:</p>
            <p>By the <U+017F>aid Ob<U+017F>truction, any way removed,
pre<U+017F>ently that which was <U+017F>tagnant in the middle
Duct, together with the re<U+017F>t of the juice, is
effu<U+017F>ed into the thin Gut; from whence, on the
contrary, the Excretion of the Pancreatick juice
is then more plentiful.</p>
            <p>That <U+017F>uch an Ob<U+017F>truction may <U+017F>ometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the Lateral Ducts of the Pancreas, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
doth per<U+017F>wade, and Experience it <U+017F>elf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
even as we <U+017F>hall more clearly evince
in the following Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It offendeth when it is more Fluid
and Liquid, than Natural: which happeneth by
rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>uch blood, or animal Spirits, more
Copiou<U+017F>ly mixed there-with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It offendeth, when on the contrary
it is more Vi<U+017F>cid; by rea<U+017F>on of the Blood,
likewi<U+017F>e Vi<U+017F>cid, and abounding with much pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The <U+017F>aid Pancreatick juyce of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends;
when the Natural Reli<U+017F>h thereof is
changed:</p>
            <p>Whence it is one while le<U+017F>s acid, another
while more acid; one while <U+017F>alt, another while
au<U+017F>tere; <U+017F>ometimes of a <U+017F>imple Ta<U+017F>t, or el<U+017F>e
Compounded of tho<U+017F>e before-named.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:64159:59"/>
The Nominated Juice is le<U+017F>s acid, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau<U+017F>e
of the animal Spirits, more plentifully
carried to the Pancreas, or for want of acidity
in the Blood; whether it may come to pa<U+017F>s, by
rea<U+017F>on of a<U+017F><U+017F>uming things unfit to repair the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity
taken away, or by the u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>uch things
as infringe, concentrate, obtund, or extingui<U+017F>h
acidity.</p>
            <p>The acidity of the Pancreatick Juice aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
for the mo<U+017F>t part, is to be a<U+017F>cribed
to the Redundancy of acid Humours in the
Body; <U+017F>ometimes to the Impedited Afflux
of the Animal Spirits to the Pancreas; at
lea<U+017F>t-wi<U+017F>e, to that part of the Juyce which is
<U+017F>tagnant in the Lateral Ducts; or other-wi<U+017F>e,
perhaps, by rea<U+017F>on of the Animal Spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Exhau<U+017F>ted. An acid Humour is wont to
abound in the Body, for the mo<U+017F>t part, from
a<U+017F><U+017F>umed Aliments, Sauces, or Medicaments,
which are <U+017F>harp, with <U+017F>harp Wines, <U+017F>uch as
for the mo<U+017F>t part is Reni<U+017F>h, Mo<U+017F>ellanous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as al<U+017F>o, becau<U+017F>e of a more Cold Air, and North
Wind, Sorrow of Mind though not over much,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The motion of the Animal Spirits, to
the Pancreas, is impedited, when the Animal
Spirits are defective; or being more dull or
<U+017F>low throughout the whole Body; al<U+017F>o, when
the Nerves are ob<U+017F>tructed, di<U+017F><U+017F>ecated, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed.</p>
            <p>The Succus Pancreaticus is made Salt by a
Marine, or Fo<U+017F><U+017F>ile Sal<U+017F>itude, in like manner,
becau<U+017F>e of the Sero<U+017F>ity of the Blood likewi<U+017F>e
Salt; perhaps by a like Fault of the Glandules
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64159:59"/>
concurring; for which rea<U+017F>on, the Secretion
of the Saline parts from the Acid, cannot be
ab<U+017F>olved: For, our common Salt con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth of
two parts, to wit, a Lixivious Salt, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid

the Pancreatick Juice <U+017F>eemeth to us, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the more gro<U+017F>s, or Terrene Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
with which its acid Particles are invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
which appeareth, not only in Fruits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>oure, afterwards, when by the gentle
Heat of the Sun, they are Ripened, they are
made a little more acid; and at length, when
the more gro<U+017F>s Particles thereof, by the Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Heat, are more exalted, they become
Sweet.</p>
            <p>But moreover it is manife<U+017F>t, that tho<U+017F>e things
which are <U+017F>ower, it is by their Syncri<U+017F>is and
Diacri<U+017F>is: So D. <hi>Pai<U+017F>enus</hi> hath noted in <hi>The<U+017F>i.</hi>
XXI. C. that the juyce of Ribes, being
powred to Coral of a grateful acid, becomes
au<U+017F>tere. Vitriol and Allum di<U+017F>tilled, yield an
acid Spirit: Likewi<U+017F>e an acid Spirit may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tilled
from <U+017F>ealed Earths, Bole Armeniack, and

the Pancreas, or it's Juyce evilly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>po<U+017F>ed.</head>
            <p>HAving declared the more grievous Vices
wherewith the Pancreas and its Juyce are
wont to be affected, every man may <U+017F>ee, that
from that Fountain very many Incommodities
to Mortals do proceed; all which things,
<U+017F>eeing we have propo<U+017F>ed to handle them in
order, we <U+017F>hall fir<U+017F>t judge of tho<U+017F>e which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Pancreas it <U+017F>elf, by <U+017F>ubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tho<U+017F>e things which are wont to flow from its
juyce.</p>
            <p>If the Pancreas acquire a Schirrous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance
re<U+017F>embling Stones, and al<U+017F>o weighty in the
place where it <U+017F>hould defend the Sanguinous
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, as <U+017F>ome would have it, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould
be hurt by the Vertaebrae, or other parts, it will
greatly afflict them by Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and will
hinder the circular motion of the Blood, from
whence divers Di<U+017F>tentions, Inflammations, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructions,
and other things ari<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>pring
up, fit to impedite the Common u<U+017F>e of the
Bowels. Be<U+017F>ides al<U+017F>o by its weight, it will not
a little hinder the Stomach from performing its
Office by compre<U+017F><U+017F>ing it; but when it is inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64159:60"/>
or Apo<U+017F>thumated, for the mo<U+017F>t part it will
cau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame Incommodities with the other
Bowels, being afflicted with the <U+017F>ame Vice.
But <U+017F>ome may <U+017F>ay, if <U+017F>uch grievous Effects
happen to the Pancreas, how can the u<U+017F>e there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
be <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and how do we hitherto live
<U+017F>o long with them? Then may we al<U+017F>o demand
how tho<U+017F>e men may live, to who<U+017F>e Brain,
Heart, Liver, and other bowels nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to
Life, the <U+017F>ame, or the like things happen, and
we <U+017F>hall further enquire of them, by what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
<U+017F>uch may live well or ill? The Hi<U+017F>tories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
do certainly te<U+017F>tifie, that <U+017F>uch live a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erable
life, and when the Evil <U+017F>hall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ed,
tho<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o for no other Cau<U+017F>e have
changed Life for Death: So that from that
part can nothing be infer'd again<U+017F>t our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<U+017F>is.</p>
            <p>Having unfolded the Incommodities ari<U+017F>ing
from the Parenchyma of the Pancreas it <U+017F>elf, it
remaineth, that we al<U+017F>o run through the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
Hurt, which the evil Qualities, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Pancreatick Juyce, or other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
exi<U+017F>ting in the thin Gutt, do draw after
them.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Pancreatick Juyce being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Inte<U+017F>tines in a le<U+017F><U+017F>er quantity, will
not <U+017F>ufficiently free the Gutts from the <U+017F>uperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Ob<U+017F>tructions, as the Learned <hi>R. Lower,</hi>
who judgeth this juyce to be ordained by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

by the defect thereof, he hath ob<U+017F>erved Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructions
of the Venae Lacteae, in the<U+017F>e very
words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It <U+017F>eems to me mo<U+017F>t true, that that great Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule
(namely the Pancreas) is <U+017F>eated in that
place; and that Ductus to be opened into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>tines,
that the Lympha (for <U+017F>o he calleth the
Pancreatick Juyce) being there <U+017F>eparated, may be
mixed with the de<U+017F>cending Chyle, whereby it may
more readily enter, and more expeditely pa<U+017F>s through
the narrow Channel of the Lactean Veins; and
indeed the Chyle in the Milkey Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
of its cra<U+017F>citie, or for want of potulent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
(which ought to be for its Vehicle) may
<U+017F>ometimes be apt to be <U+017F>tagnant, and <U+017F>o concrete,
and by the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, to <U+017F>top, and altogether fill
up tho<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, as in a Dog, who<U+017F>e Pancreas was
obdurated I once ob<U+017F>erved.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Neither al<U+017F>o will it <U+017F>ufficiently promote the
Natural, and due Separation of the Chyle from
the Excrements, and that e<U+017F>pecially if the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be more dry, or of a more difficult Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:
Hence nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follows a dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed
Nutrition of the whole body, as al<U+017F>o a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>al
Langui<U+017F>hing; <U+017F>o that, <U+017F>uch may rather be
<U+017F>aid to draw Life, than to live. But the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice, being <U+017F>eparated in a larger
quantity; and brought to the Inte<U+017F>tines, will, as
it were, pare off, not only their <U+017F>uperfluous
Pituity, but al<U+017F>o that nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary part which
<U+017F>hould defend them from Injuries like a Curry-Comb;
and be<U+017F>ides, it will <U+017F>eparate more
than it ought, from the a<U+017F><U+017F>umed Aliments, <U+017F>o
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64159:61"/>
that, <U+017F>ometimes the unprofitable, and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
parts, together with the profitable,
may be conveyed to the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood; <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
only the profitable Parts, but in a larger
quantity than they <U+017F>hould, may be carryed by
the <U+017F>ame wayes: From whence, if here we
<U+017F>ay a Pethora will happen, and thence a Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy,
Who can overthrow our A<U+017F><U+017F>ertions?
More-over, we think that the Lancionations, in
the left Hypocondria, fir<U+017F>t mole<U+017F>ted by cour<U+017F>es,
do proceed from too great a quantity of the
Bile and Pancreatick Juyce, <U+017F>eparated from
the Blood, by a more vehement Motion of the
Body, and the <U+017F>tirring up a greater Efferve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p>For, it is mo<U+017F>t certain, that Running, or
any other vehement Exerci<U+017F>e of the Body, doth
accelerate the Motion of the Blood, through
the whole Body; which, <U+017F>eeing it is the cau<U+017F>e
of the Separation of the<U+017F>e or other Humours,
then it is al<U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that tho<U+017F>e Humours
be depo<U+017F>ited into the Guts in a greater plenty;
which, being <U+017F>eparated in a Natural Quantity,
and Quality, if, as we have already proved,
they may excite a natural and friendly Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>cency
to Nature, may not the contrary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
when they are otherwi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed by exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an Efferve<U+017F>cency, greater, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome
to Nature? After a wonderful manner
doth that place confirm this our Opinion, in
which tho<U+017F>e paines are perceived by cour<U+017F>e, and
very ordinarily, though unju<U+017F>tly, are a<U+017F>cribed
to the Spleen; becau<U+017F>e the Spleen is not in that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64159:62"/>
place, where tho<U+017F>e pains do in us excite a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>tation,
but hath its <U+017F>eat more down-wards;
becau<U+017F>e in that place tho<U+017F>e paines do manife<U+017F>t
them<U+017F>elves in the Anteriour part of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondria,
where the thin Gut <hi>M,</hi> emerging
under the Me<U+017F>entery <hi>N,</hi> doth lye by the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,
as is to be <U+017F>een in the fir<U+017F>t Table,
where we have Delineated to the Life the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of that Inte<U+017F>tine.</p>
            <p>The inequal <U+017F>eparation of the Succus Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaticus,
and propul<U+017F>ion thereof, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>tines,
produceth various Mutations in the
Guts, and el<U+017F>e-where, concerning the <U+017F>uddain
Happening of which, no man will ever a<U+017F><U+017F>igne
a fit Rea<U+017F>on, who will not give heed to tho<U+017F>e
things. Hence we think to be deduced the
<U+017F>uddain Deliquiums of the Wind <U+017F>ometimes
advening, erratick Feavers, intermitious of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pancreatick Juice being more fluid, will
more dilute the Pituity of the Guts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<U+017F>ometimes occa<U+017F>ion the Flux of the Belly;
e<U+017F>pecially if it be conjoyned with a Sal<U+017F>itude,
by who<U+017F>e acrimony the Guts are provoked to
their Contraction; and unle<U+017F>s that Flux of
the Belly follow the Peri<U+017F>taltick Motion of
the Guts, it will nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily expre<U+017F>s a greater
Quantity of Chyle into the Venae Lacteae, from
whence the <U+017F>ame incommodities will ari<U+017F>e,
which we have deduced from the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juyce, <U+017F>eparated in too large a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:64159:62"/>
The more Vi<U+017F>cid Pancreatick Juice concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by the lea<U+017F>t external Cold, will occa<U+017F>ion
Ob<U+017F>tructions, as al<U+017F>o intermitting Feavers, and
likewi<U+017F>e a<U+017F>tringe the Belly. Concerning the
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Qualities, and fir<U+017F>t of the Relli<U+017F>h,
there is <U+017F>ometimes produced a Pancreatick
juyce le<U+017F>s acid; from whence there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a due Efferve<U+017F>cency in the Duodenum,
and therefore not a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Separation of the
profitable parts from the unprofitable, nor a
de<U+017F>ired Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency be<U+017F>towed on the Blood:
and therefore they, in whom <U+017F>uch Blood is,
have been le<U+017F>s able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t Pe<U+017F>tilential Venom,
than tho<U+017F>e in whom, by the laudable Acidity
of their Pancreatick Juice, have al<U+017F>o a more
Laudable and greater Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency of their
Blood. Hence the rea<U+017F>on is al<U+017F>o clear, Why
Melancholly Men are le<U+017F>s afflicted with the
Plague, than tho<U+017F>e who are endued with a Bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
blood.</p>
            <p>For we think that no man may be infected
with the Plague, <U+017F>o long as the Natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tency
of his blood is pre<U+017F>erved: We a<U+017F><U+017F>ert
this the more freely, becau<U+017F>e we <U+017F>ee the blood
in all per<U+017F>ons infected with the Plague to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and obtain a far more fluid con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency:
So that if <U+017F>ometimes by chance, Negligence,
Ignorance, or any other urging Cau<U+017F>e; as for
example, too great a Plethory, <U+017F>pitting of
blood bringing a pre<U+017F>ent danger to Life, let a
Vein be opened, the blood flowing out although
refrigerated; neverthele<U+017F>s, is in no wi<U+017F>e coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
neither can it acquire a due con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64159:63"/>
even as <U+017F>ometimes is wont to happen to the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits, being loo<U+017F>ed from their Fetters, and
di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated from the acidity exi<U+017F>ting in the blood,
wherefore al<U+017F>o <U+017F>uch a blood by divers Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
is called putrid.</p>
            <p>We commonly <U+017F>ay, becau<U+017F>e it may <U+017F>o happen,
that the whole Ma<U+017F>s of blood, not as yet equally
infected, the laudible part of the blood in the
cutting of a Vein, may only flow out, the blood
remaining in the body being depraved; the
which thing Practitioners daily ob<U+017F>erve to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in Venae-Section; we do not only think
with other Practitioners, that the blood remains
fluid, without the bodies of tho<U+017F>e who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the Plague; but do al<U+017F>o affirm the
like fluidity in the bodies of tho<U+017F>e extingui<U+017F>hed
by the Pe<U+017F>t, as we have learned by Experience,
which perhaps may <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange to tho<U+017F>e who
know not the Nature of volatile Salts, but not
<U+017F>o to us, who have very often mingled it with
the blood, and the blood always remained fluid,
the which cannot be certainly expected from the
commixture of any other thing, with the blood,
then volatile Salts.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, if you mingle any acid
Spirit with the Blood <hi>Dictum Factum,</hi> the
Blood will be more or le<U+017F>s Coagulated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as that Spirit <U+017F>hall be more or le<U+017F>s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid;
as for example, if to try the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we take Oyle of Vitriol, Oyle of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
per Campanum, Aqua Fortis, Aqua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides, that the Blood will pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be Coagulated by them, it al<U+017F>o acquires a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64159:63"/>
Che<U+017F>-Nut Colour. But if we take the Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
Spirit of Salt, Juice of Lammons, Di<U+017F>til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Vinegar or the like, who<U+017F>e acid Spirit is
more Temperate, the Blood will only acquire
the Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency of a gro<U+017F><U+017F>er Syrup, with its red
Colour remaining unhurt.</p>
            <p>From whence it is evident, the u<U+017F>e of Acids
may pre<U+017F>erve men from the Plague, not, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Opinion of many Authors, that
they cut and attenuate; but as they pre<U+017F>erve
the natural Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency of the Blood, and do
hinder its being infected, with a more <U+017F>harp
Volatile Salt, which we, together with the
Air, <U+017F>uck into our Bodies: For this cau<U+017F>e,
the mo<U+017F>t Famous Dr. <hi>Sylvius,</hi> who likewi<U+017F>e
hath Con<U+017F>tituted the Venom of the Plague,
in a more <U+017F>harp Volatile Salt; when, <U+017F>ome
Years <U+017F>ince, in the great Plague at <hi>Am<U+017F>terdam,</hi>
which he fore-<U+017F>aw, he took a Cru<U+017F>t of Bread,
imbrued with white-Wine-Vinegar, in which
Mary-Golds had likewi<U+017F>e been <U+017F>teeped; by
which Alexipharmack he <U+017F>o well pre<U+017F>erved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
that he never was infected with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tilential
Venome. But when, through too
much ha<U+017F>t, he omitted the <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexipharmack,</hi>
as <U+017F>oon as he entred into an infected Hou<U+017F>e, he
was infected with a pain in the Head; from
which, at other times, he was free.</p>
            <p>Which things being rightly con<U+017F>idered, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one may <U+017F>ee that the Pe<U+017F>tilent Venome is not
indued with any force of Coagulating, as the

to de<U+017F>cribe the Pe<U+017F>tilence: Wherefore
we will leave the re<U+017F>t to a further Occa<U+017F>ion,
<U+017F>eeing it is time that we return to the Incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
flowing from the more Acid Pancreatick
Juyce.</p>
            <p>The Pancreatick Juyce, being more <U+017F>harp,
is the cau<U+017F>e, fir<U+017F>t, of every Internal Cold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fir<U+017F>t of all felt in the Region of the Loyns,
and afterwards di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed into the whole Body;
as for the mo<U+017F>t part, we ob<U+017F>erve in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Fits of Agues, or Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Of all Cutting paines, as well
in the Hypocondria's, and whole Belly, as
in other parts of the Body. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Of
all manife<U+017F>t paines in the Belly, from whence
the Sick is <U+017F>ometimes tormented after a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
manner. Wherefore we deduce all the
black and aeruginous Bile from the <U+017F>ame, more
Acid, Pancreatick Juyce: Becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ometimes
being put into a Pewter Chamber Pot, or
Bra<U+017F>s Ba<U+017F>on, they Corrode the <U+017F>ame, and <U+017F>end
forth a <U+017F>harp Savour; and al<U+017F>o excite a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t
Efferve<U+017F>cency; which every man, who
hath <U+017F>aluted but the thre<U+017F>hold of Chymi<U+017F>try,
knows, cannot happen from any thing but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids:
From whence, they may be compelled to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64159:64"/>
confe<U+017F>s their Errour; who affirm, That all
black Choler, proceeding from Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or Dejection of the Belly, comes from
the Follicles of the Gall, or the Spleen.</p>
            <p>All the<U+017F>e things are not a little confirmed, by
the following Experiment, <U+017F>ometimes made
by us in a Dog; in the Section of whom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alive, having opened the Duodenum, we
found a greeni<U+017F>h Liquor among the black, <U+017F>uch
as the Antients have depicted to us for <hi>Atrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:</hi>
that we might pur<U+017F>ue a more Intimate
cognition thereof, we examined diligently all the
wayes through which any thing might be tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to that Inte<U+017F>tine; and <U+017F>eeing that be<U+017F>ides
the Bilar Duct, the Pancreatick, and the Ventrile,
there was no way perceptible to the <U+017F>ight,
through which any notable Quantity of Humors
might be afforded to the Inte<U+017F>tines; we judge
therefore, that in one of tho<U+017F>e, the matter
thereof mu<U+017F>t be ob<U+017F>cured: Wherefore we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
all tho<U+017F>e wayes; in the fir<U+017F>t whereof,
we found the Bile, naturally Con<U+017F>tituted, that
waxing Yellow from a Green: In the <U+017F>econd
we found the Pancreatick Juyce mo<U+017F>t limpid,
like to Di<U+017F>tilled Water: In the third we found
the Aliments half crude, having the Colour of
White A<U+017F>hes.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that neither the Liver, nor
the Pancreas, nor al<U+017F>o the Stomach, carryed
that <hi>Atrabilis</hi> to the Inte<U+017F>tine, we began to <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
whether that <hi>Atrabilis</hi> might not emerge
by the Union of two or three of tho<U+017F>e Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
being mingled together by cour<U+017F>e:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64159:65"/>
Concerning which thing, that we might attain
to a greater Certainty, we affu<U+017F>ed Spirit of
Vitriol to the Bile, drawn forth from its Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icle,
and placed it in the heat of the Sun;
from whence there was commonly excited from
the Black, a Greeni<U+017F>h Liquor, <U+017F>uch as we
fir<U+017F>t found in the Duodenum: Hence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the <U+017F>aid Humour, called <hi>Atrabilis,</hi> not
to flow from this, or that part, but to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in the Duodenum. Namely, as the
Natural Colour of the Bile hath been
tran<U+017F>mitted into Black, and Green, by the
Concour<U+017F>e of the more Acid Pancreatick
Juyce.</p>
            <p>Seeing that the Pancreatick Juyce, by the
ordinary Law of Nature, may continually be
mingled with the Bile, and the Inte<U+017F>tinal Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,
we will a little propo<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame, as
joyn'd with tho<U+017F>e Humours. If it chanceth
that the more <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>h Pancreatick Juyce,
bounds with a <U+017F>harper Bile, and the Inte<U+017F>tinal
Pituity rightly Con<U+017F>tituted, the <U+017F>trength of the
Pancreatick Juyce, in that Concour<U+017F>e, will be
altogether infringed; and the Exhalations,
which are excited by the Efferve<U+017F>cency of tho<U+017F>e
Humours, will a<U+017F>cend, not <U+017F>o much with Acid,
as Lixivious Particles; which, when they reach
to the Stomach, by infringing its Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they will hinder the Concoction of the
Aliment, and de<U+017F>troy the Appetite: but if it
happen that tho<U+017F>e Exhalations a<U+017F>cend to the
Jaws, there, among<U+017F>t other Incommodities,
they will induce a Dryne<U+017F>s of the Mouth, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64159:65"/>
if they infect the Spittle with their Sal<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
But if they proceed further, through
the Milky Veines to the Heart, from whence,
with the blood, they may pa<U+017F>s through the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the body, they will al<U+017F>o produce a
Heat in tho<U+017F>e, as at fir<U+017F>t in the Inte<U+017F>tines; and
there more trouble<U+017F>ome, where tho<U+017F>e Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>harp.</p>
            <p>If a more <U+017F>harp Pancreatick Juyce concurreth
with a <U+017F>harper Bile, there will pre<U+017F>ently be a
mighty Efferve<U+017F>cency excited in the Duodenum,
whereby the Inte<U+017F>tines are <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tended,
that they threaten a Ruption; which
thing we have very often ob<U+017F>erved, whil<U+017F>t we
applyed our <U+017F>elves to our Study in <hi>Leyden,</hi> whil<U+017F>t
we mixed together divers Liquors <U+017F>it for Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
in two little Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, in part of the
Inte<U+017F>tine intercepted by Ligatures, (even as
D. <hi>Schuyl</hi> hath expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed it, Fig. <hi>B.</hi> in his Treati<U+017F>e,
<hi>De veteri Medicina</hi>) wherefore we judge, in the
fir<U+017F>t in<U+017F>tant Emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>harp Exhalations
which way <U+017F>oever turn'd about, that, that Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>cency
will excite very many grievous Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities;
many whereof will al<U+017F>o pre<U+017F>ently
cea<U+017F>e by the Di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation of tho<U+017F>e Exhalations,
becau<U+017F>e either Humour being enervated after
that Inte<U+017F>tinal Conflict layes down its force, and
cea<U+017F>eth from further contention; for in <U+017F>uch an
Efferve<U+017F>cency the acid Particles are <U+017F>o joyned
with the Saline, that without great difficulty
they are never to be <U+017F>eparated; wherefore as
unworthy they are expelled from the body for
Atra-bilis, if the acid over-grow the Salt, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64159:66"/>
get Dominion; in the mean time, they mo<U+017F>t
mi<U+017F>erably afflict the body, no otherwi<U+017F>e than as

whence Fluxes of the belly, Vomitings, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>mus,
Dy<U+017F>enteries, and <U+017F>ix Hundred other
Incommodities <U+017F>pringing from the Atra-bilis
will proceed, and tho<U+017F>e the more grievous, or
more gentle, as the acidity of the Pancreatick
juyce <U+017F>hall remain more or le<U+017F>s, intemperate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <U+017F>aid Conflict.</p>
            <p>If be<U+017F>ides the Bile, and the Pancreatick juyce
offending even now <U+017F>poken of, much Phlegme
<U+017F>ticks in the Gutts, and if the <U+017F>ame phlegme be
vi<U+017F>cous, by rea<U+017F>on of the Incommodities already
declared, there will happen Flatulencies, the

let him read <hi>J. Fiennus,</hi> and others,
who have profe<U+017F><U+017F>edly Written of Flatulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>If a <U+017F>harper Pancreatick Juyce concurs with
a more <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>h Bile, it will not excite <U+017F>o mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t
an Efferve<U+017F>cency, but by its Acrimony will
<U+017F>tir up wringings of the Gutts, Ero<U+017F>ions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but if being more intemperate, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through
the little Channels of the Lactean Veins, it
toucheth the fir<U+017F>t and la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>idence of life, it
will produce the Auxiety of the Heart, Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,
and many other Incommodities hereafter

Intemperance of the Pancreatick Juyce may

            <p>EVen as from the Vitiation of the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

Functions are hurt; <U+017F>o from the <U+017F>ame Fountain
do we judge that various Effects may be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:

thereof to be a<U+017F>cribed to the Pancreatick

through the ob<U+017F>tructing Pituity, then cau<U+017F>ing a

being tran<U+017F>lated to the Heart, produceth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural

            <p>Which Opinion, <U+017F>eeing that hitherto it hath
been known to few, to avoid confu<U+017F>ion in the

Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, <U+017F>pringing from this more intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
juyce.</p>
            <p>It <U+017F>eems probable to us, that the cau<U+017F>e of the
Arthritis (or Gout) derives its original from the
<U+017F>aid acid Pancreatick Juyce; namely, when its ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
acidity, either with Phlegme, or the Serum
of the blood is carried to the joynts, and lyeth in
them; the <U+017F>ymptoms al<U+017F>o concurring, <U+017F>eems to
per<U+017F>wade the <U+017F>ame thing to us; for tho<U+017F>e pains
for the mo<U+017F>t part are wont both to invade,
and be exa<U+017F>perated with a Paroxy<U+017F>me of a
Feaver, but according to the diver<U+017F>e man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
wherewith the Bile and the inte<U+017F>tinal
Pituity are affected; <U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e paines of the
Joynts do al<U+017F>o manife<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e
Mode, with the re<U+017F>t of the concomitant
Symptoms.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>ame thing is te<U+017F>tified by the Urine, which
once for curio<U+017F>ity <U+017F>ake, we ta<U+017F>ted with Doctor
<hi>Roo<U+017F>endael,</hi> in which we found a notable Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We have al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erved (which <U+017F>eems
not a little to confirm this our Opinion) in
the<U+017F>e Regions, that Wine, e<U+017F>pecially Reni<U+017F>h,
is exceedingly adver<U+017F>e to tho<U+017F>e who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to this Di<U+017F>temper; the which we
judge to happen from the <U+017F>ame, becau<U+017F>e that
Wine contains in it a greater acidity than other
Wines.</p>
            <p>That this more acid Pancreatick Juyce doth
increa<U+017F>e Hunger, and <U+017F>tir up and in<U+017F>atiable, and
Dog-like Appetite; few hereafter will doubt,
who have con<U+017F>idered diligently, that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce, and the <U+017F>harp Exhalations
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64159:68"/>
thereof do a<U+017F>cend even into the Stomach, as
is manife<U+017F>t by the Sower Belchings, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
breaking forth, and <U+017F>ometimes by the
Vomiting forth of Humours, more or le<U+017F>s
acid.</p>
            <p>If they <U+017F>ay that that juyce which is effu<U+017F>ed
into the Inte<U+017F>tine, the breadth of four Fingers
below the Pylorus, cannot a<U+017F>cend through the
Pylorus into the Stomach, it being naturally
<U+017F>hut; we may al<U+017F>o ask how the Bile (which by
all is granted) may a<U+017F>cend to the Stomach,
which i<U+017F><U+017F>ueth into the Inte<U+017F>tine by the <U+017F>ame pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age:
If they <U+017F>ay it comes to pa<U+017F>s by the in
verted peri<U+017F>taltick Motion of the Inte<U+017F>tines,
we then <U+017F>ay, that by the <U+017F>ame Motion, the
Pancreatick Juyce may al<U+017F>o a<U+017F>cend, to which
we <U+017F>hall adde that Exhalations do far more
ea<U+017F>ily a<U+017F>cend into the Stomach than the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
            <p>More acid Exhalations being excited, from
the Pancreatick Juyce, through its Efferve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and altogether with Flatulencies, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
through the Venae Lactae to the Heart, and
from thence to the Lungs, and there <U+017F>ticking,
do not only cau<U+017F>e a difficult Re<U+017F>piration, but
al<U+017F>o a dry Cough; the Confirmation of which,
we have not only <U+017F>een in the Ho<U+017F>pital of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
but el<U+017F>e-where: For, in the diffecting of
Dead Bodies, we have often found the Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma
of the Lungs, and its Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, as yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tended
with Wind. If a Vi<U+017F>cid Pituity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64159:68"/>
but the Species of an <hi>A<U+017F>thma?</hi> But if
tho<U+017F>e Exhalations, and Flatulencies, do tend
further to the Head, the paines thereof will
produce Alienation of the Mind, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
infinite other Di<U+017F>commodities; every
man may believe, That the Epileptick Inva<U+017F>ions

will give it a greater Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency; whence the
Blood, le<U+017F>s Rarifying, will produce a le<U+017F><U+017F>er
Pul<U+017F>e: From which, Vice highly exceeding, we
judge a Syncope, <U+017F>ometimes to be produced,
which is not a little confirmed by that Example
which <hi>Lazarus Riverius</hi> relates in <hi>Lib.</hi> VIII.
<hi>Fol.</hi> 358. of his Practice concerning that <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,</hi>
which <hi>P. Salius,</hi> as he reports, <hi>Lib. De

of 14 Years of Age: Who, after a dayes
<U+017F>uffering of Heavine<U+017F>s of the Head, Vertigo,
and grievous Anxieties, the day following <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
dyed: Afterwards her Body being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
the whole blood in the great Artery
and the Vena Cava appeared to be Concreted,
and <U+017F>o changed that it might intirely be drawn
out from the Vein, and Artery, even as a Sword
out of its Scabbard.</p>
            <p>Concerning which thing, if any doubt, either
by ours, or others Examples, let him take an
acid Liquor, and pour it, by degrees, into the
Vein of any Living Dog, and he <U+017F>hall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ob<U+017F>erve the Blood, therein, to be <U+017F>o Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated,
and Concreted, that the greater

the Effu<U+017F>ion of the blood; but al<U+017F>o when the acid

right Ventricle of the Heart, that it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
extingui<U+017F>h, and kill the Dog. Al<U+017F>o,
no man will deny, that Convul<U+017F>ions, for the
mo<U+017F>t part, proceed from an Internal Cau<U+017F>e,
from the Acrimony of Humours, irritating the
Nerves, and cau<U+017F>ing, by a greater Influx of the
animal Spirits, into the Mu<U+017F>cles, Involuntary,
and al<U+017F>o Violent Motions: But when there is
a two fold Acrimony of Humours, <hi>viz.</hi> Acid,
and Salt, <U+017F>ome perhaps may doubt, which of
the<U+017F>e do mo<U+017F>t frequently produce tho<U+017F>e Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul<U+017F>ive
Motions: But, for as much as we can
ob<U+017F>erve, they rather proceed from an acid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony,
than a Salt: becau<U+017F>e we <U+017F>ee that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick
Medicaments, and tho<U+017F>e abounding
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64159:69"/>
with a Volatile Salt, do very much conduce
to their Cure; which would never come to

be the Concomitants of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, ari<U+017F>ing
from an acid Acrimony: Yea, the Effects of
Acids are allowed to be far more powerful,
as is to be <U+017F>een in <hi>Helmont</hi> De Lithia<U+017F>i. <hi>Cap. 9.
Pag. 725. §.</hi> 71. where he relates, that he <U+017F>aw

them<U+017F>elves with his Blood. From the <U+017F>ame

inject it again by a Syringe, and you <U+017F>hall find,
to your Pain, that what I <U+017F>ay, is true.</q> Al<U+017F>o, that
from the more acid Pancreatick Juyce, Ulcers do
<U+017F>ometimes break forth in the Skin, corroding the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64159:70"/>
<U+017F>ame, as al<U+017F>o producing very great paines, they
will not deny, who, following the Opinions of
the Antients, determine them to ari<U+017F>e from the
<hi>Atra-Bilis;</hi> <U+017F>eeing that the <hi>Atra-Bilis</hi> of the
Antients (as we have above Demon<U+017F>trated) hath
its Original from the more acid Pancreatick
Juyce.</p>
            <p>We are like-wi<U+017F>e plainly per<U+017F>waded, that
the more acid Pancreatick Juyce, e<U+017F>pecially
if it hath any Au<U+017F>terity conjoyned with it,
produceth a greater a<U+017F>tringency of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>For, if the Bile, by its Acrimony irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Guts (as is granted) may excite the
Flux of the Belly, why may not that, which
is contrary to <U+017F>uch a Bile, produce a contrary
Effect? Notwith<U+017F>tanding, if the belly be bound
by a Vi<U+017F>cid Matter, then we think, likewi<U+017F>e,
that a Flux may happen from the <U+017F>harper Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce, as it hath a power of inciding,
and attenuating, the Vi<U+017F>cid Pituity: From
which it is manife<U+017F>t, that the Pancreatick
Juyce, according to the Diver<U+017F>ity of Humours,
concurring with it, doth very often produce
a diver<U+017F>e and contrary Effect; which thing we
would have well noted, le<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem to
contradict our <U+017F>elf, in explicating the Effects of
this juyce.</p>
            <p>As yet we think, even as we <U+017F>eem to have
already <U+017F>aid, that the <hi>Atra</hi> and <hi>Eruginous</hi> Bile
is excited from the more acid Pancreatick
Juyce, and a certain <U+017F>harp Bile concurring;
and con<U+017F>equently all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, which Authors
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64159:70"/>
deduce from them; and therefore they are not
cured by other Medicaments, than tho<U+017F>e which
are fit to correct the more acid Pancreatick
Juyce: Which, as it is Con<U+017F>onant with
Rea<U+017F>on; <U+017F>o it will not appear Incredible to
tho<U+017F>e, who will con<U+017F>ider the things above
<U+017F>poken by us, with a more attentive
Mind.</p>
            <p>But perhaps <U+017F>ome will <U+017F>ay, after what manner
doth the Pancreatick Juyce produce the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-Bilis,</hi>
<U+017F>eeing that we have a<U+017F>cribed the
Whiti<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s of the Chyle, after the Efferve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
in the thin Gut, to the acidity of the
Pancreatick Juyce? To which we an<U+017F>wer,
That Acids, according to the Diver<U+017F>ity of the
matter where-with they are mixed, do al<U+017F>o
produce a divers Colour; for example, pour
an acid Spirit to common Sulphur, di<U+017F><U+017F>olved
in a Lixivium, and its red Colour will be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into white. Antimony Calcind, with Nitre
or Chalk, being boyl'd in Fountain-Water,
and any acid thing, being affu<U+017F>ed to its clear
Colature, will pre<U+017F>ently acquire a Saffron Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
            <p>A clear Infu<U+017F>ion of Galls, mixed with the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Vitriol, maketh Ink, to which, if you
add the acid Spirit of Vitriol, that Ink will
lo<U+017F>e all its blackne<U+017F>s, and become clear, like
to Fountain-Water. The Blew Tincture of
Violets, being mixed with Oyle of Vitriol,
will wax into a Purple. The Wood Acanthus
brought from <hi>Bra<U+017F>ile,</hi> being infu<U+017F>ed in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water, doth freely yeild a red Tincture,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64159:71"/>
which put to Di<U+017F>tilled Vinegar, acquires a
Colour like to White-Wine. A Knife, after
it, hath cut a Pomecitron, in the Middle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
it be wiped, and clean<U+017F>ed, from the Soure
Juyce of the Citron, in a <U+017F>hort time will be
reduced to a nigrous Colour. And why from
the <U+017F>ame acidity too much exalted in Ulcers, the
Cyrurgions Probe may not be <U+017F>tained with a
certain Blackne<U+017F>s, (as we have very often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved)
and <U+017F>uch Ulcers be happily cured by
Temperating of the acidity, (as <hi>Helmont</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>heth
<hi>De Bla<U+017F>e humano, §.</hi> 53. we leave to the
judgment of others?</p>
            <p>It may here <U+017F>uffice for us to have proved, that
from one and the <U+017F>ame acid, permixed with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e
things; one while a White, another a
Black, another a Yellow, another a Purple, and
<U+017F>o moreover other Colours may ari<U+017F>e. He

Solution of Minerals and Vegitables endued
with no Colour, let him go to that mo<U+017F>t curious
Treati<U+017F>e which D. <hi>Willis</hi> hath written, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fermentation, where <hi>pag. 88. Edit. Ang.</hi>
he may find very many Mutations of Colours
not unprofitable; and being about to a<U+017F><U+017F>igne the
Rea<U+017F>on thereof, he <U+017F>aith in the following page:
<q>If the rea<U+017F>on of this Phaeno-mena be enquired, it
ought altogether to be deduced from tho<U+017F>e minute
particles within the pores of every contained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor;
which according to the <U+017F>cituation and po<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being after a divers manner altered by the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion

            </p>
            <p>Having now unfolded the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es ri<U+017F>en from
the more acid Pancreatick Juyce, we <U+017F>eem in
our <U+017F>elves to hear <U+017F>ome in <U+017F>hort to ask the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion,
from whence the acid Humour in the body
may proceed, if we do not u<U+017F>e any acid things?
To which we an<U+017F>wer, that we can in no wi<U+017F>e
want tho<U+017F>e things which abound with an acidity.
For there is an acidity in the air, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
if the Caput Mortuum of Vitriol be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed
to the air, which from the <U+017F>ame eliciteth
a new acidity. Al<U+017F>o, that the air is full of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
particles, <hi>Ga<U+017F><U+017F>endus, Entius, Digbaeus,</hi>
and others, which profe<U+017F><U+017F>edly, or otherwi<U+017F>e
ingeniou<U+017F>ly treat of this Matter, have proved:
But no man is ignorant, that Nitre containeth
in it <U+017F>elf an acidity. There is al<U+017F>o an acidity
inherent in Aliments: For in Kitchings, if fle<U+017F>h,
or other Aliments, begin to corrupt, their
Broth doth wax <U+017F>ower; yea, we have collected
an acid Spirit in quantity <U+017F>ufficiently large, from
the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t of Condiments, to wit, Sugar, by
chymical Art.</p>
            <p>There is al<U+017F>o an acidity inherent in Drink;
for Beer, or Ale, as al<U+017F>o Wine, being left to
them<U+017F>elves, without the addition of any other
thing, do wax Soure: From whence, it is no
wonder, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> witne<U+017F><U+017F>eth, <hi>Lib. De
Vet. Med.</hi> Text. 24 that there <U+017F>hould be an
Acidity in Men. But, it being granted, that there
is an acid Humour in our Bodies, <U+017F>ome one,
more de<U+017F>irous of Truth, may ask, How it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64159:72"/>
comes to pa<U+017F>s, that it doth not only corrode
the parts of our Bodies, but al<U+017F>o Copper, and
Tinn, as we have <U+017F>hewed above? To this we
<U+017F>hall al<U+017F>o an<U+017F>wer, That the Fermentations,
continually happening in our Bodies, is <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for this thing: For, we daily <U+017F>ee that by
their help, many things are very <U+017F>harp, which
before were <U+017F>weet, or at lea<U+017F>t Temperate:
VVhether now this may happen by the Di<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the animal Spirits, or by rea<U+017F>on of
any other inward Cau<U+017F>e, we leave to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others. Likewi<U+017F>e, Experience te<U+017F>tifies,
that Men, feeding upon a cold Diet, do <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
for the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>on, and Cau<U+017F>e, fall into
burning Feavers.</p>
            <p>We have al<U+017F>o de<U+017F>ervedly a<U+017F>cribed the Uterine
Suffocation, or Mother-fits, <U+017F>o called, to the
Pancreatick juyce divers ways vitiated, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially
the Au<U+017F>tere: The following Ob<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<U+017F>eems to give us no <U+017F>mall light into the Truth
of this Matter, which our Friend <hi>El<U+017F>nerus,</hi> in
the Year 1667. <U+017F>ent to us from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Ande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave:</hi>

by the Suffocation of the Womb, in who<U+017F>e dead
body we found nothing at all, to which death might
be a<U+017F>cribed, but the blood coagulated in the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles
of the Heart, beyond the order of Nature.</q>
Which too much coagulation of the blood may
not be deduced from any other cau<U+017F>e, than
from an acid Juyce, as we have <U+017F>ufficiently
proved.</p>
            <p>But the rea<U+017F>on why we judge that this Effect
is not produced by the Pancreatick Juyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64159:72"/>
<U+017F>imply acid, is, that all women which have
a <U+017F>harp Pancreatick Juyce, are not affected with
that Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: And therefore we do the more
ea<U+017F>ily believe, that there is an au<U+017F>terity, or
har<U+017F>h Sowerne<U+017F>s pre<U+017F>ent with it; becau<U+017F>e we

certain Bitch, as al<U+017F>o in a Famous Man, the
truth of which the following Te<U+017F>timony freely
exhibiteth to us; done in the Year 1663. as it
was communicated to me by the mo<U+017F>t expert
Dr. <hi>Sylvius:</hi> 
               <q> I te<U+017F>ted the Pancreatick Juyce,

the Reli<U+017F>h being <U+017F>ome-what changed, it
<U+017F>eemed then to be Sub-acid, with a light Au<U+017F>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
There was <U+017F>uch a Stink produced in my
Mouth, that two of my Acquaintance, which
were with us, admoni<U+017F>hed me concerning it: The
Stink was like to that which ri<U+017F>eth from Muddy,
and <U+017F>trinking Water. My Mouth, and Jaws,
were not only ex<U+017F>iccated, or dried, but al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tringed,
that I <U+017F>eemed to be <U+017F>uffoccated; which
like thing, I <U+017F>uffer by a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e familiar to me:
And all the<U+017F>e things vani<U+017F>hed not <U+017F>uddainly, but
remained, and endured for a while, till they
left me by Degrees, and of their own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Bitch's Juyce was brought to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Dr. <hi>Sylvius,</hi> and exhibited to his Ta<U+017F>t,
in our pre<U+017F>ence. From this, and the like Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervations,
it <U+017F>eemeth not ab<U+017F>urd to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert,
That Men may <U+017F>ome-time be affected with a
like Hy<U+017F>terick Suffocation; e<U+017F>pecially, when
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64159:73"/>
its neare<U+017F>t Cau<U+017F>e happens, not from the
VVomb, but from the <U+017F>mall Gut; in which,
by rea<U+017F>on of the Vitious Efferve<U+017F>cency of
concurring Humours excited, Exhalations,
and au<U+017F>tere Flatulencies are <U+017F>tirred up;
which, as often as they ari<U+017F>e through the

tho<U+017F>e parts, that the Sick think them<U+017F>elves
to be in the peril of Strangulation, or Choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>That divers Species of the Hypocondriack

            <p>The<U+017F>e things being rightly con<U+017F>idered, we

            <p>But with what Medicaments the Vices of the
Pancreatick Juyce, above declared, may more
ea<U+017F>ily be tempered, or evacuated we <U+017F>hall now
handle in brief.</p>
            <p>The more <U+017F>paring Separation, or Excretion,
of the Pancreatick Juyce, happening by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of Vi<U+017F>cidity, will be cured by Medicines,
correcting any Vi<U+017F>cidity; <U+017F>uch are Volatile
Acids, as al<U+017F>o Salts, as well Volatile as Fixt;
e<U+017F>pecially the Volatile Salt of Amber <U+017F>eems to
agree with our bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; which, be<U+017F>ides the
Volatile Salt, al<U+017F>o containes certain Acid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles:
But, as often as the Pancreatick Juyce
is thought to be le<U+017F>s acid, then u<U+017F>e pure Acids,
on the contrary, as often as the Acidity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

When the Excretion of the Pancreatick Juyce
is more <U+017F>paring, by rea<U+017F>on of an Ob<U+017F>truction
happening in one or more of the Lateral
Ducts, the Medicines, but now <U+017F>poken of, are
al<U+017F>o profitable; for, except they loo<U+017F>en,
clean<U+017F>e, and ca<U+017F>t forth the Ob<U+017F>tructing Pituity,
or Remedy the Vi<U+017F>cous Crudity of the Blood,
they will certainly profit nothing, as we <U+017F>hall
endeavour, more largely, to explain the <U+017F>ame
in the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent Chapter, when we <U+017F>hall treat
of intermitting Feavers.</p>
            <p>The more Copious Increa<U+017F>e of the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juyce, will be Cured, as well by ab<U+017F>tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<U+017F>harp; al<U+017F>o by u<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch Medicaments as
may expel it from the body by the belly; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o
Sweats, and Urines. But, among <U+017F>uch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,
as educe it by the Belly, <U+017F>uch as
Purge-Water, are convenient above others;
by help whereof, the Serous Humours are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
more than the Bilious: which, <U+017F>ome
years <U+017F>ince, we have ob<U+017F>erved in not a few
Dogs, to whom we exhibited, as well Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragogues
as Cholagues; and, <U+017F>eeing that they
excellently deponed the belly, we <U+017F>uddenly
opened the Abdomen, at the very time of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
the Dog's as yet living; which done,
we could ob<U+017F>erve, although difficulty, in tho<U+017F>e
to whom we had given a Cholagogue, <hi>viz.</hi> one
Dram of Diagredium, that the Bile did flow in
a far greater Quantity, from the Inte<U+017F>tinal biliar
Duct; but in another, to whom we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
a Hydragogue, namely, of Powder
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64159:75"/>
of Jallap two Drams, we ob<U+017F>erved that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce did break forth in a large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
from its Ductus into the Inte<U+017F>tines, although
then the Bile al<U+017F>o did i<U+017F><U+017F>ue forth in a great
Quantity; and in another, to whom we had
given a Cholagogue, the Pancreatick Juyce
did al<U+017F>o flow forth in a greater Quantity, than
u<U+017F>uall; neverthele<U+017F>s we are able to collect,
that the Bile is far more Copiou<U+017F>ly purged by
Cholagogues, and the Pancreatick Juyce by
Hydragogues.</p>
            <p>In the<U+017F>e Experiments, performed other
things, did yet occur, worthy of note; for
fir<U+017F>t of all, at the very time of purgation, there
was nothing depo<U+017F>ited through the Me<U+017F>eraick
Arteries into the Cavity of the Inte<U+017F>tines; but
what <U+017F>o ever of a Liquid matter remained in
them, after expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, was <U+017F>ucked up by the
Venae Lacteae, or Me<U+017F>eraick Veines. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
That tho<U+017F>e Ducts, in whom the Lactean
Veines appeared not: After 3. or 4. Hours
Exhibition of Aliment, we cut the Abdomen in
them; neither the Bile, nor the Pancreatick
Juyce, was carryed to the Inte<U+017F>tine, in a more
than u<U+017F>ual Quantity. Concerning which, <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

made, we <U+017F>hall more perfectly (al<U+017F>o) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand

following, neither a Tertian, or a Quartan
Feaver may be deduced, unle<U+017F>s they <U+017F>ay that

preternaturally detained in any part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
which like-wi<U+017F>e, doth not alike appear
to tho<U+017F>e, to whom it is known, how ea<U+017F>ily the

the blood being made more <U+017F>harp, do <U+017F>uddenly
excite, mutually, among them<U+017F>elves, a Heat
and Inflamation of the Part; to which, if an
Apo<U+017F>teme be <U+017F>ubjoyned that will affect the
Blood, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through its Circuits continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and not by Intervals: Whence if a

an Intermitting, but a Continuall Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>

to the generation of intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but to furni<U+017F>h the phlegme which is of
that nature that daily, the yellow Bile w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> every

a higher ingenuity, may ask fir<U+017F>t whether or
no tho<U+017F>e humours <U+017F>uch as they are de<U+017F>cribed
in the Schools can be Demon<U+017F>trated to be in
the ma<U+017F>s of Blood, <U+017F>eeing it is evident by what

from the yellow Bile, and more acid pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce. Secondly, how doth that <U+017F>eem
probable that a humour more cold, tenatious,
and unapt for motion, as phlegme, daily, and
a hot humour being more fluid and being fit
for motion as yellow Choler, <U+017F>hould every other
day onely excite a feaveri<U+017F>h Ebullition in the
Blood; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> how intermitting Feavers may

            <p>The rea<U+017F>on of this Opinion is this, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
con<U+017F>idered the parts of the whole Body of
man, which by intervals only may tran<U+017F>mit the
Cau<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Feavers to the heart, none can be
found in the whole body to which not only the
Focus of intermitting Feavers, but al<U+017F>o the cau<U+017F>es
of all their <U+017F>ymptomes may be imputed be<U+017F>ides

            <p>But <U+017F>ome perhaps may <U+017F>ay, that heat, thir<U+017F>t,

tertain Feavers do declare the bile to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
offended, wherefore the Cau<U+017F>e of all
intermitting Feavers ought not to be a<U+017F>cribed
to the pancreas alone.</p>
            <p>But truly this objection will fall of its own

<U+017F>peak of in the following Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e concerning
the Rea<U+017F>ons of divers Symptomes; for we
know that in tertians the bile is very often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant,
but it is to be noted that its abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
doth not cau<U+017F>e an intermitting Feaver;
becau<U+017F>e that is perceived after it hath excited a

in one or more of the Lateral Ducts; becau<U+017F>e

this Phlegmatick Matter, together with
the re<U+017F>t of the Blood, is driven to the Pancreas;

            <p>VVe think the acce<U+017F><U+017F>es of intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,

            <p>That Coagulation, which we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

Dog, being placed before the Fire, between

that the Coagulation of the Pancreatick

The Pancreatick Juyce, being <U+017F>tagnant in

a greater Acidity of the Pancreatick

For, every heat, di<U+017F><U+017F>ipating the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
cau<U+017F>eth every <U+017F>harp thing to be more
<U+017F>harp: So that, it ought to <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange to

But the Pancreatick Juyce, being made more
<U+017F>harp by <U+017F>tagnation, and effu<U+017F>ed into the thin
Gut, with the Flegmme and Bile, <U+017F>tirs up a

<U+017F>ence of Cold, e<U+017F>pecially in the Region of the
Loynes, in which the Fit begins. Neither is

Contraction of it <U+017F>elf. But we judge that the
Pancreatick Juyce, by its acid Acrimony, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
this thing; although nothing hinders, but
that <U+017F>omething of a Saline Acrimony, ari<U+017F>ing

every fourth or fifth day, and that <U+017F>o certain as
the hand of a Dial goes not more exactly?
We <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay that all the diver<U+017F>ity depends,
partly upon the diver<U+017F>ity of ob<U+017F>tructing phlegm,
partly that of the <U+017F>tagnant Pancreatick Juice, for
as there is found in the lateral Duct ob<U+017F>tructed
more or le<U+017F>s pituity, and as it is more or le<U+017F>s
vi<U+017F>cid, and the Pancreatick Juice more or le<U+017F>s
<U+017F>harp, <U+017F>o the pituity cau<U+017F>ing the ob<U+017F>truction,
will <U+017F>ooner or later be perforated by the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratick
juice being made <U+017F>harp by <U+017F>tagnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And although the beginnings of fits mutually
following one another, are not always di<U+017F>tant
24. 48. or 72. houres; but <U+017F>ometimes 18,
<U+017F>ometimes 24, <U+017F>ometimes 30, <U+017F>ometimes 36,
and 40 Houres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neverthele<U+017F>s Phi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
are wont to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the fits according
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64159:83"/>
to daies; <U+017F>o that by quotidians they intend not
only tho<U+017F>e which return every 24. houres, but
the<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o which make their acce<U+017F><U+017F>es in 18. yea,
30 houres; the former of which they call Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents
or going before, the later po<U+017F>t-ponents.
[which word is generally under<U+017F>tood] So tho<U+017F>e
fits which return every 48. houres are truly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teemed
for tertians, but not tho<U+017F>e only; for
they al<U+017F>o which are returned every 36. or 40.
houres are called tertians, but anteponents, as
al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e which are repeated every 50. 55. or
60. houres are called Tertians, and likewi<U+017F>e
Po<U+017F>t-ponents.</p>
            <p>The Cau<U+017F>e of this inequallity of the fits,
<U+017F>eems to us to proceed from the ob<U+017F>tructing
phlegme being more or le<U+017F>s vi<U+017F>cid, or the whole
Pancreatick Juice more or le<U+017F>s <U+017F>harp, and that
by rea<U+017F>on of the diver<U+017F>e u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ix Non-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
            <p>By this rea<U+017F>on it is not difficult to us to
unfold how Quotidian feavers are changed into
Tertians, and Tertians into Quartans, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
into Quintans, and the contrary; which
thing they find very difficult, who determine
that Quotidians ari<U+017F>e from Phlegme, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
from Yellow Choler, and Quartans from
Melancholy.</p>
            <p>The Fits return <U+017F>o long, as the ob<U+017F>tructing
Pituity is not totally removed from the Duct,
but remaining therein is again compelled to
renew the Ob<U+017F>truction; But when the Vi<U+017F>cid
Phlegme, either of its own accord, or by art,
is <U+017F>o evacuated, that nothing thereof remains,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64159:84"/>
which may be joyned together, whereby the
ob<U+017F>truction may be renewed; then al<U+017F>o the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are Cured. But as often as only one of
the Lateral Ducts is ob<U+017F>tructed, <U+017F>o often is one,
and indeed a <U+017F>imple Feaver, produced. But as
often, as many of the Lateral Ducts are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructed
together, <U+017F>o often are many and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
Compound Feavers produced; which
are either of the <U+017F>ame, or of a diver<U+017F>e Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
Ob<U+017F>tructions are of the <U+017F>ame Species,
when they are of the <U+017F>ame Nature, and Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
in diver<U+017F>e Ducts of the <U+017F>ame Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
Ob<U+017F>tructions are of a diver<U+017F>e Species,
when they are of a diver<U+017F>e Nature, and Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
in diver<U+017F>e Ducts, in like manner diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from one another in Magnitude. We <U+017F>ay
in diver<U+017F>e Ducts of the <U+017F>ame, or a diver<U+017F>e Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
<U+017F>eeing that as often as the Ob<U+017F>tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ari<U+017F>eth from a like Pituity, in diver<U+017F>e Ducts,
of the <U+017F>ame Magnitude, and Amplitude: So
often the Pancreatick Juyce, being made <U+017F>harp
by <U+017F>tagnation, will, in an equal <U+017F>pace of time,
perforate the ob<U+017F>tructing Pituity; and al<U+017F>o, in
an equal <U+017F>pace of time, will produce the Fit:
But as often as Ducts, of a different Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and Amplitude, are equally ob<U+017F>tructed
by a Vi<U+017F>cid Phlegme, <U+017F>o often <U+017F>hall we <U+017F>ee a
Diver<U+017F>ity in the Fits; in as much, as it may
<U+017F>ooner, and more amply, wax <U+017F>harp, in one
Duct, and thence the Fit may <U+017F>ooner return,
and more grievou<U+017F>ly afflict than in another;
or as often as ob<U+017F>tructions do happen in Ducts,
of the <U+017F>ame Magnitude, from a Pituity, not
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64159:84"/>
alike Vi<U+017F>cid; <U+017F>o often, like-wi<U+017F>e, may the Fits
invade the Sick at divers times; for as much as
the Pancreatick Juyce, equally waxing <U+017F>harp,
will <U+017F>ooner perforate the le<U+017F>s vi<U+017F>cid pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than that which hath a greater Vi<U+017F>cidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>From tho<U+017F>e things, which we have now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
it will not be difficult to explain,
How in a double Tertian, or other Compound
Feavers, one Fit may, unexpectedly, come in
an Hour or two, after another: For, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructions
may happen in Ducts of the <U+017F>ame
Magnitude, from a Pituity alike Vi<U+017F>cid; <U+017F>o
that, one ob<U+017F>truction may be excited the fir<U+017F>t
Hour, and another the fourth Hour; the
which, if in Tertians, (unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome fault, as we
have <U+017F>aid, be committed in the <U+017F>ix Non naturals)
the fir<U+017F>t will again return on the third day, the
fir<U+017F>t hour, and the <U+017F>econd at the fourth Hour,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which, in our judgement, affords no
<U+017F>mall difficulty to tho<U+017F>e who hold, that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Feavers, are brought to a Turge<U+017F>cency,
by Conge<U+017F>tion, from an evil habit of the
Blood, or of the Alimentary Juyce, depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
as for example, <U+017F>eeing that the Alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Juyce, depraved, doth excite, by its Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>cency,
a feaveri<U+017F>h Efferve<U+017F>cency in the Blood,
in the fir<U+017F>t Hour, Why may not that Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the (depraved) Alimentary Juyce,
<U+017F>erving to produce another Fit, which like-wi<U+017F>e
begins to <U+017F>well, in the <U+017F>ame Blood, being in
the <U+017F>ame Efferve<U+017F>cency, be enkindled, and con<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?
Truly, we favour not that Opinion;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64159:85"/>
neither al<U+017F>o, can wee conceive how, in tho<U+017F>e
which are fa<U+017F>ting, the Feaveri<U+017F>h Fits <U+017F>o often,
beyond mea<U+017F>ure, could be returned at the <U+017F>ame
time.</p>
            <p>From what hath been <U+017F>aid, the rea<U+017F>on is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o
manife<U+017F>t, wherefore in a double Tertian, or
Quartane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the fit doth preci<U+017F>ely antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,
or <U+017F>ucceed, an Hour; no other-wi<U+017F>e,
than as they ari<U+017F>e from one, and the <U+017F>ame, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Duct: For, as the whole Pancreatick
Juyce, and the ob<U+017F>tructing Pituity of both,
grows more or le<U+017F>s <U+017F>harp; al<U+017F>o, the Pituity of
both, more or le<U+017F>s Vi<U+017F>cid: the Fits of both
do equally return <U+017F>ooner or later. There are
Feavers, who<U+017F>e Species by <U+017F>ome, are difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed; as for example, a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian,
from a double Tertian, or Triple Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
for, of tho<U+017F>e three Feavers, each dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excite one Fit; which di<U+017F>tinction, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s
creates no trouble to <U+017F>uch as are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to the matter: For, a Quotidian doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
invade the Sick, either at one Hour, or
equally <U+017F>ooner, or later. The double Tertian,
for the mo<U+017F>t part, <U+017F>o hath its Fits, that the
fir<U+017F>t acce<U+017F>s an<U+017F>wers to the third, and the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to the fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in a Triple
Quartan, the fir<U+017F>t Fit an<U+017F>wereth to the

<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which things being rightly Con<U+017F>idered, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

either in whole or in part. The diver<U+017F>ity of
tho<U+017F>e Symptomes <U+017F>o variou<U+017F>ly occurring, doth
not overthrow tho<U+017F>e things which we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
concerning intermitting Feavers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially
of heat and cold <U+017F>eeing that diver<U+017F>ity
dependeth upon a diver<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>titution, of the
re<U+017F>t of the Humours exi<U+017F>tent in the Body. For
otherwi<U+017F>e a fit of a tertian Feaver, happening
to a Body repleni<U+017F>hed with much Bile, and that
<U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>harp, would la<U+017F>t far longer than a
fit happening to that Body where but little bile,
and that as yet temperate is remaining. Al<U+017F>o
a greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er quantity of phlegme, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
plenty of other humours abounding in the
body, may not a little augment this diver<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>But becau<U+017F>e it may not <U+017F>uffice to have <U+017F>aid,
that the primary Symptomes of intermitting
Feavers are heat and cold, it behoveth that we
here al<U+017F>o, annex our Opinion concerning their
Cau<U+017F>e and Original We Judge that the cold
of intermitting Feavers, draws its Original
from the more acid Pancreatick Juice, and heat
e<U+017F>pecially from a more acrimonions Bile; the
former is evinced by the a<U+017F><U+017F>umption of acid
things, as <hi>Galen</hi> proveth in a thou<U+017F>and places
from things helping and hurting, that acids are
cold, and do produce cold, and that not only in
the <U+017F>ick, but al<U+017F>o in the <U+017F>ound; in which <U+017F>ometimes
we <U+017F>ee alike Cold to have been excited, as tho<U+017F>e
which are feaveri<U+017F>h are wont to <U+017F>uffer, and any
one may ob<U+017F>erve, if acids be taken by tho<U+017F>e
which are feaveri<U+017F>h in the time of the cold fit,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64159:86"/>
that the feaveri<U+017F>h cold will be encrea<U+017F>ed after a
wonderful manner. He that refu<U+017F>eth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the<U+017F>e our ob<U+017F>ervations, let him read <hi>Galen</hi>
De Simp. Med. Facult, where he <U+017F>aith:
<q>Every Acid, as it is only acid, is plainly cold; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it, neither may any thing be prefer'd before it;
for its Acrimony, you <U+017F>hall find this Juice alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
cooling, &amp;c.</q>  as al<U+017F>o in the <U+017F>ame Book
<hi>Cap.</hi> 7. and in infinite other places he teacheth,
that Acids are cold, and produce cold in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>That the qualities of Humours are to be

Know that the chief Forces of Humours

Although no man perhaps can ea<U+017F>ily deny,
heat to proceed from the Bile, in regard we
<U+017F>ee that our natural heat is much augmented
by the a<U+017F><U+017F>umption of bitter, and aromatick
Aliments and Sauces, augmenting Choler and
making it more <U+017F>harp. Be<U+017F>ides, both is proved
by the Remedies exhibited, dimini<U+017F>hing or
taking away tho<U+017F>e Symptomes; For we <U+017F>ee
clearly, that by medicines infringing the Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
the Cold is attempered and taken away;
and we likewi<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>erve that by medicines tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
the Bile, e<U+017F>pecially Acids, the heat is
le<U+017F><U+017F>ened, as we <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ently in many things
further Demon<U+017F>trate.</p>
            <p>From whence every one may ea<U+017F>ily imagine
the Rea<U+017F>on, why for the mo<U+017F>t part the fits of
intermitting Feavers, are begun with a <U+017F>ence
of Cold, and terminated with heat: For the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice being made more <U+017F>harp by <U+017F>tagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in one or more of the lateral Ducts; after
which flowing into the thin Gut, there exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<U+017F>uch an efferve<U+017F>cency with the Bile,
wherein the <hi>Succus Pancreaticus</hi> by its predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
Acidity every way emits or <U+017F>ends forth
acid Exhalations, affected with a <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of
Cold; which when they touch the Gall-bladder
by their acrimony provoke it to its Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from whence the Bile breaking forth into
the Inte<U+017F>tine, in a more than u<U+017F>ual quantity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmes
the Pancreatick Juice, and rai<U+017F>eth
therewith <U+017F>uch an Efferve<U+017F>cency, in which the
Bile predominating Excites heat, by <U+017F>ending
every way its exhalations or Emi<U+017F><U+017F>aries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:64159:87"/>
This our Opinion, is in a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
confirmed by the Vomitings, which very
often happen to the Sick, at one time <U+017F>o cold
and Acid, that bringeth a <U+017F>tupor to the Teeth;
and again on the contrary, another while <U+017F>o
hot and bitter, that they believe they Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nothing but pure Choler.</p>
            <p>But <U+017F>ome perhaps may ask, why we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Vomitings and acid belchings, rather
from the Pancreas, than from the Stomach?
We an<U+017F>wer, becau<U+017F>e it is agreeable to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the Pancreatick Juice is Acid, and
<U+017F>eeing that the <U+017F>earchers of Nature, do as
yet di<U+017F>pute concerning the ferment of the
Stomach and its Generation, we judged
that it ought to be determined, rather from
a certain than an uncertain Cau<U+017F>e: And if it
<U+017F>hall be evinced by further <U+017F>earch in the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
of Men (we <U+017F>peak not of Birds who
require a <U+017F>tronger fermentation to dige<U+017F>t
Stones and other things of a hard con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tency
for the Generation of Shells) that any other
ferment is generated, be<U+017F>ides the Spittle conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<U+017F>wallowed, and that to be Acid, then <U+017F>hall
we be <U+017F>o much the better able to prove an Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>cency
to be excited in the thin Gut, between
the Bile, and the Pancreatick Juice: Seeing that
the Temperate, or Natural Acidity of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce, would be helped by the acid
Ferment of the Stomach; and from thence, the
Efferve<U+017F>cency would be the more powerfully
performed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:64159:87"/>
It is further proved, that the Acidity, ca<U+017F>t
forth by Vomitting, doth not proceed from
the Stomach, but from the Inte<U+017F>tines, by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitories,
exhibited out of the time of the Fit;
by the help whereof, fir<U+017F>t an in<U+017F>ipid Matter,
afterwards, by further <U+017F>training, an Acid, and
Bilious Matter, is vomitted up; the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of which would happen, if the Soure, and
Cholerick Matter, did proceed from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
Concerning the manner by which Acids
may get to the Stomach, no man, of a <U+017F>ound
mind, will doubt, who determines the Bile,
ejected by Vomiting, to proceed from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>tines:
Seeing that the Pancreatick Juyce
may, and ought to be driven through the <U+017F>ame
wayes, as the Bile, flowing to the Inte<U+017F>tines, by
their inverted Peri<U+017F>taltick Motion, with the
<U+017F>ame ea<U+017F>e to the Ventricle, as we have above
demon<U+017F>trated.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the place a little confirm this
our Opinion, in which, a Feaveri<U+017F>h fit begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
is for the mo<U+017F>t part perceived Cold,
then Hot; as al<U+017F>o, a mo<U+017F>t fierce pain: We
under<U+017F>tand the Region of the Loynes, in which
the fir<U+017F>t part of the thin Gut lies, under the
Me<U+017F>entery, as is to be <U+017F>een <hi>Tab.</hi> I, wherein
the Conf<U+017F>ux and Efferve<U+017F>cency of the Bile, and
the Pancreatick Juyce, is Celebrated; from
which, the Particles of tho<U+017F>e Humours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
agitated upon the Ligaments of the Me<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and other Nervous, and Membranous parts,
they da<U+017F>h again<U+017F>t them, with an Impetuous
force: So that, that Efferve<U+017F>cency may <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64159:88"/>
be perceived by the Touch in the Sick,
as we have above demon<U+017F>trated. Nor does
the Pancreatick Juyce, being made <U+017F>harp by
<U+017F>tagnation, only exerci<U+017F>e a tyranny, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Loynes; but al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ends forth its
acid Exhalations, both upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
Who doubteth that from the one the
Torments of the Belly, and from the other Acid
belchings, do proceed? But if tho<U+017F>e Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
penetrate through the Venae Lacteae, to
the Heart, by Incra<U+017F><U+017F>ating the Blood, gives
an occa<U+017F>ion of a le<U+017F><U+017F>er Pul<U+017F>e; which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s,
by its corroding Acrimony, produceth
one more frequent. The Acid Exhalations,
being <U+017F>ubdued in manner afore-<U+017F>aid, Salt and
Bilious Exhalations do follow; which again,
by attenuating the Blood, do no le<U+017F>s excite a
great, and <U+017F>ometimes al<U+017F>o, a more frequent
Pul<U+017F>e, by irritating the Heart; and that <U+017F>o
long till their Acrimony being <U+017F>pent, they can
no longer irritate, or provoke the Heart:
Which done, the Vigour and Natural pul<U+017F>e of
the Heart is returned: So that, very often the
mo<U+017F>t skilful can hardly judge, whether they have
a Feaver or no.</p>
            <p>We will not here <U+017F>peak (le<U+017F>t this Chapter

mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uccesfully performed, fir<U+017F>t by Medicines
inciding and attenuating tough Phlegme, and
<U+017F>ometimes expelling it from the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By adhibiting Remedies, which

the le<U+017F><U+017F>er, Syrup of Carduus Benedict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>

do then with a far more happy Succe<U+017F>s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve
that for which they are Admini<U+017F>tred, than
if they were exhibited at any other time;
the Rea<U+017F>on of which <U+017F>eemes to us, becau<U+017F>e
tho<U+017F>e Medicines begin to operate at that
time, wherein the Pancreatick Juice by its
Acrimony doth molifie the Ob<U+017F>truction, and
<U+017F>o by a united force, may more <U+017F>trongly and
more happily di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the Ob<U+017F>truction, than
if either of tho<U+017F>e only were opperating:
Moreover, It very much dimini<U+017F>heth the Feave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>h
Cold, which as yet would be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with greater <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, if to the mixture
even now de<U+017F>cribed, you <U+017F>hall add a drop
or two of Oyl of Cloves, becau<U+017F>e as yet we
<U+017F>ee no medicament that doth more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
take away Cold than that Oyle.</p>
            <p>If a great Heat follow the feaveri<U+017F>h Cold,
to attemper that Medicines called Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raters,
among which aqueous things diluting

For as Doctor <hi>Minrotus</hi> <U+017F>aith <hi>pag.</hi> 36. in
his Treati<U+017F>e of Malignant Feavers, <hi>Acids do

            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> De Victu Acutor. <hi>Text.</hi>
29. 9. manife<U+017F>tly Teacheth that Acids do
infringe and mitigate the Bile. And this is the
Rea<U+017F>on, why the mo<U+017F>t skilfulle<U+017F>t Phy<U+017F>itians do
daily pre<U+017F>cribe Acid Julips for the temperating
of that feveri<U+017F>h Heat; as for Example, by
the Decoction of Barley, or coolling di<U+017F>tilled
Waters with Syrup of Limmons, Mulberies,
or Barberies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By adding Spirit of Vitriol,
Oyl of Sulpher <hi>per Capanum,</hi> or other Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in a <U+017F>ufficient quantity to give it a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Acidity. For the <U+017F>ame end they al<U+017F>o
<U+017F>ometimes pre<U+017F>cribe Apozems of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Roots, the Herb Sorrel, Lettice, the
greater Hou<U+017F>leek, Tamarinds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by adding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the boyling, <U+017F>ome Acid Syrrups, and an acid
Spirit <U+017F>ufficient for a grateful Acidity, that
the <U+017F>ick may now and then take a <U+017F>mall
Draught thereof to temperate the Heat.</p>
            <p>If a great Thir<U+017F>t afflict the Feaveri<U+017F>h at the
time of Heat, half a Dram of <hi>Lap. Prunella</hi>
may be conveniently di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid
Apozeme, or in <U+017F>mall Ale, or in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Julip, for it excellently extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>heth
Thir<U+017F>t; and therefore tho<U+017F>e to whom
Drink is hurtful, may di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the <U+017F>ame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament
in Water, but in a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
to wa<U+017F>h the Mouth. Here it is well
to be noted, that at the time of the Heat,
it is not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that the Sick <U+017F>hould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tain
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64159:90"/>
from moderate Drinking, which at the
time of Cold is altogether required; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
we daily <U+017F>ee, that if Drink be a<U+017F><U+017F>umed at
the time of the Cold fit, that it is augmented,
and the Sick more troubled.</p>
            <p>If the Medicaments, even now mentioned for
Example, do not take away the Feaver, in the
Intervals wherein they are not vexed with
the Feaver, this following mixture will much
avail. <hi>R. Fennel Water three Ounces, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Treacle Water <U+017F>ix Drams, di<U+017F>tilled Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
three Drams, Crabs Eyes prepared half
a Dram, Syrup of the five opening Roots, half
an Ounce mixt.</hi> Of which mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>imple mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
let one <U+017F>poonful be taken every two
houres; for altering Medicines do operate
far better if they be taken by Intervals, then
if they be taken abundantly together and at
once. If vehement Paines and Watchings
do accompany the Feaver, Mixtures are to
be u<U+017F>ed in the Intervals, to which is added,
one Grain of <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament
we do believe hath al<U+017F>o a force of
temperating the accimony of the Humours,
becau<U+017F>e we <U+017F>ee that Paines ari<U+017F>ing from the
Acrimony of Humours, remain not after Sleep
procured by the prudent a<U+017F><U+017F>umption of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum
Opiat;</hi> which in our Opinion could
not happen, if that <hi>Laudanum</hi> had not a force
of temperating <U+017F>harp Humours.</p>
            <p>If a pain of the Head accompany the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
in <U+017F>tead of fennel water, that of betto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or burrage, may be <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tituted; and in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64159:90"/>
place of the Syrup of the five Roots, Syrup
of <hi>Diacodium,</hi> or white Poppies. But if the
Stomach be evilly affected, Water of Mint or of
Carduus Benedictus will be u<U+017F>ed with better
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. If the men<U+017F>es flow not, Water of
Peniroyal, Syrup of Mugwort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be
exhibited. If a <U+017F>uffocation of the Womb be
pre<U+017F>ent, in <U+017F>tead of tho<U+017F>e, may be added
Spirit of <hi>Sal Ammoniack, Tinct</hi> of Ca<U+017F>tor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
if the Sick be tormented with flatulencies,
Spirit of Nitre may be added; which reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
doth greatly help tho<U+017F>e which are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with a collick Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or any other
flatulent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; e<U+017F>pecially if <U+017F>ome Drops
thereof be prudently mixed with <U+017F>ome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick
Waters, and the afore<U+017F>aid Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives.
If the Appetite be pro<U+017F>trate by
Rea<U+017F>on of too great a quantity of Bile car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the Stomach, which will be known by
the Appetite <U+017F>uddenly De<U+017F>troyed, by bitter
Belchings and Cholerick Vomitings, two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Elixir <hi>Proprietatis Paracel<U+017F>i</hi> may be
added to the la<U+017F>t mixture. But if the <U+017F>aid
evil proceedeth from a vicid pituity detained
in the Stomach, which will be known by an
aggravated pain in the Stomach, half a Dram
of the dulcid Spirit of Salt in<U+017F>tead of Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir
<hi>Proprietatis</hi> will be more Conducent if it
be mixed with the fore<U+017F>aid mixture.</p>
            <p>To the <U+017F>ame intent may be directed al<U+017F>o

            <p>I Have taken notice of many People (e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of the Poorer <U+017F>ort) who are afflicted with
tedious Agues, and many more, who labour
under tho<U+017F>e Deplorable Fits, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Fits of the Mother, and Spleen; as al<U+017F>o,
the Falling Sickne<U+017F>s, Grievous Convul<U+017F>ions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And being well <U+017F>atisfied, (as well by the means of
Curation, as the undenyable Experiments, and
valid Rea<U+017F>ons in this Book, confirming the <U+017F>ame)
that tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, with many more, derive
their Original from the Vitious Alteration of
this Juyce, of the Sweet-Bread: I, for the <U+017F>ake
of poor People, that they might have help at an
ea<U+017F>ie Rate, hereby let them know, that (among<U+017F>t
many other) I have two Medicines, which are
certain in the Cure of the fore-mentioned Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es.
The one will di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the Conjunct Matter
of all Ague-Fits, with great Celerity; it being
of <U+017F>uch Subtile Parts, that it quickly penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
and openeth tho<U+017F>e Ob<U+017F>tructions in the Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Branches of the Pancreas, or Sweet-Bread,
from whence tho<U+017F>e Agues proceed. The which
Medicine alone (with the help of a proper Purge,
to carry off the Matter after it is di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, and
attenuated) will, in a <U+017F>hort time, Cure the Fits
of any Ague what<U+017F>oever. It is put up in Gla<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
<pb facs="tcp:64159:92"/>

Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e being <U+017F>ufficient for the Cure of an Ague
that is but of a <U+017F>hort Continuance.</p>
            <p>The other Medicine is a Specifick Remedy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
