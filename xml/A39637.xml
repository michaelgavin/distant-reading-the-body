         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Shall have all the Rea<U+017F>on

of the Inju<U+017F>tice of
the Public, if my Charitable
De<U+017F>ign in Publi<U+017F>hing this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Treati<U+017F>e be look'd upon as
an effect of my Vanity, or
an Arrogant Undertaking to
pre<U+017F>cribe Rules to Phy<U+017F>icians.
I am <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the va<U+017F>t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
we owe for
<pb facs="tcp:40916:3"/>
the daily and important di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
they make in that
u<U+017F>eful Art; and that they do
not <U+017F>tand in need of any
Light to direct 'em, but what
they acquire by their own
Experience and Studies. I
never entertain'd a Thought
of controverting the ju<U+017F>t
Right they are po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of,
to give Laws to the re<U+017F>t of
Mankind; nor was ever
guilty of the lea<U+017F>t Intention
to di<U+017F><U+017F>wade my Readers from
following the In<U+017F>tructions of
their lawful Guides: My on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
De<U+017F>ign was to <U+017F>erve the
Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities of tho<U+017F>e, who,
tho' they are not profe<U+017F>s'd

are neither too <U+017F>crupulou<U+017F>ly

'tis eertain that the two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ite

is a certain Principle, which is the cau<U+017F>e of
all their Actions, ju<U+017F>t as the Wheels of a
Watch make it point out and <U+017F>trike the Hours;
for, according to the Moderns, Bea<U+017F>ts are
nothing but a <U+017F>ort of Clock-Work, or meer
Machines: But this Opinion begins to lo<U+017F>e
Ground, as well as others.</p>
                     <p>This being premis'd, we may define the
In<U+017F>tinct of Animals to be a Power of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting;
which is, as it were, the Cau<U+017F>e of the
Actions that contribute to their Pre<U+017F>ervation,
which we commonly a<U+017F>cribe to their In<U+017F>tinct
And may not Man then have <U+017F>uch a Principle,
which in him may be the Cau<U+017F>e of the like
Actions? if we con<U+017F>ider him purely as an
Animal, for, <hi>Ab<U+017F>trahentium non e<U+017F>t mendaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
<U+017F>ay the Philo<U+017F>ophers, we may pre<U+017F>ume
that Man, as well as the Bea<U+017F>ts, acts by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinct
for his own Pre<U+017F>ervation.</p>
                     <p>Rea<U+017F>on and Experience confirm this Truth;
for it cannot be deny'd, that Man in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
while Rea<U+017F>on is clogg'd and ob<U+017F>cur'd
by the Imperfections of the Organs of his
Body, does many things which are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to him, and which can not proceed
but from that Principle which is common
to him with the Bea<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>ince at that time he
has no u<U+017F>e of his Rea<U+017F>on; for we find that
an Infant, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as 'tis born, applies it <U+017F>elf
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40916:13"/>
to the Nipple which is pre<U+017F>ented to it by the
Mother or Nur<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ucks out the Milk,
without con<U+017F>idering that it wants it for its
Nouri<U+017F>hment. And <U+017F>oon after, when the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of his Sen<U+017F>es are <U+017F>trengthen'd, and when
he begins to fix his Eyes upon <U+017F>uch Objects
as pre<U+017F>ent them<U+017F>elves to his <U+017F>ight, do not we
<U+017F>ee that he endeavours to avoid tho<U+017F>e that
are di<U+017F>agreeable to him; that he cries and
is troubled when an unknown or deform'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
takes him out of his Nur<U+017F>e's Arms?
And is it not plain that the<U+017F>e are the Effects
of In<U+017F>tinct, <U+017F>ince Bea<U+017F>ts do the <U+017F>ame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Light of Rea<U+017F>on.</p>
                     <p>But we are not only guided by In<U+017F>tinct
during our Infancy, for we are <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it

endow'd with a healthy and <U+017F>trong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution;

<U+017F>ick, and enjoy but very little Health.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a great Advantage to be naturally
well-di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed both in Body and Mind; for
<U+017F>uch a Per<U+017F>on may enjoy a perfect Health
by leading a regular Life: But when one is
naturally of an ill Con<U+017F>titution, he lo<U+017F>es his

Of the bad Effects which it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
both in the Body and Mind;
and of its Remedies.</head>
                           <p>THere are very few Per<U+017F>ons who are not
acquainted with Melancholy, either by
Rea<U+017F>on or Experience, <U+017F>ince the Life of Man
is a continual Revolution of Pro<U+017F>perity and
Adver<U+017F>ity; and the Oppo<U+017F>itions betwixt
tho<U+017F>e two Conditions, excite in us contrary
Motions, and very different Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. That
Tranquillity of Mind which accompanies good
Fortune, is very proper to pre<U+017F>erve the Health;
for tho' the Mind and the Body are of a
different Nature, yet they have an Affinity,
which keep 'em in <U+017F>uch Dependance one to the
other, that there is nothing regularly done in
the whole Compo<U+017F>ition, unle<U+017F>s it be carry'd
on by an equal Combination of the two
Parts.</p>
                           <p>All our Actions are perform'd by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
of the Vital and Animal Spirits; and
'tis their Commerce which maintains that
perfect Union, between the Heart and the
Brain, which are the principal Organs of the
Body. For 'tis plain that the Brain cannot
produce the Animal Spirits, unle<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ubtil
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40916:17"/>
parts of the Blood be convey'd thither through
the Arteries; and that the Heart, which is
a Mu<U+017F>cle, hath not power by its continual
Motion, to diffu<U+017F>e the Blood through the
whole Body, but by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the
Animal Spirits: Now when the Mind is
<U+017F>erene and undi<U+017F>turb'd, that all the Parts may
be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of her Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <U+017F>he furni<U+017F>hes
'em with a <U+017F>ufficient quantity of Spirits, to
enable 'em to perform their re<U+017F>pective A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                           <p>But, on the other hand, when the Mind
is agitated with a Croud of di<U+017F>mal Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ions,
that give Entrance to Grief and
Melancholy, <U+017F>he is perpetually ruminating on
the Cau<U+017F>es of her Di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters, and endeavouring
with all imaginable Application, to remove
'em, which mu<U+017F>t needs occa<U+017F>ion a va<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of Spirits. So that all the Animal
Spirits which are generated in the Brain, are
<U+017F>carce able to <U+017F>upply tho<U+017F>e Parts which are
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient to the de<U+017F>igns of the Soul, in
the performance of tho<U+017F>e ha<U+017F>ty Motions <U+017F>he
requires from 'em; and con<U+017F>equently <U+017F>ince
<U+017F>o large a quantity of the Spirits flows into
the Nerves, that are be<U+017F>tow'd upon tho<U+017F>e
Parts, there are but few left for the other
Nerves: Now the Parts which help to change
or dige<U+017F>t the Aliments, and are <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient
to all the Actions which are call'd Natural,
being of no u<U+017F>e to the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, 'tis plain
that the Nerves which go to tho<U+017F>e Parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but few Spirits from the Brain, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40916:17"/>
con<U+017F>equently that their Fibres are very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mov'd, and their Actions di<U+017F>orderly and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular;
<U+017F>o that the Excrements can hardly
be expell'd; and their too long continuance
in the Guts is the immediate Cau<U+017F>e of Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es.</p>
                           <p>We may add, that the great di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation of
the Animal Spirits, when the Soul is vex'd
and di<U+017F>turb'd, is the occa<U+017F>ion that a greater
quantity of Blood than u<U+017F>ual is <U+017F>ent from
the Heart to the Brain, to make up the Lo<U+017F>s
of tho<U+017F>e Spirits; and con<U+017F>equently the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment
of all the other Parts is both much
le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd and chang'd as to its quality. For
'tis always the be<U+017F>t part of the Blood that
runs to the Brain, and the Body is depriv'd
of its be<U+017F>t Nouri<U+017F>hment, particularly the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
Parts, which are weakned and dry'd
up, for want of fit Matter to pre<U+017F>erve them;
and this Inconveniency reaching the Inte<U+017F>tines,
as well as all the other Parts, 'tis certain that
they cannot expel the Excrements with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
by their Vermicular or Peri<U+017F>taltick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being depriv'd of the Animal Spirits,
by who<U+017F>e A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance they were moved.</p>

                           <p>For a Man who is drowned in Sorrow is
incapable of taking Plea<U+017F>ure in any thing;

'Twou'd be needle<U+017F>s then to attempt the

they cannot afterwards contract and expand
them<U+017F>elves, either to concoct the Food, or to

when the Stomach loaths any particular

may be occa<U+017F>ion'd meerly by the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the Blood, if we reflect upon the
Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the Organs which contain and
convey the Blood, and conduce to its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>In order to this we may compare the Veins
and Arteries of our Bodies to the Pipes of a
Fountain, the fir<U+017F>t of which, or tho<U+017F>e that
are next the Spring-head, are very big and
large, but grow in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly <U+017F>maller as they
<U+017F>pread them<U+017F>elves into Branches; <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing,
for Example, that the fir<U+017F>t gives pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to a
Foot of Water, and that the la<U+017F>t do not give
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to above an Inch. The <U+017F>ame Ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
may be apply'd to the Blood-Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els.</p>
                     <p>The Arteries which proceed from the Heart
are very large, and are divided into others
of a middle bigne<U+017F>s; the<U+017F>e again are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into <U+017F>maller Branches which are <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ively
<U+017F>ubdivided, till they become <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall,
that they are u<U+017F>ually call'd <hi>Capillarie</hi> (or Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like)
and <hi>Invi<U+017F>ible.</hi> And in all parts of the
Body where the<U+017F>e invi<U+017F>ible Arteries are found,
they meet with very <U+017F>mall Veins, which grow
larger as they meet, and join with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and return at length to the Heart,
where they terminate, and are as large as the
Arteries at their coming out of the Heart.
Now the Blood flows thro' all tho<U+017F>e Pipes,
and the Heart directs its Motion, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-Maker
directs that of the Water in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40916:23"/>
Pipes of the Fountain. And as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
that the Water-Pipes are either <U+017F>topt
or broken when a Body that is Bulky e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to fill up the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age enters with the
Water, or a greater quantity of Water than
they can contain; <U+017F>o the Blood-Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are
frequently ob<U+017F>tructed, and <U+017F>ometimes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
when the Liquor they contain is either

from whence proceed Fevers, Ebullitions of

Effects of the former Remedies, are al<U+017F>o
Le<U+017F><U+017F>ons which Men owe to the Brutes; and
the<U+017F>e four Expedients acting either jointly or

Means that can be made u<U+017F>e of, to hinder the

and con<U+017F>equently to prevent the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es which
proceed from <U+017F>uch Ob<U+017F>tructions.</p>
                     <p>It is ea<U+017F>ie to conceive how <hi>Ab<U+017F>tinence</hi> or a
regular <hi>Diet</hi> may contribute to the Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Excrements, if we con<U+017F>ider that
tho<U+017F>e Excrements are the remainders of our
Nouri<U+017F>hment; That the more we eat and
drink, the more Excrements are bred in tho<U+017F>e
Parts, <U+017F>o that the Evacuation of tho<U+017F>e Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
wou'd be an endle<U+017F>s Work, if the
empty'd Guts were pre<U+017F>ently fill'd with the
<U+017F>uperfluities of a greedy Stomach.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time, a Diet which is only
pre<U+017F>crib'd for prevention, ought not to be <U+017F>o
regular or thin as that which is enjoyn'd to
<U+017F>ick Per<U+017F>ons.</p>
                     <p>It is known that too nice or <U+017F>paring a Diet
is prejudicial to Health, and is <U+017F>o far from a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting
Nature in the Evacuation of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
that it renders her unable to expel
'em. Be<U+017F>ides, the Liquor which <U+017F>erves to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve
the Food, not finding Matter to work
upon, acts upon the parts that contain and
receive it, by drying and con<U+017F>uming them.</p>

                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40916:29"/>
It may be further added, that a Man who
takes Phy<U+017F>ick only for prevention, does not
ab<U+017F>tain from Labour and Exerci<U+017F>e, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<U+017F>tands in need of Nouri<U+017F>hment to repair
the expence of his Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, to prevent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, one ought
only to fa<U+017F>t moderately; at the <U+017F>ame time
he ought to avoid as much as he can, eating
in Company, becau<U+017F>e People are u<U+017F>ually wont
to eat a little more than is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides,
he ought to chu<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch Aliments as will
leave but few Excrements in the Body; and
e<U+017F>pecially he mu<U+017F>t take care never to eat
to <U+017F>atiety.</p>
                     <p>The <U+017F>econd Expedient we propos'd to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Excrements, is <hi>Bleeding,</hi>
which is doubtle<U+017F>s one of the be<U+017F>t Methods that
Nature cou'd <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t to Animals; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that be<U+017F>ides that there is no Remedy which
depends more ab<U+017F>olutely upon the Plea<U+017F>ure of
the Per<U+017F>on who either orders or performs it,
<U+017F>o there is none which in mo<U+017F>t Ca<U+017F>es gives
more <U+017F>peedy relief to the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Every Surgeon knows how u<U+017F>eful Bleeding
is to put a <U+017F>top to Defluxions, and the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down of Humours, which are always
apt to fall upon wounded Parts, how effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
it is to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve large Tumours, with
which Wounds are frequently accompany'd;
how powerfully it <U+017F>tops the inordinate Flux
of Blood in the Wounds of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els;
and both Surgeons and Midwives know
how helpful it is to facilitate <U+017F>o difficult a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40916:29"/>
Work. Our Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s at pre<U+017F>ent is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how it may contribute to the Expul<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Excrements out of the Cavities of
the great Guts.</p>
                     <p>The Expul<U+017F>ion of the Excrements retain'd in
the Cavities of the great Guts, is perform'd
chiefly by the Contraction of its moving Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by tho<U+017F>e of the Mu<U+017F>cles of
the lower Belly, and by the continual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>piration
which obliges the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> to
pre<U+017F>s all the Guts. All the<U+017F>e Actions are
perform'd by means of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which upon <U+017F>uch Occa<U+017F>ions flow plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to the Parts which are the Organs of
the<U+017F>e Actions. Now the<U+017F>e Spirits are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated, and that expence mu<U+017F>t be
repair'd by the Blood of which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
provided there be a rea<U+017F>onable quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els which are appointed to
contain it; for when there is a Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
of Blood, the Spirits are as it were
<U+017F>uffocated and drown'd in the abundance of
their Matter; <U+017F>o that the be<U+017F>t Office we can
do to Nature on <U+017F>uch Occa<U+017F>ions, is, by Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to reduce the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood to a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
quantity, in order to ea<U+017F>e her of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
Burthen which ob<U+017F>tructs the liberty
of her Actions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bleeding</hi> ought always to precede <hi>Purgations</hi>
when both the<U+017F>e Remedies are indicated by
the <U+017F>igns of a Redundancy, exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive Heat, or
Corruption of the Blood: For we find by
Experience that <hi>Purgatives</hi> operate both more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40916:30"/>
gently and effectually, when the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are
empty'd, and the exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive heat of the Blood
allay'd, and its Depravation corrected by
<hi>Bleeding.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis further ob<U+017F>ervable, that we ought
rather to bleed early in the Morning, than
at any other Hour of the Day; and that
when we are oblig'd to have recour<U+017F>e to
this Remedy in very hot Weather, we ought
to be let Blood before the Ri<U+017F>ing, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Setting of the Sun; and in very cold
Weather, at Noon: But, in the general, we
ought to avoid Bleeding as much as we
can, when the Sea<U+017F>on is either exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively
hot or cold; for 'tis certain that Bleeding is
always attended with better Succe<U+017F>s when the<U+017F>e
Cautions are ob<U+017F>erv'd than when they are
neglected,</p>
                     <p>With re<U+017F>pect to the Age of the Patient, we
ought to bleed Infants le<U+017F>s frequently, and to
take le<U+017F>s Blood from them than from other
Per<U+017F>ons, becau<U+017F>e a great part of their Blood is
con<U+017F>um'd in the Nouri<U+017F>hment and Growth
of their Body in all its Dimen<U+017F>ions: So
that from <U+017F>ix Weeks or two Months after
the birth of an Infant, which is the time
at which we may begin to let him Blood,
if there be a pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing Occa<U+017F>ion, to the
Age of five or <U+017F>ix Years, I wou'd not take
away more than from three to <U+017F>ix Ounces of
Blood: From <U+017F>ix to ten or twelve Years,
you may take <U+017F>ix or eight Ounces: From
twelve to fifteen, and <U+017F>o to fifty, you mu<U+017F>t
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40916:30"/>
ob<U+017F>erve the Signs of Repletion, and the
Strength of the Patient, and accordingly you
may take away from nine to twelve or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Ounces of Blood.</p>
                     <p>After fifty Years of Age, we mu<U+017F>t be more
cautious and moderate both as to the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Bleeding, and the quantity of Blood we
take away, for fear of cau<U+017F>ing too great a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ipation
of the Spirits, which from that Age to
extreme old Age are daily decaying both in
Quantity and Quality.</p>
                     <p>The vi<U+017F>ible Signs of a Redundancy of Blood
in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, are the large or frequent Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations
of it by the No<U+017F>e, or other parts of
the Body, the <U+017F>welling or di<U+017F>ten<U+017F>ion of the
Veins, Boils, Pimples, or other Eruptions, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Ebullitions or Flu<U+017F>hings towards the
Skin, <hi>Ery<U+017F>ipela's,</hi> Inflammations of the Eyes
and Throat, a continual de<U+017F>ire to Sleep,
and a Wearine<U+017F>s and Heavine<U+017F>s of the whole
Body, not occa<U+017F>ion'd by any Labour or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Exerci<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>When you perceive all, or mo<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e
Symptoms, and when they continue for <U+017F>ome
time, you mu<U+017F>t immediately open a Vein, and
take away a large quantity of Blood; for the
<U+017F>uperfluous Blood which is not employ'd in
the Nouri<U+017F>hment of the Body if it be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated,
will <U+017F>oon putrefy, and occa<U+017F>ion a
Fever, Ob<U+017F>tructions in the <U+017F>mall Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of
the Inte<U+017F>tines, or an Accumulation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in <U+017F>ome part of the Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40916:31"/>
In fine, that we may make right u<U+017F>e of
Bleeding, we ought to con<U+017F>ider how the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
u<U+017F>ually bears it; for tho<U+017F>e who undergo it
ea<U+017F>ily, may be let Blood oftener, and more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
than tho<U+017F>e who cannot bear it without
trouble and difficulty. Thus one who commonly
finds him<U+017F>elf weak or faint after Bleeding, ought
rather to Bleed twice, and in <U+017F>mall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
than to put him<U+017F>elf in danger of fainting
or <U+017F>wooning away, by a large Evacuation:
For 'tis certain that Fainting and Swooning
do extremely di<U+017F>turb the whole Oeconomy
of the Body, notwith<U+017F>tanding the ridiculous
Opinion of tho<U+017F>e who imagine that Bleeding
can never be effectual, unle<U+017F>s it be continu'd
till the Patient faint away.</p>
                     <p>Bleeding without nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, that is, when
there is no Superfluity to be voided, no exce<U+017F>s
of Heat to be allay'd, and no Putrefaction to
be corrected, robs Nature of the pure Blood,
which is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the Nouri<U+017F>hment of the
Body, and the production of Spirits, which
are the principal In<U+017F>truments of the Soul in
all its Actions. 'Tis plain from hence, that
after <U+017F>uch unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Evacuations, Nature
acts <U+017F>lowly and feebly, that the Entrails are
heated, and that all the Parts are dry'd up,
which makes way for a long Train of Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es.
It is not therefore pertinent to u<U+017F>e Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
at all times for the pre<U+017F>ervation of our
Health: But 'tis nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary before we take 'em,

of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, if we do not take care to <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

                     <p>The Inquiry wou'd be more curious than

Di<U+017F>tempers; for as it is <U+017F>ufficient for a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
to have a Needle touch'd with a Load-Stone,
and to know that it turns always towards
a certain Pole, without being oblig'd to know
the natural Cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>o <U+017F>urprizing a <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi>
<U+017F>o 'tis al<U+017F>o enough for any Body to
know that the <U+017F>igns of which we have <U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
are <U+017F>o many Fore-runners of Di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
without troubling him<U+017F>elf to examine

is an effect of this general Cau<U+017F>e;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40916:33"/>
wherefore we are forewarn'd <U+017F>ometimes by
<U+017F>ome of them, and <U+017F>ometimes by others;
<U+017F>ometimes by one alone, and <U+017F>ometimes by
many: But it being generally known that
one or many of 'em, or this and that Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom,
are certain Marks of a Depravation
of the Health, we may chu<U+017F>e either to wait
till the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e appears, and afterwards cure
it with difficulty, or to prevent it ea<U+017F>ily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is form'd: Now 'tis mo<U+017F>t certain that
a Man <U+017F>hou'd rather be his own Phy<U+017F>ician,
while the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is yet unform'd, than to
wait till it appear, that he may avoid fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into tho<U+017F>e Extremities to which it may

impatient unea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s under the Cure, and

                     <p>From this Principle we may infer that 'tis
not only unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, but even dangerous to

on it, either good or bad: For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
the Food which we take in too great a
quantity, or which is of hard Dige<U+017F>tion,
engenders a great quantity of Crudities and
Excrements, which are, as we have already

                     <p>When we are forewarn'd of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, either
the Symptoms are many and pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, or
few and incon<U+017F>iderable: When they are many
and our In<U+017F>tinct <U+017F>eems to redouble its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
we mu<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>e no time, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Summer, and great Cold of the Winter;
when the Moon is in her Wane or Declination,
than during her Increa<U+017F>e; in Dry rather than

by voiding the greate<U+017F>t part of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

<U+017F>queez'd out of the Arteries, and the <U+017F>limy

                     <p>We mu<U+017F>t further ob<U+017F>erve, that the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Cly<U+017F>ters is very irregular; for in <U+017F>ome
Per<U+017F>ons a Cly<U+017F>ter of <hi>Oxycrate</hi> will procure
wonderful Evacuations, which in others
wou'd be altogether unprofitable; and in
<U+017F>ome the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t Cly<U+017F>ters will not produce
the lea<U+017F>t effect: And that which operates
well at one time, will not work at all at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
wherefore we mu<U+017F>t learn to prepare <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

                     <p>As for Purgatives that are taken by the Mouth,
'tis better to take them by way of <hi>Infu<U+017F>ion</hi>

infinuates it <U+017F>elf more ea<U+017F>ily into the

In order to the right u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
there are four Ob<U+017F>ervations to be
made.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fir<U+017F>t</hi> is, to take 'em by degrees, that
is, to begin with the mo<U+017F>t Mild and Simple:
But if their Weakne<U+017F>s hinder their Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we mu<U+017F>t augment the Do<U+017F>e, or take a
<U+017F>tronger Medicine, till <U+017F>uch time as the Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
be made proportionable to the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
we perceive of a greater or <U+017F>maller
fulne<U+017F>s or redundancy of Humours.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Ob<U+017F>ervation concerns the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of their Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, which is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
becau<U+017F>e they cannot remain long in
the Body without occa<U+017F>ioning a violent Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the parts they touch, which may
be attended with very dangerous Con<U+017F>equen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for a purging Medicine has almo<U+017F>t the
<U+017F>ame Operation on the parts of the Body
thro' which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es, as a Spur has upon a
Hor<U+017F>e; becau<U+017F>e as the Hor<U+017F>e goes fa<U+017F>ter when
the Rider <U+017F>purs him but once, and kicks and
winces when he keeps the Spur con<U+017F>tantly in
his Sides, <U+017F>o the Purgative by its fir<U+017F>t Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
moves the Parts thro' which 'tis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd,
to expel the Excrements that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in 'em; but when it <U+017F>tays too long,
it enflames the Parts, and renders the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
hot and dry, and con<U+017F>equently unfit for
Evacuation; <U+017F>o that its Operation is both
incon<U+017F>iderable, and extremely trouble<U+017F>ome to
the Patient.</p>
                     <p>

To avoid this Inconveniency in the u<U+017F>e of
Laxatives, they ought always to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with <U+017F>ome Vehicle, that is to <U+017F>ay, a
Sub<U+017F>tance fit to in<U+017F>inuate it <U+017F>elf into the
clo<U+017F>e<U+017F>t parts of the Body, notwith<U+017F>tanding all
the Ob<U+017F>tructions it may meet with in the
Parts that are appropriated for <U+017F>eparating the
Humours, as the Liver, Spleen, Pancreas, and
all the Entrals.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e Vehicles may be made of Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
impregnated with the <U+017F>ubtil Parts of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Plants that are proper to <U+017F>lip into the
<U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Pores of the Capillary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, as are,
for Example, the Decoctions of the Roots of
<hi>wild Succory, Strawberry-Leaves, Dog-Gra<U+017F>s,
Agrimony, Sorrel, Chervil,</hi> and many other
<hi>Herbs</hi> which are endu'd with the <U+017F>ame Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                     <p>In<U+017F>tead of the<U+017F>e Decoctions, you may u<U+017F>e
the Juice of a <hi>Limon,</hi> or <hi>Orange, Verjuice,
White-Wine, Whey,</hi> and many other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which every one may chu<U+017F>e from his
own private Experience, to facilitate the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Purgatives.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Rule to be ob<U+017F>erv'd in the u<U+017F>e
of purging Medicines, is, to chu<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch as do
not make you co<U+017F>tive after the u<U+017F>e of 'em;
for this is the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t Mark that the Phy<U+017F>ick
is proportionated to the Strength of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
on whom it works, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince 'tis
but too frequently confirm'd by Experience,
that the more violent the Medicines are, the
Patient is the more co<U+017F>tive after the u<U+017F>e of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40916:38"/>
them. One might inferr from hence, that
the <U+017F>ame thing happens on the<U+017F>e Occa<U+017F>ions to
the moving Fibres of the Inte<U+017F>tines, as to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
who being forc'd to undergo involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Labour, are <U+017F>o wearied and jaded with
their forc'd Exerci<U+017F>e, that they work no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than while the Rod is over their Heads;
<U+017F>o the Fibres of the Inte<U+017F>tines having been
too roughly and frequently <U+017F>haken by the
Operation of the Medicine, are <U+017F>o weary'd
with the<U+017F>e forc'd Contractions, that they cannot
afterwards perform the Motions that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
for the Expul<U+017F>ion of the Excrements
which gather daily in their Cavities; <U+017F>o that
we are obliged either to accu<U+017F>tom our <U+017F>elves
to Phy<U+017F>ick, or, if we neglect to u<U+017F>e it, mu<U+017F>t
expect a new Accumulation of Excrements,
which will <U+017F>oon after be the Cau<U+017F>e of a new
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>To conclude; The la<U+017F>t Ob<U+017F>ervation in the
u<U+017F>e of Purgatives relates particularly to tho<U+017F>e
weak Medicines that produce little or no
Effect, when they are often repeated in a
little time; for the moving Fibres of the
Inte<U+017F>tines are <U+017F>oon accu<U+017F>tom'd to the Impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
of <U+017F>uch Remedies, and become perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of <U+017F>uch feeble Irritations: Ju<U+017F>t
as the Organs of the Sen<U+017F>es are not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
of the Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the<U+017F>e Objects to which

                     <head type="sub">Of Purgatives, and how they operate:
Of the Time and Manner of u<U+017F>ing
them.</head>
                     <p>IT is certain that the Operation of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
de<U+017F>troys the mo<U+017F>t immediate Cau<U+017F>es
of the greate<U+017F>t part of our Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, whether
they be taken inwardly, or injected by
way of Cly<U+017F>ters.</p>
                     <p>However, it mu<U+017F>t be acknowledg'd, that
the way of admini<U+017F>tring 'em occa<U+017F>ions <U+017F>ome
difference in their Operation; for <U+017F>ince Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters
reach no further than the great Guts,
they can only facilitate the Evacuation of
the Excrements that are retain'd in tho<U+017F>e
Inte<U+017F>tines; whereas, when they are taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
they not only cau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in all the Parts which they touch, and
con<U+017F>equently by augmenting their Natural
Motion, ha<U+017F>ten the expul<U+017F>ion of the Matter
which they contain; but many of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
mingle with the Chyle in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els
which carry it to the Heart, in which, as
well as in the Arteries, they excite divers
Fermentations, that promote the <U+017F>eparation
of the different Particles of the Blood, in the
<U+017F>everal Parts of the Body where they are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40916:39"/>
u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>eparated from its Ma<U+017F>s, according
to the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition that each of tho<U+017F>e Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
has, to put certain parts of the Blood
in Motion, rather than others.</p>
                     <p>Thus we may ob<U+017F>erve that a vi<U+017F>ible Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
or Ebullition is produc'd in certain
Liquors, when they are mix'd with other
Fluids that are di<U+017F>pos'd to put 'em in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereas they remain undi<U+017F>turb'd when
they are mixt with others.</p>
                     <p>And from the Operation of Purgatives on
different parts of the Blood, there ari<U+017F>es a
di<U+017F>tinction of Names: For Example; <U+017F>ome
are call'd <U+017F>imply <hi>Purgatives,</hi> which are again
divided into <hi>Hydragogues, Cholagogues, Melana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,</hi>
and <hi>Phlegmagogues;</hi> or Medicines that
purge Watery Humours, Choler, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Phlegm: Others are call'd <hi>Emeties,
Sudorifics, Errhines, &amp;c.</hi> Now tho<U+017F>e Names
are very fitly impos'd, either with re<U+017F>pect to
the Parts of the Body thro' which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Evacuations, or to the parts of
the Blood which they are particularly apt
to put in Motion.</p>
                     <p>From hence we may ob<U+017F>erve, that all tho<U+017F>e
Remedies are endu'd with one common
Property, that is, to excite a Motion in the
Blood; and that their different ways of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
proceed only from the different Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
or Contexture of their Parts; for by
rea<U+017F>on of their peculiar Configuration, they
are more ea<U+017F>ily admitted into certain parts
of the Body than into others, and by the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40916:39"/>
Irritation they occa<U+017F>ion in the Parts, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Separation which is perform'd there,
of <U+017F>ome particular Excrements from the Blood.
And upon this Score we may rea<U+017F>onably <U+017F>ay,
that they are proper to purge <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch
Parts; as for Example, <U+017F>uch as are proper to
purge the Liver, we call <hi>Hepatics;</hi> and tho<U+017F>e
that are peculiarly adapted to the Spleen,
are term'd <hi>Splenetics.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Be<U+017F>ides, according to the various <U+017F>ituation
or contexture of their Parts, they are di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
to agitate Certain Particles of the Blood,
to which they unite <U+017F>ooner than to others:
And upon this account we may <U+017F>ay that <U+017F>uch
a Medicine is proper to purge <U+017F>uch a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                     <p>This Ob<U+017F>ervation is confirm'd by Experience,
particularly what relates to <hi>Hydragogues,</hi> or
Medicines that purge Watery Humours; for
the Evacuation of Sero<U+017F>ities is much more
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible than that of the other Particles which
compo<U+017F>e the Blood, becau<U+017F>e that which the
Purgative drives into the Inte<U+017F>tines, whether
it be <U+017F>eparated by the Glands of their inward
Membrane, or <U+017F>queez'd out of the Biliary and
Pancreatic Ducts, being mixt with the Slime
and Excrements which it finds in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tines,
it is very hard to determine what
Humour hath been chiefly wrought upon or
expell'd by the Purgative Medicine.</p>

                     <p>In fine, every Man ought to con<U+017F>ult his

which he finds to be mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>eful and

                     <p>There is one important Rule to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd
in the admini<U+017F>tring of all tho<U+017F>e Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and that is, To begin always with
the gentle<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>imple. It is certain that
when we u<U+017F>e Remedies meerly for preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we ought to be our own Phy<U+017F>icians;
for <U+017F>ince the bare Pre<U+017F>ages or Signs of a

us of the u<U+017F>e of our Rea<U+017F>on, we may
chu<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e Medicines which upon trial have
formerly <U+017F>ucceeded, and which cannot be <U+017F>o
well known by a Stranger as by our <U+017F>elves.</p>
                     <p>Be<U+017F>ides, it ought to be ob<U+017F>erv'd, that there
is nothing more various or uncertain than
the Operation of Purgatives on Humane
Bodies.</p>
                     <p>Some Per<U+017F>ons are violently purg'd by weak
Medicines, when a <U+017F>tronger Remedy wou'd
not produce the lea<U+017F>t effect upon 'em: There
are others on whom mild Phy<U+017F>ick will not
work at all, and even the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
are <U+017F>carce effectual: On the other hand,
<U+017F>ome are <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily purg'd, that a Decoction
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40916:41"/>
of Herbs will <U+017F>uffice; and to others half an
Hours Conver<U+017F>ation in an Apothecary's Shop:
Some are purg'd by <hi>Strawberries, Cherries,
Goo<U+017F>eberries, Peaches, Pears, &amp;c.</hi> Some by
<U+017F>our Milk, fre<U+017F>h Pork, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and others by a
moderate Entertainment with jovial Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
for Mirth contributes as much to the
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Excrements, as Melancholy or
Sadne<U+017F>s does to their Stoppage in the Guts.</p>
                     <p>Some are purg'd by a <U+017F>imple cooling De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
when they begin fir<U+017F>t to drink it;
and in others Cly<U+017F>ters produce a plentiful
Evacuation, tho' they are hardly mov'd by
internal Medicines.</p>
                     <p>To conclude; there is nothing le<U+017F>s regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
than the Operation of Purges on different
Bodies; and it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for the mo<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Phy<U+017F>ician in the World to di<U+017F>cover this
variety in every particular Per<U+017F>on: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as I intimated before, we ought to <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
our <U+017F>elves, that we may be able to chu<U+017F>e
out of <U+017F>o great a number of Remedies that
have been often try'd, tho<U+017F>e that are mo<U+017F>t
agreeable to our Bodies.</p>
                     <p>The gentle<U+017F>t Purges, and tho<U+017F>e that are
mo<U+017F>t agreeable to our Con<U+017F>tution, are of two

                     <p>In the mean time, 'tis certain that we ought

I an<U+017F>wer, That tho a Man goes daily and
regularly to <U+017F>tool, yet it does not follow that
he ought to be exempted from Purgation
either by Cly<U+017F>ters and Medicines, <U+017F>ince 'tis
frequently ob<U+017F>erv'd that tho<U+017F>e who go natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to <U+017F>tool every Day, do, notwith<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
perceive by the above-mention'd Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms,
that there are <U+017F>ome Excrements left
behind in tho<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages which <U+017F>erve for
their Expul<U+017F>ion: Now 'tis plain that their
Excrements mu<U+017F>t be evacuated, to prevent
the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es that proceed from the Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the<U+017F>e Impurities.</p>
                        <p>If any Per<U+017F>on de<U+017F>ire to be <U+017F>atisfy'd how
when a Man goes daily and regularly to
<U+017F>tool, any Excrements can remain in the
great Guts;</p>
                        <p>The An<U+017F>wer is ea<U+017F>ie, if we remember what
has been already <U+017F>aid of the Structure of the
great Inte<U+017F>tines, the Parts of which are as it
were <U+017F>o many Bags or Cavities fa<U+017F>ten'd at
certain di<U+017F>tances to tho<U+017F>e Inte<U+017F>tines. Now
'tis <U+017F>ufficient for the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the greate<U+017F>t
part of the Excrements which are <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from our daily Nouri<U+017F>hment that
the middle Part of the Gut be open and
free; but in the mean time, <U+017F>ome of the
Excrements may <U+017F>lip into the bottom of
tho<U+017F>e Cells or Bags, and by degrees fill up
their Cavity; <U+017F>o that at la<U+017F>t the middle Pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
may be almo<U+017F>t entirely <U+017F>topt by tho<U+017F>e
di<U+017F>tended Bags; and 'tis then that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Signs of an unu<U+017F>ual Load and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truction
in tho<U+017F>e Parts.</p>

                           <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40916:43"/>
This Doctrine may be further illu<U+017F>trated by
comparing the<U+017F>e Ob<U+017F>tructions in the great
Gut to the Stoppages that happen frequently
in the Conduits that are made to convey the
Filth from our Streets; for the Dirt <U+017F>ticks
by degrees to the <U+017F>ides of the Pipes, and fills
up all the Holes and Cavities it meets with,
tho' it does not immediately hinder even
<U+017F>ome of the thicke<U+017F>t Mud to <U+017F>lip away;
<U+017F>o that unle<U+017F>s they be <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>cour'd by
a pretty violent Shower, that may force a
great quantity of Water into the Cavities of
the Pipes, and by the Rapidity of its Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
carry off the Filth; they mu<U+017F>t be
open'd from time to time, and the <U+017F>tagnant
Dirt loo<U+017F>en'd, and driven forwards into the
Common Sink, by the help of Convenient
In<U+017F>truments.</p>
                        <p>The <U+017F>ame Ob<U+017F>ervation may be apply'd
to the great Guts, both with re<U+017F>pect to the
Excrements that are detain'd in its Cells,
and which pa<U+017F>s daily through its Cavity;
for when a great quantity of em is gather'd
in the<U+017F>e Bags or Cells, and begin to corrupt
there, the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>tended Cells
upon the neighbouring Parts, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Corpu<U+017F>cles which <U+017F>lip into the Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els
that environ them, produce the Symptoms
of an approaching Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition tho a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable
part of our daily Nouri<U+017F>hment
having <U+017F>till a free Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the Gut, may furni<U+017F>h <U+017F>ufficient Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for Stools. 'Tis plain then, that we have need
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40916:44"/>
of Cly<U+017F>ters and purging Medicines, to draw
the Excrements out of the places where they
are <U+017F>topt; and that con<U+017F>equently tho' we go
to <U+017F>tool naturally every Day, we may <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<U+017F>tand in need of an artificial Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

of Impurities in the place where we have
made it appear that they are u<U+017F>ually apt to
<U+017F>top. Nor will it appear <U+017F>trange that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
<U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e his Appetite when the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom

by <U+017F>uch a Load of Excrements, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
that the unu<U+017F>ual weight that hangs like
