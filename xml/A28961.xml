            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

manife<U+017F>t <U+017F>triking of one body again<U+017F>t another, where the bulk, &amp;c. of the Agent, together with its Celerity, have the chief Intere<U+017F>t; there may not be divers effects, wont to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Occult Qualities, that yet are really produced by <hi>faint</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeded</hi> Local motions of bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t one another, and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at a di<U+017F>tance.</p>
                  <p>But, before I enter upon particulars, this I mu<U+017F>t premi<U+017F>e in general, (which I have el<U+017F>ewhere had occa<U+017F>ion to note to other purpo<U+017F>es,) that we are not to look upon the bodies we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ant with, as <U+017F>o many Lumps of Matter, that differ onely in bulk and <U+017F>hape, or that act upon one another merely by their own di<U+017F>tinct and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular powers; but rather as bodies of peculiar and differing internal Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well as external Figures: on the account of which <U+017F>tructures, many of them mu<U+017F>t be con<U+017F>idered as a kind of Engines, that are both <U+017F>o framed and <U+017F>o placed among other bodies, that <U+017F>ometimes Agents, otherwi<U+017F>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104480:7"/>
may have notable operations upon them, becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e operations being furthered by the Mechani<U+017F>m of the body wrought on, and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which other bodies and Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ical Cau<U+017F>es have to it, a great part of the effect is due, not preci<U+017F>ely to the external Agent, that 'tis wont to be a<U+017F>cribed to, but in great mea<U+017F>ure to the action of one part of the body it <U+017F>elf (that is wrought on) upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by the concurring action of the neighbouring bodies, and perhaps of <U+017F>ome of the more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Agents of Nature. This No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Con<U+017F>ideration being in other Papers particularly confirmed, I <U+017F>hall not now in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon it, tru<U+017F>ting that you will not forget it, when there <U+017F>hall be occa<U+017F>ion to apply it in the following Notes.</p>
                  <p>There may be more Accounts than we have yet thought of, upon which <hi>Local motions</hi> may perform con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things, either without being much heeded, or without <U+017F>eeming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then faint, at lea<U+017F>t in relation to

the con<U+017F>iderablene<U+017F>s of the Effects produced by them. And therefore I would not be under<U+017F>tood in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu<U+017F>ive <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, when in the following Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e I take notice but of a few of the above-mentioned Accounts; the<U+017F>e <U+017F>eeming <U+017F>ufficient, whereto, as to Heads, may be conveniently enough referred the In<U+017F>tances I allot to this Tract.</p>
                  <p>And concerning each of the<U+017F>e Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, I hold it requi<U+017F>ite to intimate in this place, that I mention it onely, as that whereon <U+017F>uch effects of Local motion, as I refer to it, do principally depend: for, otherwi<U+017F>e, I am <U+017F>o far from denying, that I a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ca<U+017F>es there are more Cau<U+017F>es than one, or perhaps than two of tho<U+017F>e here treated of apart, that may notably concur to <hi>Phaenomena</hi> directly referred to but one or other of them.</p>

                  <p>I have <U+017F>ometimes cau<U+017F>ed a skilfull Turner to turn for me an oblong piece of Iron or Steel, and placing my naked hand at a convenient di<U+017F>tance to receive the little fragments, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for the mo<U+017F>t part le<U+017F><U+017F>er then <U+017F>mall pins heads, as they flew off from the rod, they were, as I expected, <U+017F>o inten<U+017F>ely heated by the quick action of the Tool upon them, that they <U+017F>eemed almo<U+017F>t like <U+017F>o many <U+017F>parks of fire; <U+017F>o that I could not endure to continue my hand there.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104480:9"/>
when I asked, whether it was not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Du<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>t into them, than from their Heat; he replied, that be<U+017F>ides the <U+017F>troke, he could <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly feel a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome heat, which would make even his Eye-lids <U+017F>ore: And that <U+017F>ometimes, when he employed a rough Tool, that took off <U+017F>omewhat greater Chips, he had found the heat <U+017F>o vehement, that not onely 'twould <U+017F>corch his tender Eye-lids, but the thick and hard skin of his hands: for proof whereof he <U+017F>hewed me in one of his hands a little bli<U+017F>ter, that had been <U+017F>o rai<U+017F>ed, and was not yet quite gone off.</p>

Not to mention, that I learnt from an experienced Artificer, that in turning of Bra<U+017F>s the little fragments of that metall acquire an inten<U+017F>er Heat than tho<U+017F>e of Iron.</p>
                  <p>I remember al<U+017F>o, that, to vary the Experiment mentioned ju<U+017F>t before this la<U+017F>t, by making it with a bodie far le<U+017F>s <U+017F>olid and heavy than Bra<U+017F>s or Iron, I cau<U+017F>ed an Artificer to turn very nimbly a piece of ordinary wood, and holding my hand not far off, the powder, that flew about upon the operation, <U+017F>truck my hand in many places with that briskne<U+017F>s, that I could but unea<U+017F>ily endure the Heat which they produced where they hit.

                  <p>To the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that, by but dextrou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping good loaf-<U+017F>ugar with a knife, there will be made <U+017F>o brisk an agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts, that <U+017F>tore of <U+017F>parks

But that is more con<U+017F>iderable, which happens upon the colli<U+017F>ion of a flint and a <U+017F>teel: For, though Vitrification be by Chymi<U+017F>ts e<U+017F>teemed the ultimate action of the fire, and though, to turn <U+017F>and or <U+017F>tones, though very finely poudered, into gla<U+017F>s, 'tis u<U+017F>ually required that it be kept for divers hours in the inten<U+017F>e fire of a gla<U+017F>s-hou<U+017F>e; and though, la<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the gla<U+017F>s-men complain, that they cannot bring flints or <U+017F>and to fu<U+017F>ion without the help of a good proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Borillia</hi> or <U+017F>ome other fixed <U+017F>alt: yet both actuall Ignition and Vitrification are brought to pa<U+017F>s al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t in a moment by the bare vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of that motion that is excited in the parts of a flint when it is <U+017F>truck with a <U+017F>teel: For tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>parks that then fly out, (as an Ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on<note place="margin">Mr. Hooke</note> has ob<U+017F>erved, and as I have often <U+017F>een with a good Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cope,) are u<U+017F>ually real and permanent parcels (for the mo<U+017F>t part globulous) of<U+017F>tone vitrified and ignited by the vehemence of the motion. And that

this vitrification may be of the <U+017F>tone it<U+017F>elf, though <U+017F>teel be a metal of a far more fu<U+017F>ible nature then a flint, I am induced to think, becau<U+017F>e I have tried, that not only flints with <U+017F>teel, but flints with flints, and more ea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pieces of Rock Cry<U+017F>tal between them<U+017F>elves, will by colli<U+017F>ion <U+017F>trike fire.

                  <p>The operation of <U+017F>mall portions of fluid matter on <U+017F>olid bodies will be farther exemplified in the IV. <hi>Chapter,</hi> by the effects of the blown flame of a Lamp on gla<U+017F>s and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls; <U+017F>o that I <U+017F>hall here need but to point in general at the wonderfull effects that <hi>Lightning</hi> has produced, as well by the Celerity of its motion, as by the matter whereof it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts. Of which Effects, Hi<U+017F>tories and the writings of Meteorologi<U+017F>ts afford good <U+017F>tore; and I have been an admiring ob<U+017F>erver of <U+017F>ome of them, one of the la<U+017F>t of which was the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of metal by the flame in its pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age, which probably la<U+017F>ted but the twinckling of an Eye.</p>
                  <p>And even a <U+017F>mall parcel of Air, if put into a <U+017F>ufficiently-brisk motion, may communicate a con<U+017F>iderable motion to a <U+017F>olid body; whereof a notable In<U+017F>tance (which depends chiefly upon the Celerity of the <U+017F>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy corpu<U+017F>cles of the Air) is afforded
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104480:12"/>
by the violent motion communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a bullet <U+017F>hot out of a good wind-gun. For, when this In<U+017F>trument is well charged, the <U+017F>trongly-compre<U+017F>t Air being <U+017F>et at liberty, and forcibly endeavouring to expand it <U+017F>elf to its wonted laxity, its corpu<U+017F>cles give a multitude of impul<U+017F>es to the bullet, all the while that it continues moving along the barrel, and by this means put it into <U+017F>o rapid a motion, that I found by trial, the bullet would in a moment be flatted, almo<U+017F>t into the figure of a Hemi<U+017F>phere, by being <U+017F>hot off again<U+017F>t a metalline plate.</p>
                  <p>And farther to <U+017F>hew, How <U+017F>wift that motion mu<U+017F>t have been, and with what Celerity a vehement agitation may be communicated to the parts of a Solid body, I <U+017F>hall add here (though the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> might be referred to the V. <hi>Chapter,</hi>) that, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of the Bullet and the metalline plate la<U+017F>ted probably but a phy<U+017F>ical moment; yet the minute parts of the bullet were put into <U+017F>o various and brisk an agitation, that making ha<U+017F>t

the<U+017F>e painfull motions in the Patient, re<U+017F>ted upon a floating body. And I remember, that an illu<U+017F>trious Commander of a very great Man of war, being asked by me, whether of the many wounded men, he had in his <U+017F>hip in a very long Sea-fight, none of them were affected by that noi<U+017F>e of the Enemy's Cannon di<U+017F>charged in <U+017F>hips at a di<U+017F>tance?

it would accommodate me with very eminent In<U+017F>tances for the Chapter of the <hi>Propagable</hi> nature of Motion: And though it be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to find <U+017F>uch examples of <U+017F>hakes excited by <U+017F>ounds as are not liable to the mentioned objection; becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>onorous bodies here below do all either <U+017F>trike, or lean, upon <U+017F>uch gro<U+017F>s and vi<U+017F>ible bodies as the Earth and Water; yet there is one kind of Sound, that mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed to be propagated by the Air, as being made in it; and that is <hi>Thunder,</hi> who<U+017F>e noi<U+017F>e does <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o vehemently affect the Air, though without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible wind, that both others and I have ob<U+017F>erved it very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly to <U+017F>hake great and <U+017F>trong Hou<U+017F>es, notwith<U+017F>tanding the di<U+017F>tance of the clouds where the noi<U+017F>es were fir<U+017F>t produced.

For, whereas the diligent <hi>Mer<U+017F>ennus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erves, that a bullet <U+017F>hot out of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non or a Musket does not overpa<U+017F>s two hundred and forty yards in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or <U+017F>ixtieth part of a minute; I have more than once diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved, that the motion of <hi>Sound</hi> pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es above four hundred yards in the

                  <p>The great Loudne<U+017F>s of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ounds, and the vehement percu<U+017F><U+017F>ion that the Air receives in their formation, will probably make it be ea<U+017F>ily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that 'twas onely the Impetuo<U+017F>ity of the motion of the <hi>Medium,</hi> that gave the <U+017F>hake to the windows and other <U+017F>olid bodies that I have been mentioning to have been made to tremble by the report of Cannon or Thunder: But yet I will not on this occa<U+017F>ion conceal, that perhaps it may without ab<U+017F>urdity be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, that Some of tho<U+017F>e tremulous motions of <U+017F>olid bodies might either depend upon, or at lea<U+017F>t be promoted by, <U+017F>ome peculiar di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, that Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e (which is endued with <U+017F>pringine<U+017F>s,) and <U+017F>ome other bodies that perhaps are not quite devoid of that Quality,

                  <p>MO<U+017F>t men, when they think at all of the <hi>effluvia</hi> of bodies and their motions, are wont to think of them as if they were but much finer <U+017F>orts of Du<U+017F>t, (who<U+017F>e grains, by rea<U+017F>on of their <U+017F>malne<U+017F>s, are invi<U+017F>ible,) which, by the various agitation of the Air, are

as 'twere by <U+017F>ome faint wind blown again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>urfaces of the bodies they chance to meet in their way, and that they are <U+017F>topped in their progre<U+017F>s without penetrating into the interior parts of the bodies they invade. And according to this Notion, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that men <U+017F>hould not fancy, that <U+017F>uch minute bodies pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing, as they <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e, no further than the <U+017F>urfaces of tho<U+017F>e on which they operate, <U+017F>hould have but faint operations upon them.</p>
                  <p>But we may have other thoughts, if we well con<U+017F>ider, that the Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cles we <U+017F>peak of, are, by their minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted, and oftentimes by their figure inabled, to pierce into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermo<U+017F>t rece<U+017F><U+017F>es of the body they invade, and di<U+017F>tribute them<U+017F>elves to all, or at lea<U+017F>t to multitudes of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute parts, whereof that body con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts. For this being granted, though we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e each <U+017F>ingle <hi>effluvium</hi> or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be very minute; yet, <U+017F>ince we may <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, even <U+017F>olid bodies to be made up of particles that are <U+017F>o too, and the number of invading particles
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104480:19"/>
to be not much inferior to that of the invaded ones, or at lea<U+017F>t to be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly great, it need not <U+017F>eem incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a multitude of little Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cles in motion (who<U+017F>e motion, may, for ought we know, be very <U+017F>wift) <U+017F>hould be able to have a con<U+017F>iderable operation upon particles either qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>cent, or that have a motion too <U+017F>low to be perceptible by <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. Which may perhaps be the better conceived by the help of this gro<U+017F>s example:</p>
                  <p>If you turn an Ant-hill well <U+017F>toc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with Ants-eggs, up<U+017F>ide down, you may <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch a heap of eggs mingled with the loo<U+017F>e earth, as a few of tho<U+017F>e In<U+017F>ects, if they were yoaked together, would not be able at once to draw after them; but if good numbers of them di<U+017F>per<U+017F>e them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves and range up and down, and each lay hold of her own egge, and hurry it away, 'tis <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>urprizing to <U+017F>ee (as I have with plea<U+017F>ure done) how quickly the heap of eggs will be di<U+017F>placed, when almo<U+017F>t every little egge has

                  <p>There are two ways of explicating the turning of Water into Ice; one

or other of which is approved almo<U+017F>t by all the Corpu<U+017F>cularian Philo<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.

vi<U+017F>ible, and their motions are not <U+017F>aid to be <U+017F>wift, but may rather be judged to be <U+017F>low enough; and yet tho<U+017F>e minute aqueous, or more minute fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorifick particles, becau<U+017F>e of their number, produce in the glaciation of the liquour <U+017F>o forcible a motion outwards, as to make it break bottles, not onely of gla<U+017F>s and earth <U+017F>trongly baked, but, as I have <U+017F>everal times tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of metal it <U+017F>elf, that being full of the liquour were firmly <U+017F>topped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <U+017F>upervening of the Cold.

Solid, that is <U+017F>truck or impelled, be either incon<U+017F>iderable, or, perhaps, not <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible; yet the impul<U+017F>e may make a con<U+017F>iderable impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and may be communicated to a great <U+017F>hare of the particles of that matter, whereof the <U+017F>olid ma<U+017F>s con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts; as we <U+017F>ee in the <U+017F>triking of a timber-beam at one end, the motion, though perhaps it were not <U+017F>trong at the fir<U+017F>t, may become <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible at the other. Though Bell-metal be <U+017F>o hard a body, that it is reckoned harder than iron it-<U+017F>elf, in<U+017F>omuch that oftentimes it re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts even files of Steel, which readily work on Iron; yet this <U+017F>olidity hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not but that, as I have found, conveniently <U+017F>haped ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metal, though thick, will be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly affected by a motion that neither is <U+017F>trong, nor touches them in more than a <U+017F>hort line, or perhaps than a Phy<U+017F>ical point. The truth of this I have found by trial on more than one <U+017F>uch ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and particularly on one that was hemi<U+017F>phaerical, which being placed or held in a convenient
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104480:27"/>
po<U+017F>ture, if I did but gently pa<U+017F>s the point of a pin for a little way along the brim of it, it would <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ound, and that (to a very attentive ear) <U+017F>o long, and in <U+017F>uch a ringing manner, as made it highly probable, that the parts, immediately touched (and not <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>cratched) by the point of a pin, were not onely put into a vibrating motion them<U+017F>elves, but were enabled to communicate it to tho<U+017F>e that were next them, and they to tho<U+017F>e that were contiguous to them; and <U+017F>o the tremulous motion was propagated quite round the bell, and made divers <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ive Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before it quite cea<U+017F>ed to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. And if, in <U+017F>tead of drawing a Line on the brim of the ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, I <U+017F>truck it, though but faintly, with the point of a pin, though the part immediately touched would be but a phy<U+017F>ical point, yet the motion would be, like the former, propagated <U+017F>everal times quite round; as was argued by the ringing and duration of the produced <U+017F>ound, though this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104480:28"/>
metalline ve<U+017F><U+017F>el were <U+017F>even inches in Diameter, and of a con<U+017F>iderable thickne<U+017F>s. Nor was a <U+017F>olidity like that of Bra<U+017F>s requi<U+017F>ite to produce the<U+017F>e effects. For I found them to in<U+017F>ue much after the <U+017F>ame manner, when I employed onely a <U+017F>hort and <U+017F>lender thread of Gla<U+017F>s, which though little, if at all, thicker than a pin, was yet hollow quite through. Now if it be true, as 'tis highly probable, that Sound, as it belongs to the air, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in an undulating motion of the Air, and <U+017F>o in our ca<U+017F>e requires a vibrating motion in the <U+017F>onorous body to impart that motion to the Air; we mu<U+017F>t grant in our In<U+017F>tances a wonderfull propagablene<U+017F>s of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even when 'tis not violent, in Solid bodies them<U+017F>elves; <U+017F>ince the point of a pin, gently <U+017F>triking a part, no bigger than it <U+017F>elf, of a ma<U+017F>s of very <U+017F>olid metal, could thereby communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible motion, and that <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times circulated, to millions of parts equall to it in bulk, and much exceeding it in hardne<U+017F>s. And <U+017F>ince
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104480:28"/>
the effect was more con<U+017F>iderable, when the trial was made in a much greater, than in a <U+017F>maller ve<U+017F><U+017F>el; 'tis probable, that, if I had had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of experimenting on a large and well-hung Bell, the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> would have been more notable; as it al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eemed to be on our ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, if, in <U+017F>tead of <U+017F>triking it with the point of a pin, we ca<U+017F>t, though but faintly, again<U+017F>t the lower part of it a grain of <U+017F>hot, le<U+017F>s than a <U+017F>mall pins-head, or let a little grain fall, from about one foot high, upon the in<U+017F>ide of the inverted Hemi<U+017F>phere. And to <U+017F>hew, that even <U+017F>oft and yielding bodies, and but faintly moved, are not to be excluded from a power of putting <U+017F>uch hard ones into motion; I <U+017F>hall add, that I found almo<U+017F>t the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to tho<U+017F>e above mentioned, by pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing the pulp of my finger a little way along the lower part of the ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el. Nay, that fluid bodies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves may communicate <U+017F>uch an inte<U+017F>tine and propagable motion, to harden <U+017F>olid ones, I may have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104480:29"/>
an occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>hew by the effects of a <U+017F>mall Flame, and the Sun-beams on gla<U+017F>s and <U+017F>teel. And I <U+017F>hall here on this occa<U+017F>ion add this word about the Propagation of Motion produced in <U+017F>olid bodies by heat, that it much depends upon the particular Textures of the bodies. For I found, that when I heated a piece of gla<U+017F>s or of a fire-<U+017F>tone, I could without inconvenience hold my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hand upon parts that were very near (<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e within an inch off) the ignited portions of them. But, if we take a rod of Iron, for in<U+017F>tance, and heat one end red-hot, the heat of that end will be <U+017F>o propagated towards the other, that it will offend one's hand at <U+017F>everal times the di<U+017F>tance, at which one might conveniently hold the rod, if it were of gla<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>In many buildings it may be ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (and is thought a <U+017F>ign of the firm Cohe<U+017F>ion of their parts,) that a <U+017F>tamp of one's foot, nay or bare treading, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch other le<U+017F><U+017F>e brisk impul<U+017F>e, made in one room,

will have a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible effect in all or mo<U+017F>t of the others. And it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that, by the ha<U+017F>ty <U+017F>hutting of a door, the whole hou<U+017F>e is made to tremble; whence we may argue, that, even among <U+017F>olid bodies, motion made in one place may be readily propagated to many others: And if, as to the latter of the In<U+017F>tances, the <U+017F>udden impul<U+017F>e and compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Air, made by the door <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be ha<U+017F>tily <U+017F>hut, have any con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <U+017F>hare in the effect, the Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non will <U+017F>erve to <U+017F>hew the efficacy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <U+017F>uch a motion of a fluid body, as we cannot directly feel upon divers large and firmly connected <U+017F>olid bodies.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Earthquakes</hi> the tremulous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <U+017F>ometimes extends <U+017F>o very far, that, though it <U+017F>eems highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the <U+017F>hake that is given to one part of the Earth by the firing and explo<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ubterraneal exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, (if that be the true and onely cau<U+017F>e of Earthquakes) is not capable of reaching near <U+017F>o far as divers

But though I have been in more Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes then one; yet, <U+017F>ince they were too <U+017F>udden and too <U+017F>hort to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me any con<U+017F>iderable ob<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay no more of them; but proceed to take notice, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the motion of a Coach or Cart, that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed at a good di<U+017F>tance from the place that I was in, has made the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104480:31"/>
buildings <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly <U+017F>hake, that I could not but wonder, that <U+017F>o great a portion of <U+017F>o firm and <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>h a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as the Earth, could, by a cau<U+017F>e that <U+017F>eemed very di<U+017F>proportionate to <U+017F>uch an effect, be made to tremble it <U+017F>elf, and manife<U+017F>tly to <U+017F>hake firm buildings that were founded on it. And this ob<U+017F>ervation made me the more inclinable to give credit to their Relations, who tell us, that in a calm night, the march of a troup of hor<U+017F>e may be felt, by attentive Scouts watching at a great di<U+017F>tance off, by the <U+017F>hake that the ground receives from the trampling of the hor<U+017F>es; though I formerly <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected much, and do yet a little, that the impul<U+017F>e of the air conveyed along the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting <U+017F>urface of the ground, might mainly contribute to the effect that is a<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed onely to the motion of the <U+017F>oil.</p>
                  <p>Before I advance to the <hi>Second</hi> Member of this Chapter, it may not be impertinent to note, that in peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed bodies, and e<U+017F>pecially in Organical ones, a very <hi>languid</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:104480:31"/>
motion may have a far greater effect, than it could produce by a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of it <U+017F>elf. For it may <U+017F>o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the motion of the Spirits or other active parts of the body it works on, as to make multitudes of them act as if they con<U+017F>pired to perform the <U+017F>ame motions. As when a tickli<U+017F>h man, by having the pulp of one's finger pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed gently along the <U+017F>ole of his foot or the palm of his hand, has divers mu<U+017F>cles and other parts of his body and face put into preternatural or unu<U+017F>ual motions. And mo<U+017F>t men by being lightly tickled with the end of a feather or <U+017F>traw, within their No<U+017F>trils, have their heads and many parts of their bodies put into that violent Commotion, wherein <hi>Sneezing</hi> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts. And I remember, that having for <U+017F>ome time been, by a di<U+017F>temper, (from which God was graciou<U+017F>ly plea<U+017F>ed a while after to free me,) quite deprived of the u<U+017F>e of my hands; it more than once hapned to me, that <U+017F>itting alone in a Coach, if the wind chanced to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104480:32"/>
blow a <U+017F>ingle hair upon my face in the Summer-time, the tickling or itching, that it produced, was <U+017F>o unea<U+017F>y to me, 'till by calling out to a footman I could get it removed, that, though I could well bear it as long as I was wont to do, when, having the u<U+017F>e of my hands, I could relieve my <U+017F>elf at plea<U+017F>ure; yet if I were forced to endure the itching too long, before any came to <U+017F>uccour me, the unea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s was <U+017F>o great, as to make me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend falling pre<U+017F>ently either into Convul<U+017F>ions or a Swoon. But 'tis time to proceed to the <hi><U+017F>econd</hi> Member of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>2. Others there are, that cannot believe, that Local motion, e<U+017F>pecially if it be <hi>languid,</hi> can be propagated through differing Mediums, each of which, <U+017F>ave that wherein the Motion is begun, mu<U+017F>t, they think, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, or check and dead it. To the<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hall recommend the Con<U+017F>ideration of an Experiment, I remember I made before <U+017F>ome Learned men in our Pneumatick Engine. For, having
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104480:32"/>
cau<U+017F>ed a large and thick gla<U+017F>s Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be <U+017F>o blown, that it had a gla<U+017F>s button in the in<U+017F>ide of that part which upon the Engine was to be placed upwards; I cau<U+017F>ed a Watch to be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended by a little Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chain fa<U+017F>tned to that button by as <U+017F>lender and <U+017F>oft a body, as I thought would be <U+017F>trong enough to <U+017F>upport my watch; and then, the Gla<U+017F>s being cemented on clo<U+017F>e to the Receiver, to prevent a Commerce between the Cavity of it and the Air, the watch, that hung freely near the middle of the Cavity of the Receiver, made it <U+017F>elf to be heard by tho<U+017F>e attentive Li<U+017F>tners, that would hold their ears directly over the <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended watch, who<U+017F>e motions were thereby argued to have been propagated, either through the included air, or along the <U+017F>tring to the concave part of the Gla<U+017F>s, and through the whole thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the Gla<U+017F>s to the convex part, and thence, through the interpo<U+017F>ed air to the Ear. And this mention of watches minds me of what I often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104480:33"/>
in a <U+017F>mall <U+017F>triking watch, that I have worn in my pocket. For, when it <U+017F>truck the Hours, and in <U+017F>ome po<U+017F>tures when the balance did but move, I could plainly feel the brisker motions of the Bell, and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly the languid ones of the balance, through the <U+017F>everal linings of my Breeches, and <U+017F>ome other interpo<U+017F>ed <U+017F>oft and yielding bodies; and this, though the watch (as I <U+017F>aid) was <U+017F>mall, and the balance included in a double ca<U+017F>e, and though the outwardmo<U+017F>t were of (what they call) Chagrine, and the innermo<U+017F>t of Gold; which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention, becau<U+017F>e that clo<U+017F>e<U+017F>t of metals is ob<U+017F>erved more to dead <U+017F>ounds and motions than harder me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as Silver, Copper, and Iron.</p>
                  <p>That Motion may be propagated through differing Mediums, may <U+017F>eem the more probable by the <U+017F>hakings that are often felt by men lying on beds that <U+017F>tand in rooms clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hut, when loud claps of thunder are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced (perhaps at a great di<U+017F>tance off) in the clouds. And whether it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104480:33"/>
will be fit to add to this In<U+017F>tance that which you have lately met with in the III. Chapter of a wounded Frenchman at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> I leave you to con<U+017F>ider.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether it will be very proper to take notice on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of an odd <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> recited by the experienced <hi>Agricola</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De nat. eorum quae effi. è Terra Lib. IV.

                  </p>
                  <p>3. As tho<U+017F>e of whom I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at the beginning of this Chapter, are backward to allow, that Motion may be con<U+017F>iderably propagated through <hi><U+017F>olid</hi> bodies; <U+017F>o on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there are others that are indi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed to think, that 'tis near <U+017F>o pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagable as indeed it is through <hi>fluid</hi> bodies; becau<U+017F>e they pre<U+017F>ume, that the ea<U+017F>y ce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the parts of fluids
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104480:34"/>
will dead the impul<U+017F>e received by tho<U+017F>e of them that are fir<U+017F>t acted on by the impelling body. And</p>
                  <p>4. There is yet another <U+017F>ort of Naturali<U+017F>ts, who, though they may be brought to grant, that Motion may by propagated even through a <U+017F>oft and yielding Medium, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it <U+017F>hould through <U+017F>uch a Medium be propagated to any con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable di<U+017F>tance; being perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this opinion by ob<U+017F>erving, that, though a body <U+017F>omewhat broad as well as <U+017F>olid, as the Palm of one's hand or a battledore, be moved through the Air <U+017F>wiftly enough to make a wind; yet that wind will not be <U+017F>trong enough to be felt any more than a very little way off. Wherefore, becau<U+017F>e the In<U+017F>tances, to which I a<U+017F><U+017F>ign the remaining part of this Chapter, may be for the mo<U+017F>t part applicable to the removal of both the<U+017F>e prejudices; It may for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity <U+017F>ake be expedient to con<U+017F>ider them both together.</p>
                  <p>If Luminous bodies act on our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104480:34"/>
Eyes, not by a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantial diffu<U+017F>ion of extreamly minute particles, as the <hi>Atomi<U+017F>ts</hi> would have it, but by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated Pul<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ome Subtile mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contiguous to the <U+017F>hining body, (as the <hi>Carte<U+017F>ians</hi> and many other Philo<U+017F>ophers maintain;) 'twill be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t, that a body le<U+017F>s than a <U+017F>mall pin's head may give a brisk motion to a portion of fluid matter many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of times greater than it <U+017F>elf; <U+017F>ince in a dark night a <U+017F>ingle <U+017F>park of fire may be <U+017F>een in differing places, who<U+017F>e di<U+017F>tance from it exceeds ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thou<U+017F>and times the <U+017F>park's <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</hi> Not to mention the great remove, at which the flame of a <U+017F>mall taper may not onely be <U+017F>een, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear greater than near at hand. And if we compare the <hi>Diameter</hi> of that bright Planet <hi>Venus,</hi> which yet <U+017F>hines but with a borrowed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected Light, with its <hi>di<U+017F>tance</hi> from the Earth, we may ea<U+017F>ily conclude, that the fixed Stars, which probably are <U+017F>o many Suns that <U+017F>hine by their own native Light, mu<U+017F>t impell a <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104480:35"/>
proportion of Etherial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be able at that immen<U+017F>e di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance to make <U+017F>uch vivid Impre<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they do, upon our Eyes. But to de<U+017F>cend to In<U+017F>tances le<U+017F>s remote and di<U+017F>putable, I <U+017F>hall, in order to the removal of the two lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned prejudices, proceed to con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; that, though it be true, that Fluid bodies do ea<U+017F>ily yield to Solid ones that impell them, and thereby oftentimes quickly dead the motion of tho<U+017F>e Solids; yet the motion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lo<U+017F>t onely in regard of the <U+017F>olid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is not lo<U+017F>t, but tran<U+017F>mitted and diffu<U+017F>ed in reference to the fluid. As when a log of wood, or any <U+017F>uch body <U+017F>pecifically lighter than water, is let fall in the middle of a pond, though its progre<U+017F>s downwards be checkt, and it be brought to re<U+017F>t qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly on the <U+017F>urface of the water; yet its motion is not lo<U+017F>t, but communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the parts of the water it fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>trikes again<U+017F>t, and by tho<U+017F>e to others, 'till at length the curls or waves produced on the <U+017F>urface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

far, give me leave to tell you, that we may take wrong mea<U+017F>ures, if we think, that, (for in<U+017F>tance) the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulating motion, into which the Air is put by the action of <U+017F>onorous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, reaches but a little way, as we are apt to pre<U+017F>ume it does, becau<U+017F>e we judge of it by the effect it has on our ears when the <U+017F>ound is made in di<U+017F>advantageous places. For one, that, for in<U+017F>tance, hears a Lute or a Viol plaid on in a room furni<U+017F>hed with hangings, will be apt to think the <U+017F>ound faint and languid in compari<U+017F>on of what it would appear to him, if the <U+017F>ame In<U+017F>trument were plaid on after the <U+017F>ame manner in an arched room without hangings; the<U+017F>e <U+017F>oft and yielding bodies being apt to dead the <U+017F>ound, which the figure and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the Vaulted room would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect. And <U+017F>o, when a man <U+017F>peaks aloud in the free Air, we are not wont to take any notice of a progre<U+017F>s made by the motion of the Air beyond the place we are in, when our ears receive the <U+017F>ound; but if the place happen

And I have often thought, that, even by the better <U+017F>ort of our Echoing places, we are not informed, to near how great a <U+017F>phere the motion, which the Air is put into by Sounds, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it <U+017F>elf, where its diffu<U+017F>ion and vigour are not hindred nor weakned by bodies either placed too near, or indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to promote its operation.</p>
                  <p>What has been lately <U+017F>aid of the great diffu<U+017F>ion of Sounds, if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves be loud and great, will appear highly probable, by what is related by the Learned <hi>Fromundus,</hi>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Blunt,</hi> in his voiage to the <hi>Levant,</hi> giving an account of what he ob<U+017F>erved in <hi>Egypt,</hi> has, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remarkable things, this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age: Many rarities of Living creatures I <U+017F>aw in <hi>Gran Cairo,</hi> but the mo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious was a ne<U+017F>t of four-legged Serpents of two foot long, black and ugly, kept by a Frenchman, who when he came to handle them, they would not endure him, but ran and hid

in their hole; then would he take his Cittern and play upon it: They, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Mu<U+017F>ick, came all crawling to his feet, and began to climbe up him, till he gave over playing, then away they ran.</p>
                  <p>This recalls to my mind, what <U+017F>ome men of repute, and particularly the Learned <hi>Kircherus,</hi> relate concerning a great Fi<U+017F>h, in or about the Streights that <U+017F>ever <hi>Sicily</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> which is <U+017F>aid to be much affected with a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar kind of Tune, (har<U+017F>h enough to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ears) by which the Mariners are wont to allure it to follow their ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els. And it may much <U+017F>trengthen the Conclu<U+017F>ion maintained in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if there be any certainty in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tradition, that the Lion is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and made to run away by the crowing of a Cock: I <U+017F>ay, <hi>if,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e though I doubt not but <U+017F>ome peculiar kinds of Sounds, as well as of other <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible objects, may be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and exceedingly ungratefull to the Sen<U+017F>ories of this or that peculiar kind of Animals, and con<U+017F>equently

to the ears of Lions; yet a late French Traveller into the <hi>Levant</hi> gives me cau<U+017F>e much to que<U+017F>tion the matter of fact, affirming, that row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the brink of <hi>Tigris</hi> or <hi>Euphrates,</hi> (for I do not punctually remember which,) they were, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours in the night, terrified by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that attended them along the brink of the River, and would not at all be frighted by the frequent crowing of the Cocks that chanced to be in the pa<U+017F><U+017F>engers Boat. Of which unconcernedne<U+017F>s of the Lions, our ob<U+017F>erving traveller took much more notice than the Lions appeared to do of the crowing of the Cocks. I might on this occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omething of the received Tradition, that many <U+017F>leeping per<U+017F>ons will be more ea<U+017F>ily waked by being called upon by their own u<U+017F>ual names, than by other names, though uttered with a louder voice.

<U+017F>ometimes continue many hours, if the Mu<U+017F>ick do <U+017F>o, and not otherwi<U+017F>e. I know there are <U+017F>ome that que<U+017F>tion the truth of the things related of the<U+017F>e <hi>Tarantati,</hi> (as the <hi>Italians</hi> call them,) and I ea<U+017F>ily grant, that <U+017F>ome Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may have been <U+017F>uffered to pa<U+017F>s under the countenance of <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a Truth. But be<U+017F>ides the affirmations of <U+017F>ome Learned men, (as well Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians as others) my Doubts have been much removed by the Accounts I have received from an Ingenious Acquaintance of mine own, who at <hi>Tarentum</hi> it <U+017F>elf, whence the In<U+017F>ect takes its name, and el<U+017F>ewhere, <U+017F>aw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bitten per<U+017F>ons in their dances, <U+017F>ome in publick and <U+017F>ome in private pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t a Phy<U+017F>ician, on whom the tune that fitted his di<U+017F>temper had the <U+017F>ame operation as on the other Patients.

                  <p>I know a very hone<U+017F>t and <U+017F>ober Mu<U+017F>ician, who has divers times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to me, that he could at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure, by playing a certain Tune, (which he acquainted me with, and which did not much move others) make a per<U+017F>on (whom he named to me) weep, whether <U+017F>he would or no. And I might add, that when I have been taking Phy<U+017F>ick, or am any thing feveri<U+017F>h, the repetition of two ver<U+017F>es of <hi>Lucan</hi> <U+017F>eldom fails (as I have often tried) of producing in me a chilne<U+017F>s, almo<U+017F>t like that, but fainter, that begins the fit of an ague. But on this In<U+017F>tance I look not as a <U+017F>trong proof of the Phy<U+017F>ical efficacy of Sounds; becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e two ver<U+017F>es having been emphatically read, when divers years agoe I lay <U+017F>ick of a <U+017F>low fever, and could not re<U+017F>t, they made
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104480:43"/>
<U+017F>o <U+017F>trong an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion on me, that whenever I am under a Di<U+017F>compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure any thing near like that, that then troubled me, tho<U+017F>e ver<U+017F>es re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, as 'twere, in my brain and <U+017F>ome other parts that di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, with which my fir<U+017F>t hearing of tho<U+017F>e ver<U+017F>es was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied.</p>
                  <p>It may be the le<U+017F>s admired, that the vibrating motion of the Air, that produces <U+017F>ounds, <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>uch effects upon di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed Organical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <U+017F>ince Light it <U+017F>elf, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of briskly moving <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia</hi> far more <U+017F>ubtile than aerial corpu<U+017F>cles, or is propagated by the pul<U+017F>e of a far more <U+017F>ubtile body than Air, may have a notable ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed bodies. For we commonly ob<U+017F>erve, that the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, by beating upon the face or eyes of <U+017F>ome that come <U+017F>uddenly out of a <U+017F>haded place into the Light, pre<U+017F>ently make them <U+017F>neeze; which you know is not done without a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement motion of divers parts of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104480:44"/>
the body. And though Colour be but a modification of Light; yet, be<U+017F>ides that 'twas anciently a practice, as the Hi<U+017F>tory of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> informs us, to <U+017F>hew red objects to Elephants, to make them more fierce, 'tis a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ob<U+017F>ervation, that red cloaths do offend and irritate Turky-cocks. And that is more remarkable, which is related by the very Learned Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian <hi>Vale<U+017F>ius,</hi> of a per<U+017F>on that he knew, who, if he looked upon red objects, would not onely have his Eyes offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but was <U+017F>ubject to an effu<U+017F>ion of Humours in the neighboring parts.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THough the Experiments deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have, I pre<U+017F>ume, <U+017F>ufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>ted, that the modification given to the motions of the Air by <U+017F>ono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bodies may have con<U+017F>iderable effects upon Animals, in who<U+017F>e or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized bodies the curiou<U+017F>ly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved parts have an admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with, and relation to, one another, and to the whole Symmetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fabrick they make up; yet, I fear, it will <U+017F>carce <U+017F>eem credible, that <U+017F>onorous motions of the Air, not very loud, <U+017F>hould find, even in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104480:45"/>
bodies Inanimate and Inorganicall, <U+017F>uch congruous Textures and other Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions to admit their action, that even more languid Sounds, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly modified, may <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon them, and much more than <U+017F>ounds that are louder and more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, but not <U+017F>o happily modified. To make this good by particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, I <U+017F>hall begin with that, which, though the effect may <U+017F>eem inferiour to that of mo<U+017F>t of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I judge fitte<U+017F>t to manife<U+017F>t, that the produced motion depends upon the determinate modification of that of the impellent Fluid.</p>
                  <p>That a certain impul<U+017F>e of Air, made by one of the Uni<U+017F>on-<U+017F>trings of a Mu<U+017F>ical In<U+017F>trument, may <U+017F>uffice to produce a vi<U+017F>ible motion in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is now become a known expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; of the Cau<U+017F>e and <U+017F>ome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ob<U+017F>erved Phaenomena of which I el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more fully di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. But, that it may not be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected in this ca<U+017F>e, that the <U+017F>hake of the untouched <U+017F>tring is communicated to it by the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104480:45"/>
propagated motion of the In<U+017F>trument it <U+017F>elf, to which the <U+017F>tring, that is <U+017F>truck, is al<U+017F>o fa<U+017F>tned; I <U+017F>hall add, that, according to what I el<U+017F>ewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, I found by trial purpo<U+017F>ely made, that a <U+017F>tring of Wire, (which you will grant to be a more <U+017F>olid body than an ordinary Gut-<U+017F>tring,) may be without another <U+017F>tring brought to tremble by a determinate Sound made at a di<U+017F>tance, which produced but <U+017F>uch an impul<U+017F>e of the Air, as could neither be <U+017F>een nor felt by the By-<U+017F>tanders, nor would communicate any <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible motion to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <U+017F>trings. 'Tis true, that in this ca<U+017F>e the <U+017F>tring, in which the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling was produced, was a <U+017F>ingle, long, <U+017F>lender and <U+017F>pringy body, fa<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at both ends to a <U+017F>table one; and therefore it may <U+017F>eem altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groundle<U+017F>s to expect, that any thing like this effect <U+017F>hould be by the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e produced in bodies that do not appear <U+017F>o qualified. But, as we el<U+017F>ewhere <U+017F>hew, that a certain degree or mea<U+017F>ure of ten<U+017F>ion is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104480:46"/>
to this Phaenomenon the principal Qualification, without which all the other would be unavailable; perhaps 'twill not be ab<U+017F>urd to enquire, <hi>whether,</hi> in bodies of a very differing appearance from <U+017F>trings, the various Textures, Connexions, and Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that Nature or Art, or both, may make of the parts, may not bring them to a <U+017F>tate equivalent to the Ten<U+017F>ions of the <U+017F>trings of Mu<U+017F>ical In<U+017F>truments, whereby divers of the mentioned parts may be <U+017F>tretched in the manner requi<U+017F>ite to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e them to receive a vibrating motion from <U+017F>ome peculiar Sounds: And <hi>whether</hi> the<U+017F>e trembling parts may not be nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous enough to affect their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and make, in the body they belong to, a tremulous motion di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible, though not by the Eye, yet by <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. This conjecture or inquiry you will, I hope, have the le<U+017F>s unfavourable thoughts of, when you <U+017F>hall have con<U+017F>idered the following Experiments.</p>
                  <p>I remember, that many years agoe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104480:46"/>
I found by trial, that, if a <U+017F>omewhat large and almo<U+017F>t hemi<U+017F>pherical Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, though not very thin, were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently placed, a determinate <U+017F>ound, made at a convenient di<U+017F>tance from the concave <U+017F>urface of the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, would make it <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly ring, as a Bell does a while after it has been <U+017F>truck. But this noi<U+017F>e was the effect of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate <U+017F>ound; for, though the voice were rai<U+017F>ed to a higher tone, or if the <U+017F>ound were made louder, the <U+017F>ame effect would not in<U+017F>ue. I remember al<U+017F>o, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, <U+017F>ome years after, I ob<U+017F>erved, that large empty drinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<U+017F><U+017F>es of fine white metal had each of them its determinate Ten<U+017F>ion, or <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition that was equivalent as to our purpo<U+017F>e. For, cau<U+017F>ing the <U+017F>trings of a Mu<U+017F>ical In<U+017F>trument to be variou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>crewed up, and let down, and briskly <U+017F>truck, we found, as I expected, that the motion of one <U+017F>tring, when 'twas <U+017F>tretched to a certain note or tone, would make one of the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es ring, and not the other; nor would the <U+017F>ound of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104480:47"/>
<U+017F>ame <U+017F>tring, tuned to another note, <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly affect the fir<U+017F>t Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, though perhaps it might have its operation upon another. And this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance is not, on this occa<U+017F>ion, to be omitted, that, after we had found the tone proper to one of the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <U+017F>o tuned the <U+017F>tring, that, (I <U+017F>ay) when that was <U+017F>truck, the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e would re<U+017F>ound. Having afterwards broken off a part of the foot of the gla<U+017F>s, yet not <U+017F>o much but that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to <U+017F>tand upright, the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ound of the <U+017F>tring would no longer be an<U+017F>wered by the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, but we were obliged to alter the ten<U+017F>ion of the <U+017F>tring, to produce the former ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The Learned <hi>Kircherus,</hi> as I have been informed, <U+017F>omewhere mentions a corre<U+017F>pondence between <U+017F>ome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours and <U+017F>ome determinate <U+017F>ounds; which I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e may be true, though the triall did not <U+017F>ucceed with me, perhaps for want of <U+017F>uch accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations for <U+017F>o nice an Experiment as I could have wi<U+017F>hed, but could not procure: But if you can, you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige

And that, which makes me apt to believe that this effect depends upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104480:48"/>
tone, rather than upon the loudne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>ound, is, that I have oftentimes felt, and diligently ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <U+017F>uch a kind of motion in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of my Hat, upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of <U+017F>ome words in ordinary di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; in which ca<U+017F>e the effect could not with probability be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the greatne<U+017F>s of the Sound, but its peculiar fitne<U+017F>s to communicate <U+017F>uch a motion to a body <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it onely in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>mall and yielding bodies, as Hats and Strings, that Sounds that are not boi<U+017F>terous may produce <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible effects, for, if they be congruous to the Texture of the body they are to work on, they may excite motions in it, though it be either <U+017F>olid or very bulky: of which I <U+017F>hall here <U+017F>ubjoyn a couple of in<U+017F>tances.</p>
                  <p>An ancient Mu<U+017F>ician affirmed to me, that, playing on a Ba<U+017F>e-viol in the chamber of one of his Scholars, when he came to <U+017F>trike a certain Note on a particular <U+017F>tring, he heard an odd kind of jarring Noi<U+017F>e, which he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104480:48"/>
thought at fir<U+017F>t had either been ca<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or proceeded from <U+017F>ome fault in the <U+017F>tring; but, having afterwards frequent occa<U+017F>ion to play in that <U+017F>ame room, he plainly found, that the Noi<U+017F>e, he marvelled at, was made by the tremulous motion of a Ca<U+017F>ement of a window, which would be made to tremble by a determinate <U+017F>ound of a particular <U+017F>tring, and not by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notes, whether higher or lower.</p>
                  <p>To this fir<U+017F>t In<U+017F>tance I <U+017F>hall add the <U+017F>econd, which, I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I was not forward to believe, till trial had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of the Truth; and I <U+017F>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled it the rather, becau<U+017F>e, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of determinate Sounds <U+017F>hould appear to proceed from the peculiar kind of tremulous motion into which the parts of the re<U+017F>onant body are put, it may incline men to <U+017F>o great a Paradox, as to think, that <U+017F>uch a motion of the Air as our Bodies do not feel, may produce a trembling in <U+017F>o <U+017F>olid a body as a Stone-wall of a great thickne<U+017F>s.

                  <p>Ye<U+017F>terday I went to <U+017F>atisfy my <U+017F>elf of the truth of what had been told me by an ancient Mu<U+017F>ician, to whom I had been relating what I had ob<U+017F>erved of the effects of <U+017F>ome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Sounds even upon Solid bodies, and of whom I enquired, if he had met with any thing of the like nature: taking him along with me, I found, that though the place be but an Arch, yet it would not an<U+017F>wer to all notes indifferently, when we <U+017F>tood in a certain place, but to a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Note, (which he afterwards told me was <hi>Ce fa ut</hi> a little flatted,) to which note it an<U+017F>wered very re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly, and not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly to others, which we made trial of, whether higher or lower than it; and, (which added to the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F>s,) when I made him rai<U+017F>e his voice to an Eighth, as con<U+017F>onant as tho<U+017F>e two Sounds are wont to be in all other ca<U+017F>es, the vaulted Arch did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

                  <p>THis Ob<U+017F>ervation will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <U+017F>eem paradoxicall.

As, when a bar of iron or <U+017F>ilver, having been well hammered, is newly taken off of the Anvill; though the Eye can di<U+017F>cern no motion in it, yet the touch will readily perceive it to be very hot, and, if you <U+017F>pit upon it, the brisk agitation of the in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible parts will become vi<U+017F>ible in that which they will produce in the liquour.

And on this occa<U+017F>ion I could add divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances taken not onely from the works of Art, but tho<U+017F>e of Nature too, if they did not belong to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paper: But, one <U+017F>ort of Ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations 'twill be proper to <U+017F>et down in this place; becau<U+017F>e in tho<U+017F>e al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, the bow and <U+017F>tring were brought into a violent <U+017F>tate by the meer and immediate force of man. I <U+017F>hall therefore add, that there are divers bodies, in which, though no <U+017F>uch kind of force appears to have antecedently acted on them, we may yet take notice of a <U+017F>tate of violent Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion or Exten<U+017F>ion, and a <U+017F>trong endeavour or tendency of the parts, that to the Eye or the Touch <U+017F>eem at re<U+017F>t, to <U+017F>hrink or to fly out; and this endeavour may in <U+017F>ome Ca<U+017F>es be more la<U+017F>ting and more forcible than one would ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect or believe.

<U+017F>ince in them 'tis like you have not met with either an In<U+017F>tance or a Conjecture to this purpo<U+017F>e; but <U+017F>ome few things that I tried my <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>ome others that I learnt by Inquiry from <U+017F>ome Trade<U+017F>men, whom I judged likelie<U+017F>t to inform me, I <U+017F>hall briefly acquaint you with.</p>
                  <p>I have <U+017F>ometimes ob<U+017F>erved my <U+017F>elf, and have had the Ob<U+017F>ervation confirmed to me by the ingeniou<U+017F>er Traders in Gla<U+017F>s; That a Gla<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>eemed to have been well baked, or nealed, (as they call it) would <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, many days or weeks, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps months, after it is taken from the fire, crack of its own accord; which <U+017F>eems for the mo<U+017F>t part to happen upon the <U+017F>core of the <U+017F>trong, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall, <U+017F>hrinking of the parts of the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e. And the Gla<U+017F>s-men will tell you, that, if they take their Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es too ha<U+017F>tily from the fire, not allowing them lei<U+017F>ure to cool by degrees, they will be very apt to crack. But I remember, that, to <U+017F>atisfy <U+017F>ome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104480:53"/>
men, I devi<U+017F>ed a way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting a much more quick and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of that kind. Having made then, by a way I el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where teach, a flat Lump of metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Gla<U+017F>s, two or three or four times as thick as an ordinary Drinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<U+017F>s, I ob<U+017F>erved, as I expected, that, though it had been melted in a very gentle fire, its very fu<U+017F>ible nature needing no other, and though it were removed but very little from the fire, it was <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>hrink upon a <U+017F>mall degree of Refrigeration, or rather abatement of Heat, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly cold, it would crack with a noi<U+017F>e in <U+017F>o vehement a manner, that, notwith<U+017F>tanding the ponderou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the matter; which had been purpo<U+017F>ely laid upon a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, parts of a con<U+017F>iderable bulk, weighing perhaps <U+017F>ome Drams, would fly, to a not incon<U+017F>iderable di<U+017F>tance from one another. And this Experiment I took plea<U+017F>ure to make more than once. And if you will be content with an In<U+017F>tance
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104480:53"/>
which, though otherwi<U+017F>e much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, may not be unwelcome, for its being ea<U+017F>ily and readily made; I <U+017F>hall offer you one that I have often repeated. Take a piece of Copper, (if the Plate be thick, 'tis <U+017F>o much the better,) and, having throughly brought it to a red or white Heat among kindled Coals, take it from the fire, and when it begins to cool a little, hold it over a <U+017F>heet or two of white Paper, and you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good <U+017F>tore of flakes to fly off, not without <U+017F>ome little noi<U+017F>e, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other, and <U+017F>ometimes perhaps as far as the farthermo<U+017F>t edges of the paper; which flakes or <U+017F>cales <U+017F>eem by their brittlene<U+017F>s and colour, to be but parts of the <U+017F>urface of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal vitrified by the vehement action of the fire, and afterwards by a too ha<U+017F>ty refrigeration <U+017F>hrinking <U+017F>o vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, as to crack and leap from one another, like the contiguous parts of the <U+017F>tring of a Viol or other Mu<U+017F>ical In<U+017F>trument, that breaks by the moi<U+017F>ture of the Air. And on
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104480:54"/>
this occa<U+017F>ion I <U+017F>hall add, that, having afterwards inquired of an expert Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, that made metalline Concaves, about the <U+017F>hrinking of his mixtures of metalls, he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed to me, that he u<U+017F>ually ob<U+017F>erved them to <U+017F>hrink upon Refrigeration. And the like I my <U+017F>elf have ob<U+017F>erved in Iron of a great thickne<U+017F>s, and purpo<U+017F>ely fitted to a hollow body of metall, which it would not enter when it was ignited, though it would when 'twas cold. But to <U+017F>hew you by a notable In<U+017F>tance or two, both that Metals may <U+017F>hrink, and that they may doe <U+017F>o with a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable force, I <U+017F>hall add, that I found by inquiry, that the lately mentioned Artificer, after he had made <U+017F>ome large Concaves of an unfit mixture of metals, and having removed them from the fire, had been very carefull to keep the cold Air from them, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould cool too ha<U+017F>tily, ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved yet to his great lo<U+017F>s, that, when they came to be further refrigerated, they would (perhaps after three hours) crack with a great noi<U+017F>e,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104480:54"/>
though this metalline mixture were perchance harder than Iron, and three or four times as thick as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Looking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es. But the mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of another Trade<U+017F>man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me a yet more con<U+017F>iderable <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> For this excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, whom I often employ, and with whom I was a while <U+017F>ince di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>ing of the<U+017F>e matters, complain'd to me, that, having lately ca<U+017F>t a kind of Bell-metall upon a very <U+017F>trong <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid In<U+017F>trument of Iron of a con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <U+017F>uperficial <hi>Area,</hi> though the metal were <U+017F>uffer'd in a warm room to cool, from about eight a clock on Saturday night till about ten or twelve on Monday morning, and were then (which is to be noted) con<U+017F>iderably hot to the touch; yet it cool'd <U+017F>o far, that, <U+017F>hrinking from the Iron that would not <U+017F>hrink with it, the Bell-metall cracked in divers places with noi<U+017F>es loud as the Report of a Pi<U+017F>toll, though the metall, he affirm'd to me, was an inch and half, or two inches thick. And the <U+017F>ame
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104480:55"/>
per<U+017F>on <U+017F>hewed me a large Cylinder of Iron, about which, for a certain purpo<U+017F>e, a Coat of Bell-metall had been ca<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome days before, on which (Bell-metall) there was a crack near one end made by the coldne<U+017F>s of the Iron, though the thickne<U+017F>s of the Bell-metall, as near as I could mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure it, exceeded an inch, and (as the Workman affirmed) an inch and a quarter.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it onely in <U+017F>uch mixtures as Bell-metall, which, though very hard, may be very brittle, but even in a metal that is malleable when cold, that the like Phaenomenon may be met with, as I have been a<U+017F><U+017F>ured by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ingenious Artificer, of whom I inquired, whether he had taken notice of the <U+017F>hrinking of metalls; who affirm'd to me, that, having had occa<U+017F>ion to ca<U+017F>t about a Cylinder of Iron a ring or hoop of Bra<U+017F>s, he found to his trouble, that, when the metall began to cool, the parts <U+017F>hrunk from one another <U+017F>o as to leave a gaping crack, which he was fain to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104480:55"/>
fill up with <U+017F>oulder quite cro<U+017F><U+017F>e the breadth of the ring, though this were above an inch thick.</p>
                  <p>I <U+017F>hould not, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> have in this Chapter entertained you with more Experiments of others than of my own, if I had the conveniency of living near Founders of metalls, as the Trade<U+017F>men had who<U+017F>e Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have rectied, and who<U+017F>e <U+017F>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in them I had no cau<U+017F>e to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion. And both their Experiments and mine <U+017F>eem to teach, that a body may be brought into a <U+017F>tate of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion, as well by being expanded and <U+017F>tretch'd by the action of the fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the minute parts, as by the action of an external Agent upon the intire body. And, to <U+017F>peak more generally, the <U+017F>tate of violent Contraction and Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion may not unfitly be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trated by a Bow that is bent. For, as the Bow it <U+017F>elf is brought to a <U+017F>tate of Compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion by the force of the Archer, that bent it; <U+017F>o by the Ela<U+017F>tical force of the bent Bow, the <U+017F>tring is brought into a violent <U+017F>tate
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104480:56"/>
of Ten<U+017F>ion, as may be made evident by the cutting off the <U+017F>tring in the middle; for then both the Bow will fly <U+017F>uddenly outwards, and the parts of the <U+017F>tring will <U+017F>wiftly and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>hrink from one another. And according to this Doctrine, the effect of other bodies upon <U+017F>uch as are thus brought into, what men call, a Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural <U+017F>tate, is not to be judg'd barely according to u<U+017F>ual mea<U+017F>ures, but with re<U+017F>pect to this latent Di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition of the Patient: as, for in<U+017F>tance, though the <U+017F>tring of a Viol not <U+017F>crew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, will not be hardned by the vapours that imbue the Air in moi<U+017F>t weather; yet a neighbouring <U+017F>tring of the <U+017F>ame In<U+017F>trument, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps much <U+017F>tronger, being <U+017F>crew'd up, and thereby <U+017F>tretched, will be <U+017F>o affected with tho<U+017F>e vapours, as to break with noi<U+017F>e and violence. And <U+017F>o when one part of a piece of Gla<U+017F>s is made as hot as can be, without appearing di<U+017F>colour'd to the Eye, though a drop or two of cold water have no effect upon the other part of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104480:56"/>
the <U+017F>ame Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet if it touch the heated part, who<U+017F>e wonted exten<U+017F>ion (as I have el<U+017F>ewhere proved) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by the fire that vehemently agitates the component particles, the cracking of the Gla<U+017F>s will almo<U+017F>t al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pre<U+017F>ently en<U+017F>ue.</p>
                  <p>If again<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e In<U+017F>tances it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to a<U+017F><U+017F>ign an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other cau<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>eemingly <U+017F>ponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous breaking of the bodies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in this Chapter, than that which I have propos'd, it will not much concern this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Allegation; for, whatever the latent Cau<U+017F>e of the Phaenomena may be, the manife<U+017F>t Circum<U+017F>tances of them <U+017F>uffice to <U+017F>hew, that bodies, which, as to <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, are in a natural <U+017F>tate of Re<U+017F>t, may be in a violent one, as of Ten<U+017F>ion, and may have, either upon the <U+017F>core of the contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the parts among them<U+017F>elves, or upon that of <U+017F>ome interfluent <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile matter, or <U+017F>ome other Phy<U+017F>ical Agent, a <U+017F>trong endeavour to fly off or recede from one another; and that,

in divers bodies, the cau<U+017F>e of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour may act more vigorou<U+017F>ly than one would ea<U+017F>ily believe: and this <U+017F>uffices to <U+017F>erve the turn of this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.

For, con<U+017F>idering with him one day a large lump of matter, which contained <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stones that he took for cour<U+017F>e Agats, and which were joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a Cement, that in mo<U+017F>t places was harder than mo<U+017F>t ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104480:57"/>
Stones, I perceived that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained divers pretty large cavities in this Cement, which <U+017F>eemed to have contained <U+017F>uch Stones as tho<U+017F>e that yet made parts of the lump. Upon which occa<U+017F>ion he affirmed to me, that <U+017F>everal of the Stones grew whil<U+017F>t they were lodg'd in tho<U+017F>e cavities. And when I told him, that, though I had been long of an opinion, that Stones may receive an increment after their fir<U+017F>t formation, yet I did not <U+017F>ee how any <U+017F>uch thing appeared by tho<U+017F>e we were looking upon: He gave me in many words an account of his A<U+017F><U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I reduced to this, that the Stones he <U+017F>poke of, did, after they were fir<U+017F>t formed, really tend to expand them<U+017F>elves by virtue of <U+017F>ome Principle of growth, which he could not intelligibly de<U+017F>cribe; but that the<U+017F>e Stones being lodg'd in a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extreamly hard, and therefore not capable of being forced to give way, their expan<U+017F>ive endeavour was rendered ineffectual, but not de<U+017F>troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <U+017F>o that when afterwards the<U+017F>e
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104480:58"/>
Stones came to be taken out of the Cement wherein they were bedded, and to who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ides 'tis like they were not exqui<U+017F>itely congruous, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>t Stones, having their <U+017F>ides now no longer wedged in by the harder Cement, quickly expanded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, as if 'twere by an internal and violently compre<U+017F>t <U+017F>pring, and would pre<U+017F>ently bur<U+017F>t a<U+017F>under, <U+017F>ome into two, and <U+017F>ome into more pieces: of which he pre<U+017F>ented many to his friends, but yet had re<U+017F>erved <U+017F>ome, whereof he pre<U+017F>ented me one, that I have yet by me, together with <U+017F>ome of the ma<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e Cement I find to bear a better poli<U+017F>h than mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to be very much harder than it. And, in an<U+017F>wer to <U+017F>ome que<U+017F>tions of mine, he told me, that he had taken up the<U+017F>e Stones him<U+017F>elf, naming the place to me, which was not very far off, and that he ob<U+017F>erved all that he told me him<U+017F>elf, and more than once or twice, and that I needed not <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as I <U+017F>eemed to doe, that 'twas the <U+017F>trokes employed to force the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104480:58"/>
Stones out of their Beds, that made them break. For, be<U+017F>ides that many of them, which (it <U+017F>eems) were not compre<U+017F>t enough, did not break, <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of tho<U+017F>e, that did, were taken out, without offering them any <U+017F>uch violence, as that their bur<U+017F>ting could with any probability be imputed to it.</p>

                        <hi>Ob<U+017F>ervat.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THis Ob<U+017F>ervation is like to be much more readily under<U+017F>tood than granted, and therefore I <U+017F>hall offer by way of proof the following Experiments.</p>
                  <p>We cau<U+017F>ed in a large bra<U+017F>s Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock the movable part to be nimbly turned to and fro in the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cavity of that part that was made to receive it, in that part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trument that is wont to be kept fixt. And though this motion of the Key
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104480:59"/>
were made onely by the bare hand, yet in a <U+017F>hort time the mutual attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the contiguous parts of the In<U+017F>trument made <U+017F>o brisk an agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the other parts, that the inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>cence made the metal it <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>well, in<U+017F>omuch that the Key could no more be turned, but remained fixt, as if it had been wedged in, <U+017F>o that, to make it work as before, it was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary by cooling it to make it <U+017F>hrink a little, and <U+017F>o take off the mutual pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the Key, and the other part of the Stop-cock. Nor is this to be looked on as a ca<U+017F>ual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment; for, be<U+017F>ides that it was made more than once, and is very analogous to <U+017F>ome other trials of mine; I found, that a maker of <U+017F>uch In<U+017F>truments complained to me, that he was <U+017F>everal times forced to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his work, and plunge his In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in cold water, before he could, by grinding, adju<U+017F>t the Key to the cavity it ought to fit.</p>
                  <p>I pre<U+017F>ume I need not take notice to you, that this Experiment confirms
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104480:60"/>
what I el<U+017F>ewhere mention of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation of metals them<U+017F>elves by Heat, and therefore I proceed to the next In<U+017F>tance.</p>
                  <p>This is afforded by the known Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing one's wetted fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon the orifice of a Drinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<U+017F>s almo<U+017F>t fill'd with water. For, though the Eye does not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly di<U+017F>cern any motion, that, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of the pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the finger, is made by one part of the gla<U+017F>s upon another; yet, That a vibrating moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thereby produced, may be argued by the dancing of the water, e<U+017F>pecially that which is contiguous to the pre<U+017F>t <U+017F>ides of the gla<U+017F>s, by which 'tis oftentimes <U+017F>o agitated, that numerous drops are made to leap quite over, and others are to<U+017F><U+017F>ed up to a good height into the Air. And that there may be con<U+017F>iderable motions in the <U+017F>ides of the gla<U+017F>s, whil<U+017F>t it does not break in pieces, we may probably gue<U+017F>s by this, that, in Drinking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es artificially cut by a <U+017F>piral line, both I, and others, have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104480:60"/>
often found by trial, that, a gla<U+017F>s being dextrou<U+017F>ly inverted and <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the parts will vibrate up and down <U+017F>o manife<U+017F>tly, as <U+017F>ometimes to lengthen the gla<U+017F>s, by my e<U+017F>timate, a quarter of an inch or more, and yet, the gla<U+017F>s being <U+017F>et again upon its foot, it appeared that it had not been hereby at all injured.</p>
                  <p>That two pieces of Iron or Steel, by being <U+017F>trongly rubbed again<U+017F>t one another, will at length acquire a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Heat, is not hard to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but that an edg'd Tool of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened Steel <U+017F>hould, by having its edge rubbed again<U+017F>t, have a manife<U+017F>t and permanent change made in its Texture, you did not perhaps <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect; and yet, having had the Curio<U+017F>ity to cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome metals, and particularly Iron and Steel, to be turned by an excellent Artificer, I learned partly by his experience, and partly by my own, that the edge of the Steel-tool, with which he by degrees <U+017F>haved off the protuberant parts of the metal, would be <U+017F>o heated and agitated,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104480:61"/>
that, in no long time, if care were not taken to prevent it, the tool would be brought to look of blewi<U+017F>h and yellowi<U+017F>h colours, and, permanently lo<U+017F>ing its former temper, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <U+017F>o <U+017F>oft, as to be u<U+017F>ele<U+017F><U+017F>e for its former work, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it were again artificially hardened: and therefore, to prevent the trouble of tempering his tools again, this Arti<U+017F>t, from time to time, dipt it, when it began to grow too hot, into a certain liquour, which he affirms, upon much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to have a peculiar fitne<U+017F>s for that purpo<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it always nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that the body, that makes the parts of an inanimate body work con<U+017F>iderably on one another, <U+017F>hould be either very hard, or impetuou<U+017F>ly moved. For, I remember, that, having once by me <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hort bars of fine Tin, I re<U+017F>olved to try whether, meerly with my naked hands, (which you know are none of the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t or harde<U+017F>t,)<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I could not procure a con<U+017F>iderable internal Commotion among the parts;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104480:61"/>
and accordingly, laying hold on the two ends of the bar with my two hands, I <U+017F>lowly bent the bar towards me and from me two or three times, and having by this means broke or cracked it in the mid<U+017F>t, I perceived, as I expected, that the middle parts had con<U+017F>iderably heated each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>What u<U+017F>e may be made of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in the <U+017F>earch of the hidden cau<U+017F>e of Ela<U+017F>ticity, would be le<U+017F>s properly con<U+017F>idered in this place than in another. But <U+017F>ince I have named that Quality, I <U+017F>hall take this ri<U+017F>e to intimate, that if the re<U+017F>titution of a <U+017F>pringy body, <U+017F>orcibly bent, proceed onely (as <U+017F>ome Learned Moderns would have it) from the endeavour of the compre<U+017F>t parts them<U+017F>elves to recover their former <U+017F>tate, one may not impertinently take notice of the Ela<U+017F>ticity that Iron, Silver and Bra<U+017F>s acquire by hammering, among the In<U+017F>tances that <U+017F>hew what in <U+017F>ome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es may be done by a motion wherein the parts of the <U+017F>ame body are, by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104480:62"/>
an almo<U+017F>t unheeded force, put to act upon one another. But if Springi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s depend chiefly upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<U+017F>ion of a <U+017F>ubtile matter, as the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>ians</hi> would have it, then the In<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will properly belong to another Subject.</p>
                  <p>§ The foregoing Examples may al<U+017F>o <U+017F>uffice to make out (what I am unwilling to refer to another Head) this <U+017F>ubordinate Ob<U+017F>ervation, That men are more u<U+017F>ually than ju<U+017F>tly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with an opinion, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing con<U+017F>iderable is to be expected from the motion of a body again<U+017F>t another, unle<U+017F>s the former do make a manife<U+017F>t percu<U+017F><U+017F>ion or tru<U+017F>ion of the latter.

                     </gap> make it crack from the edge to the middle; which <U+017F>eemed the more <U+017F>trange, becau<U+017F>e we fee, what inten<U+017F>e degrees of Heat gla<U+017F><U+017F>es will endure without cracking, if the fire be but gradually applied, as this Arti<U+017F>t's gla<U+017F><U+017F>es mu<U+017F><gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But I think it worth inquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this ca<U+017F>e the whole work be performed by meer Heat, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there intervene not a peculiar kind of motion, into which <U+017F>ome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to be put by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar kind of friction, which <U+017F>eems fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to produce in manife<U+017F>tly <U+017F>pringy bodies, and perhaps in <U+017F>ome others, (of which divers may be <U+017F>pringy that are not commonly taken to be <U+017F>o,) <U+017F>uch a vibrating or reciprocal motion, as may have <U+017F>ome notable effects, that are not wont to be produced by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104480:63"/>
moderate Heats, nor always by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<U+017F>e ones them<U+017F>elves. The trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the parts of a Drinking-gla<U+017F>s, and the vi<U+017F>ible vibration of the long and great <U+017F>trings of a Ba<U+017F>e-viol, upon peculiar <U+017F>ounds, may give <U+017F>ome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to this conjecture. And that in <U+017F>ome bodies there may be <U+017F>uch a tremulous motion produced, by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them upon <U+017F>o <U+017F>oft a thing as Wool, or upon a piece of Cloath, I tried by this Experiment:</p>
                  <p>We ca<U+017F>t into a hollow Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, very <U+017F>mooth within, and of an almo<U+017F>t He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>pherical figure, <U+017F>everall ounces of good melted Brim<U+017F>tone, and having <U+017F>uffered it to cool, and taken it out, the Convex <U+017F>urface, as had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired, came off well poli<U+017F>hed; then this conveniently <U+017F>haped lump, which had (if I well remember) four or five inches in Diameter, being briskly rubbed in the <U+017F>ame line forwards and backwards, upon a Cu<U+017F>hion or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch woollen thing, in a place free from other noi<U+017F>es, I could, by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my ear to it, and attentively li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tening,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104480:63"/>
plainly hear a crackling noi<U+017F>e made by the agitated parts, which continued a brisk, and, as I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, a vibrating motion for <U+017F>ome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the friction was ended.</p>
                  <p>That there may be a con<U+017F>iderable Commotion produced among the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts of bodies, by rubbing them even again<U+017F>t <U+017F>oft bodies, I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times ob<U+017F>erved, by the <U+017F>ulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous <U+017F>teams that I could <U+017F>mell, if, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having a little rubbed a lump of good Sulphur upon my Cloaths, I pre<U+017F>ently held it to my no<U+017F>e. Which brings into my mind, that I have had the like effect from much harder and clo<U+017F>er bodies than Sulphur, when they were rubbed upon bodies that were <U+017F>o too. For having purpo<U+017F>ely taken hard Stones cut out of mens Bladders, and rubbed a couple of them a little again<U+017F>t one another, they quickly afforded, as I expected, a rank <U+017F>mell of <U+017F>tale Urin.</p>
                  <p>That Diamonds them<U+017F>elves will, by rubbing upon woollen cloaths, be made Electrical, <U+017F>eems to argue, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104480:64"/>
even Their parts are <U+017F>et a moving: And that the Commotion reaches to the internal parts, I am the more apt to think, becau<U+017F>e I have a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, that, if I rub it well and luckily again<U+017F>t my Cloaths, will, for a little while, <U+017F>hine or glimmer in the dark; which is the <U+017F>ame Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon that I el<U+017F>ewhere relate my <U+017F>elf to have produced in the King's larger Diamond, by giving it one brisk <U+017F>troke with the point of a bodkin, where the Light that pre<U+017F>ently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Gem, <U+017F>eemed not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable to any thing <U+017F>o likely as the <U+017F>udden Commotion made in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts of that peculiarly con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Stone.</p>
                  <p>What a peculiar modification of motion, di<U+017F>tinct from its degrees of <hi>Impetus,</hi> may doe in Fluid bodies, we have formerly in this E<U+017F><U+017F>ay taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. But perhaps it may be worth while to enquire, what kinds there are of it, and what effects they may have in the parts of Solid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies them<U+017F>elves. For I have ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,

that though tho<U+017F>e Stones that the <hi>Italian</hi> Gla<U+017F>s-men u<U+017F>e are very hard, and, if I mi<U+017F>remember not, have <U+017F>everal times afforded me <U+017F>parks of fire by Colli<U+017F>ion; yet, by rubbing them a little one again<U+017F>t another, I found, that <U+017F>uch an agitation was made in their parts, as to make them throw out <U+017F>tore of foetid exhalations: And 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly to the <U+017F>tony Ingredient that Gla<U+017F>s owes the Quality I have ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it, and el<U+017F>ewhere mentioned, of emitting offen<U+017F>ive <U+017F>teams. And 'tis remarkable to our pre<U+017F>ent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e, that, though <U+017F>o vehement an agitation of the parts, as is given to Gla<U+017F>s by Heat, when 'tis made almo<U+017F>t red-hot in the fire, does not make it <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly emit odours; yet barely by dextrou<U+017F>ly rubbing two <U+017F>olid pieces of Gla<U+017F>s again<U+017F>t one another, one may, in a minute of an hour, make tho<U+017F>e fixed bodies emit <U+017F>uch copious <U+017F>teams as I found, not onely <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly, but rankly, foetid; though one would think tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>tinking exhalations very indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to be forced off, <U+017F>ince they

                  <p>There are few things that <U+017F>hew better, both how the parts of Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical bodies communicate their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating motions to one another, and how brisk tho<U+017F>e motions are, than that which happens upon the <U+017F>triking of a large Bell with a Clapper or a Hammer. For though the <U+017F>troak be immediately made but upon one part; yet the motion, thereby produced, is propagated to the oppo<U+017F>ite, and the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ive vibrations of the <U+017F>mall parts do, even in <U+017F>o <U+017F>olid and clo<U+017F>e a body as Bell-metal, run many times round; as may appear by the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene<U+017F>s of the ringing noi<U+017F>e, which <U+017F>eems plainly to proceed from the circularly <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ive vibrations of the parts, which, unle<U+017F>s they briskly tremble them<U+017F>elves, can <U+017F>carcely be conceived to be fitted to give the Air that tremulous motion, who<U+017F>e effect on the Ear, when the fir<U+017F>t and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104480:65"/>
loud noi<U+017F>e, made by the percu<U+017F><U+017F>ion, is pa<U+017F>t, we call Ringing. And this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts of the <U+017F>ounding Bell may be further argued by this, that, if the finger, or <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>oft body, be laid upon it, the <U+017F>ound will be checked or deaded, and much more, if a broad <U+017F>tring, though of a <U+017F>oft <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, be tied about it. And not onely an attentive Ear may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten make us gue<U+017F>s, that the ringing <U+017F>ound is produced by a motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated circularly in the Bell, but this vibrating motion may <U+017F>ometimes be al<U+017F>o felt by the tremulous motion communicated by the trembling parts of the Bell to the finger, that is wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to it. That this motion pa<U+017F><U+017F>es in a round, from one <U+017F>ide of the Bell to the other, <U+017F>eems manife<U+017F>t by the great difference of <U+017F>ound, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially in regard of ringing, that may be ob<U+017F>erved in a <U+017F>ound Bell, and in a crack'd one; where yet all the matter and the former figure are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved, onely the intirene<U+017F>s or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, which is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104480:66"/>
(if I may <U+017F>o call it) of the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous motion, is at the Crack <U+017F>topt or hindred. And that the motion of the parts is very brisk, may be gue<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed partly by what has been <U+017F>aid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; but much more if that be true, which, not onely is traditionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by many, but has been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to me by <U+017F>everal Artificers that deal in Bells, who averred, as an experienced thing, That if a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <U+017F>ized Bell were bound about, any thing hard, with a broad <U+017F>tring, and then <U+017F>truck with the u<U+017F>ual force, that it would otherwi<U+017F>e bear very well; that percu<U+017F><U+017F>ion would break it, giving a di<U+017F>orderly check to the brisk motion of the parts of the Bell, whereof <U+017F>ome happening to be much more (and otherwi<U+017F>e) agitated than others, the force of their motion <U+017F>urmounts that of their Cohe<U+017F>ion, and <U+017F>o produces a Crack.</p>
                  <p>But, in regard great Bells are not ea<U+017F>ie to be procured, nor to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged when one has acce<U+017F><U+017F>e to them, I <U+017F>hall add, that I took the Bell of a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104480:66"/>
large Watch, or very <U+017F>mall Clock made of fine Bell-metall, which had no handle or other thing put to it, <U+017F>ave a little Bodkin or skiver of wood, who<U+017F>e point we thru<U+017F>t into the hole that is u<U+017F>ually left in the middle of the <hi>Ba<U+017F>is;</hi> and this <U+017F>harp piece of wood <U+017F>erving for a handle to keep the Bell <U+017F>teady enough, we placed in the cavity of it, near the edges, (for that Circum<U+017F>tance mu<U+017F>t not be omitted,) <U+017F>ome black mineral Sand, or, in want of that, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall filings of Steel or Copper, or <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>uch minute and <U+017F>olid Powder, which yet mu<U+017F>t not be too <U+017F>mall, and then <U+017F>triking moderately with the Key again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ide of the Bell, we ob<U+017F>erved, (as we expected) that, whil<U+017F>t it continued briskly ringing, it made many of the filings to dance up and down, and <U+017F>ometimes to leap up, almo<U+017F>t like the drops of Water, formerly mentioned to skip, when the brim of the Gla<U+017F>s was circularly pre<U+017F>t by the wetted finger. Which prompts me to add, that, having put a middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ized
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104480:67"/>
drop of water (for in this ca<U+017F>e the quantity is a con<U+017F>iderable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tance) near the lower edge of the Bell, 'twas ea<U+017F>ie to make it vi<U+017F>ibly tremble, and be as it were covered over with little waves, by a <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what brisk <U+017F>troke of the Key on the oppo<U+017F>ite <U+017F>ide. And this effect was more con<U+017F>picuous, when a very large drop of water was placed near the edge, on the convex <U+017F>ide of a hand-Bell, who<U+017F>e Clapper was kept from any where touching the in<U+017F>ide of it. And to obviate their jealou<U+017F>ie, that, not having <U+017F>een the manner of the above-mentioned motion of the Sand, might <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that 'twas produced by the impul<U+017F>e which the Bell, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire body, received from the percu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion made by the Key, we <U+017F>everal times forbare putting-in the filings, till after the <U+017F>troke had been given; which <U+017F>atisfied the Spectatours, that the dancing and leaping of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute bodies proceeded from the <U+017F>ame drisk vibrations of the <U+017F>mall parts of the Bell, which, at the <U+017F>ame time
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104480:67"/>
<U+017F>triking al<U+017F>o the Air, produced a ringing <U+017F>ound, which might very well, as it did, out-la<U+017F>t the skipping of the filings; the exceedingly minute par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Air being much more ea<U+017F>ily agitable, than the compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively gro<U+017F>s and heavy Corpu<U+017F>cles of the Powder. And this <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment had in a Bell, that little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded an inch and half in Diameter.</p>

                  <p>HAving heretofore had occa<U+017F>ion to draw together under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Heads, divers unpubli<U+017F>h'd Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervations and Experiments of my own, and <U+017F>ome of other men, by way of <hi>Memorials for a Natural Hi<U+017F>tory of the Air;</hi> I thought fit by more largely treating of two or three of the Subjects di<U+017F>tinctly mention'd in my Scheme of Titles, to give a Semplar or <hi>Specimen</hi> of what may be done upon the other Heads of the de<U+017F>igned Hi<U+017F>tory. <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>pon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="tcp:104480:71"/>
I treated <U+017F>omewhat largely of the <hi>Salubrity and In<U+017F>alubrity of the Air,</hi> as a Subject, which for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of it to Mens healths and lives, I thought de<U+017F>erv'd to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively con<U+017F>ider'd, and have its Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es diligently inquir'd into. And having ob<U+017F>erv'd that among the <U+017F>ix principal Cau<U+017F>es of the healthfulne<U+017F>s or in<U+017F>alubrity of the Air, namely the <hi>Climate,</hi> the <hi>Soil,</hi> the <hi>Situation</hi> of the <hi>Place,</hi> the <hi>Sea<U+017F>ons</hi> of the Year, the <hi>raigning winds</hi> and <hi>Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> (whether more or le<U+017F>s frequent) and e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Subterraneal Steams,</hi> having I <U+017F>ay ob<U+017F>erv'd that among the<U+017F>e Cau<U+017F>es there was <hi>one,</hi> viz. the la<U+017F>t nam'd, about which, I thought I could offer <U+017F>omething, that I had not met with in the Books of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians that treat of it; I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by invited to <U+017F>et down my Thoughts and Ob<U+017F>ervations by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, which I was made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve would appear uncommon, and
<pb facs="tcp:104480:71"/>
would not prove u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s. The<U+017F>e Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervations and Reflexions I referr'd for clearne<U+017F>s and di<U+017F>tinctions <U+017F>ake to four Propo<U+017F>itions. But when I had gone thorough the three fir<U+017F>t, and made <U+017F>ome progre<U+017F>s in the fourth, being hinder'd by divers Avocations to make an end of it, I laid by the whole Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e in a place which I thought a <U+017F>afe one, but when afterwards I had <U+017F>ome oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to di<U+017F>patch what remain'd, I found all the diligence I us'd to retrieve the entire Manu<U+017F>cript un<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfull. At this <U+017F>urprizing Accident I confe<U+017F>s I was <U+017F>omewhat troubled; becau<U+017F>e whatever may be thought of the di<U+017F>cur<U+017F>ive part of tho<U+017F>e Papers, the Hi<U+017F>torical part contain'd divers matters of Fact, that I did not meet with in Books, nor can now di<U+017F>tinctly remember, and will not perhaps be lighted on by even Phy<U+017F>icians, or <U+017F>uch Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>ts as derive their knowledge one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:104480:72"/>
from them. 'Tis upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ideration, that having afterwards met with many Papers that belong'd to mo<U+017F>t parts of the unhappy di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e, I thought fit to put them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the be<U+017F>t order I could, that I might not loo<U+017F>e what might give <U+017F>ome light to <U+017F>o important a Subject as the Theory of Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es. And this cour<U+017F>e I the rather pitch'd upon, becau<U+017F>e before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers about the Salubrity of the Air, I mi<U+017F>s'd two other of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<U+017F>cripts, whereof the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Cellection of Medicinal things, and the <U+017F>econd a defence of the Mechanical way of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophizing about Natural Things, as it re<U+017F>pects Religion. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd that having formerly lo<U+017F>t a Manu<U+017F>cript I was much concern'd for, I purpo<U+017F>ely made a noi<U+017F>e of it, whence I <U+017F>uppos'd the Plagiary would conclude him<U+017F>elf unable to make it pa<U+017F>s for his. And in effect
<pb facs="tcp:104480:72"/>
the Book was in a while after pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately brought back, <U+017F>o that I found it laid in a By-place, where I had before as fruitle<U+017F>ly as carefully <U+017F>ought it.</p>

                     <list>
                        <item>1. There are <U+017F>ome places, in which the Endemical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e cannot be probably imputed to any manife<U+017F>t
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104480:83"/>
Cau<U+017F>e; as he may perceive that <U+017F>hall con<U+017F>ider how often it happens, that the Cau<U+017F>es which are a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd of <U+017F>uch Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, if they were the true ones, mu<U+017F>t produce the like Di<U+017F>tempers in many other places, where yet it is notorious that they are not <hi>Endemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. That Subterraneal Bodies may <U+017F>end up copious Steams, of different kinds, into the Air, has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made out.</item>
                        <item>3. It has been al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hewn, that the Matters that <U+017F>end up the<U+017F>e <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> may be of a large extent. And I remember on this occa<U+017F>ion that I have <U+017F>ometimes ob<U+017F>erv'd, and that in more Countries than one, a whole tract of Land that abounded with Minerals of one kind; and within no great di<U+017F>tance, as perhaps a Mile or a League, another large tract of Land, who<U+017F>e Subterraneal part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with Minerals of a very differing <U+017F>ort.</item>
                        <item>4. We have al<U+017F>o above declar'd, and 'tis highly probable from the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104480:84"/>
nature of the thing it <U+017F>elf, that tho<U+017F>e copious <U+017F>teams (Saline, Sulphureous, Ar<U+017F>enical, Antimonial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the Air, may very much conduce to make it hurtfull to a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, in the way requi<U+017F>ite to produce this or that determinate Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: as I not long <U+017F>ince related from the Chymi<U+017F>t that vi<U+017F>ited the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Mines, that in <U+017F>ome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he found the Reeks a<U+017F>cending from them into the Air (though in an elevated place, and expos'd to the Winds) make him as it were A<U+017F>thmatical, and give him a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<U+017F>ome difficulty of Re<U+017F>piration. And here let me add an Ob<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which perhaps will not be thought fit to be <U+017F>lighted by Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians: namely, that <U+017F>ome parts of the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Air (for I <U+017F>peak not of its Heat, Coldne<U+017F>s, or other <U+017F>uch Qualities) do not onely affect humane bodies, or at lea<U+017F>t many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals among them, as they are taken in by Re<U+017F>piration, but as they outwardly touch the Skin: and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104480:84"/>
Skin being (as I have el<U+017F>ewhere <U+017F>hewn) full of Pores, and tho<U+017F>e perhaps of different <U+017F>izes and figures, tho<U+017F>e Corpu<U+017F>cles that get in at them may have their operation, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mo<U+017F>t inward parts of the body. To make this more clear and probable, becau<U+017F>e 'tis a thing of importance, I de<U+017F>ire the<U+017F>e things may be ob<U+017F>erv'd.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. That when I <U+017F>peak of the Air, I do not in this place under<U+017F>tand that Air, which I el<U+017F>ewhere teach to be more <U+017F>trictly and properly <U+017F>o call'd, and to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of <hi><U+017F>pringy</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; but the Air in its more vulgar and laxe <U+017F>ignification, as it <U+017F>ignifies the Atmo<U+017F>phere, which abounds with vapours, and exhalations, and in a word with Corpu<U+017F>cles of all <U+017F>orts, except the larger <U+017F>ort of <U+017F>pringy ones; and many of them may be <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>olid, or <U+017F>o conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <U+017F>hap'd, as to get entrance at <U+017F>ome of the numerous Orifices of the minute or miliary Glandules of the Skin, or at other Pores of it.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104480:85"/>
Thus, though paper be not pervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the uncompre<U+017F>s'd ela<U+017F>tical parts of the Air, yet it may be ea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penetrated by other Corpu<U+017F>cles of the Atmo<U+017F>phere: for I remember, I have for Curio<U+017F>ities <U+017F>ake prepar'd a dry body, out of a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Animal Kingdom, which being lapt up in paper, would, without wetting or di<U+017F>colouring, or any way <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly altering it, pa<U+017F>s in a trice through the Pores of it in <U+017F>uch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to have not onely a vi<U+017F>ible, but a manife<U+017F>t operation on bodies plac'd at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance from it. And though a bladder almo<U+017F>t full of Air, having its neck well tyed, be held near the fire in various po<U+017F>tures, the ela<U+017F>tical Air, though rarefied, or attenuated by the heat, will rather bur<U+017F>t the bladder, (as I have more than once found) than get out at the Pores, yet we have often made a certain <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, belonging to the Mineral Kingdom, that, if a bladder were wet or moi<U+017F>t, (as the Skins of living Men are wont to be) would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104480:85"/>
pervade it, and have a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible operation, even upon <U+017F>olid bodies plac'd within it. This Experiment (that I can repeat when I will) is therefore the more con<U+017F>iderable to our pre<U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e in the bladder of a dead <hi>Animal,</hi> the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<U+017F>ity may be well <U+017F>uppos'd to be much le<U+017F>s than it was in the Animal when alive; in which <U+017F>tate the parts of the humane body are much more per<U+017F>pirable than one would ea<U+017F>ily believe, partly becau<U+017F>e of the heat that is continually diffus'd from the heart, and partly becau<U+017F>e of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious <U+017F>teams that are in perpetual motion, and keep the parts warm, moi<U+017F>t and <U+017F>upple: And it is not to be pretermitted in our pre<U+017F>ent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, that the bladder of Urine con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts not of a <U+017F>ingle Membrane, and is probably of a <U+017F>tronger tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>ubtile <U+017F>alt liquor it is in<U+017F>tituted to contain, than many another Membranes of the body, or the Epidermis. And this is the fir<U+017F>t thing I would have noted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:104480:86"/>The next is, that, whereas in the In<U+017F>tances newly recited, and <U+017F>ome others that are by and by to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, the effects were produc'd when the ambient Air, impregnated with Mineral Corpu<U+017F>cles, had but a very <U+017F>hort time (perhaps not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minutes) to work upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies expos'd to it: In tho<U+017F>e Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that are very <U+017F>ubject to Endemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, the Inhabitants are wont to live all the year long, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps during their whole life, expos'd to the action of the vitiated Air: and how much a far <U+017F>horter time will <U+017F>erve, to make the Corpu<U+017F>cles that rove in the Air, penetrate into bodies of no very clo<U+017F>e contexture, may be gue<U+017F>s'd by the breaking even of the bigger <U+017F>trings of Lutes and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, by the numerous (though invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible) vapours, that get into them in rainy weather; and much more by the effects of <U+017F>uch vapours, when in<U+017F>inuating them<U+017F>elves in <U+017F>warms into the Pores of a Rope, they <U+017F>horten it <U+017F>o forcibly, as to enable it, by <U+017F>hrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

The<U+017F>e things may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it probable, that, <hi>though</hi> in a <U+017F>mall compa<U+017F>s of time the noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> that rove in the Air, may be too thinly di<U+017F>pers'd in it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inuate them<U+017F>elves in any con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number at the Pores of the Skin; <hi>yet,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of the continual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of the Air, (e<U+017F>pecially as to the Face, Hands, and <U+017F>ome other parts) which may la<U+017F>t day and night for many months, or perhaps years, there may be opportunity for a con<U+017F>iderable number of morbifick Particles, to in<U+017F>inuate them<U+017F>elves into the cutaneous Pores.</p>
                     <p>3.

                     <p>One con<U+017F>iderable Objection I fore<U+017F>ee may be made, again<U+017F>t the Propo<U+017F>ition I have been all this while endeavouring to render pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; namely, that 'tis <U+017F>carce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, that in <U+017F>o many Ages as <hi>Endemical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es</hi> have afflicted <U+017F>ome Countries, the Subterraneal Matter, to which I do in great part im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute <U+017F>ome of them, <U+017F>hould not be

wa<U+017F>ted and <U+017F>pent. I might perhaps on this occa<U+017F>ion move a doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have had <U+017F>uch continued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the temperature of the Air, of all the Countries where Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are now <hi>Endemical,</hi> as to know that they have been always <U+017F>o; and that <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es have not been worn out here or there, and <U+017F>ome others have not of later Ages begun to appear in this or that place. But contenting my <U+017F>elf at pre<U+017F>ent to have hinted this Que<U+017F>tion, I <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>tay to di<U+017F>cu<U+017F>s it; but proceed to offer three things, by way of direct an<U+017F>wer to the Objection.</p>
                     <p>1. And fir<U+017F>t, I think it very po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible, that divers Subterraneal Bodies that emit <hi>Effluvia,</hi> may have in them a kind of propagative or <U+017F>elf mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying power: I will not here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, whether this proceed from <U+017F>ome <U+017F>eminal Principle, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chymi<U+017F>ts and others a<U+017F>cribe to Metals, and even to <U+017F>tones, or (which is perhaps more likely) to <U+017F>omething analagous to a Firment, <U+017F>uch as in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104480:90"/>
Vegetables enables a little <U+017F>our dough to extend it <U+017F>elf through the whole Ma<U+017F>s; or <U+017F>uch, as when an Apple or Pear is bruis'd in one part, makes the putrify'd part by degrees to tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute the <U+017F>ound into it's own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s; or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome maturative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereby an inanimate Body may gradually admit of <U+017F>uch a change, or acquire <U+017F>uch Qualities, as may be in Mens e<U+017F>timate perfective of it, and perhaps give it a new denomination; as <hi>Anana</hi>'s in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and Medlars, and <U+017F>ome other fruits here in <hi>Europe,</hi> do after they are gathered, acquire (as it were, <U+017F>pontaneou<U+017F>ly) in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s of time, a con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence and <U+017F>weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>ometimes Colour and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and in <U+017F>hort <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tate as by one word we call <hi>maturity</hi> or <hi>ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s:</hi> and <U+017F>o <U+017F>ome Metalline Ores, and <U+017F>ome Mineral Earths them<U+017F>elves, have been ob<U+017F>erv'd by Mineralogi<U+017F>ts, to acquire in tract of time <U+017F>uch a change, as to afford <U+017F>ome Metal or other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which either it did not afford before, or at lea<U+017F>t did not afford
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104480:91"/>
<U+017F>o copiou<U+017F>ly, or <U+017F>o well qualify'd. This I have purpo<U+017F>ely made out in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paper: and the Ob<U+017F>ervation particularly holds as to <hi>Niter,</hi> which is thought to be the mo<U+017F>t Catholick Fo<U+017F><U+017F>ile we have; and to be at lea<U+017F>t one of tho<U+017F>e Fo<U+017F><U+017F>iles, that do the mo<U+017F>t plentifully emit <hi>Effluvia</hi> into the Air.</p>
                     <p>2. When I con<U+017F>ider, that even in tho<U+017F>e Mines that are accounted deep ones, the Spades of Men are not wont to reach to the ten thou<U+017F>andth part of the thickne<U+017F>s of the Earth, between its Surface, and its Centre, which yet is but its Semi-diametre; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but confe<U+017F>s, that we know very little of the Nature or Con<U+017F>titution of the lower part of the Terre<U+017F>trial Globe; <U+017F>ince we know little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing experimentally, of what lyes beneath that Comparatively very thin Cru<U+017F>t or Scurf, (if I may <U+017F>o call it) that Humane Indu<U+017F>try has been hitherto confin'd to. And upon this account I do not think it ab<U+017F>urd to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, that from the lower Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104480:91"/>
Regions there may be, either continually, or periodically, emitted into the Region of Mines (if I may <U+017F>o call it) great <U+017F>tore, and variety of Mineral Exhalations, which may continually repair the lo<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e, that from time to time a<U+017F>cend out of the Fo<U+017F><U+017F>ile Region (as I may al<U+017F>o call that of Mines) into the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>phere. But the things I could alledge to Countenance this Conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, mu<U+017F>t not be in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted on in this place. Therefore I proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider.</p>
                     <p>3. That Bodies <U+017F>o heavy, and con<U+017F>equently <U+017F>o abundant in parts of <U+017F>olid matter crouded together, as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and other Fo<U+017F><U+017F>iles are wont to be, may well be <U+017F>uppos'd capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without de<U+017F>tructively wa<U+017F>ting them<U+017F>elves to emit <U+017F>tore of <U+017F>uch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Particles as <hi>Effluvia,</hi> for an exceeding long time. This will be ea<U+017F>ily granted by him that <U+017F>hall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider the particulars laid together in a <U+017F>mall Tract, that I purpo<U+017F>ely writ, about the admirable Subtilty
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104480:92"/>
of <hi>Effluvia.</hi> And 'twill be the more ea<U+017F>ily believ'd, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider'd how long <U+017F>ome Load-<U+017F>tones, <U+017F>ever'd from their Mine, have been kept in the Air without any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or perhaps <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible diminution of their Virtue. And this brings into my mind what an eminent Phy<U+017F>ician, who was skill'd in Perfumes, affirm'd to me about the durablene<U+017F>s of an Effluviating power, that was not natural to a Metal, but adventitious, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by Art: for he a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me that he had a Silver Watch-ca<U+017F>e, that had been <U+017F>o well perfum'd, that though he u<U+017F>ually wore the Watch in his Pocket, it continued to be well <U+017F>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <U+017F>ixteen years. The <U+017F>ame Per<U+017F>on had a way of perfuming factitious Marble quite thorough, who<U+017F>e grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scent he affirm'd would la<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; and of this perfum'd Marble he pre<U+017F>ented me a Ball, which having been <U+017F>ome months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gotten from me by a great Lady, I was di<U+017F>abled from ob<U+017F>erving the durablene<U+017F>s of the fragrancy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:104480:92"/>I might perhaps be thought wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to my Cau<U+017F>e, if, before I di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s the Propo<U+017F>ition I have been all this while di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing of, I <U+017F>hould not ob<U+017F>erve, that Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia</hi> may contribute to <hi>Endemical Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,</hi> not only as they vitiate the Air, that Men breathe in, or are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately touch'd by; but as they may impregnate or deprave the Aliments that men feed upon. For fir<U+017F>t, they do mingle them<U+017F>elves with the <hi>water,</hi> which either men drink it <U+017F>elf alone, (as is the Cu<U+017F>tome with many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of <U+017F>ome men in mo<U+017F>t Nations; or make of it their Bear, Ale, or other factitious drinks, prepar'd of <hi>Water</hi> and Barley, Oats, Rice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That divers Springs, and other Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are imbued with Mineral Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles, may be judg'd by <hi><U+017F>ome</hi> of the Medicinal Springs: for, though divers <hi>Acidulae</hi> and <hi>Thermae</hi> afford good <U+017F>tore of palpable Sulphur or Salt, yet all do not; and having purpo<U+017F>ely examin'd a famous one, I could with a pair of nice Scales
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104480:93"/>
<U+017F>carce di<U+017F>cover any <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all between the <hi>Medicinal Water,</hi> and the <hi>common Water</hi> that was to be met with thereabouts. And that which impregnated this, and which I found by tryal on my <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>ome other Bodies, enabl'd it to work very manife<U+017F>tly like a Mineral Water, was a <U+017F>ort of Corpu<U+017F>cles <U+017F>o minute and <U+017F>ubtile, that if the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles were not kept well <U+017F>topt, they would in a <U+017F>hort time vani<U+017F>h, and leave the Liquor di<U+017F>pirited. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me, that there are ways of making common water violently and hurtfully operative upon Humane Bodies, though its <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible qualities would not make one <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect any change in it: but the ill u<U+017F>e that bad men may make of <U+017F>uch Liquors, makes me forbear to expre<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf more clearly: nor is it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that I <U+017F>hould add any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing to confirm the propos'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, <U+017F>ave what may be inferr'd from the<U+017F>e two Particulars; the fir<U+017F>t whereof is the <U+017F>carce at all <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible

change that may be made in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <U+017F>ome other Liquors, that are made <U+017F>trongly Emetick by <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Metallorum,</hi> and by Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vitrify'd without addition: and the <U+017F>econd may be taken from tho<U+017F>e <hi>Averni,</hi> whence there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually a<U+017F>cend <U+017F>uch pernicious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, as in <U+017F>ome places intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or kill even the Birds that fly over tho<U+017F>e poy<U+017F>onous vents; for if <U+017F>uch Exhalations, or even far le<U+017F>s deadly ones, <U+017F>hould (as they may be rea<U+017F>onably <U+017F>uppos'd, <U+017F>ometimes to do) meet with either running or <U+017F>tagnant Waters in their a<U+017F>cent, there is little doubt to be made, but they will impregnate them, and make them noxious. And on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion we may pertinently recall to mind, what I have formerly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd about a place upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Lanca<U+017F>hire,</hi> where the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Mud of a Ditch is <U+017F>o copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly impregnated with Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Exhalations, (whether they be bituminous, <U+017F>ulphureous, or of <U+017F>ome
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104480:94"/>
unknown kind) that they may ea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be fir'd at the <U+017F>urface of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Earth, and made to burn like a Candle, as an ingenious man did at my Reque<U+017F>t <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully try.</p>
                     <p>But there is another account, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the lower parts of the Earth may have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <U+017F>troke in producing of Endemical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; namely, as they mingle with the Water, and other Liquors that are nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to the nutrition and growth of Plants; and, by depraving tho<U+017F>e juices, make the vegetables that are nouri<U+017F>h'd by them unhealthy for the men that eat them, or make drinks of them: and the<U+017F>e noxious Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be <U+017F>uppos'd in many places to impregnate the juices of the Earth, much more copiou<U+017F>ly than they do the running or <U+017F>tagnant Waters lately <U+017F>poken of: becau<U+017F>e the difficulty of pervading the Earth in their a<U+017F>cent, may <U+017F>o long check them, as to make them very numerous in a <U+017F>mall <U+017F>pace, and perhaps make them convene into Bodies, <U+017F>o far of a Saline Nature as to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104480:94"/>
be di<U+017F><U+017F>oluble either in common Water, or <U+017F>ome other Subterraneal Liquor; by who<U+017F>e help, as by vehicles, they may in<U+017F>inuate them<U+017F>elves into the roots of Plants, and be thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to other parts. Divers things might be alledg'd to keep this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture from being improbable, if I had lei<U+017F>ure to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t on them: but I I <U+017F>hall now only mention two things that on this occa<U+017F>ion come into my mind: the fir<U+017F>t whereof is, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of a famous Chymi<U+017F>t, who liv'd in a Countrey abounding with Mines of Vitriol, whether he did not ob<U+017F>erve, that the Oaks growing over them were more <U+017F>olid, or heavy, than tho<U+017F>e Trees are el<U+017F>ewhere wont to be; he an<U+017F>wer'd me, that he did, and that the difference was remarkable: The other is, that the parts of <U+017F>ome Minerals, (probably by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>mallne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>olidity of the Corpu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of) are capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inuating them<U+017F>elves very plentifully into the pores of growing Vegetables, without being really <U+017F>ubdu'd by what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104480:95"/>
Philo<U+017F>ophers are pleas'd to call the <hi>Concocting Faculty</hi> of the Plant; and, in<U+017F>tead of being a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated by the Vegetable, they retain their own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Nature, and upon the rece<U+017F>s or evaporation of the juice that <U+017F>erv'd them for a vehicle, may <U+017F>ometimes di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their being Mineral, even to an una<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted Eye. For I remember I have <U+017F>een a piece of a Vine, that grew not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> which being broken, I perceiv'd a multitude of the internal Pores of the root, and, if I mi<U+017F>take not, part of the Trunk al<U+017F>o, to be <U+017F>tuff't with Corpu<U+017F>cles of a Marcha<U+017F>itical Nature; as manife<U+017F>tly appear'd by their Colour, and their <U+017F>hining lu<U+017F>tre, and al<U+017F>o by their weight.</p>
                     <p>There goes a Tradition among learned Men, that the leaves of Vines that grow in <U+017F>ome places of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who<U+017F>e Mines afford Gold, are as it were gilt on the lower <U+017F>ide, by a<U+017F>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Exhalations of a Golden Nature: whether this be true or no, I <U+017F>hall not take upon me to determine: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that having made enquiry

And now and then I have ob<U+017F>erv'd in the <U+017F>ame Months and Days, at no great di<U+017F>tance from one another, that the Weather has been <U+017F>ultry hot, and has al<U+017F>o produc'd a great Snow.

                     <p>On which occa<U+017F>ion, I remember, that a great many Trees in <U+017F>ome Land that belongs to me, having been <U+017F>uddenly much endamag'd by a wind, that was not able to doe it by it's bare <U+017F>trength; I had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity to view <U+017F>omewhat heedfully a Tree that <U+017F>tood in the Garden, and perceiv'd that all the con<U+017F>iderable mi<U+017F>chief was done to that <U+017F>ide of the Tree, which re<U+017F>pected the corner whence the hurtfull Wind blew, the Leaves of the other <U+017F>ide continuing fre<U+017F>h and verdant, as being by the other part of the <U+017F>ame Tree fenc'd from the Wind: and it was farther ob<U+017F>erv'd, that even the expos'd <U+017F>ide of the Tree was not every-where endamag'd; for there were divers parts, where the Leaves continued <U+017F>ound and green, though neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Leaves were <U+017F>ome more, <U+017F>ome

                     <p>But the Vulgar have entertain'd <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trange Conceits and Stories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the<U+017F>e Bla<U+017F>tings, on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <U+017F>ome of them <U+017F>ay that Men are <hi>Planet-<U+017F>truck</hi> that the fabulous things mingled with tho<U+017F>e that are po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, have made intelligent Per<U+017F>ons reject them all.</p>
                     <p>One thing more I <U+017F>hall take notice of in favour of our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is,</hi> which is, that it well agrees with what has been ob<U+017F>erved, not without <U+017F>ome wonder, of the very <U+017F>hort duration of <U+017F>ome Epidemical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Times and Places. For this may proceed from hence, either that all the Morbifick Expirations a<U+017F>cended into the Air almo<U+017F>t at once, or at lea<U+017F>t within a <U+017F>hort time, and <U+017F>o were ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>pent, that is by diffu<U+017F>ion or

di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ion <U+017F>o weakned, as to be di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from doing much mi<U+017F>chief: or el<U+017F>e the Subterraneal Commotion that produc'd them may pa<U+017F>s on from one place to another, and <U+017F>o cea<U+017F>e to afford the Air incumbent on the fir<U+017F>t place, the <U+017F>upplies nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to keep it impregnated with noxious Exhalations. And it agrees well with this Conjecture, that <U+017F>ometimes we may ob<U+017F>erve certain Epidemical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es to have as it were a progre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive Motion, and leaving one Town free pa<U+017F>s on to another. Of which <U+017F>ome Ob<U+017F>ervations that I have made, encline me to think, that if Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians would heedfully mind it, they might take notice of <U+017F>everal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances.</p>
                     <p>One thing more may be added, as con<U+017F>onant to our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is;</hi> namely, that <U+017F>ometimes an Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e cea<U+017F>es in this or that place, almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>udden as it invaded, or at lea<U+017F>t in a much <U+017F>horter time than Phy<U+017F>icians expected. For according to our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> it may well happen,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104480:108"/>
that after one <U+017F>ort of Exhalations, who<U+017F>e peculiar Qualities make them Morbifick, have deprav'd the Air incumbent on a particular place; there may by a new or farther Commotion of Subterraneal Bodies, be <U+017F>ent up into the Air <U+017F>tore of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations of another kind, which meeting with tho<U+017F>e that formerly impregnated it, may either precipitate them, and <U+017F>o free the Air from them; or by other operations on them, and <U+017F>ometimes even by Coalitions with them, <U+017F>o alter their nature as to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them from doing any farther mi<U+017F>chief.</p>

                     <p>And then, he adds, <hi>This Dew gives life to every thing; and when it falls upon the Wheat, it cau<U+017F>eth it to continue many years without corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Worms, and is far more nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than that Corn on which it never falls.

                     <p>The <hi>fir<U+017F>t</hi> thing that induces me to this Conjecture, is, that not any of the <U+017F>everal Cau<U+017F>es to which the Plague is wont to be imputed <U+017F>eems to me to be <U+017F>ufficient.

a method, by means of which he a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ur'd me, he had not lo<U+017F>t one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of very many he treated; if he could but, as he u<U+017F>ually did, by good <hi>Alexipharmical,</hi> and Cordial Remedies, enable and excite Nature to expell the peccant Matter into a Tumour; for then he pre<U+017F>ently clapp'd on an appropriated draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pla<U+017F>ter, which would never <U+017F>uffer the Tumour to <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ide; but break it, or make it fit for opening, and thereby give Nature a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient vent, at which to di<U+017F>charge the matter that oppre<U+017F>s'd her.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104480:129"/>
he readily granted, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all told me, that his method would not <U+017F>eem to me worth mentioning, if I were one that valu'd Medicines by their Pompou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, not their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility. For, be<U+017F>ides ardent Prayers to God, and a very regular Diet, his con<U+017F>tant Antidote was onely, to take every Morning fa<U+017F>ting a little Sea-<U+017F>alt di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd in a few <U+017F>poonfulls of fair Water; which he made choice of, both becau<U+017F>e it kept his Body <U+017F>oluble without purging or weakning it, and for other Rea<U+017F>ons which I mu<U+017F>t not now <U+017F>tay to <U+017F>et down. I know this Medicine may appear a de<U+017F>picable one; but yet in my Opinion it ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pis'd, after <U+017F>uch Experience as I have related has recommended it. For I think it de<U+017F>irable, that notice be taken of all Remedies, that have been found by good Trials, not bare Conjectures or uncertain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, available again<U+017F>t the Plague. For, <U+017F>ince Pe<U+017F>tilences, as we have lately noted, are exceeding various
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104480:129"/>
in their kinds, 'tis very po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and not unlikely, that their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated Remedies may be <U+017F>o too. And therefore I would not ea<U+017F>ily lay a<U+017F>ide every Medicine, that this or that Learned Phy<U+017F>ician may <U+017F>peak <U+017F>lightly of, or even may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he has found it un<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full again<U+017F>t the Plague; <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>ame Medicine may be available in a Pe<U+017F>tilence of another kind, in which perhaps the Remedies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Phy<U+017F>ician we <U+017F>peak of, will be found inefficacious.</p>
                     <p>This Con<U+017F>ideration forbids me to pa<U+017F>s by what happen'd to me in the great <hi>London</hi> Plague above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; namely, that a very Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phy<U+017F>ician having once recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to me an Herb little noted in <hi>England,</hi> as a mo<U+017F>t effectual and experienced Antidote again<U+017F>t the Plague, I caus'd it to be cultivated in a Garden (as I <U+017F>till do every year;) and when the Pe<U+017F>tilence ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged mo<U+017F>t, having <U+017F>ome of it by me, made up with a little Sugar in the

form of a fine green Con<U+017F>erve, I <U+017F>ent it to two infected Per<U+017F>ons, who, by the Divine Benediction on it, both of them recover'd. But having made but tho<U+017F>e two Trials, I dare not ground much upon them onely; though I u<U+017F>ually keep the Plant growing in a Garden, partly becau<U+017F>e both the Ta<U+017F>te and Colour; one or other of which in mo<U+017F>t An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes is offen<U+017F>ive, are in this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant; and partly becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome little Experience has invited me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Commendations that I have found given of it, again<U+017F>t the Bitings of venomous Creatures: whereof I remember a notable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance is recorded by <hi>Petrus Spehrerius</hi> of a<note place="margin">In Ob<U+017F>ervat. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bil. apud <hi>Schen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kium,</hi> l. 7.

                     <p>(3.) It likewi<U+017F>e agrees with our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is;</hi> that <U+017F>ometimes the Plague cea<U+017F>es, or at lea<U+017F>t very nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abates of its Infectiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s and Malignity, in far le<U+017F>s time than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wonted cour<U+017F>e of that ravenous Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, Phy<U+017F>icians did, or rationally could expect. For <U+017F>ometimes it may happen, that, though the Temperature or Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratene<U+017F>s of the Air continues the <U+017F>ame, the matter that afforded the Pe<U+017F>tiferous Exhalations may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<U+017F>pent under ground, or <U+017F>o al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by combination with other <U+017F>ubterraneal Bodies, or by <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e many Accidents that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, altogether unknown to us, in tho<U+017F>e deep and dark Rece<U+017F><U+017F>es. And if once the Fountain of the<U+017F>e noxious <hi>Effluvia</hi> be <U+017F>topt, <U+017F>o that tho<U+017F>e that are in the Air cea<U+017F>e to be recruited, the Wind and other cau<U+017F>es may in a <U+017F>hort time di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate them, or at lea<U+017F>t dilute them with innocent Air, <U+017F>o far, as to keep the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd from being any thing near <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>chievous as before. And here I con<U+017F>ider, that it may <U+017F>everal times happen, that, though the Minerals that emit the hurtfull Expirations, remain where they were under ground, and be not con<U+017F>iderably wa<U+017F>ted, yet their fatal Effects may not be la<U+017F>ting, becau<U+017F>e the <hi>Effluvia</hi> were generated by the conflict of two or more of them, which vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently agitated one another, and <U+017F>ent up fumes, which ceas'd to a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, at lea<U+017F>t in great plenty, when
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104480:131"/>
the Conflict and Agitation ceas'd. As, I have try'd that by putting good Spirit of Salt upon Filings of Steel or Iron in a conveniently <U+017F>hap'd Gla<U+017F>s, there will be made a great conflict between them, and without the help of external Heat, there will be <U+017F>ent up into the Air <U+017F>tore of vi<U+017F>ible Fumes of a very Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Odour, and ea<U+017F>ily inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, which copious elevation of Fumes will le<U+017F><U+017F>en or cea<U+017F>e, as does the tumultuous agitation that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them. And <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e, if you pour <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> upon a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient proportion of Salt of Tartar, there will be at fir<U+017F>t a great ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produc'd, and, whil<U+017F>t that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, <U+017F>tore of red and noi<U+017F>ome Fumes will be elevated, but will not long outla<U+017F>t the commotion of the mixture, who<U+017F>e active parts will in no long time combine into a kind of nitrous Salt, wherein the noxious parts of the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> are as it were pinion'd, and hinder'd from evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating or a<U+017F>cending, though really

                     <p>It may al<U+017F>o happen, that <U+017F>oon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that commotion of <U+017F>ubterraneal Matter, which <U+017F>ent forth pe<U+017F>tiferous Exhalations, a more inten<U+017F>e degree of <U+017F>ubterraneal Heat, or perhaps the <U+017F>ame latent Fire, extending it <U+017F>elf farther and farther, may force up Fumes of another <U+017F>ort, that being of a contrary nature, may be, if I may <U+017F>o <U+017F>peak, antidotal again<U+017F>t the former; and by precipitating them, or combining with them, may di<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them from acting <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>chievou<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as otherwi<U+017F>e they would. To countenance which I <U+017F>hall tell you, that I have <U+017F>ometimes purpo<U+017F>ely made Di<U+017F>tillations, in which one part of the Matter being, after the operation ended, put to the other, there will en<U+017F>ue a <U+017F>udden and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t conflict between them, and <U+017F>ometimes an inten<U+017F>e degree of Heat.

                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:104480:132"/>
may be gather'd from what I lately noted about a Countrey, which abounding with veins of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar, was, probably by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations, pre<U+017F>erved from the Pe<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps appear <U+017F>omewhat the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, if we reflect on what I lately mention'd of the <U+017F>udden check, that is almo<U+017F>t every Summer given to the Plague, which at that time is wont to reign at <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi> For <U+017F>ince 'tis generally ob<U+017F>erv'd and complain'd of, that <hi>Morbifick</hi> Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es doe their work much more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually than <hi>Sanative</hi> ones. It <U+017F>eems very probable that Exhalations a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from under-ground into the Atmo<U+017F>phere, may be capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing pe<U+017F>tilential Fevers, and the Plague it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince tho<U+017F>e Corpu<U+017F>cles that impregnate the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Air upon the <U+017F>welling of the Nile, are able to put a <U+017F>peedy <U+017F>top, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the contagiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, but to the malignity of the Plague, even when 'tis a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by the Summer

Heat, which at <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> is wont to be exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive.</p>
                     <p>But having in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted perhaps too long on this <hi>Egyptian</hi> Pe<U+017F>tilence, I <U+017F>hall onely add, by way of Illu<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Conjecture that invited me to mention it, that the acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion even of Expirations that are not them<U+017F>elves whol<U+017F>ome, may <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>erve to correct the Air, and put a <U+017F>udden check to an Epidemical Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e. For Corpu<U+017F>cles of differing kinds may by their Coalitions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire new Qualities, and each <U+017F>ort of them lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e they had before: as, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e there wander'd in the Air a great many <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which by their determinate <U+017F>hape and bulk were apt to corrode or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate the Lungs, or the Membranes of the Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as tho<U+017F>e of Nitre are to corrode Silver; it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that another <U+017F>ort of Reeks, though in their own nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whol<U+017F>ome, may, by a<U+017F><U+017F>ociating them<U+017F>elves with the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ort, and compo<U+017F>ing with them Curpu<U+017F>cles of

                     <p>At the entrance of my Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e I ob<U+017F>erv'd that the Term <hi>new Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e</hi> was much abu<U+017F>ed by the Vulgar, who are wont to give that Title to almo<U+017F>t every Fever, that, in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn e<U+017F>pecially, varies a little in its Symptoms, or other Circum<U+017F>tances, from the Fevers of the foregoing

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104480:135"/>
to acquie<U+017F>ce in the Books of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians onely; but 'tis fit to con<U+017F>ult the Writings of Geographers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ancient</hi> (among whom I particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly recommended <hi>Strabo</hi>) or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,</hi> together with the Relations of Hi<U+017F>torians, Navigators and other Travellers.

particularly with <U+017F>ome that were <U+017F>hap'd almo<U+017F>t like the <U+017F>harper End of the neck of a Retort.

               <p>I <U+017F>hall here ob<U+017F>erve, that it need not <U+017F>eem incredible, that faint <U+017F>trokes and attritions may leave more la<U+017F>ting and operative Motions among the In<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Parts, even of compact and <U+017F>olid Bodies, than one would readily imagine. For I have <U+017F>everal times found, <U+017F>ometimes by Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions de<U+017F>ignedly made, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by unde<U+017F>igned Accidents, that, having caus'd <U+017F>omewhat thin Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of Gla<U+017F>s, e<U+017F>pecially Urinals, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104480:150"/>
made clean with Sand mixt with Water, to loo<U+017F>en or grate off the foulne<U+017F>s that adher'd to the <U+017F>ides of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el; though the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been thus made clean, did not appear to have receiv'd the lea<U+017F>t injury, and would continue very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire perhaps for <U+017F>everal hours, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time they would of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves break with noi<U+017F>e, and thereby become un<U+017F>erviceable for the future. But though this happen'd to many Urinals, yet, becau<U+017F>e to more others it did not, it <U+017F>eem'd probable that the di<U+017F><U+017F>ilition depended chiefly upon the peculiar texture of the Gla<U+017F>s in this or that Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, whether acquir'd by a mixture of the Ingredients, that was not uniform enough or made in a due proportion; or el<U+017F>e by the too ha<U+017F>ty refrigeration of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if it chanc'd, as is not very unu<U+017F>ual, to be cool'd more ha<U+017F>tily in one part than another.</p>

an<U+017F>wer'd me that <U+017F>ometimes, when he poli<U+017F>h'd certain Stones, e<U+017F>pecially Rubies, that were pretty large and perhaps not thick, he could plainly perceive that the Stone gap'd at and near the Edge, as if it were begun to be crack'd; which <U+017F>ign admoni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to make ha<U+017F>te to <U+017F>lacken the Motion of the Mill, le<U+017F>t the Stone <U+017F>hould ab<U+017F>olutely bur<U+017F>t; which if it did not he could not perceive any Flaw in it when it was throughly cold, but, which was <U+017F>trange, it appear'd as entire as ever.

This Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el I <U+017F>et upon the Edge of a Window, in a high and <U+017F>ecure place, that it might not be mov'd. There it continu'd many Months, or, if I mi<U+017F>remember not, above a Year. And the Liquor was of <U+017F>uch a nature, that if any Body had, though but for a few Moments,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104480:152"/>
taken out the Stople, I could ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cover it.

Tho<U+017F>e that look'd otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>haking more <U+017F>lowly, upon which matter of fact he argues thus: had this trembling been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion'd by the <U+017F>haking of the Ground of <hi>Tauromenium,</hi> all the Hou<U+017F>es had been equally <U+017F>hak'd, <U+017F>ince this inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of motion could not be a<U+017F>crib'd to their different <U+017F>ituation. Hence then

we mu<U+017F>t needs conclude that this agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was produc'd by the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Air upon the Walls of the Hou<U+017F>es, which demon<U+017F>trates to us the great efficacy of a <U+017F>ound, though at thirty miles di<U+017F>tance.</p>
