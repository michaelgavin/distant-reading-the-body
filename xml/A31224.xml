         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The last Piece, which came abroad under my ob<U+017F>cure name, was <hi>The Travels of the Emba<U+017F><U+017F>y from the Duke of Hol<U+017F>tein, into Mu<U+017F>covy, and Per<U+017F>ia.</hi> The excellent Per<U+017F>on who was the original Author of it, <hi>Olearius,</hi> oblig'd, with us, most of the Neighbouring Nations, who al<U+017F>o rendred his work into their <U+017F>everal Languages. I am told it was not unkindly receiv'd here; onely the occa<U+017F>ion I have to <U+017F>peak of it now, is, that the coming forth of the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Tran<U+017F>lation, with greater lu<U+017F>tre, than haply it had done otherwi<U+017F>e, is, among tho<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome others, due to your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
            <p>But I am not to date your notice of me from that; I must de<U+017F>cend much lower, to a Time wherein you thought it dangerous to know, or be known to, many. Be not <U+017F>tartled; when dangers are over, there remains onely a plea<U+017F>ing remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them. It was, long before the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> at <hi>Derby-Hou<U+017F>e,</hi> was advanc'd into a <hi>Councel of State,</hi> an Age <U+017F>ince, con<U+017F>idering the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent reign of Tyranny and Barbari<U+017F>m, and the perpetual alarms and frights, whereto worry'd Loyalty was every where expos'd. The<U+017F>e you have happily weather'd out, and <U+017F>een the contrivers thereof at last overtaken by the <U+017F>low pace of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance, an adverti<U+017F>ement to All <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tians</hi>

            <p>As to the Piece I now pre<U+017F>ent you with, I have onely this to <U+017F>ay. It is a <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Relation, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>D.

One of the most refin'd Wits of <hi>France</hi> thought it worth his pains, to render it into the Language of his Country, with all the graces and advantages it might derive from either. I have done it out of the latter, with a freedome of alteration and addition, as my fancy led me, to make it the most divertive I could in ours, which is the onely recommendation of all things of this nature. My Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>es his Readers a continuation of the Story, if what is already publi<U+017F>h'd be kindly entertain'd: I do mine, the like, upon the <U+017F>ame precaution; but with this particular inducement, That it will give me further occa<U+017F>ion to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure the world how much I am,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is a Treati<U+017F>e in the Spani<U+017F>h Tongue, entituled IL PICARO, which being rendred into Engli<U+017F>h, under the Title of THE ROGUE, or, <hi>The Life of Guzman de Alfarache,</hi> the humour took <U+017F>o well in this Nation, that He and his Rogueries were <U+017F>everal times committed to the Pre<U+017F>s. The De<U+017F>ign of that Work was to repre<U+017F>ent a Per<U+017F>on, on whom either Nature, or a <U+017F>trange a<U+017F>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of <hi>Mercury</hi> had be<U+017F>towed <U+017F>o liberal a Talent of cheating, thieving, and circumvention, that he not onely trapan'd all he dealt with, but al<U+017F>o became a Precedent and Pattern to all tho<U+017F>e, who, out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity, or inclination, have been forc'd to live by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58823:6"/>
their <U+017F>hifts, or, as <U+017F>ome would have it, by their wits. The pre<U+017F>ent Tract hath <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>emblance to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Piece before mentioned, ina<U+017F>much as it brings in a Woman, engag'd in as great de<U+017F>igns as tho<U+017F>e of her Predece<U+017F><U+017F>or <hi>Guzman,</hi> but with this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, that the weakne<U+017F>s of her Sex obliges her to make u<U+017F>e of the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances of Men for the better pro<U+017F>ecution thereof. Both Treati<U+017F>es were originally written in the <hi>Spani<U+017F>h,</hi> a Language we are oblig'd to for mo<U+017F>t pieces of this nature: and as, in the former, the Relation is plea<U+017F>antly interrupted by certain merry tales and <U+017F>tories; <U+017F>o in ours, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture of Novels, to heighten the Reader's <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and diverti<U+017F>ement.</p>
            <p>The draught I am to give of this Miracle of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male <U+017F>ubtilty may be of very great advantage to three <U+017F>orts of per<U+017F>ons. Tho<U+017F>e who feel in them<U+017F>elves a certain di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to be wicked, may be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h'd, and reform, before they have occa<U+017F>ion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; they, who, defying all adverti<U+017F>ement, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd to be mi<U+017F>chievous, may, out of an apprehen<U+017F>ion of the en<U+017F>uing puni<U+017F>hment, be deterr'd into cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the innocent and vertuous may learn a le<U+017F><U+017F>on of prudence and circum<U+017F>pection, to avoid tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>nares that are laid for them. The things I write are not <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ititious, or fram'd in my own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but <U+017F>uch as really happened in one of the mo<U+017F>t eminent Cities of <hi>Spain;</hi> which yet if any man have not faith enough to believe, I have no other advice to give him, but that he would travel to tho<U+017F>e places, where our Scene lies, to di<U+017F>prove me.</p>
            <p>As to her Per<U+017F>on, She was young, <U+017F>prightly, and very beautiful; three dangerous advantages, when

they are attended by tho<U+017F>e endowments for which <U+017F>he was no le<U+017F>s famous, to wit, Craft, Impudence, Hypocri<U+017F>ie, and an in<U+017F>atiable longing for the goods of other people; and all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trengthned by a bent of nature, as being the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of Parents, who, in<U+017F>tead of giving a timely check to the<U+017F>e vicious inclinations, rather incourag'd her in them by their example, as being addicted to the <U+017F>ame them<U+017F>elves.</p>
            <p>Seignor <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> Father to this excellent per<U+017F>on who<U+017F>e atchievments we intend to de<U+017F>cribe, had been condemn'd to the Galleys, for having a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd to him<U+017F>elf the Order of the Knighthood of <hi>Chri<U+017F>t,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had made the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary trials, upon which his Maje<U+017F>ty be<U+017F>tows that honour, by the judgment of his Soveraign Council of <hi>Portugal.</hi> His de<U+017F>ign in doing it, was that he might more conveniently follow his profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>tealing about the Court, where he was re<U+017F>pected as a Knight, and the better, under that cloak, to play tho<U+017F>e pranks of villany, wherein he was <U+017F>uch a Profe<U+017F><U+017F>or, that the mo<U+017F>t expert might have heard his Lectures. A certain Woman, whom he us'd to trade withall, incens'd again<U+017F>t him upon the account of <U+017F>ome jealou<U+017F>ie, that he re<U+017F>erv'd not all his kindne<U+017F>s for her, put in a charge again<U+017F>t him, the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue whereof was, That he got the <U+017F>aid preferment in the Galleys; where he pa<U+017F>s'd over the term of his condemnation, and <U+017F>omewhat more. He was di<U+017F>pos'd into that Squadron, which is called the Squadron of <hi>Spain,</hi> and tran<U+017F>lated from <hi>Toledo</hi> to S. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Port, with the re<U+017F>t who were in the <U+017F>ame Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Slavery. He had made an attempt to recover his liberty, but the plot being di<U+017F>cover'd, he was put to greater hard<U+017F>hip than he had otherwi<U+017F>e been.</p>

As <U+017F>oon as the Lady <hi>E<U+017F>tephania</hi> (<U+017F>o was called the jealous Woman, who had <U+017F>hewn him that trick) under<U+017F>tood that he was gone to exerci<U+017F>e that painful employment, though <U+017F>he were not of an over-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate nature, very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly repented her, that <U+017F>he had been the cau<U+017F>e of his mi<U+017F>ery, and con<U+017F>ider'd that <U+017F>he could not make a better <U+017F>atisfaction for that injury, than by proffering her <U+017F>elf to him in marriage as <U+017F>oon as the time of his penance were expir'd. What inclin'd her the more to this kind of reparation, was, that <U+017F>he had already had a Daughter by him, which Daughter is the <U+017F>ubject of the pre<U+017F>ent Treati<U+017F>e. With this re<U+017F>olution, <U+017F>he left the Court, and went to <hi>Sevil,</hi> hoping, in that great and famous City, <U+017F>he might the <U+017F>ooner hear <U+017F>ome news of him, whom <U+017F>he had reduc'd to <U+017F>o great mi<U+017F>ery, and whom <U+017F>he would gladly once more <U+017F>ee at liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>E<U+017F>tephania</hi> had a hou<U+017F>e very well furni<U+017F>h'd, being a <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi>'s Widow, who had left her very well to pa<U+017F>s. That, and the care <U+017F>he took to go <U+017F>omewhat high in cloaths, gain'd her <U+017F>uch a repute at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that <U+017F>he was look'd on as a per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome quality: but <U+017F>he <U+017F>oon lo<U+017F>t that, when the hi<U+017F>tory of her life came to be known, e<U+017F>pecially this particular of it, that, out of an exce<U+017F>s of jealou<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>he had preferr'd to the Galleys a young Gallant, whom <U+017F>he had often entertain'd in a feather-bed. That imprudent <U+017F>ally made her abhominable in the <U+017F>ight of her mo<U+017F>t inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintances of her own <U+017F>ex, who<U+017F>e indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <U+017F>he allow'd to be the more ju<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t her, when <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ider'd, that <U+017F>he had ca<U+017F>t away her <U+017F>elf on an impo<U+017F>tor and a ra<U+017F>cal fit onely for the Galleys.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons and reproaches oblig'd her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Sevil,</hi> taking all <U+017F>he could conveniently carry along with her, and <U+017F>elling the re<U+017F>t, which brought her in a con<U+017F>iderable <U+017F>umme of mony. Having thus order'd her affairs, <U+017F>he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sevil</hi> by Coach, with two Maids to wait on on her, intending to continue there, till the time of <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s <U+017F>erving in the Galleys were expir'd; which being near out, (for <U+017F>he kept an exact account of it) <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood that the <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Galleys were arrived at S. <hi>Mary's Port.</hi> She immediately went thither, not <U+017F>o highly clad as <U+017F>he was wont to go at <hi>Sevil,</hi> but in a more mode<U+017F>t habit, that it might not be afterwards ca<U+017F>t into her di<U+017F>h, that <U+017F>he had been the wife of a Galley-<U+017F>lave, and withal one <U+017F>he had courted out of his chains into her embraces.</p>
            <p>She immediately under<U+017F>tood that her Gallant was in the Captain's own Galley, very jocund, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the office of a Fore-man, a preeminence among the Slaves which exempts them from rowing, and he had acquir'd it of the General by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>antne<U+017F>s of his conver<U+017F>ation; nay, had he not had that charge, he was by this time grown <U+017F>o well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Galleys, that he minded not much whether ever he got out of them. But the arrival of <hi>E<U+017F>tephania</hi> remedi'd all. Her fir<U+017F>t bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was to treat about his liberty, <U+017F>peaking to tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons on whom the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s depended, and pre<U+017F>enting them with certain <U+017F>umms of mony, before <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> had any knowledge of her de<U+017F>ign, whom he could not have <U+017F>een, as having not yet <U+017F>tirr'd out of the Galley. So that he was extremely a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd, when he came to under<U+017F>tand, that <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons did not onely u<U+017F>e bare <U+017F>olicitations in order to his liberty, but were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58823:8"/>
al<U+017F>o liberal of their mony to procure it, yet could it never come into his thoughts, that his old Love <hi>E<U+017F>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phania</hi> <U+017F>hould have chang'd the cruel humour, he had left her in, into one <U+017F>o mild and obliging.</p>
            <p>All things being concluded and agreed upon for <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s liberty, his chains were knock'd off, and he was told, that he might go whether he would. In the mean time he could not imagine who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd him that happine<U+017F>s, which was no <U+017F>mall one, ina<U+017F>much as though the poor Slaves have <U+017F>erv'd out the time of their condemnation, yet are there <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>es found that hinder their being <U+017F>et at liberty, nay <U+017F>ome are <U+017F>o unhappy, that having been condemn'd for four years, are forc'd to <U+017F>tay there five, or <U+017F>ix.</p>
            <p>Seignor <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> was extremely a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd, when he found him<U+017F>elf in the pre<U+017F>ence of his <hi>E<U+017F>tephania,</hi> and under<U+017F>tood, that it was onely by her means he had recover'd his liberty; <U+017F>he receiv'd him into her arms, and he, to expre<U+017F>s his gratitude, return'd <U+017F>o obliging a reception with the like care<U+017F><U+017F>es; <U+017F>o that the kindne<U+017F>s he then receiv'd of her, made him forget the re<U+017F>entment he might have of the mi<U+017F>eries <U+017F>he had occa<U+017F>ion'd him. He was troubled to find her in a much different habit from that he had left her in at <hi>Madrid,</hi> for he knew not that it was out of de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o di<U+017F>guis'd her <U+017F>elf, nor could <U+017F>he at that time give him an account of it, by rea<U+017F>on of the Captain and others being pre<U+017F>ent, who had conducted him, and whom <U+017F>he was oblig'd to entertain at dinner. Having treated them as well as <U+017F>he could, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, <U+017F>ave onely <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who continu'd <U+017F>till in the Inne with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. Finding them<U+017F>elves alone, they reiterated their care<U+017F><U+017F>es, and outvy'd one the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58823:8"/>
other in a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of the <U+017F>atisfaction they conceiv'd at that interview. <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> render'd her his thanks with all the grateful acknowledgments imaginable, for the pains <U+017F>he had taken, and the goodne<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had had to deliver him out of the cruel torments he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58823:9"/>
they had liv'd, being re<U+017F>olv'd to lead another kind of life than they had done before. For <hi>E<U+017F>tephania</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, that the hard<U+017F>hip which her dear Love had endur'd in the Galleys, had abated <U+017F>omewhat of his former extravagancies, and that the grey hairs he had brought thence would reclaim him from his debauches, endeavour'd to get him <U+017F>ome creditable employment in <hi>Sevil,</hi> as well to keep him out of idlene<U+017F>s, as out of a con<U+017F>ideration that he <U+017F>hould bring in <U+017F>omething towards the hou<U+017F>e. But an untoward di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, <U+017F>uch as was that of <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily brought into di<U+017F>cipline, and if he had as yet behav'd him<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>erv'dne<U+017F>s, it proceeded from the influence, which the perpetual admonitions and rebukes of his wife had over him, and not out of any bent to vertue in his nature; <U+017F>o that, through his own neglect, he could find him<U+017F>elf no other employment, than that of frequenting Gaming-hou<U+017F>es, and Plays, and tho<U+017F>e other places, where tho<U+017F>e, who are naturally inclin'd to <U+017F>loth, think fit to <U+017F>pend the greate<U+017F>t part of their time. This carriage of his extremely troubled his wife, who yet willing to avoid all matrimonial di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, wink'd at his di<U+017F>orders, and endeavour'd to find <U+017F>ome comfort in the conver<U+017F>ation of her Daughter, who<U+017F>e beauty was already become the common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the City.</p>
            <p>Idlene<U+017F>s, the <U+017F>eminary of all <U+017F>orts of vices, by degrees brought <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> into his former cu<U+017F>tom of Gaming (the Sea wherein <U+017F>o many E<U+017F>tates are wrack'd) <U+017F>o that beginning at fir<U+017F>t to play for little (as if it had been rather for Recreation than otherwi<U+017F>e) but afterwards venturing more and more, he in a <U+017F>hort time made a <U+017F>hift to lavander whatever he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58823:9"/>
could lay hands on of his wife's. She was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible enough, that many of her things were wanting, and doubted not but her Husband was the conveyer of them; but all <U+017F>he could do was to weep, and bemoan her <U+017F>elf, charging none with her misfortune, but her <U+017F>elf. <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> perceiving her <U+017F>o much troubled, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ed reformation; but the damn'd lechery of Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevailing more and more upon him, his luck was <U+017F>uch, that in four years he either <U+017F>old or pawn'd whatever was worth it in his hou<U+017F>e. Finding him<U+017F>elf at la<U+017F>t reduc'd to very great nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities, he began to ca<U+017F>t about how he might recover him<U+017F>elf a little: he would have been content his wife (who was as yet hand<U+017F>ome enough) <U+017F>hould have conde<U+017F>cended to lewdne<U+017F><U+017F>es unworthy her recover'd reputation, but he perceiv'd <U+017F>he was grown <U+017F>o hone<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o alter'd from what <U+017F>he had been before, that he had not the confidence to <U+017F>peak to her of any <U+017F>uch thing. For <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o extremely troubled at the di<U+017F>order'd demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her husband, that <U+017F>he grew in a manner care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s of all things; nay <U+017F>he little minded the education of her daughter, who was by this time come into the—<hi>teens,</hi> and, by rea<U+017F>on of the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>tractions in the family, liv'd as <U+017F>he pleas'd her <U+017F>elf, appearing every day at her window, and that not with little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation.</p>
            <p>The grief and regrets which poor <hi>Estephania</hi> conceiv'd at her being reduc'd to nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, heightned by the di<U+017F>content caus'd her by her husband, brought her into a <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, whereof <U+017F>he died about a year after, with a perfect repentance for her pa<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>-carriages, reinforcing at that extremity all her <U+017F>pirits, that <U+017F>he might die as happy a death, as her husband
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58823:10"/>
had occa<U+017F>ion'd her living an unhappy life. She was very poorly buried, <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> having not the means to be<U+017F>tow any more co<U+017F>t upon her than he did. He was in his turn troubled, at her death, and acknowledg'd, but too late, his great over<U+017F>ight in that he had <U+017F>o long continu'd his debauches, and that if he had follow'd her good advice, he might have liv'd hand<U+017F>omely all the re<U+017F>t of his days. All the comfort he had now left, and all the hope on which he grounded his happine<U+017F>s, was the beauty of his Daughter, which he thought <U+017F>uch, as would bring him a Son-in-law, that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities; never con<U+017F>idering that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Age con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in wealth, and that all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and graces have no charm in them, if depriv'd of the attractions of riches.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> as cru<U+017F>h'd as he was with mi<U+017F>eries, continu'd <U+017F>till a con<U+017F>tant frequenter of the Gaming-hou<U+017F>es, not indeed to play him<U+017F>elf, for he had not wherewith, but to receive what he had <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times given, to wit, the <hi>Barats,</hi> a little pre<U+017F>ent the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are wont to be<U+017F>tow on tho<U+017F>e, who look on them while they are playing, when they have had a good hand, and this is commonly the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t revenue of tho<U+017F>e who have ruin'd them<U+017F>elves by Gaming.</p>
            <p>The little aboad which <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> made at his own hou<U+017F>e gave his daughter the greater freedom to follow her own inclinations. She would be perpetually at the window, which induc'd abundance of young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantillos to make their appearances in the <U+017F>treet <U+017F>he liv'd in. The Father, who was not ignorant of what pa<U+017F>s'd, though he might have prevented, yet wink'd at it, out of the de<U+017F>ire he had to <U+017F>ee his daughter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageou<U+017F>ly match'd, that <U+017F>he might afterwards help
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58823:10"/>
him out of his nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities. This indeed was the mo<U+017F>t likely means he had to recover him<U+017F>elf. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon left the little <hi>Rufina</hi> (<U+017F>o was his daughter called) to her own liberty, hoping, that, by her in<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, <U+017F>he would in time have the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of their hearts and pur<U+017F>es who courted her. His de<U+017F>ign prov'd more fortunate than he had imagin'd, ina<U+017F>much as among the many, who langui<U+017F>h'd for her, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be one very rich, who was over head and ears in love with <hi>Rufina.</hi> She a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd the title of <hi>Donna,</hi> a title belongs onely to women of noble extraction, becau<U+017F>e her Mother had taken it before her, which if <U+017F>he had not, her Daughter would not have balk'd it, as being an honour which co<U+017F>ts little or nothing.</p>
            <p>The per<U+017F>on who was <U+017F>o remarkably her Suitor had the Agency of <U+017F>ome affairs of <hi>Peru,</hi> one who<U+017F>e credit much exceeded his e<U+017F>tate, was accounted very rich in the en<U+017F>uring Office belonging to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and about fifty years of age. Though he knew well enough that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s had no fortune, and that he mu<U+017F>t withall be charg'd with the ruin'd per<U+017F>on her Father, yet was he re<U+017F>olv'd to take her, <hi>for better, for wor<U+017F>e;</hi> whence may be deduc'd this ob<U+017F>ervation, That when Love becomes Ma<U+017F>ter of an aged per<U+017F>on, it is a very hard matter to di<U+017F>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s him. <hi>Laurentio de Saravia</hi> (<U+017F>o was this amorous Elder called) was <U+017F>o be<U+017F>otted with the beauties of <hi>Rufina,</hi> that the Treaty of Marriage was concluded in le<U+017F>s than eight daies, and he had the earne<U+017F>t of a happine<U+017F>s, which he thought would have la<U+017F>ted as long as he liv'd. He took his Father-in-law into his hou<U+017F>e, though he knew him to be a great Game<U+017F>ter. The fir<U+017F>t days of the Nuptials were <U+017F>pent as they are wont to be in <U+017F>uch Solemnities; he gave
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58823:11"/>
his wife new cloaths, rings, and jewels, yet <U+017F>uitably to her condition; for being a per<U+017F>on pretty well <U+017F>tricken in years, he was no lover of exce<U+017F>s, an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which pleas'd not <hi>Rufina,</hi> who minded nothing <U+017F>o much as gaudy cloaths, and long'd for whatever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw worn by women of a quality much above hers; and this abated not a little of the love <U+017F>he bore her husband, who was of an <hi>Indian</hi> di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and careful to pre<U+017F>erve his e<U+017F>tate. Knowing, as I told you, that his Father was a great Game<U+017F>ter, and a per<U+017F>on run out of all he had, he tru<U+017F>ted not his wife with the keeping of his Ca<U+017F>h, no not with the management of what was <U+017F>pent in the hou<U+017F>e; which quite defeated the hopes of <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who imagin'd, that, upon the marriage or his daughter, he <U+017F>hould command what were in her power; <U+017F>o <U+017F>trangely was he po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with the re<U+017F>tle<U+017F>s <U+017F>pirit of gaming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina,</hi> perceiving her husband was taken up with his affairs, took occa<U+017F>ion to go abroad every morning, upon pretence of a certain devotion <U+017F>he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, that it might plea<U+017F>e God to make her a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. With this excu<U+017F>e <U+017F>he blinded her husband, but the true motive of her <U+017F>allies, was to <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elf in the Streets and at Church. The fir<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <U+017F>ight of her, fell in love with her, was a Citizen's <U+017F>on of <hi>Sevil,</hi> one of the mo<U+017F>t debauch'd young men of his time, one, to <U+017F>ay all of him in a word, who had brought him<U+017F>elf almo<U+017F>t to the <U+017F>ame condition as <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>a:</hi> he was de<U+017F>cended of vertuous Parents, but his di<U+017F>orders had drown'd their good reputation. His name was <hi>Ruperio,</hi> a Spark of a goodly pre<U+017F>ence, and one who prov'd <U+017F>o fortunate in the courting of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina,</hi> that <U+017F>he was wholly at his devotion, hoping to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58823:11"/>
receive <U+017F>uch great pre<U+017F>ents from him, as might put her into cloaths <U+017F>utable to her beauty, which was more than <U+017F>he could have expected from the Mi<U+017F>er her husband.</p>
            <p>The fir<U+017F>t demand <U+017F>he made to him, was very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>t, con<U+017F>idering it came from a Merchant's wife, to wit, that he would be<U+017F>tow on her a Gown of the <U+017F>ame Stuff and Fa<U+017F>hion as a Neighbour of hers had, whom <U+017F>he named, and withall a gold-watch to hang by her <U+017F>ide, promi<U+017F>ing him in requital of that favour that <U+017F>he would not deny him any that lay in her power. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio,</hi> who by his in<U+017F>olent boa<U+017F>tings had rai<U+017F>ed her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a per<U+017F>ua<U+017F>ion of his being a per<U+017F>on that had thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ands at his command, promis'd to do what <U+017F>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ir'd; but being not able to perform, he <U+017F>et his wits to <U+017F>hew that trick, which his pur<U+017F>e could not. He happened to be well acquainted with her who<U+017F>e Gown was to be his pattern, he went to her, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to lend it him, pretending it was onely for the repre<U+017F>entation of a Comedy, which was to be acted in a Nunnery. It could not be deni'd on <U+017F>uch an account; <U+017F>o that at the end of three days, which time he told <hi>Rufina</hi> that it would be making, he <U+017F>ent it to her hou<U+017F>e, while her husband was abroad in the City about his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. The Watch he told her was not yet fini<U+017F>h'd, but that as <U+017F>oon as it were, it <U+017F>hould be brought her, intreating her in the mean time to accept of another of le<U+017F><U+017F>er value, as a ho<U+017F>tage for the appearance of the other. She return'd him her hearty thanks, was extremely pleas'd to <U+017F>ee that he had been <U+017F>o punctual, and to <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elf grateful, <U+017F>he gave him all the <U+017F>atisfaction he could expect from her.</p>
            <p>He took leave of <hi>Rufina,</hi> who re<U+017F>olv'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uade

her husband, that a certain Kin<U+017F>man of hers had <U+017F>ent her that Gown from <hi>Madrid,</hi> that <U+017F>o he might not be jealous of her. On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio</hi> was contriving how to get it return'd to her, of whom it had been borrowed. <hi>Saravia</hi> not knowing him, he effected his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s by this cheat. About three or four days after the delivery of the Gown to <hi>Rufina,</hi> he puts him<U+017F>elf into the habit of a Serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ju<U+017F>t at dinner time comes to <hi>Saravia</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aying that he was Servant to the Lady to whom that Gown belonged. <hi>Saravia</hi> order'd him to be brought in, which being done he told him that he was <U+017F>ent by his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s for the Gown <U+017F>he had lent Madam <hi>Rufina,</hi> onely to <U+017F>ee the fa<U+017F>hion of it. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia</hi> turning towards his wife, ask'd her what Gown the fellow would have?

unwilling to ri<U+017F>e out of your place, give me the key of your Trunk where it is, and I will go and fetch it. </q>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> upon this had not a word to <U+017F>ay, and at la<U+017F>t ready to bur<U+017F>t with indignation, <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e from the Table, took the Gown out of the Trunk, and delivering it to <hi>Ruperio,</hi>

She per<U+017F>uaded her husband to any thing, who, poor man, under<U+017F>tood little of the world be<U+017F>ides his trading. In the mean time, <U+017F>he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely incens'd again<U+017F>t <hi>Ruperio</hi> for the <U+017F>lovenly trick he had put upon her, in depriving her of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <U+017F>he was much taken with, and whereof <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf indi<U+017F>putably po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon re<U+017F>olv'd to be reveng'd on him, what ever it co<U+017F>t her; but thinking to communicate her de<U+017F>ign to her Maid, who was privy to all her <U+017F>ecret de<U+017F>igns, <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> who over-heard them, came to know the whole <U+017F>tory; and being acquainted with the Gallant, as being one who hanted the Gaming-hou<U+017F>es, and conceiving him<U+017F>elf oblig'd to revenge the affront done his daughter, he meets him in the <U+017F>treet one

day, and tells him, he de<U+017F>ir'd to mea<U+017F>ure the length of his Sword, upon what account he <U+017F>hould know, when they were come to the place. <hi>Ruperio</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him out of the City, and being out of Peoples <U+017F>ight, <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> told him what had occa<U+017F>ion'd his giving him that challenge. They pre<U+017F>ently drew, and made <U+017F>everal pa<U+017F><U+017F>es, but at la<U+017F>t <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi> prov'd the more unfortunate, for he was run through the heart, <U+017F>o that he died immediately, having not the time to make the lea<U+017F>t act of contrition; a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commonly happens to tho<U+017F>e who lead <U+017F>uch Lives as he had done. <hi>Ruperio</hi> took Sanctuary, and <hi>Trapa<U+017F><U+017F>a</hi>'s Body was brought to his Son-in-law's, where it was receiv'd, with a mixture of joy and grief; joy, that the Hou<U+017F>e was disburthen'd of one of the mo<U+017F>t humour<U+017F>ome and in<U+017F>upportable per<U+017F>ons in the world; and grief for the future charges of his enterrment.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Rufina</hi> made it appear by her lamentations and tears, that his death caus'd her as much affliction as it brought her husband joy. She would not hear of any con<U+017F>olation, pretending <U+017F>he had lo<U+017F>t all her <U+017F>upport in this world, for all the kinred and friends <U+017F>he had were now exchang'd for a husband, whom <U+017F>he could not affect. On the other <U+017F>ide <hi>Saravia</hi> thought him<U+017F>elf the happie<U+017F>t man in the world, to have a wife hand<U+017F>ome and young as his was. But <U+017F>he was indeed a little too hand<U+017F>ome and too young for him; that proportion of Age, which Parents ought chiefly to mind in the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of their Children, was not ob<U+017F>erv'd in this.

<U+017F>he is in the way to fancy any body. But for <hi>Rufina,</hi> the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>he had withall of going highly in cloaths, and to be reveng'd of <hi>Ruperio,</hi> made her break forth into all the exce<U+017F><U+017F>es, that exa<U+017F>perated Woman-kind can fall into, defile the Marriage-bed, and implicitely give her <U+017F>elf over to all tho<U+017F>e things, whence <U+017F>he might derive either <U+017F>atisfaction or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Nothing ran <U+017F>o much in her head as the injury <U+017F>he had receiv'd from <hi>Ruperio,</hi> which <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>uch, that <U+017F>he would not have Liv'd, but out of a hope to be reveng'd of him. But in regard <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t have other hands than her own to do that, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ought out all opportunities imaginable to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her <U+017F>elf of a Gallant, who would vigorou<U+017F>ly execute her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>One of tho<U+017F>e Fridays, which are <U+017F>olemnized with a great concour<U+017F>e of people from Ea<U+017F>ter to Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>untide, in <hi>Triana</hi> part of the Suburbs of <hi>Sevil,</hi> through which pa<U+017F><U+017F>es the <hi>Quadalquivir,</hi> the famous River of <hi>Andalu<U+017F>ia,</hi> and the Looking-gla<U+017F>s of that wealthy City; <hi>Rufina</hi> went into a Boat cover'd with branches, to go and <U+017F>ee that Fe<U+017F>tival, to which <U+017F>he was carried, by the expre<U+017F>s order of her husband, by a Neighbour of his, whom he thought one of the mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>creet and virtuous Women in the world. But he was not the fir<U+017F>t Man that was deceiv'd in a Woman; for, on the contrary, <U+017F>he was one of the wantone<U+017F>t and withall the <U+017F>imple<U+017F>t of the whole Sex. She therefore took up a Boat for her <U+017F>elf, <hi>Rufina,</hi> and two other Women of their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but though <U+017F>he had given the Water-man his full fare; yet was <U+017F>he ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded by him to take in other per<U+017F>ons into the Boat, and among tho<U+017F>e, a

young Man, who had his Sentinels at the Water-<U+017F>ide to give him notice of <U+017F>uch an opportunity. As <U+017F>oon as they were got into the Boat, <hi>Rufina</hi> unveil'd, and the Gallant (whom we will call <hi>Felician)</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>een, but he was <U+017F>urpriz'd with her Beauty. He thought her <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>ome, that he per<U+017F>uaded <U+017F>ome of his friends, who <U+017F>tood on the River-<U+017F>ide, to come into the Boat, and to effect that, greas'd the fi<U+017F>t of the Water-man. Being all got in, <hi>Felician</hi> took his place next to <hi>Rufina,</hi> into who<U+017F>e favour it was his de<U+017F>ign to in<U+017F>inuate him<U+017F>elf. He was Son to a per<U+017F>on of Quality, who had rais'd him<U+017F>elf to a va<U+017F>t fortune in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and had no Children but only this, who di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing of his wealth, as he pleas'd, it was conceiv'd it would not be long ere he <U+017F>catter'd abroad what his Father had not in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time raked together. For he was a con<U+017F>tant Game<U+017F>ter, a perpetual Courter of Ladies, and he maintain'd a con<U+017F>iderable crew of Hangers-on, who did him no other <U+017F>ervice than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company, and encourage him in his debauches. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e noble qualities, he was extreamly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant in point of cloaths, a vice not extraordinary in tho<U+017F>e young men of <hi>Sevil,</hi> who have all things at their own di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al, as he we <U+017F>peak of had.</p>
            <p>Having, as was <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>eated him<U+017F>elf next to <hi>Rufina,</hi> and his Camerades next to her friends, the Boat put off, and went very lei<U+017F>urely down the River, for which the Water-man was <U+017F>o much the better paid. <hi>Felician</hi> thought this time <U+017F>o precious that he lo<U+017F>t very little of it; he di<U+017F>cover'd his Love to <hi>Rufina</hi> in <U+017F>uch obliging expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, that <U+017F>he gave ab<U+017F>olute credit to his words, and, by her attention, <U+017F>atisfy'd him, that <U+017F>he was not di<U+017F>pleas'd with his company.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58823:14"/>
               <hi>Felician</hi> was a very ingenious per<U+017F>on, and of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good humour, upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions as tho<U+017F>e; he deliver'd him<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>martne<U+017F>s and grace, that the Ladies were extreamly well <U+017F>atisfy'd, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Rufina,</hi> who thought nothing comparable to his conver<U+017F>ation. She gave him her name, told him where <U+017F>he liv'd, and what profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion her husband was of, and in a word made him a kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of her more <U+017F>ecret affairs. <hi>Felician</hi> was as open to her, concluding his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with a thou<U+017F>and prote<U+017F>tations of <U+017F>ervice and obedience. The after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon was <U+017F>pent in complements and court<U+017F>hip, and to the great <U+017F>atisfaction of <hi>Rufina,</hi> who had two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns to carry on at the <U+017F>ame time; one, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of <hi>Ruperio,</hi> by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <hi>Felician;</hi> the other, to cajol the latter out of <U+017F>omewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cloaths and her extravagant expences. Nor did the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s happen otherwi<U+017F>e than <U+017F>he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign'd it.</p>
            <p>From that day <hi>Felician</hi> began to frequent the <U+017F>treet where <hi>Rufina</hi> liv'd, e<U+017F>pecially when he had intelligence that her husband was abroad about his affairs. <hi>Rufina,</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, re<U+017F>olv'd not to be over-ea<U+017F>ily conquer'd; for when <U+017F>he remembred how <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>erv'd by <hi>Ruperio,</hi> it rais'd in her a certain fear of receiving the like affront from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Before <U+017F>he admitted his entrance into the Hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he thought fit to make trial of his liberality. Of this <U+017F>he was in a <U+017F>hort time pretty well <U+017F>atisfy'd, for <hi>Felician</hi> had been a prodigal all his Life, but upon this occa<U+017F>ion exceeded all he had done before, <U+017F>end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her pre<U+017F>ents of cloaths, jewels, and other things, be<U+017F>ides the expences he was at in treatments and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58823:15"/>
collations: So that <hi>Rúfina</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfy'd Woman in the world. 'Tis commonly <U+017F>aid, that the higher a Man's enjoyments are, the <U+017F>ooner he is cloy'd, but it happen'd otherwi<U+017F>e with <hi>Felician,</hi> for his affection to <hi>Rufina</hi> encreas'd daily, and came up to that height it could not well be greater.</p>
            <p>It happen'd about this time, that <hi>Ruperio</hi> got at one time above <U+017F>ix hundred Crowns at play. He went always very high in cloaths; but this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected good fortune made him <U+017F>omewhat exceed his former gawdine<U+017F>s. But with that good, he had this ill fortune, to find out, that <hi>Felician</hi> was <U+017F>een very often in the <U+017F>treet where <hi>Rufina</hi> liv'd, and to infer thence, that he made <U+017F>ome addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to her. This jealou<U+017F>ie awoke the love he had <U+017F>ometimes had for her; it troubled him that he <U+017F>hould have any Rival, and thereupon he re<U+017F>olv'd to retrive him<U+017F>elf into her favour, and repair the injury, he was now <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, that he had done her. Upon this account, he pa<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>everal times through her <U+017F>treet, which caus'd not a little perplexity to <hi>Felician. Rufina</hi> was enrag'd to <U+017F>ee that the Impo<U+017F>tor had the impudence to make any pretence to her favour, after the notorious affront <U+017F>he had receiv'd at his hands. She con<U+017F>ider'd there was no way to be rid of his importunities, but to engage her beloved Gallant <hi>Felician</hi> in her quarrel, by per<U+017F>uading him, that <hi>Ruperio</hi>'s de<U+017F>ign was to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place him out of her affection, which if he valued, he would find <U+017F>ome means to check the in<U+017F>olence of his Rival, and deliver her from his odious Court<U+017F>hip. See what employments Women do many times put on their Gallants! <U+017F>etting them on, like Cocks, to fight, till they have de<U+017F>troy'd one the other.</p>

               <hi>Rufina</hi> thought it not prudence to acquaint <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lician</hi> with what had pa<U+017F>s'd between her and <hi>Ruperio.</hi> No, <U+017F>he took a <U+017F>afer cour<U+017F>e: She told him, that <hi>Ruperio</hi> was continually importuning her with very advantageous proffers, which yet, for his <U+017F>ake, <U+017F>he <U+017F>lighted. <hi>Felician</hi> believ'd her, and that the rather, in regard he met him every day, and many times in the night, walking the rounds about his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s's hou<U+017F>e. To incen<U+017F>e him the more, <U+017F>he added, that were it not for that trouble<U+017F>ome per<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he would <U+017F>ee him oftner than <U+017F>he did. There needed no more; <hi>Felician</hi> being thus enflam'd into jealou<U+017F>ie, met with <hi>Ruperio</hi> one night in his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s's <U+017F>treet, when he knew <hi>Rufina</hi> was a-bed, and her husband looking over <U+017F>ome Accounts, which concern'd his Agency. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Felician</hi> had perceiv'd <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio,</hi> he call'd him by his name, and having talk'd a little while together, to avoid the di<U+017F>covery of any quarrel in the Streets, he conducted to a little by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, which happen'd to be over again<U+017F>t the room where <hi>Saravia</hi> kept all his papers, and where he then was, very bu<U+017F>ie looking over them.

               <hi>Saravia,</hi> a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at what he had <U+017F>een and heard, began to be enrag'd again<U+017F>t his wife, contriving how
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58823:17"/>
to be reveng'd of a Woman, who<U+017F>e perfidiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s was the more notorious, the greater rea<U+017F>ons <U+017F>he had to be grate<U+017F>ul and loyal. She was fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep in her bed, never dreaming what had hapned in the <U+017F>treets upon her account. The fir<U+017F>t thing came into <hi>Saravia</hi>'s imagination, was altogether for revenge, to effect which his cour<U+017F>e would be, to go up <U+017F>treight into her chamber, and to di<U+017F>patch her, in bed, with a dagger. But he con<U+017F>ider'd with him<U+017F>elf, that the Murtherer having carried away the dead body from his door, he might be charg'd with killing her without any cau<U+017F>e, and that he would want proof, as having for witne<U+017F>s but two <U+017F>ervant-maids, who were more likely to depo<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t him. He therefore re<U+017F>olv'd, as the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t way to di<U+017F>patch her, to give her a <U+017F>ecret do<U+017F>e of poi<U+017F>on, <U+017F>uch as might remove her after a certain time: but he thought withal, that he <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his own ju<U+017F>t re<U+017F>entment, if he any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd a vengeance which requir'd immediate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. He propos'd to him<U+017F>elf another expedient, which was, to leave both City and Wife, and to go to <U+017F>ome other place: but that de<U+017F>ign was <U+017F>oon over with him, he having many affairs undetermin'd, and fearing the <U+017F>ini<U+017F>ter judgments might have been pa<U+017F>s'd upon <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>olution, to the <U+017F>hame and confu<U+017F>ion of a man of his age and reputation. This reflection brought him to his fir<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ign of <U+017F>ending her going with the ponyard. But before he executed that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty (which yet rightly taken was not any, but a ju<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hment for her offence) he thought it requi<U+017F>ite, <U+017F>or his own vindication, to leave, in writing, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons, which had induc'd him to commit that murther. He took pen and ink, and began to <U+017F>et down the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front

he had receiv'd from his wife, and the revenge he had taken: but upon <U+017F>econd thoughts, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining he had not <U+017F>ufficiently expre<U+017F>s'd the heinou<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of her crime, he tore what he had written; and this he did to the third time, <U+017F>o great were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion and di<U+017F>turbance of his thoughts. He <U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf down to write the fourth time; but remembring that he was to begin his revenge with adulteries, and could not do it becau<U+017F>e he knew not the <U+017F>everal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations thereof, he was at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfi'd, that he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ufficiently reveng'd if he had but once di<U+017F>patch'd his wife. A good part of the night <U+017F>lipp'd away in the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>quiets, <hi>viz.</hi> in writing, correcting, blotting out again, and tearing all he had written. At la<U+017F>t, being ab<U+017F>olutely re<U+017F>olv'd in that rage to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his de<U+017F>ign, he made another writing, without any blot, having before-hand well con<U+017F>ider'd what he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>et down; and when he had expre<U+017F>s'd, the be<U+017F>t he could, the injury he had receiv'd, he was o're-come by <U+017F>o pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing a grief that he fell down and dy'd <U+017F>uddenly.</p>
            <p>All this pa<U+017F>t, while <hi>Rufina</hi> flept. Awaking of a <U+017F>udden and not finding her husband in bed with her, <U+017F>he call'd him, and <U+017F>eeing he made no An<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>he put on her petticoat, and went into his clo<U+017F>et, where <U+017F>he found a candle lighted, and <hi>Saravia</hi> lying on the floor, dead. She was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd, as well <U+017F>he might; all <U+017F>he could do was to call up her Maids, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately came to the <U+017F>ight of this <U+017F>trange <U+017F>pectacle. They were no le<U+017F>s <U+017F>urpriz'd than their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s at the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F>s of the accident. As they were going to convey the Corps to one of the be<U+017F>t rooms in the hou<U+017F>e (before the neighbours had any notice of the

            <p>
               <hi>That my ju<U+017F>tification may be the better known to all tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>hall read this paper, I declare, that all my unhappine<U+017F>s proceeds from the lightne<U+017F>s and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>tancy of my infamous wife, who, profaning the holy Sacrament of Marriage, by the <U+017F>acred Tie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we were join'd together in the face of the Church, without any con<U+017F>ideration of the great affection I bore her, hath pro<U+017F>tituted her <U+017F>elf to two Gallants at the <U+017F>ame time, whe having quarrel'd for the precedence, which either of them pretended to over his adver<U+017F>ary, the more unfortunate of the two was kill'd by the other, before the window of my hou<U+017F>e. Having thus been witne<U+017F>s o<U+017F> my own di<U+017F>grace, and heard the whole <U+017F>tory of my di<U+017F>honour, it was but ju<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould revenge my infamy, thus</hi>—Then ended the writing, for death <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing him at that word he immediately expir'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> was extremely di<U+017F>tracted at both what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw and what <U+017F>he had read, <U+017F>o that, for half an hour, <U+017F>he knew not in a manner where <U+017F>he was, con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her <U+017F>elf, that the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecrets in the world will be di<U+017F>cover'd at la<U+017F>t, and that it is Heaven's plea<U+017F>ure they <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o, either for our reformation or our puni<U+017F>hment. The death of her husband rais'd in her a certain mixture of fear and affliction: a fear, to <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>udden it had been, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion'd by the re<U+017F>entment of an injury which <U+017F>he had done him; the affliction, to <U+017F>ee her husband deprived of life, and her <U+017F>elf ignorant how to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e <U+017F>o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy

an accident. A little remor<U+017F>e of con<U+017F>cience, like a qualm over her <U+017F>tomach, troubled her, that <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>o perfidious to a man, who had lov'd her <U+017F>o well, and, by marrying her, had rais'd her from beggery to plenty. The great affection which the Neighbours knew that he had always born her, gave her a little confidence, and induc'd her to take the advice of one of her Maids, which was to carry her husband's body into his bed, and to cry out the next morning <U+017F>o loud, that the Neighbours might here it, whom <U+017F>he might, by her exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive lamentations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uade, that <U+017F>he had found him dead by her <U+017F>ide when <U+017F>he awoke; and that her two Maids, to carry on the cheat, <U+017F>hould give out that their Ma<U+017F>ter had taken a <U+017F>urfeit, and died <U+017F>uddenly of it.</p>
            <p>Having thus laid their de<U+017F>ign, day came, <hi>Rufina</hi> cried out, and lamented with all her might, and the next Neighbours came in, who found her half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F>s'd, weeping, and tearing her hair through mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>he had lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>o good a husband. Her two Maids acted their parts very well, by relating the cau<U+017F>e of their good Ma<U+017F>ter's death, and <U+017F>aying, that they advis'd him not to eat <U+017F>o much, or that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e he mu<U+017F>t expect to repent it. All were <U+017F>atisfi'd with the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons, and <U+017F>ome of <hi>Rufina</hi>'s friends were bu<U+017F>ie about her, out of a fear <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>wounded, <U+017F>o well did <U+017F>he per<U+017F>onate the afflicted Lady. They did all lay in their power to comfort her, who, amid<U+017F>t all her grief, had not forgotten to burn the paper <U+017F>he had found, le<U+017F>t it might have prov'd a te<U+017F>timony of her mi<U+017F>carriages. Some Officers from the Magi<U+017F>trate, who are never wanting upon <U+017F>uch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ions, came in <U+017F>oon after, and upon the allegations
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58823:19"/>
of the Neighbours, that the deceas'd had ever liv'd very lovingly with his wife, went their ways, <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd that <U+017F>he had not any way contributed to his death. <hi>Saravia</hi> was buried, and <hi>Rufina</hi> was <U+017F>o put to it to act the part <U+017F>he was then engag'd in, that <U+017F>he thought not of doing what Widows commonly do upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions, that is, to make the be<U+017F>t provi<U+017F>ion they can for them<U+017F>elves, out of what their husbands have left. So that one of his Nephews, as <U+017F>oon as the Uncle was buried, <U+017F>eiz'd on all in the hou<U+017F>e, and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina</hi> was forc'd to go to Law with him, to recover what <U+017F>he might lawfully lay claim to.</p>
            <p>Let us return to <U+017F>ee what became of <hi>Ruperio</hi>'s body. Being found in the morning by the religious Inhabitants of the Mona<U+017F>tery, and not known by any of them, they were going, <hi>without <U+017F>ans cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,</hi> to burie it, had they not been prevented by a Citizen, who advis'd them to expo<U+017F>e it in <U+017F>ome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick place, that it might be known, and that if he were one that had father or mother, or friends in the City, that they might know the misfortune hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to him; that by that means, they would <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to them<U+017F>elves the charges of his interment, as al<U+017F>o the fees due for other prayers and devotions, in order to the repo<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>oul. This advice pleas'd the Superiour of the Mona<U+017F>tery, who immediately <U+017F>ent word to the Magi<U+017F>trate, that they had found in the morning a young man dead at their Chutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door. The body was di<U+017F>pos'd into a little place near the Mona<U+017F>tery, with two lighted wax-candles, by which place there pa<U+017F>s'd by not long after a man that knew him. He told them who he was, and then went and carried that <U+017F>ad news to his Friends, who were
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58823:19"/>
extremely troubled at his death, his Father having often foretold him, that he would come to <U+017F>uch an end; for, from the life he led, there could not any thing el<U+017F>e be inferr'd. He was buried in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tery, and a <U+017F>trict <U+017F>earch was made for him who had committed the murther: but <hi>Sevil</hi> being a va<U+017F>t and populous City, no di<U+017F>covery could be made of him. Onely <hi>Rufina</hi> knew who it was, by the ab<U+017F>ence of her Gallant, <hi>Ruperio</hi>'s death, and the paper <U+017F>he found in her husband's clo<U+017F>et. She was infinitely <U+017F>atisfi'd to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elf reveng'd of a per<U+017F>on, who had done her <U+017F>uch an affront; and it was a great happine<U+017F>s to her, that no notice had been taken of the bloud, which the deceas'd had <U+017F>pilt at the place where he was kill'd. Had the Magi<U+017F>trate known of that, it would have brought her into <U+017F>ome trouble, for the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours would have te<U+017F>tifi'd, that they had often <U+017F>een tho<U+017F>e two Rivals in that little <U+017F>treet.</p>
            <p>By this means <hi>Rufina</hi> is become a Widow, but withall poor and de<U+017F>titute of all accommodations, having onely the <U+017F>tock of her beauty to <U+017F>et her <U+017F>elf up again; and that, together with her honour (if it may be <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he had any left) <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olv'd to pro<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, that <U+017F>he might live in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>utably to what <U+017F>he had done before. <hi>Saravia</hi>'s Nephew, who had taken po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of all his e<U+017F>tate, was <U+017F>entenc<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>d to pay <hi>Rufina</hi> <U+017F>omewhat upon the account of dower; but it was <U+017F>o incon<U+017F>iderable, in re<U+017F>pect of the expence <U+017F>he was wont to be at, that <U+017F>he was forc'd to leave the hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was in and take one of a lower rent. Nor had this Nephew what he expected by being heir to his Uncle, for the e<U+017F>tate was extremely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd, <U+017F>o that having even'd<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> accounts with the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58823:20"/>
he had but little left for him<U+017F>elf.</p>

               <hi>Rufina,</hi> having remov'd into another Quarter of the City, and being young, <U+017F>umptuous in cloaths, and perfectly hand<U+017F>ome, did not as many other Widows are wont to do, who, as <U+017F>oon as their husbands are march'd off, dre<U+017F>s them<U+017F>elves as fine as hands can make them, and deriving a little advantage from their mourning <U+017F>eek out opportunities to <U+017F>hew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves to the Gallants purely out of a de<U+017F>ign to get other husbands.

            <p>There was come in the Fleet from <hi>Peru</hi> a man born amid<U+017F>t the Mountains of <hi>Leon,</hi> who had begun his fortune by the relation of a Servant to a Merchant of <hi>Sevil,</hi> and one who, upon his Ma<U+017F>ter's co<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>ome little trading into the <hi>Indies,</hi> was grown rich, in<U+017F>omuch that within few years, he was accounted one of the able<U+017F>t Merchants that traded to <hi>Peru.</hi> He makes another voiage thither, being advanc'd to a certain publick employment, and having thereby added much to his wealth, he was return'd again to <hi>Sevil,</hi> in that years Fleet, where he <U+017F>old the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities he had brought over at double what they had co<U+017F>t him; <U+017F>o fortunate was he in all his ventures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> (<U+017F>o was this lucky Merchant call'd) was a per<U+017F>on of about fifty years of age; the mo<U+017F>t covetous and wretched'<U+017F>t natur'd fellow that ever was. He grudg'd him<U+017F>elf what he eat and drunk, though even below moderation; nay he many times fa<U+017F>ted pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>pare <U+017F>o much. He had no more <U+017F>ervants than he needed; his whole Train con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, a Lacquey, a Moor-<U+017F>lave, who look'd to his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58823:20"/>
Mule, and a Maid to dre<U+017F>s his pitiful Commons. He kept his Family <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort in point of victuals, that it was wondred any one would <U+017F>erve him; his Mi<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition found the whole City di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; another would have been a<U+017F>ham'd of it, but he onely laugh'd at it, applauding him<U+017F>elf, and making it his whole bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to heap up wealth, whereof he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> hearing this account of him, began to con<U+017F>ider all the circum<U+017F>tances, and after <U+017F>he had a little reflected thereon, <U+017F>he concluded, that he might be made an excellent Cully, whom if <U+017F>he could <U+017F>mite, as <U+017F>he expected, her condition would be better than ever it had been. <hi>Marquina</hi> liv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, in a little Tenement he had purchas'd of one who ought him <U+017F>ome mony, which he knew not well how to get in otherwi<U+017F>e; for he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <U+017F>o perfect a <U+017F>lave to his profit, that he little minded his plea<U+017F>ures. So that he got that Tenement, with a neat hou<U+017F>e on it, very cheap, and in <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for his debt; it <U+017F>tood near S. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<U+017F>tery, in the mid<U+017F>t of a plea<U+017F>ant valley. He liv'd here to <U+017F>pare the rent of a hou<U+017F>e in the City; he had <U+017F>o fortifi'd it, that no thieves, either by day or night, could make any breach into it; all the doors were of extraordinary thickne<U+017F>s, the windows had bars and grates, the walls very high and very <U+017F>trong. He had <U+017F>ecur'd the place within with many fire-Arms, which he always kept charged, Halbards, and Parti<U+017F>ans, which were di<U+017F>pos'd near the gate. He was forc'd to take one per<U+017F>on more into his retinue, to wit, a fellow to order his Garden, and to make the be<U+017F>t ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he could of it, a married man, who <U+017F>hould
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58823:21"/>
carry the fruits and other things to the market to make the be<U+017F>t of them, <U+017F>o vigilant was his Avarice. His trea<U+017F>ure was di<U+017F>pos'd into a <U+017F>ecret place behind his bed where he lay him<U+017F>elf, in <U+017F>trong iron che<U+017F>ts; and every night before he went to bed, he, like an over-doing Con<U+017F>table, <U+017F>earch'd all the rooms in the hou<U+017F>e.

But <hi>Garay,</hi> who knew the vertue and power of mony, took a con<U+017F>iderable <U+017F>um out of his pocket, and giving it to the Gardener, <q>Here, friend, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> take this in earne<U+017F>t of more.</q> The Gardener's wife longing to know what bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s they might have with her husband, comes up to them, and <U+017F>eeing the proffers were made him, undertook to lodge the Gentlewoman in her own room, making it appear to her husband, that their Ma<U+017F>ter <U+017F>hould never come to the knowledge of it, in regard their hou<U+017F>es were at a good di<U+017F>tance one from the other, and that they <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>o unhappy, as that he would that night <U+017F>earch the whole hou<U+017F>e, as many times a toy took him in the head to do.</p>
            <p>In fine the wife's arguments prevail'd, <U+017F>o that the Gardener was content the Gentlewoman <U+017F>hould lodge <U+017F>ecretly that night at his hou<U+017F>e, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of <U+017F>ix Ryals which <hi>Garay</hi> gave him as an

            <p>Being come into the Gardener's room, <U+017F>he took off what cover'd her face, and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener and his wife at the <U+017F>ight of her beauty, though <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd to be very melancholy, as if <U+017F>ome great misfortune had happened to her, to wit, that which <U+017F>he had ready to relate to <hi>Marquina,</hi> in ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>he might come to <U+017F>peech with him. The Sun was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>et, but he came into the Garden: the Negro en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring a little before to have the door opened, which he him<U+017F>elf lock'd on the in<U+017F>ide, and carried the key along with him. He chanc'd to be that night a little more weary than he us'd, which occa<U+017F>ion'd his going to bed very betimes, after he had eaten a piece of bread, and <U+017F>ome of his own Garden fruits, and wa<U+017F>h'd them down with a gla<U+017F>s of <U+017F>pring-water. He onely vi<U+017F>ited that part of the hou<U+017F>e where he lodg'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, and came not down to the Gardener's, which e<U+017F>cap'd not his privy <U+017F>earch, when he thought of it. His family, who kept more fa<U+017F>ting-days in the year, than the Church her <U+017F>elf had appointed, <U+017F>upp'd that night, in imitation of the Ma<U+017F>ter, very <U+017F>oberly.</p>

               <hi>Marquina</hi> gets up the next morning betimes, and gives the Slave mony to go to the market, while he went about his affairs in the City, with order to have dinner ready again<U+017F>t his return. <hi>Rufina</hi> was at a lo<U+017F>s how to compa<U+017F>s her de<U+017F>ign, finding things fell not out according to her expectation: but <U+017F>till waiting the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, <U+017F>he told her entertainers that <U+017F>he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely

troubled at her Uncle's <U+017F>tay (<U+017F>o <U+017F>he called <hi>Garay)</hi> and that all her <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s proceeded thence. The Gardener's wife, who was a good hearty woman, found her all the diver<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he could.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> comes home at noon, with an intention to dine in his garden, and before he <U+017F>ate down, he would needs take a turn about it, to <U+017F>ee if any thing were wanting; and he ob<U+017F>erv'd that there wanted <U+017F>ome pieces of wood for the more convenient wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the <U+017F>everal Knots. As he was going to the Gardeners to <U+017F>ee if he had any fit for that purpo<U+017F>e, the wife perceiving him coming, very ha<U+017F>tily <U+017F>huf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled <hi>Rufina</hi> into a little back-room, where <U+017F>he was wont to lie: but in regard it could not be done <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly, but that <hi>Marquina</hi> coming in might hear the ruffling of the <U+017F>ilks, and <U+017F>ee <hi>Rufina</hi>'s <U+017F>hadow, he <U+017F>teps into the room where <U+017F>he was retir'd, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found her, he led her out by the hand, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her into the light, he found her <U+017F>o beautiful, that he was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd thereat. The Gardeners wife won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that her Ma<U+017F>ter, in<U+017F>tead of chiding her, as <U+017F>he expected, onely ask'd her who the Lady was. She an<U+017F>wer'd, that, the night before, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by their door with an ancient Gentleman, who <U+017F>eem'd as <U+017F>ad as her <U+017F>elf, they had very earne<U+017F>tly intreated <U+017F>he might be lodg'd there but that night, to avoid a great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, which would have hapned to them, if they had gone any further.</p>
            <p>While the Gardener's wife was giving <hi>Marquina</hi> this account, he very attentively con<U+017F>ider'd the <U+017F>trange Lady, who <U+017F>eem'd to be extremely troubled in mind, which added to the attractions of her Beauty. <hi>Marquina</hi> was <U+017F>o taken therewith, that di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carding
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58823:23"/>
his un<U+017F>ociable and covetous humour, he told the Gardener's wife, that <U+017F>he had done very well, in entertaining that Lady, though contrary to his orders, which in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e were not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd, where compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion and charity plead for the relief of tho<U+017F>e that are in trouble. <q>This Lady, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> de<U+017F>erves a better reception than <U+017F>he hath found in your poor lodgings, I heartily proffer her my hou<U+017F>e, if <U+017F>he will but honour it with her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence. </q>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> thank'd him very civilly for his oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proffers, and intreated him to allow her the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy of <U+017F>ome other lodging, for the little time <U+017F>he had to <U+017F>tay there, in regard <U+017F>he expected an Uncle of hers to come and fetch her away that night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina,</hi> who began to be enflam'd, was <U+017F>orry to hear that her <U+017F>tay at his hou<U+017F>e would be <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort, but after a little pau<U+017F>e, he told her, that though it were but for an hour, <U+017F>he would infinitely oblige him, in the acceptation of the proffer he made her with <U+017F>o much affection. She, who expected that cue all the while, told him, that, to make <U+017F>ome return to <U+017F>o great civilities, <U+017F>he was ready to wait on him. With that <U+017F>he went to <hi>Marquina</hi>'s apartment, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he led her by the hand, to the great <U+017F>atisfaction of the Gardener's wife, who extremely wondred to <U+017F>ee her Ma<U+017F>ter, contrary to his cu<U+017F>tom, of a civil and obliging humour. As <U+017F>he pa<U+017F>s'd through the rooms, <U+017F>he took particular notice of all things; for though <hi>Marquina</hi> were naturally a very covetous per<U+017F>on, yet, as to the furniture of his hou<U+017F>e, he was otherwi<U+017F>e. He had very rich Tape<U+017F>try, Chairs <U+017F>utable thereto, and Cabinets of Ivory and Ebony, nay indeed many things brought out of the <hi>Indics,</hi> which though they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58823:23"/>
co<U+017F>t him not much there, are here of very great price. He immediately commanded his Slave to prepare an excellent dinner, an employment he undertook with great alacrity, as knowing he might make <U+017F>ome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of that extraordinary liberality of his Ma<U+017F>ter. <hi>Rufina</hi> din'd with him, who treated her <U+017F>till with the be<U+017F>t the Table afforded, with importunate excu<U+017F>es that there were no better for her.</p>
            <p>As <U+017F>oon as they had din'd, he conducted her into a chamber, <U+017F>et forth with a great number of excellent pictures, where there was al<U+017F>o a <U+017F>umptuous bed, of <hi>China-</hi>work, and intreated her to repo<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf on it, a cu<U+017F>tom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have in Summer, as <U+017F>oon as they have din'd, by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>ultrine<U+017F>s of the Country. He intreated al<U+017F>o to give her di<U+017F>quiet <U+017F>ome remi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, out of an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be as <U+017F>afe in his hou<U+017F>e as in any Sanctuary, and that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not want any thing lay in his power. She again return'd him her mo<U+017F>t affectionate thanks, and complying with his de<U+017F>ires, <U+017F>he <U+017F>taid alone in the room, which was the <U+017F>ame where <hi>Marquina</hi> took his repo<U+017F>e every day. He went into another, where he laid him<U+017F>elf down, much troubled and di<U+017F>quieted, as being fallen deeply in love with his fair Gue<U+017F>t, and not knowing by what means he might induce her to favour him in what he de<U+017F>ir'd of her, which if he could effect, he concluded him<U+017F>elf the happie<U+017F>t man in the world. Before he acquainted her with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign, he was de<U+017F>irous to know the cau<U+017F>e of her grief, and what might occa<U+017F>ion her <U+017F>topping at his Garden, and thereby find whether there were any ob<U+017F>truction that might oppo<U+017F>e his de<U+017F>ires to <U+017F>erve her.

            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> thinking it now time to <U+017F>peak to her, in order to the <U+017F>atisfaction of his curio<U+017F>ity, goes into her chamber, telling her it was a clo<U+017F>e day, and that he was afraid <U+017F>he might over-<U+017F>leep her <U+017F>elf, and crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her pardon that he had taken the boldne<U+017F>s to give her that caution.

I <U+017F>pent the days at my needle, not taking example from my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58823:24"/>
who onely minded their diverti<U+017F>ements; nay I was <U+017F>o ignorant what love meant, that I laugh'd at whatever related thereto, and thought tho<U+017F>e, who <U+017F>pent their time in court<U+017F>hips and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining tho<U+017F>e they call'd their Gallants, little better than <U+017F>o many di<U+017F>tracted per<U+017F>ons. But Love it <U+017F>eems would puni<U+017F>h this contempt of mine, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee how he did it. My Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being one day gone to vi<U+017F>it a friend of theirs in the Country, who had buried his wife not long before, I heard in the <U+017F>treet the cla<U+017F>hing of <U+017F>words, as if <U+017F>ome people had been fighting. I look'd out at the window to <U+017F>ee what might be the matter. I had never been guilty of <U+017F>uch a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<U+017F>ity before, and had it been God's plea<U+017F>ure I <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>hunn'd it then, I <U+017F>hould not now be telling you my misfortunes, which are <U+017F>uch, that I <U+017F>hall never think on them without tears. I there <U+017F>aw, to my <U+017F>orrow, three men with their <U+017F>words drawn, fighting again<U+017F>t one, who defended him<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>o great courage, that he not onely made his party good a long time again<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many enemies, but al<U+017F>o hurt two of them in the head, he him<U+017F>elf having receiv'd onely a <U+017F>light wound. The<U+017F>e three Hectors finding them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o wor<U+017F>ted by one per<U+017F>on, re<U+017F>olv'd to do their utmo<U+017F>t to take away his life; <U+017F>o that exa<U+017F>perated by their wounds, they pre<U+017F>s'd upon him <U+017F>o much, that he was forc'd to retreat within our gate, where they gave him two <U+017F>everal thru<U+017F>ts into the brea<U+017F>t, upon which he fell, and was left for dead.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58823:25"/>
calling my Maids about me, to <U+017F>ee what might be done for him, (our hou<U+017F>e being in a lone-<U+017F>treet) for tho<U+017F>e who were come upon the noi<U+017F>e we made were <U+017F>o few, and tho<U+017F>e unarm'd, that they were not able to part them. We lock'd the doors and brought him in, and a Chirurgeon was immediately <U+017F>ent for. His wounds were <U+017F>o great, that we thought fit to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e him into a bed, in a ground-room, where my Brother was wont to lie. The young man thank'd me very civilly for the favour he receiv'd from me; but alas! that good office began with Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but ended in Love. The Chirurgeon view'd his wounds, but could not pre<U+017F>ently give any certain judgment of them, though he whi<U+017F>per'd me in the ear, that he thought they might co<U+017F>t him his life. That account of him <U+017F>truck me to the heart, for having <U+017F>een him fight <U+017F>o gallantly, I mu<U+017F>t needs acknowledge, that I had even then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an inclination for him. But his kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions afterwards, and his thanking me <U+017F>o gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly for the obligations he <U+017F>aid I had put upon him, rais'd it into a perfect Love. My Father and Mother return'd from their vi<U+017F>it, and, ere they were got to our hou<U+017F>e, were told by one of the Neighbours, a per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome quality, what had happened in their ab<U+017F>ence, and how that I had put a period to a quarrel, by entertaining the wounded party into their hou<U+017F>e, out of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion and a fear that he might be kill'd; whereat they were well <U+017F>atisfi'd, and commended the charitable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice I had done at <U+017F>uch an extremity; for they were per<U+017F>ons who gladly embrac'd any opportunity to exerci<U+017F>e their charity. They vi<U+017F>ited the wounded,

encourag'd him to take heart, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him he <U+017F>hould want nothing their Hou<U+017F>e could afford, and acknowledg'd it well done by me, that I had <U+017F>o re<U+017F>cu'd him, upon which I took occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>pend mo<U+017F>t of my time in waiting on him; him, I <U+017F>ay, who is the cau<U+017F>e of all the troubles and afflictions which lye <U+017F>o heavy upon me. At the <U+017F>econd dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, the Chirurgeon a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd us that his wounds were not mortal, which caus'd much joy in our Hou<U+017F>e, particularly to me, who became every day more and more pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love with him. As often as I could get out of my Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's fight, I went to pa<U+017F>s away the time in his Chamber, for which kindne<U+017F>s he made me extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary acknowledgments.</p>
               <p>This young Cavalier was born at <hi>Pampeluna,</hi> and one of the mo<U+017F>t eminent in that City. His bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s at <hi>Granada</hi> was to pro<U+017F>ecute a Law-<U+017F>uit, again<U+017F>t a very powerful per<U+017F>on, who finding but little ju<U+017F>tice of his <U+017F>ide, that the cau<U+017F>e was of great importance, and that notwith<U+017F>tanding the favour he had in Court, the Judges mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s <U+017F>entence again<U+017F>t him, would put a period to the Suit by a <U+017F>horter cut, and rid him<U+017F>elf of his Adver<U+017F>ary, by employing three Men to murther him, who were his own menial Servants. A month <U+017F>lipp'd away, ere <hi>Leonardo</hi> (<U+017F>o was the wounded per<U+017F>on named) got out of his Bed, having all that time been atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with as much care as might be. The <U+017F>econd day after his getting up, he had the opportunity to <U+017F>ee me, for my Mother was gone abroad upon a vi<U+017F>it, wherein I accompany'd her not, becau<U+017F>e I had a greater mind to be alone with my young

Gallant. He di<U+017F>cover'd him<U+017F>elf to me <U+017F>o oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely, and gave me <U+017F>uch <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of his affection, that it rais'd a no le<U+017F>s in me towards him, in<U+017F>omuch that there pa<U+017F>t mutual promi<U+017F>es of fidelity between us. I knew nothing all this time that my Father was upon a treaty of Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and a Gentleman of <hi>Granada,</hi> who was infinitely de<U+017F>irous to enter into our alliance, while I was very well <U+017F>atisfy'd with the choice I had made my <U+017F>elf. <hi>Leonardo,</hi> coming to hear of the others preten<U+017F>ions to me, was not a little troubled at it; but the onely remedy was patience, in regard he would make no di<U+017F>covery of his E<U+017F>tate, till his Law-<U+017F>uit were ended, which he hoped would be in a <U+017F>hort time, and I in the mean time kept my Father in play with per<U+017F>ua<U+017F>ions, that he would not be over-ha<U+017F>ty in concluding my Marriage with the <hi>Granadine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonardo</hi> being perfectly cur'd, and requiting the kindne<U+017F>s and noble entertainment he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at our Hou<U+017F>e, with many con<U+017F>iderable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ents, return'd to his own Quarters, to bring his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to a final end. For my part, my troubles increas'd more and more upon me; for my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, never giving me any notice of it, as if I had been a per<U+017F>on not at all concern'd, concluded the contract with the <hi>Granadine,</hi> and pa<U+017F>s'd his word he <U+017F>hould have me; which when I came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand, I was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trucken, that I minded not what I did. This new Servant of mine, who expected ere long to be my Ma<U+017F>ter, came to give me a vi<U+017F>it: but I <U+017F>oon <U+017F>atisfy'd him, that he had reckon'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s, for whereas he had flatter'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58823:26"/>
into a fooli<U+017F>h imagination that he <U+017F>hould have found the kinde<U+017F>t reception in the world from me, he met with <U+017F>uch a repul<U+017F>e, as he him<U+017F>elf conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, mu<U+017F>t rather proceed from the aver<U+017F>ion, than any indifference I had for him. In a word, being not of tho<U+017F>e Favourites of fortune, who promi<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves the attainment of things impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, he ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cover'd, that my refu<U+017F>al was the effect of <U+017F>ome other cau<U+017F>e, than the mode<U+017F>ty, which a young Maid ought at lea<U+017F>t pretend to upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions: and knowing withall that the wounded <hi>Leonardo</hi> had lodg'd <U+017F>ome time in our Hou<U+017F>e, he pre<U+017F>um'd, that my di<U+017F>dain towards him was occa<U+017F>ion'd by the love I had for the other, and thence inferr'd, that having not been <U+017F>o happy as to prevent him in the acqui<U+017F>ition of my favour, he had, at be<U+017F>t, but a hazardous after-game to recover it. The jealou<U+017F>ie he conceiv'd upon this pre<U+017F>umption oblig'd him to make trial of all the ways he could imagine, to be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of it, <U+017F>o as that he might not do any thing, whereof it <U+017F>hould afterwards repent him. Should all do <U+017F>o, there would not be <U+017F>o many groundle<U+017F>s quarrels. I was in an extraordinary confu<U+017F>ion during the<U+017F>e overtures; I acquainted <hi>Leonardo</hi> with my condition; he came to <U+017F>ee me that very night, and we agreed, the next, to leave my Father's hou<U+017F>e, and to go to <U+017F>ome of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where we might be <U+017F>ecretly Married. The expected hour being come (unhappy hour to me, con<U+017F>idering the misfortunes I have run through <U+017F>ince!) as my Deare<U+017F>t and I were going out of the Hou<U+017F>e and cro<U+017F><U+017F>ing into another Street, my jealous Servant (who <U+017F>pent the nights to be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd

of his <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, which he now found to be too true) pre<U+017F>ently knew us, and, attended by two Servants, he <U+017F>et upon <hi>Leonardo,</hi> never thinking of any <U+017F>uch <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o that ere he had the time to draw his Sword, he receiv'd three mortal wounds, and fell down dead, having not been able to <U+017F>peak one word. The little noi<U+017F>e which the murtherers had made, occa<U+017F>ion'd the Neighbours to come out with lights, upon the appearance whereof they ran away, fearing they might be di<U+017F>cover'd. By this time there was a great <U+017F>tir at my Father's, that I could not be found, while I was in a manner dead, to <U+017F>ee my Deare<U+017F>t lying breathle<U+017F>s at my feet. Having recover'd my <U+017F>elf, I con<U+017F>ider'd it was to little purpo<U+017F>e for me to <U+017F>tay in the <U+017F>treet, after <U+017F>uch an accident, <U+017F>o that putting off my Pattins, and tucking up my Coats, I ran away as fa<U+017F>t as I could, to a friend's hou<U+017F>e of my Father's, an aged per<U+017F>on and very poor, whom I told what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me, and how much it concern'd me not to <U+017F>tay any longer at <hi>Granada.</hi> Whereupon taking a Hor<U+017F>e, he <U+017F>et me on him, and brought me to the next Village, where we took up another for him, and thence we are come hither, to avoid my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, accompany'd by Officers, makes a <U+017F>earch after me, as I have under<U+017F>tood by the way. For that rea<U+017F>on I thought it not <U+017F>afe, that we <U+017F>hould go into <hi>Sevil</hi> as <U+017F>oon as we came hither, but that it was better I conceal'd my <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>ome place near it. It was the plea<U+017F>ure of fortune to direct me to this Habitation of yours, into which, upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary intreaties your Gardener ventur'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me for this la<U+017F>t night.</p>

Thus Sir, have you the <U+017F>tory of a wretched Maid (if there ever were any <U+017F>uch) who<U+017F>e onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort now is in the good entertainment you are pleas'd to afford her. May Heaven requite your charity, <U+017F>ince there cannot be a greater than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <U+017F>uch as are afflicted and per<U+017F>ecuted to the extremity that I am.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The conclu<U+017F>ion of this di<U+017F>mal <U+017F>tory, which <hi>Rufina</hi> had had the time to invent and <U+017F>tudy <U+017F>o well, was a <U+017F>hower of Crocodile-tears, which rais'd <U+017F>uch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in <hi>Marquina,</hi> that he could not forbear them him<U+017F>elf. The <U+017F>ubtle Baggage, who notwith<U+017F>tanding her counterfeit tears ob<U+017F>erv'd all the actions of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quina,</hi> perceiv'd that he gave credit to her feign'd <U+017F>tory, and that Love began to enter at that breach which compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had made in his heart. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd <hi>Rufina</hi> to pro<U+017F>ecute her impo<U+017F>ture, being now in a manner confident to bring it to <U+017F>ome effect. They continu'd a good while together, <U+017F>he weeping, as if <U+017F>he had done it for a wager, and he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all he could to comfort her: but that comfort came not up to the height of offering her the remedy <U+017F>he could have wi<U+017F>h'd, for he had not yet overcome his covetous humour.</p>
            <p>Having with great attention con<U+017F>ider'd the great beauty of <hi>Rufina,</hi> her affliction, and <U+017F>trange adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that this happine<U+017F>s was as it were fallen into his mouth, he inferr'd that Heaven, as a <U+017F>ignal addition to his former happine<U+017F>s, had directed her to his Hou<U+017F>e. This was the fir<U+017F>t love that had ever mov'd <hi>Marquina</hi>'s heart, and, in all <U+017F>orts of per<U+017F>ons that fir<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion ever acts violently. Is <hi>Marquina</hi> fallen in love? He mu<U+017F>t needs then be liberal. Hath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58823:28"/>
he entertain'd <hi>Rufina</hi> into his Hou<U+017F>e? That kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s will be the deare<U+017F>t to him that he ever did. O Love! O in<U+017F>inuating Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, who do<U+017F>t bewitch the World, who do<U+017F>t ruine and be<U+017F>et Men! what Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morpho<U+017F>es do<U+017F>t thou not work in them? what Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>itions do<U+017F>t thou not change? what Re<U+017F>olutions do<U+017F>t thou not di<U+017F>pence with? what Felicities do<U+017F>t thou not di<U+017F>turb? And what Hearts is it not in thy power to <U+017F>often? That of this in<U+017F>atiable Mi<U+017F>er, which had ca<U+017F>t off all <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of humanity towards his neare<U+017F>t Relations, love hath chang'd; <U+017F>o that he hath transform'd a covetous and <U+017F>ordid Per<U+017F>on into a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and magnificent. He is extreamly taken with <hi>Rufina;</hi> he is pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love with her; <U+017F>he will ere long be Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of his heart and wealth. She <U+017F>aid many things in her relation, which might have betray'd her, had not the affection, wherewith <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quina</hi> hearkened to her, clos'd both his Eyes and Ears: nay, he was <U+017F>o prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd with his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that he would have believ'd many other things from her, though they had been more improbable than they were.</p>
            <p>The effect of this <U+017F>ad narration of <hi>Rufina,</hi> was, that <hi>Marquina</hi> proffer'd her all the favour and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <U+017F>he could expect from him, his E<U+017F>tate, Life, Heart and Soul, giving her the title of ab<U+017F>olute Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of all he was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of, further entreating her, of all love, to give over thinking of her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her <U+017F>elf that <U+017F>he was in a Hou<U+017F>e where <U+017F>he might command, and that what ever <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ir'd, her orders <U+017F>hould be obey'd, as far as it lay in his power. <hi>Rufina</hi> very kindly thank'd him for <U+017F>o many generous proffers, concluding her complement
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58823:28"/>
with a fre<U+017F>h <U+017F>hower of tears, a kind of tempe<U+017F>t <U+017F>he could rai<U+017F>e, when ever <U+017F>he either pleas'd, or <U+017F>tood in need thereof.</p>
            <p>With the<U+017F>e artifices, <U+017F>he became Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quina</hi> and all he had, <U+017F>o as that <U+017F>he might di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of him and it, as <U+017F>he pleas'd. Her beauty had given him a kind of Itch, and he was mighty de<U+017F>irous to try whether <U+017F>he would be as willing to cure him of it: but he knew not well how to acquaint her with his indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition; he re<U+017F>olv'd at la<U+017F>t, in ca<U+017F>e he could do no good upon her by his <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ions and pre<U+017F>ents, to u<U+017F>e the la<U+017F>t remedy, which was to Marry her. This is a Bait that many times takes the <U+017F>hye<U+017F>t of that <U+017F>ubtle Sex; but when they are <U+017F>o taken, he that does it is commonly <U+017F>napp'd him<U+017F>elf. I told you before, that <hi>Rufina</hi> had no other de<U+017F>ign than to examine the Che<U+017F>ts of the greedy Merchant, and that <U+017F>he would not be any way engag'd till <U+017F>he were <U+017F>ecure of her prize; for the ra<U+017F>cally trick <U+017F>hewn by <hi>Ruperio,</hi> had made her extreamly di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> <U+017F>taid all that day in his Garden, and neglected his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in the City; but the next morning betimes, leaving his Gue<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep, he takes his Mule, and goes about his ordinary occa<U+017F>ions, having charg'd the Gardener's Wife, to get a good breakfa<U+017F>t for the Lady, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he were awake, and to have a care of the Hou<U+017F>e. He lock'd the Chamber-door where his Money was, and as he went out, charg'd the Gardener not to <U+017F>uffer any to come into his Garden, but the Old man who had brought <hi>Theodora</hi> thither, for that was the name the di<U+017F><U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <hi>Rufina</hi> had given her <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>That done, he went about his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, attended
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58823:29"/>
by the little Negro, whom he gave Money to buy Provi<U+017F>ions for a good Dinner. <hi>Rufina</hi> got up, and the Gardener's wife punctually obey'd the orders <U+017F>he had receiv'd from her Ma<U+017F>ter, treating her the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>he could, out of this re<U+017F>pect, that all the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ticks made their advantage of tho<U+017F>e magnificences. <hi>Rufina</hi> comes down into the Garden, where <U+017F>he took occa<U+017F>ion to commend the walks, and contrivances of it, for the Gardener kept it in very good order, and well <U+017F>upply'd with herbs, fruits, and flowers. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sun beginning to grow hot, <U+017F>he went into the Hou<U+017F>e, where ca<U+017F>ually meeting with a Lute, on which <hi>Marquina</hi>'s factor was wont to play, <U+017F>he <U+017F>et it in Tune, and made that her entertainment, till <U+017F>uch time as <hi>Marquina</hi> return'd from the City, who hearing her at it, was not a little glad to find that perfection in her more than he knew before. Perceiving that <hi>Marquina</hi> hearkened to her Mu<U+017F>ick, <U+017F>he joyn'd her Voice to the In<U+017F>trument, to breed one maggot more in his brain than he had already. She <U+017F>ung <U+017F>o excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that <hi>Marquina</hi> was ravi<U+017F>h'd at the melody, and acknowledg'd that it was not the Voice of a mortal Creature, but an Angel come down from Heaven. He continu'd his attention a while, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining <U+017F>he would have begun another Song; but perceiving <U+017F>he laid by the Lute, he comes into the Room, and, tran<U+017F>ported with joy, <q>How hath this poor Habitation been felicify'd, <hi><U+017F>aid he to her,</hi> by your retirement into it, mo<U+017F>t adorable <hi>Theodora?</hi> What happine<U+017F>s did the hour of your arrival here bring me who never had known any before?

No more complements, I be<U+017F>eech you, <hi>replies Marquina, rais'd up to the highe<U+017F>t pitch of be<U+017F>otted Love,</hi> my words come <U+017F>hort of my faith, and I am to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you withall, Madam, that though I have heard excellent Voices in <hi>Sevil,</hi> (for I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s there are <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch) yet yours is infinitely beyond any of them.

Let not that create you any trouble, <hi>replies the amorous Merchant,</hi> but rather imagine there may be <U+017F>ome ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of his neglect.

your Servant, that I imagine not my <U+017F>elf to be the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on I was before I <U+017F>aw you. This transformation is wholly to be attributed to your Divinity, and thence you may inferr the influence you have over me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, <hi>Marquina</hi> made an ab<U+017F>olute di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Love; the cunning Gyp<U+017F>ie pretending <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood not his meaning, return'd civil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wers to the proffers he made her, acknowledging her <U+017F>elf extreamly oblig'd to him for his kindne<U+017F>s, and that <U+017F>he doubted not of the performance of what he was pleas'd, out of his own good nature to promi<U+017F>e. By this time, Dinner was <U+017F>et on the Table; they both <U+017F>at down, and the entertainment was very noble, <U+017F>uitable to the Love of the Founder; for where that little Deity comes once to reign, the fir<U+017F>t Act he makes, is for the bani<U+017F>hment of all ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s and avarice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> and <hi>Garay</hi> had agreed together, that he <U+017F>hould come to her, when he were <U+017F>ure the old Merchant was abroad, and that he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf like a Beggar, that he might not be known, nor any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition be conceiv'd of him. She had <U+017F>tudied <U+017F>everal ways to chou<U+017F>e the Merchant of <U+017F>ome part of his Trea<U+017F>ure, but <U+017F>he could not fix on any one <U+017F>he thought might prove effectual, the Chamber where it was Lock'd being extreamly fortify'd. She had continu'd there three days ere <U+017F>he had either <U+017F>een or heard from <hi>Garay,</hi> and during the time, <U+017F>he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>content, as put <hi>Marquina</hi> to much trouble, in regard it kept him from making tho<U+017F>e free di<U+017F>coveries of his Love, which he would otherwi<U+017F>e have done. In the mean time <hi>Rufina,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:58823:31"/>
who watch'd all occa<U+017F>ions, cunningly di<U+017F>cover'd the place where the Old man hid the Keys of his Iron che<U+017F>ts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> went, according to his cu<U+017F>tom, into the City, which being ob<U+017F>erv'd by <hi>Garay,</hi> he comes to his Hou<U+017F>e in Beggars weeds, as they had agreed together, with two Crutches. Being got under the Window, at which <hi>Rufina</hi> was looking out, he begg'd an alms of her. She threw him down <U+017F>omething, and ask'd him whence he came, whereto <hi>Garay</hi> an<U+017F>wering that he was of <hi>Granada,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd to be extreamly glad, and thereupon turning to the Gardener's wife, <q>Let us go down a little into the Garden, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her,</hi> this poor fellow is come out of my Country, I would fain have <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him, to know what news he hath brought thence.</q> The poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting nothing, made no difficulty to let him into the Garden. <hi>Rufina</hi> ask'd him how long it was <U+017F>ince he had left <hi>Granada;</hi> whereto he an<U+017F>wering, about nine or ten days, <U+017F>he continu'd her que<U+017F>tions <U+017F>o long, that the Gardener's wife weary of their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e, and having <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e to do, left them. Being rid of her, they con<U+017F>ider'd what was to be put in execution the night following, and agreed upon the cour<U+017F>e they were to take, to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s them<U+017F>elves of <hi>Marquina</hi>'s Trea<U+017F>ure.</p>
            <p>That done, <hi>Garay</hi> departed, and <hi>Rufina</hi> went up to her Chamber, telling the Gardener's wife, <U+017F>he had under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>o much from that poor fellow, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her affairs, that it would not be long ere <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into her Country. The Gardener's wife, and the Maid were little pleas'd to hear that news, as fearing their Ma<U+017F>ter would, upon her departure, re-a<U+017F><U+017F>ume
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58823:31"/>
his niggardly humour, and keep as mi<U+017F>erable a a hou<U+017F>e as he had done before, nay haply put him<U+017F>elf and all the <U+017F>ervants to a greater penance in their diet, to get up what had been <U+017F>quander'd away, during her aboad there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> being come home found <hi>Rufina</hi> that night more cheerful than at any time before; which gave him the confidence to acquaint her more freely with his love then he had done, and to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her of the di<U+017F>quiet he was in upon her account. <hi>Rufina</hi> <U+017F>eem'd not to take it ami<U+017F>s, nay by a greater famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity then <U+017F>he had expre<U+017F>s'd towards him before, <U+017F>he rais'd in him <U+017F>ome hopes of <U+017F>eeing his de<U+017F>ires <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd: whence the old dotard began to pre<U+017F>ume, that the fort would in a <U+017F>hort time be taken in upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable tearms. Upon this pre<U+017F>umption, he be<U+017F>tow'd on her a Ring, which he had purpo<U+017F>ely bought for her, wherein was a Diamond worth about an hundred crowns, <U+017F>et about with little Rubies. The Lady gave him many thanks for <U+017F>o noble a pre<U+017F>ent, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital promis'd him a Le<U+017F><U+017F>on on the Lute, to which <U+017F>he <U+017F>ung <U+017F>ome new Aires, though <U+017F>he quarrell'd at the dulne<U+017F>s of the In<U+017F>trument. <hi>Marquina</hi> promis'd her a better the next day. They parted for that time, but with different thoughts, <hi>Marquina</hi> de<U+017F>irous to obtain tho<U+017F>e favours he expected from <hi>Rufina,</hi> and to oblige her thereto by pre<U+017F>ents, which overcome the greate<U+017F>t difficulties; and <hi>Rufina</hi> contriving how to compa<U+017F>s the robbery <U+017F>he intended.</p>
            <p>The next day, <hi>Garay</hi> (a per<U+017F>on of great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in <U+017F>uch de<U+017F>igns) got <U+017F>ome others of the <U+017F>ame profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion to carry on the work; and having ob<U+017F>erv'd <hi>Marquina</hi> going into his hou<U+017F>e, they <U+017F>taid till he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58823:32"/>
were gone to bed, which was <U+017F>omewhat late, for <hi>Rufina,</hi> who held a corre<U+017F>pondence with them, had purpo<U+017F>ely kept him up. About midnight, <hi>Garay</hi> and his Camerades brought a thing that had the figure of a man, <U+017F>tuff'd with <U+017F>traw, having about him a cloak, which ca<U+017F>t over his <U+017F>houlder, cover'd his face, and pitch'd it over again<U+017F>t the principal window towards the garden, which was that part of the hou<U+017F>e where <hi>Marquina</hi> lodg'd, and left it there fa<U+017F>tned to a <U+017F>take they had thru<U+017F>t into the ground. The night was <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dark, and <U+017F>o more proper for their de<U+017F>ign. Having plac'd that figure, as I told you, they knock'd at the door <U+017F>o loud that it might have been heard from one end of the Garden to the other. <hi>Marquina</hi> awaken'd thereby leaps out of his bed, it being <U+017F>trange to him to hear <U+017F>uch knocking at his garden door, at <U+017F>uch an un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable time, as being a thing had never happen'd to him before. He call'd up his <U+017F>ervant, and bid him <U+017F>ee who knock'd at the door. The <U+017F>ervant went out between <U+017F>leeping and waking to <U+017F>ee what the matter was, calling as loud as he could, Who knocks there? But no body an<U+017F>wering, and he not minding the figure that <U+017F>tood in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, told his Ma<U+017F>ter that there was not any body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> upon that got into bed again and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd him<U+017F>elf to re<U+017F>t, but it was <U+017F>oon interrupted, for <hi>Garay</hi> knock'd more violently than he had done before, which a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd him the more, and oblig'd him to <U+017F>end down his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n a <U+017F>econd time, to <U+017F>ee what the matter was. Bringing his Ma<U+017F>ter the <U+017F>ame account he had done before, he got up him<U+017F>elf, puts his cloak about him, and calls at the window, Who knocks at my door thus un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably? Whereto no
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58823:32"/>
An<U+017F>wer being made, he grew the more enrag'd; but looking a little more earne<U+017F>tly about the hou<U+017F>e than his man had done, he perceiv'd the figure planted before his windows. <hi>Marquina</hi> was extremely afraid, at the <U+017F>ight of a per<U+017F>on, who, as he thought, knock'd at his door, yet made him no an<U+017F>wer, and a<U+017F><U+017F>uming more courage than he was naturally Ma<U+017F>ter of, he <U+017F>aid to him very loud, <q>'Tis ba<U+017F>ely done of you, Sir, to abu<U+017F>e me thus, you <U+017F>hall find I am not a per<U+017F>on to <U+017F>uffer it; pray keep on your way, and di<U+017F>turb not my re<U+017F>t any more, if you think not your <U+017F>elf invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, and that a brace of good bullets will make no impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in your inchanted skin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having made that bravado he <U+017F>hut to the window and went to bed; but he was hardly got warm in it, ere they began to knock more violently than they had done before; which oblig'd him to take a fire-lock, which he kept always ready charg'd for the <U+017F>ecurity of his mony. Opening the window, he found <U+017F>till in the <U+017F>ame po<U+017F>ture, him, who would not have <U+017F>tirr'd out of it, had he not been forc'd by <U+017F>ome other. What ob<U+017F>tinacy of impudence is it in you, <U+017F>aid he to him, very much incens'd, to do a mi<U+017F>chief, you are nothing the better for, in thus di<U+017F>turbing my re<U+017F>t? 'tis impardonable, and de<U+017F>erves an exemplary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ti<U+017F>ement; be you gone immediately from my door, or I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>end you going the next way. Whereupon cocking the fire-lock, and aiming at him, and the other never <U+017F>tirring, as it were out of a pre<U+017F>umption, that he had not any fire-arms, wherewith he might make good his threats, he gave him notice the third time, that he would not oblige him to do a violence which he was unwilling to do. At la<U+017F>t perceiving he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58823:33"/>
minded not any thing he <U+017F>aid, but as 'twere defi'd him, he re<U+017F>olv'd to give fire, not onely to frighten him, but, if he could, to hurt him. He <U+017F>hot, and the figure fell to the ground, upon which <hi>Garay,</hi> who was not far off, cries out with a doleful tone, <hi>O God, I am kill'd;</hi> and immediately he and his Camerades made a great noi<U+017F>e at the <U+017F>ight of a man <U+017F>o unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately murther'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> was extremely troubled at what he had done, it being ob<U+017F>erv'd, that covetous per<U+017F>ons are for the mo<U+017F>t part cowardly, and extremely fear what-ever may cau<U+017F>e them any lo<U+017F>s. He <U+017F>hut the window, and in a great fright awaking <hi>Rufina</hi> (who had greater things to mind than <U+017F>leeping) told her what he had done. She <U+017F>eem'd to be extremely troubled at it, and much blam'd him, that he had executed <U+017F>o cruel a re<U+017F>olution. For since he knew him<U+017F>elf to be <U+017F>afe enough in his own hou<U+017F>e, he might have <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd them to knock at his door till they had been weary; that he had better endur'd that noi<U+017F>e, and lo<U+017F>t a little of his re<U+017F>t, than be in the trouble he was in, that he had been the cau<U+017F>e of a man's death. She added <U+017F>everal other rea<U+017F>ons, which <U+017F>o confounded poor <hi>Marquina,</hi> that he knew not what to do. She advis'd him for his <U+017F>afety, to go immediately and take refuge in the Mona<U+017F>tery of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if the dead per<U+017F>on were found there the next morning, he would be carried to pri<U+017F>on, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing murther'd <U+017F>o near his hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Marquina</hi> was <U+017F>o perplex'd, that he wi<U+017F>h'd he had never come into the world; and it is to be imagin'd, that if <hi>Rufina</hi> had not been very highly concern'd to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble upon this occa<U+017F>ion, she would have dy'd with laughing. He
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58823:33"/>
rais'd up all his people, and told them what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and all blam'd him, for his being <U+017F>o forward to commit <U+017F>uch an action, which made the poor old dotard almo<U+017F>t mad. He imagin'd him<U+017F>elf already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, his mony carri'd away, and but a <U+017F>mall matter between him and hanging, at lea<U+017F>t if he were oblig'd by tortures to acknowledge his crime, never con<U+017F>idering that it was pardonable for one man to kill another in his own defence. At la<U+017F>t, he re<U+017F>olv'd to go to S. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s; but knew not how to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of his mony. He thought it no prudence to leave it at the di<U+017F>cretion of his Servants; to carry it to a friend's hou<U+017F>e (in ca<U+017F>e he had any, for per<U+017F>ons of his humour have very few) he had not time. In this di<U+017F>traction he de<U+017F>ir'd <hi>Rufina</hi> to advi<U+017F>e him; <U+017F>he <U+017F>eeming very much troubled, and no le<U+017F>s fearful than he, pretended <U+017F>he could not give him any; but after a little pau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he gave him that advice, which <U+017F>he had prepar'd long before, and he follow'd it. She ask'd him what mony he might have in the hou<U+017F>e?

This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ideration forc'd from him not onely tears, but al<U+017F>o bitter exclamations again<U+017F>t the malicious cro<U+017F>sne<U+017F>s of his fortune. <hi>Rufina</hi> de<U+017F>ir'd him to be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, per<U+017F>uading him to do as <U+017F>he advis'd him, and hope the be<U+017F>t. So that having commanded all his <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to go to their <U+017F>everal chambers, and not to <U+017F>tir thence, he and <hi>Rufina,</hi> whom onely he dur<U+017F>t tru<U+017F>t, went to the place where the mony was. It lay in a huge che<U+017F>t, cover'd all over with iron-bars, and the keys were <U+017F>o extraordinary, that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to counterfeit them, or to get a piece thence by any other wile than what was invented by our <U+017F>ubtil Ferret.</p>
            <p>They fir<U+017F>t took out all the <U+017F>ilver, and then put the gold into a little box, and, having brought all into the garden, they made two holes, at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance one from the other, in one whereof they put the <U+017F>ilver, and in the other, the gold, <U+017F>etting a mark that they might find the places again. <hi>Marquina</hi> took along with him two hundred crowns in gold, and gave <hi>Rufina</hi> fifty, to <U+017F>hift for her <U+017F>elf, till the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s were accommodated.</p>
            <p>That done, they went up into the hou<U+017F>e, whence they might <U+017F>ee <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons walking with a light;

'twas <hi>Garay</hi> and his camerades, who repre<U+017F>ented the Magi<U+017F>trate, which <hi>Rufina</hi> <U+017F>hewing him, advis'd him to make all the ha<U+017F>te he could to St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s. To do that, they got over the garden wall, as being afraid to open the door, for they perceiv'd the actors of this comedy kept a watch there, with <U+017F>uch authority, as if they had really been the Officers of Ju<U+017F>tice. All <hi>Marquina</hi>'s family follow'd him over the wall, fearing they might come into trouble for their Ma<U+017F>ter's fault. <hi>Marquina</hi> and his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s lurk'd <U+017F>omewhere thereabouts, till it was day, that they might have the Church-door open, to get into the Mona<U+017F>tery. <hi>Garay</hi> was hard by, to <U+017F>ee what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of <hi>Marquina</hi> and his people. Finding he had left his hou<U+017F>e, and got into the Mona<U+017F>tery with <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina,</hi> he went about an hour after Sun-ri<U+017F>ing to St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s, in the habit of a Secular Prie<U+017F>t, that he might the better <U+017F>peak to <hi>Rufina.</hi> She told him how things <U+017F>tood, and how they had buried the mony in the garden, and that it was all in <U+017F>ilver, intending to re<U+017F>erve all the gold for her <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>About mid-night <hi>Garay</hi> and one of his Camerades went along with <hi>Rufina,</hi> di<U+017F>guiz'd in man's cloaths, to the garden. They help'd her over fir<U+017F>t, to go and <U+017F>ee whether there might be any body in the hou<U+017F>e, but all were vani<U+017F>h'd as if the hou<U+017F>e had been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ited. She thereupon call'd <hi>Garay</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and, having taken up the mony, they carri'd it away, and took up their quarters at one of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<U+017F>t Inns of the <U+017F>uburbs. Having been merry a while, and drunk their own healths, and to the good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of their future de<U+017F>igns, they went all to bed, the two men together, and <hi>Rufina</hi> by her <U+017F>elf. As <U+017F>oon as she

found they were a<U+017F>leep, <U+017F>he puts on the <U+017F>ame habit, and returns to the garden. She took up the little box of gold, and, without any di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter, got <U+017F>afe to the Inn before her companions awaked.</p>
            <p>The next day, having divided the <U+017F>ilver, whereof <U+017F>he and <hi>Garay</hi> had the be<U+017F>t part, and <U+017F>ew'd up the gold in her cloaths, <U+017F>he left <hi>Sevit,</hi> taking <hi>Garay</hi> along with her, who, finding what advantages he might make of her company, re<U+017F>olv'd to run fortunes with her. They took their way towards <hi>Madrid,</hi> to which place they will be got, by that time we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee what is become of <hi>Marquina,</hi> whom we left in St. <hi>Bernard's</hi> Mona<U+017F>tery.</p>
            <p>Having continu'd there four days after <hi>Rufina's</hi> departure from him, he knew not what to think of her that <U+017F>he came not again, as <U+017F>he had promis'd. He addre<U+017F>s'd him<U+017F>elf to one of the Monks, who had great acquaintances in the City, and intreated him to inquire what proceedings there might be again<U+017F>t him, upon the murther he had committed. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man promis'd him an account of it; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enquir'd at tho<U+017F>e places where he might mo<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably hear thereof, no body could give him any <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. He thereupon told <hi>Marquina,</hi> that he might <U+017F>afely go abroad and needed not to fear any thing. He went out one night to a friend's of his, whom he acquainted with all that had pa<U+017F>t, as al<U+017F>o the great perplexity he was in, de<U+017F>iring him to make a more particular enquiry into the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, than he thought the Religious man had done. He did <U+017F>o, and gave him the <U+017F>ame account as the other. Yet would not that <U+017F>atisfie him, but he mu<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire his friend to go to his hou<U+017F>e, whereof he gave him the Mi<U+017F>tris key.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58823:35"/>
He went, and found it without any body in it, and his Mule dead, for want of meat and tendance. He went with this news to his friend, advi<U+017F>ing him to come out of the Mona<U+017F>tery, and go home, and thence about the City, as he was wont to do. The death of his Mule troubled him not much, <U+017F>o glad was he to find him<U+017F>elf once more at liberty: the onely thing gave him any di<U+017F>quiet, was, that his <hi>Theodora</hi> (under which name <hi>Rufina</hi> went) came not to <U+017F>ee him. But he imagin'd the cau<U+017F>e of it might be, that, being a young Maid, <U+017F>he had <U+017F>helter'd her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome-where, to keep out of the hands of Ju<U+017F>tice, or that haply <U+017F>he might have been met with by her Father, who, as <U+017F>he had told him, <U+017F>ought after her. He went to his hou<U+017F>e, whither came <U+017F>oon after the Gardener and his wife, and the other <U+017F>ervants. He goes into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and, notwith<U+017F>tanding all the fear and di<U+017F>traction he had been in, remembred the place where he had hid his mony, and was not a little glad to find the mark where he had <U+017F>et it; <U+017F>o that before he went to bed, he re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>ecure his trea<U+017F>ure in its former gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>on. As <U+017F>oon as it was dark, he takes the Gardener with him, and a Lanthorn and Candle, and goes fir<U+017F>t to the place where the Silver was, and bids him digg. He did <U+017F>o, but there was nothing to be found, whereat <hi>Marquina</hi> was extremely <U+017F>urpriz'd. He went thence to the place where they had laid the gold, and there they found as little, onely <hi>Rufina</hi> knew what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all. He walk'd <U+017F>everal turns about the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with much vexation, imagining the marks might be mi<U+017F>plac'd; but what in looking after the marks, and what in digging; the night <U+017F>lipp'd away, <U+017F>o that at la<U+017F>t di<U+017F>pairing to find any thing that night, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58823:36"/>
him<U+017F>elf like a per<U+017F>on di<U+017F>tracted. The Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner knew not what he look'd for, nor for what rea<U+017F>on he had brought him thither. The poor man re<U+017F>olv'd to have a little patience till the next morning, being <U+017F>till in <U+017F>ome hope to find what he had hidden. He went to bed, or rather to <U+017F>pend the night in un<U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable torments: but as <U+017F>oon as it began to dawn, he got up, and having call'd up the Gardener, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the work they had been at the night before. Having digg'd again at tho<U+017F>e places, where he was confident he had laid the mony, all they could find was, that there had been two holes made there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that mony or <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e had been hidden there, but all was remov'd. This a<U+017F><U+017F>urance made him run <U+017F>tark mad, throwing him<U+017F>elf on the ground, running his head again<U+017F>t the wall, and doing <U+017F>uch things as rais'd a compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in his <U+017F>ervants, who thence concluded that he had lo<U+017F>t his mony, and <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pected the feign'd <hi>Theodora,</hi> to have robb'd him, by the orders he gave them to <U+017F>earch after her all over the City. But <U+017F>he was far enough out of his reach, and had <U+017F>o wel <U+017F>ecur'd his mony, that it was not likely it would come into his che<U+017F>ts any more.

which are look'd on as <U+017F>o many miracles, by tho<U+017F>e who are Judges in that kind of writing? The excellency of her Pro<U+017F>e, and the <U+017F>ubtilty of the de<U+017F>igns, together with the in<U+017F>inuating intertexture of the Ver<U+017F>es, have given mate to the be<U+017F>t Pens of <hi>Spain.

                        <p>'Tis a cu<U+017F>tom in <hi>Valentia,</hi> that at the beginning of the Spring, for the <U+017F>pace of about fifteen days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mo<U+017F>t of the families of the City go about the Silk-husbandry, which they have in the adjacent Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages. One day, Don <hi>Alexander</hi> rid abroad into the Country, through that delightful Plain which is near a Garden not far from <hi>Valentia,</hi> known by the name of the Mona<U+017F>tery of our <hi>Lady of Hope,</hi> and having <U+017F>pent the whole afternoon about tho<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, refre<U+017F>hing him<U+017F>elf with the <U+017F>weet <U+017F>cent of the flowers of the Orenge-trees, whereof there is good <U+017F>tore thereabouts, (the Sun being <U+017F>o low that it <U+017F>eem'd to be equally divided between us and our Antipodes) he pa<U+017F>s'd by a Country hou<U+017F>e not far from the plea<U+017F>ant River of <hi>Turia,</hi> where he heard, at a <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>tance, one playing on a Lute, <U+017F>o well, that he thought he had not heard any Mu<U+017F>ick comparable to it before. He <U+017F>topp'd his hor<U+017F>e, imagining the per<U+017F>on playing on that In<U+017F>trument <U+017F>o excellently might al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ing to it.

In the mean time night came on, and Don <hi>Alexander</hi> extremely delighted with the place he was in, gave his hor<U+017F>e to his Lacquey, and cau<U+017F>ing him to remove a little di<U+017F>tance off, he <U+017F>taid alone, under the green Balcony, whence the Mu<U+017F>ick came, to find out who made it. But he had not waited long, ere he could perceive, by the light of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58823:41"/>
the Moon, that it was a Lady, who being got into that Balcony to take the advantage of a gentle wind then blowing, began afre<U+017F>h her delightful Mu<U+017F>ick on the Lute, whereto <U+017F>he join'd that of an admirable voice, <U+017F>inging an Air, which made an ab<U+017F>olute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t of that Heart, wherein all the hard<U+017F>hips of War had not made the lea<U+017F>t breach. Whence we may deduce this Remark, That <hi>Cupid</hi> can do more in a minute, than <hi>Mars,</hi> in a <hi>Troy-</hi><U+017F>iege.</p>
                        <p>To <U+017F>ay the <U+017F>ame thing again in other words, The excellency of the Voice, and the tran<U+017F>cendent nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene<U+017F>s of the hand, the compliance and competition between them, <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>h'd our young Gallant, that he wi<U+017F>h'd <U+017F>he might never give over, at lea<U+017F>t not till he were <U+017F>atiated with that plea<U+017F>ure. But the Lady laid by her In<U+017F>trument, and leaning her brea<U+017F>t on the Balcony, though 'twere night, made a <U+017F>hift to <U+017F>ee the young Gallant, whom her Mu<U+017F>ick had ti'd <U+017F>o long by the ears; who al<U+017F>o perceiving her, would needs make his advantage of <U+017F>o ble<U+017F>t an opportunity. So that get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as near her as he could, he broke forth into this Complement: <q>How infinitely happy mu<U+017F>t that ab<U+017F>ent Gentleman be, Madam, (for in the Ver<U+017F>es <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ung, <U+017F>he bemoan'd the ab<U+017F>ence of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain per<U+017F>on) who de<U+017F>erves <U+017F>o excellent a voice to bemoan his ab<U+017F>ence.

                        <p>The Lady wondred to find her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>urpriz'd, but recovering out of her a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, though <U+017F>he knew not the per<U+017F>on who had <U+017F>poken to her, <U+017F>he gave him this An<U+017F>wer. <q>As to the Song you heard, Sir, you

                        <p>Thus was <hi>Alexander</hi> fully inform'd of all he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ir'd to know, though he had already had a particular accompt of the perfections which made the City of <hi>Valentia</hi> full of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of her Beauty and Wit, which was <U+017F>uch that <U+017F>he had the reputation of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting good Ver<U+017F>es, a quality very recommendable in a per<U+017F>on of her Sex and Quality. <hi>Alexander</hi> had never <U+017F>een her, and was very de<U+017F>irous to do it, even before he had <U+017F>een her; and under<U+017F>tanding <U+017F>he Liv'd at that Country-hou<U+017F>e, his de<U+017F>ire was the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd: which made him Ride abroad the oftner, hoping to be favour'd with <U+017F>uch another opportunity as he had met with before. But he had not that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F>s a good while, her Aunt being <U+017F>o <U+017F>ick, that <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>tir out of the room where <U+017F>he lay. About fifteen days afterwards, the old Gentlewoman being

a little recover'd, <U+017F>he had the liberty to go and <U+017F>ee the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a Nun, at the Royal Mona<U+017F>tery of <hi>Zaida,</hi> which was not far from the Country-hou<U+017F>e: At which Ceremony all the Gallantry of <hi>Valentia,</hi> of both Sexes, was pre<U+017F>ent. <hi>Donna I<U+017F>abella</hi> came thither al<U+017F>o, but having her face cover'd with her Mantle, and attended onely by one of her Women, <U+017F>he got into a little ob<U+017F>cure Chappel.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alexander,</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, who fail'd not to be there, hoping to meet her, on whom he had fa<U+017F>ten'd his affections, wondred very much that he found her not among the other Ladies; and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting <U+017F>he might be one of tho<U+017F>e who were retir'd into that Chappel, and had their faces cover'd with their Mantles, he went in to them, with two other friends, to whom he <U+017F>aid, (pre<U+017F>uming it was <U+017F>he as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw her) <q>The new-made Nun is not much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to the<U+017F>e Ladies, who retire to a place, whence they cannot <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e Ceremonies, which all the re<U+017F>t are <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to do: but I attribute this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to the little inclination they have to become Nuns.</q>
                           <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> was not a little pleas'd to <U+017F>ee <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom <U+017F>he had before ob<U+017F>erv'd in the Church, and wi<U+017F>h'd not <U+017F>o well attended as he then was.

                        <p>Upon that every one began to celebrate his own worth, and undervalue his Competitors.

The per<U+017F>on I mean hath many excellent qualities, but the particular inducement I have to think him worthy my approbation, is, that I know him to be a very great Wit; all I have to object again<U+017F>t him, is, that he fears I am already engag'd to <U+017F>ome other, whence I infer he is jealous, and con<U+017F>equently of an ill nature.</q>

                                 <hi>I</hi> See then, Madam, <U+017F>o that you procure your own <U+017F>atisfaction, you care not what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences I may run into; <U+017F>ince that to be more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in your prai<U+017F>es (as you <U+017F>eem to de<U+017F>ire) cannot be without <U+017F>o much the greater prejudice to my reputation, in that I think my <U+017F>elf far <U+017F>hort of tran<U+017F>cendency, in that particular, and I am forc'd to bring in the exce<U+017F>s of my Love, to <U+017F>upply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of my Poetry. That I may therefore be no more guilty of <U+017F>uch a crime, I will henceforth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf in Pro<U+017F>e, and in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure do what you command me in your Letter. You would find it no great difficulty to believe me, if you knew what I feel; nay though out of mode<U+017F>ty you pretend to be ignorant of it, I defie you to do it, unle<U+017F>s withal you re<U+017F>olve never to con<U+017F>ult your Gla<U+017F>s any more. Well, Madam, it may be the time of your conver<U+017F>ion is not yet come, when it <U+017F>hall, your eyes will be opened, and you <U+017F>hall find, that, of all the

Time, which gives all things their birth, perfection, and period, <U+017F>hall be the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, to try whether this be Truth or Fiction; nay I leave it to the <U+017F>ame old Gentleman to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you of a thing, you yet pretend to be ignorant of, which is, that, while I live, you <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>ole Sovereign Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s and Directre<U+017F>s of my Inclinations. And then haply good nature, gratitude, and genero<U+017F>ity will rather advi<U+017F>e you to acknowledgements of the love I bear you, than a re<U+017F>entment of the injuries you charge me withal.</p>

                        <p>This Letter gave <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> that <U+017F>atisfaction concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her new Gallant, which <U+017F>he expected. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent vi<U+017F>its were continu'd of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <U+017F>ide, and the Epi<U+017F>tolary corre<U+017F>pondence on both <U+017F>ides: <U+017F>o that the inclinations they had one to another were, by the<U+017F>e degrees, heightned into a noble flame of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love. His Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s commanded him above all things to keep his preten<U+017F>ions to her very <U+017F>ecret, which he inviolably promis'd to do. Nay <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>crupulous as to that particular, that if in the Church, or <U+017F>ome other publick place, her Gallant did <U+017F>o much as ca<U+017F>t his Eye on her, in the company of <U+017F>ome friend, <U+017F>he immediately imagin'd, that he acquainted him with his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and, as if <U+017F>he had heard all their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he fail'd not to <U+017F>end him a Letter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, if <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>ee him time enough, that he might receive her reproaches him<U+017F>elf. <hi>Alexander</hi>
                           <pb n="86" facs="tcp:58823:48"/>
clear'd him<U+017F>elf the be<U+017F>t he could, <U+017F>till a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her of the contrary; and enflam'd with love and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all he could do was to di<U+017F>pel that diffidence, which troubled him extremely. But the <U+017F>ame Love, which is wont to reconcile the le<U+017F><U+017F>er differences and di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfactions that happen between Lovers, helps them al<U+017F>o out of the greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t difficult. 'Twas <hi>Alexander</hi>'s de<U+017F>ign to marry this Lady, though her fortunes were very low: but he delay'd the doing of it, till he had effected a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s he was then engag'd to pro<U+017F>ecute. His Uncle and him<U+017F>elf had done the King very con<U+017F>iderable <U+017F>ervices in <hi>Flanders,</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years together, and he was then making his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to his Maje<U+017F>ty for <U+017F>ome Command in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<U+017F>ation thereof. And the ob<U+017F>tructions and delays he met with in that affair contributed more to his after-happine<U+017F>s, than the expedition could have done, as will appear anon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> had taken order that he <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>een in the <U+017F>treet where <U+017F>he liv'd, much le<U+017F>s look up to her window to be <U+017F>een by her, and it was punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ob<U+017F>erv'd by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was not known to have given her a meeting any where. But <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf was the fir<U+017F>t forgot what <U+017F>he had enjoin'd; it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd thus. During the time of the Carnaval, which, in <hi>Valentia,</hi> is celebrated with Ma<U+017F>carades, Balls, Tiltings and Di<U+017F>guizes, <hi>Alexander</hi> had in <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e met with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, yet without di<U+017F>covery of more than ordinary kindne<U+017F>s between them, though they had talk'd, and danc'd together. One evening, after the Ball, there was to be a meeting of certain Ladies, at the hou<U+017F>e of a Friend of <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi>'s, to which <U+017F>he with <U+017F>ome others had been
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58823:48"/>
invited. <hi>Alexander</hi> and <U+017F>ome other friends of his were to be there, not in order to any Ball, but onely to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> came there betimes before any of the re<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>oon after her a Woman, very <U+017F>umptuou<U+017F>ly attir'd, attended by two Gentlemen-U<U+017F>hers of her own retinue, whom her mother had ordered to wait on her to that Neighbour's hou<U+017F>e, who was very much her friend. <hi>Alexander</hi> coming into the Room, was very kindly receiv'd by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies then pre<U+017F>ent, whom he endeavour'd to entertain the mo<U+017F>t lovingly he could, till the re<U+017F>t of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were come in. The Lady who came in la<U+017F>t ri<U+017F>e from her <U+017F>eat to go and look upon a piece of Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>try, that was in the room, wherein there were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ented lighted Torches; the admiration <U+017F>he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s'd at the excellency of the workman<U+017F>hip, oblig'd <hi>Alexander</hi> to come al<U+017F>o to <U+017F>ee it. There was pen, ink and paper upon the Table; <hi>Laodamia</hi> (<U+017F>o was the Lady call'd) took the pen in her hand, and drew <U+017F>everal <U+017F>troaks upon the paper; <hi>Alexander</hi> took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion to commend all <U+017F>he did with <U+017F>uch high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, that his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who was already po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd with a jealou<U+017F>ie, to <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>o near her, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t ready to bur<U+017F>t with indignation to hear them. He, minding onely his own diver<U+017F>ion in all he did, took no notice of it; nay on the contrary, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Laodamia,</hi> through her Brother's means, whom he often vi<U+017F>ited, and a per<U+017F>on of much freedom in his behaviour, he continu'd his game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome humour, and <U+017F>natch'd out of her hand a pen <U+017F>he was making to write withal. After which, having da<U+017F>h'd a little ink upon her hand, he je<U+017F>tingly told her, that the blackne<U+017F>s of the ink never appear'd le<U+017F>s
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58823:49"/>
than it did then. She pretending to be di<U+017F>pleas'd at that freedom, gave him a clap on the <U+017F>houlder with her hand, to get off the ink; but perceiving he laugh'd at the revenge <U+017F>he had taken, <U+017F>he gave him another harder than the former. <hi>I<U+017F>abella,</hi> who minded their jea<U+017F>ting more than what was <U+017F>aid to her by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of the hou<U+017F>e, (with whom <U+017F>he was then di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>ing) <U+017F>tarts like a fury from her <U+017F>eat, and not con<U+017F>idering what <U+017F>he was doing, gave <hi>Alexander</hi> <U+017F>uch a blow over the face, that his no<U+017F>e bled. The poor man was extremely <U+017F>tartled at it, and all he could do was to take a handkerchief out of his pocket, to receive the bloud; telling his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, very coldly, <q>Well, Madam, you <U+017F>ee, I have kept the <U+017F>ecret you committed to my tru<U+017F>t; you have fir<U+017F>t reveal'd it, and tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F>s'd the Law you had made your <U+017F>elf.</q> Concluding this reproach with a low Congy, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Room, and went home.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner given the blow, but <U+017F>he was infinitely troubled at it, not <U+017F>o much out of the re<U+017F>pect <U+017F>he bore to the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of the hou<U+017F>e, who was her intimate friend, as for her, who had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion'd her jealou<U+017F>ie. In this Interval, her Si<U+017F>ters, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who<U+017F>e accompt this meeting had been appointed, coming into the hou<U+017F>e, <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> had the opportunity to retire with her friends into another room.</p>
                        <p>Being got together, onely they two, <q>My deare<U+017F>t <hi>I<U+017F>abella, <U+017F>ays her friend to her,</hi> what do you think of?

                           <hi>Alexander</hi> was, that night, not onely very <U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous in his habiliments, but al<U+017F>o full of excellent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, in<U+017F>omuch that there were few Ladies in the company, who were not much taken with him, among whom <hi>Laodamia</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t concern'd of any. Her thoughts were full of what had hapned between her and <hi>I<U+017F>abella,</hi> and <U+017F>hew was now re<U+017F>olv'd to u<U+017F>e all the artifices <U+017F>he could, to get away that Gallant from her: wherein at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he had her de<U+017F>ire, as <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>een anon.</p>

                        <p>This Gallant of hers, who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand Corella,</hi> had made a journey to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecute a Sute at Law again<U+017F>t the Count of <hi>Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayna,</hi> his Uncle, for a con<U+017F>iderable E<U+017F>tate in Lands, which at la<U+017F>t was decided in the Sovereign Council of <hi>Arragon.</hi> He was return'd to <hi>Valentia,</hi> with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to put him into po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the <U+017F>aid E<U+017F>tate,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58823:51"/>
which amounted to two thou<U+017F>and Crowns <hi>per annum. I<U+017F>abella</hi> was extremely put to her <U+017F>hifts, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould keep in with both the<U+017F>e Gallants, and <U+017F>atisfie them at the <U+017F>ame time. She con<U+017F>ider'd that her Honour was engag'd with <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> and her Love with <hi>Alexander:</hi> her affection being <U+017F>o much the more heightned towards the latter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital of his a<U+017F><U+017F>iduous attendances, as it was remitted towards the former, by rea<U+017F>on of his ab<U+017F>ence. So that it is as much a miracle to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome Women for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their engagements, (when they to whom they are made are once out of <U+017F>ight) and mind onely the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent enjoyments, as to <U+017F>ee Gee<U+017F>e go barefoot.</p>
                        <p>But as drowning per<U+017F>ons will catch at any thing, and the di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s'd are commonly glad of any advice. This Lady, whom we repre<U+017F>ented before one of the greate<U+017F>t Wits of her Nation, reduc'd to this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, mu<U+017F>t needs advi<U+017F>e with a Maid, who<U+017F>e fidelity and <U+017F>ecrecie <U+017F>he had great a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of, re<U+017F>olving in her <U+017F>elf to find out <U+017F>ome expedient, whereby <U+017F>he might make <U+017F>ure of the one and not lo<U+017F>e the other. She receiv'd <hi>Don Fernand</hi> into the Hou<U+017F>e, in the night, thinking <U+017F>he could not civilly deny him the reiteration of a kindne<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had once granted him; and <U+017F>he kept the other in hand with Love-letters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him not to <U+017F>ee her as often as he de<U+017F>ir'd, as well to add fuel to his love, as that the other, whom <U+017F>he was more oblig'd to favour, might have the freer acce<U+017F>s. Her excu<U+017F>e to <hi>Alexander</hi> was, that <U+017F>he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not over-<U+017F>eers, that her friends were very <U+017F>hie in point of Honour, that one of them watch'd her day and night, and that the greate<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ure he could do her, was, to forbear pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the <U+017F>treet where
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58823:52"/>
<U+017F>he liv'd, till <U+017F>he had a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him that the coa<U+017F>t were clear. <hi>Alexander</hi> who really lov'd her, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected nothing of the impo<U+017F>ture, ea<U+017F>ily credited all <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, and punctually obey'd her.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was willing to require the kindne<U+017F>s he had receiv'd from her, by marrying her; but having a mother alive who would not have been well pleas'd with that marriage, he took occa<U+017F>ion to put it off, hoping it would not be long ere <U+017F>he were remov'd out of the way, as being very ancient. So that he pa<U+017F>s'd away the time very jocundly with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, while <U+017F>he, by her cunning in<U+017F>inuations and artifices, endeavour'd to bring <hi>Alexander</hi> into a fool's para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<U+017F>e, and make him believe all proceeded from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                        <p>There hapned about this time a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Alexander</hi> and another Gentleman, of the mo<U+017F>t eminent about the City, who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Don Garceran,</hi> as they were playing at Tennis. Some Friends interpos'd between them, and 'twas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd they were made friends; but the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prov'd <U+017F>uch as neither was <U+017F>atisfi'd. <hi>Alexander</hi> was a per<U+017F>on of a generous open nature, grounding his gallantry on the emploiments he had had in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and imagining that no man, having any thing to <U+017F>ay to him, would do it otherwi<U+017F>e than by the ways of Honour. But his Adver<U+017F>ary, conceiving he had more rea<U+017F>on to be offended than the other, who had not expre<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>o much re<U+017F>entment, <U+017F>mother'd his malice, in hopes of an opportunity, wherein he might revenge him<U+017F>elf with advantage.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was gone to a certain place in the Country, where he <U+017F>taid three or four days. <hi>I<U+017F>abella,</hi>
                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:58823:52"/>
who had a great kindne<U+017F>s for <hi>Alexander,</hi> <U+017F>ent him word to come to her hou<U+017F>e in the night, but <U+017F>o <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and with <U+017F>uch caution that none might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, ina<U+017F>much as the freedom <U+017F>he gave him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd her reputation in the highe<U+017F>t degree. The Amorous Cavalier obey'd her in this, as he had done in many other things <U+017F>he had commanded him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither at <U+017F>uch hours as it was not likely any <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee him. Thus, by his credulity he promoted the de<U+017F>igns of the <U+017F>ubtil woman, who would craftily make the mo<U+017F>t of both her Gallants, <U+017F>o that, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their being jealous of one another, nay, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were Rivals, <U+017F>he gull'd them both. Had <U+017F>he been free to make her own choice, no doubt, <U+017F>he would have pitch'd upon <hi>Alexander</hi> for her Husband. But <hi>Fernand</hi> being aforehand with her, <U+017F>he could do no le<U+017F>s, though 'twere onely out of a fear to lo<U+017F>e him, and prevent the reproaches he might make her, than keep him <U+017F>till in play, and expect the performance of the promi<U+017F>e he had made to marry her, as <U+017F>oon as his Mother were march'd off. But out of an apprehen<U+017F>ion that even then he might po<U+017F><U+017F>iblv break his word with her, <U+017F>he thought it prudence, to give <hi>Alexander</hi> al<U+017F>o a little more line. Upon the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffer'd her <U+017F>elf to be courted by both: but of this kind of demeanor this Age affords but too many examples, which have bred great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and di<U+017F>turbances in the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alexander</hi> being now more kindly entertain'd by his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s than he had been, began to conceive a hope to obtain of her, within a <U+017F>hort time, the Grand Favour can be expected from a Woman. But he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58823:53"/>
reckon'd without his Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s; for it was her fear, that, if <U+017F>he oblig'd him in what he <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ir'd, he might become ab<U+017F>olute Ma<U+017F>ter of tho<U+017F>e inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o dextrou<U+017F>ly divided between them both. However <hi>Alexander</hi> pa<U+017F>s'd away the time plea<U+017F>antly enough, during the ab<U+017F>ence of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand;</hi> but as <U+017F>oon as he was return'd to <hi>Valentia, I<U+017F>abella</hi> began to put on a greater re<U+017F>erv'dne<U+017F>s, and would not be <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>een by <hi>Alexander.</hi> She made him <U+017F>uch plau<U+017F>ible excu<U+017F>es for it, that he, lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her as he did, believ'd all <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, though not without <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, that there might be <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what el<U+017F>e in the wind: upon which account he often di<U+017F>guis'd him<U+017F>elf, that he might, undi<U+017F>cover'd, vi<U+017F>it the <U+017F>treet where <U+017F>he liv'd in the night. But he never could meet with any per<U+017F>on, of whom he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any jealou<U+017F>ie; yet that di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e did him a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>ie; for by that means he e<U+017F>cap'd being di<U+017F>cover'd by the Cavalier who <U+017F>ought to be reveng'd of him. That he met not with <hi>Fernand</hi> in that <U+017F>treet, proceeded hence, that <hi>I<U+017F>abella,</hi> fore-<U+017F>eeing all inconveniences, had ordered, that <hi>Fernand</hi> <U+017F>hould come to her hou<U+017F>e, through that of a She-friend of hers, which was in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <U+017F>treet, and had a back-door, leading into a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den joining unto <hi>I<U+017F>abella's,</hi> in who<U+017F>e embraces he <U+017F>pent the whole night.</p>
                        <p>It hapned, one night, that <hi>Alexander</hi> being in the <U+017F>treet where his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s liv'd, his Adver<U+017F>ary, <hi>Don Garceran,</hi> attended by two of his <U+017F>ervants, comes into it by another way. Being not well a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd it was he, they follow'd him at a di<U+017F>tance, being loath to do another that mi<U+017F>chief which they onely intended him. <hi>Alexander</hi> at la<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erv'd them, and finding

him<U+017F>elf unfurni<U+017F>h'd with Pi<U+017F>tols, to deal with per<U+017F>ons who never went without them, as having onely his Sword to defend him<U+017F>elf, he bethought him to make the <U+017F>ignal he was wont at <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi>'s door, who, as good luck would have it, was come down <U+017F>tairs, after <U+017F>he had put <hi>Fernand</hi> into bed. She looks out at the window, to <U+017F>ee what her <U+017F>econd Gallant would have, who, as <U+017F>oon as he perceiv'd her, de<U+017F>ir'd her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to open the door, otherwi<U+017F>e he was a dead man, in regard <hi>Garceran,</hi> his enemy, follow'd him, and he was de<U+017F>titute of weapons to defend him<U+017F>elf. The Lady imagin'd that <hi>Alexander</hi> would onely have put a trick upon her, and onely <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, that he might come in the <U+017F>ooner: but <hi>Alexander,</hi> with many oaths, affirm'd he <U+017F>aid nothing but the truth, and that <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceran,</hi> with two others, were coming upon him. <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> was extremely troubled at his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and for an<U+017F>wer, told him, that a certain Gentlewoman of her acquaintance was come to <U+017F>ee her, and to be her Bedfellow that night, and that <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not open the door, le<U+017F>t he might be <U+017F>een by her. <hi>Alexander</hi> pre<U+017F>s'd her the more to do it, aggravating the danger he was in, and charging her that <U+017F>he had little love for him, when <U+017F>he deni'd him entrance into her hou<U+017F>e in <U+017F>o great an extremity, which the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>tranger in the world would not have deni'd him. <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> told him again, that <U+017F>he could not do it without prejudice to her reputation; that as to the Love <U+017F>he bore him, be needed not doubt of it, <U+017F>ince it could not be greater than it was, and call'd Heaven to witne<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>he was extremely perplex'd, that <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>atisfie his de<U+017F>ires. <hi>Alexander</hi> told her, that <U+017F>ince her friend was in a room above-<U+017F>tairs,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58823:54"/>
<U+017F>he might without any <U+017F>cruple open the door, and let him <U+017F>tay below, till <U+017F>uch time as he might retire with <U+017F>afety.</p>
                        <p>

To be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd whether it were <U+017F>o or no, <U+017F>he look'd into the Street, and <U+017F>aw the three Men who pur<U+017F>u'd him, and whi<U+017F>pering one to another, as being in <U+017F>ome uncertainty whether it were the Per<U+017F>on they look'd for. The<U+017F>e circum<U+017F>tances fully <U+017F>atisfy'd her, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was in very great danger; and to find <U+017F>ome expedient to give him entrance, <U+017F>he bid him expect a little and <U+017F>he would <U+017F>ee whether <U+017F>he could open the door. She went up <U+017F>tairs to <U+017F>ee <hi>Fernand,</hi> who, wondring at her <U+017F>tay, ask'd her what occa<U+017F>ion'd her going down. She told him her Aunt was not fallen a<U+017F>leep, and that <U+017F>he could not come to Bed, till <U+017F>he were, de<U+017F>iring him to have a little patience.</p>
                        <p>Having thus <U+017F>atisfy'd him, <U+017F>he went into another room, to con<U+017F>ider with her <U+017F>elf what might be done in <U+017F>uch an extremity. On the one <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <hi>Fernand</hi> po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of her Bed, a per<U+017F>on of a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<U+017F>tick humour, yet one whom <U+017F>he was engag'd to, and had made Ma<U+017F>ter of the mo<U+017F>t precious thing <U+017F>he had, and <U+017F>till humour'd out of a hope to be one day his Wife; <U+017F>o that her Honour was on his part.

For if <U+017F>he did, <U+017F>he reflected that her reputation would be endanger'd two ways; one, that it could not be done without <hi>Fernand</hi>'s hearing of it, who would thence take occa<U+017F>ion to break his promi<U+017F>e; another, that if <hi>Alexander</hi> were pur<U+017F>u'd by his Enemy, and that he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee him come into her hou<U+017F>e, he would be apt to make an ill con<U+017F>truction of it, and that might come to the ears of <hi>Fernand,</hi> even though he <U+017F>aw him not.</p>
                        <p>Having thus re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>tick to the <U+017F>urer <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he went down <U+017F>tairs, and finding <hi>Alexander</hi> <U+017F>till at the door, <q>My deare<U+017F>t Love, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, Heaven's my witne<U+017F>s, how willing I am to <U+017F>atisfie your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ires, by giving you entrance, not onely into my hou<U+017F>e, but even into my heart, which is ab<U+017F>olutely at your di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al. I <U+017F>ee you are pur<U+017F>u'd, as you told me, but it were too great an inconvenience to me, that you <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een coming into my hou<U+017F>e at <U+017F>uch an un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable hour, being a per<U+017F>on yet <U+017F>o unblemi<U+017F>h'd in my reputation as I am.

Be<U+017F>ides my Friend, who is my Bed-fellow this night, is awake, and, as Women are extreamly inqui<U+017F>itive, <U+017F>he will be de<U+017F>irous to know the occa<U+017F>ion of my <U+017F>tay, and who hath kept me <U+017F>o long from her, for there is a very great familiarity between us. Pardon me therefore, that I cannot grant your de<U+017F>ire; it is the greate<U+017F>t affliction ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to me, that I mu<U+017F>t leave you in <U+017F>uch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58823:55"/>
but reflecting on that of my reputation, I know you would not have me to hazard it, <U+017F>ince I doubt not but you are <U+017F>o generous, as to prefer my Honour before your own Life.</q>

                        <p>This unworthy treatment of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, in <U+017F>o pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing an extremity, went to the very heart of <hi>Alexander,</hi> nay he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>tartled to find him<U+017F>elf thus undeceiv'd, that it would not have troubled him much if <hi>Garceran</hi> had <U+017F>et upon him, that he might be reveng'd of the affront done him by <hi>I<U+017F>abella,</hi> by Dying before her Eyes. <q>I <U+017F>hould never have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, <hi><U+017F>aid he, parting from her,</hi> that you could have been <U+017F>o barbarous, as to put me off <U+017F>o poorly in <U+017F>o dangerous an exigency, or <U+017F>o inexorable, upon the entreaties of <U+017F>o faithful a Servant. You never had any real kindne<U+017F>s for me; that reputation you <U+017F>tand <U+017F>o nicely upon, would have run no hazard, either as to your Friend, or my Enemy, by your receiving me as a Husband, upon which accompt only I made my addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to you, upon which if you, ungrateful Woman, had entertain'd me, and not in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted on frivolous re<U+017F>pects grounded on <U+017F>uch maxims as I cannot like, my heart had at this time been ab<U+017F>olutely at your di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al. To make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervedly <U+017F>uch, hath been the main end of all my Court<U+017F>hips and Services, but Heaven would not permit it; and <U+017F>ince I could find no compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in your heart, I will go and try what I may expect from my Enemy, with a re<U+017F>olution never to forget a procedure I am <U+017F>o much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at.</q>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58823:55"/>
<U+017F>he went to call him, he was got a great way down the <U+017F>treet, pur<U+017F>u'd by <hi>Garceran,</hi> who being a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd he was the per<U+017F>on he look'd for, was going to <U+017F>et upon him.

For <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceran</hi> being, in appearance, and that before <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons, reconcil'd with him, all would have blam'd him, had he a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted him upon the old accompt, e<U+017F>pecially at advantage, and with Fire-arms. So that <U+017F>eeing he had lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a fair opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge him<U+017F>elf, he <U+017F>lipp'd a<U+017F>ide, to avoid being known, imagining he had not been di<U+017F>cover'd. <hi>Alexander</hi> related the whole <U+017F>tory to his friend, and how he had been pur<U+017F>u'd thither; which he much wondred at, <U+017F>eeing <hi>Garceran</hi> <U+017F>o little minded the engagement he had made before <U+017F>o many per<U+017F>ons of quality, and that <U+017F>o <U+017F>light a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tick <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e to his heart.</p>
                        <p>It was by this time very late, and as well for that rea<U+017F>on, as to be <U+017F>atisfy'd of what he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, <hi>Alexander</hi> being near <hi>Don Jaymo</hi>'s Lodging, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd to take part of it that night, which his friend was very glad of. They got in, and ere they lay down, they fell into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e about what had pa<U+017F>s'd. <hi>Alexander</hi> open'd him<U+017F>elf to <hi>Don Jaymo,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58823:56"/>
him how things <U+017F>tood between him and <hi>I<U+017F>abella. Don Jaymo</hi> had heard <U+017F>omewhat of the mutual love there was between her and <hi>Fernand,</hi> and was vex'd to <U+017F>ee his friend had <U+017F>o far mi<U+017F>-plac'd his affections, and particularly at the re<U+017F>olution he had made to Marry her; whereupon he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear telling him what he had heard of her and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi> Which <hi>Alexander</hi> under<U+017F>tanding, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately pre<U+017F>um'd, that the rea<U+017F>on why <U+017F>he opened not the door, mu<U+017F>t needs be, that her former Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant was with her. A thou<U+017F>and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages came into his mind, but he particularly reflected on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, which the crafty Gentlewoman had made him, of <U+017F>peaking to her in the night, and that it was onely <U+017F>ince <hi>Fernand</hi>'s return from <hi>Madrid:</hi> Upon which communicating his thoughts to his friend, they joyntly concluded, that <hi>Fernand</hi> mu<U+017F>t needs be in the Hou<U+017F>e with her. To be fully a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of it, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Servant of <hi>Don Jaymo</hi>'s to examine the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and to continue in the Street, till it were Day: and for further certainty, another Servant was appointed to <U+017F>tand centry in the other Street, by which <hi>Fernand</hi> was wont to get in at a back-door. With this precaution, they went to Bed together; but <hi>Alexander</hi> was in <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>turbance, that he could not <U+017F>leep a wink. About half an hour before Day, one of the Servants brought intelligence, that he had <U+017F>een <hi>Don Fernand</hi> going out of the Hou<U+017F>e belonging to <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi>'s Friend, and that about the <U+017F>ame time, he had <U+017F>een <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> in one of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows that look'd into that Street, looking on him as he went out, and that he was <U+017F>ure it was no other than <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf. This accompt <U+017F>atisfy'd <hi>Alexander</hi>
                           <pb n="103" facs="tcp:58823:56"/>
<U+017F>o fully, that all the Love he formerly bore that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Woman, immediately vani<U+017F>hed. 'Twas not imaginable, that <hi>Fernand</hi> frequented that Hou<U+017F>e, upon the accompt of the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of it, who being turn'd of fifty, could not be courted by any Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants. Be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>he had the reputation of being a very charitable per<U+017F>on in Love-affairs, and was wont to promote the enjoyments of younger people, and to give excellent directions how they might mo<U+017F>t cautiou<U+017F>ly accompli<U+017F>h their de<U+017F>ires.</p>
                        <p>The night following, <hi>Alexander</hi> would him<U+017F>elf, from the Hou<U+017F>e of a certain friend of his, <U+017F>ee <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> getting into the Sanctuary of that charitable Sollicitre<U+017F>s, and for his further a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, he lay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due upon the Roof, whence he di<U+017F>cover'd, that that favour'd Gallant continu'd there, till word was brought him that he might make his entrance into <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi>'s. That very night, the di<U+017F><U+017F>embling Go<U+017F><U+017F>ip, would needs endeavour to <U+017F>atisfie her Lover, as to the di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfaction he might ju<U+017F>tly have conceiv'd of her. To leave nothing unattempted, and to keep in as near as might be with all, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent <hi>Alexander</hi> a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by a Servant-maid, in whom <U+017F>he repo<U+017F>ed great tru<U+017F>t, and who was not a <U+017F>tranger to the Loves of both the Gallants, and promoted the de<U+017F>ign of her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s in abu<U+017F>ing them, for the advantage <U+017F>he reaped thereby. Hearing <U+017F>he <U+017F>taid to <U+017F>peak with him, he call'd her up, and receiv'd from her a Paper containing the<U+017F>e words.</p>

That I have not been <U+017F>o compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate as the exigency requir'd, be pleas'd to attribute to the tenderne<U+017F>s I had for my own Honour, the con<U+017F>ideration whereof made me inexorable. I love you beyond my own Life; but one of my Birth and Sex may be pardon'd, if <U+017F>he <U+017F>acrifice all things to the <U+017F>ecurity of her Reputation, rather than expo<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf to the cen<U+017F>ures of ill Tongues. You may well imagine, when I deny'd you entrance into my Hou<U+017F>e, that my good Name must run a <U+017F>trange hazard with that trouble<U+017F>ome Bed-fellow, whom, to my unhappine<U+017F>s, I was then forc'd to entertain. Notwithstanding the re<U+017F>entment wherewith you left me, you could not but ob<U+017F>erve the distraction I was in: whence you may infer, how thankfully I have <U+017F>ince acknowledg'd the indulgence of tho<U+017F>e higher powers, who re<U+017F>cu'd you out of a danger, which I thought unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

which I <U+017F>hould prefer before two things I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt <U+017F>o pretious.

My Life indeed would have been <U+017F>ecur'd, if you had receiv'd me into your Hou<U+017F>e; but my Honour would have been irrecoverably lost, if, without my di<U+017F>covery of it, you could have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd your Charity on two <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons, the <U+017F>ame night.

It was not long ere this Letter came to the hands of <hi>I<U+017F>abella,</hi> whom the Maid found in that Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Hou<U+017F>e of hers, through which <hi>Fernand</hi> had acce<U+017F>s to her.

The old Croney, no le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>turb than the young Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, found, that <hi>Fernand</hi>'s love was di<U+017F>cover'd, to the great di<U+017F>advantage of her Reputation, in as much as it clearly expre<U+017F>s'd, that it was through her Hou<U+017F>e, <hi>Fernand</hi> made his approaches to her Friend, whereat <U+017F>he was extreamly afflicted. <hi>I<U+017F>abella</hi> was <U+017F>o troubled at the contents of that Letter, that <U+017F>he curs'd the day and hour <U+017F>he had <U+017F>uffered <hi>Alexander</hi> to court her: The onely comfort <U+017F>he could rai<U+017F>e to her <U+017F>elf, was, that <U+017F>he knew him to be of <U+017F>o generous a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition, that, though he had a ju<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion to be incens'd again<U+017F>t her, yet would he conceal her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and not publi<U+017F>h the corre<U+017F>pondence there had been between them.

of, towards him, to whom <U+017F>he had devoted her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, how could <U+017F>he imagine he <U+017F>hould not leave her in the lerch?

THis plea<U+017F>ant Novel entertain'd the Company till they came to their Inn that night. Every one took occa<U+017F>ion to commend Doctor <hi>Mon<U+017F>alvo,</hi> as well for the <U+017F>martne<U+017F>s of his Invention, as for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Stile. The old Gentleman told him, that if the whole Piece were an<U+017F>werable to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern he had <U+017F>hewn them of it, no doubt but his Novels would be very well receiv'd in the World, and that he would gain as much Reputation by them, as they had had Plea<U+017F>ure: and thereupon he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>tly entreated him to communicate <U+017F>omewhat of the others to them, that <U+017F>o their Travelling might be the le<U+017F>s tedious. The Doctor gave him and all the re<U+017F>t of the Company his very hearty thanks for the good opinion they had of him, and proffer'd them, when they <U+017F>hould be weary of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing, to divert them with <U+017F>ome of the other Novels, till they came to their Journey's end, provided they thought them not tedious.

They came to him, and as <U+017F>oon as the Doctor had receiv'd his Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and given him Ab<U+017F>olution, he lo<U+017F>t his Speech, being <U+017F>upported by <hi>Garay.</hi> The Doctor return'd to the Coach, and having called <U+017F>everal times upon <hi>Rufina,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <U+017F>he could not get away <hi>Garay,</hi> the Coach-man perceiving it began to grow dark, put on the Hor<U+017F>es, having <U+017F>ent them word what Inn they <U+017F>hould take up. <hi>Rufina</hi> was much troubled to <U+017F>ee the Coach gone, having left her and <hi>Garay</hi> behind, charitably exhorting the Dying per<U+017F>on to recommend him<U+017F>elf as much as he could to the mercy of God; but he was <U+017F>o far gone, that, to <U+017F>pare them further Exhortation, he gave up the Gho<U+017F>t. They were much troubled what they <U+017F>hould do with the Body, when certain Officers of Ju<U+017F>tice came in, who, having at a di<U+017F>tance <U+017F>een the Dead per<U+017F>on in the Arms of <hi>Garay,</hi> and a Woman <U+017F>tanding by, and had notice before that two Men were <U+017F>een going out of the City, with a de<U+017F>ign to fight a Duel, pre<U+017F>ently imagin'd, that <hi>Garay</hi> was one of them, and con<U+017F>equently the Murtherer of the other; upon which pre<U+017F>umption, he was <U+017F>ent to Pri<U+017F>on, and order given the Jaylor to put him fa<U+017F>t enough. <hi>Rufina</hi> had more favour, being confin'd in the Hou<U+017F>e of one of the Officers, who was to have a care to her forth-coming. They both us'd all the arguments they could to clear them<U+017F>elves, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing to do with the Murther, alledging upon what occa<U+017F>ion they came to the Body. But their own words would not be taken, and it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>um'd
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58823:64"/>
the Duel had been upon the accompt of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina</hi> The Judge order'd her to be brought to his own Hou<U+017F>e to be further examin'd, which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done. When <U+017F>he came thither, there were in the Room <U+017F>everal Gentlemen, and among others a <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e,</hi> a very rich Merchant, whom <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of his own had brought thither. They had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>een <hi>Rufina,</hi> but they all admir'd her Beauty and the Maje<U+017F>ty of her Air, but the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfy'd of any was the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e,</hi> who, to give him his due, was of a very amorous con<U+017F>titution. <hi>Rufina</hi> was extreamly troubled that <U+017F>uch an affront <U+017F>hould be done her by the way, as perceiving that if they were <U+017F>taid the next day, they <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e the opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their journey. The Judge put <U+017F>everal Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tions to her, concerning the Duel, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Death; whereto <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>he knew nothing of it, that <U+017F>he was coming in the <hi>Sevil-</hi>Coach, to go for <hi>Madrid,</hi> accompany'd by <U+017F>ome other Per<U+017F>ons then in the Inn, whom <U+017F>he named; That as the Coach pa<U+017F>s'd by, a certain Per<U+017F>on, who had been Wounded upon the High-way, not far from them, call'd out for <U+017F>ome body to receive his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and that a Prie<U+017F>t who was with them in the Coach, went out to do it, with whom al<U+017F>o <U+017F>he went out of curio<U+017F>ity, accompany'd by an Uncle of hers, who came along with her. They ordered, in regard it was grown late, to adjourn the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s till the next day, that a more exact enquiry might be made into it, and, in the mean time, that all who came along with the Coach, <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>tir from <hi>Corduba,</hi> without permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion. This done, <hi>Rufina</hi> was brought back to the Officer's Hou<U+017F>e, where <U+017F>he was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58823:64"/>
that night. The <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e,</hi> who liv'd not far from it, accompany'd her; but though he had liv'd at a far greater di<U+017F>tance, he would have thought it no great way to wait on a Lady, with whom he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready over head and ears in Love. Taking leave of her at the Officer's hou<U+017F>e, he proffer'd her all the Services lay in his power, for which <U+017F>he thanked him, yet taking it for no more than a Complement. The Vexation <U+017F>he conceiv'd at her being thus unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly <U+017F>taid, brought her into <U+017F>ome fits of a Feaver, the fir<U+017F>t, of a Tertian, which <U+017F>he afterwards fell into.</p>
            <p>The next day, all the per<U+017F>ons, who came in the Coach, being examin'd, gave the <U+017F>ame account as <hi>Rufina</hi> had done before, whereupon <hi>Garay</hi> was <U+017F>et at Liberty. Other witne<U+017F><U+017F>es al<U+017F>o who knew <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what concerning the Duel, were heard, and gave the Judges a perfect knowledge of the Murther. <hi>Garay</hi> went immediately to vi<U+017F>it <hi>Rufina,</hi> expre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf extreamly troubled at her indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition; he did all he could to cheer her up, that they might pro<U+017F>ecure their Journey: but the Phy<U+017F>itian, who had vi<U+017F>ited her, advis'd her not to remove thence, till <U+017F>he had recover'd her Feaver, and told her, that <U+017F>he could not travel any further, without hazard of her Life; which being <U+017F>o, the Coach-man was forc'd to leave them behind, but they were adjudg'd to defray the charges of their <U+017F>tay, and he to deliver up what they had in the Coach. The <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi> came often to <U+017F>ee the fair Traveller, at the Officer's hou<U+017F>e, and began to treat her very nobly, an humour the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in him, who, for <U+017F>ordid niggardline<U+017F>s might be compared to the covetous <hi>Marquina;</hi> but Love,

            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> kept her Bed fifteen days, during which time, <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>tantly vi<U+017F>ited by Signor <hi>Octavio,</hi> (<U+017F>o was called the amorous <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e)</hi> and after the Vi<U+017F>it, came in a Servant with a treat of Sweet-meats, and Wild-fowl, which the Officer and his Wife were glad to <U+017F>ee, for the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>hare fell to them. At la<U+017F>t, the Lady, with her Health, recover'd al<U+017F>o her good Complexion, and her Beauty, and the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his civilities, proffer'd her a Hou<U+017F>e with a fair Garden, which he had on the <U+017F>ide of the plea<U+017F>ant River <hi>Quadalguemir. Garay,</hi> whom <U+017F>he called her Uncle, advis'd her not to refu<U+017F>e that proffer, for he had di<U+017F>cover'd the Man to be extreamly in Love with her, that he was very Rich, and that they might get as much out of the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e,</hi> as they had out of the covetous <hi>Marquina. Rufina</hi> accepted the proffer, and <U+017F>et things in order to go to the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi>'s, and to continue there till <U+017F>he had recover'd her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o well, as that <U+017F>he might pro<U+017F>ecute her Journey. The <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi> would not have it known at <hi>Corduba,</hi> that he had brought her to his Country-hou<U+017F>e, to prevent peoples talk, and other inconveniences that might have en<U+017F>u'd. So that, with the con<U+017F>ent of <hi>Rufina,</hi> he gave out, that <U+017F>he had left the City in order to the pro<U+017F>ecution of her Voyage. Accordingly, there were two Mules brought for her and <hi>Garay,</hi> and two others to carry their Luggage, and having left <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duba,</hi> towards the Evening, to blind the eyes of the inqui<U+017F>itive, they kept on their way towards <hi>Madrid:</hi> but having Rid out about half a League, they turn'd
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58823:65"/>
back again, and took up their quarters at Signor <hi>Octavio</hi>'s, which was not above two flight <U+017F>hots from the City. There he expected her, with a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Supper, which he had provided. Here the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi> di<U+017F>cover'd his Love to her more freely than he had done before. He was a per<U+017F>on of about forty years of Age, of a good Manly countenance, having buried his Wife <U+017F>ome two years before, by whom he had had no Children. He was a whole-<U+017F>ale Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and traded in all <U+017F>orts of Commodities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>omuch that all the other Merchants, not onely of the City, but al<U+017F>o of other places thereabouts came to him, for he held corre<U+017F>pondences in all parts. He was a very thrifty per<U+017F>on, nay, to give him his due character, I <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e other expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. He had <U+017F>ome yearly Revenue, be<U+017F>ides twenty thou<U+017F>and Crowns in ready Money, and <U+017F>ixty thou<U+017F>and in Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and his own Trading, which was very great. He was a great Student, and had <U+017F>tudied at <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>Bologna,</hi> before he became Heir to his Brother, who Dy'd a very Rich man in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that Inheritance it was, that occa<U+017F>ion'd his Marriage at <hi>Corduba.</hi> He had <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate an affection for <hi>Rufina,</hi> that he u<U+017F>ed all the ways he could imagine to in<U+017F>inuate him<U+017F>elf into her favour. Upon that accompt it was that he proffer'd her the u<U+017F>e of his Country-hou<U+017F>e, to take the Air, and recover her Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, conceiving, that, being at his own Hou<U+017F>e, it would be the more ea<U+017F>ie for him to compa<U+017F>s his de<U+017F>ires. She had been told by <hi>Garay,</hi> that this Merchant was a well-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd Fowl, and might be ea<U+017F>ily pluck'd, and <U+017F>ince this good Luck had fallen to them by chance, they <U+017F>hould make the be<U+017F>t advantage they could of it.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58823:66"/>
That night, they onely Supp'd, and every one went to his re<U+017F>t, for it was very late. The <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi> made as if he would have returned to the City, and lye there; but his Servants, whom he had before in<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, per<U+017F>uaded him not to go abroad at that un<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable time of the Night, for fear of meeting with any Thieves: be<U+017F>ides, there being a Pre<U+017F>s in the City, many young Men pre<U+017F>um'd to do mi<U+017F>chief in the Night, and robbed all they met. At la<U+017F>t, being per<U+017F>uaded not to <U+017F>tir out, he was glad to pa<U+017F>s away <U+017F>ome part of the Night in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing with <hi>Rufina,</hi> and being got to Bed, his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was to con<U+017F>ider, by what means, and with lea<U+017F>t charge, he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his de<U+017F>ires of her. Several things came into his mind, but the ea<U+017F>ie<U+017F>t he could find, <U+017F>uitably to his humour, was to forget her, and never think of her any more; for he knew the Age we live in to be <U+017F>uch, that it is a miracle to get any kindne<U+017F>s in Love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Liberality.</p>
            <p>The next morning he commanded <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>hould be made for her break-fa<U+017F>t, not imagining <U+017F>he was up: But when word was brought him that <U+017F>he was out of Bed, the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi> would needs go into her Chamber, to chide her for ri<U+017F>ing <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, and by that means to <U+017F>ee whether <hi>Rufina</hi>'s beauty were any way oblig'd to artifice. He found her kembing her head, and <U+017F>o he had a full <U+017F>ight of her hair, which was of a great length, and of a Che<U+017F>tnut colour. The <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi> gave God thanks, who, with <U+017F>o many other perfections, had be<U+017F>tow'd on her <U+017F>uch an excellent Head of hair: but he was much more a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd, when, upon her dividing them into two parts, to make him an an<U+017F>wer, he <U+017F>aw her Face, as beautiful as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58823:66"/>
it had appear'd to him when <U+017F>he went to bed; a thing able to enflame a per<U+017F>on le<U+017F>s enclin'd to Love and more to Avarice than he was, ina<U+017F>much as there is not a greater charm, to <U+017F>ecure a Lover's heart, than to <U+017F>ee that the beauty of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s is natural, and <U+017F>corns to borrow any thing of Art. <hi>Rufina</hi> indeed was not much troubled to look after waters, paints, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matums, unguents, and <U+017F>uch things, wherewith <U+017F>uch women, who <U+017F>tand in need of them, ha<U+017F>ten on their age with their wrinkles, and lo<U+017F>e their youth ere they are aware. She onely wa<U+017F>h'd her <U+017F>elf in fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and needed no other vermilion to heighten the beauty of her face, than that of her own lively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. The Merchant ask'd whether <U+017F>he would be pleas'd to <U+017F>ee his Garden? She made an<U+017F>wer, that <U+017F>he was extremely oblig'd to him for the trouble he gave him<U+017F>elf to divert her; and to <U+017F>atis<U+017F>ie him how kindly <U+017F>he took that favour at his hands, <U+017F>he went along with him ju<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he was, without putting up her hair, which hanging down over her <U+017F>houlders, added much to her beauty, and it is not much to be doubted, but <U+017F>he had a de<U+017F>ign in it.

The Clo<U+017F>et was full of Books, very richly bound, and neatly di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd into gilt Drawers. <hi>Garay,</hi> who was a curious per<U+017F>on, and had read much, was looking very earne<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Titles of the Books, which were in one Drawer, and having put that into its place, he took out another, wherein there were others very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly bound, but had no Titles on the backs. <hi>Garay</hi> opens one of them, and finds the Author of it to be <hi>Arnaldus de Villa Nova,</hi> and near that were the works of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ino, Alquindus,</hi> and <hi>Raymundus Lulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> The Merchant perceiving him <U+017F>o taken up with the peru<U+017F>al of tho<U+017F>e Books, ask'd him what he look'd on <U+017F>o attentively. <q>I find here, Sir, <hi>replies Garay,</hi> a great many Books of Chymi<U+017F>try, and, from the curio<U+017F>ity I ob<U+017F>erve in your collection of Treati<U+017F>es of that kind, I infer, that you have <U+017F>tudied that Science. </q>

It is this (whi<U+017F>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the ear) that my Niece knows, without any <U+017F>tudy, in a manner as much as I do of this Art, and is very fortunate in the practick part of it, as you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee by experience. But I entreat you not to <U+017F>peak to her of it at this time, for <U+017F>he would not have it known to any, nay would not take it well. </q>
               <hi>Garay</hi> could not have pitch'd upon a more likely way to bring the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi> into the gin; for his avarice was <U+017F>uch, that he would have parted with his Soul to find out the Philo<U+017F>opher's <U+017F>tone, hoping, if he once got that <U+017F>ecret, ever afterwards to <U+017F>wim in gold.</p>

The truth is, <hi>Garay</hi> had <U+017F>ome knowledge in that Science, and that he had <U+017F>pent a con<U+017F>iderable <U+017F>um of mony, to find out the Philo<U+017F>opher's Stone, which though many had <U+017F>ought, yet could not any affirm they had met with it. The <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s he had had in that bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s onely <U+017F>atisfi'd him of their folly, who <U+017F>pent their time and e<U+017F>tates in <U+017F>o ridiculous a di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition, and he was glad to have met with <U+017F>uch an opportunity, to recover <U+017F>ome part of the mony he had <U+017F>quander'd away therein: for the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e,</hi> crediting what was told him by <hi>Garay,</hi> imagin'd him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>omewhat above a Prince.

            <p>Having <U+017F>een a Lute, in one of the rooms above-<U+017F>tairs, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ir'd it might be brought down; for her Mu<U+017F>ick, at which <U+017F>he was excellent, contributed much to the bringing about of her de<U+017F>igns. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who had a little skill at that In<U+017F>trument him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, was very glad to hear that <U+017F>he us'd it, and caus'd it to be immediately fetch'd, <U+017F>aying that his decea<U+017F>ed wife plaid excellently well upon it, and that about a <U+017F>ev'n-night before, having entertain'd <U+017F>ome of his friends with a Collation, they had <U+017F>et it in tune. The Lute being come, <hi>Rufina</hi> began to play, and made it appear, that there were very few could excel her at that In<U+017F>trument. The <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi> was a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h'd at her dexterity, and to bring him ab<U+017F>olutely to her lure, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ung an Air to it, but with <U+017F>uch a grace, that he was at a lo<U+017F>s, whether he <U+017F>hould more admire her hand, or her voice. The truth is, <U+017F>he had a particular excellency in both, <U+017F>o that his exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive commendations of them, were not <U+017F>o full of flattery as might be expected from a per<U+017F>on pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love.

He put it into the Creu<U+017F>et, which having brought as cleaverly as he could to a window, he pour'd out the melted Copper, and put the Ingot of gold into its place, and when he had cover'd it, he told the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e,</hi> that it <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>tirr'd thence for half an hour.

His An<U+017F>wer to him, was, that the grounds and motives, on which he conceal'd the excellent knowledge he had acquir'd, were ju<U+017F>t and rational, <U+017F>ince that no doubt but he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, though for no other rea<U+017F>on than this, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his carrying over <U+017F>uch a Secret into another Country, to <U+017F>erve a King that were an enemy to his Catholick Maje<U+017F>ty.

            <p>The <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e,</hi> ravi<U+017F>h'd at that propo<U+017F>al, proffer'd to <U+017F>pend all he was worth upon that accompt. <hi>Rufina</hi> promis'd to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them.

re<U+017F>olution. The Alchymi<U+017F>t thought it a good way to further his work, and accordingly he approv'd of his intention, and acknowledg'd it would be a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Neece to meet with <U+017F>o worthy a Per<U+017F>on; but that there was one Ob<U+017F>tacle to be fir<U+017F>t removed. <q>What may that be <hi><U+017F>ays the other?</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>Garay</hi> told him, that his Neece could not be Married, till a Di<U+017F>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ation were fir<U+017F>t obtained from <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard, that, out of the extraordinary regret <U+017F>he conceiv'd at the lo<U+017F>s of her late Husband, <U+017F>he made a Vow to enter into a Religious life; that the occa<U+017F>ion of their going to <hi>Madrid,</hi> was to receive <U+017F>ix years Arrerages of a Rent due to them from a per<U+017F>on of Quality, who was very backward in paying, in order to her reception into a Nunnery; but that as <U+017F>oon as the Di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation were come from <hi>Rome,</hi> they would conclude the Marriage, which he doubted not but <U+017F>he would accept, not onely out of the compliance <U+017F>he had ever expre<U+017F>s'd towards him, but al<U+017F>o out of this con<U+017F>ideration, that <U+017F>he was to match her <U+017F>elf with a Per<U+017F>on inclin'd to the <U+017F>tudy of a Science, wherein <U+017F>he had naturally attain'd <U+017F>o great perfection. <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfy'd Man in the world to have <U+017F>uch a parcel of good words given him, in<U+017F>omuch that from that very hour <hi>Garay</hi> became ab<U+017F>olute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter of all he was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi> having conferr'd notes upon this new Overture, were more confident than ever, to compa<U+017F>s their de<U+017F>ign. He freely laid out the Money receiv'd of <hi>Octavio</hi> in Drugges, per<U+017F>uading him they were not to be had under <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch rates. He al<U+017F>o furni<U+017F>h'd him<U+017F>elf with new Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, Creu<U+017F>ets and Alembicks, pretending that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58823:73"/>
tho<U+017F>e in the Hou<U+017F>e before, were not for his purpo<U+017F>e. In the mean time, the <U+017F>illy Merchant was enquiring up and down where he might have the Urine of a Red-headed Child, which he had much ado to get; for the Mothers fearing it was to be us'd in <U+017F>ome operation of Witchcraft, would not ea<U+017F>ily let him have it; but Money is omnipotent, and can do any thing. <hi>Garay</hi> could have done as much in one Day as in a hundred, as to the performance of what he had promis'd, but the poor Merchant mu<U+017F>t be fool'd <U+017F>ome way or other, till he met with an opportunity to <U+017F>mite him, and take a Dog's leave of <hi>Corduba,</hi> with as much as he could <U+017F>hift away on two good Hor<U+017F>es, which lay Leger in a <U+017F>ecret place for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>He di<U+017F>pos'd all the Di<U+017F>tillations into the Furnaces, in the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Octavio;</hi> he bought <U+017F>ome Metals, as Bra<U+017F>s, Copper, and Tin, <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of Salts, and other things commonly u<U+017F>ed by Chymi<U+017F>ts; and <U+017F>etting Fire to the Furnaces, they Di<U+017F>till'd what had been put into them, but contributing nothing to the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and only to abu<U+017F>e him, who was at the charge of all the Foolery. As to <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Love, he was much better treated than he was before; ina<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <U+017F>ince the propo<U+017F>al of Marriage, <hi>Rufina,</hi> the better to carry on the main de<U+017F>ign, grew more kind to him, e<U+017F>pecially in <hi>Garay</hi>'s ab<U+017F>ence, which the be<U+017F>otted Cocks-comb was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with, that he knew not whether his head or his heels were on the ground.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Octavio</hi> receiv'd a Bill of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of a con<U+017F>iderable Sum, to be paid within twenty days after <U+017F>ight. This, with the breaking of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58823:73"/>
<U+017F>ome of his Debtors in other Countries, put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <U+017F>ome fear of doing the like, if his attempts in Chymi<U+017F>try prov'd not <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful. But to prevent all inconveniences, he did what mo<U+017F>t of his Quality and Kidney are wont to do, who being upon the point of breaking, <U+017F>ecure what they can of their E<U+017F>tates, that they may afterwards the more commodiou<U+017F>ly remove into <U+017F>ome other Country. So our Merchant, finding him<U+017F>elf within <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance of breaking, provided for the misfortune, in ca<U+017F>e it <U+017F>hould happen, and <U+017F>o promoted the mi<U+017F>chievous plot of <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina,</hi> whom he truly acquainted how affairs <U+017F>tood with him, as if they had been his mo<U+017F>t faithful Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Garay</hi> had left in the cu<U+017F>tody of a certain friend of the Merchants, a good <U+017F>um of Money, and <U+017F>ome Jewels of great Value, with order they <U+017F>hould not be deliver'd to any but one of them two. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides which, he brought <U+017F>ome to his Country-hou<U+017F>e, and hid them in a <U+017F>ecret place in the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Rufina,</hi> of whom he had a confidence, as if <U+017F>he had really been his Wife. <hi>Garay,</hi> who was <U+017F>till bu<U+017F>ie about his Di<U+017F>tillations, put him into good hope, that within twenty days he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee the end of the great work, and his Hou<U+017F>e full of Gold, to recover the lo<U+017F>s he had receiv'd by his Debtors.</p>
            <p>About this time, there happen'd a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which oblig'd <hi>Octavio</hi> to take a Journey, to advi<U+017F>e with a Corre<U+017F>pondent of his, how to prevent the misfortune he <U+017F>aw coming upon him. <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi> being entru<U+017F>ted with the Hou<U+017F>e, thought it a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to di<U+017F>lodge, and make the be<U+017F>t they could of the pre<U+017F>ent game. They <U+017F>ecur'd all the Money and Jewels they could come at, and left the Plate and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58823:74"/>
<U+017F>ome other things, they could not <U+017F>o conveniently carry away, behind them, though with <U+017F>ome regret, thinking it more prudence to make a <U+017F>afe retreat with what were con<U+017F>iderable, than to hazard all, by gra<U+017F>ping at too much. Having therefore loaden them<U+017F>elves with what was mo<U+017F>t pretious, they left the Furnaces, and the Alembicks, made the Philo<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's <U+017F>tone at the co<U+017F>t of the ab<U+017F>ent Merchant, and took Hor<U+017F>e while the people of the Hou<U+017F>e were fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep. They took their way towards <hi>Malaga,</hi> and travell'd all night, having about them above <U+017F>ix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and Crowns in Money and Jewels, and left, upon a Table near the Furnaces, a paper of Ver<U+017F>es, to ha<U+017F>ten the credulous Merchant to hang him<U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>Two days after their departure he returns home, very ill <U+017F>atisfy'd with his Journey, in that he had not done any thing in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which occa<U+017F>ion'd it. All the hope he now had was in his Uncle, <hi>Garay,</hi> imagining, by his means, he <U+017F>hould yet be able to <U+017F>hew his head, and not onely keep up his Reputation, but al<U+017F>o be Richer than ever he had been, <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>trange Mi<U+017F>t had the Witchcraft of Chymi<U+017F>try ca<U+017F>t before his Eyes.</p>
            <p>He came not to his Country-hou<U+017F>e till after Night, where he found the Servant whom he had left with <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina,</hi> for the re<U+017F>t of his people were in the City. The Servant receiv'd him with a <U+017F>ad countenance, and being got up <U+017F>tairs, he ask'd him (fearing <U+017F>omewhat were ami<U+017F>s) where his Gue<U+017F>ts were, of whom the Servant could give him no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as having not <U+017F>een them when they went out, and could onely <U+017F>ay, that, two Nights before, they had lock'd him into the Room where he lay, which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58823:74"/>
he had been forc'd to break open, becau<U+017F>e he could not otherwi<U+017F>e get out. They <U+017F>earch'd up and down, and found that the Che<U+017F>ts had been opened, and all the Money convey'd away. This was not the wor<U+017F>t the Merchant feared, but that they had al<U+017F>o been with him, in who<U+017F>e cu<U+017F>tody he had greater <U+017F>umms of Money, and the mo<U+017F>t pretious of his Hou<U+017F>hold-<U+017F>tuff. It being too late to make any enquiry that Night, he thought it his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to go to Bed; but de<U+017F>irous to vi<U+017F>it the Furnaces once more, he finds on the Table the Paper, left there by <hi>Garay,</hi> which having open'd, he found in it the<U+017F>e Lines.</p>

He turn'd him<U+017F>elf from one <U+017F>ide to another, not out of any di<U+017F>turbance, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion'd by his Love to the <U+017F>ubtle <hi>Rufina,</hi> (for that was ab<U+017F>olutely lo<U+017F>t with his Money) but that he had been <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>ely trapan'd by a beggarly Ra<U+017F>cal. Then did he begin to cur<U+017F>e Chymi<U+017F>try, and all the Authors that ever writ of it, whereas he <U+017F>hould rather have given God thanks, who, by the cheat which was put upon him, had prevented the pro<U+017F>ecution of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign, which might have ab<U+017F>olutely ruin'd him. As <U+017F>oon as he perceiv'd any appearance of Day, he got up, and went into the City, to his Hou<U+017F>e, whom he had entru<U+017F>ted with the keeping of his Money and other things. He ask'd him whether <hi>Garay</hi> had been with him? the other an<U+017F>wered that he had, and had taken away whatever he had in his cu<U+017F>tody, and that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58823:75"/>
therein he had follow'd his own orders. That word <U+017F>truck him almo<U+017F>t Dead; nay the re<U+017F>entments he expre<U+017F>s'd of that lo<U+017F>s were <U+017F>o great, that if the other had not known the cau<U+017F>e of it, he would have thought him out of his wits. He comforted him the be<U+017F>t he could, and told him, that his onely cour<U+017F>e was to make a <U+017F>peedy <U+017F>earch for the Robbers. He did all he could to that purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ending Officers and others <U+017F>everal ways; but that which <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi> had taken was <U+017F>o extraordinary, that they could never meet with them. So they return'd to <hi>Corduba,</hi> to be paid for their fruitle<U+017F>s pur<U+017F>uit, by him who had <U+017F>ent them, which, as his affairs <U+017F>tood then, added not a little to his affliction. This adventure was <U+017F>oon known all over the City; and the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e,</hi> not able to accept of another Bill of exchange that had been <U+017F>ent him, was forc'd to ab<U+017F>ent him<U+017F>elf, and to return to <hi>Genua,</hi> with what he could make by the <U+017F>ale of his Goods. By this means he turn'd Bankrupt, and defy'd his Creditors, who could not find any thing he had left behind him. The <U+017F>ame thing happens many times to tho<U+017F>e, who, with <U+017F>mall E<U+017F>tates, engage them<U+017F>elves in too great affairs, pre<U+017F>uming upon this, that, if it comes to the wor<U+017F>t, they can <U+017F>ecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves by an e<U+017F>cape.</p>

was <hi>Garay</hi>'s charge to provide Victuals; and being about the beginning of the Spring, they found it no great inconvenience, to lye abroad in the open air. They got into a thick Wood ju<U+017F>t as the Sun was ready to <U+017F>et, and fearing that a thick Cloud, under which they were, might break upon them with too great violence, as there was <U+017F>ome likelihood, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of the great Thunder and Lightning that had gone before, they went into the thicke<U+017F>t part of it, the better to <U+017F>ecure them<U+017F>elves. Other Travellers, upon the <U+017F>ame apprehen<U+017F>ion, had taken refuge at a place, near that where <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi> were.

               <q>O that Brother <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> is an excellent fellow, <hi><U+017F>ays another of them:</hi> his Religious frock covers a great deal of mi<U+017F>chief, and he is <U+017F>o in<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating in his behaviour, that he is very much in their favour, who be<U+017F>tow'd the Hermitage upon him. </q>
               <q>He is <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>cendent an Hypocrite, <hi>replies another,</hi> that he is able to blind all the World: he hath the reputation of a virtuous per<U+017F>on all over the Country, and there is not within twenty Leagues about a more con<U+017F>ummate Villain than he is. </q>
               <q>I have been acquainted with him the<U+017F>e twelve years, <hi><U+017F>ays the Second,</hi> and his profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion

            <p>Having made this <U+017F>trange di<U+017F>covery, he returns to the place where he had left <hi>Rufina,</hi> and gave her an accompt of what he had heard from tho<U+017F>e Robbers.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58823:77"/>
And taking their way to a blind Inn, not far thence, they <U+017F>tay'd there the remainder of that Night, and all the next Day. Having, in that time, con<U+017F>ider'd what they had to do, they went both towards the Hermitage, where Brother <hi>Crispin</hi> (<U+017F>o was the Hermite named) lived, and being got within a <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>tance of it, <hi>Garay</hi> bound <hi>Rufina</hi> to a Tree, upon which <U+017F>he cries out as loud as <U+017F>he could, <q>Is there no body to relieve a wretched Woman, ready to be Murther'd here? O Heaven, revenge the injury done to my innocence.</q> On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Garay</hi> acted his part, <U+017F>aying, <q>'Tis in vain for thee to call any body to thy relief; thou ha<U+017F>t not long to live, and therefore recommend thy <U+017F>elf to God, for thou <U+017F>halt not e<U+017F>cape out of my hands; as <U+017F>oon as I have bound thee to this Tree, I will di<U+017F>patch thy Soul into the other World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At the fir<U+017F>t noi<U+017F>e of her crying out, <hi>Crispin</hi> hears her, and being all alone in the Hermitage, a thing <U+017F>eldome happened, for, mo<U+017F>t nights, he had the company of <U+017F>ome of the tribe, who though guilty of much watching, were not much either of <U+017F>anctity or miracles. The Hermit came out with two good Pocket-pi<U+017F>tols, and being got near the place, whence he had heard the noi<U+017F>e, he di<U+017F>charg'd one of them, which happen'd very luckily for <hi>Garay.</hi> For it being re<U+017F>olv'd upon the que<U+017F>tion between him and <hi>Rufina,</hi> that he <U+017F>hould run away as <U+017F>oon as any came near them, it might be conceiv'd, the di<U+017F>charging of the Pi<U+017F>tol had frightned him. He pre<U+017F>ently mounted one of the Hor<U+017F>es; and leading away the other, he rid away with all the <U+017F>peed he could. <hi>Crispin</hi> comes
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58823:78"/>
near the Tree, and, by the light of the Moon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <hi>Rufina,</hi> weeping mo<U+017F>t bitterly, and <U+017F>eeming to be a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd, through that fright <U+017F>he was in. Seeing the Hermite coming towards her, <q>What art thou return'd Traitor, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he?</hi> will nothing deter thee from executing thy cruel de<U+017F>ign? Come, take away my Life, and put me out of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble, and doubt not but one time or other, Heaven, <U+017F>ince it will not re<U+017F>cue, will revenge my innocence.</q>The frock'd Hypocrite, hearing this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and perceiving thereby that <U+017F>he mi<U+017F>took him, made her this An<U+017F>wer, <q>Madam, I am not the per<U+017F>on you think me to be, but one who comes to relieve you in this extremity, and to <U+017F>ave your Life. What is become of the Villain, who would have taken it from you, and hath oblig'd me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rules of my Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to take Fire-arms to pur<U+017F>ue him, not doubting but what I do will be accompted an act of meritorious charity in the <U+017F>ight of God?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having thereupon unbound her, <hi>Rufina</hi> ca<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf at his feet, <U+017F>aying, <q>It mu<U+017F>t needs be, Brother <hi>Crispin,</hi> (for <U+017F>he knew his name) that you had <U+017F>ome revelation from Heaven, of the violence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me, <U+017F>ince you came <U+017F>o miraculou<U+017F>ly to my relief, and that with Arms <U+017F>o contrary to your Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion.

He open'd the door of the Hermitage, and when they were got in, <hi>Rufina</hi> was not a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd, to <U+017F>ee a rough Plank, which he pretended was his Bed, with a Crucifix at the head of it, and on one <U+017F>ide, hanging up by a Nail, an In<U+017F>trument made of good Whip-cord; wherewith his credulous Zealots believ'd that he di<U+017F>ciplin'd him<U+017F>elf: all the other furniture of the Room con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in a little rotten Table, which, by much travelling and removing from place to place, had brought four feet to three.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> finding the room <U+017F>o poorly furni<U+017F>h'd, and the per<U+017F>on who made his aboad in it <U+017F>o mortify'd and re<U+017F>erv'd in his behaviour, began to repent her <U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>he ever came thither, and imagin'd that <hi>Garay</hi> had mi<U+017F>-under<U+017F>tood the conference of the Robbers in the Wood.

Incomparable Hypocrite!

            <p>Though it cannot but add very much to my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to make a rebear<U+017F>al of the occa<U+017F>ion of it, yet the kindne<U+017F>s you have done me, my dear Brother, being <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>cendent, I <U+017F>hould be a very ungrateful per<U+017F>on, to deny you the <U+017F>atisfaction of <U+017F>ome account of her whom you have <U+017F>o highly oblig'd. <q>I was born, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,</hi> in the City of <hi>Almeria,</hi> of noble Parents, my Ance<U+017F>tors having been famous there for <U+017F>everal ages. All the children they had were onely my <U+017F>elf, and a Brother, who is a year older then I am. My Father and Mother left this world, and me in it a little before I was fully ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to the fifteenth year of my age. There were tho<U+017F>e who thought the face you now <U+017F>ee not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand<U+017F>ome, that is in other words, <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons courted me in order to marriage, but my Brother oppos'd it as much as lay in his power, charging my Sutors with <U+017F>ome defects or other, in their e<U+017F>tates or extraction, <U+017F>o that not any one of them obtain'd what they <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ir'd. I believe the true cau<U+017F>e of my Brother's refu<U+017F>als proceeded from a de<U+017F>ire he had that I <U+017F>hould go into a Nunnery, where I had two Aunts, and he get to him<U+017F>elf
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58823:80"/>
<U+017F>omewhat of the fortune my Father had left me. I di<U+017F>cover'd his de<U+017F>ign, by their continual pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing of me to become a Nun. But I never had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to that kind of life, and <U+017F>o my An<U+017F>wer to them was <U+017F>utable thereto; which incens'd my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t me, that he never look'd kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on me <U+017F>ince.</q>

            <q>
               <p>While the<U+017F>e things were in agitation, a young Gentleman, who had left <hi>Almeria</hi> ere he was ten years of age, return'd from <hi>Flanders,</hi> where, for the good <U+017F>ervices he had done his Maje<U+017F>ty, he had been advanc'd to the command of a Company of Foot and a Troop of Hor<U+017F>e. He came accordingly in a very good equipage, both as to Cloaths and Hor<U+017F>es. He had a pretty con<U+017F>iderable e<U+017F>tate, and had not receiv'd any thing from it <U+017F>ince his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Almeria,</hi> <U+017F>o that there was a good <U+017F>umm lay ready for him. He one day chanc'd to <U+017F>ee me at Church, and lik'd me <U+017F>o well, that he enquir'd who I was. Some gave him an account of me, and <U+017F>oon after, he began to make his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to me, and to court me by Letters and other ways. To make my tale <U+017F>hort, I was not in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his affection, but con<U+017F>idering with my <U+017F>elf the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity there was between us as to birth, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent endowments he was Ma<U+017F>ter of, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with his love, and admitted him to come into the hou<U+017F>e, but upon the a<U+017F><U+017F>urance he gave me, that his court<U+017F>hip was really in order to marriage. He vi<U+017F>ited me with much freedom, for my Brother was then <U+017F>ick of a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, which had brought him almo<U+017F>t to death's door, (I would it had carried him
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58823:81"/>
quite into that cold room, my condition would not be <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad as it is at the pre<U+017F>ent.) One of my former Sutors, being not a little troubled to <U+017F>ee a New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer <U+017F>o highly advanc'd in my favour, began to watch him, and in a <U+017F>hort time <U+017F>aw him let in and coming out of our hou<U+017F>e, at an un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable time of the night. He made a very ungentlemanlike advantage of that di<U+017F>covery; for, envying any other <U+017F>hould have what he could not obtain, he gave my Brother an account of what was done in his hou<U+017F>e. One day coming to vi<U+017F>it him, and being all alone with him, he told him what he had <U+017F>een. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had recover'd a little of his <U+017F>trength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to get up, and by his own ob<U+017F>ervation was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in what the other had told him. Yet could he not be reveng'd of me, by rea<U+017F>on of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and put it off to <U+017F>ome other opportunity. He <U+017F>eem'd to be extremely troubled that I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd my affection to that Captain, and prote<U+017F>ted that he would have been much le<U+017F>s, had I made choice of any other, for he had had <U+017F>ome difference with his elder Brother, and ever <U+017F>ince, they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been good friends.</p>
               <p>At la<U+017F>t, my Brother recover'd his former health, and finding the Captain gone from <hi>Almeria,</hi> he told me, that he would carry me to <U+017F>ee an Aunt of ours at <hi>Malaga,</hi> who was a Nun of the Order in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tituted by St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> I believ'd him, and not imagining he knew anything of the corre<U+017F>pondence between the Captain and my <U+017F>elf, I was very glad of the opportunity to <U+017F>ee that Aunt, whom I was much oblig'd to, for <U+017F>everal things <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ent
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58823:81"/>
me of her own working. We prepar'd our <U+017F>elves for the journey, and rode each of us on a hor<U+017F>e, with two <U+017F>ervants on two others to wait on us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into the wood near this place, he ordered the two <U+017F>ervants to go before, to prepare a lodging for us, and being come to the place where you found me, ju<U+017F>t as day was taking its la<U+017F>t leave, he threw me off my hor<U+017F>e, and put me into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you found me in, wherein no doubt I had peri<U+017F>h'd, had not you fortunately reliev'd me, for the di<U+017F>charging of the Pi<U+017F>tol made him get away before he had done the work he intended. May God, the requiter of all good turns, remember the charitable a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance you did me, which was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange, that I <U+017F>hall never forget it as long as I live.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Hermit having heard this <U+017F>tory, took occa<U+017F>ion to comfort her the be<U+017F>t he could, and promis'd her to do any thing that lay in his power; whereupon they parted for that time, and went to their <U+017F>everal Beds; <U+017F>he, to that which had been prepar'd for her, and he, to another, that lay in a <U+017F>ecret place, very well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h'd; for, however he blinded the world with an apparent au<U+017F>terity, he was a per<U+017F>on who lov'd his ea<U+017F>e as well as any other. He was deeply fallen in love with <hi>Rufina,</hi> and mighty de<U+017F>irous to acquaint her with his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; but the fear of <U+017F>candal made him a a little re<U+017F>erv'd. He <U+017F>pent the whole night without any re<U+017F>t, contriving how he might be<U+017F>t make a di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his love to her.</p>
            <p>As <U+017F>oon as it began to dawn, he got up and <U+017F>oon after him <hi>Rufina,</hi> who going into the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58823:82"/>
to the Hermitage, found him on his knees before the Altar, which oblig'd her to do the like, at a little di<U+017F>tance from him. He thought fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his devotion a while, but not without much di<U+017F>traction, for he could not forbear looking on her, to <U+017F>uch a height was his love grown in one night. On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Rufina,</hi> who was as well read in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocri<U+017F>ie as the Hermit, was re<U+017F>olv'd to outvy him at kneeling, in which po<U+017F>ture <U+017F>he continued <U+017F>omewhat longer than <U+017F>he could have wi<U+017F>h'd. At la<U+017F>t perceiving that <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> had done his prayers, <U+017F>he al<U+017F>o ended hers. Whereupon the holy Brother comes to her, and <U+017F>aid to her, <q>Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed be the great Pre<U+017F>erver of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, my dear Si<U+017F>ter in Chri<U+017F>t, for his infinite mercies; be it his good plea<U+017F>ure that you may live happily all the re<U+017F>t of your days, and have all tho<U+017F>e enjoyments of body and mind you can your <U+017F>elf de<U+017F>ire.

Having <U+017F>o <U+017F>aid, he brought her into a little room, out of which they had the pro<U+017F>pect of the fields, where being both <U+017F>ate down, <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> began to open him<U+017F>elf to her in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. <q>When I <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly con<U+017F>ider, Madam, the <U+017F>trange effects of beauty, how the pur<U+017F>uance of it forces men into di<U+017F>turbances, and in a manner tran<U+017F>ports them out of them<U+017F>elves, I cannot chu<U+017F>e but pity and excu<U+017F>e them, becau<U+017F>e the frailer part of man endeavours its own <U+017F>atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the heart is naturally enclin'd to de<U+017F>ire that which the eye contemplates with a certain plea<U+017F>ure, e<U+017F>pecially having for its object the mo<U+017F>t delightful thing that God ever fram'd. You may hence take occa<U+017F>ion to imagine, Si<U+017F>ter, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections we <U+017F>hould make on the cele<U+017F>tial beauties, and tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>upernatural miracles which tran<U+017F>cend the reach of our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es. When I left the world, which was in an age not much acquainted with the wickedne<U+017F>s of it, I propos'd to my <U+017F>elf, as far as I could with a re<U+017F>pect to humanity, to keep my <U+017F>elf at as great a di<U+017F>tance as I could from the <U+017F>ight of that admirable <U+017F>ex, which is not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervedly called, the fairer half of the world; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<U+017F>much as I have already put away childi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s, and began to entertain thoughts <U+017F>utable to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and apprehended, that to be exempted from the charms of women, was a privilege wholly angelical.

The di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery had been made by <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> in a hou<U+017F>e of the City, where he was wont to receive alms, and the rain having prevented the execution of the de<U+017F>igne that night, they had now done their work, by thru<U+017F>ting a little boy into the hou<U+017F>e where the mony was, who made a <U+017F>hift about mid-night to open the door for them.</p>
            <p>The three Robbers brought the mony that very night to the Hermitage. <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> who was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee what female-company he had in the hou<U+017F>e, receiv'd them in his own cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and treated them with a Supper. As they <U+017F>upp'd, they di<U+017F>cours'd of divers things. There was among them one, who having quitted his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, had engag'd him<U+017F>elf in that infamous kind of life, not regarding his extraction, nor his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, which were much beyond ordinary. This per<U+017F>on furni<U+017F>h'd them with di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon all occa<U+017F>ions; whence it came that <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> de<U+017F>ir'd him to divert them a little, and, to drive away the time a while after <U+017F>upper, to entertain them with <U+017F>ome Hi<U+017F>tory or Novel, for he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them. He pre<U+017F>s'd him the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>tly, that <hi>Rufina</hi> might al<U+017F>o participate of the diver<U+017F>ion, who, from the room where <U+017F>he was, might hear all their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. She was very glad, to find, that <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> was the <U+017F>ecret entertainer of <U+017F>o virtuous a Society, and immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded

by their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, that they were the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>ons, whom <hi>Garay</hi> had over-heard in the wood. The young man, whom the Hermite had intreated to tell them <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tory, di<U+017F>play'd the excellency of his wit and memory, in the relation of the en<U+017F>uing Novel.</p>

                        <p>As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was come into his Country, he took order about his Brother's E<U+017F>tate, and the Tuition of his Nephews, whom he left in the cu<U+017F>tody of an antient Kin<U+017F>man of his, whom having entru<U+017F>ted with the care of their education and maintenance, he re<U+017F>olv'd to go and vi<U+017F>it his Si<U+017F>ter at <hi>Vailladolid.</hi> As he was <U+017F>etting things in order for that Journey, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the broad place of <hi>Ville-Franche,</hi> he <U+017F>aw abundance of people, going towards an Inn, which was at the end of it, accompanying two Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in one whereof there was an old Gentleman, and, in that which follow'd, a young Lady, who<U+017F>e tran<U+017F>cendent Beauty, heightned by the <U+017F>umptuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of her attire, ravi<U+017F>hed the eyes and hearts of all that <U+017F>aw her, but above all tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> He was <U+017F>o enflam'd by that tran<U+017F>ient <U+017F>ight of her, that, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering with his Cloak the Order he was of, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Litter, <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported out of him<U+017F>elf, that he reflected not on what tho<U+017F>e who ob<U+017F>erv'd him might <U+017F>ay of his demeanour.

We came by Sea, but had <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of Weather, that we were like to be ca<U+017F>t away <U+017F>everal times. While we were in that danger, my Ma<U+017F>ter, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman much inclin'd to Devotion, made a Vow that if he e<U+017F>caped, through the interce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the glorious Patron of <hi>Spain,</hi> (for whom he hath a particular Devotion) he would vi<U+017F>it the place where his <U+017F>acred Body lies buried, <U+017F>o well known all over the World for the great Miracles daily done there. Being come to <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter continu'd there fifteen days, during which time all things were agreed upon in order to the Marriage. That great affair being concluded, he would needs perform his Vow, and go to Saint <hi>James</hi>'s. His Nephew <hi>Leopoldus</hi> is not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, but <U+017F>tays at <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> to <U+017F>end to <hi>Rome</hi> for the Di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation, for the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> and Signor <hi>Leopoldus</hi> are Cou<U+017F>in-Germans. Thus Sir, I think I have <U+017F>atisfy'd your de<U+017F>ire, as to the que<U+017F>tion you put to me.</q>

                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> gave the Servant very great thanks for the accompt he had given him of his Ma<U+017F>ter, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him he would requite his kindne<U+017F>s, if it lay in his power, and <U+017F>o took leave. This di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd after night, as they walk'd over the Market-place, it being <U+017F>o dark as that the Marque<U+017F>s's Servant could not take any particular notice of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who did all he could to avoid being di<U+017F>cover'd. The accompt he had receiv'd, that the Beauty, which had <U+017F>tollen away his heart at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight, was already engag'd, and, within a <U+017F>hort time to be married,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58823:88"/>
caus'd him to return home a much <U+017F>adder Man than he had left it. This affliction, with the love which he already had for her, bereav'd him of all re<U+017F>t. That very night, he would needs go and <U+017F>ee the Marque<U+017F>s and his Daughter at Supper, yet <U+017F>o as that he might not be perceiv'd by them. The ma<U+017F>ter of the Hou<U+017F>e plac'd him <U+017F>o as that be might <U+017F>ee all at his ea<U+017F>e, yet not be <U+017F>een him<U+017F>elf; and this was to leap out of the frying-pan into the fire. The next day, the Marque<U+017F>s went thence, <U+017F>o as that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> <U+017F>aw not the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> any more that time: nor was he much troubled at it, for having in the night advis'd with his pillow, to find out <U+017F>ome remedy for his di<U+017F>quier, he found it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that he <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>een, either by the Marque<U+017F>s, or his Daughter, or any one belonging to them, that he might the better compa<U+017F>s a de<U+017F>ign which onely Love could in<U+017F>pire him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
                        <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Galicia</hi> is very full of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and con<U+017F>equently the way to Saint <hi>James</hi>'s mu<U+017F>t be trouble<U+017F>ome to travel, <U+017F>o that the Marque<U+017F>s could make but <U+017F>hort Journeys, whence <hi>Don Pedro</hi> inferr'd, that he could not be back in le<U+017F>s than twenty days; pre<U+017F>uming he would make <U+017F>ome aboad at <hi>Compo<U+017F>tella,</hi> to do his devotions, and refre<U+017F>h him<U+017F>elf, ere he <U+017F>et out for his return.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58823:88"/>
known to any, that he di<U+017F>cover'd him<U+017F>elf to none of the Inhabitants, but onely his Land-lord, whom he acquainted with his quality, and the de<U+017F>ign had brought him thither. He was attended onely by one Servant, who<U+017F>e fidelity and courage he had many years experienc'd, for he had <U+017F>erv'd him as a Soldier, and waited on him, from the time of his fir<U+017F>t depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Ville-Franche. Felician</hi> (<U+017F>o was this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant named) perceiving his Ma<U+017F>ter more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy than he had been wont to be, and that <U+017F>omewhat kept him from re<U+017F>ting in the night, for he heard him di<U+017F>quietly turning in his bed, and <U+017F>ighing ever and anon, he imagin'd that the cau<U+017F>e of his di<U+017F>turbance was not at <hi>Pontferrada,</hi> ina<U+017F>much as if it had been, he would not have fail'd, night or day, to di<U+017F>cover by his vi<U+017F>its, what could not be known by his di<U+017F>quiets and <U+017F>ighs. Thus this di<U+017F>creet Lover not di<U+017F>covering any thing of his <U+017F>ecret pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <hi>Felician</hi> could not ghe<U+017F>s at the occa<U+017F>ions which bred <U+017F>uch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>traction in his mind: nay though he did all lay in his power to pry into it, yet could he never meet with any <U+017F>atisfaction. One day, finding his Ma<U+017F>ter all alone, and not able to endure that re<U+017F>erv'dne<U+017F>s in him any longer, he thus <U+017F>poke to him.</p>

Sure they proceed from Love, or I am mightily mi<U+017F>taken. You clo<U+017F>e not your eyes all night, and <U+017F>pend the day in retirement, avoiding all <U+017F>ociety, and giving your <U+017F>elf up to perpetual <U+017F>olitude, and melancholy; which I am extremely troubled to <U+017F>ee. You have left your Country, telling your friends that you were going to Court; whereas you continue in an ob<U+017F>cure place, where you are afraid to be known. 'Tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear grieving at it, as long as I am ignorant of the cau<U+017F>e thereof. Pardon my curio<U+017F>ity, Sir, which however impertinent, is an argument of my faith and readine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>erve you.

I have hitherto kept my <U+017F>elf within tho<U+017F>e bounds, and have <U+017F>o liv'd with you as that I fear not any reproach you can make me. But now at la<U+017F>t, my ancient fidelity gives me the boldne<U+017F>s to ask you, what bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s may have brought you to this place; what occa<U+017F>ions your di<U+017F>quiet, and what you intend to do in this ob<U+017F>cure Inn, where you admit not of any enjoyments? Have you a greater confidence of the happy Ma<U+017F>ter of this Hou<U+017F>e, whom you have known but within the<U+017F>e four days, than of an old Servant, of who<U+017F>e zeal and fidelity

It is a very hard thing, not to <U+017F>ay impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that any man <U+017F>hould, in the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>al of him<U+017F>elf, take a cour<U+017F>e contrary to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him by Heaven; though it be <U+017F>aid, that a wi<U+017F>e man <U+017F>hall have dominion over the Stars, that is (as A<U+017F>trologers expound it) humane Prudence <U+017F>hall elude the decrees of Fate. I am born to love a Beauty, which <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing my heart, hath withall po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd it <U+017F>elf of all the faculties of my Soul. I find my <U+017F>elf no longer Ma<U+017F>ter of my own liberty, that I am not able to make the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of my will, and <U+017F>o it were a madne<U+017F>s for me, to oppo<U+017F>e the inclination, whereto the <U+017F>overeign Powers have made me <U+017F>ubject. I <U+017F>uffer my <U+017F>elf to be fooli<U+017F>hly carri'd away by my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, though I know well enough that I attempt a thing ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and beyond my <U+017F>trength. This is the cau<U+017F>e of my di<U+017F>quiet, mu<U+017F>ing, and melancholy, <U+017F>pending the nights without re<U+017F>t, and the day in <U+017F>olitude, <U+017F>uffering a thou<U+017F>and a<U+017F>flictions which I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s, and loving where I am not to hope the lea<U+017F>t return of Love, by rea<U+017F>on of an invincible ob<U+017F>tacle that lies in my way. This is that de<U+017F>troys my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58823:90"/>
and poi<U+017F>ons all my joy. I have <U+017F>een that divine Beauty, that mortal Angel, that prodigy of miracles, who pa<U+017F>s'd through our Town with her Father the Marque<U+017F>s <hi>Rodolfo:</hi> the excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments <U+017F>he is Mi<U+017F>tris of, and which thou mai<U+017F>t have admir'd as well as my <U+017F>elf, are all the excu<U+017F>e I can alledge for the blindne<U+017F>s of my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; but they feed it not with any hope. There is an ob<U+017F>tacle lies between me and the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of her, which I <U+017F>hall find it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to remove. This tran<U+017F>cend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Beauty is already made <U+017F>ure to a Gentleman of great worth, who is her Cou<U+017F>in-germane, named <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> and me-thinks I <U+017F>ee her ready to join hands with him. I hear <U+017F>uch high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of his excellent parts, that I find the little hope I had ready to leave me. I love her, or to <U+017F>ay better, I adore her, and if I may judge by the pre<U+017F>ent agitations of my heart, I may <U+017F>ay, it will never be di<U+017F>engag'd from the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion I have for her. I know it is madne<U+017F>s in me to think of her, and that I cannot, without extravagance, ever hope <U+017F>he may be mine, to the di<U+017F>appointment of a young Lord, who, with the advantages of bloud, hath all tho<U+017F>e of nature. Nay I think it almo<U+017F>t im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to find out <U+017F>ome means to acquaint her with my Love, and to get a Letter convey'd to her. I know that the hou<U+017F>es of <hi>O<U+017F>orio, Toledo, Astorga,</hi> and <hi>Ville-Franche,</hi> whence I derive my extraction, are not inferiour to tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Rodolfo</hi> or <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> and con<U+017F>equently that I am as nobly de<U+017F>cended as <U+017F>he is; that would not be the greate<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>tacle, if I could but make my <U+017F>elf known at Court. I hear that <U+017F>he intends thither, when <U+017F>he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58823:90"/>
returns from her pilgrimage; I have but three months to carry on this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, which is the time requi<U+017F>ite to get the di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation from <hi>Rome.</hi> I have a long time con<U+017F>ider'd with my <U+017F>elf of the means, how I might get acce<U+017F>s to her, and that I conceive the mo<U+017F>t likely to take, is to counterfeit, what indeed is but too real, a certain di<U+017F>traction of mind. By acting the mad-man's part, I might <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e my extravagancies, as that the Father, pleas'd with my humour, may haply carry me along with him to the Court. This certainly is a de<U+017F>ign fanta<U+017F>tick enough, and not onely contrary to my quality, but ab<U+017F>olutely oppo<U+017F>ite to the opinion I <U+017F>hould endeavour to rai<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf in the world. I have a certain confidence, that at Court I <U+017F>hall be known to very few, becau<U+017F>e I have been a long time out of <hi>Spain.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, the habit I will put on, being altogether extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, I <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>o di<U+017F>guis'd, that my neare<U+017F>t friends and relations will hardly know me. If, by this means, I can get into the Marque<U+017F>s's hou<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hall hope the plot will take. For I have heard this Lady is not fully <U+017F>atisfi'd with the marriage, having under<U+017F>tood that her Cou<U+017F>in is a per<U+017F>on of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd life, and inclin'd to Women; and that <U+017F>he admits of his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es onely out of obedience to her Father. I have communicated my de<U+017F>ign to the Ma<U+017F>ter of the hou<U+017F>e, as being a di<U+017F>creet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, who may <U+017F>erve me, and puts me in hope to get me into the Marque<U+017F>s's <U+017F>ervice, when he comes to give him an account of my plea<U+017F>ant extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, as we have already agreed together. Thus, my dear <hi>Felician,</hi> have I given thee a faithful cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58823:91"/>
of my <U+017F>elf, thou know'<U+017F>t now as much as I do, as well of my affliction, as my love; mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t not the confidence I have of thee, and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me with all thy wit and indu<U+017F>try, or expect ere long to be a witne<U+017F>s of my departure out of this world.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Felician,</hi> out of compliance with his Ma<U+017F>ter, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the project, though he doubted much the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of it. He <U+017F>aw his Ma<U+017F>ter was too far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ported to receive any prudent advice; <U+017F>o that he promis'd to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him according to the de<U+017F>ign he had laid to get acce<U+017F>s to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and troubled not his thoughts with any thing but how to compa<U+017F>s it. It was his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s therefore to get cloaths made for <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> <U+017F>utable to his extravagance. He put him into a Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ock after the old fa<U+017F>hion, with puffs at the <U+017F>leeves of green cloth, and large skirts, a Cloak <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a Rocket, very <U+017F>hort, and a <hi>Milan</hi> Cap, of green Plu<U+017F>h. Being thus di<U+017F>guis'd, he chang'd his quarters, and went to the Ho<U+017F>t's Brother's hou<U+017F>e, who al<U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity be acquainted with the <U+017F>ecret. All this could not be done without <U+017F>ome yellow pieces, whereof he had brought good <U+017F>tore out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> with <U+017F>ome Jewels of value he had gotten by gaming, at which he was very fortunate.</p>
                        <p>About this time the Marque<U+017F>s, with the beautiful Lady his Daughter, were upon their return from their pilgrimage. Before they got to <hi>Pontferrada,</hi> the beams of his Litter broke, <U+017F>o that he was forc'd to come to the Town on hor<U+017F>e-back, and to <U+017F>tay there two days, while the Litter was mended. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>s took up the <U+017F>ame Inn where <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had lodg'd, as being the be<U+017F>t in the Town. The Ho<U+017F>t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught what he had to <U+017F>ay to the Marque<U+017F>s, for
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58823:91"/>
the furtherance of <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s de<U+017F>ign, <U+017F>oon met with an opportunity to do it. For, as mo<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons of Quality, when they travel, are very inqui<U+017F>itive to know what is rare or remarkable at the places through which they pa<U+017F>s, the Marque<U+017F>s de<U+017F>irous to hear what there might be at <hi>Pontferrada,</hi> call'd for the Ho<U+017F>t. Having travell'd <U+017F>everal times before into <hi>Spain,</hi> he <U+017F>poke the Language very well, was a very <U+017F>ociable per<U+017F>on, and glad of company.</p>
                        <p>The Ho<U+017F>t being come into the room, he began to ask him concerning the Antiquities of the Town, the illu<U+017F>trious Families had liv'd in it, the di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itions of the Inhabitants, the beauty of the Ladies, and <U+017F>uch particulars: wherein the Ho<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfy'd him, giving him a very exact account of all he knew. Among the antiquities and remarkable things of the Town, he came to <U+017F>peak of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> telling <U+017F>uch <U+017F>tories of him as might rai<U+017F>e a de<U+017F>ire in the Marque<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ee him. <q>There is come, <hi><U+017F>aid he to him,</hi> within the<U+017F>e fifteen days, a very rare per<U+017F>on to this Town, fanta<U+017F>tically clad in a green <U+017F>tuff; but there is a greater extravagance in his behaviour than there is in his cloaths, and yet in the height of his di<U+017F>tracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there may be ob<U+017F>erv'd certain <U+017F>hadows of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding and <U+017F>taiedne<U+017F>s which render him excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good company. Being asked by <U+017F>ome of our Inhabitants, who he was, I am, <U+017F>aid he, Son to the River <hi>Sil,</hi> which pa<U+017F><U+017F>es by the walls of this Town, and de<U+017F>cended from one of the mo<U+017F>t illu<U+017F>trious Families of <hi>Galicia.</hi> He expects to be treated with <hi>your Honour,</hi> and <hi>your Lord<U+017F>hip,</hi> in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, though he is known by the title of <hi>Knight of the Noble Order of the Marigold.</hi> The fooleries he tells
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58823:92"/>
to make good the title he a<U+017F><U+017F>umes, are <U+017F>o ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that they force Laughter from the mo<U+017F>t me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. He <U+017F>eldome comes out of his Lodging, feeds high, and we cannot imagine whence he <U+017F>hould have means to live at that rate. He hath a Servant to wait on him, who knows the length of his foot, and complies with him in his madne<U+017F>s, either for his advantage, or that he hath a <U+017F>oft place in his Head, as well as his Ma<U+017F>ter; and I think them both very well worth your notice. I wonder the Knight hath not been yet to wait on your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; for he is mighty de<U+017F>irous to conver<U+017F>e with Strangers, and finds them out as <U+017F>oon as he hears of their arrival.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Marque<U+017F>s was much pleas'd with this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ho<U+017F>t, and de<U+017F>ir'd him to bring him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that noble Knight. The fair Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> expre<U+017F>s'd al<U+017F>o a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee him, for <U+017F>he had been pre<U+017F>ent at the Ho<U+017F>t's di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. He gladly <U+017F>atisfy'd them, being over-joy'd the Prologue of the de<U+017F>ign had taken <U+017F>o well. He went to his Brother's to fetch him, having before told the Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adour, that he mu<U+017F>t treat him honourably, if he expected to make any <U+017F>port with him; ina<U+017F>much as, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly <U+017F>elf-conceited in his madne<U+017F>s, he would be put out of all humour, if he were entertain'd with any di<U+017F>-re<U+017F>pect, or indifference.</p>
                        <p>The Marque<U+017F>s, who was a per<U+017F>on naturally inclin'd to mirth and civility, promis'd him he would ob<U+017F>erve his directions. Whereupon the Ho<U+017F>t marches away for <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who came into the room very humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou<U+017F>ly in his fool's coat, making wry mouths, and <U+017F>ome fanta<U+017F>tick ge<U+017F>tures, the introduction to his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58823:92"/>
extravagance. The Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adour, how <U+017F>erious <U+017F>oever he would appear, as being oblig'd by his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, could not forbear Laughing, to <U+017F>ee him in that equipage, attended by <hi>Felician,</hi> who, on the other <U+017F>ide, acted very well the part had been given him. He went to receive him at the Chamber-door, with this complement; <q>Welcome to the noble<U+017F>t piece of Gallantry that ever <hi>Spain</hi> <U+017F>aw; welcome the mirrour of all the brave Knights that ever were celebrated for their heroick Actions. </q>
                           <q>The News your Excellency tells me, replies <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> de<U+017F>erves not the reward may be expected for it: you are extreamly mi<U+017F>taken, if you think your <U+017F>elf the fir<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e who have admir'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's prodigality towards me in excellent parts and endowments. </q>
                           <q>Give me the favour at lea<U+017F>t, an<U+017F>wers the Marque<U+017F>s, to be one of the mo<U+017F>t faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witne<U+017F><U+017F>es thereof, which no doubt I <U+017F>hall, if you plea<U+017F>e but to honour me a while with your <U+017F>weet company. For as a rich Diamond plea<U+017F>es all the world, <U+017F>o the attractions of your countenance, and the tran<U+017F>cendent in<U+017F>inuation of your behaviour forces the admiration of all that <U+017F>ee you.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was by this time got near the fair Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> whereupon looking with a certain a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment on her miraculous Beauty, <q>My Lord Marque<U+017F>s, <hi><U+017F>aid he to him,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you forbear at pre<U+017F>ent the prai<U+017F>es you are pleas'd to give me, for it were to profane tho<U+017F>e which are due to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creature. I pray let me know whether <U+017F>he be your Daughter, for if <U+017F>he be, you will be much concern'd in the Elogies I <U+017F>hall give this—this—this—(well) Miracle. Her coming into the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58823:93"/>
world was to embelli<U+017F>h our Hemi<U+017F>phere, to <U+017F>upply <hi>Cupid</hi> with fre<U+017F>h Darts, to become the Load-<U+017F>tone of Hearts, the delight of the Eyes, the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Univer<U+017F>e, the ma<U+017F>ter-piece of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the miracle of Nature. By the Noble Order of Knight-wood I am of, I <U+017F>wear, that the very minute I fir<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>t my Eye on this accompli<U+017F>h'd Beauty, I found my heart was grown rebellious, and no longer mine; my will bereay'd of all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and my <U+017F>oul become ab<U+017F>olutely her Slave. In a word, Sir, I think my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>omewhat different from what I was before, and the more I feel my <U+017F>elf, the more I am a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at the <U+017F>trange Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morpho<U+017F>is. </q>
                           <q>The commendations you give me, renowned Knight, replies the Lady, <U+017F>mell too much of <U+017F>lattery: I am confident you do not your <U+017F>elf believe one half of what you have <U+017F>aid, and therefore it will be hard for you to per<U+017F>uade me to it. You con<U+017F>ider not that you act again<U+017F>t your own Sentiment, when you <U+017F>peak again<U+017F>t your Con<U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                           <p>The Kingdome of <hi>Galicia</hi> was heretofore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Counts, and afterwards by Kings. <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domar</hi> reign'd in that time, and continu'd a Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower after the burial of his fir<U+017F>t Wife, by whom he had no other Children but the Infanta, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domira,</hi> who coming to reign after him was called the VVenching-Queen. She fell in love with the Gallant <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> one of the riche<U+017F>t and prope e<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons in the Kingdome. He ever kept about the Court, and was a Kin<U+017F>man, though <U+017F>omewhat afar off, to the King, but his principal Favourite, by which means he had acce<U+017F>s into the Queen's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and got of her that favour whereby Mankind
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58823:94"/>
is propagated. I prov'd to be the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of that amorous Union, and the good hour of my birth happen'd at a time that the King chanc'd to be at his Daughter's lodging. The pains of Child-birth <U+017F>urpriz'd her, and being a Novice in <U+017F>uch adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <U+017F>he could not di<U+017F><U+017F>emble her Labour, even in the pre<U+017F>ence of her Father, who imagin'd it was <U+017F>ome other accident had happen'd to her. Her VVomen holp her to Bed, not knowing the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e that troubled her; but not long after I came into the world, it <U+017F>eems, to run through all the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes that have happened to me <U+017F>ince. Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the world by a faithful Servant, who knew of my Mother's Loves, <U+017F>he took me in her Lap, to be deliver'd to a Brother of hers, who was al<U+017F>o acquainted with the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. As <U+017F>he went out of the Infanta's Lodgings, <U+017F>he meets with the King, going to vi<U+017F>it his Daughter. She was affraid his curio<U+017F>ity would have egg'd him on to examine what <U+017F>he had in her Lap; which made her turn back of a <U+017F>udden, and, by a <U+017F>ecret pair of <U+017F>tairs, go down into the Garden, where having di<U+017F>pos'd me into a little wicker Basket, <U+017F>he put me into the River <hi>Sil,</hi> which ran by the wall thereof, and told the Infanta that <U+017F>he had deliver'd me to her Brother, as they had re<U+017F>olv'd. I was carry'd awhile on the Chry<U+017F>tal waves of that clear River, but at la<U+017F>t, the water growing <U+017F>omewhat rough, I <U+017F>unk, and was receiv'd into the arms of the God of that River, who encompa<U+017F>s'd by his fair Nymphs, conducted me into his own Chry<U+017F>tal palace. You may haply imagine this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e a feign'd <U+017F>tory taken out of the inventions of the Poets; but give
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58823:94"/>
me leave to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s happen'd no otherwi<U+017F>e than as I tell you.</p>
                           <p>I was brought up by the Nymphs in that <U+017F>ecret Man<U+017F>ion, and in<U+017F>tructed by the God of the River, who wi<U+017F>h'd I might prove worthy <U+017F>o noble an edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. He caus'd me to be in<U+017F>tructed in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Sciences, and <U+017F>par'd no pains to make me an accompli<U+017F>h'd per<U+017F>on. I learnt three or four Languages, but particularly the Latin above any of the other. Being arriv'd to the twentieth year of my Age, Love, to <U+017F>hew his omnipotency, and that all places are under his juri<U+017F>diction, caus'd his flames to fa<U+017F>ten on me even through the water. In that Virginal company of Nymphs, there was one, for whom the God of that watery habitation had a particular e<U+017F>teem; and <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erv'd it, for <U+017F>he very much excell'd all her Companions; her name was <hi>Anacar<U+017F>ia.</hi> Her endowments were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and her beauty beyond all compari<U+017F>on. In complexion and <U+017F>tature <U+017F>he came <U+017F>omewhat near this fair Lady your Daughter, and had the <U+017F>ame advantage over the re<U+017F>t of the Nymphs, as the Delphick Torch hath over the other Planets. She play'd excellently well on all kinds of In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to <U+017F>um up all in a word, <U+017F>he was a prodigy of all perfections. I fell <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love with this beauty that I had not a minute's re<U+017F>t, from the time that little Deity had wounded my heart, with the mortal darts of her <U+017F>parkling Eyes. I found it a hard bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to di<U+017F>cover my love to her, in regard I could never meet her alone. She was perpetually haunted by <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e who liv'd in that Chry<U+017F>tal palace; they follow'd her every
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58823:95"/>
where, and would never be out of her <U+017F>ight. But one day, when all the other Nymphs were gone to a Mu<U+017F>ick-meeting, at which were al<U+017F>o to be read certain Lectures of Poe<U+017F>ie, being the ordinary diverti<U+017F>ements of the God of that River, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Anacar<U+017F>ia</hi> purpo<U+017F>ely pretended <U+017F>ome indi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition, to give me an opportunity to <U+017F>peak with her. She <U+017F>ent me notice of it, by one who came to tell me from her, that <U+017F>he kept her Bed onely for my <U+017F>ake, than which I could not have expected a kinder complement from one of her Sex. I went to her chamber, and found her carele<U+017F>sly laid on a Bed of Mo<U+017F>s, exceeding in whitene<U+017F>s the fine Sheets <U+017F>he lay on, and di<U+017F>puting as to <U+017F>plendor and light, with the Sun, who then beheld her. I was <U+017F>tartled at the <U+017F>ight of <U+017F>o many charms, and was upon the point of lo<U+017F>ing all Sentiment, an effect natural enough in tho<U+017F>e who are truly touch'd with love. But recovering my <U+017F>elf a while after, though <U+017F>till much troubled, and my tongue but as it were newly loo<U+017F>ned, I took the confidence to make this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to her.</p>
                           <p>Adorable Nymph, the glory of the<U+017F>e deep Habitations, but the unavoidable Rack of tho<U+017F>e hearts, which are captivated by your Beauty, my <U+017F>oul, <U+017F>ince the fir<U+017F>t time I <U+017F>aw you, is ab<U+017F>olutely di<U+017F>pos'd to <U+017F>erve you; I have no further power over her, <U+017F>he is wholly yours, and glories in her <U+017F>lavery. Treat her as a thing belongs to you, and as I have vow'd her to you with an inviolable fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. You have done me an extraordinary favour in allowing me to declare the amorous pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion I have for you: may I further hope that you will
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58823:95"/>
allay it, and if I <U+017F>hould be admitted to that degree of felicity, <U+017F>hould I not be the happie<U+017F>t and the mo<U+017F>t glorious of all men?</p>
                           <p>The fair <hi>Anacar<U+017F>ia</hi> infinitely pleas'd with <U+017F>o obliging a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and the worth <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erv'd in me, highly honour'd me with her affection, and compli'd with my amorous de<U+017F>ires, in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>weet and melting expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as put me in hopes of the happy accompli<U+017F>hment of my Love. But it was not long ere our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was interrupted by the God of the River, who finding neither of us at the Meeting, came <U+017F>treight to her Chamber, and <U+017F>lunk in <U+017F>o <U+017F>oftly, that he over-heard <U+017F>ome part of our amorous conference; which <U+017F>o incens'd him again<U+017F>t me, that he immediately re<U+017F>olv'd to give a check to my pre<U+017F>umption. He laid <U+017F>iege, with his clear waters, to the chamber of <hi>Anacar<U+017F>ia,</hi> and ere he had quite damm'd up the door, he ca<U+017F>t me out with <U+017F>uch violence, that I was got to the bank of the River. I pre<U+017F>ently heard a voice <U+017F>aying unto me, <hi>Guadomarus,</hi> thou art de<U+017F>cended from Kings, though it be a long time <U+017F>ince they have had Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their hands; Princes of another Family have di<U+017F>plac'd them.

                           <p>With tho<U+017F>e words the waters of the River <U+017F>eem'd to <U+017F>tir them<U+017F>elves into a gentle curl, which being pre<U+017F>ently laid, it became as <U+017F>mooth as it had been before. I immediately found my <U+017F>elf (by what adventure I know not) in a Kitchin-garden, in the mid<U+017F>t of a bed of Marigolds, which I look'd on as a good Omen, and thought my <U+017F>elf oblig'd to derive my name thence. Afterwards, at my bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>m, I took the name of <hi>Peter Gil</hi> of <hi>Galicia,</hi> taking the <U+017F>urname from the Kingdom which had been heretofore in the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ors, who have been dead the<U+017F>e four hundred years, as I have found in Hi<U+017F>tory.

re<U+017F>entments upon his obliging di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which made excellent <U+017F>port for all that were pre<U+017F>ent.

                        <p>The Marque<U+017F>s and his people talked very much of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> wondring at the <U+017F>trange kind of madne<U+017F>s
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58823:98"/>
he was fallen into. He acquainted them with the de<U+017F>ign he had to take him along to the Court. The Ma<U+017F>ter of the hou<U+017F>e where he was lodg'd happening to be then pre<U+017F>ent, told him, that he doubted <hi>Don Pedro Gill</hi> would hardly be per<U+017F>uaded thereto, if the Marque<U+017F>s treated him as an inferiour; for he was mighty <U+017F>elf-conceited, and <U+017F>tood much upon his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but if he were willing, there would ari<U+017F>e an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other difficulty in the manner of his travelling; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, <U+017F>aid he to him, your Excellency going by Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I think he would be loath to go by hor<U+017F>e. <q>We'l find an expedient for that, <U+017F>ays the Marque<U+017F>s, which is, that my Daughter, as his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>hall command him to entertain her at the <U+017F>ide of her Litter; for if his love continues, he will be glad of the opportunity; and he <U+017F>hall have an excellent hor<U+017F>e, richly harna<U+017F>s'd, which I have led after me, to ride on when I am weary of the Litter.</q>

They talk'd of divers things, the Marque<U+017F>s finding he had an excellent wit in his intervals, which ever clos'd with <U+017F>ome plea<U+017F>ant extravagance.

If it be <U+017F>o, give me leave to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e an expedient to you, out of the particular e<U+017F>teem I have for your Signory.

this An<U+017F>wer. <q>No temptation in the world <U+017F>hould have forc'd my removal from this place, but the extraordinary Civilities I have receiv'd from your Excellency.

But the re<U+017F>pects you are pleas'd to have for me, together with this tran<U+017F>cendent Beauty, who, by the forcible attractions of her divine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, draws hearts after her, as the <hi>Thracian Orpheus</hi> did living creatures, <U+017F>tones and plants, by the harmonious <U+017F>ound of his Harp, have made me wholly at your <U+017F>ervice. I <U+017F>hall not trouble either you or my <U+017F>elf to tell you how per<U+017F>ons of my Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ought to be treated, as thinking it enough, that I have already acquainted you with my Titles, and particularly that I am of the Blood-Royal.

                        <p>The Marque<U+017F>s finding him willing to go along with them, all that remain'd to be done was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uade him to do it on hor<U+017F>e-back, which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to do, that he might the better entertain his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s at the <U+017F>ide of her Litter. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> help'd the Lady into her Litter, being proud in his mind at that introduction of his <U+017F>ervice to her, and that he had the happine<U+017F>s to take her by the fair hand, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing his attendance on her from their departure
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58823:99"/>
from <hi>Pontferrada,</hi> till they came to <hi>Valladolid.</hi> All the way along, he entertain'd her with plea<U+017F>ant di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es, intermixt with amorous expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and at every Inn they came to, <U+017F>he fail'd not to give her Father an account of the divertive di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>he had had with <hi>Don Pedro.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The la<U+017F>t day of their Journey, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> would needs feel the pul<U+017F>e of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s as to her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Marriage, and endeavour'd to di<U+017F>cover how <U+017F>he was inclin'd thereto. He brought the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s upon the Stage, <U+017F>o dexterou<U+017F>ly, as that <U+017F>he might not <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him guilty of any impertinent curio<U+017F>ity. It is commonly ob<U+017F>erv'd that per<U+017F>ons any way afflicted are apt to break their minds to any people, but e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to tho<U+017F>e with whom they are familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. Accordingly, to ea<U+017F>e her own thoughts, and <U+017F>atisfie <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> <U+017F>he made him this An<U+017F>wer. <q>Worthy Knight of the mo<U+017F>t honourable Order of the Marigold, I mu<U+017F>t needs acknowledge, that my Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Leopoldus</hi> is a per<U+017F>on endow'd with all the Qualities, capable to rai<U+017F>e a Woman's Love to the highe<U+017F>t pitch, but I have withall di<U+017F>cover'd him to be <U+017F>o fickle, and one <U+017F>o naturally inclin'd to addre<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf to all <U+017F>orts of Women, not regarding whether they be nobly or meanly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cended, that it very much cools my affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and makes me fear his alliance, though I find my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ufficiently inclin'd thereto, could I perceive any likelihood of his reforming him<U+017F>elf of that in<U+017F>ufferable humour. But, far from that, <U+017F>ince my coming into <hi>Spain,</hi> when he <U+017F>hould have endeavour'd to give me greater a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of his affection, I find him as indifferent as to my <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58823:100"/>
as ever: and God knows with what appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ions I am induc'd to conde<U+017F>cend to this Match. For if I am now frightned at the thoughts of his mi<U+017F>-carriages, what mu<U+017F>t I not fear, when he <U+017F>hall become my Ma<U+017F>ter? The obedience I owe my Father, and the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity I find that this Marriage <U+017F>hould be concluded, for the compo<U+017F>ure of <U+017F>ome differences in our Family, make me wholly pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>o content it <U+017F>hould go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. I admit of his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es not without <U+017F>ome violence to my own inclination, and all I can do, is to pray Heaven, that it would in<U+017F>pire him with better re<U+017F>olutions.</q>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> could have wi<U+017F>h'd that <U+017F>he had not been <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olute, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd to be. He therefore, though then per<U+017F>onating a Fool, an<U+017F>wer'd her as a wi<U+017F>e Man, and advis'd her to bear a while with the failings of her Cou<U+017F>in. <q>De<U+017F>pair not, Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid he to her,</hi> but <hi>Don Leopoldus</hi> may become another Man, and that if he be <U+017F>uch as you de<U+017F>cribe him now, that volatile humour will be fix'd in him, when he <U+017F>hall come to be po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of <U+017F>o fair and accompli<U+017F>h'd a Lady. </q>But he re<U+017F>olv'd, upon the fir<U+017F>t opportunity <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elf, to expre<U+017F>s his mind to her in other tearms, and to make a full di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of him<U+017F>elf to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.</p>
                        <p>They came that day to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and <hi>Leopoldus</hi> met them half a days Journey <U+017F>hort of it. He was very kindly receiv'd both of the Marque<U+017F>s and his Daughter, whereat the di<U+017F>guis'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was not a little troubled: for finding <hi>Don Leopoldus</hi> a very graceful per<U+017F>on, he began to entertain <U+017F>ome doubts of the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of his enterprize. The Marque<U+017F>s
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58823:100"/>
thought fit to make him acquainted with <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that, by the Character he gave him, he might accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly treat him. <q>Nephew, <U+017F>aid he to him, I pray take notice of this noble Cavalier, who hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured us with his company from <hi>Galicia,</hi> for his per<U+017F>on, and the rare qualities he is Ma<U+017F>ter of are <U+017F>uch as de<U+017F>erve the highe<U+017F>t e<U+017F>teem.

                        <p>This de<U+017F>cription made <hi>Don Leopoldus</hi> take a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and he doubted not, as well by his accoutrements, as by the fanta<U+017F>tick title he had taken to him<U+017F>elf, to conclude him a mo<U+017F>t tran<U+017F>cendent Extravagant, and that, as <U+017F>uch, they had entertain'd him into their Company.

Nay though I knew all the particulars of that engagement, wherein you rather compli'd with the commands of a Father then your own inclinations, ina<U+017F>much as you look'd on that too happy Kin<U+017F>man, as a fickle per<U+017F>on, unworthy your affection, a truth I have <U+017F>ince heard confirm'd by your <U+017F>elf; nay though I <U+017F>aw the marriage in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner concluded, yet all could not break the re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution I had taken to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf as you have <U+017F>een to traver<U+017F>e it, and fortune now <U+017F>eems to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour my de<U+017F>ignes.

Some little curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<U+017F>ity occa<U+017F>ion'd my going to that door, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my Lodgings and his, and there I came to the knowledge of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, having over-heard <U+017F>ome part of their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> finding him<U+017F>elf pre<U+017F>s'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches on all <U+017F>ides, and withall hearkning to the advice of his Con<U+017F>cience, thought it be<U+017F>t, to follow his Uncle's coun<U+017F>el. He thereupon went with open arms to his true Wife, to whom he once more gave his hand as a Husband, and then embrac'd his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, whom he yet knew not. The Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> thought it a good opportunity, before the whole Company, to give her Father an accompt how <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had fallen in love with her, how he got into his Retinue in the quality of a Jea<U+017F>ter; that <U+017F>he conceiv'd her <U+017F>elf oblig'd to requite the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary demon<U+017F>tration of his affection to her, by an exchange of hers to him, if her Father approved thereof. The old Gentleman had <U+017F>o much mettal left, as to admire the <U+017F>trange conduct of Love in all its operations, and particularly, how it made the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Men mad, and the Mad wi<U+017F>e, making its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of extravagance it <U+017F>elf, to compa<U+017F>s its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns. Without any further demurring, he gave his con<U+017F>ent, whereupon the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> took him by the hand, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was <U+017F>o happy, as, by odd and unlikely means, to <U+017F>ee all his de<U+017F>ires accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>h'd. The <U+017F>olemnities of both the Marriages were put off till eight days after; all the Grandees about the Court came to them. The Balls thereat,

and the Tilting were extraordinary: but what more nearly touches the <U+017F>tory, is, that the King honour'd the<U+017F>e two Cavaliers with great advantages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e of a numerous i<U+017F><U+017F>ue, for which <hi>Don Leopold</hi> needed not much to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi'd him, being the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfi'd man in the world with his choice, whom he infinitely loved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made it appear, that the Inclinations of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons, before they are united by Matrimony, though by <U+017F>ome intervening occurrences <U+017F>omewhat remitted, may yet, by that <U+017F>acred Tie, be heightned into a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vigorous flame of perfect Love.</p>

            <p>THE Novel was lik'd and commended by all that heard it, nay <hi>Rufina</hi> was extremely <U+017F>atisfi'd therewith. Brother <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> who repos'd a very great confidence in her, was nothing troubled that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould over-hear the de<U+017F>igns laid by him and his Camerades to <U+017F>earch tho<U+017F>e places, where they had notice there was anybooty. <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> approved of <U+017F>ome of the Robberies propos'd by them, and oppos'd others, for the inconveniences he found in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof: for they look'd on him as a per<U+017F>on of great authority among them. His experience in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that kind was <U+017F>uch, that he a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd the title of Director, or rather Dictator of that famous Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: in<U+017F>omuch that not any one dur<U+017F>t contradict what he had once decreed. It was by this time grown very late, <U+017F>o that they would not make a Divident of what they had brought in that night, leaving it to be done at the next meeting, and committing it to the cu<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Hermit, who was their very faithful Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.

               <hi>Crispin</hi>'s Companions being gone to their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he thought it incivility for him to do the like ere he had made a vi<U+017F>it to <hi>Rufina,</hi> to wi<U+017F>h her a good night's re<U+017F>t. He found her a little more chearful than he had ever ob<U+017F>erv'd her before, whereat he was very glad. He ask'd her what <U+017F>he thought of the Novel; <U+017F>he told him, that <U+017F>he thought it very pretty and full of diver<U+017F>ion, and that if <U+017F>he might often hear the like, they would procure <U+017F>ome abatement of her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. <q>Take a good heart, Madam, <hi><U+017F>ays the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite to her,</hi> I hope you will here <U+017F>ee an end of your affliction; we <U+017F>hall endeavour to find you all the diverti<U+017F>ement we can, and 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you may not repent your being among us, if you will but remit <U+017F>omething of your re<U+017F>erv'dne<U+017F>s, and lay a<U+017F>ide, as a thing extremely <U+017F>trange in this place, <U+017F>ome part of your mode<U+017F>ty. </q>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> thought it time to alleviate her <U+017F>everities with <U+017F>ome affability, and to quit her feigned grief. From that time, <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to treat the Hypocrite with greater kindne<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>he might the better execute the de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>he had to make a Novice of an old Projector. <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> went to bed, half laid a<U+017F>leep with her favourable looks, and the hopes derived thence, that the Fort would within a <U+017F>hort time be reduc'd, <U+017F>ince he had made his approaches <U+017F>o near, and taken off the Mask of his feign'd Hypocri<U+017F>ie.</p>
            <p>The next morning at the very break of day, <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pin</hi>'s companions left the Hermitage, to <U+017F>eek out their livelihood, at their co<U+017F>t, who lea<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ted them. The Hermit him<U+017F>elf was <U+017F>oon after for his march into the City, to beg alms, where he was wont to receive any. He went to take his leave of <hi>Rufina,</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:58823:112"/>
who de<U+017F>ir'd him to make very diligent enquiry for her Brother, giving him the marks of his face, per<U+017F>on, and cloaths, much different from tho<U+017F>e whereby <hi>Garay</hi> might have been found out. He lock'd the door on the out-<U+017F>ide, and carried away the key with him, which <hi>Rufina</hi> was not much troubled at; for <U+017F>he had brought with her from <hi>Corduba</hi> <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e keys, which open all locks, an invention better than Picklocks, and <U+017F>ome other devices, which <U+017F>he had u<U+017F>ed at the <hi>Genoe<U+017F>e</hi>'s. Thus was <U+017F>he left all alone in the Hermitage, having before-hand appointed <hi>Garay</hi> to come to her as <U+017F>oon as Brother <hi>Crispin</hi> got to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laga;</hi> which he accordingly did, mounted on one of the two hor<U+017F>es he had brought with him. <hi>Rufina</hi> having heard him, open'd the door, and gave him a <U+017F>hort account what trade Brother <hi>Crispin</hi> drove, of his falling in love with her, and how there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable <U+017F>umme of mony in the Hermitage, brought thither the night before by his Camerades. <hi>Rufina</hi> had re<U+017F>olv'd to carry away all the ready mony, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereto, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent away <hi>Garay</hi> back to the City, to get <U+017F>ome <U+017F>leeping-powders, to be admini<U+017F>tred to <hi>Crispin</hi> at his return, that <U+017F>o they might have the whole night to do their work in. <hi>Garay</hi> brought the powder's before <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> got home, for he <U+017F>pent the whole day in begging, and return'd not to the Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage till towards night.</p>
            <p>Being got home, he was very kindly receiv'd by <hi>Rufina,</hi> whereat he was tran<U+017F>ported with joy, for he grew more and more in love with her. He <U+017F>hew'd her what he had gather'd that day, and be<U+017F>ides what had been voluntarily given him, he had very uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably taken, of his own accord, two <U+017F>ilver <U+017F>poons,

and a neck-lace of pearl. The neck-lace he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately pre<U+017F>ented <hi>Rufina</hi> with, and put it about her neck, with a thou<U+017F>and amorous complements. She gave him infinite thanks for his Pre<U+017F>ent, after which they <U+017F>upp'd very merrily together, he ever and anon entertaining her with <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>coveries of his love, whereto <U+017F>he gave him very favourable An<U+017F>wers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ing it <U+017F>hould not be long ere he had of her what he <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ired.</p>
            <p>It had been ordered among the Ferrets that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Hermitage, at the la<U+017F>t Committee, that a general meeting <U+017F>hould be had there that night, as well for the divi<U+017F>ion of the former booty, as the making of new propo<U+017F>als. <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> who was not willing <hi>Rufina</hi> <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een, and expected <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret kindne<U+017F>s of her, thought it concern'd him to prevent it. As <U+017F>oon as they were come together, he found out an eva<U+017F>ion to di<U+017F>per<U+017F>e them. He told them, that he had received notice from the City, that there was a <U+017F>trict <U+017F>earch made for a per<U+017F>on who had trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherou<U+017F>ly murther'd another; and ina<U+017F>much as Sacred places were no Sanctuaries for <U+017F>uch cowardly Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he feared there would be <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ent to the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, and if it chanc'd any one of them <U+017F>hould be apprehended for <U+017F>ome other crimes, he might be <U+017F>eiz'd and carried away pri<U+017F>oner, and afterwards, brought to the Torture, confe<U+017F>s what he had not been charg'd with at his apprehen<U+017F>ion. Per<U+017F>ons of that profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion are commonly <U+017F>tartled at any thing; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they <U+017F>oon credited what their Director <U+017F>aid to them and left the Hermitage, adjourning the A<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embly to the fourth night after. By this means <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spin</hi> was left alone in the Hermitage, with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58823:113"/>
who had promis'd to give him <U+017F>atisfaction that night; whereat he was almo<U+017F>t out of him<U+017F>elf for joy, thinking he <U+017F>hould never <U+017F>ee the hour, that <U+017F>hould give him the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of that Beauty.</p>
            <p>Soon after they went to <U+017F>upper, which was very magnificent, for <hi>Crispin</hi> had brought <U+017F>ome, both wild and tame, fowl, ready for the <U+017F>pit, and a good large bottle of <hi>Malaga,</hi> which is the be<U+017F>t of any wine in <hi>Spain. Rufina</hi> having plaid the cook, and made all things ready, they began both to eat very heartily, their minds disburthen'd of all care and trouble; healths were drunk, <hi>Rufina</hi> out-vying the Hermit at that exerci<U+017F>e, and having the management of the bottle, <U+017F>he took care that <hi>Crispin</hi> never drunk without the powder prepar'd for him. He drunk as liberally as the other fill'd, till at la<U+017F>t, tumbling down under the table, he fell dead a<U+017F>leep, in<U+017F>omuch that <hi>Rufina,</hi> to try whether the potion had wrought its effect, pull'd him by the ears and no<U+017F>e, to awake him, but it was to as little purpo<U+017F>e as if <U+017F>he had done it to a dead corps. With that a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, <U+017F>he went down into the Cellar, which was under ground, and out of certain che<U+017F>ts <U+017F>he found there, <U+017F>he took all the mony <U+017F>he met with, whereof there was no <U+017F>mall quantity. She di<U+017F>pos'd it into bags, which <U+017F>he ty'd with cords, and into long leather pouches, wherein the Thieves had brought it, they having robb'd a rich Drover who was going to <hi>Madrid.</hi> That done, <hi>Rufina</hi> comes out, and, by a <U+017F>ignal, got <hi>Garay</hi> to her, who lay hard by perdue for that purpo<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>They took all the ready mony they could find and put it on <hi>Garay</hi>'s Bay, and got up on the other hor<U+017F>e, and put forward towards <hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

They <U+017F>oon got to <hi>Malaga,</hi> and took up their quarter's in <hi>Garay</hi>'s Inn, <hi>Rufina</hi> not being <U+017F>een by the people of the hou<U+017F>e, that night nor the next day. She knew what night the Conclave of the Hermitage was to meet; but ere I tell you what cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>he took, me-thinks I hear <hi>Crispin</hi> <U+017F>noring, and calling to me, to give an account of him. He <U+017F>pent that night more innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than he had done any one of a long time before, for, never <U+017F>tirring from the place where he had fallen a<U+017F>leep after <U+017F>upper, it may be pre<U+017F>um'd he thought no hurt. By that time the Sun was got high enough to rai<U+017F>e the flies from creeping to flying, he awoke, having not the lea<U+017F>t apprehen<U+017F>ion of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him in the night. He call'd <hi>Rufina,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o far, that by his exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive <U+017F>leepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s he had mi<U+017F>s'd the opportunity he had <U+017F>o much wi<U+017F>h'd for; but all his calling was to no purpo<U+017F>e. He <U+017F>ought her all about the hou<U+017F>e, in the Church, in the Cellar, and not finding her, he went out into the fields to look for her, thinking <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mu<U+017F>t needs happen to her, when he found all the doors lock'd. He made a <U+017F>econd <U+017F>earch for her, but finding the che<U+017F>ts open'd, and the bags of white and yellow pieces di<U+017F>lodg'd, he was convinc'd of his being robb'd, and that the poor innocent woman, frightned by the thieves, had made her e<U+017F>cape, and lay lurking <U+017F>omewhere about the neighbouring fields,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58823:114"/>
ina<U+017F>much as <U+017F>he would not venture to go far in a dark night. He <U+017F>ought after her till he grew weary, but <U+017F>he was got far enough out of his reach. At la<U+017F>t, hearing no account of her, it came into his mind that <U+017F>he might be guilty of the robbery; which <U+017F>truck him <U+017F>o to the heart that he was ready to hang him<U+017F>elf, to think that <U+017F>o famous a Rogue, and one that had been, for <U+017F>o many years, the Dictator of a Crew of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>ely trapann'd by a woman; and then he inferr'd that all <U+017F>he had done was onely to bring him into the noo<U+017F>e. However, he went that day, as he was wont to do, to <hi>Malaga,</hi> to try if he might find her in the City. He met <hi>Garay,</hi> but having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <U+017F>een him before, he was never the nearer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> and <hi>Garay</hi> had <U+017F>et things in order for their departure to <hi>Ca<U+017F>teel;</hi> but <U+017F>he would not go till <U+017F>he had <U+017F>erv'd the hyppocritical Hermit <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>curvy trick as that <U+017F>he might never fear any requital from him. She knew the time of their meeting at the Hermitage, a place intended for other u<U+017F>es than to be the Rendezvous of a pack of high-way-men and hou<U+017F>e-breakers. That they might be all found to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to receive the cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ement due for their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, <U+017F>he writ a Letter to one of the Magi<U+017F>trates, acquainting him with the time, when, and the place where he <U+017F>hould find the Malefactors, and how they might be taken. That done, <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi> took their way for <hi>Toledo,</hi> towards which place, we <U+017F>hall leave them on their way, to give an account what was done upon the Letter. As <U+017F>oon as it was night, the Magi<U+017F>trate, attended by <U+017F>ome of his men, went to the Hermitage, be<U+017F>ieg'd it, and got in. He found in the fir<U+017F>t place <hi>Crispin,</hi> little thinking to receive

<U+017F>uch a vi<U+017F>it: yet was it <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable as to the pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ecuring of his life; for they were beginning to <U+017F>quabble about the mony lo<U+017F>t, and the others charg'd <hi>Crispin</hi> with treachery, and 'tis likely he had had the wor<U+017F>e among them, being but one to three. Having <U+017F>ecur'd him, they <U+017F>earch'd the whole hou<U+017F>e, and at la<U+017F>t, went into the Cellar, where they found his Companions, as al<U+017F>o ladders of cords, pick-locks, iron-crows, and all the other engines fit for Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of their profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion. They al<U+017F>o <U+017F>earch'd the che<U+017F>ts, in which they found <U+017F>everal pieces of Plate, and other things of value, undeniable demon<U+017F>trations of the devout exerci<U+017F>es of that vertuous company. They were all taken and brought away Pri<U+017F>oners. <hi>Crispin</hi> him<U+017F>elf was <U+017F>o much at a lo<U+017F>s, that he knew not what An<U+017F>wer to make to what was ask'd him. Whereupon one of the Officers made him this comfortable di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e: <q>Ungracious and unfortunate man, vile Hypocrite, who, cover'd with the cloak of <U+017F>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, do<U+017F>t commit <U+017F>uch robberies! How will the world be <U+017F>urpriz'd to find it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>taken in thee?

            <p>With the<U+017F>e ju<U+017F>t reproaches, he carried them away to the City, where they were condemn'd to die, all the others having, upon the Rack, confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>everal crimes, charging <hi>Crispin</hi> to have been the man, who gave them intelligence of the robberies, that were to be committed, and many times open'd the door for the better execution thereof.

She <U+017F>oon became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many of her own Sex, who took for Gold all that Gli<U+017F>ter'd in that <U+017F>ubtle Woman. Going every day to hear Ma<U+017F>s in the great Church, it could not be long ere <U+017F>he was ob<U+017F>erv'd by <U+017F>ome of the young <hi>Gallantillos</hi> of the City, who, having di<U+017F>patch'd their Devotions, <U+017F>pend <U+017F>ome time in contemplations of the Ladies who may be pre<U+017F>ent. Accordingly, <U+017F>he being noted to be one newly come to <hi>Toledo,</hi> and withall very hand<U+017F>ome, there wanted not tho<U+017F>e who began to Langui<U+017F>h for her, and make their Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to her.</p>

            <p>Finding him<U+017F>elf once more at liberty, he left <hi>Malaga,</hi> and got into a Wood, not far from the City, where he continu'd till Night, and then he
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58823:117"/>
went to the Hermitage, where he had Liv'd many years in the reputation of a good Chri<U+017F>tian, and a per<U+017F>on of a very exemplary Life. As <U+017F>oon as he was convicted of the crimes laid to his charge, there was put into his place a very Religious man, who went about to <U+017F>everal Churches, begging alms, to build a little Ho<U+017F>pital there. He was not as yet fully <U+017F>etled in the Hermitage, the place being not yet furni<U+017F>h'd. <hi>Crispin</hi> got thither in the night, and oppo<U+017F>ite to the South-<U+017F>ide of it found a place, where he had laid up <U+017F>omewhat again<U+017F>t a Rainy day. Breaking up the ground with a Hoe he had left in the Wood, he came at la<U+017F>t to a little Earthen pot, wherein was a Bagg, and in that all the Money he had re<U+017F>erv'd, of all the Robberies he had been engag'd in; for he ever had two <U+017F>hares of the Booty, for his two Offices of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, and Concealer, of the good Company which frequented the Hermitage.</p>
            <p>With that Summ, which might amount to five or <U+017F>ix hundred pounds <U+017F>terling, all in Gold, he went to the City of <hi>Jaën,</hi> where he had a friend of the <U+017F>ame profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion. This friend of his had heard of his e<U+017F>cape out of Pri<U+017F>on, whereat he had been not a little troubled, ina<U+017F>much as he might have made <U+017F>ome commemoration of his Camerade upon the Rack, with whom he had been engag'd in <U+017F>everal Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries. He was very glad to <U+017F>ee <hi>Crispin</hi> at liberty, in hopes of his direction and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance in <U+017F>ome new enterpri<U+017F>es. <hi>Crispin</hi> was but poorly accoutred, as having been uncas'd of the Hermit's habit, which he had <U+017F>hewn him<U+017F>elf unworthy of; but the Bagg he had <U+017F>o well Lin'd was a <U+017F>overaign remedy again<U+017F>t Nakedne<U+017F>s. He gave his companion Money to buy
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58823:117"/>
him a Light-colour'd <U+017F>uit, and having taken off his long Beard, he put on a Periwig, which, with a Sword by his <U+017F>ide, di<U+017F>guis'd him <U+017F>o that he <U+017F>eem'd to be quite another Man, and not to be ea<U+017F>ily known even by tho<U+017F>e who had been particularly acquainted with him. In that Equipage he continu'd <U+017F>ome time at <hi>Jaen,</hi> till there happen'd an opportunity to commit a con<U+017F>iderable Robbery at <hi>Andujar,</hi> which was very faithfully divided between him and his companion. But fearing the per<U+017F>on who had been Robb'd would make a diligent <U+017F>earch after them, <hi>Crispin</hi> thought it their be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to be gone thence in time, the adventure at <hi>Malaga</hi> being <U+017F>till fre<U+017F>h in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>They took into their company a third per<U+017F>on, whom they met with by chance, a young Man, born and bred in the City of <hi>Valentia;</hi> and they came to <hi>Toledo,</hi> where they had never been but as they travell'd through it. The new Camerade they had taken in, was call'd <hi>Jaimo,</hi> a poor Rope-maker's Son of <hi>Valentia,</hi> who, for <U+017F>ome rogui<U+017F>h exploits he had done there, which brought him <U+017F>ome Money, had been oblig'd to ab<U+017F>ent him<U+017F>elf thence for <U+017F>ome years. He was a hand<U+017F>ome, fair-hair'd, <U+017F>prightly young Man, and be<U+017F>ides the accompli<U+017F>hments of his per<U+017F>on, he had an excellent Wit, and was not inferiour, in <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, to either <hi>Crispin</hi> or his Camerade.</p>
            <p>This young <hi>Adonis</hi> went very Gallantly, upon their charges who either were ignorant or mindle<U+017F>s of the old Proverb, <hi>Fast bind, fast find.</hi> He had the art to transform into the current Mode all the Cloaths he got by <U+017F>light of hand, and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>guis'd them by changing the Laces and Trimming, that the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58823:118"/>
very Owners could not have known them. On a certain Fe<U+017F>tival day, he put on a very Rich <U+017F>uit, and went along with <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> to Ma<U+017F>s, in the great Church, and into the <U+017F>ame Chappel, where <hi>Rufina</hi> was at her Devotions, under the name of <hi>Donna Emerentiana.</hi> Though, as I told you, <U+017F>he was in a Widdow's habit, <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> knew her at the fir<U+017F>t blu<U+017F>h, and was not a little glad to <U+017F>ee her. He kept him<U+017F>elf from her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for fear of being di<U+017F>cover'd, though there was no great fear of it, as he was then accoutred. He <U+017F>hew'd <hi>Rufina</hi> to his Camerade <hi>Don Jaimo,</hi> who was infinitely taken with her; and having de<U+017F>ir'd him to dogg her, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he might not perceive it, he did it <U+017F>o cunningly, that he kept his Eye on her, though <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to look another way, till he <U+017F>aw her go into her Hou<U+017F>e. He was very glad to hear by the Neighbours, that <U+017F>he Liv'd there, and that in great Reputation, under the name of <hi>Donna Emerentiana de Menezez,</hi> lately come from <hi>Badajos,</hi> with her Father, to live at <hi>Toledo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crispin</hi> had a devilli<U+017F>h pique again<U+017F>t her, for the <U+017F>curvy trick <U+017F>he had <U+017F>hewn him at <hi>Malaga,</hi> and heartily <U+017F>wore, that <U+017F>ince he had <U+017F>o fortunately di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd her, he would not leave <hi>Toledo,</hi> ere he had call'd her to an accompt for the Money <U+017F>he had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away from the Hermitage, together with the intere<U+017F>t, and all the charges of his Impri<U+017F>onment. To compa<U+017F>s his de<U+017F>ign, he in<U+017F>tructed <hi>Jaimo</hi> what he had to do, and whom he <U+017F>hould repre<U+017F>ent, without making a real di<U+017F>covery of him<U+017F>elf to her. It was not long ere an opportunity offer'd it <U+017F>elf to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecute the de<U+017F>ign they had agreed upon. One even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about an hour before night, there chanc'd to be a

quarrel in the Street, where <hi>Rufina</hi> liv'd, wherein there were two Men wounded. The Officers of Ju<U+017F>tice pre<U+017F>ently came in, and carried the wounded to their Hou<U+017F>es to be dre<U+017F>s'd, and <U+017F>ecur'd <U+017F>ome others that happen'd to be then in the <U+017F>treet, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing engag'd in the quarrel; which occa<U+017F>ion'd others to run for't, it being no great plea<U+017F>ure to come into trouble and re<U+017F>traint for another Man's crime.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crispin</hi>'s plot took its ri<U+017F>e from that Quarrel. <hi>Jaimo,</hi> in<U+017F>tructed by that <U+017F>ubtle Hypocrite what he had to do, had taken the Cro<U+017F>s of Knight of the Order of <hi>Monte<U+017F>a,</hi> an honour be<U+017F>tow'd by the King onely on the natural Inhabitants of the Kingdome of <hi>Valentia;</hi> and to that purpo<U+017F>e he had gotten a very light hand<U+017F>ome black <U+017F>uit made him. In this Equipage, being come to <hi>Rufina</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, and having given his Cloak to <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> he drew his Sword, and went in, acting the part of a Man much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd. Finding the door which led up <U+017F>tairs open, he goes up, and came into the room where the jovial Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was with her Maids. They were a little <U+017F>tartled to <U+017F>ee a Man coming in to them with his Sword drawn, without a Cloak, and in a manner frightned out of his Wits. <hi>Rufina</hi> ro<U+017F>e from the place where <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ate, and found the Impo<U+017F>tor in the po<U+017F>ture of a <U+017F>uppliant, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf to her in the<U+017F>e words. <q>If compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion be not at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance from <U+017F>o beautiful a countenance, be pleas'd, Madam, to let your Hou<U+017F>e be my Sanctuary again<U+017F>t the Officers of Ju<U+017F>tice by whom I am pur<U+017F>u'd. That I have Kill'd a man, I mu<U+017F>t acknowledge, but it was in my own defence, in this <U+017F>treet, where

he had <U+017F>et upon me with advantage. The Officers per<U+017F>uing me at the heels, I had infallibly been taken, had I not very courageou<U+017F>ly made my party good, by laying two of the mo<U+017F>t forward with their Bellies to the Sun, who with the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary had me in a manner by the Collar. I e<U+017F>cap'd from the re<U+017F>t, by the pure activity of my Leggs; for it is prudence for a Man to give way to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate, whom he is oblig'd to re<U+017F>pect. But they per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting <U+017F>till in the pur<U+017F>uit, I found your Hou<U+017F>e open for my <U+017F>afety, and I have taken the boldne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>hutting the door after me, to come up into your Chamber. I therefore mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you Madam, if it may be done without your incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, that you would di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e me into <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret corner of your Hou<U+017F>e, till the people now in the <U+017F>treet be di<U+017F>pers'd, and that I may <U+017F>afely go hence. But if my pre<U+017F>umption puts you to any di<U+017F>traction, or give you any trouble, you need onely give me the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ignal, and I will immediately go out into the Street, though I were <U+017F>ure to leave my Life in it, as choo<U+017F>ing rather the horrours of Impri<U+017F>onment, than to be over-importunate to <U+017F>o fair a Lady.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We have already given a de<U+017F>cription of this fine Orator. <hi>Rufina</hi> look'd very earne<U+017F>tly upon him; and <U+017F>he who never had lov'd any thing comparably to Money, immediately found her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible of an inclination towards that young Man, who <U+017F>eem'd to her as eloquent as <U+017F>he had thought him hand<U+017F>ome. Whereupon <U+017F>he return'd him this An<U+017F>wer. <q>You have done me but ju<U+017F>tice, Sir, when you thought me <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of honour and compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; per<U+017F>ons

I pre<U+017F>ume, by what I <U+017F>ee of you, that you are a per<U+017F>on of Quality; and therefore <U+017F>ympathizing with your affliction, I heartily proffer you my Hou<U+017F>e, to continue in it as long as you <U+017F>hall think fit, to avoid the pur<U+017F>uit of tho<U+017F>e who look after you: for it were not ju<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould fall into their hands, <U+017F>ince, by my means you may be <U+017F>ecur'd from <U+017F>o great a danger. Fear not any thing here; for though the Officers <U+017F>hould come into the Hou<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hall put you into <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecret a place, that they <U+017F>hall never find you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young Spark gave her a thou<U+017F>and thanks for <U+017F>o <U+017F>ignal a favour, which oblig'd her to make him this further di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. <q>You very well know, Sir, by the habit I am in, with what re<U+017F>erv'dne<U+017F>s I ought to live in my Hou<U+017F>e, and yet I freely proffer you the <U+017F>ecurity you promi<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elf in it, till you have accommodated your affairs. But I have a Father, now from home, who will expect an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of my demeanour: and if, at his arrival, which it may be will be this day, he will entertain you with a Room in his Lodgings, as I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he will think it an honour, I <U+017F>hall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. </q>The young Gallant renew'd his thanks to her, for that continuance of her kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es, and he expre<U+017F>s'd him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o gentilly, that <U+017F>he was more and more taken with him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, tho<U+017F>e who were of the Plot, knock'd very confidently at the door, calling upon them to open to the Officers. The family was at fir<U+017F>t a little <U+017F>tartled; but <hi>Rufina,</hi> recovering her <U+017F>elf out of the little di<U+017F>order which appear'd in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58823:120"/>
took <hi>Jaimo</hi> by the hand, and led him into an upper Room which had a double Partition, before which there was a piece of Hangings, and left him there, with an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance it would be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to find him out. That done <U+017F>he went to open the door, and <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> impudently comes in, without the lea<U+017F>t fear of being known, being di<U+017F>guis'd as he was. He was attended by <U+017F>ome Rogues of his Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, who with Lanterns and Fire-arms, per<U+017F>onating the Officers of Ju<U+017F>tice, uncivilly ru<U+017F>h'd into the Room where <hi>Rufina</hi> was. <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> gave her a kind <U+017F>alute, and counterfeiting his Voice <U+017F>uitably to his Per<U+017F>on. <q>I know, Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> that it <U+017F>peaks a kind of incivility, to come <U+017F>o boldly into a VViddow's Hou<U+017F>e; but my Charge obliges me thereto, and therefore you will excu<U+017F>e me. The Lieutenant Criminal hath commanded me, to <U+017F>earch all the Hou<U+017F>es hereabouts to <U+017F>ee if I can find a Malefactor we look for. Our <U+017F>earch hath hitherto been to no purpo<U+017F>e, and we have but this one Hou<U+017F>e to <U+017F>earch; give us therefore leave to look into all the Rooms of it, that we may <U+017F>atisfie our Superiours, and withall our own Con<U+017F>ciences. </q>
               <q>You may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elves, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to them,</hi> upon my word, that I <U+017F>aw no Body come into my Hou<U+017F>e; but, that you may not think ami<U+017F>s of me, or conceive me a Woman to <U+017F>helter Murtherers, and Mi<U+017F>chievous per<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>earch, and <U+017F>ee whether you can find the per<U+017F>on you look for.</q>One of the Maids took a Wax-candle to light them, and they vi<U+017F>ited <U+017F>everal Chambers, yet not too exactly, that the <U+017F>lightne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>earch might be thought a Courte<U+017F>ie.</p>
            <p>That done, he civilly took leave, recommending
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58823:120"/>
the pro<U+017F>ecution of the plot to his Camerade. The counterfeit Knight came out of his hole, pretending an extraordinary gladne<U+017F>s, that he had e<U+017F>cap'd their hands, who <U+017F>ought after him, and in expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions full of acknowledgment, he highly celebrated the favour he had receiv'd from the fair widow. She, who, the more <U+017F>he look'd on him, more and more fancied him, made him a thou<U+017F>and demon<U+017F>trations of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip, a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him he <U+017F>hould be waited on at her hou<U+017F>e according to his worth; and if he would have the patience to <U+017F>tay till her Father came in, <U+017F>he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident he would not <U+017F>uffer him to go out of the hou<U+017F>e that night.</p>
            <p>The Gallant, who perceiv'd the Lady began to grow warm, was the more earne<U+017F>t to beg a leave which he <U+017F>aw would not be ea<U+017F>ily granted him, told her, it would be his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e to take Sanctuary in <U+017F>ome Religious hou<U+017F>e, whence he might <U+017F>end notice to his people at the Inn, where he was; that he was to go the next day for <hi>Sevil;</hi> and that he thought it not <U+017F>afe for him, to go that night to his quarters. <hi>Rufina,</hi> troubled to find him <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olv'd, more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>tly pre<U+017F><U+017F>es his <U+017F>tay, repre<U+017F>ented to him the great hazard he ran, and de<U+017F>ir'd him by all means to <U+017F>tay two hours longer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jaimo,</hi> who de<U+017F>ir'd nothing <U+017F>o much, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uaded to do <U+017F>o. She de<U+017F>ir'd his permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to go and take order about <U+017F>ome things her Father had left her to do, whereof <U+017F>he was to give an account at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. This was onely a pretence to get out, to confer with her <U+017F>lave, in whom <U+017F>he repos'd great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, what cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould take. She took her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another room, and freely acknowledg'd to her the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58823:121"/>
inclination <U+017F>he had for that Knight; that it troubled her to let him go out of the hou<U+017F>e, le<U+017F>t he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his life, or at lea<U+017F>t hazard his liberty: but on the other <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he knew not, whether <hi>Garay</hi> would take it well that <U+017F>he detain'd him, and that he <U+017F>hould be in the hou<U+017F>e all night. At la<U+017F>t, much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the<U+017F>e difficulties, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ir'd her to give her the be<U+017F>t advice <U+017F>he could, and what <U+017F>he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve, were <U+017F>he in her condition.</p>
            <p>The Slave, who was as <U+017F>ubtil a baggage as her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and immediately apprehended, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <U+017F>he would be<U+017F>t like mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uch as promoted her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; <q>I mu<U+017F>t acknowledge, Madam, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her,</hi> that it would argue an exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of nature in you, con<U+017F>idering the <U+017F>hort time you have known this Cavalier, to unbo<U+017F>om your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o far, as to give him a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age into your heart; and I think you would do imprudently on the other <U+017F>ide to per<U+017F>uade <hi>Garay,</hi> when he comes, to <U+017F>uffer his abode this night in the hou<U+017F>e. My advice is, <U+017F>ince the hou<U+017F>e is large enough, and that there are two or three empty rooms, into one whereof he may go through your lodgings, that you lodge him there, and make not any body acquainted therewith. It <U+017F>hall be my care to bring him thither, when I have made his bed, and <U+017F>upply him with all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite, without <hi>Garay</hi>'s knowing of it. You know <hi>Garay</hi> is to be gone within the<U+017F>e two days for <hi>Madrid,</hi> and then you may freely enjoy your <U+017F>elf with this young Gentleman, whom it will be ea<U+017F>ie for me to per<U+017F>uade, that the <U+017F>earch being <U+017F>till about the <U+017F>treet, it is ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that he <U+017F>tay, if he will not hazard his life or liberty. </q>The Slave's

advice was extremely plea<U+017F>ing to <hi>Rufina,</hi> who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd her to go immediately and lay clean <U+017F>heets on the bed, and to put the Cavalier in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the room. 'Twas pre<U+017F>ently put in execution, and not long after, the amorous Widow went by a private pair of <U+017F>tairs, to vi<U+017F>it her Gallant. <q>You will haply wonder, Sir, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him,</hi> that without my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, I have ventur'd to receive you into my hou<U+017F>e, and that in the night: but to <U+017F>ecure a per<U+017F>on of worth, there may be a little breach made of the rules of mode<U+017F>ty. I have thought it mo<U+017F>t convenient, that, as I have been a means of your avoiding the eyes of Ju<U+017F>tice, <U+017F>o you <U+017F>hould al<U+017F>o keep out of my Fathers, to the end you may be here in all <U+017F>afety.

            <p>Upon this the Slave coming in, and giving her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s

an account that <U+017F>he had obey'd her commands, <U+017F>he took <hi>Jaimo</hi> by the hand, and led him to the room prepar'd for him. He found it light enough, as having in the mid<U+017F>t of it a Branch, of Cry<U+017F>tal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were many wax-candles, and a magnificent Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <U+017F>taying for him. He was a little <U+017F>urpriz'd to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>he left him alone, but her excu<U+017F>e <U+017F>atisfi'd him, that <U+017F>he would be with him again, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een her Father in bed. At her departure out of the room, <U+017F>he beheld him with eyes <U+017F>o full of love and tenderne<U+017F>s, that that new demon<U+017F>tration heightned the Gallant into an ab<U+017F>olute confidence of the good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of his enterpri<U+017F>e. <hi>Garay</hi> was not <U+017F>o far <U+017F>tricken in years, but that he had the courage left to pretend to the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Rufina;</hi> he acted the part of her Gallant, and had he not been already married, he would have treated of a marriage with her. He kept his wife at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who, as many others do that are ca<U+017F>t off, and <U+017F>lighted, be<U+017F>tow'd the time of her Husband's ab<U+017F>ence on <U+017F>uch as would accept of her kindne<U+017F>s. Some years had pa<U+017F>t <U+017F>ince he had heard from her, whereupon imagining <U+017F>he might be dead, he had re<U+017F>olv'd upon a journey to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to make a <U+017F>ecret enquiry after her, that, in ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd out of the world, he might pro<U+017F>ecute his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to marry <hi>Rufina,</hi> who was infinitely oblig'd to him. Upon this account it was that he re<U+017F>olv'd his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture within two days.</p>

               <q>My Country, Madam, is <hi>Valentia,</hi> one of the mo<U+017F>t eminent Provinces of <hi>Spain;</hi> you know it well enough by name, and haply are not to learn, that it hath a great advantage over <U+017F>everal others, as well in regard of Nobility and wealth, as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of its climate, and the delightful fertility of its <U+017F>oil. I am of the noble and antient Family of <hi>Pertu<U+017F>a,</hi> well known all over that Kingdom. My name is <hi>Don Jaimo de Pertu<U+017F>a,</hi> and the King, for the many good <U+017F>ervices done him by my Ance<U+017F>tors, hath honour'd me with the Order of Knight of <hi>Monte<U+017F>a,</hi> and the Commanderie of <hi>Silla,</hi> which is the be<U+017F>t of any belonging to that Order. Be<U+017F>ides what that brings me in, I have in other e<U+017F>tate as much as may amount to three thou<U+017F>and Crowns <hi>per annum.</hi> I am the onely Son of the Family, and I made my addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to a noble Lady of the City I was born in, named <hi>Donna Blanca Ceintillas,</hi> of one of the mo<U+017F>t illu<U+017F>trious Families of <hi>Valentia,</hi> a Lady of excellent endowments. I have <U+017F>erv'd her with all the affection imaginable, whereto <U+017F>he gave
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58823:123"/>
me no return, as being pre-ingag'd to another Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, who was al<U+017F>o a Servant of hers, named <hi>Don Vincent Poiadas;</hi> whereupon <U+017F>eeing my Rival pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before me, I was exa<U+017F>perated beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure. <hi>Don Vincent</hi> was a per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>uch an humour, as that nothing would <U+017F>atisfie him, le<U+017F>s than to rid out of the way whatever might ob<U+017F>truct his amorous preten<U+017F>ions. Accordingly, one night, meeting with me in the <U+017F>treet where my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s liv'd, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by three <U+017F>ervants, he <U+017F>et upon me, though I had but one with me. I defended my <U+017F>elf as well as I could, but at la<U+017F>t came off with <U+017F>uch wound; as it was conceiv'd I mu<U+017F>t have di'd of them. There could never be any perfect di<U+017F>covery made of him who had hurt me, though every one <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected who it might be: but the common report coming in to the Magi<U+017F>trate that <hi>Don Vincent</hi> was my Corrival, he was impri<U+017F>on'd; but, having clear'd him<U+017F>elf either by favour or mony, he was <U+017F>et at liberty. Being recover'd of my wounds, and reflecting on the advantage, wherewith my Rival had engag'd me, I thought it but a ju<U+017F>t requital to fall on him, upon the <U+017F>ame unequal terms. I therefore <U+017F>urpriz'd him in the <U+017F>ame manner as he had done me, and the re<U+017F>ult was, that he got off much more wounded than I had been. There happen'd to be <U+017F>ome in the <U+017F>treet, who knew me, and took their oaths again<U+017F>t me, a thing not much practis'd at <hi>Valentia,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the truth is <U+017F>eldom di<U+017F>cover'd by that means. Upon this accident it is, that I came thence, for <hi>Don Vincent</hi> was <U+017F>o dangerou<U+017F>ly wounded, that the Chirurgeons gave but little hopes of his recovery. I <U+017F>aw his Friends were re<U+017F>olv'd to revenge his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58823:123"/>
death, and was afraid to fall into the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice. This oblig'd me to leave <hi>Valentia,</hi> and to come to this City, where I have now been about a month. I have under<U+017F>tood by a per<U+017F>on of this City, who hath corre<U+017F>pondents in <U+017F>everal others, that he whom I had hurt is out of all danger, nay in perfect health, and that the treaty of marriage between him and <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> is concluded, whereof I have a greater re<U+017F>entment, then of having this day met with two men, who hir'd by <hi>Don Vincent</hi> came hither purpo<U+017F>ely to murther me. They <U+017F>et upon me in this <U+017F>treet, one I have mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I think, and by that means made a <U+017F>hift to e<U+017F>cape out of their hands, with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of tho<U+017F>e who came in to part us. I found your hou<U+017F>e open, and being come into it for refuge, I find my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ecure, and that all I have to fear now, is, your fair eyes. Avoiding one pri<U+017F>on, I am fallen into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but I think my impri<U+017F>onment <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant, that, if you di<U+017F>charge me not, I <U+017F>hall continue it as long as I live.</q>

            <p>Thus did the counterfeit <hi>Don Jaimo</hi> conclude his relation, leaving <hi>Rufina</hi> extremely <U+017F>atisfi'd, to <U+017F>ee in that Cavalier, not onely tho<U+017F>e endowments which might de<U+017F>erve love, but al<U+017F>o <U+017F>uch initiations of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as rais'd in her a certain hope <U+017F>he might one day be his wife: which having di<U+017F>cours'd within her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he immediately made him this An<U+017F>wer. <q>Signor <hi>Don Jaimo Pertu<U+017F>a,</hi> I am very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that you <U+017F>hould come to the knowledge of me at <hi>Toledo,</hi> upon <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad an occa<U+017F>ion to your <U+017F>elf; but it abates much of it, that you intend not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon into your Country, for I could wi<U+017F>h

In order to <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>ign, Heaven hath not haply made me hand<U+017F>ome enough; but I dare <U+017F>tand on my good nature, and withal that I have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e wherewith to <U+017F>atisfie a per<U+017F>on of your worth and quality. </q>

Now I wi<U+017F>h Heaven would prolong my Life; for if you approve of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I have for you, as you are pleas'd to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me, in <U+017F>pight of all the <U+017F>torms of my ill fortune, I <U+017F>hall get into a haven where I may defie all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I mean that of your good inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me.

            <p>The<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, and others yet more amorous, pa<U+017F>s'd between <hi>Don Jaimo</hi> and <hi>Donna Emerentiana;</hi> and the crafty Youth had the length of her Foot <U+017F>o rightly, that <U+017F>he was ea<U+017F>ily en<U+017F>nar'd in the <U+017F>ubtle Webb of his cunning in<U+017F>inuations, and made it her main bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to ingratiate her <U+017F>elf more and more with him.

to get her in to Play, and to make pre<U+017F>ents to the Servants, that he might be <U+017F>ure of them when occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>erv'd.</p>
            <p>The day of <hi>Garay</hi>'s departure for <hi>Madrid, Rufina</hi> was taken up with the reception of two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of her Neighbour-hood, an employment <U+017F>he was not at all pleas'd with, for <U+017F>he wi<U+017F>h'd them far enough, and her <U+017F>elf in her Gallant's company. As <U+017F>oon as they were gone, <U+017F>he went to her beloved <hi>Jaimo,</hi> whom we <U+017F>hall <hi>Don—</hi>as long as this Scene of the impo<U+017F>ture la<U+017F>ts. She found him tuning a Lute, which her Slave had brought him; for he was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mu<U+017F>ician, and had a <U+017F>mack of Poetry, an accompli<U+017F>hment not extraordinary in the Natives of <hi>Valentia,</hi> where there are al<U+017F>o admirable Mu<U+017F>icians. <hi>Rufina,</hi> hearing him at a di<U+017F>tance, came <U+017F>oftly into his Chamber, charm'd with the <U+017F>weet harmony of his Lute, which he touch'd with a miraculous dexterity, and being not <U+017F>een by the young Man, <U+017F>he hearkned to him a good while, perceiving he intended to <U+017F>ing a Song, as he afterwards did with an admirable grace, and he had made the Ver<U+017F>es, which were upon the occa<U+017F>ion of his Love. This added to the flames of her affection, which were before grown too violent for to keep within the bounds of mode<U+017F>ty: but what mo<U+017F>t ravi<U+017F>h'd her, was, that the Ver<U+017F>es he had Sung were made for her, and upon the accident which had happened to him.

            <p>In fine, the<U+017F>e and other in<U+017F>inuating di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es <U+017F>crew'd up the feign'd Widdow to <U+017F>uch a height of kindne<U+017F>s, that the crafty companion began to de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t from the enterprize which had occa<U+017F>ion'd his coming to her, and <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her more and more of his love.

His Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was extremely <U+017F>atisfi'd therewith, and referr'd it to him to make <U+017F>ome overtures in the treaty of Marriage, till he came thither him<U+017F>elf, for the further pro<U+017F>ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, he <U+017F>ent him a full procuration.</p>

                           <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> had <U+017F>carcely come to the period of this Letter, but, through the trouble <U+017F>he receiv'd at the reading of it, <U+017F>he fell into a <U+017F>wound, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd therein above half an hour, in the arms of her Maid. At la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he came to her <U+017F>elf, bur<U+017F>ting into <U+017F>ighs and tears; <U+017F>he rail'd at the <hi>Sevillian</hi> Impo<U+017F>tor, but much more at her own <U+017F>implicity, that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o lightly pro<U+017F>tituted her honour to an unknown per<U+017F>on, whom <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange an adventure had brought to her hou<U+017F>e.

<U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>aid of her, that <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>ely affronted by any man. Whereupon with the light <U+017F>he receiv'd from the Letter, of the occa<U+017F>ion of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the per<U+017F>on to whom he was to be married, <U+017F>he put things in order to her removal to <hi>Madrid;</hi> which <U+017F>he might better do than any other, in regard <U+017F>he had not any Kin<U+017F>man near enough to whom <U+017F>he might communicate her intention. She communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated her de<U+017F>ign to <hi>Albert,</hi> an old Servant of hers, who had brought her up from the cradle, and was very glad to wait on her.</p>
                        <p>Upon this re<U+017F>olution, <U+017F>he caus'd two Wagons to be loaden with all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to furni<U+017F>h a hou<U+017F>e fit to receive a per<U+017F>on of Quality, and took her way towards <hi>Madrid.</hi> Being come thither, <U+017F>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her Servant <hi>Albert,</hi> to enquire whereabouts lived <hi>Don Juan de la Cerda,</hi> and whether the young Cavalier, whom he intended to make his Son-in-law, were come from <hi>Sevil.</hi> She under<U+017F>tood by him, that he was not yet come, but that they expected him, which much troubled the Lady, who knew nothing of the accident had happen'd to him near <hi>Ille<U+017F>cas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fir<U+017F>t thing this affronted Lady did, was to take a hou<U+017F>e for her <U+017F>elf, near that of <hi>Don Juan de la Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and order'd <hi>Albert</hi> to live in it as Ma<U+017F>ter thereof. That done, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent him to <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s, to enquire whether <U+017F>he wanted a waiting-Gentlewoman, for <U+017F>he would di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>he might not be known by <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> The bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s had the effect <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired, for <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> was then enquiring for a widow to wait on her, a cu<U+017F>tom much practis'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> where Ladies of quality have <U+017F>everal of them, whom, being Widows, they call <hi>Duennas.</hi>
                           <pb n="255" facs="tcp:58823:132"/>
When this was propo<U+017F>ed by <hi>Albert,</hi> who went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Father to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <hi>Donna Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anda</hi> not onely receiv'd her into her <U+017F>ervice, but her Father, <hi>Albert,</hi> was al<U+017F>o entertain'd into <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s. <hi>Albert</hi> gave his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s an account of his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereat <U+017F>he was extremely <U+017F>atisfi'd: <U+017F>o that having put her <U+017F>elf into the habit of a <hi>Duenna,</hi> <U+017F>he went the next day to pre<U+017F>ent her <U+017F>elf to <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> conducted by her pretended Father, <hi>Albert.</hi> They were both very kindly entertained by <hi>Don Juan de la Cerda</hi> and his Daughter. <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> wi<U+017F>h'd <U+017F>he had not been <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>om, that the Sutor <U+017F>he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected might be the le<U+017F>s taken with her; however, <U+017F>he couragiou<U+017F>ly re<U+017F>olv'd to pro<U+017F>ecute the impo<U+017F>ture <U+017F>he was ingag'd in. <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> ask'd <hi>Albert,</hi> what Country-man he was. He told her that he was born at a place called <hi>Utrera,</hi> near <hi>Sevil;</hi> that his name was <hi>Stephen de Santillana</hi> (by which we <U+017F>hall henceforth call him) that his Daughter had been married to a Merchant of that City, who di'd as he was going for the <hi>We<U+017F>t-Indies,</hi> leaving <U+017F>o great Debts behind him, that all his E<U+017F>tate went to <U+017F>atisfie his Creditors. <hi>Don Juan</hi> hearing that <hi>Santillana</hi> was of <hi>Andalu<U+017F>ia,</hi> ask'd him, whether he had liv'd any time at <hi>Sevil.</hi> He told him, that he had often been in that City, but that his Daughter had liv'd there. <hi>Don Juan</hi> would not at that time enquire any farther, nor enter into any di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him concerning <hi>Don Pedro de Ribera. Donna Victoria</hi> was entertain'd as <hi>Duenna</hi> to <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> who took <U+017F>uch an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to her, that <U+017F>he tru<U+017F>ted her with all her Keys, to the great di<U+017F>content of her other Servants, who had liv'd with her many years. <hi>Santillana</hi> told them
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58823:133"/>
that he had a Hou<U+017F>e of his own, not far from <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s, and a Wife (for <hi>Marcella</hi> an ancient Maid of <hi>Donna Victoria</hi>'s was to act that part) whereupon he had no Lodgings a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd him in <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s.</p>
                        <p>It is now time we return to <hi>Don Pedro de Ribera,</hi> who being recover'd of his fall, came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and lighted at the Hou<U+017F>e of his Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Don Rodrigo,</hi> who was much troubled that he had not been there <U+017F>ooner. He told him the cau<U+017F>e of it, and gave him a particular account of all had pa<U+017F>s'd in <hi>Donna Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria</hi>'s Country-hou<U+017F>e, even to the promi<U+017F>e he had made her, under a feign'd name. <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> ask'd him, what quality the Lady was of, whereto be an<U+017F>wer'd, that her name was <hi>Donna Victoria de Sylva,</hi> and that <U+017F>he was of one of the mo<U+017F>t noble Families of <hi>Toledo. Don Rodrigo</hi> was very much di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfy'd with his procedure, reproaching him with the unworthy action he had done, in abu<U+017F>ing and di<U+017F>honouring that Lady, and that it was to be fear'd, <U+017F>he might hear of his coming to <hi>Madrid</hi> in order to a Marriage with another, and find means to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd for that affront.</p>
                        <p>They afterwards fell into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e concerning <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> told him, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly fancied the Picture he had <U+017F>een of her, but that, with the other things he had been robb'd of, he had lo<U+017F>t it: though he knew well enough, he had left it under the beds head at <hi>Donna Victoria</hi>'s, which troubled him not a little, however he di<U+017F><U+017F>embled it. <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> told <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that it were fit he put him<U+017F>elf into other Cloaths, before he waited on his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and that he mu<U+017F>t keep within doors till they
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58823:133"/>
were ready. Within two days a very fair riding Suit was brought him, wherein pretending he was but newly come to Town, he goes to the Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Don Juan de la Cerda,</hi> by whom he was receiv'd with great demon<U+017F>trations of kindne<U+017F>s. Notice was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately carry'd up to <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> that the per<U+017F>on de<U+017F>ign'd to be her Husband was coming up to her Chamber, where <U+017F>he was with her Maids about her, who had ju<U+017F>t made an end of Dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> coming in, conducted by <hi>Don Juan</hi> and <hi>Don Rodrigo,</hi> was infinitely <U+017F>atisfy'd at the <U+017F>ight of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, whom he very civilly and di<U+017F>creetly <U+017F>aluted, for he was a per<U+017F>on of an excellent wit and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident carriage and demeanour. He found by the original of <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> that the Painter had done his work very faithfully, a virtue not much practis'd by Painters, e<U+017F>pecially upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions as that was. He was ravi<U+017F>h'd, to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o great a Beauty, and <U+017F>he on the other <U+017F>ide was well <U+017F>atisfy'd with the hand<U+017F>ome per<U+017F>onage of <hi>Don Pedro.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There were yet <U+017F>ome things to be done in order to the ab<U+017F>olute conclu<U+017F>ion of the Marriage, at which there was a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s pre<U+017F>ence; whereupon he, <hi>Don Juan,</hi> and <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew into another room, where they lock'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves in with a Notary, and <U+017F>ome Friends, who were to be witne<U+017F><U+017F>es at the Articles of the agreement. <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> continu'd all that time in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with her Servants, talking of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> her Husband-to-be, every one congratulating her good fortune, <U+017F>ave onely <hi>Donna Victoria,</hi> who <U+017F>aying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s ob<U+017F>erv'd it, and being all alone with her, <q>

(that was the name <U+017F>he had a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd) whence comes it, that, while all the re<U+017F>t celebrate the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F>s of my choice, you onely are <U+017F>ilent?

                           <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> had done it purpo<U+017F>ely, in pro<U+017F>ecution of her de<U+017F>ign, and this que<U+017F>tion came as <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably as <U+017F>he could have wi<U+017F>h'd it, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he made her this An<U+017F>wer. <q>As to the per<U+017F>on of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> Madam, there is not any thing to be <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t it, nay he is <U+017F>o accompli<U+017F>h'd, that there is not any thing to be wi<U+017F>h'd in him which he hath not already. My <U+017F>ilence proceeds hence, that I had a particular knowledge of him at <hi>Sevil,</hi> for I liv'd in a Quarter of the City, which he much frequented. I neither will, nor ought to conceal from you the occa<U+017F>ion of his <U+017F>o often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, for it is my duty to be faithful to you, as having no other de<U+017F>ign than to <U+017F>erve you, and endeavour your quiet, <U+017F>o as that you may not live in a perpetual di<U+017F>-enjoyment of your <U+017F>elf all the re<U+017F>t of your days. Know then, Madam, that if you match your <U+017F>elf with <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> you will be brought to a kind of civil death, in<U+017F>tead of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <U+017F>atisfactions of wedlock.</q> 
                           <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> was much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and pre<U+017F>s'd her <hi>Duenna,</hi> to di<U+017F>cover to her more clearly, what <U+017F>he had but too great a de<U+017F>ire to tell her.

Know then, Madam, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> fell in love with a Lady at <hi>Sevil,</hi> one very hand<U+017F>ome and well de<U+017F>cended, in a word wanting nothing but a fortune <U+017F>uitable to her quality. He courted her <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>tly, that <U+017F>he, finding her <U+017F>elf oblig'd by <U+017F>o great demon<U+017F>trations of Affection, Letters, and continual Emba<U+017F><U+017F>ies, attended with pre<U+017F>ents, from <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> <U+017F>atisfy'd his de<U+017F>ires, upon a promi<U+017F>e that he would make her his Wife, whereof there are many witne<U+017F><U+017F>es. But the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was to be kept <U+017F>ecret for a time; for <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Father was then alive, who, having receiv'd <U+017F>ome intelligence of that Love, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd all he could to prevent <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Donna Elvira de Mon<U+017F>alvo;</hi> <U+017F>o was the Lady called. The continuance of his vi<U+017F>its to her produc'd living proofs, which were two Sons and a Daughter, who are at this time with the Mother. When <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Father was remov'd out of the way, (which happen'd not long after) <hi>Donna Elvira</hi> expected he <U+017F>hould make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e, and marry her, but he, for <U+017F>ome time, came not <U+017F>o much as to <U+017F>ee her. What inconveniences <U+017F>he was put to from the time of their acquaintance <U+017F>he knows to her <U+017F>orrow, and I am not ignorant thereof, for I Liv'd near her, and went often to her Hou<U+017F>e. Being now convinc'd that he intended to leave her in the Lerch, <U+017F>he di<U+017F>cover'd the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58823:135"/>
to two Cou<U+017F>in-Germans of hers, who were <U+017F>o en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd thereat, that they immediately re<U+017F>olv'd to oblige <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> by force, to perform the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e he had made to their Kin<U+017F>woman. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> went to a certain Farm he had, not far from <hi>Sevil,</hi> to avoid his Adver<U+017F>aries, who, knowing he went out of the way purpo<U+017F>ely becau<U+017F>e he would not <U+017F>atisfie their Cou<U+017F>in, re<U+017F>olv'd to be the death of him. Things were in this po<U+017F>ture when my Father brought me to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where I have been about the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ix weeks. This is the accompt I can give you of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who mu<U+017F>t not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf <U+017F>ecure in this Court, for the Lady's Kin<U+017F>men, whom I know to be gallant and <U+017F>tout Per<U+017F>ons, as <U+017F>oon as they hear of his being here, will be <U+017F>ure to attend his motion, and revenge the affront done to their Cou<U+017F>in; nay it will be ea<U+017F>ier for them to do it here than at <hi>Sevil.</hi>

                        <p>In the mean time, <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> was left in the

Having opened the pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, <U+017F>he put into it a Letter <U+017F>he immediately writ, and, <U+017F>ealing it up again, came where her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s was.

Her Father coming into the room as <U+017F>he had done reading it, <U+017F>he acquainted him with all that concern'd <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> <U+017F>hewing him the Letter from <hi>Donna Elvira.</hi> He was extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd, to find that a Cavalier of <U+017F>o noble a Family, had abus'd a Lady of <U+017F>uch quality, and that, having Children by her, he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o impudent as to make his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to his Daughter. He forbore reproaching him therewith, till he had better inform'd him<U+017F>elf from a Friend of his of <hi>Sevil,</hi> then at <hi>Madrid,</hi> whom he immediately went to look for.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Juan</hi> was but hardly got out of doors, but <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and his Man came in, for his man having told him that he had deliver'd the pacquet to one of <hi>Donna Brianda</hi>'s Women, he was come to receive it from her, <U+017F>ince it was not brought to his Cou<U+017F>in's, whither all his Letters were directed.

She thought, <hi><U+017F>ays Donna Brianda,</hi> that you had been <U+017F>till with my Father. I ca<U+017F>ually meeting her as <U+017F>he was coming into the room, ask'd her what <U+017F>he came for. She an<U+017F>wering, it was to deliver you the pacquet, I took it from her, and (pre<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that a Cavalier of your age and complexion could not have lived to this time in <hi>Sevil,</hi> and not have an inclination for <U+017F>ome Lady) a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of curio<U+017F>ity and jealou<U+017F>ie per<U+017F>uaded me to open it. That curio<U+017F>ity hath done me a courte<U+017F>ie, and hath <U+017F>atisfy'd me in <U+017F>ome things, which before I onely <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected: and therefore I forbear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iring your excu<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince I have receiv'd <U+017F>o good an information, before I was any further engag'd with you; for had it come too late, I had been ruin'd. Here's a Letter from a per<U+017F>on you <U+017F>hould be well acquainted with; this would have been enough to undeceive me, but it onely confirms a relation I had receiv'd before, upon which I was almo<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd to put <U+017F>uch a check to your preten<U+017F>ions to me, as that you <U+017F>hould have but little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to continue them. Farewell, my pre<U+017F>ence will but trouble you, this Letter will acquaint you with what you are not ignorant of.</q>

                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> receiving the Letter out of her hand was not a little <U+017F>urpris'd, not imagining what might have happen'd to him. He read it, and pre<U+017F>ently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, that it was a trick put upon him by <U+017F>ome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious per<U+017F>on, who was de<U+017F>irous to ob<U+017F>truct his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.

                           <q>I am very glad of it, <hi><U+017F>ays Don Pedro,</hi> for he will find it to be an ab<U+017F>olute impo<U+017F>ture, and that there is not any Lady in <hi>Sevil</hi> that goes under the name of <hi>Donna Elvira de Mon<U+017F>alvo.</hi> But I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, Madam, whether your intimacy be very great with the Lady <hi>Donna Brianda.</hi>

                        <p>While the Letters were carried abroad, <U+017F>he put off her Widows habit, and put on that of a per<U+017F>on of the highe<U+017F>t quality, expecting the<U+017F>e two vi<U+017F>its with the accu<U+017F>tomed ceremonies of <hi>Spain.

                           <hi>Don Juan</hi> came in, and having taken a <U+017F>eat, <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> (whom he knew not as <U+017F>he was then dre<U+017F>s'd) addre<U+017F>s'd her <U+017F>elf to him with this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. <q>I doubt not, Sir, but you <U+017F>omewhat wonder, you <U+017F>hould be intreated hither by a Letter, and that from a per<U+017F>on not known to you. To recover you from that confu<U+017F>ion, I will give you an account of my <U+017F>elf. I was born in the Imperial City of <hi>Toledo,</hi> the onely Daughter of the Hou<U+017F>e from which I am de<U+017F>cended, and Heir thereof. I am of the Family of <hi>Sylva,</hi> <U+017F>o well known all over <hi>Spain,</hi> that I need <U+017F>ay nothing of it. As to my quality, I am to tell you farther, that my Father was, in his time, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with the Order of St. <hi>James,</hi> and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of that of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> with the command of a Troop of Hor<U+017F>e under his Maje<U+017F>ty in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Upon his death, I retir'd to a Country-hou<U+017F>e I have near <hi>Toledo,</hi> where I liv'd privately, contenting my <U+017F>elf with the innocent enjoyments of a Country life, without the lea<U+017F>t acquaintance of any thing of Love, till that, one morning a Shepherd of mine brought to my hou<U+017F>e, two men, who had been robb'd and <U+017F>tripp'd the night before by certain High-way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. I took compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on them, e<U+017F>pecially him, who by his demeanor <U+017F>eem'd to be the Ma<U+017F>ter, and out of two che<U+017F>ts of cloaths my Brother had left, I furni<U+017F>h'd them with two <U+017F>utes, wherewith they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd their nakedne<U+017F>s. They <U+017F>eem'd to be very thankful for <U+017F>o <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable a favour; but the more con<U+017F>iderable of the two hath treated me very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58823:140"/>
which is the ordinary <U+017F>tyle of Courtiers, and hath required my charitable offices onely with flatteries and deceit. I was <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple as to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joll'd, by the care<U+017F><U+017F>es he made me, during four days that I kept him at my hou<U+017F>e, and he prevail'd <U+017F>o far with me, that I was no longer at my own di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al. The reiterated oaths and prote<U+017F>tations of a per<U+017F>on of that worth, rais'd me into a per<U+017F>ua<U+017F>ion that he really lov'd me, and that induc'd me to love him again; to be <U+017F>hort, upon a promi<U+017F>e he made me of marriage, he got me in an humour to grant him the greate<U+017F>t of favours. He made me believe that his going to Court was for the pro<U+017F>ecution of <U+017F>ome Law-bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s that concern'd him very highly. He de<U+017F>ir'd my leave to go to <hi>Madrid,</hi> promi<U+017F>ing to return again in a <U+017F>hort time, but with <U+017F>uch demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trations of love as might ea<U+017F>ily have prevail'd with one who had not fanci'd him <U+017F>o affectionately as I had done. I <U+017F>uppli'd him with all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, and he left me extremely troubled at his departure. Now, by a Picture and Letter he left behind him under the bol<U+017F>ter, I found that the occa<U+017F>ion of his coming to this Court was in order to a marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and that miracle of Beauty, <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> your Daughter. Now our Honour being the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable thing we ought to be tender of, I could do no le<U+017F>s, upon this procedure of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> than re<U+017F>olve to come to this Court, and to apply my <U+017F>elf to my friends, that, by their favour, I might cro<U+017F>s the marriage he is about, and you will find, that I may ea<U+017F>ily do it, if you but <U+017F>ee what Cards I have to play. I conceiv'd my fir<U+017F>t overture <U+017F>hould be to acquaint you with my di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,

                        <p>He thereupon <U+017F>hew'd it to both the Cou<U+017F>ins, who were both at <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F>s that they knew not what to <U+017F>ay, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who <U+017F>ufficiently betray'd his guilt by his a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, but <U+017F>wore withall that he had not made that promi<U+017F>e under his own name, but under a feigned. But <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> knowing all the circum<U+017F>tances of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, was mo<U+017F>t liberal of his reproaches to his Cou<U+017F>in, which rai<U+017F>ing a certain compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in <hi>Don Juan,</hi> forc'd this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e from him. <hi>Signor Don Pedro,</hi> 
                           <q>We find by many expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, that a young Man, once fallen in Love, will do any thing to obtain his de<U+017F>ires. That Love <U+017F>hould overcome you, I wonder not at all; but what occa<U+017F>ions my a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, is, that you <U+017F>hould have the confidence to addre<U+017F>s your <U+017F>elf to a per<U+017F>on
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58823:143"/>
of the quality this Lady is of, and di<U+017F>honour her, without ever con<U+017F>idering, that, in time, <U+017F>he might acquaint her friends therewith, who would be <U+017F>ure to revenge the affront. And what adds to this a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, is, that you dur<U+017F>t do <U+017F>uch an action when you were coming hither purpo<U+017F>ely in order to your matching with my Daughter, for whom, if any credit may be given your Letters, you preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate affection. I <U+017F>ee not how your heart could be capable of <U+017F>uch a competition of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, that you <U+017F>hould pretend the greate<U+017F>t inclinations imaginable for one, and treat of a marriage with another. Being a per<U+017F>on of Honour, I doubt not but you will make it appear in your actions, and that is, that you <U+017F>tand to the promi<U+017F>e you made to the Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> though it were onely out of this con<U+017F>ideration, that it argues a more generous nature to do that willingly, which mu<U+017F>t otherwi<U+017F>e unwillingly be done. The Lady is not <U+017F>o de<U+017F>titute of Friends as you haply imagine; <U+017F>he is now at <hi>Madrid,</hi> come expre<U+017F>ly to recover her debt, which no doubt <U+017F>he will; and her cau<U+017F>e being <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t, 'tis not likely <U+017F>he will want a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. My advice is, that you endeavour to prevent the ill reports which the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s mu<U+017F>t rai<U+017F>e of you; perform what you have promis'd, and let not your Love to my Daughter blind you any further, for I am re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>hut her up in a Cloi<U+017F>ter, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her Life, rather than <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall ever be your Wife.</q>

                        <p>With that he ro<U+017F>e up, and, without any comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, went into another room. <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him, and the two Cou<U+017F>ins, without <U+017F>o much as a word exchang'd, went home, where <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi>

fell into bitter expo<U+017F>tulations with his Cou<U+017F>in, for his engaging him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>o unworthy an action. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had nothing to reply, but that he was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd how that promi<U+017F>e came to be <U+017F>ign'd with his own name, having made it onely under a <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ititious.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In the mean time there came a me<U+017F><U+017F>age to <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> from a She-Cou<U+017F>in of hers, inviting her to a Comedy which was to be repre<U+017F>ented at her Hou<U+017F>e, that night, whereto <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent An<U+017F>wer, that <U+017F>he would come. <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> having made <U+017F>o <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful a progre<U+017F>s in her bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, bethought her <U+017F>elf of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention that <U+017F>hould bring it to an ab<U+017F>olute period, for <U+017F>he had the management of all.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:58823:144"/>
was de<U+017F>irous to prevent the reproaches he might make upon her former di<U+017F>carding of him, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the proffer made by her Woman.

The two Cavaliers kindly receiv'd their Letters, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who being but a little before di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s'd, was re-call'd to joyn hands with <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> and imagin'd it done by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Waiting-Gentlewoman, to whom he thought him<U+017F>elf infinitely oblig'd, and the pre<U+017F>ent he had made her well be<U+017F>tow'd.

                           <hi>Santillana</hi> was di<U+017F>patch'd away with this Letter, and order'd not to deliver it till half an hour after nine, which he did. In the mean time <hi>Don Sancho</hi> fail'd not to come, preci<U+017F>ely at his time, and was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who gave him <U+017F>uch <U+017F>atisfaction as <U+017F>ilenc'd all his complaints. <hi>Victoria</hi> left them together in a room, where <U+017F>he lock'd them in. Not long after came <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> according to the time appointed him, and was receiv'd by <hi>Victoria,</hi> who di<U+017F>pos'd him into a room, without light, alledging it concern'd him, that he were not <U+017F>een; that he <U+017F>hould forbear making any noi<U+017F>e, and that it would not be long ere his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s came to him. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to obey her in all things, and <U+017F>taid there <U+017F>o long
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:58823:145"/>
as that <hi>Victoria</hi> might <U+017F>hift her <U+017F>elf into Cloaths <U+017F>uitable to her quality. That done, <U+017F>he went into the room, and <U+017F>peaking very low, it was no hard matter for her to deceive <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and to make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was very much in his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s's favour.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the<U+017F>e young people thus match'd let us return to <hi>Don Juan,</hi> who receiv'd the Letter from the <hi>Duenna</hi> ju<U+017F>t as he was getting into bed. The old Gentleman was extreamly <U+017F>urpris'd thereat, and going out of doors, attended by <hi>Albert,</hi> he went to the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary's hou<U+017F>e, which was hard by. The afflicted Man acquainted him what po<U+017F>ture things were in; whereupon the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary taking <U+017F>ome of his people about him, they went to <hi>Albert</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, where, after <U+017F>ome knocking, they were let in. They happily had a Lantern with them, and it did them good <U+017F>ervice, for they found the Hou<U+017F>e without any light. They lighted a Torch, and went into <U+017F>everal rooms, in one whereof finding <hi>Don Sancho</hi> and <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary ask'd them what they did there? <hi>Don Sancho</hi> told him he was there with his Wife, which was confirm'd by <hi>Donna Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anda. Don Juan</hi> would have run him through; but the Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ary telling him <U+017F>he was not with the per<U+017F>on he imagin'd, that that Gentleman was <hi>Don Sancho de Leyba,</hi> a per<U+017F>on of great quality and well known about the Court, <hi>Don Juan</hi> could do no le<U+017F>s than approve of their Marriage, though 'twere onely out of a <U+017F>atisfaction, that <U+017F>he was not fallen into the hands of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> whom he hated extreamly, for the <U+017F>trange pranks he had plaid.</p>
                        <p>They went thence into another room, which they found lock'd, and thereupon threatning to break open the door, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> open'd it within, and comes out

            <p>The di<U+017F>guis'd Cavalier was forc'd, upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion, to di<U+017F>cover how it had been re<U+017F>olv'd that he <U+017F>hould trapan her, and not de<U+017F>irous <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue any longer ignorant of the impo<U+017F>ture, <q>My dear heart, <hi><U+017F>aid he to her,</hi> having experienc'd the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s and affection wherewith you have been pleas'd to honour me, I were the mo<U+017F>t ingrateful per<U+017F>on in the world, if I <U+017F>hould keep you in darkne<U+017F>s any longer.

of you, for it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that tho<U+017F>e who have once a <U+017F>ight of your divine beauty <U+017F>hould not love you: I have <U+017F>een it, and, <U+017F>ubdu'd by your charms, am become a captive thereto, my liberty and all the powers and faculties of my <U+017F>oul being ab<U+017F>olutely at your di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al. 'Tis a Victory, Madam, which you might ea<U+017F>ily obtain over hearts much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious again<U+017F>t Love than mine is, which became your <U+017F>lave, upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight of tho<U+017F>e two Suns; and this is a truth I <U+017F>hall never recant while I live.</q>

            <p>
               <q>The meaning of this Preamble is, to induce you to pardon me the offence I have committed again<U+017F>t you. I now ingeniou<U+017F>ly acknowledge, that I am not the per<U+017F>on I de<U+017F>crib'd in the account you oblig'd me to give me of my extraction, though it be true I was born in <hi>Valentia;</hi> but one meanly de<U+017F>cended, yet of people of good repute. My Father got his livelihood by the labour of his hands, and the <U+017F>weat of his brows, being by profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion a Rope-maker. Me-thought I had <U+017F>ome apprehen<U+017F>ions above my condition; and therefore unwilling to fall to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's laborious trade, I went into <hi>Ca<U+017F>teel,</hi> having before been in <hi>Andalu<U+017F>ia,</hi> and I made tho<U+017F>e ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of my Travel and the conver<U+017F>ation I met with, and improv'd the natural Talent I had <U+017F>o well, that I never wanted either friends or mony. I came to this City in the company of a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> who had been a pri<U+017F>oner <U+017F>ome time at <hi>Malaga,</hi> for <U+017F>ome crime he would by no means acknowledge to me. The per<U+017F>on hath oblig'd me, having born my charges all the way; nay more, he hath lent me mony, out of a confidence of the reality I had to <U+017F>erve him, in the <U+017F>ecret trade we drove together. He declar'd his mind to me one
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:58823:147"/>
day, and advis'd me, by <U+017F>ome pretence or other, to get into your hou<U+017F>e, for he knew you had good <U+017F>tore of mony, and was de<U+017F>irous to disburthen you of <U+017F>ome part of it. From the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he made, I inferr'd, that he had been a pri<U+017F>oner at <hi>Malaga</hi> for <U+017F>ome robbery. Now to compa<U+017F>s our de<U+017F>ign, we pretended a quarrel, which <U+017F>hould oblige me to take refuge in your hou<U+017F>e: and in the mean time, you have entertain'd me with <U+017F>uch extraordinary kindne<U+017F>s, and have <U+017F>o nobly oblig'd me, that I find the favours you have done me will fru<U+017F>trate <hi>Crispin</hi>'s intention. And therefore now that I acquaint you with the trick we de<U+017F>ign'd to put upon you, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf I will endeavour to retort it upon him<U+017F>elf, and get out of him what mony he hath, to cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e him for his folly. For heaven forbid I <U+017F>hould prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to a per<U+017F>on who hath oblig'd me <U+017F>o highly as you have done. I have di<U+017F>cover'd my Soul to you, di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me now as you think fit, for I am re<U+017F>olv'd to peri<U+017F>h, ere I ever con<U+017F>ent you <U+017F>hall receive any injury, though I have di<U+017F>claim'd the quality, I had unju<U+017F>tly a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd.</q>

               <hi>Rufina</hi> was extremely exa<U+017F>perated again<U+017F>t <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> not <U+017F>o much for his de<U+017F>ign to be reveng'd on her for the prank <U+017F>he plaid him at <hi>Malaga,</hi> but upon an apprehen<U+017F>ion that he might have acquainted <hi>Jaimo</hi> what kind of per<U+017F>on <U+017F>he was, and what trade <U+017F>he drove. Whereupon con<U+017F>dering that he had <U+017F>o inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuou<U+017F>ly di<U+017F>cover'd him<U+017F>elf to her, and acknowledg'd even to the meanne<U+017F>s of his birth, <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf oblig'd to do the like, and to give him a <U+017F>incere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her de<U+017F>cent, cour<U+017F>e of life, friends, in a word, all her adventures, to her arrival at <hi>Toledo.</hi> But Love and Wine make people talk more than they <U+017F>hould.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58823:148"/>
               <hi>Jaimo</hi> was glad that <hi>Rufina</hi> was no better de<U+017F>cended than him<U+017F>elf: that equality of condition not onely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion'd a greater kindne<U+017F>s, but begat thoughts of a match, between them. They re<U+017F>olv'd to leave <hi>Toledo,</hi> and to take up their habitation at <hi>Madrid;</hi> but <hi>Rufina</hi> told him, <U+017F>he would fir<U+017F>t be reveng'd of <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> who intended to <U+017F>erve her <U+017F>uch a ba<U+017F>e trick. <hi>Jaimo</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it, telling her, that under pretence of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and friend<U+017F>hip, he might ea<U+017F>ily bring him into the noo<U+017F>e, and not onely leave him mony-le<U+017F>s, but al<U+017F>o find him a good <U+017F>ecure lodging, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to revenge him<U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>With this re<U+017F>olution, leaving <hi>Rufina</hi>'s he went to <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> whom he found at his lodging, not expecting to have <U+017F>een him <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon. He was over-joy'd to heat how his Companion had in<U+017F>inuated him<U+017F>elf into <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina</hi>'s favour, whereupon the other telling him, that to make <U+017F>ure work of her, he wanted a <U+017F>umme of mony, as well for expence, as to gain rhe Servants, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tate Hermite an<U+017F>wered he <U+017F>hould not want it. By this means <hi>Jaimo</hi> thought to oblige him to a greater confidence of him, heightning the intended cheat with a thou<U+017F>and oaths of an inviolable Friend<U+017F>hip. Thus was that old experienc'd Turn-key of villany brought into a Fool's paradi<U+017F>e; for, that <hi>Jaimo</hi> might live <U+017F>utably to the relation he had made of him<U+017F>elf, he gave him a hundred pieces in gold, to be di<U+017F>pos'd of as he pleas'd, hoping to have them return'd, attended with <U+017F>ix times as many. He took them out of a bag where were five or <U+017F>ix hundred more, <U+017F>ome part of his former atchievments. <hi>Jaimo</hi> ob<U+017F>erv'd the place, where he put up that trea<U+017F>ure, and <U+017F>wore to him<U+017F>elf, that he would not <U+017F>leep heartily till be had alter'd the property of that bag. While <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> was gone out
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58823:148"/>
to give the Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s order for a brace of Partridges and a Rabet for his, and his Camerade's <U+017F>upper, he went to the port-manteu, wherein the mony was gari<U+017F>on'd, and opening the chain (a thing he could do as clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly as any of his profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion) took out the bag, and di<U+017F>pos'd it into a place, whence he might ea<U+017F>ily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it at his departure. They <U+017F>upp'd very merrily, which ended, <hi>Jaimo</hi> tooke leave of <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> putting him over head and ears in hope, that he would bring his de<U+017F>ign to a period.</p>
            <p>He went <U+017F>traight to <hi>Rufina</hi>'s, who it may well be pre<U+017F>um'd, receiv'd him very kindly. He gave her an account what had pa<U+017F>s'd between him and <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> and how he had with his own mony promoted the de<U+017F>ign he had to chou<U+017F>e him. Being alone with her, he <U+017F>hew'd her the goodly pieces, for <U+017F>he had a great affection to mony of that colour. <hi>Jaimo</hi> repre<U+017F>ented to her, how much it concern'd them to leave <hi>Toledo,</hi> before <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pin</hi> <U+017F>hould take notice of the lo<U+017F>s of his mony. <hi>Rufina</hi> told him, that <U+017F>he knew an expedient for that, which was, to <U+017F>erve <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi> such a trick at <hi>Toledo,</hi> as <U+017F>he had done at <hi>Malaga.</hi> Having thereupon writ a large Letter to the Magi<U+017F>trate, who<U+017F>e province it is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecute <U+017F>uch people, they <U+017F>et things in order for their departure, and met with two Wagons, then going for <hi>Madrid,</hi> wherein they put their goods, taking onely the She-<U+017F>lave to wait on them. They went to the Court, where, as in a Sea, <U+017F>o many Rivers meet, having re<U+017F>olv'd that <hi>Rufina</hi> <U+017F>hould not appear, till they had <U+017F>ome news of <hi>Garay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving them there, let us <U+017F>ee what was the effect of the Letter <U+017F>ent to the Provo<U+017F>t. As <U+017F>oon as he had read it, he went, according to the directions therein receiv'd, attended by <U+017F>ome of his Officers, to <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin</hi>'s
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:58823:149"/>

               </hi> <U+017F>hould make his way into <hi>Rufina</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, and thereby put him into po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of all her mony, was taken in his chamber, and thence conducted to pri<U+017F>on. Not long before, one of the Judges of <hi>Malaga,</hi> had been at <hi>Toledo,</hi> to look for him, and not finding him, had left with the Provo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome ob<U+017F>ervations on his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iognomy, by which, though the habit he then was in di<U+017F>guiz'd him very much, it was more then pre<U+017F>um'd, that he was the per<U+017F>on. They <U+017F>eiz'd on what he had in the hou<U+017F>e, among which he thought the Gold, which <hi>Jaimo</hi> had eas'd him of, had been, for he knew nothing of its departure, which happen'd well for the two Lovers, who were already di<U+017F>lodg'd. The i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of his impri<U+017F>onment, was, that, being put to the Torture, he could not keep his own coun<U+017F>el, and <U+017F>o was <U+017F>entenc'd to receive the reward of his confe<U+017F><U+017F>ions, Hanging. 'Twas Heaven's kindne<U+017F>s towards him, that he <U+017F>hould end his days with <U+017F>ome remor<U+017F>e for his <U+017F>ins, for though that be the ordinary <hi>exit</hi> of <U+017F>uch as engage them<U+017F>elves in that wretched kind of life, yet are there many of them who<U+017F>e guilty <U+017F>ouls, are, by <U+017F>word and pi<U+017F>tol, di<U+017F>patch'd into the other world, without the lea<U+017F>t act of contrition. This was the end of poor <hi>Cri<U+017F>pin,</hi> who made a publick acknowledgment of all the robberies and villanies he had committed, while he was a Hermit, to the great edification of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He was al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erv'd to have this genero<U+017F>ity, that he named not any per<U+017F>on who had been engag'd with him in his de<U+017F>igns; nay though he knew, the pre<U+017F>ent misfortune had been procur'd him by his Friend <hi>Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> yet he Chri<U+017F>tianly forgave him and all the world at his death.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Rufina</hi> and <hi>Jaimo</hi> were married
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58823:149"/>
as <U+017F>oon as they came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> but kept out of <hi>Garay</hi>'s fight. He went <U+017F>oon after to <hi>Alcala,</hi> where he had been told his Wife was, but finding her not, he <U+017F>truck in with <U+017F>ome of his own Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and the re<U+017F>ult was, that being <U+017F>urpris'd in a Robbery, they were all condemn'd to the la<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>ix years recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Galleys. He was brought to the chain at <hi>Toledo,</hi> which eas'd his mind a little, for, thinking <hi>Rufina</hi> had been there <U+017F>till, he writ a Letter to her, de<U+017F>iring her, in regard <U+017F>he had gotten all <U+017F>he was worth by his co-operation and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, that <U+017F>he would have compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on him, and exempt him from that penance, by buying a Slave in his <U+017F>tead, a thing commonly practis'd. The Beater enquires for <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina,</hi> where he had directed, but the Neighbours told him, that <U+017F>he had left <hi>Toledo;</hi> <U+017F>o that hone<U+017F>t <hi>Garay,</hi> burthen'd with Iron, Years, and Hard<U+017F>hip, came to have that relation to his Catholick Maje<U+017F>ty, which he and many others, though they ju<U+017F>tly de<U+017F>erv'd it, little expected to be preferr'd to.</p>
            <p>On the contrary <hi>Don Jaimo</hi> liv'd like a Prince at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he <U+017F>oon met with <U+017F>ome of his own Con<U+017F>titution, a <U+017F>ort of people, who, like Foxes, never fare better than when they are mo<U+017F>t cur<U+017F>t. They committed <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret Robberies, with <U+017F>uch caution and indu<U+017F>try, that the Authors thereof could never be di<U+017F>cover'd, whereby they were <U+017F>o fle<U+017F>h'd and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, that they daily found out new de<U+017F>igns. There was <U+017F>tarted up about this time at <hi>Madrid</hi> an excellent Company of Players, brought together by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ive charge and liberality of a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> a per<U+017F>on of va<U+017F>t Wealth. What his de<U+017F>ign was in it, I know not, whether he did it out of charity, or for his particular diverti<U+017F>ement, or upon <U+017F>ome other account
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58823:150"/>
to me unknown; but he made it his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ee it furni<U+017F>h'd with all things requi<U+017F>ite. He was de<U+017F>irous they might have the advantages of the Fea<U+017F>t of the B. Sacrament, at which time, the Players of the City may, during all the days of the <hi>Octave,</hi> repre<U+017F>ent their Plays in the open <U+017F>treets, where all are welcome without paying; and this is done every year at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> at the time of that Fea<U+017F>t. To effectuate his de<U+017F>ign, he bought them <U+017F>ome new Plays of the be<U+017F>t Poets in <hi>Spain,</hi> whom he paid well, and put upon <U+017F>ome other pieces, for the accompli<U+017F>hment of that famous Company. So that another Company, which was then at <hi>Madrid,</hi> being too weak to <U+017F>tand in competition with this, was forc'd to leave the City, and go to <hi>Toledo,</hi> where they had, from that Imperial City, the ordinary Salary for repre<U+017F>enting the be<U+017F>t pieces they had, at the <U+017F>ame Fea<U+017F>t. This new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had the whole Court to it <U+017F>elf, and the <U+017F>aid Grandee gave them by way of advance four thou<U+017F>and Crowns, to provide Cloaths <U+017F>uitable to the Pieces they intended to repre<U+017F>ent. This <U+017F>um of money was brought into the Hou<U+017F>e of one of the Players, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and under<U+017F>tanding per<U+017F>on, for whom the re<U+017F>t had <U+017F>uch re<U+017F>pect, that all things pa<U+017F>s'd through his hands; he al<U+017F>o took care for all things, and gave a very faithful account thereof. He di<U+017F>pos'd this money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great Che<U+017F>t, whereof he always carried the Key about him. <hi>Jaimo</hi>'s company <U+017F>oon had an inkling of it, and thinking it a noble prize to hook in that money, they propos'd <U+017F>everal ways to compa<U+017F>s it, but at la<U+017F>t referr'd all their deliberations to <hi>Jaimo,</hi> who<U+017F>e advice they had, upon other occa<U+017F>ions, found the be<U+017F>t. He de<U+017F>ir'd time to con<U+017F>ider till the next day. That night he <U+017F>pent in communicating the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to his Wife,

            <p>The next day, <hi>Jaimo</hi> was clad like a Scholar newly come from the Univer<U+017F>ity, in a Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ock and long Cloak very bare, and <U+017F>potted in many places. Thus accoutred, he <U+017F>melt as <U+017F>trongly of the Poet as if he had fed on nothing but Ver<U+017F>es from his Mother's milk.

            <p>This Comedian was of an humour much different from many others of that Quality, who, when a Poet, whom they know not, comes to pre<U+017F>ent them with a Comedy, <U+017F>light him <U+017F>o far as that they will not <U+017F>o much as give him audience, as if that Divine Power, which hath in<U+017F>pir'd tho<U+017F>e that are in Vogue, had confin'd his gifts to them, and had nothing left to be<U+017F>tow on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But this Comedian, I <U+017F>ay, was of a very jovial and plea<U+017F>ant humour, and was glad of any <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ion to divert him<U+017F>elf. So that mea<U+017F>uring the in<U+017F>ide of the per<U+017F>on by his out-<U+017F>ide and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, he told him, that he did them a tran<U+017F>cendent honour, and that he gave him thanks in the name of the whole company.

He took a chair and <U+017F>ate very quietly till the Rehear<U+017F>al was over. By that time they had made an end, it was <U+017F>o near night, that they could not well do any thing without candles.

Having made this progre<U+017F>s in his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, he went and gave his Camerades an account thereof, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to wait about his hou<U+017F>e where the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was.

No, Sir, <hi><U+017F>ays the Poet;</hi> for the former is his name, as he is a Chri<U+017F>tian, or his Chri<U+017F>tian name, and the other he hath in relation to the part he acts. For as the Ladle <U+017F>tirs the meat which is in the Pot, <U+017F>o he is the per<U+017F>on which tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and turns up<U+017F>ide down the <U+017F>everal parts of the Plot, and <U+017F>huffles all the contrivances and intrigues of the Comedy. You <U+017F>hall find nothing but I can give you a very good rea<U+017F>on for it, and therefore you may <U+017F>pare your <U+017F>elf the trouble of rai<U+017F>ing any further objections. Excellent!

                        <p>Well, Sir, <hi><U+017F>ays the Comedian,</hi> I have <U+017F>een many Comedies in my time, but never any that had <U+017F>uch extraordinary particulars as yours. How do you imagine I <U+017F>hould find <U+017F>even young Maids, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <U+017F>o near the Court? Sir, <hi><U+017F>ays the Poet,</hi> no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit comes in without charge; but you need not be <U+017F>o <U+017F>crupulous, they will not be <U+017F>earch'd, to try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they really be <U+017F>uch or not, though 'twere more convenient they <U+017F>hould. Nay there is yet another expedient, which is, to have them in Per<U+017F>pective, or in Scenes, and artificially mov'd to dance the Ball; but to do well, they <U+017F>hould be alive. There you give us <U+017F>ome comfort, <hi><U+017F>ays the Comedian,</hi> for we may make up that number out of our Company, if tho<U+017F>e will <U+017F>erve who appear not upon the Stage: but I <U+017F>hall not undertake they will be <U+017F>uch as you would have them.

            <p>He then began to read the ver<U+017F>es, but after <U+017F>uch a ridiculous and extravagant manner, that when he had gone over about an hundred of them, the Players per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the Piece contain'd many <U+017F>heets, clo<U+017F>e written, and tir'd with the impertinence of what they had already heard, and withall that they had <U+017F>pent mo<U+017F>t part of the night <U+017F>o trivially, interrupted the Reciter with a kind of a buzzing noi<U+017F>e. That was the Cue which the feign'd Batchelor expected, yet <U+017F>eeming to be angry at it, he clapp'd both hands on the Table with <U+017F>uch violence, that he <U+017F>hook the two Candle<U+017F>ticks, and cri'd out with a loud voice, <hi>Tacete, Tacete.</hi> But the Players and others that were pre<U+017F>ent, not under<U+017F>tanding the Latine, the noi<U+017F>e increas'd, the table was over-turn'd, and the Candles were put out, and then all retiring from him, they <U+017F>et fire to the train they had laid for the poor Poet. He found him<U+017F>elf encompa<U+017F>s'd by a number of <U+017F>quibs and crackers, and long bags full of <U+017F>and like <U+017F>nakes, all in open ho<U+017F>tility again<U+017F>t him. He was in a very <U+017F>ad pickle, for there was nothing but confu<U+017F>ion on the Theatre, be<U+017F>ides the flames of ro<U+017F>in which came up from beneath the Stage, and were ready to choke him, in<U+017F>omuch that to cure him of all future thoughts of Poetry, there needed onely a gentle to<U+017F><U+017F>ing in a blanket. He <U+017F>eem'd to take it very unkindly, that he had been brought thither, to receive <U+017F>uch an affront, for be<U+017F>ides the danger his tinder Cloak and Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ock had been in of a general conflagration, he lo<U+017F>t the Comedy, than whichthere could not a greater lo<U+017F>s happen to him. The Epilogue of the Piece was, that <hi>Jaimo</hi>'s companions, while the Company was thus
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58823:156"/>
entertain'd at the Theatre, had found a way into the Comedian's hou<U+017F>e, and plaid the Ferrets in all the rooms, and examin'd the che<U+017F>ts and trunks that <U+017F>tood in their way, in one whereof they found the mony they look'd for, which they cleaverly carried to <hi>Jaimo</hi>'s hou<U+017F>e, where it was very fairly divided; and in regard <hi>Jaimo</hi>'s wife had been the inventre<U+017F>s of the Plot, <U+017F>he had an equal <U+017F>hare with tho<U+017F>e who had been emploi'd in the execution of it.</p>
            <p>The next day, the Comedian going to take up certain <U+017F>tuffs for cloaths, was not a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd to find the che<U+017F>t open, and the mony fled. He was for a while at <U+017F>uch a lo<U+017F>s, that he knew not where he was. At la<U+017F>t, he ask'd his wife who had been in the hou<U+017F>e? whereto <U+017F>he could give him no account at all. He <U+017F>ent people to abroad to <U+017F>earch, and acquainted the Magi<U+017F>trate with what had happen'd. The neare<U+017F>t <U+017F>treets to the hou<U+017F>e were vi<U+017F>ited, but to no purpo<U+017F>e. The poor Comedian went to relate his misfortune to the Grandee, of whom he had receiv'd that pre<U+017F>ent. But he thinking it a cheat of the Comedians, would not believe him. He fell <U+017F>ick out of pure di<U+017F>content, and kept his bed, and then began to doubt it was a trick put upon him by that feign'd Poet, for whom he immediately caus'd a <U+017F>earch to be made; but he could never be found, for he and his Companions had taken a cour<U+017F>e for that. The<U+017F>e things being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented to the Lord, who had be<U+017F>tow'd the mony on them, he was <U+017F>o generous as to <U+017F>upply them with the like <U+017F>um.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Officers were <U+017F>till upon duty, to <U+017F>ee, whether, <U+017F>earching for the Poet, they <U+017F>hould meet with the Author of the Robbery. The indi<U+017F>pos'd Comedian recover'd upon the <U+017F>ight of the

Mony's return into the che<U+017F>t. <hi>Jaimo</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions had a con<U+017F>ultation how they might trapan the Comedian of that recrute, but when it was propos'd to <hi>Rufina,</hi> who had always a voice in the Conclave, 'twas immediately qua<U+017F>h'd, and <U+017F>he prevail'd with her Husband to leave <hi>Madrid,</hi> <U+017F>ince they had mony enough to retire el<U+017F>e-where, and drive <U+017F>ome trade therewith. <hi>Jaimo</hi> took her advice, and <U+017F>o leaving <hi>Madrid,</hi> they went into <hi>Arragon,</hi> and planted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves at <hi>Sarago<U+017F><U+017F>a,</hi> the Metropolis of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
