         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE By Several PRACTITIONERS in and about the City of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is high time, <U+017F>ince there have been already publi<U+017F>hed many Treati<U+017F>es in this kind, for us to declare our thoughts for the publick good. We have peru<U+017F>ed all that have been in this nature in Engli<U+017F>h, and find them <U+017F>trangely deficient, <U+017F>o crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Notions, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mi<U+017F>takes, that we thought it fit to give you warning of them, to prevent for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the many unfortunate Mi<U+017F>chiefs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon ignorance of the<U+017F>e Matters.</p>
                  <p>It is admirable to us, that our Country <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o much deluded, to build all their practice on <U+017F>uch Authors, that have not at all conduced to any con<U+017F>iderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb facs="tcp:59975:3"/>
in this <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary and u<U+017F>eful Art, as the pre<U+017F>erving of Mankind. How many mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Volumes have the<U+017F>e late times brought forth? Not to di<U+017F>parage any that have de<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but in <U+017F>o weighty a Concernment as this, we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tand upon our integrity. There hath been a rea<U+017F>onable intention in the publi<U+017F>hers of <U+017F>ome Books, <hi>viz. The Birth of Man,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t Ancient, but very much unfurni<U+017F>hed; as al<U+017F>o the Books of <hi>Child-birth, The Expert Midwife,</hi> the wor<U+017F>t that hath been written in that kind, in French; and it's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t a Miracle to us, that Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> a Man whom we otherways re<U+017F>pect, <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>cend <U+017F>o low, as to borrow his imperfect Treati<U+017F>e from tho<U+017F>e wretched Volumes, <U+017F>ome of which are before mentioned; and we mu<U+017F>t deal faithfully with you, that, that <U+017F>mall piece of his, intituled, <hi>The Directory for Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes,</hi> is the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perately deficient of them all; except he writ it for nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, he could certainly have never been <U+017F>o idle to have expo<U+017F>ed it to the light.</p>
                  <p>Now, to give you a true information of what we have here done for your good, we <U+017F>hall not only ju<U+017F>tifie what is here contain'd from our own Experiences, but fully demon<U+017F>trate from the Writings of the be<U+017F>t Practi<U+017F>ers both of the <hi>French, Spani<U+017F>h,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and other Nations; and we mu<U+017F>t clearly confe<U+017F>s, that we are highly obliged to the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb facs="tcp:59975:3"/>
labours of that mo<U+017F>t Famous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the World, <hi>Madam Loui<U+017F>e Burgeois,</hi> late Midwife to the Queen of <hi>France</hi>: The prai<U+017F>es that we read of all tho<U+017F>e that ever heard of her, are not <U+017F>o much a flouri<U+017F>h, as truth; for her rea<U+017F>ons are <U+017F>olid experiences, and her witne<U+017F><U+017F>es have been all of the mo<U+017F>t eminent Per<U+017F>ons of <hi>France</hi>; and not only of her, but as we have already expre<U+017F>t, of the mo<U+017F>t excellent known Men and Women of this Art of other Countries: It's upon this account that we break the barriers, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>tand the brunt of all Cen<U+017F>ures.</p>
                  <p>The chief occa<U+017F>ion of this Book, is, to make it a great Exemplary, and School, where Medicine married to the Midwife's indu<U+017F>try, may teach every one the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects of this art of Midwifry.</p>
                  <p>And now knowing, Reader, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts herein contain'd, which have ever had happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>es, are not made publick to the World on any other de<U+017F>ign, than for the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons, whom either the want of fortune, or opportunity denieth <U+017F>uch <U+017F>udden helps, neither can we be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bleeding hearts, if we but con<U+017F>ider how many have been lo<U+017F>t by the unskilfulne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e that attempted this great Work; nor <U+017F>hould we have pro<U+017F>trated our reputation and private experiences, but to correct the frequent mi<U+017F>take of mo<U+017F>t <hi>Midwives,</hi> who,
<pb facs="tcp:59975:4"/>
re<U+017F>ting too boldly upon the common way of delivering Women, neglect all the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome and profitable Rules of Art, which might concern them in the occult Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of Women, as al<U+017F>o of the Anatomical parts of the Body. Thus having di<U+017F>charged our Duty, we have no more to write, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to the Book it <U+017F>elf. We are the hearty Well-wi<U+017F>hers of your good,</p>

And it may be rea<U+017F>onably fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that many Women do mi<U+017F>s their de<U+017F>ign, becau<U+017F>e they know nothing but the out<U+017F>ide of things: <U+017F>o that in matters of extremity, becau<U+017F>e they are ignorant of the <U+017F>tructure of the parts, they cannot tell how to go about their work. We <U+017F>hall therefore begin with the Anatomy of the privy parts, the Organs of generation, whereby through pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation is con<U+017F>erved a perennity of mankind, which nature has denied to particulars. The<U+017F>e parts being not alike in both Sexes, we mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily treat of each apart; and fir<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e of Man.</p>
                     <p>In Man, <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e parts afford matter for the Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spermatic Arteries; others bring back again the blood that is <U+017F>uperfluous to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Seed, and to the nouri<U+017F>hment of the Stones, and the<U+017F>e are the Spermatic Veins; and both the Arteries and Veins were formerly called prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. Some make the Seed, as the Stones; <U+017F>ome carry the Seed back again; <U+017F>ome contain the Seed and an oyly matter, as the Seed-bladders the fir<U+017F>t, and the Pro<U+017F>tats the latter.

                        <p>AMong the Spermatic Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are to be con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fir<U+017F>t, two veins, and two arteries: the<U+017F>e are carried downward from the <U+017F>mall guts to the Te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and are much bigger in Men than they are in Women.</p>
                        <p>The original of the<U+017F>e Veins is not always the <U+017F>ame; for commonly the right Vein ri<U+017F>eth out of the <hi>Hollow vein,</hi> a little below the <U+017F>ource or original of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgent; but the lea<U+017F>t takes his original from the lower part of the Emulgent it <U+017F>elf. Yet <U+017F>ometimes it hath a branch carried to it from the trunk of the hollow Vein.</p>
                        <p>The middle part of the<U+017F>e veins runs directly through the Loyns, re<U+017F>ting upon the <hi>Lumbal</hi> Mu<U+017F>cle, a thin Membrane only intervening; and thus having gone above half its journey, it branches out and di<U+017F>tributes it <U+017F>elf to the near adjoyning filmy parts of the Body. The uttermo<U+017F>t part of the<U+017F>e ve<U+017F><U+017F>els is carried beyond the Midriff to the Stones, yet do they not pa<U+017F>s through the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> but de<U+017F>cend with a <U+017F>mall nerve and the Mu<U+017F>cle called <hi>Crema<U+017F>ter,</hi> through the Duplicity of the Midriff; when it approaches near the Stones, it is joyned with an Artery: and now the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els which were before a little <U+017F>evered one from the other, are by a film ri<U+017F>ing from the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> clo<U+017F>ed up, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59975:10"/>
bound both together; and <U+017F>o twi<U+017F>ting up, like the young tendrils of a Vine, they are carried to the end of the Stones.</p>
                        <p>The arteries which are a<U+017F><U+017F>ociated to the<U+017F>e veins, take their original a little beneath the Emulgent vein, whence they de<U+017F>cend downward, and a little from their beginning or original, they are joyn'd to the<U+017F>e veins, till they are clo<U+017F>ed together by an <hi>Ana<U+017F>tomô<U+017F>is</hi> or Ino<U+017F>culation, ending like a Piramid.</p>
                        <p>It has been generally taught, that there are <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ino<U+017F>culations of the Arteries, with the Veins in their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, whereby the blood of the Veins and Arteries are mixed; but <U+017F>ince the knowledge of the Circulation of the Blood, this Opinion has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; for the blood in the Arteries goes down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Stones, and that in the veins a<U+017F>cends from them; and therefore if the<U+017F>e two Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els <U+017F>hould open one into the other, the Blood in one of them mu<U+017F>t ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>arily be thru<U+017F>t back, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>topping, <U+017F>tretch and break the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; but the truth is, the blood, both for the nouri<U+017F>hment of the Stones, and the making of Seed, flows down by the Arteries only in an even cour<U+017F>e, without any windings and twinings, like the tendrils of Vines, <U+017F>o much talked of, as the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Anatomi<U+017F>t <hi>de Graef</hi> <U+017F>ays he has found by frequent in<U+017F>pection. The Veins carry back from the Stones, what of the blood remains from their nouri<U+017F>hment, and making of Seed, and the<U+017F>e indeed come out of the Stones, with a va<U+017F>t number of Roots, whereby they <U+017F>uck up the <U+017F>aid Blood, and are mo<U+017F>t admirably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven, and ino<U+017F>culated one with another, 'till about four or five fingers breadth above the Stone, which <U+017F>pace is called the Pyramidal Body.</p>
                        <p>Two things are to be noted. Fir<U+017F>t, That the<U+017F>e <U+017F>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Veins have from their ri<U+017F>e to their end <U+017F>everal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59975:11"/>
Valves, which open upwards, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>uffer the Blood to a<U+017F>cend towards the hollow Vein, but not to return back again. Secondly, That tho' the Spermatick Arteries go a direct cour<U+017F>e in Men, yet in Brutes they are more complicated, and twi<U+017F>ted with the Veins, but without any opening of one into another. There are Nerves and Lympheducts, that pa<U+017F>s into the Te<U+017F>ticles together with the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of preparation.</p>

                        <p>Another U<U+017F>e of them is gathered by their <U+017F>ituation; for as they are now <U+017F>ituated, that is to <U+017F>ay, the right Vein coming from the <hi>Hollow</hi> Vein, and the left from the <hi>Emulgent</hi>: This incovenience is avoided, that the left Vein is not forced to pa<U+017F>s over the great Artery, and <U+017F>o be in danger of breaking, by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>wift motion of the Artery. Moreover, there being a nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity that Male and Female <U+017F>hould be begot, it is fit that there <U+017F>hould be Seed proper for the generation of both Sexes, whereof <U+017F>ome mu<U+017F>t be hotter, and <U+017F>ome mu<U+017F>t be colder; and therefore Nature hath <U+017F>o order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that the hotter Seed <U+017F>hould proceed from the right Vein for the generation of man, and the colder from the left, for the generation of Females. The left
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59975:11"/>
Vein hath al<U+017F>o this property to draw from the <hi>Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> the more <U+017F>erous and le<U+017F>s pure Blood, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the <U+017F>erous humour might <U+017F>tir up Venery by its <U+017F>alt and acrimonious <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; and therefore it is ob<U+017F>erved, that tho<U+017F>e who have the left Stone bigger, are mo<U+017F>t full of Seed, and mo<U+017F>t prone to Venery.</p>
                        <p>The<U+017F>e Veins are <U+017F>o far from preparing the Seed, as that they only bring back, what was <U+017F>uperfluous from the making it. And indeed the Arteries in Men do no more merit the name of preparing Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Seed, than the Gullet in re<U+017F>pect of the Chyle, or the chyliferous thoracick duct, in regard to the Blood. But however we continue the old Names, declaring only again<U+017F>t the rea<U+017F>on of them.</p>

                        <p>Neverthele<U+017F>s, we are to under<U+017F>tand this, that the temper of the Stones are not alike in all, for in <U+017F>ome they are far colder than in others. And therefore tho<U+017F>e, who have hot Te<U+017F>ticles, are more <U+017F>alacious and prone to venereal actions, having the places near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout much more hairy, and their Te<U+017F>ticles much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than others. Tho<U+017F>e that have their Te<U+017F>ticles cold, find every thing contrary.</p>
                        <p>The greate<U+017F>t heat is in the right Te<U+017F>ticle, becau<U+017F>e it receives more pure, and hotter blood from the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Vein, and the great Artery; the left colder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it receives a more impure, and <U+017F>erous blood from the Emulgent Vein.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59975:15"/>
inbred quality, which Nature hath be<U+017F>towed upon them. For the blood being received by the <U+017F>permatic Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and there beginning to change its colour, is by and by received by the deferent Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, or the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els which carry the blood <U+017F>o prepared to the Te<U+017F>ticles; where it is for a while contained, and afterwards being carried to the Stones, is by them made Seed, and the la<U+017F>t work perfected. And it may with more ea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s be affirmed, that the Seed is generated by the Stones, becau<U+017F>e every like is <U+017F>aid to generate its like; now the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Te<U+017F>ticles is very like the Seed it <U+017F>elf, that is, white, moi<U+017F>t, and vi<U+017F>cous. Whether the Stones are the only efficient cau<U+017F>e of the Seed is not here to be di<U+017F>puted, being only a nice point, and no way profitable. We <U+017F>hall rather with <U+017F>ilence adhere to that opinion, which affirms the function of the Te<U+017F>ticles to be the generation of the Seed, which is mo<U+017F>t likely; and proceed to the next.</p>

                        <p>THE <U+017F>tructure of the Te<U+017F>ticles being thus known; it remains that we <U+017F>hew you their u<U+017F>e. This is fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>covered from their <U+017F>ituation. For of tho<U+017F>e Creatures that have Stones, <U+017F>ome have them in their bodies, as all Fowl; others have them without, though not pendent; others have them hanging downward, as men. Men therefore have their Te<U+017F>ticles without their bodies for two cau<U+017F>es; fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Te<U+017F>ticles of the Male <U+017F>hould be bigger and hotter than tho<U+017F>e of the Female; <U+017F>o that it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for them to be contained within the body, becau<U+017F>e of their quantity. Be<U+017F>ides, the Seed of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59975:15"/>
Male being the effective original of the Creature, and therefore hotte<U+017F>t; it is al<U+017F>o required that the Seed <U+017F>hould be more abundant than could be contained in the Te<U+017F>ticles, were they placed within the body: for the <U+017F>eminary pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages mu<U+017F>t have been le<U+017F>s, and the veins them<U+017F>elves would not have afforded <U+017F>uch plenty of matter as now they do.</p>
                        <p>The motion of the Te<U+017F>ticles is al<U+017F>o to be con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; by which they move <U+017F>ometimes upward and <U+017F>ometimes downward. The one of the<U+017F>e motions which is made upward is voluntary, as being made by the Mu<U+017F>cles; but the motion downward is a forced motion, not hapning without the laxity of the Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; the Te<U+017F>ticles, through their own weight, falling downwards. The<U+017F>e Mu<U+017F>cles are called <hi>Crema<U+017F>ters,</hi> their u<U+017F>e being to draw up the Te<U+017F>ticles to <U+017F>horten the way of the Ejaculation of the Seed; as al<U+017F>o to keep the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els from being di<U+017F>tended too far by the weight of the Te<U+017F>ticles.</p>
                        <p>The u<U+017F>e of the Tunicles is now to be <U+017F>poken of; and fir<U+017F>t, of that which is outermo<U+017F>t, and is called by the Latins <hi>Scrotum,</hi> being the pur<U+017F>e wherein the Te<U+017F>ticles are contained.

The other Coats, or Tunicles, are al<U+017F>o made for the defence of the Stones, but <U+017F>o thin and light that they <U+017F>hould not oppre<U+017F>s the Stones with their weight; that which is called <hi>Erythroides</hi> hath many veins for the nouri<U+017F>hment of the adjacent parts.

                        <p>The<U+017F>e Bladders have two <U+017F>everal u<U+017F>es; for they do not only <U+017F>trengthen the <U+017F>eminary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els where they end, but al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eem to be the <U+017F>tores and magazeens of the Seed.

                        <p>In the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els <U+017F>uch is the propen<U+017F>ity of Nature to propagate, let the body be never <U+017F>o much emaciated, there is always found a le<U+017F><U+017F>er or greater quantity of Seed. They are hollow and round, to contain a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59975:17"/>
greater quantity of Seed; they are al<U+017F>o full of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, that they may be contracted or extended as the plenty of Seed requires; they are crooked and full of windings and turnings, that the Seed contained may not ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>lip out.</p>
                        <p>The<U+017F>e <U+017F>mall Bladders are little Cells, like tho<U+017F>e in a Pomgranate, or <U+017F>omething like a bunch of Grapes. <hi>De Graef</hi> compares them to the guts of a little Bird, diver<U+017F>ly contorted.

They are two divided from one another by a little inter<U+017F>tice, and they do <U+017F>everally, by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, ca<U+017F>t the Seed contained in them into the Urethra: they are very winding, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of many little Cells, that they <U+017F>hould not pour out all the Seed contained in them in one act of Copulation, but might retain it for <U+017F>everal; they have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication one with another, not even in their very opening into the Urethra, but the Seed that is brought to the<U+017F>e little bladders on the right <U+017F>ide i<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ues by its proper pa<U+017F><U+017F>age into the Urethra, and that which is brought to the left likewi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that if by any accident the bladders on the one <U+017F>ide be bur<U+017F>t or cut, as in cuting for the Stone they mu<U+017F>t needs be, yet tho<U+017F>e on the other being entire may <U+017F>till <U+017F>uffice for generation.

There is a great variety of Opinions, what the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in them <U+017F>hould be, or what is their u<U+017F>e: Some think that the Seed that flows from the Te<U+017F>ticles, is further elaborated here; but that cannot be, becau<U+017F>e the <hi>va<U+017F>a deferentia</hi> depo<U+017F>it nothing in them, but all into the <U+017F>mall Seed Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. Others think, that there is <U+017F>eparated from the Blood in them, an acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and <U+017F>erous humour which <U+017F>erves for Titulation, or cau<U+017F>ing the greater plea<U+017F>ure in Venery. As to this, <hi>de Graef</hi> appeals to the ta<U+017F>te of it, which has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Acrimony in it. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> thinks they make a particular kind of Seed, as the Stones do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Seed Bladders a third; that the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t make a different Seed from that made in the Stones, is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59975:19"/>
grounded on a mi<U+017F>take in Anatomy, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>va<U+017F>a deferentia</hi> have no communication with the Seed-Bladders, whereas they apparently open into them, and de<U+017F>po<U+017F>ite in them all the Seed they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; that the Pro<U+017F>tats make a peculiar <U+017F>ort, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove, becau<U+017F>e gelded Animals emit <U+017F>ome Seed; but tho' they do emit <U+017F>omething, it is not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary it <U+017F>hould be any true Seed; or if it be, it may well be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to proceed from the <U+017F>mall Seed-Bladders that were full when the Animal was gelt; for this rea<U+017F>on it has been ob<U+017F>erved, that pre<U+017F>ently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gelding, they have <U+017F>ometimes got the Female with Young, but not afterwards when that <U+017F>tock was <U+017F>pent.

                        </head>
                        <p>THE <U+017F>tructure of the Yard is not unknown, that is to <U+017F>ay, at the root of the <U+017F>hare bone in the hinder part of the <hi>Hypoga<U+017F>trion</hi> or lower part of the belly, where the hair grows; which bone is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Os pubis.</hi> Though the greate<U+017F>t part of it, is not pendent without, but adjoining to the <hi>Podex,</hi> is <U+017F>itua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted near the joining of the <U+017F>hare-bone, being fa<U+017F>t knit to it in the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> or <U+017F>pace between the Cods and the Fundament; the other part is pendent and is <U+017F>een hanging outward. This <U+017F>ituation is mo<U+017F>t appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the manner of the act of generation, u<U+017F>ual and peculiar to men, who do not couple after the manner of Bea<U+017F>ts. The figure of it is in a manner round, though not exactly; broader in the upper part which is called the back of the Yard.</p>
                        <p>The thickne<U+017F>s and longitude of the Yard is <U+017F>o much as is required for Procreation; yet it is not <U+017F>o long as in many other creatures. Yea, and in <U+017F>everal men there is a very great diver<U+017F>ity; little men being for the mo<U+017F>t part, be<U+017F>t provided in that part: It is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral received opinion, that the often u<U+017F>e of Venery doth increa<U+017F>e the quantity of it in all dimen<U+017F>ions.</p>
                        <p>The Yard will al<U+017F>o be longer, if the Navel-<U+017F>trings are not bound up, or knit too clo<U+017F>e by the Midwife, in Children that are newly born; but at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance from the Navel: This happens by rea<U+017F>on of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament coming from the Navel to the bottom of the Bladder; which if it be too much abreviated, draws up the Bladder, and con<U+017F>equently <U+017F>hortens the Yard; but if the Navel-<U+017F>tring be left at a longer di<U+017F>tance, the <hi>Urachus</hi> is enlarged, and con<U+017F>equently the Yard hath
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59975:20"/>
more liberty to extend it <U+017F>elf; And therefore the Midwives are from hence adverti<U+017F>ed, that they do not <U+017F>poil the harve<U+017F>t of generation, by cutting the <U+017F>ithe too <U+017F>hort.</p>
                        <p>As to the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Yard; it is not of a bony <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, as in Dogs, Wolves, or Foxes; for <U+017F>o it would become always hard and erected, and hinder men from all bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s but the act of Venery: Neither is it gri<U+017F>tly, for <U+017F>o it could neither erect it <U+017F>elf, nor flag, when occa<U+017F>ion required: Neither is it full of veins, for <U+017F>o it could not be emptied and repleted on <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden as often happens; be<U+017F>ides, the Tunicles of the veins are <U+017F>o thin, that they could not <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>tention; neither can it be full of Arteries, becau<U+017F>e it wants a continual pul<U+017F>ation; neither can it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of Nerves, becau<U+017F>e they having no hollowne<U+017F>s, cannot be extended and loo<U+017F>ned, as it mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity happen to the Yard. It is therefore nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that the Yard <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, as is not peculiar to any part of the body. It is to be under<U+017F>tood, that there do concur to the framing of the Yard, two nervous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age for the Urine which is called <hi>Urethra,</hi> the <hi>Glans</hi> or Nut of the Yard, four Mu<U+017F>cles, the Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els, and the skin.</p>
                        <p>Here doth ari<U+017F>e a que<U+017F>tion, why the Yard hath not any fat? Which is in brief, thus; becau<U+017F>e that there <U+017F>hould be no hindrance to the perfect <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of the Yard, which could of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity not be avoided, if that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were <U+017F>ubject to any obe<U+017F>ity; the fat being <U+017F>ubject to be melted by frication.</p>

                        <p>AMONG the parts that compo<U+017F>e the <U+017F>tructure of the Yard, is that skin which with its cuticle,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59975:20"/>
and fle<U+017F>hly pannicle, is common not only to this, but to other members; only it hath this peculiar to it <U+017F>elf, that it may be reflexed, and drawn back from the Nut of the Yard. This skin that turns back is called the <hi>Praeputium</hi>; becau<U+017F>e that part in circumci<U+017F>ion was cut away; with which <hi>prepuce,</hi> the Nut of the Yard is covered.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Glans</hi> or Nut of the Yard is a fle<U+017F>hy part, <U+017F>oft, thin,<note rend="inter">The Nut of the Yard.</note> repleat with blood and <U+017F>pirits; endued with an exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e; <U+017F>omething <U+017F>harp and acute at the end. This is fa<U+017F>tned to the <hi>prepuce</hi> at the lower part by a certain ligament, which is therefore called the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or the <hi>filet,</hi> which commonly is broken in the fir<U+017F>t venereal a<U+017F><U+017F>aults, which are for the mo<U+017F>t part the mo<U+017F>t furious.</p>
                        <p>The greate<U+017F>t part of the Yard is con<U+017F>tituted by two nervous bodies,<note rend="inter">The two nervous bodies.</note> on both <U+017F>ides one, which terminate both together in the Nut.

It is called the <hi>Nervous pipe.</hi> The<U+017F>e two bodies are joyned together by a certain membrane, thin, yet nervous; which is <U+017F>trengthned by certain overthwart fibres, being there placed in the likene<U+017F>s of a Weavers <U+017F>huttle: and though in their original they are <U+017F>eparated the one from the other, that there might remain <U+017F>ome certain <U+017F>pace for the <hi>Urethra</hi>; yet they are joyned together about the

                        <p>The interiour <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which is wrapt about by the exteriour nervous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, hath this worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation, That there appears <U+017F>tretched, through the whole length of it, a thin and tender Artery, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the bigne<U+017F>s of the body which is diffu<U+017F>ed through the whole loo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Yard, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as far as the root of the Yard. Be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e two, there is another body which lies between the<U+017F>e two, as proper or rather more peculiar to the Yard than they are. This is a pipe placed at the inferiour part of the Yard, being called the <hi>Urethra,</hi> though it be a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age as proper to the Seed, as to the Urine; which is encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the two fore-mentioned bodies. This is a certain Channel produced in length, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the middle of tho<U+017F>e nervous bodies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance that they do, being loo<U+017F>e, thick, <U+017F>oft, and tender; every way equal from the neck of the bladder to the nut of the Yard, <U+017F>aving that it is a little wider at the beginning, than it is toward the place where it ends, which is at the head of the <hi>Glans</hi> or nut of the Yard.</p>

                        <p>THE main <U+017F>cope of Nature in the u<U+017F>e of the Yard, was, the injection of Seed into the womb of the Woman, which injection could not be done, till the Seed were fir<U+017F>t moved; neither could the Seed be moved but by frication of the parts, which could not be done, till it were <U+017F>heathed in the Womb; nor that neither, till the Yard were erected.</p>
                        <p>This di<U+017F>tention is cau<U+017F>ed by repletion; which is cau<U+017F>ed by the plenty of Seed: Secondly, by <U+017F>uperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wind, which if it be too violent, is the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>priapi<U+017F>m</hi>: A third cau<U+017F>e proceeds from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Urine contained in the Bladder.

The extremity of the skin is <U+017F>o ordered, that it <U+017F>ometimes covers the <hi>Glans,</hi> and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times draws back; that, whil<U+017F>t it covers the Nut of the Yard, it may defend the Yard from frication, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the motion of the Seed.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, this skin in the act of copulation, <U+017F>huts up the mouth of the Womb and hinders the ingre<U+017F>s of the cold air. Concerning the two nervous bodies, con<U+017F>tituting the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Yard; their u<U+017F>e is for the vital <U+017F>pirit to run through the thin <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of them, and fill the Yard with <U+017F>pirits. Moreover, by their thickne<U+017F>s, they do prevent the two ha<U+017F>ty emptying and flying out of the <U+017F>pirits which are to <U+017F>tay in, for the greater and longer erection of the Yard.</p>
                        <p>The u<U+017F>e of the <hi>Urethra</hi> is for the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of Seed and Urine through it. The <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the <hi>Urethra</hi> is much of the <U+017F>ame with the two former bodies; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide

upon the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Loins, and this for that cau<U+017F>e that they might be more hot and fruitful; being to elaborate that matter, with which the Seed of man engenders man.</p>

                        <p>Their coverings al<U+017F>o do make a difference: for mens are wrapt up in divers Tunicles, becau<U+017F>e being pendent outward, they were otherwi<U+017F>e more <U+017F>ubject to external injuries; but the <U+017F>tones of women have but one tunicle, which though it <U+017F>tick very clo<U+017F>e to them, yet are they al<U+017F>o half cloathed over with the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi>

Some Women, <U+017F>ays Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> <U+017F>end forth no <U+017F>uch humour as is called Seed, and yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; for I have known <U+017F>everal Women, <U+017F>ays he, that have bin fruitful enough without <U+017F>uch emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, yea, <U+017F>ome that after they begun to emit <U+017F>uch an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, tho' indeed they took greater plea<U+017F>ure in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, yet grew le<U+017F>s fruitful than before. There are al<U+017F>o infinite in<U+017F>tances of Women, who tho' they have plea<U+017F>ure in Copulation, yet <U+017F>end forth nothing, and notwith<U+017F>tanding conceive. It is moreover to be ob<U+017F>erved, that the humour is ca<U+017F>t out, and i<U+017F><U+017F>ues mo<U+017F>t commonly from about the <hi>Clytoris,</hi> and Orifice of the privities, and very rarely from any depth within the neck of the Womb, but never within the Womb it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>o as that it <U+017F>hould be there mixed with the mans Seed; be<U+017F>ides it is not ropy and oyly like Seed, but <U+017F>erous like Urine.

Where they begin, at the bottom of the womb, they are hollow and large; but as they proceed further on, they grow narrower, till, near their end, they do again obtain a larger bigne<U+017F>s; the<U+017F>e two pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages thus running from the corners of the womb to the Stones, are taken only to be certain ligaments, by which the Stones and the Womb are <U+017F>trongly knit together; and the<U+017F>e ligaments in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are the <U+017F>ame things with the <hi>Crema<U+017F>teres</hi> in men.</p>

of the Womb, and by the<U+017F>e latter, <U+017F>uch as were already impregnated; for that if it <U+017F>hould have i<U+017F><U+017F>ued into the bottom of the womb, where the conception was, it would have corrupted, to the great prejudice of the <hi>Faetus.</hi> But many accurate Anatomi<U+017F>ts have not bin able to find the lea<U+017F>t foot-<U+017F>tep of the<U+017F>e latter ducts; and as for the former, <U+017F>eeing they have not any cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore can have nothing of <U+017F>eed in them, we mu<U+017F>t conclude, that they are only ligaments of the <U+017F>tones to keep them in their place; and this may be proved farther, by ob<U+017F>erving that they come not into the inner cavity of the womb, but are knit only to its outward Coat, and there are only two holes in the bottom of the womb, that admit a probe, and tho<U+017F>e lead to the fallopian tubes, and not to the<U+017F>e ligaments.</p>
                        <p>Seeing therefore, that tho<U+017F>e which have bin accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ejaculatory Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, either are not to be found at all, or are found unfit for <U+017F>uch an Office, and having withal rejected the Opinion of Womens having <U+017F>eed, and affirm'd, that that which makes the Conception, is one of tho<U+017F>e little bladders in the <U+017F>tones, dropping from thence, and conveyed into the womb, we mu<U+017F>t enquire by what way they can pa<U+017F>s; for if the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid ligaments reputed deferent Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, have no pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age, whereby the <U+017F>eed, if there were any might pa<U+017F>s, much le<U+017F>s cou'd one of the<U+017F>e bladders be conveyed that way; and therefore, for deferent Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, we a<U+017F><U+017F>ign tho<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, that are called the fallopian tubes, they are very <U+017F>lender, and narrow pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, nervous and white, ari<U+017F>ing from the <U+017F>ides of the womb, and at a little di<U+017F>tance from it, they become larger, and twi<U+017F>t like the tendrel of a Vine, 'till near their end, where cea<U+017F>ing their winding, they grow very large, and <U+017F>eem membranous and fle<U+017F>hy, which end is very much torn and jaggy, like the edge of rent Cloaths, and has

a large hole, which always lies clo<U+017F>ed, becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e jags fall together; but yet being opened they are like the outmo<U+017F>t orifice of a bra<U+017F>s Trumpet The<U+017F>e tubes are the <U+017F>ame in Women, that the horns of the womb are in other Creatures, for they an<U+017F>wer to tho<U+017F>e, both in <U+017F>ituation, connection, amplitude, perforation, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and al<U+017F>o office: For as other Creatures always conceive in the Horns, <U+017F>o it has been <U+017F>ometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved, that a Conception has in a Woman bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in one of the tubes, which mu<U+017F>t have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the Egg, being received out of the <U+017F>tone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, has been <U+017F>topt in its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the womb, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from its own bigne<U+017F>s, or <U+017F>ome ob<U+017F>truction in the tube. The <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the tubes is not nervous, as <hi>Fallopius</hi> affirms, but membranous; for they con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of two membranes, the outer and inner; the inner <U+017F>prings from, or at lea<U+017F>t is common with that, which covers the inner <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the womb: But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is <U+017F>mooth in the womb, it is very wrinkled in the tubes, the outer is common with the outmo<U+017F>t of the womb, and this is <U+017F>mooth.</p>
                        <p>The capacity of the<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages varies very much, for in the beginning, as it goes out of the womb, it only admits a bri<U+017F>tle; but in his progre<U+017F>s, where it is mo<U+017F>t capacious, it will receive ones little finger, but in the extremity, where it is jagged, it is but about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <U+017F>o wide, their length al<U+017F>o is very uncertain, for they <U+017F>ometimes increa<U+017F>e from four or five, to eight or nine fingers breadth long. Their u<U+017F>e is in a fruitful Copulation to grant a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the finer part of the man's Seed, or of a <U+017F>eminal fume towards the <U+017F>tones, to bedew the Eggs contained in them, which Eggs, one or more being thereby ripened, and dropping off from the <U+017F>tone, are received by the extremity of the tubes, and carried along their inner cavity to the womb.</p>

                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59975:36"/>Two objections may be made again<U+017F>t this u<U+017F>e: Fir<U+017F>t, That the end of the tube not <U+017F>ticking clo<U+017F>e to the <U+017F>tone, when one of the Eggs drops from the <U+017F>tone, it would more probably fall into the cavity of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than light ju<U+017F>t pat in the mouth of the tube.

It may be known al<U+017F>o by other <U+017F>igns, for in the conception the Male-Infant begins to move at the beginning of the third Month; for the mo<U+017F>t part; and the Female at the beginning of the third or fourth Month: now where any motion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, the woman ought to ob<U+017F>erve whether <U+017F>he have any milk in her brea<U+017F>ts or no: if <U+017F>he have milk in her brea<U+017F>ts, it is a <U+017F>ign of true conception; if <U+017F>he have not, it is a <U+017F>ign of fal<U+017F>e conception.

it is beneficial; but if it continue after the third or fourth Month it ought to be remedied, becau<U+017F>e the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment being daily Vomited up, the Mother and the Child will be much weakened; and moreover, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <U+017F>ubver<U+017F>ion of the Stomach cau<U+017F>ing great agitation, and compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion the Belly, occa<U+017F>ions mi<U+017F>carriage.

But whatever <U+017F>ort of Flux it is, if it be much and of long continuance, the Woman is in danger of mi<U+017F>carrying; for in a Lientary, the Mother and Child are much weakened, that being ca<U+017F>t out by Stool, which <U+017F>hould be the Nouri<U+017F>hment; and the Strength and Spirits are much weakened by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Loo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s; but the bloody Flux is mo<U+017F>t dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, becau<U+017F>e the frequent endeavours to go to Stool, greatly di<U+017F>turb the Womb. As to the Cure of the<U+017F>e Fluxes, whereof great Care ought to be had in time; for they occa<U+017F>ion Mi<U+017F>carriages; the Woman afflicted with a Lientery ought to u<U+017F>e meat of ea<U+017F>ie dige<U+017F>tion, and little at a time, that <U+017F>o her Stomach may be able to concoct it and <U+017F>he ought to drink Claret mixed with water, wherein Iron hath been quenched, and before and after Meals, a little burnt Wine, or good Canary may be drank, or a little Marmalade of Quinces may be eat.</p>
                        <p>If it be only a loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, and is gentle, and is not of long continuance, it needs not be much regarded, and therefore ought to be left to Nature, but if it continues

In this ca<U+017F>e the ill humours mu<U+017F>t be fir<U+017F>t purged off with Syrup of Succory and Rhubarb or the like, and Broaths made of Veal and Chicken with cooling herbs in them mu<U+017F>t be u<U+017F>ed to qualifie the Acrimony of the humours; and <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t drink Claret wine and Water, wherein Iron has been quenched, or half a Spoonful of Syrup of Quinces may be mixed with Water, and every other Night at Bed time after purging, <U+017F>he may take fifteen or 20 Drops of liquid <hi>Laudanum,</hi> and Gli<U+017F>ters may be injected made of Calves Head, or Sheeps head Broath; and to prevent the frequent Endeavours of going to Stool, a Gli<U+017F>ter made of Milk, and the Yolk of an Egg mixed, may be now and then injected. When a Woman is with Child, generally <U+017F>peaking, <U+017F>he ought not to have her Cour<U+017F>es, becau<U+017F>e their ordinary pa<U+017F><U+017F>age is <U+017F>topt, and al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e the Blood is then employ'd for the Nouri<U+017F>hment of the Child; yet <U+017F>ome big bellied Women have their monthly purgations till the fifth Month, and yet go out their time, and do very well. A Woman having her cour<U+017F>es, thought <U+017F>he was not with Child, and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he found her <U+017F>elf indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>he advi<U+017F>ed with a Phy<U+017F>ician, who by Bleeding and purging her made her mi<U+017F>carry, after <U+017F>he had bin three Months gone with Child.</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted, that when Women with Child have a Flux of Blood, you mu<U+017F>t carefully con<U+017F>ider whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the ordinary Cour<U+017F>es, or a real Flooding; if if it be the ordinary Cour<U+017F>es, the Blood comes at the accu<U+017F>tomed times, and flows by degrees from the Neck, near the inward Orifice of the Womb, and not from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59975:51"/>
the Bottom of it as may be perceived, if trying with a Finger, you find the inward Orifice quite clo<U+017F>ed, which could not be if the Blood i<U+017F><U+017F>ued from the Bottom. It mu<U+017F>t be likewi<U+017F>e con<U+017F>idered whether the Cour<U+017F>es flow, by rea<U+017F>on of the Superfluity of the Blood, the Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of it, or the weakne<U+017F>s of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. If abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood be alone the Cau<U+017F>e there being more than enough for the Nouri<U+017F>hment of the Child, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures neither Mother nor Child, but is a Benefit to both, provided it be moderate. But if there be not abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood, and if the Woman u<U+017F>e to have but a <U+017F>mall quantity of her Cour<U+017F>es, before <U+017F>he was with Child, it is a <U+017F>ign that the Flux proceeds from the Heat and Acrimony of the Blood, or the Weakne<U+017F>s of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</p>
                        <p>To prevent this Flux, when it ought to be <U+017F>topt, the Woman mu<U+017F>t keep in Bed, and forbear all things that may heat her blood, and mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve a cooling and <U+017F>trengthening Diet, and feed on Meat that breeds good Blood, and thickens it; as Broths made of Chicken, Knuckels of Veal and the like, wherein may be boiled cooling Herbs; Rice Milk and Barley Broth is al<U+017F>o ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, and in all her Drink quench Iron. She mu<U+017F>t forbear Conver<U+017F>ation with her Husband. And to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Child, which in this ca<U+017F>e is u<U+017F>ually very weak, Linnen dipt in <U+017F>trong Wine, wherein Cinamon and Pomgranat Peel has bin infu<U+017F>ed, mu<U+017F>t be applyed to the Mothers Belly.</p>
                        <p>Flooding is much more dangerous than a Flux of the Cour<U+017F>es; for the Blood comes from the bottom of the Womb with pain, and in great Abundance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues flooding daily without Intermi<U+017F><U+017F>ion; only <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Clods of Blood <U+017F>top it for a while, but afterwards it flows more violently, and de<U+017F>troys both Mother and Child if not <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably <U+017F>top'd by the delivery of the Woman.</p>

                           <p>The Womb-cake, otherwi<U+017F>e called the Womb-liver, is much like the Spleen, it has abundance of <hi>Fibres;</hi> and <U+017F>mall ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, it is two fingers breadth, thin near the edges, and thick in the middle. And when the Child is ready for Birth, it is a quarter of a Yard over: It is <U+017F>mooth and <U+017F>omewhat hollowi<U+017F>h on the <U+017F>ide next the Child, and is joined to the Chorion, but is very unequal on that <U+017F>ide next the Womb, and has many Bunchings out, by which it <U+017F>ticks fa<U+017F>t to the Womb. When there are Twins, there are two Womb-Cakes, either di<U+017F>tinct in Shape, or <U+017F>eperated by a Membrane one from the other, and a particular rope of umbilical Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els is in<U+017F>erted into each from each Child; it at fir<U+017F>t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears like a woolly Sub<U+017F>tance on the out<U+017F>ide of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Membrane, that encompa<U+017F><U+017F>es the Child about the

ninth week; and a red fle<U+017F>hy <U+017F>oft <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance grows upon it in a <U+017F>hort time, that is unequal, and in little knobs, and thereby pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ticks to the Womb, and is very vi<U+017F>ible about the thirteenth Week; till this time the Child is increa<U+017F>ed and nouri<U+017F>hed wholly by the appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition of the Chry<U+017F>taline or Albugineous Liquor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it <U+017F>wims loo<U+017F>e in the inner Membrane call'd <hi>Amnios,</hi> having no umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els formed, whereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing from the Womb-cake: But when it grows bigger, and begins to need more Nouri<U+017F>hment, the extremities of the umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els begin to grow out of the Navel by little and little, and are extended towards the Womb-cake, that they may draw a more nouri<U+017F>hing juice out of it. It has Arteries, Veins Nerves, and Lympheducts, <U+017F>ome from the Womb, and <U+017F>ome from the Chorion. But tho' they are very large and vi<U+017F>ible in the Womb, yet they <U+017F>end but very <U+017F>mall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillaries to the Womb-cake. Tho<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that come from the <hi>Chorion</hi> are Arteries and Veins, and perhaps the Lympheducts, the Arteries and Veins that come from the Womb, Spring from the Hypoga<U+017F>tricks, and from that Branch of the Spermaticks, that is in<U+017F>erted into the bottom of the Womb, the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Child come from the Chorion. The Womb-cake for the fir<U+017F>t Month <U+017F>ticks very fa<U+017F>t to the Womb, but when the Child is come to Maturity, it ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates from the Womb, and falls from it like ripe fruit from a Tree, and after the Birth makes part of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundine. Next to the Womb-cake follow the two Membranes in which the Child is wrapt, the outer is called <hi>Chorion,</hi> the inner <hi>Amnios,</hi> and when the Child is perfectly formed, there is a third betwixt the other two called <hi>Allantois.</hi> The <hi>Chorion</hi> is <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thick, <U+017F>mooth on the in<U+017F>ide, but <U+017F>omething une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual or rough; and in that part of it, that <U+017F>ticks to the Womb-cake, and thereby to the womb, there are

many Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els which ri<U+017F>e from the Womb-cake it <U+017F>elf, and the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. Twins are both encompa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed in one <hi>Chorion,</hi> but each a particular <hi>Amnios,</hi> it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Egg originally, and when the Egg is carried to the Womb, and becomes a Conception, this mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane <U+017F>ucks up the moi<U+017F>ture that abounds in the womb at that time; for while the Conception is loo<U+017F>e in the Womb, it is increa<U+017F>ed in the <U+017F>ame manner, as an Egg in a Hen, which while it is in the knot, it is only a Yolk, and when it drops off from thence, and falls thro' the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> it is not at all altered, but when it comes into the Cells of the Proce<U+017F>s of the Womb, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to gather white, tho' it adhere to no part of the Womb, nor has any Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els but as Eggs of Fi<U+017F>hes and Frogs do without procure to them<U+017F>elves whites out of the Water, or as Beans, Pea<U+017F>e, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pul<U+017F>e, and bread Corn, being <U+017F>teep'd in Moi<U+017F>ture, <U+017F>well and <U+017F>o acquire Nouri<U+017F>hment from the Bud that is <U+017F>pringing out of them. In like manner, does a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>h Moi<U+017F>ture flow out of the Wrinkles of the Womb, whence the Yolk gathers its white, and concocts it by its vegetative and innate heat: And indeed, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that abounds in the Wrinkles of the Womb, ta<U+017F>ts like the white; and in this manner, the Yolk falling by Degrees, is encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ed with a white, till at la<U+017F>t, the outmo<U+017F>t Womb having got Skins and a Shell, is brought to perfection: Even <U+017F>o the <hi>Chorion</hi> <U+017F>ucks up the albugineous Liquor that from the fir<U+017F>t Conception in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>es daily in it, and <U+017F>weats thro' the <hi>Amnios,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Embrio-<U+017F>wims, till the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and the Womb-cake are formed, from and thro' which, the Child may receive Nouri<U+017F>hment. The Liquor that it <U+017F>ucks up is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be nutritious juice <U+017F>weating out of the Capillary Orifices of the Hypoga<U+017F>trick and <U+017F>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Arteries.</p>

                              <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59975:56"/>That Membrane that immediately contains the Child is called <hi>Amnios</hi>; it is joined to the <hi>Chorion</hi> only where the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els pa<U+017F>s thro' them both into the Womb-cake, it is <U+017F>oft, <U+017F>mooth, very thin and tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and loo<U+017F>ely inve<U+017F>ts the Child, the <U+017F>hape of it is <U+017F>omewhat oval; it has Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els from the <U+017F>ame Origins, as the <hi>Chorion.</hi> This Membrane before the Egg is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, contains a clear Liquor, which after impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that out of which the Child is formed. In it re<U+017F>ides the formative power, and the matter from whence the fir<U+017F>t Lineaments of the Child are drawn. But becau<U+017F>e this Liquor is <U+017F>o very little, there <U+017F>weats thro' this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane pre<U+017F>ently part of that nutritious albugineous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that is contained in the <hi>Chorion,</hi> which it had <U+017F>uckt out of the Womb, and the Child receives its increa<U+017F>e by Addition of this humour to its undi<U+017F>cernable Rudiments. Yet after the formation of the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and the Womb cake, the <hi>Amnios</hi> receives a nutritious humour after another manner, and not as before, only by tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udation. Milky Veins come directly to the Womb-cake, acrording to the Opinion of <U+017F>ome, and out of it ari<U+017F>e others that carry the Chyle to the <hi>Amnios,</hi> but it is doubted of by others.</p>
                           <p>The Membrane call'd <hi>Allantoides</hi> is the third that encompa<U+017F><U+017F>es the whole Child; it is very probable that this as well as the other two was originally in the Egg, yet it does not appear, till after the formation of the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and Womb-cake, and 'till the Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineous Liquor cea<U+017F>es to be <U+017F>uckt up by the <hi>Chorion</hi> out of the Womb: but as <U+017F>oon as the Child begins to be nouri<U+017F>hed by the Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and the <hi>Urachus</hi> is pa<U+017F><U+017F>able, then this Membrane begins pre<U+017F>ently to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. It contains the Child's Urine, brought into it by the <hi>Urachus</hi> from the Bladder, and with which it is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more and more daily till the birth. This Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane

is very thin, <U+017F>mooth, <U+017F>oft, and yet den<U+017F>e, it may be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they have a great many Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed thro' them, but this has neither Vein nor Artery that is vi<U+017F>ible. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opening the Membranes that encompa<U+017F>s the Child, the Navel-<U+017F>tring appears, which is membranous, wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and unequal, ari<U+017F>ing from the Navel, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Womb-cake; it is about half an ell long, and a finger thick. The Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els contained in this <U+017F>tring are four, one vein, two arteries, and the <hi>Urachus</hi> wrapt in a common Coat. The Vein ri<U+017F>es from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Child, and is larger than the Arteries, and from thence pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing out of the Navel, it runs along the common Coat to the Womb-cake, into which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by many roots; but before it reaches it, it <U+017F>ends <U+017F>ome little twigs into the <hi>Amnios.</hi> It was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought, that the only u<U+017F>e of this Vein was to carry the blood from the Womb-cake to the Child, and <U+017F>ome <U+017F>till think, that it carries chyle. In the common coat are included al<U+017F>o two <U+017F>mall Arteries; they <U+017F>pring from the inner Iliack branches of the great Artery, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by the <U+017F>ides of the bladder, they ri<U+017F>e up to the Navel, out of which they are conducted with the Womb-cake, in the <U+017F>ame common cover with the Vein and <hi>Urachus</hi>; wherewith they are twined like a Rope. Spirituous blood is driven from the Child by the beating of its Heart to the Womb-cake, and the Membranes for their nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from which, what blood remains circulates back again in the umbilical vein, together with the nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous juice afre<U+017F>h imbibed by its Capillaries di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed in the Womb-cake; but Blood and Vital Spirits are not carried by the Arteries from the Mother to the Child, as <hi>Galen</hi> and many others have taught. The <hi>Urachus</hi> is the fourth Umbilical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, which is a <U+017F>mall membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, round pipe, endued with a very <U+017F>traight Cavity,

it ri<U+017F>es from the bottom of the Bladder up to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, out of which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es along within the common Cover, and opens into the <hi>allantoides</hi>; the<U+017F>e four Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els have one common Cover, which keeps each of them from touching the other, which is called <hi>funiculus,</hi> it is membranous, round and hollow, and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of a double Coat, it has <U+017F>everal knots upon it here and there, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Midwives gue<U+017F>s how many Children more the Mother <U+017F>hall have; but this is vain and <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious. This Navel Rope is wont to be tied, when the Infant is born, one or two fingers breadth from the Navel, with a <U+017F>trong thread ca<U+017F>t about it <U+017F>everal times, and then about two or three fingers breadth beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature, to be cut off; what is not cut off, is <U+017F>uffer'd to remain, 'till it drop off of its own accord.</p>
                           <p>There have been great di<U+017F>putes among Phy<U+017F>icians, with what, and by what way the Child is nouri<U+017F>hed, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay by blood alone received by the umbilical Vein, others by chile alone conveyed in by the mouth; but indeed, according to the different degrees of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that an Egg pa<U+017F><U+017F>es from a Conception to a Child fit for the Birth, it is nouri<U+017F>hed differently; for as <U+017F>oon as an Egg is ripened, and falls into the womb, it immediately <U+017F>ucks up thro' its outward membranes <U+017F>ome of that albugonious liquor, wherewith at this time the internal <U+017F>uperficies of the womb is much moi<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; and therefore as <U+017F>oon as the fir<U+017F>t liniaments of the Child begin to the drawn out of that Humour contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Amnios,</hi> they are immediately increa<U+017F>ed by the appo<U+017F>ition of the <U+017F>aid liquor <U+017F>trained out of the <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> thro' the <hi>amnios</hi> into its cavity; but when the parts of the Child begin to be a little more perfect, and the <hi>chorion</hi> is <U+017F>o den<U+017F>e, that not any more of the <U+017F>aid li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is <U+017F>uckt up by it, the umbillical Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els begin to be formed, and to extend to the <U+017F>ide of the <hi>amnios,</hi> which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59975:57"/>
they penetrate, and both the Vein and the Arteries pa<U+017F>s al<U+017F>o through the <hi>allantois</hi> and <hi>Chorion,</hi> and are implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Womb-cake, that at this time, fir<U+017F>t gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Chorion,</hi> joins it to the womb, and now the hypoga<U+017F>trick and <U+017F>permatick Arteries, that before carried the nutritious juice into the cavity of the womb, open by their orifices into the Womb-cake, where either by <U+017F>training through it, or by fermenting, they put off the <U+017F>aid juice, which is <U+017F>uckt up by the umbilical Vein, and carried by it, fir<U+017F>t to the Liver, afterwards to the Heart of the Child, where the thin <U+017F>pirituous part of it is converted into blood, but the thick and earthy part going down by the <hi>aorta</hi> enters the umbilical Arteries, and by tho<U+017F>e branches of them, that run through the <hi>amnios,</hi> is di<U+017F>charged into the cavity of it. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may ridicule this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the nutritious juice, becau<U+017F>e it is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, according to this account to chu<U+017F>e its way, as if it were a rea<U+017F>onable Creature, but they may as well expo<U+017F>e the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Chyle from the common duct to the Womb-cake, when the Child is in the Womb, for how <U+017F>hould the Chyle know, or the milky Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els by which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es, that there is any Child in the Womb, that the one <U+017F>hould offer to go that way, and the other give it way to go thither at that time; whereas the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age is <U+017F>hut at other times; and yet this, they that laugh at this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious juice, allow; and how comes the Chyle to turn its cour<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ently after the Child is born, and in<U+017F>tead of going down to the womb, ri<U+017F>e up to the brea<U+017F>ts. What rea<U+017F>on can be given for the<U+017F>e and many other things in nature? We are therefore forced to confe<U+017F>s, that there are many things in nature, that are only known to Almighty God, the maker of all things. There is al<U+017F>o another objection again<U+017F>t this opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it allows none of the Mothers blood to be received

by the Child thro' the Umbilical Vein, but only nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious juice, and how <U+017F>hould it come to pa<U+017F>s that the blood <U+017F>hould be bred in the Child, <U+017F>eeing it has blood before the Liver, or Heart, or any other part that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king blood, are in a condition to officiate. It is indeed very <U+017F>trange, how blood <U+017F>hould be made <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, but that it is made out of the Nutritious Juice, without the mixture of any from the Mother, is manife<U+017F>t by Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>'s curious Ob<U+017F>ervations concerning the order of the generation of the parts in a Chicken, which from fir<U+017F>t to la<U+017F>t receives nothing from the head; (<U+017F>ays he) there appears at the very fir<U+017F>t a red leaping Speck, a beating Bladder, and Fibres drawn from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining blood in them; and as far as one can di<U+017F>cern by in<U+017F>pection, blood is made before the leaping Speck is formed, and the <U+017F>ame has vital heat, before it is <U+017F>tir'd by the Pul<U+017F>e: And as the beating begins in the blood, and from it, <U+017F>o at la<U+017F>t, at the point of Death it ends in it. And becau<U+017F>e the beating Bladders, and the <U+017F>anguinous Fibres that are made from it, and are <U+017F>een fir<U+017F>t of all, it <U+017F>eems as if the blood were before its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles. This Worthy Author, in his Treati<U+017F>e of the generation of Animals, owns it is a Paradox, that blood <U+017F>hould be made, and moved, and have vital Spirit before any Organs for making blood or of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have a being; and that the Body <U+017F>hould be nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>hed and increa<U+017F>ed before the Stomach and Bowels the Organs of Concoction are framed. But neither of the<U+017F>e are <U+017F>tranger, than that there <U+017F>hould be Sen<U+017F>e and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before there is a Brain. And yet he <U+017F>ays in his 57<hi>th</hi> Exercitation, that the Faetus moves, contracts, and <U+017F>tretches out it <U+017F>elf, when there is nothing to be <U+017F>een for a Brain but clear water. Now if all the<U+017F>e wonderful and unaccountable things do undoubtedly come to pa<U+017F>s in an Egg, by the warmth of the Hen

The <U+017F>pinous proce<U+017F><U+017F>es of the Vertebrae of the Back are wanting; the Heart is very big, and its Ears large; there are two unions of the greater Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that are not to be <U+017F>een in grown per<U+017F>ons, namely, Fir<U+017F>t the Oval Hole, whereby there is a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age open out of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Vein into the Vein of the Lungs, ju<U+017F>t as each of them are opening, the fir<U+017F>t into the right ventricle, and the latter into the left Ventricle of the Heart; and this hole ju<U+017F>t as it opens into the Vein of the Lungs has a Valve, that hinders any thing from returning out of the <U+017F>aid Vein into the hole. Secondly, the Arterial Channel, which two fingers breadth from the Ba<U+017F>is of the Heart joins the Artery of the Lungs to the <hi>Aorta,</hi> it has a pretty large cavity, and a<U+017F>cends a little oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the <U+017F>aid Artery to the <hi>Aorta,</hi> into which it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Blood that was driven into the Artery of the Lungs out of the right Ventricle of the Heart, <U+017F>o that it never comes into the left Ventricle, as the Blood that is <U+017F>ent out of the left Ventricle into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> never came to the right, but immediatly pa<U+017F>t into it out of the hollow Vein by the Oval hole, <U+017F>o that the Blood does not pa<U+017F>s thro' both the ventricles as it does after the Child is born.

Yet though they differ thus in quality, it is not to be denied, but that the <hi>Seed</hi> of the Woman gives a mutual a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to the <hi>Seed</hi> of the Man, in the work of generation.</p>
                        <p>But it being unque<U+017F>tionable, that the men<U+017F>truous Blood is the matter of the Womans <hi>Seed,</hi> therefore that ye may know the Original of it, it is to be under<U+017F>tood that the <hi>Men<U+017F>truous blood</hi> is nothing el<U+017F>e but an <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the third concoction, gathered together every Month, and purged out.

By the great veins of the heart and liver the <hi>hollow vein,</hi> and the <hi>Aorta</hi> is the whole brea<U+017F>t generated, and after that the arms, and legs in order.</p>
                        <p>Within the fore<U+017F>aid time, is generated the la<U+017F>t and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t part of this <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, that is to <U+017F>ay, <hi>Brain,</hi> in the third little skin of this ma<U+017F>s: For the whole ma<U+017F>s of the <hi>Seed</hi> being repleat with vital <U+017F>pirits, that vital <U+017F>pirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a great part of the Genital moi<U+017F>ture into one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hollowne<U+017F>s, where the <hi>Brain</hi> is formed; outwardly it is covered with a certain covering, which being baked and dried by the heat, is reduced into a bone, and <U+017F>o is the <hi>Skull</hi> made.</p>

                           <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59975:63"/>Now the Brain is <U+017F>o formed as to conceive, retain, and change the nature of all the vital <U+017F>pirits, whence are the beginings of Rea<U+017F>on, and of all the Sen<U+017F>es; for, as out of the <hi>Liver</hi> ari<U+017F>e the <hi>Veins,</hi> out of the <hi>Heart</hi> ari<U+017F>e the <hi>Arteries,</hi> <U+017F>o out of the <hi>Brain</hi> ari<U+017F>e the <hi>Nerves</hi> of a more <U+017F>oft and gentle nature, yet not hollow like <hi>Veins,</hi> but <U+017F>ollid.

                        </p>
                        <p>After the <hi>Nerves,</hi> is generated by the <hi>Brain,</hi> al<U+017F>o the pith of the back-bone, which cannot be called <hi>Marrow</hi>: For the <hi>Marrow</hi> is a <U+017F>uperfluous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance begot out of the <hi>Blood,</hi> de<U+017F>tined for the moi<U+017F>tening, and for the <U+017F>trengthening of the bones: but the <hi>brain</hi> and pith of the back-bone take their beginning from the Seed, being not de<U+017F>tined for the nouri<U+017F>hing, or <U+017F>trengthning of the members but to con<U+017F>titute certain private and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts of the body, for the motion and u<U+017F>e the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, that all the other.

                        <p>Here is al<U+017F>o to be noted, that out of the Seed it <U+017F>elf are generated gri<U+017F>tles, bones, tunicles, for the Veins of the Liver, the arteries of the heart, the <hi>brain</hi> with its <hi>Nerves</hi>: be<U+017F>ides, the tunicles and pannicles, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coverings which the Infant is wrapt in. Now of the proper <hi>blood</hi> of the Birth, the fle<U+017F>h is formed; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever parts are of a fle<U+017F>hy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; as the heart, the liver, the lights, Then are all the<U+017F>e nouri<U+017F>hed by the men<U+017F>trous <hi>blood,</hi> which is attracted through the veins of the Navel. This is all di<U+017F>tinctly done from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception unto the eighteenth day of the fir<U+017F>t month, in all which time it is called Seed.

                        <p>Now this <hi>blood,</hi> pre<U+017F>ently after conception, is di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hed into three parts; the pure<U+017F>t of it drawn by the Child for the nouri<U+017F>hment of it <U+017F>elf; the <U+017F>econd, which is le<U+017F>s pure and thin, the <hi>Womb</hi> forces upwards to the brea<U+017F>t, where it is turned into milk. The third and mo<U+017F>t impure part of the <hi>blood</hi> remains in the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and comes away with the <hi>Secondines,</hi> both in the Birth, and after the Birth,</p>
                        <p>Now the Infant being thus formed and perfected in the <hi>womb</hi> for the fir<U+017F>t month <U+017F>ends forth its Urine thro' the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the navel; but in the la<U+017F>t month that pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age being <U+017F>hut up through the privy-members; yet notwith<U+017F>tanding, while the child is in the <hi>Womb,</hi> he voids nothing out at the <hi>Fundament,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he hath taken no nouri<U+017F>hment in at the Mouth. After the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifth day it receives life, and is then called an Infant.</p>
                        <p>Now, though the Infant hath by this time obtained <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, yet doth he not move: He mo<U+017F>t commonly moves in twice the time that he was formed, and in thrice the <U+017F>pace after he began his motion, he ha<U+017F>tens into the world; as for example, if the infant were formed in forty five days, it will move in ninety, and be born the ninth month after that.</p>

                        <p>AFter the third and fourth month, the Infant is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed with more plenty of nouri<U+017F>hment, until the time of delivery approach. Now you mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve that a child born in the <U+017F>ixth month cannot live, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on that it is not come to its ju<U+017F>t perfection; but if it be born in the <U+017F>eventh month, it will very ea<U+017F>ily live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it is come to its full perfection. Now the rea<U+017F>on why tho<U+017F>e that are born in the eighth month do not live, when as tho<U+017F>e that are born in the <U+017F>eventh do, is plain; for in the <U+017F>eventh month the Infant <U+017F>tirs it <U+017F>elf to come forth; <U+017F>o that if it have <U+017F>o much <U+017F>trength it ea<U+017F>ily performs its de<U+017F>ire; if not, it remains in the <hi>womb,</hi> till it have gathered two months more <U+017F>trength. After this motion of the <U+017F>eventh month, if it be not able to come forth, it changes it <U+017F>elf into another part of the womb, by which motion it is <U+017F>o weakened, that if it <U+017F>hould be born in the eighth month, it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it <U+017F>hould live, for it is weakened by a double mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not only that of the <U+017F>eventh month, but al<U+017F>o by that motion whereby it <U+017F>trives to go forth in the eighth month.</p>

<U+017F>pecially, either as it concerns the Male, or the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</p>
                        <p>The Male is commonly <U+017F>ituated in the right <U+017F>ide of the <hi>Womb</hi> the Female in the left.</p>
                        <p>The general <U+017F>ituation of the Child, either Male, or Female, in the <hi>Womb,</hi> is always the <U+017F>ame which hath been ob<U+017F>erved and <U+017F>een to be in this po<U+017F>ture, when the Infant lies with his Back and his Buttocks leaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the Back of the Mother, the Head inclined, and touching his Brea<U+017F>t with his Chin; re<U+017F>ting his two Hands upon his Knees; his <hi>Navel</hi> and his <hi>No<U+017F>e</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his two <hi>Knees,</hi> with his two <hi>Eyes</hi> upon his two <hi>Thumbs,</hi> his <hi>Legs</hi> folded backward, and touching his <hi>Buttocks</hi> with each <hi>Leg.</hi>

                        <p>This Figure is the mo<U+017F>t natural, as being lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <U+017F>uffer any accident, being le<U+017F>s inconvenient, and le<U+017F>s trouble<U+017F>ome to the Mother.</p>
                        <p>The mo<U+017F>t natural form for the Child to come into the World, is when the Head comes forward, the Hands being <U+017F>tretched upon the Hips.</p>
                        <p>The things which are the Cau<U+017F>es of a Womans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, are three; fir<U+017F>t, the want of re<U+017F>piration and Air for the Infant. The <U+017F>econd is the want of nouri<U+017F>hment, of which, when the Infant finds a defect in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Womb</hi> he is forced to <U+017F>eek it in another place. The third is the narrowne<U+017F>s of the place where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant lies, <U+017F>o that he is forced to <U+017F>eek room other where, which makes him to break the <hi>Membranes,</hi> wherein he was contained, pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing and con<U+017F>training the Mother by the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e <hi>Waters,</hi> to do her duty for his relea<U+017F>e. Now as <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay, there are three ways or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Childrens coming upon the Earth; Fir<U+017F>t, when the <hi>Head</hi> comes foremo<U+017F>t, and then the Woman is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily delivered: The <U+017F>econd, when it comes forth a-cro<U+017F>s, or one <U+017F>ide, or the <hi>Feet</hi> foremo<U+017F>t, and then the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59975:65"/>
<U+017F>uffers much, and either they both die, or one of them, As for tho<U+017F>e <hi>Births</hi> which are unnatural, we <U+017F>hall in another place treat of them, and their remedies. In this combate, the Infant and the Mother <U+017F>uffer very much, by rea<U+017F>on that Woman is a Creature delicate and timerous, and not patient of much labour: or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e women great with Child live a lazy and <U+017F>loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life; and be<U+017F>ides that, many times they eat bad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, which encrea<U+017F>es <hi>Humours</hi> and <U+017F>uperfluous <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which quantity of <hi>Humours</hi> makes the Woman to breath <U+017F>hort, which is a thing very trouble<U+017F>ome to the Infant; for a Woman that will expel the <hi>Birth</hi> quick, ought to keep her breath in, as much as <U+017F>he can. The third Rea<U+017F>on of the pain in Womens Travail, is by rea<U+017F>on that the <hi>Head</hi> of a Child is bigger, being compared to the <hi>Members,</hi> than the <hi>Head</hi> of any other Creature, which makes a greater <hi>opening</hi> and <hi>dilaceration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the Women that <U+017F>uffer mo<U+017F>t pain, are they who were not delivered before, having not been accu<U+017F>tomed to the <U+017F>ufferance of that labour; as al<U+017F>o elderly Women, by rea<U+017F>on that the <hi>Bone</hi> of the <hi>Pubes,</hi> the <hi>Bone</hi> of the <hi>Hip,</hi> and the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> are not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eparated, the <hi>

All this mu<U+017F>t be done <U+017F>peedily; yet if this be not <U+017F>ufficient, <U+017F>he may take the Yolk of an Egg raw, or <U+017F>he may take a <U+017F>mall draught of raw Elder-water, or you may cau<U+017F>e her to <U+017F>mell to a piece of <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>a Foetida.</hi> If <U+017F>he be troubled with <hi>Wind-Cholicks,</hi> or have taken Cold, which oftentimes doth breed Wind, which is a great hindrance to the coming forth of the <hi>Secondines</hi>; the Midwife ought to chafe the Womans <hi>Belly</hi> with her Hand, which doth not only break the <hi>wind,</hi> but cau<U+017F>es the <hi>Secondine</hi> to come down.

As for Women that are delicate, and have been accu<U+017F>tomed to live delicately, greater care mu<U+017F>t be taken of them, giving them meats that breed good nouri<U+017F>hment, and do not clog the <U+017F>tomach, forbearing al<U+017F>o to give her tho<U+017F>e meats to which <U+017F>he has too great a di<U+017F>like, agreeing to her humour, provided, that the meat which <U+017F>he loves be not hurtful; and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her for the fir<U+017F>t eight days of her lying in, boyled meats rather than ro<U+017F>ted, as gellies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the juice of Veal, or Capon, but not Mutton, it being too fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<U+017F>h: giving her to drink Barly-water, or el<U+017F>e water boyled, wherein is boyled a dram of Cinnamon to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very pint, and two ounces of Sugar di<U+017F><U+017F>olved; or if <U+017F>he do not love Sugar, Coriander-<U+017F>eed water; if <U+017F>he drink wine, let it be two thirds of water to one third of wine, giving her in the morning white-wine, and in

                        <p>TAE Travel of a Woman bringing forth two Infants is more tedious, and it many times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that one of the Children comes forth very well,

and the other comes forth very hardly; and this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that that which comes forth fir<U+017F>t, is always the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t having the power to go before the other, and to break the membranes that enveloped it. And oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times while the fir<U+017F>t is born, the other remains behind, wrapt in <U+017F>uch membranes as the former was, <U+017F>o that it remains a good <U+017F>pace behind the other, <U+017F>ometimes two hours, and yet it hath been very well born. Now knowing, that that which came fir<U+017F>t was the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t, it would not be ami<U+017F>s to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t the other in coming forth, by breaking the Membranes that contain the waters; and, if that fail, by giving <U+017F>trong Cly<U+017F>ters to excite the pain; which were it not many times done, the Child would never be able to endure the pain of coming into the World, by rea<U+017F>on of its extraordinary weakne<U+017F>s; which is <U+017F>o great <U+017F>ometimes, that the bone of the Forehead is divided, and <U+017F>eparated down to the no<U+017F>e; although the Infant being born, it joyns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again, and the Infant does very well: Which if it happen, you mu<U+017F>t have a great care to bind <U+017F>ome kind of <U+017F>oft pillow upon the place, that the air may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in.

                        <p>IT is an ordinary thing for Women that lye in, by rea<U+017F>on of their bed to lo<U+017F>e the benefit of their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which hinders the evacuation of their Milk, which cau<U+017F>es Fevers, by <U+017F>ending gro<U+017F>s vapours to the head; yet can they not be freed by any Purgation taken in at the mouth; but it would be much to the purpo<U+017F>e to take pertinent Cly<U+017F>ters which hinder the fore<U+017F>aid evils cau<U+017F>ing their brea<U+017F>ts to become full, and to become, <U+017F>tiff, taking them as occa<U+017F>ion requires, once in two or three days.

                        <head>CHAP. XX. What is to be done to Infants as <U+017F>oon as they are born.</head>
                        <p>IT is an approved Maxim, that as <U+017F>oon as a Child is born, you ought to give it a <U+017F>poonful of pure wine; for that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ts and helps the Child to regain its <U+017F>pirits Another advantage is this; that the wine cuts the flegm which the Child has in its throat; be<U+017F>ides, the <U+017F>pirit of the wine ri<U+017F>ing up to the head, comforts and <U+017F>trengthens it; and it hinders al<U+017F>o from the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep<U+017F>ie, which proceeds from the debility of the brain.</p>
                        <p>This being done, and the Mother fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, you mu<U+017F>t tye the <hi>Navel-vein</hi> with a <U+017F>ilk well twi<U+017F>ted, and many times doubled, and if there be any blood in the <hi>vein,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ure to empty it, for fear, if it <U+017F>hould be left, it <U+017F>hould turn into corruption; then it mu<U+017F>t be well dried with powder of rotten wood: You mu<U+017F>t tye it two fingers breadth from the belly, and leave it long, three fingers breadths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the tying place; and if it be fat, you mu<U+017F>t clo<U+017F>e it over and above, that the <hi>vein</hi> may be well clo<U+017F>ed, then wind the <U+017F>tring twice about it, knitting as many knots. But if the Child be come afore its time, you need not tye it <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong, for fear of cutting it with the <U+017F>ilk; but if the <hi>Navel-vein</hi> be full of water and wind, you ought then, having tied it one time, and wrapt a linnen cloth about the end of it, which is <U+017F>till to be held upward, to uncover it again, about half an hour after, and then to tye it and wrap it about again, <U+017F>till keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end up; for fear, that if the <hi>vein</hi> were not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clo<U+017F>ed, there might be <U+017F>ome danger in the bleeding.</p>
                        <p>Some people give to the Infant Treacle di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in Wine; but this mu<U+017F>t be done warily in a very <U+017F>mall quantity, and that not commonly neither.</p>

There are <U+017F>ome that think they can <U+017F>hape the head and no<U+017F>e of a Child as if it were of Wax, But let <U+017F>uch take notice that have flat no<U+017F>ed Children, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to let the no<U+017F>e alone, than by <U+017F>queezing and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing it too much to render the no<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>tructed; for that compre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the Gri<U+017F>tles of the no<U+017F>e, renders the Child liable either to <U+017F>peak alway in the no<U+017F>e, or to lo<U+017F>e his <U+017F>melling. There are <U+017F>ome Children that are born with their no<U+017F>es awry; for the help of which, you may with your finger moi<U+017F>tned in fair water, gently <U+017F>troke the no<U+017F>e, but lay no <U+017F>tre<U+017F>s upon it.

<U+017F>ufficiently dilated, that he may put in his hand, and move the <hi>Infant,</hi> if it be needful, which mu<U+017F>t be done as gently, and with as little violence as may be: He mu<U+017F>t anoint it on all parts with <U+017F>weet-butter, or good Pomatum, and <U+017F>o opening it by little and little, he may put his hand quite in; and if the waters are not yet come down, he may without any difficulty let them forth; and then at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant, if the <hi>Infant</hi> comes with the head forwards he <U+017F>hall gently turn it. to find out the feet, and when he hath found one of them, he <U+017F>hall gently draw it forth, and immediately tye a riband about it, with a knot hanging down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then let him put it in again, <U+017F>uffering part of the riband to hang out, that he may more ea<U+017F>ily be able to find out the other foot; which he <U+017F>hall quickly do, by thru<U+017F>ting up his hand along the thigh of the <hi>Infant</hi>; when he hath found it, he <U+017F>hall take the other foot, and draw them both together at an even length, giving the woman now and then <U+017F>ome lei<U+017F>ure to breath, but urging her <U+017F>till to <U+017F>train her <U+017F>elf, when <U+017F>he feels the pains coming on her: Then <U+017F>hall the <hi>Chirurgion</hi> or <hi>Midwife</hi> take a fine linnen cloth, and wrap about the thighs of the Child, le<U+017F>t by taking it naked, his fingers <U+017F>hould <U+017F>lip; in that manner drawing it forth, 'till it appear all come forth, ob<U+017F>erving <U+017F>till that the Belly and the Face be <U+017F>till kept downward.</p>

                        <p>Another thing to be ob<U+017F>erved is, that if the <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi> be <U+017F>o far advanced, that they cannot be put back, and that the Child follow it clo<U+017F>e, then are the <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi>

                        <p>If the Infant thru<U+017F>t it <U+017F>elf forwards with the buttocks formo<U+017F>t, the Midwife mu<U+017F>t put up her Hand well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, and <U+017F>o by heaving up and putting back the Buttocks <U+017F>trive to turn the Head to the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age.

                        <p>Sometimes it happens that the Child <U+017F>trives to force its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age in this po<U+017F>ture which is very dangerous.

And the <U+017F>igns differ from tho<U+017F>e of a Cancer; for in this di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the Brea<U+017F>t is white and <U+017F>hining, by rea<U+017F>on of the di<U+017F>tention; and if you touch it, it <U+017F>ounds like a drum. And if you pre<U+017F>s it with your hands, you will find that it is <U+017F>welled in all parts alike, and not in one more than another. This is Cured fir<U+017F>t by a good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of diet, taking little victuals, whereby crudities may be avoided that do afford matter to the ob<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and increa<U+017F>e windine<U+017F>s: For which cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o drink little, and that, water boyled with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, Ani<U+017F>eed, and rind of Citrons. The next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is by u<U+017F>ing things which are good to provoke the Cour<U+017F>es, (among which u<U+017F>e this Receit, <U+017F>train Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine <U+017F>tampt into po<U+017F><U+017F>et-ale, and drink it four days before the new-moon, and four days after.) And it will not be ami<U+017F>s to let blood three or four times in the year, about the time that the Cour<U+017F>es ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. For by this means you may provoke the flowers, and hinder the increa<U+017F>e either of a Scirrhus, or of a Cancer; to which purpo<U+017F>e, baths and frictions are not a little to be u<U+017F>ed.

                           <p>THE Wheals of the Womb are certain ri<U+017F>ings in the neck of the womb, which by their acrimony excite both pain and itching. The <U+017F>igns of them are an itching pain, and full of <U+017F>curf from that part, for the better <U+017F>earching of which, the In<U+017F>trument called <hi><U+017F>peculum Matricis</hi> is to be u<U+017F>ed. The Cau<U+017F>es of this are, certain cholerick, <U+017F>harp, and adu<U+017F>t humours, and thick. Among the preparing Medicines, Syrup of Fumitory is much commended, and Chichory with a decoction of Lupines. Topicks al<U+017F>o are u<U+017F>eful that di<U+017F>cu<U+017F>s and mitigate the humour, as Baths, and in<U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the wa<U+017F>hing of the place with Wine and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, which is often to be u<U+017F>ed. The<U+017F>e Wheals are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into gentle, and venemous, which are <U+017F>aid to be contagious; they are to be wa<U+017F>hed in a water thus made. Take of Aloes the quantity of a Pea; of the flower of bra<U+017F>s the quantity of half a Pea, powder the<U+017F>e, and mingle them in an ounce of white-wine, Plantain-water, and Ro<U+017F>e-water, of each an ounce, which is to be kept in a gla<U+017F>s ve<U+017F><U+017F>el.</p>

There is no need to tell the <U+017F>igns of the<U+017F>e, for they are apparent to the eye; the wrinkles are like tho<U+017F>e which appear in the hand when you clo<U+017F>e the fir<U+017F>t; but are much bigger when the cour<U+017F>es flow: they are cau<U+017F>ed by adu<U+017F>t and thick humours; <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e are with an inflamation, which have more pain and heat, and the <U+017F>welling is hard: In the cure of which, you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e in<U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and fomentations that ea<U+017F>e pain; <U+017F>ometimes they come

                           <p>The Cure of this is difficult, if there be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er falling of the Womb, if the Woman be in Age, if a Fever, Convul<U+017F>ion, or other <U+017F>ymptoms happen; if that be in women with Child, it is deadly; and <U+017F>ometimes it is corrupted by the ambient Air, and turns into a Gangrene.

Yet the cure is to be a<U+017F><U+017F>ayed five manner of ways; by the u<U+017F>e of things which do evacuate the peccant humor, which is done partly by a good order of diet, and living in a dry and temperate air; longer <U+017F>leep than ordinary, and the avoiding of exerci<U+017F>e in this ca<U+017F>e is to be ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and in<U+017F>tead thereof to u<U+017F>e moderate frictions: All repletion, and a loo<U+017F>e belly are naught; the meat that <U+017F>he eats mu<U+017F>t be little, and contrary to the humour that offends, as rear Eggs, Milk, Chicken-broths, and the meat of them, dry Rai<U+017F>ins, Almonds, and Pi<U+017F>taches. For her drink, it ought to be chiefly the decoction of Barly or Liquori<U+017F>h.</p>
                           <p>In the next place, it will not be ami<U+017F>s to let blood in the Ba<U+017F>ilick Vein: let her take <U+017F>ome convenient purge according to the humour which abounds: Vomitings al<U+017F>o and frictions may be u<U+017F>ed, and the provoking of <U+017F>weat by the decoction of Guaiacum, Sal<U+017F>aparil, and China-root, which are very proper to turn away the humors from the Matrix.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes this happens from an intemperancy of the womb, which if it be cold, the womb is not able to concoct <U+017F>ufficient quantity of nouri<U+017F>hment, and therefore heaps up together many excrements; if it be moi<U+017F>t, it is not able to contain either the blood, or the <U+017F>eed, or the birth, as it <U+017F>hould do. The cure of this is above touched in the Chapter of Di<U+017F>tempers.</p>
                           <p>There is another difference which is taken from the occult qualities which the womb is <U+017F>een to have, there being a <U+017F>ympathy and antipathy between that and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, as to covet the <U+017F>eed of Man, and to love <U+017F>weet things; and then the affection ari<U+017F>es from no evident cau<U+017F>e, there being no exce<U+017F>s of coldne<U+017F>s, or moi<U+017F>ture to be apprehended.

                           <p>Sometimes the difference ari<U+017F>eth in this, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat is either <U+017F>uffocated or di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated; this affection is <U+017F>omething dangerous, becau<U+017F>e it is a difficult matter to re<U+017F>tore the natural heat.

                           <p>Another difference there is, when there happens a clo<U+017F>ing up of the skin, which is cau<U+017F>ed after Cicatri<U+017F>ing of an Ulcer, or by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome skin or Membrane growing to the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Womb, or by rea<U+017F>on of frequent Abortion; after which the<U+017F>e Veins to which the Secondines adhere, do grow together <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e that they cannot be afterwards opened.</p>
                           <p>Another difference of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e there is, when it happens through want of Blood, which is not genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either by rea<U+017F>on of external cau<U+017F>es, as Famine, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much evacuation, I<U+017F><U+017F>ues, and <U+017F>uch like; or through internal cau<U+017F>es, as a frigid Con<U+017F>titution of the principal parts, old Age, and Fevers; or when it is converted to other u<U+017F>es, as before full growth, to the nouri<U+017F>hment of

the Body: In Women with Child, to the nouri<U+017F>hment of the Birth: In tho<U+017F>e that give <U+017F>uck, to the increa<U+017F>e of Milk: And in fat people, to the augmentation of the Fat: Or when it is con<U+017F>umed either by External cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, as over much Exerci<U+017F>e, Affrights, Terrors, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, Baths, overmuch Sweating, which do con<U+017F>ume the <U+017F>erous quality of the Blood; or through Internal Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, as are hot and dry Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, or over-great evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in other parts of the Body. Sometimes another difference of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e proceeds from the dryne<U+017F>s of the Blood, which happens to Women, who in the Winter time do too much heat their lower parts, by putting Coals under their Coats.

                           <p>THE dropping of the Flowers is, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down for many days together drop by drop.</p>
                           <p>This happens both from external cau<U+017F>es, as over hard labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>And <U+017F>ometimes from the dro<U+017F><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of the blood, the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age not being wide enough. For the cure of this, it is convenient to open a Vein in the Arm with gentle purging, as in the former Chapter.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes from the weakne<U+017F>s of the retentive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there being at that time great plenty, thinne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>ero<U+017F>ity of the blood.

                           <p>The difficulty of the Flowers is when they come down with pain and trouble, either through defect in the Veins, or in the Blood. The <U+017F>igns of this are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the relation of the <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on, who is then much troubled with pain in the Head, Stomach, and Loins, and lower parts of the body.

flow altogether, or drop by drop, as in the former di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e; It is a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e more incident to Maids than mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Women, becau<U+017F>e the Veins of the Womb are le<U+017F>s open in them, than in tho<U+017F>e who brought forth Children.</p>
                           <p>It happens <U+017F>ometimes from a corruption of the blood, that is, from the dro<U+017F><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s and thickne<U+017F>s thereof, and then the blood clots together; and there is a great pain long before the Flowers begin to come down. The Cure of this is performed by attenuating Medicines. Sometimes from the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s and acrimony of the Blood, which proceeds from a mixture of <U+017F>harp hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours with the Body, and then the genital parts do itch. It is cured by tho<U+017F>e Medicines that temper the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of the Humour, as the four greater Seeds, Violets, and Flowers of Nenuphar. Sometimes from windy Vapours, and then the pain comes by intervals, and is <U+017F>uddenly exa<U+017F>perated, rumbling up and down; and when the wind is forth, the pain cea<U+017F>eth.

                           <p>THE over much flux of the Cour<U+017F>es is either a more abundant, or a more la<U+017F>ting Purgation of the Cour<U+017F>es, through <U+017F>ome defect, either in the blood, or the womb, or the veins of the womb.</p>
                           <p>The <U+017F>igns are evident, <hi>viz.</hi> want of Appetite, Crudities, a bad colour in the face, a <U+017F>welling in the feet, and the re<U+017F>t of the body, a waxing lean of the body; and in brief, a general ill habit of body.</p>
                           <p>The Cure (if it be of any continuance) is difficult; if it happen to an aged woman, there is none at all. It requires a revul<U+017F>ion, or drawing back of the blood, interception, and incra<U+017F><U+017F>ation, or thickning thereof, and a clo<U+017F>ing up of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els by a<U+017F>tringent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. Yet ob<U+017F>erve that they mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>topt by degrees. To this effect, you may take this Powder.</p>
                           <p>Take of the <U+017F>eed of White Henbane, red Coral, of each half a dram, white Camphor half a <U+017F>cruple, and give the quantity of half a dram at a time; powder of Amber, Dragons-blood, Blood<U+017F>tones, Red Coral, Lettice <U+017F>eed, of each one dram, Balau<U+017F>t two <U+017F>cruples, <hi>Bole armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack</hi> two drams, given in three ounces of Plantain-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, A<U+017F><U+017F>es milk heated with Steel. You may externally al<U+017F>o apply a girdle made of the brui<U+017F>ed leaves of Bares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot.</p>
                           <p>Of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e there are many differences: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happens from the blood which is derived from the bottom of the Womb, where for the mo<U+017F>t part lies
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59975:128"/>
the blacke<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t clotted blood; or from the neck of the Womb, which is more red and fluid. Another difference ari<U+017F>eth from the plenty of blood, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this, that the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are either broken or much opened, e<U+017F>pecially in tho<U+017F>e women who have had a <U+017F>toppage in their Cour<U+017F>es for a time, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently break out again. The <U+017F>igns of this are evident; that is to <U+017F>ay, a fulne<U+017F>s of blood in the body; be<U+017F>ides that, the blood which comes forth ea<U+017F>ily curdles.</p>
                           <p>In the Cure, you mu<U+017F>t have recour<U+017F>e to blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which if you do for evacuation, it mu<U+017F>t be done in the Hepatick Vein: If the woman be weak, in <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatella</hi> of both hands. In the next place the u<U+017F>e of Cupping-Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es is to be commended, being applied with <U+017F>carification to the back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, without <U+017F>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification to the Brea<U+017F>t, being u<U+017F>ed again when the woman is troubled with difficulty of breathing. In the third place, ligatures and frictions of the Arms are to be u<U+017F>ed.</p>
                           <p>Another difference of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e ari<U+017F>es from a <U+017F>harp blood, which is known by the gnawing of the humor upon the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. In the Cure, you mu<U+017F>t purge with <U+017F>yrup of Ro<U+017F>es <U+017F>olutive, or with leaves of <hi>Sena</hi>; a pe<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary of Sows dung and A<U+017F><U+017F>es dung, which is made up with Plantain water, and the mu<U+017F>cilage of the <U+017F>eed of Quinces, is here of u<U+017F>e if need require.</p>
                           <p>Another difference ari<U+017F>es from a <U+017F>erous and watry blood; for either the Liver is weakned, or the Veins <U+017F>o debilitated, that it cannot attract the <U+017F>erous or wheyie humour in the blood: in this ca<U+017F>e, the blood flows not forth in <U+017F>uch a quantity, nor is ea<U+017F>ily curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: If a Cloth be dipped in it, and then dried in the <U+017F>hade, it pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>colours. In the Cure hereof you mu<U+017F>t look to the rectifying of the weakne<U+017F>s of the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59975:129"/>
Reins and Liver with convenient remedies, for which purpo<U+017F>e the Livers of Foxes, Calves, Hens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are very good.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes from a Rupture of the Veins, which proceeds either from a fulne<U+017F>s of blood, or from Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es that do vehemently <U+017F>tir up the blood, e<U+017F>pecially from hard labour; if it be needful, you mu<U+017F>t let blood, and apply conglutinating Medicines.</p>
                           <p>Or from a gnawing of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which is known by this, that <U+017F>ometimes there flows forth little blood, and that purulent, and full of the wheyie or <U+017F>erous humor. It ari<U+017F>es from a <U+017F>harp and corrupt blood, and <U+017F>ometimes from the u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>harp Medicines. Among the a<U+017F>tringent Medicines, the root of <hi>Filipendula</hi> is much to be commended, or a decoction of the <U+017F>ame Root.</p>

                           <p>THE Whites is an inordinate eruption of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humour collected together through <U+017F>ome vitiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the blood. It affects Women chiefly, and <U+017F>ometimes al<U+017F>o Virgins, of which there are Examples: Yet it is more often in women, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be of a moi<U+017F>t con<U+017F>titution, and live an idle and delicate life, eating <U+017F>uch things as are cold and moi<U+017F>t. Old women al<U+017F>o are affected herewith through the abundance of Flegm, and the weakne<U+017F>s of the concoctive faculty.</p>
                           <p>It differs from the Gonorrhea, becau<U+017F>e in that the <U+017F>eminal matter is white, and thicker; and flows by long intervals, and i<U+017F><U+017F>ues forth in a le<U+017F><U+017F>er quantity from a nocturnal pollution; for that is joyned with venereal imaginations, and only happens in the time of <U+017F>leep. It differs from the di<U+017F>colouring of the Flowers; for they though not exactly, do always ob<U+017F>erve their
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59975:129"/>
times of Flowing. Be<U+017F>ides, they happen not to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, or <U+017F>uch who<U+017F>e Cour<U+017F>es are <U+017F>topped. It differs from the putrid humour that i<U+017F><U+017F>ues from the Ulcers of the Womb, becau<U+017F>e that is joyned with the <U+017F>igns of an Ulcer, and the putrefaction is thicker and whiter; if it be mattery, it is coloured with blood, and i<U+017F><U+017F>ues forth with pain.</p>
                           <p>The Cure of this mu<U+017F>t be ha<U+017F>tned, becau<U+017F>e in a <U+017F>hort time it endangers the making of women barren, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing them to be lean, to fall into a Con<U+017F>umption, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, the Drop<U+017F>ie, fall of the Womb, Swoonings, and Convul<U+017F>ions; which is the cau<U+017F>e that though it be not hard to be cured in the beginning, yet it is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very difficult; for by this means the whole body accu<U+017F>toms it <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>end forth its excrements this way, and the Womb being now weakned, gathers excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments apace.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes it proceeds from the whole body, and then you may perceive the <U+017F>igns of an ill humor through the whole body. In the Cure of this, you mu<U+017F>t avoid blood-letting, for that the bad humor mu<U+017F>t not be recalled to defile the blood; be<U+017F>ides, that the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is a <U+017F>ufficient weakning and con<U+017F>uming of the body. The humor is di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the decoction of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and Lentisk-wood. For the drying up of the humor, the Root of <hi>Filipendula</hi> doth very much conduce. For a<U+017F>tringent Medicines you may u<U+017F>e chiefly the powder of dead men's bones, the a<U+017F>hes of Capons-dung in rain water. The Patient mu<U+017F>t avoid <U+017F>leeping upon her back, le<U+017F>t the heat of the Lungs <U+017F>hould carry the humors toward the Womb: Frictions al<U+017F>o of the upper parts, for the diver<U+017F>ion of the humor may be u<U+017F>ed.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes it is cau<U+017F>ed by the Womb it <U+017F>elf, and then there will appear <U+017F>igns of the affection of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59975:130"/>
Womb, and the Flux is not <U+017F>o great. For the Cure of this, Suffumigations of Frankincen<U+017F>e, Labdanum, Ma<U+017F>tick, and Sanders are very requi<U+017F>ite.</p>

                           <p>This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is very frequent, the Procatartick or external Cau<U+017F>es of it, are either violent motions of the body, or, which is much oftner, vehement commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Mind from <U+017F>ome <U+017F>udden a<U+017F><U+017F>ault, either of Anger or Grief, or the like Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions.

of the Spirits, upon which account too many of them in a crowd, contrary to proportion, are hurried violently upon this or that part, occa<U+017F>ioning Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions and pain, when they ru<U+017F>h upon parts indued with exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, perverting the functions of the Organs, both of that into which they thru<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, and al<U+017F>o of that from whence they departed, both being much injured by this unequal di<U+017F>tribution, which is quite contrary to the Oeconomy of Nature.</p>
                           <p>The Origen and Antecedent Cau<U+017F>e of this confu<U+017F>ion, is a weak con<U+017F>titution of the Spirits, whether it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or adventitious; for which Rea<U+017F>on they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated upon any occa<U+017F>ion, and their Sy<U+017F>tem <U+017F>oon broke: For as the outward Man is framed with parts obvious to <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o without doubt the inward Man con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of a due Series, and as it were a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the Spirits, to be viewed only by the eye of Rea<U+017F>on; and as this is nearly joyned, and as it were united with the con<U+017F>titution of the Body, <U+017F>o much the more ea<U+017F>ily or more difficultly is its frame di<U+017F>ordered, by how much the Con<U+017F>titutive Principles that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted us by Nature, are more or le<U+017F>s firm. That the <U+017F>aid Confu<U+017F>ion of the Spirits is the cau<U+017F>e of Hy<U+017F>teric Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, will appear by Mother-Fits, wherein the Spirits are crowded in the lower Belly, and ru<U+017F>hing together violently towards the Jaws, occa<U+017F>ion Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions in every region thro' which they pa<U+017F>s, blowing up the Belly like a great Ball, which is yet nothing but the rowling together or conglobation of the parts <U+017F>eized with the Convul<U+017F>ion, which cannot be <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed without great violence. The external parts in the the mean while, and the Fle<U+017F>h being in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titute of Spirits, by rea<U+017F>on they are carried another way, are often <U+017F>o very cold, not only in this kind, but in all other kind of Hy<U+017F>teric Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, that dead

Bodies are not colder, but the Pul<U+017F>e are as good as tho<U+017F>e of People that are well; nor is the Womans life in danger by this cold, unle<U+017F>s it is occa<U+017F>ioned by <U+017F>ome very large evacuation going before.</p>
                           <p>And the inordinate agitation of the Spirits di<U+017F>turb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blood, is the cau<U+017F>e of the clear and copious Urine; for when the Oeconomy of the blood is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the Sick cannot long enough contain the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum that is imported, but lets it go, before it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with <U+017F>aline particles, whereby the Citron colour is to be imparted to it, whereof we have daily experiment in tho<U+017F>e that drink much, e<U+017F>pecially of thin and attenuating Liquors; for then their Urine is very clear; in which ca<U+017F>e, the blood being over-power'd by that quantity of <U+017F>erum, and being wholly unable to retain it, puts it off quite clear, not yet died by the juice of the Body, by rea<U+017F>on of its too <U+017F>hort <U+017F>tay.</p>
                           <p>As to the Cold, by which the external parts are <U+017F>o often chilled, it is very manife<U+017F>t that that happens, becau<U+017F>e the Spirits for<U+017F>aking their <U+017F>tations too officiou<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, intrude them<U+017F>elves into this or that part. Nor is it to be doubted, that weeping and laughing fits, which often <U+017F>ei<U+017F>e hy<U+017F>terical women without any occa<U+017F>ion, are procured by the Animal Spirits forcing them<U+017F>elves vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon the Organs that perform the<U+017F>e Animal functions.</p>

there is no excellent and powerful Remedy, which has not received its chief Vertues from Nature: Upon which account, grateful Antiquity call'd excellent Medicines God's handicraft. Next to the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the <U+017F>teel, I chu<U+017F>e the Syrrup of it, prepared with the fileings of Steel or Iron, infu<U+017F>ed in the cold in Rheni<U+017F>h Wine, 'till the Wine is <U+017F>ufficiently impregnated, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <U+017F>trained, and boiled up to the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of a Syrrup, with a <U+017F>ufficient quantity of Sugar. Nor do I u<U+017F>e any purging Medicine at <U+017F>et times, during the whole Chalybeat cour<U+017F>e, for I think the Vertue of the Steel is de<U+017F>troy'd by a purge in hy<U+017F>terical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; and when the chief de<U+017F>ign is to reduce the Spirits to order, and to renew and confirm their Sy<U+017F>tem.</p>
                           <p>If any one objects that fileings of Steel may hurt tho<U+017F>e that take them, by <U+017F>ticking in their Bowels, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s they are purged now and then; I an<U+017F>wer fir<U+017F>t, that I never found any <U+017F>uch thing in any one, and it is much more probable, that being involved in the <U+017F>lime, and with the Excrementious humours of the parts, they <U+017F>hould at length pa<U+017F>s away with them, than when they are exagitated by purging Medicines, which occa<U+017F>ion unu<U+017F>ual compre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, twi<U+017F>ting and contraction of the guts, whereby the particles of the <U+017F>teel, thru<U+017F>t upon the coats of the Bowels, may penetrate deeper into them. When the patient is in a Steel cour<U+017F>e, remedies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd Hy<U+017F>terics are to be u<U+017F>ed, as it were by the by, to comfort the Blood and animal Spirits; in that manner and form, which is mo<U+017F>t agreeable to the <U+017F>ick. But if <U+017F>he can take them in a <U+017F>olid form, they will more powerfully retain the Spirits in their office and place, than things that are liquid; for the very <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance affects the Stomach longer with its <U+017F>avour, and works more forcibly upon the body, than either deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or infu<U+017F>ions.

I have touched upon above, I u<U+017F>e to pre<U+017F>cribe the<U+017F>e few and common things, which commonly do what I de<U+017F>ire. Let eight ounces of blood be taken from the Arm, the next Morning let her enter upon the u<U+017F>e of the Pills of Coch. Major and of Ca<U+017F>tor, as they are mentioned in the Chapter of the Green-Sickne<U+017F>s, and let them be repeated, as it is there ordered. Take of Galbanum di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in tincture of Ca<U+017F>tor, and <U+017F>trained three drams, Tachamacha two drams, make a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter to be apply'd to the Navel.</p>

                           <p>It is to be noted that <U+017F>ome Women do <U+017F>o abhor hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teric Medicines, that they are much injured thereby, therefore they mu<U+017F>t not be given to <U+017F>uch.</p>

                           <p>BArrenne<U+017F>s is an impotence to conceive, coming from defect either of the Genitals, or of the blood, or of the men<U+017F>truous blood.</p>
                           <p>Fir<U+017F>t, through the defect of the Genitals, either by the clo<U+017F>ing up of the Orifice of the womb, which may be cut and opened by Art; or through the narrowne<U+017F>s of the parts, for <U+017F>o they will not admit the Yard; or by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome Ulcers or Excre<U+017F>cencies in the neck of the womb.

If the Infant be young, the Nur<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ure to keep a good diet, ab<U+017F>taining from all raw fruits, Pea<U+017F>e and Beans, and all milky things, and any thing that <U+017F>hall be of a hard concoction: Next, you may lay a plai<U+017F>ter of the Ma<U+017F>s of Pills <hi>Sine quibus,</hi> half a dram, pouder of Wormwood one dram, Myrrh and Aloes of each two <U+017F>cruples, meal of Lupines a dram and a half, the Gall of an Ox as much as <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth; if the Infant be any thing grown, you may give him in a little broth a <U+017F>mall quantity of Harts-horn.</p>

                           <p>THe Signs of Convul<U+017F>ion are the hanging backward of the head, in<U+017F>omuch that the hinder part of the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59975:143"/>
head <U+017F>eemeth to touch the <U+017F>houlders; <U+017F>ometimes the head and the neck hang <U+017F>o far forward, that the Chin touches the Brea<U+017F>t.</p>
                           <p>The Cure of this: If it come of too great abundance of humours, let the Air wherein the Child is nur<U+017F>ed be hot and dry, and exerci<U+017F>e much; let the Nur<U+017F>e not <U+017F>leep long, e<U+017F>pecially after dinner; and let her diet be rather drying than any way moi<U+017F>t. If the Child do not <U+017F>uck he mu<U+017F>t avoid Meats that do trouble the head, and fill it up with Vapors, or <U+017F>limy meats that may <U+017F>top the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the Veins: Sweet things are very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but Honey and Water wherein a little Sage and Betony have been boiled, it will not be ami<U+017F>s to give him: If purgation be needful, let the Nur<U+017F>e rather than the Child purge, which may be performed with <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ia</hi> or <hi>Manna.</hi> If the Child be any thing big, let his Belly be kept loo<U+017F>e, by giving him a little water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Sena</hi> hath been <U+017F>teeped 24 hours, tempering it with a very <U+017F>mall quantity of the juice of Citron; or you may give him a little of the pouder of <hi>Diacarthamum</hi> in the pap of an Apple.</p>
                           <p>If the Convul<U+017F>ion comes of drine<U+017F>s or emptine<U+017F>s, or by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome great evacuation, flux of the Belly, vomiting, hunger, or the like, the Child mu<U+017F>t be nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed in an Air more moi<U+017F>t than dry, and his diet mu<U+017F>t be the <U+017F>ame. The be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t approved remedy is to apply a cautery in the hinder part of the Head to the nook of the Neck, between the <U+017F>econd and third <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra,</hi> which may be done to new born Children; Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions al<U+017F>o of the Legs, Back-bone and Thighs are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable; as al<U+017F>o Cupping-Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es applied to the Thighs and Legs.</p>
                           <p>If the Convul<U+017F>ion come by rea<U+017F>on of the Worms, you may give him this Cly<U+017F>ter. Take of <U+017F>imple Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromel four ounces, new butter one ounce, powdered

Aloes half a dram, and make a Cly<U+017F>ter. Or you may give him two drams of Earthworms killed, dried and poudered, Sugar poudered one ounce, and let the Child take two drams of it every day in a <U+017F>poonful of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice-water.</p>
                           <p>If any venemous Vapour be the cau<U+017F>e hereof, let him take <U+017F>ix grains of Treacle, or Mithridate in Mint-water.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. The Generation of Man, compared with the production of Plants.</head>
                     <p>THAT the rea<U+017F>on of this Generation may be made the more plain and evident unto us, we will declare by a brief demon<U+017F>tration, that there is the <U+017F>ame begining of Plants and Herbs, and of other things which fall under the <U+017F>ame con<U+017F>ideration; therefore as in the <U+017F>eeds of every kind, the grain it <U+017F>elf ca<U+017F>t into the Earth, is the food, and as it were the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject of all the alteration following, whereby it buds and <U+017F>prings, is augmented and grows up into a nature like unto it; <U+017F>o meat being taken, affordeth in mans body the fir<U+017F>t matter to a variable concoction. And as in Plants we may ob<U+017F>erve a mo<U+017F>t certain <U+017F>eparation of the pure from the impure, and of the remnant from the <U+017F>uperfluous matter; <U+017F>o here we perceive a natural <U+017F>eparation and <U+017F>eque<U+017F>tration of that which is unprofitable, from that which is profitable, by their certain degrees: For fir<U+017F>t the <U+017F>eed being committed to the Earth, by and by <U+017F>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the moi<U+017F>ture of the <U+017F>ame, <U+017F>trippeth it <U+017F>elf from that little skin, in which it was inclo<U+017F>ed, and <U+017F>pringing upward, ca<U+017F>teth forth the <U+017F>ame being empty, as a dry Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, the grain in the mean time budding and <U+017F>prout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, that it may proceed forward toward the increa<U+017F>e; afterward the increa<U+017F>e and growth <U+017F>tretching even to the fruit di<U+017F>robed and bereaved of the Flower, the <U+017F>econd purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ca<U+017F>teth down the flower <U+017F>prung up in the top of the bough, but pre<U+017F>erveth the hope of the Fruit, being <U+017F>tripped of his flower, as that thing which remaineth pure and profitable by the <U+017F>econd purging. Afterwards the Fruit being grown to its ju<U+017F>t quantity, the third alteration ca<U+017F>teth down the leaves, as the <U+017F>uperfluity of this degree; but ordaineth the fruit, being now <U+017F>o of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59975:149"/>
clean<U+017F>ed and purged, for the utility of mans nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment, maturity, and ripene<U+017F>s being granted unto it. Put now, either the <U+017F>eed breaketh, the fruit lying hid in it, or el<U+017F>e it <U+017F>endeth it out by putrefaction; and being ca<U+017F>t into the ground it ha<U+017F>teneth again into the property of its own nature, not tending towards it <U+017F>elf, which is remaining, but to the likene<U+017F>s of its fir<U+017F>t origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, from whence it had its begining; <U+017F>o that in this it appeareth ab<U+017F>olutely true, that Nature ingendereth things like unto it <U+017F>elf; for every thing doth naturally covet and de<U+017F>ire the form and likene<U+017F>s of that form whence it is bred: Hence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that Apples grow not from Pears, nor Pears from any other kind of fruit, unle<U+017F>s it be <U+017F>o brought about by the means of grafting and planting. And the <U+017F>ame thing is to be acknowledged in the generation of Man and Woman, which is to be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed in the growing of Plants and Herbs; that becau<U+017F>e we <U+017F>ee bodies well di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by Members to be engendred of <U+017F>eed, we may al<U+017F>o believe that the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>eed is derived from the di<U+017F>tinct and <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the body; wherefore let tho<U+017F>e be advi<U+017F>ed what they <U+017F>ay, who affirm the <U+017F>eed of generation to be ingendred of the Brain only, when as it is not <U+017F>o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the con<U+017F>ideration of the Concoctions, nor to the con<U+017F>titution of the bodies. True it is, that <U+017F>ome, and that not a <U+017F>mall part, is derived from the Brain, but the chiefe<U+017F>t part is collected together from the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t parts of the whole body: For if we <U+017F>ay, that this <U+017F>hould be ingendred of one or two parts only; every one would find that this con<U+017F>equence would follow by an infallible rea<U+017F>on, namely, that tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ame parts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>hould be ingendred again: Therefore we may more rightly conclude, that be<U+017F>ides that beginning which it draweth from the Brain, it is ingendred from the whole body, and the mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>pecial parts of the <U+017F>ame,

                     <p>IT may well be admired, what the rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>hould be, that Nature being <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e and provident in all her actings, <U+017F>hould neverthele<U+017F>s be <U+017F>o over<U+017F>een in a work of <U+017F>o <U+017F>pecial regard as Mankind, that for one whom <U+017F>he produceth wi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>olid and judicious, <U+017F>he bringeth <U+017F>o many into the World of tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, half witted, and void of prudence: But having <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly con<U+017F>ider'd with my <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>earcht into the rea<U+017F>on of natural cau<U+017F>es of this <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a matter; I ea<U+017F>ily found the true rea<U+017F>on to be this, namely, that Parents apply not them<U+017F>elves to the act of generation, with that order and diligence that is required by nature, nor know the conditions which ought to be ob<U+017F>erved, that their Children may prove wi<U+017F>e and judicious. Now if by art we may procure a remedy for this, we <U+017F>hall have brought to the Common-wealth the greate<U+017F>t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit <U+017F>he can receive. The main difficulty of this matter
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59975:150"/>
chiefly con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth herein, that we cannot di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in terms <U+017F>o <U+017F>eemly and mode<U+017F>t, as exact decency would require; but if for this rea<U+017F>on I <U+017F>hould forbear to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon any particular note or ob<U+017F>ervation, the whole bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s would be of <U+017F>mall validity; fora<U+017F>much as divers grave Authors are of opinion, that wi<U+017F>e men ordinarily beget fooli<U+017F>h Children, becau<U+017F>e in the act of Copulation they ab<U+017F>tain from certain diligences, which are of importance that the Son may partake of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wi<U+017F>dom.</p>
                     <p>For the more Methodical proceeding, I have thought good to divide the matter of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e into four principal parts. The fir<U+017F>t is to <U+017F>hew the natural quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and temperature which Man and Woman ought to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s, that they may u<U+017F>e Generation. The <U+017F>econd, what diligence the Parents ought to imploy, that their Children may be male, and not Female. The third, how they may become wi<U+017F>e and not fools. The fourth, how they are to be ordered after their birth for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation of their wit. As to the fir<U+017F>t point: Divers both ancient and modern Authors have delivered their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions to this effect, that in a well ordered Common-wealth, there ought to be a<U+017F><U+017F>igned certain <U+017F>urveyors of Marriages, who <U+017F>hould have skill and judgment <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to look into the qualities of the per<U+017F>ons that are to be married; and to allot to every woman a husband, and to every man a wife agreeable and proportionable to them in all re<U+017F>pects: But whether <U+017F>uch a thing be of ab<U+017F>olute nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity in a State, or no, let it lye upon the care and con<U+017F>ideration of <U+017F>uch as take upon them to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e the affairs of Common-wealths. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> took much pains in pre<U+017F>cribing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Precepts about this matter, with <U+017F>everal rules to know what <U+017F>ort of Women were fruitful, and what not; what men were able for generation, and what di<U+017F>able:
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59975:151"/>
But touching all this, they deliver very little to the purpo<U+017F>e, and that not with <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>tinction as is requi<U+017F>ite for the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in hand, therefore it will be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to begin this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e from its principles, and briefly to give the <U+017F>ame its due order and method that <U+017F>o we may plainly and clearly demon<U+017F>trate from what Union of Parents wi<U+017F>e children are generated, and from what fools and faineants i<U+017F><U+017F>ue. To which end is needful: Fir<U+017F>t to be informed of a particular point of Philo<U+017F>ophy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the knowledge of which depends all that which is to be delivered touching this fir<U+017F>t point; and that's this, that man is different from Woman in nothing el<U+017F>e, as <hi>Galen</hi> al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erves, than in having his genital Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers without his body whereas a woman hath all the very <U+017F>ame parts within, <U+017F>o that if, when nature hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed her work in the formation of man, <U+017F>he would convert him into a Woman, there needs nothing el<U+017F>e to be done, <U+017F>aving only to turn the Organs of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inward, and if, having formed a woman <U+017F>he would transform her to a man, <U+017F>he may effect it by doing the contrary: But whether or no the<U+017F>e things have hapned, as <U+017F>ome affirm they have, and of the certainty of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodites</hi> being found in nature, may more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diou<U+017F>ly be referred to a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e by it <U+017F>elf. Now what might be the cau<U+017F>e that the genital Members are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred within, or without, and that the creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Male or Female, is a thing plain and evident enough to demon<U+017F>trate, con<U+017F>idering that heat extendeth and enlargeth all things, and cold retaineth and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth them up; <U+017F>o that it is concluded by all that are knowing in Philo<U+017F>ophy and natural cau<U+017F>es, that if the <U+017F>eed be cold and moi<U+017F>t, a woman is begotten, not a man: And if the <U+017F>ame be hot and dry, a man is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not a Woman: Whence it is to be inferred, that there is no man to be termed cold in re<U+017F>pect of a woman, nor woman hot in re<U+017F>pect of a man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:59975:151"/>This therefore is to be noted as a thing without all controver<U+017F>ie or exception, that the qualities which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a woman fruitful, are cold and moi<U+017F>ture, the womb holding the <U+017F>ame proportion with mans <U+017F>eed, that the earth doth with Corn or any other grain; and we <U+017F>ee, that if the earth want cold and moi<U+017F>ture, the <U+017F>eed will not pro<U+017F>per; and that tho<U+017F>e are the mo<U+017F>t fertile <U+017F>oyls which partake mo<U+017F>t of cold and moi<U+017F>t: yet the<U+017F>e two qualities ought to keep a certain mea<U+017F>urablene<U+017F>s, le<U+017F>t that, either by exce<U+017F>s, or deficiency, generation be <U+017F>poyled; for as the Corn is vitiated by exce<U+017F>s of rain, and overmuch cold; <U+017F>o in conception the <U+017F>eed may be choaked by over-abundance of the<U+017F>e qualities; and on the other <U+017F>ide, if tho<U+017F>e parts in a woman <U+017F>hould be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate as in a man, it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or be a woman: Nor could <U+017F>he breed that fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick blood which ingendereth milk, by which, as <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hypocrates</hi> affirm, the birth is nouri<U+017F>hed while it remaineth in the mothers belly; neither could <U+017F>he be beardle<U+017F>s, or void of hair, if <U+017F>he were overmuch inclining to hot and dry. Neverthele<U+017F>s, all women are not cold and moi<U+017F>t alike, there being of the<U+017F>e qualities <U+017F>everal degrees, <U+017F>ome being cold and moi<U+017F>t in the fir<U+017F>t degree, <U+017F>ome in the <U+017F>econd, <U+017F>ome in the third, and in each of the<U+017F>e they may conceive, if a man an<U+017F>wer them in proportion of heat. As for the <U+017F>igns of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of coldne<U+017F>s and moi<U+017F>ture in women, though hitherto they have not been taken notice of by any, yet it will be very requi<U+017F>ite in this place to con<U+017F>ider them according to the <U+017F>everal effects, which each of the<U+017F>e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees produceth. Fir<U+017F>t, by the quick apprehen<U+017F>ion and acutene<U+017F>s of wit in women, for if they be very witty and acute, they are to be judged cold and moi<U+017F>t in the fir<U+017F>t degree only; if very <U+017F>hallow and <U+017F>imple, in the third degree, but if they partake of a middle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59975:152"/>
between the<U+017F>e two extreams, it <U+017F>ignifieth that they are in the <U+017F>econd degree. Secondly, their Conditions; they being either cur<U+017F>t, or good natured, according to the<U+017F>e three degrees. Thirdly, their voice; which is either <U+017F>hrill, or big according as they are more or le<U+017F>s cold and moi<U+017F>t. Fourthly, their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance in fle<U+017F>h; leanne<U+017F>s being a <U+017F>ign of little coldne<U+017F>s and moi<U+017F>ture; gro<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s or over much corpulency, of the redundance of tho<U+017F>e qualities: to be meanly fle<U+017F>hed, betokeneth the <U+017F>econd degree. Fifthly, the colour of their face; which is either white, or <U+017F>warthy, as the<U+017F>e qualities are inten<U+017F>e or remi<U+017F>s; of the <U+017F>econd degree is compo<U+017F>ed a fre<U+017F>h and lively colour. Sixthly, their hair; which is al<U+017F>o either much, or little, according to the exuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or defect of cold and moi<U+017F>t. Seventhly, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om form and proportion of body is the re<U+017F>ult of the middlemo<U+017F>t degree; deformity ari<U+017F>ing from either Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.</p>
                     <p>Now from all the<U+017F>e Signs it may be concluded, that tho<U+017F>e women who are cold and moi<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>econd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, are of the perfecte<U+017F>t temper, and in the be<U+017F>t ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as to their own proper nature, of bringing forth Children.</p>

It is a thing very well worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation, that, whereas the right <U+017F>ide of the reins, and the right te<U+017F>ticle, are naturally more hot and dry, and the left <U+017F>ide of the reins with the left te<U+017F>ticle, more hot and moi<U+017F>t, Nature <U+017F>eems to have intended that which at the beginning of the World is recorded in Hi<U+017F>tory to have been very frequent; as namely, that a woman brought forth two Children at a birth, the one Male, the other Female, the right <U+017F>ide which is hot and dry, being a<U+017F><U+017F>igned to the generation of Males<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> the left <U+017F>ide which is cold and moi<U+017F>t, to the generation of Females, and it <U+017F>eems to have been <U+017F>o ordained, to that end, that for every man there might be a wife: But after the Earth came to be well increa<U+017F>ed with people, it hapned as it appears, that this method and de<U+017F>ign of Nature was broken off, and now not only the double Child-bearing is very rare, but a far greater number of women are daily brought forth into the World than men: Whence it is to be gathered, that either Nature is grown weary, or el<U+017F>e interrupted in her cour<U+017F>e of working: However, <U+017F>ince this defect of Nature is to be remedied with care and diligence, if men would imploy their <U+017F>erious con<U+017F>iderations in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <U+017F>uch importance; there are <U+017F>ix things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59975:154"/>
by tho<U+017F>e that would obtain the accompli<U+017F>hment of their de<U+017F>ire, in the de<U+017F>ign whereof this Chapter treats. The fir<U+017F>t is, the eating tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>orts of meats which are hot and dry, provided they have not tho<U+017F>e qualities in too high an exce<U+017F>s, le<U+017F>t thereof be engenderd a man extreamly wily and malicious, and <U+017F>uch a one who<U+017F>e actions may prove pernicious to the Common-wealth; but rather let tho<U+017F>e viands be hot and dry in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate degree, <U+017F>uch as are Hens, Partridges, Turtles, Thru<U+017F>hes, Goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and tho<U+017F>e roa<U+017F>ted. The <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing is the feeding <U+017F>o moderately, that the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach may overcome and dige<U+017F>t that meat which is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; for tho<U+017F>e very <U+017F>orts of meat which are in their proper nature hot and dry, yet being eaten in <U+017F>o great a quantity, that the nature cannot dige<U+017F>t them, they become cold and moi<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o, the immoderate drinking Wine is ab<U+017F>olutely to be forbidden, there being no rawne<U+017F>s which <U+017F>o much endamageth generation, as that of Wine, being <U+017F>o vaporous and <U+017F>ubtle a Liquor. Whereupon a Law was anciently enacted in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Commonwealth, which prohibited the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried couple to ta<U+017F>te of Wine that day they were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the rights of the Marriage Bed. The third is, to u<U+017F>e much exerci<U+017F>e, which by fretting and con<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive moi<U+017F>ture of the Seed, heateth and dryeth the <U+017F>ame; whereas ea<U+017F>e, and overmuch delicacy breedeth coldne<U+017F>s and moi<U+017F>ture in the Seed. And hence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that rich and great per<U+017F>ons that live at ea<U+017F>e and feed high, have for the mo<U+017F>t part Daughters: And <hi>Hypocrates</hi> reporteth that the principal per<U+017F>ons of the ancient <hi>Scythians,</hi> who were very effeminate and womani<U+017F>h, mo<U+017F>t commonly either begot Females, or el<U+017F>e they proved either Eunuches, or Hermaphrodites: and being ignorant of the natural cau<U+017F>e of this defect, he <U+017F>aith (and derides them for it)

that they u<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>acrifice to their gods, imploring from them a remedy of that which was an effect of their mi<U+017F>-governance. The fourth diligence is, not to u<U+017F>e the act of Generation untill the Seed be well concocted and ripened, it being convenient for <U+017F>even or eight days before, to u<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e meats which we have already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed, and ob<U+017F>erving the <U+017F>ame cour<U+017F>e as Gardiners do with the Seeds which they would pre<U+017F>erve; for they attend till they ripen, and clean<U+017F>e, and wax dry, <U+017F>ince if they <U+017F>hould pluck them from the <U+017F>talk before they are deeply <U+017F>ea<U+017F>oned, and arrived to that point which is to be required, though they <U+017F>hould lye in the ground never <U+017F>o long, they would not grow at all. The fifth point, for a man to accompany with his Wife four or five days before her natural Cour<U+017F>es, in regard the Child immediately <U+017F>tandeth in need of much food to nouri<U+017F>h it. The <U+017F>ixth and la<U+017F>t point is to procure, that both the Seed of the Husband and Wife fall into the right <U+017F>ide of the Womb, by which means it hapneth that Males are ingendred; the rea<U+017F>on of which is, as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> affirmeth, that the right <U+017F>ide of the Womb holdeth affinity in temperature with the Liver, the right <U+017F>ide of the Reins, and the right Te<U+017F>ticle, which we have already delivered to be more hot, as the left <U+017F>ide is more cold, by which Females are ingendered: To the<U+017F>e things there is another con<U+017F>ideration to be added, which <hi>Galen</hi> hath al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erved, namely, that the Seed of each Te<U+017F>ticle, are of a different nature, for whereas that of the right Te<U+017F>ticle cometh out more hot, more <U+017F>peedily, and in a le<U+017F><U+017F>er quantity, that of the left co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out more cold, more <U+017F>lowly, and in greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</p>

                     <p>MAN is compounded of a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubject to alteration and corruption, that at the <U+017F>ame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant in which he begins to be formed, he al<U+017F>o begins to fade and decline; whereupon Nature hath provided, that in mans body there <U+017F>hould be four natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Attractive, Retentive, Concoctive, and Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive; the fir<U+017F>t, concocting and altering the aliments which we eat, return to repair the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance that was lo<U+017F>t, each <U+017F>ucceeding in his place; So that it little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth to have ingendered a Child of the perfecte<U+017F>t Seed, if we make no choice of the meats which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we feed upon: For the Creation being fini<U+017F>hed, there remaineth not for the creature any part of the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance whereof it was compo<U+017F>ed. True it is, that the fir<U+017F>t Seed, if it be well concocted, po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>eth <U+017F>uch vertue, that dige<U+017F>ting, and altering the meats, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them (though bad and gro<U+017F>s of them<U+017F>elves) to turn to its own good temperature and <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; but yet we may <U+017F>o far forth u<U+017F>e contrary meats, as the creature <U+017F>hall lo<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e good qualities which it receiveth from the <U+017F>eed whereof it was made; therefore <hi>Plato</hi> <U+017F>aid, that one of the things which mo<U+017F>t brought mans wit and his manners to ruine, was, his evil bringing up in diet: For which cau<U+017F>e, he coun<U+017F>elled that we <U+017F>hould give children delicate meats and drinks, and of good temperature, that, as they grow up, they may know to abandon evil, and embrace good; the rea<U+017F>on whereof is very clear: For, <U+017F>ince at the beginning the brain was made of delicate <U+017F>eed, and that this member is every day impairing and con<U+017F>uming, and is to be repaired with meats which we eat; it followeth certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59975:155"/>
that by u<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch meats as are gro<U+017F>s, and of evil temperature, the brains will become of the <U+017F>ame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Therefore it will not <U+017F>uffice that the Child is born of good <U+017F>eed; but al<U+017F>o that the meat which he eateth after he is born, be indued with the <U+017F>ame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                     <p>The ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> were very curious in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; <hi>Galen,</hi> and other Greek Phy<U+017F>icians, pre<U+017F>cribed to tho<U+017F>e parents who were de<U+017F>irous of begetting wi<U+017F>e children, to eat much Goats milk boyled, for about <U+017F>even or eight days before Copulation; this meat being of a moderate <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, the heat exceeding not the cold, nor the moi<U+017F>t the dry. The Greeks al<U+017F>o u<U+017F>ed to extract out of the milk, the Chee<U+017F>e and Whey, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er parts of the Milk, and left the butter; which being of a more <U+017F>pairy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, they gave their Children, mingling it with Honey. They al<U+017F>o gave them Cracknels of white bread, of very delicate water, with Honey, and a little Salt. But yet, in this way of regiment and ordering of the diet, there ari<U+017F>eth one great Inconvenience; namely, that children u<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch kind of delicate meats, will not enjoy <U+017F>trength <U+017F>ufficient to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the injuries of the Air, or other occa<U+017F>ions which u<U+017F>e to breed Maladies: And <U+017F>o by endeavouring that our Children may become wi<U+017F>e, we <U+017F>hall cau<U+017F>e them to become unhealthful, and <U+017F>hort-liv'd; Therefore it is to be con<U+017F>idered, how things may be <U+017F>o ordered, that the advancing of Childrens wit by their diet and education, may not prove incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with the pre<U+017F>ervation of their health and <U+017F>trength; which may be ea<U+017F>ily effected, if Parents will put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the<U+017F>e Rules and Precepts which I <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>cribe. <hi>Hypocrates</hi> takes notice of eight things which make the fle<U+017F>h plump and fat: The fir<U+017F>t is, to be merry, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy content and ea<U+017F>e of heart; the <U+017F>econd, to <U+017F>leep

much; the third, to lie in a <U+017F>oft bed; the fourth, to fare well; the fifth, to be well furni<U+017F>hed and apparelled; the <U+017F>ixth, to ride much on hor<U+017F>eback; the <U+017F>eventh, to have ones will, and not be cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed in any thing; the eighth, to be much conver<U+017F>ant in all kind of Plays and pa<U+017F>times, that yield contentment and delight. That this manner of life produceth the afore<U+017F>aid effect, is mo<U+017F>t true; but is likewi<U+017F>e true, that it cau<U+017F>eth the <U+017F>eed to be moi<U+017F>t, and that the children engendred of that Seed, mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o abound with <U+017F>uperfluous moi<U+017F>ture, which both for the production of Wit, and the pre<U+017F>ervation of health, ought to be dried up; for as much as this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <U+017F>tifleth the operations of the rational <U+017F>oul, and al<U+017F>o occa<U+017F>ioneth <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>hort life: So that it appears, that a good wit, and a <U+017F>ound body, ari<U+017F>e from one and the <U+017F>ame quality, namely, dryne<U+017F>s; whence it is to be ob<U+017F>erved, that the <U+017F>ame rules which we are to lay down for the making Children wi<U+017F>e, will al<U+017F>o be effectual for the making of them healthy and long lived.</p>
                     <p>Fir<U+017F>t, it behoveth for tho<U+017F>e Children that are born of delicious Parents, who<U+017F>e con<U+017F>titution mu<U+017F>t therefore nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of more cold and moi<U+017F>t than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, to be wa<U+017F>hed as <U+017F>oon as they are born with hot <U+017F>alt water, which, according to the opinion of all Phy<U+017F>itians, <U+017F>oaketh and drieth up the fle<U+017F>h, <U+017F>trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Nerves, and by con<U+017F>uming the <U+017F>uperfluous moi<U+017F>ture of the brain, increa<U+017F>eth the wit, and freeth him from many dangerous Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; whereas a Bath of hot water that is fre<U+017F>h, breeds (as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> affirmeth) five inconveniences; namely, the effeminating of the fle<U+017F>h, weakne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>inews, dulne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>pirits, fluxes of the blood, and a nau<U+017F>eating in the <U+017F>tomach: But tho<U+017F>e that are born with exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive dryne<U+017F>s, are to be bathed in hot fre<U+017F>h water, that the extremity of their temper may be corrected by a contrary quality. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59975:156"/>
why hot <U+017F>alt water is available for tho<U+017F>e that are over moi<U+017F>t, is, becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>toppeth the pores of the skin, and of two extreams, it is more conducing to health to have a skin hard and <U+017F>omewhat clo<U+017F>e, than thin and open.</p>
                     <p>The <U+017F>econd thing requi<U+017F>ite to be performed when the Child is new born, is to make him acquainted with the winds, and with change of air, and not to keep him lockt up in a Chamber, which much enfeebleth the <U+017F>trength, and wa<U+017F>teth the <U+017F>pirits; nothing being <U+017F>o ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to a healthful kind of living, as to expo<U+017F>e ones <U+017F>elf to all kind of winds and weathers, hot, moi<U+017F>t, cold and dry; it is no wonder therefore that Shepherds of all men living enjoy the <U+017F>ounde<U+017F>t health, <U+017F>ince they accu<U+017F>tom them<U+017F>elves to all the <U+017F>everal qualities of the Air, and their nature is di<U+017F>mayed at nothing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary we find that tho<U+017F>e men that give them<U+017F>elves to live deliciou<U+017F>ly, and to beware le<U+017F>t the Sun, the Wind, the Evening, or the Cold, offend them, are within a <U+017F>mall time di<U+017F>patched with a Po<U+017F>t-Letter to another World. So far were the ancient <hi>Germans</hi> from nicety in this point, that they u<U+017F>e to dip their Children as <U+017F>oon as born, in a cold River.</p>
                     <p>The third thing nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to be performed, is to <U+017F>eek out a young Nur<U+017F>e of temperature hot and dry, with which two qualities the much cold and moi<U+017F>t will be corrected, which the Infant brought from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb; <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be innur'd to hardne<U+017F>s and want, to lye on the bare ground, to eat little, and to go poorly clad in wet, drought, and heat, <U+017F>uch a one will yield a firm milk, as being acquainted with the alterations of the air, and the Child being brought up by her, will come to enjoy a great firmne<U+017F>s of body. The cour<U+017F>e then which is to be ob<U+017F>erved with the Nur<U+017F>e, is to take her into the Hou<U+017F>e about four or five Months before the Childs birth, and to give her the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>orts
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59975:157"/>
of meat to feed on, which the Mother u<U+017F>eth to eat, that <U+017F>he may have time to con<U+017F>ume the blood and bad humors, which <U+017F>he hath gathered by the harmful meats <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed before, and al<U+017F>o to the end that the Child may <U+017F>uck the like milk with that which relieved it in the Mothers belly, or at lea<U+017F>t made of the <U+017F>ame meats.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing requi<U+017F>ite to be ob<U+017F>erved, is not to accu<U+017F>tom the Child to <U+017F>leep in a <U+017F>oft bed, or to keep it over-warm in apparel, or give it too much meat, which are things that fatten and enlarge the Fle<U+017F>h; whereas the re<U+017F>traint of them dimini<U+017F>heth and dries it up, which drine<U+017F>s increa<U+017F>eth wit, and much availeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward long life, According to this Rule which I have pre<U+017F>cribed, was He, who of all men living that ever the World had, was the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t brought up; for as <U+017F>oon as he was born, he began to be inur'd to cold and other alterations of the air; his fir<U+017F>t bed was the Earth, his apparel coar<U+017F>e; and a few days after, they went with him to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> a place very hot, and the meat they gave him, was that which I have already mentioned to have been u<U+017F>ed by the ancient <hi>Greeks.</hi> Whereupon it is that the Prophet <hi>E<U+017F>ay</hi> <U+017F>aith, <hi>He <U+017F>hall eat butter and honey, that he may know to e<U+017F>chew evil, and chu<U+017F>e the good:</hi> For though he was very God, yet being al<U+017F>o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man, he omitted not to make u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural remedies as were u<U+017F>ed by the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>ons of men.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have <U+017F>hown what the qualities are, which the Brain ought to have, and what the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proved according to the opinion of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> that drine<U+017F>s maketh the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t <U+017F>oul; and that by age from the day of our birth, 'till that of our death, we <U+017F>till acquire more and more dryne<U+017F>s, and by con<U+017F>equence more knowledge.

                     <p>COncerning the Gradual Formation of the Infant in the Womb; of the growing up of the <hi>Fibrae</hi> within the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>even days; of the Umbilical Veins and Arteries, of the Formation of the Liver, the Heart, the Brain, the Nerves, the Gri<U+017F>tles, &amp;c. a particular Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e hath been already made in this Book: It remains only that we touch upon <U+017F>ome things, in reference to the <U+017F>ame matter.</p>
                     <p>As the u<U+017F>e of the two Membranules that enwrap the Birth (whereof the fir<U+017F>t is called <hi>Ambiens, Avicius, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, Aurela, Abcas, Abigas, Sela, Aligas,</hi> or the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature</hi> of the Conception; the latter <hi>Alanthoides, Bilis, A<U+017F>cari, Secca, Involucrum</hi>) which hath been formerly delivered, is a thing of great con<U+017F>equence, to be known and well con<U+017F>idered; <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e is the con<U+017F>ideration of the Umbilical Veins and Arteries a matter no le<U+017F>s im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. The<U+017F>e Veins meeting together a little beneath the Navel, and extended along that concavity where the Liver is to be formed, <U+017F>erve for the purging of the men<U+017F>truous blood, which is to be de<U+017F>tributed through the members. The two Arteries are connected with ductile ligatures unto the great Artery: Through tho<U+017F>e the heart of the Embryo receives ventilation, and draws <U+017F>pirit, and the purer part of the blood from the Womb.</p>
                     <p>Then after the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even days, the lineaments of all the members are de<U+017F>cribed. Next, the Lineation being perfected within the <U+017F>pace of between four and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59975:158"/>
eight days after, a certain <U+017F>anguinous matter drawn through the Navel, pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth all along through the whole Birth, and being pre-di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed toward the formation of the members, fills up at that time the lineatures. The following days from the ninth to the fifteenth, this <U+017F>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous juice is converted into Fle<U+017F>h. At which time al<U+017F>o the Members receive their colour, and that degree of hardne<U+017F>s or <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, which is peculiar to them; like as a Painter when he hath drawn the outward lines of any Picture, in the next place, he fills it up with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours, according as the nature of each <U+017F>everal part requires.</p>
                     <p>Thus Nature proceeds to perfect the Formation of the Heart, Liver, Brain, and other principle Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: All which things are di<U+017F>tinctly brought to pa<U+017F>s from the Conception to the eighteenth day of the fir<U+017F>t Month, at which time it is called Seed, but afterward it begins both to be called, and to be a Feature. But for the better retaining of the<U+017F>e things in memory, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor did not ami<U+017F>s who thought fit to comprehend them in the<U+017F>e following Ver<U+017F>es.

                     <head>CHAP. X. Whether there may be a mutation out of one Sex into another; and of Hermaphrodites.</head>
                     <p>BEfore any thing can be po<U+017F>itively determined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this argument (<U+017F>o much of uncertainty there is in it;) it will be convenient to recite what hath been delivered both as to the negative and the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, by Authors that have maintained each contrary opinion, <hi>Severinus Pinaeus,</hi> who holds the Negative, writes to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That the genital parts of both Sexes, are <U+017F>o unlike each other in <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance much more in compo<U+017F>ition, <U+017F>ituation figure, action, and u<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>carce any thing can be found more unlike, and by how much the more all other parts of the body (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Brea<U+017F>ts, which in women are more tumid, becau<U+017F>e of their <U+017F>econdary u<U+017F>e) have an exact re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; <U+017F>o much the more unlike are the genital parts of the one Sex, compared with tho<U+017F>e of the other; and if their figure be thus different, much more is their u<U+017F>e. True it is, indeed, that both are appointed for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but in a different manner; for women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the matter, but men the form: The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real appetite al<U+017F>o proceeds from different cau<U+017F>es; for in men it proceeds from a de<U+017F>ire of emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from a de<U+017F>ire of repletion. In women al<U+017F>o the chiefe<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e parts are concave, and apt to receive; but in men they are only porous, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <U+017F>olid.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e things con<U+017F>idered, I cannot but wonder, <U+017F>aith he, how any one can imagine, that the Genital Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Female Birth <U+017F>hould be changed into tho<U+017F>e that belong to Males; <U+017F>ince by tho<U+017F>e parts only the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59975:160"/>
and di<U+017F>tinction of Sexes is made: Nor can I well impute the cau<U+017F>e of this vulgar error to any thing, but a mi<U+017F>take of <U+017F>ome not over-expert Midwives, who have been deceived by the evil conformation of the parts, which may have happened in <U+017F>ome Male-births, to have had <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a protru<U+017F>ion, as not to have been di<U+017F>cerned; as appeared by the example of a Child Chri<U+017F>tned at <hi>Paris,</hi> by the name of <hi>Joan,</hi> as if it had been a Girl, when as it proved afterwards a Boy: And on the contrary, the over-far exten<U+017F>ion of the Clitoris in female Births, may have occa<U+017F>ioned the like mi<U+017F>take. But notwith<U+017F>tanding what hath been thus <U+017F>aid in the Negative, there have not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>ome learned Phy<U+017F>itians, who have firmly a<U+017F><U+017F>erted the affirmative part; of which number <hi>Galen</hi> him<U+017F>elf is one. A man, <U+017F>aith he, is different from a woman in nothing el<U+017F>e except in the having his genital mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers without his body: And this is certain, that if Nature having formed a man, would convert him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Woman, <U+017F>he hath no other task to perform, but only to turn his genital members inward; and if a woman into a man, to do the contrary. And this, however held for a Fable, hath chanced many times in nature, as well while the Creature hath been in the Mothers Womb, as after the <U+017F>ame hath been born: For divers times Nature hath made a Female Child, and <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>o remained in her Mothers belly for the <U+017F>pace of one or two Months, and afterwards plenty of heat growing in the genital Members, upon <U+017F>ome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion they have i<U+017F><U+017F>ued forth, and the Child hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Male; but yet retaining <U+017F>ome certain ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tures unbefitting the Ma<U+017F>culine Sex; as a <U+017F>hrill voice, womani<U+017F>h actions, and the like. Contrariwi<U+017F>e, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath often made a Male, and cold growing on, and turning the genitals inward, it hath become a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59975:160"/>
Female; yet <U+017F>till retaining a manlike fa<U+017F>hion, both in voice and ge<U+017F>ture.</p>
                     <p>Now to give an impartial judgment of the<U+017F>e two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, I cannot but hold that the latter of them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a greater <U+017F>emblance of truth with it; for as to what <hi>Pinaeus</hi> affirms of the great difference of figure in the genital members of each, it will not be of <U+017F>o much force; if we con<U+017F>ider that the inver<U+017F>ion of them is that which chiefly occa<U+017F>ioneth this difference of form; the rea<U+017F>on of which is evidently deduced from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natures of heat and cold; heat enlarging and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending all things, and cold retaining and clo<U+017F>ing them up.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of Hermaphrodites, or tho<U+017F>e that enjoy both Sexes in one per<U+017F>on, many there are that will not afford any belief, or, at the lea<U+017F>t, doubt whether or no there are any <U+017F>uch things in nature; but although there cannot be <U+017F>o apparent a rea<U+017F>on gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for this as for the mutation of Sexes; yet in this we may <U+017F>uffer our <U+017F>elves to be guided by the <U+017F>ame <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium,</hi> as in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of Specters and Apparitions of Spirits; concerning which, although it hath puzled many learned men to find out, what <U+017F>hould be the true cau<U+017F>es and rea<U+017F>ons, that <U+017F>uch things come to pa<U+017F>s; yet it argues much indi<U+017F>cretion not to give credit to them, both in regard Hi<U+017F>tories have abounded with frequent examples of them in all ages; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o, con<U+017F>idering the daily reports we have of <U+017F>uch things, both from the mouths and pens of <U+017F>erious and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it may be judged by <U+017F>ome, to have been more decent that the<U+017F>e things <U+017F>hould have been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Latin, than in the vulgar Tongue, that <U+017F>o the <U+017F>ecrets of Nature might not have been pro<U+017F>tituted to every unworthy Reader, that makes u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>uch things,

                     <p>At the time of Child-bearing, it is good to take the above-<U+017F>aid Cly<U+017F>ter, if it may be done po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, for that, after the Woman is delivered, <U+017F>he is to be four or five days without a <U+017F>tool, as well becau<U+017F>e of the great evacuations which <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>o lately had, as al<U+017F>o that being to be kept continually hot in her bed, the excrements do thereupon harden, and afterwards putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,

and then generate putrid vapours, and many times a feaver.</p>
                     <p>There happens al<U+017F>o another inconvenience from the <U+017F>aid excrements, being kept in the body, and not emptied before delivery; and that is this, that when the Patient endeavours to deliver her <U+017F>elf of the Infant, the excrements do al<U+017F>o forthwith come out, which many ways give annoyance, as well to the Child, the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, as to the other A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tants, by rea<U+017F>on of the change of linnen, and the trouble<U+017F>ome <U+017F>mells.</p>

In the mean time, that is to <U+017F>ay, when the woman is in pain, and that all the <U+017F>igns of Child-bearing do appear, then let her take about two ounces of Cinamon-water, this will fortifie her <U+017F>pirits, and ha<U+017F>ten the coming forth of the Infant.</p>
                     <p>If the water alone do not <U+017F>uffice, you may give it her the <U+017F>econd time, adding thereunto the weight of a half crown of counterfeit Borax made of Roach-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, <U+017F>uch as the Gold<U+017F>miths u<U+017F>e; it is neither offen<U+017F>ive to the ta<U+017F>te, nor any way dangerous, as <U+017F>ome Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians think, mi<U+017F>taking it for <hi>Chry<U+017F>ocoll</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi>; for it is a <U+017F>overaign medicament both to cau<U+017F>e the Child to come forth, and to expell the Secondines, if they come not forth in their due time.</p>

                  <p>IN the Year 1630. a young Lady whom I was wont to bring to bed, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by my hou<U+017F>e, came in to me, and told me, that <U+017F>he was four Months gone, and that <U+017F>he perceived the Infant to <U+017F>tir; about a Month after, <U+017F>he came to <U+017F>ee me, and told me that <U+017F>he was in much pain, for that <U+017F>he had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Infant to <U+017F>tir in two days, and that therefore <U+017F>he believed that it was dead, by rea<U+017F>on of a certain very great Fright which <U+017F>he had had; for at the time that <U+017F>he was frighted, <U+017F>he perceived the Child to move, but after that never; and her belly began by little and little to wax le<U+017F>s; and about three weeks after <U+017F>he had that reflux of milk that Women u<U+017F>e to have that lie in; when this was gone, <U+017F>he had no grievance; yet <U+017F>eeing her often, and knowing her to be big with Child, <U+017F>he asked me my advice, to know what <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould do. Whereupon I asked her, if any ill vapours ro<U+017F>e up into
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59975:180"/>
her mouth? <U+017F>he told me no. If <U+017F>he had not lo<U+017F>t her appetite? <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, that <U+017F>he never had a better in her life; her heart was light, her body in good temper, <U+017F>o that there was nothing that troubled her but an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he had, that the Child was dead: whereupon I made her try all means to make the Infant <U+017F>tir; but <U+017F>he notwith<U+017F>tanding felt nothing, only <U+017F>he perceived that <U+017F>omething did heave a little upon the operation of the Remedies, which was nothing but the Matrix, which being now di<U+017F>tempered and grown cold, did as it were an<U+017F>wer the hot Remedies, te<U+017F>tifying thereby <U+017F>ome good which it received thereby. I advi<U+017F>ed her to be patient, and to wait Nature's lei<U+017F>ure, which is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough of it <U+017F>elf; telling her that I had <U+017F>een an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant which had lain a long time in the womb without budging, which for all that was not dead, although you could not perceive in the woman any thing, but the <U+017F>igns of a dead Child. I had oftentimes brought the Lady to bed, and <U+017F>he <U+017F>till had very good Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and very <U+017F>ound Children, of a good colour, <U+017F>o that I believing her to be of a <U+017F>ound con<U+017F>titution, thought that if the Infant were dead, Nature, which was very <U+017F>trong in her, would expel it in time convenient, and that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not be forced, not having given any te<U+017F>timony of defect; re<U+017F>olving al<U+017F>o, when her Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was out, if then Nature <U+017F>hewed it <U+017F>elf weak, that we would con<U+017F>ult her Friends and Phy<U+017F>icians. Many of her Friends told me, that they doubted that <U+017F>he was deceived in thinking her <U+017F>elf to be with Child; to which I an<U+017F>wered, that they might be confident that it was <U+017F>o. In brief, <U+017F>he was brought to bed, <U+017F>ixteen weeks after the fright which <U+017F>he had. Now here ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth a great doubt, whether the Child died at the hour of her being <U+017F>cared, by rea<U+017F>on that it did not move in all that time? A rea<U+017F>on that the Child was not dead,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59975:180"/>
may be, becau<U+017F>e that the Gentlewoman had not her milk till within three weeks after; and yet I cannot but think that it died at the <U+017F>ame time; for certainly, by that fright the vital <U+017F>pirits were ravi<U+017F>hed from it, and the blood of the Arteries retired to the heart of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not being di<U+017F>tributed to the Infant, but at the good plea<U+017F>ure of Nature; the cour<U+017F>e of which being <U+017F>topped, it retired to its fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ource, through which the Child <U+017F>uffering a <U+017F>uffocation, gave a violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and now, after the fright, was come to her <U+017F>elf, and that Nature would have returned to fini<U+017F>h her work, <U+017F>he was not deceived, becau<U+017F>e the vital fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Infant were extinct; and, notwith<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, the Mother not cea<U+017F>ing to re<U+017F>train the men<U+017F>trual blood as <U+017F>he was accu<U+017F>tomed; that finding it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>topped, and <U+017F>till increa<U+017F>ing without that u<U+017F>e made of it that was wont, it made a reflux to the Brea<U+017F>ts, which flowed down again in five or <U+017F>ix days; for the Infant coming to decrea<U+017F>e in the womb, now way was made for them, which came not down for all that, but in the Delivery and after; which was in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: At the end of the <U+017F>ixteenth week after the fright, <U+017F>he had pains in the night, <U+017F>he thinking to endure them well enough 'till morning, in the morning cau<U+017F>ed me to be <U+017F>ent for. I came to her, finding with her a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ician, and <U+017F>undry others of her acquaintance. The Phy<U+017F>ician that expected me, had ordered a Cly<U+017F>ter to give it her if I thought it to the purpo<U+017F>e; I found her pale, cold, and yet in a <U+017F>weat, with <U+017F>o little pul<U+017F>e, that I e<U+017F>teemed her dead; I touched her, and found <U+017F>he had been in Travail, which had been too long neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I called pre<U+017F>ently for a plain <U+017F>ilver di<U+017F>h, into which I <U+017F>queez'd the juice of half a Citron, and <U+017F>et it upon a Chafing di<U+017F>h of coals; being warmed, I cau<U+017F>ed her to take it; this re<U+017F>tored Nature a little, and <U+017F>tirred up her
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59975:181"/>
pains, and then I a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted her; notwith<U+017F>tanding <U+017F>ome of the waters ran down: After her fir<U+017F>t throw, the legs and thighs of the Child came forth: Now finding the Infant to be dead, and <U+017F>eeing that <U+017F>he was troubled with no more throws, I was afraid of drawing it forth, for fear it might be rotten: I did give her a Cly<U+017F>ter without moving her, the force of which bringing the Child away, <U+017F>he was delivered of a dead Infant, all over of a leaden colour, without any ill vapour; the Secondine <U+017F>ound and fair as you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, her purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as clear as could be, and <U+017F>he had as good and as happy a Lying in, as any woman in the World; all which time <U+017F>he had not the appearance of any Milk at all. Hence we may admire the effects of Nature, which are wonderful! But in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es Women mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ure in due time and place; for if a Woman do re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t her pains, and doth not put her <U+017F>elf in a right po<U+017F>ture, <U+017F>he runs a great hazard of her Life.</p>

Upon which, I gave my advice, and though I thought my <U+017F>elf come a little too late, yet I re<U+017F>olved to do what lay in the power of my Art; and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved to give her a good <U+017F>trong Cly<U+017F>ter to awaken Nature, and to bring the Infant lower, which did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our hopes; afterwards to drink a <U+017F>mall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Rhubarb-water which <U+017F>tayed with her; a little after, I gave her the Yolk of an Egg, which <U+017F>tayed with her al<U+017F>o, cau<U+017F>ing her to drink nothing but Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb-water; and at every hour's end, I gave her the Yolk of an Egg, which did al<U+017F>o <U+017F>tay with her; by this time, Nature began to <U+017F>trengthen it <U+017F>elf, and the pains of the Infant came again; and in le<U+017F>s than two hours, after the Cly<U+017F>ter and other nouri<U+017F>hment given, when I <U+017F>aw her pretty well, and that Nature <U+017F>trove to expel the Infant, I gave her half a dram of Confection of <hi>Alkermes</hi> in a little Wine; and a little while after I cau<U+017F>ed her to take another Cly<U+017F>ter, into which I put a little <hi>Hiera,</hi> and a little <hi>Benedictum,</hi> which fini<U+017F>hed the work; for <U+017F>he was then delivered of a very lu<U+017F>ty Child, which lived about two days: I came thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout noon, and <U+017F>he was brought to bed before nine at night.

then <U+017F>ome lo<U+017F>s of blood and pain, I was <U+017F>ent for, and judged it to have been <U+017F>ome imperfect Conception, and therefore I u<U+017F>ed all means to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t her; yet could <U+017F>he not expel it, for all the<U+017F>e long pains: Whereupon finding <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trange apprehen<U+017F>ions in her, I wondered; for, in all the time of my Practice, I never knew <U+017F>uch a thing as that dangerous in my life. But I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found this apprehen<U+017F>ion to come from a certain accident that had happened to a Si<U+017F>ter of hers, who being with Child, carried it very well to the end of the ninth month; at the end of which <U+017F>he began to be in pain, as if <U+017F>he would have cried out: the pains were great and long, which they were not at all a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at, by rea<U+017F>on that it was her fir<U+017F>t Child, yet were not the<U+017F>e pains accompanied with any <U+017F>igns of Labour, as, the opening the exterior orifice of the Womb: And they continued thus for the <U+017F>pace of two days and two nights. Many medicines were u<U+017F>ed to facilitate the birth, but to no purpo<U+017F>e; and now <U+017F>he felt not the Child <U+017F>tir any more. And now it was concluded, that <U+017F>he had mi<U+017F>taken her time; and now being at re<U+017F>t for four or five days, and growing weary of the City, <U+017F>he went into the Country, and being returned without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice that <U+017F>he had received any harm, <U+017F>he was taken with the <U+017F>ame pains as before, which continued a day and a night, and then cea<U+017F>ed as before. This was adjudged to be certain pains of the Colick; after this, <U+017F>he endured one month longer in her former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tate, which was now the eleventh month compleat; at the end of which <U+017F>he felt <U+017F>ome little pain like throws, which pre<U+017F>ently affected her heart; upon which <U+017F>he was laid upon her bed, and they brought her Wine; but at the very in<U+017F>tant <U+017F>he died, without having any time to call for a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance: Seeing her dead, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon the right <U+017F>ide of her belly a very black

                     <p>IT is a common error among Midwives, which is not to be pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by, that a Woman with Child, when <U+017F>he hath gone <U+017F>even Months of her time, is to walk much: Upon a conceit that exerci<U+017F>e is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for her; for that, they <U+017F>ay, doth loo<U+017F>en the Child from the reins, and facilitates the Birth. I confe<U+017F>s, as to facilitating of the Birth, it may <U+017F>omething avail; only I mu<U+017F>t add this al<U+017F>o, that it is better to draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Child than to break it; and moreover it is better to be <U+017F>omething longer in Travail, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr two or three evils which ordinarily happen; the fir<U+017F>t is, that the Child in the end of the <U+017F>eventh month, doth make certain endeavours to free it <U+017F>elf from the belly of the Mother; and without doubt his fir<U+017F>t en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is to turn him<U+017F>elf in the belly of the Mother; for the Infant turns him<U+017F>elf a good while before the time of Labour; and therefore, I <U+017F>ay, Exerci<U+017F>e is very dangerous: The fir<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F>e by pu<U+017F>hing downward the belly is dilated, and e<U+017F>pecially in <U+017F>uch as carry their Children low; and be<U+017F>ides, oft times the head drags down all the body of the Womb, and

This, they <U+017F>ay, is the fault of the Nur<U+017F>e, who did not apply remedies fit to re<U+017F>tore the fault. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s that remedies do much avail to the recovery of the afore<U+017F>aid malady, and do much avail to the healing of that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; but, to re<U+017F>tore it to <U+017F>uch an e<U+017F>tate as it was in before, I <U+017F>ay it is a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for medicines to perform: For the skin which is once <U+017F>eparated, cannot be clo<U+017F>ed again without a <U+017F>car. I would now not only blame tho<U+017F>e that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them, but, by putting the actions of people before them, <U+017F>hew them where lies the fault, and what rea<U+017F>on I have <U+017F>o to do: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s that fal<U+017F>e accu<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have made the mo<U+017F>t able Midwives timorous; for they lye liable to <U+017F>o many cau<U+017F>es of detraction, that all that are either but indifferent good, or el<U+017F>e not good, are all accu<U+017F>ed alike, if any thing fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>s with the Patient, as if they were the ab<U+017F>olute cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es of the evil, or that it lay ab<U+017F>olutely in their power to hinder it. It happens al<U+017F>o many times, that a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife worthy of that name, doth deliver a woman from death, and yet in the place of much prai<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he incurs

The fault is no where but in the ignorance, <U+017F>candal, and ingratitude of Women toward tho<U+017F>e of this Calling.

Cries one, I like not the<U+017F>e Midwives that handle me; I will change mine, cries another, for that trick al<U+017F>o; <U+017F>o that many out of a kind of fear have a greater de<U+017F>ire and will to be complacent than to do well; and <U+017F>o <U+017F>itting with their hands before them, entertain their Patients with di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e; who for all that feeling their pains, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained to thru<U+017F>t forward, upon which the head of the Infant coming fir<U+017F>t, for the mo<U+017F>t part the womb <U+017F>erves for a <hi>Head-band,</hi> which comes forth before it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, might the Midwife be permitted to touch the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, they might put back the Womb, and prevent many accidents that happen in Lyings-in, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <U+017F>ometimes to be a total relaxation of the <hi>Matrix</hi>; of which when the Women complain to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent and flattering Midwives, they reply; why, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, you know I did not touch you; and be<U+017F>ides, I am not in fault if you have been touched: This is the fruit of their reproaches. You will <U+017F>ay, there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Countrey-women that the Midwife never touch at all, and they do not know <U+017F>carcely, whether a Woman lye in, or no, unle<U+017F>s they <U+017F>ee the Infant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.

                     <p>I Was one day called to the Labour of a woman, which had good Deliveries of her Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, at their due time, although her Deliveries of Boys were always more difficult than tho<U+017F>e of her Daughters; being come to her, I found her walking in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with her leggs bare, in a <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on that was not over-hot. I cau<U+017F>ed her to be put into her bed to warm her again, but <U+017F>he would by no means endure it; although I prayed her, <U+017F>he was angry with me, and told me, This was not the rule, to be con<U+017F>trained. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s and the Nur<U+017F>e combined again<U+017F>t me; the night approached; the waters being come down, I feared the ill <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, that her di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e would be irrecoverable by rea<U+017F>on of her <U+017F>elf-will'dne<U+017F>s. I de<U+017F>ired her husband to u<U+017F>e his endeavour, but he could do no more with her than I: about midnight, I prayed her to go to bed again, and to warm her <U+017F>elf, and unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he would do <U+017F>o, I could do nothing. She told me, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood nothing in re<U+017F>pect of a certain Surgeon, who, when <U+017F>he had <U+017F>uch a kind of Labour before, only toucht her with his finger, and delivered her; and that <U+017F>he

would have him. I was content, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent for him. He came very confidently, but his work was not at <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie a pa<U+017F>s as formerly: he put a good large Table-Napkin before him, tru<U+017F><U+017F>ing it up to his elbows, <U+017F>aying he was as able to deliver her as before. She would no more <U+017F>ee me after his arrival: the Surgeon to whom I repre<U+017F>ented (after his arrival) all that I had under<U+017F>tood and <U+017F>een, and the fear which I had of her, told me that all would be well. At day break, a neighbour of mine calling me away, I de<U+017F>ired her Husband to let me go; but he was unwilling, unle<U+017F>s I would promi<U+017F>e to come again, which I did; and as <U+017F>oon as the door was open, one of the <U+017F>ervants told me, another Midwife was <U+017F>ent for. Her Husband de<U+017F>ired me again, that <U+017F>ince the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon failed of his skill, I would u<U+017F>e my skill; but it was too late, for the Chyrurgeon left them, and the Woman died. See here how ill a thing it is to be opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated, for I could ea<U+017F>ily have delivered her, if <U+017F>he would have been ruled by me.</p>

                     <p>THere be two <U+017F>ort of Nur<U+017F>es which I have found: The one is of <U+017F>uch Women as are of an ill humor, or juice; which humors <U+017F>ettle all in the milk, for that is the place where the<U+017F>e fluxes di<U+017F>charge them<U+017F>elves. The<U+017F>e Women are in a better condition being Nur<U+017F>es, than when they are not Nur<U+017F>es; and being not Nur<U+017F>es are <U+017F>ubject to pains, <U+017F>ometimes in the arms, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the <U+017F>houlders, <U+017F>ometimes in one of their legs or thighs; or el<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>ubject to the watring of the eyes, or <U+017F>welling in the corner of the eye or no<U+017F>e. The<U+017F>e are good Nur<U+017F>es, as long as Children are fat; but the fat is <U+017F>oft, and the Infants dull and <U+017F>otti<U+017F>h, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no great <U+017F>igns of vivacity; coming to bear teeth, they are very <U+017F>ickly, and do ordinarily die, by rea<U+017F>on of the flux, that pu<U+017F>heth out too great company of teeth at once. The Children that e<U+017F>cape this, are more ill juic'd in their infancy, than are their Fathers and Mothers in their old Age. If the flux that afflicts them be <U+017F>alt, the milk is of a blacki<U+017F>h and blewi<U+017F>h co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, if it be of Choler, it is more dangerous than the other, for that is more dangerous and venomous to the Children. There is another <U+017F>ort of Nur<U+017F>es more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than the<U+017F>e I have now <U+017F>poken of; who pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after they have Lain in (that is, three, or four, or five, or <U+017F>ix months) are taken with their Purgations, a thing which never happens to good Nur<U+017F>es: for this is the cour<U+017F>e of Nature, that all the blood which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is dedicated to the nouri<U+017F>hment of the Infant. This is cau<U+017F>ed by a moderate heat which is in their blood; and, to <U+017F>ay true, as <U+017F>oon as ever this happens, the Infant mu<U+017F>t be taken away, for they are more apt to conceive, than to nur<U+017F>e; and if they continue Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59975:187"/>
they do but ruine the Children. This is but too much experimented, and I <U+017F>peak this to <U+017F>ave the lives of a great many Children, when <U+017F>eeing them <U+017F>uck I have di<U+017F>covered their want of milk; <U+017F>o that I may <U+017F>ay, there dies a third part of the Children, for want of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care in this particular, which yet <U+017F>eem fat, and in good ca<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>This is the cau<U+017F>e of great Cholicks and windine<U+017F><U+017F>es in Children, which kills them in a moment; for the lea<U+017F>t Feaver that takes them, carries them away. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides this, there are <U+017F>ome who<U+017F>e milk is <U+017F>o little, but withal <U+017F>o thick, that it <U+017F>ticks upon the tongue, palate, and throat, which cau<U+017F>es, as it were, a white canker, which is more and more heated by rea<U+017F>on of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible drawing in vain; and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>eth all the throat, whereby they are hindred from <U+017F>ucking. The<U+017F>e Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es will milk after this, a drop or two out of their brea<U+017F>ts, crying, Look ye, the Child cares not for <U+017F>uck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I never knew more abu<U+017F>e in any thing, than in Nur<U+017F>es: for let them make what excu<U+017F>e they will, it is nothing but nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that reduceth them to be <U+017F>uch. Although the greate<U+017F>t part do <U+017F>ay, that it is to get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; yet when they have a Child, whether they have milk or no, yet they de<U+017F>ire not to part with it, no more than they do to drown them<U+017F>elves; whereby the Parents are often deceived. And therefore the Mothers ought to have a great care, and to make it their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>urprize the Nur<U+017F>es at their own hou<U+017F>es, that if there be any mi<U+017F>carriage, they may find it out. And indeed it is very rea<U+017F>onable, that the cau<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e poor creatures that cannot complain, <U+017F>hould not be neglected; and the<U+017F>e She-murderers be made known, that they may not go unpuni<U+017F>hed.</p>

You mu<U+017F>t comfort her, if <U+017F>he be afflicted, and put her in the right way, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her never to commit the like again; but to receive <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons into your hou<U+017F>e, is but a means to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage evil: As the receivers of <U+017F>tollen goods are a means to encourage Thieves; even <U+017F>o, the Midwives that bring <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tench to their hou<U+017F>e, do a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t and abet the evil which they do, whil<U+017F>t they know where to di<U+017F>charge them<U+017F>elves of the like burthen again. At the fir<U+017F>t when I took upon me this Calling, I took two into my hou<U+017F>e, the one of Quality, the other of an ordinary condition; I <U+017F>aw them <U+017F>ometimes in <U+017F>uch fits of de<U+017F>pair, that I could hardly bring them out of them again. Tho<U+017F>e from whom the evil came; upon who<U+017F>e account I had received them, came now and then to <U+017F>ee them, becau<U+017F>e they brought them mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; I was continually fain to keep watch with them, for fear they <U+017F>hould do any evil in the hou<U+017F>e: And I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay, I had better have kept a herd of Swine. Such unre<U+017F>ts as the<U+017F>e ought not to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brea<U+017F>t of a Midwife; for, her mind ought to be free and at peace. Be<U+017F>ides that, a cu<U+017F>tom of laying Women of an ill life, <U+017F>poyls the reputation of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and oft times endangers the health al<U+017F>o. To confirm which, I knew an hone<U+017F>t under<U+017F>tanding Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, that laid a Courtezan that <U+017F>eemed to ail nothing at all; but <U+017F>he, having an inveterated Pox, gave it to the old Midwife upon her right hand, upon which there came a red <hi>Bubo</hi>; for all which, being unwilling to leave off her Calling, <U+017F>he <U+017F>poyled after that above thirty Hou<U+017F>holds; for the Husbands got the Pox from their Wives, and the Children from their Mothers</p>
                     <p>Now let me tell thee, Daughter, that thou oughte<U+017F>t not to take it ill to <U+017F>ee the condition of Midwives de<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed; neither let this hinder thy Studies in the perfections of this Art, which are not to be comprehended by tho<U+017F>e
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59975:190"/>
that de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e it. Neither be di<U+017F>mayed if thou <U+017F>ee<U+017F>t peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this condition, that do not de<U+017F>erve to be; for this doth not at all dimini<U+017F>h the honour of tho<U+017F>e that are good: for it comes from hence to pa<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e they that receive them for mony, do as Stablers do, put the good and bad Hor<U+017F>es together; the good Hor<U+017F>es are in no danger to be hurt by the Jades, but the Jades are in hazard of being kickt and <U+017F>poyled by the good Hor<U+017F>es.</p>
                     <p>Never think of any think el<U+017F>e but of doing well, and <U+017F>erving tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hall call thee according to their own liking, if that which they de<U+017F>ire be not prejudicial to them, but if that which they de<U+017F>ire; be to their hurt, be <U+017F>ure that thou di<U+017F>charge thy <U+017F>elf of them, and e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally excu<U+017F>e thy <U+017F>elf to the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tants, that thou may<U+017F>t per<U+017F>wade them to rea<U+017F>on. A <U+017F>weet di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition in a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife is much more commendable than a rigorous: the pain of Child-bearing is a very hard labour, which thou mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider, and accordingly conform thy <U+017F>elf to the humour of the Patient, knowing thy <U+017F>elf to be called to comfort and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t her.</p>
                     <p>Mark well, entring into a hou<U+017F>e, in what condition the Patient is; if the evil be at hand, you mu<U+017F>t encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage her, and prepare your <U+017F>elf with tho<U+017F>e things that are nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary; and fir<U+017F>t you mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ee that the Bed be well made for the woman that is to be brought to bed, and then to put on her a little <U+017F>mock, and wa<U+017F>te-coat, and other linnen nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary: And if <U+017F>he be <U+017F>o opinionated, as that <U+017F>he will not; tell her how much you do it for the better; and how great a pain it will be afterwards; content her though, <hi>for you mu<U+017F>t make of a bad Market no more then you can.</hi> You ought to give order for things to be had from the Apothecaries with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent; or if <U+017F>he be young, with the con<U+017F>ent of her friends. You mu<U+017F>t take order al<U+017F>o that <U+017F>ome good broth be made for her to take, in the time of her Travail, if it <U+017F>hould chance to be long; and al<U+017F>o two hours after her being
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59975:190"/>
brought to bed. Above all things I charge thee, that what ever bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s thou mai<U+017F>t have there, that thou go not about them too ha<U+017F>tily. For there is nothing <U+017F>o nau<U+017F>eous to be <U+017F>een, as the improvident actions of over-bu<U+017F>ie women. Never be di<U+017F>mayed if every thing go not well; for, fear di<U+017F>orders the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es; and a per<U+017F>on that keeps her wits together, without <U+017F>uffering them to be <U+017F>cattered by fear, is capable of giving a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance in weighty affairs, and e<U+017F>pecially where things are done with lei<U+017F>ure; for in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es Nature helps marvellou<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when we are mo<U+017F>t at a <U+017F>tand. There is a great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity of prudence, e<U+017F>pecially in the age wherein we live. There is now no need of <hi>Coloquintida</hi> to render any thing good in it <U+017F>elf, bitter and di<U+017F>agreeable to the ta<U+017F>te. There are few Women now a days that do give that re<U+017F>pect, or have that kindne<U+017F>s for them as in former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; for then, when their Midwife died, they <U+017F>hewed a great deal of <U+017F>orrow, and prayed God that now they might have no more Children: which though it were not well done, yet it <U+017F>hewed their affection. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, Women u<U+017F>e them as meer Hirelings.</p>
                     <p>There is a great deal of artifice to be u<U+017F>ed in the plea<U+017F>ing of our Women, e<U+017F>pecially the young ones, who many times do make election of Men to bring them to bed. I blu<U+017F>h to <U+017F>peak of them, for I take it to be a great piece of impudence to have any recour<U+017F>e unto them, unle<U+017F>s it be in a ca<U+017F>e of very great danger. I do approve it, I have approved it, and know that it ought to be done, <U+017F>o that it be concealed from the Woman all her life long; nor that <U+017F>he <U+017F>ee the Surgeon any more: for it is very inconvenient to Husbands, that (unle<U+017F>s in ca<U+017F>es of very great danger) <U+017F>uch things concerning their own Wives <U+017F>hould be communicated to any other men but them<U+017F>elves.</p>
                     <p>To this purpo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hall I tell thee Daughter, that being called to the Labour of a Friend, where were none but
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59975:191"/>
2 or 3 of her acquaintance, they asked me what I thought of the Labour: to which I an<U+017F>wered, that the Child did not come well, but that I would do the work with the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of God, without danger to the Child, or to the Mother. They de<U+017F>ired me that I would let a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon <U+017F>ee her: for their <U+017F>atisfaction, I con<U+017F>ented to it; provided that <U+017F>he might not <U+017F>ee him; for I was fearful, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould die with apprehen<U+017F>ion and <U+017F>hame; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded her to <U+017F>lide down toward the feet of the bed, and darkned the Room on that <U+017F>ide where he was to come; at the feet he touched her, and <U+017F>he was brought to bed without any other a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, <U+017F>ave that of God and Nature. Since the<U+017F>e injuries have bin put in fa<U+017F>hion, there have bin ob<U+017F>erved greater hazards and dangers in lying in than before, which might be remedied by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons capable of their profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, if they might be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. But this Detraction is <U+017F>o much in reque<U+017F>t, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <U+017F>ome kind of people, there is much ado to make them believe the truth, and e<U+017F>pecially where they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get great advantage by <U+017F>o doing, and truly, Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable per<U+017F>ons which I have had the honour to <U+017F>erve, make other women <U+017F>eem mon<U+017F>trous to me. You <U+017F>hall come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <U+017F>ome hou<U+017F>es, where there are certain per<U+017F>ons that hold <U+017F>uch fal<U+017F>e lights to the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of the Hou<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>ees quite contrary to that which is real; which per<U+017F>ons if they are not humoured, your bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s will be there <U+017F>oon di<U+017F>patched. Take great heed of coming there, for it may chance to gain you nothing but a great deal of care. There are <U+017F>ome Women that have no Children, at which they are very much troubled; which is <U+017F>o, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding that they might ea<U+017F>ily be helped, if they would tell an under<U+017F>tanding Midwife where the defect lay.</p>
                     <p>As concerning tho<U+017F>e, who are <U+017F>ent for to lay Women in the Country, I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay this, that as for tho<U+017F>e that are not very well experimented, they may incur many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards by rea<U+017F>on of their ignorance, and the multiplicity
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59975:191"/>
of accidents that may happen: And for tho<U+017F>e that are knowing, to leave their Patients in the City, is a thing that may di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e, and wrong many, and run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being no more entertained among them, to their own ruine; neither is there any certainty of a Woman that will run rambling into the Country. My la<U+017F>t ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is, that thou do well, and in <U+017F>o doing, fear nothing but God, that he may ble<U+017F>s thee, and thy endeavours.</p>
