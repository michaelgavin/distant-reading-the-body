         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

who, ev'n in the fir<U+017F>t Bud of Infancy, di<U+017F>cover'd
<U+017F>uch early Hopes of her riper Years, that <U+017F>he

Whether that Fear proceed from Super<U+017F>tition,

you may al<U+017F>o find what Adventures happen'd
to her in that Country. The Misfortunes of that
Prince had been unknown to us, if the Divine
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had not been there, and his Sufferings
had wanted that Satisfaction which her Pen has
given 'em in the Immortality of his Vertues, and
Con<U+017F>tancy; the very Memory of which, move
a generous Pity in all, and a Contempt of the
brutal Actors in that unfortunate Tragedy-Here
I can add nothing to what <U+017F>he has given

me, being one of her own Sex, who<U+017F>e Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip

makes me a<U+017F><U+017F>ure the World, there was no Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair

the whole Plantation were Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of: A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Value for his uncommon Vertues, which
every one that but hears 'em, finds in him<U+017F>elf;
and his Pre<U+017F>ence gave her no more. Be<U+017F>ide, his
Heart was too violently <U+017F>et on the everla<U+017F>ting
Charms of his <hi>Imoinda,</hi> to be <U+017F>hook with tho<U+017F>e
more faint (in his Eye) of a white Beauty;
and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>'s Relations, there pre<U+017F>ent, had too
watchful an Eye over her to permit the Frailty
of her Youth, if that had been powerful enough.
As this is fal<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o are the Con<U+017F>equences of it
too; for the Lord, her Father's Friend, that

as <U+017F>oon as he knew of her Arrival at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi>
and the publick Po<U+017F>ts he was in wou'd

and after a Repetition of all his former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ions

                  <p>This Propo<U+017F>al was <U+017F>o rea<U+017F>onable, and <U+017F>o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly

having the Reward in her own Power, as well

The time comes: <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is punctual to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,

had an implacable Hatred to the Engli<U+017F>h Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Orange,</hi> that was <U+017F>o

<hi>Thames,</hi> and de<U+017F>troy the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Ships in their

the King of <hi>England</hi> had <U+017F>hewn <U+017F>o little of the
Politician, or was <U+017F>o rul'd by evil Coun<U+017F>ellors,
that he never thought of treating with Sword
in Hand; but to <U+017F>ave the Expence of fitting
out a Fleet, had expos'd <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable a part
of it to the Re<U+017F>entment of the Enemy. This
Propo<U+017F>al of <hi>de Wit,</hi> concurring with the Advice
which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Parti<U+017F>ans in <hi>England</hi> had given
'em, was well receiv'd, and you may depend
on it, my Charming <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that it will be put
in Execution (<U+017F>aid <hi>Albert</hi>) for I can further a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure

                  <p>When <hi>Albert</hi> had di<U+017F>cover'd a Secret of this
Importance, and with all tho<U+017F>e Marks of a <U+017F>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere

<hi>Albert</hi> <U+017F>taid to the Civilities due for a Service of
that mighty Con<U+017F>equence; and this Interview

                        <p>YOur Remarks upon my politick Capacity,
tho' they are <U+017F>harp, touch me not, but
recoil on tho<U+017F>e that have not made u<U+017F>e of the
Advantages they might have drawn from thence;
and are doubly to blame. Fir<U+017F>t in <U+017F>ending a

they cou'd not confide; and next, not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand
when a Per<U+017F>on indifferent tells 'em a
probable Story, and which if it come to pa<U+017F>s,
wou'd <U+017F>ufficiently puni<U+017F>h their Incredulity; and
which if followed, wou'd have put 'em on their

who watch'd e'ery Opportunity of returning
the <U+017F>everal Repul<U+017F>es, and Damages they had
met with of late from them. But I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd
your bu<U+017F>ie young State<U+017F>men, <U+017F>o very opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated
of their own De<U+017F>igns, that they are
<U+017F>o far from encouraging tho<U+017F>e of another, if

and <U+017F>acrifice a publick Good to their particular

                        <p>But I have let the<U+017F>e <hi>Idle</hi> Reflections (for <U+017F>uch
mu<U+017F>t all be that regard our wretched State<U+017F>men)
divert me from a more agreeable Relation: To
comply therefore with your Reque<U+017F>t, in its full
Extent, I <U+017F>hall give you an Account of both my
own Adventures, and tho<U+017F>e of a Lady of my
Acquaintance; and with her I'll begin, for 'tis
but civil to give place to a Stranger. I <U+017F>hall
convey her to your Knowledge by the Name of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:11"/>
                           <hi>Lucilla.</hi> She is of a gay, airy Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition,
middle-<U+017F>iz'd, fine black Eyes, long flowing
dark Hair. Nature has drawn her Eye-brows,
which are dark, much finer than Art u<U+017F>ually
does tho<U+017F>e of the affected Beauties of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
her Mouth is <U+017F>mall, her Lips
plump, ruddy, and fre<U+017F>h, I won't <U+017F>ay moi<U+017F>t;
her Hand <U+017F>mall; Fingers long and taper, and
her Shape better than is u<U+017F>ual among the <hi>Flemi<U+017F>h</hi>
Ladies: To this I mu<U+017F>t add, That her Wit is
much above the common Rate.</p>
                        <p>With all the<U+017F>e Accompli<U+017F>hments, you may
imagine that <U+017F>he was not without her Admirers;
among which Number, none came <U+017F>o near her
Heart, as the elde<U+017F>t Son of <hi>Ramirez,</hi> an old
<U+017F>ordid Mi<U+017F>er, that loved his Money much above
his Sons, or ev'n him<U+017F>elf; which made the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
he gave his Two Sons but very <U+017F>mall,
and not fit to enable them to make any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Figure in the World. For the real Names
of the<U+017F>e two Brothers, I mu<U+017F>t give that of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guel</hi>
and <hi>Lopez,</hi> and for the Grace of the Matter,
add Don to 'em.</p>
                        <p>Don <hi>Miguel,</hi> and Don <hi>Lopez,</hi> I know not
how they came by 'em, had Souls as brave
and generous as that of their Fathers was
wretched and ba<U+017F>e; they with Pain <U+017F>aw their
many Advantages of a liberal Education their
Fathers Covetou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s robb'd 'em of; and by
their natural Parts, and winning Behaviour,
touched their Relations <U+017F>o nearly, that they
long contributed to their Improvement, ev'n
till now the Brothers were become two
of the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>h'd and gallant Youths of
the City; their Quality gave them Admittance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:11"/>
to the be<U+017F>t Families, and their Accompli<U+017F>hments
to the Hearts of the faire<U+017F>t Ladies: but few ever
pa<U+017F>s'd farther than the Confines of theirs;
and the lighter touches of an Amoret was all
that made them <U+017F>igh, till they <U+017F>aw the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<hi>Lucilla,</hi> and her fair Cou<U+017F>in, of whom
not knowing her, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay nothing. Don
<hi>Miguel,</hi> as gay as he was, and as in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible as
he fan<U+017F>ied him<U+017F>elf, no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw <hi>Lucilla,</hi> but
he found the Difference betwixt the Force of
her Eyes, and tho<U+017F>e of the re<U+017F>t of the Ladies
of his Acquaintance: And as a Proof of it, he
was not <U+017F>ooner touch'd with Love, than Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie;
for her Cou<U+017F>in <U+017F>itting by her, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd
his Brother's Eyes often ca<U+017F>t that way,
and was very unea<U+017F>ie at it; and that Friend<U+017F>hip
that grew up with their Years, and increas'd
as they grew, found now a <U+017F>udden Check. I
will not, like your Romance-Writers, give
you an Account of all his private Reflections on
this Occa<U+017F>ion, nor the Conflict and Struggling
betwixt his old Gue<U+017F>t Friend<U+017F>hip, and this new
Intruder Love. It is enough to tell you, that
a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as Opportunity <U+017F>erv'd he took Care to
put him<U+017F>elf out of Pain, or at lea<U+017F>t to give
him<U+017F>elf a Certainty, whether his Brother was
his Rival or not; and was not a little pleas'd,
that <hi>Lucilla</hi> had only found the way to his
Heart, while his Brother <U+017F>aw nothing <U+017F>o fair
as her Cou<U+017F>in. Don <hi>Miguel</hi> and Don <hi>Lopez,</hi>
as they were in Love, <U+017F>o they were too accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>h'd
to be un<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful; and there remained
no Ob<U+017F>tacle to their Happine<U+017F>s, but their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Avarice, which wou'd never be brought
to any Rea<U+017F>on, in allowing them what was fit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:12"/>
for Per<U+017F>ons of their Rank. They coming
therefore to a Con<U+017F>ultation, what Mea<U+017F>ures to
take to cure their Father of <U+017F>o ungenerous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper
of the Mind; and by that Means, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli<U+017F>h
what they both longed for more than
Glory.</p>
                        <p>They found their Father's Avarice had not <U+017F>o
engro<U+017F>s'd his Soul, as to beat off all Sentiments
of Religion; on the contrary, he was extreamly
credulous of all the <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious parts of religion,
and particularly of all Narrations of Spectres,
Witches, Apparitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to attack him on that <U+017F>ide that cou'd
make the lea<U+017F>t Defence. He con<U+017F>tantly <U+017F>pent
part of the Morning in telling his Money, and
counting his Bags: His Sons therefore having
procur'd a Pick-lock to his Clo<U+017F>et, took Care to
place in it a Figure that was very dreadful, <U+017F>o
that the old Gentleman <U+017F>hou'd find him count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Bags and Money when he came in;
which happen'd accordingly. He was not a
little frighted, and ha<U+017F>tily retir'd, nor came
thither again in three or four Days, but on his
next coming, he was extreamly <U+017F>urpriz'd, to
find the Number of his Bags increas'd, which
for <U+017F>ome time had been le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd e'ery Morning,
<U+017F>o that he concluded it was a Reward of his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinence
from a Sight that pleas'd him too much:
Yet was <U+017F>o well pleas'd with this Increa<U+017F>e, that
he repeated his Vi<U+017F>its for three or four Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
together, and found his Bags decrea<U+017F>e on
that. He was very much troubled in Mind,
and con<U+017F>ulting his Confe<U+017F><U+017F>our on all that had
happen'd, he a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him it cou'd be none but
the Devil he had <U+017F>een; and that he was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47213:12"/>
to fear the Con<U+017F>equence of taking Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
any of the Money <U+017F>o left there by that evil
Spirit, and it was much to be doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had not exchang'd the whole. So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
with <U+017F>ome whol<U+017F>ome Advice again<U+017F>t
Avarice, he di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s'd his Penitent, who again
for <U+017F>ome time forbore his Clo<U+017F>et; and on his
next Vi<U+017F>it, finding all he had ever lo<U+017F>s'd retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and abundance more added, a Fit of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
coming on him, he re<U+017F>olv'd to try if he
cou'd out-wit the Devil; and by removing it
from that Place, which he <U+017F>uppos'd taken Po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of by the foul Fiend, <U+017F>ecure both the
Money and his own Peace of Mind. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
in the Night he digs a hole in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and conveys all the Bags into it, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
them <U+017F>afely up. His Sons the next Day,
coming to the Clo<U+017F>et, and finding all removed,
were not a little di<U+017F>appointed and troubl'd, to
think how they <U+017F>hou'd at lea<U+017F>t recover that
Money which was lent 'em by their Friends to
carry on this De<U+017F>ign. All the Difficulty lay in
di<U+017F>covering where their Father had hid it, and
to do that nothing occurr'd that wou'd hold
Water, till Don <hi>Lopez</hi> concluded to make once
more the Experiment of his Fear of Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
again<U+017F>t the next Night; therefore they
prepared the Chamber for their De<U+017F>ign, and
invited <U+017F>ome of their Friends, on purpo<U+017F>e to
make the old Gentleman drunk; which having
effected, he was carefully carried to Bed, and
three or four Statues, out of the Garden, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
up into his Room, and placed on each
<U+017F>ide and corner of his Bed, with People behind

him the<U+017F>e imaginary Spectres. All things being
in this Order, a Ma<U+017F>tiff Dog, with a great Iron
Chain, was let into the Room, the ratling of
which, in a little time, waken'd the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who began to pray very heartily; but
Fear <U+017F>till prevailing, as in De<U+017F>pair, made him
think to get out of the Room, when he heard
the Noi<U+017F>e on the other <U+017F>ide of the Room, the
mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tant from the Door. On his fir<U+017F>t Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

fla<U+017F>h'd with his Lightning, and di<U+017F>cover'd a
white pale Gho<U+017F>t to the frighted Mi<U+017F>er: So he
<U+017F>tarted back into his Bed again, and thus he
was <U+017F>erv'd on each <U+017F>ide till in De<U+017F>pair, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to die with Fear, he cou'd <U+017F>carce utter <U+017F>o
much as one Prayer. Then he heard a Voice
with a thou<U+017F>and Terrours and Threats, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him, he having taken the price of his
Soul in the Money he had removed: The old
Man replied, with a thou<U+017F>and Cro<U+017F><U+017F>es to guard
him<U+017F>elf, That the Money was in <U+017F>uch a place,
and that he wou'd <U+017F>urrender not only that, but
his own too, to be at ea<U+017F>e. When they had
thus got the Knowledge of the place where
the Trea<U+017F>ure was hid, they ea<U+017F>ily, in the Fear
he was in, convey'd away the Statues, and left
all things in Order, as if nothing had happen'd;
and repairing to the Garden, found the Money,
but took no more thence but what they had
before put there.</p>
                        <p>The next Day, the old Gentleman <U+017F>ends for
them to his Chamber, ill with the Fright, and
lets 'em know, That he had thus long been in
an Errour, in <U+017F>etting his Mind on hoarded Bags,
which ought to be plac'd in Heav'n at his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47213:13"/>
Years; but having had various Warnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
it, he now re<U+017F>olv'd a new Life, and in
order to that, wou'd immediately <U+017F>ettle his
Affairs. So he divided his E<U+017F>tate equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them; and having found his own Sum
of Money left, as he thought by the Devil, he
gave a third part to charitable u<U+017F>es, and divided
the other betwixt his Sons, and retir'd to a
Mona<U+017F>tery, where he <U+017F>oon made a very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
End.</p>
                        <p>The Sons having, by the<U+017F>e means, gain'd
their Point, did not long deferr the Happine<U+017F>s

I'm <U+017F>ure you mu<U+017F>t grant, that I have done <U+017F>o

made two <hi>Dutch</hi>-men in Love with me. <hi>Dutch</hi>-men,
do you mind me; that have no Soul for
any thing but Gain; that have no Plea<U+017F>ure,

but Intere<U+017F>t or the Bottle; but in Affairs of
Love, go to the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>acred part of it more
brutally than the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ordid of their four-footed
Brethren; nay, they are <U+017F>o far from
the Warmth of Love, that through their Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Ma<U+017F>s there is not Fire enough to give
'em a vigorous Appetite, <U+017F>o far are they from
the finene<U+017F>s of a vehement Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Yet I, Sir,
this very numerical Per<U+017F>on your Friend, and
humble Servant, have <U+017F>et two of 'em into a
Blaze. Two of very different Ages (I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <U+017F>ay Degrees too, but I remember there
are no Degrees in <hi>Holland) Vander Albert,</hi> is
about Thirty Two, of a hail Con<U+017F>titution,
<U+017F>omething more <U+017F>prightly than the re<U+017F>t of his
Country-men, and tho' infinitely fond of his
Intere<U+017F>t, and an irreconcilable Enemy to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
has by the Force of Love been oblig'd
to let me into <U+017F>ome Secrets that might have
done our King, and if not our Court, our
Country no <U+017F>mall Service. But I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay no
more of this Lover, till I <U+017F>ee you, for <U+017F>ome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Rea<U+017F>ons which you <U+017F>hall then likewi<U+017F>e
know. My other is about twice his Age, nay,
and Bulk too, tho' <hi>Albert</hi> be not the mo<U+017F>t bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary
Shape you have <U+017F>een. You mu<U+017F>t know
him by the Name of <hi>Van Bruin,</hi> and was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to me by <hi>Albert</hi> his Kin<U+017F>man, and oblig'd
by him to furni<U+017F>h me in his Ab<U+017F>ence with what
Money, or other things I <U+017F>hou'd plea<U+017F>e to
command, or have Occa<U+017F>ion for, as long as he
<U+017F>taid at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where he was like to continue
<U+017F>ome time, about a Law Suit then depending.
He had not vi<U+017F>ited me often, before I began to
be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the Influence of my Eyes, on this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47213:14"/>
old piece of worm-eaten Touch-wood: but he
had not the Confidence (and that's much) to
tell me he lov'd me, and Mode<U+017F>ty, you know,
is no common Fault of his Country-men: Tho'
I rather impute it to a Love of him<U+017F>elf, that he
wou'd not run the Hazard of being turn'd into
ridicule on <U+017F>o di<U+017F>proportion'd a Declaration;
he often in<U+017F>inuated, that he knew a Man of
Wealth and Sub<U+017F>tance, tho' <U+017F>tricken indeed in
Years, and on that Account not <U+017F>o agreeable as
a younger Man, that was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love
with me: De<U+017F>ir'd to know whether my Heart
was <U+017F>o far engag'd, that his Friend <U+017F>hou'd not
entertain any hopes. I reply'd, That I was <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to hear a Friend of <hi>Albert</hi>'s, making an
Intere<U+017F>t in me for another, that if Love were a
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion I was any way <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of, it cou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be for an old Man, and much to that
purpo<U+017F>e. But all this wou'd not do, in a Day or
Two I receiv'd this Eloquent Epi<U+017F>tle from him;
for he had heard <hi>Albert</hi> prai<U+017F>e my Wit, and he
thought, that what he writ to one <U+017F>o qualify'd,
mu<U+017F>t be in an extraordinary Style, which I <U+017F>hall
give you as near as I can, in our Language;
and which I indeed was indebted to an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter

the Hold of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, where all the

You give me hopes, that out of your <hi>Imperial</hi>

you, Child—<hi>Portline<U+017F>s</hi> is comely and
graceful; and <U+017F>ince Bulk is valu'd in all things
el<U+017F>e, why not in Man then? You value a great
Hou<U+017F>e more than a little one, an Elephant more
than an Ox; a Fir<U+017F>t Rate Ship more than a
Frigat; a Ca<U+017F>tle more than a Fort, and the
Ocean more than a Fi<U+017F>h-pond; then why not
<hi>Van Bruin</hi> more than <hi>Vander Albert.</hi> O! but
you <U+017F>ay I'm too old too—but that's more
than you know you little Wag, you; and
thereby hangs a Tale. I'm not green Wood

But then you object my betraying my Friend—but

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:19"/>
'twou'd be impertinent to trouble you with any
more of the<U+017F>e fooli<U+017F>h Letters, one or two may
divert, as a Minute or two of a Coxcomb's
Company, which on a longer Vi<U+017F>it grows nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eous:
But to give you all, 'twou'd make you
pay too dear for <U+017F>o trifling a Plea<U+017F>ure. The
other part of his Court<U+017F>hip con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting in odd
Grimaces, ridiculous Po<U+017F>tures, and antick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
cannot be <U+017F>o well de<U+017F>crib'd to you, as to
give you a true Image of 'em; <U+017F>o far at lea<U+017F>t, as
to render 'em as diverting to you as they were
for a while to me. But imagine to your <U+017F>elf,
an old, over-grown, unwieldy <hi>Dutch</hi>-man,
playing awkerdly over all that he <U+017F>uppos'd
wou'd make him look more agreeable in my
Eyes. Age he found I did not admire, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavour'd to conceal it by Dre<U+017F>s, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruque,
and clum<U+017F>ey Gayety; Re<U+017F>pect he was
inform'd I expected from a Lover, which he
wou'd expre<U+017F>s with <U+017F>uch comical Cringes, <U+017F>uch
odd <U+017F>ort of ogling, and fanta<U+017F>tick Addre<U+017F>s,
that I cou'd never force a <U+017F>erious Face on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he <U+017F>aid, for let the Subject be never <U+017F>o
grave, his Per<U+017F>on and Delivery turn'd it into a
Farce. There was no piece of Gallantry he
ob<U+017F>erv'd, perform'd by the young Gentlemen
of the City, but he attempted in Imitation of
them, ev'n to Poetry; but that indeed in his
own Language, and <U+017F>o might be extraordinary
for ought I know.</p>
                        <p>Thus I diverted my <U+017F>elf with him in <hi>Albert</hi>'s
Ab<U+017F>ence, till he began to a<U+017F><U+017F>ume and grow
trouble<U+017F>ome, on my bare Permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F>s,
for a very little Incouragement <U+017F>erves
that Nation, full of their own dear <U+017F>elves; <U+017F>o
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:20"/>
that to rid my <U+017F>elf of him, I found no more
ready way, than to let <hi>Albert</hi> know all his
Treachery to him, and the many con<U+017F>iderable
Proffers he had made me to win me to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ires.
But <hi>Albert,</hi> with an unu<U+017F>ual Re<U+017F>entment
of the<U+017F>e Affairs, threaten'd his Death, which
was going farther than I de<U+017F>ir'd; for tho' I had
no Kindne<U+017F>s for either of them, yet I had <U+017F>o
much for my <U+017F>elf, as not to be the Occa<U+017F>ion of
any Murder, or become the talk of the City on
<U+017F>o ridiculous an Occa<U+017F>ion; <U+017F>o I pacified <hi>Albert,</hi>
and made him <U+017F>ee how fooli<U+017F>h <U+017F>uch an Attempt
on an old Man wou'd look, and per<U+017F>waded him
only the next Vi<U+017F>it he made me, to upbraid him
with his Treachery, and forbid him the Hou<U+017F>e,
and if need were, to threaten him a little. But
this produced a very ridiculous Scene, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of more Spectators: For my <hi>Ne<U+017F>torean</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wou'd not give ground to <hi>Albert,</hi> but was
as high, as he; challeng'd him to <hi>Snick</hi> or <hi>Snee</hi>
for me, and a thou<U+017F>and things as comical; in
<U+017F>hort, nothing but my po<U+017F>itive Command cou'd
<U+017F>atisfie him, and on that, he promis'd no
more to trouble me; <U+017F>ure, as he thought, of
me, and was Thunder-<U+017F>truck when he heard
me not only forbid him the Hou<U+017F>e, but ridicule
all his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to his Rival <hi>Albert;</hi> and with
a Countenance full of De<U+017F>pair, went away, not
only from my Lodgings, but the next Day from

Sir <hi>Bernand Ga<U+017F>coign</hi> had brought with

the Water, which was al<U+017F>o <U+017F>een by all in their

were put at the ends on purpo<U+017F>e to <U+017F>urprize
and amu<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e that look'd through 'em; till
after having taken 'em out, rubb'd, and put

I've often heard her a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, that the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<U+017F>aw it: The Figure was this: A four<U+017F>quare
Floor of various colour'd Marble, from which
a<U+017F>cended rows of fluted and twi<U+017F>ted Pillars,

more Reputation than Profit.</p>
                  <p>The Re<U+017F>t of her Life was entirely dedicated
to Plea<U+017F>ure and Poetry; the Succe<U+017F>s in which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47213:22"/>
gain'd her the Acquaintance and Friend<U+017F>hip of
the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Men of the Age; and the Love
of not a few of different Characters; for tho' a
Sot have no Portion of Wit of his own, he
yet like Old Age, covets what he cannot enjoy.
I can't allow a Fool to be touch'd with the
Charms of Wit, but the Reputation that is
gain'd by Wit; which being a thing beyond his
Reach, he is fond of it becau<U+017F>e it plea<U+017F>es others,
not him<U+017F>elf: Our <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had many of the<U+017F>e, who
profe<U+017F>s'd not a little Love for her, and whom <U+017F>he
us'd as Fools <U+017F>hou'd be us'd, for her Sport, and
the Diver<U+017F>ion of her better Acquaintance. I
went to vi<U+017F>it her one Day, and found with her
a young brisk pert Fop very gayly dre<U+017F>s'd,
and who after an Abundance of Impertinence,
left us. His Figure was <U+017F>o extraordinary, that
I cou'd not but enquire into his Name, and
more particular Character, which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> gave
me in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>This is a young vain Coxcomb, but newly
come from the Univer<U+017F>ity, and full of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
<U+017F>elf-Opinion, and Pride of that Place,
takes the common Privilege of being very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
in all Company, e<U+017F>pecially among
Women, and Men that under<U+017F>tand not the
Jargon of the Schools. He's of a good Family,
and was left a pretty good paternal E<U+017F>tate,
which he endeavour'd to encrea<U+017F>e by marrying
a rich Aunt he had in the Country, who had
Occa<U+017F>ion for ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a Fop; for tho' he has
not been two Years from <hi>Oxford,</hi> he has met
with <U+017F>everal uncommon Adventures, and among
the re<U+017F>t, his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to me <U+017F>hall not be the

Going down to take Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of his Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
E<U+017F>tate, and full of no very good Thoughts
of wronging his Brothers, he lay at this Aunts's;
who, tho' none of the younge<U+017F>t, was not old
enough yet to have given off all Thoughts of
Love, or to be exempted from the Effects of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment;
for after a long Intrigue with the
Steward of her E<U+017F>tate, <U+017F>he was, or imagin'd at
lea<U+017F>t, that <U+017F>he was with Child; and tho' <U+017F>he
lik'd him well enough for a Gallant, <U+017F>he cou'd
by no means think him fit for a Husband, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becau<U+017F>e her Pride wou'd not permit her to
think of her Servant for her Ma<U+017F>ter, or that <U+017F>he
fear'd to give him a Power over her Conduct,
who had been a Witne<U+017F>s how weak a Guard of
Virtue <U+017F>he had to <U+017F>ecure the conjugal Duty, he
might expect from her as her Husband: But
whatever was the Motive, the Arrival of her
Nephew gave her other Thoughts, finding
him a fit Coxcomb for her ends; for you find,
that a little Conver<U+017F>ation will let you into his
Character, at lea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o far as to di<U+017F>cover
him to be a very <U+017F>elf-conceited Fool, and one
on whom by Con<U+017F>equence, Flattery wou'd have
no <U+017F>mall Effect. His Aunt having made this
Di<U+017F>covery, took Care to detain him <U+017F>ome Days
longer than he intended, and by all the cunning
Arts of a de<U+017F>igning Woman, gave him Cau<U+017F>e to
believe that his Suit wou'd not be very un<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
if he <U+017F>hou'd make his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to her. He
naturally thought well of him<U+017F>elf, and fir'd
with <U+017F>o many Advances that his Aunt made
to him, he re<U+017F>olv'd to trie if he cou'd gain

She was a Woman that had yet a Re<U+017F>t of
Beauty, improv'd too by the help of Art,
that <U+017F>he might pretend, without vanity, to a
conque<U+017F>t, where no brighter or more youthful
Faces interpos'd; to this <U+017F>he had an engaging
Air, and a <U+017F>prightly Conver<U+017F>ation: but that
which compleated the Victory over our young
Spark, was her E<U+017F>tate; that was exceeding
beautiful, becau<U+017F>e very great, and, join'd with
her other Charms, was not to be re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by a
Man who was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd with the contrary Vices

a thir<U+017F>t of Wealth, which he perpetually <U+017F>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd;
for he was incapable of doing a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

as particularly that which I'm ju<U+017F>t going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
after his Marriage with his Aunt, for there
ended this Amour.</p>
                  <p>Some <U+017F>mall time after the con<U+017F>ummation of
the Nuptials, finding her fears of being with
Child vain, and quite tired of the Fool her
Husband, <U+017F>he perpetually was contriving how
to get hand<U+017F>omly rid of him; for though he
<U+017F>eem'd to love her well enough for a Wife, yet
he was too watchful of her motions to give her
opportunity of tho<U+017F>e Plea<U+017F>ures <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o long
taken with liberty. This made her very ill
humour'd and cro<U+017F>s; which he endeavour'd,
by plea<U+017F>ing her all the ways he cou'd think of,
to remove: But all in vain, unle<U+017F>s he cou'd
remove him<U+017F>elf, and his legal Right to her
E<U+017F>tate, all his Care<U+017F><U+017F>es and Complai<U+017F>ance <U+017F>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
nothing. In <U+017F>hort, after <U+017F>he had acted
this part <U+017F>ome time, and made him very earne<U+017F>t
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:24"/>
in the enquiry into the cau<U+017F>e of her Chagrin,
<U+017F>he inform'd him, that <U+017F>he was very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
the chief motive that engag'd him to make love
to her was her E<U+017F>tate, and that all his profe<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions
of Love were only fal<U+017F>e baits to delude her
too credulous Heart, and catch her E<U+017F>tate;
that <U+017F>he cou'd never forgive her<U+017F>elf, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd
by <U+017F>o unexperienc'd a Youth, or ever
have patience to <U+017F>upport the affliction this
gave her.</p>
                  <p>He us'd all the Arguments he could think of
to convince her of her Error, and that he lov'd
her with a <U+017F>incere and tender Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, without
any regard to her E<U+017F>tate, of which <U+017F>he was as
entirely Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s as before. In vain was all he
<U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he turn'd it to a contrary end to what he
meant it; told him 'twas ea<U+017F>ie profe<U+017F><U+017F>ing his
Love <U+017F>incere, when he was in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the
fruits of his pa<U+017F>t Di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, and that <U+017F>he
cou'd never believe her Fortune had no <U+017F>hare
in his Affections, as long as he was Ma<U+017F>ter of it
whether <U+017F>he wou'd or not; that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pair,
being <U+017F>o much older than him, of long
being able <U+017F>o much as of a cold Civility, when
it was out of her power to give him any more.
He, out of a fooli<U+017F>h fan<U+017F>ie of Genero<U+017F>ity, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ive
good Opinion of his own Charms and

of a way to <U+017F>atisfie her Doubts, and, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
proof of his Love, remove all tho<U+017F>e
Anxieties that gave her <U+017F>o much Pain, and
robb'd him of his Re<U+017F>t and Satisfaction; for to
<U+017F>hew her that it was her Per<U+017F>on, and that alone
which he e<U+017F>teem'd, he would immediately put
her Fortune into her own po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion again, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47213:24"/>
keep no other Right he had to any thing of
hers but her Per<U+017F>on, which was the Trea<U+017F>ure he
only coveted a quiet enjoyment of.</p>
                  <p>This was the point <U+017F>he had all this while been
lab'ring to gain, and you may imagine <U+017F>he lo<U+017F>t not
the lucky Minute of the Fools ridiculous Fondne<U+017F>s.
The Writings were made, and <U+017F>he put in ab<U+017F>olute
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of all her Fortune, and had therefore
no farther need of a longer Di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation; nay,
the curb that had been <U+017F>et on her unruly Will
for the <U+017F>hort time of their Marriage, provok'd
her to ob<U+017F>erve no mea<U+017F>ures with him, whom
<U+017F>he could not forgive the many Plea<U+017F>ures he had
di<U+017F>appointed her of. He was fir<U+017F>t tormented
with fre<U+017F>h Proofs, ev'ry day, of his being a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Cuckold, to which were added the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
of the Servants, and the Contempt of the
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; and when none of the<U+017F>e wou'd rid her
hands of him who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ight <U+017F>he loath'd, having
taken particular care to have him well beaten,
<U+017F>he thru<U+017F>t him out of doors, to provide for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf.
His late treatment made him unwilling
to return, for fear of a wor<U+017F>e reception; and
<U+017F>ince he had found all means ineffectual to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
her, he concluded to pa<U+017F>s on to his own

<U+017F>eizes her, u<U+017F>es all the Arguments he could to
per<U+017F>uade her Reformation, and Re-union to a
Man that yet had a value for her; but all in

Per<U+017F>on, though he had nothing to do with her
E<U+017F>tate; 'twas in vain for her to <U+017F>truggle, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he

all the way how to get rid of him; and being
come there, on <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion there happen'd to

on his threats, prevail'd with her to go quietly

He a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd them he was her Husband, and that

that is, of one whom Learning, ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood,
has fitted for a publick Coxcomb,
and of whom there is <U+017F>carce any one <U+017F>o ignorant,

                  <p>Why truly (reply'd <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) he is grown <U+017F>o
trouble<U+017F>ome now, that I <U+017F>hall be forced to u<U+017F>e

<hi>Ly<U+017F>ander</hi> <U+017F>hall have no hand in it, both to <U+017F>ecure

I promis'd to give her all the A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance I

Rudene<U+017F>s, the Per<U+017F>on affronted mu<U+017F>t be look'd
upon as a Coward, if he take not Satisfaction:
I can imagine no rea<U+017F>on in the world, why a

impertinent Love of a Fool that will not be

to her power: <hi>Wit</hi> is the Weapon <U+017F>he had
to fight with, and that <U+017F>he was to make u<U+017F>e of
in her Satisfaction; to which, as a Second, I
was very willing to contribute; though the
Part <U+017F>he afterwards engag'd me to play was not
<U+017F>o agreeable to me as I at fir<U+017F>t imagin'd; for to
give a conceited Coxcomb any rea<U+017F>on to believe
he has an A<U+017F>cendant over a Woman, and then
allow him the lea<U+017F>t Opportunity, is to put her
<U+017F>elf in a manife<U+017F>t hazard of her Honour and
Satisfaction. But this I did not much con<U+017F>ider,
being willing to free my Friend from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of one <U+017F>he cou'd no more <U+017F>uffer, than
know how to be hand<U+017F>omly rid of.</p>
                  <p>And upon her Per<U+017F>ua<U+017F>ion, I took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of his next Vi<U+017F>it, to give him all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
imaginable to make him think me extremely
taken with his Per<U+017F>on: Which Interview <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
took care to improve on my departure, and to
let him know that I was a Per<U+017F>on of no le<U+017F>s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

of an unfaithful Wife. Flattery, as it has <U+017F>ome
power on the mo<U+017F>t Sen<U+017F>ible, <U+017F>o it is of <U+017F>uch force
with a Fool, that no Con<U+017F>ideration can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
it. He <U+017F>oon thought the pur<U+017F>uit of me
more eligible, where he imagin'd his Perfections
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47213:27"/>
had made <U+017F>uch an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that I cou'd no
more re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Charm, than the barren Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
he had hitherto entertain'd for <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> In <U+017F>hort,
<U+017F>he came to a perfect under<U+017F>tanding, and the
A<U+017F><U+017F>ignation was made, and <U+017F>ome Friends provided
to be in readine<U+017F>s to di<U+017F>appoint him, when he
mo<U+017F>t thought me his own. But the Gentlemen
retir'd to the Balcony, to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>ome <U+017F>udden
Hubbub in the Street, and my Lover, full of
him<U+017F>elf, and the opinion of my being wholly
at his devotion, pre<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>o hard for the victory,
that when nothing el<U+017F>e wou'd <U+017F>ecure me; I was
forc'd to cry out: On which the Gentlemen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd,
and he believing one of 'em my
Husband, was in a mo<U+017F>t dreadful fright, and
<U+017F>oon di<U+017F>cover'd the ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of his Spirit; for
in hopes to get clear off him<U+017F>elf, accus'd me to
him he <U+017F>uppos'd my Husband. But this not
availing, he was hand<U+017F>omly to<U+017F>s'd in a Blanket,
wa<U+017F>h'd, and turn'd out of doors. All which
Misfortunes he di<U+017F><U+017F>embl'd to <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
his Suit to her; till by appointment, I
and the two Gentlemen enter'd the Room, and
expos'd the truth of the Story: which he cou'd
not deny; and, confounded with the Reproaches
of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and the whole Company's laughing at
him, he never after troubl'd her with a Vi<U+017F>it.</p>
                  <p>This was the end of this ridiculous Amour.
But that which touch'd her Heart, cou'd not be
<U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>pos'd of. I have already mention'd
<hi>Ly<U+017F>ander,</hi> as a Lover <U+017F>he valu'd; and he having
contributed her Letters to him, to the la<U+017F>t Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay no more of it than what tho<U+017F>e

                        <p>WHEN <U+017F>hall we under<U+017F>tand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
For I thought, dear <hi>Lycidas,</hi> you
had been a Man of your Parole: I will as <U+017F>oon
believe you will forget me, as that you have
not remember'd the Promi<U+017F>e you made me.
Confe<U+017F>s you are the teazinge<U+017F>t Creature in the
World, rather than <U+017F>uffer me to think you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
me, or wou'd put a <U+017F>light upon me, that
have cho<U+017F>en you from all the whole Creation,
to give my entire E<U+017F>teem to. This I had a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ur'd
you Ye<U+017F>terday, but that I dreaded the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of your Cen<U+017F>ure to Day; and though I
<U+017F>corn to guard my Tongue, as hoping 'twill
never offend willingly; yet I can, with much
adoe, hold it, when I have a great mind to <U+017F>ay
a thou<U+017F>and things I know will be taken in an
ill <U+017F>ence. Po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly you will wonder what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells
me to write, what moves me to <U+017F>end where
I find <U+017F>o little Welcome; nay, where I meet
with <U+017F>uch Returns, it may be I wonder too.

You <U+017F>ay I am chang'd: I had rather almo<U+017F>t ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tifie
an Ill, than Repent, maintain fal<U+017F>e Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
than yield I am i'th' Wrong. In fine,
Charming Friend <hi>Lycidas,</hi> whatever I was <U+017F>ince
you knew me, believe I am <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame in
Soul and Thought; but that is, what <U+017F>hall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hurt you, what <U+017F>hall never be but to <U+017F>erve
you; Why then did you <U+017F>ay you wou'd not
<U+017F>it near me? Was that, my Friend, was that
the E<U+017F>teem you profe<U+017F>s? Who grows cold
fir<U+017F>t? Who is chang'd? and Who the Aggre<U+017F><U+017F>or?
'Tis I was fir<U+017F>t in Friend<U+017F>hip, and <U+017F>hall be la<U+017F>t in

like a Foe, and continue to impo<U+017F>e upon me,

                        <p>I Had rather, dear <hi>Lycidas,</hi> <U+017F>et my <U+017F>elf to write
to any Man on Earth than you; for I fear your
<U+017F>evere Prudence and Di<U+017F>cretion, <U+017F>o nice, may
make an ill Judgment of what I <U+017F>ay: Yet you
bid me not di<U+017F><U+017F>emble; and you need not have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47213:30"/>
caution'd me, who <U+017F>o naturally hate tho<U+017F>e
little Arts of my Sex, that I often run on free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
that may well enough bear a Cen<U+017F>ure
from People <U+017F>o <U+017F>crupulous as <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Nor dare
I follow all my Inclinations neither, nor tell all
the little Secrets of my Soul: Why I write them,
I can give no account; 'tis but fooling my <U+017F>elf,
perhaps, into an Undoing. I do but (by this
<U+017F>oft Entertainment) rook in my Heart, like a
young Game<U+017F>ter, to make it venture its la<U+017F>t
Stake: This, I <U+017F>ay, may be the Danger; I may
come off unhurt, but cannot be a <hi>Winner:</hi> Why
then <U+017F>hou'd I throw an uncertain Ca<U+017F>t, where I
hazard all, and you nothing? Your <U+017F>tanch
Prudence is Proof again<U+017F>t Love, and all the
Bank's on my <U+017F>ide: You are <U+017F>o unrea<U+017F>onable,
you wou'd have me pay, where I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
no Debt; you wou'd have me give, and
you, like a Mi<U+017F>er, wou'd di<U+017F>tribute nothing.
Greedy <hi>Lycidas!</hi> Uncon<U+017F>cionable! and Unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous!
You wou'd not be in Love, for all the
World, yet wi<U+017F>h I were <U+017F>o, Uncharitable!—Wou'd
my Fever Cure you? or a Cur<U+017F>e on me,
make you Ble<U+017F>s'd? Say, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> Will it? I
have heard, when two Souls kindly meet, 'tis
a va<U+017F>t Plea<U+017F>ure, as va<U+017F>t as the Cur<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be, when
Kindne<U+017F>s is not equal; and why <U+017F>hou'd you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for me, that will be <U+017F>o very
incommode for you? Will you, Dear <hi>Lycidas,</hi>
allow then, that you have le<U+017F>s Good-nature
than I? Pray be Ju<U+017F>t, till you can give <U+017F>uch
Proofs of the contrary, as I <U+017F>hall be Judge of;
or give me a Rea<U+017F>on for your Ill-nature. So
much for Loving.</p>

to con<U+017F>ider what Re<U+017F>olution I took up, when I
<U+017F>aw you la<U+017F>t, (which methinks is a long time)

Shew then, I <U+017F>ay, my deare<U+017F>t Love, thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

Tell me no more you love me; for 'twill be hard

Though you think it U<U+017F>e, methinks, I find

                        <p>WHy, my deare<U+017F>t Charmer, do you di<U+017F>turb
that Repo<U+017F>e I had re<U+017F>olved to pur<U+017F>ue, by
taking it unkindly that I did not write? I cannot
di<U+017F>obey you, becau<U+017F>e indeed I wou'd not, tho'
'twere better much for both I had been for ever
<U+017F>ilent: I prophe<U+017F>ie <U+017F>o, but at the <U+017F>ame time cannot
help my Fate, and know not what Force or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
there is in the Vertue we both profe<U+017F>s; but I
am <U+017F>ure 'tis not good to tempt it: I think I am
<U+017F>ure, and I think my <hi>Lycidas</hi> ju<U+017F>t; But, oh! to
what purpo<U+017F>e is all this fooling? You have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
wi<U+017F>ely con<U+017F>idered it; but I never <U+017F>tay'd to
think till 'twas too late; and whatever Re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I make in the ab<U+017F>ence of my lovely Friend,
one <U+017F>ingle <U+017F>ight turns me all Woman, and all
his. Take notice then, my <hi>Lycidas,</hi> I will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
never be wi<U+017F>e more; never make any
Vows again<U+017F>t my Inclinations, or the little wing'd
Deity. I do not only <U+017F>ee 'tis all in vain, but I
really believe they <U+017F>erve only to augment my
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. I own I have neither the Coldne<U+017F>s of
<hi>Lycidas,</hi> nor the Prudence; I cannot either not
Love, or have a Thou<U+017F>and Arts of hiding it; I
have no Body to fear, and therefore may have
<U+017F>ome Body to Love: But if you are de<U+017F>tin'd to
be he, the Lord have mercy on me; for I am
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47213:34"/>
<U+017F>ure you'll have none. I expect a Reprimand
for this plain Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion; but I mu<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>tifie it,
and I will, becau<U+017F>e I cannot help it: I was
born to Ill Luck, and this Lo<U+017F>s of my Heart is,
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, not the lea<U+017F>t part on't. Do not let me
<U+017F>ee you di<U+017F>approve it, I may one Day grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ham'd
on't, and reclaim, but never, whil<U+017F>t
you blow the Flame, tho' perhaps again<U+017F>t your
Will. I expect now a very wi<U+017F>e An<U+017F>wer; and,
I believe, with abundance of Di<U+017F>cretion, you
will caution me to avoid this Danger that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens.
Do <U+017F>o, if you have a mind to make me
launch farther into the main Sea of Love: Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deal with me as with a right Woman; make
me believe my <U+017F>elf infinitely belov'd. I may chance
from the natural Incon<U+017F>tancy of my Sex, to be
as fal<U+017F>e as you wou'd wi<U+017F>h, and leave you in quiet:
For as I am <U+017F>atisfi'd I love in vain, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
I'm <U+017F>atisfi'd that nothing, but the thing that
hates me, cou'd treat me as <hi>Lycidas</hi> do's; and 'tis
only the vanity of being belov'd by me can make
you countenance a <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing to you.
How cou'd any thing, but the Man that hates me,
entertain me <U+017F>o unkindly? witne<U+017F>s your excellent
Opinion of me, of loving others; witne<U+017F>s your
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by the end of the Street where I live, and
<U+017F>quandring away your time at any Coffee-Hou<U+017F>e,

dy'd, I fainted, and pin'd for an Hour of what you

Judgment may not pa<U+017F>s? that you may not be

told me your Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s wou'd permit you to come
every Night, but your Inclinations wou'd not: At
lea<U+017F>t this was hone<U+017F>t, but very unkind and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
civil. Do not you, my Amiable <hi>Lycidas,</hi> know
I wou'd purcha<U+017F>e your <U+017F>ight at any Rate; Why

I am a Fellow that do not de<U+017F>ire to be pleas'd, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Why truly, my dear <hi>Lycidas,</hi> where it was, and

<hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> 1686. and was buried in
the Cloy<U+017F>ters of <hi>We<U+017F>tmin<U+017F>ter-Abby,</hi> cover'd only
with a plain Marble-<U+017F>tone, with two wretched
Ver<U+017F>es on it, made, as I'm inform'd, by a very
ingenious Gentleman, tho' no Poet, the very
Per<U+017F>on whom the Envious of our Sex, and the
Malicious of the other, wou'd needs have the
Author of mo<U+017F>t of hers; which, to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
were her own Product, without the
A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of any thing but Nature, which <U+017F>hews
it <U+017F>elf indeed without the Embarra<U+017F><U+017F>ments of
Art in e'ry thing <U+017F>he has writ.</p>
                  <p>She was of a generous and open Temper,
<U+017F>omething pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate, very <U+017F>erviceable to her
Friends in all that was in her Power; and cou'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47213:36"/>
<U+017F>ooner forgive an Injury, than do one. She
had Wit, Honour, Good-humour, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
She was Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of all the plea<U+017F>ing Arts
of Conver<U+017F>ation, but us'd 'em not to any but
tho<U+017F>e who lov'd Plain-dealing. She was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Sen<U+017F>e, and by Con<U+017F>equence a Lover of
Plea<U+017F>ure, as indeed all, both Men and Women,
are; but only <U+017F>ome wou'd be thought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Conditions of Humanity, and place
their chief Plea<U+017F>ure in a proud, vain Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie:
For my part, I knew her intimately, and
never <U+017F>aw ought unbecoming the ju<U+017F>t Mode<U+017F>ty
of our Sex, tho' more gay and free than the
Folly of the preci<U+017F>e will allow. She was, I'm
<U+017F>atisfy'd, a greater Honour to our Sex than all
the canting Tribe of Di<U+017F><U+017F>emblers, that die with
the fal<U+017F>e Reputation of Saints. This I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to <U+017F>ay, becau<U+017F>e I'm unknown, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful
Cen<U+017F>ures of my Sex will not reach me,
<U+017F>ince they will never be able to draw the Veil,
and di<U+017F>cover the Speaker of the<U+017F>e bold Truths.
If I have done my dead Friend any manner of
Ju<U+017F>tice, I am <U+017F>atisfy'd, having obtain'd my End:
If not, the Reader mu<U+017F>t remember that there

little <U+017F>hort Habits of 'em, and glorious
Wreaths for their Heads, Necks, Arms and

Pins and Needles; which they us'd only as
Tools to drill Holes with in their Ears, No<U+017F>es
and Lips, where they hang a great many little
things; as long Beads, bits of Tin, Bra<U+017F>s or
Silver, beat thin; and any <U+017F>hining Trinket.
The Beads they weave into Aprons about a
Quarter of an Ell long, and of the <U+017F>ame breadth;
working them very prettily in Flowers of <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Colours of Beads; which Apron they wear

the Men wearing a long <U+017F>tripe of Linen,
which they deal with us for. They thread
the<U+017F>e Beads al<U+017F>o on long Cotton threads, and
make Girdles to tie their Aprons to, which
come twenty times, or more, about the Wa<U+017F>te,
and then cro<U+017F>s, like a Shoulder-belt, both ways,
and round their Necks, Arms and Legs. This
Adornment, with their long black Hair, and
the Face painted in little Specks or Flowers

here and there, makes 'em a wonderful Figure
to behold. Some of the Beauties which indeed
are finely <U+017F>hap'd, as almo<U+017F>t all are, and who
have pretty Features, are very charming and
novel; for they have all that is called Beauty,
except the Colour, which is a reddi<U+017F>h Yellow;
or after a new Oiling, which they often u<U+017F>e
to them<U+017F>elves, they are of the colour of a new
Brick, but <U+017F>mooth, <U+017F>oft and <U+017F>leek. They are
extreme mode<U+017F>t and ba<U+017F>hful, very <U+017F>hy, and nice
of being touch'd. And though they are all thus
naked, if one lives for ever among 'em, there
is not to be <U+017F>een an indecent Action, or Glance;
and being continually us'd to <U+017F>ee one another
<U+017F>o unadorn'd, <U+017F>o like our fir<U+017F>t Parents before
the Fall, it <U+017F>eems as if they had no Wi<U+017F>hes;
there being nothing to heighten Curio<U+017F>ity; but
all you can <U+017F>ee, you <U+017F>ee at once, and every
moment <U+017F>ee; and where there is no Novelty,
there can be no Curio<U+017F>ity. Not but I have
<U+017F>een a hand<U+017F>om young <hi>Indian,</hi> dying for Love
of a very beautiful young <hi>Indian</hi> Maid; but all
his Court<U+017F>hip was, to fold his Arms, pur<U+017F>ue
her with his Eyes, and Sighs were all his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
While <U+017F>he, as if no <U+017F>uch Lover were
pre<U+017F>ent, or rather, as if <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired none <U+017F>uch,
carefully guarded her Eyes from beholding him;
and never approach'd him, but <U+017F>he look'd down
with all the blu<U+017F>hing mode<U+017F>ty I have <U+017F>een in
the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>evere and cautious of our World.
And the<U+017F>e People repre<U+017F>ented to me an ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>Idea</hi> of the fir<U+017F>t State of Innocence, before
Man knew how to <U+017F>in: And 'tis mo<U+017F>t evident

alone, if <U+017F>he were permitted, that better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructs

Man: Religion wou'd here but de<U+017F>troy that
Tranquillity they po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s by Ignorance; and
Laws wou'd but teach 'em to know Offence,
of which now they have no Notion. They
once made Mourning and Fa<U+017F>ting for the Death
of the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Governor, who had given his
Hand to come on <U+017F>uch a day to 'em, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
came nor <U+017F>ent; believing, when once a
Man's Word was pa<U+017F>t, nothing but Death cou'd
or <U+017F>hou'd prevent his keeping it: And when
they <U+017F>aw he was not dead, they ask'd him
what Name they had for a Man who promis'd
a thing he did not do? The Governor told
them, Such a Man was a <hi>Lyar,</hi> which was a
Word of Infamy to a Gentleman. Then one
of 'em reply'd, <hi>Governor, you are a Lyar, and
guilty of that Infamy.</hi> They have a native
Ju<U+017F>tice, which knows no Fraud; and they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand
no Vice, or Cunning, but when they
are taught by the <hi>White</hi> Men. They have Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Wives; which, when they grow old,
they <U+017F>erve tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ucceed 'em, who are
young, but with a Servitude ea<U+017F>ie and re<U+017F>pected;
and unle<U+017F>s they take Slaves in War, they have
no other Attendants.</p>
                  <p>Tho<U+017F>e on that <hi>Continent</hi> where I was, had no

with great Re<U+017F>ignation.</p>
                  <p>A War-Captain is a Man who has led them
on to Battle with Conduct and Succe<U+017F>s; of
whom I <U+017F>hall have occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>peak more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,

With the<U+017F>e People, as I <U+017F>aid, we live in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Tranquillity, and good Under<U+017F>tanding, as
it behoves us to do; they knowing all the
places where to <U+017F>eek the be<U+017F>t Food of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and the means of getting it; and for very
<U+017F>mall and unvaluable Trifles, <U+017F>upply us with
what 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for us to get; for they do
not only in the Wood, and over the <hi>Sevana's,</hi>
in Hunting, <U+017F>upply the parts of Hounds, by
<U+017F>wiftly <U+017F>couring through tho<U+017F>e almo<U+017F>t impa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>able
places, and by the meer Activity of their
Feet, run down the nimble<U+017F>t Deer, and other
eatable Bea<U+017F>ts: But in the Water, one wou'd
think they were Gods of the Rivers, or Fellow-Citizens
of the Deep; <U+017F>o rare an Art they
have in Swimming, Diving, and almo<U+017F>t Living
in Water; by which they command the le<U+017F>s
<U+017F>wift Inhabitants of the Floods. And then for
Shooting; what they cannot take, or reach
with their Hands, they do with Arrows; and
have <U+017F>o admirable an Aim, that they will <U+017F>plit
almo<U+017F>t an Hair; and at any di<U+017F>tance that an
Arrow can reach, they will <U+017F>hoot down Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and other Fruit, and only touch the Stalk
with the Dart's Point, that they may not hurt
the Fruit. So that they being, on all occa<U+017F>ions,
very u<U+017F>eful to us, we find it ab<U+017F>olutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
to care<U+017F>s 'em as Friends, and not to treat
'em as Slaves; nor dare we do other, their
Numbers <U+017F>o far <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ing ours in that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho<U+017F>e then whom we make u<U+017F>e of to work
in our Plantations of Sugar, are <hi>Negro's, Black</hi>-Slaves
altogether; which are tran<U+017F>ported thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this manner:</p>

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:39"/>
Tho<U+017F>e who want Slaves, make a Bargain
with a Ma<U+017F>ter, or a Captain of a Ship, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
to pay him <U+017F>o much a-piece, a matter of
Twenty Pound a Head for as many as he agrees
for, and to pay for 'em when they <U+017F>hall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
on <U+017F>uch a Plantation: So that when
there arrives a Ship laden with Slaves, they
who have <U+017F>o contracted, go a-board, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their number by Lot; and perhaps in
one Lot that may be for ten, there may happen
to be three or four Men; the re<U+017F>t Women
and Children: or be there more or le<U+017F>s of
either Sex, you are oblig'd to be contented with
your Lot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coramantien,</hi> a Countrey of <hi>Blacks</hi> <U+017F>o called,
was one of tho<U+017F>e places in which they found
the mo<U+017F>t advantageous Trading for the<U+017F>e Slaves,
and thither mo<U+017F>t of our great Traders in that
Merchandi<U+017F>e traffick'd; for that Nation is
very war-like and brave; and having a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Campaign, being always in Ho<U+017F>tility with
one neighbouring Prince or other, they had
the fortune to take a great many Captives; for
all they took in Battle were <U+017F>old as Slaves; at
lea<U+017F>t, tho<U+017F>e common Men who cou'd not ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om
them<U+017F>elves. Of the<U+017F>e Slaves <U+017F>o taken, the
General only has all the Profit; and of the<U+017F>e
Generals, our Captains and Ma<U+017F>ters of Ships buy
all their Freights.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Coramantien</hi> was him<U+017F>elf a Man
of an Hundred and odd Years old, and had
no Son, though he had many beautiful <hi>Black</hi>-Wives;
for mo<U+017F>t certainly, there are Beauties
that can charm of that Colour. In his younger
years he had had many gallant Men to his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:40"/>
Sons, thirteen of which died in Battle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
when they fell; and he had only left
him for his Succe<U+017F><U+017F>or, one Grand-Child, Son
to one of the<U+017F>e dead Victors; who, as <U+017F>oon as
he could bear a Bow in his Hand, and a Quiver
at his back, was <U+017F>ent into the Field, to be
train'd up, by one of the olde<U+017F>t Generals, to
War; where, from his natural Inclination to
Arms, and the Occa<U+017F>ions given him, with the
good Conduct of the old General, he became,
at the age of Seventeen, one of the mo<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Captains, and brave<U+017F>t Soldiers, that ever
<U+017F>aw the Field of <hi>Mars:</hi> So that he was ador'd
as the Wonder of all that World, and the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Soldiers. Be<U+017F>ides, he was adorn'd
with a native Beauty <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>cending all tho<U+017F>e
of his gloomy Race, that he <U+017F>truck an Awe and
Reverence, even into tho<U+017F>e that knew not his
Quality; as he did into me, who beheld him
with Surprize and Wonder, when afterwards
he arriv'd in our World.</p>
                  <p>He had <U+017F>carce arriv'd at his Seventeenth
Year, when, fighting by his <U+017F>ide, the General
was kill'd with an Arrow in his Eye, which the
Prince <hi>Oroonoko</hi> (for <U+017F>o was this gallant <hi>Moor</hi>
call'd) very narrowly avoided; nor had he, if
the General, who <U+017F>aw the Arrow <U+017F>hot, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it aim'd at the Prince, had not bow'd
his Head between, on purpo<U+017F>e to receive it in
his own Body, rather than it <U+017F>hou'd touch that
of the Prince, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>aved him.</p>
                  <p>'Twas then, afflicted as <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was, that
he was proclaim'd General in the Old Man's
place; and then it was, at the fini<U+017F>hing of that
War, which had continued for two Years, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47213:40"/>
the Prince came to Court; where he had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been a Month together, from the time of
his Fifth Year, to that of Seventeen; and 'twas
amazing to imagine where it was he learn'd <U+017F>o
much Humanity; or, to give his Accompli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
a ju<U+017F>ter Name, where 'twas he got that
real Greatne<U+017F>s of Soul, tho<U+017F>e refin'd Notions
of true Honour, that ab<U+017F>olute Genero<U+017F>ity, and
that Softne<U+017F>s that was capable of the highe<U+017F>t
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Love and Gallantry, who<U+017F>e Objects
were almo<U+017F>t continually fighting Men, or tho<U+017F>e
mangl'd, or dead; who heard no Sounds, but
tho<U+017F>e of War and Groans. Some part of it we
may attribute to the care of a <hi>French-man</hi> of
Wit and Learning; who finding it turn to
very good account to be a <U+017F>ort of Royal Tutor
to this young <hi>Black,</hi> and perceiving him very
ready, apt, and quick of Apprehen<U+017F>ion, took
a great plea<U+017F>ure to teach him Morals, Language
and Science; and was for it extremely belov'd
and valu'd by him. Another rea<U+017F>on was; he
lov'd, when he came from War, to <U+017F>ee all the
<hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Gentlemen that traded thither; and
did not only learn their Language, but that of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> al<U+017F>o, with whom he traded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for Slaves.</p>
                  <p>I have often <U+017F>een and convers'd with this
Great Man, and been a Witne<U+017F>s to many of
his mighty Actions; and do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my Reader,
the mo<U+017F>t illu<U+017F>trious Courts cou'd not have
produc'd a braver Man, both for greatne<U+017F>s of
Courage and Mind, a Judgment more <U+017F>olid,
a Wit more quick, and a Conver<U+017F>ation more
<U+017F>weet and diverting. He knew almo<U+017F>t as much
as if he had read much: He had heard of,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:41"/>
and admir'd the <hi>Romans;</hi> he had heard of the
late Civil Wars in <hi>England,</hi> and the deplorable
Death of our great Monarch; and wou'd di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
of it with all the Sen<U+017F>e and Abhorrence
of the Inju<U+017F>tice imaginable. He had an extreme
good and graceful Mien, and all the Civility of
a well-bread Great Man. He had nothing of
Barbarity in his Nature, but in all Points ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F>s'd
him<U+017F>elf as if his Education had been in
<U+017F>ome <hi>Europaean</hi> Court.</p>
                  <p>This great and ju<U+017F>t Character of <hi>Oroonoko</hi>
gave me an extreme Curio<U+017F>ity to <U+017F>ee him, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when I knew he <U+017F>poke <hi>French</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli<U+017F>h,</hi>
and that I could talk with him. But
though I had heard <U+017F>o much of him, I was as
greatly <U+017F>urpriz'd when I <U+017F>aw him, as if I had
heard nothing of him; <U+017F>o beyond all Report
I found him. He came into the Room, and
addre<U+017F>s'd him<U+017F>elf to me, and <U+017F>ome other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
with the be<U+017F>t Grace in the World. He
was pretty tall, but of a <U+017F>hape the mo<U+017F>t exact
that can be fan<U+017F>y'd: The mo<U+017F>t famous Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d from Head to Foot. His Face
was not of that brown, ru<U+017F>ty Black which mo<U+017F>t
of that Nation are, but a perfect Ebony, or
poli<U+017F>h'd Jett. His Eyes were the mo<U+017F>t awful
that cou'd be <U+017F>een, and very piercing, the
White of 'em being like Snow, as were his
Teeth. His No<U+017F>e was ri<U+017F>ing and <hi>Roman,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of <hi>African</hi> and flat. His Mouth, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t
<U+017F>hap'd that cou'd be <U+017F>een; far from tho<U+017F>e
great turn'd Lips, which are <U+017F>o natural to the
re<U+017F>t of the <hi>Negroes.</hi> The whole Proportion and
Air of his Face was <U+017F>o noble, and exactly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:41"/>
form'd, that, bating his Colour, there cou'd
be nothing in Nature more beautiful, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and hand<U+017F>ome. There was no one Grace
wanting, that bears the Standard of true Beauty.
His Hair came down to his Shoulders, by the
aids of Art; which was, by pulling it out
with a Quill, and keeping it comb'd; of which
he took particular care. Nor did the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his Mind come <U+017F>hort of tho<U+017F>e of his
Per<U+017F>on; for his Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was admirable upon
almo<U+017F>t any Subject; and who-ever had heard
him <U+017F>peak, wou'd have been convinc'd of their
Errors, that all fine Wit is confin'd to the <hi>White</hi>
men, e<U+017F>pecially to tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Chri<U+017F>tendom;</hi> and
wou'd have confe<U+017F>s'd, that <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
even of reigning well, and of governing
as wi<U+017F>ely, had as great a Soul, as politick
Maxims, and was as <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of Power, as any
Prince civiliz'd in the mo<U+017F>t refined Schools of

                  <p>This Prince, <U+017F>uch as I have de<U+017F>crib'd him,
who<U+017F>e Soul and Body were <U+017F>o admirably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd,
was (while yet he was in the Court of

as 'twas po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for a brave and gallant Man to

                  <p>I have already <U+017F>aid, the old General was
kill'd by the <U+017F>hot of an Arrow, by the <U+017F>ide of
this Prince in Battle; and that <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was
made General. This old dead <hi>Hero</hi> had one
only Daughter left of his Race; a Beauty, that
to de<U+017F>cribe her truly, one need <U+017F>ay only, <U+017F>he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:42"/>
was Female to the noble Male; the beautiful
<hi>Black Venus,</hi> to our young <hi>Mars;</hi> as charming
in her Per<U+017F>on as he, and of delicate Vertues. I
have <U+017F>een an hundred <hi>White</hi> Men <U+017F>ighing after
her, and making a thou<U+017F>and Vows at her Feet,
all vain, and un<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful: And <U+017F>he was, indeed,
too great for any, but a Prince of her own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to adore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko</hi> coming from the Wars, (which
were now ended) after he had made his Court
to his Grand-father, he thought in honour he
ought to make a Vi<U+017F>it to <hi>Imoinda,</hi> the Daughter
of his Fo<U+017F>ter-father the dead General; and to
make <U+017F>ome Excu<U+017F>es to her, becau<U+017F>e his Pre<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
was the occa<U+017F>ion of her Father's Death;
and to pre<U+017F>ent her with tho<U+017F>e Slaves that had
been taken in this la<U+017F>t Battle, as the Trophies
of her Father's Victories. When he came, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by all the young Soldiers of any Merit,
he was infinitely <U+017F>urpriz'd at the Beauty of this
fair Queen of Night, who<U+017F>e Face and Per<U+017F>on
was to exceeding all he had ever beheld, that
lovely Mode<U+017F>ty with which <U+017F>he receiv'd him,
that Softne<U+017F>s in her Look, and Sighs, upon the
melancholy Occa<U+017F>ion of this Honour that was
done by <U+017F>o great a Man as <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> and a

while he <U+017F>tay'd gain'd a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t
over his fierce Heart, and made him
feel, the Victor cou'd be <U+017F>ubdu'd. So that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made his fir<U+017F>t Complements, and pre<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her an Hundred and fifty Slaves in Fetters,
he told her with his Eyes, that he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47213:42"/>
of her Charms; while <hi>Imoinda,</hi> who
wi<U+017F>h'd for nothing more than <U+017F>o glorious a
Conque<U+017F>t, was pleas'd to believe, <U+017F>he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood
that <U+017F>ilent Language of new-born Love;
and, from that moment, put on all her addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Beauty.</p>
                  <p>The Prince return'd to Court with quite
another Humour than before; and though he
did not <U+017F>peak much of the fair <hi>Imoinda,</hi> he had
the plea<U+017F>ure to hear all his Followers <U+017F>peak of
nothing but the Charms of that Maid, in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that, even in the pre<U+017F>ence of the old King,
they were extolling her, and heightning, if po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible,
the Beauties they had found in her: <U+017F>o
that nothing el<U+017F>e was talk'd of, no other <U+017F>ound
was heard in every corner where there were
Whi<U+017F>perers, but <hi>Imoinda! Imoinda!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twill be imagin'd <hi>Oroonoko</hi> <U+017F>tay'd not long
before he made his <U+017F>econd Vi<U+017F>it; nor, con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
his Quality, not much longer before he
told her, he ador'd her. I have often heard
him <U+017F>ay, that he admir'd by what <U+017F>trange In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>piration
he came to talk things <U+017F>o <U+017F>oft, and <U+017F>o
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate, who never knew Love, nor was us'd
to the Conver<U+017F>ation of Women; but (to u<U+017F>e
his own words) he <U+017F>aid; Mo<U+017F>t happily, <U+017F>ome
new, and, till then, unknown Power in<U+017F>tructed
his Heart and Tongue in the Language of Love,
and at the <U+017F>ame time, in favour of him, in<U+017F>pir'd
<hi>Imoinda</hi> with a <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. She was
touch'd with what he <U+017F>aid, and return'd it all
in <U+017F>uch An<U+017F>wers as went to his very Heart,
with a Plea<U+017F>ure unknown before. Nor did he
u<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e Obligations ill, that Love had done
him, but turn'd all his happy moments to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47213:43"/>
be<U+017F>t advantage; and as he knew no Vice, his
Flame aim'd at nothing but Honour, if <U+017F>uch a
di<U+017F>tinction may be made in Love; and e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in that Country, where Men take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
a many as they can maintain; and where
the only Crime and Sin with Woman, is, to turn
her off, to abandon her to Want, Shame and
Mi<U+017F>ery: <U+017F>uch ill Morals are only practis'd in
<hi>Chri<U+017F>tian</hi> Countries, where they preferr the bare
Name of Religion; and, without Vertue or
Morality, think that <U+017F>ufficient. But <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was
none of tho<U+017F>e Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors; but as he had right
Notions of Honour, <U+017F>o he made her <U+017F>uch Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itions
as were not only and barely <U+017F>uch; but,
contrary to the cu<U+017F>tom of his Countrey, he
made her Vows, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd be the only Woman
he wou'd po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s while he liv'd; that no Age or
Wrinkles <U+017F>hou'd encline him to change; for her
Soul wou'd be always fine, and always young;
and he <U+017F>hould have an eternal <hi>Idea</hi> in his Mind
of the Charms <U+017F>he now bore; and <U+017F>hou'd look
into his Heart for that <hi>Idea,</hi> when he cou'd find
it no longer in her Face.</p>
                  <p>After a thou<U+017F>and A<U+017F><U+017F>urances of his la<U+017F>ting
Flame, and her eternal Empire over him, <U+017F>he
conde<U+017F>cended to receive him for her Husband;
or rather, receiv'd him, as the greate<U+017F>t Honour
the Gods cou'd do her.</p>
                  <p>There is a certain Ceremony in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es to
be ob<U+017F>erv'd, which I forgot to ask him how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
but 'twas concluded on both <U+017F>ides, that
in obedience to him, the Grand-father was to
be fir<U+017F>t made acquainted with the De<U+017F>ign: For
they pay a mo<U+017F>t ab<U+017F>olute Re<U+017F>ignation to the
Monarch, e<U+017F>pecially when he is a Parent al<U+017F>o.</p>

                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:47213:43"/>
On the other <U+017F>ide, the old King, who had
many Wives, and many Concubines, wanted
not Court-Flatterers to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inuate into his Heart
a thou<U+017F>and tender Thoughts for this young
Beauty; and who repre<U+017F>ented her to his Fancy,
as the mo<U+017F>t charming he had ever po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd in
all the long race of his numerous Years. At
this Character, his old Heart, like an extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>ht
Brand, mo<U+017F>t apt to take Fire, felt new
Sparks of Love, and began to kindle; and now
grown to his <U+017F>econd Childhood, long'd with
impatience to behold this gay thing<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> with
whom, alas! he could but innocently play.
But how he <U+017F>hou'd be confirm'd <U+017F>he was this
<hi>Wonder,</hi> before he us'd his Power to call her to
Court, (where Maidens never came, unle<U+017F>s for
the King's private U<U+017F>e) he was next to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider;
and while he was <U+017F>o doing, he had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
brought him, that <hi>Imoinda</hi> was mo<U+017F>t
certainly Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s to the Prince <hi>Oroonoko.</hi> This
gave him <U+017F>ome <hi>Shagrien;</hi> however, it gave him
al<U+017F>o an opportunity, one day, when the Prince
was a-hunting, to wait on a Man of Quality,
as his Slave and Attendant, who <U+017F>hou'd go and
make a Pre<U+017F>ent to <hi>Imoinda,</hi> as from the Prince;
he <U+017F>hou'd then, unknown, <U+017F>ee this fair Maid,
and have an opportunity to hear what Me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
<U+017F>he wou'd return the Prince for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent;
and from thence gather the <U+017F>tate of her
Heart, and degree of her Inclination. This
was put in execution, and the old Monarch
<U+017F>aw, and burnt: He found her all he had
heard, and wou'd not delay his Happine<U+017F>s, but
found he <U+017F>hou'd have <U+017F>ome Ob<U+017F>tacle to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
her Heart; for <U+017F>he expre<U+017F>s'd her <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47213:44"/>
the Pre<U+017F>ent the Prince had <U+017F>ent her, in terms
<U+017F>o <U+017F>weet, <U+017F>o <U+017F>oft and pretty, with an Air of
Love and Joy that cou'd not be di<U+017F><U+017F>embl'd, in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that 'twas pa<U+017F>t doubt whether <U+017F>he lov'd
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> entirely. This gave the old King <U+017F>ome
affliction; but he <U+017F>alv'd it with this, that the
Obedience the People pay their King, was not
at all inferior to what they paid their Gods;
and what Love wou'd not oblige <hi>Imoinda</hi> to do,
Duty wou'd compell her to.</p>
                  <p>He was therefore no <U+017F>ooner got to his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but he <U+017F>ent the Royal Veil to <hi>Imoinda;</hi>
that is, the Ceremony of Invitation: He <U+017F>ends
the Lady he has a mind to honour with his
Bed, a Veil, with which <U+017F>he is cover'd, and
<U+017F>ecur'd for the King's U<U+017F>e; and 'tis Death to
di<U+017F>obey; be<U+017F>ides, held a mo<U+017F>t impious Di<U+017F>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not to be imagin'd the Surprize and
Grief that <U+017F>eiz'd this lovely Maid at this News
and Sight. However, as Delays in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es
are dangerous, and Pleading wor<U+017F>e than Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on;
trembling, and almo<U+017F>t fainting, <U+017F>he was
oblig'd to <U+017F>uffer her <U+017F>elf to be cover'd, and led
away.</p>
                  <p>They brought her thus to Court; and the
King, who had caus'd a very rich Bath to be
prepar'd, was led into it, where he <U+017F>ate under
a Canopy, in State, to receive this long'd-for
Virgin; whom he having commanded <U+017F>hou'd
be brought to him, they (after di<U+017F>-robing her)
led her to the Bath, and making fa<U+017F>t the Doors,
left her to de<U+017F>cend. The King, without more
Court<U+017F>hip, bad her throw off her Mantle, and
come to his Arms. But <hi>Imoinda,</hi> all in Tears,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47213:44"/>
threw her <U+017F>elf on the Marble, on the brink of
the Bath, and be<U+017F>ought him to hear her. She
told him, as <U+017F>he was a Maid, how proud of
the Divine Glory <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have been, of
having it in her power to oblige her King:
but as by the Laws, he cou'd not; and
from his Royal Goodne<U+017F>s, wou'd not take
from any Man his wedded Wife: <U+017F>o <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd be the Occa<U+017F>ion of making
him commit a great Sin, if <U+017F>he did not reveal
her State and Condition; and tell him, <U+017F>he
was another's, and cou'd not be <U+017F>o happy to
be his.</p>
                  <p>The King, enrag'd at this Delay, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tily
demanded the Name of the bold Man,
that had marry'd a Woman of her Degree,
without his Con<U+017F>ent. <hi>Imoinda,</hi> <U+017F>eeing his Eyes
fierce, and his Hands tremble, (whether with
Age or Anger, I know not, but <U+017F>he fan<U+017F>y'd the
la<U+017F>t,) almo<U+017F>t repented <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o much,
for now <U+017F>he fear'd the <U+017F>torm wou'd fall on the
Prince; <U+017F>he therefore <U+017F>aid a thou<U+017F>and things
to appea<U+017F>e the raging of his Flame, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
him to hear who it was with calmne<U+017F>s;
but before <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke, he imagin'd who <U+017F>he
meant, but wou'd not <U+017F>eem to do <U+017F>o, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her to lay a<U+017F>ide her Mantle, and <U+017F>uffer
her <U+017F>elf to receive his Care<U+017F><U+017F>es, or, by his Gods
he <U+017F>wore, that happy Man whom <U+017F>he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to name <U+017F>hou'd die, though it were even
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> him<U+017F>elf: <hi>Therefore</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) <hi>deny this
Marriage, and <U+017F>wear thy <U+017F>elf a Maid. That</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Imoinda) by all our Powers I do; for I am
not yet known to my Husband. 'Tis enough</hi> (<U+017F>aid
the King;) <hi>'tis enough both to <U+017F>atisfie my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cience,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47213:45"/>
and my Heart.</hi> And ri<U+017F>ing from his
Seat, he went and led her into the Bath; it
being in vain for her to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t.</p>
                  <p>In this time, the Prince, who was return'd
from Hunting, went to vi<U+017F>it his <hi>Imoinda,</hi> but
found her gone; and not only <U+017F>o, but heard
<U+017F>he had receiv'd the Royal Veil. This rais'd
him to a <U+017F>torm; and in his madne<U+017F>s, they had
much ado to <U+017F>ave him from laying violent
Hands on him<U+017F>elf. Force fir<U+017F>t prevail'd, and
then Rea<U+017F>on: They urg'd all to him, that
might oppo<U+017F>e his Rage; but nothing weigh'd
<U+017F>o greatly with him as the King's Old Age un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of injuring him with <hi>Imoinda.</hi> He
wou'd give way to that Hope, becau<U+017F>e it pleas'd
him mo<U+017F>t, and flatter'd be<U+017F>t his Heart. Yet this
<U+017F>erv'd not altogether to make him cea<U+017F>e his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which <U+017F>ometimes rag'd within
him, and <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>oftned into Showers.
'Twas not enough to appea<U+017F>e him, to tell him,
his Grand-father was old<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and cou'd not that
way injure him, while he retain'd that awful
Duty which the Young Men are us'd there to
pay to their grave Relations. He cou'd not be
convinc'd he had no cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>igh and mourn
for the lo<U+017F>s of a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, he cou'd not with
all his <U+017F>trength and courage retrieve. And
he wou'd often cry, <hi>Oh, my Friends! were <U+017F>he
in wall'd Cities, or confin'd from me in Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>trength; did Inchantments or
Mon<U+017F>ters detain her from me; I wou'd venture
through any Hazard to free her: But here, in the
Arms of a feeble Old Man, my Youth, my violent
Love, my Trade in Arms, and all my va<U+017F>t De<U+017F>ire
of Glory, avail me nothing:</hi> Imoinda <hi>is as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47213:45"/>
lo<U+017F>t to me, as if <U+017F>he were <U+017F>natcht by the
cold Arms of Death: Oh! <U+017F>he is never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd.
If I wou'd wait tedious Years, till Fate
<U+017F>hou'd bow the old King to his Grave; even that
wou'd not leave me</hi> Imoinda <hi>free; but <U+017F>till that
Cu<U+017F>tom that makes it <U+017F>o vile a Crime for a Son to
marry his Father's Wives or Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, wou'd hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Happine<U+017F>s; unle<U+017F>s I wou'd either ignobly <U+017F>et
an ill Pre<U+017F>ident to my Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ors, or abandon my
Countrey, and fly with her to <U+017F>ome unknown World
who never heard our Story.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it was objected to him, That his ca<U+017F>e was
not the <U+017F>ame; for <hi>Imoinda</hi> being his lawful
Wife by <U+017F>olemn Contract, 'twas he was the
injur'd Man, and might, if he <U+017F>o pleas'd, take
<hi>Imoinda</hi> back, the breach of the Law being on
his Grand-Father's <U+017F>ide; and that if he cou'd
circumvent him, and redeem her from the <hi>Otan,</hi>
which is the Palace of the King's Women, a
<U+017F>ort of <hi>Seraglio,</hi> it was both ju<U+017F>t and lawful for
him <U+017F>o to do.</p>
                  <p>This Rea<U+017F>oning had <U+017F>ome force upon him,
and he <U+017F>hou'd have been entirely comforted,
but for the thought that <U+017F>he was po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd by
his Grand-father. However, he lov'd <U+017F>o well,
that he was re<U+017F>olv'd to believe what mo<U+017F>t fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
his Hope; and to endeavour to learn
from <hi>Imoinda's</hi> own Mouth, what only <U+017F>he
cou'd <U+017F>atisfie him in; whether <U+017F>he was robb'd
of that Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing which was only due to his
Faith and Love. But as it was very hard to
get a <U+017F>ight of the Women, (for no Men ever
enter'd into the <hi>Otan,</hi> but when the King went
to entertain him<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>ome one of his Wives
or Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es; and 'twas Death, at any other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47213:46"/>
time for any other to go in;) <U+017F>o he knew not
how to contrive to get a <U+017F>ight of her.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Oroonoko</hi> felt all the Agonies of Love,
and <U+017F>uffer'd under a Torment the mo<U+017F>t painful
in the world, the old King was not exempted
from his <U+017F>hare of Affliction. He was troubled,
for having been forc'd, by an irre<U+017F>i<U+017F>tible Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
to rob his Son of a Trea<U+017F>ure, he knew, cou'd
not but be extremely dear to him, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he
was the mo<U+017F>t beautiful that ever had been <U+017F>een;
and had be<U+017F>ides, all the Sweetne<U+017F>s and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of Youth and Mode<U+017F>ty, with a Charm
of Wit <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ing all. He found that, however,
<U+017F>he was forc'd to expo<U+017F>e her lovely Per<U+017F>on to
his wither'd Arms, <U+017F>he cou'd only <U+017F>igh and
weep there, and think of <hi>Oroonoko;</hi> and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
cou'd not for bear <U+017F>peaking of him, though
her Life were, by Cu<U+017F>tom, forfeited by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. But <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke not of a Lover
only, but of a Prince dear to him, to whom
<U+017F>he <U+017F>poke; and of the Prai<U+017F>es of a Man, who,
till now, fill'd the old Man's Soul with Joy at
every recital of his Bravery, or even his Name.
And 'twas this Dotage on our young Hero, that
gave <hi>Imoinda</hi> a thou<U+017F>and Privileges to <U+017F>peak of
him, without offending; and this Conde<U+017F>cention
in the old King, that made her take the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of <U+017F>peaking of him <U+017F>o very often.</p>
                  <p>Be<U+017F>ides, he many times enquir'd how the
Prince bore him<U+017F>elf: And tho<U+017F>e of whom he
ask'd, being entirely Slaves to the Merits and
Vertues of the Prince, <U+017F>till an<U+017F>wer'd what they
thought conduc'd be<U+017F>t to his Service; which was,
to make the old King fan<U+017F>ie that the Prince had
no more Intere<U+017F>t in <hi>Imoinda,</hi> and had re<U+017F>ign'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:46"/>
her willingly to the Plea<U+017F>ure of the King;
that he diverted him<U+017F>elf with his Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,
his Fortifications, his Officers, and his
Hunting.</p>
                  <p>This pleas'd the old Lover, who fail'd not to
report the<U+017F>e things again to <hi>Imoinda,</hi> that <U+017F>he
might, by the Example of her young Lover,
withdraw her Heart, and re<U+017F>t better contented
in his Arms. But however, <U+017F>he was forc'd to
receive this unwelcome News, in all appearance,
with Unconcern and Content; her Heart was
bur<U+017F>ting within, and <U+017F>he was only happy when
<U+017F>he cou'd get alone, to vent her Griefs and Moans
with Sighs and Tears.</p>
                  <p>What Reports of the Prince's Conduct were
made to the King, he thought good to ju<U+017F>tifie
as far as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he cou'd by his Actions; and
when he appear'd in the Pre<U+017F>ence of the King,
he <U+017F>hew'd a Face not at all betraying his Heart:
<U+017F>o that in a little time, the old Man, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
convinc'd that he was no longer a Lover
of <hi>Imoindae,</hi> he carry'd him with him, in his
Train, to the <hi>Otan,</hi> often to banquet with his
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. But as <U+017F>oon as he enter'd, one day,
into the Apartment of <hi>Imoinda,</hi> with the King,
at the fir<U+017F>t Glance from her Eyes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
all his determined Re<U+017F>olution, he was
ready to <U+017F>ink in the place where he <U+017F>tood; and
had certainly done <U+017F>o, but for the <U+017F>upport of
<hi>Aboan,</hi> a young Man who was next to him;
which, with his Change of Countenance, had
betray'd him, had the King chanc'd to look
that way. And I have ob<U+017F>erv'd, 'tis a very
great error in tho<U+017F>e who laugh when one
<U+017F>ays, <hi>A</hi> Negro <hi>can change Colour:</hi> for I have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:47"/>
<U+017F>een 'em as frequently blu<U+017F>h, and look pale,
and that as vi<U+017F>ibly as ever I <U+017F>aw in the mo<U+017F>t
beautiful <hi>White.</hi> And 'tis certain, that both the<U+017F>e
Changes were evident, this day, in both the<U+017F>e
Lovers. And <hi>Imoinda,</hi> who <U+017F>aw with <U+017F>ome
Joy the Change in the Prince's Face, and found
it in her own, <U+017F>trove to divert the King from
beholding either, by a forc'd Care<U+017F>s, with which
<U+017F>he met him; which was a new Wound in the
Heart of the poor dying Prince. But as <U+017F>oon
as the King was bu<U+017F>y'd in looking on <U+017F>ome fine
thing of <hi>Imoinda</hi>'s making, <U+017F>he had time to tell
the Prince, with her angry but Love-darting
Eyes, that <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ented his Coldne<U+017F>s, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan'd
her own mi<U+017F>erable Captivity. Nor
were his Eyes <U+017F>ilent, but an<U+017F>wer'd hers again,
as much as Eyes cou'd do, in<U+017F>tructed by the
mo<U+017F>t tender and mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Heart that
ever lov'd: And they <U+017F>poke <U+017F>o well, and <U+017F>o
effectually, as <hi>Imoinda</hi> no longer doubted but
<U+017F>he was the only Delight and Darling of that
Soul <U+017F>he found pleading in 'em its Right of
Love, which none was more willing to re<U+017F>ign
than <U+017F>he. And 'twas this powerful Language
alone that in an in<U+017F>tant convey'd all the
Thoughts of their Souls to each other; that
they both found there wanted but Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to make them both entirely happy. But
when he <U+017F>aw another Door open'd by <hi>Onah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l</hi>
(a former old Wife of the Kings, who now had
Charge of <hi>Imoinda,</hi>) and <U+017F>aw the Pro<U+017F>pect of
a Bed of State made ready, with Sweets and
Flowers for the Dalliance of the King, who
immediately led the trembling Victim from his
<U+017F>ight, into that prepar'd Repo<U+017F>e; what Rage!
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47213:47"/>
what wild Frenzies <U+017F>eiz'd his Heart! which
forcing to keep within bounds, and to <U+017F>uffer
without noi<U+017F>e, it became the more in<U+017F>uppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and rent his Soul with ten thou<U+017F>and pains.
He was forc'd to retire, to vent his Groans,
where he fell down on a Carpet, and lay <U+017F>trug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
a long time, and only breathing now and
then,—Oh, <hi>Imoinda!</hi> When <hi>Onahal</hi> had fini<U+017F>ht
her nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Affair within, <U+017F>hutting the Door,
<U+017F>he came forth, to wait till the King call'd; and
hearing <U+017F>ome one <U+017F>ighing in the other Room,
<U+017F>he pa<U+017F>t on, and found the Prince in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Condition, which <U+017F>he thought needed
her Aid. She gave him Cordials, but all in
vain; till finding the nature of his Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, by
his Sighs, and naming <hi>Imoinda;</hi> <U+017F>he told him,
he had not <U+017F>o much cau<U+017F>e as he imagin'd to afflict
him<U+017F>elf; for if he knew the King <U+017F>o well as
<U+017F>he did, he wou'd not lo<U+017F>e a moment in Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie,
and that <U+017F>he was confident that <hi>Imoinda</hi>
bore, at this minute, part in his Affliction.
<hi>Aboan</hi> was of the <U+017F>ame opinion; and both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
per<U+017F>uaded him to re-a<U+017F><U+017F>ume his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
and all <U+017F>itting down on the Carpet, the
Prince <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o many obliging things to <hi>Onahal,</hi>
that he half-per<U+017F>uaded her to be of his Party.
And <U+017F>he promis'd him, <U+017F>he wou'd thus far com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with his ju<U+017F>t De<U+017F>ires, that <U+017F>he wou'd let
<hi>Imoinda</hi> know how faithful he was, what he
<U+017F>uffer'd, and what he <U+017F>aid.</p>
                  <p>This Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e la<U+017F>ted till the King call'd;
which gave <hi>Oroonoko</hi> a certain Satisfaction; and
with the Hope <hi>Onahal</hi> had made him conceive,
he a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd a Look as gay as 'twas po<U+017F><U+017F>ible a
Man in his circum<U+017F>tances cou'd do; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47213:48"/>
after, he was call'd in with the re<U+017F>t who
waited without. The King commanded Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick
to be brought, and <U+017F>everal of his young
Wives and Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es came all together by his
Command, to dance before him: where <hi>Imoinda</hi>
perform'd her part with an Air and Grace <U+017F>o
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing all the re<U+017F>t, as her Beauty was above
'em; and receiv'd the Pre<U+017F>ent ordain'd as a
Prize. The Prince was every moment more
charm'd with the new Beauties and Graces he
beheld in this <hi>Fair One:</hi> And while he gaz'd,
and <U+017F>he danc'd, <hi>Onahal</hi> was retir'd to a Window
with <hi>Aboan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Onahal,</hi> as I <U+017F>aid, was one of the Ca<U+017F>t-Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es
of the old King; and 'twas the<U+017F>e
(now pa<U+017F>t their Beauty) that were made Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
or Governantee's to the new and the
young ones; and who<U+017F>e Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s it was, to
teach them all tho<U+017F>e wanton Arts of Love, with
which they prevail'd and charm'd heretofore
in their Turn; and who now treated the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
happy Ones with all the Severity, as
to Liberty and Freedom, that was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, in
revenge of their Honours they rob them of;
envying them tho<U+017F>e Satisfactions, tho<U+017F>e Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries
and Pre<U+017F>ents, that were once made
to them<U+017F>elves, while Youth and Beauty la<U+017F>ted,
and which they now <U+017F>aw pa<U+017F>s, as it were, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
by, and paid only to the Bloomings. And
certainly, nothing is more afflicting to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd
Beauty, than to behold in it <U+017F>elf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
Charms, that were once ador'd; and
to find tho<U+017F>e Care<U+017F><U+017F>es paid to new Beauties, to
which once <U+017F>he laid a claim; to hear 'em
whi<U+017F>per, as <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><U+017F>es by, <hi>That once was a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

endeavour to revenge all the De<U+017F>pights,
and Decays of Time, on the<U+017F>e flouri<U+017F>hing
happy Ones. And 'twas this Severity, that
gave <hi>Oroonoko</hi> a thou<U+017F>and fears he <U+017F>hould never
prevail with <hi>Onahal</hi> to <U+017F>ee <hi>Imoinda.</hi> But, as
I <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he was now retir'd to a Window with
<hi>Aboan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Young Man was not only one of the
be<U+017F>t Quality, but a Man extremely well made,
and beautiful; and coming often to attend the
King to the <hi>Otan,</hi> he had <U+017F>ubdu'd the Heart
of the antiquated <hi>Onahal,</hi> which had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
how plea<U+017F>ant it was to be in Love: And
though <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome Decays in her Face, <U+017F>he
had none in her Sence and Wit; <U+017F>he was there
agreeable <U+017F>till, even to <hi>Aboan</hi>'s Youth: <U+017F>o that
he took plea<U+017F>ure in entertaining her with Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es
of Love. He knew al<U+017F>o, that to make
his Court to the<U+017F>e She-Favourites, was the
way to be great; the<U+017F>e being the Per<U+017F>ons that
do all Affairs and Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s at Court. He had
al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erv'd that <U+017F>he had given him Glances
more tender and inviting than <U+017F>he had done
to others of his Quality. And now, when he
<U+017F>aw that her Favour cou'd <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olutely oblige
the Prince, he fail'd not to <U+017F>igh in her Ear, and
to look with Eyes all <U+017F>oft upon her, and give
her Hope that <U+017F>he had made <U+017F>ome Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
on his Heart. He found her pleas'd at this,
and making a thou<U+017F>and advances to him: but
the Ceremony ending, and the King departing,
broke up the Company for that Day, and his
Conver<U+017F>ation.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Aboan</hi> fail'd not that night to tell the Prince
of his Succe<U+017F>s, and how advantageous the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Onahal</hi> might be to his Amour with
<hi>Imoinda.</hi> The Prince was over-joy'd with this
good News, and be<U+017F>ought him, if it were po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible,
to care<U+017F>s her <U+017F>o, as to engage her entirely;
which he cou'd not fail to do, if he comply'd
with her De<U+017F>ires: <hi>For then</hi> (<U+017F>aid the Prince)
<hi>her Life lying at your Mercy, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t grant you
the Reque<U+017F>t you make in my behalf. Aboan</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood
him, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him he would make love
<U+017F>o effectually, that he would defie the mo<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of the Art, to find out whether he
di<U+017F><U+017F>embl'd it, or had it really. And 'twas with
impatience they waited the next Opportunity of
going to the <hi>Otan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Wars came on; the Time of taking the
Field approach'd, and 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for the
Prince to delay his going at the Head of his
Army, to encounter the Enemy: <U+017F>o that every
Day <U+017F>eem'd a tedious Year, till he <U+017F>aw his <hi>Imoinda;</hi>
for he believ'd he cou'd not live, if he were forc'd

therefore that he expected the next Vi<U+017F>it
the King wou'd make; and, according to his
wi<U+017F>h, it was not long.</p>
                  <p>The Parley of the Eyes of the<U+017F>e two Lovers
had not pa<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly, but an old jealous
Lover could <U+017F>py it; or rather, he wanted not
Flatterers, who told him, they ob<U+017F>erv'd it:
<U+017F>o that the Prince was ha<U+017F>ten'd to the Camp,
and this was the la<U+017F>t Vi<U+017F>it he found he <U+017F>hou'd

No, <hi>Aboan;</hi> I have <U+017F>till a Rest of Beauty enough
engaging, and have learn'd to plea<U+017F>e too well, not
to be de<U+017F>irable: I can have Lovers <U+017F>till, but will
have none but <hi>Aboan.</hi> Madam, (<hi>reply'd the

'tis in pity of me, you conde<U+017F>cend to this kind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion:
But, Madam, Words are us'd to be <U+017F>o
<U+017F>mall a part of our Country-Court<U+017F>hip, that 'tis
rare one can get <U+017F>o happy an Opportunity as to tell

for.</p>
                  <p>He <U+017F>poke this with <U+017F>uch a Tone, that <U+017F>he
hop'd it true, and cou'd not forbear believing

it; and being wholly tran<U+017F>ported with Joy,
for having <U+017F>ubdu'd the fine<U+017F>t of all the King's
Subjects to her De<U+017F>ires, <U+017F>he took from her Ears
two large Pearls, and commanded him to wear
'em in his. He wou'd have refus'd em, crying,
<hi>Madam, the<U+017F>e are not the Proofs of your Love
that I expect; 'tis Opportunity, 'tis a Lone-hour
only, that can make me happy:</hi> But forcing the
Pearls into his Hand, <U+017F>he whi<U+017F>per'd <U+017F>oftly to
him; <hi>Oh! Do not fear a Woman's Invention, when
Love <U+017F>ets her a-thinking.</hi> And pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing his Hand,
<U+017F>he cry'd, <hi>This Night you <U+017F>hall be happy: Come to
the Gate of the Orange-Grove, behind the</hi> Otan,
<hi>and I will be ready, about Mid-night, to receive
you.</hi> 'Twas thus agreed, and <U+017F>he left him,
that no notice might be taken of their <U+017F>peaking
together.</p>
                  <p>The Ladies were <U+017F>till dancing; and the King
laid on a Carpet, with a great deal of plea<U+017F>ure

had brought her, of the con<U+017F>tant Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion the
Prince had for her. The Prince was laid on
another Carpet, at the other end of the Room,
with his Eyes fix'd on the Object of his Soul;
and as <U+017F>he turn'd or mov'd, <U+017F>o did they; and
<U+017F>he alone gave his Eyes and Soul their Motions.
Nor did <hi>Imoinda</hi> employ her Eyes to any other

the Joy <U+017F>he produc'd in tho<U+017F>e of the Prince.
But while <U+017F>he was more regarding Him, than

as <U+017F>he fell: And 'twas vi<U+017F>ible to the whole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence,
the Joy wherewith he receiv'd her; he
cla<U+017F>p'd her clo<U+017F>e to his Bo<U+017F>om, and quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
that Reverence that was due to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
of a King, and that Puni<U+017F>hment that is
the Reward of a Boldne<U+017F>s of this nature; and
had not the Pre<U+017F>ence of Mind of <hi>Imoinda</hi> (fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his <U+017F>afety, than her own) befriended
him, in making her <U+017F>pring from his Arms, and
fall into her Dance again, he had, at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant,
met his Death; for the old King, jealous
to the la<U+017F>t degree, ro<U+017F>e up in Rage, broke all
the Diver<U+017F>ion, and led <hi>Imoinda</hi> to her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and <U+017F>ent out word to the Prince, to go
immediately to the Camp; and that if he were
found another Night in Court, he <U+017F>hou'd <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Death ordain'd for di<U+017F>obedient Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
                  <p>You may imagine how welcome this News
was to <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> who<U+017F>e un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable Tran<U+017F>port
and Care<U+017F>s of <hi>Imoinda</hi> was blam'd by all Men
that lov'd him; and now he perceiv'd his fault,
yet cry'd, <hi>That for <U+017F>uch another Moment, he wou'd
be content to die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Otan</hi> was in di<U+017F>order about this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident;
and <hi>Onahal</hi> was particularly concern'd,
becau<U+017F>e on the Prince's Stay depended her
Happine<U+017F>s; for <U+017F>he cou'd no longer expect
that of <hi>Aboan.</hi> So that, e're they departed,
they contriv'd it <U+017F>o, that the Prince and he
<U+017F>hou'd come both that Night to the Grove of
the <hi>Otan,</hi> which was all of Oranges and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
and that there they wou'd wait her
Orders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47213:51"/>
They parted thus, with Grief enough, till
Night, leaving the King in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the
lovely Maid. But nothing could appea<U+017F>e the
Jealou<U+017F>ie of the old Lover; he wou'd not be
impos'd on, but wou'd have it, that <hi>Imoinda</hi>
made a fal<U+017F>e Step, on purpo<U+017F>e to fall into <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko</hi>'s
Bo<U+017F>om, and that all things look'd like a
De<U+017F>ign on both <U+017F>ides, and 'twas in vain <U+017F>he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>ted
her Innocence; he was old and ob<U+017F>tinate,
and left her more than half a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd that his Fear
was true.</p>
                  <p>The King going to his Apartment, <U+017F>ent to
know where the Prince was, and if he intended
to obey his Command. The Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and told him, he found the Prince pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive,
and altogether unprepared for the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign;
that he lay negligently on the ground,
and an<U+017F>wer'd very little. This confirm'd the
Jealou<U+017F>ie of the King, and he commanded that
they <U+017F>hou'd very narrowly and privately watch
his Motions; and that he <U+017F>hou'd not <U+017F>tir from
his Apartment, but one Spy or other <U+017F>hou'd be
employ'd to watch him. So that the hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
wherein he was to go to the Citron-Grove;
and taking only <hi>Aboan</hi> along with him,
he leaves his Apartment, and was watch'd to
the very Gate of the <hi>Otan;</hi> where he was <U+017F>een
to enter, and where they left him, to carry
back the Tidings to the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko</hi> and <hi>Aboan</hi> were no <U+017F>ooner enter'd,
but <hi>Onahal</hi> led the Prince to the Apartment of
<hi>Imoinda;</hi> who, not knowing any thing of her
Happine<U+017F>s, was laid in Bed. But <hi>Onahal</hi> only
left him in her Chamber, to make the be<U+017F>t of
his Opportunity, and took her dear <hi>Aboan</hi> to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47213:51"/>
her own; where he <U+017F>hew'd the height of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plai<U+017F>ance
for his Prince, when, to give him an
Opportunity, he <U+017F>uffer'd him<U+017F>elf to be care<U+017F>s'd
in Bed by <hi>Onahal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince <U+017F>oftly waken'd <hi>Imoinda,</hi> who was
not a little <U+017F>urpriz'd with Joy to find him there;
and yet <U+017F>he trembl'd with a thou<U+017F>and Fears.
I believe he omitted <U+017F>aying nothing to this
young Maid, that might per<U+017F>uade her to <U+017F>uffer
him to <U+017F>eize his own, and take the Rights of
Love; and I believe <U+017F>he was not long re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting
tho<U+017F>e Arms where <U+017F>he <U+017F>o long'd to be; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Opportunity, Night and Silence, Youth, Love
and De<U+017F>ire, he <U+017F>oon prevail'd, and ravi<U+017F>ht in a
Moment, what his old Grand-father had been
endeavouring for <U+017F>o many Months.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not to be imagin'd the Satisfaction of
the<U+017F>e two young Lovers; nor the Vows <U+017F>he
made him, that <U+017F>he remain'd a <U+017F>potle<U+017F>s Maid,
till that Night; and that what <U+017F>he did with his
Grand-father, had robb'd him of no part of
her Virgin-Honour, the Gods, in Mercy and
Ju<U+017F>tice, having re<U+017F>erv'd that for her plighted
Lord, to whom of Right it belong'd. And 'tis
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to expre<U+017F>s the Tran<U+017F>ports he <U+017F>uffer'd,
while he li<U+017F>ten'd to a Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>o charming
from her lov'd Lips; and cla<U+017F>p'd that Body in
his Arms, for whom he had <U+017F>o long langui<U+017F>ht;
and nothing now afflicted him, but his <U+017F>udden
Departure from her; for he told her the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity,
and his Commands; but <U+017F>hould depart
<U+017F>atisfy'd in this, That <U+017F>ince the old King had
hitherto not been able to deprive him of tho<U+017F>e
Enloyments which only belong'd to him, he
believ'd, for the future, he would be le<U+017F>s able to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47213:52"/>
injure him; <U+017F>o that, abating the Scandal of the
Veil, which was no otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>o, than that <U+017F>he
was Wife to another: He believ'd her <U+017F>afe, even
in the Arms of the King, and innocent; yet
wou'd he have ventur'd at the Conque<U+017F>t of the
World, and have given it all, to have had her
avoided that Honour of receiving the <hi>Royal Veil.</hi>
'Twas thus, between a thou<U+017F>and Care<U+017F><U+017F>es, that
both bemoan'd the hard fate of Youth and
Beauty, <U+017F>o liable to that cruel Promotion:
'Twas a Glory that cou'd well have been <U+017F>par'd
here, though de<U+017F>ir'd and aim'd at by all the
young Females of that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But while they were thus fondly employ'd,
forgetting how Time ran on, and that the
Dawn mu<U+017F>t conduct him far away from his
only Happine<U+017F>s, they heard a great Noi<U+017F>e in the
<hi>Otan,</hi> and unu<U+017F>ual Voices of Men; at which
the Prince, <U+017F>tarting from the Arms of the
frighted <hi>Imoinda,</hi> ran to a little Battle-Axe he
us'd to wear by his Side; and having not <U+017F>o

him<U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome who were already

much Violence, that <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was not able to
defend it; but was forc'd to cry out with a
commanding Voice, <hi>Whoever ye are that have
the Boldne<U+017F>s to attempt to approach this Apartment

thy Friends.</p>
                  <p>At the<U+017F>e words they departed, and left the
Prince to take a <U+017F>hort and <U+017F>ad leave of his
<hi>Imoinda;</hi> who tru<U+017F>ting in the <U+017F>trength of her
Charms, believ'd <U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd appea<U+017F>e the Fury
of a jealous King, by <U+017F>aying, She was <U+017F>urpriz'd,
and that it was by force of Arms he got into
her Apartment. All her Concern now was
for his Life, and therefore <U+017F>he ha<U+017F>ten'd him to
the Camp, and with much a-doe prevail'd on
him to go. Nor was it <U+017F>he alone that prevail'd;
<hi>Aboan</hi> and <hi>Onahal</hi> both pleaded, and both a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ur'd
him of a Lye that <U+017F>hou'd be well enough

with a Heart <U+017F>ad as Death, dying Eyes, and
<U+017F>ighing Soul, <hi>Oroonoko</hi> departed, and took his
way to the Camp.</p>
                  <p>It was not long after the King, in Per<U+017F>on, came
to the <hi>Otan;</hi> where beholding <hi>Imoinda,</hi> with
Rage in his Eyes, he upbraided her Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
and Perfidy; and threatning her Royal
Lover, <U+017F>he fell on her Face at his Feet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewing
the Floor with her Tears, and implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Pardon for a Fault which <U+017F>he had not
with her Will committed; as <hi>Onahal,</hi> who
was al<U+017F>o pro<U+017F>trate with her, cou'd te<U+017F>tifie:
That, unknown to her, he had broke into
her Apartment, and ravi<U+017F>h'd her. She <U+017F>poke
this much again<U+017F>t her Con<U+017F>cience; but to
<U+017F>ave her own Life, 'twas ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47213:53"/>
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd feign this Fal<U+017F>ity. She knew it
cou'd not injure the Prince, he being fled to
an Army that wou'd <U+017F>tand by him, again<U+017F>t
any Injuries that <U+017F>hou'd a<U+017F><U+017F>ault him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this la<U+017F>t Thought of <hi>Imoinda</hi>'s being Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>h'd,
chang'd the mea<U+017F>ures of his Revenge;
and whereas before he de<U+017F>ign'd to be him<U+017F>elf
her Executioner, he now re<U+017F>olv'd <U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd
not die. But as it is the greate<U+017F>t Crime in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
among<U+017F>t 'em, to touch a Woman after
having been po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd by a Son, a Father, or a
Brother; <U+017F>o now he look'd on <hi>Imoinda</hi> as a
polluted thing, wholly unfit for his Embrace:
nor wou'd he re<U+017F>ign her to his Grand-<U+017F>on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>he had receiv'd the <hi>Royal Veil.</hi> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<U+017F>hou'd be both <U+017F>old off, as Slaves, to another
Country, either <hi>Chri<U+017F>tian</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> 'twas no
matter where.</p>
                  <p>This cruel Sentence, wor<U+017F>e than Death, they
implor'd might be revers'd; but their Prayers
were vain, and it was put in execution accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,

none either without or within the <hi>Otan</hi>
knew any thing of their Ab<U+017F>ence, or their
De<U+017F>tiny.</p>
                  <p>The old King, neverthele<U+017F>s, executed this
with a great deal of Reluctancy; but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
he had made a very great Conque<U+017F>t over
him<U+017F>elf, when he had once re<U+017F>olv'd, and had

wou'd <U+017F>uffer a better Con<U+017F>equence from <U+017F>o ill a
Cau<U+017F>e. He now begins to hold <hi>Oroonoko</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd;
and to <U+017F>ay, he had Rea<U+017F>on for what he
did: And now every Body cou'd a<U+017F><U+017F>ure the
King how pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately <hi>Imoinda</hi> was belov'd
by the Prince; even tho<U+017F>e confe<U+017F>s'd it now,
who <U+017F>aid the contrary before his Flame was
abated. So that the King being old, and not
able to defend him<U+017F>elf in War, and having no
Sons of all his Race remaining alive, but only
this, to maintain him on his Throne; and
looking on this as a Man di<U+017F>oblig'd, fir<U+017F>t by
the Rape of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, or rather Wife, and
now by depriving of him wholly of her, he
fear'd, might make him de<U+017F>perate, and do <U+017F>ome
cruel thing, either to him<U+017F>elf or his old Grand-father
the Offender; he began to repent him
extremely of the Contempt he had, in his
Rage, put on <hi>Imoinda.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides, he con<U+017F>ider'd,
he ought in Honour to have kill'd her, for this
Offence, if it had been one: He ought to have
had <U+017F>o much Value and Con<U+017F>ideration for a
Maid of her Quality, as to have nobly put her
to Death; and not to have <U+017F>old her like a
common Slave, the greate<U+017F>t Revenge, and the
mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>graceful of any; and to which they a
thou<U+017F>and times preferr Death, and implore it;
as <hi>Imoinda</hi> did, but cou'd not obtain that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Seeing therefore it was certain, that
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> wou'd highly re<U+017F>ent this Affront, he
thought good to make <U+017F>ome Excu<U+017F>e for his
Ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s to him; and to that end, he <U+017F>ent a
Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger to the Camp, with Orders to treat
with him about the Matter, to gain his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and to endeavour to mitigate his Grief;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:54"/>
but that by no means he <U+017F>hou'd tell him <U+017F>he
was <U+017F>old, but <U+017F>ecretly put to death; for he
knew he <U+017F>hou'd never obtain his Pardon for
the other.</p>
                  <p>When the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger came, he found the
Prince upon the point of Engaging with the
Enemy; but as <U+017F>oon as he heard of the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, he commanded him to
his Tent, where he embrac'd him, and receiv'd
him with Joy; which was <U+017F>oon abated, by the
Down-ca<U+017F>t Looks of the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, who was
in<U+017F>tantly demanded the cau<U+017F>e by <hi>Oroonoko,</hi>
who, impatient of Delay, ask'd a thou<U+017F>and
Que<U+017F>tions in a breath; and all concerning <hi>Imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inda.</hi>
But there needed little Return; for he
cou'd almo<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer him<U+017F>elf of all he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from his Sighs and Eyes. At la<U+017F>t, the Me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>enger
ca<U+017F>ting him<U+017F>elf at the Prince's Feet, and
ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing them, with all the Submi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a Man
that had <U+017F>omething to implore which he dreaded
to utter, he be<U+017F>ought him to hear with Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
what he had to deliver to him, and to call
up all his Noble and Heroick Courage, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with his Words, and defend him<U+017F>elf
again<U+017F>t the ungrateful things he mu<U+017F>t relate.
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> reply'd, with a deep Sigh, and a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hing
Voice,—<hi>I am arm'd again<U+017F>t their wor<U+017F>t
Efforts—; for I know they will tell me,</hi> Imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inda
<hi>is no more—; and after that, you may <U+017F>pare
the rest.</hi> Then, commanding him to ri<U+017F>e, he
laid him<U+017F>elf on a Carpet, under a rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villion,
and remain'd a good while <U+017F>ilent, and
was hardly heard to <U+017F>igh. When he was come
a little to him<U+017F>elf, the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger ask'd him leave
to deliver that part of his Emba<U+017F><U+017F>y which the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47213:54"/>
Prince had not yet devin'd: And the Prince
cry'd, <hi>I permit thee.</hi>—Then he told him the
Affliction the old King was in, for the Ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s
he had committed, in his Cruelty to <hi>Imoinda;</hi>
and how he daign'd to ask Pardon for his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and to implore the Prince wou'd not
<U+017F>uffer that Lo<U+017F>s to touch his Heart too <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly,
which now all the Gods cou'd not re<U+017F>tore
him, but might recompen<U+017F>e him in Glory,
which he begg'd he wou'd pur<U+017F>ue; and that
Death, that common Revenger of all Injuries,
wou'd <U+017F>oon even the Account between him and
a feeble old Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko</hi> bad him return his Duty to his
Lord and Ma<U+017F>ter; and to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him, there
was no Account of Revenge to be adju<U+017F>ted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; if there were, 'twas he was the
Aggre<U+017F><U+017F>or, and that Death would be ju<U+017F>t, and,
maugre his Age, wou'd fee him righted; and
he was contented to leave his Share of Glory
to Youths more fortunate, and worthy of that
Favour from the Gods. That henceforth he
wou'd never lift a Weapon, or draw a Bow,
but abandon the <U+017F>mall remains of his Life to
Sighs and Tears, and the continual Thoughts of
what his Lord and Grand-father had thought
good to <U+017F>end out of the World, with all that
Youth, that Innocence and Beauty.</p>
                  <p>After having <U+017F>poken this, what-ever his
greate<U+017F>t Officers and Men of the be<U+017F>t Rank
cou'd do, they cou'd not rai<U+017F>e him from the
Carpet, or per<U+017F>uade him to Action, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olutions
of Life; but commanding all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
he <U+017F>hut him<U+017F>elf into his Pavillion all that
day, while the Enemy was ready to engage<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:47213:55"/>
and wondring at the Delay, the whole Body
of the chief of the Army then addre<U+017F>s'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
to him, and to whom they had much
a-doe to get Admittance. They fell on their
Faces at the Foot of his Carpet; where they
lay, and be<U+017F>ought him with earne<U+017F>t Prayers
and Tears, to lead'em forth to Battle, and not
let the Enemy take Advantages of them; and
implor'd him to have regard to his Glory, and
to the World, that depended on his Courage
and Conduct. But he made no other Reply to
all their Supplications, but this; That he had
now no more bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s for Glory; and for the
World, it was a Trifle not worth his Care:
<hi>Go</hi> (continu'd he, <U+017F>ighing) <hi>and divide it among<U+017F>t
you, and reap with Joy what you <U+017F>o vainly prize,
and leave me to my more welcome De<U+017F>tiny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They then demanded what they <U+017F>hou'd do,
and whom he wou'd con<U+017F>titute in his room,
that the Confu<U+017F>ion of ambitious Youth and
Power might not ruine their Order, and make
them a Prey to the Enemy. He reply'd; He
wou'd not give him<U+017F>elf the Trouble—; but
wi<U+017F>h'd 'em to chu<U+017F>e the brave<U+017F>t Man among<U+017F>t
'em, let his Quality or Birth be what it wou'd:
<hi>For, O my Friends!</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) <hi>it is not Titles
make Men Brave or Good; or Birth, that be<U+017F>tows
Courage and Genero<U+017F>ity, or makes the Owner Happy:
Believe this, when you behold</hi> Oroonoko, <hi>the most
wretched, and abandon'd by Fortune, of all the
Creation of the Gods.</hi> So turning him<U+017F>elf about,
he wou'd make no more Reply to all they cou'd
urge or implore.</p>
                  <p>The Army beholding their Officers return
un<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful, with <U+017F>ad Faces, and ominous
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47213:55"/>
Looks, that pre<U+017F>age'd no good Luck, <U+017F>uffer'd
a thou<U+017F>and Fears to take po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of their
Hearts, and the Enemy to come ev'n upon
'em, before they wou'd provide for their
Safety, by any Defence; and though they were
a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd by <U+017F>ome, who had a mind to animate
'em, that they <U+017F>hou'd be immediately Headed
by the Prince, and that in the mean time <hi>Aboan</hi>
had Orders to Command as General; yet
they were <U+017F>o di<U+017F>may'd for want of that great
Example of Bravery, that they cou'd make but
a very feeble Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and at la<U+017F>t, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
fled before the Enemy, who pur<U+017F>u'd 'em
to the very Tents, killing 'em: Nor cou'd all
<hi>Aboan</hi>'s Courage, which that day gain'd him
immortal Glory, <U+017F>hame 'em into a Manly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of them<U+017F>elves. The Guards that were
left behind about the Prince's Tent, <U+017F>eeing
the Soldiers flee before the Enemy, and <U+017F>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them<U+017F>elves all over the Plain, in great Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
made <U+017F>uch Out-cries as rouz'd the Prince
from his amorous Slumber, in which he had
remain'd bury'd for two Days, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
any Su<U+017F>tenance to approach him. But,
in <U+017F>pite of all his Re<U+017F>olutions, he had not the
con<U+017F>tancy of Grief to that degree, as to make
him in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the Danger of his Army; and
in that in<U+017F>tant he leap'd from his Couch, and
cry'd,—<hi>Come, if we must die, let us meet Death
the noble<U+017F>t way; and 'twill be more like</hi> Oroonoko
<hi>to encounter him at an Army's Head, oppo<U+017F>ing
the Torrent of a conquering Foe, than lazily, on
a Couch, to wait his lingering Plea<U+017F>ure, and die
every moment by a thou<U+017F>and racking Thoughts;
or be tamely taken by an Enemy, and led a whining<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>

Love-<U+017F>ick Slave, to adorn the Triumphs of</hi> Jamoan,
<hi>that young Victor, who already is enter'd beyond the
Limits I had pre<U+017F>crib'd him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While he was <U+017F>peaking, he <U+017F>uffer'd his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to dre<U+017F>s him for the Field; and <U+017F>allying
out of his Pavillion, with more Life and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
in his Countenance than ever he <U+017F>hew'd,
he appear'd like <U+017F>ome Divine Power de<U+017F>cended
to <U+017F>ave his Countrey from De<U+017F>truction; and his
People had purpo<U+017F>ely put him on all things
that might make him <U+017F>hine with mo<U+017F>t Splendor,
to <U+017F>trike a reverend Awe into the Beholders.
He flew into the thicke<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e that were
pur<U+017F>uing his Men; and being animated with
De<U+017F>pair, he fought as if he came on purpo<U+017F>e
to die, and did <U+017F>uch things as will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that Humane Strength cou'd perform;
and <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>oon in<U+017F>pir'd all the re<U+017F>t with new
Courage, and new Order: And now it was,
that they began to fight indeed; and <U+017F>o, as if
they wou'd not be out-done ev'n by their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
Hero; who turning the Tide of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
changing ab<U+017F>olutely the Fate of the Day,
gain'd an entire Conque<U+017F>t; and <hi>Oroonoko</hi> having
the good fortune to <U+017F>ingle out <hi>Jamoan,</hi> he took
him Pri<U+017F>oner with his own Hand, having woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him almo<U+017F>t to death.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Jamoan</hi> afterwards became very dear
to him, being a Man very gallant, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Graces, and fine Parts; <U+017F>o that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
put him among<U+017F>t the Rank of Captives, as
they us'd to do, without di<U+017F>tinction, for the
common Sale, or Market; but kept him in his
own Court, where he retain'd nothing of the
Pri<U+017F>oner but the Name, and return'd no more
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47213:56"/>
into his own Countrey, <U+017F>o great an Affection he
took for <hi>Oroonoko;</hi> and by a thou<U+017F>and Tales
and Adventures of Love and Gallantry, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
his Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of Melancholy and Langui<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which I have often heard him <U+017F>ay, had
certainly kill'd him, but for the Conver<U+017F>ation
of this Prince and <hi>Aboan,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Governor
he had from his Childhood, of whom I have
<U+017F>poken before, and who was a Man of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Wit, great Ingenuity and Learning; all
which he had infus'd into his young Pupil.
This <hi>French-man</hi> was bani<U+017F>ht out of his own
Countrey, for <U+017F>ome Heretical Notions he held;
and though he was a Man of very little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
he had admirable Morals, and a brave
Soul.</p>
                  <p>After the total Defeat of <hi>Jamoan</hi>'s Army,
which all fled, or were left dead upon the
Place, they <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome time in the Camp;
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> chu<U+017F>ing rather to remain a while there
in his Tents, than to enter into a Palace, or live
in a Court where he had <U+017F>o lately <U+017F>uffer'd <U+017F>o
great a Lo<U+017F>s. The Officers therefore, who <U+017F>aw
and knew his cau<U+017F>e of Di<U+017F>content, invented
all <U+017F>orts of Diver<U+017F>ions and Sports, to entertain
their Prince: So that what with tho<U+017F>e Amuze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
abroad, and others at home, that is,
within their Tents, with the Per<U+017F>ua<U+017F>ions, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Care of his Friends and Servants
that he more peculiarly priz'd, he wore off, in
time, a great part of that <hi>Shagrien,</hi> and Torture
of De<U+017F>pair, which the fir<U+017F>t Efforts of <hi>Imoinda</hi>'s
Death had given him: in<U+017F>omuch as having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a thou<U+017F>and kind Emba<U+017F><U+017F>ies from the King,
and Invitations to return to Court, he obey'd,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47213:57"/>
though with no little reluctancy; and when
he did <U+017F>o, there was a vi<U+017F>ible change in him,
and for a long time he was much more melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
than before. But Time le<U+017F><U+017F>ens all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
and reduces 'em to <hi>Medium's,</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern;
but no Motives or Beauties, though
all endeavour'd it, cou'd engage him in any <U+017F>ort
of Amour, though he had all the Invitations to
it, both from his own Youth, and others Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and De<U+017F>igns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner return'd from this
la<U+017F>t Conque<U+017F>t, and receiv'd at Court with all
the Joy and Magnificence that cou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s'd
to a young Victor, who was not only
return'd triumphant, but belov'd like a Deity,
when there arriv'd in the Port an <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi>
Ship.</p>
                  <p>This Per<U+017F>on had often before been in the<U+017F>e
Countries, and was very well known to <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko,</hi>
with whom he had traffick'd for Slaves,
and had us'd to do the <U+017F>ame with his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ors.</p>
                  <p>This Commander was a Man of a finer <U+017F>ort
of Addre<U+017F>s, and Conver<U+017F>ation, better bred, and
more engaging, than mo<U+017F>t of that <U+017F>ort of Men
are; <U+017F>o that he <U+017F>eem'd rather never to have
been bred out of a Court, than almo<U+017F>t all his
life at Sea. This Captain therefore was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
better receiv'd at Court, than mo<U+017F>t of the
Traders to tho<U+017F>e Countries were; and e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> who was more civiliz'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Europaean</hi> Mode, than any other
had been, and took more delight in the <hi>White</hi>
Nations; and, above all, Men of Parts and
Wit. To this Captain he <U+017F>old abundance of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47213:57"/>
his Slaves; and for the Favour and E<U+017F>teem he
had for him, made him many Pre<U+017F>ents, and
oblig'd him to <U+017F>tay at Court as long as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly
he cou'd. Which the Captain <U+017F>eem'd to take
as a very great Honour done him, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Prince every day with Globes and
Maps, and Mathematical Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es and In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
eating, drinking, hunting and living
with him with <U+017F>o much familiarity, that it
was not to be doubted but he had gain'd very
greatly upon the Heart of this gallant young
Man. And the Captain, in Return of all the<U+017F>e
mighty Favours, be<U+017F>ought the Prince to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
his Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el with his Pre<U+017F>ence, <U+017F>ome day or
other, to Dinner, before he <U+017F>hou'd <U+017F>et <U+017F>ail:
which he conde<U+017F>cended to accept, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
his day. The Captain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on his part,
fail'd not to have all things in a readine<U+017F>s, in
the mo<U+017F>t magnificent order he cou'd po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly:
And the day being come, the Captain, in his
Boat, richly adorn'd with Carpets and Velvet-Cu<U+017F>hions,
row'd to the <U+017F>hore, to receive the
Prince; with another Long-Boat, where was
plac'd all his Mu<U+017F>ick and Trumpets, with which
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> was extremely delighted; who met
him on the <U+017F>hore, attended by his <hi>French</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
<hi>Jamoan, Aboan,</hi> and about an hundred
of the noble<U+017F>t of the Youths of the Court: And
after they had fir<U+017F>t carry'd the Prince on board,
the Boats fetch'd the re<U+017F>t off: where they
found a very <U+017F>plendid Treat, with all <U+017F>orts of
fine Wines; and were as well entertain'd, as
'twas po<U+017F><U+017F>ible in <U+017F>uch a place to be.</p>
                  <p>The Prince having drank hard of Punch,
and <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of Wine, as did all the re<U+017F>t,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47213:58"/>
(for great care was taken, they <U+017F>hou'd want
nothing of that part of the Entertainment) was
very merry, and in great admiration of the
Ship, for he had never been in one before; <U+017F>o
that he was curious of beholding every place
where he decently might de<U+017F>cend. The re<U+017F>t,
no le<U+017F>s curious, who were not quite overcome
with Drinking, rambl'd at their plea<U+017F>ure <hi>Fore</hi>
and <hi>Aft,</hi> as their Fancies guided 'em: So that
the Captain, who had well laid his De<U+017F>ign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
gave the Word, and <U+017F>eiz'd on all his Gue<U+017F>ts;
they clapping great Irons <U+017F>uddenly on the Prince,
when he was leap'd down into the Hold, to
view that part of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el; and locking him
fa<U+017F>t down, <U+017F>ecur'd him. The <U+017F>ame Treachery
was us'd to all the re<U+017F>t; and all in one in<U+017F>tant,
in <U+017F>everal places of the Ship, were la<U+017F>h'd fa<U+017F>t in
Irons, and betray'd to Slavery. That great
De<U+017F>ign over, they <U+017F>et all Hands to work to
hoi<U+017F>e Sail; and with as treacherous and fair a
Wind they made from the Shore with this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and glorious Prize, who thought of nothing
le<U+017F>s than <U+017F>uch an Entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Some have commended this Act, as brave
in the Captain; but I will <U+017F>pare my <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of it,
and leave it to my Reader to judge as he
plea<U+017F>es. It may be ea<U+017F>ily gue<U+017F>s'd, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Prince re<U+017F>ented this Indignity, who
may be be<U+017F>t re<U+017F>embl'd to a Lion taken in a Toil;
<U+017F>o he rag'd, <U+017F>o he <U+017F>truggl'd for Liberty, but all
in vain; and they had <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>ely manag'd his
Fetters, that he cou'd not u<U+017F>e a Hand in his
defence, to quit him<U+017F>elf of a Life that wou'd
by no means endure Slavery; nor cou'd he
move from the place where he was ty'd, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47213:58"/>
any <U+017F>olid part of the Ship again<U+017F>t which he
might have beat his Head, and have fini<U+017F>h'd his
Di<U+017F>grace that way: So that being deprived of
all other means, he re<U+017F>olv'd to peri<U+017F>h for want
of Food; and pleas'd at la<U+017F>t with that Thought,
and toil'd and tir'd by Rage and Indignation,
he laid him<U+017F>elf down, and <U+017F>ullenly re<U+017F>olv'd
upon dying, and refu<U+017F>ed all things that were
brought him.</p>
                  <p>This did not a little vex the Captain, and
the more <U+017F>o, becau<U+017F>e he found almo<U+017F>t all of
'em of the <U+017F>ame Humour: <U+017F>o that the lo<U+017F>s of
<U+017F>o many brave Slaves, <U+017F>o tall and goodly to
behold, wou'd have been very con<U+017F>iderable:
He therefore order'd one to go from him (for
he wou'd not be <U+017F>een him<U+017F>elf) to <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> and
to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him, he was afflicted for having ra<U+017F>hly
done <U+017F>o unho<U+017F>pitable a Deed, and which cou'd
not be now remedy'd, <U+017F>ince they were far from
<U+017F>hore; but <U+017F>ince he re<U+017F>ented it in <U+017F>o high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him he wou'd revoke his Re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and <U+017F>et both him and his Friends a-<U+017F>hore
on the next Land they <U+017F>hou'd touch at; and of
this the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger gave him his Oath, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he would re<U+017F>olve to live: And <hi>Oroonoko,</hi>
who<U+017F>e Honour was <U+017F>uch as he never had viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Word in his Life him<U+017F>elf, much le<U+017F>s a <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
A<U+017F><U+017F>everation, believ'd in an in<U+017F>tant what
this Man <U+017F>aid; but reply'd, He expected, for
a confirmation of this, to have his <U+017F>hameful
Fetters di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s'd. This Demand was carried
to the Captain; who return'd him an<U+017F>wer, That
the Offence had been <U+017F>o great which he had put
upon the Prince, that he dur<U+017F>t not tru<U+017F>t him
with Liberty while he remain'd in the Ship,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47213:59"/>
for fear le<U+017F>t by a Valour natural to him, and a
Revenge that wou'd animate that Valour, he
might commit <U+017F>ome Outrage fatal to him<U+017F>elf,
and the <hi>King</hi> his Ma<U+017F>ter, to whom his Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el did
belong. To this <hi>Oroonoko</hi> reply'd; He would
engage his Honour to behave him<U+017F>elf in all
friendly Order and Manner, and obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the <hi>Captain,</hi> as he was Lord of the
<hi>King</hi>'s Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, and General of tho<U+017F>e Men under
his Command.</p>
                  <p>This was deliver'd to the <U+017F>till doubting <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
who could not re<U+017F>olve to tru<U+017F>t a <hi>Heathen,</hi>
he <U+017F>aid, upon his Parole, a Man that had no
Sen<U+017F>e or Notion of the God that he wor<U+017F>hipp'd.
<hi>Oroonoko</hi> then reply'd; He was very <U+017F>orry to
hear that the <hi>Captain</hi> pretended to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Wor<U+017F>hip of any <hi>Gods,</hi> who had
taught him no better Principles, than not to
Credit as he would be Credited. But they told
him, the Difference of their Faith occa<U+017F>ion'd
that Di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t: For the <hi>Captain</hi> had prote<U+017F>ted to
him upon the Word of a <hi>Chri<U+017F>tian,</hi> and <U+017F>worn in
the Name of a Great <hi>GOD;</hi> which if he
<U+017F>hou'd violate, he would expect eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the World to come. <hi>Is that all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
he has to be Ju<U+017F>t to his Oath?</hi> (replied <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roonoko.)
Let him know, I <U+017F>wear by my Honour;
which to violate, would not only render me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
and de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed by all brave and hone<U+017F>t Men,
and <U+017F>o give my <U+017F>elf perpetual pain, but it wou'd
be eternally offending and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing all Mankind;
harming, betraying, circumventing and outraging
all Men: but Puni<U+017F>hments hereafter are <U+017F>uffer'd
by one's <U+017F>elf; and the World takes no cognizances
whether this</hi> God <hi>have reveng'd 'em, or not, 'tis
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47213:59"/>
done <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly, and deferr'd <U+017F>o long: While the
Man of no Honour <U+017F>uffers every moment the <U+017F>corn
and contempt of the hone<U+017F>ter World, and dies every
day ignominiou<U+017F>ly in his Fame, which is more valuable
than Life: I <U+017F>peak not this to move Belief, but to
<U+017F>hew you how you mi<U+017F>take, when you imagine, That
he who will violate his Honour, will keep his Word
with his</hi> Gods. So, turning from him with a
di<U+017F>dainful <U+017F>mile, he refu<U+017F>ed to an<U+017F>wer him,
when he urg'd him to know what An<U+017F>wer he
<U+017F>hou'd carry back to his Captain; <U+017F>o that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
without <U+017F>aying any more.</p>
                  <p>The Captain pondering and con<U+017F>ulting what
to do, it was concluded that nothing but <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko</hi>'s
Liberty wou'd encourage any of the re<U+017F>t
to eat, except the <hi>French-man,</hi> whom the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
cou'd not pretend to keep Pri<U+017F>oner, but
only told him, he was <U+017F>ecured, becau<U+017F>e he might
act <U+017F>omething in favour of the Prince, but that
he <U+017F>hou'd be freed as <U+017F>oon as they came to Land.
So that they concluded it wholly nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to
free the Prince from his Irons, that he might
<U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf to the re<U+017F>t; that they might have
an eye upon him, and that they cou'd not fear a
<U+017F>ingle Man.</p>
                  <p>This being re<U+017F>olv'd; to make the Obligation
the greater, the Captain him<U+017F>elf went to <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko;</hi>
where, after many Complements, and
A<U+017F><U+017F>urances of what he had already promis'd,
he receiving from the Prince his Parole, and
his Hand, for his good Behaviour, di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s'd his
Irons, and brought him to his own Cabin;
where, after having treated and repos'd him a
while, (for he had neither eat nor <U+017F>lept in four
days before) he be<U+017F>ought him to vi<U+017F>it tho<U+017F>e
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47213:60"/>
ob<U+017F>tinate People in Chains, who refus'd all
manner of Su<U+017F>tenance; and entreated him to
oblige 'em to eat, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure 'em of their Liberty
the fir<U+017F>t Opportunity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> who was too generous, not to give
credit to his Words, <U+017F>hew'd him<U+017F>elf to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who were tran<U+017F>ported with Exce<U+017F>s of Joy
at the <U+017F>ight of their Darling Prince; falling at
his Feet, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing and embracing 'em; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
as <U+017F>ome Divine Oracle, all he a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd
'em. But he be<U+017F>ought 'em to bear their Chains
with that Bravery that became tho<U+017F>e whom he
had <U+017F>een act <U+017F>o nobly in Arms; and that they
cou'd not give him greater Proofs of their Love
and Friend<U+017F>hip, <U+017F>ince 'twas all the Security the
Captain (his Friend) cou'd have, again<U+017F>t the
Revenge, he <U+017F>aid, they might po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly ju<U+017F>tly
take, for the Injuries <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain'd by him. And
they all, with one accord, a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him, they
cou'd not <U+017F>uffer enough, when it was for his
Repo<U+017F>e and Safety.</p>
                  <p>After this, they no longer refus'd to eat, but
took what was brought 'em, and were pleas'd
with their Captivity, <U+017F>ince by it they hop'd to
redeem the Prince, who, all the re<U+017F>t of the
Voyage, was treated with all the re<U+017F>pect due to
his Birth, tho' nothing cou'd divert his Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly;
and he wou'd often <U+017F>igh for <hi>Imoinda,</hi>
and think this a Puni<U+017F>hment due to his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
in having left that Noble Maid behind
him, that fatal Night, in the <hi>Otan,</hi> when he
fled to the Camp.</p>
                  <p>Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd with a thou<U+017F>and Thoughts of pa<U+017F>t

tedious Voyage, and at la<U+017F>t arriv'd at the Mouth
of the River of <hi>Surinam,</hi> a Colony belonging
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and where they were
to deliver <U+017F>ome part of their Slaves. There
the Merchants and Gentlemen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
going on Board, to demand tho<U+017F>e Lots
of Slaves they had already agreed on, and,
among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e, the Over-<U+017F>eers of tho<U+017F>e Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
where I then chanc'd to be; the Captain,
who had given the Word, order'd his Men to
bring up tho<U+017F>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> noble Slaves in Fetters, whom
I have <U+017F>poken of; and having put 'em, <U+017F>ome
in one, and <U+017F>ome in other Lots, with Women
and Children (which they call <hi>Pickaninies,</hi>)
they <U+017F>old 'em off, as Slaves, to <U+017F>everal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and Gentlemen; not putting any two
in one Lot, becau<U+017F>e they wou'd <U+017F>eparate 'em
far from each other; not daring to tru<U+017F>t 'em
together, le<U+017F>t Rage and Courage <U+017F>hou'd put
'em upon contriving <U+017F>ome great Action, to the
Ruine of the Colony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>eiz'd on, and <U+017F>old to our

more of all <U+017F>orts and <U+017F>izes, but not one of
Quality with him. When he <U+017F>aw this, he found
what they meant; for, as I <U+017F>aid, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood
<hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> pretty well; and being wholly
unarm'd and defencele<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o as it was in vain to
make any Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, he only beheld the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
with a Look all fierce and di<U+017F>dainful, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding
him with Eyes that forc'd Blu<U+017F>hes on
his guilty Cheeks, he only cry'd, in pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing
over the <U+017F>ide of the Ship; <hi>Farewell, Sir: 'Tis
worth my Suffering, to gain <U+017F>o true a Knowledge
both of you, and of your Gods by whom you <U+017F>wear<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>

                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:47213:61"/>
And de<U+017F>iring tho<U+017F>e that held him to forbear
their pains, and telling 'em he wou'd make no
Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, he cry'd, <hi>Come, my Fellow-Slaves;
let us de<U+017F>cend, and <U+017F>ee if we can meet with more
Honour and Hone<U+017F>ty in the next World we <U+017F>hall
touch upon.</hi> So he nimbly leapt into the Boat,
and <U+017F>hewing no more Concern, <U+017F>uffer'd him<U+017F>elf
to be row'd up the River, with his Seventeen
Companions.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman that bought him, was a
young <hi>Coni<U+017F>h</hi> Gentleman, who<U+017F>e Name was
<hi>Trefry;</hi> a Man of great Wit, and fine Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and was carry'd into tho<U+017F>e Parts by the
Lord—Governor, to manage all his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
He reflecting on the la<U+017F>t World of <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko</hi>
to the Captain, and beholding the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of his Ve<U+017F>t, no <U+017F>ooner came into the Boat,
but he fix'd his Eyes on him; and finding
<U+017F>omething <U+017F>o extraordinary in his Face, his
Shape and Mien, a Greatne<U+017F>s of Look, and
Haughtine<U+017F>s in his Air, and finding he <U+017F>poke
<hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> had a great Mind to be enquiring into
his Quality and Fortune; which, though <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko</hi>
endeavour'd to hide, by only confe<U+017F><U+017F>ing
he was above the Rank of common Slaves,
<hi>Trefry</hi> <U+017F>oon found he was yet <U+017F>omething greater
than he confe<U+017F>s'd; and from that Moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to conceive <U+017F>o va<U+017F>t an E<U+017F>teem for him, that
he ever after lov'd him as his deare<U+017F>t Brother,
and <U+017F>hew'd him all the Civilities due to <U+017F>o great
a Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trefry</hi> was a very good Mathematician, and
a Lingui<U+017F>t; cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and in the three Days they remain'd in the
Boat (for <U+017F>o long were they going from the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47213:61"/>
Ship, to the Plantation) he entertain'd <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko</hi>
<U+017F>o agreeably with his Art and Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
that he was no le<U+017F>s pleas'd with <hi>Trefry,</hi> than
he was with the Prince; and he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
at lea<U+017F>t, fortunate in this, that <U+017F>ince he
was a Slave, as long as he won'd <U+017F>uffer him<U+017F>elf
to remain <U+017F>o, he had a Man of <U+017F>o excellent Wit
and Parts for a Ma<U+017F>ter: So that before they
had fini<U+017F>h'd their Voyage up the River, he
made no <U+017F>cruple of declaring to <hi>Trefry</hi> all his
Fortunes, and mo<U+017F>t part of what I have here
related, and put him<U+017F>elf wholly into the Hands
of his new Friend, whom he found re<U+017F>enting
all the Injuries were done him, and was charm'd
with all the Greatne<U+017F><U+017F>es of his Actions; which
were recited with that Mode<U+017F>ty, and delicate
Sence, as wholly vanqui<U+017F>h'd him, and <U+017F>ubdu'd
him to his Intere<U+017F>t. And he promis'd him on
his Word and Honour, he wou'd find the
Means to re-conduct him to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
again: a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him, he had a perfect Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
of <U+017F>o di<U+017F>honourable an Action; and
that he wou'd <U+017F>ooner have dy'd, than have
been the Author of <U+017F>uch a Perfidy. He found
the Prince was very much concern'd to know
what became of his Friends, and how they
took their Slavery; and <hi>Trefry</hi> promis'd to
take care about the enquiring after their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and that he <U+017F>hou'd have an Account
of 'em.</p>
                  <p>Though, as <hi>Oroonoko</hi> afterwards <U+017F>aid, he had
little Rea<U+017F>on to credit the Words of a <hi>Backea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,</hi>
yet he knew not why; but he <U+017F>aw a
king of Sincerity, and awful Truth in the Face
of <hi>Trefry;</hi> he <U+017F>aw an Hone<U+017F>ty in his Eyes, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47213:62"/>
he found him wi<U+017F>e and witty enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
Honour: for it was one of his Maxims,
<hi>A Man of Wit cou'd not be a Knave or Villain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age up the River, they put in
at <U+017F>everal Hou<U+017F>es for Refre<U+017F>hment; and ever
when they landed, numbers of People wou'd
flock to behold this Man; not but their Eyes
were daily entertain'd with the <U+017F>ight of Slaves,
but the Fame of <hi>Oroonoko</hi> was gone before him,
and all People were in admiration of his Beauty.
Be<U+017F>ides, he had a rich Habit on, in which he
was taken, <U+017F>o different from the re<U+017F>t, and
which the Captain cou'd not <U+017F>trip him of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
he was forc'd to <U+017F>urprize his Per<U+017F>on in
the minute he <U+017F>old him. When he found his
Habit made him liable, as he thought, to be
gaz'd at the more, he begg'd <hi>Trefry</hi> to give him
<U+017F>omething more befitting a Slave; which he
did, and took off his Robes. Neverthele<U+017F>s, he
<U+017F>hone through all, and his <hi>O<U+017F>enbrigs</hi> (a <U+017F>ort of
brown <hi>Holland</hi> Suit he had on) cou'd not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the Graces of his Looks and Mien; and he
had no le<U+017F>s Admirers, than when he had his
dazling Habit on; the Royal Youth appear'd
in <U+017F>pite of the Slave, and People cou'd not help
treating him after a different manner, without
de<U+017F>igning it: As <U+017F>oon as they approach'd him,
they venerated and e<U+017F>teem'd him; his Eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly
commanded Re<U+017F>pect, and his Behaviour
in<U+017F>inuated it into every Soul. So that there was
nothing talk'd of but this young and gallant
Slave, even by tho<U+017F>e who yet knew not that he
was a Prince.</p>
                  <p>I ought to tell you, that the <hi>Chri<U+017F>tians</hi> never
but any Slaves but they give 'em <U+017F>ome Name
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47213:62"/>
of their own, their native ones being likely
very barbarous, and hard to pronounce; <U+017F>o
that Mr. <hi>Trefry</hi> gave <hi>Oroonoko</hi> that of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar:</hi>
which Name will live in that Countrey as long
as that (<U+017F>carce more) glorious one of the great
<hi>Roman;</hi> for 'tis mo<U+017F>t evident, he wanted no
part of the Per<U+017F>onal Courage of that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi>
and acted things as memorable, had they been
done in <U+017F>ome part of the World repleni<U+017F>h'd
with People, and Hi<U+017F>torians, that might have
given him his due. But his Misfortune was,
to fall in an ob<U+017F>cure World, that afforded only
a Female Pen to celebrate his Fame; though
I doubt not but it had liv'd from others Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
if the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who, immediately after
his time, took that Countrey, had not kill'd,
bani<U+017F>h'd and di<U+017F>pers'd all tho<U+017F>e that were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of giving the World this great Man's
Life, much better than I have done. And
Mr. <hi>Trefry,</hi> who de<U+017F>ign'd it, dy'd before he
began it, and bemoan'd him<U+017F>elf for not having
undertook it in time.</p>
                  <p>For the future therefore, I mu<U+017F>t call <hi>Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko,
Cae<U+017F>ar;</hi> Since by that Name only he was
known in our We<U+017F>tern World, and by that
Name he was receiv'd on Shore at <hi>Parham-Hou<U+017F>e,</hi>
where he was de<U+017F>tin'd a Slave. But if
the King him<U+017F>elf (God ble<U+017F>s him) had come
a-<U+017F>hore, there cou'd not have been greater
Expectations by all the whole Plantation, and
tho<U+017F>e neighbouring ones, than was on ours at
that time; and he was receiv'd more like a
Governor, than a Slave. Notwith<U+017F>tanding, as
the Cu<U+017F>tom was, they a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd him his portion
of Land, his Hou<U+017F>e, and his Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, up in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47213:63"/>
Plantation. But as it was more for Form, than
any De<U+017F>ign, to put him to his Task, he endur'd
no more of the Slave but the Name, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
<U+017F>ome Days in the Hou<U+017F>e, receiving all
Vi<U+017F>its that were made him, without <U+017F>tirring
towards that part of the Plantation where the
<hi>Negroes</hi> were.</p>
                  <p>At la<U+017F>t, he wou'd needs go view his Land,
his Hou<U+017F>e, and the Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd him. But
he no <U+017F>ooner came to the Hou<U+017F>es of the Slaves,
which are like a little Town by it <U+017F>elf, the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi>
all having left Work, but they all came
forth to behold him, and found he was that
Prince who had, at <U+017F>everal times, <U+017F>old mo<U+017F>t of
'em to the<U+017F>e Parts; and, from a Veneration they
pay to great Men, e<U+017F>pecially if they know 'em,
and from the Surprize and Awe they had at the
<U+017F>ight of him, they all ca<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves at his Feet,
crying out, in their Language, <hi>Live, O King!
Long live, O King!</hi> And ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing his Feet, paid
him even Divine Homage.</p>
                  <p>Several <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Gentlemen were with him;
and what Mr. <hi>Trefry</hi> had told 'em, was here
confirm'd; of which he him<U+017F>elf before had no
other Witne<U+017F>s than <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> him<U+017F>elf: But he was
infinitely glad to find his Grandure confirm'd
by the Adoration of all the Slaves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> troubl'd with their Over-Joy, and
Over-Ceremony, be<U+017F>ought 'em to ri<U+017F>e, and to
receive him as their Fellow-Slave; a<U+017F><U+017F>uring
them, he was no better. At which they <U+017F>et
up with one Accord a mo<U+017F>t terrible and hidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mourning and Condoling, which he and
the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> had much a-do to appea<U+017F>e; but at
la<U+017F>t they prevail'd with 'em, and they prepar'd
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47213:63"/>
all their barbarous Mu<U+017F>ick, and every one kill'd
and dre<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>omething of his own Stock (for
every Family has their Land a-part, on which,
at their lei<U+017F>ure-times, they breed all eatable

magnificent Supper, inviting their <hi>Grandee Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
their <hi>Prince,</hi> to honour it with his Pre<U+017F>ence;
which he did, and <U+017F>everal <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> with him;
where they all waited on him, <U+017F>ome playing,

                  <p>While they <U+017F>at at Meat, Mr. <hi>Trefry</hi> told <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ar,</hi>
that mo<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e young <hi>Salves</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
in Love, with a fine She-<hi>Slave,</hi> whom
they had had about Six Months on their Land;
the <hi>Prince,</hi> who never heard the Name of <hi>Love</hi>
without a Sigh, nor any mention of it without
the Curio<U+017F>ity of examining further into that
tale, which of all Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es was mo<U+017F>t agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him, asked, how they came to be <U+017F>o
Unhappy, as to be all Undone for one fair
<hi>Slave? Trefry,</hi> who was naturally Amorous,
and lov'd to talk of Love as well as any body,
proceeded to tell him, they had the mo<U+017F>t charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Black</hi> that ever was beheld on their <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
about fifteen or <U+017F>ixteen Years old, as he
gue<U+017F>s'd that, for his part, he had done nothing
but Sigh for her ever <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he came; and that
all the <hi>White</hi> Beauties he had <U+017F>een, never
charm'd him <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olutely as this fine Creature
had done; and that no Man, of any Nation,
ever beheld her, that did not fall in Love with
her; and that <U+017F>he had all the <hi>Slaves</hi> perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47213:64"/>
at her Feet; and the whole Countrey re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ounded
with the Fame of <hi>Clemene,</hi> for <U+017F>o (<U+017F>aid
he) we have Chri<U+017F>ten'd her: But <U+017F>he denies us
all with <U+017F>uch a noble Di<U+017F>dain, that 'tis a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
to <U+017F>ee, that <U+017F>he, who can give <U+017F>uch eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

Unconcern. She is adorn'd with the mo<U+017F>t grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Mode<U+017F>ty that ever beautify'd Youth; the
<U+017F>ofte<U+017F>t Sigher;—that, if <U+017F>he were capable
of Love, one wou'd <U+017F>wear <U+017F>he langui<U+017F>h'd for
<U+017F>ome ab<U+017F>ent happy Man; and <U+017F>o retir'd, as if
<U+017F>he fear'd a Rape even from the God of Day,
or that the Breezes wou'd <U+017F>teal Ki<U+017F><U+017F>es from her

Lover every Day makes it his Petition to
perform for her; which <U+017F>he accepts, blu<U+017F>hing,
and with reluctancy, for fear he will ask her
a Look for a Recompence, which he dares not
pre<U+017F>ume to hope; <U+017F>o great an Awe <U+017F>he <U+017F>trikes
into the Hearts of her Admirers. <hi>I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

wonder how <U+017F>he e<U+017F>capes tho<U+017F>e who can entertain her
as you can do: or why, being your Slave, you do
not oblige her to yield. I confe<U+017F>s</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Trefry) when
I have, against her Will, entertain'd her with Love
<U+017F>o long, as to be tran<U+017F>ported with my Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
even above Decency, I have been ready to make
u<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e advantages of Strength and Force
Nature has given me: But, oh! <U+017F>he di<U+017F>arms me,
with that Mode<U+017F>ty and Weeping, <U+017F>o tender and <U+017F>o
moving, that I retire, and thank my Stars <U+017F>he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
me.</hi> The Company laugh'd at his Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to a <hi>Slave,</hi> and <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> only applauded the
Noblene<U+017F>s of his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion and Nature; <U+017F>ince that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47213:64"/>
Slave might be Noble, or, what was better,
have true Notions of Honour and Vertue in her.
Thus pa<U+017F>s'd they this Night, after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from the <hi>Slaves</hi> all imaginable Re<U+017F>pect and
Obedience.</p>
                  <p>The next day, <hi>Trefry</hi> ask'd <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> to walk
when the Heat was allay'd, and de<U+017F>ignedly
carry'd him by the Cottage of the <hi>fair Slave;</hi>
and told him, <U+017F>he whom he <U+017F>poke of la<U+017F>t night
liv'd there retir'd: <hi>But</hi> (<U+017F>ays he) <hi>I wou'd not
wi<U+017F>h you to approach; for I am <U+017F>ure, you will be
in Love as <U+017F>oon as you behold her. Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd
him, he was Proof again<U+017F>t all the Charms of
that Sex; and that if he imagin'd his Heart
cou'd be <U+017F>o perfidious to Love again, after
<hi>Imoinda,</hi> he believ'd he <U+017F>hou'd tear it from his
Bo<U+017F>om. They had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>poke, but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Shock-Dog, that <hi>Clemene</hi> had pre<U+017F>ented her,
which <U+017F>he took great delight in, ran out; and
<U+017F>he, not knowing any body was there, ran to
get it in again, and bolted out on tho<U+017F>e who
were ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>peaking of her: When, <U+017F>eeing them,
<U+017F>he wou'd have run in again; but <hi>Trefry</hi> caught
her by the Hand, and cry'd; Clemene, <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you flie a Lover, you ought to pay <U+017F>ome Re<U+017F>pect
to this Stranger,</hi> (pointing to <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar.</hi>) But <U+017F>he,
as if <U+017F>he had re<U+017F>olv'd never to rai<U+017F>e her Eyes to
the Face of a Man again, bent 'em the more to
the Earth, when he <U+017F>poke, and gave the <hi>Prince</hi>
the lei<U+017F>ure to look the more at her. There
needed no long Gazing, or Con<U+017F>ideration, to
examine who this <hi>fair Creature</hi> was; he <U+017F>oon
<U+017F>aw <hi>Imoinda</hi> all over her; in a minute he <U+017F>aw
her Face, her Shape, her Air, her Mode<U+017F>ty,
and all that call'd forth his Soul with Joy at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47213:65"/>
his Eyes, and left his Body de<U+017F>titute of almo<U+017F>t
Life; it <U+017F>tood without Motion, and, for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
knew not that it had a Being: and, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
he had never come to him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>o oppre<U+017F>s'd
he was with Over-joy, if he had not met with
this Allay, that he perceiv'd <hi>Imoinda</hi> fall dead
in the Hands of <hi>Trefry:</hi> This awaken'd him,
and he ran to her Aid, and caught her in his
Arms, where, by degrees, <U+017F>he came to her <U+017F>elf;
and 'tis needle<U+017F>s to tell with what Tran<U+017F>ports,
what Exta<U+017F>ies of Joy, they both a while beheld
each other, without Speaking; then Snatch'd
each other to their Arms; then Gaze again, as
if they <U+017F>till doubted whether they po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd
the Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing: They Gra<U+017F>p'd; but when they
recover'd their Speech, 'tis not to be imagin'd,
what tender Things they expre<U+017F>s'd to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
wondering what <U+017F>trange Fate had brought
'em again together. They <U+017F>oon inform'd each
other of their Fortunes, and equally bewail'd
their Fate; but, at the <U+017F>ame time, they mutually
prote<U+017F>ted, that even Fetters and Slavery were
Soft and Ea<U+017F>ie; and wou'd be <U+017F>upported with
Joy and Plea<U+017F>ure, while they cou'd be <U+017F>o happy
to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s each other, and to be able to make
good their Vows. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> <U+017F>wore he di<U+017F>dain'd the
Empire of the World, while he cou'd behold his
<hi>Imoinda;</hi> and <U+017F>he de<U+017F>pis'd Grandure and Pomp,
tho<U+017F>e Vanities of her Sex, when <U+017F>he cou'd Gaze
on <hi>Oroonoko.</hi> He ador'd the very Cottage where
<U+017F>he re<U+017F>ided, and <U+017F>aid, That little Inch of the

                     <hi>Trefry</hi> was infinitely pleas'd with this Novel,
and found this <hi>Clemene</hi> was the Fair Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of
whom <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> had before <U+017F>poke; and was not a
little <U+017F>atisfied, that Heaven was <U+017F>o kind to the
<hi>Prince,</hi> as to <U+017F>weeten his Misfortunes by <U+017F>o lucky
an Accident; and leaving the Lovers to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
was impatient to come down to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-Hou<U+017F>e,</hi>
(which was on the <U+017F>ame <hi>Plantation</hi>)
to give me an Account of what had hapned. I
was as impatient to make the<U+017F>e Lovers a Vi<U+017F>it,
having already made a Friend<U+017F>hip with <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar;</hi>
and from his own Mouth learn'd what I have
related, which was confirmed by his French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who was <U+017F>et on Shoar to <U+017F>eek his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
and of whom they cou'd not make a
Slave, becau<U+017F>e a Chri<U+017F>tian; and he came daily
to <hi>Parham-Hill</hi> to <U+017F>ee and pay his Re<U+017F>pects to
his Puple <hi>Prince:</hi> So that concerning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre<U+017F>ting
my <U+017F>elf, in all that related to <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi>
whom I had a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of Liberty, as <U+017F>oon as the
Governor arriv'd, I ha<U+017F>ted pre<U+017F>ently to the
Place where the Lovers were, and was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
glad to find this Beautiful young <hi>Slave</hi>
(who had already gain'd all our E<U+017F>teems, for
her Mode<U+017F>ty and her extraordinary Prettine<U+017F>s)
to be the <U+017F>ame I had heard <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o much
of. One may imagine then we paid her a treble
Re<U+017F>pect; and though from her being carv'd in
fine Flowers and Birds all over her Body, we
took her to be of Quality before, yet, when we
knew <hi>Clemene</hi> was <hi>Imoinda,</hi> we cou'd not enough
admire her.</p>
                  <p>I had forgot to tell you, that tho<U+017F>e who are
Nobly born of that Country, are <U+017F>o delicately
Cut and Rac'd all over the fore-part of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47213:66"/>
Trunk of their Bodies, that it looks as if it were
Japan'd, the Works being rai<U+017F>ed like high
Poynt round the edges of the Flowers. Some
are only carv'd with a little Flower, or Bird,
at the <U+017F>ides of the Temples, as was <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar;</hi> and
tho<U+017F>e who are <U+017F>o carv'd over the Body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emble
our Ancient <hi>Picts</hi> that are figur'd in
the Chronicles, but the<U+017F>e Carvings are more
delicate.</p>
                  <p>From that happy Day <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> took <hi>Clemene</hi>
for his Wife, to the general Joy of all People;
and there was as much Magnificence as the
Countrey wou'd afford at the Celebration of
this Wedding: and in a very <U+017F>hort time after
<U+017F>he conceiv'd with Child; which made <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>
even adore her, knowing he was the la<U+017F>t of his
Great Race. This new Accident made him
more impatient of Liberty, and he was every
day treating with <hi>Trefry</hi> for his and <hi>Clemene</hi>'s
Liberty, and offer'd either Gold, or a va<U+017F>t
quantity of Slaves, which <U+017F>hou'd be paid before
they let him go, provided he cou'd have any
Security that he <U+017F>hou'd go when his Ran<U+017F>om
was paid. They fed him from Day to Day
with Promi<U+017F>es, and delay'd him till the Lord-Governor
<U+017F>hou'd come; <U+017F>o that he began to
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect them of fal<U+017F>hood, and that they wou'd
delay him till the time of his Wife's Delivery,
and make a Slave of that too; for all the Breed
is theirs to whom the Parents belong: This
Thought made him very unea<U+017F>ie, and his Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenne<U+017F>s
gave them <U+017F>ome Jealou<U+017F>ies of him; <U+017F>o
that I was oblig'd, by <U+017F>ome Per<U+017F>ons who fear'd
a Mutiny (which is very fatal <U+017F>ometimes in
tho<U+017F>e Colonies, that abound <U+017F>o with Slaves,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47213:66"/>
that they exceed the <hi>Whites</hi> in va<U+017F>t Numbers)
to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> and to give him all
the Satisfaction I pro<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could; they knew he
and <hi>Clemene</hi> were <U+017F>carce an Hour in a Day from
my Lodgings; that they eat with me, and that
I oblig'd 'em in all things I was capable of: I
entertain'd 'em with the Lives of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and Great Men; which charm'd him to my
Company; and her, with teaching her all the
pretty Works that I was Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her Stories of Nuns, and endeavouring to
bring her to the Knowledge of the True God.
But of all Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> lik'd that the wor<U+017F>t,
and wou'd never be reconcil'd to our Notions
of the Trinity, of which he ever made a Je<U+017F>t:
it was a Riddle, he <U+017F>aid, wou'd turn his Brain
to conceive, and one cou'd not make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand
what Faith was. However, the<U+017F>e
Conver<U+017F>ations fail'd not altogether <U+017F>o well to
divert him, that he lik'd the Company of us
Women much above the Men: for he cou'd
not drink; and he is but an ill Companion in
that Countrey that cannot: So that obliging
him to love us very well, we had all the liberty
of Speech with him, e<U+017F>pecially my <U+017F>elf, whom
he calld his <hi>Great Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s;</hi> and, indeed, my
Word wou'd go a great way with him. For
the<U+017F>e Rea<U+017F>ons, I had opportunity to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to him, that he was not well pleas'd of
late, as he us'd to be; was more retir'd and
thoughtful; and told him, I took it ill he
<U+017F>hou'd Su<U+017F>pect we wou'd break our Words with
him, and not permit both him and <hi>Clemene</hi> to
return to his own Kingdom, which was not <U+017F>o
long a way, but, when he was once on his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47213:67"/>
he wou'd quickly arrive there. He made
me <U+017F>ome An<U+017F>wers that <U+017F>hew'd a doubt in him,
which made me ask what advantage it wou'd
be to doubt? it would but give us a Fear of
him, and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly compel us to treat him <U+017F>o as I
<U+017F>hou'd be very loath to behold: that is, it might
occa<U+017F>ion his Confinement. Perhaps this was
not <U+017F>o luckily <U+017F>poke of me, for I perceiv'd he
re<U+017F>ented that Word, which I <U+017F>trove to <U+017F>often
again in vain: However, he a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me, that
what<U+017F>oever Re<U+017F>olutions he <U+017F>hou'd take, he wou'd
Act nothing upon the White-People; and as for
my <U+017F>elf, and tho<U+017F>e upon that <hi>Plantation</hi> where
he was, he wou'd <U+017F>ooner forfeit his eternal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and Life it <U+017F>elf, than lift his Hand again<U+017F>t
his greate<U+017F>t Enemy on that Place: He be<U+017F>ought
me to <U+017F>uffer no Fears upon his Account, for he
cou'd do nothing that Honour <U+017F>hou'd not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate;
but he accus'd him<U+017F>elf for having <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
Slavery <U+017F>o long; yet he charg'd that
weakne<U+017F>s on Love alone, who was capable of
making him neglect even Glory it <U+017F>elf; and,
for which, now he reproaches him<U+017F>elf every
moment of the Day. Much more to this effect
he <U+017F>poke, with an Air impatient enough to
make me know he wou'd not be long in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;
and though he <U+017F>uffer'd only the Name
of a Slave, and had nothing of the Toil and
Labour of one, yet that was <U+017F>ufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him Unea<U+017F>ie; and he had been too long
Idle, who us'd to be always in Action, and in
Arms: He had a Spirit all Rough and Fierce,
and that cou'd not be tam'd to lazy Re<U+017F>t;
and though all endeavours were us'd to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e
him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>uch Actions and Sports as this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47213:67"/>
World afforded, as Running, Wre<U+017F>tling, Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Bar; Hunting and Fi<U+017F>hing, Cha<U+017F>ing and
Killing <hi>Tigers</hi> of a mon<U+017F>trous Size, which this
Continent affords in abundance; and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Snakes,</hi> <U+017F>uch as <hi>Alexander</hi> is reported to have
incounter'd at the River of <hi>Amazons,</hi> and which
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> took great Delight to overcome; yet
the<U+017F>e were not Actions great enough for his
large Soul, which was <U+017F>till panting after more
renown'd Action.</p>
                  <p>Before I parted that Day with him, I got, with
much ado, a Promi<U+017F>e from him to re<U+017F>t yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
longer with Patience, and wait the coming of
the Lord Governor, who was every Day expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
on our Shore; he a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me he wou'd, and
this Promi<U+017F>e he de<U+017F>ired me to know was given
perfectly in Complai<U+017F>ance to me, in whom he
had an intire Confidence.</p>
                  <p>After this, I neither thought it convenient
to tru<U+017F>t him much out of our View, nor did
the Country who fear'd him; but with one
accord it was advis'd to treat him fairly, and
oblige him to remain within <U+017F>uch a compa<U+017F>s, and
that he <U+017F>hou'd be permitted, as <U+017F>eldom as cou'd
be, to go up to the Plantations of the Negroes;
or, if he did, to be accompany'd by <U+017F>ome that
<U+017F>hou'd be rather in appearance Attendants than
Spys. This Care was for <U+017F>ome time taken, and
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> look'd upon it as a Mark of extraordinary
Re<U+017F>pect, and was glad his di<U+017F>content had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
'em to be more ob<U+017F>ervant to him; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
new a<U+017F><U+017F>urance from the Over<U+017F>eer, which
was confirmed to him by the Opinion of all the
Gentlemen of the Country, who made their
court to him: During this time that we had
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47213:68"/>
his Company more frequently than hitherto we
had had, it may not be unplea<U+017F>ant to relate to
you the Diver<U+017F>ions we entertaind'd him with,
or rather he us.</p>
                  <p>My <U+017F>tay was to be <U+017F>hort in that Countrey;
becau<U+017F>e my Father dy'd at Sea, and never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the Honour was de<U+017F>ign'd him,
(which was Lieutenant-General of Six and
thirty I<U+017F>lands, be<U+017F>ides the Continent of <hi>Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi>)
nor the Advantages he hop'd to reap by
them: <U+017F>o that though we were oblig'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
on our Voyage, we did not intend to <U+017F>tay
upon the Place. Though, in a word, I mu<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ay thus much of it; That certainly, had his late
Maje<U+017F>ty, of <U+017F>acred Memory, but <U+017F>een and known
what a va<U+017F>t and charming World he had been
Ma<U+017F>ter of in that Continent, he wou'd never
have parted <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily with it to the <hi>Dutch.</hi> 'Tis
a Continent who<U+017F>e va<U+017F>t Extent was never yet
known, and may contain more Noble Earth than
all the Univer<U+017F>e be<U+017F>ide; for, they <U+017F>ay, it reaches
from Ea<U+017F>t to We<U+017F>t one way as far as <hi>China,</hi> and
another to <hi>Peru:</hi> It affords all things both for
Beauty and U<U+017F>e; 'tis there Eternal Spring, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the very Months of <hi>April, May</hi> and <hi>June;</hi>
the Shades are perpetual, the Trees bearing at
once all degrees of Leaves and Fruit, from
blooming Buds to ripe Autumn: Groves of
Oranges, Limons, Citrons, Figs, Nutmegs, and
noble Aromaticks, continually bearing their
Fragrancies. The Trees appearing all like No<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gays
adorn'd with Flowers of different kinds;
<U+017F>ome are all White, <U+017F>ome Purple, <U+017F>ome Scarlet,
<U+017F>ome Blue, <U+017F>ome Yellow; bearing, at the <U+017F>ame
time, Ripe Fruit and Blooming Young, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47213:68"/>
every day new. The very Wood of
all the<U+017F>e Trees have an intrin<U+017F>ick Value above
common Timber; for they are, when cut, of
different Colours, glorious to behold; and bear
a price con<U+017F>iderable, to Inlay withal. Be<U+017F>ides
this, they yield rich Balm, and Gums; <U+017F>o that
we make our Candles of <U+017F>uch an Aromatick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance,
as does not only give a <U+017F>ufficient Light,
but, as they burn, they ca<U+017F>t their Perfumes all
about. Cedar is the common Firing, and all
the Hou<U+017F>es are built with it. The very Meat
we eat, when <U+017F>et on the Table, if it be Native,
I mean, of the Countrey, perfumes the whole
Room; e<U+017F>pecially a little Bea<U+017F>t call'd an <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilly,</hi>
a thing which I can liken to nothing <U+017F>o
well as a <hi>Rhinoceros;</hi> 'tis all in white Armour, <U+017F>o
jointed, that it moves as well in it, as if it had
nothing on; this Bea<U+017F>t is about the bigne<U+017F>s of
a Pig of <U+017F>ix Weeks old. But it were endle<U+017F>s to
give an Account of all the divers Wonderful
and Strange things that Countrey affords, and
which we took a very great delight to go in
<U+017F>earch of; though tho<U+017F>e Adventures are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Fatal, and at lea<U+017F>t Dangerous: But while
we had <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> in our Company on the<U+017F>e De<U+017F>igns,
we fear'd no harm, nor <U+017F>uffer'd any.</p>
                  <p>As <U+017F>oon as I came into the Countrey, the be<U+017F>t
Hou<U+017F>e in it was pre<U+017F>ented me, call'd <hi>St. John's
Hill:</hi> It <U+017F>tood on a va<U+017F>t Rock of white Marble,
at the foot of which the River ran a va<U+017F>t depth
down, and not to be de<U+017F>cended on that <U+017F>ide;
the little Waves <U+017F>till da<U+017F>hing and wa<U+017F>hing the
foot of this Rock, made the <U+017F>ofte<U+017F>t Murmurs
and Purlings in the World; and the oppo<U+017F>ite
Bank was adorn'd with <U+017F>uch va<U+017F>t quantities of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47213:69"/>
different Flowers eternally Blowing, and every
Day and Hour new, fenc'd behind 'em with
lofty Trees of a thou<U+017F>and rare Forms and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
that the Pro<U+017F>pect was the mo<U+017F>t ravi<U+017F>hing
that Sands can create. On the edge of this
white Rock, towards the River, was a Walk
or Grove of Orange and Limon-Trees, about
half the length of the <hi>Mall</hi> here, who<U+017F>e Flowery
and Fruit-bearing Branches met at the top, and
hinder'd the Sun, who<U+017F>e Rays are very fierce
there, from entering a Beam into the Grove;
and the cool Air that came from the River,
made it not only fit to entertain People in, at
all the hotte<U+017F>t hours of the day, but refre<U+017F>h'd
the <U+017F>weet Blo<U+017F><U+017F>oms, and made it always Sweet
and Charming; and <U+017F>ure, the whole Globe of
the World cannot <U+017F>hew <U+017F>o delightful a Place as
this Grove was: Not all the Gardens of boa<U+017F>ted
<hi>Italy</hi> can produce a Shade to out-vie this, which
Nature had join'd with Art to render <U+017F>o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
fine; and 'tis a marvel to <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>uch
va<U+017F>t Trees, as big as <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Oaks, cou'd take
footing on <U+017F>o <U+017F>olid a Rock, and in <U+017F>o little Earth
as cover'd that Rock: But all things by Nature
there are Rare, Delightful and Wonderful.
But to our Sports.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we wou'd go <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing, and in
<U+017F>earch of young <hi>Tigers</hi> in their Dens, watching
when the old ones went forth to forage for
Prey; and oftentimes we have been in great
danger, and have fled a-pace for our Lives,
when <U+017F>urpriz'd by the Dams. But once, above
all other times, we went on this De<U+017F>ign, and
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> was with us; who had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>toln
a young <hi>Tiger</hi> from her Ne<U+017F>t, but going off,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47213:69"/>
we encounter'd the Dam, bearing a Buttock
of a Cow, which he had torn off with his
mighty Paw, and going with it towards his
Den; we had only four Women, <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> and
an <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Gentleman, Brother to <hi>Harry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
the great <hi>Oliverian;</hi> we found there was
no e<U+017F>caping this enraged and ravenous Bea<U+017F>t.
However, we Women fled as fa<U+017F>t as we cou'd
from it; but our Heels had not <U+017F>aved our Lives,
if <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> had not laid down his <hi>Cub,</hi> when he
found the <hi>Tiger</hi> quit her Prey to make the
more <U+017F>peed towards him; and taking Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s
Sword, de<U+017F>ir'd him to <U+017F>tand a<U+017F>ide, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Ladies. He obey'd him; and <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>
met this mon<U+017F>trous Bea<U+017F>t of might, <U+017F>ize, and
va<U+017F>t Limbs, who came with open Jaws upon
him; and fixing his awful <U+017F>tern Eyes full upon
tho<U+017F>e of the Bea<U+017F>t, and putting him<U+017F>elf into a
very <U+017F>teddy and good aiming po<U+017F>ture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
ran his Sword quite through his Brea<U+017F>t
down to his very Heart, home to the Hilt of
the Sword: the dying Bea<U+017F>t <U+017F>tretch'd forth her
Paw, and going to gra<U+017F>p his Thigh, <U+017F>urpriz'd
with death in that very moment, did him no
other harm than fixing her long Nails in his
Fle<U+017F>h very deep, feebly wounded him, but
cou'd not gra<U+017F>p the Fle<U+017F>h to tear off any.
When he had done this, he hollow'd to us
to return: which, after <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of his
Victory, we did, and found him lugging out
the Sword from the Bo<U+017F>om of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> who
was laid in her blood on the ground; he took
up the <hi>Cub,</hi> and with an Unconcern that had
nothing of the Joy or Gladne<U+017F>s of a Victory,
he came and laid the Whelp at my Feet. We
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47213:70"/>
all extremely wonder'd at his Daring, and at
the Bigne<U+017F>s of the Bea<U+017F>t, which was about the
heighth of an Heifer, but of mighty great and
<U+017F>trong Limbs.</p>
                  <p>Another time, being in the Woods, he kill'd
a <hi>Tiger</hi> which had long infe<U+017F>ted that Part, and
borne away abundance of Sheep and Oxen, and
other things that were for the <U+017F>upport of tho<U+017F>e
to whom they belong'd: abundance of People
a<U+017F><U+017F>ail'd this Bea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ome affirming they had <U+017F>hot
her with <U+017F>everal Bullets quite through the
Body, at <U+017F>everal times; and <U+017F>ome <U+017F>wearing they
<U+017F>hot her through the very Heart, and they
believ'd <U+017F>he was a Devil, rather than a mortal
thing. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> had often <U+017F>aid, he had a mind
to encounter this Mon<U+017F>ter, and <U+017F>poke with <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Gentlemen who had attempted her; one
crying, I <U+017F>hot her with <U+017F>o many poy<U+017F>on'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
another with his Gun in this part of
her, and another in that; <U+017F>o that he remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the<U+017F>e places where <U+017F>he was <U+017F>hot, fancy'd
<U+017F>till he <U+017F>hou'd overcome her, by giving her ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>ort of a Wound than any had yet done,
and one day <U+017F>aid (at the Table,) <hi>What Trophies
and Garlands, Ladies, will you make me, if I bring
you home the Heart of this Ravenous Beast, that
eats up all your Lambs and Pigs?</hi> We all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
he <U+017F>hou'd be rewarded at all our hands.
So taking a Bow, which he cho<U+017F>e out of a
great many, he went up into the Wood, with
two Gentlemen, where he imagin'd this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer
to be; they had not pa<U+017F>t very far in
it, but they heard her Voice, growling and
grumbling, as if <U+017F>he were pleas'd with <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<U+017F>he was doing. When they came in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47213:70"/>
view, they found her muzzling in the Belly
of a new ravi<U+017F>h'd Sheep, which <U+017F>he had torn
open; and <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elf approach'd, <U+017F>he took
fa<U+017F>t hold of her Prey with her fore Paws, and
<U+017F>et a very fierce raging Look on <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offering to approach him, for fear at the
<U+017F>ame time of lo<U+017F>ing what <U+017F>he had in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion.
So that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> remain'd a good while,
only taking aim, and getting an opportunity to
<U+017F>hoot her where he de<U+017F>ign'd: 'twas <U+017F>ome time
before he cou'd accompli<U+017F>h it; and to wound
her, and not kill her, wou'd but have enrag'd
her the more, and endanger'd him: He had a
Quiver of Arrows at his Side, <U+017F>o that if one fail'd,
he could be <U+017F>upply'd; at la<U+017F>t, retiring a little,
he gave her opportunity to eat; for he found
<U+017F>he was ravenous, and fell too as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he
<U+017F>aw him retire, being more eager of her Prey,
than of doing new Mi<U+017F>chiefs: when he going
<U+017F>oftly to one <U+017F>ide of her, and hiding his Per<U+017F>on
behind certain Herbage that grew high and
thick, he took <U+017F>o good aim, that, as he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he <U+017F>hot her ju<U+017F>t into the Eye, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
was <U+017F>ent with <U+017F>o good a will, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>ure
a hand, that it <U+017F>tuck in her Brain, and made
her caper, and become mad for a moment or
two; but being <U+017F>econded by another Arrow,
<U+017F>he fell dead upon the Prey. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> cut her
open with a Knife, to <U+017F>ee where tho<U+017F>e Wounds
were that had been reported to him, and why
<U+017F>he did not die of 'em. But I <U+017F>hall now relate
a thing that, po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, will find no credit among
Men; becau<U+017F>e 'tis a Notion commonly receiv'd
with us, That nothing can receive a Wound
in the Heart and live: But when the Heart of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47213:71"/>
this courageous Animal was taken out, there
were <U+017F>even Bullets of Lead in it, and the
Wounds <U+017F>eam'd up with great Scars, and <U+017F>he
liv'd with the Bullets a great while, for it was
long <U+017F>ince they were <U+017F>hot: This Heart the
Conqueror brought up to us, and 'twas a very
great Curio<U+017F>ity, which all the Countrey came
to <U+017F>ee; and which gave <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> occa<U+017F>ion of many
fine Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es; of Accidents in War, and
<U+017F>trange E<U+017F>capes.</p>
                  <p>At other times he wou'd go a Fi<U+017F>hing; and
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing on that Diver<U+017F>ion, he found we had
in that Countrey a very <U+017F>trange Fi<U+017F>h, call'd a
<hi>Numb Eel</hi> (an <hi>Eel</hi> of which I have eaten) that
while it is aliye, it has a quality <U+017F>o Cold, that
tho<U+017F>e who are Angling, though with a Line of
never <U+017F>o great a length, with a Rod at the end
of it, it <U+017F>hall, in the <U+017F>ame minute the Bait is
touched by this <hi>Eel,</hi> <U+017F>eize him or<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> her that holds
the Rod with benumb'dne<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>hall deprive
'em of Sen<U+017F>e, for a while; and <U+017F>ome have faln
into the Water, and others drop'd, as dead, on
the Banks of the Rivers where they <U+017F>tood, as
<U+017F>oon as this Fi<U+017F>h touches the Bait. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> us'd
to laugh at this, and believ'd it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible a
Man cou'd lo<U+017F>e his Force at the touch of a
Fi<U+017F>h; and cou'd not under<U+017F>tand that Philo<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
that a Cold Quality <U+017F>hould be of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
however, he had a great Curio<U+017F>ity to
try whether it wou'd have the <U+017F>ame effect on
him it had on others, and often try'd, but in
vain: at la<U+017F>t, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ought-for Fi<U+017F>h came to the
Bait, as he <U+017F>tood Angling on the Bank; and
in<U+017F>tead of throwing away the Rod, or giving
it a <U+017F>udden twitch out of the Water, whereby
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47213:71"/>
he might have caught both the <hi>Eel,</hi> and have
di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s'd the Rod, before it cou'd have too
much power over him; for Experiment-<U+017F>ake,
he gra<U+017F>p'd it but the harder, and fainting fell
into the River; and being <U+017F>till po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of the
Rod, the Tide carry'd him, <U+017F>en<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s as he was,
a great way, till an <hi>Indian</hi> Boat took him up;
and perceiv'd, when they touch'd him, a Numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
<U+017F>eize them, and by that knew the Rod was
in his Hand; which, with a Paddle, (that is,
a <U+017F>hort Oar) they <U+017F>truck away, and <U+017F>nacht
it into the Boat, <hi>Eel</hi> and all. If <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> was
almo<U+017F>t dead, with the effect of this Fi<U+017F>h, he
was more <U+017F>o with that of the Water, where he
had remain'd the <U+017F>pace of going a League, and
they found they had much a-doe to bring him
back to life; but at la<U+017F>t they did, and brought
him home, where he was in a few hours well
recover'd and refre<U+017F>h'd, and not a little a<U+017F>ham'd
to find he <U+017F>hou'd be overcome by an <hi>Eel,</hi> and
that all the People, who heard his Defiance,
wou'd laugh at him. But we chear'd him up;
and he, being convinc'd, we had the <hi>Eel</hi> at
Supper, which was a Quarter of an Ell about,
and mo<U+017F>t delicate Meat; and was of the more
value, <U+017F>ince it co<U+017F>t <U+017F>o dear as almo<U+017F>t the Life of
<U+017F>o gallant a Man.</p>
                  <p>About this time we were in many mortal
Fears, about <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>putes the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> had
with the <hi>Indians;</hi> <U+017F>o that we cou'd <U+017F>carce tru<U+017F>t
our <U+017F>elves, without great Numbers, to go to
any <hi>Indian</hi> Towns or Place where they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode,
for fear they <U+017F>hou'd fall upon us, as they
did immediately after my coming away; and
that it was in the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47213:72"/>
us'd 'em not <U+017F>o civilly as the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h;</hi> <U+017F>o that
they cut in pieces all they cou'd take, getting
into Hou<U+017F>es, and hanging up the Mother, and
all her Children about her; and cut a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
I left behind me, all in Joints, and nail'd
him to Trees.</p>
                  <p>This Feud began while I was there; <U+017F>o that
I lo<U+017F>t half the Satisfaction I propos'd, in not
<U+017F>eeing and vi<U+017F>iting the <hi>Indian</hi> Towns. But one
day, bemoaning of our Misfortunes upon this
account, <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> told us, we need not fear; for
if we had a mind to go, he wou'd undertake
to be our Guard. Some wou'd, but mo<U+017F>t wou'd
not venture: about Eighteen of us re<U+017F>olv'd, and
took Barge; and after eight days, arriv'd near
an <hi>Indian</hi> Town: But approaching it, the
Hearts of <U+017F>ome of our Company fail'd, and
they wou'd not venture on Shore; <U+017F>o we Poll'd
who wou'd, and who wou'd not. For my
part, I <U+017F>aid, If <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> wou'd, I wou'd go. He
re<U+017F>olv'd; <U+017F>o did my Brother, and my Woman,
a Maid of good Courage. Now, none of us
<U+017F>peaking the Language of the People, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
we <U+017F>hou'd have a half Diver<U+017F>ion in Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
only; and not knowing what they <U+017F>aid,
we took a Fi<U+017F>herman that liv'd at the mouth of
the River, who had been a long Inhabitant there,
and oblig'd him to go with us: But becau<U+017F>e he
was known to the <hi>Indians,</hi> as trading among 'em,
and being, by long living there, become a perfect
in <hi>Indian</hi> Colour, we, who re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>urprize
'em, by making them <U+017F>ee <U+017F>omething they never
had <U+017F>een, (that is, <hi>White</hi> People) re<U+017F>olv'd only my
<U+017F>elf, my Brother and Woman <U+017F>hou'd go; <U+017F>o <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ar,</hi>
the Fi<U+017F>herman, and the re<U+017F>t, hiding behind
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47213:72"/>
<U+017F>ome thick Reeds and Flowers that grew on
the Banks, let us pa<U+017F>s on towards the Town,
which was on the Bank of the River all along.
A little di<U+017F>tant from the Hou<U+017F>es, or Huts, we
<U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome Dancing, others bu<U+017F>y'd in fetching
and carrying of Water from the River: They
had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>py'd us, but they <U+017F>et up a loud
Cry, that frighted us at fir<U+017F>t; we thought it had
been for tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hou'd kill us, but it <U+017F>eems
it was of Wonder and Amazement. They were
all Naked; and we were Dre<U+017F>s'd, <U+017F>o as is mo<U+017F>t
commode for the hot Countries, very Glittering
and Rich; <U+017F>o that we appear'd extremely fine;
my own Hair was cut <U+017F>hort, and I had a Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faty
Cap, with Black Feathers, on my Head;
my Brother was in a Stuff Sute, with Silver
Loops and Buttons, and abundance of Green
Ribbon: This was all infinitely <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing to
them; and becau<U+017F>e we <U+017F>aw them <U+017F>tand <U+017F>till till
we approach'd 'em, we took heart and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd,
came up to 'em, and offer'd 'em our
Hands; which they took, and look'd on us round
about, calling <U+017F>till for more Company; who
came <U+017F>warming out, all wondering, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out <hi>Tepeeme;</hi> taking their Hair up in their
Hands, and <U+017F>preading it wide to tho<U+017F>e they
call'd out to; as if they wou'd <U+017F>ay (as indeed
it <U+017F>ignify'd) <hi>Numberle<U+017F>s Wonders,</hi> or not to be
recounted, no more than to number the Hair
of their Heads. By degrees they grew more
bold, and from gazing upon us round, they
touch'd us, laying their Hands upon all the
Features of our Faces, feeling our Brea<U+017F>ts and
Arms, taking up one Petticoat, then wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <U+017F>ee another; admiring our Shooes and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47213:73"/>
Stockings, but more our Garters, which we
gave 'em, and they ty'd about their Legs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lac'd with Silver Lace at the ends; for they
much e<U+017F>teem any <U+017F>hining things: In fine, we
<U+017F>uffer'd 'em to <U+017F>urvey us as they pleas'd, and
we thought they wou'd never have done ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
us. When <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aw we
were receiv'd with <U+017F>uch wonder, they came
up to us; and finding the <hi>Indian</hi> Trader whom
they knew, (for 'tis by the<U+017F>e Fi<U+017F>hermen, call'd
<hi>Indian</hi> Traders, we hold a Commerce with 'em;
for they love not to go far from home, and we
never go to them;) when they <U+017F>aw him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they <U+017F>et up a new Joy, and cry'd, in their
language, <hi>Oh! here's our</hi> Tiguamy, <hi>and we <U+017F>hall
now know whether tho<U+017F>e things can <U+017F>peak:</hi> So advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to him, <U+017F>ome of 'em gave 'em their Hands,
and cry'd, <hi>Amora Tiguamy;</hi> which is as much as,
<hi>How do you;</hi> or, <hi>Welcome, Friend:</hi> and all, with
one din, began to gabble to him, and ask'd, if we
had Sen<U+017F>e and Wit? if we could talk of Affairs
of Life and War, as they cou'd do? if we cou'd
Hunt, Swim, and do a thou<U+017F>and things they u<U+017F>e?
He an<U+017F>wer'd 'em, We cou'd. Then they invited
us into their Hou<U+017F>es, and dre<U+017F>s'd Veni<U+017F>on and
<hi>Buffelo</hi> for us; and, going out, gather'd a Leaf
of a Tree, call'd a <hi>Sarumbo</hi> Leaf, of <U+017F>ix Yards
long, and <U+017F>pread it on the Ground for a Table-Cloth;
and cutting another in pieces, in<U+017F>tead of
Plates, <U+017F>etting us on little bow <hi>Indian</hi> Stools,
which they cut out of one entire piece of Wood,
and paint in a <U+017F>ort of Japan-work: They
<U+017F>erve every one their Me<U+017F>s on the<U+017F>e pieces of
Leaves; and it was very good, but too high
<U+017F>ea<U+017F>on'd with Pepper. When we had eat, my
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47213:73"/>
Brother and I took out our Flutes, and play'd
to 'em, which gave 'em new Wonder; and I
<U+017F>oon perceiv'd, by an Admiration that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to the<U+017F>e People, and by the extreme Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Simplicity of 'em, it were not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h any unknown or extravagaut
Religion among them, and to impo<U+017F>e any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Fictions upon 'em. For <U+017F>eeing a Kin<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of mine <U+017F>et <U+017F>ome Paper a fire with a Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-gla<U+017F>s,
a Trick they had never before <U+017F>een,
they were like to have ador'd him for a God,
and begg'd he wou'd give 'em the Characters
or Figures of his Name, that they might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
it again<U+017F>t Winds and Storms: which he
did, and they held it up in tho<U+017F>e Sea<U+017F>ons, and
fancy'd it had a Charm to conquer them, and
kept it like a holy Relique. They are very
Super<U+017F>titious, and call'd him the Great <hi>Peeie,</hi>
that is, <hi>Prophet.</hi> They <U+017F>hew'd us their <hi>Indian
Peeie,</hi> a Youth of about Sixteen Years old, as
hand<U+017F>om as Nature cou'd make a Man. They
con<U+017F>ecrate a beautiful Youth from his Infancy,
and all Arts are u<U+017F>ed to compleat him in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t
manner, both in Beauty and Shape: He
is bred to all the little Arts and Cunning they
are capable of; to all the Legerdemain Tricks,
and Slight of Hand, whereby he impo<U+017F>es upon
the Rabble; and is both a Doctor in Phy<U+017F>ick
and Divinity: And by the<U+017F>e Tricks makes the
Sick believe he <U+017F>ometimes ea<U+017F>es their Pains, by
drawing from the afflicted part little Serpents,
or odd Flies, or Worms, or any <U+017F>trange thing;
and though they have be<U+017F>ides undoubted good
Remedies for almo<U+017F>t all their Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, they
cure the Patient more by Fancy than by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47213:74"/>
and make them<U+017F>elves Fear'd, Lov'd,
and Reverenc'd. This young <hi>Peeie</hi> had a
very young Wife, who <U+017F>eeing my Brother ki<U+017F>s
her, came running and ki<U+017F>s'd me: after this
they ki<U+017F>s'd one another, and made it a very
great Je<U+017F>t, it being <U+017F>o novel; and new<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Laughing went round the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
that they never will forget that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
never before us'd or known. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> had
a mind to <U+017F>ee and talk with their War-<hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
and we were conducted to one of their
Hou<U+017F>es; where we beheld <U+017F>everal of the great
<hi>Captains,</hi> who had been at Council: But <U+017F>o
frightful a Vi<U+017F>ion it was to <U+017F>ee 'em no Fancy
can create; no <U+017F>ad Dreams can repre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>o
dreadful a Spectacle. For my part, I took 'em
for Hobgoblins, or Fiends, rather than Men:
but however their Shapes appear'd, their Souls
were very Humane and Noble; but <U+017F>ome wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their No<U+017F>es, <U+017F>ome their Lips, <U+017F>ome both
No<U+017F>es and Lips, <U+017F>ome their Ears, and others
cut through each Cheek, with long Sla<U+017F>hes,
through which their Teeth appear'd: they had
other <U+017F>everal formidable Wounds and Scars,
or rather Di<U+017F>membrings: they had <hi>Comitia's,</hi>
or little Aprons before 'em; and Girdles of
Cotton, with their Knives naked <U+017F>tuck in it;
a Bow at their Backs, and a Quiver of Arrows
on their Thighs; and mo<U+017F>t had Feathers on
their Heads of divers Colours. They cry'd
<hi>Amora Tigame</hi> to us, at our entrance, and were
pleas'd we <U+017F>aid as much to them: They <U+017F>eated
us, and gave us Drink of the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>ort, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
as much as the others had done before,
to <U+017F>ee us. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> was marvelling as much at
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47213:74"/>
their Faces, wondring how they <U+017F>hou'd all
be <U+017F>o wounded in War; he was impatient to
know how they all came by tho<U+017F>e frightful
Marks of Rage or Malice, rather than Wounds
got in noble Battle: They told us, by our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
That when any War was waging,
two Men, cho<U+017F>en out by <U+017F>ome old <hi>Captain</hi> who<U+017F>e
Fighting was pa<U+017F>t, and who cou'd only teach
the Theory of War, the<U+017F>e two Men were to
<U+017F>tand in competition for the General<U+017F>hip, or
Great War-Captain; and being brought before
the old Judges, now pa<U+017F>t Labour, they are ask'd,
What they dare do, to <U+017F>hew they are worthy to
lead an Army? When he who is fir<U+017F>t ask'd,
making no Reply, cuts off his No<U+017F>e, and throws
it contemptibly on the Ground; and the other
does <U+017F>omething to him<U+017F>elf that he thinks <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>es
him, and perhaps deprives him<U+017F>elf of
Lips and an Eye; <U+017F>o they Sla<U+017F>h on till one gives
out, and many have dy'd in this Debate. And
it's by a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive Valour they <U+017F>hew and prove their
Activity; a <U+017F>ort of Courage too Brutal to be
applauded by our <hi>Black</hi> Hero; neverthele<U+017F>s, he

                  <p>In this Voyage <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> begot <U+017F>o good an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding

that there were no more Fears or Heart-burnings
during our <U+017F>tay, but we had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
open, and free Trade with 'em. Many
things remarkable, and worthy reciting, we
met with in this <U+017F>hort Voyage; becau<U+017F>e <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>
made it his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>earch out and provide
for our Entertainment, e<U+017F>pecially to plea<U+017F>e his

her Chains as ea<U+017F>ie as we cou'd, and to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
the Prince in that manner that mo<U+017F>t
oblig'd him.</p>
                  <p>As we were coming up again, we met with
<U+017F>ome <hi>Indians</hi> of <U+017F>trange A<U+017F>pects; that is, of a
larger Size, and other <U+017F>ort of Features, than
tho<U+017F>e of our Countrey: Our <hi>Indian Slaves,</hi> that
row'd us, ask'd 'em <U+017F>ome Que<U+017F>tions; but they
cou'd not under<U+017F>tand us, but <U+017F>hew'd us a long
Cotton String, with <U+017F>everal Knots on it, and
told us, they had been coming from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<U+017F>o many Moons as there were Knots; they
were habited in Skins of a <U+017F>trange Bea<U+017F>t, and
brought along with 'em Bags of Gold Du<U+017F>t;
which, as well as they cou'd give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand,
came <U+017F>treaming in little <U+017F>mall Chanels
down the high Mountains, when the Rains fell;
and offer'd to be the Convoy to any Body, or
Per<U+017F>ons, that wou'd go to the Mountains. We
carry'd the<U+017F>e Men up to <hi>Parham,</hi> where they were
kept till the Lord-Governor came: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
all the Country was mad to be going on
this Golden Adventure, the Governor, by his
Letters, commanded (for they <U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome of the
Gold to him) that a Guard <U+017F>hou'd be <U+017F>et at the
mouth of the River of <hi>Amazons</hi> (a River <U+017F>o call'd,
almo<U+017F>t as broad as the River of <hi>Thames</hi>) and
prohibited all People from going up that River,
it conducting to tho<U+017F>e Mountains of Gold. But
we going off for <hi>England</hi> before the Project was
further pro<U+017F>ecuted, and the Governor being
drown'd in a Hurricane, either the De<U+017F>ign dy'd,
or the <hi>Dutch</hi> have the Advantage of it: And 'tis
to be bemoan'd what His Maje<U+017F>ty lo<U+017F>t, by lo<U+017F>ing

Though this Digre<U+017F><U+017F>ion is a little from my
Story; however, <U+017F>ince it contains <U+017F>ome Proofs
of the Curio<U+017F>ity and Daring of this Great Man,
I was content to omit nothing of his Character.</p>
                  <p>It was thus for <U+017F>ome time we diverted him;
but now <hi>Imoinda</hi> began to <U+017F>hew <U+017F>he was with
Child, and did nothing but <U+017F>igh and weep for
the Captivity of her Lord, her <U+017F>elf, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant

hard to gain the Liberty of Two, 'twou'd be
more difficult to get that for Three. Her Griefs
were <U+017F>o many Darts in the great Heart of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar;</hi>

were abundance of <U+017F>everal Trades, and <hi>Slaves</hi>

he went, pretending out of goodne<U+017F>s to 'em, to
Fea<U+017F>t among 'em, and <U+017F>ent all his Mu<U+017F>ick, and
order'd a great Treat for the whole Gang, about
Three hundred <hi>Negroes,</hi> and about an Hundred

had, which were <U+017F>ufficient to do execution with
Spirits accordingly: For the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> had none

to 'em, of the Mi<U+017F>eries and Ignominies of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
counting up all their Toils and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
under <U+017F>uch Loads, Burdens and Drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as were fitter for Bea<U+017F>ts than Men; Sen<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s

it was not for Days, Months or Years, but
for Eternity; there was no end to be of their
Misfortunes: They <U+017F>uffer'd not like Men who
might find a Glory and Fortitude in Oppre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion;
but like Dogs that lov'd the Whip and

That they had lo<U+017F>t the Divine Quality of Men,
and were become in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible A<U+017F><U+017F>es, fit only to

Villainous, Sen<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s Men, <U+017F>uch as they, Toil'd

This wou'd not anger a Noble Heart; this wou'd

Countries for Rapine, Murders, Theft and Villanies:
Do you not hear, every day, how they upbraid each other

no Man wou'd pretend to that, without all the Acts
of Vertue, Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, Charity, Love, Ju<U+017F>tice and
Rea<U+017F>on; he found it not incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with that, to
take an equal care of their Wives and Children, as
they wou'd of them<U+017F>elves; and that he did not de<U+017F>ign,
when he led them to Freedom, and Glorious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
that they <U+017F>hou'd leave that better part of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47213:77"/>
to peri<U+017F>h by the Hand of the Tyrant's Whip:
But if there were a Woman among them <U+017F>o degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

the pur<U+017F>uit of her Husband, and with the hazard of
her Life, to <U+017F>hare with him in his Fortunes; that
<U+017F>uch an one ought to be abandon'd, and left as a
Prey to the Common Enemy.</p>
                  <p>To which they all Agreed,—and Bowed.
After this, he <U+017F>poke of the impa<U+017F><U+017F>able Woods
and Rivers; and convinc'd 'em, the more Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the more Glory. He told them, that he had
heard of one <hi>Hannibal</hi> a great Captain, had cut
his way through Mountains of <U+017F>olid Rocks;
and <U+017F>hou'd a few Shrubs oppo<U+017F>e them, which
they cou'd fire before 'em? No, 'twas a trifling
Excu<U+017F>e to Men re<U+017F>olv'd to die, or overcome.
As for Bogs, they are with a little Labour fill'd
and harden'd; and the Rivers cou'd be no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tacle,
<U+017F>ince they <U+017F>wam by Nature, at lea<U+017F>t, by
Cu<U+017F>tom, from the fir<U+017F>t hour of their birth:
That when the Children were weary, they mu<U+017F>t
carry them by turns, and the Woods and their
own Indu<U+017F>try wou'd afford them Food. To
this they all a<U+017F><U+017F>ented with Joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tu<U+017F>can</hi> then demanded, what he wou'd do?
He <U+017F>aid they wou'd Travel towards the Sea,
Plant a New Colony, and Defend it by their
Valour; and when they cou'd find a Ship, either
driven by <U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of Weather, or guided by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that way, they wou'd <U+017F>eize it, and
make it a Prize, till it had tran<U+017F>ported them to
their own Countries; at lea<U+017F>t, they <U+017F>hou'd be
made Free in his Kingdom, and be e<U+017F>teem'd as
his Fellow-<U+017F>ufferers, and Men that had the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and the Bravery to attempt, at lea<U+017F>t, for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47213:77"/>
Liberty; and if they dy'd in the attempt, it
wou'd be more brave, than to live in perpetual
Slavery.</p>
                  <p>They bow'd and ki<U+017F>s'd his Feet at this Re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and with one accord Vow'd to follow
him to Death. And that Night was appointed
to begin their March, they made it known to
their Wives, and directed them to tie their
Hamaca about their Shoulders, and under their
Arm, like a Scarf; and to lead their Children
that cou'd go, and carry tho<U+017F>e that cou'd not.
The Wives, who pay an entire Obedience to
their Husbands, obey'd, and <U+017F>tay'd for 'em where
they were appointed: The Men <U+017F>tay'd but to
furni<U+017F>h them<U+017F>elves with what defen<U+017F>ive Arms
they cou'd get; and All met at the Rendezvous,
where <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> made a new encouraging Speech to
'em, and led 'em out.</p>
                  <p>But as they cou'd not march far that Night,
on <hi>Monday</hi> early, when the Over<U+017F>eers went to
call 'em all together, to go to work, they
were extremely <U+017F>urpriz'd, to find not one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Place, but all fled with what Baggage
they had. You may imagine this News was
not only <U+017F>uddenly <U+017F>pread all over the <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but <U+017F>oon reach'd the neighbouring ones;
and we had by Noon about Six hundred Men
they call the Militia of the Country, that came

But never did one <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o comical an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

Fa<U+017F>hion wou'd not concern them<U+017F>elves, though
it were almo<U+017F>t the Common Cau<U+017F>e; for <U+017F>uch
Revoltings are very ill Examples, and have
very fatal Con<U+017F>equences, often-times, in many

they call'd tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Parham Plantation;</hi>) becau<U+017F>e
they did not, in the fir<U+017F>t place, love the Lord-Governor;
and, <U+017F>econdly, they wou'd have

who was the mo<U+017F>t fawning fair-Tongu'd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

violent Man again<U+017F>t him; and though he had
nothing, and <U+017F>o need fear nothing, yet talk'd
and look'd bigger than any Man: He was a

wou'd lead his Army forth to meet <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi>
or rather to pur<U+017F>ue him: mo<U+017F>t of their Arms

others had long Staffs and Clubs. Mr. <hi>Trefry</hi>
went along<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> rather to be a Mediator than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
in <U+017F>uch a Battle; for he fore<U+017F>aw, and
knew, if by fighting they put the <hi>Negroes</hi> into
de<U+017F>pair, they were a <U+017F>ort of <U+017F>ullen Fellows, that
wou'd drown or kill them<U+017F>elves, before they
wou'd yield; and he advis'd, that fair means was
be<U+017F>t: But <hi>Byam</hi> was one that abounded in his

It was not hard to find the<U+017F>e Fugitives; for
as they fled, they were forc'd to fire and cut
the Woods before 'em; <U+017F>o that Night or Day
they pur<U+017F>u'd 'em by the Light they made, and
by the Path they had clear'd. But as <U+017F>oon as
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> found he was pur<U+017F>u'd, he put him<U+017F>elf in
a po<U+017F>ture of Defence, placing all the Women
and Children in the Rear; and him<U+017F>elf, with
<hi>Tu<U+017F>can</hi> by his <U+017F>ide, or next to him, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ing

wounded a good many; they having recour<U+017F>e

And as they ob<U+017F>erv'd no Order, they perplex'd

Yield, and leave</hi> Cae<U+017F>ar <hi>to their Revenge;</hi> that by

cou'd overcome all them, with all the

had perceiv'd that was the common way of

the <hi>Whites.</hi> All this was perform'd, and <hi>Tu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>'s
Pardon was put in, and they Surrender
to the Governor, who walked peaceably down
into the <hi>Plantation</hi> with 'em, after giving Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to bury their Dead. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> was very much

fought like a Fury; and what Mi<U+017F>chief was

gave their Enemies a fatal Proof, that they

Terrible to behold.</p>
                  <p>When they thought they were <U+017F>ufficiently
Reveng'd on him, they unty'd him, almo<U+017F>t
fainting with lo<U+017F>s of Blood, from a thou<U+017F>and
Wounds all over his Body; from which they
had rent his Cloaths, and led him Bleeding
and Naked as he was, and loaded him all over
with Irons, and then rubb'd his Wounds, to
compleat their Cruelty, with <hi>Indian</hi> Pepper;
which had like to have made him raving Mad;
and, in this Condition, made him <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t to
the Ground, that he cou'd not <U+017F>tir, if his
Pains and Wounds wou'd have given him leave.
They <U+017F>par'd <hi>Imoinda,</hi> and did not let her <U+017F>ee
this Barbarity committed towards her Lord,
but carry'd her down to <hi>Parham,</hi> and <U+017F>hut her

                  <p>You mu<U+017F>t know, that when the News was
brought, on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> had
betaken him<U+017F>elf to the Woods, and carry'd
with him all the <hi>Negroes,</hi> we were po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd
with extreme Fear, which no Per<U+017F>ua<U+017F>ions

till Night; and then, that he wou'd come
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47213:81"/>
down and cut all our Throats. This Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ion
made all the Females of us fly down
the River, to be <U+017F>ecur'd; and while we were
away, they acted this Cruelty: For I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e,
I had Authority and Intere<U+017F>t enough there,
had I <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected any <U+017F>uch thing, to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it; but we had not gone many Leagues,
but the News overtook us, that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and whipp'd like a common <hi>Slave.</hi> We
met, on the River, with Colonel <hi>Martin,</hi> a Man
of great Gallantry, Wit and Goodne<U+017F>s, and
whom I have celebrated in a Character of my
New <hi>Comedy,</hi> by his own Name, in Memory
of <U+017F>o Brave a Man: He was Wi<U+017F>e and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and, from the finene<U+017F>s of his Parts,
bore a great Sway over the Hearts of all the
<hi>Colony:</hi> He was a Friend to <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> and re<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this fal<U+017F>e Dealing with him very much.
We carry'd him back to <hi>Parham,</hi> thinking to
have made an Accommodation. When he
came, the fir<U+017F>t News we heard, was, That the
<hi>Governor</hi> was dead of a Wound <hi>Imoinda</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him; but it was not <U+017F>o well: But it <U+017F>eems,
he wou'd have the Plea<U+017F>ure of beholding the
Revenge he took on <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar;</hi> and before the cruel
Ceremony was fini<U+017F>h'd, he dropt down; and
then they perceiv'd the Wound he had on his
Shoulder was by a venom'd Arrow; which, as
I <U+017F>aid, his <hi>Indian</hi> Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s heal'd, by <U+017F>ucking the
Wound.</p>
                  <p>We were no <U+017F>ooner arriv'd, but we went
up to the <hi>Plantation</hi> to <U+017F>ee <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar;</hi> whom we
found in a very mi<U+017F>erable and unexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible
Condition; and I have a thou<U+017F>and times
admir'd how he liv'd in <U+017F>o much tormenting

Pain. We <U+017F>aid all things to him, that Trouble,
Pity and Good Nature cou'd <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>ting

as many Pardons for the Offenders, till
we <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o much, that he believ'd we had

He cou'd never pardon <hi>Byam;</hi> as for <hi>Trefry,</hi>
he confe<U+017F>s'd he <U+017F>aw his Grief and Sorrow for
his Suffering, which he cou'd not hinder, but

for <hi>Byam,</hi> who was their Leader, their

of him; and <U+017F>aid, <hi>It had been well for
him, if he had Sacrific'd me, in<U+017F>tead of giving
me the contemptible Whip.</hi> He refus'd to talk
much; but begging us to give him our Hands,
he took 'em, and prote<U+017F>ted never to lift up his,
to do us any harm. He had a great Re<U+017F>pect
for Colonel <hi>Martin,</hi> and always took his
Coun<U+017F>el like that of a Parent; and a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd
him, He wou'd obey him in any thing, but
his Revenge on <hi>Byam: Therefore</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) <hi>for
his own <U+017F>afety, let him <U+017F>peedily di<U+017F>patch me; for if
I cou'd di<U+017F>patch my <U+017F>elf, I wou'd not, till that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice
were done to my injur'd Per<U+017F>on, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of a Soldier: No, I wou'd not kill my <U+017F>elf,
even after a Whipping, but will be content to live
with that Infamy, and be pointed at by every grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Slave, till I have compleated my Revenge;
and then you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, that</hi> Oroonoko <hi><U+017F>corns to live

with the Indignity that was put on</hi> Cae<U+017F>ar. All
we cou'd do, cou'd get no more Words from
him; and we took care to have him put imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
into a healing Bath, to rid him of his
Pepper, and order'd a Chirurgeon to anoint
him with healing Balm; which he <U+017F>uffer'd, and
in <U+017F>ome time he began to be able to Walk and
Eat. We fail'd not to vi<U+017F>it him every Day,

at the very Council-Table, wou'd Contradict
and Fight with one another; and Swear <U+017F>o
bloodily, that 'twas terrible to hear and <U+017F>ee
'em. (Some of 'em were afterwards Hang'd,

they all concluded, that (Damn 'em) it might

be made an Example to all the <hi>Negroes,</hi> to

and told <hi>Byam,</hi> his Command did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to his Lord's <hi>Plantation;</hi> and that <hi>Parham</hi>
was as much exempt from the Law as <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall;</hi>
and that they ought no more to touch
the Servants of the Lord—(who there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ented
the King's Per<U+017F>on) than they cou'd
tho<U+017F>e about the King him<U+017F>elf; and that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was a Sanctuary; and though his Lord
were ab<U+017F>ent in Per<U+017F>on, his Power was <U+017F>till in
Being there; which he had entru<U+017F>ted with
him, as far as the Dominions of his particular

the re<U+017F>t of the Country, as <hi>Byam</hi> was Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

So turning the Governor, and his wi<U+017F>e Council,
out of Doors, (for they <U+017F>at at <hi>Parham-hou<U+017F>e</hi>)
we <U+017F>et a Guard upon our Landing-place, and

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Governor</hi> having remain'd wounded at
<hi>Parham,</hi> till his Recovery was compleated,
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> did not know but he was <U+017F>till there, and
indeed, for the mo<U+017F>t part, his time was <U+017F>pent
there; for he was one that lov'd to live at other
Peoples Expence, and if he were a Day ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent,
he was Ten pre<U+017F>ent there; and us'd to
Play, and Walk, and Hunt and Fi<U+017F>h with

an opportunity of being reveng'd on him:
Though, after <U+017F>uch a Revenge, he cou'd not

<hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Mobile, who perhaps wou'd have been
glad of the occa<U+017F>ion to have kill'd him, he was
re<U+017F>olv'd not to <U+017F>urvive his Whipping; yet he
had <U+017F>ome tender Hours, a repenting Softne<U+017F>s,
which he call'd his Fits of Cowardice; wherein
he <U+017F>truggl'd with Love for the Victory of his
Heart, which took part with his charming <hi>Imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inda</hi>
there: but, for the mo<U+017F>t part, his time
was pa<U+017F>t in melancholy Thought, and black
De<U+017F>igns; he con<U+017F>ider'd, if he <U+017F>hou'd do this
Deed, and die either in the Attempt, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it, he left his lovely <hi>Imoinda</hi> a Prey, or at
be<U+017F>t a <hi>Slave,</hi> to the enrag'd Multitude: His
great Heart cou'd not endure that Thought:
<hi>Perhaps</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) <hi><U+017F>he may be first Ravi<U+017F>h'd by
every Brute; expo<U+017F>ed fir<U+017F>t to their na<U+017F>ty Lu<U+017F>ts, and
then a <U+017F>hameful Death:</hi> No, he cou'd not live
a moment under that Apprehen<U+017F>ion, too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>upportable
to be borne. The<U+017F>e were his
Thoughts, and his <U+017F>ilent Arguments with his
Heart, as he told us afterwards: <U+017F>o that now
re<U+017F>olving not only to kill <hi>Byam,</hi> but all tho<U+017F>e
he thought had enrag'd him; plea<U+017F>ing his great
Heart with the fancy'd Slaughter he <U+017F>hou'd
make over the whole face of the <hi>Plantation;</hi>
he fir<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olv'd on a Deed, that (however
Horrid it fir<U+017F>t appear'd to us all) when we had
heard his Rea<U+017F>ons, we thought it Brave and
Ju<U+017F>t. Being able to walk, and, as he believ'd,
fit for the execution of his great De<U+017F>ign, he
begg'd <hi>Trefry</hi> to tru<U+017F>t him into the Air, believing
a Walk wou'd do him good. Which was
granted him; and taking <hi>Imoinda</hi> with him, as
he us'd to do in his more happy and calmer
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47213:83"/>
Days, he led her up into a Wood, where,
after (with a thou<U+017F>and Sighs, and long gazing
<U+017F>ilently on her Face, while Tears gu<U+017F>ht, in
<U+017F>pite of him, from his Eyes) he told her his
De<U+017F>ign, fir<U+017F>t of killing her, and then his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and next him<U+017F>elf, and the impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility
of e<U+017F>caping, and therefore he told her the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity
of Dying. He found the Heroick Wife
fa<U+017F>ter pleading for Death than he was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
it, when <U+017F>he found his fix'd Re<U+017F>olution;
and, on her Knees, be<U+017F>ought him not to leave
her a Prey to his Enemies. He (griev'd to
Death) yet pleas'd at her noble Re<U+017F>olution,
took her up, and embracing her with all the
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion and Langui<U+017F>hment of a dying Lover,
drew his Knife to kill this Trea<U+017F>ure of his Soul,
this Plea<U+017F>ure of his Eyes; while Tears trickl'd
down his Cheeks, hers were <U+017F>miling with Joy
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd die by <U+017F>o noble a Hand, and be
<U+017F>ent into her own Countrey, (for that's their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the next World) by him <U+017F>he <U+017F>o ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Lov'd, and <U+017F>o truly Ador'd in this. For
Wives have a Re<U+017F>pect for their Husbands equal
to what any other People pay a Deity: And
when a Man finds any occa<U+017F>ion to quit his
Wife, if he love her, <U+017F>he dies by his Hand;
if not, he <U+017F>ells her, or <U+017F>uffers <U+017F>ome other to kill
her. It being thus, you may believe the Deed
was <U+017F>oon re<U+017F>olv'd on; and 'tis not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but the Parting, the eternal Leave taking
of Two <U+017F>uch Lovers, <U+017F>o greatly Born, <U+017F>o Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible,
<U+017F>o Beautiful, <U+017F>o Young, and <U+017F>o Fond,

All that Love cou'd <U+017F>ay in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es, being
ended, and all the intermitting Irre<U+017F>olutions
being adju<U+017F>ted, the Lovely, Young and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
Victim lays her <U+017F>elf down before the
Sacrificer; while he, with a Hand re<U+017F>olv'd, and
a Heart-breaking within, gave the fatal Stroke;
fir<U+017F>t cutting her Throat, and then <U+017F>evering her
yet <U+017F>miling Face from that delicate Body, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
as it was with the Fruits of tend're<U+017F>t Love.
As <U+017F>oon as he had done, he laid the Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
on Leaves and Flowers, of which he
made a Bed, and conceal'd it under the <U+017F>ame
Cover-lid of Nature, only her Face he left
yet bare to look on: But when he found <U+017F>he
was Dead, and pa<U+017F>t all Retrieve, never more

A thou<U+017F>and times he turn'd the fatal Knife that
did the Deed toward his own Heart, with a

dire Revenge, which was now a thou<U+017F>and

him, and he wou'd cry out; <hi>No, <U+017F>ince I

Name, Grief wou'd get the a<U+017F>cendant of
Rage, and he wou'd lie down by her Side,
and water her Face with <U+017F>howers of Tears,
which never were wont to fall from tho<U+017F>e

the Sight of this dear Object, now more Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd,
and more Ador'd than ever.</p>
                  <p>He remain'd in this deplorable Condition
for two Days, and never ro<U+017F>e from the Ground
where he had made his <U+017F>ad Sacrifice; at la<U+017F>t,
rouzing from her <U+017F>ide, and accu<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf
with living too long, now <hi>Imoinda</hi> was dead,
and that the Deaths of tho<U+017F>e barbarous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were deferr'd too long, he re<U+017F>olv'd now
to fini<U+017F>h the Great Work; but offering to ri<U+017F>e,
he found his Strength <U+017F>o decay'd, that he reel'd
to and fro, like Boughs a<U+017F><U+017F>ail'd by contrary
Winds; <U+017F>o that he was forced to lie down
again, and try to <U+017F>ummon all his Courage to
his Aid; he found his Brains turn'd round, and
his Eyes were dizzy, and Objects appear'd not
the <U+017F>ame to him they were wont to do; his
Breath was <U+017F>hort, and all his Limbs <U+017F>urprized
with a Faintne<U+017F>s he had never felt before: He
had not eat in two Days, which was one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
of this Feeblene<U+017F>s, but exce<U+017F>s of Grief
was the greate<U+017F>t; yet <U+017F>till he hop'd he <U+017F>hou'd
recover Vigour to act his De<U+017F>ign, and lay expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
it yet <U+017F>ix days longer; <U+017F>till mourning over
the dead Idol of his Heart, and <U+017F>triving every
day to ri<U+017F>e, but cou'd not.</p>
                  <p>In all this time you may believe we were in
no little affliction for <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> and his Wife;
<U+017F>ome were of opinion he was e<U+017F>cap'd, never
to return; others thought <U+017F>ome Accident had
hap'ned to him: But however, we fail'd not
to <U+017F>end out an hundred People <U+017F>everal ways, to
<U+017F>earch for him: A Party of about forty went
that way he took, among whom was <hi>Tu<U+017F>can,</hi>
who was perfectly reconcil'd to <hi>Byam:</hi> They
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47213:85"/>
had not gone very far into the Wood, but
they <U+017F>melt an unu<U+017F>ual Smell, as of a dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
for Stinks mu<U+017F>t be very noi<U+017F>om, that can

Sweets, as every Inch of that Land pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces.
So that they concluded they <U+017F>hou'd
find him dead, or <U+017F>ome body that was <U+017F>o;
they pa<U+017F>s'd on towards it, as loath<U+017F>om as it was,
and made <U+017F>uch a ru<U+017F>ling among the Leaves,
that lie thick on the Ground, by continual
falling, that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> heard he was approach'd;
and though he had, during the <U+017F>pace of the<U+017F>e
eight Days, endeavour'd to ri<U+017F>e, but found he
wanted Strength; yet looking up, and <U+017F>eeing
his Pur<U+017F>uers, he ro<U+017F>e, and reel'd to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Tree, again<U+017F>t which he fix'd his Back;
and being within a dozen Yards of tho<U+017F>e that
advanc'd and <U+017F>aw him, he call'd out to them,
and bid them approach no nearer, if they
wou'd be <U+017F>afe. So that they <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till, and
hardly believing their Eyes, that wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uade
them that it was <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> that <U+017F>poke to
'em, <U+017F>o much was he alter'd, they ask'd him,
what he had done with his Wife, for they
<U+017F>melt a Stink that almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>truck them dead?
He, pointing to the dead Body, <U+017F>ighing, cry'd,
<hi>Behold her there.</hi> They put off the Flowers
that cover'd her, with their Sticks, and found
<U+017F>he was kill'd, and cry'd out, <hi>Oh, Mon<U+017F>ter!
that hast murther'd thy Wife.</hi> Then asking
him, why he did <U+017F>o cruel a Deed? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
He had no lei<U+017F>ure to an<U+017F>wer imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Que<U+017F>tions: <hi>You may go back</hi> (continu'd
he) <hi>and tell the faithle<U+017F>s Governor, he may thank
Fortune that I am breathing my last; and that my

Arm is too feeble to obey my Heart, in what it
had de<U+017F>ign'd him:</hi> But his Tongue faultering,
and trembling, he cou'd <U+017F>carce end what he
was <U+017F>aying. The <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> taking Advantage
by his Weakne<U+017F>s, cry'd, <hi>Let us take him alive by
all means.</hi> He heard 'em; and, as if he had
reviv'd from a Fainting; or a Dream, he cry'd
out, <hi>No, Gentlemen, you are deceiv'd; you will
find no more</hi> Cae<U+017F>ars <hi>to be Whipt; no more find a
Faith in me: Feeble as you think me, I have
Strength yet left to <U+017F>ecure me from a <U+017F>econd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity.</hi>
They <U+017F>wore all a-new; and he only
<U+017F>hook his Head, and beheld them with Scorn.
Then they cry'd out, <hi>Who will venture on this
<U+017F>ingle Man? Will no body?</hi> They <U+017F>tood all <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
while <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> replied, <hi>Fatal will be the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

<U+017F>aid he, <hi>'tis not Life I <U+017F>eek, nor am I afraid of
Dying,</hi> (and at that word, cut a piece of
Fle<U+017F>h from his own Throat, and threw it at
'em,) <hi>yet <U+017F>till I wou'd Live if I cou'd, till I had
perfected my Revenge: But, oh! it cannot be; I
feel Life gliding from my Eyes and Heart; and
if I make not ha<U+017F>te, I <U+017F>hall yet fall a Victim to
the <U+017F>hameful Whip.</hi> At that, he rip'd up his own
Belly, and took his Bowels and pull'd 'em out,
with what Strength he cou'd; while <U+017F>ome,
on their Knees imploring, be<U+017F>ought him to
hold his Hand. But when they <U+017F>aw him tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
they cry'd out, <hi>Will none venture on him?</hi>
A bold <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> cry'd, <hi>Yes, if he were the Devil,</hi>
(taking Courage when he <U+017F>aw him almo<U+017F>t
Dead) and <U+017F>wearing a horrid Oath for his

Farewell to the World, he ru<U+017F>h'd on him. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>
with his Arm'd Hand met him <U+017F>o fairly, as
<U+017F>tuck him to the Heart, and he fell dead at his
Feet. <hi>Tu<U+017F>can</hi> <U+017F>eeing that, cry'd out, <hi>I love thee,
O</hi> Cae<U+017F>ar! <hi>and therefore will not let thee die, if

Arms: but, at the <U+017F>ame time, warding a Blow
that <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> made at his Bo<U+017F>om, he receiv'd it
quite through his Arm; and <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> having not
the <U+017F>trength to pluck the Knife forth, tho' he
attempted it, <hi>Tu<U+017F>can</hi> neither pull'd it out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
nor <U+017F>uffer'd it to be pull'd out, but came
down with it <U+017F>ticking in his Arm; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
he gave for it, was, becau<U+017F>e the Air <U+017F>hou'd
not get into the Wound. They put their
Hands a-cro<U+017F>s, and carry'd <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> between <U+017F>ix
of 'em, fainting as he was, and they thought
dead, or ju<U+017F>t dying; and they brought him
to <hi>Parham,</hi> and laid him on a Couch, and had
the Chirurgeon immediately to him, who dre<U+017F>t
his Wounds, and <U+017F>ow'd up his Belly, and us'd
means to bring him to life, which they ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
We ran all to <U+017F>ee him; and, if before
we thought him <U+017F>o beautiful a Sight, he was
now <U+017F>o alter'd, that his Face was like a Death's
Head black'd over; nothing but Teeth and
Eye-holes: For <U+017F>ome Days we <U+017F>uffer'd no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to <U+017F>peak to him, but cau<U+017F>ed Cordials to be
poured down his Throat; which <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained his
Life, and in <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even days he recover'd
his Sen<U+017F>es: For, you mu<U+017F>t know, that Wounds
are almo<U+017F>t to a Miracle cur'd in the <hi>Indies;</hi>

When he was well enough to <U+017F>peak, we
talk'd to him, and ask'd him <U+017F>ome Que<U+017F>tions
about his Wife, and the Rea<U+017F>ons why he kill'd
her; and he then told us what I have related
of that Re<U+017F>olution and of his Parting, and he
be<U+017F>ought us we wou'd let him die, and was
extremely afflicted to think it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible he
might live; he a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd us, if we did not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
him, he wou'd prove very fatal to a
great many. We <U+017F>aid all we cou'd to make
him live, and gave him new A<U+017F><U+017F>urances; but he
begg'd we wou'd not think <U+017F>o poorly of him,
or of his Love to <hi>Imoinda,</hi> to imagine we cou'd
flatter him to Life again: but the Chirurgeon
a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him he cou'd not live, and therefore
he need not fear. We were all (but <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi>)
afflicted at this News, and the Sight was ga<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
His Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was <U+017F>ad; and the earthly
Smell about him <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong, that I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uaded
to leave the place for <U+017F>ome time, (being
my <U+017F>elf but <U+017F>ickly, and very apt to fall into
Fits of dangerous Illne<U+017F>s upon any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Melancholy.) The Servants, and <hi>Trefry,</hi>
and the Chirurgeons, promis'd all to take what
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible care they cou'd of the Life of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar;</hi>

one of the Council, a Fellow of ab<U+017F>olute
Barbarity, and fit to execute any Villany, but
was Rich: He came up to <hi>Parham,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47213:87"/>
took <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> and had him carried to the
<U+017F>ame Po<U+017F>t where he was whip'd; and cau<U+017F>ing
him to be ty'd to it, and a great Fire made before
him, he told him, he <U+017F>hou'd die like a Dog,
as he was. <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> replied, this was the fir<U+017F>t
piece of Bravery that ever <hi>Bani<U+017F>ter</hi> did, and he
never <U+017F>poke Sence till he pronounc'd that Word;
and, if he wou'd keep it, he wou'd declare,
in the other World, that he was the only
Man, of all the <hi>Whites,</hi> that ever he heard
<U+017F>peak Truth. And turning to the Men that
bound him, he <U+017F>aid, <hi>My Friends, am I to Die, or
to be Whipt?</hi> And they cry'd; <hi>Whipt! No, you
<U+017F>hall not e<U+017F>cape <U+017F>o well.</hi> And then he reply'd,
<U+017F>miling, <hi>A Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing on thee;</hi> and a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd them,
they need not tie him, for he wou'd <U+017F>tand fix'd
like a Rock, and endure Death <U+017F>o as <U+017F>hou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

                  </p>
                  <p>He had learn'd to take Tobacco; and when
he was a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd he <U+017F>hou'd Die, he de<U+017F>ir'd they
wou'd give him a Pipe in his Mouth, ready
lighted; which they did: and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
came, and fir<U+017F>t out off his Members,
and threw them into the Fire; after that, with
an ill-favour'd Knife, they cut off his Ears and
his No<U+017F>e, and burn'd them; he <U+017F>till Smoak'd
on, as if nothing had touch'd him; then they
hack'd off one of his Arms, and <U+017F>till he bore
up, and held his Pipe; but at the cutting off
the other Arm, his Head <U+017F>unk, and his Pipe
dropt, and he gave up the Gho<U+017F>t, without a
Groan, or a Reproach. My Mother and Si<U+017F>ter

and <U+017F>often'd into Ridicule, the langui<U+017F>hing Turn,
the To<U+017F>s, and the Back-<U+017F>hake of the Perriwig,
is the direct Way to the Heart of the fine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on

he a<U+017F><U+017F>umes (every Hour) the Coxcomb.
The<U+017F>e are Love's Play-things, a <U+017F>ort of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
with whom he <U+017F>ports; and whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

his Hat under his Arm, while the other Hand
is put carele<U+017F>ly into his Bo<U+017F>om, as if laid upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47213:90"/>
his panting Heart; his Head a little bent to
one <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>upported with a world of Crevat-<U+017F>tring,
which he takes mighty care not to put
into di<U+017F>order; as one may gue<U+017F>s by a never-failing,
and horrid Stiffne<U+017F>s in his Neck; and
if he have an occa<U+017F>ion to look a<U+017F>ide, his whole
Body turns at the <U+017F>ame time, for fear the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Crevat or Perriwig: And <U+017F>ometimes the Glove
is well manag'd, and the white Hand di<U+017F>play'd.
Thus, with a thou<U+017F>and other little Motions and
Formalities, all in the common Place or Road

on whom Love can do no Miracle; and who

                  <p>Perhaps it will be urg'd, that <U+017F>ince no Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morpho<U+017F>is

There are in the Quiver of the God a great
many different Darts; <U+017F>ome that wound for a

Aim is Vertue, and who<U+017F>e End is Honour, that

                  <p>How far di<U+017F>tant Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions may be from one
another, I <U+017F>hall be able to make appear in the<U+017F>e
following Rules. I'll prove to you the <U+017F>trong
Effects of Love in <U+017F>ome unguarded and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
Hearts; where it rages beyond the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pirations
of <hi>a God all <U+017F>oft and gentle,</hi> and reigns
more like <hi>a Fury from Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not pretend here to entertain you with
a feign'd Story, or any thing piec'd together
with Romantick Accidents; but every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance,
to a Tittle, is Truth. To a great part
of the Main, I my<U+017F>elf was an Eye-witne<U+017F>s;
and what I did not <U+017F>ee, I was confirm'd of by
Actors in the Intrigue, holy Men, of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of St. <hi>Francis:</hi> But for the <U+017F>ake of <U+017F>ome of
her Relations, I <U+017F>hall give my <hi>Fair Jilt</hi> a feign'd

                  <p>You are to under<U+017F>tand, that in all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Countries, where Holy Orders are e<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli<U+017F>h'd,
there are abundance of differing kinds
of Religious, both of Men and Women: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:91"/>
the Women, there are tho<U+017F>e we call
<hi>Nuns,</hi> that make <U+017F>olemn Vows of perpetual
Cha<U+017F>tity: There are others who make but a
<U+017F>imple Vow, as, for five or ten Years, or more
or le<U+017F>s; and that time expir'd, they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
anew for longer time, or marry, or di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
of them<U+017F>elves as they <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee good; and
the<U+017F>e are ordinarily call'd <hi>Gallopping Nuns:</hi> Of
the<U+017F>e there are <U+017F>everal Orders; as, <hi>Chanone<U+017F><U+017F>es,
Begines, Que<U+017F>t's, Swart-Si<U+017F>ters,</hi> and <hi>Je<U+017F>uiti<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi>
with <U+017F>everal others I have forgot: Of tho<U+017F>e of

                  </p>
                  <p>The<U+017F>e Orders are taken up by the be<U+017F>t Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
of the Town, young Maids of Fortune,
who live together, not inclos'd, but in Palaces
that will hold about Fiften hundred or Two
thou<U+017F>and of the<U+017F>e <hi>Fille Devotes,</hi> where they
have a regulated Government, under a <U+017F>ort of
<hi>Abbe<U+017F>s,</hi> or <hi>Priore<U+017F>s;</hi> or rather, a <hi>Governante.</hi>
They are oblig'd to a Method of Devotion,
and are under a <U+017F>ort of Obedience. They wear
an Habit much like our Widows of Quality in
<hi>England,</hi> only without a <hi>Bando;</hi> and their
Veil is of a thicker Crape than what we have
here, through which one cannot <U+017F>ee the Face;
for when they go abroad, they cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
all over with it, but they put 'em up in
the Churches, and lay 'em by in the Hou<U+017F>es.
Every one of the<U+017F>e have a Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or, who is to
'em a <U+017F>ort of Steward: For, you mu<U+017F>t know,
they that go into the<U+017F>e places, have the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of their own Fortunes, and what
their Parents de<U+017F>ign 'em. Without the Advice
of this Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or, they act nothing, nor admit
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:92"/>
of a Lover that he <U+017F>hall not approve of; at
lea<U+017F>t, this Method ought to be taken, and is
by almo<U+017F>t all of 'em; though <hi>Miranda</hi> thought
her Wit above it, as her Spirit was.</p>
                  <p>But as the<U+017F>e Women are, as I <U+017F>aid, of the
be<U+017F>t Quality, and live with the Reputation of
being retir'd from the World a little more than
ordinary, and becau<U+017F>e there is a <U+017F>ort of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to approach 'em, they are the People the
mo<U+017F>t courted, and liable to the greate<U+017F>t Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations;
for as difficult as it <U+017F>eems to be, they
receive Vi<U+017F>its from all the Men of the be<U+017F>t
Quality, e<U+017F>pecially Strangers. All the Men of
Wit and Conver<U+017F>ation meet at the Apartments
of the<U+017F>e fair <hi>Fille Devotes,</hi> where all manner of
Gallantries are perform'd, while all the Study
of the<U+017F>e Maids is to accompli<U+017F>h them<U+017F>elves for
the<U+017F>e noble Conver<U+017F>ations. They receive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ents,
Balls, Serenades and Billets: All the
News, Wit, Ver<U+017F>es, Songs, Novels, Mu<U+017F>ick,
Gaming, and all fine Diver<U+017F>ion, is in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments,
they them<U+017F>elves being of the be<U+017F>t
Quality and Fortune. So that to manage the<U+017F>e
Gallantries, there is no <U+017F>ort of Female Arts
they are not practis'd in, no Intrigues they are
ignorant of, and no Management of which they
are not capable.</p>
                  <p>Of this happy Number was the Fair <hi>Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
who<U+017F>e Parents being dead, and a va<U+017F>t E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tate
divided between her<U+017F>elf, and a young
Si<U+017F>ter (who liv'd with an unmarry'd old Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
who<U+017F>e E<U+017F>tate afterwards was all divided
between 'em) put her<U+017F>elf into this uninclos'd
Religious Hou<U+017F>e; but her Beauty, which had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:92"/>
all the Charms that ever Nature gave, became
the Envy of the whole <hi>Si<U+017F>terhood.</hi> She was tall,
and admirably <U+017F>hap'd; <U+017F>he had a bright Hair,
and Hazle-Eyes, all full of Love and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s:
No Art cou'd make a Face <U+017F>o fair as hers
by a Nature, which every Feature adorn'd with
a Grace that Imagination cannot reach: Every
Look, every Motion charm'd, and her black
Dre<U+017F>s <U+017F>hew'd the Lu<U+017F>tre of her Face and Neck.
She had an Air, though gay as <U+017F>o much Youth
cou'd in<U+017F>pire, yet <U+017F>o mode<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o nobly re<U+017F>erv'd,
without Formality, or Stiffne<U+017F>s, that one who
look'd on her would have imagin'd her Soul
the Twin-Angel of her Body; and both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made her appear <U+017F>omething Divine. To
this <U+017F>he had a great deal of Wit, read much,
and retain'd all that <U+017F>erv'd her purpo<U+017F>e. She
<U+017F>ung delicately, and danc'd well, and play'd
on the Lute to a Miracle. She <U+017F>poke <U+017F>everal
Languages naturally; for being Co-heire<U+017F>s to
<U+017F>o great a Fortune, <U+017F>he was bred with the nice<U+017F>t
Care, in all the fine<U+017F>t Manners of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and was now arriv'd to her Eighteenth
Year.</p>
                  <p>'Twere needle<U+017F>s to tell you how great a
Noi<U+017F>e the Fame of this young Beauty, with <U+017F>o
con<U+017F>iderable a Fortune, made in the World;
I may <U+017F>ay, the World, rather than con<U+017F>ine
her Fame to the <U+017F>canty Limits of a Town;
it reach'd to many others: And there was not
a Man of any Quality that came to <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
or pa<U+017F>s'd through the City, but made it his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
to <U+017F>ee the lovely <hi>Miranda,</hi> who was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ally
ador'd: Her Youth and Beauty, her
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:93"/>
Shape and Maje<U+017F>ty of Mien, and Air of
Greatne<U+017F>s, charm'd all her Beholders; and
thou<U+017F>ands of People were dying by her Eyes,
while <U+017F>he was vain enough to glory in her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t,
and make it her Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to wound.
She lov'd nothing <U+017F>o much as to behold <U+017F>ighing
Slaves at her Feet, of the greate<U+017F>t Quality;
and treated 'em all with an Affability that gave
'em Hope. Continual Mu<U+017F>ick as <U+017F>oon as it
was dark, and Songs of dying Lovers, were
<U+017F>ung under her Windows; and <U+017F>he might well
have made her<U+017F>elf a great Fortune (if <U+017F>he had
not been <U+017F>o already) by the rich Pre<U+017F>ents that
were hourly made her; and every Body daily
expected when <U+017F>he wou'd make <U+017F>ome one hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
by <U+017F>uffering her<U+017F>elf to be conquer'd by
Love and Honour, by the A<U+017F><U+017F>iduities and Vows
of <U+017F>ome one of her Adorers: But <hi>Miranda</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
their Pre<U+017F>ents, heard their Vows with
plea<U+017F>ure, and willingly admitted all their <U+017F>oft
Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es; but wou'd not yield her Heart, or
give away that lovely Per<U+017F>on to the Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of one, who cou'd plea<U+017F>e it<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>o many.
She was naturally Amorous, but extreamly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>tant:
She lov'd one for his Wit, another
for his Face, a third for his Mein; but above
all, <U+017F>he admir'd Quality: Quality alone had the
Power to attack her entirely; yet not to one
Man, but that Vertue was <U+017F>till admir'd by her
in all; where-ever <U+017F>he found that, <U+017F>he lov'd,
or at lea<U+017F>t acted the Lover with <U+017F>uch Art, that
(deceiving well) <U+017F>he fail'd not to compleat her
Conque<U+017F>t; and yet <U+017F>he never dur<U+017F>t tru<U+017F>t her
fickle Humour with Marriage; She knew the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47213:93"/>
Strength of her own Heart, and that it cou'd
not <U+017F>uffer it<U+017F>elf to be confin'd to one Man,
and wi<U+017F>ely avoided tho<U+017F>e Inquietudes, and
that Unea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of Life <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ure to find in
that married Life, which wou'd, again<U+017F>t her
Nature, oblige her to the Embraces of one,
who<U+017F>e Humour was, to love all the Young
and the Gay. But Love, who had hitherto
but play'd with her Heart, and given it naught
but plea<U+017F>ing wanton Wounds, <U+017F>uch as afforded
only <U+017F>oft Joys, and not Pains, re<U+017F>olv'd, either
out of Revenge to tho<U+017F>e Numbers <U+017F>he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd,
and who had <U+017F>igh'd <U+017F>o long in vain;
or to try what Power he had upon <U+017F>o fickle a
Heart, <U+017F>ent an Arrow dipp'd in the mo<U+017F>t tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Flames that rage in Hearts mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible.
He <U+017F>truck it home and deep, with all
the Malice of an angry God.</p>
                  <p>There was a Church belonging to the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers,</hi>
whither <hi>Miranda</hi> often repair'd to her
Devotion; and being there one Day, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with a young Si<U+017F>ter of the Order, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Ma<U+017F>s was ended, as 'tis the Cu<U+017F>tom,
<U+017F>ome one of the Fathers goes about the Church
with a Box, for Contribution, or Charity-Money;
it happen'd that Day, that a young
Father, newly initiated, carried the Box a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
which, in his turn, he brought to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa.</hi>
She had no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t her Eyes on
this young Friar, but her Face was over<U+017F>pread
with Blu<U+017F>hes of Surprize: She beheld him <U+017F>ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa<U+017F>tly,
and <U+017F>aw in his Face all the Charms of
Youth, Wit and Beauty; he wanted no one
Grace that cou'd form him for Love, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:94"/>
all that is adorable to the Fair Sex, nor
cou'd the mi<U+017F>hapen Habit hide from her the
lovely Shape it endeavour'd to cover, nor tho<U+017F>e
delicate Hands that approach'd her too near
with the Box. Be<U+017F>ides the Beauty of his Face
and Shape, he had an Air altogether great; in
<U+017F>pite of his profe<U+017F>s'd Poverty, it betray'd the
Man of Quality; and that Thought weigh'd
greatly with <hi>Miranda.</hi> But Love, who did
not de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd now feel any <U+017F>ort of tho<U+017F>e
ea<U+017F>ie Flames, with which <U+017F>he had heretofore
burnt, made her <U+017F>oon lay all tho<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
a<U+017F>ide, which us'd to invite her to Love,
and now lov'd <U+017F>he knew not why.</p>
                  <p>She gaz'd upon him, while he bow'd before
her, and waited for her Charity, 'till <U+017F>he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the lovely Friar to blu<U+017F>h, and ca<U+017F>t his
Eyes to the Ground. This awaken'd her Shame,

                           <hi>Henrick,</hi> who, all this while, knew no more
of his Unhappine<U+017F>s, than what his Fears <U+017F>ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>ted,
returns, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>es even to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence

Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s and his Brother, with his Father, in
<U+017F>uch a Familiarity, as he no longer doubted
his De<U+017F>tiny. 'Tis hard to judge, whether the
Lady, or him<U+017F>elf, was mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>urpriz'd; <U+017F>he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47213:96"/>
was all pale and unmovable in her Chair, and
<hi>Henrick</hi> fix'd like a Statue; at la<U+017F>t Grief and
Rage took place of Amazement, and he could
not forbear crying out, <hi>Ah, Traytor! Is it
thus you have treated a Friend and Brother? And
you, O perjur'd Charmer! Is it thus you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
all my Vows?</hi> He cou'd <U+017F>ay no more;
but reeling again<U+017F>t the Door, had fall'n in a
Swoon upon the Floor, had not his Page
caught him in his Arms, who was entring
with him. The good old Prince, the Father,
who knew not what all this meant, was <U+017F>oon
inform'd by the young, weeping Prince<U+017F>s;
who, in relating the Story of her Amour
with <hi>Henrick,</hi> told her Tale in <U+017F>o moving a
manner, as brought Tears to the Old Man's
Eyes, and Rage to tho<U+017F>e of her Husband;
he immediately grew jealous to the la<U+017F>t De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
He finds him<U+017F>elf in Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion ('tis
true) of the Beauty he ador'd; but the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
adoring another; a Prince, young, and
charming as the Light; <U+017F>oft, witty, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
with an equal Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. He finds this
dreaded Rival in the <U+017F>ame Hou<U+017F>e with him,
with an Authority equal to his own; and
fancies, where two Hearts are <U+017F>o entirely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
and have <U+017F>o good an Under<U+017F>tanding,
it would not be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to find Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to <U+017F>atisfie and ea<U+017F>e that mutual Flame,
that burnt <U+017F>o equally in both; he therefore
re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>end him out of the World, and
to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h his own Repo<U+017F>e by a Deed, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
cruel, and unnatural, to have him a<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inated
the fir<U+017F>t Opportunity he cou'd find.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47213:97"/>
This Re<U+017F>olution <U+017F>et him a little at ea<U+017F>e, and
he <U+017F>trove to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble Kindne<U+017F>s to <hi>Henrick,</hi>
with all the Art he was capable of, <U+017F>uffering
him to come often to the Apartment of the
Prince<U+017F>s, and to entertain her oftentimes
with Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, when he was not near enough
to hear what he <U+017F>poke; but <U+017F>till watching their
Eyes, he found tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Henrick</hi> full of Tears,
ready to flow, but re<U+017F>train'd, looking all dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and yet reproaching, while tho<U+017F>e of the
Prince<U+017F>s were ever bent to the Earth, and
<U+017F>he, as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>hunning his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ation.
Yet this did not <U+017F>atisfie the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Husband; 'twas not her Complai<U+017F>ance
that cou'd appea<U+017F>e him; he found her Heart
was panting within, when ever <hi>Henrick</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd

confirm'd his Death<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>

                     <p>
                        <q>The Father often found the Di<U+017F>orders of
the Sons; the Softne<U+017F>s and Addre<U+017F>s of the
one gave him as much Fear, as the angry
Blu<U+017F>hings, the fierce Looks, and broken Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of the other, when ever he beheld <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>

fearing <U+017F>ome ill Con<U+017F>equence of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ought
<hi>Henrick</hi> to withdraw to <U+017F>ome other
Country, or travel into <hi>Italy,</hi> he being now
of an Age that requir'd a View of the World.
He told his Father, That he wou'd obey his

Danger in that, and therefore bid him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

                     <p>
                        <q>That which pa<U+017F>s'd between the Father and
<hi>Henrick,</hi> being a Secret, none talk'd of his
departing from Court; <U+017F>o that the De<U+017F>ign the
Brother had, went on; and making an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-match
one Day, where mo<U+017F>t young
People of Quality were, he order'd <U+017F>ome
whom he had hir'd to follow his Brother, <U+017F>o
as if he chanc'd to go out of the way, to
di<U+017F>patch him; and accordingly, Fortune
gave 'em an Opportunity; for he lagg'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Company, and turn'd a<U+017F>ide into a
plea<U+017F>ant Thicket of Hazles; where alighting
he walk'd on Foot in the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant part
of it, full of Thought, how to divide his
Soul between Love and Obedience. He was
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that he ought not to <U+017F>tay, that he
was but an Affliction to the young Prince<U+017F>s,
who<U+017F>e Honour cou'd never permit her to
ea<U+017F>e any part of his Flame; nor was he <U+017F>o
vicious, to entertain a Thought that <U+017F>hou'd
<U+017F>tain her Vertue. He beheld her now as his
Brother's Wife, and that <U+017F>ecur'd his Flame
from all loo<U+017F>e De<U+017F>ires, if her native Mode<U+017F>ty
had not been <U+017F>ufficient of it<U+017F>elf to have done
it, and that profound Re<U+017F>pect he paid her:
And he con<U+017F>ider'd, in obeying his Father,
he left her at Ea<U+017F>e, and his Brother freed of
a thou<U+017F>and Fears; he went to <U+017F>eek a Cure,
which if he cou'd not find, at la<U+017F>t he cou'd
but die; and <U+017F>o he mu<U+017F>t, even at her Feet:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47213:98"/>
However, that 'twas more noble to <U+017F>eek a
Remedy for his Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, than expect a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Death by <U+017F>taying. After a thou<U+017F>and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on his hard Fate, and bemoaning
him<U+017F>elf, and blaming his cruel Stars, that
had doom'd him to die <U+017F>o young; after an
infinity of Sighs and Tears, Re<U+017F>olvings and
Unre<U+017F>olvings, he, on the <U+017F>udden, was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the trampling of <U+017F>ome Hor<U+017F>es he
heard, and their ru<U+017F>hing through the Boughs,
and <U+017F>aw four Men make towards him: He
had not time to mount, being walk'd <U+017F>ome
Paces from his Hor<U+017F>e. One of the Men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd,

Hand <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>e as thine:</hi> And at the <U+017F>ame time,
drawing his Sword, run him into the Groin.
When the Fellow found him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o wounded,
he wheel'd off, and cry'd, <hi>Thou art a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and hast rewarded my Treachery with
Death.</hi> The re<U+017F>t came up, and one <U+017F>hot at
the Prince, and <U+017F>hot him in the Shoulder;
the other two ha<U+017F>tily laying hold (but too
late) on the Hand of the Murtherer, cry'd,
<hi>Hold, Traytor; we relent, and he <U+017F>hall not die.</hi>
He reply'd, <hi>'Tis too late, he is <U+017F>hot; and <U+017F>ee, he
lies dead: Let us provide for our <U+017F>elves, and tell
the Prince, we have done the Work; for you are
as guilty as I am.</hi> At that, they all fled, and
left the Prince lying under a Tree, weltering
in his Blood.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>About the Evening, the Fore<U+017F>ter going
his Walks, <U+017F>aw the Hor<U+017F>e richly capari<U+017F>on'd,
without a Rider, at the Entrance of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47213:98"/>
Wood; and going farther, to <U+017F>ee if he cou'd
find its Owner, found there the Prince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
dead: He immediately mounts him on
the Hor<U+017F>e, and him<U+017F>elf behind, bore him
up, and carry'd him to the Lodge; where
he had only one old Man, his Father, well
skill'd in Surgery, and a Boy. They put him
to Bed, and the old Fore<U+017F>ter, with what
Art he had, dre<U+017F>s'd his Wound, and in the
Morning <U+017F>ent for an abler Surgeon, to whom
the Prince enjoyn'd Secrecy, becau<U+017F>e he knew
him. The Man was faithful, and the Prince,
in time, was recover'd of his Wound; and
ae <U+017F>oon as he was well, he came for <hi>Flanders,</hi>
in the Habit of a Pilgrim, and after <U+017F>ome
time, took the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> none
knowing what became of him, 'till he was
profefs'd; and then he writ his own Story
to the Prince his Father, to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and
his ungrateful Brother. The young Prince<U+017F>s
did not long <U+017F>urvive his Lo<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he langui<U+017F>h'd
from the Moment of his Departure; and he
had this to confirm his devout Life, to know
<U+017F>he dy'd for him.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>My Brother, Madam, was an Officer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Prince, his Father, and knew his
Story perfectly well; from who<U+017F>e Mouth I
had it.</q>

                     <p>
                        <hi>What!</hi> (reply'd <hi>Miranda</hi> then) <hi>is Father</hi>
Henrick <hi>a Man of Quality? Yes, Madam,</hi> (<U+017F>aid
<hi>Cornelia,) and has chang'd his Name to</hi> Franci<U+017F>co.
But <hi>Miranda,</hi> fearing to betray the Sentiments
of her Heart, by asking any more Que<U+017F>tions
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47213:99"/>
about him, turn'd the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>ome
Per<U+017F>ons of Quality came in to vi<U+017F>it her (for
her Apartment was, about Six a-clock, like
the Pre<U+017F>ence-Chamber of a Queen, always
fill'd with the greate<U+017F>t People.) There meet
all the <hi>Beaux E<U+017F>preets,</hi> and all the Beauties. But
it was vi<U+017F>ible <hi>Miranda</hi> was not <U+017F>o gay as <U+017F>he
us'd to be; but pen<U+017F>ive, and an<U+017F>wering <hi>Mal
a propo,</hi> to all that was <U+017F>aid to her. She was a
thou<U+017F>and times going to <U+017F>peak, again<U+017F>t her Will,
<U+017F>omething of the charming Friar, who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from her Thoughts; and <U+017F>he imagin'd, if
he could in<U+017F>pire Love in a cour<U+017F>e, grey, ill-made
Habit, a <U+017F>horn Crown, a Hair-Cord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Wa<U+017F>te, bare-leg'd, in Sandals in<U+017F>tead
of Shooes, what mu<U+017F>t he do, when looking
back on Time, <U+017F>he beholds him in a Pro<U+017F>pect
of Glory, with all that Youth, and Illu<U+017F>trious
Beauty, <U+017F>et off by the Advantage of Dre<U+017F>s and
Equipage. She frames an Idea of him all gay,
and <U+017F>plendid, and looks on his pre<U+017F>ent Habit as
<U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e proper for the Stealths of Love;
<U+017F>ome feign'd put-on Shape, with the more Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to approach a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
happy; and that, the Robe laid by, <U+017F>he
has the Lover in his proper Beauty, the <U+017F>ame
he wou'd have been, if any other Habit (tho'
never <U+017F>o rich) were put off: In the Bed, the
<U+017F>ilent, gloomy Night, and the <U+017F>oft Embraces
of her Arms, he lo<U+017F>es all the Friar, and a<U+017F><U+017F>umes
all the Prince; and that awful Reverence, due
alone to his holy Habit, he exchanges for a
thou<U+017F>and Dalliances, for which his Youth was
made; for Love, for tender Embraces, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:99"/>
all the Happine<U+017F>s of Life. Some Moments <U+017F>he
fancies him a Lover, and that the fair Object
that takes up all his Heart, has left no room for
her there; but that was a Thought that did
not long perplex her, and which, almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oon
as born, <U+017F>he turn'd to her Advantage: She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
him a Lover, and therefore finds he has
a Heart <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and tender; he had Youth to
be fir'd, as well as to in<U+017F>pire; he was far from
the lov'd Object, and totally without Hope:
and <U+017F>he rea<U+017F>onably con<U+017F>ider'd, that Flame
wou'd of it<U+017F>elf <U+017F>oon die, that had only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pair
to feed on. She beheld her own Charms;
and Experience, as well as her Gla<U+017F>s, told her,
they never fail'd of Conque<U+017F>t; e<U+017F>pecially
where they de<U+017F>ign'd it: And <U+017F>he believ'd <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
would be glad, at lea<U+017F>t, to quench that
Flame in him<U+017F>elf, by an Amour with her,
which was kindl'd by the young Prince<U+017F>s of—his
Si<U+017F>ter.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e, and a thou<U+017F>and other Self-flatteries,
all vain and indi<U+017F>creet, took up her waking
Nights, and now more retir'd Days; while Love,
to make her truly wretched, <U+017F>uffer'd her to <U+017F>ooth
her<U+017F>elf with fond Imaginations; not <U+017F>o much as
permitting her Rea<U+017F>on to plead one Moment to
<U+017F>ave her from Undoing: She wou'd not <U+017F>uffer
it to tell her, he had taken holy Orders, made
<U+017F>acred and <U+017F>olemn Vows of everla<U+017F>ting Cha<U+017F>tity,
that 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible he cou'd marry her, or lay
before her any Argument that might prevent
her Ruine; but Love, mad, malicious Love was
always call'd to Coun<U+017F>el, and, like ea<U+017F>ie Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
<U+017F>he had no Ears, but for Flatterers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:100"/>
Well then, <U+017F>he is re<U+017F>olv'd to love, without
con<U+017F>idering to what End, and what mu<U+017F>t be
the Con<U+017F>equence of <U+017F>uch an Amour. She now
mi<U+017F>s'd no Day of being at that little Church,
where <U+017F>he had the Happine<U+017F>s, or rather, the
Misfortune (<U+017F>o Love ordain'd) to <U+017F>ee this Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>her
of her Heart and Soul; and every Day
<U+017F>he took new Fire from his lovely Eyes: Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
unknown and unwillingly he gave her
Wounds, and the Difficulty of her Cure made
her Rage the more: She burnt, <U+017F>he langui<U+017F>h'd,
and dy'd for the young Innocent, who knew
not he was the Author of <U+017F>o much Mi<U+017F>chief.</p>
                     <p>Now <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olves a thou<U+017F>and Ways in her
tortur'd Mind, to let him know her Angui<U+017F>h, and
at la<U+017F>t pitch'd upon that of writing to him <U+017F>oft
Billets, which <U+017F>he had learnt the Art of doing;
or if <U+017F>he had not, <U+017F>he had now Fire enough to
in<U+017F>pire her with all that cou'd charm and move.
The<U+017F>e <U+017F>he deliver'd to a young Wench, who
waited on her, and whom <U+017F>he had entirely <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
to her Intere<U+017F>t, to give to a certain Lay-Brother
of the Order, who was a very <U+017F>imple,
harmle<U+017F>s Wretch, and who <U+017F>erv'd in the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
in the nature of a Cook in the Mona<U+017F>tery of
<hi>Cordeliers:</hi> She gave him Gold to <U+017F>ecure his
Faith and Service; and not knowing from
whence they came (with <U+017F>o good Credenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als)
he undertook to deliver the Letters to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Franci<U+017F>co;</hi> which Letters were all after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as you <U+017F>hall hear, produc'd in open
Court. The<U+017F>e Letters fail'd not to come eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day; and the Sence of the fir<U+017F>t was, to tell
him that a very beautiful young Lady, of a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47213:100"/>
great Fortune, was in love with him, without
naming her; but it came as from a third Per<U+017F>on,
to let him know the Secret, that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ir'd he
wou'd let her know whether <U+017F>he might hope
any Return from him; a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him, he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but only <U+017F>ee the fair Langui<U+017F>her, to confe<U+017F>s
him<U+017F>elf her Slave.</p>
                     <p>This Letter being deliver'd him, he read
by him<U+017F>elf, and was <U+017F>urpriz'd to receive
Words of this nature, being <U+017F>o great a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in that place; and cou'd not imagine, or
wou'd not give him<U+017F>elf the trouble of gue<U+017F><U+017F>ing
who this <U+017F>hould be, becau<U+017F>e he never de<U+017F>ign'd
to make Returns.</p>
                     <p>The next Day <hi>Miranda,</hi> finding no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from her Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of Love, in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>ends another (impatient of Delay) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ing
that <U+017F>he who <U+017F>uffer'd the Shame of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and Imploring, was the Per<U+017F>on her<U+017F>elf
who ador'd him. 'Twas there her raging Love
made her <U+017F>ay all things that di<U+017F>cover'd the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of its Flame, and propo<U+017F>e to flee with him
to any part of the World, if he wou'd quit
the Convent; that <U+017F>he had a Fortune con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
enough to make him happy, and that his
Youth and Quality were not given him to <U+017F>o
unprofitable an End as to lo<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves in a
Convent, where Poverty and Ea<U+017F>e was all
their Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. In fine, <U+017F>he leaves nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urg'd
that might debauch and invite him; not
forgetting to <U+017F>end him her own Character of
Beauty, and left him to judge of her Wit and
Spirit by her Writing, and her Love by the
Extremity of Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>he profe<U+017F>s'd. To all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47213:101"/>
which, the lovely Friar made no Return, as
believing a gentle Capitulation or Exhortation
to her wou'd but inflame her the more, and
give new Occa<U+017F>ions for her continuing to
write. All her Rea<U+017F>onings, fal<U+017F>e and vicious,
he de<U+017F>pis'd, pities the Error of her Love, and
was Proof again<U+017F>t all <U+017F>he could plead. Yet
notwith<U+017F>tanding his Silence, which left her in
doubt, and more tormented her, <U+017F>he ceas'd
not to pur<U+017F>ue him with her Letters, varying
her Style; <U+017F>ometimes all wanton, loo<U+017F>e and
raving; <U+017F>ometimes feigning a Virgin-mode<U+017F>ty
all over, accu<U+017F>ing her<U+017F>elf, blaming her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and <U+017F>iging her De<U+017F>tiny, as one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to the <U+017F>hameful Di<U+017F>covery by the Au<U+017F>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Vow and Habit, asking his Pity and
Forgivene<U+017F>s; urging him in Charity to u<U+017F>e his
Fatherly Care to per<U+017F>wade and rea<U+017F>on with her
wild De<U+017F>ires, and by his Councel drive the
God from her Heart, who<U+017F>e Tyranny was
wor<U+017F>e than that of a Fiend; and he did not
know what his pious Advice might do. But
<U+017F>till <U+017F>he writes in vain, in vain <U+017F>he varies her
Style, by a Cunning, peculiar to a Maid po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd
with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ort of Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
                     <p>This cold Neglect was <U+017F>till Oil to the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lamp, and <U+017F>he tries yet more Arts, which
for want of right Thinking, were as fruitle<U+017F>s.
She has recour<U+017F>e to Pre<U+017F>ents; her Letters came
loaded with Rings of great price, and Jewels,
which Fops of Quality had given her. Many
of this <U+017F>ort he receiv'd, before he knew where
to return 'em, or how; and on this Occa<U+017F>ion
alone he <U+017F>ent her a Letter, and re<U+017F>tor'd her
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47213:101"/>
Trifles, as he call'd 'em: But his Habit having
not made him forget his Quality and Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he writ to her with all the profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect
imaginable; believing by her Pre<U+017F>ents,
and the Liberality with which we parted with
'em, that <U+017F>he was of Quality. But the whole
Letter, as he told me afterwards, was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wade
her from the Honour <U+017F>he did him, by
loving him; urging a thou<U+017F>and Rea<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>olid
and pious, and a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her, he had wholly
devoted the re<U+017F>t of his Days to Heaven, and
had no need of tho<U+017F>e gay Trifles <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ent
him, which were only fit to adorn Ladies <U+017F>o
fair as her<U+017F>elf, and who had bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s with this
glittering World, which he di<U+017F>dain'd, and had
for ever abandon'd. He <U+017F>ent her a thou<U+017F>and
Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ings, and told her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd be ever in
his Prayers, though not in his Heart, as <U+017F>he
de<U+017F>ired: And abundance of Goodne<U+017F>s more he
expre<U+017F>s'd, and Councel he gave her, which had
the <U+017F>ame Effect with his Silence; it made her
Love but the more, and the more impatient
<U+017F>he grew: She now had a new Occa<U+017F>ion to
write, <U+017F>he now is charm'd with his Wit; this
was the new Subject. She rallies his Re<U+017F>olution,
and endeavours to re-call him to the World,
by all the Arguments that Humane Invention
is capable of.</p>
                     <p>But when <U+017F>he had above four Months lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>h'd
thus in vain, not mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing one Day,
wherein <U+017F>he went not to <U+017F>ee him, without di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
her<U+017F>elf to him; <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olv'd, as her
la<U+017F>t Effort, to <U+017F>hew her Per<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>ee what
that, a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by her Tears, and <U+017F>oft Words
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47213:102"/>
from her Mouth, cou'd do, to prevail upon
him.</p>
                     <p>It happen'd to be on the Eve of that Day
when <U+017F>he was to receive the Sacrament, that
<U+017F>he, covering her<U+017F>elf with her Veil, came to
<hi>Ve<U+017F>pers,</hi> purpo<U+017F>ing to make choice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Friar for her Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>She approach'd him; and as <U+017F>he did <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he
trembl'd with Love: At la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he cry'd,</hi> Father,
my Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or is gone for <U+017F>ome time from the Town,
and I am oblig'd to morrow to receive, and beg you
will be pleas'd to take my Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
                     <p>He cou'd not refu<U+017F>e her; and let her into
the <hi>Sacri<U+017F>te,</hi> where there is a Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion-Chair,
in which he <U+017F>eated him<U+017F>elf; and on one <U+017F>ide of
him <U+017F>he kneel'd down, over again<U+017F>t a little Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
where the Prie<U+017F>ts Robes lie, on which was
plac'd <U+017F>ome lighted Wax-Candles, that made
the little place very light and <U+017F>plendid, which
<U+017F>hone full upon <hi>Miranda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the little Preparation u<U+017F>ual in Confe<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
<U+017F>he turn'd up her Veil, and di<U+017F>cover'd to

he had ever <U+017F>een, dre<U+017F>s'd in all the Glory of
a young Bride; her Hair and Stomacher full of
Diamonds, that gave a Lu<U+017F>tre all dazling to
her brighter Face and Eyes. He was <U+017F>urpriz'd
at her amazing Beauty, and que<U+017F>tion'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he <U+017F>aw a Woman or an Angel at his Feet.

I love a Man whom I cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s without

cured of her Love, was triumphing in her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
expecting, and daily giving new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>ts;
and who, by this time, had re-a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd
all her wonted Gaiety, there was great Noi<U+017F>e
about the Town, that a Prince of mighty
Name, and fam'd for all the Excellencies of
his Sex, was arrived; a Prince young, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou<U+017F>ly
attended, call'd Prince <hi>Tarquin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We had often heard of this Great Man, and
that he was making his Travels in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Germany:</hi> And we had al<U+017F>o heard, that <U+017F>ome
Years before, he being about Eighteen Years
of Age, in the time when our King <hi>Charles</hi> of
Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed Memory was in <hi>Bruxels,</hi> in the la<U+017F>t
Year of his Bani<U+017F>hment, that all on a <U+017F>udden,
this young Man ro<U+017F>e up upon 'em like the Sun,
all glorious and dazling, demanding Place of
all the Princes in that Court. And when his
Pretence was demanded, he own'd him<U+017F>elf
Prince <hi>Tarquin,</hi> of the Race of the la<U+017F>t Kings
of <hi>Rome,</hi> made good his Title, and took his
Place accordingly. After that, he travell'd
for about <U+017F>ix Years up and down the World,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:107"/>
and then arriv'd at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> about the time of
my being <U+017F>ent thither by His late Maje<U+017F>ty.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps there could be nothing <U+017F>een <U+017F>o
magnificent as this Prince: He was, as I <U+017F>aid,
extreamly hand<U+017F>ome, from Head to Foot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
form'd, and he wanted nothing that
might adorn that native Beauty to the be<U+017F>t Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
His Parts were <U+017F>uitable to the re<U+017F>t:
He had an Accompli<U+017F>hment fit for a Prince,
an Air haughty, but a Carriage affable, ea<U+017F>ie
in Conver<U+017F>ation, and very Entertaining, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
and Good-natur'd, Brave and Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive.
I have <U+017F>een him pa<U+017F>s the Streets with
twelve Foot-men, and four Pages; the Pages
all in green Velvet Coats, lac'd with Gold,
and white Velvet Trunks; the Men in Cloth,
richly lac'd with Gold; his Coaches, and all
other Officers, <U+017F>uitable to a Great Man.</p>
                     <p>He was all the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the Town;
<U+017F>ome laughing at his Title, others reverencing
it: Some cry'd, that he was an Impo<U+017F>tor;
others, that he had made his Title as plain, as
if <hi>Tarquin</hi> had reign'd but a Year ago. Some
made Friend<U+017F>hips with him, others wou'd
have nothing to <U+017F>ay to him; but all wonder'd
where this Revenue was, that <U+017F>upported this
Grandeur; and believ'd, though he cou'd
make his De<U+017F>cent from the <hi>Roman</hi> Kings very
well out, that he cou'd not lay <U+017F>o good a Claim
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Land. Thus every Body med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with what they had nothing to do; and,
as in other places, thought them<U+017F>elves on the
<U+017F>urer <U+017F>ide, if, in the<U+017F>e doubtful Ca<U+017F>es, they
imagin'd the wor<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:47213:107"/>
But the Men might be of what Opinion
they pleas'd concerning him; the Ladies were
all agreed that he was a Prince, and a young,
hand<U+017F>ome Prince, and a Prince not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted:
He had all their Wi<U+017F>hes, all their Eyes,
and all their Hearts: They now dre<U+017F>s'd only
for him; and what Church he grac'd, was
<U+017F>ure, that Day, to have the Beauties, and all
that thought them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o.</p>
                     <p>You may believe, our amorous <hi>Miranda</hi>
was not the la<U+017F>t Conque<U+017F>t he made. She no
<U+017F>ooner heard of him, which was as <U+017F>oon as he
arriv'd, but <U+017F>he fell in love with his very Name.
<hi>Je<U+017F>u!</hi>—A young King of <hi>Rome!</hi> Oh, 'twas <U+017F>o
novel, that <U+017F>he doated on the Title; and had
not car'd whether the re<U+017F>t had been Man or
Monkey almo<U+017F>t: She was re<U+017F>olv'd to be the
<hi>Lucretia,</hi> that this young <hi>Tarquin</hi> <U+017F>hou'd ravi<U+017F>h.</p>
                     <p>To this End, <U+017F>he was no <U+017F>ooner up the
next Day, but <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent him a <hi>Billet Deaux,</hi>
a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him how much <U+017F>he admir'd his Fame;
and that being a Stranger in the Town, <U+017F>he
begg'd the Honour of introducing him to all
the <hi>Belle</hi>-Conver<U+017F>ations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which he took
for the Invitation of <U+017F>ome <hi>Coquet,</hi> who had
Intere<U+017F>t in fair Ladies; and civilly return'd
her an An<U+017F>wer, that he wou'd wait on her.
She had him that Day watch'd to Church;
and impatient to <U+017F>ee what <U+017F>he heard <U+017F>o many
People flock to <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>he went al<U+017F>o to the <U+017F>ame
Church; tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>anctified Abodes being too
often prophan'd by <U+017F>uch <hi>Devotees,</hi> who<U+017F>e Bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
is to ogle and en<U+017F>nare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:47213:108"/>
But what a Noi<U+017F>e and Humming was heard
all over the Church, when <hi>Tarquin</hi> enter'd?
His Grace, his Mien, his Fa<U+017F>hion, his Beauty,
his Dre<U+017F>s, and his Equipage <U+017F>urpriz'd all
that were pre<U+017F>ent: And by the good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
and Care of <hi>Miranda,</hi> <U+017F>he got to
kneel at the <U+017F>ide of the Altar, ju<U+017F>t over again<U+017F>t
the Prince; <U+017F>o that, if he wou'd, he cou'd not
avoid looking full upon her. She had turn'd
up her Veil, and all her Face and Shape ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<U+017F>uch, and <U+017F>o inchanting, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>crib'd:
And her Beauty heighten'd with
Blu<U+017F>hes, and her Eyes full of Spirit and Fire,
with Joy, to find the young <hi>Roman</hi> Monarch <U+017F>o
charming, <U+017F>he appear'd like <U+017F>omething more
than mortal, and compell'd his Eyes to a fix'd
Gazing on her Face: She never glanc'd that
way, but <U+017F>he met 'em; and then would feign
<U+017F>o mode<U+017F>t a Shame, and Ca<U+017F>t her Eyes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with <U+017F>uch inviting Art, that he was wholly
ravi<U+017F>h'd and charm'd, and <U+017F>he over-joy'd to
find he was <U+017F>o.</p>
                     <p>The Ceremony being ended, he <U+017F>ent a
Page to follow that Lady home, him<U+017F>elf pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uing
her to the Door of the Church; where he
took <U+017F>ome Holy Water, and threw upon her, and
made her a profound Reverence. She forc'd
an innocent Look, and a mode<U+017F>t Gratitude in
her Face, and bow'd, and pa<U+017F>s'd forward, half
a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of her Conque<U+017F>t; leaving him to go
home to his Lodging, and impatiently wait
the Return of his Page. And all the Ladies
who <U+017F>aw this fir<U+017F>t Beginning between the
Prince and <hi>Miranda,</hi> began to cur<U+017F>e and envy
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47213:108"/>
her Charms, who had depriv'd 'em of half their
Hopes.</p>
                     <p>After this, I need not tell you, he made
<hi>Miranda</hi> a Vi<U+017F>it; and from that Day, never
left her Apartment, but when he went home at
Nights, or unle<U+017F>s he had Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; <U+017F>o en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
was he conquer'd by this Fair One. But
the Bi<U+017F>hop, and <U+017F>everal Men of Quality, in
Orders, that profe<U+017F>s'd Friend<U+017F>hip to him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
him from her Company; and <U+017F>poke <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things to him, that might (if Love had
not made him blind) have reclaim'd him from
the Pur<U+017F>uit of his Ruin. But whatever they
tru<U+017F>ted him with, <U+017F>he had the Art to wind
her<U+017F>elf about his Heart, and make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel
all his Secrets; and then knew as well,
by feign'd Sighs and Tears, to make him di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
all. So that he had no Faith, but for
her; and was wholly inchanted and bewitched
by her. At la<U+017F>t, in <U+017F>pight of all that wou'd
have oppos'd it, he marry'd this famous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd by <U+017F>o many Great Men and
Strangers before, while all the World was pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
his Shame and Misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>Being marry'd, they took a great Hou<U+017F>e;
and as <U+017F>he was indeed a great Fortune, and
now a great Prince<U+017F>s, there was nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that was agreeable to their Quality; all
was <U+017F>plendid and magnificent. But all this
would not acquire 'em the World's E<U+017F>teem;
they had an Abhorrence for her former Life,
de<U+017F>pis'd her; and for his e<U+017F>pou<U+017F>ing a Woman
<U+017F>o infamous, they de<U+017F>pis'd him. So that tho'
they admir'd, and gaz'd upon their Equipage,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47213:109"/>
and glorious Dre<U+017F>s, they fore<U+017F>aw the Ruin that
attended it; and paid her Quality little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect.</p>
                     <p>She was no <U+017F>ooner marri'd, but her Uncle
dy'd; and dividing his Fortune between <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa,</hi>
and her Si<U+017F>ter, and leaves the young Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>s,
and all her Fortune, entirely in the Hands
of the Prince<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>We will call this Si<U+017F>ter <hi>Alcidiana;</hi> <U+017F>he was
about Fourteen Years of Age, and now had
cho<U+017F>en her Brother, the Prince, for her Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.
If <hi>Alcidiana</hi> were not altogether <U+017F>o
great a Beauty as her Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>he had Charms
<U+017F>ufficient to procure her a great many Lovers,
though her Fortune had not been <U+017F>o con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as it was; but with that Addition, you
may believe, <U+017F>he wanted no Court<U+017F>hips from
tho<U+017F>e of the be<U+017F>t Quality; though every Body
deplor'd her being under the Tutorage of a
Lady <U+017F>o expert in all the Vices of her Sex, and
<U+017F>o cunning a Manager of Sin as was the Prince<U+017F>s;
who, on her part, fail'd not, by all the Care<U+017F><U+017F>es,
and obliging Endearments, to engage the Mind
of this young Maid, and to <U+017F>ubdue her wholly
to her Government. All her Sen<U+017F>es were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
regal'd with the mo<U+017F>t bewitching Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures
they were capable of: She <U+017F>aw nothing
but Glory and Magnificence, heard nothing but
Mu<U+017F>ick of the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t Sounds; the riche<U+017F>t Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes
employ'd her Smelling, and all <U+017F>he eat
and touch'd was delicate and inviting; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too young to con<U+017F>ider, how this State and
Grandeur was to be continu'd, little imagin'd
her va<U+017F>t Fortune was every Day dimini<U+017F>hing, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
its needle<U+017F>s Support.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:47213:109"/>
When the Prince<U+017F>s went to Church, <U+017F>he
had her Gentleman bare before her, carrying
a great Velvet Cu<U+017F>hion, with great Golden
Ta<U+017F><U+017F>els, for her to kneel on, and her Train
born up a mo<U+017F>t prodigious length; led by a
Gentleman-U<U+017F>her, bare; follow'd by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Footmen, Pages, and Women. And
in this State <U+017F>he wou'd walk in the Streets, as
in tho<U+017F>e Countries 'tis the Fa<U+017F>hion for the great
Ladies to do, who are well; and in her Train
two or three Coaches, and perhaps a rich Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
Chair embroider'd, wou'd follow in State.</p>
                     <p>'Twas thus for <U+017F>ome time they liv'd, and the
Prince<U+017F>s was daily pre<U+017F>s'd by young <U+017F>ighing Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
for her Con<U+017F>ent to marry <hi>Alcidiana;</hi> but
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>till one Art or other to put 'em off,
and <U+017F>o continually broke all the great Matches
that were propos'd to her, notwith<U+017F>tanding
their Kindred, and other Friends, had indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>triou<U+017F>ly
endeavour'd to make <U+017F>everal great
Matches for her; but the Prince<U+017F>s was <U+017F>till po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itive
in her Denial, and one way or other
broke all. At la<U+017F>t it happen'd, there was one
propos'd yet more advantageous; a young
Count, with whom the young Maid grew
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in Love, and be<U+017F>ought her Si<U+017F>ter to
con<U+017F>ent that <U+017F>he might have him, and got the
Prince to <U+017F>peak in her behalf; but he had no
<U+017F>ooner heard the <U+017F>ecret Rea<U+017F>ons <hi>Miranda</hi> gave
him, but (entirely her Slave) he chang'd his
Mind, and <U+017F>uited it to hers, and <U+017F>he, as before,
broke off that Amour; which <U+017F>o extreamly
incens'd <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> that <U+017F>he, taking an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
got from her Guard, and ran away,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47213:110"/>
putting her<U+017F>elf into the Hands of a wealthy
Merchant, her Kin<U+017F>man, and one who bore the
greate<U+017F>t Authority in the City; him <U+017F>he chu<U+017F>es
for her Guardian, re<U+017F>olving to be no longer a
Slave to the Tyranny of her Si<U+017F>ter. And <U+017F>o
well <U+017F>he ordered Matters, that <U+017F>he writ to this
young Cavalier, her la<U+017F>t Lover, and retrieved
him; who came back to <hi>Antwerp</hi> again, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
his Court<U+017F>hip.</p>
                     <p>Both Parties being agreed, it was no hard
Matter to per<U+017F>wade all but the Prince<U+017F>s. But
though <U+017F>he oppo<U+017F>ed it, it was re<U+017F>olved on, and
the Day appointed for Marriage, and the
Portion demanded; demanded only, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be payed, the be<U+017F>t part of it being
<U+017F>pent. However, <U+017F>he put 'em off from Day
to Day, by a thou<U+017F>and frivolous Delays: And
when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw they would have recour<U+017F>e to
Force, and that all her Magnificence would be
at an End, if the Law <U+017F>hould prevail again<U+017F>t
her; and that, without this Si<U+017F>ter's Fortune,
<U+017F>he could not long <U+017F>upport her Grandeur, <U+017F>he
bethought her<U+017F>elf of a Means to make it all
her own, by getting her Si<U+017F>ter made away;
but <U+017F>he being out of her Tuition, <U+017F>he was
not able to accompli<U+017F>h <U+017F>o great a Deed of
Darkne<U+017F>s: But <U+017F>ince 'twas re<U+017F>olv'd it mu<U+017F>t

and, at la<U+017F>t, pitches upon an effectual
one.</p>
                     <p>She had a Page, called <hi>Van Brune;</hi> a Youth
of great Addre<U+017F>s and Wit, and one <U+017F>he had

lived with the Prince<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he was a little
in Love with this hand<U+017F>ome Boy; but 'twas
check'd in its Infancy, and never grew up to a

                     <p>The Prince<U+017F>s one Day ordering this Page to

the fair Per<U+017F>on he ador'd, with joyful Blu<U+017F>hes
that beautify'd his Face, told her, <hi>There was

him, to oblige him; and <U+017F>eeing Love dance
in his Eyes, of which <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o good a Judge,
<U+017F>he treated him more like a Lover, than a

and impatiently implor'd to receive her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
quickly, that he might fly to execute

Words, Looks, and Touches, and retain
his Duty. At this <U+017F>he <U+017F>mil'd, and told him,
the Work was of <U+017F>uch a Nature, as wou'd mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie

had di<U+017F>covered. She <U+017F>miling, told him, he
had committed no Fault; and that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly,
the Pay he <U+017F>hou'd receive for the Service <U+017F>he
required at his Hands, <U+017F>hould be—what he
mo<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>h'd for in the World. To this he
bowed to the Earth; and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing her Feet,
bad her Command. And then <U+017F>he boldly told
him, <hi>'Twas to kill her Si<U+017F>ter</hi> Alcidiana. The
Youth, without <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>tarting, or pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
upon the Matter, told her, <hi>It <U+017F>hould be done;</hi>
and bowing low, immediately went out of the
Clo<U+017F>et. She called him back, and would have
given him <U+017F>ome In<U+017F>truction; but he refus'd it,
and <U+017F>aid, <hi>The Action, and the Contrivance <U+017F>hould
be all his own.</hi> And offering to go again, <U+017F>he
—again recalled him; putting into his
Hand a Pur<U+017F>e of a Hundred Pi<U+017F>toles, which
he took; and with a low Bow, departed.</p>
                     <p>He no <U+017F>ooner left her Pre<U+017F>ence, but he goes
directly and buys a Do<U+017F>e of Poy<U+017F>on, and
went immediately to the Hou<U+017F>e where <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana</hi>
lived; where de<U+017F>iring to be brought to
her Pre<U+017F>ence, he fell a weeping; and told her,
his Lady had fallen out with him, and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed
him her Service; and <U+017F>ince, from a
Child, he had been brought up in the Family,
he humbly be<U+017F>ought <hi>Alcidiana</hi> to receive him
into hers, <U+017F>he being in a few Days to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
There needed not much intreaty to a
thing that plea<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>o well, and <U+017F>he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
received him to Pen<U+017F>ion. And he
waited <U+017F>ome Days on her, before he could
get an Opportunity to admini<U+017F>ter his Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>h
Potion: But one Night, when <U+017F>he drunk
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47213:111"/>
Wine with roa<U+017F>ted Apples, which was u<U+017F>ual
with her; in<U+017F>tead of Sugar, or with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
the baneful Drug was mixed, and <U+017F>he drank
it down.</p>
                     <p>About this time, there was a great Talk of
this Page's coming from one Si<U+017F>ter, to go to
the other. And Prince <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who was
ignorant of the De<U+017F>ign, from the Beginning
to the End, hearing <U+017F>ome Men of Quality at
his Table <U+017F>peaking of <hi>Van Brune</hi>'s Change
of Place (the Prince<U+017F>s then keeping her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
upon <U+017F>ome trifling Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition) he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered,
<hi>That <U+017F>urely they were mi<U+017F>taken, that he was
not di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed from the Prince<U+017F>s's Service.</hi> And
calling <U+017F>ome of his Servants, he asked for <hi>Van
Brune;</hi> and whether any thing had happened
between Her Highne<U+017F>s and him, that had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ioned
his being turned off. They al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ignorant of this Matter; and tho<U+017F>e who
had <U+017F>poken of it, began to fancy there was <U+017F>ome
Juggle in the Ca<U+017F>e, which Time would bring
to Light.</p>
                     <p>The en<U+017F>uing Day 'twas all about the Town,
that <hi>Alcidiana</hi> was Poy<U+017F>oned; and though not
dead, yet very near it; and that the Doctors
<U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he had taken Mercury. So that there
was never <U+017F>o formidable a Sight as this Fair
young Creature; her Head and Body <U+017F>wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
her Eyes <U+017F>tarting out, her Face black, and
all deformed: So that diligent Search was
made, who it <U+017F>hould be that did this; who
gave her Drink and Meat. The Cook and
Butler were examined, the Footmen called to
an Account; but all concluded, <U+017F>he received
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47213:112"/>
nothing, but from the Hand of her new Page,
<U+017F>ince he came into her Service. He was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and <U+017F>hewed a thou<U+017F>and guilty Looks:
And the Apothecary, then attending among
the Doctors, proved he had bought Mercury
of him three or four Days before; which he
could not deny; and making many Excu<U+017F>es for
his buying it, betrayed him the more; <U+017F>o ill
he chanced to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble. He was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<U+017F>ent to be examined by the Margrave or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice,
who made his <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and <U+017F>ent him to
Pri<U+017F>on.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ea<U+017F>ie to imagine, in what Fears and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion
the Prince<U+017F>s was at this News: She took
her Chamber upon it, more to hide her guilty
Face, than for any Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition. And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
applied <U+017F>uch Remedies to <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> <U+017F>uch
Antidotes again<U+017F>t the Poi<U+017F>on, that in a <U+017F>hort
time <U+017F>he recovered; but lo<U+017F>t the fine<U+017F>t Hair in
the World, and the Complexion of her Face
ever after.</p>
                     <p>It was not long before the Trials for Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
came on; and the Day being arrived,
<hi>Van Brune</hi> was tried the fir<U+017F>t of all; every
Body having already read his De<U+017F>tiny, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as they wi<U+017F>h'd it; and none would believe,
but ju<U+017F>t indeed as it was: So that for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
they hoped to <U+017F>ee fall upon the Prince<U+017F>s,
every one wi<U+017F>hed he might find no Mercy, that
<U+017F>he might <U+017F>hare of his Shame and Mi<U+017F>ery.</p>
                     <p>The Se<U+017F><U+017F>ions-Hou<U+017F>e was filled that Day with
all the Ladies, and Chief of the Town, to hear
the Re<U+017F>ult of his Trial; and the <U+017F>ad Youth
was brought loaden with Chains, and pale as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47213:112"/>
Death; where every Circum<U+017F>tance being <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proved again<U+017F>t him, and he making but
a weak Defence for him<U+017F>elf, he was Convicted,
and <U+017F>ent back to Pri<U+017F>on, to receive his Sentence
of Death on the Morrow; where he owned all,
and who <U+017F>et him on to do it. He own'd 'twas
not Reward of Gain he did it for, but Hope he
<U+017F>hould command at his Plea<U+017F>ure, the Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, the Prince<U+017F>s; who <U+017F>hould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him nothing, after having intru<U+017F>ted him
with <U+017F>o great a Secret; and that be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>he
had elevated him with the Promi<U+017F>e of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reward, and had dazl'd his young Heart
with <U+017F>o charming a Pro<U+017F>pect, that blind and
mad with Joy, he ru<U+017F>hed forward, to gain the
de<U+017F>ired Prize, and thought on nothing but his
coming Happine<U+017F>s: That he <U+017F>aw too late the
Follies of his pre<U+017F>umptuous Flame, and cur<U+017F>ed
the deluding Flatteries of the fair Hypocrite,
who had <U+017F>oothed him to his Undoing: That he
was a mi<U+017F>erable Victim to her Wickedne<U+017F>s;
and hoped, he <U+017F>hould warn all young Men, by
his Fall, to avoid the Di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Fair: That he hoped, they would have
Pity on his Youth, and attribute his Crime to
the <U+017F>ubtile Per<U+017F>ua<U+017F>ions alone of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, the
Prince<U+017F>s: And that <U+017F>ince <hi>Alcidiana</hi> was not
dead, they would grant him Mercy, and permit
him to live to repent of his grievous Crime, in
<U+017F>ome Part of the World, whither they might
bani<U+017F>h him.</p>
                     <p>He ended with Tears, that fell in abundance
from his Eyes; and immediately the Prince<U+017F>s
was apprehended, and brought to Pri<U+017F>on, to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47213:113"/>
the <U+017F>ame Pri<U+017F>on, where yet the poor young Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Franci<U+017F>co</hi> was langui<U+017F>hing, he having been
from Week to Week reprieved, by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of the Fathers; and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he there
had time to make <U+017F>ome Reflections.</p>
                     <p>You may imagine <hi>Tarquin</hi> left no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F><U+017F>aied,
to prevent the Impri<U+017F>onment of the
Prince<U+017F>s, and the Publick Shame and Infamy
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e was likely to undergo in this Affair: But
the whole City being over-joyed that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
be puni<U+017F>h'd, as an Author of all this Mi<U+017F>chief,
were <U+017F>o generally bent again<U+017F>t her, both Prie<U+017F>ts,
Magi<U+017F>trates, and People; the whole Force of
the Stream running that way, <U+017F>he found no
more Favour than the meane<U+017F>t Criminal. The
Prince therefore, when he <U+017F>aw 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to re<U+017F>cue her from the Hands of Ju<U+017F>tice, <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
with Grief un<U+017F>peakable, what he could
not prevent; and led her him<U+017F>elf to the Pri<U+017F>on,
followed by all his People, in as much State,
as if he had been going to his Marriage;
where, when <U+017F>he came, <U+017F>he was as well attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and <U+017F>erved as before, he never <U+017F>tirring one
Moment from her.</p>
                     <p>The next Day <U+017F>he was tried in open and
common Court; where <U+017F>he appeared in Glory,
led by <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and attended according to her
Quality: And <U+017F>he could not deny all the Page
had alledged again<U+017F>t her, who was brought
thither al<U+017F>o in Chains; and after a great many
Circum<U+017F>tances, <U+017F>he was found Guilty, and both
received Sentence; the Page to be hanged 'till
he was dead, on a Gibbet, in the Market-place;
and the Prince<U+017F>s to <U+017F>tand under the Gibbet,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47213:113"/>
with a Rope about her Neck, the other end of
which was to be fa<U+017F>tned to the Gibbet where
the Page was hanging; and to have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cription,
in large Characters, upon her Back
and Brea<U+017F>t, of the Cau<U+017F>e why: Where <U+017F>he
was to <U+017F>tand from Ten in the Morning, to
Twelve.</p>
                     <p>This Sentence, the People, with one accord,
believed too favourable for <U+017F>o ill a Woman,
who<U+017F>e Crimes de<U+017F>erved Death, equal to that
of <hi>Van Brune:</hi> Neverthele<U+017F>s, there were <U+017F>ome
who <U+017F>aid, it was infinitely more <U+017F>evere than
Death it<U+017F>elf.</p>
                     <p>The following <hi>Friday</hi> was the Day of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and one need not tell of the abundance
of People, who were flocked together in the
Market-place: And all the Windows were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
down, and filled with Spectators, and the
Tops of Hou<U+017F>es; when at the Hour appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the fatal Beauty appeared. She was dre<U+017F>s'd
in a black Velvet Gown, with a rich Row of
Diamonds all down the fore-part of her Brea<U+017F>t,
and a great Knot of Diamonds at the Peak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind;
and a Petticoat of flowered Gold, very
rich, and laced; with all Things el<U+017F>e <U+017F>uitable:
A Gentleman carried her great Velvet Cu<U+017F>hion
before her, on which her Prayer-Book, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered,
was laid; her Train was born up
by a Page, and the Prince led her, bare; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by his Foot-men, Pages, and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of his Hou<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>When they arrived to the Place of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Cu<U+017F>hion was laid on the Ground, upon
a <hi>Portugal</hi>-Mat, <U+017F>pread there for that purpo<U+017F>e;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47213:114"/>
and the Prince<U+017F>s <U+017F>tood on the Cu<U+017F>hion, with
her Prayer-Book in her Hand, and a Prie<U+017F>t by
her <U+017F>ide; and was accordingly tied up to the
Gibbet.</p>
                     <p>She had not <U+017F>tood there ten Minutes, but <U+017F>he
had the Mortification, (at lea<U+017F>t, one would
think it <U+017F>o to her) to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>ad Page, <hi>Van
Brune,</hi> approach; fair as an Angel, but lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hing
and pale. That Sight moved all the
Beholders with as much Pity, as that of the
Prince<U+017F>s did Di<U+017F>dain and Plea<U+017F>ure.</p>
                     <p>He was dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed all in Mourning, and very fine
Linnen; bare-headed, with his own Hair, the
faire<U+017F>t that could be <U+017F>een, hanging all in Curls
on his Back and Shoulders, very long. He
had a Prayer-Book of black Velvet in his Hand,
and behaved him<U+017F>elf with much Penitence and
Devotion.</p>
                     <p>When he came under the Gibbet, he <U+017F>eeing
his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s in that Condition, <U+017F>hewed an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Concern, and his fair Face was covered
over with Blu<U+017F>hes; and falling at her Feet, he
humbly ask'd her Pardon, for having been the
Occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>o great an Infamy to her, by a
weak Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which the Fears of Youth,
and Hopes of Life, had obliged him to make,
<U+017F>o greatly to her Di<U+017F>honour; for indeed, he
had wanted that Manly Strength, to bear the
Efforts of dying as he ought, in Silence, rather
than of committing <U+017F>o great a Crime again<U+017F>t
his Duty, and Honour it<U+017F>elf; and that he could
not die in Peace, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he would forgive him.
The Prince<U+017F>s only nodded her Head, and cried,
<hi>I do.</hi>—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:47213:114"/>
And after having <U+017F>poken a little to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or, who was with him, he chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
mounted the Ladder; and in the <U+017F>ight of
the Prince<U+017F>s, he was turned off, while a loud
Cry was heard through all the Market-place,
e<U+017F>pecially from the fair Sex; he hanging there
'till the time the Prince<U+017F>s was to depart: And
then <U+017F>he was put into a rich embroidered Chair,
and carried away; <hi>Tarquin</hi> going into his; for
he had all that time <U+017F>tood <U+017F>upporting the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s
under the Gallows, and was very weary.
She was <U+017F>ent back, 'till her Relea<U+017F>ement came;
which was that Night, about Seven of the
Clock; and then <U+017F>he was conducted to her own
Hou<U+017F>e in great State, with a Dozen White
Wax-flambeaus about her Chair.</p>
                     <p>If the Affairs of <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> and her Friends,
before were impatient of having the Portion
out of the Hands of the<U+017F>e Extravagants, 'tis
not to be imagined, but they were now much
more <U+017F>o; and the next Day they <U+017F>ent an Officer,
according to Law, to demand it; or to <U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the Prince to give Rea<U+017F>ons, why he would
not. And the Officer received for An<U+017F>wer,
That the Money <U+017F>hould be called in, and paid
in <U+017F>uch a time; <U+017F>etting a certain Time, which
I have not been <U+017F>o curious as to retain, or put
in my Journal Ob<U+017F>ervations; but I am <U+017F>ure it
was not long, as may be ea<U+017F>ily imagin'd; for
they every Moment, <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected the Prince wou'd
pack up, and be gone <U+017F>ome time, or other, on
the <U+017F>udden; and for that Rea<U+017F>on they would
not tru<U+017F>t him without Bail, or two Officers to
remain in his Hou<U+017F>e, to watch that nothing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47213:115"/>
<U+017F>hould be removed, or touched. As for Bail,
or Security, he could give none; every one
<U+017F>lunk their Heads out of the Collar, when it
came to that: So that he was obliged, at his
own Expence, to maintain Officers in his
Hou<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>The Prince<U+017F>s finding her<U+017F>elf reduced to the
la<U+017F>t Extremity, and that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Value of a Hundred thou<U+017F>and Crowns,
or <U+017F>ee the Prince, her Husband, lodged for
ever in a Pri<U+017F>on, and all their Glory vani<U+017F>h;
and that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to fly, <U+017F>ince guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<U+017F>he had recour<U+017F>e to an Extremity, wor<U+017F>e
than the Affair of <hi>Van Brune.</hi> And in order to
this, <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t puts on a World of Sorrow and
Concern, for what <U+017F>he feared might arrive to
the Prince: And indeed, if ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>hed Tears
which <U+017F>he did not di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, it was upon this
Occa<U+017F>ion. But here <U+017F>he almo<U+017F>t over-acted:
She <U+017F>tirred not from her Bed, and refu<U+017F>ed to
Eat, or Sleep, or <U+017F>ee the Light; <U+017F>o that the
Day being <U+017F>hut out of her Chamber, <U+017F>he lived
by Wax-Lights, and refu<U+017F>ed all Comfort and
Con<U+017F>olation.</p>
                     <p>The Prince, all raving with Love, tender
Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and Grief, never <U+017F>tirred from her
Bed-<U+017F>ide, nor cea<U+017F>ed to implore, that <U+017F>he would
<U+017F>uffer her<U+017F>elf to live. But <U+017F>he, who was not
now <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in Love with <hi>Tarquin,</hi> as
<U+017F>he was with the Prince; not <U+017F>o fond of the
Man, as his Titles, and of Glory, fore<U+017F>aw the
total Ruin of the la<U+017F>t, if not prevented, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
the Payment of this great Sum; which
could no otherwi<U+017F>e be, than by the Death of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47213:115"/>
                        <hi>Alcidiana:</hi> And therefore, without cea<U+017F>ing, <U+017F>he
wept, and cried out, <hi>She could not live, unle<U+017F>s</hi>
Alcidiana <hi>dy'd. This</hi> Alcidiana, (continued
<U+017F>he) <hi>who has been the Author of my Shame; who
has expo<U+017F>ed me under a Gibbet, in the publick
Market-place—Oh!—I am deaf to all
Rea<U+017F>on, blind to Natural Affection. I renounce her,
I hate her as my Mortal Foe, my Stop to Glory, and
the Fini<U+017F>her of my Days, e'er half my Race of Life
be run.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then throwing her fal<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>howy, charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arms, about the Neck of her Heart-breaking
Lord, and Lover, who lay <U+017F>ighing,
and li<U+017F>tening by her Side, he was charmed
and bewitched into <U+017F>aying all Things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea<U+017F>ed
her: And la<U+017F>tly, told her, Alcidiana
<hi><U+017F>hould be no longer an Ob<U+017F>tacle to her Repo<U+017F>e; but
that, if <U+017F>he would look up, and cast her Eyes of
Sweetne<U+017F>s and Love upon him, as heretofore; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
her Sorrow, and redeem her lost Health, he
would take what Mea<U+017F>ures <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould propo<U+017F>e, to
di<U+017F>patch this fatal Stop to her Happine<U+017F>s, out of the
way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e Words fail'd not to make her care<U+017F>s
him in the mo<U+017F>t endearing Manner, that Love
and Flattery could invent; and <U+017F>he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed him
to an Oath, a <U+017F>olemn Oath, to perform what
he had promi<U+017F>ed; and he vowed liberally. And
<U+017F>he a<U+017F><U+017F>umed in an in<U+017F>tant, her Good Humour,
and <U+017F>uffered a Supper to be prepared, and did
eat; which, in many Days before <U+017F>he had not
done; <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinate and powerful was <U+017F>he in
Di<U+017F><U+017F>embling well.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47213:116"/>
The next Thing to be con<U+017F>idered was, which
Way this Deed was to be done; for they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not, but when 'twas done, all the World
would lay it upon the Prince<U+017F>s, as done by her
Command: But <U+017F>he urged, Su<U+017F>picion was no
Proof; and that they never put to Death any
one, but when they had great and certain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
who were the Offenders. She was
<U+017F>ure of her own Con<U+017F>tancy, that Racks and
Tortures <U+017F>hould never get the Secret from her
Brea<U+017F>t; and if he were as confident on his
part, there was no Danger. Yet this Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<U+017F>he made, towards the laying the Fact
on others, that <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed <U+017F>everal Letters to be
written from <hi>Germany,</hi> as from the Relations
of <hi>Van Brune,</hi> who threatned <hi>Alcidiana</hi> with
Death, for depriving their Kin<U+017F>man (who was
a Gentleman) of his Life, tho' he had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away hers. And it was the Report of the
Town, how this young Maid was threatned.
And indeed, the Death of the Page had <U+017F>o
afflicted a great many, that <hi>Alcidiana</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
her<U+017F>elf abundance of Enemies upon that
Account, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he might have <U+017F>aved him if
<U+017F>he had plea<U+017F>ed; but on the contrary, <U+017F>he was
a Spectator, and in full Health and Vigour, at
his Execution: And People were not <U+017F>o much
concerned for her at this Report, as they would
have been.</p>
                     <p>The Prince, who now had, by rea<U+017F>oning the
Matter <U+017F>oberly with <hi>Miranda,</hi> found it ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to di<U+017F>patch <hi>Alcidiana;</hi> he re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him<U+017F>elf, and with his own Hand, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
it; not daring to tru<U+017F>t to any of his mo<U+017F>t
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47213:116"/>
Favourite Servants, tho' he had many, who,
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, would have obeyed him; for they
loved him as he de<U+017F>erved; and <U+017F>o would all the
World, had he not been <U+017F>o purely deluded by
this fair Enchantre<U+017F>s. He therefore, as I <U+017F>aid,
re<U+017F>olved to keep this great Secret to him<U+017F>elf;
and taking a Pi<U+017F>tol, charged well with two
Bullets, he watched an Opportunity to <U+017F>hoot
her as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould go out, or into her Hou<U+017F>e, or
Coach, <U+017F>ome Evening.</p>
                     <p>To this End he waited <U+017F>everal Nights, near
her Lodgings; but <U+017F>till, either <U+017F>he went not
out; or when <U+017F>he returned, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Friends, or her Lover, and Flambeaus,
that he could not aim at her, without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
the Life of <U+017F>ome other. But one Night
above the re<U+017F>t, upon a Sunday, when he knew
<U+017F>he would be at the Theater; for <U+017F>he never
mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed that Day, <U+017F>eeing the Play: He waited
at the Corner of the Stadt-Hou<U+017F>e, near the
Theater, with his Cloak ca<U+017F>t over his Face,
and a black Perriwig, all alone, with his Pi<U+017F>tol
ready cock'd; and remain'd not very long, but
he <U+017F>aw her Kin<U+017F>man's Coach come along; 'twas
almo<U+017F>t dark; Day was ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>hutting up her
Beauties, and left <U+017F>uch a Light to govern the

Object from another, an a convenient Help to
Mi<U+017F>chief. He <U+017F>aw a Light out of the Coach,
only one young Lady, the Lover, and then the
de<U+017F>tin'd Victim; which he (drawing near)
knew rather by her Tongue, than Shape. The
Lady ran into the Play-Hou<U+017F>e, and left <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi>
to be conducted by her Lover into it;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47213:117"/>
who led her to the Door, and went to give
<U+017F>ome Order to the Coach-man; <U+017F>o that the
Lover was about twenty Yards from <hi>Alcidiana;</hi>
when <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood the faire<U+017F>t Mark in the World,
on the Thre<U+017F>hold of the Entrance of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre;
there being many Coaches about the
Door, <U+017F>o that hers could not come <U+017F>o near.
<hi>Tarquin</hi> was re<U+017F>olved not to lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>o fair an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and advanc'd, but went behind
the Coaches; and when he came over-again<U+017F>t
the Door, through a great Booted, Velvet
Coach, that <U+017F>tood between him and her, he
<U+017F>hot; and <U+017F>he having her Train of her Gown
and Petticoat on her Arm, in great quantity,
he mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed her Body, and <U+017F>hot through her
Cloaths, between her Arm and her Body.
She, frightned to find <U+017F>omething hit her, and
to <U+017F>ee the Smoak, and hear the Report of
the Pi<U+017F>tol; running in, cried, <hi>I am <U+017F>hot; I am
dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Noi<U+017F>e quickly alarm'd her Lover; and
all the Coach-men, and Foot-men immediately
ran, <U+017F>ome one Way, and <U+017F>ome another. One
of 'em <U+017F>eeing a Man ha<U+017F>te away in a Clock,
he being a lu<U+017F>ty, bold <hi>German,</hi> <U+017F>topped him;
and drawing upon him, bad him <U+017F>tand, and
deliver his Pi<U+017F>tol, or he would run him
through.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tarquin</hi> being <U+017F>urprized at the Boldne<U+017F>s
of this Fellow, to demand his Pi<U+017F>tol, as if
he po<U+017F>itively knew him to be the Murtherer,
(for <U+017F>o he thought him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince he believed
<hi>Alcidiana</hi> dead) had <U+017F>o much Pre<U+017F>ence of
Mind, as to con<U+017F>ider, if he <U+017F>uffered him<U+017F>elf
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47213:117"/>
to be taken, he <U+017F>hould poorly die a publick
Death; and therefore re<U+017F>olved upon one
Mi<U+017F>chief more, to <U+017F>ecure him<U+017F>elf from the
fir<U+017F>t: And in the Moment that the <hi>German</hi>
bad him deliver his Pi<U+017F>tol, he cried, <hi>Though
I have no Pi<U+017F>tol to deliver, I have a Sword to
cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e thy In<U+017F>olence.</hi> And throwing off his
Cloak, and flinging his Pi<U+017F>tol from him, he
drew, and wounded, and di<U+017F>armed the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>This Noi<U+017F>e of Swords brought every Body
to the Place; and immediately the Bruit ran,
<hi>The Murtherer was taken, the Murtherer was taken:</hi>
Though none knew which was he, nor the
Cau<U+017F>e of the Quarrel between the two fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men, which none yet knew; for it now
was darker than before. But at the Noi<U+017F>e of
the Murderer being taken, the Lover of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi>
who by this time found his Lady un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt,
all but the Trains of her Gown, and
Petticoat, came running to the place, ju<U+017F>t
as <hi>Tarquin</hi> had di<U+017F>armed the <hi>German,</hi> and was
ready to have kill'd him; when laying hold of
his Arm, they arre<U+017F>ted the Stroak, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
the Footman.</p>
                     <p>They then demanded who this Stranger was,
at who<U+017F>e Mercy the Fellow lay; but the Prince,
who now found him<U+017F>elf venturing for his la<U+017F>t
Stake, made no Reply; but with two Swords
in his Hands, went to fight his Way through
the Rabble: And tho' there were above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Per<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>ome Swords, others with long
Whips (as Coach-men) <U+017F>o invincible was the
Courage of this poor unfortunate Gentleman at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47213:118"/>
that time, that all the<U+017F>e were not able to <U+017F>eize
him; but he made his Way through the Ring
that encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ed him, and ran away; but
was, however, <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely pur<U+017F>u'd, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<U+017F>till gathering as they ran, that toiled
with fighting, oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with Guilt, and
Fear of being taken, he grew fainter and
fainter, and <U+017F>uffered him<U+017F>elf, at la<U+017F>t, to yield
to his Pur<U+017F>uers, who <U+017F>oon found him to
be Prince <hi>Tarquin</hi> in Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e: And they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him directly to Pri<U+017F>on, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> to

a real Sorrow and Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for him. They
heard how bravely he had defended him<U+017F>elf,
how many he had wounded before he could
be taken, and what Numbers he had fought
through: And even tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>aw his Valour

<U+017F>eized, now repented from the bottom of
their Hearts, their having any Hand in the

The <hi>Monday</hi> came, and the Prince being

<U+017F>ince there was no harm done; believing a
generous Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion the be<U+017F>t of his Game;
but he was <U+017F>ent back to clo<U+017F>er Impri<U+017F>onment,
loaded with Irons, to expect the next Se<U+017F><U+017F>ions.
All his Hou<U+017F>hold-Goods were <U+017F>eized, and all
they could find, for the U<U+017F>e of <hi>Alcidiana.</hi>
And the Prince<U+017F>s, all in Rage, tearing her
Hair, was carried to the <U+017F>ame Pri<U+017F>on, to
behold the cruel Effects of her helli<U+017F>h De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns.</p>
                     <p>One need not tell here how <U+017F>ad and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
this Metting appeared between her Lord
and <U+017F>he, let it <U+017F>uffice it was the mo<U+017F>t melancholy
and mortifying Object that ever Eyes beheld.
On <hi>Miranda</hi>'s part, 'twas <U+017F>ometimes all Rage

but <U+017F>till 'twas <U+017F>ad Love, and mournful Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s

the Pro<U+017F>pect of Death it<U+017F>elf, drive from his
Soul one Spark of that Fire the ob<U+017F>tinate God
had fatally kindl'd there: And in the mid<U+017F>t of
all his Sighs, he would recal him<U+017F>elf, and cry,
—<hi>I have</hi> Miranda <hi><U+017F>till.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was eternally vi<U+017F>ited by his Friends and
Acquaintance; and this la<U+017F>t Action of Bravery
had got him more, than all his former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
had lo<U+017F>t. The Fathers were perpetually
with him; and all joyn'd with one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Voice in this, That he ought to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
a Woman <U+017F>o wicked as the Prince<U+017F>s;
and that however Fate dealt with him, he
could not <U+017F>hew him<U+017F>elf a true Penitent,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47213:119"/>
while he laid the Author of <U+017F>o much Evil in
his Bo<U+017F>om: That Heaven would never ble<U+017F>s
him, till he had renounced her: And on <U+017F>uch
Conditions, he would find tho<U+017F>e that would
employ their utmo<U+017F>t Intere<U+017F>t to <U+017F>ave his Life;
who el<U+017F>e would not <U+017F>tir in his Affair. But he

as di<U+017F><U+017F>emble a Repentance for having married
her.</p>
                     <p>He lay a long time in Pri<U+017F>on, and all that
time the poor Father <hi>Franci<U+017F>co</hi> remained there
al<U+017F>o; and the good Fathers, who daily vi<U+017F>ited
the<U+017F>e two amorous Pri<U+017F>oners, the Prince and
Prince<U+017F>s; and who found, by the Management
of Matters, it would go very hard with <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
entertained 'em often with holy Matters
relating to the Life to come; from which,
before his Tryal, he gathered what his Stars
had appointed, and that he was de<U+017F>tin'd to
die.</p>
                     <p>This gave an un<U+017F>peakable Torment to the
now repenting Beauty, who had reduced him
to it; and <U+017F>he began to appear with a more
<U+017F>olid Grief, which being perceived by the good
Fathers, they re<U+017F>olved to attack her on the
yielding Side; and after <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon
the Judgment for Sin, they came to reflect on
the Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of Father <hi>Franci<U+017F>co;</hi> and told her,
<U+017F>he had never thriv'd <U+017F>ince her Accu<U+017F>ing of that
Father, and laid it very home to her Con<U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
a<U+017F><U+017F>uring her, that they would do their

but <U+017F>hame of being her own Detector in <U+017F>o
vile a Matter, recall'd her Goodne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>he
faintly per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in it.</p>
                     <p>At the end of <U+017F>ix Months, Prince <hi>Tarquin</hi>

the Circum<U+017F>tances, which are only what is
u<U+017F>ual in <U+017F>uch Criminal Ca<U+017F>es, and tell you,
that he, being found guilty of the Intent of
killing <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> was condemn'd to lo<U+017F>e his
Head in the Market-place, and the Prince<U+017F>s

                     <p>After Sentence pronounc'd, to the real

However, this Di<U+017F>pute gave the Prince

which gave him al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome hope, that
a Reprieve for Ninety Years would have been

After he had taken Leave of all who thought

they were about an Hour in Prayer, all the
Ceremonies of Devotions that were fit to be
done, being already pa<U+017F>t. At la<U+017F>t the Bell

<U+017F>ilent Grief, they both remain'd <U+017F>ome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Tide of Tears had <U+017F>upply'd both their Eyes,
it bur<U+017F>t out in Streams at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant;

At which Words the Prince<U+017F>s fell fainting in

When he came to the Market-place, whither
he walked on Foot, follow'd by his own Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ticks,
and <U+017F>ome bearing a black Velvet Coffin
with Silver Hinges; the Heads-man before
him, with his fatal Scimiter drawn, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>or
by his <U+017F>ide, and many Gentlemen, and
Church-men, with Father <hi>Franci<U+017F>co</hi> attending
him, the People <U+017F>howering Millions of Ble<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ings
on him, and beholding, with weeping
Eyes, he mounted the Scaffold; which was
<U+017F>trew'd with <U+017F>ome Saw-du<U+017F>t, about the place
where he was to kneel, to receive the Blood:
For they Behead People kneeling, and with
the Back-<U+017F>troak of a Scimiter, and not lying
on a Block, and with an Ax, as we in <hi>England.</hi>
The Scaffold had a low Rail about it, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body might more conveniently <U+017F>ee: This
was hung with Black, and all that State that
<U+017F>uch a Death could have, was here in mo<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Order.</p>
                     <p>He did not <U+017F>ay much upon the Scaffold:
The Sum of what he <U+017F>aid to his Friends, was,
To be kind, and take Care of the poor Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
his Wife: To others, recommending
his hone<U+017F>t and generous Servants, who<U+017F>e Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was <U+017F>o well known and commended, that
they were <U+017F>oon promis'd Preferment. He was
<U+017F>ome time in Prayer, and a very <U+017F>hort time
<U+017F>peaking to his Confe<U+017F><U+017F>or; then he turn'd to
the Heads-man, and de<U+017F>ired him to do his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
well, and gave him twenty <hi>Louis d' Ors;</hi>
and undre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf with the help of his Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
and Page, he pull'd off his Coat, and had
underneath a white Satten Wa<U+017F>te-coat: He
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47213:122"/>
took off his Perriwig, and put on a white Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Cap, with a Holland one done with Poynt
under it, which he pull'd over his Eyes, then
took a chearful Leave of all, and kneel'd down,
and <U+017F>aid, <hi>When he lifted up his Hands the Third
time, the Heads-man <U+017F>hould do his Office.</hi> Which
accordingly was done, and the Heads-man gave
him his la<U+017F>t Stroak, and the Prince fell on the
Scaffold. The People, with one common Voice,
as if it had been but one entire one, pray'd for
his Soul; and Murmurs of Sighs were heard
from the whole Multitude, who <U+017F>crambl'd for
<U+017F>ome of the bloody Saw-du<U+017F>t, to keep for his
Memory.</p>
                     <p>The Heads-man going to take up the Head,
as the manner is, to <U+017F>hew to the People, he
found he had not <U+017F>truck it off, and that the
Body <U+017F>tirr'd; with that he <U+017F>tepp'd to an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
which they always carry with 'em, to
force tho<U+017F>e who may be refractory; thinking,
as he <U+017F>aid, to have twi<U+017F>ted the Head from the
Shoulders, conceiving it to hang but by a <U+017F>mall
matter of Fle<U+017F>h. Tho' twas an odd Shift of
the Fellows, yet 'twas done, and the be<U+017F>t
Shift he could <U+017F>uddenly propo<U+017F>e. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,
and another Officer, old Men, were on
the Scaffold, with <U+017F>ome of the Prince's Friends,
and Servants; who <U+017F>eeing the Heads-man put
the Engine about the Neck of the Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to call out, and the People made a great
Noi<U+017F>e. The Prince, who found him<U+017F>elf yet
alive; or rather, who was pa<U+017F>t thinking, but
had <U+017F>ome Sen<U+017F>e of feeling left, when the
Heads-man took him up, and <U+017F>et his Back
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47213:122"/>
again<U+017F>t the Rail, and clapp'd the Engine about
his Neck, got his two Thumbs between the
Rope and his Neck, feeling him<U+017F>elf pre<U+017F>s'd
there; and <U+017F>truggling between Life and Death,
and bending him<U+017F>elf over the Rail backward,
while the Heads-man pull'd forward, he threw
him<U+017F>elf quite over the Rail, by Chance, and not
De<U+017F>ign, and fell upon the Heads and Shoulders
of the People, who were crying out with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
Shouts of Joy. The Heads-man leap'd
after him, but the Rabble had like to have
pull'd him to pieces: All the City was in an
Uproar, but none knew what the Matter
was, but tho<U+017F>e who bore the Body of the
Prince, whom they found yet living; but
how, or by what <U+017F>trange Miracle pre<U+017F>erv'd,
they knew not, nor did examine; but with
one Accord, as if the whole Crowd had been
one Body, and had had but one Motion, they
bore the Prince on their Heads, about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Yards from the Scaffold, where there is
a Mona<U+017F>tery of Je<U+017F>uites; and there they <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
him. All this was done, his Beheading,
his Falling, and his being <U+017F>ecur'd, almo<U+017F>t in a
Moments time; the People rejoycing, as at
<U+017F>ome extraordinary Victory won. One of the
Officers being, as I <U+017F>aid, an old, timerous Man,
was <U+017F>o frighten'd at the Accident, the Bu<U+017F>tle,
the Noi<U+017F>e, and the Confu<U+017F>ion, of which he was
wholly ignorant, that he dy'd with Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Fear; and the other was fain to be
let Blood.</p>
                     <p>The Officers of Ju<U+017F>tice went to demand the
Pri<U+017F>oner; but they demanded in vain; they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47213:123"/>
had now a Right to protect him, and wou'd
do <U+017F>o. All his over-joy'd Friends went to <U+017F>ee
in what Condition he was, and all of Quality
found Admittance: They <U+017F>aw him in Bed,
going to be dre<U+017F>s'd by the mo<U+017F>t skilful Surgeons
who yet could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him of Life. They
de<U+017F>ired no Body <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak to him, or ask
him any Que<U+017F>tions. They found that the
Heads-man had <U+017F>truck him too low, and had
cut him into the Shoulder-bone. A very great
Wound, you may be <U+017F>ure; for the Sword, in
<U+017F>uch Executions, carries an extream force:
However, <U+017F>o great Care was taken on all <U+017F>ides,
and <U+017F>o greatly the Fathers were concern'd for
him, that they found an Amendment, and
Hopes of a good Effect of their incomparable
Charity and Goodne<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>At la<U+017F>t, when he was permitted to <U+017F>peak, the
fir<U+017F>t News he ask'd was after the Prince<U+017F>s. And
his Friends were very much afflicted to find,
that all his Lo<U+017F>s of Blood had not quench'd
that Flame, nor let out that which made him
<U+017F>till love that bad Woman. He was <U+017F>olicited
daily to think no more of her: And all her
Crimes were laid <U+017F>o open to him, and <U+017F>o
<U+017F>hamefully repre<U+017F>ented; and on the other <U+017F>ide,
his Vertues <U+017F>o admir'd; and which, they <U+017F>aid,
would have been eternally celebrated, but for
his Folly with this infamous Creature; that at
la<U+017F>t, by a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him of all their A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, if
he abandon'd her; and to renounce him, and
deliver him up, if he did not; they wrought
<U+017F>o far upon him, as to promi<U+017F>e, he would <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
her to go alone into Bani<U+017F>hment, and would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47213:123"/>
not follow her, or live with her any more. But
alas! this was but his Gratitude that compell'd
this Complai<U+017F>ance, for in his Heart he re<U+017F>olv'd
never to abandon her; nor was he able to live,
and think of doing it: However, his Rea<U+017F>on
a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, he could not do a Deed more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tifiable,
and one that would regain his Fame
<U+017F>ooner.</p>
                     <p>His Friends ask'd him <U+017F>ome Que<U+017F>tions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his E<U+017F>cape; and that <U+017F>ince he was not
beheaded, but only wounded, why he did not
immediately ri<U+017F>e up? But he replied, He was
<U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olutely prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that at the third lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Hands, he <U+017F>hould receive the Stroak
of Death, that at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant the Sword
touch'd him, he had no Sen<U+017F>e; nay, not even
of Pain, <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olutely dead he was with Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
and knew not that he <U+017F>tirr'd, as the
Heads-man found he did; nor did he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
any thing, from the lifting up of his Hands,
to his Fall; and then awakened, as out of a
Dream, or rather a Moment's Sleep, without
Dream, he found he liv'd, and wonder'd what
was arriv'd to him, or how he came to live; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not, as yet, any Sen<U+017F>e of his Wound, tho'
<U+017F>o terrible an one.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> who was extreamly

                     <p>At la<U+017F>t, by great Interce<U+017F><U+017F>ion, both their

prov'd every way <U+017F>o fatal to him, left <hi>Flanders,</hi>
promi<U+017F>ing never to live with the fair Hypocrite
more; but e'er he departed, he writ her a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherein he order'd her, in a little time, to
follow him into <hi>Holland;</hi> and left a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
with one of his tru<U+017F>ty Servants, whom
he had left to wait upon her, for Money for
her Accommodations: So that <U+017F>he was now
reduced to one Woman, one Page, and this
Gentleman. The Prince, in this time of his
Impri<U+017F>onment, had <U+017F>everal Bills of great Sums
from his Father, who was exceeding rich, and
this all the Children he had in the World, and
whom he tenderly loved.</p>
                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Miranda</hi> was come into <hi>Holland,</hi>
<U+017F>he was welcom'd with all imaginable Re<U+017F>pect
and Endearment by the old Father; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon <U+017F>o, as that he knew not <U+017F>he was the
fatal Occa<U+017F>ion of all the<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters to his Son;
but rather look'd on her as a Woman, who had
brought him an Hundred and fifty thou<U+017F>and
Crowns, which his Misfortunes had con<U+017F>um'd.
But, above all, <U+017F>he was receiv'd by <hi>Tarquin</hi> with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47213:124"/>
a Joy un<U+017F>peakable; who, after <U+017F>ome time, to
redeem his Credit, and gain him<U+017F>elf a new
Fame, put him<U+017F>elf into the <hi>French</hi> Army, where
he did Wonders; and after three Campaigns,
his Father dying, he return'd home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to a Country-Hou<U+017F>e; where, with his
Prince<U+017F>s, he lives as a private Gentleman, in
all the Tranquility of a Man of a good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
They <U+017F>ay <hi>Miranda</hi> has been very peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for her Life pa<U+017F>t, and gives Heaven the
Glory for having given her the<U+017F>e Afflictions,
that have reclaim'd her, and brought her to as
perfect a State of Happine<U+017F>s as this trouble<U+017F>ome
World can afford.</p>

                  <p>THough LOVE, all <U+017F>oft and flattering,
promi<U+017F>es nothing but Plea<U+017F>ures; yet
its Con<U+017F>equences are often <U+017F>ad and
fatal: It is not enough to be in
Love, to be happy, <U+017F>ince Fortune, who is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious,
and takes delight to trouble the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
of the mo<U+017F>t Elevated and Virtuous, has
very little re<U+017F>pect for pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate and tender
Hearts, when <U+017F>he de<U+017F>igns to produce <U+017F>trange
Adventures.</p>
                  <p>Many Examples of pa<U+017F>t Ages render this
Maxim certain, but the Reign of <hi>Dom Alphon<U+017F>o</hi>
the Fourth, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> furni<U+017F>hes us with
one, the mo<U+017F>t extraordinary that Hi<U+017F>tory can
produce.</p>
                  <p>He was the Son of that <hi>Dom Denice,</hi> who was
<U+017F>o <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful in all his Undertakings, that it
was <U+017F>aid of him, that he was capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
whatever he de<U+017F>ign'd: And of <hi>I<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
a Prince<U+017F>s of eminent Vertue, who when
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47213:127"/>
he came to inherit a flouri<U+017F>hing and tranquil
State, he endeavour'd to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h Peace and
Plenty in abundance, in his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>And to advance this his De<U+017F>ign, he agreed
on a Marriage between his Son <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> (then
about eight Years of Age) and <hi>Bianca</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> King of <hi>Ca<U+017F>tile;</hi> and whom
the young Prince married when he arrived
to his <U+017F>ixteenth Year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bianca</hi> brought nothing to <hi>Coimbra</hi> but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
and very few Charms. <hi>Don Pedro,</hi>
who was full of Sweetne<U+017F>s and Genero<U+017F>ity, liv'd
neverthele<U+017F>s very well with her; but tho<U+017F>e Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tempers
of the Prince<U+017F>s degenerating into the
Pal<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>he made it her Reque<U+017F>t to retire, and
at her Interce<U+017F><U+017F>ion, the Pope broke the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and the melancholy Prince<U+017F>s concealed
her Langui<U+017F>hment in a <U+017F>olitary Retreat: And
<hi>Don Pedro,</hi> for whom they had provided ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Match, married <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia Manuel,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Dom John Manuel,</hi> a Prince of the Blood
of <hi>Ca<U+017F>tile,</hi> and famous for the Enmity he had
to his King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> was promi<U+017F>ed to the King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tile,</hi>
but that King not keeping his Word, they
made no difficulty of be<U+017F>towing her on a young
Prince, who was one day to Reign over a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of fine Provinces. He was but five and
twenty Years of Age, and the Man of all <hi>Spain</hi>
that had the be<U+017F>t Fa<U+017F>hion and Grace: And
with the mo<U+017F>t advantagious Qualities of the
Body, he po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e of the Soul, and <U+017F>hew'd
him<U+017F>elf worthy in all things of the Crown that
was de<U+017F>tin'd for him.</p>

The Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> had Beauty, Wit,
and Genero<U+017F>ity, in as a great Mea<U+017F>ure as 'twas
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for a Woman to be po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with; her
Merit alone ought to have attach'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
eternally to her; and certainly he had for her
an E<U+017F>teem, mixt with <U+017F>o great a Re<U+017F>pect, as
might very well pa<U+017F>s for Love with tho<U+017F>e that
were not of a nice and curious Ob<U+017F>ervation;
but alas! his real Care was re<U+017F>erv'd for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Beauty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> brought into the World, the fir<U+017F>t
Year after her Marriage, a Son, who was call'd
<hi>Don Louis;</hi> but it <U+017F>carce <U+017F>aw the Light, and
dy'd almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oon as born. The Lo<U+017F>s of this
little Prince <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly touch'd her, but the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
<U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erv'd in the Prince her Husband,
went yet more near her Heart; for <U+017F>he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
her<U+017F>elf ab<U+017F>olutely up to her Duty, and had
made her Tenderne<U+017F>s for him her only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern:
But pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant Glory which ty'd her <U+017F>o
entirely to the Intere<U+017F>t of the Prince of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
open'd her Eyes upon his Actions, where
<U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erv'd nothing in his Care<U+017F><U+017F>es and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
that was natural, or could <U+017F>atisfie her
delicate Heart.</p>
                  <p>At fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he fancy'd her<U+017F>elf deceiv'd, but
time having confirm'd her in what <U+017F>he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<U+017F>he <U+017F>ighed in <U+017F>ecret; yet had that Con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
for the Prince, as not to let him <U+017F>ee
her Di<U+017F>order; and which neverthele<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he
could not conceal from <hi>Agnes de Ca<U+017F>tro,</hi> who
liv'd with her, rather as a Companion, than a
Maid of Honour, and whom her Friend<U+017F>hip
made her infinitely di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h from the re<U+017F>t.</p>

                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47213:128"/>
This maid, <U+017F>o dear to the Prince<U+017F>s, very
well merited the Preference her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s gave
her; <U+017F>he was beautiful to exce<U+017F>s, wi<U+017F>e, di<U+017F>creet,
witty, and had more Tenderne<U+017F>s for <hi>Con<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
than <U+017F>he had for her<U+017F>elf, having quitted her
Family, which was illu<U+017F>trious, to give her<U+017F>elf
wholly to the Service of the Prince<U+017F>s, and to
follow her into <hi>Portugal.</hi> It was into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om
of this Maid, that the Prince<U+017F>s unladed
her fir<U+017F>t Moans, and the charming <hi>Agnes</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
nothing that might give ea<U+017F>e to her affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Heart.</p>
                  <p>Nor was <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> the only Per<U+017F>on who
complain'd on <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> before his Divorce
from <hi>Bianca,</hi> he had expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome Care and
Tenderne<U+017F>s for <hi>Elvira Gonzales,</hi> Si<U+017F>ter to <hi>Don
Alvaro Gonzales,</hi> Favourite to the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi>
and this Amu<U+017F>ement in the young Years
of the Prince, had made a deep Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion on
<hi>Elvira,</hi> who flatter'd her Ambition with the
Infirmities of <hi>Bianca.</hi> She <U+017F>aw, with a <U+017F>ecret
Rage, <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> take her place, who was po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>t
with <U+017F>uch Charms, that quite dive<U+017F>ted her
of all Hopes.</p>
                  <p>Her Jealou<U+017F>ie left her not idle, <U+017F>he examin'd
all the Actions of the Prince, and ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the little Regard he had for the Prince<U+017F>s;
but this brought him not back to her. And it
was upon very good Grounds that <U+017F>he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected
him to be in Love with <U+017F>ome other Per<U+017F>on,
and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with a new Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and which
<U+017F>he promis'd her<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he would de<U+017F>troy as
<U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he could find it out. She had a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
altogether proper for bold and hazardous
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:128"/>
Enterprizes; and the Credit of her Brother
gave her <U+017F>o much Vanity, as all the Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Prince was not capable of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
                  <p>The Prince langui<U+017F>h'd, and conceal'd the
Cau<U+017F>e with <U+017F>o much Care, that 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for any to find it out. No publick Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures
were agreeable to him, and all Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ations
were tedious; and it was Solitude alone
that was able to give him any ea<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>This Change <U+017F>urprized all the World. The
King who lov'd his Son very tenderly, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>tly
pre<U+017F>s'd him to know the Rea<U+017F>on of his
Melancholy; but the Prince made no an<U+017F>wer,
but only this, That it was the Effects of his
Temper.</p>
                  <p>But Time ran on, and the Prince<U+017F>s was
brought to Bed of a <U+017F>econd Son, who liv'd,
and was call'd <hi>Fernando. Don Pedro</hi> forc'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
a little to take part in the publick Joy, <U+017F>o
that they believ'd his Humour was changing;
but this appearance of a Calm endured not
long, and he fell back again into his black Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
                  <p>The Artful <hi>Elvira</hi> was ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly agitated
in <U+017F>earching out the Knowledge of this Secret.
Chance wrought for her: And, as <U+017F>he was
walking full of Indignation and Anger, in the
Garden of the Palace of <hi>Coimbra,</hi> <U+017F>he found the
Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> <U+017F>leeping in an ob<U+017F>cure
Grotto.</p>
                  <p>Her Fury could not contain it<U+017F>elf at the
Sight of this lov'd Object, <U+017F>he roul'd her Eyes
upon him, and perceiv'd in <U+017F>pight of Sleep,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:129"/>
that <U+017F>ome Tears e<U+017F>cap'd his Eyes; the Flame
which burnt yet in her Heart, <U+017F>oon grew <U+017F>oft
and tender there: But oh! <U+017F>he heard him
<U+017F>igh, and after that, utter the<U+017F>e Words; <hi>Yes,
Divine</hi> Agnes, <hi>I will <U+017F>ooner die, than let you know
it:</hi> Con<U+017F>tantia <hi><U+017F>hall have nothing to reproach me
with. Elvira</hi> was enrag'd at this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
which repre<U+017F>ented to her immediately, the
<U+017F>ame Moment, <hi>Agnes de Ca<U+017F>tro</hi> with all her
Charms; and not at all doubting, but it was
<U+017F>he who po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t the Heart of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> <U+017F>he
found in her Soul more Hatred for this fair
Rival, than Tenderne<U+017F>s for him.</p>
                  <p>The Grotto was not a Place <U+017F>it to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
in, or to form De<U+017F>igns. Perhaps her
fir<U+017F>t Tran<U+017F>ports would have made her waken'd
him, if <U+017F>he had not perceiv'd a Paper lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Hand, which <U+017F>he <U+017F>oftly <U+017F>eiz'd on; and
that <U+017F>he might not be <U+017F>urpriz'd in the reading
it, <U+017F>he went out of the Garden with as much
Ha<U+017F>te as Confu<U+017F>ion.</p>
                  <p>When <U+017F>he was retir'd to her Apartment, <U+017F>he
open'd the Paper, trembling, and found in it
the<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es, writ by the Hand of <hi>Don Pedro;</hi>
and which in appearance, he had newly then

                  <p>Her Impatience could not wait till the next

had kept his Torment <U+017F>ecret. After having
made her Moan, without condemning him,
the Tenderne<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had for him, made her

The Wi<U+017F>h and De<U+017F>ires of this charming Maid

<U+017F>hould I tell you? The Prince, the Prince, my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Maid, is in Love; the Hand that he gave me,
was not a Pre<U+017F>ent of his Heart; and for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

it.—What! the Prince in Love, <hi>replied</hi> Agnes,
(<hi>with an A<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment mixt with Indignation</hi>)
What Beauty can di<U+017F>pute the Empire over a Heart

Fight, but to Overcome; and the Prince does more
in the Condition wherein he is, than I ought rea<U+017F>ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

Is there any thing, not only in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but in all

Blow. Yes, <hi>Agnes,</hi> the Prince loves thee; and the
Merit I know thou art po<U+017F><U+017F>est of, puts Bounds to my
Complaints, without <U+017F>uffering me to have the least

<U+017F>he felt neither Hatred, nor <U+017F>o much as Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

not to leave her Vengeance imperfect, <U+017F>tudy'd
in what manner <U+017F>he might bring it to the
Height of its Effects. Her Brother, on whom
<U+017F>he depended, <U+017F>hew'd her a great deal of
Friend<U+017F>hip; and judging rightly that the
Love of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> to <hi>Agnes de Ca<U+017F>tro,</hi> would
not be approv'd by the King, <U+017F>he acquainted
<hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> her Brother, with it, who was not
ignorant of the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion the Prince had once
prote<U+017F>ted to have for his Si<U+017F>ter. He found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
very much intere<U+017F>ted in this News, from
a <U+017F>ecret Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion he had for <hi>Agnes;</hi> whom the
Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of his Fortune had hitherto hindred
him from di<U+017F>covering: And he expected a
great many Favours from the King, that might
render the Effort of his Heart the more con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
                  <p>He hid not from his Si<U+017F>ter this one thing,
which he found difficult to conceal; <U+017F>o that
<U+017F>he was now po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with a double Grief, to
find <hi>Agnes</hi> Sovereign of all the Hearts, to which
<U+017F>he had a preten<U+017F>ion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> was one of tho<U+017F>e ambitious Men,
that are Fierce without Moderation, and Proud
without Genero<U+017F>ity; of a melancholy, clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Humour; of a cruel Inclination, and to
effect his Ends, found nothing difficult, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47213:134"/>
Naturally he lov'd not the Prince,
who, on all Accounts ought to have held the
fir<U+017F>t Rank in the Heart of the King, which
<U+017F>hould have <U+017F>et Bounds to the Favour of <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varo;</hi>
who when he knew the Prince was his
Rival, his Jealou<U+017F>ie increas'd his Hate of him;
and he conjured <hi>Elvira</hi> to employ all her Care,
to oppo<U+017F>e an Engagement that could not but
be de<U+017F>tructive to 'em both; <U+017F>he promi<U+017F>ed him,
and he not very well <U+017F>atisfied, rely'd on her
Addre<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> who had too lively a Repre<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
within him<U+017F>elf, of the Beauties and
Grace of the Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> thought of
nothing but how to combate his Merits, he
him<U+017F>elf being not hand<U+017F>ome, or well made:
His Fa<U+017F>hion was as di<U+017F>agreeable as his Humour,
and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had all the Advantages that one
Man may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly have over another. In fine,
all that <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> wanted, adorn'd the
Prince: But as he was the Husband of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tantia,</hi>
and depended upon an ab<U+017F>olute Father,
and that <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> was free, and Ma<U+017F>ter of a
good Fortune, he thought him<U+017F>elf more a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ur'd
of <hi>Agnes,</hi> and fix'd his Hopes on that
Thought.</p>
                  <p>He knew very well, that the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Don
Pedro,</hi> could not but in<U+017F>pire a violent Anger in
the Soul of the King. Indu<U+017F>trious in doing Ill,
his fir<U+017F>t Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was to carry this unwelcome
News to him. After he had given time to his
Grief, and had compos'd him<U+017F>elf to his De<U+017F>ire,
he then be<U+017F>ought the King to Intere<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf in
his amorous Affair, and to be the Protector of
his Per<U+017F>on.</p>

Though <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> had no other Merit
to recommend him to the King, than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
and blind Obedience to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
yet he had favour'd him with <U+017F>everal
Te<U+017F>timonies of his va<U+017F>t Bounty; and con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the height to which the King's Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
had rais'd him, there were few Ladies
that would have refus'd his Alliance. The
King a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him of the Continuation of his
Friend<U+017F>hip and Favour, and promis'd him, if
he had any Authority, he would give him the
charming <hi>Agnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> perfectly skilful in managing his
Ma<U+017F>ter, an<U+017F>wer'd the King's la<U+017F>t Bounties with
a profound Submi<U+017F><U+017F>ion. He had yet never told
<hi>Agnes</hi> what he felt for her; but he thought now
he might make a publick Declaration of it, and
and <U+017F>ought all means to do it.</p>
                  <p>The Gallantry which <hi>Coimbra</hi> <U+017F>eem'd to have
forgotten, began now to be awaken'd. The
King, to plea<U+017F>e <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> under pretence of
diverting <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia,</hi> order'd <U+017F>ome Publick
Sports, and commanded that every thing <U+017F>hould
be magnificent.</p>
                  <p>Since the Adventure of the Ver<U+017F>es, <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
endeavour'd to lay a Con<U+017F>traint on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
and to appear le<U+017F>s troubled: But in his
Heart he <U+017F>uffer'd always alike; and it was
not but with great Unea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s he prepar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
for the Turnament. And <U+017F>ince he could

Magnificence.</p>

                  <p>The Pride of <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> was <U+017F>oon hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at the Feet of the Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who
threw him again<U+017F>t the Ground, with twenty
others, and carry'd alone the Glory of the

A<U+017F><U+017F>embly at <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi>'s, where <hi>Agnes</hi> would
not have been, unle<U+017F>s expre<U+017F>ly commanded by

and carele<U+017F>s in her Dre<U+017F>s, but yet <U+017F>he appear'd
all beautiful and charming. She <U+017F>aw, with

<hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> at a Publick Triumph; and if

her Heart were capable of any tender Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it was not for <U+017F>uch a Man as he, for
whom her Delicacy de<U+017F>tin'd them: She lookd
on him with a Contempt, which did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him from pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing <U+017F>o near, that there was
a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity for her to hear, and what he had to
declare to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>She treated him not uncivily, but her Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
would have rebated the Courage of any

be heard of none but her<U+017F>elf</hi>) I have hitherto
concealed the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion you have in<U+017F>pir'd me with,
fearing it <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you; but it has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Violence on my Re<U+017F>pect; and I could no longer
conceal it from you. I never reflected on your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<hi>an<U+017F>wer'd</hi> Agnes, <hi>with all the Indifference
of which <U+017F>he was capable,</hi> and if you think you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me, you are in the wrong to make me perceive
it. This Coldne<U+017F>s is but an ill Omen for me, <hi>reply'd
Don Alvaro,</hi> and if you have not found me out to
be your Lover to Day, I fear you will never approve
my Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
                  <p>Oh! what a time you have cho<U+017F>en to make it

it in the Turnament; and if it be that Vanity that
you depend upon, you'll make no great Progre<U+017F>s on
a Soul that is not fond of Shame. If you were
po<U+017F><U+017F>est of all the Advantages, which the Prince has

                  <p>The Favourite of the King, was too proud

                  <p>They were interrupted here, but from that

Heaven to witne<U+017F>s, that if I could cure the Prince

Con<U+017F>olation of <U+017F>acrificing my <U+017F>elf to my Prince<U+017F>s, I

Will it re<U+017F>tore me the Heart of <hi>Don Pedro?</hi>
And will he not fly away with you? his Grief is mine,

Don Pedro, <hi>who had not <U+017F>een the Prince<U+017F>s all
that Day, came in then, and finding 'em both
extreamly troubled; with a fierce Impatience,
demanded the Cau<U+017F>e:</hi> Sir, <hi>an<U+017F>wered</hi> Con<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
<hi>Agnes</hi> too wi<U+017F>e, and too <U+017F>crupulous, fears the
Effects of her Beauty, and will live no longer at
<hi>Coimbra;</hi> and it was on this Subject, (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be agreeable to me) that <U+017F>he ask'd my Advice.
<hi>The Prince grew pale at this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and
<U+017F>natching the Words from her Mouth (with
more concern, than po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t either of them)
cry'd with a Voice very feeble, Agnes</hi> cannot
fail, if <U+017F>he follow your Councel Madam; and I
leave you full liberty to give it her. <hi>He then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
went out, and the Prince<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e
Heart he perfectly po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t, not being able to
hide her Di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, <U+017F>aid,</hi> My dear <hi>Agnes,</hi> if
my Satisfaction did not only depend on your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ation,
I <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire it of you, for <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s
sake; it is the only Advantage that his unfortunate
Love can hope: And would not the World have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
to call me Barbarous, if I contributed to deprive
him of that? But the <U+017F>ight of me will prove a Poy<U+017F>on
to him,—<hi>reply'd</hi> Agnes, And what <U+017F>hould I
do, my Prince<U+017F>s, if after the Re<U+017F>erve he has hitherto
kept, his Mouth <U+017F>hould add any thing to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I have already felt, by <U+017F>peaking to me of his

him to de<U+017F>pair, <hi>reply'd</hi> Con<U+017F>tantia; and I <U+017F>hould
put this Obligation to the Account of the rest you
have done. Would you then have me expect tho<U+017F>e
Events which I fear, Madam? <hi>reply'd</hi> Agnes;
Well—I will obey, but just Heavens, <hi>pur<U+017F>ued
<U+017F>he,</hi> if they prove fatal, do not puni<U+017F>h an innocent

                     </hi>
Agnes <hi>withdrew into her Chamber, but it was
not to be more at ea<U+017F>e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had learn'd of the De<U+017F>ign
of <hi>Agnes,</hi> caus'd a cruel Agitation in his Soul;
he wi<U+017F>h'd he had never lov'd her, and de<U+017F>ir'd a
thou<U+017F>and times to die: But it was not for him
to make Vows again<U+017F>t a thing which Fate
had de<U+017F>ign'd him; and whatever Re<U+017F>olutions
he made, to bear the Ab<U+017F>ence of <hi>Agnes,</hi> his
Tenderne<U+017F>s had not force enough to con<U+017F>ent
to it.</p>
                  <p>After having, for a long time, combated
with him<U+017F>elf, he determin'd to do, what was
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him, to let <hi>Agnes</hi> do. His Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
reproach'd him with the Idlene<U+017F>s, in which
he pa<U+017F>t the mo<U+017F>t Youthful and Vigorous of his
Days; and making it appear to the King, that
his Allies, and even the Prince <hi>Don John Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
his Father-in-Law, had Concerns in the
World, which demanded his Pre<U+017F>ence on the
Frontiers; he ea<U+017F>ily obtain'd Liberty to make
this Journey, to which the Prince<U+017F>s would put
no Ob<U+017F>tacle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> <U+017F>aw him part without any Concern,
but it was not upon the Account of any Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
<U+017F>he had for him. <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> began then
to make his Importunity, an open Per<U+017F>ecution;
he forgot nothing that might touch the in<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
<hi>Agnes,</hi> and made u<U+017F>e, a long time, only of
the Arms of Love: But <U+017F>eeing that this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ions
and Re<U+017F>pect was to no purpo<U+017F>e, he

As the King had a Deference for all his
Coun<U+017F>els, it was not difficult to in<U+017F>pire him
with what he had a Mind to: He complain'd
of the ungrateful <hi>Agnes,</hi> and forgot nothing
that might make him perceive that <U+017F>he was not
cruel to him, on his Account; but from the
too much Sen<U+017F>ibility <U+017F>he had for the Prince.
The King, who was extream angry at this, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
all the Promi<U+017F>es he had made him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King had not yet <U+017F>poke to</hi> Agnes, <hi>in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of</hi> Don Alvaro; <hi>and not doubting but his
Approbation would <U+017F>urmount all Ob<U+017F>tacles,
he took an occa<U+017F>ion to entertain her with it:
And removing <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance from tho<U+017F>e who
might hear him,</hi> I thought <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> had Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
enough, <hi><U+017F>aid he to her,</hi> to have obtain'd a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<U+017F>hare in your E<U+017F>teem; and I could not imagine,
there would have been any nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of my <U+017F>olliciting
it for him: I know you are very charming, but he
has nothing that renders him unworthy of you; and
when you <U+017F>hall reflect on the Choice my Friend<U+017F>hip has
made of him, from among all the Great Men of my
Court, you will do him, at the <U+017F>ame time, Ju<U+017F>tice.
His Fortune is none of the meanest, <U+017F>ince he has me
for his Protector: He is nobly born, a Man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Courage; he adores you, and it <U+017F>eems to
me, that all the<U+017F>e Rea<U+017F>ons are <U+017F>ufficient to vanqui<U+017F>h
your Pride.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Heart of</hi> Agnes <hi>was <U+017F>o little di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to
give it<U+017F>elf to</hi> Don Alvaro, <hi>that all that the King

with, to make him Ma<U+017F>ter of all things,; it is not
that I find any Defect in him, that I an<U+017F>wer not his
De<U+017F>ires: But, Sir, by what ob<U+017F>tinate Power, would
you that I <U+017F>hould Love, if Heaven has not given
me a Soul that is tender? And why <U+017F>hould you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ubmit to him, when nothing is
dearer to me than my Liberty? You are not <U+017F>o free,
nor <U+017F>o in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ile, as you <U+017F>ay, (<hi>an<U+017F>wered the King,
blu<U+017F>hing, with Anger;</hi>) and if your Heart were
exempt from all <U+017F>orts of Affection, he might expect a

Hitherto, I have hid the Chagreen, which
his Weakne<U+017F>s, and yours gave me; but it was not the
le<U+017F>s violent for being hid: And <U+017F>ince you oblige me
to break out, I must tell you, that if my Son were
not already married to <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia,</hi> he <U+017F>hould never

which will cure him, and ju<U+017F>tifie you.</p>
                  <p>The couragious <hi>Agnes</hi> was <U+017F>carce Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s

of Rea<U+017F>on: And con<U+017F>idering the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<U+017F>he receiv'd, not as coming from a Great

with <U+017F>o <U+017F>hining a vivacity, they an<U+017F>wered
for the purity of her Sentiments; and fixing

and I am certain, I never contributed wilfully to
'em: But to let you <U+017F>ee how little I regard your
Defiance, and to put my Glory in <U+017F>afety, I will live

I will quit</hi> Coimbra <hi>with plea<U+017F>ure; and for this

worthy to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the most tender affections of a great
Prince, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that into whatever part of the
World Fortune conducts me, I will not carry away
the least Remembrance of him.</hi> At the<U+017F>e words
<U+017F>he made a profound Reverence, and made
<U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te from his Pre<U+017F>ence, that he could not

                  <p>The King was now more <U+017F>trongly convinc'd

following her own natural Inclinations, <U+017F>he
generou<U+017F>ly defended the Virtue of <hi>Actions.</hi> The
King angry to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>o well intentioned to
her Rival, whom he would have had her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
reproached her with the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of her

with Don <hi>Alvaro</hi>'s Rage, who was totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
when he <U+017F>aw the Negotiation of his

no way to extingui<U+017F>h it; what can I farther

<U+017F>ome Men unknown enter her Chamber, who<U+017F>e
Mea<U+017F>ures being well con<U+017F>ulted, they carried her
out of the Palace, and putting her in a clo<U+017F>e
Coach, forc'd her out of <hi>Coimbra,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hinder'd by any Ob<U+017F>tacle. She knew not
of whom to complain, nor whom to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47213:141"/>
Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> <U+017F>eem'd too pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant to <U+017F>eek his <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
this way; and <U+017F>he accus'd not the
Prince of this Attempt, of whom <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o
favourable an Opinion; whatever <U+017F>he could
think or <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he could not hinder her ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
They hurried her on with diligence, and
before it was Day, were a con<U+017F>iderable way off
from the Town.</p>
                  <p>As <U+017F>oon as Day began to break, <U+017F>he <U+017F>urveyed
tho<U+017F>e that encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ed her, without <U+017F>o much
as knowing one of them; and <U+017F>eeing that her
Cries and Prayers were all in vain with the<U+017F>e
deaf Ravi<U+017F>hers, <U+017F>he <U+017F>atisfied her<U+017F>elf with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
the Protection of Heaven, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
her<U+017F>elf to its Conduct.</p>
                  <p>While <U+017F>he <U+017F>ate thus overwhelmed with grief,
uncertain of her De<U+017F>tiny, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw a Body of
Hor<U+017F>e advance towards the Troop which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
her; the Ravi<U+017F>hers did not <U+017F>hun them,
thinking it to be Don <hi>Alvaro;</hi> but when he
approached more near, they found it was the
Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who was at the Head of
'em, and who, without fore<U+017F>eeing the occa<U+017F>ion
that would offer it<U+017F>elf of <U+017F>erving <hi>Agnes,</hi> was
returning to <hi>Coimbra</hi> full of her Idea, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
performed what he ought in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes,</hi> who did not expect him, changed
now her Opinion, and thought that it was the
Prince that had cau<U+017F>ed her to be <U+017F>tolen away.
<hi>Oh, Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, <hi>having <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame
Thought, Is it you that have torn me from the
Prince<U+017F>s? and could <U+017F>o cruel a Blow come from
a Hand that is <U+017F>o dear to her, what will you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47213:142"/>
do with an <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nfortunate Creature, who de<U+017F>ires
nothing but Death? and why will you ob<U+017F>cure
the Glory of your Life, by an Artifice unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of you?</hi> This Language a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd the
Prince no le<U+017F>s than the Sight of <hi>Agnes</hi> had
done; he found by what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid, that
<U+017F>he was taken away by force; and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing to the height of Rage, he made
her under<U+017F>tand by one only Look, that he was
not the ba<U+017F>e Author of her Trouble. <hi>I tear
you from</hi> Con<U+017F>tantia, <hi>who<U+017F>e only Plea<U+017F>ure you are,</hi>
replied he: <hi>What Opinion have you of Don</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro?
<hi>No, Madam, though you <U+017F>ee me here, I am
altogether innocent of the Violence that has been done
you; and there is nothing I will refu<U+017F>e to hinder it.</hi>
He then turned him<U+017F>elf to behold the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>hers,
but his Pre<U+017F>ence had already <U+017F>cattered
'em: he ordered <U+017F>ome of his Men to pur<U+017F>ue
'em, and to <U+017F>eize <U+017F>ome of 'em, that he might
know what Authority it was that <U+017F>et 'em at
work.</p>
                  <p>During this, <hi>Agnes</hi> was no le<U+017F>s confus'd than
before; <U+017F>he admir'd the Conduct of her De<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that brought the Prince at a time when he
was <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to her: Her Inclinations to
do him Ju<U+017F>tice, <U+017F>oon repair'd the Offence her
Su<U+017F>picions had caus'd; <U+017F>he was glad to have
e<U+017F>cap'd a Misfortune, which appear'd certain
to her; but this was not a <U+017F>incere Joy, when
<U+017F>he con<U+017F>ider'd that her Lover was her Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
and a Lover worthy of all her Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments,
but who ow'd his Heart to the mo<U+017F>t
amiable Prince<U+017F>s in the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:47213:142"/>
While the Prince's Men were pur<U+017F>uing the
Ravi<U+017F>hers of <hi>Agnes,</hi> he was left almo<U+017F>t alone
with her; and tho' he had always re<U+017F>olv'd to
<U+017F>hun being <U+017F>o, yet his Con<U+017F>tancy was not Proof
again<U+017F>t <U+017F>o fair an Occa<U+017F>ion: <q>Madam, <U+017F>aid
he to her, is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that Men born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
tho<U+017F>e that obey us, <U+017F>hould be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of offending you? I never thought my
<U+017F>elf de<U+017F>tin'd to revenge <U+017F>uch an Offence; but
<U+017F>ince Heaven has permitted you to receive
it, I will either peri<U+017F>h or make them repent it.
Sir, replied <hi>Agnes,</hi> more concern'd at this
cour<U+017F>e than at the Enterprize of Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi>
tho<U+017F>e who are wanting in their Re<U+017F>pect to the
Prince<U+017F>s and you, are not oblig'd to have any
for me. I do not in the lea<U+017F>t doubt but Don
<hi>Alvaro</hi> was the Undertaker of this Enterprize,
and I judg'd what I ought to fear from him,
by what his Importunities have already made
me <U+017F>uffer. He is <U+017F>ure of the King's Protection,
and he will make him an Accomplice in his
Crime; but, Sir, Heaven conducted you hither
happily for me, and I owe you for the liberty
I have of <U+017F>erving the Prince<U+017F>s yet longer.
You will do for <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia,</hi> replied the Prince,
what 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible not to do for you; your
Goodne<U+017F>s attaches you to her, and my De<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
engages me to you for ever.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mode<U+017F>t <hi>Agnes,</hi> who fear'd this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
as much as the Misfortune <U+017F>he had newly <U+017F>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
an<U+017F>wer'd nothing but by down-ca<U+017F>t Eyes,
and the Prince, who knew the trouble <U+017F>he was
in, left her to go <U+017F>peak to his Men, who brought
back one of tho<U+017F>e that belong'd to Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47213:143"/>
by who<U+017F>e Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion he found the Truth: He
pardon'd him, thinking not fit to puni<U+017F>h him,
who obey'd a Man whom the weakne<U+017F>s of his
Father had render'd powerful.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards they conducted <hi>Agnes</hi> back to
<hi>Coimbra,</hi> where her Adventure began to make
a great noi<U+017F>e: The Prince<U+017F>s was ready to die
with De<U+017F>pair, and at fir<U+017F>t thought it was only
a continuation of the De<U+017F>ign this fair Maid
had of retiring; but <U+017F>ome Women that <U+017F>erv'd
her having told the Prince<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away by Violence, <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> made her
Complaint to the King, who regarded her not
at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Madam, <U+017F>aid he to her, let this fatal Plague
remove it<U+017F>elf, who takes from you the Heart
of your Husband, and without afflicting your
<U+017F>elf for her Ab<U+017F>ence, ble<U+017F>s Heaven and me
for it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Generous Prince<U+017F>s took <hi>Agnes</hi>'s part
with a great deal of Courage, and was then
di<U+017F>puting her defence with the King, when
Don <hi>Pedro</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Coimbra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fir<U+017F>t Object that met the Prince's Eyes
was Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> who was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through one
of the Courts of the Palace, amid<U+017F>t a Croud of
Courtiers, whom his favour with the King
drew after him. This Sight made Don <hi>Pedro</hi>
rage; but that of the Prince<U+017F>s and <hi>Agnes</hi>
caus'd in him another <U+017F>ort of Emotion: He
ea<U+017F>ily divin'd, that it was Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> who had
taken her from his Men, and, if his Fury had
acted what it would, it might have produc'd
very <U+017F>ad effects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47213:143"/>
                     <q>Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Prince to him, is it
thus you make u<U+017F>e of the Authority which
the King my Father has given you? Have
you receiv'd Employments and Power from
him for no other end but to do ba<U+017F>e Actions,
and to commit Rapes on Ladies? Are you
ignorant how the Prince<U+017F>s intere<U+017F>ts her<U+017F>elf
in all that concerns this Maid? And do you
not know the tender and affectionate E<U+017F>teem
<U+017F>he has for her? No, replied Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi>
                     </q>
(with an In<U+017F>olence that had like to have put
the Prince pa<U+017F>t all Patience) <q>I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it, nor of the Intere<U+017F>t your Heart
takes in her. Ba<U+017F>e and treacherous as thou
art, replied the Prince, neither the Favour
which thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much abu<U+017F>ed, nor the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olence
which makes thee <U+017F>peak this, <U+017F>hould
hinder me from puni<U+017F>hing thee, wert thou
worthy of my Sword; but there are other
ways to humble thy Pride, and 'tis not fit
for <U+017F>uch an Arm as mine to <U+017F>eek <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>e an
Imployment to puni<U+017F>h <U+017F>uch a Slave as thou
art.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Pedro</hi> went away at the<U+017F>e words, and
left <hi>Alvaro</hi> in a Rage, which is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s'd,
de<U+017F>pairing to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf defeated in an
Enterprize he thought <U+017F>o <U+017F>ure, and at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the Prince <U+017F>hew'd him, he promi<U+017F>ed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
to <U+017F>acrifice all to his Revenge.</p>
                  <p>Tho' the King loved his Son, he was <U+017F>o pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd
again<U+017F>t his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that he could not
pardon him what he had done, and condemn'd
him as much for this la<U+017F>t Act of Ju<U+017F>tice, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
<hi>Agnes,</hi> as if it had been the greate<U+017F>t of
Crimes.</p>

                     <hi>Elvira,</hi> whom the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of Hope flatter'd
<U+017F>ome moments, <U+017F>aw the return of <hi>Agnes</hi> with
a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, which <U+017F>uffer'd her to
think of nothing but irritating her Brother.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the Prince <U+017F>aw the King, but in<U+017F>tead
of being receiv'd by him with a Joy due to the
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of his Journey, he appear'd all <U+017F>ullen
and out of Humour. After having paid him
his fir<U+017F>t Re<U+017F>pects, and gave him an exact
account of what he had done, he <U+017F>poke to him
about the Violence committed again<U+017F>t the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of <hi>Agnes de Ca<U+017F>tro,</hi> and complain'd to him
of it in the Name of the Prince<U+017F>s, and of his
own: <q>You ought to be <U+017F>ilent in this Affair,
replied the King, and the Motive which
makes you <U+017F>peak is <U+017F>o <U+017F>hameful for you, that
I <U+017F>igh and blu<U+017F>h at it: What is it to you, if
this Maid, who<U+017F>e Pre<U+017F>ence is trouble<U+017F>ome to
me, be remov'd hence, <U+017F>ince 'tis I that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
it? But, Sir, interrupted the Prince,
what nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity is there of employing Force,
Artifice, and the Night, when the lea<U+017F>t of
your Orders had been <U+017F>ufficient; <hi>Agnes</hi> would
willingly have obey'd you, and if <U+017F>he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
at <hi>Coimbra,</hi> 'tis perhaps again<U+017F>t her will;
but be it as it will, Sir, <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> is offended,
and if it were not for fear of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing you,
(the only thing that retains me) the Ravi<U+017F>her
<U+017F>hould not have gone unpuni<U+017F>h'd. How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are you, replied the King, <U+017F>miling with
Di<U+017F>dain, in making u<U+017F>e of the Name of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tantia</hi>
to uphold the Intere<U+017F>t of your Heart;
you think I am ignorant of it, and that this
unhappy Prince<U+017F>s looks on the Injury you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47213:144"/>
do her with Indifference. Never <U+017F>peak to me
more of <hi>Agnes,</hi> (with a Tone very <U+017F>evere)
Content your <U+017F>elf, that I pardon what's pa<U+017F>t,
and think maturely of the Con<U+017F>iderations I
have for <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> when you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
any thing again<U+017F>t him. Yes, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the Prince, with fiercene<U+017F>s, I will <U+017F>peak
to you no more of <hi>Agnes,</hi> but <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia,</hi> and
I will never <U+017F>uffer, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be any
more expos'd to the In<U+017F>olence of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.</q>
The King had like to have broke
out into Rage at this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; but he had
yet a Re<U+017F>t of Prudence left, that hinder'd him.
<q>Retire, (<U+017F>aid he to <hi>Don Pedro</hi>) and go make
Reflections on what my Power can do, and
what you owe me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>During this Conver<U+017F>ation, <hi>Agnes</hi> was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
from the Prince<U+017F>s, and from all the Ladies
of the Court, great Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Joy, and
Friend<U+017F>hip, <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> <U+017F>aw again her Husband,
with a great deal of <U+017F>atisfaction, and far from
being <U+017F>orry at what he had lately done for
<hi>Agnes,</hi> <U+017F>he privately return'd him Thanks for
it, and <U+017F>till was the <U+017F>ame towards him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
all the Jealou<U+017F>ie which was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to be in<U+017F>pir'd in her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> who found in his Si<U+017F>ter a Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s
worthy of his Tru<U+017F>t, did not conceal
his Fury from her. After <U+017F>he had made vain
Attempts to moderate it, in blotting <hi>Agnes</hi> out
of his Heart, <U+017F>eeing that his Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e was incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<U+017F>he made him under<U+017F>tand, that <U+017F>o long
as <hi>Con<U+017F>tantio</hi> <U+017F>hould not be Jealous, there was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47213:145"/>
no Hopes. That if <hi>Agnes</hi> <U+017F>hould once be <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pected
by her, <U+017F>he would not fail of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
her, and that then it would be ea<U+017F>ie
to get Satisfaction, the Prince being now <U+017F>o
proud of <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi>'s Indulgency. In giving
this Advice to her Brother, <U+017F>he promis'd to
<U+017F>erve him effectually; and having no need of
any Body but her<U+017F>elf to perform Ill Things, <U+017F>he
recommended <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> to manage well the
King.</p>
                  <p>Four Years were pa<U+017F>s'd in that melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Station, and the Prince<U+017F>s, be<U+017F>ides her fir<U+017F>t
dead Child, and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who was <U+017F>till
living, had brought two Daughters into the
World.</p>
                  <p>Some Days after <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Return, <hi>Elvira,</hi>
who was mo<U+017F>t dextrous in the Art of Well-governing
any wicked De<U+017F>ign, did gain one
of the Servants which belong'd to <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi>'s
Chamber. She fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>poke her fair, then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd
her with Pre<U+017F>ents and Gifts, and
finding in her as ill a Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition as in her<U+017F>elf,
<U+017F>he readily re<U+017F>olv'd to employ her.</p>
                  <p>After <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ure of her, <U+017F>he compos'd a

Tenderne<U+017F>s never produc'd an Effect more

<hi>Alas, they are both culpable</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <U+017F>ighing)

Why dost not thou die, <U+017F>ince thou hast not a

<hi>Why did you give me your Hand, without your Heart?
And thou, Fair, and <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ngrateful! Wert thou born

only Cau<U+017F>e of my Death.</hi> After having given
<U+017F>ome Moments to the Violence of her Grief,

with the lea<U+017F>t Tenderne<U+017F>s; and of the cruel

to excu<U+017F>e 'em, and ready to do all <U+017F>he could

                  <p>

that <U+017F>he might from time to time
learn News of her Health, for <U+017F>he was not <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to come in, at which <hi>Agnes</hi> was both <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
and troubled. The Prince had the
<U+017F>ame De<U+017F>tiny, and was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd at an Order
which ought to have excepted him.</p>
                  <p>The next day <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> appear'd, but <U+017F>o al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
that 'twas not difficult to imagine what
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>uffer'd. <hi>Agnes</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t impatient
to approach her, and the Prince<U+017F>s could not
forbear weeping. They were both <U+017F>ilent for
<U+017F>ome time, and <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> attributed this Silence
of <hi>Agnes</hi> to <U+017F>ome Remor<U+017F>e which <U+017F>he felt; and
this unhappy Maid being able to hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

what do you puni<U+017F>h me?</hi> The Prince<U+017F>s regarded
her with a langui<U+017F>hing look, and return'd her
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47213:146"/>
no An<U+017F>wer, but Sighs. <hi>Agnes,</hi> offended at this
Re<U+017F>erve, went out with very great Di<U+017F><U+017F>atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Anger; which contributed to her
being thought criminal. The Prince came in
immediately after, and found <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi> more
di<U+017F>order'd than u<U+017F>ual, and conjur'd her in a
mo<U+017F>t obliging manner to take care of her
Health: <hi>The greate<U+017F>t good for me</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) <hi>is
not the Continuation of my Life; I <U+017F>hould have
more Care of it if I lov'd you le<U+017F>s; but</hi>—She
could not proceed; and the Prince, exce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ively
afflicted at her trouble, <U+017F>igh'd <U+017F>adly,
without making her any An<U+017F>wer, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
her Grief. Spight then began to mix
it<U+017F>elf; and all things per<U+017F>wading the Prince<U+017F>s
that they made a Sacrafice of her, <U+017F>he would
enter into no Explanation with her Husband,
but <U+017F>uffer'd him to go away without <U+017F>aying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                  <p>Nothing is more capable of troubling our

that <U+017F>he was ready to <U+017F>ink under it; <U+017F>he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
fell <U+017F>ick with the violence of it, and all
the Court was concern'd at this Misfortune:
Don <hi>Pedro</hi> was truly afflicted at it, but <hi>Agnes</hi>
more than all the World be<U+017F>ide. <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi>'s
Coldne<U+017F>s towards her, made her continually
<U+017F>igh; and her Di<U+017F>temper, created meerly by
Fancy, caus'd her to reflect on every thing that
offer'd it<U+017F>elf to her Memory; <U+017F>o that at la<U+017F>t
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47213:147"/>
<U+017F>he began even to fear her<U+017F>elf, and to reproach
her<U+017F>elf for what the Prince<U+017F>s <U+017F>uffer'd.</p>
                  <p>But the Di<U+017F>temper began to be <U+017F>uch, that
they fear'd <hi>Con<U+017F>tantia</hi>'s Death, and <U+017F>he her<U+017F>elf
began to feel the Approaches of it. This
Thought did not at all di<U+017F>quiet her; <U+017F>he look'd
on Death as the only Relief from all her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and regarded the De<U+017F>pair of all that
approach'd her without the lea<U+017F>t concern.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King, who lov'd her tenderly, and who
knew her Vertue, was infinitely mov'd at the

much incen<U+017F>e him again<U+017F>t Criminals worthy of

(<hi><U+017F>aid he to the Prince</hi>) and <U+017F>uch as
will render your Memory illu<U+017F>trious; and the

But what must not Imprudent <hi>Agnes,</hi> to

receiv'd it: He was very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the King's
Reproaches; but as his Fault was not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
and that a commanding Power, a fatal
Star had forc'd him to love in <U+017F>pight of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
he appear'd afflicted and confus'd:</hi> You
condemn me, Sir, (<hi>an<U+017F>wered he</hi>) without having
well examin'd me; and if my Intentions were
known to you, perhaps you would not find me <U+017F>o
criminal: I would take the Prince<U+017F>s for my
Judge, whom you <U+017F>ay, I <U+017F>acrifice, if <U+017F>he were
in a condition to be con<U+017F>ulted. If I am guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

me for it; and my Tongue never inform'd <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
of it. But, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e I have committed any
Fault, why wou'd you puni<U+017F>h an Innocent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
who perhaps condemns me for it as much
as you? Ah, Villain! (<hi>interrupted the King,</hi>)
<U+017F>he has but too much favour'd you: You would

than which nothing can be purer; and tho<U+017F>e

                  <p>As they thus argued, one of the Prince<U+017F>s's

Con<U+017F>tantia! <hi>if my Heart has committed any Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

Death <U+017F>hut the Eyes of the mo<U+017F>t generous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s

when <U+017F>he found that in that Interval, when
Life and Death were <U+017F>truggling in her Soul,

At the noi<U+017F>e of the Death of the Prince<U+017F>s,
the Town and the Palace was all in Tears. <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira,</hi>
who <U+017F>aw then Don <hi>Pedro</hi> free to engage

her<U+017F>elf.</p>
                  <p>She had need of being guarded <U+017F>everal days
together; during which time, <U+017F>he fail'd not
ince<U+017F><U+017F>antly to weep. And the Prince gave all
tho<U+017F>e days to deepe<U+017F>t Mourning. But when
the fir<U+017F>t Emotions were pa<U+017F>t, tho<U+017F>e of his Love

                  <p>Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> who was afraid of the Liberty

the delicacy of her Wit, to revive the Flames
with which the Prince once burnt for her:
But his Incon<U+017F>tancy was bounded, and it was

Alas, cruel Maid! (<hi>interrupted Don</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro;)
why do you command me to live, if I cannot
live with you? Is it an effect of your Hatred? No,
Sir, (<hi>replyed</hi> Agnes) I do not hate you; and I
wi<U+017F>h to God that I cou'd be indifferent, that I might
be able to defend my<U+017F>elf against the Weakne<U+017F>s with
which I find my<U+017F>elf po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd. Oblige me to <U+017F>ay no

that I ought no more to <U+017F>ee, or <U+017F>peak to you. In fine,

                  <p>At the<U+017F>e Words he went away; and as

at it, that <U+017F>he kept her Chamber <U+017F>everal days,
without daring to inform her<U+017F>elf of the Prince;
and this Retirement <U+017F>par'd her the Affliction
of being vi<U+017F>ited by Don <hi>Alvaro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During this, Don <hi>Pedro</hi> fell <U+017F>ick, and was
in <U+017F>o great Danger, that there was a general
Apprehen<U+017F>ion of his Death. <hi>Agnes</hi> did not in
the lea<U+017F>t doubt, but it was an Effect of his Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content:
<U+017F>he thought at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he had <U+017F>trength
and re<U+017F>olution enough to <U+017F>ee him die, rather
than to favour him; but had <U+017F>he reflected a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>oon been convinc'd to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
She found not in her Heart that cruel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy,
<U+017F>he thought there <U+017F>o well e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd;
<U+017F>he felt Pains and Inquietude, <U+017F>hed Tears, made
Wi<U+017F>hes; and in fine, di<U+017F>cover'd that <U+017F>he
Lov'd.</p>
                  <p>'Twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>ee the Heir of the
Crown, a Prince that de<U+017F>erv'd <U+017F>o well, even
at the point of Death, without a general Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
The People who lov'd him, pa<U+017F>s'd whole
days at the Palace-gate to hear News of him:
The Court was all overwhelm'd with Grief.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> knew very well how to conceal
a malicious Joy, under an Appearance of Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.
<hi>Elvira,</hi> full of Tenderne<U+017F>s, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
of Remor<U+017F>e, <U+017F>uffer'd al<U+017F>o on her <U+017F>ide.
The King, altho' he condemn'd the Love of
his Son, yet <U+017F>till had a Tenderne<U+017F>s for him,
and cou'd not re<U+017F>olve to lo<U+017F>e him. <hi>Agnes de

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47213:153"/>
expected the end of it with <U+017F>trange Anxieties.
In fine, after a Month had pa<U+017F>s'd away in Fears,
they began to have a little Hopes of his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
The Prince, and Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> were the
only Per<U+017F>ons that were not glad of it. But
<hi>Agnes</hi> rejoyc'd enough for all the re<U+017F>t.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> <U+017F>eeing that he mu<U+017F>t live whether
he wou'd or no, thought of nothing, but pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
his days in Melancholly and Di<U+017F>content:
As <U+017F>oon as he was in a condition to walk, he
<U+017F>ought out the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olitary Places, and gain'd
<U+017F>o much upon his own Weakne<U+017F>s, to go every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
where <hi>Agnes</hi> was not; but her Idea
follow'd him always, and his Memory, faithful,
to repre<U+017F>ent her to him, with all her Charms,
render'd her always dangerous.</p>
                  <p>One day, when they had carry'd him into
the Garden, he <U+017F>ought out a Labyrinth which
was at the farthe<U+017F>t part of it, to hide his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly,
during <U+017F>ome hours; there he found
the <U+017F>ad <hi>Agnes,</hi> whom Grief, little different
from his, had brought thither; the <U+017F>ight of
her, whom he expected not, made him trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
She <U+017F>aw by his pale and meagre Face, the
remains of his Di<U+017F>temper; his Eyes full of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hment
troubled her, and tho' her de<U+017F>ire

                  <p>After <U+017F>ome Moments of Silence, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the mo<U+017F>t importuning Man in the World.
Your Billets have an hundred times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a <hi>Di<U+017F>cretion,</hi> which you won of me;
and tell me, you will not wait my Return, to
be paid. You are either a very faithle<U+017F>s Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,
or believe me very unju<U+017F>t, that you dun
with <U+017F>uch Impatience. But, to let you <U+017F>ee I
am a Maid of Honour, and value my Word, I
will acquit my<U+017F>elf of this Obligation I have to
you, and <U+017F>end you a <hi>Watch</hi> of my fa<U+017F>hion; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you never <U+017F>aw any <U+017F>o good. It is not
one of tho<U+017F>e, that have always <U+017F>omething to
be mended in it; but one that is without Fault,
very ju<U+017F>t and good, and will remain <U+017F>o, as long
as you continue to love me. But <hi>Damon,</hi> know,
that the very Minute you cea<U+017F>e to do <U+017F>o, the
String will break, and it will go no more. 'Tis
only u<U+017F>eful in my Ab<U+017F>ence, and when I return,
'twill change its Motion: And though I have
<U+017F>et it but for the Spring-time, 'twill <U+017F>erve you
the whole Year round; and 'twill be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary

Days and Nights. Nor is the Dart of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
God directed to tho<U+017F>e Hours, <U+017F>o much to
inform you how they pa<U+017F>s, as how you ought
to pa<U+017F>s them, how you ought to employ tho<U+017F>e
of your Ab<U+017F>ence from <hi>Iris.</hi> 'Tis there you <U+017F>hall

your Actions. The Con<U+017F>ideration of the
Workman, ought to make you <U+017F>et a Value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Work: And though it be not an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>ht,
and perfect Piece; yet <hi>Damon,</hi> you
ought to be grateful, and e<U+017F>teem it, <U+017F>ince I have
made it for you alone. But however I may
boa<U+017F>t of the De<U+017F>ign, I know, as well as I believe,

                     <p>IF my <hi>Watch</hi> did not inform you, 'tis now time

wou'd; and tell you al<U+017F>o, that I <U+017F>hould take it

the Welcome I give your Letters. Perhaps you
will <U+017F>ay, an Hour is too much, and that 'tis not
the Mode to write long Letters. I grant you,
<hi>Damon,</hi> when we write tho<U+017F>e indifferent ones,
of Gallantry in cour<U+017F>e, or nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the hand<U+017F>om comprizing of which, in
the fewe<U+017F>t words, renders 'em the mo<U+017F>t agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
But in Love we have a Thou<U+017F>and fooli<U+017F>h
things to <U+017F>ay, that, of them<U+017F>elves, bear no
great Sound, but have a mighty Sence in Love;
for there is a peculiar Eloquence, natural alone
to a Lover, and to be under<U+017F>tood by no other
Creature: To tho<U+017F>e, Words have a thou<U+017F>and
Graces and Sweetne<U+017F><U+017F>es; which, to the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
appears Meanne<U+017F>s, and Ea<U+017F>ie Sen<U+017F>e,
at the be<U+017F>t. But, <hi>Damon,</hi> you and I are none of
tho<U+017F>e ill Judges of the Beauties of Love; we can
penetrate beyond the Vulgar, and perceive the
fine Soul in every Line, through all the humble
Dre<U+017F>s of Phra<U+017F>e; when po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, they who
think they di<U+017F>cern it be<U+017F>t in florid Language,
do not <U+017F>ee it at all. <hi>Love</hi> was not born, or bred
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47213:166"/>
in Courts, but Cottages; and nurs'd in Groves
and Shades, <U+017F>miles on the Plains, and wantons

Therefore, <hi>Damon,</hi> do not con<U+017F>ult your Wit in
this Affair, but Love alone; and <U+017F>peak all that
he and Nature taught you, and let the fine
Things you learn in Schools alone: Make u<U+017F>e
of tho<U+017F>e Flowers you have gather'd there,
when you conver<U+017F>e with States-men and the
Gown. Let <hi>Iris</hi> po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s your Heart in all its
<U+017F>imple Innocence, that's the be<U+017F>t Eloquence to
her that loves; and this is my In<U+017F>truction to a
Lover, that would <U+017F>ucceed in his Amours; for
I have a Heart very difficult to plea<U+017F>e, and this

                        <p>It is an Art too ingenious to have been found

But, <hi>Damon,</hi> I do not pretend to exact
from you tho<U+017F>e Letters of Gallantry which, I
have told you, are filled with nothing but fine
Thoughts, and writ with all the Arts of Wit

unaffected Love, Words uncho<U+017F>en, Thoughts

find more Softne<U+017F>s than Wit, in your Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion;
more of Nature than of Art; more of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

any of tho<U+017F>e little <U+017F>hort Letters that are read
over in a minute; in Love, long Letters bring
a long Plea<U+017F>ure: Do not trouble your<U+017F>elf to
make 'em fine, or write a great deal of Wit and
Sence in a few Lines; that is the Notion of a
witty Billet, in any Affair but that of Love:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:168"/>

not that I fear you will <U+017F>quander away

<U+017F>pight of you, <U+017F>he'll detain you with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Impertinencies, and eternal Tattle. She
pa<U+017F><U+017F>es for a judging Wit; and there is nothing
<U+017F>o trouble<U+017F>ome, as <U+017F>uch a Pretender. She, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
may get <U+017F>ome Knowledge of our Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pondence;
and then, no doubt, will improve
it, to my di<U+017F>advantage. Po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he may rail at
me; that is her Fa<U+017F>hion, by the way of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Speaking; and an Aukward Commendation,
the mo<U+017F>t effectual Way of Defaming, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing.
Perhaps <U+017F>he tells you, in a cold Tone,
that you are a happy Man, to be belov'd by me:
That <hi>Iris,</hi> indeed, is hand<U+017F>ome; and <U+017F>he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<U+017F>he has no more Lovers; but the Men are
not of her Mind; if they were, you <U+017F>hould have
more Rivals. She commends my Face, but that
I have blue Eyes, and 'tis pity my Complexion
is no better: My Shape, but too much inclining
to Fat. Cries—She would charm infinitely
with her Wit, but that <U+017F>he knows too well, <U+017F>he
is Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of it. And concludes,—But all
together, <U+017F>he is well enough.—Thus <U+017F>he runs
on, without giving you leave to edge in a Word,
in my Defence; and ever and anon, crying
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:171"/>
up her own Conduct, and Management: Tell
you, how <U+017F>he is oppre<U+017F>t with Lovers, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd
with Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es; and recommending her
<U+017F>elf, at every turn, with a perceivable Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
And all the while, is Jilting you of your
good Opinion; which <U+017F>he would buy, at the
Price of any Body's Repo<U+017F>e, or her own Fame,
tho' but for the Vanity of adding to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

the fir<U+017F>t thing <U+017F>he does, <U+017F>he enquires into his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tate:
If <U+017F>he find it <U+017F>uch, as may (if the Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb
be well manag'd) <U+017F>upply her Vanity, <U+017F>he
makes Advances to him, and applies her<U+017F>elf to
all tho<U+017F>e little Arts <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ually makes u<U+017F>e of, to
gain her Fools; and, according to his Humour,
dre<U+017F><U+017F>es and affects her own. But, <hi>Damon,</hi> <U+017F>ince

nor is it my Province to order you your Diet.
Here I give you a perfect Liberty, to do what
you plea<U+017F>e: And po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly, 'tis the only Hour in
the whole Four and twenty, that I will ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
re<U+017F>ign you, or di<U+017F>pence with your even
<U+017F>o much as Thinking on me. 'Tis true, in
<U+017F>eating your<U+017F>elf at Table, I would not have
you placed over-again<U+017F>t a very Beautiful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
for in <U+017F>uch a one there are a thou<U+017F>and
little Graces, in Speaking, Looking, and
Laughing, that fail not to Charm if one gives
way to the Eyes, to gaze and wander that
way; in which, perhaps, in <U+017F>pight of you,
you will find a Plea<U+017F>ure; And while you do <U+017F>o,
though without De<U+017F>ign or Concern, you give
the fair Charmer a <U+017F>ort of Vanity, in believing
you have placed your<U+017F>elf there, only for the
Advantage of Looking on her; and a<U+017F><U+017F>umes a
hundred little Graces and Affectations, which
are not Natural to her, to compleat a Conque<U+017F>t,
which <U+017F>he believes <U+017F>o well begun already. She
<U+017F>oftens her Eyes, and <U+017F>weetens her Mouth; and
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc><<U+25CA>></desc>
                        </gap>, puts on another Air, than when <U+017F>he had
no De<U+017F>ign; and when you did not, by your
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47213:172"/>
continual looking on her, rouze her Vanity,
and increa<U+017F>e her ea<U+017F>ie Opinion of her own
Charms. Perhaps <U+017F>he knows, I have <U+017F>ome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t
in your Heart; and Prides her<U+017F>elf, at
lea<U+017F>t, with believing, <U+017F>he has attracted the Eyes
of my Lover, if not his Heart; and thinks it
ea<U+017F>ie to vanqui<U+017F>h the Whole, if <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>es; and
triumphs over me in her <U+017F>ecret Imaginations.
Remember, <hi>Damon,</hi> that while you act thus in
the Company and Conver<U+017F>ation of other Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that every Look, or Word you give in
favour of 'em, is an Indignity to my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, which you cannot <U+017F>uffer, if you
love me truly, and with Honour: And, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
your<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>o much Vanity as you in<U+017F>pire in her,
<U+017F>o much Fame you rob me of; for whatever
Prai<U+017F>es you give another Beauty, <U+017F>o much you
take away from mine. Therefore, if you Dine
in Company, do as others do: Be generally
Civil, not applying your<U+017F>elf, by Words, or
Looks to any particular Per<U+017F>on: Be as gay as
you plea<U+017F>e: Talk and laugh with all, for this is
not the Hour for Chagrin.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47213:173"/>

in a Heart, he reigns a Tyrant there, and
will not <U+017F>uffer even Friend<U+017F>hip, if it pretend to

                        <p>I <U+017F>hould be very angry; if you had any of
tho<U+017F>e Friend<U+017F>hips, which one ought to de<U+017F>ire in
a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s only; for many times it happens,
that you have Sentiments a little too tender for
tho<U+017F>e Amiable Per<U+017F>ons; and many times Love
and Friend<U+017F>hip are <U+017F>o confounded together, that
one cannot ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>cern one from t'other. I
have <U+017F>een a Man flatter him<U+017F>elf with an Opinion,
that he had but an E<U+017F>teem for a Woman, when
by <U+017F>ome Turn of Fortune in her Life, as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47213:174"/>
or Receiving the Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of Men, he
has found, by Spight and Jealou<U+017F>ies within, that
that was Love, which he before took for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plai<U+017F>ance,
or Friend<U+017F>hip. Therefore have a
Care; for <U+017F>uch Amities are dangerous. Not
but that a Lover may have Fair and Generous
Female-Friends, whom he ought to vi<U+017F>it; and
perhaps, I <U+017F>hou'd e<U+017F>teem you le<U+017F>s, if I did not
believe you were valued by <U+017F>uch, if I were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
a<U+017F><U+017F>ured they were Friends, and not Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
But have a Care, you hide not a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
under this Veil, or that you gain not a Lover
by this Pretence: For you may begin with
Friend<U+017F>hip, and end with Love; and I <U+017F>hou'd
be equally afflicted, <U+017F>hou'd you give it, or receive
it. And though you charge our Sex with all
the Vanity; yet I often find Nature to have
given you as large a Portion of that Common
Crime, which you wou'd <U+017F>huffle off, as a<U+017F>ham'd
to own; and are as fond and vain of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of a Conque<U+017F>t, as any Coquet of us all;
though, at the <U+017F>ame time, you de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim,
you think it adds a Trophy to your Fame.
And I have <U+017F>een a Man dre<U+017F>s, and trick, and
adju<U+017F>t his Looks and Mien, to make a Vi<U+017F>it to a
Woman he lov'd, nor ever cou'd love, not as for
tho<U+017F>e he made to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; and only for the
Vanity of making a Conque<U+017F>t upon a Heart, even
unworthy of the little Pains he has taken about
it. And what is this but buying Vanity at the
Expence of Sence and Ea<U+017F>e; and with Fatigue,
purcha<U+017F>e the Name of a Conceited Fop, be<U+017F>ides
that of a Di<U+017F>hone<U+017F>t Man? For he who takes
Pains to make him<U+017F>elf Belov'd, only to plea<U+017F>e his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47213:174"/>
curious Humour, tho' he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay nothing that
tends to it, more than by his Looks, his Sighs,
and now and then breaking into Prai<U+017F>es and
Commendations of the Object, by the Care he
takes, to appear well dre<U+017F>t before her, and in
good order; he lyes in his Looks, he deceives
with his Mien and Fa<U+017F>hion, and cheats with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Motion, and every Grace he puts on: He
cozens when he Sings, or Dances; he di<U+017F><U+017F>embles
when he Sighs; and every thing he does, that
wilfully gains upon her, is Malice propen<U+017F>e,
Ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s, and Art below a Man of Sence, or
Vertue: And yet the<U+017F>e Arts, the<U+017F>e Coz'nages,
are the common Practices of the Town. What's
this but that damnable Vice, of which they <U+017F>o
reproach our Sex; that of Jilting for Hearts?
And 'tis in vain, that my Lover, after <U+017F>uch foul
Play, <U+017F>hall think to appea<U+017F>e me, with <U+017F>aying, <hi>He
did it to try how ea<U+017F>ie he cou'd Conquer, and of how
great Force his Charms were: And why <U+017F>hou'd I be
angry, if all the Town lov'd him, <U+017F>ince he lov'd none
but</hi> Iris? Oh fooli<U+017F>h Plea<U+017F>ure! How little Sence
goes to the making of <U+017F>uch a Happine<U+017F>s? And
how little Love mu<U+017F>t he have for one particular
Per<U+017F>on, who wou'd wi<U+017F>h to in<U+017F>pire it into all the
World, and yet him<U+017F>elf pretend to be in<U+017F>en<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
But this (<hi>Damon</hi>) is rather what is but
too much practi<U+017F>ed by your Sex, than any Guilt
I charge on you; tho' Vanity be an Ingredient
that Nature very <U+017F>eldom omits in the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition
of either Sex; and you may be allow'd a
Tincture of it at lea<U+017F>t. And, perhaps, I am not
wholly exempt from this Leaven in my Nature,
but accu<U+017F>e my<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ometimes of finding a <U+017F>ecret
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:175"/>
Joy of being ador'd, tho' I even hate my Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hipper.
But if any <U+017F>uch Plea<U+017F>ure touch my
Heart, I find it at the <U+017F>ame time blu<U+017F>hing in my
Cheeks with a guilty Shame; which <U+017F>oon checks
the petty Triumph, and I have a Vertue at <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berer

and Indi<U+017F>cretion; and I hope <hi>Damon</hi> finds
the <U+017F>ame: For, <U+017F>hould he have any of tho<U+017F>e At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments,
I <U+017F>hould have no Pity for him.</p>

the tender Things a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <U+017F>ays to a Lover;

her, who <U+017F>igh'd 'em fir<U+017F>t to her lavi<U+017F>h Lover.
Perhaps they are told again with Mirth, or Joy,
unbecoming their Character and Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; and
then they lo<U+017F>e their Graces; (for Love is
the mo<U+017F>t Solemn Thing in Nature, and the mo<U+017F>t

when it cea<U+017F>es to be a Secret, and one you

mi<U+017F>interpret Love, as they do Religion; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one judging it, according to the Notion he
had of it, or the Talent of his Sence. <hi>Love,</hi> as
a great Duke <U+017F>aid, <hi>is like Apparitions; every one
talks of 'em, but few have <U+017F>een 'em:</hi> Every Body
thinks him<U+017F>elf capable of under<U+017F>tanding Love,
and that he is a Ma<U+017F>ter in the Art of it; when
there is nothing <U+017F>o nice, or difficult, to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comprehended; and indeed, cannot be, but
to a Soul very delicate. Nor will he make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
known to the Vulgar: There mu<U+017F>t be an
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47213:177"/>

him; the re<U+017F>t, he only vi<U+017F>its in as many Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>es,
as there are Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions and Natures;
where he makes but a <U+017F>hort <U+017F>tay, and is gone.
He can fit him<U+017F>elf to all Hearts, being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
Flatterer in the World: And he po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

him perfectly, when nothing but the Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd,
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s him in his Excellency. From this
difference of Love, in different Souls, proceeds
tho<U+017F>e odd fanta<U+017F>tick Maxims, which <U+017F>o many
hold of <U+017F>o different Kinds: And this makes the

cannot hide the lea<U+017F>t Secret from me, without
Trea<U+017F>on again<U+017F>t Sacred Love. For all the
World agrees, that Confidence is one of the
greate<U+017F>t Proofs of the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Love; and that
Lover, who refu<U+017F>es this Confidence to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
he loves, is to be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected to love but very
indifferently, and to think very poorly of the
Sence and Genero<U+017F>ity of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. But, that
you may acquit your <U+017F>elf like a Man, and a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Soul; think of all you have done this Day, that
I may have all the Story of it in your next

add, nor dimini<U+017F>h, in your Relation; the

again<U+017F>t me, in <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e Things you

or Circum<U+017F>tance of Love, I had much rather
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47213:183"/>
hear it from you than another: For 'tis a <U+017F>ort of
Repentance to accu<U+017F>e your<U+017F>elf; and wou'd be

you. The noble<U+017F>t Quality of Man, is Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity;
and (<hi>Damon</hi>) one ought to have as

<U+017F>elf of all the pa<U+017F>t Actions of the Day,
call your Page into your Cabinet, or him whom
you tru<U+017F>ted with your la<U+017F>t Letter to me; where
you ought to enquire of him a thou<U+017F>and things;
and all of me. Ask impatiently; and be angry,
if he an<U+017F>wers not your Curio<U+017F>ity <U+017F>oon enough:
Think that he has a Dreaming in his Voice, in
the<U+017F>e Moments, more than at other times; and
reproach him with Dulne<U+017F>s. For 'tis mo<U+017F>t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that when one loves tenderly, we wou'd
know in a Minute, what cannot be related in an
Hour. Ask him, How I did? How I receiv'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47213:184"/>
his Letter? And if he examin'd the Air of my
Face, when I took it? If I blu<U+017F>h'd, or look'd
pale? If my Hand trembled, or I <U+017F>poke to him
with <U+017F>hort interrupting Sighs? If I ask'd him
any Que<U+017F>tions about you, while I was opening
the Seal? Or if I cou'd not well <U+017F>peak, and was
<U+017F>ilent? If I read it attentively, and with Joy?
And all this, before you open the An<U+017F>wer I have
<U+017F>ent you by him: Which, becau<U+017F>e you are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to read, you, with the more Ha<U+017F>te <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s, demand all you expect from him;
and that you may the better know, what Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
I was in, when I writ that to you. For,
Oh! A Lover has a thou<U+017F>and little Fears, and
Dreads, he knows not why. In fine, make him
recount to you all that pa<U+017F>t, while he was with
me: And then you ought to read that which I
have <U+017F>ent, that you may inform your <U+017F>elf of all
that pa<U+017F><U+017F>es in my Heart; for you may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure

and never could be drawn to allow it any other.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47213:186"/>
The fir<U+017F>t thing you ought to con<U+017F>ider is, that at
length I have <U+017F>uffer'd my <U+017F>elf to be overcome, to
quit that Nicety that is natural to me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es; nay, thought 'em agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and that I have at la<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>t, the Pre<U+017F>ent
of your Heart is very dear to me. 'Tis true, I
did not accept of it the fir<U+017F>t time it was offer'd
me, nor before you had told me a thou<U+017F>and
times, that you could not e<U+017F>cape expiring, if I
did not give you leave to <U+017F>igh for me, and gaze
upon me; and that there was an ab<U+017F>olute nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity
for me, either to give you leave to love, or
die. And all tho<U+017F>e Rigors my Severity has made
you <U+017F>uffer, ought now to be recounted to your
Memory, as Subjects of Plea<U+017F>ure; and you ought
to e<U+017F>teem and judge of the Price of my Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by the Difficulties you found in being able
to touch my Heart: Not but you have Charms
that can conquer at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight; and you ought
not to have valued me le<U+017F>s, if I had been more
ea<U+017F>ily gain'd: But 'tis enough to plea<U+017F>e you, to
think and know I am gain'd; no matter when
or how. When, after a thou<U+017F>and Cares and
Inquietudes, that which we wi<U+017F>h for <U+017F>ucceeds
to our De<U+017F>ires, the Remembrance of tho<U+017F>e Pains
and Plea<U+017F>ures we encounter'd, in arriving at it,
gives us a new Joy.</p>
                     <p>Remember al<U+017F>o (<hi>Damon</hi>) that I have prefer'd
you before all tho<U+017F>e that have been thought
worthy of my E<U+017F>teem; and that I have <U+017F>hut
my Eyes to all their pleading Merits, and cou'd
<U+017F>urvey none but yours.</p>
                     <p>Con<U+017F>ider then, that you had not only the
Happine<U+017F>s to plea<U+017F>e me, but that you only
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47213:187"/>
found out the way of doing it, and I had the
Goodne<U+017F>s at la<U+017F>t to tell you <U+017F>o, contrary to all

know, are natural to my Humour.</p>
                     <p>My Tenderne<U+017F>s proceeded further, and I
gave you innocent Marks of my new-born Pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
on all Occa<U+017F>ions that pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves:

Glory of a Slave, without any other Intere<U+017F>t, or
De<U+017F>ign, than that of being ador'd. I will give
you leave to think my Heart fickle, and that,
far from re<U+017F>igning it to any one, I lend it only

for I would never pardon you the lea<U+017F>t Offence
of this nature, if in any other kind than in a

imagine me thus idly vain; but you are to pa<U+017F>s

that I will, my<U+017F>elf, do tho<U+017F>e Things, which I
violently condemn in you; and that I will have
for others, as well as you, that tender Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip
that re<U+017F>embles Love, or rather that Love
which People call Friend<U+017F>hip; and that I will

pa<U+017F>s a great part of your idle Time in <U+017F>urveying

Times; your Honour, Duty, Love, and

omit no part of that Devoir. You ought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h
your Fortune aud your Glory: For I
am not of the Mind of tho<U+017F>e Critical Lovers,
who believe it a very hard Matter to reconcile
Love and Intere<U+017F>t, to adore a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>erve
a Ma<U+017F>ter at the <U+017F>ame time. And I have heard

Does not your <hi>Watch, Iris,</hi> rule the Heart?
It was your Heart that contriv'd it, and 'twas
your Heart you con<U+017F>ulted in all the management

performs with Plea<U+017F>ure.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Watch,</hi> my lovely Maid, has explain'd
to me a World of rich Secrets of Love: And
where <U+017F>hou'd Thoughts <U+017F>o <U+017F>acred be <U+017F>tor'd, but
in the Heart, where all the Secrets of the Soul

can take a View? 'Tis thence he takes his Sighs

Heart to contain it; and it concerns my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t
too much, not to be infinitely careful of <U+017F>o

conceal the lea<U+017F>t part of their Love; but Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
has an Ardour, as well as Ro<U+017F>es; and a
Lover ought to e<U+017F>teem that as the deare<U+017F>t and

which is, indeed, the lea<U+017F>t part; but that of his
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, more valuable to him than Life. He
ought to endeavour to give People no occa<U+017F>ion
to make fal<U+017F>e Judgments of his Actions or to
give their Cen<U+017F>ures; which, mo<U+017F>t certainly are

this fooli<U+017F>h <U+017F>candalous World! And tho' we

That Vertue ought to be a Guard to all the

therefore <U+017F>ee, through this Heart, all your
Watch. Nor is my De<U+017F>ire of pre<U+017F>erving this

that Reciprocal Love is Ju<U+017F>tice; Con<U+017F>tant Love,
Fortitude; Secret Love, Prudence? Though
'tis true, that Extream Love, that is, Exce<U+017F>s
of Love, in one Sen<U+017F>e, appears not to be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance;
yet you mu<U+017F>t know, my <hi>Iris,</hi> that in
Matters of Love, Exce<U+017F>s is a Vertue, and that
all other Degrees of Love are worthy Scorn
alone. 'Tis this alone, that can make good
the glorious Title: 'Tis this alone, that can
bear the true Name of Love; and this alone,
that can bear the true Name of Love; and
this alone, that renders the Lovers truly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
in <U+017F>pight of all the Storms of Fate, and
Shocks of Fortune. This is an Antidote again<U+017F>t
all other Griefs: This bears up the Soul in all
Calamity; and is the very Heaven of Life, the

                  <p>HOW long, O charming <hi>Iris!</hi> <U+017F>hall
I <U+017F>peak in vain of your adorable
Beauty? You have been ju<U+017F>t, and
believe I love you with a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
perfectly tender and extream; and yet you
will not allow your Charms to be infinite.
You mu<U+017F>t either accu<U+017F>e my Flames to be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable,
and that my Eyes and Heart are fal<U+017F>e
Judges of Wit and Beauty; or allow, that
you are the mo<U+017F>t perfect of your Sex. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of that, you always accu<U+017F>e of me Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
when I <U+017F>peak of your infinite Merit; and
when I refer you to your Gla<U+017F>s, you tell me,
that flatters, as well as <hi>Damon;</hi> though one
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47213:214"/>
wou'd imagine, that <U+017F>hou'd be a good Witne<U+017F>s
for the Truth of what I <U+017F>ay, and undeceive you
of the Opinion of my Inju<U+017F>tice. Look—and
confirm your<U+017F>elf, that nothing can equal your
Perfections. All the World <U+017F>ays it, and you
mu<U+017F>t doubt it no longer. <hi>O Iris!</hi> Will you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pute
again<U+017F>t the whole World?</p>
                  <p>But <U+017F>ince you have <U+017F>o long di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ted your
own Gla<U+017F>s, I have here pre<U+017F>ented you with one,
which I know is very true; and having been
made for you only, can <U+017F>erve only you. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es pre<U+017F>ent all Objects, but this reflects
only <hi>Iris;</hi> whenever you con<U+017F>ult it, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you; and tell you, how much Right I
have done you, when I told you, you were the
faire<U+017F>t Per<U+017F>on that ever Nature made. When
other Beauties look into it, it will <U+017F>peak to all
the fair Ones; but let 'em do what they will,
'twill <U+017F>ay nothing to their Advantage.</p>

a Woman of your Acquaintance, who, having
a greater Opinion of her own Per<U+017F>on, than any
Body el<U+017F>e, has <U+017F>crew'd her Body into <U+017F>o fine a

<U+017F>tir a Hand, lift up an Arm, or turn her Head
a<U+017F>ide, than if, for the Sin of <U+017F>uch a Di<U+017F>order,
<U+017F>he were to be turn'd into a Pillar of Salt; the

But here behold, and be convinc'd; and know,
no part of your Beauty can charm more than
this. O <hi>Iris,</hi> confe<U+017F>s, Love has adorn'd you

                        <p>YOU are deceiv'd in me, fair <hi>Iris,</hi> if you
take me for one of tho<U+017F>e ordinary Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es,
that repre<U+017F>ent the Beauty only of the Body; I
remark to you al<U+017F>o the Beauties of the Soul:
And all about you declares yours the fine<U+017F>t that
ever was formed; that you have a Wit that
<U+017F>urprizes, and is always new: 'Tis none of
tho<U+017F>e that lo<U+017F>es its Lu<U+017F>tre, when one con<U+017F>iders
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:223"/>
it; the more we examine yours, the more ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
we find it. You <U+017F>ay nothing, that is not
at once agreeable and <U+017F>olid; 'tis always quick
and ready, without Impertinence, that little
Vanity of the Fair; who, when they know
they have Wit, rarely manage it <U+017F>o, as not to
abound in Talking; and think, that all they
<U+017F>ay mu<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e luckily, they <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

but 'tis of u<U+017F>e; and gives a Plea<U+017F>ure to all that
hears her. She has the perfect Art of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating,
even the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret Thoughts. How
often have you known, without being told, all
that has pa<U+017F>t in <hi>Damon</hi>'s Heart? For all great

that perfect Tranquility of Life, which is no where

and Ma<U+017F>ters that could be purcha<U+017F>ed at Court;
<hi>Bellyaurd</hi> making far le<U+017F>s account of Riches than of

There lived in a Neighbouring Town, a certain
Nobleman, Friend to <hi>De Pais,</hi> call'd Count <hi>Vernole,</hi> a
Man of about Forty Years of Age, of low Stature,
Complexion very black and <U+017F>warthy, lean, lame, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
proud and haughty; extracted of a De<U+017F>cent
from the Blood-Royal; not extreamly brave, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glorious: He had no very great E<U+017F>tate, but was in
Election of a greater, and of an Addition of Honour
from the King, his Father having done mo<U+017F>t worthy
Services again<U+017F>t the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and by the high Favour
of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> was repre<U+017F>ented to his Maje<U+017F>ty,
as a Man related to the Crown, of great Name, but
<U+017F>mall E<U+017F>tate; <U+017F>o that there was now nothing but great
Expectations and Preparations in the Family of Count
<hi>Vernole</hi> to go to Court, to which he daily hop'd an
Invitation or Command.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vernole</hi>'s Fortune being hitherto <U+017F>omething a kin to
that of <hi>De Pais,</hi> there was a greater Corre<U+017F>pondency
between the<U+017F>e two Gentlemen, than they had with
any other Per<U+017F>ons; they accounting them<U+017F>elves above
the re<U+017F>t of the World, believ'd none <U+017F>o proper and fit
for their Conver<U+017F>ation, as that of each other; <U+017F>o that
there was a very particular Intimacy between them:
Whenever they went abroad, they clubb'd their Train,
to make one great Show, and were always together,
bemoaning each other's Fortune, that from <U+017F>o high a
De<U+017F>cent, as one from Monarchs by the Mother's <U+017F>ide,
and the other from Dukes of his <U+017F>ide, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by Fate, to the degree of private Gentlemen.
They would often con<U+017F>ult how to manage Affairs mo<U+017F>t
to advantage, and often <hi>De Pais</hi> would ask Coun<U+017F>el of
<hi>Vernole,</hi> how be<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of his Daughters,
which now were about their ninth Year the elde<U+017F>t,
and eight the younge<U+017F>t. <hi>Vernole</hi> had often <U+017F>een the<U+017F>e
two Buds of Beauty, and already <U+017F>aw opening in <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante</hi>'s
Face and Mind (for that was the Name of the
elde<U+017F>t, and <hi>Charlot</hi> the younge<U+017F>t) a Glory of Wit and
Beauty, which could not but one day di<U+017F>play it<U+017F>elf,
with dazling Lu<U+017F>tre, to the wondring World.</p>

                     <hi>Vernole</hi> was a great Virtuo<U+017F>o, of a Humour, Nice,
Delicate, Critical and Opinionative: He had nothing of
the <hi>French</hi> Mien in him, but all the Gravity of the
Don. His ill-favour'd Per<U+017F>on, and his low E<U+017F>tate, put
him out of Humour with the World; and becau<U+017F>e
that <U+017F>hould not upbraid or reproach his Follies and
Defects, he was <U+017F>ure to be before-hand with that, and
to be always Satyrick upon it, and lov'd to live and
act contrary to the Cu<U+017F>tom and U<U+017F>age of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
be<U+017F>ides.</p>
                  <p>He was infinitely delighted to find a Man of his own
Humour in <hi>De Pais,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t a Man that would be
per<U+017F>waded to like his <U+017F>o well, to live up to it; and it
was no little Joy and Satisfaction to him to find, that
he kept his Daughters in that <U+017F>everity, which was
wholly agreeable to him, and <U+017F>o contrary to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and Fa<U+017F>hion of the <hi>French</hi> of Quality; who allow
all Freedoms, which to <hi>Vernole</hi>'s rigid Nature, <U+017F>eem'd
as <U+017F>o many Steps to Vice, and in his Opinion, the
Ruiner of all Vertue and Honour in Woman-kind.
<hi>De Pais</hi> was extreamly glad his Conduct was <U+017F>o well
interpreted, which was no other in him, than a proud
Frugality; who, becau<U+017F>e they could not appear, in<U+017F>o
much Gallantry, as their Quality requir'd, kept 'em
retir'd, and un<U+017F>een to all, but his particular Friends,
of which <hi>Vernole</hi> was chief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vernole</hi> never appear'd before <hi>Atlante</hi> (which was
<U+017F>eldom,) but he a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd a Gravity and Re<U+017F>pect, fit to
have entertain'd a Maid of Twenty, or rather a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
of much greater Years and Judgment. His Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>es
were always of Matters of State or Philo<U+017F>ophy;
and <U+017F>ometimes when <hi>De Pais</hi> would Laughing, <U+017F>ay, <hi>He
might as well entertain</hi> Atlante <hi>with</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Hebrew,
would reply gravely; <hi>You are mi<U+017F>taken Sir, I find the
Seeds of great and profound Matter in the Soul of the
young Maid, which ought to be nouri<U+017F>h'd, now while <U+017F>he
was young, and they will grow up to very great Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I find</hi> Atlante <hi>capable of all the Noble Vertues of the

Things than her Fortune does now promi<U+017F>e: She will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Con<U+017F>iderable in the World, believe me, and this will
arrive to her perfectly from the Force of her Charms. De
Pais</hi> was extreamly overjoy'd to hear <U+017F>uch Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe<U+017F>ied
to <hi>Atlante,</hi> and from that time, <U+017F>et a <U+017F>ort of
an E<U+017F>teem upon her, which he did not on <hi>Charlot</hi> his
younger; who, by the Per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions of <hi>Vernole,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd
to put in a Mona<U+017F>tery, that what he had might
de<U+017F>cend to <hi>Atlante;</hi> not but he confe<U+017F>s'd <hi>Charlot</hi> had
Beauty, extreamly attractive, and a Wit that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
much, when it <U+017F>hould be cultivated by Years and
Experience; and would <U+017F>hew it<U+017F>elf with great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and Lu<U+017F>tre in a Mona<U+017F>tery: All this plea<U+017F>ed <hi>De

had not a Fortune to marry her well in the World.</p>
                  <p>As yet <hi>Vernole</hi> had never <U+017F>poke to <hi>Atlante</hi> of Love;
nor did his Gravity think it Prudence to di<U+017F>cover his
Heart to <U+017F>o young a Maid, he waited her more <U+017F>en<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Years, when he could hoope to have <U+017F>ome return.
And all he expected from this her tender Age, was by
his daily Conver<U+017F>e with her, and the Pre<U+017F>ents, he made
her <U+017F>uitable to her Years, to ingratiate him<U+017F>elf in<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly
into her Friend<U+017F>hip and E<U+017F>teem: Since <U+017F>he was
not yet capable of Love, but even in that he mi<U+017F>took
his Aim, for every day he grew more and more di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to <hi>Atlante,</hi> and would have been her ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Aver<U+017F>ion, had <U+017F>he known, <U+017F>he had every day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
a Lover; but as <U+017F>he grew in Years and Sen<U+017F>e,
he <U+017F>eemed the more de<U+017F>picable in her Eyes as to his
Per<U+017F>on; but as <U+017F>he had re<U+017F>pect to his Parts, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<U+017F>he paid him all the Complai<U+017F>ance <U+017F>he could,
and which was due to him; and <U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F>s'd,
tho' he had a <U+017F>tiff Formality in all he <U+017F>aid and did,
yet he had Wit and Learning, and was a great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>opher;
as much of his Learning, as <hi>Atlante</hi> was
capable of attaining to, he made her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of, and
that was no <U+017F>mall Portion, for all his Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was

But <hi>Atlante</hi> wou'd di<U+017F>creetly reply, <hi>If I must grant al

                  <p>
                     <hi>Atlante</hi> was now arriv'd to her thirteenth Year,
when her Beauty, which every day increas'd, became
the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the whole Town; which had already
gain'd her as many Lovers as had beheld her, for none
<U+017F>aw her without langui<U+017F>hing for her, or at lea<U+017F>t, but
what were in very great Admiration of her. Every

who had Sons (knowing the Smallne<U+017F>s of her
Fortune, and the Lu<U+017F>tre of her Beauty) would <U+017F>end
them for fear of their being Charm'd with her, either
to <U+017F>ome other part of the World, or exhorted them,
by way of Precaution, to keep out of her <U+017F>ight. Old
<hi>Bellyuard</hi> was one of tho<U+017F>e wi<U+017F>e Parents, and by a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prevention, as he thought of <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s falling in

frames a thou<U+017F>and Idea's, all <U+017F>uch as were mo<U+017F>t agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

more to <U+017F>ee her, to know how near <U+017F>he approaches to

tho' he knew <U+017F>he liv'd the next Hou<U+017F>e to him, yet he

before <U+017F>he was aware of it, turn'd her Head, and look'd
on <hi>Rinaldo;</hi> which encourag'd him to advance, and
putting off his Hat, which he clapt under his Arm,

Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Atlante,</hi> blu<U+017F>hing, <hi>we fear no In<U+017F>olence, and need
no Protector; or if we did, we <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>o rude, to

<hi>my Way lies yours, I live at the next Door, and am Son

he, <hi>if I were to go all my Life out of the Way, to do you
Service, I <U+017F>hould take it for the greatest Happine<U+017F>s, that

My pretty Mis,</hi> reply'd <hi>Rinaldo, I knew it from the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cendent

for I have heard, there was no Beauty in the World, like

Plea<U+017F>ure: And in this, how great an Advantage have
you, fair Ladies, above us Men? 'Tis almost impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
for you to love in vain, you have your Choice of a thou<U+017F>and
Hearts, which you have <U+017F>ubdu'd, and may not only chu<U+017F>e
your Slaves, but be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of 'em; without <U+017F>peaking you

Indeed, 'tis pity, <hi><U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,</hi> Pray how long have you been

have <U+017F>een her, I die for her. For me, Sir, <hi><U+017F>aid</hi> Atlante,
(who had not yet <U+017F>poke) this is the common Complement
of all the young Men, who pretend to be Lovers; and if
one <U+017F>hould pity all tho<U+017F>e Sighers, we <U+017F>hould have but very
little left for our<U+017F>elves. I believe, <hi><U+017F>aith</hi> Rinaldo, there
are none that tell you <U+017F>o, who do not mean as they <U+017F>ay;
yet among all tho<U+017F>e Adorers, and tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ay they will
die for you, you will find none will be <U+017F>o good as their Words
as <hi>Rinaldo.</hi> Perhaps, <hi><U+017F>aid</hi> Atlante, of all tho<U+017F>e who tell
me of dying, there are none that tell it with <U+017F>o little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
as <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> if that be your Name, Sir. Madam, it
is, <hi><U+017F>aid he,</hi> and who am tran<U+017F>ported with an un<U+017F>peakable
Joy, to hear tho<U+017F>e last Words from your fair Mouth; and

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:231"/>
<U+017F>aid, are not Words of Cour<U+017F>e, but proceed from a Heart
that has vow'd it<U+017F>elf eternally yours, even before I had the
Happine<U+017F>s to behold this Divine Per<U+017F>on; but now that
my Eyes have made good all my Heart before imagin'd,
and did but hope: I <U+017F>wear, I will die à thou<U+017F>and
Deaths, rather than violate what I have <U+017F>aid to you; That
Indore you, that my Soul, and all my Faculties are charm'd
with your Beauty and Innocence, and that my Life and
Fortune, not incon<U+017F>iderable, <U+017F>hall be laid at your Feet.
<hi>This he <U+017F>poke with a Fervency of Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that left her
no doubt of what he had <U+017F>aid; yet <U+017F>he blu<U+017F>h'd for

And in this Confu<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he replied,</hi> Sir, you have

of which Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion I accu<U+017F>e my<U+017F>elf much more

without forbidding you to entertain me at that rate, but
for unheedily <U+017F>peaking <U+017F>omething, that has encourag'd this

<U+017F>ometimes in your Balcony, which is very near to a jetting
Window in our Hou<U+017F>e, from whence I have <U+017F>ent many a

mine as refractory, tho' he cannot but know <U+017F>uch an

Rinaldo, <hi><U+017F>ighing,</hi> if my Per<U+017F>on be not di<U+017F>agreeable to you,
you will have no occa<U+017F>ion to fear the rest, 'tis that I dread,
and that which is all my fear. <hi>He, <U+017F>ighing, beheld her
with a langui<U+017F>hing Look, that told her, he expected
her An<U+017F>wer; when <U+017F>he reply'd,</hi> Sir, if that will be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
enough for you at this time, I do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, I
have no Aver<U+017F>ion for your Per<U+017F>on, in which I find more to

<U+017F>ay be real, and proceed from a Heart truly affected, I
find, in <U+017F>pight of me, you will oblige me to give you

                  <p>They were come <U+017F>o near their own Hou<U+017F>es, that he
had not time to return her any An<U+017F>wer, but with a low
Bow he acknowledg'd her Bounty, and expre<U+017F>s'd the
Joy her la<U+017F>t Words had given him, by a Look that
made her under<U+017F>tand, he was charm'd and pleas'd;
and <U+017F>he bowing to him with an Air of Satisfaction in
her Face, he was well a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, there was nothing to
be <U+017F>een <U+017F>o lovely as <U+017F>he then appear'd, and left her to
go into her own Hou<U+017F>e; but 'till <U+017F>he was out of <U+017F>ight,
he had not power to <U+017F>tir, and then <U+017F>ighing, retired to
his own Appartment, to think over all that had pa<U+017F>t

a thou<U+017F>and Joys, in all <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid; and he ble<U+017F>t this
happy Day, and wondred how his Stars came <U+017F>o kind,
to make him one hour at once <U+017F>ee <hi>Atlante,</hi> and have the
Happine<U+017F>s to know from her own Mouth, that he was
not di<U+017F>agreeable to her: Yet with this Satisfaction, he
had a thou<U+017F>and Thoughts mix'd, which were torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and tho<U+017F>e were the Fear of their Parents; he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aw
from what his Father had <U+017F>aid to him already, that
it would be difficult to draw him to a Con<U+017F>ent of his
Marriage with <hi>Atlante:</hi> The<U+017F>e Joys and Fears were
his Companions all the Night, in which he took but
little re<U+017F>t. Nor was <hi>Atlante</hi> without her Inquietudes:
She <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and a <U+017F>udden change of Humour, that made her know
<U+017F>omething was the matter with her, more than u<U+017F>ual;
<U+017F>he calls to mind <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s <U+017F>peaking of the Conver<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with his Heart, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to her, if <U+017F>he would give way to it; and yet the more
<U+017F>he <U+017F>trove to avoid it, the more it importun'd her, and
in <U+017F>pight of all her Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, would tell her, that <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi>
had a thou<U+017F>and Charms: It tells her, that he
loves and adores her, and that <U+017F>he would be the mo<U+017F>t
cruel of her Sex, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he not be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his Pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion.
She finds a thou<U+017F>and Graces in his Per<U+017F>on and
Conver<U+017F>ation, and as many Advantages in his Fortune,
which was one of the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable in all tho<U+017F>e
Parts; for his E<U+017F>tate exceeded that of the mo<U+017F>t Noble
Men in <hi>Orleance,</hi> and <U+017F>he imagines <U+017F>he would be the
mo<U+017F>t fortunate of all Womankind, in <U+017F>uch a Match.
With the<U+017F>e Thoughts <U+017F>he employ'd all the Hours of the
Night; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he lay <U+017F>o long in Bed the next Day,
that Count <hi>Vernole,</hi> who had invited him<U+017F>elf to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
came before <U+017F>he had quitted her Chamber, and
<U+017F>he was forc'd to <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he had not been well. He had
brought her a very fine Book, newly come out, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Philo<U+017F>ophy, fit for the Study of Ladies. But he
appear'd <U+017F>o di<U+017F>agreeable to that Heart, wholly taken
up with a new and fine Object, that <U+017F>he could now
hardly pay him that Civility <U+017F>he was wont to do; while
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47213:233"/>
on the other <U+017F>ide, that little State and Pride <hi>Atlante</hi>
a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd, made her appear the more charming to him;
<U+017F>o that if <hi>Atlante</hi> had no Mind to begin a new Le<U+017F><U+017F>on
of Philo<U+017F>ophy, while <U+017F>he fancied her Thoughts were
much better employ'd, the Count every Moment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing
his Tenderne<U+017F>s and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, had as little an
Inclination to in<U+017F>truct her, as <U+017F>he was to be in<U+017F>truct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Love had taught her a new Le<U+017F><U+017F>on, and he would
fain teach her a new Le<U+017F><U+017F>on of Love, but fears it will
be a dimini<U+017F>hing of his Gravity and Grandeur, to open
the Secrets of his Heart to <U+017F>o young a Maid; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thinks it more agreeable to his Quality and Years,
being about Forty, to u<U+017F>e her Father's Authority in
this Affair, and that it was <U+017F>ufficient for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

before he could per<U+017F>wade him<U+017F>elf, even to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
to her Father; he fancies, the little Coldne<U+017F>s and
Pride he <U+017F>aw in <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Face, which was not u<U+017F>ual,
proceeded from <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>covery of Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which his
Eyes had made, or now and then a Sigh, that una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
broke forth, and accu<U+017F>es him<U+017F>elf of a Levity
below his Quality, and the Dignity of his Wit and
Gravity; and therefore, a<U+017F><U+017F>umes a more rigid and
formal Behaviour than he was wont, which rendred
him yet more di<U+017F>agreeable than before; and 'twas

Fortune: To this he urged again, that he was his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Life; and that certainly, as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>hould behold

Parent, would break forth into Pity and Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
and plead within for his Con<U+017F>ent. The<U+017F>e were the
Thoughts that flattered this young Lover all the Day,

Study of Philo<U+017F>ophy, or Mathematicks, Singing, Dancing,
or what<U+017F>oever other Exerci<U+017F>e his Tutors ordered, his
Thoughts were continually on <hi>Atlante,</hi> and now he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
no more; whatever he <U+017F>eem'd to do, every Day
he fail'd not to write to her by the Hand of the kind <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot;</hi>
who young as <U+017F>he was, had conceiv'd a very great
Friend<U+017F>hip for <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> and fail'd not to fetch her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

But all this did not <U+017F>atisfie our impatient Lover;
Ab<U+017F>ence kill'd, and he was no longer able to <U+017F>upport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
without a <U+017F>ight of this adorable Maid; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
implores, <U+017F>he will give him that Satisfaction: And
<U+017F>he at la<U+017F>t grants it, with a better Will than he imagin'd.
The next Day was the appointed time, when <U+017F>he would,
under pretence of going to Church, give him an A<U+017F><U+017F>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
And becau<U+017F>e all Publick Places were dangerous,

reads her Heart in her Looks, and found it yielding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace;
and therefore a<U+017F><U+017F>aults it anew, with fre<U+017F>h Forces

by yielding to marry him: He would carry her to the

which he was able to live no longer; for he had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Fears, that <U+017F>ome other Lover was, or would <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly

make <U+017F>ure of her, while he had this Opportunity; and
to that end, he an<U+017F>wered all the Objections <U+017F>he could
make to the contrary: But ever, when he nam'd Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,

<U+017F>he fancy'd <U+017F>he ought not to do, without the Con<U+017F>ent of
her Father: She was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the Advantage, but had
been <U+017F>o us'd to a <U+017F>trict Obedience, that <U+017F>he could not,
without Horrour, think of violating it; and therefore
be<U+017F>ought him, as he valu'd her Repo<U+017F>e, not to urge her
to that. And told him further, That if he fear'd any
Rival, <U+017F>he would give him what other A<U+017F><U+017F>urance, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47213:236"/>
Satisfaction he pleas'd, but that of Marriage; which <U+017F>he
could not con<U+017F>ent to, 'till <U+017F>he knew <U+017F>uch an Alliance
would not be fatal to him; for <U+017F>he fear'd as pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he lov'd her, when he <U+017F>hould find <U+017F>he had occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
him the lo<U+017F>s of his Fortune, or his Father's Affection,
he would grow to hate her; tho' he an<U+017F>wer'd to this,
all that a fond Lover could urge, yet <U+017F>he was re<U+017F>olv'd,
and he was forc'd to content him<U+017F>elf with obliging her
by his Prayers and Prote<U+017F>tations, his Sighs, and his
Showers of Tears, to a Contract, which they <U+017F>olemnly
made each other, vowing on either <U+017F>ide, that they would
never marry any other. This being <U+017F>olemnly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd a Look more gay, and contented than
before: He pre<U+017F>ented her a very rich Ring; which <U+017F>he
dur<U+017F>t not put on her Finger, but hid it in her Bo<U+017F>om:
And beholding each other now, as Man and Wife, <U+017F>he
<U+017F>uffer'd him all the decent Freedoms he could wi<U+017F>h to
take; <U+017F>o that the Hours of this Voyage, <U+017F>eem'd the mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>oft and charming of his Life: And doubtle<U+017F>s they were
<U+017F>o; every Touch of <hi>Atlante</hi> tran<U+017F>ported him, every
Look pierced his Soul, and he was all Raptures of Joy,
when he con<U+017F>ider'd this charming lovely Maid was his
own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlot</hi> all this while was gazing above Deck, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Motion of the little Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, and how ea<U+017F>ily the
Wind and Tide bore her up the River. She had never
been in any thing of this kind before, and was very well
plea<U+017F>ed and entertain'd, when <hi>Rinaldo</hi> call'd her down
to eat; where they enjoy'd them<U+017F>elves as well as was
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; and <hi>Charlot</hi> was wondering to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in their Eyes.</p>
                  <p>But now they thought it was high time for them to
return; they fancy the Foot-man mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing them at
Church, would go home, and alarm their Father, and
the Knight of the Ill-favour'd Countenance, as <hi>Charlot</hi>
call'd Count <hi>Vernole;</hi> who<U+017F>e Severity put their Father
on a greater Re<U+017F>triction of them, than naturally he would
do of him<U+017F>elf. At the Name of this Count, <hi>Rinaldo</hi>
chang'd Colour, fearing he might be <U+017F>ome Rival; and
ask'd <hi>Atlante,</hi> if this <hi>Vernole</hi> was a-kin to her? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:236"/>
No: But was a very great Friend to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and on who, from their Infancy, had had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Concern for their Breeding, and was her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
for Philo<U+017F>ophy. <hi>Ah!</hi> replied <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> <U+017F>ighing, <hi>This
Man's Concern must proceed from <U+017F>omething more than
Friend<U+017F>hip for her Father;</hi> and therefore conjured her to
tell him, whether he was not a Lover? <hi>A Lover,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Atlante; I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, he is a perfect Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion;</hi> and tho' <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffered his ugly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence
now, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould loath and hate him, <U+017F>hould he
name but Love to her.</p>
                  <p>She <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he believ'd <U+017F>he need not fear any <U+017F>uch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ecution,
<U+017F>ince he was a Man, who was not at all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous;
that he had too much of the Satyr in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to harbour any <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s there: And Nature had
form'd his Body to his Mind, wholly unfit for Love;
and that he might <U+017F>et his Heart ab<U+017F>olutely at re<U+017F>t: She
a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him her Father had never yet propos'd any Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to her, tho' many advantagious ones are offer'd
him every day.</p>
                  <p>The Sails being turn'd to carry them back from
whence they came; after having di<U+017F>cours'd of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
things, and all of Love and Contrivance, to carry
on their Mutual De<U+017F>ign, they with Sighs parted, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi>
<U+017F>taying behind in the Plea<U+017F>ure-Boat, and they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Shoar in the Wherry, that attended; after which,
he ca<U+017F>t many an amorous and <U+017F>ad Look, and perhaps
was an<U+017F>wer'd by tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Atlante.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was pa<U+017F>t Church time two or three Hours; when
they arriv'd at home, wholly unprepared with an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olutely was <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Soul po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with <U+017F>oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. The fir<U+017F>t Per<U+017F>on they met withal, was
the Footman, who open'd the Door, and began to cry
out, how long he had waited in the Church, and how
in vain; without giving them time to reply. <hi>De Pais</hi>
came towards 'em; and with a frowning Look, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
where they had been? <hi>Atlante,</hi> who was not
accu<U+017F>tomed to Excu<U+017F>es, and Untruth, was a while at a
<U+017F>tand; when <hi>Charlot</hi> with a Voice of Joy cried out;
<hi>Oh, Sir, we have been a Board of a fine little Ship:</hi> At
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:237"/>
this <hi>Atlante</hi> blu<U+017F>h'd, fearing <U+017F>he would tell the Truth.
But <U+017F>he proceeded on, and <U+017F>aid, that they had not
been above a Quarter of an Hour at Church, when
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ady—, with <U+017F>ome other Ladies and Cavaliers,
were going out of the Church, and that <U+017F>pying them,
they wou'd needs have them go with 'em: My Si<U+017F>ter,
Sir, continued <U+017F>he, was very loath to go, for fear you
<U+017F>hould be angry; but my Lady—was <U+017F>o importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
with her on one <U+017F>ide, and I on the other; becau<U+017F>e
I never <U+017F>aw a little Ship in my Life, that at la<U+017F>t we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with her; therefore, good Sir, be not angry. He
promi<U+017F>ed them, he was not: And when they came in,
they found Count <hi>Vernole,</hi> who had been in<U+017F>piring <hi>De
Pais</hi> with Severity, and coun<U+017F>ell'd him to chide the young
Ladies, for being too long ab<U+017F>ent, under pretence of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Devotion. Nor was it enough for him to
<U+017F>et the Father on, but him<U+017F>elf, with a Gravity, where
Concern and Malice were both apparent, reproach'd
<hi>Atlante</hi> with Levity; and told her, He believ'd <U+017F>he had
<U+017F>ome other Motive, than the Invitation of a Lady, to
go on Ship-board; and that <U+017F>he had too many Lovers,
not to make them doubt that this was a de<U+017F>ign'd thing;
and that <U+017F>he had heard Love from <U+017F>ome one, for whom
it was de<U+017F>ign'd. To this <U+017F>he made him but a <U+017F>hort Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
That if it was <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he had no Rea<U+017F>on to conceal it,
<U+017F>ince <U+017F>he had Sence enough to look after her<U+017F>elf; and if
any Body had made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ove to her, he might be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd,
it was <U+017F>ome one, who<U+017F>e Quality and Merit de<U+017F>erv'd to
be heard: And with a Look of Scorn, <U+017F>he pa<U+017F>t on to
another Room, and left him <U+017F>ilently raging within with
Jealou<U+017F>ie: Which, if before <U+017F>he tormented him, this
Declaration increas'd it to a Pitch not to be conceal'd.
And this Day he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o much to the Father, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd
forthwith to <U+017F>end <hi>Charlot</hi> to a Nunnery: And
accordingly, the next Day, he bid her prepare to go.
<hi>Charlot,</hi> who was not yet arrived to the Years of Di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
did not much regret it; and having no Trouble,
but leaving her Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>he prepared to go to a Nunnery,
not many Streets from that where <U+017F>he dwelt. The Lady
Abbe<U+017F>s was her Father's Kin<U+017F>woman, and had treated
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47213:237"/>
her very well, as often as <U+017F>he came to vi<U+017F>it her; <U+017F>o that
with Satisfaction enough, <U+017F>he was condemned to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<U+017F>tick
Life, and was now going for her Probation-Year.
<hi>Atlante</hi> was troubled at her Departure, becau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>he had no Body to bring, and to carry Letters between
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> and <U+017F>he: However <U+017F>he took her leave of her,
and promis'd to come and <U+017F>ee her, as often as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
be permitted to go abroad; for <U+017F>he fear'd now <U+017F>ome
Con<U+017F>traint extraordinary would be put upon her; and
<U+017F>o it happen'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Chamber was that to which the Balcony
belong'd, and though <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not appear there in the
Day-time, <U+017F>he could in the Night, and that way give
her Lover as many Hours of Conver<U+017F>ation, as <U+017F>he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed,
without being perceived: But how to give <hi>Rinaldo</hi>
notice of this, <U+017F>he could not tell, who not knowing
<hi>Charlot</hi> was gone to a Mona<U+017F>tery, waited many Days
at his Window to <U+017F>ee her; at la<U+017F>t they neither of them
knowing who to tru<U+017F>t with any Me<U+017F><U+017F>age, one Day
when he was, as u<U+017F>ual, upon his watch, he <U+017F>aw <hi>Atlante</hi>
<U+017F>tep into the Balcony, who having a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etter, in which
<U+017F>he had put a Piece of Lead, <U+017F>he to<U+017F>t it into his Window,
who<U+017F>e Ca<U+017F>ement was open, and run in again unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by any but him<U+017F>elf, the Paper contain'd only
this:</p>
                  <p>My Chamber is that which looks into the Balcony, from
whence, tho' I cannot conver<U+017F>e with you in the Day, I can
at Night, when I am retired to go to Bed; therefore be at
your Window. <hi>Farewel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There needed no more to make him a diligent Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and accordingly <U+017F>he was no <U+017F>ooner retired to her
Chamber, but <U+017F>he would come into the Balcony, where
<U+017F>he fail'd not to <U+017F>ee him attending at his Window. This
happy Contrivance was thus carry'd on for many
Nights, where they entertain'd one another, with all
the Indearment that two Hearts could dictate, who
were perfectly united and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of each other, and
this plea<U+017F>ing Conver<U+017F>ation would often la<U+017F>t till Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and forced them to part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:47213:238"/>
But old <hi>Belyuard</hi> perceiving his Son frequent that
Chamber more than u<U+017F>ual, fancy'd <U+017F>omething extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
mu<U+017F>t be the Cau<U+017F>e of it; and one Night asking
for his Son, his Vallet told him, he was gone into the great
Chamber; <U+017F>o this was called: <hi>Belyuard</hi> asked the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
what he did there; he told him, he could not tell;
for often he had lighted him thither; and, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
would take the Candle from him, at the Chamber
Door, and <U+017F>uffer him to go no further: Tho' the old
Gentleman could not imagine, what Affairs he could
have alone every Night in that Chamber, he had a
Curio<U+017F>ity to <U+017F>ee; and one unlucky Night, putting off
his Shooes, he came to the Door of the Chamber,
which was open, he entered <U+017F>oftly, and <U+017F>aw the Candle
<U+017F>et in the Chimney, and his Son at a great open Bay
Window; he <U+017F>topt a while to wait when he would
turn, but finding him immovable, he advanced <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
further, and at la<U+017F>t heard the <U+017F>oft Dialogue of
Love, between him and <hi>Atlante;</hi> whom he knew to
be <U+017F>he, by his often calling her by her Name in their
Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: He heard enough to confirm him how Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
went; and un<U+017F>een as he came, he returned, full
of Indignation, and thought how to prevent <U+017F>o great
an Evil, as this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of his Son might produce; at
fir<U+017F>t he thought to round him <U+017F>everely in the Ear about
it, and upbraid him for doing the only thing he had
thought fit to forbid him; but then he thought that
would but terrifie him for a while, and he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again, where he had <U+017F>o great an Inclination, if he
were near her: He therefore re<U+017F>olves to <U+017F>end him to
<hi>Paris,</hi> that by ab<U+017F>ence he might forget the young Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that had charmed his Youth: Therefore, without
letting <hi>Rinaldo</hi> know the Rea<U+017F>on, and without taking
notice that he knew any thing of his Amour, he came
to him one Day, and told him all the Ma<U+017F>ters he had
for the improving him in noble Sciences were very dull,
or very remi<U+017F>s; and that he re<U+017F>olved he <U+017F>hould go for a
Year or two, to the Academy at <hi>Paris.</hi> To this, the
Son made a thou<U+017F>and Eva<U+017F>ions; but the Father was
po<U+017F>itive, and not to be per<U+017F>waded by all his Rea<U+017F>ons;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47213:238"/>
and finding he <U+017F>hould ab<U+017F>olutely di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e him, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ed
to go, and not daring to tell him the dear Cau<U+017F>e
of his De<U+017F>ire to remain at <hi>Orleance.</hi> He therefore,
with a breaking Heart, con<U+017F>ents to go, nay, re<U+017F>olves it,
though it <U+017F>hould be his Death: But, alas! he con<U+017F>iders,
that this parting will not only prove the greate<U+017F>t Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Earth to him, but that <hi>Atlante</hi> will <U+017F>hare
in his Misfortunes al<U+017F>o: This Thought gives him a
double Torment, and yet finds no way to evade it.</p>
                  <p>The Night that fini<U+017F>hed this fatal Day, he goes again
to his wonted Station, the Window; where he had
not <U+017F>ig'hd very long, but he <U+017F>aw <hi>Atlante</hi> enter the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony:
He was not able a great while to <U+017F>peak to her,
or to utter one Word. The Night was light enough
to <U+017F>ee him at the wonted place; and <U+017F>he admires at his
Silence, and demands the Rea<U+017F>on in <U+017F>uch obliging
Terms, as adds to his Grief; and he, with a deep
Sigh, replied, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rge me not, my fair</hi> Atlante, <hi>to <U+017F>peak
lest by obeying you, I give you more cau<U+017F>e of Grief, than
my Silence is capable of doing:</hi> And then <U+017F>ighing again,
he held his Peace, and gave her leave to ask the Cau<U+017F>e
of the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t Words. But when he made no Reply,
but by <U+017F>ighing, <U+017F>he imagin'd it much wor<U+017F>e, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was; and with a trembling and fainting Voice,
<U+017F>he cried, <hi>Oh!</hi> Rinaldo, <hi>give me leave to divine that
cruel News you are <U+017F>o unwilling to tell me: It is <U+017F>o,</hi> added
<U+017F>he, <hi>you are de<U+017F>tined to <U+017F>ome more fortunate Maid than</hi>
Atlante: At this, Tears <U+017F>topp'd her Speech, and <U+017F>he
could utter no more. <hi>No, my dearest Charmer,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> (elevating his Voice) <hi>if that were all, you
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee with what Fortitude I would die, rather than
obey any <U+017F>uch Commands: I am vowed yours to the last
Moment of my Life; and will be yours in <U+017F>pight of all the
Oppo<U+017F>ition in the World; that Cruelty I could evade, but
cannot this that threatens me. Ah!</hi> cried <hi>Atlante, let
Fate do her wor<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he <U+017F>till continue</hi> Rinaldo <hi>mine, and
keep that Faith he hath <U+017F>worn to me entire: What can <U+017F>he
do be<U+017F>ide that can afflict me? She can <U+017F>eparate me,</hi> cried
he, <hi>for <U+017F>ome time from</hi> Atlante. <hi>Oh!</hi> replied <U+017F>he, <hi>all
Misfortunes fall <U+017F>o below that which I first imagined, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47213:239"/>
methinks I do not re<U+017F>ent this, as I <U+017F>hould otherwi<U+017F>e have
done; but I know, when I have a little more con<U+017F>idered it,
I <U+017F>hall even die with the Grief of it. Ab<U+017F>ence being <U+017F>o
great an Enemy to Love, and makes us <U+017F>oon forget the
Object beloved: This, though I never experienced, I have
heard, and fear it may be my Fate.</hi> He then convinced
her Fear with a thou<U+017F>and new Vows, and a thou<U+017F>and
Imprecations of Con<U+017F>tancy. She then asked him, <hi>If
their Loves were di<U+017F>covered, that he was with <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te to
depart?</hi> He told her, <hi>Nothing of that was the Cau<U+017F>e; and
he could almost wi<U+017F>h it were di<U+017F>covered, <U+017F>ince he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olutely
then refu<U+017F>e to go: But it was only to cultivate his
Mind, more effectually than he could do here; 'twas the
Care of his Father to accompli<U+017F>h him the more; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could not contradict it. But,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>I am not
<U+017F>ent where Seas <U+017F>hall part us, nor vast di<U+017F>tances of Earth,
but to</hi> Paris; <hi>from whence he might come in two Days to
<U+017F>ee her again, and that he would expect from that Balco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that had gave him <U+017F>o many happy Moments, many
more when he <U+017F>hould come to <U+017F>ee her.</hi> He be<U+017F>ought her to
<U+017F>end him away with all the Satisfaction <U+017F>he could,
which <U+017F>he could no otherwi<U+017F>e do, than by giving him
new A<U+017F><U+017F>urances, that <U+017F>he would never give away that
Right he had in her, to any other Lover: She vows
this with innumerable Tears; and is almo<U+017F>t angry with
him for que<U+017F>tioning her Faith. He tells her then he has
but one Night more to <U+017F>tay, and his Grief would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>peakable,
if he <U+017F>hould not be able to take a better
Leave of her, than at a Window; and that, if <U+017F>he
would give him leave, he would by a Rope or two
tied together, <U+017F>o as it may <U+017F>erve for Steps, a<U+017F>cend her
Balcony; he not having time to provide a Ladder of
Ropes. She tells him, <U+017F>he has <U+017F>o great a Confidence in
his Vertue and Love, that <U+017F>he will refu<U+017F>e him nothing,
though it would be a very bold venture for a Maid, to
tru<U+017F>t her<U+017F>elf with a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate young Man, in <U+017F>ilence of
Night; and though <U+017F>he did not exert a Vow from him
to <U+017F>ecure her, <U+017F>he expected he would have a Care of
her Honour. He <U+017F>wore to her, his Love was too Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
for <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>e an Attempt. There needed not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:239"/>
Vows to confirm her Faith; and it was agreed on
between them<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that he <U+017F>hould come the next Night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Chamber.</p>
                  <p>It happened that Night, as it often did, that Count
<hi>Vernole,</hi> lay with Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De Pays,</hi> which was in a
Ground-Room, ju<U+017F>t under that of <hi>Atlante</hi>'s: And as
<U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he knew all were in Bed, <U+017F>he gave the Word
to <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> who was attending with the Impatience of
a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Lover below, under the Window; and,
who <U+017F>ooner heard the Balcony open, but he a<U+017F>cended
with <U+017F>ome difficulty, and entered the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mber, where
he found <hi>Atlante</hi> tremble with Joy and Fear: He
throws him<U+017F>elf at her Feet, as unable to <U+017F>peak as <U+017F>he;
who nothing but blu<U+017F>hed and bent down her Eyes,
hardly daring to glance them towards the dear Object
of her De<U+017F>ires, the Lord of all her Vows: She was
was a<U+017F>hamed to <U+017F>ee a Man in her Chamber, where yet
none had ever been alone, and by Night too. He <U+017F>aw
her Fear, and felt her Trembling; and after a thou<U+017F>and
Sighs of Love had made way for Speech, he be<U+017F>ought
her to fear nothing from him; for his Flame was too
<U+017F>acred, and his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion too holy to offer any thing, but
what Honour with Love might afford him. At la<U+017F>t he
brought her to <U+017F>ome Courage, and the Ro<U+017F>es of her fair
Cheeks a<U+017F><U+017F>umed their wonted Colour, not blu<U+017F>hing too
Red, nor langui<U+017F>hing too Pale. But when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ation
began between them, it was the <U+017F>ofte<U+017F>t
in the World: They <U+017F>aid all that parting Lovers
could <U+017F>ay, all that Wit and Tenderne<U+017F>s could expre<U+017F>s:
They exchanged their Vows a-new, and to confirm his,
he tied a Bracelet of Diamonds about her Arm; and
<U+017F>he returned him one of her Hair, which he had long
begged, and <U+017F>he had on purpo<U+017F>e made, which cla<U+017F>ped
together with Diamonds; this <U+017F>he put about his Arm,
and he <U+017F>wore to carry it to his Grave. The Night was
very far <U+017F>pent in tender Vows, <U+017F>oft Sighs and Tears on
both <U+017F>ides; and it was high time to part: But as if
Death had been to have arrived to them in that Minute,
they both linger'd away the time, like Lovers who had
forgot them<U+017F>elves; and Day was near approaching,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:240"/>
when he bid farewel; which he repeated very often,
for <U+017F>till he was interrupted by <U+017F>ome commanding Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
from <hi>Atlante,</hi> and then lo<U+017F>t all his Power of going;
till <U+017F>he, more couragious and careful of his Intere<U+017F>t,
and her own Fame, forc'd him from her; and it was
happy <U+017F>he did <U+017F>o; for he was no <U+017F>ooner got over the
Balcony, and <U+017F>he had flung him down his Rope, and
<U+017F>hut the Door, but <hi>Vernole,</hi> whom Love and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
kept waking, fancied <U+017F>everal times he heard a
Noi<U+017F>e in <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Chamber. And whether in pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing
over the Balcony, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> made any noi<U+017F>e or not, or
whether it were <U+017F>till his jealous Fancy, he came up in
his Night-Gown, with a Pi<U+017F>tol in his Hand. <hi>Atlante</hi>
was not <U+017F>o much lo<U+017F>t in Grief, though <U+017F>he were all in
Tears, but <U+017F>he heard a Man come up, and imagined it
had been her Father, <U+017F>he not knowing of Count <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>'s
lying in the Hou<U+017F>e that Night; if <U+017F>he had, <U+017F>he
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly had taken more care to have been <U+017F>ilent: But
whoever it was, <U+017F>he could not get to Bed <U+017F>oon enough;
and therefore turn'd her<U+017F>elf to her Dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing-table, where
Candle <U+017F>tood, and where lay a Book open of the Story
of <hi>Ariadne</hi> and <hi>The<U+017F>ias.</hi> The Count turning the Latch,
entred halting into her Chamber, in his Night-Gown
clapped clo<U+017F>e about him, which betrayed an ill-favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Shape, his Night-Cap on, without a Perriwig, which
di<U+017F>covered all his lean withered Jaws, his pale Face, and
his Eyes <U+017F>taring; and making altogether <U+017F>o dreadful a
Figure, that <hi>Atlante,</hi> who no more dreamt of him than
of a Devil, had po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly have rather <U+017F>een the la<U+017F>t. She
gave a great Shriek, which frighted <hi>Vernole;</hi> <U+017F>o both
<U+017F>tood for a while <U+017F>taring on each other, till both were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected:
He told her, the Care of her Honour had
brought him thither; and then rolling his <U+017F>mall Eyes
round the Chamber, to <U+017F>ee if he could di<U+017F>cover any
Body; he proceed and cried, <hi>Madam, if I had no other
Motive than your being up at this time of Night, or rather
of Day, I could ea<U+017F>ily gue<U+017F>s how you have been entertained.
What In<U+017F>olence is this,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, all in a Rage, <hi>when to
cover your Boldne<U+017F>s of approaching my Chamber at this
Hour, you would que<U+017F>tion how I have been entertained;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47213:240"/>
either explain your<U+017F>elf, or quit my Chamber; for I do not
u<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch terrible Objects here. Po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly tho<U+017F>e you do
<U+017F>ee,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Count, <hi>are indeed more agreeable, but I am
afraid have not that regard to your Honour as I have.</hi> And
at that Word he <U+017F>tepped to the Balcony, opened it,
and looked out, but <U+017F>eeing no Body, he <U+017F>hut it too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
This enraged <hi>Atlante</hi> beyond all Patience; and
<U+017F>natching the Pi<U+017F>tol out of his Hand, <U+017F>he told him, <hi>He
de<U+017F>erved to have it aimed at his Head, for having the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to que<U+017F>tion her Honour, or her Conduct; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

him to avoid her Chamber as he loved his Life;</hi>
which <U+017F>he believed he was fonder of than of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
She <U+017F>peaking this in a Tone wholly tran<U+017F>ported
with Rage; and at the <U+017F>ame time holding the Pi<U+017F>tol to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, made him tremble with Fear; and he now
found whether <U+017F>he were guilty or not, it was his turn
to beg pardon: For you mu<U+017F>t know, however it came
to pa<U+017F>s, that his Jealou<U+017F>ie made him come up in that
force Po<U+017F>ture; at other times <hi>Vernole</hi> was the mo<U+017F>t
tame and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive Man in the World, and one who was
afraid of his own Shadow in the Night: He had a
natural Aver<U+017F>ion for Danger, and thought it below a
Man of Wit, or common Sen<U+017F>e, to be guilty of that
brutal Thing, called Courage or Fighting: His Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophy
told him, <hi>It was <U+017F>afe <U+017F>leeping in a whole Skin;</hi>
and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he apprehended as much Danger from this
<hi>Virago,</hi> as ever he did from his own Sex; he therefore
fell on his Knees, and be<U+017F>ought her to hold her fair
Hand; and not to <U+017F>uffer that, which was the greate<U+017F>t
Mark of his Re<U+017F>pect, to be the Cau<U+017F>e of her Hate or
Indignation. The pitiful Faces he made, and the Signs
of mortal Fear in him, had almo<U+017F>t made her laugh, at
lea<U+017F>t it allayed her Anger; and <U+017F>he bid him ri<U+017F>e and
play the Fool hereafter <U+017F>ome-where-el<U+017F>e, and not in her
Pre<U+017F>ence: Yet for once, <U+017F>he would deign to give him
this Satisfaction; that <U+017F>he was got into a Book, which
had many moving Stories very well writ; and that
<U+017F>he found her<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o well entertained, <U+017F>he had forgot
how the Night pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed. He mo<U+017F>t humbly thanked her
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47213:241"/>
for this Satisfaction, and retired, perhaps not <U+017F>o well
<U+017F>atisfied as he pretended.</p>
                  <p>After this, he appeared more <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ive and re<U+017F>pect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
towards <hi>Atlante;</hi> and <U+017F>he carried her<U+017F>elf more re<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and haughty towards him; which was one Rea<U+017F>on,

Thoughts: That <hi>Vernole,</hi> wholly unable longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, re<U+017F>olved to make a Publication of it,
fir<U+017F>t to the Father, and then to the lovely Daughter,
of whom he had <U+017F>ome hope, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had carried
her<U+017F>elf very well towards him for this Year pa<U+017F>t;
which <U+017F>he would never have done, if <U+017F>he had imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
he would ever have been her Lover: She had <U+017F>een
no Signs of any <U+017F>uch Misfortune towards her in the<U+017F>e
many Years he had conver<U+017F>ed with her, and <U+017F>he had
to cau<U+017F>e to fear him. When one Day her Father ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her into the Garden, told her what Honour and
Happine<U+017F>s was in <U+017F>tore for her; and that now the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his fallen Family would ri<U+017F>e again, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he had
a Lover of an illu<U+017F>trious Blood, allied to Monarchs;
and one who<U+017F>e Fortune was newly encreas'd to a very
con<U+017F>iderable Degree, an<U+017F>werable to his Birth. She
changed Colour at this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, imagining but too
well, who this illu<U+017F>trious Lover was: When <hi>De Pais</hi>
proceeded, and told her, <hi>Indeed his Per<U+017F>on was not the
most agreeable that ever was <U+017F>een; but he married her to
Glory and Fortune, not the Man: And a Woman,</hi> <U+017F>ays he,
<hi>ought to look no farther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She needed not any more to inform her, who this
intended Husband was; and, therefore bur<U+017F>ting forth
into Tears, <U+017F>he throws her<U+017F>elf at his Feet, imploring
him not to u<U+017F>e the Authority of a Father, to force her
to a thing <U+017F>o contrary to her Inclinations; a<U+017F><U+017F>uring, <U+017F>he
could not con<U+017F>ent to any <U+017F>uch thing; and that <U+017F>he
would rather die than yield: She urged many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for this her Di<U+017F>obedience. But none would pa<U+017F>s
for current with the old Gentleman, who<U+017F>e Pride had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47213:242"/>
<U+017F>lattered him with hopes of <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable a Son-in-Law:
He was very much <U+017F>urprized at <hi>Atlante</hi>'s refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
what he believed <U+017F>he would receive with Joy;
and finding that no Arguments on his <U+017F>ide could draw
hers to an obedient Con<U+017F>ent, he grew to <U+017F>uch a Rage,
as very rarely po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t him; vowing, if <U+017F>he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
her Will to his, he would abandon her to all the
Cruelty of Contempt and Poverty; <U+017F>o that at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he
was forced to return him this An<U+017F>wer, <hi>That <U+017F>he would
<U+017F>trive all <U+017F>he could with her Heart; but <U+017F>he verily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould never bring it to con<U+017F>ent to a Marriage
with Mon<U+017F>ieur the Count.</hi> The Father continued threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her, and gave her <U+017F>ome Days to con<U+017F>ider of it:
So leaving her in Tears, he returned to his Chamber,
to con<U+017F>ider what An<U+017F>wer he <U+017F>hould give Count <hi>Vernole,</hi>
whom he knew would be impatient to learn what Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s
he had, and what him<U+017F>elf was to hope: <hi>De Pais,</hi>
after <U+017F>ome Con<U+017F>ideration, re<U+017F>olved to tell him, <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Offer very well; but, that he mu<U+017F>t expect
a little Maiden Nicety in the Ca<U+017F>e; and accordingly
did tell him <U+017F>o; and he was not at all doubtful of his
good Fortune.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Atlante,</hi> who re<U+017F>olved to die a thou<U+017F>and Deaths
rather than break her <U+017F>olemn Vows to <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> or to
marry the Count, ca<U+017F>t about how <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould avoid it
with the lea<U+017F>t Hazard of her Father's Rage. She found
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> the better and more advantageous Match of the
two, could they but get his Father's Con<U+017F>ent: He was
beautiful and young; his Title was equal to that of
<hi>Vernole,</hi> when his Father <U+017F>hould die; and his E<U+017F>tate
exceeded his; yet <U+017F>he dares not make a Di<U+017F>covery, for
fear <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould injure her Lover; who at this time,
though <U+017F>he knew it not, lay <U+017F>ick of a Fever, while <U+017F>he
was wondering that he came not as he u<U+017F>ed to do:
However, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olves to <U+017F>end him a Letter, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the Misfortune; which <U+017F>he did in
the<U+017F>e Terms:</p>

This Letter <hi>Rinaldo</hi> received; and there needed no
more to make him <U+017F>ly to <hi>Orleance:</hi> This rai<U+017F>ed him
<U+017F>oon from his Bed of Sickne<U+017F>s, and getting immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to hers, he arrived at his Father's Hou<U+017F>e; who did
not <U+017F>o much admire to <U+017F>ee him, becau<U+017F>e he heard he
was <U+017F>ick of a Fever, and gave him leave to return, if
he pleas'd: He went directly to his Father's Hou<U+017F>e,
becau<U+017F>e he knew <U+017F>omewhat of the Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; he was
re<U+017F>olv'd to make his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion known, as <U+017F>oon as he had
<U+017F>een <hi>Atlante;</hi> from whom he was to take all his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures:
He therefore fail'd not, when all were in Bed,
to ri<U+017F>e and go from his Chamber, into the Street;
where finding a Light in <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Chamber, for <U+017F>he
every Night expected him, he made the u<U+017F>ual Sign,
and <U+017F>he went into the Balcony; and he having no
Conveniency of mounting up into it, they di<U+017F>cours'd,
and <U+017F>aid all they had to <U+017F>ay: From thence, <U+017F>he tells
him of the Count's Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, of her Father's Re<U+017F>olution,
and her own, which was rather to die his than live
any body's el<U+017F>e: And at la<U+017F>t, as their la<U+017F>t Refuge, they
re<U+017F>olv'd to di<U+017F>cover the whole Matter; <U+017F>he to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and he to his, to <U+017F>ee what Accommodation they
could make; if not, to die together. They parted at
this Re<U+017F>olve, for <U+017F>he would permit him no longer to <U+017F>tay
the Street, after <U+017F>uch a Sickne<U+017F>s; <U+017F>o he went home to
Bed, but not to <U+017F>leep.</p>
                  <p>The next Day, at Dinner, <hi>Mon<U+017F>igniore Bellyuard</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
his Son ab<U+017F>olutely cur'd by Ab<U+017F>ence of his Pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion;
and <U+017F>peaking of all the News of the Town; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the re<U+017F>t, told him, he was come in good time to
Dance at the Wedding of Count <hi>Vernole</hi> with <hi>Atlante,</hi>
the Match being agreed on: <hi>No, Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Rinaldo,
I <U+017F>hall never Dance at the Marriage of Count</hi> Vernole
<hi>with</hi> Atlante; <hi>and you will <U+017F>ee in Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> De Pais'<hi>s Hou<U+017F>e
a Funeral <U+017F>ooner than a Wedding:</hi> And thereupon, he
told his Father all his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, for that lovely Maid;
and a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd him, if he would not <U+017F>ee him laid in his
Grave, he mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ent to this Match: <hi>Bellyuard</hi> ro<U+017F>e
in a Fury, and told him, <hi>He had rather <U+017F>ee him in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47213:243"/>
Grave, than in the Arms of</hi> Atlante: <hi>Not,</hi> continued he,
<hi><U+017F>o much for any di<U+017F>like I have to the young Lady, or the
Smallne<U+017F>s of her Fortune; but, becau<U+017F>e I have <U+017F>o long warn'd
you from <U+017F>uch a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and have with <U+017F>uch Care endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by your Ab<U+017F>ence to prevent it.</hi> He traver<U+017F>s'd the
Room very fa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>till prote<U+017F>ting again<U+017F>t this Alliance;
and was deaf to all <hi>Rinaldo</hi> could <U+017F>ay: On the other
<U+017F>ide, the Day being come, wherein <hi>Atlante</hi> was to
give her final An<U+017F>wer to her Father, concerning her
Marriage with Count <hi>Vernole:</hi> She a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd all the
Courage and Re<U+017F>olution <U+017F>he could to with<U+017F>tand the
Storm, that threaten'd a Denial. And her Father came
to her, and demanding her An<U+017F>wer; <U+017F>he told him, <hi>She
could not be the Wife of</hi> Vernole, <hi><U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was Wife to</hi>
Rinaldo, <hi>only Son to</hi> Bellyuard. If her Father <U+017F>torm'd
before, he grew like a Man di<U+017F>tracted at her Confe<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and <hi>Vernole</hi> hearing them loud, ran to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to learn the Cau<U+017F>e; where, ju<U+017F>t as he entered, he
found <hi>De Pais</hi>'s Sword drawn, and ready to kill his
Daughter, who lay all in Tears at his Feet, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
his Hand; and asking the Cau<U+017F>e of this Rage, he
was told all that <hi>Atlante</hi> had confe<U+017F>s'd; which put
<hi>Vernole</hi> quite be<U+017F>ide all his Gravity, and made him
di<U+017F>cover the Infirmity of Anger; which he us'd to <U+017F>ay,
ought to be di<U+017F><U+017F>embled by all wi<U+017F>e Men: So that <hi>De
Pais</hi> forgot his own to appea<U+017F>e his; but 'twas in vain,
for he went out of the Hou<U+017F>e, vowing Revenge on <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo:</hi>
And to that end, being not very well a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of
his own Courage, as I <U+017F>aid before, and being of the
Opinion, that no Man ought to expo<U+017F>e his Life to him,
who has injur'd him: He hir'd <hi>Swi<U+017F>s</hi> and <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to attend him in the Nature of Footmen; and
watch'd <U+017F>everal Nights about <hi>Bellyuard</hi>'s Door: And
that of <hi>De Pais,</hi> believing he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ometime or other
<U+017F>ee him under the Window of <hi>Atlante,</hi> or perhaps
mounting in it; for now he no longer doubted, but
this happy Lover was he, whom he fancy'd he heard
go from the Balcony that Night, he came up with his
Pi<U+017F>tol; and being more a <hi>Spaniard</hi> than a <hi>French</hi> Man
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47213:244"/>
in his Nature, he re<U+017F>olv'd to take him any way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded
or unarmed, if he came in his way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atlante,</hi> who heard his Threatnings, when he went
from her in a Rage, fear'd his Cowardize might put
him on <U+017F>ome ba<U+017F>e Action, to deprive <hi>Rinaldo</hi> of his
Life; and therefore thought it not <U+017F>afe to <U+017F>uffer him
to come to her by Night, as he had before done; but
<U+017F>ent him word in a Note, that he <U+017F>hould forbear her
Window, for <hi>Vernole</hi> had <U+017F>worn his Death: This Note
came un<U+017F>een by his Father to his Hands; but this could
not hinder him from coming to her Window, which
he did as <U+017F>oon as it was dark, he came thither, only
attended with his Vallet and two Footmen; for now
he cared not who knew the Secret: He had no <U+017F>ooner
made the Sign, but he found him<U+017F>elf incompa<U+017F>s'd with
<hi>Vernole</hi>'s Bravoes; and him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>tanding at a di<U+017F>tance,
cry'd out, <hi>That he is:</hi> With that, they all drew on both
<U+017F>ides, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> receiv'd a Wound in the Arm. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante</hi>
heard this, and ran crying out, <hi>That</hi> Rinaldo,
pre<U+017F>t by Numbers, <hi>would be kill'd. De Pais,</hi> who was
reading in his Clo<U+017F>et, took his Sword, and ran out;
and contrary to all expectation, <U+017F>eeing <hi>Rinaldo</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his back to the Door, pull'd him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> into the
Hou<U+017F>e, and fought him<U+017F>elf with the Bravoes. Who
being very much wounded by <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> gave ground
and <U+017F>heer'd off; and <hi>De Pais</hi> putting up old <hi>Billo</hi> into
the Scabbard, went into his Hou<U+017F>e, where he found
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> almo<U+017F>t fainting with lo<U+017F>s of Blood, and <hi>Atlante</hi>
with her Maids binding up his Wound; to whom <hi>De
Pais</hi> <U+017F>aid, <hi>This Charity</hi> Atlante <hi>very well becomes you, and
is what I can allow you; and I could wi<U+017F>h you had no other
Motive for this Action. Rinaldo</hi> by degrees recovered
of his Fainting, and as well as his Weakne<U+017F>s would
permit him, he got up and made a low Reverence to
<hi>De Pais;</hi> telling him, <hi>He had now a double Obligation
to pay him all the Re<U+017F>pect in the World; first, for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Father of</hi> Atlante; <hi>and <U+017F>econdly, for being the
Pre<U+017F>erver of his Life; two Tyes that <U+017F>hould eternally oblige
him to Love and Honour him, as his own Parent:</hi> De Pais
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47213:244"/>
reply'd, <hi>He had done nothing but what common Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
compelled him to: But if he would make good that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect
he profe<U+017F>s'd towards him, it must be in quitting all
Hopes of</hi> Atlante, <hi>whom he had de<U+017F>tin'd to another, or to
an eternal Inclo<U+017F>ure in a Mona<U+017F>tery: He had another
Daughter, whom if he would think worthy of his regard,
he <U+017F>hould take his Alliance as a very great Honour; but
his Word and Reputation, nay, his Vows were past, to give</hi>
Atlante <hi>to Count</hi> Vernole. <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> who before he <U+017F>poke,
took mea<U+017F>ure from <hi>Atlante</hi>'s Eyes; which told him,
her Heart was his; return'd this An<U+017F>wer to <hi>De Pais:
That he was infinitely glad to find by the Genero<U+017F>ity of his
Offer, that he had no Aver<U+017F>ion to his being his Son-in-Law;
and that next to</hi> Atlante, <hi>the greatest Happine<U+017F>s he
could wi<U+017F>h would be, his receiving</hi> Charlot <hi>from his Hands,
but that he could not think of quitting</hi> Atlante, <hi>how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
<U+017F>oever it would be for Glory, and his—(the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
Repo<U+017F>e. De Pais</hi> would not let him at this time,
argue the Matter further, <U+017F>eeing he was ill, and had
need of looking after; he therefore begg'd he would
for his Health's <U+017F>ake retire to his own Hou<U+017F>e, whither
he him<U+017F>elf conducted him; and left him to the Care of
his Men, who were e<U+017F>cap'd the Fray; and return'd to
his own Chamber, he found <hi>Atlante</hi> retir'd, and <U+017F>o he
went to Bed full of Thoughts; this Night had increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
his E<U+017F>teem for <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> and le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd it for Count
<hi>Vernole;</hi> but his Word and Honour being pa<U+017F>t, he
could not break it, neither with Safety nor Honour;
for he knew the haughty re<U+017F>enting Nature of the Count,
and he fear'd <U+017F>ome Danger might arrive to the brave
<hi>Rinaldo,</hi> which troubled him very much: At la<U+017F>t he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd,
that neither might take any thing ill at his
Hands, to loo<U+017F>e <hi>Atlante,</hi> and <U+017F>end her to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tery,
where her Si<U+017F>ter was, and compel her to be a
Nun. This he thought would prevent Mi<U+017F>chiefs on
both <U+017F>ides; and accordingly, the next day (having in
the Morning <U+017F>ent word to the Lady <hi>Abbe<U+017F>s</hi> what he
would have done; he carries <hi>Atlante</hi> under pretence
of vi<U+017F>iting her Si<U+017F>ter, which they often did) to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<U+017F>tery,

where <U+017F>he was no <U+017F>ooner come, but <U+017F>he was

her than <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be the Cau<U+017F>e of the

all over the bu<U+017F>ie Town, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> was not the la<U+017F>t
to whom the News arriv'd: He was for a few Days
confin'd to his Chamber; where, when alone, he rav'd
like a Man di<U+017F>tracted. But his Wounds had <U+017F>o incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
his Father again<U+017F>t <hi>Atlante,</hi> that he <U+017F>wore he would
<U+017F>ee his Son die of them, rather than <U+017F>uffer him to marry
<hi>Atlante;</hi> and was extreamly over-joyed, to find <U+017F>he was
condemned for ever to the Mona<U+017F>tery; <U+017F>o that the Son
thought it the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Cour<U+017F>e, and the mo<U+017F>t for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his Love, to <U+017F>ay nothing to contradict his
Father; but being almo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <hi>Atlante</hi> would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
con<U+017F>ent to be <U+017F>hut up in a Cloy<U+017F>ter, and abandon
him, he flatter'd him<U+017F>elf with hope, that he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>teal
her from thence, and marry her in <U+017F>pight of all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition.
This he was impatient to put in Practice: He
believed, if he were not permitted to <U+017F>ee <hi>Atlante,</hi> he
had <U+017F>till a kind Advocate in <hi>Charlot,</hi> who was now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to her Thirteenth Year, and infinitely advanc'd in
Wit and Beauty. <hi>Rinaldo</hi> therefore often goes to the
Mona<U+017F>tery, <U+017F>urrounding it, to <U+017F>ee what po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility there
was of accompli<U+017F>hing his De<U+017F>ign; if he could get her
Con<U+017F>ent, he finds it not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and goes to vi<U+017F>it
<hi>Charlot;</hi> who had Command not to <U+017F>ee him, or <U+017F>peak
to him. This was a Cruelty he look'd not for, and
which gave him an un<U+017F>peakable Trouble, and without
her Aid it was wholly impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to give <hi>Atlante</hi> any
Account of his De<U+017F>ign. In this Perplexity he remain'd
many Days, in which he langui<U+017F>h'd almo<U+017F>t to Death;
he was di<U+017F>tracted with Thought, and continually ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
about the Nunnery-Walls, in hope, at <U+017F>ome
time or other, to <U+017F>ee or hear from the lovely Maid,
who alone could make his Happine<U+017F>s. In the<U+017F>e Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>es
he often met <hi>Vernole,</hi> who had liberty to <U+017F>ee her
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47213:245"/>
when he pleas'd: If it happen'd that they chanc'd to
meet in the Day-time, tho' <hi>Vernole</hi> were attended with
an Equipage of Ruffians, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> but only with a
couple of Footmen, he could perceive <hi>Vernole</hi> <U+017F>hun him,
grow pale, and almo<U+017F>t tremble with Fear <U+017F>ometimes,
and get to the other <U+017F>ide of the Street; and if he did
not, <hi>Rinaldo</hi> having a mortal hate to him, would often
bear up clo<U+017F>e to him, that he would jo<U+017F>tle him again<U+017F>t
the Wall; which <hi>Vernole</hi> would patiently put up, and
pa<U+017F>s on; <U+017F>o that he could never be provok'd to fight by
Day-light, how <U+017F>olitary <U+017F>oever the place was where they
met: but if they chanc'd to meet at Night, they were
certain of a Skirmi<U+017F>h, in which he would have no part
him<U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o that <hi>Rinaldo</hi> was often like to be a<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but <U+017F>till came off with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>light Wound. This
continued <U+017F>o long, and made <U+017F>o great a Noi<U+017F>e in the
Town, that the two Old Gentlemen were mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
by it; and Count <hi>Bellyuard</hi> came to <hi>De Pays,</hi>
one Day, to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with him of this Affair; and
<hi>Bellyuard,</hi> for the Pre<U+017F>ervation of his Son, as almo<U+017F>t
con<U+017F>enting, <U+017F>ince there was no Remedy, that he <U+017F>hould
marry <hi>Atlante. De Pays</hi> confe<U+017F>s'd the Honour he prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him, and how troubled he was, that his Word
was already pa<U+017F>t to his Friend, the Count <hi>Vernole,</hi> whom
he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould marry, or remain for ever a Nun;
but if <hi>Rinaldo</hi> could di<U+017F>place his Love from <hi>Atlante,</hi>
and place it on <hi>Charlot,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould gladly con<U+017F>ent to the
Match. <hi>Bellyuard,</hi> who would now do any thing for
the Repo<U+017F>e of his Son, tho' he believ'd this Exchange
would not pa<U+017F>s, yet re<U+017F>olv'd to propo<U+017F>e it, <U+017F>ince by
Marrying him, he took him out of the Danger of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>'s
A<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>inates, who would never leave him, 'till they
had di<U+017F>patch'd him, <U+017F>hould he marry <hi>Atlante.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While <hi>Rinaldo</hi> was contriving a thou<U+017F>and Ways to
come to <U+017F>peak to, or <U+017F>end Billets to <hi>Atlante,</hi> none of
which would <U+017F>ucceed without the Aid of <hi>Charlot,</hi> his
Father came and propo<U+017F>ed this Agreement between <hi>De
Pays,</hi> and him<U+017F>elf, to his Son. At fir<U+017F>t <hi>Rinaldo</hi> receiv'd
it with chang'd Countenance, and a breaking Heart;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47213:246"/>
but <U+017F>wiftly turning from Thought to Thought, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
this the only way to come at <hi>Charlot,</hi> and <U+017F>o
con<U+017F>equently at <hi>Atlante;</hi> he therefore, after <U+017F>ome di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embled
Regret, con<U+017F>ents, with a <U+017F>ad put-on-Look:
And <hi>Charlot</hi> had Notice given her, to <U+017F>ee and entertain
<hi>Rinaldo.</hi> As yet they had not told her the Rea<U+017F>on;
which her Father would tell her, when he came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>it
her, he <U+017F>aid. <hi>Rinaldo</hi> over-joy'd at this Contrivance,
and his own Di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, goes to the Mona<U+017F>tery, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>its
<hi>Charlot;</hi> where he ought to have <U+017F>aid <U+017F>omething of
this Propo<U+017F>ition; but wholly bent upon other Thoughts,
he <U+017F>olicits her to convey <U+017F>ome Letters, and Pre<U+017F>ents to
<hi>Atlante;</hi> which <U+017F>he readily did, to the un<U+017F>peakable Joy
of the poor Di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>t. Sometimes he would talk to
<hi>Charlot</hi> of her own Affairs; asking her, If <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olv'd
to become a Nun? To which <U+017F>he would <U+017F>igh, and <U+017F>ay,
If <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t, it would be extreamly again<U+017F>t her Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and, if it plea<U+017F>ed her Father, <U+017F>he had rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the World with any tolerable Match.</p>
                  <p>Things pa<U+017F>t thus for <U+017F>ome Days, in which our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
were happy, and <hi>Vernole</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ured he <U+017F>hould have
<hi>Atlante.</hi> But at la<U+017F>t <hi>De Pays</hi> came to vi<U+017F>it <hi>Charlot,</hi> who
asked her, if <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een <hi>Rinaldo?</hi> <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, She
had. <hi>And how does he entertain you?</hi> reply'd <hi>De Pays;
Have you received him as a Husband? and has he behaved
him<U+017F>elf like one?</hi> At this a <U+017F>udden Joy <U+017F>eized the Heart
of <hi>Charlot;</hi> and loth to confe<U+017F>s what <U+017F>he had done for
him to her Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>he hung down her blu<U+017F>hing Face, to
<U+017F>tudy for an An<U+017F>wer. <hi>De Pays</hi> continued, and told her
the Agreement between <hi>Bellyuard</hi> and him, for the <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Blood<U+017F>hed.</p>
                  <p>She, who ble<U+017F>t the Cau<U+017F>e, whatever it was, having
always a great Friend<U+017F>hip and Tenderne<U+017F>s for <hi>Rinaldo,</hi>
gave her Father a thou<U+017F>and Thanks for his Care; and
a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was commanded by him, <U+017F>he
would receive him as her Husband.</p>
                  <p>And the next Day, when <hi>Rinaldo</hi> came to vi<U+017F>it her,
as he u<U+017F>ed to do, and bringing a Letter with him,
wherein he propo<U+017F>ed the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Atlante:</hi> He found a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47213:246"/>
Coldne<U+017F>s in <hi>Charlot,</hi> as <U+017F>oon as he told her his De<U+017F>ign,
and de<U+017F>ired her to carry the Letter. He asked the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of this Change<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> She tells him, <U+017F>he was informed of
the Agreement between their two Fathers, and that <U+017F>he
look'd upon her<U+017F>elf as his Wife, and would act no
more as a Confident, that <U+017F>he had ever a violent Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Friend<U+017F>hip for him, which <U+017F>he would <U+017F>oon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
into <U+017F>omething more <U+017F>oft.</p>
                  <p>He could not deny the Agreement, nor his Promi<U+017F>e;
but it was in vain to tell her, he did it only to get a
Corre<U+017F>pondence with <hi>Atlante:</hi> She is ob<U+017F>tinate, and he
as pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing, with all the Tenderne<U+017F>s of Per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion: He
vows he can never be any but <hi>Atlante</hi>'s; and <U+017F>he may
<U+017F>ee him die, but never break his Vows. She urges her
Claim in vain, <U+017F>o that at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was overcome, and
promi<U+017F>ed <U+017F>he would carry the Letter; which was to
have her make her e<U+017F>cape that Night. He waits at the
Grate for her An<U+017F>wer, and <hi>Charlot</hi> returns with one that
plea<U+017F>ed him very well; that was, that Night her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
would make her e<U+017F>cape, and that he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tand in
<U+017F>uch a place of the Nunnery-Wall, and <U+017F>he would come
out to him.</p>
                  <p>After this <U+017F>he upbraids him with his fal<U+017F>e Promi<U+017F>e to
her, and of her Goodne<U+017F>s to <U+017F>erve him after <U+017F>uch a Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.
He receives her Reproaches with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Sighs, and bemoans his Misfortune in not being
capable of more than Friend<U+017F>hip for her; and vows,
that next <hi>Atlante,</hi> he e<U+017F>teems her of all Womenkind.
She <U+017F>eems to be obliged by this, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, <U+017F>he
would ha<U+017F>ten the Flight of <hi>Atlante;</hi> and taking leave,
he went home to order a Coach, and <U+017F>ome Servants to
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, Count <hi>Vernole</hi> came to vi<U+017F>it <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante;</hi>
but <U+017F>he refu<U+017F>ed to be <U+017F>een by him: And all he
could do there that Afternoon, was entertaining <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi>
at the Grate; to whom he <U+017F>poke a great many fine
Things, both of her improved Beauty and Wit; and
how happy <hi>Rinaldo</hi> would be in <U+017F>o fair a Bride. She
received this with all the Civility that was due to his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47213:247"/>
Quality; and their Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e being at an end, he took
his leave, it being towards the Evening.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> wholly impatient, came betimes to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the dead Wall, where he was appointed to <U+017F>tand,
having ordered his Footmen and Coach to come to him
as <U+017F>oon as it was dark: While he was there walking
up and down, <hi>Vernole</hi> came by the end of the Wall to
go home, and looking about, he <U+017F>aw at the other end
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> walking, who<U+017F>e Back was towards him; but
he knew him well; and tho' he feared and dreaded his
Bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne<U+017F>s there, he dur<U+017F>t not encounter him, they being
both attended but by one Footman a piece. But <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>'s
Jealou<U+017F>ie and Indignation was <U+017F>o high, that he
re<U+017F>olv'd to fetch his Bravoes to his Aid, and come and a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ault
him; for he knew he waited there for <U+017F>ome Me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
from <hi>Atlante.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time it grew dark, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s Coach
came with another Footman; which were hardly arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
when <hi>Vernole,</hi> with his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, came to the
Corner of the Wall, and <U+017F>creening them<U+017F>elves a little
behind it, near to the place where <hi>Rinaldo</hi> <U+017F>tood, who
waited now clo<U+017F>e to a little Door, out of which the
Gardeners u<U+017F>ed to throw the Weeds and Dirt. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>
could perceive anon, the Door to open, and a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
come out of it, calling <hi>Rinaldo</hi> by his Name; who
<U+017F>tept up to her, and caught her in his Arms, with Signs
of infinite Joy. <hi>Vernole</hi> being now all Rage, cried to
his A<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>inate, <hi>Fall on, and kill the Ravi<U+017F>her:</hi> And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
they all fell on. <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> who had only his
two Footmen on his <U+017F>ide, was forced to let go the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
who would have run into the Garden again, but
the Door fell too, and lock'd; <U+017F>o that while <hi>Rinaldo</hi>
was fighting, and beaten back by the Bravoes, one of
which he laid dead at his Feet, <hi>Vernole</hi> came up to the
frighted Lady, and taking her by the Hand, cried,
<hi>Come, my fair Fugitive, you must along with me.</hi> She,
wholly <U+017F>cared out of her Sen<U+017F>es, was willing to go any
where out of the Terror <U+017F>he heard <U+017F>o near her, and
without Reply, gave her<U+017F>elf into his Hand; who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47213:247"/>
her directly to her Father's Hou<U+017F>e; where <U+017F>he was
no <U+017F>ooner come, but he told her Father all that had
pa<U+017F>t, and how <U+017F>he was running away with <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> but
that his good Fortune brought him ju<U+017F>t in the lucky Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.
Her Father turning to reproach her, found by
the Light of a Candle, that this was <hi>Charlot,</hi> and not
<hi>Atlante,</hi> whom <hi>Vernole</hi> had brought home: At which
<hi>Vernole</hi> was extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h'd. Her Father deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of her, Why <U+017F>he was running away with a Man,
who was de<U+017F>igned her by Con<U+017F>ent. <hi>Yes,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Charlot,
you had his Con<U+017F>ent, Sir, and that of his Father; but I
was far from getting it: I found he re<U+017F>olved to die, rather
than quit</hi> Atlante; <hi>And promi<U+017F>ing him my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance in
his Amour, <U+017F>ince he could never be mine, he got me to carry
a Letter to</hi> Atlante; <hi>which was, to de<U+017F>ire her to fly away
with him. In<U+017F>tead of carrying her this Letter, I told her, he
was de<U+017F>igned for me, and had cancelled all his Vows to her:
She <U+017F>wooned at this News; and being recovered a little, I
left her in the Hands of the Nuns, to per<U+017F>wade her to
live; which <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olves not to do without</hi> Rinaldo.
<hi>Though they pre<U+017F>s'd me, yet I re<U+017F>olved to pur<U+017F>ue my De<U+017F>ign,
which was to tell</hi> Rinaldo, <hi><U+017F>he would obey his kind Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
He waited for her; but I put my<U+017F>elf into his Hands
in lieu of</hi> Atlante; <hi>and had not the Count received me,
we had been married by this time, by <U+017F>ome fal<U+017F>e Light
that could not have di<U+017F>covered me: But I am <U+017F>atisfied, if
I had, he would never have lived with me longer than the
Cheat had been undi<U+017F>covered; for I find them both re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to die, rather than change: And for my part, Sir, I
was not <U+017F>o much in Love with</hi> Rinaldo, <hi>as I was out of
Love with a Nunnery; and took any Opportunity to quit
a Life ab<U+017F>olutely contrary to my Humour.</hi> She <U+017F>poke
this with a Gaiety <U+017F>o brisk, and an Air <U+017F>o agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that <hi>Vernole</hi> found it touch'd his Heart; and
the rather, becau<U+017F>e he found <hi>Atlante</hi> would never be
his; or if <U+017F>he were, he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>till in Danger from
the Re<U+017F>entment of <hi>Rinaldo;</hi> he therefore bowing to
<hi>Charlot,</hi> and taking her by the Hand, cryed, <hi>Madam,
<U+017F>ince Fortune has di<U+017F>pos'd you thus luckily for me, in my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47213:248"/>
Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion, I humbly implore you would con<U+017F>ent <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
make me entirely happy, and give me the Prize for which
I fought, and have conquered with my Sword. My Lord,</hi>
replied <hi>Charlot,</hi> with a mode<U+017F>t Air, <hi>I am <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to believe, that <U+017F>ince Fortune, <U+017F>o contrary to all our
De<U+017F>igns, has given me into your Hands, that <U+017F>he from the
beginning do<U+017F>tined me to the Honour; which, with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Con<U+017F>ent, I <U+017F>hall receive as becomes me. De Pais</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ported
with Joy, to find all things would be <U+017F>o well
brought about; it being all one to him, whether <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi>
or <hi>Atlante</hi> gave him Count <hi>Vernole</hi> for his Son-in-Law,
readily con<U+017F>ented; and immediately a Prie<U+017F>t was
<U+017F>ent for; and they were that Night married. And
it being now not above Seven a Clock, many of their
Friends were invited, the Mu<U+017F>ick <U+017F>ent for, and as
good a Supper as <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time would provide, was
made ready.</p>
                  <p>All this was performed in as <U+017F>hort a time as <hi>Rinaldo</hi>
was fighting; and having killed one, and wounded
the re<U+017F>t, they all fled before his conquering Sword;
which was never drawn with <U+017F>o good a Will. When
he came where his Coach <U+017F>tood, ju<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t the Back-Garden-Door,
he looked for his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: But the
Coachman told him, He was no <U+017F>ooner engaged, but a
Man came, and with a thou<U+017F>and Reproaches on her
Levity, bore her off.</p>
                  <p>This made our young Lover rave; and he is <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<U+017F>he is in the Hands of his Rival; and that he had
been fighting, and <U+017F>hedding his Blood, only to <U+017F>ecure
her Flight with him. He lo<U+017F>t all Patience; and it was
with much ado his Servants per<U+017F>waded him to return;
telling him, in their Opinion, <U+017F>he was more likely to get
out of the Hands of his Rival, and come to him, than
when <U+017F>he was in the Mona<U+017F>tery.</p>
                  <p>He <U+017F>uffers him<U+017F>elf to go into his Coach, and be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
home; but he was no <U+017F>ooner alighted, but he heard
Mu<U+017F>ick, and a Noi<U+017F>e of Fe<U+017F>tival at <hi>De Pays</hi>'s Hou<U+017F>e.
He <U+017F>aw Coaches <U+017F>urround his Door, and Pages and
Footmen, with Flambeaus. This Sight and Noi<U+017F>e of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47213:248"/>
Joy made him ready to <U+017F>ink at the Door; and <U+017F>ending
his Footman to learn the Cau<U+017F>e of this Triumph; the
Pages that waited there, told him, That Count <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>
was, this Night, married to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>De Pais</hi>'s
Daughter. He needed no more to deprive him of all
Sen<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>taggering again<U+017F>t his Coach, he was
caught by his Footmen, and carried into his Hou<U+017F>e,
and to his Chamber, where they put him to Bed, all
<U+017F>en<U+017F>le<U+017F>s as he was, and had much ado to recover him
to Life. He asked for his Father, with a faint Voice;
for he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee him before he died. It was told
him, he was gone to Count <hi>Vernole</hi>'s Wedding, where
there was a perfect Peace agreed on between them, and
all Animo<U+017F>ities laid a<U+017F>ide. At this News <hi>Rinaldo</hi> faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again; and his Servants called his Father home, and
told him in what Condition they had brought home their
Ma<U+017F>ter, recounting to him all that was pa<U+017F>t. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ted
to <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> whom he found ju<U+017F>t recovered of his
Swooning; who, putting his Hand out to his Father,
all cold, and trembling, cry'd, <hi>Well, Sir, now you are
<U+017F>atisfied, <U+017F>ince you have <U+017F>een</hi> Atlante <hi>married to Count</hi>
Vernole: <hi>I hope now you will give your unfortunate Son
leave to die; as you wi<U+017F>h'd he <U+017F>hould, rather than give him
to the Arms of</hi> Atlante. Here his Speech failed, and he
fell again into a Fit of Swoooning: His Father ready
to die with Fear of his Son's Death, kneeled down by
his Bed-<U+017F>ide; and after having recovered him a little,
he <U+017F>aid, <hi>My dear Son, I have been indeed at the Wedding
of Count</hi> Vernole; <hi>but 'tis not to</hi> Atlante, <hi>to whom he is
married, but</hi> Charlot; <hi>who was the Per<U+017F>on you were bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Mona<U+017F>tery, in<U+017F>tead of</hi> Atlante; <hi>who is <U+017F>till
re<U+017F>erved for you, and is dying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>till <U+017F>he hear you are re<U+017F>erved
for her: Therefore, as you regard her Life, make much of
your own, and make your <U+017F>elf fit to receive her: For her
Father<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and I have agreed the Marriage already.</hi> And
without giving him leave to thank him, he called to
one of his Gentlemen, and <U+017F>ent him to the Mona<U+017F>tery,
with this News to <hi>Atlante. Rinaldo</hi> bowed him<U+017F>elf as
low as he could in his Bed, and ki<U+017F>s'd the Hand of his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47213:249"/>
Father, with Tears of Joy: But his Weakne<U+017F>s conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
all next Day; and they were fain to bring <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante</hi>
to him, to confirm his Happine<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>It mu<U+017F>t only be gue<U+017F><U+017F>ed by Lovers, the perfect Joy
the<U+017F>e two received in the <U+017F>ight of each other. <hi>Bellyuard</hi>
received her as his Daughter; and the next Day made
her <U+017F>o with very great Solemnity; at which were <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi>
and <hi>Charlot:</hi> Between <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> and him, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
a perfect Peace, and all thought them<U+017F>elves
happy in this double Union.</p>

COURT
OF THE
King of Bantam.</head>
                  <p>THIS <hi>Money,</hi> certainly, is a mo<U+017F>t
Dev'li<U+017F>h Thing! I'm <U+017F>ure, the want
of it had like to have ruin'd my dear
<hi>Philibella</hi> in her Love to <hi>Valentine
Goodland;</hi> who was, really, a pretty
de<U+017F>erving Gentleman, Heir to about Fifteen-hundred
Pound a Year; which, however did
not <U+017F>o much recommend him, as <hi>the Sweetne<U+017F>s of
his Temper, the Comeline<U+017F>s of his Per<U+017F>on,</hi> and <hi>the
Excellency of his Parts:</hi> In all which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances
my obliging Acquaintance equall'd him,
unle<U+017F>s in the advantage of their Fortune. Old
Sir <hi>George Goodland</hi> knew of his Son's Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
for <hi>Philibella;</hi> and though he was Generous,
and of an Humour <U+017F>ufficiently Complying, yet
he cou'd by no means think it convenient, that
his only Son <U+017F>hou'd marry with a young Lady
of <U+017F>o <U+017F>lender a Fortune as my Friend, who had
not above Five hundred Pound, and that the
Gift of her Uncle Sir <hi>Philip Friendly;</hi> though
her Vertue and Beauty might have de<U+017F>erv'd and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47213:251"/>
have adorn'd the Throne of an <hi>Alexander</hi> or
<hi>Cae<U+017F>ar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Philip</hi> him<U+017F>elf, indeed, was but a Younger
Brother, though of a Good Family, and of a
Generous Education; which with his <hi>Per<U+017F>on,
Bravery</hi> and <hi>Wit,</hi> recommended him to his
Lady <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Widow of Sir <hi>Bartholomew
Banquier,</hi> who left her po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd of Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> be<U+017F>ides Twenty thou<U+017F>and
Pound in Money and Jewels; which oblig'd
him to get him<U+017F>elf <hi>Dubb'd,</hi> that <U+017F>he might not
de<U+017F>cend to an <hi>inferior</hi> Quality. When he was in
Town, he liv'd—Let me <U+017F>ee! in the <hi>Strand;</hi>
or, as near as I can remember, <U+017F>omewhere
about <hi>Charing-Cro<U+017F>s;</hi> where, fir<U+017F>t of all,
Mr. <hi>Wou'd be King,</hi> a Gentleman of a large
E<U+017F>tate in Hou<U+017F>es, Land and Money, of a <hi>ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ghty,
extravagant</hi> and <hi>profu<U+017F>e Humour,</hi> very fond of
every new Face, had the misfortune to fall pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ionately
in love with <hi>Philibella,</hi> who then liv'd
with her Uncle.</p>
                  <p>This Mr. <hi>Wou'd be</hi> (it <U+017F>eems) had often been
told, when he was yet a Stripling, either by one
of his <hi>Nur<U+017F>es,</hi> by his own <hi>Grand-mother,</hi> or by
<U+017F>ome other <hi>Gyp<U+017F>ie,</hi> that he <U+017F>hou'd infallibly be
what his Sirname imply'd, <hi>a King,</hi> by <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
or <hi>Chance,</hi> e're he dy'd, or never. This
glorious <hi>Prophecy</hi> had <U+017F>o great an Influence on
all his Thoughts and Actions, that he di<U+017F>tributed
and di<U+017F>pers'd his Wealth <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o largely,
that one wou'd ha' thought he had undoubtedly
been King of <U+017F>ome part of the <hi>Indies;</hi> to <U+017F>ee a
Pre<U+017F>ent made, to day, of a <hi>Diamond-Ring,</hi> worth
Two or Three hundred Pound, to <hi>Madam Flip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant;</hi>
tomorrow, a large Che<U+017F>t of the fine<U+017F>t <hi>China,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:251"/>
to <hi>my Lady Fleecewell;</hi> and next day (perhaps)
a rich <hi>Necklace of large Oriental Pearl,</hi> with a
<hi>Locquet</hi> to it of <hi>Saphires, Emeralds, Rubies,</hi> &amp;c.
to pretty <hi>Mi<U+017F><U+017F>. Ogleme,</hi> for an Amorous Glance,
for a Smile, and (it may be, though but rarely)
for the mighty Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing of one <U+017F>ingle Ki<U+017F>s.
But <U+017F>uch were his Large<U+017F><U+017F>es, not to reckon his
Treats, his Balls, and Serenades be<U+017F>ides, that
at the <U+017F>ame time he had marry'd a Vertuous
Lady, and of Good Quality: but her Relation
to him (it may be fear'd) made her very di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable:
For a Man of his Humour and E<U+017F>tate
can no more be <U+017F>atisfy'd with one Woman, than
with one Di<U+017F>h of Meat: And, to <U+017F>ay truth, 'tis
<U+017F>omething unmodi<U+017F>h. However, he might ha'
dy'd a pure Celibate, and altogether unexpert
of Woman, had his good or bad hopes only
terminated in Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s Niece. But the <hi>Brave</hi>
and <hi>Haughty</hi> Mr. <hi>Wou'd be</hi> was not to be baulk'd
by <hi>Appearances</hi> of Virtue, which he thought all
Womankind did only affect; be<U+017F>ides, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him<U+017F>elf the Victory over any Lady whom
he attempted, by the force of his damn'd Money,
though her Virtue were never <U+017F>o real and
<U+017F>trict.</p>
                  <p>With <hi>Philibella</hi> he found another pretty
young Creature, very like her, who had been
a <hi>quondam</hi> Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s to Sir <hi>Philip:</hi> He, with
young <hi>Goodland,</hi> was then diverting his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
and Niece at a Game of Cards, when <hi>Wou'd be</hi>
came to vi<U+017F>it him: he found 'em very merry,
with a Fla<U+017F>que of Claret or two before 'em, and
Oranges roa<U+017F>ting by a large Fire, (for it was
<hi>Chri<U+017F>tmas</hi>-time.) The Lady <hi>Friendly</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding
that this Extraordinary Man was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:252"/>
with Sir <hi>Philip</hi> in the Parlour, came in to 'em,
to make the number of both Sexes equal, as
well as in hopes to make up a Pur<U+017F>e of Guinea's
toward the purcha<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome new fine bus'ne<U+017F>s
that <U+017F>he had in her head, from his accu<U+017F>tom'd
De<U+017F>ign of lo<U+017F>ing at play to her. Indeed, <U+017F>he
had part of her Wi<U+017F>h; for <U+017F>he got Twenty
Guinea's of him; <hi>Philibella,</hi> Ten; and <hi>Lucy,</hi>
Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s Quondam, Five: Not but that
<hi>Wou'd be</hi> intended better Fortune to the young
ones, than he did to Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s Lady; but her
Lady<U+017F>hip was utterly unwilling to give him
over to their Management, though at the la<U+017F>t.
When they were all tir'd with the Cards, after
<hi>Wou'd be</hi> had <U+017F>aid as many obliging things as his
pre<U+017F>ent Genius wou'd give him leave, to <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
and <hi>Lucy,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially to the fir<U+017F>t, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
his Bai<U+017F>emains to the Lady <hi>Friendly,</hi> he
bid the Knight and <hi>Goodland</hi> adieu; but with a
Promi<U+017F>e of repeating his Vi<U+017F>it at <U+017F>ix a clok in the
Evening o' <hi>Twelfth-day,</hi> to renew the famous and
ancient Solemnity of <hi>Chu<U+017F>ing King and Queen;</hi>
to which Sir <hi>Philip</hi> before invited him, with a
De<U+017F>ign yet unknown to you, I hope.</p>
                  <p>As <U+017F>oon as he was gone, every one made their
Remarks on him, but with very little or no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in all their figures of him. In <U+017F>hort,
<hi>all Mankind,</hi> had they ever known him, wou'd
have univer<U+017F>ally agreed in this his Character,
<hi>That he was an Original;</hi> <U+017F>ince nothing in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi>
was ever <U+017F>o <hi>Vain,</hi> <U+017F>o <hi>Haughty,</hi> <U+017F>o <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>e,</hi>
<U+017F>o <hi>Fond,</hi> and <U+017F>o <hi>ridiculou<U+017F>ly Ambitious</hi> as
<hi>Mr. Wou'd be King.</hi> They Laugh'd and Talk'd
about an hour longer, and then young <hi>Goodland</hi>
was oblig'd to <U+017F>ee <hi>Lucy</hi> home in his Coach; tho'
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:252"/>
he had rather have <U+017F>ate up all Night in the
<U+017F>ame Hou<U+017F>e with <hi>Philibella,</hi> I fan<U+017F>ie, of whom
he took but an unwilling leave; which was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
enough to every one there, <U+017F>ince they
were all acquainted with his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for my
Fair Friend.</p>
                  <p>About Twelve a' clock on the Day prefix'd,
young <hi>Goodland</hi> came to Dine with Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>
whom he found ju<U+017F>t return'd from Court, in a
very good Humour. On the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Valentine,</hi>
the Knight ran to him, and embracing him,
told him, That he had prevented his Wi<U+017F>hes,
in coming thither before he <U+017F>ent for him, as he
had ju<U+017F>t then de<U+017F>ign'd. T'other return'd, That
he therefore hop'd he might be of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice
to him, by <U+017F>o happy a prevention of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Kindne<U+017F>s. No doubt, (reply'd Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>)
the Kindne<U+017F>s, I hope, will be to us both; I am
a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd it will, if you will act according to my
mea<U+017F>ures. I de<U+017F>ire no better Pre<U+017F>criptions for
my Happine<U+017F>s (return'd <hi>Valentine</hi>) than what
you <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e to <U+017F>et down to me: But is it
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary or convenient that I <U+017F>hou'd know 'em
fir<U+017F>t? It is, (an<U+017F>wer'd Sir <hi>Philip;</hi>) Let us <U+017F>it,
and you <U+017F>hall under<U+017F>tand 'em.—I am very
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible (continu'd he) of your <U+017F>incere and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Affection and Pretention to my Niece,
who, perhaps, is as dear to me as my own Child
cou'd be, had I one; nor am I ignorant how
aver<U+017F>e Sir <hi>George</hi> your Father is to your marriage
with her, in<U+017F>omuch that I am confident he
would di<U+017F>hinherit you immediately upon it,
meerly for want of a Fortune <U+017F>omewhat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to your E<U+017F>tate; but I have now
contriv'd the means to add Two or Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:253"/>
Pounds to the Five hundred I de<U+017F>ign'd to
give with her; I mean, if you marry her, <hi>Val.</hi>
not otherwi<U+017F>e; for I will not labour <U+017F>o for any
other Man. What inviolable Obligations you
put upon me! (cry'd <hi>Goodland.</hi>) No Returns
by way of Complements, good <hi>Val.</hi> (<U+017F>aid the
Knight:) Had I not engag'd to my Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
marriage, that I wou'd not di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of
any part of what <U+017F>he brought me, without her
con<U+017F>ent, I wou'd certainly make <hi>Philibella's</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
an<U+017F>werable to your E<U+017F>tate: And be<U+017F>ides,
my Wife is not yet full Eight and twenty, and
we may therefore expect Children of our own,
which hinders me from propo<U+017F>ing any thing
more for the advantage of my Niece:—But
now to my In<U+017F>tructions;—<hi>King</hi> will
be here this Evening, without fail, and, at <U+017F>ome

                  </p>
                  <p>Exactly at Six a' clock came <hi>Wou'd be</hi> in his
Coach and Six, and found Sir <hi>Philip</hi> and his
Lady, <hi>Goodland, Philibella</hi> and <hi>Lucy</hi> ready to
receive him; <hi>Lucy</hi> as Fine as a Dutche<U+017F>s, and
almo<U+017F>t as Beautiful as <U+017F>he was before her Fall.
All things were in ample Order for his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.
They Play'd till Supper was <U+017F>erv'd
in, which was between Eight and Nine. The
Treat was very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable and <U+017F>plendid. Ju<U+017F>t
as the Second Cour<U+017F>e was <U+017F>et on the Table,
they were all on a <U+017F>udden <U+017F>urpriz'd, except
<hi>Wou'd be,</hi> with a Flouri<U+017F>h of Violins, and other
In<U+017F>truments, which proceeded to entertain 'em
with the be<U+017F>t and newe<U+017F>t Airs in the la<U+017F>t new
Plays, being then in the Year 1683. The
Ladies were curious to know to whom they
ow'd this chearful part of their Entertainment:
On which he call'd out, Hey! <hi>Tom Farmer!
Aleworth! Eccles! Hall!</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of you!
Here's a Health to the<U+017F>e Ladies, and all this
Honourable Company. They Bow'd; He Drank,
and commanded another Gla<U+017F>s to be fill'd, into
which he put <U+017F>omething yet better than the
<hi>Wine,</hi> I mean, Ten Guinea's: Here, <hi>Farmer,</hi>
(<U+017F>aid he then;) This for you and your Friends.
We humbly thank the Honourable Mr. <hi>Wou'd be
King.</hi> They all return'd, and <U+017F>truck up with
more <U+017F>pritelyne<U+017F>s than before. For <hi>Gold</hi> and
<hi>Wine,</hi> doubtle<U+017F>s, are the be<U+017F>t Ro<U+017F>in for Mu<U+017F>icians.</p>
                  <p>After Supper, they took a hearty Gla<U+017F>s or
two to the King, Queen, Duke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then
the mighty <hi>Cake,</hi> Teeming with the Fate of
this Extraordinary Per<U+017F>onage was brought in,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:254"/>
the Mu<U+017F>icians playing an <hi>Overture</hi> at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the <hi>Alimental Oracle;</hi> which was then
Cut and Con<U+017F>ulted, and the Royal <hi>Bean</hi> and
<hi>Pea</hi> fell to tho<U+017F>e to whom Sir <hi>Philip</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign'd
'em. 'Twas then the Knight began a
merry Bumper, with Three Huzza's, and,
<hi>Long live King Wou'd be!</hi> to <hi>Goodland;</hi> who
Echo'd, and Pledg'd him, putting the Gla<U+017F>s
about to the Harmonious Attendants: while
the Ladies drank their own quantities, among
them<U+017F>elves, <hi>To his afore<U+017F>aid Maje<U+017F>ty.</hi> Then of
cour<U+017F>e, you may believe, <hi>Queen Lucy</hi>'s Health
went merrily round, with the <U+017F>ame Ceremony.
After which, he <U+017F>aluted his Royal <hi>Con<U+017F>ort,</hi>
and conde<U+017F>cended to do the <U+017F>ame Honour to
the two other Ladies.</p>
                  <p>Then they fell a Dancing like Lightning;
I mean, they mov'd as <U+017F>wift, and made <hi>almo<U+017F>t</hi>
as little Noi<U+017F>e: But His <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty</hi> was <U+017F>oon weary
of that; for he long'd to be making Love
both to <hi>Philibella</hi> and <hi>Lucy,</hi> who (believe me)
that Night might well enough have pa<U+017F>s'd for
a Queen.</p>
                  <p>They fell then to <hi>Que<U+017F>tions and Commands;</hi>
to <hi>Cro<U+017F>s Purpo<U+017F>es; I Think a Thought, What is
it like?</hi> &amp;c. In all which, His <hi>Wou'd be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je<U+017F>ty</hi>
took the opportunity of <U+017F>hewing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of his Parts, as, How Fit he was to
Govern; How Dexterous at Mining and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining;
and, How he cou'd Reconcile the
mo<U+017F>t Contrary and Di<U+017F>tant Thoughts. The
Mu<U+017F>ick, at la<U+017F>t, good as it was, grew trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om,
and too loud; which made him di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s
'em: And then he began to this effect, addre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing

However, you <U+017F>hou'd not <U+017F>o liberally have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s'd

But how <U+017F>hall we compa<U+017F>s it? (ask'd t'other.)
Why thus; Throw away Three thou<U+017F>and

Five hundred Guinea's to Her Maje<U+017F>ty, the

Twenty Guinea's the Game, and Forty the

                  <p>It was then about the hour that Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s

<hi>King</hi>—was in an odd <U+017F>ort of Taking, when he
heard that <hi>Valentine</hi> was Below; and had been,
as Sir <hi>Philip</hi> inform'd <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty,</hi> at <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
to enquire for him there: but when he
told him, that he had already <U+017F>chool'd him,
on his own behalf, for the Affront done in his
Hou<U+017F>e, and that he believ'd he cou'd bring
his Maje<U+017F>ty off without any lo<U+017F>s of pre<U+017F>ent Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
his Countenance vi<U+017F>ibly di<U+017F>cover'd his

much encreas'd too, when <hi>Friendly,</hi> <U+017F>hewing
him his Bond for the Money he won of him at

His <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty of Bantam</hi> was then in <U+017F>o good an

                  <p>The Play done, they took each of 'em a

de<U+017F>ired; for he had taken <U+017F>uch care, that all
things were in readine<U+017F>s before Eight, only he
was to expect the Mu<U+017F>ick, till the end of the
Play. About Nine, Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> his Lady, <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Philibella</hi> and <hi>Lucy</hi> came. Sir <hi>Philip</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd

him, wherein the Knight had written, in an

                     </q>
They had hardly made an end of reading 'em,
e're the whole Company, and more than he
had invited, came in, and were receiv'd with
a great deal of Formality and Magnificence
<hi>Lucy</hi> was there attended as his <hi>Queen;</hi> and
<hi>Philibella,</hi> as the <hi>Prince<U+017F>s</hi> her Si<U+017F>ter. They
Danc'd then till they were weary; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

retir'd to another large Room, where

The Wines were all mo<U+017F>t excellent in their

every corner of the Hou<U+017F>e: There was <U+017F>carce
a Spark <U+017F>ober in the whole Company, with
drinking repeated Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es to the Health of the

                  <p>About Three the next afternoon they both
Wak'd, as by con<U+017F>ent, and call'd to Dre<U+017F>s.
And after that bus'ne<U+017F>s was over, I think, they
<U+017F>wallow'd each of 'em a Pint of <hi>Old-Hook,</hi> with
a little Sugar, by the way of Healing. Their

wou'd have him go the <hi>Play</hi> that Night, which
was, <hi>The London Cuckolds;</hi> promi<U+017F>ing to meet
him there in le<U+017F>s than Half an Hour after his
departure; telling him withal, that he wou'd
<U+017F>urprize him with a much better Entertainment
than the Stage afforded. <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty</hi> took the
Hint, imagining, and that rightly, that the <hi>Knight</hi>
had <U+017F>ome Intrigue in his head, for the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Commonwealth of Cuckoldom: in
order therefore to his Advice, he took his leave,
about a Quarter of an Hour after.</p>

When he was gone, Sir <hi>Philip</hi> thus be<U+017F>poke
his pretended Niece; Madam, I hope your
<hi>Maje<U+017F>ty</hi> will not refu<U+017F>e me the Honour of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on you to a Place where you will meet with
better Entertainment than your <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty</hi> can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from the be<U+017F>t Comedy in Chri<U+017F>tendom.
<hi>Val.</hi> (continu'd he,) you mu<U+017F>t go with us, to
<U+017F>ecure me again<U+017F>t the Jealou<U+017F>ie of my Wife.
That, indeed, (return'd his <hi>Lady</hi>) is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial;
and you are mightily concern'd not to
give me occa<U+017F>ion, I mu<U+017F>t own. You <U+017F>ee I am
now, (reply'd he:) But—Come! on with
Hoods and Scarf! (pur<U+017F>u'd he, to <hi>Lucy.</hi>) Then
addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf again to his Lady; Madam,
(<U+017F>aid he,) we'll wait on you in le<U+017F>s time than
I cou'd have drank a Bottle to my <U+017F>hare. (The
Coach was got ready, and on they drove to the
<hi>Play-hou<U+017F>e.</hi>) By the way, <U+017F>aid <hi>Friendly</hi> to <hi>Val.</hi>—Your
Honour, Noble <hi>Peer,</hi> mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>et

Company, I warrant, (return'd t'other)
for the<U+017F>e long three Hours. Why, (cry'd
<hi>Lucy,</hi>) you don't mean, I hope, to leave me
with his <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty of Bantam?</hi> 'Tis for thy
Good, Child! 'Tis for thy Good! (return'd
<hi>Friendly.</hi>) To the <hi>Ro<U+017F>e</hi> they got then; where
<hi>Goodland</hi> lighted, and expected Sir <hi>Philip;</hi> who
led <hi>Lucy</hi> into the King's Box, to his <hi>New Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je<U+017F>ty;</hi>
where, after the fir<U+017F>t Scene, he left 'em
together. The over-joy'd Fanta<U+017F>tick <hi>Monarch</hi>
wou'd fain have <U+017F>aid <U+017F>ome fine obliging things to
the Knight, as he was going out; but <hi>Friendly</hi>'s
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47213:262"/>
ha<U+017F>te prevented 'em, who went directly to
<hi>Valentine,</hi> took one Gla<U+017F>s, call'd a Reck'ning,
mounted Chariot, and away home they came:
where, I believe, he was welcome to his Lady;
for I never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, his <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty</hi> had not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to <U+017F>tay out half the Play, at which he was
<U+017F>aluted by above twenty Gentlemen and Ladies
by his New and Mighty Title: but out he led
Mi<U+017F>s <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty,</hi> e're the Third Act was half done;
pretetending, that it was <U+017F>o Damn'd Bawdy
a Play, that he knew her Mode<U+017F>ty had been
already but too much offended at it; <U+017F>o into
his Coach he got her. When they were <U+017F>eated,
<U+017F>he told him <U+017F>he wou'd go to no place with him,
but to the Lodgings her Mother had taken for
her, when <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t came to Town, and which
<U+017F>till <U+017F>he kept. Your Mother! Madam, (cry'd
he;) Why, is Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s Si<U+017F>ter living then?
His Brother's Widow is, Sir, (<U+017F>he reply'd.)
Is <U+017F>he there? (he ask'd.) No, Sir, (<U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd;)
<U+017F>he's in the Countrey. Oh, then
we'll go thither to chu<U+017F>e. The Coach-man
was then order'd to drive to <hi>Germin's-<U+017F>treet;</hi>
where, when he came into the Lodgings, he
found 'em very rich and modi<U+017F>hly furni<U+017F>h'd.
He pre<U+017F>ently call'd one of his Slaves, and whi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
him to get three or four pretty Di<U+017F>hes
for Supper; and then getting a Pen, Ink and
Paper, writ a Note to <hi>C</hi>—<hi>d</hi> the Gold<U+017F>mith,
within <hi>Temple-Barr,</hi> for Five hundred Guinea's;
which <hi>Watchwell</hi> brought him in little more
than an Hour's time, when they were ju<U+017F>t in
the height of Supper; <hi>Lucy</hi> having invited her
Landlady, for the better colour of the matter.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:262"/>
His <hi>Bantamite Maje<U+017F>ty</hi> took the Gold from his
Slave, and threw it by him in the Window,
that <hi>Lucy</hi> might take notice of it; (which, you
may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>he did, and after Supper,
wink'd on the goodly Matron of the Hou<U+017F>e to
retire; which <U+017F>he immediately obey'd.) Then
his <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty</hi> began his Court very earne<U+017F>tly and
hotly, throwing the naked Guinea's into her
Lap: which <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem'd to refu<U+017F>e, with much
Di<U+017F>dain; but, upon his repeated Promi<U+017F>es,
confirm'd by unheard of Oaths and Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that he wou'd give her Si<U+017F>ter Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
Guinea's to her Portion, <U+017F>he began by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to mollifie, and let the Gold lie quietly
in her Lap: And the next night, after he had
drawn Notes on two or three of his Bankers,
for the Payment of Three thou<U+017F>and Guinea's
to Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> or Order, and receiv'd his own
Bond, made for what he had lo<U+017F>t at Play, from
<hi>Friendly,</hi> <U+017F>he made no great difficulty to admit
his <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty</hi> to her Bed. Where I think fit to
leave 'em for the pre<U+017F>ent; for (perhaps) they
had <U+017F>ome private Bus'ne<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning, before the <hi>Titular King</hi>
was (I won't <U+017F>ay, <hi>up,</hi> or <hi><U+017F>tirring,</hi> but) our
o' bed, young <hi>Goodland</hi> and <hi>Philibella</hi> were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
marry'd; the Bills being all Accepted
and Paid in Two Days time. As <U+017F>oon as ever
the <hi>Phanta<U+017F>tick Monarch</hi> cou'd find in his heart
to divorce him<U+017F>elf from the dear and charming
Embraces of his Beautiful Bedfellow, he came
flying to Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> with all the ha<U+017F>te that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
Big with Plea<U+017F>ure cou'd in<U+017F>pire him
with, to di<U+017F>charge it <U+017F>elf to a <U+017F>uppos'd Friend.
The Knight told him, that he was really much
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:263"/>
troubl'd, to find that his Niece had yielded <U+017F>o
<U+017F>oon and ea<U+017F>ily to him; however, he wi<U+017F>h'd
him Joy. To which t'other return'd, That
he cou'd never want it, whil<U+017F>t he had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <U+017F>o much Beauty, and that without the
ungrateful Obligations of Matrimony, which
certainly are the mo<U+017F>t Nau<U+017F>eous, Hateful, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
and De<U+017F>tructive of Love imaginable.
Think you <U+017F>o, Sir? (ask'd the <hi>Knight;</hi>) We
<U+017F>hall hear what a Friend of mine will <U+017F>ay on
<U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion, to morrow about this time:

unea<U+017F>ie as you <U+017F>eem to be in that circum<U+017F>tance.
Be a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd I will, (return'd t'other;) But when
<U+017F>hall I <U+017F>ee the Sweet, the Dear, the Blooming,

at Dinner. Where's her Maje<U+017F>ty? (ask'd Sir
<hi>Philip.</hi>) Had you enquir'd before, <U+017F>he had
been here; for, Look, <U+017F>he comes. <hi>Friendly</hi>
<U+017F>eem'd to regard her with a kind of Di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure,
and whi<U+017F>per'd <hi>Maje<U+017F>ty,</hi> that he <U+017F>hou'd expre<U+017F>s
no particular Symptoms of Familiarity with
<hi>Lucy</hi> in his Hou<U+017F>e, at any time, e<U+017F>pecially when
<hi>Goodland</hi> was there, as then he was above with
his Lady and <hi>Philibella,</hi> who came down pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
after to Dinner.</p>
                  <p>About Four a clock, as his Maje<U+017F>ty had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigu'd
with her, <hi>Lucy</hi> took a Hackney-Coach
and went to her Lodgings; whither, about an
hour after, he follow'd her. Next Morning,
at Nine, he came to <hi>Friendly</hi>'s, who carry'd him
up to <U+017F>ee his new marry'd Friends—But
(O Damnation to Thought!) what Torments
did he feel, when he <U+017F>aw young Goodland and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47213:263"/>
                     <hi>Philibella</hi> in bed together; the la<U+017F>t of which
return'd him humble and hearty Thanks for
her Portion and Husband, as the fir<U+017F>t did for
his Wife. He <U+017F>hook his Head at Sir <hi>Philip,</hi>
and without <U+017F>peaking one word, left 'em and
hurry'd to <hi>Lucy,</hi> to lament the ill treatment
he had met with from <hi>Friendly.</hi> They <hi>Coo'd</hi>
and <hi>Bill'd</hi> as long as <hi>He</hi> was able; <U+017F>he (Sweet
Hypocrite) <U+017F>eeming to 'moan his Misfortunes:
which he took <U+017F>o kindly, that when he left her,
which was about Three in the Afternoon, he
caus'd a Scrivener to draw up an In<U+017F>trument,
wherein he <U+017F>ettl'd a Hundred Pounds a Year
on <hi>Lucy,</hi> for her Life, and gave her an Hundred
Guinea's more again<U+017F>t her Lying-in: (For <U+017F>he
told him (and indeed 'twas true) that <U+017F>he was
with Child, and knew her <U+017F>elf to be <U+017F>o, from
a very good Rea<U+017F>on—) And indeed <U+017F>he
was <U+017F>o—by the <hi>Friendly</hi> Knight. When he
return'd to her, he threw the Obliging In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into her Lap; (it <U+017F>eems, he had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Kindne<U+017F>s for that Place—) then call'd
for Wine, and <U+017F>omething to eat; for he had
not drank a Pint to his <U+017F>hare all the day, (tho'
he had ply'd it at the <hi>Chocolate-hou<U+017F>e</hi>—) The
Landlady, who was invited to Sup with 'em,
bid 'em Good-night, about Eleven; when they
went to bed, and, <hi>partly, <U+017F>lept</hi> till about Six;
when they were entertain'd by <U+017F>ome Gentlemen
of their Acquaintance, who Play'd and Sung
very finely, by way of <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> the<U+017F>e words
and more:
<q>
                        <l>Joy to Great <hi>Bantam!</hi>

The re<U+017F>t I have forgot. He took <U+017F>ome offence
at the Words; but more at the Vi<U+017F>it that
Sir <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Goodland</hi> made him, about an
hour after, who found him in Bed with his
<hi>Royal Con<U+017F>ort,</hi> and after having wi<U+017F>h'd 'em Joy,
and thrown their <hi>Maje<U+017F>ties</hi> own Shooes and

<hi>Monarch in Fan<U+017F>ie</hi> <U+017F>o great a Caution, that he
took his <hi>Royal Con<U+017F>ort</hi> into the Countrey, (but

but <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>more Fatal Love,</hi> cou'd
have divided 'em. However, at pre<U+017F>ent, they
were united and <U+017F>ecure:</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, Don <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian</hi>'s Friend was
ju<U+017F>t going to call help to carry off the Bodies,
as the—came by; who <U+017F>eeing three
Men lie dead, <U+017F>eiz'd the fourth; who, as he
was about to ju<U+017F>tifie him<U+017F>elf, by di<U+017F>covering one
of the Authors of <U+017F>o much Blood<U+017F>hed, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by a Groan from his <U+017F>uppos'd dead
Friend Don <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian;</hi> whom, after a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <U+017F>ome part of the matter, and the
knowledge of his Quality, they took up, and
carry'd to his Hou<U+017F>e; where, within a few
days, he was recover'd pa<U+017F>t the fear of Death.
All this while, <hi>Henrique</hi> and <hi>Antonio</hi> dur<U+017F>t not
appear, <U+017F>o much as by Night; nor cou'd be
found, though diligent and daily <U+017F>earch was
made after the fir<U+017F>t: but upon Don <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian</hi>'s
Recovery, the Search cea<U+017F>ing, they took the
advantage of the Night, and, in Di<U+017F>guize, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to <hi>Sevil.</hi> 'Twas there they thought
them<U+017F>elves mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecure, where indeed they
were in the greate<U+017F>t danger; for tho' (hap'ly)
they might there have e<U+017F>cap'd the murtherous
Attempt of Don <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian</hi> and his Friends, yet
they cou'd not there avoid the malicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of their Stars.</p>
                  <p>This City gave Birth to <hi>Antonio,</hi> and to the
cau<U+017F>e of his greate<U+017F>t Misfortunes, as well as of
his Death. Donna <hi>Ardelia</hi> was born there, a
Miracle of Beauty and Fal<U+017F>hood. 'Twas more
than a Year <U+017F>ince Don <hi>Antonio</hi> had fir<U+017F>t <hi><U+017F>een</hi> and
<hi>lov'd</hi> her. (For 'twas impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible any Man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:267"/>
<U+017F>hou'd do one without t'other.) He had had
the unkind opportunity of <U+017F>peaking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
a Billette to her at Church; and to his
greater misfortune, the next time he found her
there, he met with too kind a return both
from her Eyes, and from her Hand, which
privately <U+017F>lipt a Paper into his; in which he
found abundantly more than he expected, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
him in that, how he <U+017F>hou'd proceed,
in order to carry her off from her Father with
the lea<U+017F>t danger he cou'd look for in <U+017F>uch an
Attempt; <U+017F>ince it wou'd have been vain and
fruitle<U+017F>s to have ask'd her of her Father, becau<U+017F>e
their Families had been at enmity for <U+017F>everal
Years; though <hi>Antonio</hi> was as well de<U+017F>cended
as <U+017F>he, and had as ample a Fortune; nor was
his Per<U+017F>on, according to his Sex, any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to her's; and certainly, the Beauties of
his Mind were more excellent, e<U+017F>pecially if it be
an Excellence to be Con<U+017F>tant.</p>
                  <p>He had made <U+017F>everal Attempts to take po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
of her, but all prov'd ineffectual; however,
he had the good fortune not to be known, tho'
once or twice he narrowly '<U+017F>cap'd with Life,
bearing off his Wounds with difficulty.—(Alas,
that the Wounds of <hi>Love</hi> <U+017F>hou'd cau<U+017F>e
tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Hate!</hi>) Upon which <U+017F>he was <U+017F>trictly
confin'd to one Room, who<U+017F>e only Window
was towards the Garden, and that too was
Grated with Iron; and, once a Month, when
<U+017F>he went to Church, <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>tantly and
carefully attended by her Father, and a Mother-in-Law,
wor<U+017F>e than a <hi>Duegna.</hi> Under this
mi<U+017F>erable Confinement <hi>Antonio</hi> under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>he
<U+017F>till continu'd, at his return to <hi>Sevil</hi> with Don
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:267"/>
                     <hi>Henrique,</hi> whom he acquainted with his invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for her; lamenting the <U+017F>everity of
her pre<U+017F>ent circum<U+017F>tances, that admitted of no
pro<U+017F>pect of relief: which caus'd a generous
Concern in Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> both for the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Friend, and of the Lady: He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<U+017F>everal ways to Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea<U+017F>e
of the Fair Pri<U+017F>oner; but none of 'em was
thought practicable, or, at lea<U+017F>t, likely to <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
But <hi>Antonio,</hi> who (you may believe)
was then more nearly engag'd, bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
of an Expedient that wou'd undoubtedly
reward their Endeavours. 'Twas, That Don
<hi>Henrique,</hi> who was very well acquainted with
<hi>Ardelia's</hi> Father, <U+017F>hou'd make him a Vi<U+017F>it, with
pretence of begging his Con<U+017F>ent and Admi<U+017F><U+017F>ion
to make his Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to his Daughter; which,
in all probability, he cou'd not refu<U+017F>e to
Don <hi>Henrique</hi>'s Quality and E<U+017F>tate: And then
this freedom of acce<U+017F>s to her wou'd give him
the opportunity of delivering the Lady to his
Friend. This was thought <U+017F>o rea<U+017F>onable, that
the very next day it was put in practice; and
with <U+017F>o good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, that Don <hi>Henrique</hi> was
receiv'd by the Father of <hi>Ardelia</hi> with the
greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>pectful Ceremony imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
And when he made the Propo<U+017F>al to
him of Marrying his Daughter, it was embrac'd
with a vi<U+017F>ible Satisfaction and Joy in the Air of
his Face. This their fir<U+017F>t Conver<U+017F>ation ended
with all imaginable Content on both Sides;
Don <hi>Henrique</hi> being invited by the Father to
Dinner, the next day, when Donna <hi>Ardelia</hi>
was to be pre<U+017F>ent; who, at that time, was
<U+017F>aid to be indi<U+017F>pos'd, (as 'tis very probable <U+017F>he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:268"/>
was, with <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e an Impri<U+017F>onment.) <hi>Henrique</hi>
return'd to <hi>Antonio,</hi> and made him happy with
the Account of his Reception; which cou'd not
but have terminated in the perfect Felicity of
<hi>Antonio,</hi> had his Fate been ju<U+017F>t to the Merits of
his Love. The Day and Hour came which
brought <hi>Henrique</hi> with a private Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion
from his Friend to <hi>Ardelia.</hi> He <hi><U+017F>aw</hi> her;—(Ah!
wou'd he had only <U+017F>een her Veil'd!)
and, with the fir<U+017F>t opportunity, gave her the
Letter, which held <U+017F>o much Love and <U+017F>o much
Truth, as ought to have pre<U+017F>erv'd him in the
Empire of her Heart. It contain'd, be<U+017F>ides, a
Di<U+017F>covery of his whole De<U+017F>ign upon her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the compleating of their Happine<U+017F>s;
which nothing then cou'd ob<U+017F>truct but her <U+017F>elf.
But <hi>Henrique</hi> had <hi><U+017F>een</hi> her; he had <hi>gaz'd</hi> and
<U+017F>wallow'd all her Beauties at his Eyes. How
greedily his Soul drank the <U+017F>trong Poy<U+017F>on in!
But yet his Honour and his Friend<U+017F>hip were
<U+017F>trong as ever, and bravely fought again<U+017F>t the
U<U+017F>urper <hi>Love,</hi> and got a noble Victory, at lea<U+017F>t
he thought and wi<U+017F>h'd <U+017F>o. With this, and a
<U+017F>hort An<U+017F>wer to his Letter, <hi>Henrique</hi> return'd
to the Longing <hi>Antonio;</hi> who receiving the
Paper with the greate<U+017F>t Devotion, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing

Love, after <U+017F>o long an Ab<U+017F>ence. To which
his Friend reply'd, for her, That, doubtle<U+017F>s,
<U+017F>he had not Time enough to attempt <U+017F>o great a
Matter as a perfect Account of her Love; and
added, That it was Confirmation enough to
him of its continuance, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he Sub<U+017F>crib'd

Blind is Love! Don <hi>Henrique</hi> knew how to
make it bear another meaning; which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he had the Di<U+017F>cretion to conceal. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,</hi>
who was as Real in his Friend<U+017F>hip, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant

I know you <hi>do</hi> Love her. As I ought, I do,
(reply'd <hi>Henrique.</hi>) Yes, Yes, (return'd his
Friend,) it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o; otherwi<U+017F>e the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy

what you <U+017F>ay, is highly Generous, (reply'd
<hi>Henrique,</hi>) yet give me leave to urge, that
it looks like a Trial of your Friend, and
argues you inclinable to Jealou<U+017F>ie: But, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

appearing daily, tho' in Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e: For, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s,

Don <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian</hi> wou'd pur<U+017F>ue his Revenge
to the utmo<U+017F>t Extremity. The<U+017F>e Thoughts put
him upon de<U+017F>iring his Friend, for his own <U+017F>ake,
to ha<U+017F>ten the performance of his Attempt; and
accordingly, each day Don <hi>Henrique</hi> brought
<hi>Antonio</hi> the nearer hopes of Happine<U+017F>s, while
he him<U+017F>elf was hourly <U+017F>inking into the lowe<U+017F>t

Day in which <hi>Antonio</hi> expected to be ble<U+017F>s'd in
her Love, Don <hi>Henrique</hi> had a long and fatal
Conference with her, about his Liberty. Being
then with her alone in an Arbour of the Garden,
which Privilege he had had for <U+017F>ome days: After
a long <U+017F>ilence, and ob<U+017F>erving Don <hi>Henrique</hi> in
much di<U+017F>order, by the Motion of his Eyes,
which were <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>tedfa<U+017F>tly fix'd on the
Ground, then lifted up to her or Heaven, (for
he cou'd <U+017F>ee nothing more Beautiful on Earth,)
<U+017F>he made u<U+017F>e of the Privilege of her Sex, and
began the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t, to this effect;—Has
any thing happen'd, Sir, <U+017F>ince our retreat hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

your hitherto continu'd <U+017F>ilence? Speak, I
be<U+017F>eech you, Sir, and let me know if I have
any way unhappily contributed to it! No,
Madam, (reply'd he;) my Friend<U+017F>hip is now

Confidence which your noble Father has
plac'd in me: To morrow (added he, with a
pitious Sigh) I mu<U+017F>t deliver you into the Hands

my Friend; of my Friend, that Loves you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

my Friend, whom you Love more than any
Con<U+017F>ideration on Earth.—And <hi>must</hi> this be
done? (<U+017F>he ask'd.) Is it inevitable as Fate?—Fix'd
as the Laws of Nature, Madam, (reply'd

Does not your Love require it? Think! you

merit you, and whom only you can love.
Were your la<U+017F>t words true, (return'd <U+017F>he,) I
<U+017F>hou'd yet be unhappy in the Di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of a

in being the cau<U+017F>e of your Infidelity to him:
No, Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> (continu'd <U+017F>he;) I cou'd

tho<U+017F>e glorious Hopes with which you had
ble<U+017F>s'd my Soul, by ca<U+017F>ting me away from you
to <hi>Antonio!</hi>—Ha! (cry'd he, <U+017F>tarting,)
What <U+017F>aid you, Madam! What did <hi>Ardelia</hi>
<U+017F>ay! That I had ble<U+017F>s'd your Soul with Hopes!
That I wou'd <hi>cast you away to Antonio!</hi>—Can
they who <U+017F>afely arrive in their wi<U+017F>h'd for
Port, be <U+017F>aid to be Shipwrack'd! Or, Can an
Abject, Indigent Wretch make a King?—The<U+017F>e
are more than Riddles, Madam; and I
mu<U+017F>t not think to Expound 'em. No, (<U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he;) Let it alone, Don <hi>Henrique;</hi> I'll ea<U+017F>e
you of that trouble, and tell you plainly that
<hi>I Love you.</hi> Ah! (cry'd he,) now all my
Fears are come upon me!—How! (ask'd
<U+017F>he,) Were you <hi>afraid</hi> I <U+017F>hou'd Love you? Is
my Love <U+017F>o dreadful then? Yes, when mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd,
(reply'd he;) but 'twas your <hi>Fal<U+017F>hood</hi>
that I fear'd: Your Love were what I wou'd
have <U+017F>ought, with utmo<U+017F>t hazard of my Life;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47213:271"/>
nay, even of my Future Happine<U+017F>s, I fear, had
you not been Engag'd; <U+017F>trongly oblig'd to Love
el<U+017F>e where, both by your own Choice and Vows,
as well as by his dangerous Services, and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
Con<U+017F>tancy. For which (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I do
not <hi>Hate</hi> him; though his Father kill'd my
Uncle: Nay, perhaps (continu'd <U+017F>he) I have
a Friend<U+017F>hip for him, but no more. No <hi>more!</hi>
<U+017F>aid you, Madam? (cry'd he;)—But tell me,
Did you never Love him? Indeed, I did,
(reply'd <U+017F>he;) but the Sight of You, has better
in<U+017F>tructed me, both in my Duty to my Father,
and in cau<U+017F>ing my Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for you, without
whom I <U+017F>hall be eternally mi<U+017F>erable: Ah, then!
pur<U+017F>ue your honourable Propo<U+017F>al, and make
my Father happy in my Marriage! It mu<U+017F>t
not be, (return'd Don <hi>Henrique;</hi>) my <hi>Honour,</hi>
my <hi>Friend<U+017F>hip</hi> forbids it. No, (<U+017F>he return'd,)
your Honour requires it; and if your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip
oppo<U+017F>es your Honour, it can have no <U+017F>ure
nor <U+017F>olid Foundation. <hi>Female Sophi<U+017F>try!</hi> (cry'd
<hi>Henrique;</hi>) But you need no Art nor Artifice,
<hi>Ardelia,</hi> to make me Love you: <hi>Love you!</hi>
(pur<U+017F>u'd he;) By that bright <hi>Sun,</hi> the Light
and Heat of all the World, <hi>You</hi> are my only
Light and Heat.—Oh, <hi>Friend<U+017F>hip! Sacred
Friend<U+017F>hip,</hi> now a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me!—[Here for
a time he paus'd, and then afre<U+017F>h proceeded,]
thus,—You told me, or my Ears deceiv'd
me, that you Lov'd me, <hi>Ardelia.</hi> I did, (<U+017F>he
reply'd;) and that I do Love you, is as true
as that I told you <U+017F>o. 'Tis well;—But wou'd
it were not <U+017F>o! Did ever Man receive a Ble<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
<hi>thus!</hi>—Why, I cou'd wi<U+017F>h I did not
Love <hi>you, Ardelia!</hi> But that were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible—
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47213:271"/>
At lea<U+017F>t, <hi>unju<U+017F>t,</hi> (interrupted <U+017F>he.) Well then,
(he went on) to <U+017F>hew you that I do <U+017F>incerely
con<U+017F>ult your particular Happine<U+017F>s, without any
regard to my own, to morrow I will give you
to Don <hi>Antonio;</hi> and as a Proof of your Love
to me, I expect your ready Con<U+017F>ent to it. To
let you <U+017F>ee, Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> how perfectly and
tenderly I Love you, I will be <U+017F>acrific'd to
morrow to Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> and to your Quiet.
Oh, Strange<U+017F>t, Deare<U+017F>t Obligation! (cry'd
<hi>Henrique;</hi>) To morrow then, as I have told
your Father, I am to bring you to <U+017F>ee the
Deare<U+017F>t Friend I have on Earth, who dare not
appear within this City for <U+017F>ome unhappy Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons,
and therefore cannot be pre<U+017F>ent at our
Nuptials; for which cau<U+017F>e, I cou'd not but
think it my Duty to one <U+017F>o nearly related to
my Soul, to make him happy in the Sight of
my Beautiful Choice, e're yet <U+017F>he be my Bride.
I hope (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) my Loving Obedience may
merit your Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and that at la<U+017F>t, e're
the Fire is lighted that mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ume the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
I mean, the Marriage-Tapers, (alluding
to the old <hi>Roman</hi> Ceremony) that <hi>you,</hi> or <U+017F>ome
other pitying Angel, will <U+017F>natch me from the
Altar. Ah, No more, <hi>Ardelia!</hi> Say no more!
(cry'd he;) we mu<U+017F>t be <hi>Cruel,</hi> to be Ju<U+017F>t to
our <U+017F>elves. [Here their Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e ended, and
they walk'd into the Hou<U+017F>e, where they <U+017F>ound
the Good Old Gentleman and his Lady, with
whom he <U+017F>tay'd till about an Hour after Supper,
when he return'd to his Friend with joyful News,
but a <U+017F>orrowful Heart.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antonio</hi> was all Rapture with the Thoughts
of the approaching Day; which though it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47213:272"/>
brought Don <hi>Henrique</hi> and his Dear <hi>Ardelia</hi> to
him, about Five a clock in the Evening, yet at
the <U+017F>ame time brought his la<U+017F>t and greate<U+017F>t Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
He <U+017F>aw her then at a She-Relations of
his, about three Miles from <hi>Sevil,</hi> which was
the Place a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd for their fatal Interview. He
<hi><U+017F>aw</hi> her, I <U+017F>ay; but, Ah! how <U+017F>trange, how
alter'd from the Dear, Kind <hi>Ardelia</hi> <U+017F>he was
when la<U+017F>t he left her! 'Tis true, he flew to
her with Arms expanded, and with <U+017F>o <U+017F>wift
and eager a motion, that <U+017F>he cou'd not avoid
nor get loo<U+017F>e from his Embrace, till he had
<hi>ki<U+017F>s'd,</hi> and <hi><U+017F>igh'd,</hi> and <hi>dropt <U+017F>ome Tears,</hi> which
all the <U+017F>trength of his Mind cou'd not re<U+017F>train;
whether they were the effects of Joy, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(which rather may be fear'd) they were
the Heat-drops which preceded and threaten'd
the Thunder and Tempe<U+017F>t that <U+017F>hou'd fall on
his Head, I cannot po<U+017F>itively <U+017F>ay; yet all this
<U+017F>he was then <hi>forc'd</hi> to endure, e're <U+017F>he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to <U+017F>peak, or, indeed, to <hi>breathe.</hi> But
as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had freed her <U+017F>elf from the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Circle that <U+017F>hou'd have been the dear and
lov'd Confinement or Centre of a Faithful Heart,
<U+017F>he began to dart whole <U+017F>howers of Tortures
on him from her Eyes; which that Mouth that
he had but ju<U+017F>t before <U+017F>o tenderly and <U+017F>acredly
ki<U+017F>s'd, <U+017F>econded with whole volleys of Deaths
cramm'd in every Sentence, pointed with the
keene<U+017F>t Affliction that ever pierc'd a Soul!
<hi>Antonio,</hi> (<U+017F>he began) you have treated me now,
as if you were never like to <U+017F>ee me more; and
wou'd to Heav'n you were not!—Ha!
(cry'd he, <U+017F>tarting, and <U+017F>taring wildly on her;)
What <U+017F>aid you, Madam? What <U+017F>aid you, <hi>my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47213:272"/>
Ardelia?</hi> If you like the Repetition, Take it!
(reply'd <U+017F>he, unmov'd,) <hi>Wou'd to Heav'n you
were ne'er like to <U+017F>ee me more!</hi> Good! Very
Good! (cry'd he, with a Sigh that threw him
trembling into a Chair behind him, and gave
her the opportunity of proceeding thus,)—Yet,
<hi>Antonio,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t not have my Wi<U+017F>h; I mu<U+017F>t
continue with you, not out of Choice, but by
Command, by the <U+017F>tricte<U+017F>t and <U+017F>evere<U+017F>t Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
that ever bound Humanity; Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
your Friend, Commands it; Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
the Deare<U+017F>t Object of my Soul, Enjoins
it; Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> who<U+017F>e only Aver<U+017F>ion I am,
will have it <U+017F>o. Oh, Do not wrong me,
Madam! (cry'd Don <hi>Henrique.</hi>) Lead me,
Lead me a little more by the Light of your
Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I be<U+017F>eech you, (<U+017F>aid Don <hi>Antonio,</hi>)
that I may <U+017F>ee your Meaning! for hitherto 'tis
Darkne<U+017F>s all to me. Attend therefore with
your be<U+017F>t Faculties, (pur<U+017F>u'd <hi>Ardelia</hi>) and know,
That I do mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>incerely and mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately
Love Don <hi>Henrique;</hi> and as a Proof of my
Love to him, I have this Day con<U+017F>ented to be
deliver'd up to you by Him; not for your <U+017F>ake
in the lea<U+017F>t, <hi>Antonio,</hi> but purely to <U+017F>acrifice all
the Quiet of my Life to his Satisfaction. And
now, Sir, (continu'd <U+017F>he, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf
to Don <hi>Henrique,</hi>) Now, Sir, if you can be <U+017F>o
cruel; execute your own mo<U+017F>t dreaded Decree,
and join our Hands, though our Hearts ne'er
can meet. All this to Try me! It's too much,
<hi>Ardelia,</hi>—(<U+017F>aid <hi>Antonio:</hi>) And then turning
to Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> he went on, Speak <hi>Thou!</hi> if
yet thou'rt not Apo<U+017F>tate to our Friend<U+017F>hip!
Yet Speak, however! Speak, though the Devil
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47213:273"/>
has been Tampering with Thee too! Thou
art a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Man of Honour</hi> once. And
when I forfeit my ju<U+017F>t Title to <hi>that,</hi> (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> may I be made mo<U+017F>t mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erable!
—May I lo<U+017F>e the Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ings of thy
Friend<U+017F>hip!—May I lo<U+017F>e <hi>Thee!</hi>—Say
on then, <hi>Henrique!</hi> (cry'd <hi>Antonio;</hi>) And
I charge thee, by all the Sacred Tyes of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip,
<U+017F>ay, Is this a Trial of me? Is't Elu<U+017F>ion,
Sport? or <U+017F>hameful, murtherous Truth?—O!
my Soul burns within me, and I can bear
no longer!—Tell! Speak! Say on!—[Here,
with folded Arms, and Eyes fix'd <U+017F>ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa<U+017F>tly
on <hi>Henrique,</hi> he <U+017F>tood like a Statue,
without motion; unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ometimes, when his
<U+017F>welling Heart rais'd his o'er-charg'd Brea<U+017F>t.]
After a little Pau<U+017F>e, and a hearty Sigh or two,
<hi>Henrique</hi> began;—Oh, <hi>Antonio!</hi> O my
Friend! prepare thy <U+017F>elf to hear yet more
dreadful Accents!—I am (pur<U+017F>u'd he)
unhappily the Greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t Innocent Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
that e'er, till now, offended:—I
Love her, <hi>Antonio,</hi>—I Love <hi>Ardelia,</hi> with
a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>trong and violent as Thine!—Oh,
<U+017F>ummon all that us'd to be more than Man
about thee, to <U+017F>uffer to the end of my Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,
which nothing but a Re<U+017F>olution like
Thine can bear! I know it by my <U+017F>elf.—Though
there be Wounds, Horror and Death
in each Syllable, (interrupted <hi>Antonio,</hi>) yet
prithee, <hi>now,</hi> go on, but with all ha<U+017F>te. I will,
(return'd Don <hi>Henrique,</hi>) though I feel, my own
Words have the <U+017F>ame cruel effects on me. I <U+017F>ay
again, my <hi>Soul</hi> Loves <hi>Ardelia.</hi> And how can it
be otherwi<U+017F>e? Have we not Both the <U+017F>elf-<U+017F>ame

Appetites? the <U+017F>ame Di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ts? How then cou'd
I avoid my De<U+017F>tiny, that has decreed that I
<U+017F>hou'd Love and Hate ju<U+017F>t as you do? Oh,
hard Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity! that oblig'd you to u<U+017F>e Me, in
the Recovery of this Lady! Alas, Can you
think that any Man of Sen<U+017F>e or Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion cou'd
have <U+017F>een, and not have Lov'd her! Then
how <U+017F>hou'd I, who<U+017F>e Thoughts are Uni<U+017F>ons to
Yours, evade tho<U+017F>e Charms that had prevail'd
on you?—And now, to let you know 'tis
no Elu<U+017F>ion, no Sport, but <U+017F>erious and amazing
woful Truth, <hi>Ardelia</hi> be<U+017F>t can tell you whom
<U+017F>he Loves. What I've already <U+017F>aid, is true,
by Heav'n, (cry'd <U+017F>he;) 'Tis you, Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
whom I only Love, and who alone can
give me Happine<U+017F>s: Ah, wou'd you wou'd!
—With you, <hi>Antonio,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t remain Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
Wretched, Curs'd: Thou art my Hell;
Don <hi>Henrique</hi> is my Heaven. And Thou art
mine, (return'd he,) which here I part with to
my Deare<U+017F>t Friend. Then taking her Hand;
Pardon me, <hi>Antonio,</hi> (pur<U+017F>u'd he) that I thus take
my la<U+017F>t Farewell of all the Ta<U+017F>ts of Bli<U+017F>s from
your <hi>Ardelia,</hi> at this moment. [At which words
he ki<U+017F>s'd her Hand, and gave it to Don <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio;</hi>
who receiv'd it, and gently pre<U+017F>s'd it
clo<U+017F>e to his Heart, as if he wou'd have her feel

—Farewell to Both! (added he,
going out.) Ay, (cry'd <U+017F>he,) Farewell to all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47213:274"/>
Joys, Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ings, Happine<U+017F>s, if you for<U+017F>ake me
—Yet do not go!—Ah, Cruel! (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
<U+017F>he, <U+017F>eeing him quit the Room;) But
you <U+017F>hall take my Soul with you. Here <U+017F>he
<U+017F>wooned away in Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Arms; who,
though he was happy that he had her fa<U+017F>t there,
yet was oblig'd to call in his Cou<U+017F>in, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia</hi>'s
Attendants, e're <U+017F>he cou'd be perfectly
recover'd. In the mean while, Don <hi>Henrique</hi>
had not the power to go out of <U+017F>ight of the
Hou<U+017F>e, but wander'd to and fro about it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tracted
in his Soul, and not being able longer
to refrain her <U+017F>ight, her la<U+017F>t Words <U+017F>till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ounding
in her Ears, he came again into the
Room where he left her with Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> ju<U+017F>t
as <U+017F>he reviv'd and call'd upon him, exclaiming
on his Cruelty, in leaving her <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon. But
when, turning her Eyes towards the Door, <U+017F>he
<U+017F>aw him; Oh! with what eager ha<U+017F>te <U+017F>he flew
to him! then cla<U+017F>p'd him round the Wa<U+017F>t,
obliging him, with all the tender Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
that the Soul of a Lover, and a Woman's too,
is capable of uttering, not to leave her in the
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Don <hi>Antonio.</hi> This <U+017F>o amaz'd her
<U+017F>lighted Lover, that he knew not, at fir<U+017F>t, how
to proceed in this Tormenting Scene; but at
la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ummoning all his wonted Re<U+017F>olution,
and Strength of Mind, he told her, He wou'd
put her out of his power, if <U+017F>he wou'd con<U+017F>ent
to retreat for <U+017F>ome few hours to a Nunnery that
was not above half a Mile di<U+017F>tant thence, till
he had di<U+017F>cours'd his Friend, Don <hi>Henrique,</hi>
<U+017F>omething more particularly than hitherto,
about this Matter. To which <U+017F>he readily
agreed, upon the Promi<U+017F>e that Don <hi>Henrique</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47213:274"/>
made her, of <U+017F>eeing her with the fir<U+017F>t oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
They waited on her then to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
where <U+017F>he was kindly and re<U+017F>pectfully
receiv'd by the Lady Abbe<U+017F>s; but it was not long
before that her Grief renewing with greater
violence, and more afflicting circum<U+017F>tances,
had oblig'd 'em to <U+017F>tay with her till it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
dark, when they once more begg'd the
liberty of an hour's ab<U+017F>ence; and the better to
palliate their De<U+017F>ign, <hi>Henrique</hi> told her, that
he wou'd make u<U+017F>e of her Father Don <hi>Richardo</hi>'s
Coach, in which they came to Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s,
for <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a time: Which they did, leaving
only <hi>Eleanora</hi> her Attendant with her, without
whom <U+017F>he had been at a lo<U+017F>s, among <U+017F>o many
Fair Strangers; Strangers, I mean, to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Circum<U+017F>tances: whil<U+017F>t they were carry'd
near a Mile farther, where, ju<U+017F>t as 'twas dark,
they 'lighted from the Coach, Don <hi>Henrique</hi>
ordering the Servants not to <U+017F>tir thence till
their return from their private Walk, which
was about a Furlong, in a Field that belong'd
to the Convent. Here Don <hi>Antonio</hi> told Don
<hi>Henrique,</hi> That he had not acted Honourably;
That he had Betray'd him and Robb'd him at

t'other return'd, That he under<U+017F>tood his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when he propos'd a <hi>particular Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e</hi>
about this Affair, which he now perceiv'd mu<U+017F>t
end in Blood: But you may remind your <U+017F>elf
(continu'd he) that I have kept my Promi<U+017F>e,
in delivering her to you. Yes, (cry'd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi>)
after you had practis'd foully and ba<U+017F>ely
with her. By Heavens! not at all, (return'd
<hi>Henrique;</hi>) It was her Choice, or Fate, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47213:275"/>
brought this mi<U+017F>chief on her; for I urg'd the
Shame and Scandal of Incon<U+017F>tancy, but all in
vain, to her. But don't you Love her, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique?</hi>
(t'other ask'd.) Too well; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live without her, though I fear I may feel
the cur<U+017F>ed Effects of the <U+017F>ame Incon<U+017F>tancy:
However, I had quitted her All to you, but
you <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ents it. And you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee,
Sir, (cry'd <hi>Antonio,</hi> drawing his Sword in a
Rage) how I re<U+017F>ent it. Here, without more
Words, they fell to Action, to Bloody Action.
(Ah! how wretched is our Sex, in being the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>o many fatal Mi<U+017F>chiefs ev'n
between the Deare<U+017F>t Friends!) They fought on
each <U+017F>ide with the greate<U+017F>t Animo<U+017F>ity of Rivals,
forgetting all the Sacred Bonds of their former
Friend<U+017F>hip; till Don <hi>Antonio</hi> fell, and <U+017F>aid,
dying, <hi>Forgive me,</hi> Henrique! <hi>I was to blame;
I cou'd not live without her:—I fear <U+017F>he will
betray thy Life, which</hi> ha<U+017F>te <hi>and pre<U+017F>erve, for my
<U+017F>ake!—Let me not die all at once!—Heav'n
pardon both of us!—Farewell! Oh, Ha<U+017F>te!
Farewell!</hi> (return'd Don <hi>Henrique,) Farewell,
thou Bravest, Truest Friend! Farewell, thou
Noble<U+017F>t Part of me!—And, Farewell all the
Quiet of my Soul.</hi> Then <U+017F>tooping, he ki<U+017F>s'd his
Cheek; but, ri<U+017F>ing, found he mu<U+017F>t retire in
time, or el<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t peri<U+017F>h through lo<U+017F>s of Blood,
for he had receiv'd two or three dangerous
Wounds, be<U+017F>ides others of le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>equence:
wherefore he made all the convenient ha<U+017F>te he
cou'd to the Coach, into which, by the help of
the Foot-men, he got, and order'd 'em to drive
directly to Don <hi>Richardo</hi>'s with all imaginable
<U+017F>peed; where he arriv'd in little more than
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47213:275"/>
half an hour's time, and was receiv'd by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia</hi>'s
Father with the greate<U+017F>t Confu<U+017F>ion and
Amazement that is expre<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>eeing him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
without his Daughter, and <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perately
wounded. Before he thought it convenient to
ask him any Que<U+017F>tions more than to enquire of
his Daughter's <U+017F>afety, to which he receiv'd a
<U+017F>hort but <U+017F>atisfactory An<U+017F>wer, Don <hi>Richardo</hi> <U+017F>ent
for an Eminent and Able Surgeon, who prob'd
and dre<U+017F>s'd Don <hi>Henrique</hi>'s Wounds, who was
immediately put to Bed, not without <U+017F>ome
de<U+017F>pondency of his Recovery; but (Thanks
to his kind Stars, and kinder Con<U+017F>titution!)
he re<U+017F>ted pretty well for <U+017F>ome hours that Night;
and early in the Morning, <hi>Ardelia</hi>'s Father,
who had <U+017F>carce taken any Re<U+017F>t all that Night,
came to vi<U+017F>it him, as <U+017F>oon as he under<U+017F>tood
from the Servants who watch'd with him that
he was in a condition to <U+017F>uffer a <U+017F>hort Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e;
which, you may be <U+017F>ure, was to learn the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tances
of the pa<U+017F>t Night's Adventure; of
which Don <hi>Henrique</hi> gave him a perfect and
plea<U+017F>ant Account, <U+017F>ince he heard that Don <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,</hi>
his mortal Enemy, was kill'd; the a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of who<U+017F>e Death was the more delightful
to him, <U+017F>ince, by this Relation, he found that
<hi>Antonio</hi> was the Man whom his care of his
Daughter had <U+017F>o often fru<U+017F>trated. Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique</hi>
had hardly made an end of his Narration,
e're a Servant came ha<U+017F>tily to give <hi>Richardo</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the Officers were come to <U+017F>earch for
his Son-in-Law that <U+017F>hou'd have been; whom
the Old Gentleman's wi<U+017F>e Precaution had <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
in a Room <U+017F>o un<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, that they might
as rea<U+017F>onably have imagin'd the entire Walls
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47213:276"/>
of his Hou<U+017F>e had a Door made of Stones, as that
there <U+017F>hou'd have been one to that clo<U+017F>e Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
He went therefore boldly to the Officers,
and gave 'em all the Keys of his Hou<U+017F>e, with
free liberty to examine every Room and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
Which they did, but to no purpo<U+017F>e; and
Don <hi>Henrique</hi> lay there undi<U+017F>cover'd till his
Cure was perfected.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ardelia,</hi> who, that fatal
Night, but too rightly gue<U+017F>s'd that the Death
of one or both her Lovers was the cau<U+017F>e that
they did not return to their Promi<U+017F>e, the next
Day fell into a high Fever, in which her Father
found her, <U+017F>oon after he had clear'd him<U+017F>elf
of tho<U+017F>e who came to <U+017F>earch for her Lover.
The a<U+017F><U+017F>urance which her Father gave her of
<hi>Henrique</hi>'s Life <U+017F>eem'd a little to revive her;
but the <U+017F>everity of <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Fate was no way
obliging to her, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he cou'd not but retain
the memory of his Love and Con<U+017F>tancy; which
added to her Afflictions, and heightned her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper,
in<U+017F>omuch that <hi>Richardo</hi> was con<U+017F>train'd
to leave her under the care of the good Lady
Abbe<U+017F>s, and to the diligent Attendance of
<hi>Eleanora,</hi> not daring to hazard her Life in a
removal to his own Hou<U+017F>e. All their Care and
Diligence was however ineffectual; for <U+017F>he
langui<U+017F>h'd even to the lea<U+017F>t hope of Recovery,
till immediately after the fir<U+017F>t Vi<U+017F>it of Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
which was the fir<U+017F>t he made in a Month's
time, and that by Night, <hi>incognito,</hi> with her
Father, her Di<U+017F>temper vi<U+017F>ibly retreated each
day: yet when at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he enjoy'd a perfect
Health of Body, her Mind grew <U+017F>ick, and <U+017F>he
plung'd into a deep Melancholy; which made
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47213:276"/>
her entertain a po<U+017F>itive Re<U+017F>olution of taking
the Veil at the end of her Novitiate: which
accordingly <U+017F>he did, notwith<U+017F>tanding all the
Entreaties, Prayers and Tears both of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Lover. But <U+017F>he <U+017F>oon repented her
Vow, and often wi<U+017F>h'd that <U+017F>he might by any
means <U+017F>ee and <U+017F>peak to Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> by
who<U+017F>e help <U+017F>he promis'd to her <U+017F>elf a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
out of her voluntary Impri<U+017F>onment:
Nor were his Wi<U+017F>hes wanting to the <U+017F>ame effect,
though he was forc'd to flie into <hi>Italy,</hi> to avoid
the Pro<U+017F>ecution of <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Friends. Thither
<U+017F>he pur<U+017F>u'd him; nor cou'd he any way <U+017F>hun
her, unle<U+017F>s he cou'd have left his Heart at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
from his Body: Which made him take a
fatal Re<U+017F>olution of returning to <hi>Sevil</hi> in Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e;
where he wander'd about the Convent
every Night like a Gho<U+017F>t, (for indeed his Soul
was within, while his Inanimate Trunk was
without,) till at la<U+017F>t he found means to convey
a Letter to her, which both <U+017F>urpriz'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
her. The Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger that brought it
her, was one of her Mother-in-Laws Maids,
whom he had known before, and met acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
one night as he was going his Rounds,
and <U+017F>he coming out from <hi>Ardelia;</hi> with her he
prevail'd, and with Gold oblig'd her to Secrecy
and A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance: which prov'd <U+017F>o <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful, that
he under<U+017F>tood from <hi>Ardelia</hi> her <U+017F>trong de<U+017F>ire
of Liberty, and the continuance of her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
for him, together with the Means and Time
mo<U+017F>t convenient and likely to <U+017F>ucceed for her
Enlargement. The Time was the Fourteenth
Night following, at Twelve a clock, which
ju<U+017F>t compleated a Month <U+017F>ince his return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47213:277"/>
at which time they Both promis'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
the greate<U+017F>t Happine<U+017F>s on Earth. But
you may ob<U+017F>erve the ju<U+017F>tice of Heaven, in their
Di<U+017F>appointment.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian,</hi> who <U+017F>till pur<U+017F>u'd him with a
mo<U+017F>t implacable Hatred, had trac'd him even to
<hi>Italy,</hi> and there narrowly mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing him, po<U+017F>ted
after him to <hi>Toledo;</hi> <U+017F>o <U+017F>ure and <U+017F>ecret was his
Intelligence! As <U+017F>oon as he arriv'd, he went
directly to the Convent where his Si<U+017F>ter <hi>Elvira</hi>
had been one of the Profe<U+017F>s'd, ever <U+017F>ince Don
<hi>Henrique</hi> had for<U+017F>aken her, and where <hi>Ardelia</hi>
had taken her Repented Vow. <hi>Elvira</hi> had all
along conceal'd the Occa<U+017F>ion of her coming
thither from <hi>Ardelia;</hi> and though <U+017F>he was her
only Confident, and knew the whole Story of
her Misfortunes, and heard the Name of Don
<hi>Henrique</hi> repeated an hundred times a day,
whom <U+017F>till <U+017F>he Lov'd mo<U+017F>t perfectly, yet never
gave her Beautiful Rival any cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion
that <U+017F>he Lov'd him, either by Words or Looks:
nay, more, when <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood that Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique</hi>
came to the Convent with <hi>Ardelia</hi> and
<hi>Antonio,</hi> and at other times with her Father,
yet <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o great a command of her <U+017F>elf, as
to refrain <U+017F>eeing him, or to be <U+017F>een by him;
nor ever intended to have <U+017F>poken or writ to
him, had not her Brother, Don <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian,</hi> put
her upon the cruel nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of doing the la<U+017F>t;
who coming to vi<U+017F>it his Si<U+017F>ter (as I have <U+017F>aid
before) found her with Donna <hi>Ardelia,</hi> whom
he never remembred to have <U+017F>een, nor who
ever had <U+017F>een him but twice, and that was
about Six Years before, when <U+017F>he was but Ten
Years of Age, when <U+017F>he fell pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in Love
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47213:277"/>
with him, and continu'd her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion till about
the Fourteenth Year of her Empire, when the
unhappy <hi>Antonio</hi> fir<U+017F>t began his Court to her
Don <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian</hi> was really a very de<U+017F>irable Per<U+017F>on,
being at that time very Beautiful, his Age not
exceeding Six and twenty, of a <U+017F>weet Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ation,
very Brave, but Revengeful and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
(like mo<U+017F>t of his Countrey-men,)
and of an Honourable Family. At the <U+017F>ight of
him, <hi>Ardelia</hi> felt her former Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion renew;
which proceeded and continu'd with <U+017F>uch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that it utterly defac'd the Idea's of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi>
and <hi>Henrique.</hi> (No wonder that <U+017F>he who
cou'd re<U+017F>olve to for<U+017F>ake her God for Man,
<U+017F>hou'd quit one Lover for another.) In <U+017F>hort,
<U+017F>he then only wi<U+017F>h'd that he might Love her
equally, and then <U+017F>he doubted not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
the means of their Happine<U+017F>s betwixt
'em. She had her Wi<U+017F>h, and more, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible;
for he Lov'd her beyond the thought of any
other pre<U+017F>ent or future Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing, and fail'd not
to let her know it, at the <U+017F>econd Interview;
when he receiv'd the greate<U+017F>t Plea<U+017F>ure he cou'd
have wi<U+017F>h'd, next to the Joys of a Bridal Bed:
For <U+017F>he confe<U+017F>s'd her Love to him, and pre<U+017F>ently
put him upon thinking on the means of her
E<U+017F>cape; but not finding his De<U+017F>igns <U+017F>o likely to
<U+017F>ucceed, as tho<U+017F>e Mea<U+017F>ures <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ent to Don
<hi>Henrique,</hi> <U+017F>he communicates the very <U+017F>ame to
Don <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian,</hi> and agreed with him to make
u<U+017F>e of 'em on that very Night wherein <U+017F>he had
oblig'd Don <hi>Henrique</hi> to attempt her Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
the Hour indeed was different, being
determin'd to be at Eleven. <hi>Elvira,</hi> who was
pre<U+017F>ent at the Conference, took the Hint; and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47213:278"/>
not being willing to di<U+017F>oblige a Brother who had
<U+017F>o hazarded his Life in Vindication of her,
either dur<U+017F>t not or wou'd not <U+017F>eem to oppo<U+017F>e his
Inclinations, at that time: However, when he
retir'd with her to talk more particularly of
his intended Revenge on Don <hi>Henrique,</hi> who, he
told her, he knew lay <U+017F>omewhere ab<U+017F>conded in
<hi>Toledo,</hi> and whom he had re<U+017F>olv'd, as he a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ur'd
her, to <U+017F>acrifice to her injur'd Honour,
and his Re<U+017F>entments; <U+017F>he oppos'd that his vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
Re<U+017F>olution with all the forcible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in a Virtuous and Pious Lady's Capacity,
but in vain; <U+017F>o that immediately, upon his
retreat from the Convent, <U+017F>he took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of writing to Don <hi>Henrique</hi> as follows,

                  <p>The Dreadful Hour wanted not a Quarter

and having fix'd his Rope-Ladder to that part

<hi>Ardelia,</hi> who had not <U+017F>tir'd from that very

drawing his Sword, without one word, made
a furious Pa<U+017F>s at him; but his Rage and Ha<U+017F>te

<hi>Ah, my</hi> Ardelia, <hi>I come to thee now, (Seba<U+017F>tian</hi>

                  <head>THE
ADVENTURE
OF THE
Black Lady.</head>
                  <p>ABout the beginning of la<U+017F>t <hi>June</hi> (as
near as I can remember) <hi>Bellamora</hi>
came to Town from <hi>Hamp<U+017F>hire;</hi> and
was oblig'd to lodge the fir<U+017F>t Night
at the <U+017F>ame Inn where the Stage-Coach <U+017F>et up.
The next Day <U+017F>he took Coach for <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi>
where <U+017F>he thought to find Madam <hi>Brightly,</hi> a
Relation of her's; with whom <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ign'd to
continue for about half a Year undi<U+017F>cover'd, if
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, by her Friends in the Country: And
order'd therefore her Trunk, with her Cloaths,
and mo<U+017F>t of her Money and Jewels, to be brought
after her to Madam <hi>Brightly</hi>'s, by a <U+017F>trange Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke to in the Street as <U+017F>he was
taking Coach; being utterly unacquainted with
the neat Practices of this fine City. When <U+017F>he
came to <hi>Bridges-<U+017F>treet,</hi> where indeed her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>in
had lodged near three or four Years <U+017F>ince;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47213:282"/>
<U+017F>he was <U+017F>trangely <U+017F>urpriz'd that <U+017F>he cou'd not
learn any thing of her; no, nor <U+017F>o much as
meet with any one that had ever heard of her
Cou<U+017F>in's Name. Till, at la<U+017F>t, de<U+017F>cribing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Brightly</hi> to one of the Hou<U+017F>e-keepers in that
place, he told her, that there was <U+017F>uch a kind
of Lady, whom he had <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>een there
about a Year and a half ago; but that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
<U+017F>he was married and remov'd towards
<hi>So-ho.</hi> In this Perplexity <U+017F>he quite forgot her
Trunk and Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and wander'd in her
Hackney-Coach all over St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Pari<U+017F>h; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
for Madam <hi>Brightly,</hi> <U+017F>till de<U+017F>cribing her
Per<U+017F>on, but in vain; for no Soul cou'd give
her any Tale or Tidings of <U+017F>uch a Lady. After
<U+017F>he had thus fruitle<U+017F>ly rambled, till <U+017F>he, the
Coachman, and the very Hor<U+017F>es were e'en tir'd,
by good Fortune for her, <U+017F>he happen'd on a
private-Hou<U+017F>e, were lived a good, di<U+017F>creet,
ancient Gentlewoman, who was fallen a little
to decay, and was forc'd to let Lodgings for
the be<U+017F>t part of her Livelihood: From whom
<U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood, that there was <U+017F>uch a kind of
a Lady who had lain there <U+017F>omewhat more
than a Twelve-month, being near three Months
after <U+017F>he was married: But that <U+017F>he was now
gone abroad with the Gentleman her Husband;
either to the Play, or to take the fre<U+017F>h Air;
and <U+017F>he believ'd, wou'd not return till Night.
This Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the good Gentlewoman's <U+017F>o
elevated <hi>Bellamora</hi>'s drooping Spirits, that
after <U+017F>he had begg'd the Liberty of <U+017F>taying
there till they came home, <U+017F>he di<U+017F>charg'd
the Coachman in all ha<U+017F>te, <U+017F>till forgetting
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47213:282"/>
her Trunk, and the more valuable Furniture
of it.</p>
                  <p>When they were alone, <hi>Bellamora</hi> de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>he
might be permitted the Freedom to <U+017F>end for a
Pint of Sack; which, with <U+017F>ome little Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
was at la<U+017F>t allow'd her. They began
then to chat for a matter of half an hour of
things indifferent: And, at length the ancient
Gentlewoman ask'd the Fair Innocent (I mu<U+017F>t
not <U+017F>ay Fooli<U+017F>h) one, of what Country, and
what her Name was: To both which <U+017F>he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer'd
very <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>truly;</hi> tho' it might
have prov'd, not <hi>di<U+017F>creetly.</hi> She then inquir'd
of <hi>Bellamora</hi> if her Parents were living, and the
Occa<U+017F>ion of her coming to Town. The Fair
Unthinking Creature replied, That her Father
and Mother were both dead: And that <U+017F>he had
e<U+017F>cap'd from her Uncle, under pretence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Vi<U+017F>it to a young Lady, her Cou<U+017F>in who
was lately married, and liv'd above Twenty
Miles from her Uncle's in the Road to <hi>London;</hi>
and, that the Cau<U+017F>e of her quitting the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
was to avoid the hated Importunities of a
Gentleman, who<U+017F>e pretended Love to her <U+017F>he
fear'd had been her eternal Ruine. At which <U+017F>he
wept and <U+017F>igh'd mo<U+017F>t extravagantly. The di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Gentlewoman endeavour'd to comfort
her by all the <U+017F>ofte<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in her Capacity; promi<U+017F>ing her all the
friendly A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance that <U+017F>he cou'd expect from
her, during <hi>Bellamora</hi>'s <U+017F>tay in Town; which
<U+017F>he did with <U+017F>o much Earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s and vi<U+017F>ible
Integrity, that the pretty innocent Creature
was going to make her a full and real Di<U+017F>covery
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47213:283"/>
of her imaginary, in<U+017F>upportable Misfortunes;
and (doubtle<U+017F>s) had done it; had <U+017F>he not been
prevented by the Return of the Lady, whom
<U+017F>he hop'd to have found her Cou<U+017F>in <hi>Brightly.</hi>
The Gentleman her Husband ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Doors, and order'd the Coach to drive to
<U+017F>ome of his Bottle-Companions; which gave
the Women the better Opportunity of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
one another, which happen'd to be
with <U+017F>ome Surprize on all <U+017F>ides. As the Lady
was going up to her Apartment, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of the Hou<U+017F>e told her there was a young
Lady in the Parlour, who came out o' the
Country that very Day on purpo<U+017F>e to vi<U+017F>it her:
The Lady <U+017F>tept immediately to <U+017F>ee who it was,
and <hi>Bellamora</hi> approaching to receive her hop'd
for Cou<U+017F>in, <U+017F>topp'd on the the <U+017F>uddain ju<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he
came to her; and <U+017F>igh'd out aloud, Ah, Madam
I am lo<U+017F>t.—It is not your Lady<U+017F>hip I <U+017F>eek.
No, Madam (return'd t'other) I am apt to
think you did not intend me this Honour. But
you are as welcome to me, as you could be to the
deare<U+017F>t of your Acquaintance: Have you forgot
me, Madam <hi>Bellamora?</hi> (continued <U+017F>he) that
Name <U+017F>tartled both the other: However, It
was with a kind of Joy. Alas! Madam, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the young one) I now remember that I
have been <U+017F>o happy to have <U+017F>een you: But
where, and when, my Memory can't <U+017F>hew me.
'Tis indeed <U+017F>ome Years <U+017F>ince: (return'd the
Lady) But of that another time.—Mean
while, if you are unprovided of a Lodging, I dare
undertake, you <U+017F>hall be welcome to this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.
The Fair Unfortunate return'd her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47213:283"/>
Thanks; and whil<U+017F>t a Chamber was preparing
for her, the Lady entertain'd her in her own.
About Ten a Clock they parted, <hi>Bellamora</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conducted to her new Lodging by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
of the Hou<U+017F>e, who then left her to take
what Re<U+017F>t <U+017F>he cou'd amid<U+017F>t her <U+017F>o many <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Misfortunes; returning to the other Lady,
who de<U+017F>ir'd her to <U+017F>earch into the Cau<U+017F>e of
<hi>Bellamora</hi>'s Retreat to Town.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning the good Gentlewoman
of the Hou<U+017F>e coming up to her, found <hi>Bellamora</hi>
almo<U+017F>t drown'd in Tears, which by many kind
and <U+017F>weet Words <U+017F>he at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>topp'd; and asking
whence <U+017F>o great Signs of Sorrow <U+017F>hou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
vow'd a mo<U+017F>t profound Secrecy if <U+017F>he
wou'd di<U+017F>cover to her their Occa<U+017F>ion; which,
after <U+017F>ome little Reluctancy, <U+017F>he did, in this
manner:</p>
                  <p>I was courted (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) above three Years
ago, when my Mother was yet living, by one
Mr. <hi>Fondlove,</hi> a Gentleman of a good E<U+017F>tate, and
true Worth; and one who, I dare believe, did
then really love me: He continu'd his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
for me, with all the earne<U+017F>t and hone<U+017F>t Sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
imaginable, till <U+017F>ome Month's before my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Death; who at that time, was mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>irous
to <U+017F>ee me di<U+017F>pos'd of in Marriage to another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
of a much better E<U+017F>tate than Mr. <hi>Fond-love:</hi>
But one, who<U+017F>e Per<U+017F>on and Humour did
by no means hit with my Inclinations: And this
gave <hi>Fondlove</hi> the unhappy Advantage over me.
For, finding me one Day all alone in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and lying on my Bed, in as mournful and
wretched a Condition, to my <hi>then</hi> fooli<U+017F>h Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen<U+017F>ion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47213:284"/>
as <hi>now</hi> I am; He urg'd his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
with <U+017F>uch Violence and accur<U+017F>ed Succe<U+017F>s for
me, with reiterated Promi<U+017F>es of Marriage,
whenever I pleas'd to challenge 'em, which he
bound with the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>acred Oaths and mo<U+017F>t
dreadful Execrations; that partly with my
Aver<U+017F>ion to the other, and partly with my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to <hi>pity him,</hi> I <hi>ruin'd my <U+017F>elf.</hi>—Here
<U+017F>he relaps'd into a greater Extravagance of
Grief than before; which was <U+017F>o extreme,
that it did not continue long. When therefore,
<U+017F>he was pretty well come to her <U+017F>elf, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Gentlewoman ask'd her, why <U+017F>he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
her <U+017F>elf ruin'd? To which <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wer'd,
I am great with Child by him (Madam) and
wonder you did not perceive it la<U+017F>t Night.
Alas! I have not a Month to go: I am <U+017F>ham'd,
ruin'd, and damn'd, I fear, for ever lo<U+017F>t. O,
fie, Madam, think not <U+017F>o: (<U+017F>aid t'other) For
the Gentleman may yet prove true, and marry
you. Ay, Madam, (replied <hi>Bellamora</hi>) I doubt
not that he wou'd marry me; for, <U+017F>oon after
my Mother's Death, when I came to be at my
own Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al, which happen'd about two
Months after, he offer'd, nay, mo<U+017F>t earne<U+017F>tly
<U+017F>ollicited me to it, which <U+017F>till he per<U+017F>erveres to
do. This is <U+017F>trange! (return'd 'tother) And
it appears to me to be your own Fault, that
you are yet mi<U+017F>erable. Why did you not, or
why will you not con<U+017F>ent to your own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s?
Alas! alas! (cry'd <hi>Bellamora</hi>) 'Tis the
only thing I <hi>dread</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World: For, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
he can never love me after: Be<U+017F>ides, ever
<U+017F>ince, I have abhorr'd the Sight of him: And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47213:284"/>
this is the only Cau<U+017F>e that obliges me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ake
my Uncle, and all my Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Country, hoping this <hi>populous</hi> and
<hi>publick</hi> Place to be mo<U+017F>t <hi>private,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially, (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)
in your Hou<U+017F>e, and in your Fidelity and
Di<U+017F>cretion. Of the la<U+017F>t you may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your
<U+017F>elf, Madam, (<U+017F>aid t'other:) But what Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
have you made for the Reception of the
young Stranger that you carry about you. Ah,
Madam! (cry'd <hi>Bellamora</hi>) you have brought
to mind another Misfortune: Then <U+017F>he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
her with the <U+017F>uppos'd Lo<U+017F>s of her
Money and Jewels, telling her withal, that <U+017F>he
had but three Guinea's and <U+017F>ome Silver left, and
the Rings <U+017F>he wore, in her pre<U+017F>ent Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion.
The good Gentlewoman of the Hou<U+017F>e told her,
<U+017F>he wou'd <U+017F>end to inquire at the Inn where <U+017F>he
lay the fir<U+017F>t Night <U+017F>he came to Town; for,
(happily) they might give <U+017F>ome account of the
Porter to whom <U+017F>he had intru<U+017F>ted her Trunk;
and withal repeated her Promi<U+017F>e of all the
Help in her Power, and for that time left her
much more compos'd than <U+017F>he found her. The
good Gentlewoman went directly to the other
Lady, her Lodger, to whom <U+017F>he recounted
<hi>Bellamora</hi>'s mournful Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion: At which the
Lady appear'd mightily concern'd: And at
la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he told her Land-lady, that <U+017F>he wou'd
take Care that <hi>Bellamora</hi> <U+017F>hould lie in according
to her Quality: For, (added <U+017F>he) the Child (it

                  <p>A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had din'd, <U+017F>he went to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
and bought Child-bed Linen; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ir'd
that <hi>Bellamora</hi> might not have the lea<U+017F>t No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47213:285"/>
of it: And at her Return di<U+017F>patch'd a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to her Brother <hi>Fondlove</hi> in <hi>Hant<U+017F>hire,</hi> with
an Account of every particular; which <U+017F>oon
brought him up to Town, without <U+017F>atisfying
any of his or her Friends with the Rea<U+017F>on of
his <U+017F>udden Departure; mean while, the good
Gentlewoman of the Hou<U+017F>e had <U+017F>ent to the <hi>Star-Inn</hi>
on <hi>Fi<U+017F>h-<U+017F>treet-hill,</hi> to demand the Trunk;
which <U+017F>he rightly <U+017F>uppos'd to have been carried
back thither: For, by good Luck, it was a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that plyed thereabouts who brought it to
<hi>Bellamora</hi>'s Lodgings that very Night, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to her. <hi>Fondlove</hi> no <U+017F>ooner got to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
but he po<U+017F>ts to his Si<U+017F>ter's Lodgings,
where he was advis'd not to be <U+017F>een of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamora</hi>
till they had work'd farther upon her,
which the Land-Lady began in this manner;
<U+017F>he told her that her things were mi<U+017F>carried,
and <U+017F>he fear'd lo<U+017F>t; that <U+017F>he had but little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
her <U+017F>elf, and if the Over<U+017F>eers of the poor
(ju<U+017F>tly <U+017F>o call'd from their over-looking 'em)
<U+017F>hou'd have the lea<U+017F>t Su<U+017F>picion of a <U+017F>trange and
unmarried Per<U+017F>on, who was entertain'd in her
Hou<U+017F>e big with Child and <U+017F>o near her time as
<hi>Bellamora</hi> was, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd be troubled, if they
cou'd not give Security to the Pari<U+017F>h of twenty
or thirty Pound that they <U+017F>hou'd not <U+017F>uffer by
her, which <U+017F>he cou'd not; or otherwi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he
mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ent to the Hou<U+017F>e of Correction, and
her Child to a Pari<U+017F>h-Nur<U+017F>e. This Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
one may imagine, was very dreadful to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of her Youth, Beauty, Education, Family
and E<U+017F>tate: However, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olutely prote<U+017F>ted,
that <U+017F>he had rather undergo all this, than be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47213:285"/>
expos'd to the Scorn of her Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Country. The other told her then,
that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t write down to her Uncle a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
Letter, as if <U+017F>he were ju<U+017F>t going aboard
to <hi>Pacquet-boat</hi> for <hi>Holland;</hi> that he might not
<U+017F>end to inquire for her in Town, when he <U+017F>hou'd
under<U+017F>tand <U+017F>he was not at her new-married
Cou<U+017F>in's in the Country, which accordingly <U+017F>he
did, keeping her <U+017F>elf a clo<U+017F>e Pri<U+017F>oner to her
Chamber; where <U+017F>he was daily vi<U+017F>ited by <hi>Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi>'s
Si<U+017F>ter and the Land-Lady, but by no Soul
el<U+017F>e, the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F><U+017F>embling the Knowledge <U+017F>he
had of her Misfortunes. Thus <U+017F>he continued
for above three Weeks; not a Servant being
<U+017F>uffer'd to enter her Chamber, <U+017F>o much as to
make her Bed, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hou'd take Notice of
her great Belly: But for all this Caution, the
Secret had taken Wind, by the means of an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
of the other Lady below, who had
over-heard her <U+017F>peaking of it to her Husband.
This <U+017F>oon got out 'o Doors and <U+017F>pread abroad,
till it reach'd the long Ears of the Wolves
of the Pari<U+017F>h; who next day de<U+017F>ign'd to give
her an ungrateful Vi<U+017F>it: But <hi>Fondlove,</hi> by good
Providence, prevented it; who, the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
was u<U+017F>her'd into <hi>Bellamora</hi>'s Chamber by
his Si<U+017F>ter, his Brother-in-Law, and the Land-Lady.
At the <U+017F>ight of him <U+017F>he had like to have
<U+017F>woon'd away: But he taking her in his Arms,
began again, as he was wont to do, with Tears in
his Eyes, to beg that <U+017F>he wou'd marry him e'er
<U+017F>he was delivered; if not for his, nor her own,
yet for the Child's <U+017F>ake, which <U+017F>he hourly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
that it might not be born out of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47213:286"/>
and <U+017F>o be made uncapable of inheriting
either of their E<U+017F>tates; with a great many more
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing Arguments on all <U+017F>ides: To which at
la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented; and an hone<U+017F>t officious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
whom they had before provided, was
call'd up, who made an end of the Di<U+017F>pute:
So to Bed they went together that Night; and
next Day to the Exchange, for <U+017F>everal pretty
Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>es that Ladies in her Condition want.
Whil<U+017F>t they were abroad, came the Vermin
of the Pari<U+017F>h, (I mean, the Over<U+017F>eers of the
poor, who eat the Bread from 'em) to <U+017F>earch
for a young Black-hair'd Lady (for <U+017F>o was <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomora</hi>)
who was either brought to bed, or ju<U+017F>t
ready to lie down. The Land-Lady <U+017F>hew'd
'em all the Rooms in her Hou<U+017F>e, but no <U+017F>uch
Lady cou'd be found. At la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he bethought her
<U+017F>elf, and led 'em into her Parlour, where <U+017F>he
open'd a little Clo<U+017F>et-door, and <U+017F>hew'd 'em her
Black Cat that had ju<U+017F>t kitten'd; a<U+017F><U+017F>uring 'em,
that <hi><U+017F>he</hi> <U+017F>hou'd never trouble the Pari<U+017F>h as long
as <U+017F>he had Rats or Mice in the Hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o
di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s'd 'em like Logger-heads as they came.</p>
