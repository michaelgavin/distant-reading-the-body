            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with old in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Gentlemen, and young Sparks bred up in Armies, and whom that Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion had rendred Brutal, mo<U+017F>t of the Ladies were become le<U+017F>s mode<U+017F>t than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and <U+017F>eeing they <U+017F>hould have lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hed in Idlene<U+017F>s if they had not made Advances, or at lea<U+017F>t if they had been Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, a great many grew tender hearted, and <U+017F>ome very Confident.</p>
            <p>Of this la<U+017F>t Tribe was Madam <hi>d' Olonne:</hi> She had a round Face, a pretty No<U+017F>e, a little Mouth, fine <U+017F>parkling Eyes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Features, yet <U+017F>miling, which embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>hes mo<U+017F>t people, had in her a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect; her Hair was a bright brown, her Complexion admirable, her Neck, Hands and Arms were well made, her <U+017F>hape was not to be commended, nor would <U+017F>he have been thought Charming had it not been for her Face: This much her Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <U+017F>ay, That when <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t appeared at Court <U+017F>he had a hand<U+017F>ome Body; which is the u<U+017F>ual plea of tho<U+017F>e who would excu<U+017F>e Women who are too Corpulent.

him<U+017F>elf very happy in being freed from him. Wherefore to make him believe <U+017F>he was no longer concerned, <U+017F>he masked her<U+017F>elf four or five times with him, and being willing to regain entirely his Confidence by a great <U+017F>incerity, <U+017F>he not only confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed to him her love for the Duke, not only that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>uffered the Fort to be taken, but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of their Enjoyments: And as <U+017F>he <U+017F>pecified the number, <hi>He had but little love for you, Madam,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, in<U+017F>ulting the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the poor decea<U+017F>ed, <hi><U+017F>ince he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <U+017F>o <U+017F>eldom with <U+017F>o beautiful a Woman as you are.</hi>

            <p>She had left her Bed but a week, which <U+017F>he had kept above four, by rea<U+017F>on of a great hurt <U+017F>he had in her leg, when <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved to mask her<U+017F>elf. And this de<U+017F>ire advanced her Cure more then all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies <U+017F>he had u<U+017F>ed of a long time: So that <U+017F>he went in Ma<U+017F>querade four of five times with her Husband; but as the<U+017F>e were only little private Ma<U+017F>querades, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to have a great and famous One that might be talked of; and to that intent <U+017F>he, and three more, di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves like Capuchins, and cau<U+017F>ed two others of her Friends to be digui<U+017F>ed like Nuns: The Capuchins were <U+017F>he her<U+017F>elf, her Husband, <hi>Jarry,</hi> and the

Abbot <hi>de Viller<U+017F>eaux:</hi> The Nuns were my Lord <hi>Crofts</hi> an Engli<U+017F>hman, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>s <hi>de Sillery.</hi> This Troop run into all Companies on <hi>Shrove-Tue<U+017F>day</hi> Night.

            <p>During all the<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, <hi>Jeannin</hi> pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably enjoyed his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.

The Prince of <hi>Mar<U+017F>illac,</hi> who was young, to act the chiefe<U+017F>t part upon this Stage, had the greate<U+017F>t Lot, which was a Silver Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tern. <hi>Jeannin,</hi> with all the Favours he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; had only a Jewel of very <U+017F>mall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: The great Rumour that run of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of this Lottery, vexed him to <U+017F>ee that he was no better treated than the mo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61590:21"/>
He complained to Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne,</hi> <U+017F>he not thinking fit to acquaint him with her Roguery, received his Complaints very ill, in<U+017F>omuch that before they parted, they both fell to Reproaches, the one for his Money, the other for her Favours. The Conclu<U+017F>ion of which was, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s forbidding him her Hou<U+017F>e, and <hi>Jeannin</hi> told her that he had never obeyed her <U+017F>o wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly as he <U+017F>hould do in that Occa<U+017F>ion, and that this Command would <U+017F>ave him both Trouble and Expence.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Beuvron</hi>'s Commerce with her, la<U+017F>ted <U+017F>till; whether the Spark was not much in love, or that he thought him<U+017F>elf happy in having her Favours at any rate, he tormented her a little about her Behaviour, <U+017F>he al<U+017F>o treated as one <U+017F>he made u<U+017F>e of when others failed her, and her love for him was as little as nothing.</p>
            <p>Shortly after her falling out with <hi>Jeannin, Mar<U+017F>illac</hi> who had Friends who were much brisker than he was him<U+017F>elf, was advi<U+017F>ed by them to apply him<U+017F>elf to Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne,</hi> and told him that he was of an Age to make him<U+017F>elf talked of, that Women procured E<U+017F>teem as well as War, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being one of the greate<U+017F>t Beauties of the Court, be<U+017F>ides the great

In a word, he feared the <U+017F>ame things that a brisk Man would have de<U+017F>ired with all his heart.

This Di<U+017F>order helped to per<U+017F>wade her more then all he, or the Eloquence of his Friend could have <U+017F>aid to her: And it is for this rea<U+017F>on that Fools are more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than the Wi<U+017F>e in Love.</p>
            <p>The fir<U+017F>t thing that <hi>Mar<U+017F>illac</hi> did after being <U+017F>eated, was putting on his Hat, <U+017F>o little was he him<U+017F>elf; an in<U+017F>tant after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his folly, he took off his Hat and Gloves, then put on one again, and all this without <U+017F>aying a Word. <hi>What's the matter, Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid Madam <hi>d' Olonne, you <U+017F>eem to be concerned at <U+017F>omething.

Love you as long as I live,</hi> <U+017F>aid he. <hi>Well,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>love me as long as you plea<U+017F>e and hope.</hi> This had been <U+017F>ufficient for a more pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing Gallant than <hi>Mar<U+017F>illac</hi> to have pretended to enjoyment immediately; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding all that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> could do, he made her wait two Months, and at length, when they came to the point, <U+017F>he was forced to make all the Advances. The e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing: this new Commerce did not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61590:24"/>
make her break that <U+017F>he had with <hi>Beuvron:</hi> The la<U+017F>t Lover was ever the mo<U+017F>t beloved, but he was not <U+017F>o much in her Favour as to drive away <hi>Beuvron,</hi> who was a <U+017F>econd Husband to her.</p>
            <p>A little before the Repture of <hi>Jeannin</hi> with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> the Chevalier of <hi>Grammont</hi> was fallen in love with her, and he being a very extraordinary Per<U+017F>on, it is fit I give a De<U+017F>cription of him.</p>
            <p>The Chevalier had brisk Eyes, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome No<U+017F>e, a pretty Mouth, a dimple in his Chin, and I know not what of <U+017F>ine in his Phi<U+017F>iognomy, his Shape had been comely, had he not <U+017F>tooped, his Wit was delicate and gallant. However, his Meen and his Accent gave a Grace to what he <U+017F>aid, that became nothing in the Mouth of another. A mark of this is that he writ the wor<U+017F>t of any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and he writ as he <U+017F>poke. Though it be <U+017F>uperfluous to <U+017F>ay that a Rival is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode, the Chevalier was to that point, that it would have been better for a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be troubled with four others then he alone. He was <U+017F>o <U+017F>prightly that he hardly ever <U+017F>lept, he was liberal to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion, and by that means his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s and his Rivals could not have Servants nor Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets but what he knew, otherwi<U+017F>e the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61590:24"/>
be<U+017F>t Man in the World. It was twelve years <U+017F>ince he began to love the Counte<U+017F>s of <hi>Fie<U+017F>que,</hi> a Woman as extraordinary as he was a Man, that is to <U+017F>ay, as <U+017F>ingular in Merits as he was in ill Qualities; but as of tho<U+017F>e twelve years <U+017F>he had been bani<U+017F>hed, five from Mademoi<U+017F>elle <hi>d' Orleans, Ga<U+017F>ton</hi>'s of <hi>France</hi>'s Daughter, a Prince<U+017F>s whom Fortune per<U+017F>ecuted, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and could not reduce her great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to the ba<U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>es that the Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. During their ab<U+017F>ence the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier had tied him<U+017F>elf to a very regular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy; and tho the Counte<U+017F>s was very lovely, he merited <U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>e for his Lightne<U+017F>s, being he had never received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favour from her. He had however cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed <U+017F>everal to be jealous; <hi>Rouville</hi> was one of tho<U+017F>e who were <U+017F>o: As he was one day reproaching the Counte<U+017F>s that <U+017F>he loved the Chevalier, that fair One told him that he was mad to believe <U+017F>he could love the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Cheat in the World. <hi>This is a plea<U+017F>ant rea<U+017F>on, Madam, which you alledge, I know you are a greater Cheat than he, and yet I cannot forbear loving you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho the Chevalier was in love with all Women, the Counte<U+017F>s however had that power over him, that what engagement
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61590:25"/>
<U+017F>oever he had el<U+017F>ewhere, <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as he knew that any One vi<U+017F>ited her oftner that ordinary, he quitted all to return to her: And he was in the Right, for the Counte<U+017F>s was a lovely Woman, <U+017F>he had blew and <U+017F>parkling Eyes, a hand<U+017F>ome No<U+017F>e, an agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mouth, of a fine Colour, and white and <U+017F>mooth Skin; the forme of her Face was long, and never any One but <U+017F>he in the world was embeli<U+017F>hed with a long Chin; her hair was brown, and <U+017F>he was ever Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly dre<U+017F>t, but her finery proceeded rather from Art than the magnificence of her Clothes; her Will was free and naturall, her Humour cannot be de<U+017F>cribed, for it was with the Mode<U+017F>ty of her Sex of the Humour of all the World. People by much think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what they have to do, think u<U+017F>ually better at the end than at the beginning. The contrary happened u<U+017F>ually to the Counte<U+017F>s, her Reflections <U+017F>poyled her fir<U+017F>t Motions. I know not if the Confidence <U+017F>he had in her Merit made her carele<U+017F>s of <U+017F>eeking Lovers, for <U+017F>he took no pains at all to have them. And indeed when any One of him<U+017F>elf made his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to her, <U+017F>he neither affected Rigour to be rid of him, nor Kindne<U+017F>s to retain him, he left of his Court<U+017F>hip if he plea<U+017F>ed, if he plea<U+017F>ed he

So that the Chevalier as I have <U+017F>aid, had not vi<U+017F>ited her in five years time, and during that ab<U+017F>ence that he might not lo<U+017F>e time he had had a thou<U+017F>and Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, among<U+017F>t others <hi>Victoria Manciri,</hi> Duche<U+017F>s of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeur,</hi> and three dayes after her Death, Madam <hi>de Villars,</hi> and it was for this rea<U+017F>on that <hi>Ben<U+017F>erade,</hi> who was in love with her, made this Sonnet upon the Chevalier.</p>

in this <U+017F>tory, that it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to <U+017F>peak of them <hi>en pa<U+017F><U+017F>ant,</hi> and make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known; and in order to that it is fit I begin with the de<U+017F>cription of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>The count <hi>de Guiche</hi> had great black Eyes, a hand<U+017F>ome No<U+017F>e, well made, his Mouth was <U+017F>omething wide, the forme of his Face round, his Complexion was admirable, had a great Forehead and a fine Shape: he had Wit, was very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, addicted to raillery, light, pre<U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, brave, ha<U+017F>ty and without friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip: he was Colonel of the French Gards, jointly with the Mare<U+017F>chal of <hi>Grammom</hi> his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manicamp</hi> had <U+017F>weet blew Eyes, a Hawk's No<U+017F>e, a wide Mouth, his Lips were very red and full, his Complexion was <U+017F>omething yellow, his Face was flat, his Haire thick long and white, his Shape was fine if it had not been too much neglected: As for Wit <U+017F>he had enough of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s <U+017F>ort; he had not acquired <U+017F>o much, but his <hi>Genius</hi> way at lea<U+017F>t as good; his Fortune not being <U+017F>o well <U+017F>etled as the others, made him <U+017F>omething the more cautious; but they had naturally both the <U+017F>ame incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to the hinder parts and to raillery;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61590:29"/>
and indeed they loved one another as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently as if they had been of different Sexes.</p>
            <p>At the <U+017F>ame time Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> <U+017F>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the World the Chevalier <hi>de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s Letter, he di<U+017F>covered the love the Count <hi>de Guicke</hi> had for the Counte<U+017F>s of <hi>Fie<U+017F>que,</hi> this was of no <U+017F>mall u<U+017F>e to him for the making her fall out with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> fancying his Reconciliation would be the more ea<U+017F>y with the Counte<U+017F>s, the le<U+017F>s he kept mea<U+017F>ures with the others: but while he is endeavouring to make Peace for him<U+017F>elf, let us <U+017F>e what the Count <hi>de Guicke</hi> did to render him<U+017F>elf lovely. Fir<U+017F>t you mu<U+017F>t know then that the Count had a very great pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for Mademoi<U+017F>elle <hi>de Beauvais,</hi> a Maid of mean Birth, but of a great deal of Wit; it mu<U+017F>t likewi<U+017F>e be known that he had been <U+017F>o traver<U+017F>ed by his Relations in that Amour, that they feared <U+017F>he would make him commit the <U+017F>ame folly, that his Si<U+017F>ter had cau<U+017F>ed the Marque<U+017F>s of <hi>Richilieu</hi> to do, whom that Con<U+017F>ideration, as well as the Rigours of the faire One, had very much di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ted, and had the deeper engaged him in the de<U+017F>ign of Loving the Counte<U+017F>s; but he had not for this fair One, all the inclination <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erved, and it was le<U+017F>s a <U+017F>econd pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion than a Remedy to the

former. But he got little ground, &amp; all that he could do was to move the Counte<U+017F>s and to put the Chevalier into di<U+017F>pair; and for that end he kept to Lookes and A<U+017F><U+017F>iduities, without caring to <U+017F>pur on fa<U+017F>ter. The Counte<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e heart, as is beleived, was never <U+017F>mitten with any thing but the merit of <hi>Gui<U+017F>tand,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, whom <U+017F>he had not <U+017F>een in four or five years, but with whom <U+017F>he had kept a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Letters, felt her Con<U+017F>tancy <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Count <hi>de Guiches</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and notwith<U+017F>tanding all that <hi>Ger<U+017F>é, Gui<U+017F>tavel</hi>'s friend, could <U+017F>ay to her, for the obliging her to chace away the Count, <U+017F>he would not at fir<U+017F>t yeild to it, but <U+017F>eemed to ridicule that Amour, and a long time elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Coun<U+017F>els of all her friends: yet at length <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf perceiving that the Count took no advantage of it, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to procure her <U+017F>elf honour by making a Virtue of the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>he beleived her <U+017F>elf in of loving her, and that this might not <U+017F>eem a Sacrifice to the Chevalier, who had bragged he could cau<U+017F>e his Nephew to be Ca<U+017F>hiered, <U+017F>he turned them both off, yeilding at that time to the advi<U+017F>e of <hi>Ger<U+017F>é,</hi> as <U+017F>he told him; and hereupon was made this jea<U+017F>t, that the Counte<U+017F>s was

            <p>Five or <U+017F>ix Months being pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, during which the Chevalier was too happy, he was not troubled with his Nephew, had enjoyed the plea<U+017F>ures of <U+017F>olely loving the Counte<U+017F>s; <U+017F>ome friends of the Count <hi>de Gutche</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented to him that being the hand<U+017F>ome<U+017F>t Man of the Court, it was a <U+017F>hame for him to find any Lady cruel, and that the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s he had had with the Counte<U+017F>s had done him any injury in the world: the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons made him re<U+017F>olve to reingage him<U+017F>elf: He returned from he Campagne wounded in his Right Hand, but his Wound, tho great, not

having hindred him from going abroad <U+017F>ome times, he met the Counte<U+017F>s One day in the <hi>Tuilleryes:</hi> He had the Abbot <hi>Fouequett</hi> with him, who was that Lady's particular friend, who thinking to do them a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure, engaged them in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and left them together a pretty long time. The Count <U+017F>aid nothing at all of love, but his ways and his looks made the Counte<U+017F>s under<U+017F>tand but too much, nay more than he de<U+017F>igned <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould: This Conver<U+017F>ation was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ended by the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s <U+017F>ainting away, out of which he was recovered by the help of the Counte<U+017F>s and the Abbot.</p>
            <p>Their Opinion of the cau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>aint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away were divers, the Abbot attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to the Counts wound, and the Counte<U+017F>s to his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. A Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves nothing more willingly than that <U+017F>he is beloved, becau<U+017F>e Love makes her beleive that <U+017F>he ought to be beloved, and becau<U+017F>e One is not hard to be per<U+017F>waded of what One de<U+017F>ires. The<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons made the Counte<U+017F>s not at all doubt of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Love.

            </p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t you mu<U+017F>t know Madam, that there are three <U+017F>orts of Women who make love, The Debauchées, the Cocquets, and the hone<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es. Tho the fir<U+017F>t are abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, they certainly de<U+017F>erve more compa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than hatred, becau<U+017F>e they are hurryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the force of their Temper, and that almo<U+017F>t an impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible application is required to reforme Nature; however if in any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter we ought to conquer our <U+017F>elves, it is in that, wherein no le<U+017F>s is concerned than our honours or lives.</p>
            <p>As for Cocquets, the number being much greater, I <U+017F>hall enlarge more upon that point: The difference between De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchées, and them, is, that in the Ill the former commit, there is at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>incerity, and in what the Cocquets do there is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery: The Cocquets tell us to excu<U+017F>e
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61590:40"/>
them<U+017F>elves when they give ear to the Court<U+017F>hip of all Comers, that how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t <U+017F>oever a Woman is, <U+017F>he never hates a per<U+017F>on who tells her he loves her.</p>
            <p>But one may an<U+017F>wer them that di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are to be made: either that Lover addre<U+017F><U+017F>es him<U+017F>elf to a Woman, who will be either hone<U+017F>t for her <U+017F>elf or for a Lover: allow that <U+017F>he cannot hate a Man for the Sentiments he had for her, yet this will not hinder her from being carefull of not having <U+017F>o much Complai<U+017F>ance for him as for another, who had never declared any thing to her, for fear <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould thereby entertain his hopes, and that at length it might make a noi<U+017F>e, and be injurious to the reputation <U+017F>he would pre<U+017F>erve.</p>
            <p>If the Woman be prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed that the Man declares love to her, <U+017F>he will have the <U+017F>ame precautions as the other to hinder it from continuing, but if he per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts, I maintain that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall hate him as much as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall love her true Gallant: it being natural to hate the Enemies of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on we love, becau<U+017F>e love will not allow love to be importunate, and becau<U+017F>e that a Lover well treated may <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion that continues in his Rival, is at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lea<U+017F>t nouri<U+017F>hed by <U+017F>ome hopes; an hone<U+017F>t

Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s con<U+017F>iders his Rival as her mortal Enemy, who maks her run the ri<U+017F>que of lo<U+017F>ing her Lover whom <U+017F>he loves more than her life. This being plain, you mu<U+017F>t likewi<U+017F>e know that there are <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of Cocquets; <U+017F>ome take a pride in being beloved by a great many People, without ever loving any of them, and do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it is the advances them<U+017F>elves make which invite men, and which retain them rather than merit. Be<U+017F>ides as it is not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible they <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <U+017F>o equally, but that <U+017F>ome one will <U+017F>eem better treated than others, and there being <U+017F>ome who will not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves with equality, but pretend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; This gives jealou<U+017F>y to the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, and makes them <U+017F>ay in quitting them, all, nay more than they know.</p>
            <p>There are other Cocquets who manage <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lovers, that they may <U+017F>ave the real one in the multitude, and cau<U+017F>e it to be <U+017F>aid, they have no amorous Intrigue, <U+017F>ince they treat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually all tho<U+017F>e who vi<U+017F>it them; but the be<U+017F>t luck that can happen to them is to have the truth di<U+017F>covered; or at lea<U+017F>t, it is better than by believing they love no Body, every one <U+017F>ancies they love All.</p>
            <p>There are others who by managing <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

Gallants would fain per<U+017F>wade, that if they <U+017F>hould love any one of them, they <U+017F>hould hazard the vexing him, In the mean time they vex and lo<U+017F>e him by the<U+017F>e means. For to imagine that it is in the ab<U+017F>ence of their true Lover that they make love, he will know nothing of it; or if it is in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence, by acting in concert together, he will ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee that is nothing, <U+017F>ince he is taken for a Witne<U+017F>s of what is done, or at all hazards if he is troubled, their Care<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing him, and their Promi<U+017F>es to do <U+017F>o no more, will oblige him to be <U+017F>atisfied. All this is very <U+017F>ubject to caution, a Lover is not long deceived, and if he does not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it to day, he will di<U+017F>cover it to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>

            <p>As for them, they are either <U+017F>atisfied with their Lovers, or they are not: If they are not, they endeavour to reduce them to their Devoir by a tender and civil Carriage: If this cannot ab<U+017F>olutely be, they break off without noi<U+017F>e, upon a pretext of Devotion, or the Jealou<U+017F>ie of a Husband, after having got from them, if they can, their Letters, and all that could Convict them: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things they <U+017F>o contrive it, that their Lovers do not fancy they abandom them for others.</p>
            <p>If they are <U+017F>atisfied with their Lovers, they love them with all their hearts, they are continually telling it them, and they write them the kinde<U+017F>t Letters they can: But as this does not prove their love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e Coquets <U+017F>ay as much, or more every day, their Actions and their Carriage does <U+017F>ufficiently ju<U+017F>tifie the meaning of their Hearts, becau<U+017F>e there is only that in<U+017F>allible.

            <p>In a word, her Maxim is, That who gives her heart has nothing more to manage; <U+017F>he knows that there are only two Encounters that can di<U+017F>pence her from telling all to her Lover; the one if he was indi<U+017F>creet, and the other if he had any Gallantry before hers.

I even find therein <U+017F>ome inju<U+017F>tice; for in a word, <U+017F>ince we even deceive our Husbands, whom the Laws have made our Ma<U+017F>ters, why <U+017F>hould our Gallants come off at a better rate? They whom nothing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to love but the choice we make, and whom we take to <U+017F>erve us as long, and as little as we plea<U+017F>e. I did not <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mademoi<U+017F>elle <hi>de Cornuelle,</hi> that we ought not to abandon our Gallants, when they di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e us either by their own defects, or our wearine<U+017F>s; but I have <U+017F>hown you the nice manner by which you ought to di<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your <U+017F>elf from them, not to give them any rea<U+017F>on to cry out upon you in the world: For in a word, Madam, <U+017F>ince they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed that tyranny upon the Honour of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, not to love what they find lovely, we mu<U+017F>t comply with Cu<U+017F>tome, and conceal our <U+017F>elves at lea<U+017F>t when we will love. Well! my Dear, <U+017F>aid Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> to her, I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61590:44"/>
am going to act wonders, I am fully re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it, but withal I ground the greate<U+017F>t hopes of my Conduct upon avoiding Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions.</p>
            <p>Whether it be by avoiding, or re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, <U+017F>aid Mademoi<U+017F>elle <hi>de Cornuelle,</hi> it is no matter, provided your Lover be <U+017F>atisfied with you; and thereupon having exhorted her to remain firm in her good Intentions, <U+017F>he took her leave.</p>
            <p>During Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s <U+017F>eparation from <hi>Mar<U+017F>illac,</hi> they wrote to one another very often, but as there was nothing therein remarkable, I <U+017F>hall not mention their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which <U+017F>poke of their love, and of their impatience to <U+017F>ee one another again, but in a very common manner. Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t who returned to <hi>Paris;</hi> the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> during the Progre<U+017F>s to <hi>Lyons,</hi> per<U+017F>waded <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur,</hi> the King's Brother, with whom he was much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to have a Gallantry at his return to <hi>Paris</hi> with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>erve him in it, and to procure him content in a <U+017F>hort time. This Prince had promi<U+017F>ed the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to make the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Paces to engage that Cocquet, in<U+017F>omuch that in the Conver<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61590:45"/>
<U+017F>poke to her of the love that Prince had for her: He told her that he had declared it to him more than an hundred times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Journey, and that <U+017F>he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <U+017F>ee him <U+017F>igh a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A Woman who had Citizens and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen her Gallants, <U+017F>ome hand<U+017F>ome, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ugly, might well love a comely Prince, Madam <hi>a' Olonne</hi> received the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Propo<U+017F>ition with an unexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible joy; and it was <U+017F>o great, that <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>o much as make tho<U+017F>e Excu<U+017F>es which Coquets make in <U+017F>uch like Encounters. Another would have <U+017F>aid that <U+017F>he would not love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, but le<U+017F>s a Prince than any man <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, becau<U+017F>e he would not have <U+017F>o much application. Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> who was the mo<U+017F>t natural Woman in the World, and the mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate, kept no bounds of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>ty, but an<U+017F>wered the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> That <U+017F>he e<U+017F>teemed her<U+017F>elf more than <U+017F>he had yet done, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o great and <U+017F>o rational a Prince. When the Court was returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> did not an<U+017F>wer the eagerne<U+017F><U+017F>es, the Count had prepared Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> for, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her<U+017F>elf all entirely. All this produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced nothing, and made her but the more know how indifferent <U+017F>he was to that

Prince. The Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> <U+017F>eeing that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> did not bite at the Hook, changed his De<U+017F>ign, and was de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous at lea<U+017F>t that the Services he would have rendred to Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> <U+017F>hould be of <U+017F>ome advantage to him. Whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved to act the part of a Lover him<U+017F>elf, and being the Commerce he had had with her upon the Amours of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> had made him very familiar, he did not balance to write to her this Letter.</p>

                  <p>WE have laboured hitherto in vain, Madam, the Queen haters you, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> apprehends di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing her, I have rea<U+017F>on to be in de<U+017F>pair, Madam, but you can comfort me if you plea<U+017F>e, and I do Conjure you to do it, <U+017F>ince the natural <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of the Mother, and the weakne<U+017F>s of the Son, have ruined our Projects, other Mea<U+017F>ures are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Let us love one another, Madam, it is already done on my part; and I ea<U+017F>ily perceive, that had the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you, I <U+017F>hould quickly have fallen out with him, becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould not have been able to have re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted the inclination I have for you. I do not que<U+017F>tion but that at fir<U+017F>t you will be <U+017F>hocked at the difference,

but lay a<U+017F>ide your Ambition, and you will not find your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. I am certain that when Spight <U+017F>hall have ca<U+017F>t you into my Arms, Love will there retain you.</p>

            <p>Let People <U+017F>ay what they will again<U+017F>t Women, there is <U+017F>ometimes more impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than malice in their Conduct: Mo<U+017F>t of them no longer think, when they are courted, that they ought never to love: In the mean time they proceed further than they imagine, they do things <U+017F>ometimes, thinking they <U+017F>hall be always Cruel, which they extreamly repent of, when they are become more Humane. The <U+017F>ame thing happened to Madam <hi>d' Olonne;</hi> <U+017F>he was <U+017F>tung to the quick that <U+017F>he had failed of the Prince's Heart, after having reckoned it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t her Conque<U+017F>ts; in <U+017F>eeking <U+017F>ome one to apply her<U+017F>elf to for the amu<U+017F>ing her grief, <U+017F>he found nothing more likely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, than that the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> for his own Intere<U+017F>t had hindred him from loving her. In<U+017F>omuch that as well to revenge her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf of him, as to rea<U+017F><U+017F>ure <hi>Mar<U+017F>illac,</hi> whom this Intrigue had alarmed, <U+017F>he <U+017F>acrificed to him the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Letter, without con<U+017F>idering that Love would perhaps ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61590:46"/>
her to do the <U+017F>ame with tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>illac,</hi> and he whom Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> gave a thou<U+017F>and Favours to, made the u<U+017F>e of them that is common, when one is <U+017F>atisfied with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, he rendred her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and thanks for her Sincerity, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him<U+017F>elf with triumphing over his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, without <U+017F>howing any indi<U+017F>creet Pride.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> not knowing the De<U+017F>tiny of his Letter, went the day after to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Hou<U+017F>e; but <U+017F>o much Company was there that day, that he could not <U+017F>peak to her about bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s at that time. He only ob<U+017F>erved that <U+017F>he had eyed him very much, and from her Hou<U+017F>e he went to acquaint <hi>Fie<U+017F>que</hi> with the <U+017F>tate of his Affairs, who <U+017F>ince his return from <hi>Lyons,</hi> he had made his Con<U+017F>ident; he went likewi<U+017F>e to tell the <U+017F>ame to <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> and they both judged by the weakne<U+017F>s of the Lady, and the Gentlene<U+017F>s of the Spark, that his pur<U+017F>uit would neither be long nor in vain: And the truth is, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> had found the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>ome, and <U+017F>o much to her mind, that <U+017F>he repented the Sacrifice <U+017F>he had newly made to <hi>Mar<U+017F>illac.</hi> The day after the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> returned to her Hou<U+017F>e, and

having found her alone, he <U+017F>poke to her of his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, the fair One was plea<U+017F>ed, and received that Declaration the mo<U+017F>t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably imaginable; but after having agreed upon loving one another, as they were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certain Conditions, People came in; which obliged the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to go out a Moment after.</p>

The Counte<U+017F>s told her that <U+017F>he was only to con<U+017F>ult her Heart in <U+017F>uch Occa<U+017F>ions: <hi>My heart does not <U+017F>ay to me much in favour of the Count,</hi> replyed Madam <hi>d' Olonne, and my Rea<U+017F>on tells me a thou<U+017F>and things again<U+017F>t him: He is a Spark I can never love.</hi> In <U+017F>aying the<U+017F>e words, <U+017F>he took leave of the Counte<U+017F>s, without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her An<U+017F>wer.</p>
            <p>On the other <U+017F>ide the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to his Hou<U+017F>e, he met with <hi>Vinevil,</hi> who waited for him with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to know what po<U+017F>ture his Affairs

were in; the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> told him <U+017F>omething coldly, that he believed all was broaken off, con<U+017F>idering how Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> treated him; and <hi>Vinevil</hi> de<U+017F>iring to know the particulars of the Conver<U+017F>ation, the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> not being willing to di<U+017F>cover what pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, changed di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e every moment; this gave <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>picions to <hi>Vineuil</hi> who was cunning and in love with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and only concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him<U+017F>elf in the affairs of the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> that he might prevail with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s by the things he <U+017F>hould have learnt. He went away <U+017F>eeing he could not make any di<U+017F>covery, and was for three days in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal di<U+017F>quiets, not being able to learn the certainty of what he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, and what he would know.

            <p>At three days end he went to the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Hou<U+017F>e. <hi>What have I done my Lord,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to him, <hi>that obliges you to treat me thus?

All that I could remarke was, that <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me from time to time; but returning thither the day after, and having found her

with the greate<U+017F>t violence imaginable. For my part without making either Prayers or Complaints, knowing what I had de<U+017F>erved, I went home in a fury and having put my <U+017F>elf to Bed, I turned all my choler again<U+017F>t the cau<U+017F>e of my Di<U+017F>grace.</p>

Love being <U+017F>atisfied, he had time to reflect on the ill Condition his Fortune was in, or that he feared he had given his Wife the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e he had, he fell into a terrible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy on the Morrow after his Marriage: And while he was at <hi>Steny,</hi> his Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued upon him to that degree, that he was as con<U+017F>tant to the Woods as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage. Two or three days after he went to the Army, and his Wife into a Convent of the Religieu<U+017F>es, two Leagues from <hi>Paris.</hi> It was thither that <hi>Roquelaure,</hi> knowing the Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>he was in, <U+017F>ent her a Thou<U+017F>and broad Pieces, and <hi>Vinevil</hi> two thou<U+017F>and Crowns, which Sums are <U+017F>till owing to them, tho the Dutche<U+017F>s is very rich, and that Money was employed to her own u<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coligny</hi> being under Age when he married his Wife, it rendred his Marriage invalid, but being of Age at his Return, a Contract of Marriage was made in the <hi>Hostel</hi> of <hi>Condé</hi> before all the young Ladies Relations, and they were afterwards married in <hi>No<U+017F>tre Dame</hi> by the Coadjutor of <hi>Paris.</hi> Sometime after Madam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon</hi> being indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, went to the Wells, where <U+017F>he met with the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who fell in love with her.</p>

The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> had very white Hair, a hand<U+017F>ome No<U+017F>e, a little Mouth, and of a fine Colour, and was the prettie<U+017F>t <U+017F>hape Man imaginable: The lea<U+017F>t of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions was attended with an unexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible Grace, his Humour was gay, wanton and toying, and his Will was admirable brisk and quaint. The liberty of <U+017F>eeing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at all hours, which Cu<U+017F>tom has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in Places where the Waters are taken, gave a thou<U+017F>and opportunities to the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> of acquainting his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s with his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: But knowing that an Amorous Intrigue was never better regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, at lea<U+017F>t with Ladies we have <U+017F>ome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teem for, than by making a Declaration by word of Mouth or by Writing: He re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to <U+017F>peak; and being one day alone with her at her Lodgings, <q>I have been above three weeks, Madam, <U+017F>aid he to her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering whether I <U+017F>hould tell you the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion your Charms have made upon my heart; and when I determined at length to acquaint you with it, it is after having <U+017F>een all the Difficulties that I can find in this De<U+017F>ign: I do my <U+017F>elf Ju<U+017F>tice, Madam, and for that rea<U+017F>on I ought not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any hopes.

Enterprize to remove him out of your heart, and to put my <U+017F>elf in his place.

But the fear of not <U+017F>eeming mode<U+017F>t enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed her <U+017F>o extreamly, that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time without knowing what An<U+017F>wer to make. At length forcing her<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>peak for the concealing the di<U+017F>order that her <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence made appear; <q>You are in the right my Lord, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to him, with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable po<U+017F>tures, to believe that I love my Husband very much; but give me leave to tell you, that you do your <U+017F>elf wrong in being <U+017F>o Mode<U+017F>t as you are: And if I was in a Condition to acknowledge the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s you have for me, you would <U+017F>ee that others e<U+017F>teem you more than you do your <U+017F>elf.

                  <hi><U+017F>ervice that I have devoted, <U+017F>aid he, to the Family of his Grace your Husband, obliges me to come and give you an advice which is of Con<U+017F>equence. Beautyfull as you are, Madam, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but that you mu<U+017F>t have adorers, and as certainly your intentions being good, you have not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trict a raine over your own actions; mo<U+017F>t Women who envy you, and Men jealous of the Glory of the Duke your Husband, give an ill interpretation to all you do. My Lord your Husband, him<U+017F>elf has perceived that your Conduct, which tho it were more imprudent than Criminal, does not faile however to do you an injury in the World, and trouble him: you know how haughty he is, Madam, and how much he would fear to be ridiculed upon that point: I give you notice of it, and humbly be<U+017F>eech you to take care; for if by relying too much upon the clearne<U+017F>s of your Con<U+017F>cience, you <U+017F>hould be too negligent of your Reputation, his Grace may come to <U+017F>uch Violences again<U+017F>t you, as would not leave you in a Condition to make appear to him your innocence. What you tell me, Sir,</hi> an<U+017F>wered Madam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon, ought not to <U+017F>urprize me; my Lord Duke began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to accustom me to his Caprichio's: On the day after our Wedding, he fell into <U+017F>o furious a jealou<U+017F>y of</hi> Roquelaure, <hi>who had helped him to carry me away, that he could not conceal it;</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:61590:64"/>
                  <hi>and yet he could never have had le<U+017F>s rea<U+017F>on than at what he gave him; and now again I find that he renews his <U+017F>u<U+017F>picions, and yet I cannot devine of whom it is: All that I can <U+017F>ay is, that I doubt whether his mind would be at re<U+017F>t, tho I were in the Countrey and <U+017F>aw none but my Dome<U+017F>ticks. I <U+017F>hall not come to further parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars with you, Madam. I even know not whether my Lord Duke aimes at any one, when he tells me he is <U+017F>atisfied with you; but you may upon what I have told you take mea<U+017F>ures for your Conduct.</hi> And thereupon having taken leave of her, he left her under terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble di<U+017F>quiets. She immediately gave notice of all this to the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and they re<U+017F>olved together that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>train them<U+017F>elves more than they had thitherto done.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> was wholly taken up in Contriving how to reduce the People of <hi>Paris</hi> by Famine, to deliver the Parliament, that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ed a <U+017F>um to tho<U+017F>e who would bring the Cardinals Head, fancyed that the taking of <hi>Charenton</hi> would much advance this Succe<U+017F>s, which <hi>Clanle</hi> guarded with five or <U+017F>ix hundred Men: he rea<U+017F><U+017F>embled part of the Quarters, and with a thou<U+017F>and Men, at the head of whom <hi>Ga<U+017F>ton</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the

King's Unkle, and Lieutenant General of the Regency, would needs place him<U+017F>elf, he came to Attack <hi>Charenton</hi> in three places. As the Retrenchments at the <hi>Avenues</hi> were but bad, it was not difficult for the King's Troops to force them. But the Duke of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> who commanded the Attacks under the Prince was wounded in the belly with a Musket <U+017F>hot in the Burrough, of which he dyed the Night after. The Prince regretted him extreamly, and his grief was <U+017F>o violent that it could not la<U+017F>t. By what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed you may judge that the Dutche<U+017F><U+017F>es Affliction was not very great, and you may judge it much better by what <U+017F>hall happen in the <U+017F>equel; however <U+017F>he wept, <U+017F>he tore her Hair, and made appear the Appearances of the greate<U+017F>t De<U+017F>pair i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable, the Publick was <U+017F>o deceived, that this Sonnet was made upon his death.</p>

Merit, had <U+017F>o much Complai<U+017F>ance for him, that this Prince, tho very much in love el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, could not re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t her; but yielded through the weakne<U+017F>s of the Fle<U+017F>h, rather than the inclination of the heart. The Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> who had been for three years the beloved Gallant of Madam <hi>de Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville,</hi> <U+017F>aw the Infidelity of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s with all the rage that can be had in <U+017F>uch like Occa<U+017F>ions. But <U+017F>he being full of a great Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> was not at all careful to plea<U+017F>e her ancient Lover. The fir<U+017F>t time that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> in private, <U+017F>he asked him in the mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate moment of the A<U+017F><U+017F>ignation, what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed between him and Madam <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tillon:</hi> The Duke having an<U+017F>wered her that he had not had any Favour: <hi>Ah!

The<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>ts did likewi<U+017F>e further the Journey that the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:61590:69"/>
was to make into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to bring a Succour of Strangers to the Princes Party: But the real cau<U+017F>e of his impatience was, to <U+017F>ee Madam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon</hi> again, whom he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loved more than his life; whereupon he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed through <hi>Paris,</hi> where he <U+017F>aw her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and put her into that wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that may be called the Shipwrack of Widows. When <U+017F>he perceived her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ought for the means to be freed from it. <hi>Des Fougerets,</hi> a famous Phy<U+017F>ician, undertook this Cure, and while he had her in hand, the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> returned from <hi>Guyenne</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> and brought <hi>la Rochefou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>The Prince had lively Eyes, a Hawks and <U+017F>harp No<U+017F>e, hollow lean Cheeks, a long Face, and the Phy<U+017F>iognomy of an Eagle, frizled Hair, his Teeth were ill <U+017F>et and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ty, a carele<U+017F>s Aire, had but little care of his Per<U+017F>on, but was well <U+017F>haped; his Wit had a great deal of flame, but was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, he laughed much and di<U+017F>agreably, his <hi>Genius</hi> was admirable for War, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for Battails. On the day of Battail he was mild to Friends, and fierce to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: He had an unparallel'd neatne<U+017F>s of Wit, force of Judgment, and ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion; he was Rogui<U+017F>hly inclined, but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61590:69"/>
had Faith and Probity in great Occa<U+017F>ions: He was naturally in<U+017F>olent and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, but Adver<U+017F>ity had taught him how to live. This Prince finding him<U+017F>elf di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed to fall in love with the Dutche<U+017F>s, <hi>La Rochefoucault</hi> helped <U+017F>till to inflame him by the great de<U+017F>ire he had of being revenged on the Duke of <hi>Nemours. Rochfoucault</hi> per<U+017F>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to give her the Propriety of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou,</hi> which <U+017F>he had only the u<U+017F>u-fruit of, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that Madam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon</hi> was youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he, and that this Pre<U+017F>ent would only injure his Po<U+017F>terity; and that a Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip of two thou<U+017F>and pounds a year, more or le<U+017F>s, would neither render him richer nor poorer.</p>
               <p>When the Prince fell in love with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon,</hi> <U+017F>he was in the hands of <hi>Des Fougore<U+017F>ts,</hi> who made u<U+017F>e of Vomits to free her of tho<U+017F>e ill Circum<U+017F>tances. The Prince, who was continually at her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide, asked her what her Sickne<U+017F>s was; <U+017F>he told him that <U+017F>he believed <U+017F>he was poy<U+017F>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This Lover being extreamly grieved to <U+017F>ee his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s in danger of her life, told the Apothecary, who <U+017F>erved her, that he would cau<U+017F>e him to be hanged: This poor man not daring to ju<U+017F>tifie him<U+017F>elf, went and told <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> who was married to <hi>Ricoux,</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:61590:70"/>
that if he was pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed too much, he would tell all. In <U+017F>hort, the Remedies had the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that they had promi<U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves: And <U+017F>hortly after this Cure, the Prince having given her <hi>Marlou,</hi> Madam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon</hi> was not ungrateful, but <U+017F>he only gave him the u<U+017F>u-fruit of what the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> had the Propriety. However, <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> took full Vengeance of the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> and gave him di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures by <U+017F>o much the more cutting, that he had not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to cure him<U+017F>elf of his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault</hi> had done of that he had had for Madam <hi>de Longueville.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides <hi>Rochefou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault, Vinevil</hi> was likewi<U+017F>e the Prince's Confident, who in <U+017F>erving him with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, endeavoured likewi<U+017F>e to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved him<U+017F>elf. <hi>Vinevil</hi> was the Pre<U+017F>ident <hi>d' Ardiers</hi> Brother, of a pretty good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in <hi>Paris,</hi> had a plea<U+017F>ing Face, much Learning, and was a well-bred man: His Humour was plea<U+017F>ant and Satyrical, tho very fearful; this had often brought him into trouble; he was undertaking with Women, and that made him almo<U+017F>t always <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful, he had had an Intrigue with Madam <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazon,</hi> Madam <hi>de Movy,</hi> and likewi<U+017F>e with the Prince<U+017F>s of <hi>Wittembergh:</hi> And this la<U+017F>t Gallantry had <U+017F>o embroiled him, with the

late Duke of <hi>Cha<U+017F>tillon,</hi> that without the Prince's protection he would have <U+017F>uffered <U+017F>ome Violences, and <hi>Cha<U+017F>tillons</hi> hatred for him, had <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed his Wife to love him. But let us leave <hi>Vinevil</hi> for <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and return to the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Jealou<U+017F>ie <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one day found the Prince at Madam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon</hi>'s whi<U+017F>pering with her, he all <U+017F>cratched his hands without perceiving what he did; and it was one of his Servants who made him take notice of the Condition he had put him<U+017F>elf in. At length, not being able to <U+017F>uffer the Prince's Vi<U+017F>its to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, he de<U+017F>ired her to go for <U+017F>ome time to her Country Hou<U+017F>e. She loving him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, and not thinking that a <U+017F>hort ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence would cool the Prince's Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him his reque<U+017F>t; and likewi<U+017F>e promi<U+017F>ed him to turn off <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> who had quitted his Intere<U+017F>ts for to be for tho<U+017F>e of his Rival. Madam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon</hi> was not long in the Country; and at her Return, the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> was jealous to that degree, that he was twenty times upon the point of cau<U+017F>ing the Prince to draw; and he would at length have been overcome with this Temptation, had it not been for the Duel he fought with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61590:71"/>
his Brother in Law, in which he lo<U+017F>t his Life.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> who of twenty Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <U+017F>he had favoured in her life time, had never loved any <U+017F>o much as the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> was really grieved for his death. One of her Friends, who brought her the News of it, told her at the <U+017F>ame time, that it was requi<U+017F>ite that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould get out of one of Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> his <hi>Valet de Chamber</hi>'s hands, a Cabinet full of her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. She <U+017F>ent for him, and upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e <U+017F>he made him of giving him five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns, <U+017F>he got the Cabinet from him, but the poor Fellow could never get any of the Money.</p>
               <p>As for the Prince, what obligation <U+017F>oever he had to the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> jealou<U+017F>ie had <U+017F>o di<U+017F>united them, that he was very glad of his death. Glory as well as Love had cau<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o much Emulation between them, that they could not bear with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and this is <U+017F>o true, that if the Prince had had a mind to have taken all the Precautions nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to hinder the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> from fighting, he might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Duel. One thing more which made appear that there was more of Glory than of Love in the Prince's Heart, was that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61590:71"/>
a moment after the death of his Rival, he hardly loved Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and contented him<U+017F>elf with keeping mea<U+017F>ures of Civility with her, to make u<U+017F>e of her upon occa<U+017F>ion, and when he <U+017F>hould think convenient.</p>
               <p>And indeed at that time, the Cardinal thinking that <U+017F>he governed the Prince, <U+017F>ent the Great Provo<U+017F>t of <hi>France</hi> to her, to offer her from him an hundred thou<U+017F>and Crowns ready Money, and the Place of Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of the future Queens Family, in ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would oblige the Prince to grant the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles he de<U+017F>ired, and abandon the Count <hi>d' Oignon,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> and Pre<U+017F>ident <hi>Viole.</hi> During the Negotiation of the Grand Provo<U+017F>t, an Officer of the Guards, called <hi>Mouchette,</hi> negotiated like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e on the Queens part with Madam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon;</hi> but <U+017F>he, <U+017F>eeing that <U+017F>he could not per<U+017F>wade the Prince to do the things that the Count de<U+017F>ired, <U+017F>ent the Queen word that <U+017F>he coun<U+017F>elled her to grant the Prince all that he <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire of her, and that afterwards her Maje<U+017F>ty would know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how to deal with a Subject, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of the di<U+017F>order of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his Ma<U+017F>ter; had forced from her <U+017F>hameful Conditions, and <U+017F>uch as were

prejudicial to her Authority.</p>
               <p>At that time, the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> having been taken by the Enemies, was brought to the Palace of <hi>Condé;</hi> he had a very <U+017F>harp Conver<U+017F>ation with the Prince, but on the morrow things began to cool, and <U+017F>ome days after the Treaty of Peace was renewed with him.

               <p>Things were in the<U+017F>e terms, when that the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> <U+017F>eeing that his Affairs did not advance with Madam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon,</hi> made u<U+017F>e of this Stratagem to ha<U+017F>tem them: He had learnt that <hi>Ricoux,</hi> Brother in Law to one of Madam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon</hi>'s Women, was concealed in <hi>Paris,</hi> where he had Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>pondence with them for the Prince's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>ts; he <U+017F>ent <U+017F>o many People in que<U+017F>t of <hi>Ricoux,</hi> that he was taken and carried to the <hi>Ba<U+017F>tille.</hi> The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> having cau<U+017F>ed him to be examined, he accu<U+017F>ed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Cha<U+017F>tillon</hi> of <U+017F>everal things; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t others, of having promi<U+017F>ed him ten thou<U+017F>and Crowns to kill the Cardinal, and <U+017F>aid that <U+017F>he had already given him two thou<U+017F>and beforehand upon that account.

he did not judge it Convenient to incurr the hatred of <U+017F>o violent a Man; wherefore he did not per<U+017F>evere in that Amour.

               <p>Things being in this Po<U+017F>ture, the Abbot <U+017F>urprized a very kind Letter, that the Dutche<U+017F>s wrote to the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> This grieved him <U+017F>o extreamly, that in reproaching her, he would have poi<U+017F>oned him<U+017F>elf with Quick<U+017F>ilver from behind a Looking-gla<U+017F>s; but beginning to find him<U+017F>elf ill, he lo<U+017F>t the de<U+017F>ire of dying for a faithle<U+017F>s one, and took <hi>Theriaque</hi> which he u<U+017F>ually carried about him to <U+017F>ecure him<U+017F>elf from Enemies, which the employ he had about the Cardinal procured him daily.

he went from thence at two a Clock in the Night, and came again at eight in the Morning, thus was he with her eighteen hours in four and twenty.</p>
               <p>It was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but that the Cardinal mu<U+017F>t know where the Dutche<U+017F>s was, and this is plea<U+017F>ant that this great Man, who decided the Fate of <hi>Europe,</hi> <U+017F>hould go halves with the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> in an amourous <U+017F>ecret: I beleive that the rea<U+017F>on he had to approve this Commerce was, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dutche<U+017F>s to be Intriguing, he cho<U+017F>e rather <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be in the Abbots hands, whom he was <U+017F>ure of, than in an other; and be<U+017F>ides the Abbot keeping her in a Chamber, and ab<U+017F>olutely di<U+017F>honoring her thereby, he was glad that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> her Cou<U+017F>in and lover, might receive thereby an extraordinary mortification.

               <p>The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> and <U+017F>he had agreed together, that every <hi>Saturday</hi> they would mutually return the Letters they had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to one another all the week long, and

that he would <U+017F>end for them by a Man who <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay that he belonged to Mademoi<U+017F>elle <hi>Vertus.</hi> This Man being one day at <hi>Marlou,</hi> a footman came thither from the Mar<U+017F>hal <hi>d' Hocquincourt,</hi> with a Letter for the Dutche<U+017F>s, who having writ her an<U+017F>wers, and given them to a Chambermaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to the Bearers, this Woman mi<U+017F>took, and gave the Abbot's Man the an<U+017F>wer that her Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s <U+017F>ent the Mar<U+017F>hal, and to the Mar<U+017F>hal's Lacquie the Pacquet de<U+017F>igned for the Abbot.

It is certain thet the Dutche<U+017F>s had ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied her and was never able to pardon her Merit.

As for the Mar<U+017F>hal <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as he had <U+017F>een all the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot's Letters, and tho<U+017F>e that the Dutche<U+017F>s wrote to him, he judged that he might be one day obliged to re<U+017F>tore them her out of his weakne<U+017F>s to her, or through the de<U+017F>ires of her Friends, in<U+017F>omuch that he might be in a capacity to take his revenge on her when he plea<U+017F>ed: He cau<U+017F>ed copies to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them all, and then went and <U+017F>howed the originals to the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> to Madam <hi>Pi<U+017F>ieux,</hi> whom he knew to be the Dutche<U+017F><U+017F>es Enemies. After that the Abbot had been one Night at <hi>Marlou,</hi> he returned to <hi>Paris</hi> to the Mer<U+017F>hals Hou<U+017F>e, of whom he demanded his Letters. The Mar<U+017F>hal did not content him<U+017F>elf with refu<U+017F>ing him them, but added all the raillery after his way that he could bethink him<U+017F>elf of; while the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hal was thus drolling he held the Dutche<U+017F>s, Letter open to the Abbot, who had liever have been killed, than have <U+017F>uffered his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s to have laine at his Rival's di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61590:88"/>
as <U+017F>he did by this Letter, caught hold of it, and tore half of it off, which he went to <U+017F>how to the Dutche<U+017F>s, telling her that the Mar<U+017F>hal had burnt the other halfe; but the Mar<U+017F>hal being enraged at this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of the Abbots; bid him be gone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately out of his Hou<U+017F>e, and that if <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>pects did not withhold him, he would cau<U+017F>e him to be thrown out of the Window.</p>
               <p>The Dutche<U+017F>s being <U+017F>ometime after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Paris,</hi> fancied that to undeceive the Publick of a thou<U+017F>and Particulars, that the Mar<U+017F>hal had <U+017F>aid of her, it was requi<U+017F>ite that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould let People of Merit and Virtue <U+017F>ee after what manner <U+017F>he would treat him. In order to which, <U+017F>he made choice of the Hou<U+017F>e of the Marque<U+017F>s <hi>de Souches,</hi> Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo<U+017F>t of <hi>France,</hi> to whom and his Wife <U+017F>he had a mind to ju<U+017F>tifie her<U+017F>elf more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: The A<U+017F><U+017F>ignation being made with the Mar<U+017F>hal, he perceived her de<U+017F>ign. <hi>God keep thee, my poor Child,</hi> <U+017F>aid he acco<U+017F>ting her, <hi>How does my little Buttocks do, are they <U+017F>till very lean?</hi> It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to imagine the <U+017F>ad Condition this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e put the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>s in! <U+017F>he was as if <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>tund with a blow upon her head, it made her forget to call the Mar<U+017F>hal Fool and In<U+017F>olent; but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61590:88"/>
<U+017F>he fancied that having begun as he did, he would proceed to the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>hameful parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars imaginable for her, if <U+017F>he di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed him never <U+017F>o little. The Grand Provo<U+017F>t and his Wi<U+017F>e looked upon one another, and turning towards the Dutche<U+017F>s, found her with her Eyes towards the ground, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <U+017F>he did not change her Colour; but tho<U+017F>e who knew her did not believe her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed. At length the Great Provo<U+017F>t brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <U+017F>ilence, <hi>You do ill,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>my Lord Mar<U+017F>hal; Gallant men ought never to quarrel with Ladies, they ought to be thankul to them for the Pre<U+017F>ents they make them of their Hearts, and ought not to offend them when they refu<U+017F>e it. I grant that,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Mar<U+017F>hal, <hi>but when their Hearts are once given, if they change af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, it is requi<U+017F>ite they u<U+017F>e civilly tho<U+017F>e they have loved, and when they droll upon them, they expo<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves to great Affronts. You un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand me, Madam,</hi> added he, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Dutche<U+017F>s, <hi>I am <U+017F>ure you believe that I have rea<U+017F>on for what I <U+017F>ay, but you <U+017F>urprize me with your di<U+017F>order; you ought to be prepared for <U+017F>uch Accidents, <U+017F>ince you lay Snares for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who revenge them<U+017F>elves. I vow I would not have believed that you had <U+017F>o much Mode<U+017F>ty as you have.</hi> And in ending this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he went away, and left the Dutche<U+017F>s more dead
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61590:89"/>
than alive. The Great Provo<U+017F>t and his Wife endeavoured to bring her to her<U+017F>elf; telling her, That what the Mar<U+017F>hal had <U+017F>aid, had not made any impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon their minds; however from that day they had no great Commerce with her.</p>
               <p>A fortnight after the Abbot was obliged to go to the Court, which was at <hi>Compeigne;</hi> The Dutche<U+017F>s fore<U+017F>eeing the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dés</hi> return into <hi>France</hi> by the general Peace that was much talked of, and not being willing that he <U+017F>hould find her in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Intrigue for her, re<U+017F>olved to break off after <U+017F>uch a manner, as that there might not remain the lea<U+017F>t appearance of it. In this de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>he went to the Abbots Hou<U+017F>e, where having found one of his Servants in whom he put mo<U+017F>t confidence, and asked him for the Keyes of his Ma<U+017F>ter's Clo<U+017F>et, <U+017F>aying <U+017F>he had a mind to write him a Letter. This Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low without penetrating further, and only con<U+017F>idering the Abbots Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for the Dutche<U+017F>s, he gave her immediately what <U+017F>he demanded. Seeing her<U+017F>elf alone, <U+017F>he broak the lock of the Cabinet where <U+017F>he knew that the Abbot kept her Letters, and not only took them all, but likewi<U+017F>e others from the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>acrificed to them, and went and burnt them
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61590:89"/>
at Madam <hi>de Sourches</hi> Hou<U+017F>e. The Abbot having <U+017F>ound this di<U+017F>order at his return home, went to the Dutche<U+017F><U+017F>es Hou<U+017F>e, and began to threaten to cut off her No<U+017F>e, and then broke a Chri<U+017F>tal Candle<U+017F>tick, and a great Looking-gla<U+017F>s that he had given her, and went away after having called her a thou<U+017F>and Names. During all this bu<U+017F>tle, one of the Dutche<U+017F><U+017F>es Chambermaids fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Abbot would take away from her all that he had given her, laid hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es Cabinet of Jewels, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to Madam <hi>de Sourches</hi> Hou<U+017F>e, from whence <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent for it again the <U+017F>ame Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gave it to a devout Relation of her Mothers to keep. The Abbot having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it on the Morrow, went to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Womans Hou<U+017F>e, and took it away by force. The Dutche<U+017F>s being informed of the lo<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had, was extreamly grieved; but <U+017F>he did not lo<U+017F>e her judgment, <U+017F>he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed people to the Abbot, who had <U+017F>o much credit with him, that he re<U+017F>tored the Cabinet; and by the means of this re<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were as well reconciled as they had ever been; and this reconciliation was <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden, that Madam <hi>de Bouteville</hi> coming the morrow to comfort the Dutche<U+017F>s her Daughter for the accident that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61590:90"/>
to her, the Abbot was already with her, who concealed him<U+017F>elf in a Clo<U+017F>et during the Vi<U+017F>it, and heard all the Comedy.</p>
               <p>Some time after, the Dutche<U+017F>s not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to take alwaies the pains to conceal that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw the Abbot again; and fancied that <U+017F>ince their quarrel was known abroad, their reconciliation ought likewi<U+017F>e to be publick: Wherefore <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed all her friends to de<U+017F>ire her to pardon the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot upon his <U+017F>ollicitation, and at length having made it a point of Con<U+017F>cience, the Mother Abbe<U+017F>s, of the Convent of <hi>Mercy,</hi> a Woman <U+017F>ubject to beatifical Vi<U+017F>itations, made them <U+017F>ee and embrace one another. This Mediation brought the Reverend Mother into <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>credit with the Queen and the Cardinal: They fancyed that that <U+017F>he had not <U+017F>o particular a Commerce with God, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffered her <U+017F>elf to be <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily deceived by Men.</p>
               <p>However this reconciliation la<U+017F>ted but <U+017F>ix Months; The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s return into <hi>France</hi> coming on daily made the Dutche<U+017F>s apprehend that he would find her under the Abbots Tutor<U+017F>hip, and the Ladies <hi>de Saint Chaumond</hi> and <hi>de Feguiers</hi> made her <U+017F>o much a<U+017F>hamed of him, that <U+017F>he broak with him upon a pretext of Devotion. It
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61590:90"/>
was very difficult for the Abbot to con<U+017F>ent to the Dutche<U+017F>s's de<U+017F>ign, and would not have done it at an other time; but <U+017F>eeing his Credit very much dimini<U+017F>hed with the Cardinal, and fearing that the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who hated him be<U+017F>ides, and <hi>Boute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> who would revenge the di<U+017F>honour he had done to his family, might cau<U+017F>e him to be <U+017F>tabbed, if he gave the Dutche<U+017F>s the lea<U+017F>t new Rea<U+017F>on of Complaining, he left off Vi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but not loving her.</p>

               <p>AT that time Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> was gone as I have <U+017F>aid, to de<U+017F>ire the Counte<U+017F>s of <hi>Fie<U+017F>que,</hi> to thank in her name the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> for <U+017F>ome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Obligation which was properly nothing; but <U+017F>he had a mind the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> <U+017F>hould make Reflections upon the Compliment, and make him Comprehend that when people have thanks returned them for <U+017F>uch <U+017F>mall things, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be indebted to them for the greater Obligations.

Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being ever full of Con<U+017F>ideration, when <U+017F>he was to lo<U+017F>e a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, not <U+017F>o much out of fear of his Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he le<U+017F><U+017F>ened the number, told the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> that he was Ma<U+017F>ter of her Conduct, that he might pre<U+017F>cribe to her what manner of life he plea<U+017F>ed; that if the Abbot gave him umbrage, <U+017F>he would not only <U+017F>ee him no more, but if he was willing he <U+017F>hould be witne<U+017F>s after what rate <U+017F>he would rattle him.

It is no <U+017F>trange thing that you find not much di<U+017F>cretion in a Per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>o much fire; tho<U+017F>e two things being u<U+017F>ually incompatible, and Nature cannot work Miracles in <U+017F>avour of her: A brisk Fool takes more with her than a wel-bred <U+017F>erious Man; the gaiety of People prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es her, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall be judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you under<U+017F>tand what <U+017F>he <U+017F>ays; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t mark of wit that can be given her, is to admire her. She loves Incen<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he loves being beloved, and in order to that <U+017F>he loves that <U+017F>he may reap, <U+017F>he gives prai<U+017F>e that <U+017F>he may receive it; <U+017F>he generally loves all men, of what Age, of what Birth, of what Merit, and what Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>oever they are, from the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Robe to the Frock, from the Scepter to

the Inkhorn; among<U+017F>t Men <U+017F>he loves a Lover better than a Friend, and among<U+017F>t Lovers the merry more than the <U+017F>ad; the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flatter her Vanity, and the Brisk her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; <U+017F>he diverts her<U+017F>elf with the<U+017F>e, and flatters her<U+017F>elf with an opinion that her Merit mu<U+017F>t be great, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is able to make tho<U+017F>e others langui<U+017F>h.</p>
                  <p>She is of a cold temper, at lea<U+017F>t if we might believe her decea<U+017F>ed Husband, and it was to it that he was obliged for her Vertue as he <U+017F>aid; all her heat is in her will. The truth is it makes full recompence for the coldne<U+017F>s of her temper; I believe that Conjugal Faith has not that violence if we con<U+017F>ider the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is another thing to <U+017F>peak freely, I believe her Husband clear before Men, but I take him for a Cuckold before God. This fair One being willing to <U+017F>hare in all diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>ements, has found a <U+017F>ure means, as <U+017F>he thinks, to take her Plea<U+017F>ures without injuring her Reputation in the lea<U+017F>t: She has contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Friend<U+017F>hip with four or five pretended <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s, with whom <U+017F>he goes into all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imaginable; <U+017F>he does not <U+017F>o much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider what <U+017F>he does, as with whom <U+017F>he is: By thus doing, <U+017F>he per<U+017F>wades her<U+017F>elf that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Company rectifies all her actions, and for my part, I fancy that the critical Minute, which is u<U+017F>ually found with all women when

only a Man and a Woman is together, would <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t be met with her in the mid<U+017F>t of her Family.

The Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, which her little Court is full of, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her after another rate, they never fail to tell her, that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to reconcile Wi<U+017F>dom with the World, and Plea<U+017F>ure with Vertue, better than <U+017F>he does.

This is, my Dear, the Picture of Madam <hi>de Sevigny:</hi> her e<U+017F>tate which would have been a great help to mine and had belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our family, obliged my Father to de<U+017F>ign I <U+017F>hould marry her; But tho I was <U+017F>o well acquainted with her then, as I am at pre<U+017F>ent, I did not an<U+017F>wer my Fathers de<U+017F>ign, certain loo<U+017F>e Cour<U+017F>es I <U+017F>aw her take made me apprehen<U+017F>ive; And I found her the prettye<U+017F>t Creature imaginable to be the Wife of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

For my part, who had more familiarity with her than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I did not wait <U+017F>o long as they to <U+017F>peak to her of agreeable things; and pre<U+017F>ently after I made love to her, but without Ceremonies, and as if I had never done nothing el<U+017F>e: She made me one of her Oracle an<U+017F>wers, which Women make u<U+017F>ually in the beginning, that my Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was <U+017F>o much at re<U+017F>t, that it made me appear but little favourable, and perhaps it might be <U+017F>o, I know not.

From time to time we had little quarrels, which indeed were made up, but which left in my heart, and I believe in here, <U+017F>uch <U+017F>eeds of Divi<U+017F>ion for the fir<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion we <U+017F>hould both have, and which were even capable to imbitter indifferent things.

did a favour to <hi>Feuillade</hi> which he knew not <U+017F>o well the value of as I did; but I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be contented with what <U+017F>he had given me: And as I had <U+017F>een Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> but five or <U+017F>ix times, I fancyed that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications I was going to make to Madam <hi>de Precy</hi> would efface out of my mind the beginning of a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
                  <p>We thereupon made our Addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to our Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, <hi>la Feuillade</hi> having for a Fortnight or three Weeks, made love to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Montglas</hi> by a<U+017F><U+017F>iduities, re<U+017F>olved at length to make her a Declaration. At fir<U+017F>t he found her a Woman, who without being too <U+017F>evere, <U+017F>eemed to him <U+017F>o natural an Enemy of Engagements, that he almo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>paired of effecting his de<U+017F>igns with her, or at lea<U+017F>t of effecting them <U+017F>uddenly: Yet he was not quite di<U+017F>encouraged, and <U+017F>ometime after he found her more uncertain, and in <U+017F>hort he pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>o much, and <U+017F>eemed to her <U+017F>o much in love, that <U+017F>he gave him leave to hope being beloved one day: But before I <U+017F>peak further, it is convenient that I de<U+017F>cribe to you Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> and <hi>Feuillade.</hi>

                  <p>Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> has little black <U+017F>park<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Eys, an agreable Mouth, a No<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing turned up, fine white Teeth, a too lively Complexion, fine and delicate Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and a plea<U+017F>ing turn of Countenance;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61590:110"/>
her Hair is black, long and thick; <U+017F>he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neat, and the Air that comes from her is purer then that <U+017F>he breathes; <U+017F>he has the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t Neck imaginable, her Arms and Hands delicately <U+017F>haped, <U+017F>he is neither great nor little, but of <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie a <U+017F>hape, that it will be ever agreable, if <U+017F>he can <U+017F>ave it from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency of too much fat. Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> has a quick and penetrating Wit, like her Complexion, even to exce<U+017F>s; <U+017F>he <U+017F>peaks and writes with a <U+017F>urprizing Facility, and the mo<U+017F>t naturally imaginable; her thoughts are often diverted el<U+017F>ewhere in Conver<U+017F>ation, and you cannot <U+017F>ay to her things of <U+017F>o great Con<U+017F>equence, as to take up all her attention; <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires you <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to tell her <U+017F>omething <U+017F>he had then a mind to know; and as you begin your Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <U+017F>he forgets her Curio<U+017F>ity, and the fire, <U+017F>he is full of, makes her interrupt you to <U+017F>peak of <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> loves Mu<U+017F>ick and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, <U+017F>he makes very pretty ones her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ings the be<U+017F>t of any Woman in <hi>France,</hi> of her Quality; no Body dances better than <U+017F>he, <U+017F>he fears Solitude, <U+017F>hè is a true Friend, even to take the part of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he loves with indi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and to the very giving them all her E<U+017F>tate, if they have occa<U+017F>ion for it: She keeps their Secrets, religiou<U+017F>ly; <U+017F>he knows
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61590:111"/>
very well how to conver<U+017F>e with the World; <U+017F>he is as Civil as a Woman of Quality ought to be: And tho <U+017F>he is not willing to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e any Body, her Civility has more of Pride than Flattery; for which rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he does not gain hearts <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>everal others that are more in<U+017F>inuating: But when they know her <U+017F>ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s, they apply them<U+017F>elves much more earne<U+017F>tly to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>La Feuillade</hi> is not altogether for a Man what Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> is for a Woman; their Merits are different; he has however <U+017F>ome fal<U+017F>e Charms, with which the weak are at fir<U+017F>t dazled, but which never deceives <U+017F>uch People as make Reflections; he has blew lively Eyes, a great Mouth, a <U+017F>hort No<U+017F>e, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled Hair, and <U+017F>omething reddi<U+017F>h; his Shape is pretty good, his Knees turn inwards, he has too much vivacity, he <U+017F>peaks much, and will alway be plea<U+017F>ant, but he does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do what he has a mind to, that is to <U+017F>ay, with civil Per<U+017F>ons, fancy to the populace and meane<U+017F>t Wits, with whom there needs no more than to have always the Mouth open to laugh orto <U+017F>peak; he is admirable; he has a light wit, and a hard heart, even to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; he is envious, and it is to him an affront, to be in pro<U+017F>perity; he is vain and haughty, and at his fir<U+017F>t coming to Court, he had <U+017F>o often told us that he was brave, that he made
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61590:111"/>
a Con<U+017F>cience of <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting it; however at pre<U+017F>ent we make a Con<U+017F>cience of believing it.</p>
                  <p>I have told you that Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> being per<U+017F>waded that he had a violent Pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for her, gave him hopes of being beloved. Any other than <hi>Feuillade</hi> would have made of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s the mo<U+017F>t agreable Intrigue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable; but he was lodged as I have told you, and only loved by <U+017F>tarts; he did enough to heat his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and too little to engage her. When I told that fair One that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her extreamly, becau<U+017F>e that <hi>Feuillade</hi> had de<U+017F>ired me before her to <U+017F>peak for him in his ab<U+017F>ence, <U+017F>he drolled upon me, and made me ob<U+017F>erve <U+017F>ome parts of his procedure, which de<U+017F>troyed the good Offices I would have done him. I did not fail to excu<U+017F>e him, &amp; not being able to <U+017F>ave his Conduct, I ju<U+017F>tified at lea<U+017F>t his intentions. We were much upon the<U+017F>e terms, <hi>Darcy</hi> and I with the Ladies of <hi>Precy</hi> and <hi>L' I<U+017F>le,</hi> that is to <U+017F>ay, they were willing that we <U+017F>hould love them, but indeed we did our Devoir better with them, than <hi>Feuillade</hi> did with Madam <hi>de Monglas;</hi> in <U+017F>hort, three Months being <U+017F>pent, during which that fair One found her<U+017F>elf more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by the things I had <U+017F>aid to her in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Feuillade,</hi> than by the love he had <U+017F>hown her; this Lover was forced to go <U+017F>erve in the Army with a Regiment of Foot he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61590:112"/>
had. This Farewel made her <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>omething more kindne<U+017F>s in her heart for <hi>la Feuillade</hi> then <U+017F>he had thitherto belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; She let him perceive <U+017F>omething of it; but tho it was enough to render a welbred Man happy, it could not <U+017F>hock the <U+017F>evere<U+017F>t Vertue. <hi>Feuillade</hi> at parting made her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and Prote<U+017F>tations of loving her as long as he lived, tho <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould even continue ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinately re<U+017F>olved not to make any returns to his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and he and I pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>o much to give him leave to write to her, that <U+017F>he gave her con<U+017F>ent.</p>
                  <p>Sometime before his departure, perceiving that the Commerce I had had for my Friend with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, had the more touched my heart for her, in making me the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, and that the efforts I had made to love Madam <hi>de Precy,</hi> had not cured me of my budding Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gl as.</hi> I re<U+017F>olved not to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>o often, that I might not be divided between Honour and Self-love.

The fir<U+017F>t thing which made me perceive that I was in love with you, Madam, was the trouble your ab<U+017F>ence gave me; and as I was upon the point of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning my <U+017F>elf to my Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and of thinking of the means of making it known to you,</hi> Darcy, Feuillade, <hi>and I, drew lots, whom we <U+017F>hould each of us make our addre<U+017F>s to, of you.

                     <hi>afterwards, that without de<U+017F>igning to betray him, I was overjoyed with being concerned in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to have only the plea<U+017F>ure of <U+017F>eeing you more nearly, but at length it put me into terrible pains; this, Madam, has obliged me to <U+017F>ee you le<U+017F>s fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and tho you did not take notice of it, but <U+017F>ince</hi> Feuillade<hi>'s departure, it is above a fortnight <U+017F>ince I retrenched my Vi<U+017F>its.

What gave me <U+017F>ome Comfort in the Pro<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of all the pains that an Amour without hopes is attended with, is that I was upon the Point of having the charge of Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Hor<U+017F>e, and that this Charge ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging me to go <U+017F>uddainly to the Army, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would Cure me of an unfortunate pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion.
