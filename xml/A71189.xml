            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of Teares. This impatiently expected day drawing nigh, and being earne<U+017F>tly de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
both by this new <hi>Druide,</hi> and by the new love of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> both of them not being able
to <U+017F>tay <U+017F>o long as till the Sunne was up, they quitted their beds upon the fir<U+017F>t blu<U+017F>h of
Aurora. <hi>Celadon,</hi> as mo<U+017F>t vigilant, called the Sun <U+017F>luggard, and conjured Aurora to open
the windowes of Heaven quickly, that thereby this happy and long'd for day might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a beginning. Whil<U+017F>t this re<U+017F>tle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheard was in this longing expectation, and
condemning the Suns <U+017F>low motion, day did by degrees enlighten his Chamber; <U+017F>o as a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uming
<hi>Druids</hi> habit, he left the Name of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and in lieu of it a<U+017F><U+017F>umed the Notion
of Daughter unto <hi>Adamas;</hi> happy had he been, could he have left off his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion as he
did his habit; but <hi>Celadons</hi> heart was <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame in any di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, and nothing could
work a change in it but death.</p>
                  <p>Being thus clad in the habit of <hi>Alexis,</hi> as <U+017F>oon as the doores of the hou<U+017F>e were open,
he walked alone into a little Grove which had the view of the Plaine; and from whence
he could <U+017F>ee the whole Cour<U+017F>e of the delightfull River of <hi>Lignon:</hi> As <U+017F>oon as ever he ca<U+017F>t
his eye that way, it pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>topped at the place where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> dwelt, and thinking upon
the happy dayes which he had <U+017F>pent in that place, when in his own habit he was freely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be with his beloved <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e; Oh what abundance of <U+017F>ighs did this thought
force from him? He began to recollect into his memory, all the <U+017F>weet and kind an<U+017F>wers
which ever <U+017F>he had given him, when being forced by the violence of his love, he begged
<U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of affection from her: Here he reveived the memory of all the traver<U+017F>es and
thwartings which <hi>Alcipes</hi> and <hi>Hipolite</hi> u<U+017F>ed; he did not forget the aver<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Alces,</hi>
nor the anger of their Parents, nor his long travels, nor any <U+017F>ubtiltie which love had taught
him: Al<U+017F>o he punctually remembred <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> con<U+017F>tancy in all difficulties, nor did he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
any circum<U+017F>tance, which might be any argument of her love once unto him. Then
pre<U+017F>ently after con<U+017F>idering how the ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>tood now, and how <U+017F>he had bani<U+017F>hed him her
pre<U+017F>ence, al<U+017F>o looking upon that fatal place where he received that di<U+017F>mall <U+017F>entence, Yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(<U+017F>aid he, and pointed to the place with his finger) yonder's the place de<U+017F>tined to
Ravi<U+017F>h from me all my joyes, and to be the beginning of all my mi<U+017F>eries. But (<U+017F>aid he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a melancholly pau<U+017F>e) is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>o great affection <U+017F>hould ever become <U+017F>uch extreame
hatred? Can <U+017F>uch firm Con<U+017F>tancy admit of any Change! And can <U+017F>uch perfect happine<U+017F><U+017F>e
be ever turned into <U+017F>uch unlook't for di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters. Then <U+017F>tanding in a mute po<U+017F>ture, admiring
the <U+017F>trange difference between his life pa<U+017F>t, and this pre<U+017F>ent: Nay, nay, (<U+017F>aid he) never
<U+017F>tand wondering at the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F><U+017F>e of the alteration; but rather wonder, that <U+017F>uch a
change <U+017F>hould be, and yet <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>hould live, <U+017F>ince he hath lo<U+017F>t all that can make life
<U+017F>weet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> in the mean time, who had not clo<U+017F>ed an eye all the night, no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>pied the
fir<U+017F>t blu<U+017F>h of Aurora, but <U+017F>he quitted her Bad, dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>te, and
went with all diligence to find out her Companions, who being le<U+017F><U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate upon the
journey then <U+017F>he, had pa<U+017F>t away the night with le<U+017F><U+017F>e inquietude and more re<U+017F>t; And
though in her way thither <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied <hi>Silvander</hi> in the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> lying down under
the Pillar, yet lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e time, <U+017F>he would not <U+017F>peak unto him, but ha<U+017F>ted away
towards her Companions, whom <U+017F>he imagined to find <U+017F>leeping, and whom <U+017F>he intended
to ha<U+017F>ten. And indeed <U+017F>he did find them all a<U+017F>leep, <U+017F>he awaked them, called them <U+017F>lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards,
and to prompt them unto more ha<U+017F>t, pulled the clothes off their beds, and made them
wonder at her forwardne<U+017F><U+017F>e, but the vehemency of her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion might plead her excu<U+017F>e: Oh
<hi>Silvander,</hi> how much beholding had<U+017F>t thou been unto this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, had <U+017F>he brought
thee along with her to be witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of this Act, in pulling off the Clothes from them?
Judge what effects <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ight would have cau<U+017F>ed in thee, <U+017F>ince <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>eeing tho<U+017F>e beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in that po<U+017F>ture, was ravi<U+017F>hed with admiration at them, and with a <U+017F>igh, <U+017F>aid, Ah
<hi>Diana,</hi> had you been the third in the Temple, certainly <hi>Celadon</hi> would have be<U+017F>towed
the Apple upon you. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) You are this morning in <U+017F>uch a mood,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53527:4"/>
as I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect your judgement: And as for matter of beauty, I cannot pretend
unto it: As I was comming hither (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) I <U+017F>aw one who I am <U+017F>ure is of another
opinion; and had you <U+017F>een him as I did in the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> with folded armes, and
eyes lifted up to heaven, you would have better believed what I <U+017F>ay. I know (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>)
that you <U+017F>peak of <hi>Silvander:</hi> but <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, I know again that what he does, is but fained,
and upon a wager; Fictions, replyed <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> doe never cau<U+017F>e reall pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions; and call me
the mo<U+017F>t ignorant per<U+017F>on that lives, if <hi>Silvander</hi> doe not mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately love you, and
if his affection, treat him as you will, doe not accompany him to his Grave; for melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
per<U+017F>ons who are <U+017F>low and long before they do love, when once the flame is kindled,
it will never be extingui<U+017F>ht in them. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) that when this
wager fir<U+017F>t began, I had the <U+017F>ame apprehen<U+017F>ions. And but becau<U+017F>e you would needs have it
<U+017F>o, I <U+017F>hould not have con<U+017F>ented unto it, knowing very well how dangerous the<U+017F>e fictions
are: but <U+017F>ince the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of this <U+017F>hepheard proceeds from the permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion which you have
obtained for him from me, I am re<U+017F>olved that this <U+017F>hall be the la<U+017F>t day he <U+017F>hall have leave
to continue his Court<U+017F>hip; for I will give judgement betweene <hi>Phillis</hi> and him in the
pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leonide;</hi> the three moneths are determined, and I have deferred
it only out of de<U+017F>ire that the Nymphs might <U+017F>ee the conclu<U+017F>ion of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, as <U+017F>he hath
the beginning. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> being unwilling to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her, was <U+017F>ilent; but <hi>Phillis</hi> began,
Good <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, doe you think that when your judgement is given, if he doe love
you, he will then cea<U+017F>e? I believe (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana</hi>) that he will not then talke to me
as he hath done; and if he doe love me, the trouble of it will be his own. Oh <hi>Diana,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Phillis;</hi> you are mi<U+017F>taken: for now you may put it off by <U+017F>aying, that what he does
is onely to make good his wager; but when this excu<U+017F>e is taken away, you will be then
obliged to receive his language as in good earne<U+017F>t. What you <U+017F>ay, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> is very
true; but let me tell you, that if he give me any language but what is fitting, I <U+017F>hall give
him an<U+017F>wers as <U+017F>hall keep him from any replies. Upon this <hi>Phillis</hi> began to laugh; My
deare Companion, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, we have <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome put on <U+017F>uch re<U+017F>olutions, who have been
forced to alteration: for tell me, I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould continue in his addre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
after your charge to the contrary, what then? would you kill him for his di<U+017F>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
I would not kill him, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> but I will give him <U+017F>uch language as if he
did love me, he would feare offending me; and if he did not love me, let him doe what he
will, he will be weary of it quickly. Nay on the contrary, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> If he doe not
love you, he will not care how much he di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>eth you; and if he love you, his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will not let him obey you in any thing which <U+017F>hall cro<U+017F><U+017F>e his love: for, <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, be a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that a violent affection may perhaps be thwarted, but never entirely eradicated.
Perhaps he will for a time obey your <U+017F>evere commands, but ere long he will ca<U+017F>t off all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderations,
and like a Torrent which is <U+017F>topped in its cour<U+017F>e, will at la<U+017F>t overflow its
own banks, and all the fields about it: So I <U+017F>ay, your forbiddance may for a time be a
<U+017F>toppage unto the <U+017F>tream of his violencies; but his affection will at la<U+017F>t break down all
before it, and overflow all your commands that ob<U+017F>truct it, and perhaps with <U+017F>uch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
as every one <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee it. If it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o fall out, as you may very well expect it will,
what can you doe more, but <U+017F>till renew your fir<U+017F>t forbiddances? Perhaps your language
will be more <U+017F>harp, but alas, words are but words, and too weak to give a check unto one
that really loves, as I believe <hi>Silvander</hi> does. Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> faintly) I never yet met
with any <U+017F>uch ob<U+017F>tinate Lovers which you <U+017F>peak of; and when I doe, I <U+017F>hall find out a
way to be rid from them: Heaven has not made us <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable, but though they have
denyed us <U+017F>trength, yet have they given us prudence enough to pre<U+017F>erve our <U+017F>elves.</p>
                  <p>Thus the<U+017F>e faire <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed while they were dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves; and
when they were ready, they went towards the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> where they were all to
rendezvous; then to go unto the Temple of the good Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and from thence to
<hi>Alexis. Silvander</hi> was before all the re<U+017F>t, finding no contentment, but when he <U+017F>aw
<hi>Diana.</hi> When they came there, this <U+017F>hepheard was <U+017F>inging, and was <U+017F>o rapt up in his own
imagination, as though they were very near him, yet he perceived them not. <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>eeing
him in this condition; <U+017F>he knew very well that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> had <U+017F>poken truth, and
that he prepared him<U+017F>elf for a great Combat with her; who <U+017F>ince the death of <hi>Philander,</hi>
had never any <U+017F>park of good will unto any man but this <U+017F>hepheard but not enduring that
<hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve her, being a per<U+017F>on altogether unknown <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved upon extream
rigor again<U+017F>t the affection of this <U+017F>hepheard; and perhaps, <U+017F>omething again<U+017F>t her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.
Whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was in the<U+017F>e thoughts, <hi>Phillis</hi> who loved <hi>Silvander</hi> for cau<U+017F>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53527:5"/>
the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Lycidas</hi> to vani<U+017F>h. She pittied him, and turning towards <hi>Diana,</hi> whi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
thus in her eare; I doe ingeniou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s, that this <U+017F>hepheard does love
you better then I doe, and I am affraid that if you be judge the cau<U+017F>e will go again<U+017F>t me.
<hi>Dianas</hi> mind being directed another way, <U+017F>he did not reply, but as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Silvander</hi> had
done <U+017F>inging; How now <U+017F>hepheard, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi> unto him, doe you value this company
<U+017F>o little, that you will not daign them a look? <hi>Silvander</hi> being rou<U+017F>ed out of his deep
thoughts, by this voice, as out of a profound <U+017F>leep, he <U+017F>tarted up, and <U+017F>aluted the <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>es.
I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) that <hi>Phillis</hi> hath obliged me, though perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to her intention. Your ingratitude, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> is <U+017F>uch towards me,
as I <U+017F>hall never advi<U+017F>e any to oblige you, <U+017F>ince you doe <U+017F>o ill acknowledge it; doe you
thanke me thus for adverti<U+017F>ing you of your duty, and for bringing her unto you whom
you <U+017F>ay you love? methinkes common civility <U+017F>hould prompt you unto a more hand<U+017F>ome
acknowledgement then this. <hi>Phillis,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> you put me in mind of tho<U+017F>e
Cowes, who when they have filled the Paile with milk, doe throw it downe with their
foot; for when you had in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort obliged me, you cancell the obligation by upbraiding
me with it. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that what you have done does merit acknowledgement, but
what acknowledgement is due? the very <U+017F>ame that <hi>Diana</hi> u<U+017F>eth unto her little Dogge
<hi>Driope,</hi> when he hath done any thing which plea<U+017F>eth her; and if you aske her, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<U+017F>he gives him, <U+017F>he will tell you, that <U+017F>he onely chocks him under the chin, and
<U+017F>trokes him half a dozen times upon the back; and <U+017F>ince you have done no more for me,
methinkes you <U+017F>hould be content with the <U+017F>ame paiment. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> could not
chu<U+017F>e but laugh at his merry an<U+017F>wer. Upon which <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>tepped towards her, and
offered to <U+017F>troke her as <hi>Diana</hi> did her Dogge; but <U+017F>he pu<U+017F>hed him away, and with a frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
look, <U+017F>aid unto him. If you u<U+017F>e to pay your debts with <U+017F>uch money, I believe all your
Creditors will ca<U+017F>t you off as I doe, <U+017F>ince your payment is <U+017F>o bad but, ungrateful per<U+017F>on,
you cannot deny your Obligation unto me to be great, for changing your melancholly
thoughts into a <U+017F>ight of the fair <hi>Diana.</hi> This Obligation, <U+017F>aid he, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e to
be very great, if it was done intentionally; but it was done with a quite contrary de<U+017F>igne,
becau<U+017F>e all that proceeds from an enemy may well be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected. What ill de<U+017F>igne could I
have in it, replyed <hi>Phillis?</hi> Perhaps you thought, <U+017F>aid he, that the <U+017F>everity of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
would more perplex me then my melancholly thoughts; or becau<U+017F>e you know that the
more one <U+017F>ees the per<U+017F>on loved, the more is love augmented; you thought there was no
<U+017F>peedier way to kill me, then by the <U+017F>ight of this faire <U+017F>hepheard<U+017F><U+017F>e. But <hi>Phillis,</hi> doe
not think that I will ever <U+017F>hrink from <U+017F>uch a death, <U+017F>ince I am <U+017F>ure I cannot avoid it, and
<U+017F>ince no life can be more de<U+017F>ireable then <U+017F>uch a death is.</p>
                  <p>This di<U+017F>pute had la<U+017F>ted longer between this <U+017F>hepheard and <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, had they
not <U+017F>een a company coming towards them, and very neare; all with intentions of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Silvander;</hi> Oh, my good friend, <U+017F>aid he unto him, I <U+017F>ee that here is not
one in all the company that knows how to love but I for if there was you would not thus
trifle away your time, but go pre<U+017F>ently to the faire <hi>Alexis.</hi> I believe, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi>
that we <U+017F>hall be there time enough to imploy all your Con<U+017F>tancy: No, no, replied <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi>
he has all the rea<U+017F>on in the world to make ha<U+017F>te, otherwi<U+017F>e there would be <U+017F>ome
danger, le<U+017F>t the end of his love <U+017F>hould be before the beginning of our journey. Perhaps
you think (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that you have given me a notable check, in <U+017F>aying, that I doe
never love any long, but I take it as one of the greate<U+017F>t commendations you can give me.
For good <hi>Silvander</hi> tell me, Is not he that goes as much ground in an hour, as another
does in a whole day, is not he, I <U+017F>ay, the be<U+017F>t Footman? and a Ma<U+017F>on that builds a Hou<U+017F>e
in a moneth, which another will not undertake under a whole yeare, is not he the be<U+017F>t
Workman? If you will make your love a Lackey (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander</hi>) I <U+017F>hall think the fa<U+017F>ter
it goes, the better it is; But as for your Ma<U+017F>on, let me tell you <hi>Hylas,</hi> that he who makes
mo<U+017F>t ha<U+017F>te is not the be<U+017F>t workman, but he who does his work the be<U+017F>t, does be<U+017F>t de<U+017F>erve that
name: for mo<U+017F>t ha<U+017F>te makes wor<U+017F>e work, and often <U+017F>poils all. <hi>Hylas</hi> would have replied,
when all the Company began to <U+017F>et forward towards the Temple of the good Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
where <hi>Chry<U+017F>ante</hi> expected them at Dinner: for that venerable <hi>Druid</hi> under<U+017F>tanding their
determination, and being de<U+017F>irous to vi<U+017F>it the faire <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>he invited them all unto
her hou<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he might make one of their company: this reque<U+017F>t, which was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto them, was not denyed, and therefore <hi>Silvander</hi> left the incon<U+017F>tant <hi>Hylas</hi> to wait
upon <hi>Diana,</hi> being exceedingly glad of this opportunity of being with her when <hi>Paris</hi>
was not. Had the di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Alexis</hi> looked the right way, <U+017F>he might ea<U+017F>ily have <U+017F>een them
come from the field of <hi>Mercury;</hi> for the Grove where <U+017F>he was, <U+017F>urveyed the place; but
her eyes were <U+017F>o fixed upon the place where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> dwelt, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood like a <U+017F>tatue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing
no <U+017F>ignes that <U+017F>he was alive, but onely breathing or rather <U+017F>ighing.</p>
                  <p>She had longer <U+017F>tood in this mu<U+017F>ing po<U+017F>ture, if <hi>Leonide</hi> had not diverted her: this
Nymph not being able to extingui<U+017F>h her flames of affection towards <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>he was
<U+017F>o much delighted in the company of <hi>Alexis,</hi> that <U+017F>he was ab<U+017F>ent from him as little as
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he could. The wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas</hi> having the words of <hi>Silvia</hi> <U+017F>till fre<U+017F>h in his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
though he knew well enough what ardent affection that <U+017F>hepheard had unto the faire
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> yet did he live in much perplexity, knowing very well that his Neece was not <U+017F>o
disfurni<U+017F>hed of natures gifts, but that <U+017F>he might in time worke upon a young heart, and
make it forget all re<U+017F>pects of loyalty and duty.</p>
                  <p>This con<U+017F>ideration was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong in him, that <U+017F>he would never have permitted this
young <U+017F>hepheard to enter his hou<U+017F>e, under the habit name and motion of his Daughter
<hi>Alexis,</hi> had not the Oracle made a promi<U+017F>e unto him, that when <hi>Celadon</hi> did enjoy his
contentment, his age <U+017F>hould then be happy; <U+017F>o as being intere<U+017F>ted in point of happine<U+017F><U+017F>e,
he cho<U+017F>e rather to take <U+017F>o much paines to watch the actions of them both, then to lo<U+017F>e
that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which the Heavens had promi<U+017F>ed. Now becau<U+017F>e he could not have his
eye alwayes upon them, in re<U+017F>pect his dome<U+017F>tique and publique affaires invited him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
way; he charged <hi>Paris</hi> to be pre<U+017F>ent with them as much as he could.</p>
                  <p>This morning when he heard they were both gone out of the hou<U+017F>e, and that <hi>Paris</hi>
was not with them, he went immediately after them, and followed his Neece <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, as
he was in the Grove almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oone as <U+017F>hee, where <hi>Alexis</hi> had beene along while enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
her thoughts: the noi<U+017F>e which the Nimphs made as <U+017F>he came cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Celadon</hi> to
looke that way, and as he turned he <U+017F>pyed the Druide comming, unto whom <U+017F>he bore
<U+017F>o much re<U+017F>pective reverence, that though <U+017F>he had rather have beene alone entertaining
his thoughts of <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> yet <U+017F>eeming otherwi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he went to meet him, and bid him good
morrow with a countenance of joy more then accu<U+017F>tomed; of which <hi>Adamas</hi> taking
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53527:6"/>
notice, after his morning <U+017F>alute, he told her that her countenance of jollity did pre<U+017F>age
but a bad conclu<U+017F>ion of the day. If it plea<U+017F>e, good Father, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> you <U+017F>hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
contentment by it; for as for me, I have no hopes but in death; and if you did
ob<U+017F>erve me with a merrier countenance then ordinary, it is becau<U+017F>e I thinke my <U+017F>elfe
every day neerer the end of that torment which Fortune hath ordained for mee; imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in this, tho<U+017F>e who are in a long and tedious journey, who when they come to their
Inn at night, are plea<U+017F>ed to thinke that <U+017F>o much of their paines is le<U+017F><U+017F>ened; the Druide
returned this cold an<U+017F>wer; My dear Child, tho<U+017F>e who do live without hope of comfort
in their mi<U+017F>eries, doe not only offend again<U+017F>t the Providence of great <hi>Tautates,</hi> but al<U+017F>o
again<U+017F>t the prudence of them who have the Guardian<U+017F>hip of them. In this occa<U+017F>ion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have a double cau<U+017F>e of Complaint again<U+017F>t you: you have offended both the Gods
and Mee, as Druide of the Country, into who<U+017F>e hands the Oracle hath committed you.
Father, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> I <U+017F>hould be extreamly <U+017F>orry, <U+017F>hould I offend either the great
<hi>Tautates</hi> or you; and for an explanation of my words, give me leave to tell you that
my intention was not to doubt either in the Providence of our great Gods, or in your
Prudence; but I doe beleeve it is not the will of the Gods to give me any contentment as
long as I live, and that my misfortune is <U+017F>o great as it is beyond all humane Prudence to
helpe it. You mu<U+017F>t know, replyed <hi>Adamas;</hi> that the <U+017F>lighting of a benefit received, does
often withdraw the hand of the Benefactor, and makes it more <U+017F>lacke in conferring then
it was before; take heed you provoke not the Heavens unto the like for you doe <U+017F>o ill
accept of what they have begun to doe for you, as you have rea<U+017F>on to feare, that in
lieu of happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, they will inflict new puni<U+017F>hments. Doe you not con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that when
you had mured up your <U+017F>elfe in a Salvage Rocke, the Gods <U+017F>ent <hi>Silvander</hi> with con<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
unto you? Then, to make their goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e more apparent unto you; did not he
cau<U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> her <U+017F>elfe to come unto you? Did you not <U+017F>ee her; nay, almo<U+017F>t hear her, and
the Lamentations <U+017F>he made for you? what better beginnings of happine<U+017F><U+017F>e could
you po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly hope for then the<U+017F>e: I will not in<U+017F>tance the vi<U+017F>its of <hi>Leonide</hi> and my <U+017F>elfe,
for perhaps they were trouble<U+017F>ome unto you; but I may well mention the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of
the Gods to you, in in<U+017F>piring mee to bring you unto my hou<U+017F>e, under the notion and
habit of my Daughter <hi>Alexis,</hi> for doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e it is her whom <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> comes to <U+017F>ee:
What more au<U+017F>pitious beginning can you have then this? Can you imagine, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the particular aide and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Gods, this habit and di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e could delude
the eyes of <U+017F>o many per<U+017F>ons? All the people of your owne Towne, your friends, your
familiars, have <U+017F>een you, and been deceived; your owne Brother him<U+017F>elfe is mi<U+017F>taken;
but the favours of <hi>Tautates</hi> re<U+017F>t not here: for hee in<U+017F>pired <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> to come and <U+017F>ee you:
what can you de<U+017F>ire more for a pro<U+017F>perous beginning? Yet I <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>uch is your ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
that <U+017F>till you complain, or at lea<U+017F>t receive not the<U+017F>e benefits with a thankefull heart.
Take heed Child, you provoke not a Diety too <U+017F>arre, lea<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould withdraw the<U+017F>e
favours, and give you a ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of condolement. Father, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> I doe mo<U+017F>t
gratefully acknowledge the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Tautates,</hi> and your indulgent care over mee;
but <U+017F>till I cannot chu<U+017F>e but complaine; for I am yet like unto a poore afflicted man, who
hath a thou<U+017F>and torments at once upon him; though one or two of tho<U+017F>e torments be
taken away, yet the re<U+017F>t which remaine are enough to move complaint. The Druide
was ready to an<U+017F>wer when he <U+017F>aw <hi>Paris</hi> coming towards them, who being clad in his
<U+017F>hepherds habit, made it manife<U+017F>t that Love prompted unto the dre<U+017F><U+017F>e. <hi>Leonide</hi> al<U+017F>o flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
her <U+017F>elfe in an opinion that her beauty needed not to <U+017F>ubmit unto the beauty of
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed all her art, and trimmed up her <U+017F>elfe to the be<U+017F>t advantage that <hi>Alexis</hi>
<U+017F>eeing her in that dre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and comparing <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> with her, the artificiall lu<U+017F>tre of the one,
might dimme the naturall <U+017F>implicity of the others beauty. <hi>Alexis</hi> in her u<U+017F>uall habit
<U+017F>eemed to care lea<U+017F>t for this vi<U+017F>it, though <U+017F>he had the mo<U+017F>t intere<U+017F>t, and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired
not to be knowne by any, <U+017F>hee added nothing to her ordinary dre<U+017F><U+017F>e; be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>he
knew that her happine<U+017F><U+017F>e was to be expected from fortune and not beauty: but however,
<U+017F>he appeared <U+017F>o fair in that <U+017F>imple habit without any artifice, that <hi>Leonide</hi> could not keep
her eyes off her.</p>
                  <p>After <U+017F>ome common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <hi>Paris</hi> who was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love with <hi>Diana,</hi> to
make him<U+017F>elfe more plea<U+017F>ing in her eye, he a<U+017F><U+017F>umed the habit of a <U+017F>hepherd; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
furni<U+017F>hed with <U+017F>o much patience as to <U+017F>tay till their coming, he told <hi>Adamas,</hi> that
if it plea<U+017F>ed him, he would goe and meet tho<U+017F>e fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, who were to vi<U+017F>it his
Si<U+017F>ter, and conduct them to the be<U+017F>t and neere<U+017F>t way. The <hi>Druide</hi> knowing what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53527:6"/>
he had unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and not di<U+017F>allowing it for <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons, which hereafter <U+017F>hall
be declared, did commend his de<U+017F>igne, hinting unto him that courte<U+017F>ie and civility, of all
the vertues did mo<U+017F>t attract the hearts of people, and that it was the naturall quality of
per<U+017F>ons well borne. <hi>Paris</hi> upon this leave went pre<U+017F>ently towards <hi>Lignon,</hi> and going down
the Hill unto the bridge of Botere<U+017F><U+017F>e, he followed the River, taking into a little path upon
his right hand, which led him into the Wood, where the empty tombe of <hi>Celadon</hi> was
erected; and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing on he came unto the Meadow which is before the Temple of <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi>
He had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>et foot in it, but he <U+017F>pyed on the other <U+017F>ide of it two Hor<U+017F>emen, the
one of which was armed; he had on his right hand a Gantlet, and on the other a Buckler,
a Plume of black and white, which waved over the Crupper of his Hor<U+017F>e, his Cor<U+017F>let was
<U+017F>et with Lions, his Sword Falchion like, which turned up at the end like to a demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle,
hung by his <U+017F>ide in a rich <U+017F>carfe.</p>
                  <p>As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Paris</hi> perceived him, he remembred what hapned unto <hi>Diana</hi> when <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidas</hi>
and <hi>Filander</hi> were <U+017F>laine, and therefore retreated into the Wood, yet being very
de<U+017F>irous to know more of them, he <U+017F>till kept his eye upon them through the thick Wood.
He <U+017F>aw that as <U+017F>oone as they were entred into the Meadow and <U+017F>pyed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant
Fountaine, which is at the entrance into the Temple; the Cavelier lighted from his
Hor<U+017F>e, and the other whom he judged to be his Servant, ran to him, held his <U+017F>tirrop,
tooke his Hor<U+017F>e, unbridled him, and without any re<U+017F>pect unto the place, let him eat
upon the <U+017F>acred Gra<U+017F><U+017F>e: Meane while the Cavelier went to the Fountaine; dranke of
the water, and wa<U+017F>hed his hands and face. <hi>Paris</hi> by his deportment did imagine that
his intention was not to offer harme unto any, and this opinion made him <U+017F>o bold as to
go neerer him, yet <U+017F>till concealing him<U+017F>elfe in the thicke Wood; <U+017F>o as he un<U+017F>een came
<U+017F>o neere them, that he could both heare and <U+017F>ee all that they <U+017F>aid and did: He <U+017F>aw that
the Cavalier was both young and faire, though extreame <U+017F>orrow appeared in his face;
then looking upon his Armes, he thought him to be a <hi>Gaule,</hi> and that he was in
love: for he bore upon his <U+017F>ilver Sheild a <hi>Tyger</hi> feeding upon a Hart, with
this Motto.
<q>Thou gav'<U+017F>t me death, and I maintaine thy life.</q>

miles from the matter, <U+017F>o as he moved all that knew him unto pitty, and others to
laughter; love being the cau<U+017F>e of his di<U+017F>traction, all his follies harped upon that <U+017F>tring;
and when his good intervalls were upon him, his complaint was all upon the obduracy
of <hi>Doris,</hi> the inju<U+017F>tice of <hi>Leonide,</hi> the good fortune of <hi>Palemon,</hi> and his owne mi<U+017F>ery.
The<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers li<U+017F>tned unto him, but could hardly under<U+017F>tand what he <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>ince not one

<hi>Ara<U+017F>tes</hi> <U+017F>eeing the Cavelier, and his minde running all upon love, did an<U+017F>wer him:
Sir, <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o infinitely faire, that no mortal can equall her, and <hi>Palemon</hi> hath ravi<U+017F>hed her
from me. The Cavelier replyed, who is that <hi>Palemon? Palemon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard,
is <hi>Palemon;</hi> yes, yes, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>tranger, I know that is his name: but what is he, of what
quality? At this que<U+017F>tion, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> was a little troubled, and looking wildly upon the
Cavelier, he an<U+017F>wered, <hi>Palemon</hi> is one whom <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> does not love. And <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> <U+017F>aid

laughter, and in conclu<U+017F>ion, began to cry, <U+017F>aying, the Nimph has wronged me;
<hi>Doris</hi> at the beginning cryed, then went away; and though I called her back, yet <U+017F>he
would not <U+017F>o much as look back upon me, was ever any thus u<U+017F>ed? The Cavelier was
at fir<U+017F>t amazed at his language, and plainly <U+017F>aw that he was di<U+017F>tracted, and thinking love
to be the cau<U+017F>e, he pittied him; then turning towards his <U+017F>ervant, <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid he, what will
be my fortune, if I doe not die: for certainly this <U+017F>hepheard is run mad for love. Love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> is as mad as either. For <hi>Palemon</hi> if he were not, <hi>Doris</hi> would either have
been here, or I where <U+017F>he is. Thus he roved into <U+017F>uch odd impertinencies, that <hi>Halladine</hi>
could not forbeare laughing, which the Knight perceiving, Thou dost laugh at this poore

<hi>Paris</hi> ob<U+017F>erved that neither <hi>Madonthe</hi> nor <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> were in the company,

was this morning very ill di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, and that <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> kept her company. I <U+017F>hould

and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> to look well unto them<U+017F>elves. <hi>Silvander</hi> who had alwaies an eye

virtues, he took upon him to acquaint them at his return, <hi>Laonice</hi> who watched for an

began to have <U+017F>ome <U+017F>parkes of good will towards this <U+017F>hepheard, did take notice of it,

le<U+017F>t the reverent <hi>Chry<U+017F>ante</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay too long, all the Company <U+017F>et forward. <hi>Diana</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<hi>Phillis</hi> to be alwaies near her, le<U+017F>t being alone, <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>hould fall into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of

her by the arme. <hi>Calidon</hi> waited upon <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <hi>Tircis</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> kept together;
as for <hi>Hylas,</hi> he undertook no body, but was <U+017F>ometimes the fir<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>ometimes the la<U+017F>t
of the company, without fixing him<U+017F>elfe unto any of the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es; he took no more
regard of <hi>Phillis,</hi> then if he had never <U+017F>een her in his life; at which <hi>Tireis</hi> admired, and
after a little con<U+017F>ideration of it, he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>ay aloud unto him; Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
<hi>Hylas,</hi> that you <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o near <hi>Phillis,</hi> and take no notice of her? <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>eeming as

                  <p>Beauty then is the cau<U+017F>e, and if <U+017F>o, why may we not impute it unto the Gods without

to affirme that it <U+017F>hould be the cau<U+017F>e of incon<U+017F>tancy, is an errour, as if one <U+017F>hould accu<U+017F>e

which commands every one to aime at the be<U+017F>t: take heed <hi>Hylas</hi> that it be not of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved

you thinke the<U+017F>e to be advantages, I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e you have <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to court them; but
if you will credit Judgements which are not infected with your owne di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, you will

was your only enemy; but now methinkes <hi>Tircis</hi> hath <U+017F>upplyed his place. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
my late Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas</hi>) for it is very ordinary to <U+017F>ee ill opinions take
hold upon ignorant per<U+017F>ons: <hi>Tircis</hi> would have replyed, had he not beene prevented by
poore <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> who being come into the Wood, they <U+017F>aw talking unto Trees and Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
as if they had beene people of his acquaintance: <U+017F>ometimes he fancied that he
<U+017F>aw <hi>Doris,</hi> and then kneeling downe upon the ground he adored her, and as if he were
begging for the favour of a ki<U+017F><U+017F>e of her hand, he made a long <U+017F>peech: <U+017F>ometimes againe
he fancied that he <U+017F>aw <hi>Leonide,</hi> and then he rayled and wi<U+017F>hed her all manner of bad
Fortune: but when he fancied <hi>Palemon,</hi> the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his jealou<U+017F>ie was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant;
for though it was very confu<U+017F>ed, yet it gave good evidence of the grandure of his
affection. The company pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed clo<U+017F>e by him, and though the very <U+017F>ight of him moved
every one to pitty, yet much more when he <U+017F>pyed <hi>Doris,</hi> becau<U+017F>e then he <U+017F>tood immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
like a Pillar; his eyes fixed upon her, and his armes a cro<U+017F><U+017F>e his bre<U+017F>t, without a word,
as if he were ravi<U+017F>hed. Afterwards pointing at her with his finger, when <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by
him, he <U+017F>aid with a deep <U+017F>igh; <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>ee where <U+017F>he is; then fixing his eyes upon her, hee
never moved them as long as he could <U+017F>ee her: but when he began to lo<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ight of
her, he began to run untill he was before her; then he looked upon none in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
but her, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>ilently looking upon her, he accompanied her unto the outgoing
of the Wood, for farther he dur<U+017F>t not pa<U+017F><U+017F>e: when he lo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ight of her, he began to
cry out: Adieu <hi>Palemon,</hi> make much of <hi>Doris,</hi> and upon this he ru<U+017F>hed into the Wood,
where he almo<U+017F>t alwayes was, becau<U+017F>e that was the place where <hi>Leonide</hi> gave judgement
again<U+017F>t him. Every one pittyed him except <hi>Hylas,</hi> who pre<U+017F>ently began to laugh, and
turning towards <hi>Silvander;</hi> This Shepherd, <U+017F>aid he unto him, is an effect of that con<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
which you commend <U+017F>o much; which of us two doe you thinke is in mo<U+017F>t danger
to re<U+017F>emble him? Complexions mo<U+017F>t perfect (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander</hi>) are mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
but to chu<U+017F>e I had rather be like <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> then like <hi>Hylas.</hi> The choice of the
one, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> is in your power; but not of the other: How doe you meane it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander?</hi>
The meaning <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi> is nothing difficult: my meaning is, that if you
will you may become a foole like <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> your humour is inclinable to it, but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
re<U+017F>emble <hi>Hylas.</hi> In this, you are mo<U+017F>t deceived, replyed <hi>Silvander;</hi> For things that
depend upon the will may be in choice, but things that depend upon the will of another
are more difficult; and therefore every one that will, may be either vertuous or vitious<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
but they cannot be well or <U+017F>icke when they will: now the condition wherein poore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra<U+017F>tes</hi>
is, it is not voluntary, but forced, as proceeding from a malady, the remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
which is not in his hands, but your malady depends wholly upon your will; <U+017F>o
as it is demon<U+017F>trative by rea<U+017F>on, that it is an ea<U+017F>ier matter to re<U+017F>emble you, then that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erable

I will, I can deliver my <U+017F>elfe from my malady as you call it, then to re<U+017F>emble <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi>
who cannot free him<U+017F>elfe from his? Tis true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> but if you doe leave

re<U+017F>emble <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> then <hi>Hylas;</hi> that is, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> the mad, than <hi>Hylas</hi> the incon<U+017F>tant.
Truly, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and interrupted them) you pre<U+017F><U+017F>e too hard upon my late Servant;
I mu<U+017F>t needs take his part and <U+017F>ay, that incon<U+017F>tancy is better then madne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince it does
not take away the u<U+017F>e of rea<U+017F>on, which doth onely di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h men from bea<U+017F>ts: you are
mi<U+017F>taken Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander</hi>) for the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of <hi>Hylas</hi> and that of <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi>
are both of them reall maladies; but that of <hi>Hylas</hi> is the wor<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e all maladies of
<U+017F>oule, are wor<U+017F>e than tho<U+017F>e of the body. As for the rea<U+017F>on which you urge, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable,
for if the cau<U+017F>e of a malady doe proceed from <U+017F>ome defect in the body, yet that
body may <U+017F>till be rea<U+017F>onable as we <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e who are intoxicated with Wine; now the
malady of <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> doeth doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e proceed from the weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his braine which is
not able to endure the <U+017F>entence which <hi>Leonide</hi> gave again<U+017F>t him; but that of <hi>Hylas</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from an imperfect judgement, which hinders him from di<U+017F>cerning good from bad,
but <U+017F>uffers vices to become habituall. And becau<U+017F>e it is the rea<U+017F>onable <U+017F>oule which gives
being unto men, and makes them differ from bea<U+017F>ts, it is better according to your own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to be un<U+017F>ound in body than in <U+017F>oule; 'tis better to be a han<U+017F>ome Hor<U+017F>e or a Dog,
then to be the bare out<U+017F>ide of a man; without a <U+017F>ound <U+017F>oule, becau<U+017F>e a Hor<U+017F>e is a perfect

                  <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> under pretence of helping the <hi>Heduois</hi> whom they termed their
friends and confederates, did <U+017F>eize upon <hi>Gaule,</hi> and <U+017F>ubjected them unto their Republique;
one principall marke of their victory was to cau<U+017F>e their Gods to be adored in all places
of their u<U+017F>urpation; not thinking them<U+017F>elves intire po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ors, if they did not intere<U+017F>t
their Gods, and oblige them to their pre<U+017F>ervation; and yet le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
in<U+017F>upportable at the fir<U+017F>t, they permitted the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who adored but one God,
under the names of <hi>Tautates, He<U+017F>ius, Tharames</hi> and <hi>Bellinus,</hi> to u<U+017F>e their ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomes,
and live in their old Religion; knowing very well that nothing is more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
to men, then tyrannically to force their beliefe. And therefore when they entred
into the Dominions of the <hi>Segu<U+017F>ians,</hi> they would not alter any of their Cu<U+017F>tomes,
Manners, Government or Religion. But when they found in this <U+017F>acred Grove an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
dedicated unto a Virgin who <U+017F>hould have a Child, and that Divinity <U+017F>erved by the
Daughters of Druids, they had much more re<U+017F>pect unto it, thinking that place was
con<U+017F>ecrated under another name, either unto the good Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (in who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervice men
could not officiate) or unto the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Ve<U+017F>ta,</hi> in who<U+017F>e Temple they were wont to
place a <U+017F>tatute of a Virgin, holding a Child in her Arms: Having this opinion, not to
le<U+017F><U+017F>en the honour and <U+017F>ervice which they rendred unto the<U+017F>e two Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es, whom they
held in great reverence; they built a Temple unto them both, with two Altars alike,
and to the honour of the good Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, they called it <hi>Bonleia,</hi> and to the honour
of <hi>Ve<U+017F>ta,</hi> they are called <hi>Ve<U+017F>tals;</hi> and becau<U+017F>e the People were infinitely Religious
towards the Gods whom they adored, not knowing whether the<U+017F>e Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es would
be wor<U+017F>hipped after the manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> or the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and al<U+017F>o to content the
Inhabitants of the Country, they left the Virgin Druids to their ancient Cu<U+017F>tomes and
Ceremonies unto whom they gave all authority concerning manners and oeconomique
matters: And thus was the venerable <hi>Chry<U+017F>ante</hi> ab<U+017F>olute Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e of the Virgin Druids
and Ve<U+017F>tals.</p>
                  <p>This Temple was larger and more <U+017F>pacious then <U+017F>eemed to the eye, being built in an
orbicular <U+017F>ome; it was covered with lead: in the midde<U+017F>t and highe<U+017F>t part of it, was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53527:9"/>
erected a Statute of a Virgin holding a Childe in her Armes; in the mid<U+017F>t of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was placed two Altars, at <U+017F>uch equall di<U+017F>tance, that the one was no further from
the middle then the other; by the <U+017F>ide of either of them there <U+017F>tood an Arke of white
Marble, <U+017F>upported by three Columnes in which was put all the Fruites which
were offered; at the doore <U+017F>tood a Ba<U+017F>on of water which they called <hi>Lu<U+017F>trale,</hi> in
which the Torch which was at the Altar when divine Service was celebrated, was fir<U+017F>t
wa<U+017F>hed, and afterwards extingui<U+017F>hed.</p>
                  <p>When all this Company met the venerable <hi>Chry<U+017F>ante,</hi> it was <U+017F>o early as the morning
<U+017F>acrifice was not then begun; and therefore <U+017F>he invited all the faire <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es unto it,
telling the <U+017F>hepheards that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>orry to rob them of their good company: but <U+017F>he
was con<U+017F>trained unto it, by the inviolable Ordinance of the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, who commanded
that all men <U+017F>hould be bani<U+017F>hed tho<U+017F>e Altars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paris, Calidon,</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> who were mo<U+017F>t concerned, made an<U+017F>wer, That they were
<U+017F>orry for the <U+017F>hallow merits of men, <U+017F>ince that was the cau<U+017F>e which moved the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e
to thinke them unworthy of that honour, and be<U+017F>eeched her and them all, that they
would not entertaine in their hearts the like hatred again<U+017F>t men. To which, the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

of any hatred unto them but upon other re<U+017F>pects; and perhaps to make the Ve<U+017F>talls more
attentive in their devotions, and their minds not drawn another way by the <U+017F>ight of mens
perfections. <hi>Hylas</hi> who had no devotion unto the Gods of his own Country, and much
le<U+017F><U+017F>e unto tho<U+017F>e who were <U+017F>trangers unto him, made an<U+017F>wer; That if tho<U+017F>e Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es did
forbid him to love faire ones, <hi>Hylas</hi> would be none of their Votaries: Shepheard, <U+017F>aid the
venerable <hi>Chry<U+017F>ante,</hi> I advi<U+017F>e you not to provoke the Gods: Upon this word <U+017F>he retired
into the Temple, becau<U+017F>e one of the Ve<U+017F>tals, according to their cu<U+017F>tome, came and cryed

                  <p>The<U+017F>e ve<U+017F>tall Virgins were habited in white Robes, and <U+017F>o long behinde, that they
could vaile their heads therewith, when they went into the Temple to <U+017F>acrifice. This day
was dedicated unto Ve<U+017F>ta, for not to be <U+017F>urcharged with too many <U+017F>acrifices; their dayes
were to be divided, one day they <U+017F>acrificed unto Ve<U+017F>ta, and another unto the good
Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e. This day then being the Ve<U+017F>tals, as <U+017F>oon as the doores of the Temple were
<U+017F>hut, and all the ve<U+017F>tall Virgins, Druids and Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es had taken their places, they
all bowed to the ground; as <U+017F>oon as the chiefe Ve<U+017F>tall <U+017F>tood up, who taking in her hand
a branch of Laurell which a young Ve<U+017F>tall pre<U+017F>ented unto her, and which was dipped in

<U+017F>prinkled her <U+017F>elfe therewith, and afterwards did the <U+017F>ame unto all the Congregation,
who being all pro<U+017F>trate upon the ground, received this water with great devotion. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
being ri<U+017F>en up, and <U+017F>he returned to her <U+017F>eat, another young Virgin pre<U+017F>ented unto
her a basket full of flowers; <U+017F>he put one Pofie of them upon her head, and did the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<U+017F>ix others, who kneeled down at her feet, and who were to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t her in the <U+017F>acrifice;
one of them went pre<U+017F>ently, and tooke the Napkin and Ba<U+017F>on with which they were

                  <p>Being all thus before her, clo<U+017F>e to the Altar of Ve<U+017F>ta, before which <U+017F>he did pro<U+017F>trate her

a Taper in their hands, and walked two and two. The younge<U+017F>t went fir<U+017F>t, the elder next,
and afterwards the <U+017F>ix which carried the Chaplets of Flowers: la<U+017F>t of all, the chiefe Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tall
with her Pa<U+017F>torall <U+017F>taffe, and all the re<U+017F>t went about the Altar: Then every one went

the <U+017F>acrifice: Then <U+017F>he who carried the bundle of Vervine, laid it down on the left hand of
the Altar, where the fire was kept in day and night by two Ve<U+017F>tals, becau<U+017F>e if it went out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53527:10"/>
they thought <U+017F>ome great di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter would befall them. If ever the fire did extingui<U+017F>h, the
Ve<U+017F>tal that kept it was <U+017F>everely puni<U+017F>hed: then they kindled it againe with the rayes of
the Sun, which fire they e<U+017F>teemed Sacred. The other Ve<U+017F>tal, who carried the Flowers and
the fruits, did put them into the white Marble Ark, of which we <U+017F>poke before; and the
other four <U+017F>tayed with the chiefe Ve<U+017F>tal, who then pro<U+017F>trating her <U+017F>elfe before the Altar,
did with a loud voice confe<U+017F><U+017F>e her <U+017F>innes; then acknowledged that <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not approach
the <U+017F>acred Altar of that Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, being <U+017F>o defiled with <U+017F>innes; and that <U+017F>he was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to offer any thing that was plea<U+017F>ing unto her, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it was by her commandment.
Afterwards approaching nearer, <U+017F>he <U+017F>trewed the Altar all over with perfumes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen<U+017F>e,
which ca<U+017F>t a fragrant <U+017F>mell all over the Temple. Then turning her <U+017F>elfe towards the
Ea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he uttered in a di<U+017F>tinct voice, <U+017F>ome words which a Ve<U+017F>tal repeated unto her word
by word, reading them out of a Book, for fear of mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing, or bad pronunciation; for
<U+017F>hould any mi<U+017F>take fall out in them, they believe that the <U+017F>acrifices are not plea<U+017F>ing unto
the Godde<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>The words are the<U+017F>e,
<q>O Mo<U+017F>t renowned Godde<U+017F>s, Daughter of Great <hi>Rhea,</hi> and pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant <hi>Saturn,</hi> Ve<U+017F>ta, whom
the <hi>Thirrians</hi> do call <hi>Labith Horchia;</hi> Receive we be<U+017F>eech thee this devout Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which we offer unto unto thee for the people and Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the pre<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>At the la<U+017F>t words of this <U+017F>upplication, all the Virgins an<U+017F>wered, Amen. Afterwards
every one threw into the fire <U+017F>ome Incen<U+017F>e and Aromatique drugs; then the chief Ve<U+017F>tall
taking <U+017F>ome of the <U+017F>acred water, <U+017F>he <U+017F>prinkled the flowers, the fruits, and the fire with it:
All the<U+017F>e things being done, <U+017F>he went a little from the Altar, and began a Hymn in prai<U+017F>e
of the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and all the Ve<U+017F>tals, as a Chorus joyned with her. La<U+017F>tly, one, who
<U+017F>tood oppo<U+017F>ite to the chiefe Ve<U+017F>tal, pronounced in a loud voice, That it was permitted
them to depart; and <U+017F>o the <U+017F>acrifice ended.</p>
                  <p>Then the venerable <hi>Chry<U+017F>ante,</hi> who medled not with the Sacrifices, but onely as an
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant; <U+017F>he went out of the Temple, and all the re<U+017F>t, except the Ve<U+017F>tals; and went into
the <U+017F>acred Grove, where the Prophets and the Shepheards waited for them: the one <U+017F>ort,
to <U+017F>acrifice; but the other, as much out of devotion to the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, as unto their great
Tautates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hylas</hi> more impatient then any el<U+017F>e, out of his zealous de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee the faire <hi>Alexis,</hi> he
was con<U+017F>trained to be pre<U+017F>ent at the <U+017F>acrifice of the Prophets; but his prayer was, that
Tautates would be plea<U+017F>ed this once, to be contented with <U+017F>hort Ceremonies, that he
might be going his de<U+017F>ired vi<U+017F>it: and indeed as <U+017F>oon as the la<U+017F>t word of the <U+017F>acrifice was
pronounced, he ro<U+017F>e up, and forced all the company to doe the like. He was as ha<U+017F>ty al<U+017F>o

tell you upon the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, that where <hi>Alexis</hi> is, there is the be<U+017F>t company for me. And
to make my words good by my actions, if you do not go ju<U+017F>t now, you <U+017F>hall have no
more of the company of <hi>Hylas,</hi> Upon this, making a low reverence, he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe
to be gone, when all the company flocked about him, and would have <U+017F>tayed him
by force. While<U+017F>t he was <U+017F>triving to e<U+017F>cape their hands, a Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger came unto <hi>Chry<U+017F>ante</hi>

which <U+017F>he had. This me<U+017F><U+017F>age cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Hylas</hi> to be hotter upon his departure, then before:
and <U+017F>eeing that the venerable <hi>Chry<U+017F>ante</hi> could not go, his importunity was <U+017F>uch, that the

were in <U+017F>ome places very narrow, every one did undertake the conduct of her who was

<U+017F>hould fall into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of his affection: <hi>Phillis</hi> therefore took <hi>Diana</hi> by the other arm,
and mixed di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t them, <U+017F>eeming as if without de<U+017F>ign.</p>
                  <p>It happened, that being come out of the Wood, and having pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over <hi>Lignon,</hi> at the
bridge of <hi>Botereux,</hi> the way was <U+017F>o broad that many might goe abre<U+017F>t: <hi>Phillis</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>Lycidas</hi> unto her; and <U+017F>eeing that <hi>Silvander</hi> was con<U+017F>trained to entertaine
<hi>Hylas; Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, (purpo<U+017F>ely to interrupt <hi>Paris</hi>) pray give me your opinion:
which of us two hath the better place? I think an<U+017F>wered the Shepherd, that this which
I have long had is the be<U+017F>t; you mu<U+017F>t have very good rea<U+017F>ons (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) if you can
make me beleeve it; and your affection is very cold, if you thinke <U+017F>o: yet it is true (<U+017F>aid
<hi>Silvander</hi>) though not beleeved, <U+017F>o as, what<U+017F>oever you thinke of my place or affection
to <hi>Diana,</hi> I would not change with you; for as <U+017F>ure as you are <hi>Phillis,</hi> my place is
better then yours: I have heard <U+017F>aid <hi>Philis,</hi> that the neerer one is to the party loved, the
more is the Lover contented; you have heard the truth, replyed <hi>Silvander;</hi> You <U+017F>ee,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that I am neere <hi>Diana,</hi> and you are at a great di<U+017F>tance: For all that, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
hee, I am neerer to her then you are; for you are only by her <U+017F>ide, and I am
in her heart. I <U+017F>hall no longer be <U+017F>orry for the paines you take in walking (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>)
for now I <U+017F>ee it is <hi>Diana</hi> that gives you <U+017F>trength to make long journeys without wearying
your thighs. <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>miled at the an<U+017F>wer, and replyed: I know <hi>Hylas</hi> that you doe
not under<U+017F>tand what I <U+017F>ay; nor indeed is it to you that I <U+017F>peake, but unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> who,
the truth is, I find to be ignorant enough in the my<U+017F>teries of love; but yet <U+017F>he is willing to
learne, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he doth better de<U+017F>erve to heare me than you doe. If <hi>Phillis</hi> de<U+017F>ire to be
a Schollar in the Schoole of love (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) and will follow my documents, I <U+017F>hall
make her an excellent Arti<U+017F>t. Every one laughed at <hi>Hylas,</hi> and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Silvander</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> looked downe with their eyes, he would change di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,
therefore <U+017F>aid unto him: I perceive <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you are very liberall of your
Doctrine, but to returne unto what I <U+017F>poke unto <hi>Phillis;</hi> I <U+017F>ay againe that I am neerer
<hi>Diana</hi> then <U+017F>he is, though <U+017F>he <U+017F>tand clo<U+017F>e by her <U+017F>ide, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Diana</hi> is in my heart:
you <U+017F>aid, replyed <hi>Phillis</hi> pre<U+017F>ently, that you were in her heart. I <U+017F>ay it againe, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Silvander;</hi> beleeve it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> there is a great deal of difference; for if you doe love
<hi>Diana,</hi> it may be <U+017F>aid that <U+017F>he is in your heart; and if <hi>Diana</hi> love you, then it may be
<U+017F>aid that you are in hers. After the common and vulgar<U+017F>peech, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> it may
be <U+017F>o under<U+017F>tood; but among<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons of under<U+017F>tanding, the one may be taken for the
other: for to be in any place, is to be under<U+017F>tood two wayes: The one, when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is in a place, and then the out<U+017F>ide is in onely there; the other is, when the <U+017F>oul which
is all <U+017F>pirit, doth hover in any place, as mine doth in the heart of <hi>Diana;</hi> for a <U+017F>oule lives
more where it loves, then where it breaths,: To live, is an immediate act of the <U+017F>oule;
it followes therefore, that if I love <hi>Diana,</hi> I am really in her: it is al<U+017F>o a common phra<U+017F>e
to <U+017F>ay, My heart is there, though my body be here: This, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis</hi> is a little
too ob<U+017F>cure for me: but by all this you onely prove that your <U+017F>oule is there, and not
<hi>Silvander,</hi> and therefore my place is the better: for one part of me at the le<U+017F>t, and that
which is mo<U+017F>t apt for pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, the body is neerer her then you are. I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered he,
that in body you are neerer then I am, but you cannot conclude by it that your place is
better, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>oule is <U+017F>o much <U+017F>uperiour to the body, as there is no compari<U+017F>on
betwixt them. I wi<U+017F>h withall my heart Shepheard (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that we two were both
in love with one Shephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e: for <U+017F>ince you contemne the body, I would willingly
take it for my <U+017F>hare, and leave the <U+017F>oule freely to you, though it were the mo<U+017F>t learned
<U+017F>oule among all our Druids: As for example, leave the body of <hi>Alexis</hi> to me, and I
will leave the <U+017F>oule of <hi>Adamas</hi> unto you, who is a very knowing man. Every one did
laugh at this propo<U+017F>ition, unto which <hi>Silvander</hi> an<U+017F>wered thus: If all things be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
according to their true merit, certainly your choi<U+017F>e is not the be<U+017F>t: For the body
which you only love, is an object unworthy of the <U+017F>oules love, becau<U+017F>e love <U+017F>hould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
adde <U+017F>ome perfection unto the Lover; for it is confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed by all, that love is a de<U+017F>ire
of <U+017F>omething which is wanting. Alas the body is unworthy of the <U+017F>oul's love, becau<U+017F>e
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53527:11"/>
it is vile and ba<U+017F>e, and much below it; <U+017F>uch <hi>Hylas,</hi> as love onely the body, are <hi>Pigmalion-like,</hi>
who fell in love with a peece of Marble: Nature it <U+017F>elfe is very repugnant to it,
and you will confe<U+017F><U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it, <hi>Hylas,</hi> when I aske you this Que<U+017F>tion. If <hi>Alexis</hi> were dead,
would you then love her body? To which <hi>Hylas</hi> making no an<U+017F>wer; I <U+017F>ee you are mute
truth hath <U+017F>ilenced you, or el<U+017F>e you are a<U+017F>hamed of a bad opinion. Neither the one, nor
the other (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) but what <U+017F>hould I an<U+017F>wer? Doe you thinke I can divine? <hi>I</hi>
can give you an accompt of things pa<U+017F>t if I can remember them, and of things pre<U+017F>ent
when I know them; but as for things future, good Friend, who doe you take me for:
Doe you thinke I had one of the Sibils to my Tutor, or that I was brought up at the
<U+017F>choole of Prediction? Good <hi>Silvander,</hi> if you di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with me, talke of things
within compa<U+017F><U+017F>e of mans capacity, and let the <U+017F>ecrets of the Gods alone: leave things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
unto them, they have re<U+017F>erved them unto them<U+017F>elves. If you aske whether I doe
love the body of <hi>Alexis:</hi> I an<U+017F>wer you, that I do; but if you aske me what I would doe
if the body had not a <U+017F>oule, I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>end you to <U+017F>uch as can foretell things; you may
take them along with you, if you will upon an errand to the De<U+017F>tinies, and when you
returne, I <U+017F>hall enquire of you what I <U+017F>hall doe then: but in the meane time I will love
the body of the faire <hi>Alexis,</hi> not as <U+017F>he will be a hundred yeares hence, but as <U+017F>he is
now at this pre<U+017F>ent, the mo<U+017F>t perfect workman<U+017F>hip of the gods.</p>
                  <p>Thus talked <hi>Hylas,</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> would have replyed, when all the Company came
to a narrow planke, where every <U+017F>hepheard was officiou<U+017F>ly carefull to helpe his <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e
over; and when they were all on the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Silvander</hi> offered to fall into
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e againe, but <hi>Diana</hi> hindred him, becau<U+017F>e hearing a <U+017F>hepheard and a <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e
<U+017F>inging, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired him to li<U+017F>ten. All the Company turned their eyes to the
place from whence the voice came, and drawing a little neerer, they <U+017F>aw a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e
<U+017F>itting under a <U+017F>hady Tree, and a <U+017F>hepheard upon his knees before her, courting her, and
<U+017F>he returning him very di<U+017F>dainfull an<U+017F>wers. Enough, enough <hi>Alcidon</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) if
you will have me to <U+017F>tay any longer here, either be <U+017F>ilent, or talke of <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e;
and beleeve it, that what<U+017F>oever you <U+017F>ay upon this <U+017F>ubject, will onely increa<U+017F>e my di<U+017F>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to you. If I had not more hope (an<U+017F>wered hee) in the ju<U+017F>tice of love, then in
yours, I <U+017F>hould long <U+017F>ince, not onely have cea<U+017F>ed talking, but cea<U+017F>ed living. What
can your hopes be, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide?</hi> for if the God of whom you <U+017F>peake were ju<U+017F>t, he
would long <U+017F>ince have made you an example unto all <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>o bold as to offer
wrong? Doe not offend him (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon</hi>) who hath power to order things according
to his will, and of who<U+017F>e power you cannot be <U+017F>o ignorant, as to thinke that you
ought to <U+017F>corne me as you doe: The <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e would have replyed, had not the
company been <U+017F>o neer, as cau<U+017F>ed her to be <U+017F>ilent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the Company, who heard the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers, being invited by
the beauty of the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and the han<U+017F>ome deportment of the Shepheard, as well
to <U+017F>ati<U+017F>fi their curio<U+017F>ity, as their duty, unto which the lawes of ho<U+017F>pitality did oblige
them, which were mo<U+017F>t religiou<U+017F>ly ob<U+017F>erved in that Country; they addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves
unto the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and after <U+017F>alutation, offered her and all her company, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; for at the <U+017F>ame time there came unto her two other <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es and
a <U+017F>hepheard, who had <U+017F>trayed from them, and <U+017F>tayed under a <U+017F>hade untill the heat of
the day was a little over. <hi>Daphnide,</hi> <U+017F>eeing this faire Company accoa<U+017F>t her with <U+017F>uch
courteous expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible civility, and told them all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
that the Heavens had beene mo<U+017F>t gracious unto the Country, being inhabited
by per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o accompli<U+017F>hed with all manner of merits. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> made an<U+017F>wer thus; There
is not any here who is not very much devoted unto your <U+017F>ervice, as well in obedience
to our Lawes which command us to be ho<U+017F>pitable unto Strangers, as out of de<U+017F>ire to
have the honour of doing <U+017F>ervice unto per<U+017F>ons of <U+017F>o much merit as you and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.
Since my fir<U+017F>t encounter is <U+017F>o good (<U+017F>aid the Stranger) I begin to hope for a
happy conclu<U+017F>ion in my voyage: And <U+017F>ince your courteous offers doe imbolden me
to enquire of what is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to be known; I be<U+017F>eech you fair <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e tell me, if
there be not a Fountaine in this Country, which is called the Fountaine of Loves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and where it is? <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> looked upon <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> and returned no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer,
which can<U+017F>ed <hi>Silvander</hi> to an<U+017F>wer for her. Faire <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) the
Fountaine of which you enquire is in this Country; bnt love hath <U+017F>o ordered it that upon
the matter it is not here, being guarded by <U+017F>uch inchanted Animals, as there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e
unto it: And where is it, replyed <hi>A<U+017F>trea?</hi> How, <U+017F>aid the Stranger, are you of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53527:11"/>
this Country, and ignorant of a thing <U+017F>o rare? It is almo<U+017F>t incredible: Tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ee
your face which is <U+017F>o faire, cannot chu<U+017F>e but love you, and by con<U+017F>equence you cannot but
be <U+017F>o curious as to know the truth of their affections who love you, which as I have
heard <U+017F>ay; may be <U+017F>een in this fountain. I know, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and blu<U+017F>ht a little, that it
is your Complement which makes you <U+017F>peake <U+017F>o advantagiou<U+017F>ly of my face, and nothing
el<U+017F>e, therefore I will not an<U+017F>wer unto that. But as for that curio<U+017F>ity which you thinke is
in me; fir<U+017F>t, I have no occa<U+017F>ion for it, becau<U+017F>e I was never <U+017F>o happy as to be loved in that
manner: and <U+017F>econdly, we never u<U+017F>e to have recour<U+017F>e unto the Fountaine you <U+017F>peake of,
to know the mindes of tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>erve us, becau<U+017F>e we have a better, and more <U+017F>ure way.
What is that, I be<U+017F>eech you, (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>tranger). It is, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> Time, and the effects
of it. I do conceive, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that this way is very uncertaine; and I my <U+017F>elfe can
<U+017F>ay, that I have been often deceived by it.</p>
                  <p>If that do faile us (replyed <hi>Diana</hi>) then we doe u<U+017F>e another remedy: What is that, <U+017F>aid
the <U+017F>tranger? It is, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> not to love at all. That remedy, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> is
mo<U+017F>t unju<U+017F>t, for thereby the innocent will be puni<U+017F>hed, and not the culpable. For he
who deceives any <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, in faigning to love her, cares not whether <U+017F>he love him
or no, and <U+017F>o receives no puni<U+017F>hment for his fault: and he who does really love her, bears
all the blame and puni<U+017F>hment. You <U+017F>ee, generous <U+017F>hepheard (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that our <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>es
are as unju<U+017F>t as faire; and yet for all that, we can't chu<U+017F>e but love them; what
then <U+017F>hould we do, if their minds were as <U+017F>weet as their faces?</p>
                  <p>One of the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es hearing <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>peak thus, began to fix her eyes upon him,
thinking that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould know him. And doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e, but for his habit which did a little
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e him, <U+017F>he had not <U+017F>tood <U+017F>o long in doubt; but after <U+017F>he had a little better con<U+017F>idered
with her <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Thameres,</hi> and asked him in a low voice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that <U+017F>hepheard who <U+017F>poke, was not <hi>Hylas,</hi> and he an<U+017F>wering, yes; <U+017F>he whi<U+017F>pered
<hi>Daphnide</hi> in the eare, and <U+017F>aid unto her, Madam, he whom you <U+017F>pake unto, is <hi>Hylas,</hi> and
you know him not: The <U+017F>tranger blu<U+017F>hed; and holding her hand before her face, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a<U+017F>hamed to be <U+017F>een in that habit, went back a pace or two, crying out, Oh heavens<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                     <hi>Hylas,</hi> how your habit alters you, and perhaps mine alters me as much: Then <hi>Hylas</hi>
coming nearer her, he looked <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly upon her, <U+017F>o as though he had not <U+017F>een her of a
long time; and though her habit had much changed her, yet he knew her to be <hi>Daphnide,</hi>
e<U+017F>teemed the faire<U+017F>t Lady in all <hi>Arles,</hi> or the Roman Provinces; but he was <U+017F>o much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at the <U+017F>ight of her, that he knew not whether he dreamed or waked. At the la<U+017F>t,
after a long pau<U+017F>e, he went back, looked upon her, and was not able to <U+017F>peake one word:
which the <U+017F>tranger perceiving. Certainly, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, This is a Country of wonders; for <hi>I</hi>
find in it <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es more civilized, than any per<U+017F>ons in Cities: Naturall beauties,
without any artifice; and the greate<U+017F>t wonder of all is, to <U+017F>ee <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>ilent. <hi>Hylas</hi> turned
towards her, and knew her that <U+017F>poke unto him, to be <hi>Carlis,</hi> the other <hi>Stiliana,</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthe,</hi>
with them: this <U+017F>ight did <U+017F>o amaze him, that not able to <U+017F>peake a word, he ran
to embrace his deare friend <hi>Hermanthe;</hi> and after a long embracement, he parted, and
imbraced againe; have I met with my dear <hi>Hermanthe?</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould
find here the greate<U+017F>t beauties in all the Province of the <hi>Romans?</hi> I might have <U+017F>aid the
whole world, if this Country in which we are were excepted. What? The <U+017F>o much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
<hi>Daphnide;</hi> the proud <hi>Stiliana,</hi> and <hi>Carlis,</hi> who fir<U+017F>t taught me to love? The Gods
have been abundantly favorable to me, in conducting you hither: Madam (<U+017F>aid he
unto <hi>Daphnide</hi>) you, and your company, are come to be witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of my Glory and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
<hi>Hylas,</hi> an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>tranger, you enjoy no contentment, but I do participate in it
as your friend: but if you wonder to <U+017F>ee me in this equipage, I do no le<U+017F><U+017F>e, to <U+017F>ee you
thus di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, and in a place where I had no thoughts of finding you: however, I doe
thinke the encounter mo<U+017F>t happy, if it will make me any <U+017F>harer in the Glory and Felicity
which you enjoy. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Carlis,</hi> he nevers offers any <U+017F>igne of joy for meeting with
me, or with <hi>Stiliana.</hi> Oh my fir<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) why do you think <U+017F>o? you know
that ones fir<U+017F>t love is never forgotten. But you <U+017F>hew the contrary (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) for love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, when the party loved is forgotten; and you cannot deny, but that you had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
us all. I am compounded of another mettal (<U+017F>aid he) then other lovers are; for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
u<U+017F>e to forget tho<U+017F>e whom I ever loved; nor is my affection to them extingui<U+017F>hed. 'Tis
true, my memory will <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>tumble, and be covered over with oblivion, as fire
will be in the embers, and my affections will <U+017F>lacken as a bow that hath been too long
bent; but my memory will get up againe: blow but the ashes from the embers, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53527:12"/>
the fire will be in; and the bow after a little unbending, will a<U+017F><U+017F>ume its fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>trength; even
<U+017F>o will my memory, and my affection, when the a<U+017F>hes of oblivion are blown away, by
the fight or pre<U+017F>ence of the party loved. I perceive, <U+017F>aid <hi>Stiliana,</hi> that <hi>Hylas</hi> is <U+017F>till <hi>Hylas
I</hi> hope (<U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide</hi>) that we <U+017F>hall have lei<U+017F>ure to know further of your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare;
but in the meane time, le<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould commit <U+017F>ome errors among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e fair <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>es,
<hi>I</hi> pray <hi>Hylas</hi> tell us who they are, and whether <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> be in the
company. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> they are both there; and then he <U+017F>hewed them unto
her; then <hi>Daphnide</hi> <U+017F>aluted them againe; and after <U+017F>he had well looked upon them,
Fame I perceive (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) has undervalued the truth; for I <U+017F>ee your beauty goes beyond
all reports. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and blu<U+017F>ht, tho<U+017F>e that live as we do, may <U+017F>ay, that
they are hardly in the world; for living onely in woods and fields, fame can take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of us, and we think our <U+017F>elves very happy in her <U+017F>ilence. You may <U+017F>ay what you plea<U+017F>e,
replyed <hi>Daphnide;</hi> but now I have <U+017F>een you, I am able to <U+017F>ay, and truly, that though
fame <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak highly in your advantage, yet <U+017F>he both is, and would be <U+017F>arre <U+017F>hort of
the truth, and do you wrong. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> it is onely your <U+017F>weet civility which
is plea<U+017F>ed to be<U+017F>tow the<U+017F>e attributes upon us: And though we are, as my companion <U+017F>aith,
almo<U+017F>t out of the world: yet would we gladly be <U+017F>uch as you are plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ay we are;
for perfection is de<U+017F>ireable in all. You cannot de<U+017F>ire more then you have; replyed the
<U+017F>tranger; for if you <U+017F>hould, your de<U+017F>ires would be above the power of Nature: and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould make two different beauties more perfect, How, Madam,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> though they be <U+017F>uch as you <U+017F>ay they are, yet I was never in love with them,
or <U+017F>o little, as it may be termed nothing. All birds, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Daphnide,</hi> are not plea<U+017F>ed
with the pure light of the Sun, nor by con<U+017F>equence, your bad <U+017F>ight with the<U+017F>e great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Nay, nay, Madam, replyed he, It is rather becau<U+017F>e there are greater beauties in this
Country then they are, and you know <hi>Hylas</hi> was ever a lover of the faire<U+017F>t. I can very
hardly believe what you <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>tranger. I <U+017F>hall make you confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it, <U+017F>aid he,
if you will goe whether all this company are going: Di<U+017F>creet <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es (continued
he, and turned towards <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>) know that you <U+017F>ee here in the habit of a <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e

of <hi>Galloligures;</hi> and I believe your Country never received a greater favour from heaven,
then in receiving them therefore Noble <hi>Paris,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you let them not depart from
this company, until <hi>Adamas</hi> have <U+017F>een them at his hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Paris</hi> and the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es

honour which was their due; and be<U+017F>eeched them to favour the great <hi>Druid</hi> <U+017F>o far, as to
vi<U+017F>it his hou<U+017F>e; which they con<U+017F>ented unto, as well to <U+017F>atisfie the reque<U+017F>t of <hi>Paris</hi> and the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hylas</hi> was very glad when they con<U+017F>ented; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Daphnide</hi> knew him in the

that addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Daphnide:</hi> Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto her, I think, that in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon you the habit of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, you have al<U+017F>o taken their humour,
<U+017F>ince this <U+017F>hepheard's talk does plea<U+017F>e you <U+017F>o very well: for he never opens his mouth to
contradict me, but pre<U+017F>ently all fall a laughing. But my good friend <hi>Silvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid
he, and turned towards him) you mu<U+017F>t know, that it is at you whom this Lady laughs,
and not at me; for thy education being onely Rurall, thou <U+017F>peake<U+017F>t accordingly: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>I</hi> think thy be<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cretion is, to talk no longer. Courteous <U+017F>hepheard, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide,</hi>
do not believe <hi>Hylas,</hi> you do not know him <U+017F>o well as I do; but I <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry
you <U+017F>hould have any <U+017F>uch opinion of me. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander, Hylas</hi> and <hi>I</hi>
have often <U+017F>uch conte<U+017F>ts as the<U+017F>e, and never believe each other. But <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, and
turned towards him, do not mi<U+017F>take your <U+017F>elfe, for I do know before whom I <U+017F>peak, and

                  <p>I had <U+017F>pent my time very ill among<U+017F>t the <hi>Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilians,</hi> and had been both deafe and

doe not think to daunt me with your big words. <hi>Daphnide</hi> then interpo<U+017F>ed; truly, <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he, I doe beleeve this <U+017F>hepheard knowes me, and I beleeve what he <U+017F>ayes, and al<U+017F>o <hi>I</hi>
beleeve he knowes more then you thinke he doth. But kind <U+017F>hepheard (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto
<hi>Silvander</hi>) if it will not be too much trouble unto you, tell us how you came to know
all the<U+017F>e things? Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> I was along time in the <hi>Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilian</hi> <U+017F>chools
where your Name was <U+017F>o cryed up by the <hi>Bardi,</hi> that every one did hear of it. How came
you now to be in the habit of a <U+017F>hepheard (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) and what cau<U+017F>e doth retaine you
in it? Fortune, <U+017F>aid he, brought me into this Country, and Love <U+017F>tayes me in it.
And <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> Love brought me into this Country, and <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>tayes me in it.
Who is that happy <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, (and <U+017F>miled) She is one, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> who will make
you blu<U+017F>h for <U+017F>hame, and grow pale with envie: <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o faire, that <U+017F>he hath no equall.
<hi>Aylas,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, you <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o much that I mu<U+017F>t needs beleeve you in part, and too
much to be beleeved in all; your owne eyes (<U+017F>aid he) will be witne<U+017F><U+017F>es pre<U+017F>ently again<U+017F>t
your <U+017F>elfe, and will enforce you to ju<U+017F>tifie all my words; for I have not <U+017F>poke one <U+017F>yl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
too much in her Commendations. <hi>Alcidon</hi> hearing this, thought him<U+017F>elfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned:
<hi>Hylas</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) I will acknowledge your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e to be faire, but that <U+017F>he is
fairer then <hi>Daphnide,</hi> if words will not maintaine the contrary, my blood and life <U+017F>hall.
<hi>Hylas</hi> hearing this, a<U+017F><U+017F>umed a very <U+017F>erious looke; as farre as words will goe, <U+017F>aid he,
<hi>I</hi> will maintaine what <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ay; but if you come to matter of blood and life, <hi>I</hi> will not
onely quit her unto you, but unto any that <U+017F>hall maintaine the contrary; for my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion
is talking not killing: every one began <U+017F>o to laugh at this an<U+017F>wer, that <hi>Alcidon</hi>
could not reply of a long time after.</p>
                  <p>Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had continued longer, if they had not been very neer the

which <U+017F>he promi<U+017F>ed unto her <U+017F>elfe in the <U+017F>ight of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> did <U+017F>tand leaning again<U+017F>t a
window which looked towards the Plaine, and talked with <hi>Leonide.</hi> When <U+017F>he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the company comming, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured her <U+017F>elfe that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was among<U+017F>t them, <U+017F>he
<U+017F>tarted: <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>he looked upon one, and <U+017F>ometimes upon another <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e;
but when <U+017F>he <U+017F>pyed <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> oh, into what an exta<U+017F>ie <U+017F>he was tran<U+017F>ported! <U+017F>he fixed her
eye upon her, and <U+017F>poke not a word, as if <U+017F>he would take her fill of that plea<U+017F>ing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
At la<U+017F>t fetching a deepe <U+017F>igh, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewed her unto <hi>Leonide</hi> with her finger; <U+017F>ee,
<U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, the faire<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight in the whole world, being as bad almo<U+017F>t in that rapture,
as <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> was. Then keeping <U+017F>ilence a while, <U+017F>he went a pace or two backe from
the window, and folding her armes upon her bre<U+017F>t: Oh heavens (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) how dare
<hi>I</hi> pre<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>elf before her, when <U+017F>he hath commanded me the contrary? What, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Leonide</hi> will you relaps into your old errour? Were not the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations <U+017F>ufficiently
debated with <hi>Adamas</hi> before you came hither? have you <U+017F>o <U+017F>oone forgotten his prudent
rea<U+017F>ons? Doe not thinke (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that I have forgotten them, but I am <U+017F>ure
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> will <U+017F>ee me, and I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee her, <U+017F>he will <U+017F>peake unto me, and I unto her, and is

Wi<U+017F>edome, that with a little helpe of your own, none will que<U+017F>tion but that you
are his daughter.</p>
                  <p>As they were thus talking, <hi>Adamas</hi> being adverti<U+017F>ed of the coming of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> he
came to hearten <hi>Alexis,</hi> which was no <U+017F>mall Prudence; for <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o much out of
her <U+017F>elfe, that good preparatives were but nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>he being <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed <U+017F>he might
give too much knowledge who <U+017F>he was. When they were in the mid<U+017F>t of their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
newes was brought them that all the Company was come in, to the fir<U+017F>t Court of the
Ca<U+017F>tle. <hi>Alexis</hi> blu<U+017F>ht, and her legs trembled <U+017F>o, that <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>trained to fit downe.
<hi>Leonide</hi> who perceived it, the better to hide all faults, told <hi>Adamas</hi> that it was good to
draw the Curtains of the windowes, and to let in as little light as might be, that the
alterations in the face of <hi>Alexis</hi> might not be di<U+017F>cerned, and that the pretence for it
might be to hinder the Sunne from keeping the roome too hot. The Druide liking
the Coun<U+017F>ell, commanded all the Curtaines to be drawne: But as they were bu<U+017F>ie in
preparing all things on the one <U+017F>ide, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was as much perplexed on the other: her
heart did beat extreamly, and coming unto <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>aid to her in her eare: Good Si<U+017F>ter
find <U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>e or other out, which may cau<U+017F>e us to <U+017F>tay a little; for I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e
that my hopes to <U+017F>ee the face of <hi>Celadon</hi> in <hi>Alexis,</hi> does <U+017F>o much put mee out of my

<hi>Phillis</hi> went unto <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto her: Are you not weary Madam with walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Hill? If it be your plea<U+017F>ure, I am <U+017F>ure all the company would be very glad
to take a little breath before they goe up into the Hall. For my part (<U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide</hi>) <hi>I</hi>
like the motion very well, but would not propound it lea<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e. <hi>Hylas</hi>

but <U+017F>ince you are, I be<U+017F>eech you take it not ill, if I goe before, and tell them that you
are coming; for I had rather take breath with <hi>Alexis,</hi> than here. Then not <U+017F>taying
for any, nor for the an<U+017F>wer of <hi>Daohnide,</hi> he went up the <U+017F>taires, at the top of which, and
at the entrance into the Hall, he met <hi>Adamas, Leonide</hi> and <hi>Alexis:</hi> and becau<U+017F>e all
three of them did thinke that the love of <hi>Hylas</hi> would be an excellent umbrage of what
they de<U+017F>ired to conceale, they made him as welcome as they could: The Druid
him<U+017F>elfe, after he had <U+017F>aluted him, <U+017F>milingly <U+017F>aid, that it was ea<U+017F>ie to <U+017F>ee who of all the

For my part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> I am very much contented in it: <hi>Hylas</hi> then going neerer
her: Fair <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, in a low voice, <U+017F>o my company yeeld you any contentment, it
is enough: Why, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> <U+017F>eeming to be angry) doe you <U+017F>o little e<U+017F>teeme the re<U+017F>t

the day be done, you <U+017F>hall repent of your di<U+017F>daining me thus: <U+017F>he uttered the<U+017F>e words
with an angry looke, and did very well feign a di<U+017F>contented per<U+017F>on. But <hi>Hylas,</hi> who
naturally did not care for any woman living, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e her he loved I <U+017F>hall be very <U+017F>orry, <U+017F>aid

but lo<U+017F>e your labour, if you <U+017F>eek for any revenge upon me: And when <U+017F>he doth repent
of it, you need not <U+017F>eeke for any greater revenge, for my <U+017F>orrowes will be <U+017F>o great, that
nothing can make them greater. Servant, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> as long as you

                  <p>He was ready to reply, when <hi>Adamas</hi> interrupted and asked him, who were tho<U+017F>e

Then <hi>Paris</hi> coming nearer unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> told him, that it was the fair <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and

                     <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid this unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <hi>Leonide</hi> in favour of <hi>Paris,</hi> had placed <hi>Diana</hi>
in the mid<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o that <hi>Silvander</hi> could not come near her, but was forced to <U+017F>it betwixt
<hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>Florice;</hi> which being known unto every one, was the rea<U+017F>on why every one
laughed at the an<U+017F>wer, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Phillis,</hi> who <U+017F>aid; It mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, <hi>Silvander,</hi> that
now it happens unto you, as unto one who will undertake to part two who are fighting,
and betwixt them is wounded, though he had no quarrel. If you had not often tryed
(an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander</hi>) that the weapons of <hi>Hylas</hi> have neither point nor edge, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould
not wonder you <U+017F>hou'd <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o. But, <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, having had <U+017F>o much experience of them,
<hi>I</hi> wonder you <U+017F>hould have that opinion: Never wonder (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es) for he
hath changed his weapons, he does not now fight with his own; tho<U+017F>e wherewith he hath
now wounded you, are borrowed of one who<U+017F>e cu<U+017F>tome is to vanqui<U+017F>h. After that rate,
an<U+017F>wered he, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall partly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e as much. To tell you truly (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) neither of
you can wound me, either with your own Armes, or any other you can borrow; for be
they as good as they will, they have no force again<U+017F>t me: If they were in my hands, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Florice,</hi> what would you <U+017F>ay unto them? <hi>I</hi> would <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered he, That <hi>I</hi> do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you ever had any <hi>I</hi> hope, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cyrenea,</hi> that you will not <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o by me. <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t
confe<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that when <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>aw you but <U+017F>eldome, <hi>I</hi> loved you much; and when <hi>I</hi>
<U+017F>aw you much, <hi>I</hi> loved you but little. Her <U+017F>ight then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Palinice,</hi> did as the Scorpion
does, which heales the wound it makes; but <hi>I</hi> am confident you will not <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o of me. Of
you (<U+017F>aid he, as if he were a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed) for God <U+017F>ake tell me how they call you, that <hi>I</hi>
may know whether your Name can wound me more then your Fade? <hi>I</hi> perceive, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Stiliana,</hi> that it is onely <hi>I</hi> who had the power to Captivate you. The <U+017F>hort pittance of
time that <hi>I</hi> was your Pri<U+017F>oner, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> does plainly <U+017F>hew how victorious you
were. The truth is, replyed <U+017F>he, you did go out of Pri<U+017F>on, but it was not without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53527:14"/>
your ran<U+017F>ome. If <hi>I</hi> did pay it (replied he) then <hi>I</hi> owe you nothing, and if you
thinke to make me your Pri<U+017F>oner againe as ea<U+017F>ily as you did, you are very much
mi<U+017F>taken: <hi>I</hi> am now a better Souldier then <hi>I</hi> was, and therefore <hi>I</hi> would advi<U+017F>e you
not to put it to the hazard; your teares <hi>I</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you will not doe it. Come, come,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Carlis, Hylas</hi> is only mine, for as <hi>I</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t that ever he loved, <U+017F>o he ought
to be the la<U+017F>t, is not this true, <hi>Hylas?</hi> Con<U+017F>ider <hi>Carlis,</hi> <U+017F>aid he unto her, that every thing

<hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had time enough to talke; but though <hi>Alexis</hi> might have imployed
that time very well, yet <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o long before <U+017F>he could begin, being hindred by <U+017F>everall
con<U+017F>iderations, that perhaps the opportunity had been lo<U+017F>t, if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had not begun to
<U+017F>peake fir<U+017F>t. For this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed Druid <U+017F>eeing her before her eyes who had commanded her
never to <U+017F>ee her, fearing to be known by her voice, or <U+017F>ome other of her ge<U+017F>tures, was
<U+017F>o mute, that <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not open her mouth, which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> attributed unto the little
acquaintance that was betwixt them, or el<U+017F>e con<U+017F>idering that <U+017F>he had beene alwayes
conver<U+017F>ant with the Virgin Druids, <U+017F>he knew not how to talke of Country affaires.
But the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e was much mi<U+017F>taken, for the rea<U+017F>on was, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew too
much, and becau<U+017F>e that face which did repre<U+017F>ent that of <hi>Celadon,</hi> as well in her memory
as before her eyes, it made her extreamly de<U+017F>irous to gaine the favour of <hi>Alexis,</hi> which
was already but too much gotten, and therefore <U+017F>hee was the fir<U+017F>t that broke <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
thus. When <hi>I</hi> doe con<U+017F>ider the beauty of your face, and the Graces wherewith
the heavens have adorned you above all the Beauties of our age, <hi>I</hi> am almo<U+017F>t ready

<hi>I</hi> know that <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> this favour is tran<U+017F>cendent:
For if you have a will to be with us, our happine<U+017F><U+017F>e is immea<U+017F>urable; or if it be out
Complement onely to oblige us, yet we are happy in that you entertaine <U+017F>uch thoughts
in you. But <hi>I</hi> may mo<U+017F>t truly <U+017F>ay, that the newes of your coming filled the Country
both with joy and <U+017F>orrow; <U+017F>orrow in hearing of your <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and joy to hear we <U+017F>hould
be <U+017F>o happy as to <U+017F>ee you. It is <U+017F>o long before you came hither (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that if any
other but you, fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e had told me <U+017F>o, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould not have beleeved it; but to let this
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e alone, <hi>I</hi> be<U+017F>eech you tell me, how you u<U+017F>e ordinarily to <U+017F>pend your time:
for <hi>I</hi> am told that the <U+017F>hepherds and <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi> doe live the happie<U+017F>t of any

they lo<U+017F>e part of what they injoyed, are more mi<U+017F>erable then tho<U+017F>e who alwayes were
mi<U+017F>erable. Tis true, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> doe not thinke your rurall and <U+017F>olitary life doth
meet with any rubs of Fortune. Not <U+017F>o much <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> as tho<U+017F>e who live in Court,
and in the tran<U+017F>actions of the World; but as Lakes though le<U+017F><U+017F>e then the Sea, have

and for my part <hi>I</hi> may well <U+017F>ay, that having within the <U+017F>pace of one month lo<U+017F>t a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and a mother, my affliction is <U+017F>o great, that <hi>I</hi> am not yet recovered of it: Is it
long, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>ince you had this lo<U+017F><U+017F>e? About foure or five months <U+017F>ince, (<U+017F>aid
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) and upon this <U+017F>he fetched a deep <U+017F>igh: It is a very <U+017F>ad affliction (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>)
to lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch friends, but nothing is more naturall, then for Parents to dye before Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
and this may be your comfort, that they left you at an age wherein you are able
to governe your <U+017F>elfe. One thing, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> doth mo<U+017F>t exceedingly trouble me,
which is, that <hi>I</hi> am partly a cau<U+017F>e of their death: Truly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> you bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my memorie, that <hi>I</hi> have heard <U+017F>omething concerning it, and <hi>I</hi> thinke they told
me that they were drown'd, in endeavouring to helpe you out of a water into which
you were falne. Pardon me Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> it is true, that <hi>I</hi> fell into that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> endeavoured to helpe a <U+017F>hepherd who was drowned there:
and the newes being carried to <hi>Hippolita</hi> my Mother, that <hi>I</hi> was drowned, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>ed
with <U+017F>uch a fright, that <U+017F>he did never recover it, but dyed pre<U+017F>ently after: and
my Father for griefe of her followed her: Thus was <hi>I</hi> at once deprived both of father
and mother. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> could not relate the<U+017F>e accidents without much griefe, and <hi>Alexis</hi>
al<U+017F>o; <U+017F>eeming as if it were out of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: <hi>I</hi> pray <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, who was that poore <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
which was drowned? <hi>I</hi> know not, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>adly, whether you heard of him,
but his name was <hi>Celadon,</hi> brother unto <hi>Lycidas</hi> whom you <U+017F>ee there: Was it <hi>Celadon</hi>

I</hi> have often heard talke of him, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> truly it was a very <U+017F>ad accident. <hi>I</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ure

Coa<U+017F>ts,; For when he was alive, there was nothing but mirth and jollity among<U+017F>t us,
and now <U+017F>uch a dulne<U+017F><U+017F>e reignes, as if it were not the <U+017F>ame Country: And for my part
having lo<U+017F>t a Father and a Mother, who loved me mo<U+017F>t tenderly, and falne into the

di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e betweene the<U+017F>e two Lovers, he did impudently fall upon his knees before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis,</hi>
and taking her hand, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it before <U+017F>he was aware, which <U+017F>he perceiving pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

permit <U+017F>uch familiarities? The Virgin Druids, from whence <hi>I</hi> came, <hi>I</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you

the <U+017F>everity of tho<U+017F>e Druids: for if you doe, neither you nor <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall receive much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment

very <U+017F>trong arguments to divert me from following the example of tho<U+017F>e holy Virgins,
among<U+017F>t whom <hi>I</hi> have beene <U+017F>o long conver<U+017F>ant. <hi>I</hi> do beleeve what you <U+017F>ay, replied <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
but you mu<U+017F>t know, you need no wor<U+017F>e Rhethorique to make me change my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>orry, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> to force you unto any change, for <hi>I</hi> would
have you be as you are; onely let the law be equall between us; and this, as your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e,
you may very well allow. Tis true, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but how doe you meane?
<hi>I</hi> meane <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that as <hi>I</hi> allow you to be as you are, <U+017F>o you mu<U+017F>t allow me to be
as <hi>I</hi> am; and without any changing of humours, either in you or me, we may love
each other, as we did at fir<U+017F>t. <hi>I</hi> doe allow of part of what you <U+017F>ay, replied <hi>Hylas;</hi> but
the re<U+017F>t is not according to my mind: and <hi>I</hi> feare you have beene <U+017F>o cloy<U+017F>tered up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t

<hi>I</hi> can verily tell you, Madam, <U+017F>aid the Druid, where this Fountaine is, for it is not farre
from hence: but <hi>I</hi> thinke it to be a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for you to <U+017F>ee it, becau<U+017F>e it is <U+017F>trangely
inchanted, and guarded by Lyons and other fierce Animals, <U+017F>o as no humane force can
quell them. If the hazard of a life, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> will conduce unto the contentment of

                  <p>But you mu<U+017F>t know, that the <U+017F>trength of all men in the world united together, will do no
good; for <U+017F>pirits which are <U+017F>uperior unto the nature of men, are <U+017F>o pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant, that even one

the inchantment performed. What are the conditions? <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon:</hi> They are, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Adamas,</hi> very <U+017F>trange: For the enchantment mu<U+017F>t not end but in blood, and by the death
of the mo<U+017F>t faithfull lover, and loved, that ever was in this Country. This, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Daphnide,</hi> is a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange Fate, and mu<U+017F>t needs be mi<U+017F>erable My <U+017F>elfe (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon</hi>)

as <hi>I</hi> can, <hi>Alcidon</hi> would pre<U+017F>ently hazard his life. <hi>I</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide, I</hi>
am not <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perate as to die, to make inchantments cea<U+017F>e. But Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> It
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem the will of the Gods <U+017F>o to doe, <U+017F>ince they commanded us to come hither. <hi>I</hi>
<U+017F>hall obey the will of the Gods, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> as far as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <hi>I</hi> can; but before <hi>I</hi> take
this cour<U+017F>e, mu<U+017F>t have a more cleare and ab<U+017F>olute command for it. This, replyed <hi>Alcidon,</hi>
argues but a very faint affection: <hi>I</hi> do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he; for <hi>I</hi> cannot undertake to be a
<U+017F>acrifice for the publique: be<U+017F>ides, <hi>I</hi> am not now in love with any; and therefore why
<U+017F>hould <hi>I</hi> hazard my life for any: and if <hi>I</hi> were, <hi>I</hi> would not do it. <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould think them
out of their wits that would; for it is not likely any that loves well, would deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves

                  <p>But Father, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and turned towards <hi>Adamas, I</hi> <U+017F>ee that <hi>Alcidon</hi> con<U+017F>traines me

whom you plea<U+017F>e to accompany you. Upon this, ri<U+017F>ing up, <hi>Adamas</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe

                  <p>The Gallery into which the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas</hi> conducted <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> was more
con<U+017F>iderable for the curio<U+017F>ities which were in it, then for the magnificence of the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
though the Doors, Windowes, and Chimneyes, were all of perfectly poli<U+017F>hed
Marble, very rich and beautifull, though the lights were at ju<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tances; a regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in the height and widene<U+017F><U+017F>e, exactly ob<U+017F>erved according to the length and rules of
Architecture; and Fretworkes and Gilding was not <U+017F>pared; yet <U+017F>uch had been the care of
the wi<U+017F>e Druid, to inrich it with all manner of rarities and curio<U+017F>ities, which either <hi>Europe,
A<U+017F>ia,</hi> or <hi>Africa</hi> produced; not onely of his owne time, but of all ages pa<U+017F>t, who<U+017F>e me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
was not lo<U+017F>t, that the<U+017F>e did much exceed the richne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the buildings; and as the
one did take the eye with beauty, the other did <U+017F>trike the mind with admiration beyond all
thought.</p>
                  <p>The Arch which was <U+017F>upported by a large Frice, was painted with the mo<U+017F>t ancient

unto the Druids and Gauli<U+017F>h Knights. There was not forgotten the Great <hi>Dryus,</hi> who by
the in<U+017F>titution of the Druids, left Religion, and the Laws of his Fathers, unto his <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive
Nephews. There al<U+017F>o was the portracture of the Great <hi>Hercules,</hi> who married the

                  <p>Above this, was a <U+017F>econd Frice, wrought with <U+017F>everall <U+017F>orts of Fretwork gilded,
which was a great ornament to the Edifice. Betwixt them both, was placed the <U+017F>tatues of
the Roman Emperours, from <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> unto the third <hi>Valentinian.</hi> But the greate<U+017F>t curio<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the place was, that every <U+017F>pace betwixt the Windows, was filled with Maps of all
the Provinces of Gaule, <U+017F>o exactly drawne, that as one walked, one might not only know
the di<U+017F>tances of places, but al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>cituation of places, Townes, their Climates, the
cour<U+017F>es of the Rivers, and the propriety of every Province in this little world. No ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervable
battle, or important <U+017F>iege, but was <U+017F>et in its right place; <U+017F>o as the great <U+017F>iege of
<hi>Alexia,</hi> and the <U+017F>ignal expeditions of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> might be <U+017F>een in the plates where they were
acted.</p>
                  <p>About the<U+017F>e Maps, might be <U+017F>eene the Pictures of tho<U+017F>e Princes, who ruled tho<U+017F>e Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces

<U+017F>he knew there the names and faces of many: Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, of <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> of
<hi>Thierry</hi> his Brother, and of the valiant <hi>Eurioke,</hi> next whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her owne Picture,
as when <U+017F>he was about the age of eighteen or twenty yeares, <U+017F>he kept her eye long upon
it; and afterwards ca<U+017F>ting them upon the Portraiture of <hi>Euricke,</hi> <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e

                     <p>I know very well, reverend Father, that the great <hi>Tautates</hi> does all things for the
be<U+017F>t: For loving us, as the workman<U+017F>hip of his owne hands; it is not likely he
will withdraw his love from us. But let me tell you, that as <hi>Phi<U+017F>ique</hi> though for our

that receive them. Tho<U+017F>e who murmur again<U+017F>t his will are indeed much too blame; but
if when they feele the <U+017F>mart they <U+017F>hrinke and bewaile it, they doe but pay the Tribute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of their weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e and humanity. I doe confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that the goods which <hi>I</hi> have received
from his hands are innumerable, and his favours are above his puni<U+017F>hments; but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all of a nature more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the bad, than the good, <hi>I</hi> am forced to <U+017F>ay, that the
afflictions which <hi>I</hi> have received have almo<U+017F>t blotted out the memory of the ble<U+017F><U+017F>ings.
And being re<U+017F>olved to retire my <U+017F>elfe from the <U+017F>tormes of the World, there is nothing
which hinders me but the pur<U+017F>uit of this Cavalier, whom <hi>I</hi> call trouble<U+017F>ome: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the occa<U+017F>ion which brought me into this Country; I be<U+017F>eech you Father give me
leave to let you under<U+017F>tand how the ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>tands betwixt us; that <U+017F>ince the Fountaine of

                     <p>Know therefore that <hi>Thierry</hi> the great King of the Vi<U+017F>igots dying honourably in the
battle <U+017F>ought in the <hi>Cathalaunique</hi> fields, he left many children behind him, <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ors,
not only in his Crowne, but al<U+017F>o in his courage and valour. He who fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ucceeded him
was <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> his elde<U+017F>t Sonne, he being received King and crowned in <hi>Tholou<U+017F>e,</hi> he
made it his principall <U+017F>tudy, not only to enlarge the limits of his Kingdome: but al<U+017F>o
to repleni<U+017F>h it with Cavaliers and Ladies: Heaven was at that time favourable unto his
will; for neither <hi>Ataulfes</hi> nor <hi>Vulalia</hi> his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors, nor the great <hi>Thierry</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had neere <U+017F>o many accompli<U+017F>hed Gallants nor <U+017F>o many faire and wi<U+017F>e Ladies as this
great and generous King had. It was my Fortune at that time to be brought unto the
Court by my mother, when I was about fifteene or <U+017F>ixteen yeares of age. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53527:17"/>
that I did not yeild unto any of my age, in the good opinion which I had of my <U+017F>elfe,
either by rea<U+017F>on of the confidence I had in my own beauty, which the flatteries of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ed
into me, or by rea<U+017F>on of that love which every one is apt to have of them<U+017F>elvs, which
made me thinke all things more perfect in me than in others: But <U+017F>o it was, that me
thought I did attract the hearts as well as the eyes of all in the Court. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe
who was one of the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hed Princes that ever the Vi<U+017F>igots had, da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to ca<U+017F>t a favourable eye upon me, and to carra<U+017F><U+017F>e me; but there being a di<U+017F>parity in our
ages, he did withdraw him<U+017F>elfe conceiving and con<U+017F>idering that <U+017F>uch a love was more fit
for one that was younger than him<U+017F>elfe.</p>
                     <p>At the <U+017F>ame time <hi>Alcidon</hi> was with the King, and I may without flattery <U+017F>ay before
his face, that then he was the very Sun of the Court, the beauty of his face, his <U+017F>tature,
his han<U+017F>ome proportion, his garbe, his becomingne<U+017F><U+017F>e in every thing: his <U+017F>weet di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition,
his courte<U+017F>ie, valour, vivacity of <U+017F>pirit and wit, his genero<U+017F>ity, and his other
perfections did get him the onely e<U+017F>teeme of the time. The King who was infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irous
that his Court <U+017F>hould flouri<U+017F>h in the bravery of Cavaliers, above all other Courts
of <hi>Europe;</hi> he ob<U+017F>erving the merit of <hi>Alcidon</hi> in his youth, did take a particular care
of him, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him<U+017F>elfe that if this hopeful Plant wat carefully pruned, he would prove
the glory of his Court.</p>
                     <p>Never blu<U+017F>h <hi>Alcidon</hi> to heare me <U+017F>peake <U+017F>o advantagiou<U+017F>ly of you in your pre<U+017F>ence: I

in his <U+017F>oule, he commanded him to love and court me. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who was not <U+017F>o young,
(though not above eighteen yeares of age) but he was apprehen<U+017F>ive of the favour which
the King did him, and knowing al<U+017F>o that his advancement depended upon his obedience
he undertooke his Commands, and applied him<U+017F>elfe unto me, as much as any one of hils
age po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could; and to traine up his Youth in all compleat exerci<U+017F>es, the King cau<U+017F>ed
Bals to be kept very often, al<U+017F>o Riding at the Ring and Tilting: It chanced, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
after <hi>Alcidon</hi> had received this command, the Ball was kept in the pre<U+017F>ence of
<hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> and the Queene: it was the cu<U+017F>tome at tho<U+017F>e Bals, to dre<U+017F><U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves with
their be<U+017F>t art: It hapned that day day, as if it were done upon de<U+017F>ign, that both he and
I were in white. And becau<U+017F>e he would let the King <U+017F>ee how willing he was to obey
his commands, when the Ball began, he tooke me out; which the King perceiving, and
ob<U+017F>erving that the youngne<U+017F><U+017F>e of both was <U+017F>uch as we had not confidence enough to <U+017F>peak
unto each other, he began to laugh, and <U+017F>ay unto tho<U+017F>e about him. I cannot tell who
put that couple together; but if it was Fortune, it appears in this that <U+017F>he is not blind;

the favour of his Ma<U+017F>ter, that there was no office about him <U+017F>o great, unto which he

                     <p>Judge, Father, whether this <U+017F>uddain death was not terrible unto my Mother and me;
It cau<U+017F>ed us to retire as <U+017F>oon as we could, into the Province of the Romans, where our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tate

and to Ruine and Ravage all <U+017F>uch as would not <U+017F>ubmit unto him. In this re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
he re-inforced his Army, and wa<U+017F>ted all places where he had no hopes that his

                     <p>As for my Father, when my Mother and I left the Court, after the death of <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond,</hi>
he retired him<U+017F>elfe unto a <U+017F>trong place which he had in <hi>Aquitaine.</hi> My Mother, who was
much affraid of War, thinking to <U+017F>hun it, came unto the Province of the Romans, and it
was there where it proved mo<U+017F>t hot; But when <U+017F>he heard that the Army of Great <hi>Eurick</hi>
was coming, <U+017F>he retired unto the farthe<U+017F>t part of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> along the River of <hi>Sorgues,</hi>
where <U+017F>he had a good hou<U+017F>e, and a <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter married, not above four or five leagues from

                     <p>When I received this Letter from <hi>Alcidon,</hi> the indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of my mother, gave me li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of my <U+017F>elfe freely; for her di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e being onely age, and no other violent
di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, unto which Phy<U+017F>ick was remedy; <U+017F>he gave me the freedom of diverting my <U+017F>elfe,
<U+017F>ometime in walking along the River <U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>ometimes in vi<U+017F>iting my Neighbours,

<hi>Alcidon,</hi> by him who brought the Letter, That if he <U+017F>hould be at <hi>Lers,</hi> which is a Ca<U+017F>tle
<U+017F>cituated upon the <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> the fourth day of the following moneth. <hi>I</hi> would <U+017F>ee him, and
that <hi>I</hi> pitched upon this place, becau<U+017F>e <hi>I</hi> knew the Ma<U+017F>ter of it was his friend, and a <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
unto the King <hi>Eurick:</hi> but that he <U+017F>hould come as privately as he could, becau<U+017F>e if it
was known he was there, he would run a great hazard, by being in an enemies Country,
and <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould be talked of as the occa<U+017F>ion.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Daphnide</hi> pau<U+017F>ed a while, and rubbed her hand upon her forehead, as if <U+017F>he were
con<U+017F>idering what <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay: at la<U+017F>t turning towards <hi>Alcidon, I</hi> would willingly go
on, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) but methinks it better, that as <hi>I</hi> have told what concernes me,
<U+017F>o you <U+017F>hould tell what concernes you, to the end <hi>Adamas</hi> hearing us both <U+017F>peak, he may
be more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of the truth, <hi>Alcidon</hi> an<U+017F>wered, you may command me any thing, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
and <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall mo<U+017F>t readily obey: but methinks you much wound the wi<U+017F>dome of this
great Druid, by <U+017F>aying he will <U+017F>ooner believe my words, then yours; for certainly you
know better what <hi>I</hi> did, then <hi>I</hi> my <U+017F>elfe; for my life hath been no better then a death,
and <hi>I</hi> would not live a moment longer, then in obedience to you. <hi>Adamas</hi> then began
to <U+017F>peak: Sir, <U+017F>aid he, Were I as much in love with this Lady as you are, this belief might
well be in me; but <U+017F>ince I am not, what you doe <U+017F>ay of your <U+017F>elfe, does more a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me
of the truth: and <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he gives you authority, you need not make any difficulty of it.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53527:18"/>
Authority? <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide:</hi> Nay more, I command him; and, if he be as good as his
word, he will not di<U+017F>obey, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e he love me more in word then deed. <hi>Alcidon</hi> then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an humble reverence; this te<U+017F>timony, <U+017F>aid he, is but weake, to <U+017F>hew my de<U+017F>ires of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
you; yet becau<U+017F>e I mu<U+017F>t obey in all, I will in this: Then he began thus,</p>
                     <p>I will not repeat what this fair Lady hath <U+017F>poken, nor will I offer to excu<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe of
what <U+017F>he doth blame me, at this time: for I believe it will come in more pertinently in
<U+017F>ome other place, before this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e be ended, in which I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>hew her my rea<U+017F>ons,
and let her know the <U+017F>incerity of my affection; or el<U+017F>e I hope, that when I have ended
this relation, <U+017F>he will give me leave to defend my <U+017F>elfe; not again<U+017F>t her, but onely again<U+017F>t
tho<U+017F>e bad impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions which calumny hath imprinted in her, in prejudice of my innocence.
And <U+017F>o taking the <U+017F>tory where <U+017F>he left it, I <U+017F>hall onely <U+017F>ay, that when her an<U+017F>wer was
brought me, never did man think him<U+017F>elfe more happy, more contented, nor better <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with this Fortune than I. I read and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the Letter a thou<U+017F>and times, and as often
imbraced the welcome Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger; and becau<U+017F>e he was a man in whom I had great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
and who had often given good te<U+017F>timonies of his fidelity, therefore I imployed
him in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, which <U+017F>o neerly concerned me; and I asked him a thou<U+017F>and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tions,
as whether <U+017F>he was as faire as when I la<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw her? whether <U+017F>he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed any
<U+017F>ignes of loving mee, and above all, whether he heard <U+017F>he loved any other? And when
he an<U+017F>wered according to my minde, I did imbrace him with <U+017F>uch raptures of joy, as
he <U+017F>wore he would tell me no more, <U+017F>ince I was ready to choake him with hugging him
in my armes.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Thierry</hi> dyed, he left his Crowne, as the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> told you, unto his
brother <hi>Euricke,</hi> a Prince, who by his great and vertuous actions, did with general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plau<U+017F>e
get the title of Great. This Prince did not onely <U+017F>ucceed his brothers in the
Crowne, but al<U+017F>o in their De<U+017F>ignes, <U+017F>o as he <U+017F>hewed the <U+017F>ame favours unto me, that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>mond</hi>
did, an event which happens very rarely in the change of Princes; the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>or
<U+017F>eldome affects tho<U+017F>e whom the Predece<U+017F><U+017F>or loved; yet more by my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
than merit, I had this honour, <U+017F>o as I was rai<U+017F>ed by <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> and maintained by
<hi>Thierry,</hi> I was al<U+017F>o favoured by the great <hi>Euricke,</hi> not now as a child, but a man able
to doe him <U+017F>ervice, as I was obliged. The favour of this Prince had brought me into <U+017F>uch
familiarity with him, as he concealed but few things from me, and his love le<U+017F><U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing el<U+017F>e. And this Prince, though in all things great, yet he excelled all in his
age in courte<U+017F>ie and love. I neither could, nor ought at this pre<U+017F>ent, be ab<U+017F>ent from his
Army, without his leave, and therefore I tooke a time when he was alone in his Clo<U+017F>et,
where after a <U+017F>mile? Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, I have a de<U+017F>igne in my thoughts, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech
you give me leave to put it in execution. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he, your courage hath
often prompted you unto things mo<U+017F>t dangerous, and I wi<U+017F>h you would have more
care of your <U+017F>elfe, then hitherto you have had: for Fortune is full of incon<U+017F>tancy; though
<U+017F>he <U+017F>mile at one time, <U+017F>he will frowne at another, and no prudent man will tempt or tru<U+017F>t
her too farre; yet tell me what your enterpri<U+017F>e is? And having more experience then
you, I <U+017F>hall know whether it be <U+017F>ea<U+017F>able or no. Sir, replyed I, and <U+017F>miled, were it a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e
that depended upon <hi>Mars,</hi> I <U+017F>hould expect from you very good in<U+017F>tructions; but
needing no other guide but Love, who is blind, and a Boy, I thinke that I <U+017F>hall not
need either your prudence or experience. The King then imbraced me and <U+017F>aid; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidon,</hi>
my advice in that al<U+017F>o will not be unprofitable: for you know that I am a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
as well under the banner of Love, as of <hi>Mars;</hi> <U+017F>o taking me by the hand, he would
not let me re<U+017F>t, until he got out of me, the name of <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and the place where I
was to goe unto her: He had heard often of her name, but had never <U+017F>een her, yet by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
knew that <U+017F>he was very faire: Upon this, he was <U+017F>o farre from ob<U+017F>tructing my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne,
that he did not only offer me all manner of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, but to accompany me him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe;
and when he <U+017F>aw I would not give con<U+017F>ent unto that, he advi<U+017F>ed me to goe with
very few per<U+017F>ons, but upon good Hor<U+017F>es, and with men who feared no dangers. That
above all, I <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>tay in any Towne or Hou<U+017F>e, but onely to get Victuall, and
then to eat it, and lye in <U+017F>ome Wood. If this Lady, <U+017F>aid he, have promi<U+017F>ed you any
good will lo<U+017F>e not the opportunity; for there is a criticall houre in which women will
grant any thing one will aske, if one can but hit upon it; and on the contrary, if one
let that houre <U+017F>lip, without <U+017F>erving her, <U+017F>he will never, or very rarely be recovered: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the<U+017F>e advices of Love, and many others, which would be too tedious to rehear<U+017F>e, he
gave me leave to depart.</p>

The Ca<U+017F>tle of <hi>Lers</hi> which <hi>Daphnide</hi> made choice of to be the place of our meeting
was <U+017F>ituated upon the bankes of the great River <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne;</hi> and truly, the Lady had made
this choice with much judgement, becau<U+017F>e the Ma<U+017F>ter of it was a Servant and an Officer
unto King <hi>Euricke,</hi> who had <U+017F>erved him in his Army in matters which concerned En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of War, having the command of Cathapaltes, Rumes, Slinges, and <U+017F>uch like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truments
of Artillery, and moreover he was my very particular friend. The wife of
this Cavalier was in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort a kin unto <hi>Daphnide,</hi> <U+017F>o as it was almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to
make choice of a fitter place, having only this inconvenience, that from our Army one
mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>e ten or twelve long leagues, all through the enemies Country; and though
the danger was great, yet it was nothing when Love commanded, who clo<U+017F>ed my eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
all dangers, rather than di<U+017F>obey.</p>
                     <p>I tooke with me, him who brought me the an<U+017F>wer from this faire Lady, as well for
the confidence I had in him, as for a guide, becau<U+017F>e he was very well acquainted with all
the wayes of that Country: And in obedience to the Kings command, I tooke onely
two other Cavaliers with me. Thus we foure taking hor<U+017F>e, we <U+017F>et forward an houre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dinner, unknowne to any, for we tooke other habits, and began our journey under
the favour of Love, which was <U+017F>uch, as after we had travelled all that day, and all the
night following, we arrived at <hi>Lers</hi> about Sun ri<U+017F>ing, where the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e of the hou<U+017F>e
received me <U+017F>o kindly, that I thought at fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he was adverti<U+017F>ed of the de<U+017F>igne which
brought me thither: but pre<U+017F>ently after, I perceived <U+017F>he knew nothing, and that all her
courte<U+017F>ie proceeded only from the friend<U+017F>hip which <U+017F>he knew was betwixt her husband
and me, and <U+017F>he was extreamly inqui<U+017F>itive to di<U+017F>cover the cau<U+017F>e of my voyage; And
therefore to colour it the better, I told her I came upon bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of great importance,
which concerned the Kings <U+017F>ervice, and came by night for feare of being di<U+017F>covered<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I
be<U+017F>eeched her to conceale my name, and to keep the gates of the Ca<U+017F>tle clo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hut, and
that when night came I would depart, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could: Shee being di<U+017F>creet and very
affectionate to the Kings <U+017F>ervice, with whom her husband was, <U+017F>he ordered it <U+017F>o as very few
in her hou<U+017F>e knew that I was <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and the more ea<U+017F>ily becau<U+017F>e at my fir<U+017F>t entrance,
I changed my Name.</p>
                     <p>Halfe of the day was <U+017F>pent, and I heard no newes of the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t
if it was not, it <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o unto me: After much impatient expectance, I went up into
a high Tower, <U+017F>eeming as if I de<U+017F>ired to view the Country, though it was only in hopes
to <U+017F>ee her coming. There was not a Hou<U+017F>e, nor a Wood, nor a Hill, of which I did not
aske the name, the better to cover my impaciency: but nothing could divert me, though
the Lady of the hou<U+017F>e did all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could to make the time <U+017F>eeme le<U+017F><U+017F>e tedious
unto mee.</p>
                     <p>At la<U+017F>t, after many a long look, and when I began to be cut of all hope, I <U+017F>aw a Coach
coming that way which I knew <U+017F>he was to come, and <U+017F>hewing it unto the Lady, <U+017F>he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
a while upon it: At la<U+017F>t, it being come a little neerer, <U+017F>he turned towards me. If I
be not much mi<U+017F>taken, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, the Coch comes hither, and if it be, as I think
it is, you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee one of the greate<U+017F>t beauties in all this Country: Who is it? (<U+017F>aid
I unto her very coldly) I know not, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he; whether you have <U+017F>een her in the Court of
King <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> with her Mother; but if you have, I am confident you know her
name: For, though <U+017F>he be my Co<U+017F>en, yet I mu<U+017F>t needs, and truly <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>he is very
faire, though <U+017F>he was then but a child: It is, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, the young <hi>Daphnide.</hi> At the fir<U+017F>t
I <U+017F>eemed to have but a little memory of her; but pre<U+017F>ently after, as if I had better recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
my <U+017F>elfe: Yes, yes, <U+017F>aid I, I doe very well remember her, <U+017F>he had then a Father
and a Mother, with whom <U+017F>he dwelt; for <U+017F>he was none of the Queenes women: She
was not, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, and perhaps the rea<U+017F>on of it was unknowne unto you,
becau<U+017F>e you were then very young; but indeed it was becau<U+017F>e the Queene was jealous
that <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> did looke upon her with an over-kind eye, and yet I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <U+017F>he
was then but a very childe, as you will judge when you <U+017F>ee her, for <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemes to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
young yet. How? Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, I <U+017F>ee her? I be<U+017F>eech you, No; le<U+017F>t I
<U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>covered, uand my de<U+017F>igne <U+017F>poyled. For if it <U+017F>hould, be<U+017F>ides my owne ruine,
the Kings <U+017F>ervice would be <U+017F>poyled. She an<U+017F>wered, that I needed not to feare it: for
<hi>Daphnide</hi> would at her reque<U+017F>t be very <U+017F>ecret, and her Father was a faithfull devoted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Kings: I, who<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ire was to <U+017F>ee her, yet <U+017F>eemed to be per<U+017F>waded unto it
by her. I am, <U+017F>aid I to her <U+017F>o much devoted unto the <U+017F>ervice of Ladies, as I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
any of them will doe me harme. Upon this, wee <U+017F>aw the Coach take into the way
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53527:19"/>
which conducted to the hou<U+017F>e, which a<U+017F><U+017F>ured us, that it was <U+017F>he: And the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e of
the hou<U+017F>e, very glad of <U+017F>uch gue<U+017F>ts, taking me by the hand, <U+017F>aid unto me: Will it
plea<U+017F>e you, wee <U+017F>hould goe and receive them? I will put my <U+017F>elfe into their hands, <U+017F>aid
I unto her, and <U+017F>miled: perhaps I <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>afer that way, than by re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, for <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion
workes mo<U+017F>t with generous <U+017F>oules.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t we were thus talking, the Ladies were come into the ba<U+017F>e Court of the Ca<U+017F>tle,
where the Lady of the hou<U+017F>e went to receive them, and told them in their eare, what
Gue<U+017F>t <U+017F>he had in her hou<U+017F>e, and how <U+017F>he thought fit they <U+017F>hould know it as well as her
<U+017F>elfe. The faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> had with her two Si<U+017F>ters, both very fair, but both <U+017F>hort of
her: As for me, I was retired into a low Parlour, where I <U+017F>eemed unwilling to come out,
for feare of being knowne<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and it was well I did <U+017F>o; for had I not beene alone at their
fir<U+017F>t coming, my actions would have di<U+017F>covered my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: For when I <U+017F>aw them fir<U+017F>t
come out of the Coach, <U+017F>he who came out fir<U+017F>t was <U+017F>o faire, as I tooke her for <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide,</hi>
and <U+017F>eeing the <U+017F>econd fairer then <U+017F>he I recanted my fir<U+017F>t thought, <U+017F>aying to my <U+017F>elfe,
this was <U+017F>he; but <hi>I</hi> re<U+017F>ted not long in this error, for pre<U+017F>ently after <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>aw this faire one
come forth, who did <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>h me, that <hi>I</hi> knew not what <hi>I</hi> did; but their complements
and <U+017F>alutations, gave me time to recollect my <U+017F>elfe a litle: <U+017F>o as when they came into the
hou<U+017F>e, I became <U+017F>o confident, that when I <U+017F>aluted them, I was able to hid my tran<U+017F>port:
afterwards, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing my <U+017F>elfe unto her, who had the <U+017F>ole dominion of my <U+017F>oule, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>aid
unto her; Madam, <U+017F>ince fortune will have it <U+017F>o, <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf your Pri<U+017F>oner: <U+017F>ir,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me in a loud voice, we will not refu<U+017F>e the advantange which we have over
you; but we rather wi<U+017F>h our merits had gotten it, then our fortune. Your merits, replyed
<hi>I,</hi> may pretend unto far greater; and fortune gave you this as being much too little for
your merits. You have given me the <U+017F>ame a<U+017F><U+017F>urances heretofore (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he in a lower tone)
but in a language which <U+017F>poke more <U+017F>incerity, then that which you now u<U+017F>e. At that
time, an<U+017F>wered I, I might <U+017F>peak as a childe, but now I have more knowledge of my <U+017F>elfe,
I am <U+017F>ure I <U+017F>peak with more truth; yet if you will have it <U+017F>o, let be attributed unto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
but I pray, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled, how doe you think to pay the ran<U+017F>ome for getting
out of our hands? for you mu<U+017F>t never hope for liberty but by that meanes. My ran<U+017F>ome,
replyed I, be it never <U+017F>o great, will not be halfe <U+017F>o hard to be found, as to get my heart
con<U+017F>ent, that I <U+017F>hall come out of your hands. I perceive (replied <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled) you
remember yet what le<U+017F><U+017F>ons King <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> taught you, and can talk to Ladies as you
were then wont. So I ought to doe with you, an<U+017F>wered I, <U+017F>ince you have the <U+017F>ame eyes,
and <U+017F>ame beauties, wherewith you were wont to conquer all tho<U+017F>e that dur<U+017F>t look upon
you: I thought, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that men of arms and blood, <U+017F>uch as follow the King <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
had onely talked of killing and murdering; but I perceive <hi>Alcidon,</hi> where<U+017F>oever he
is, is <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame <hi>Alcidon;</hi> that is, all courte<U+017F>ie and civility; upon this <U+017F>he went into the
great Chamber with all the company.</p>
                     <p>The fir<U+017F>t Complements being pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, our kind Land-lady cau<U+017F>ing <U+017F>eats to be brought,
<U+017F>he placed me more out of civility, then de<U+017F>ign next unto <hi>Daphnide,</hi> at a little di<U+017F>tance
from the re<U+017F>t of the company; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>eeing my <U+017F>elfe in a place where I might <U+017F>peak more
freely, my affection and my duty, both invited me to give her thanks for the favour of
this meeting: but when I began, <U+017F>he interrupted me with an angry look, and laying her
hand upon my mouth, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto me; You mu<U+017F>t not think <hi>Alcidon,</hi> that you are any
thing obliged unto me for this vi<U+017F>it, becau<U+017F>e I would never have con<U+017F>ented unto it, but
onely out of a de<U+017F>ign to puni<U+017F>h you, knowing that <U+017F>ince you did love me, when I was a
meer childe, you will now be ready to die for the love of me, <U+017F>eeing me more improved.
This is the true cau<U+017F>e which moved me unto this meeting, I meane to cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e you, and
not to gratifie you; for having rendred your <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o unworthy of tho<U+017F>e favours which I
conferred upon, I will try whether cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ements will make you better know your duty
both unto me and your <U+017F>elfe. Can you think, forgetful lover, that after <U+017F>o many expre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions
of favour and love, that my beauty de<U+017F>erves to be forgotten; and that in two long
years, no <U+017F>park of any memory <U+017F>hould appeare? Doe you thinke perfidious man, that
<U+017F>o long a <U+017F>ilence can be excu<U+017F>ed by the mi<U+017F>eries of the time? Wars, and all impediments
what<U+017F>oever, cannot per<U+017F>wade me but that it is <U+017F>ome defect in affection, and not any reall
excu<U+017F>e. I know that if I would permit it, you will flow with excu<U+017F>es; but I forbid you
to <U+017F>peak; not that I feare your language can per<U+017F>wade me, but becau<U+017F>e I am re<U+017F>olved not
to believe you; and becau<U+017F>e I will not let you have <U+017F>o much content, as to <U+017F>peak any thing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53527:20"/>
before me which <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e you: By this you may know, that this meeting for which you
think your <U+017F>elfe obliged unto me, re<U+017F>embles <U+017F>weet poy<U+017F>on, which by <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e gives
death. I offered to an<U+017F>wer, but <hi>I</hi> no <U+017F>ooner opened my mouth, but <U+017F>he checked me, <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
what <hi>Alcidon,</hi> doe you care as little for di<U+017F>obliging me in my pre<U+017F>ence, as in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence?
No, no, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> that is not the way to win upon <hi>Daphnide</hi> What then, <U+017F>aid I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her, is it your plea<U+017F>ure <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould do? To <U+017F>uffer, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and be <U+017F>ilent. For it is fit you
<U+017F>hould expiate your <U+017F>inne of <U+017F>ilence, by <U+017F>ilence Upon this, <hi>I</hi> was mute; yet <U+017F>hewing by my
lookes that my heart was troubled, that <hi>I</hi> might not <U+017F>peak in my own defence. She on
the contrary, looking with a little more favourable eye, after a while of <U+017F>ilence, began
thus:</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Daphnide</hi> whom you <U+017F>ee before your face, forgetful <hi>Alcidon,</hi> is the very <U+017F>ame <U+017F>hee
was, when you fir<U+017F>t made <U+017F>o many oathes of fidelity unto her; the very <U+017F>ame who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
you; the very <U+017F>ame who<U+017F>e hands you <U+017F>o oft wa<U+017F>hed in your then innocent teares. But
to your <U+017F>hame, <U+017F>he is able to <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>he has kept her faith without the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>tain, though
<U+017F>he hath <U+017F>ince had <U+017F>o many occa<U+017F>ions to hate you <U+017F>he has <U+017F>till continued her love to you,
and entertaines in her <U+017F>oul tho<U+017F>e a<U+017F><U+017F>urances which you gave unto her: and though <U+017F>he
has had many inducements to ca<U+017F>t you quite off, yet her heart would never con<U+017F>ent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, being re<U+017F>olved rather to part from her life, then tho<U+017F>e pledges which you gave her of
your fidelity. The<U+017F>e eyes which have been <U+017F>o often idolized by the young <hi>Alcidon,</hi> have
been witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of many a teare <U+017F>hed for your long ab<U+017F>ence, when I remembred your
young promi<U+017F>es, which now <hi>I</hi> find to be <U+017F>o fal<U+017F>e: for you never had the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>parke of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
or thought of her, unto whom you promi<U+017F>ed eternal memory. Oh <hi>Alcidon;</hi> you
<U+017F>hall heare how <hi>I</hi> have lived <U+017F>ince the death of the great King, unto whom both you
and I were <U+017F>o much, obliged; and you will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, if you be not the mo<U+017F>t unju<U+017F>t man
that ever breathed, that your <U+017F>ilence hath made you unworthy of love, but that my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is <U+017F>till greater then your offence:</p>
                     <p>Then <U+017F>he began to repeat all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, <U+017F>ince the beginning of our <U+017F>eparation unto this
meeting, not omitting any circum<U+017F>tance that argued my oblivion, wherewith <U+017F>he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
me: and on the other <U+017F>ide, to te<U+017F>tifie the memory <U+017F>he had of me, <U+017F>he related all the
remarkable actions that I had done: and after a long repetition of them, at which I
was amazed, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould know <U+017F>o many particulars: I perceive, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that you
are amazed <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould relate your own life unto you; but had you beene as you ought, <hi>I</hi>
<U+017F>hould have come to the knowledge of them from your <U+017F>elfe, and not from others, which
argues a defect in your affection, and your <U+017F>ilence is a <U+017F>igne of your <U+017F>hameful forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>She had continued thus upbraiding me, and in relating both her own life and mine,
very near two hours, and would not <U+017F>uffer me to open my mouth in my own defence, nor
to an<U+017F>wer her. At la<U+017F>t, this offended beauty finding <U+017F>ome proofe of the power which <U+017F>he
had over me, <U+017F>he began to change her countenance and language. Now <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
<hi>I</hi> permit you to <U+017F>peak, being contented with two hours <U+017F>ilence in my pre<U+017F>ence, in exchange
of two yeares voluntary <U+017F>ilence in my ab<U+017F>ence. It argues your abundant goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid
<hi>I</hi> unto her, and <U+017F>miled, that you will thus change years into hours. Your crime is <U+017F>uch,
replyed <U+017F>he, that no puni<U+017F>hment can equall it: but <hi>I</hi> will <U+017F>hew my <U+017F>elfe as merciful, as <hi>I</hi>
am able to puni<U+017F>h you if <hi>I</hi> will.</p>
                     <p>Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>I</hi> unto her, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould ki<U+017F><U+017F>e your faire hands, by way of thankes for <U+017F>uch
extraordinary favours, were <hi>I</hi> not afraid <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould be perceived, but <hi>I</hi> lay my heart at your
feet, in te<U+017F>timony of my gratitude; I doe mo<U+017F>t ingenuou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, Madam, the fault
wherewith you charge me. But if your goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e would be plea<U+017F>ed to let me tell you the
occa<U+017F>ion and rea<U+017F>on why I was <U+017F>o long <U+017F>ilent, perhaps you would thinke me as worthy
of commendations, as of blame. Since I have pardoned you, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) and given you
leave to <U+017F>peake, you may <U+017F>ay what you plea<U+017F>e; and I wi<U+017F>h you may <U+017F>hew <U+017F>uch rea<U+017F>ons as
may per<U+017F>wade me, that you are in no fault. Let me <U+017F>ay then, (continued I) that you may
well conceive, <hi>I</hi> grieved extreamly at the death of a Ma<U+017F>ter, who loved me <U+017F>o exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
and rai<U+017F>ed me by his favours above the reach of all Court Envy. Now I <U+017F>hould
have extreamly offended again<U+017F>t his memory and the offence would have been thought
high ingratitude, if I <U+017F>hould have entertained the lea<U+017F>t kind of contentment in my <U+017F>oule:
Times of mourning injoynes us unto <U+017F>ad habits, and forbids any thing of joy or content.
Now the poor and di<U+017F>con<U+017F>olate <hi>Alcidon,</hi> was forbidden all manner of happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53527:20"/>
him<U+017F>elfe of all that came from you Madam, who was and is his only joy and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
To <U+017F>atisfie then, both my duty and my affection, I made choice of <U+017F>o bidding my
<U+017F>elfe the honour of hearing from you, to the end nothing <U+017F>hould divert me from my <U+017F>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
which was then <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable. But Loves knowes, and that mi<U+017F>erable heart which
loves and adores you, knowes, that in the mid<U+017F>t of my bitter <U+017F>orrowes, none grieved me
<U+017F>o much as that I was di<U+017F>tanced from your pre<U+017F>ence and memory. Two things princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
may argue the truth of this unto you. Fir<U+017F>t, if I had not truly loved you, my age
would not have permitted me to live <U+017F>o long among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many faire Ladies without love.
Secondly, as <U+017F>oone as I had in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort forgotten my <U+017F>orrowes for my great lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, my
continuall thoughts of you, would never let me be in quietne<U+017F><U+017F>e untill I had the honour of
<U+017F>eeing you: The danger of the journey, nor the di<U+017F>tance from the great <hi>Euricke,</hi> who<U+017F>e
favours <U+017F>hine upon me as fa<U+017F>t as tho<U+017F>e did from <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond,</hi> could not hinder me. Now
Madam, I pro<U+017F>trate my <U+017F>elfe at your feet, re<U+017F>igning unto you all my affections, all my
thoughts, my heart and <U+017F>oule, be<U+017F>eeching you to receive them, not as any new offering
or fre<U+017F>h acqui<U+017F>ition, but as yours from my infancy; my De<U+017F>tiny, my Ma<U+017F>ter and my
heart, did give me unto you. I <U+017F>hall receive your excu<U+017F>e <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, as they u<U+017F>e to
receive a debt from a bad pay-ma<U+017F>ter, though the money be a little too light: and I will
beleeve what you <U+017F>ay, upon condition that none of your future actions give me any cau<U+017F>e
of doubt.</p>
                     <p>When I would have an<U+017F>wered, I was hindred by the Lady of the hou<U+017F>e, who came to
tell us it was Supper time; therefore we referred the re<U+017F>t of our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e till after it was
done. And it was no <U+017F>ooner ended, but I out of civility falling into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with
one of her Si<U+017F>ters, <U+017F>he came unto us, and having <U+017F>eparated me a little from the re<U+017F>t, we
fell into talke where we left, with <U+017F>o much contentment unto me, that I mu<U+017F>t needs
confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my joyes were never greater. Thus we <U+017F>pent part of the night; at la<U+017F>t, bed time
forcing us to part, we advi<U+017F>ed upon a more <U+017F>afe place of meeting; and being con<U+017F>trained to
depart in the morning, it was now long before we could re<U+017F>olve upon the place: At the la<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto me, but in a very doubtfull manner: I am loath, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to put you into
any danger, but <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o urgent upon it, I will tell you, that I have a Si<U+017F>ter mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
within five or <U+017F>ix Leagues of this place, where we might very well meet, were it
not that my brother in law is an Enemy unto King <hi>Euricke,</hi> yet were there no other
difficulty but that, we might find a remedy; but as ill lucke is, he hath invited a
great Company to the marriage of one of his Si<U+017F>ters, <U+017F>o as all things <U+017F>eeme contrary
unto us: I do not think there is one of any quality in all the Province, which is not an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
unto the King your Ma<U+017F>ter. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e Father, I found much danger this way,
but when I con<U+017F>idered that there was no other way to enjoy the company of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e,
danger was the lea<U+017F>t of my thoughts, and therefore I an<U+017F>wered her: That no hazard
<U+017F>hould make me lo<U+017F>e the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he would but command it; onely be<U+017F>eeched her
to take <U+017F>uch order, that when I was in the hou<U+017F>e, none <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee me; for I was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that under her command I <U+017F>hould receive no harme.</p>
                     <p>In this re<U+017F>olution we parted, and the next morning leaving one of her Servants with
me, who was very tru<U+017F>ty; <U+017F>he departed, and I had not the honour to <U+017F>ee her purpo<U+017F>ely
to take away all <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition from the Lady of the hou<U+017F>e. As for me, I departed with my
guide, <U+017F>ome three hours within night: after many thankes unto my Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F><U+017F>e for her kind
u<U+017F>age, I <U+017F>hall not here relate the various encounters I had by the way: The place unto
which I was conducted was one of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olitary <U+017F>eats in all the Country, and the
fitte<U+017F>t for any interpri<U+017F>es of love.</p>
                     <p>Upon the bankes of that great River of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> do <U+017F>tand many faire Townes, which
take delight in her waves; one of the be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t peopled is <hi>Avignion,</hi> <U+017F>ome five or
<U+017F>ix Leagues from whence towards the ea<U+017F>t is a Valley, which being inclo<U+017F>ed on three <U+017F>ides
by high Hils and great Rockes, was at the fir<U+017F>t called <hi>Vale clo<U+017F>e,</hi> and afterwards by
corruption of language, of which the vulgar is alwayes Ma<U+017F>ter, it was called <hi>Vauclu<U+017F>e;</hi>
at the end of this Valley, under huge Rockes, and by a wonderfull Fountaine which
gives a beginning to the River of <hi>Sorgues,</hi> which a little below parts it <U+017F>elfe into two
Arms, like a little I<U+017F>land, where this hou<U+017F>e unto which I was to goe did <U+017F>tand, and
which <U+017F>tanding betweene two Rivers, has the name of an I<U+017F>land. The place from whence
this Fountain <U+017F>prings, is truly for its <U+017F>olitude, in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort venerable; but <U+017F>omething
terrible by rea<U+017F>on of the Rockes which inviron it, and therefore very little frequented
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53527:21"/>
by people. It was here where my guide brought me to alight from my hor<U+017F>e, and to leave
tho<U+017F>e who came with me, which by my command, though with <U+017F>orrow, they did.
From this <U+017F>ource unto the I<U+017F>le is about a quarter of a League, which I was to walke on
foot, and in the night, which I did in <U+017F>uch doubts and incertainties, that love made
it appeare in me, how not onely him<U+017F>elfe is blind, but he takes <U+017F>ight al<U+017F>o from all tho<U+017F>e
who are his <U+017F>ubjects. At the la<U+017F>t, about the eighth or ninth hour of the night, we came
unto the Garden doore which belonged unto the hou<U+017F>e, which though it was promi<U+017F>ed
me <U+017F>hould be left open, yet it was <U+017F>hut; judge <hi>Adamas,</hi> what I thought of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then, and whether I had not rea<U+017F>on to expect <hi>Mars</hi> in lieu of <hi>Venus.</hi> But after a
long doubtfull expectance, I heard the doore open, and the fir<U+017F>t thing that pre<U+017F>ented
it <U+017F>elfe unto my eyes, was a fair Lady, decked as Painters u<U+017F>e to doe the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Diana.</hi>
her haire loo<U+017F>e, her bre<U+017F>t and <U+017F>houlders naked, her <U+017F>leeves turned up as high as the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boe;
gilded buskins upon her legs; her, Quiver by her <U+017F>ide<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and a Bow of Ivory in her left
hand. I was ravi<U+017F>hed at <U+017F>o fair a <U+017F>ight, and admired her habit; but I under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>ince that
<U+017F>he was <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed like <hi>Diana,</hi> for Name <U+017F>ake<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was called <hi>Delia,</hi> which is one
of <hi>Dianas</hi> names, purpo<U+017F>ely to daunce that night with her Si<U+017F>ters, and other young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
there, in honour of the great A<U+017F><U+017F>embly. As <U+017F>oone as ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw me come in, <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he unto me, and tooke my hand; Come in and attempt this dangerous adventure under
the conduct of <hi>Diana,</hi> Under the banner of <U+017F>uch a Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered I, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which I will not attempt. Some interpri<U+017F>es, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, do <U+017F>eeme ea<U+017F>ie at the fir<U+017F>t,
which afterwards are <U+017F>ound full of difficulty, and take heed le<U+017F>t this be of that quality:
If this were not of great importance, replyed I, I would never have come <U+017F>o farre to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it. I am very glad, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, to finde you in that re<U+017F>olution; and know that both
Love and Fortune will a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t a couragious <U+017F>oule; and to <U+017F>hew how de<U+017F>irous I am you
<U+017F>hould bring your enterpri<U+017F>e to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, I will give you <U+017F>afe conduct from all that are in
this enchanted hou<U+017F>e, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e from the eyes of your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and from this <hi>Diana</hi>
who <U+017F>peakes unto you. I doe accept of this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, <U+017F>aid I unto her: Well, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he)
before you have done with this adventure, we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee what your Fortune will be, and
what your courage: In the meane time, valiant Cavalier, enter, but <U+017F>till enter upon
<U+017F>uch conditions as tho<U+017F>e who enter, u<U+017F>e. I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid I unto her, what are tho<U+017F>e
conditions? You <U+017F>hall know, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, when you are entred. Why, <U+017F>aid I, are
you afraid to tell them, lea<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould affright me? If <U+017F>o, faire <hi>Diana,</hi> you are
mi<U+017F>taken: For I will undertake any conditions, <U+017F>o they doe not contrary that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which I have vowed unto my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e. Upon this, I entred in alone, <U+017F>he lockt the
doore, and my Guide returned through the Rockes of <hi>Vauclu<U+017F>e.</hi> Now was I alone
with <hi>Delia</hi> in the Garden; and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o advantaged by this
odde fanta<U+017F>ticall dre<U+017F><U+017F>e, as <U+017F>he might very well be termed faire, and one that was not
prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed might well have found a heart to love her: She <U+017F>eeing me <U+017F>tand <U+017F>o mute,
looking upon her, and thinking it was my impatience becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he carried me no <U+017F>oo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
unto the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>miled, and <U+017F>aid unto me. What Sir, were you bold
at your entrance, and now <U+017F>how <U+017F>o little courage to accompli<U+017F>h your adventure? What
fault faire <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto her, doe you finde in my courage, what mu<U+017F>t I doe?
and again<U+017F>t whom mu<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hew my valour? How, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>et her Arms upon
her <U+017F>ides, have you not before your eyes an enemy fierce enough to make you put your
hand to your Armes? I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e faire Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid I, that you are a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Enemy unto one that has a heart, but certainly again<U+017F>t me your Arms have no
edge, <U+017F>ince the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> has long <U+017F>ince deprived me of my heart. How, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
is there no hopes of gaining any thing from you? You may hope, replyed I, to gaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that I have, you meane, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, any thing but your heart. Well, well
<hi>Alcidon,</hi> you are not yet in a good faith; but before you e<U+017F>cape my hands, I will make
you u<U+017F>e other language: I have met with <U+017F>ome, who at the fir<U+017F>t have <U+017F>aid as you doe, and
yet before all was done did <U+017F>ubmit them<U+017F>elves as conquered: <U+017F>uch as tho<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered I,
either did but lend their, heart, or if they did give it, did <U+017F>teale it back againe to give it
unto you, but I cannot doe <U+017F>o, who have not only given away my heart, but my will,
my <U+017F>oule, and my life al<U+017F>o. Had you any courage, as you tax me for having none, you
would not imploy your valour and your <U+017F>trength again<U+017F>t one that is without defence, as
I am: What honour will it be to vanqui<U+017F>h one that is already vanqui<U+017F>hed? one that has
no heart; this were to <U+017F>trike one that is dying by the wounds of another. Come, come
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53527:21"/>
my heartle<U+017F><U+017F>e enemy, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, I know you would have me carry you pre<U+017F>ently
unto <hi>Daphnide;</hi> but doe not thinke <hi>Alcidon,</hi> that our emnity is <U+017F>o great, but I woud
have done it before now, if it had been time; doe you <U+017F>ee yonder window which <U+017F>tand
out further then the re<U+017F>t? there is <hi>Daphnides</hi> Chamber; when it is time for you to goe
there will be a Candle <U+017F>et in it to adverti<U+017F>e us<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elfe, that as you think the
time long here, your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s thinks it longer where <U+017F>he is, having abundance of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome
per<U+017F>ons, who <U+017F>warme about her like <U+017F>o many flies, e<U+017F>pecially her brother in law, who
thinking to doe her a plea<U+017F>ure, never <U+017F>tirs from her: Come, come, you that are a very
finely accompli<U+017F>hed Cavalier, methinks you <U+017F>hould not be weary of my company, many
have told me that I am pretty han<U+017F>ome, and I am in an humour to treat you <U+017F>o, that
what you will not doe by faire meanes, I will make you doe by force: I meane, I will in
<U+017F>pite of you, keep you from being weary. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e once again (<U+017F>aid I unto her)
that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for any one that has a heart, not to love you. For, faire <hi>Delia,</hi> there
are <U+017F>o many admirable perfections in you, as look which way one will, one <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>ure
to find abundance of invitements to love.</p>
                     <p>You think <U+017F>till (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me) to e<U+017F>cape my hands with this excu<U+017F>e, but before we
part, I will make you find another and therefore what will you <U+017F>ay next <hi>Alcidon?</hi> I will <U+017F>ay,
replyed I, that you can do miracles, which need not be thought <U+017F>trange; for your beauty
equalling the power of the great Gods, you may doe them as well as they: but will you
give me leave to <U+017F>peak freely? with all my heart, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, for you <U+017F>ee I do the like:
Then fair <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, let me tell you, the Moon is the mo<U+017F>t glorious lamp that now
<U+017F>hines in the heaven (the moon then <U+017F>hining) and if there was no Sun, none could deny,
but that it would be alwaies <U+017F>o: I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Delia,</hi> what doe you infer by that? I
infer, replyed I, That the fair <hi>Diana</hi> unto whom now I <U+017F>peak, would be the faire<U+017F>t in the
world, had <U+017F>he not a <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, and there is none but <U+017F>he which hinders her from the title of
the faire<U+017F>t. Could I as ea<U+017F>ily believe that, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, as I am ambitious of that title where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
you <U+017F>peak, I vow Cavalier by the<U+017F>e Arrowes and Bow, that if I could not kill her with
my own hands, I would poy<U+017F>on that <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter who eclip<U+017F>eth my beauty; but I am afraid, that
if <U+017F>he were taken away, it would happen unto me, as unto the Moon, in ab<U+017F>ence of her
brother the Sun, become ob<U+017F>cure and pale. I <U+017F>hould have an<U+017F>wered, when the <U+017F>o much
de<U+017F>ired light appeared in the window, and my affection carrying my eyes almo<U+017F>t alwaies
that way, would not let me lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>o much time as to an<U+017F>wer her when I <U+017F>aw it. Shewing
it therefore unto <hi>Delia,</hi> I be<U+017F>eeched her to accompli<U+017F>h the favour which <U+017F>he had begun.
I will, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, and took my hand<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> you know it is the office of the Moon, who<U+017F>e
Name I bear, to clear the Night, and to be a guide unto tho<U+017F>e who wander. My life, <U+017F>aid
I unto her, is obliged unto your <U+017F>ervice, though I am afraid that obligation is little worth,
<U+017F>ince you are carrying me unto one who<U+017F>e beauty kills all tho<U+017F>e that looke upon her:
and being accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>ee men langui<U+017F>h and die, it is not likely <U+017F>he will have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of my paine. Tho<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, whom I take unto my protection, are never ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for if they were, I <U+017F>hould not have opened the doore unto you: and beleeve it, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
carry any to their puni<U+017F>hment: And whereas you feare that her beauty will kill you,
never feare that fortune good Cavalier, your Arms are very good, and tryed: for <U+017F>uch as
will die at <U+017F>ight of beauty, will die at the <U+017F>ight of me; <U+017F>o as you having pa<U+017F>t that danger,
never fear any beauty living will kill you.</p>
                     <p>Thus we went talking in a low voice, until we came to the hou<U+017F>e, which was the
happy habitation of my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; and finding a door open, we went up a paire of narrow
<U+017F>taires, unto the Chamber door, with as little noi<U+017F>e as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly we could: Then <hi>Delia</hi>
cau<U+017F>ed me to <U+017F>tay, and went in alone to <U+017F>ee who was there, but <U+017F>he found onely the faire
<hi>Daphnide</hi> by her <U+017F>elfe, who faigning to be troubled with the head-ake, was laid downs

of my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s onely, I am come to render it unto her, vowing never to take
it out of <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet a pri<U+017F>on. In this, <U+017F>aid <hi>Delia,</hi> you <U+017F>hew the weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e of your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<U+017F>ince you had rather give your <U+017F>elfe unto a Nimph as <hi>Daphnide</hi> is, than unto a
Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e as I am, nay <hi>Diana,</hi> who is the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of all the Nymphs, <hi>Jupiter, Apollo,</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:53527:22"/>
and almo<U+017F>t all the Gods, <U+017F>aid I unto her, have <U+017F>lighted Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and courted Nymphs.
But never was any <U+017F>o faire as this, into who<U+017F>e hands I do <U+017F>ubmit my <U+017F>oul &amp; my life: upon
this, kneeling down, I took her hand and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it often, whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported that
<U+017F>he gave no an<U+017F>wer; which <hi>Delia</hi> perceiving, <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, will you let this Cavalier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
you indeed and kneel till his knees ake, before you give him any an<U+017F>wer? Then
row<U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elfe as out of a deep <U+017F>lumber, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aluted me, and afterwards an<U+017F>wered her
<U+017F>i<U+017F>ter. I hope <hi>Delia,</hi> this Cavalier will pardon the fault, and not thinke it proceeded from
any incivility, but from my feares of that danger which he is in for my cau<U+017F>e. I admire,
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Delia</hi>) that you being my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uch a coward, whereas I am <U+017F>o <U+017F>tout as
to take pri<U+017F>oner the brave<U+017F>t Cavalier in all the Army of the great <hi>Eurick;</hi> how can you
want courage, having (as he <U+017F>ayes) the heart of the valiant <hi>Alcidon?</hi> Ah <hi>Delia,</hi> an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, and <U+017F>ighed, it is a bad <U+017F>igne for me, to <U+017F>ee my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s <U+017F>o <U+017F>aint, for it <U+017F>hewes <U+017F>he has
not my heart; for if <U+017F>he had, <U+017F>he would rather pitty my mi<U+017F>ery which <U+017F>he has cau<U+017F>ed, then
feare any dangers wherein I am. Could I <hi>Alcidon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered my faire Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, remedy
the one, as well as I can the other, you had rea<U+017F>on to thinke <U+017F>o: but con<U+017F>ider, that if I
did not love this Cavalier, who complaines thus of me, I <U+017F>hould neither be in the<U+017F>e feares
wherein I am, nor he in the danger wherein he is. I an<U+017F>wered her, If you <U+017F>peak from your
heart, Madam, then cure me of the malady which proceeds from your <U+017F>elfe; and never
doubt that I can receive any harme, as long as I am in the honour of your favour:
<hi>Delia</hi> then <U+017F>miled, and <U+017F>aid; I perceive that when you have been together a little, the
pain of the one will be changed into contentment, and the feares into confidence. But le<U+017F>t
fortune <U+017F>hould hinder your de<U+017F>ignes, <U+017F>peak as low as you can, and I will go and <U+017F>it by
the Candle, <U+017F>eeming to read, that I may put it out, if any chance to come; or el<U+017F>e I will
fall in talk with them; and tell them how you doe, without bidding enter. But Cavalier,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe unto me, Remember the promi<U+017F>e which you made when
I opened the door unto you, and admitted you unto this adventure, which was, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the conditions then propo<U+017F>ed, and if you be worthy of the name of a Cavalier, you
will keep your word. You have kept your promi<U+017F>e <U+017F>o well with me, an<U+017F>wered I, that I
were a mo<U+017F>t unworthy recreant, if I did not the <U+017F>ame with you. Then, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me,
you are obliged according to the conditions e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed, not to attempt any thing, upon
any occa<U+017F>ion, nor for any re<U+017F>pect or reward what<U+017F>oever, again<U+017F>t the honour of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
who are here; but on the contrary, you ought to be contented with tho<U+017F>e favours
which they confer upon you, not <U+017F>eeking or de<U+017F>iring any greater. I will <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>heathe my
<U+017F>word in my heart, an<U+017F>wered I, then entertain a thought again<U+017F>t this ordinance<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Every
Cavalier of honour, is obliged unto it by his very Name: for that re<U+017F>pect is due, as unto
one of the principal <U+017F>tatutes of love. I ever thought, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Delia,</hi> of <hi>Alcidons</hi> di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion;
and I doe exceedingly rejoyce, you doe thus <U+017F>econd my thoughts, <U+017F>ince the law
had not been e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed but for you. How? <U+017F>aid I, not e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed but for me? was it
made onely to re<U+017F>train my indi<U+017F>cretion? Is it thought that I am more impudent than
any of the Knight errantry? That is not the rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me; but is it not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
this con<U+017F>traint <U+017F>hould be e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed for you onely in this adventure, which you terme
the adventure of perfect love, <U+017F>ince you onely are permitted to attempt it? But <U+017F>ince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you have done, you are to deal with a fiercer Champion then I am, I will leave you
together with your enemy, le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould complain of di<U+017F>advantage.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, not <U+017F>taying for my an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>he went away, and <U+017F>at down with a book in
her hand, and left my faire<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e and me together, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he would. At which
I being tran<U+017F>ported with abundance of contentment, after I was <U+017F>et down upon the bed
by her, I tooke her hand, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing it many times, I <U+017F>aid unto her: Madam I am mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of my extreame obligations, and my life is too little a price to be paid for <U+017F>uch a

                        </gap> what paines I have taken, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, to give you this te<U+017F>timony
of my good will, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e you would <U+017F>et a good value of e<U+017F>teem upon it. For though my
<U+017F>i<U+017F>ter does now <U+017F>hew her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o <U+017F>tout in the matter; yet believe me, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>he is not
alwaies <U+017F>o, and it was not weak per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions which could make her con<U+017F>ent unto it. Oh
what artifice and tricks have I u<U+017F>ed to deceive, not onely my brother in law, but all his
kindred and friends, or indeed all the whole Province. Con<U+017F>ider, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> what a <U+017F>trange
re<U+017F>olution I had in putting my honour and your life into <U+017F>o great a danger: For to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your coming into this place is no le<U+017F><U+017F>e. Madam, <U+017F>aid I, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her hand, if you
con<U+017F>ider my extream affection unto you, Love, and You were unju<U+017F>t, if you did not an<U+017F>wer
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53527:22"/>
it by extraordinary proofes of your good acceptance, and I doe confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
my merit, though it doe not equall my affection. For it is <U+017F>uch, that mo<U+017F>t certaine
death cannot make me <U+017F>tart from your <U+017F>ervice. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, if your affection
be <U+017F>uch as you <U+017F>ay, I wi<U+017F>h it may continue as long as I live. But I doe much feare
the love of a young heart. Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, doubts u<U+017F>e to enter into the <U+017F>oules of
tho<U+017F>e who are not well grounded in their Faith; and the<U+017F>e in you give me more cau<U+017F>e
to fear weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e of affection on your <U+017F>ide; for the principal effect of true love is, to remove
out of the Lover all manner of mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t of the per<U+017F>on loved, and it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to love one
whom they mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>By this, replyed <U+017F>he, you may know the grandure of my affection, <U+017F>ince having <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occa<U+017F>ions to doubt you, yet is it <U+017F>till <U+017F>tronger then all tho<U+017F>e doubtfull occa<U+017F>ions, and
makes me <U+017F>till give you <U+017F>uch te<U+017F>timonies of my good will. Yet Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her,
give me leave to <U+017F>ay in mine owne defence, that you doe wrong my love, in taxing it
with youngne<U+017F><U+017F>e, for I am twice ten years of age. Ah <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, before any good
a<U+017F><U+017F>urance can be, you had need be twice twelve. At this I laughed and <U+017F>aid: that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
were indeed requi<U+017F>ite in tho<U+017F>e who love common beauties; but for you and I, time
is not <U+017F>o much to be in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted upon; for our ties and obligations are as <U+017F>trong now, as they
will be foure yeares hence. She would have replyed, when <hi>Delia</hi> began to cough, as an
adverti<U+017F>ement, that <U+017F>he heard <U+017F>ome coming: pre<U+017F>ently after, her brother in law came to
the doore, unto whom <U+017F>he made a <U+017F>igne with her finger, and went as <U+017F>oftly to him as <U+017F>he
could, as if <U+017F>he were afraid to wake her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter; her brother in law asked her how <hi>Daphni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>
did. She complained a long while, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, and now <U+017F>he is fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>leep.
What, <U+017F>aid he, will you not come downe and dance? to what end did you el<U+017F>e
dre<U+017F><U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe in that habit? I hope brother, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter will be well
after <U+017F>he has <U+017F>lept a while, and if <U+017F>he be, I will come and fini<U+017F>h our de<U+017F>igne with the re<U+017F>t<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
but if <U+017F>he continue ill, we mu<U+017F>t deferre it until another time, and if you will come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
about halfe an hour hence, I <U+017F>hall tell you more: upon this her brother in law went
away, and <U+017F>he came unto us to tell us what he had <U+017F>aid, and when I de<U+017F>ired her to defer
it until to morrow; <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered me, I perceive <hi>Alcidon</hi> that you are all for your <U+017F>elfe,
and care not for the intere<U+017F>ts of another, <U+017F>o you can enjoy your opportunities as long as
you <U+017F>tay, you care not what becomes of us when you are gone. You doe not well, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Daphnide</hi> to make this con<U+017F>truction of what this Cavalier <U+017F>aid; for I am mo<U+017F>t confident
he has more care of us then <U+017F>o; but if he love us, as I beleeve he does, he will not take
it ill, if we leave him a little without company; I conceive it therefore be<U+017F>t, that when
my brother in law comes againe, you tell him that <hi>I</hi> am better then <hi>I</hi> was, and that if
he will come, and dance here, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall be very glad of it, <U+017F>o he bring with him as few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and as little Mu<U+017F>ique as he can; in the mean time, we will put <hi>Alcidon</hi> into this
Clo<U+017F>et which is clo<U+017F>e by my bed.</p>
                     <p>This Coun<U+017F>ell was approved of as good, and to <U+017F>hew me this Clo<U+017F>et <U+017F>he tooke the
Key, and not <U+017F>tirring from off her bed, <U+017F>he opened the doore, and cau<U+017F>ing a Candle to be
brought, <U+017F>hewed it unto me, where I found roome onely for two Chaires and a Table.
The place was fretted and gilded, and very hand<U+017F>omely furni<U+017F>hed; in this place, <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he unto me, you may be with <U+017F>afety, and if you will leave the doore a little open, you
may <U+017F>ee us dance: though you mu<U+017F>t not expect to find the magnificence of the great <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
yet I am confident this Ball will not be di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto you, by rea<U+017F>on of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
habits and new inventions. To which I an<U+017F>wered, that nothing would be di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
unto me, that plea<U+017F>ed her.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t we were thus talking, the Brother in law returned, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>oftly lea<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould
wake <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that he had almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed us: But <hi>Delia,</hi> who fir<U+017F>t heard him, did
put out the candle, lea<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee, and <U+017F>peaking a little louder, Brother, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
have but a little patience, and my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter will dance with us, <U+017F>he is awake, and <U+017F>o well as
<U+017F>he will come and <U+017F>ee us, will you not, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe to my
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e. Yes Si<U+017F>ter, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, but Brother I be<U+017F>eech you, come hither to dance,
and bring as few people, and little Mu<U+017F>icke as you can; for I am afraid lea<U+017F>t the noi<U+017F>e
<U+017F>hould cau<U+017F>e my head to ake againe. The brother was very glad of this newes, and
went in all ha<U+017F>te to tell the company: in the meane time I had le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap><U+017F>ure to take up my

me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and yet I could <U+017F>ee almo<U+017F>t all that was done in the Chamber.</p>
                     <p>We had no <U+017F>ooner put all things into order, but a great number of Cavaliers came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53527:23"/>
to the Chamber, with many faire Ladies, and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t <hi>Stiliana</hi> and <hi>Carlis,</hi> who
have accompanied my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e hither. After <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of civility (for it mu<U+017F>t be
confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that the Cavaliers of the Roman Province are the mo<U+017F>t courteous of all <hi>Gaule</hi>)
every one began to talke as the humour tooke them: At la<U+017F>t they fell into talke of the
King <hi>Euricke,</hi> and his Wars; which they being all exceedingly <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of, there was not
one in all the company, who had not <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate invective again<U+017F>t that great King.
The be<U+017F>t language any had for him, was to call him Barbarous, Cruell, the Ruiner of
<hi>Gaule,</hi> and all <hi>Europe;</hi> and then fell to wi<U+017F>hes: One wi<U+017F>hed that he were his Pri<U+017F>oner;
another to <U+017F>ee him dead; a third, that all his Armie were routed; and the be<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>h was,
that he had never beene. All this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e I heard, and judge what would have beene
my entertainment had they found me. I beleeve they had not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon left talking of this
great King, and their pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions had not been <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon layed, had they not heard the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icke,
which let them know that <hi>Delia</hi> and her Companions were ready to dance. Then
every one tooke their places, and pre<U+017F>ently after, tho<U+017F>e faire ones entred in <U+017F>uch an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
trim, and with <U+017F>uch a delicate new Aire, as I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I never <U+017F>aw any
thing more full of taking delight. I cannot now in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon any particulars, more than
concernes the <U+017F>tory in hand<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> onely let me tell you that though all was well performed,
and full of various delights, yet I could not chu<U+017F>e but thinke the time long, and wi<U+017F>hed
for an end of this Maske, becau<U+017F>e I thought it <U+017F>tole that time from me, which might be
better imployed, At la<U+017F>t, the Ball ended, and the God of <U+017F>leepe commanded all the
company to retire. <hi>Delia</hi> onely <U+017F>tayed in the Chamber with her Si<U+017F>ter; and then the
Pri<U+017F>oner of Love came out of his Pri<U+017F>on, chiding <hi>Delia</hi> for being <U+017F>o long in her dances.
Oh what bad company is this Cavaliere (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I am confident not one in
the Company is weary but your<U+017F>elfe. But <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>ince he is <U+017F>o dumpi<U+017F>h. I advice you to
packe him hence, for how can you hope to content him alone, <U+017F>ince all this company
had much adoe to afford it him? Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide</hi> faintly, all things upon earth
cannot afford us contentment, if it doe not come of our <U+017F>elves: As all the drugs in the
Univer<U+017F>e, cannot cure a body, if that body by its owne di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition be not apt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to it: And <U+017F>o <hi>Alcidon,</hi> if he will have contentment, mu<U+017F>t content him<U+017F>elfe and
not thinke that a great number of people can doe it. Madam, an<U+017F>wered I, If I
had my will in my owne power, as others have, I <U+017F>hould doe as you doe <U+017F>ay; but
<U+017F>ince I have put my will into your hands, my contentment mu<U+017F>t depend only upon you:
Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Delia,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, doe not repent of the time you have kept this Cavaliere ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
up by your bed <U+017F>ide, for methinkes he hath learned to <U+017F>peake very well.</p>
                     <p>After <U+017F>ome other di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, they concluded to put me into the Clo<U+017F>et againe; untill
they were undre<U+017F>t, and their maids in the Chamber were gone; but when they opened
the doore unto me, I found <hi>Delia</hi> in bed with her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, and <U+017F>he taking notice that I was
not well plea<U+017F>ed at it: What Cavaliere, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, why doe you frowne upon
me? It is your <U+017F>elfe that is the cau<U+017F>e of my being here. I doe perceive, an<U+017F>wered I, that
<hi>I</hi> am the cau<U+017F>e, and <hi>I</hi> cannot be <U+017F>orry for it, <U+017F>ince my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e will have it <U+017F>o. The
truth is, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould have been very glad, if <hi>I</hi> could have <U+017F>poke unto her without a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e:
Doe you not know, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that there <U+017F>hould be Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es unto all good Contracts.
Love, replyed <hi>I,</hi> never needs any witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, and love will <U+017F>erve us for witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, if you
need any: Love, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, cannot be a Witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, for he is Judge. If Love, replyed I,
cannot be a Witne<U+017F><U+017F>e in matters of Love; much le<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Diana,</hi> who is alwayes a declared
enemy. Though <hi>I</hi> cannot be a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, yet <hi>I</hi> may be the Executioner of the
puni<U+017F>hment. If you de<U+017F>ign that, an<U+017F>wered <hi>I,</hi> have <hi>I</hi> not a good occa<U+017F>ion to de<U+017F>ire you
not here? <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who had not <U+017F>poken all this while, interrupted us, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing
her <U+017F>elfe unto me; It was <hi>I Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that appointed her to be there, and my
rea<U+017F>on for it, is <U+017F>o much to your advantage, as when you know it, you will not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry;
for it is not to witne<U+017F><U+017F>e again<U+017F>t you, nor accu<U+017F>e you: <hi>I</hi> am fully a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi>
di<U+017F>eretion, and of the power which he hath given me over him: but being more in
doubt of my <U+017F>elfe, then of you, <hi>I</hi> de<U+017F>ired her pre<U+017F>ence to keep me from doing more than <hi>I</hi>
was re<U+017F>olved, and le<U+017F>t my good will to you, <U+017F>hould make me goe beyond the limits of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and fittingne<U+017F><U+017F>e. <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>I</hi> unto her, that the<U+017F>e feares in you, are

<hi>Alcidon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, you mu<U+017F>t love me, as <hi>I</hi> love you, and know that <U+017F>he who de<U+017F>erves
your love, ought not only to be without blame, but al<U+017F>o without <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of any blame.</p>

We talked <U+017F>o long, and with <U+017F>o much delight upon this <U+017F>ubject, as <hi>I</hi> took no notice how
day began to break: and then, the con<U+017F>ultation was, whether <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould depart or <U+017F>tay.
The faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who was <U+017F>till apprehen<U+017F>ive of my being in any danger, <U+017F>he was at
the fir<U+017F>t, of an opinion with <hi>Delia,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould be gone before it was any lighter: but
when <hi>I</hi> hinted unto her that perhaps, it would be long before <U+017F>uch another opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <U+017F>eeing her would be found; <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented unto my <U+017F>tay, though <hi>Delia</hi> was of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
mind. But love being above all rea<U+017F>ons, it was re<U+017F>olved that <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay that day
in this place, and that when night came <hi>I</hi> might depart with more <U+017F>afety: And to the
end <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>tay alone in my little pri<U+017F>on, the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> re<U+017F>olved to keep her
bed all day, and <U+017F>eem as if <U+017F>he were not well: for this Clo<U+017F>et was <U+017F>o near her beds head,
as we could talke together without being heard by any in the Chamber. This being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
upon, <hi>Delia</hi> undertook to acquaint my guide with all nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in<U+017F>tructions what
to doe, and to appoint tho<U+017F>e Cavaliers to keep them<U+017F>elves clo<U+017F>e till night.</p>
                     <p>Having often heard our Druids di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the Great <hi>Tautates,</hi> and of the immortal
<U+017F>oules of men, who after this life do <U+017F>it within heaven, where they remaine for ever: I
wondered, but could not comprehend that <U+017F>uch a life <U+017F>hould be delightfull, <U+017F>ince they <U+017F>ay,
that they never eat nor drinke, or <U+017F>leep, or any thing el<U+017F>e, but perpetually thinke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template,
thinking that time <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem very tedious unto them, <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o long even
pa<U+017F>t all imagination. But I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that now I know the contrary, when I con<U+017F>ider
how quickly and plea<U+017F>ingly hours pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away, when I was <U+017F>o near this faire one; for I
was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed when I <U+017F>aw it was day, thinking the night not an hour long, <U+017F>o quickly
had the time flown away.</p>
                     <p>Every one of the hou<U+017F>e being up, <hi>Delia</hi> was con<U+017F>trained to the like, and I mu<U+017F>t be cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tered
up in my clo<U+017F>et: for <U+017F>he would not <U+017F>uffer me to <U+017F>ee when <U+017F>he dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
of her maids who waited upon her. I would gladly have done the office of her
maid, and helped her, but <U+017F>he would not permit it: <hi>Delia</hi> al<U+017F>o was again<U+017F>t it, and bad me
get into my Cage<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I pray Love, <U+017F>aid I, be revenged upon you for it: Love, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, has
nothing to doe with <hi>Diana.</hi> No? <U+017F>aid I; yet <hi>Diana</hi> quitted heaven for a ki<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion;</hi>
and <U+017F>he was not <U+017F>o coy, but for a fleece of Wool <U+017F>he was very kind unto <hi>Pan,</hi> though
he had a cloven foot and hornes on his head. Let that <hi>Diana</hi> of whom you <U+017F>peak, replied
<U+017F>he, an<U+017F>wer the Calumny as <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>e; but let me tell you, that unle<U+017F><U+017F>e my minde alter
very much, I will never ki<U+017F>s him that is a<U+017F>leep; and as for the hornes of <hi>Pan,</hi> certainly if
ever I love any, I had rather he <U+017F>hould have them then I; yet, <U+017F>aid I unto her, the Moon,
who<U+017F>e name you have, does weare them very han<U+017F>omly. That is, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, becau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>he is not married, and what <U+017F>he does, is onely to adverti<U+017F>e lovers whom <U+017F>he lights in the
night, that the hornes which they are going to give another, <U+017F>hall at <U+017F>ome time or other
be given unto them againe. But, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you prolong the time, get into your Clo<U+017F>et;
<U+017F>o <U+017F>he pu<U+017F>hed me in, and locked the door upon me: Then calling in the maids which
were in the next room waiting <U+017F>he <U+017F>ilently dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe, pretending that <hi>Daphnide</hi>
was not well: afterwards drawing the curtaines of the Windows, <U+017F>he went to give <U+017F>uch
orders as were re<U+017F>olved upon; in the meane time, although there was <U+017F>ome in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
yet for all that, we talked together, without opening the doore; and though it was
in very low voice, yet one of the maids pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by the bed, did hear us, not what we <U+017F>aid,
but onely confu<U+017F>ed whi<U+017F>pers. By fortune, <hi>Delia</hi> being careful of us, came back into the
Chamber at the <U+017F>ame time: The maid then addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto her, and told, that <U+017F>he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter was <U+017F>icker, then <U+017F>he imagined; why? <U+017F>aid <hi>Delia,</hi> becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered the maid,
<U+017F>he talkes to her <U+017F>elfe, as if <U+017F>he were di<U+017F>tracted; what did <U+017F>he <U+017F>ay? replied <hi>Delia;</hi> I did
not heare the words di<U+017F>tinctly, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, but <hi>I</hi> am <U+017F>ure <U+017F>he talked. Alas, alas, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Delia,</hi> doe you not know it is her cu<U+017F>tome every morning, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he wakes, to <U+017F>ay her
prayers. The wench believed <hi>Delia,</hi> who a little after came to us, and told the <U+017F>tory, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verti<U+017F>ing
us to <U+017F>peak lower. I <U+017F>hall, <U+017F>aid I; but, faire <hi>Delia,</hi> is it not better to <U+017F>end them
all out, that the door may be opened. Ah, ah, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and laughed, I am now faire <hi>Delia,</hi>
and not long <U+017F>ince nothing but homed <hi>Diana,</hi> who loved clubfooted <hi>Pan</hi> for a fleece of
wool; pray <U+017F>tay there where you are, until you have learned to <U+017F>peak a little better of
<hi>Diana,</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>he will be angry, and puni<U+017F>h both you, and us al<U+017F>o. Upon this, <U+017F>he went
to <U+017F>end out the maids and commanded one of them to bring up <U+017F>ome meat for her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter,
and to bring more then ordinary, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he did not <U+017F>up the la<U+017F>t night. The maid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
pre<U+017F>ently as <U+017F>he was commanded; Then <hi>Delia</hi> <U+017F>hut the door: Now <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53527:24"/>
Cavalier <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee how I will be revenged of him; then opening his door, Come Cavalier,
continued <U+017F>he, before you receive the puni<U+017F>hment which I intend you, I have brought you
<U+017F>ome victuals, to <U+017F>trengthen you a little, for I <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry you <U+017F>hould die, before
you have felt my revenge. She <U+017F>poke this with <U+017F>uch a plea<U+017F>ant aire, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to forbear laughing: and after her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter had taken a little broath, But <hi>Delia,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
where did you get this? will it not be perceived? yes, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, if I had no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
then you. Come, come, no more que<U+017F>tions, here it is, eat and be thankful, and
the reffu<U+017F>e will <U+017F>erve a hungry Cavalier, whom I wi<U+017F>h <U+017F>o ill unto. It is better, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, to
let him have it all; for having fa<U+017F>ted <U+017F>o long, I am <U+017F>ure he has more need of it then <hi>I</hi> have.
Upon this, <U+017F>he forced her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter to take a little, and offered me <U+017F>ome al<U+017F>o, which <hi>I</hi> refu<U+017F>ed:
Nay, nay, take it, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, it will down with the help of a willing mind. In <U+017F>uch talk as
this, we pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away all the morning, and dinner time being come, <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>hut up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
lea<U+017F>t <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een by tho<U+017F>e who brought up meat: The wor<U+017F>t was, that din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was no <U+017F>ooner done, but the Chamber was full of Gallants, whereof <U+017F>ome perhaps
had the <U+017F>ting of love upon them; and by fortune; the brother in law <U+017F>itting on the beds
<U+017F>ide, he cau<U+017F>ed a Chair to be <U+017F>et for the principal of them, <U+017F>o near me, that <hi>I</hi> could <U+017F>carce
breath but be heard. Con<U+017F>ider <hi>Adamas,</hi> in what a ca<U+017F>e <hi>I</hi> had been in, if <hi>I</hi> had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to cough or <U+017F>neeze. The mo<U+017F>t of their talke was of King <hi>Eurick,</hi> and the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which were making in divers places again<U+017F>t him; of which <hi>I</hi> was very glad to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that <hi>I</hi> might acquaint the King therewith, which afterwards did him good <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
But the wor<U+017F>t of all was, they <U+017F>tayed talking until night, though in the Chamber of
a <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on, and never from about her bed: At la<U+017F>t, having a mind to walk, they left
her all alone; and then the doores being <U+017F>hut, <hi>I</hi> came out of the Clo<U+017F>et which <hi>Delia</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto me. Well, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, How doe you like the adventure? pray what will you call
it? Shall the name of it be Perfect love, or Extream patience? It is, <U+017F>aid <hi>I</hi> unto her, the
mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ing adventure that ever <hi>I</hi> had. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> what doe you think of your
being <U+017F>o long in that Cell? <hi>I</hi> think, Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>I,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> am infinitely happy in
being near you. You may <U+017F>ay what you plea<U+017F>e, replied <hi>Delia,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> am confident you
think liberty better then a clo<U+017F>e pri<U+017F>on. If <hi>Diana</hi> knew what it was to love, an<U+017F>wered <hi>I,</hi>
and what contentment it is to be neare the per<U+017F>on loved; <U+017F>he would not be <U+017F>o incredulous
as <U+017F>he is, but on the contrary that <hi>I</hi> have found the Proverb to be fal<U+017F>e, which <U+017F>aith, No
Pri<U+017F>on <U+017F>weet; for <hi>I</hi> never found half the delight and contentment in the Palace of Great
<hi>Eurick,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> have done in this Pri<U+017F>on.</p>
                     <p>We continued in this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e a long while, and it was <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet unto me, that hours
<U+017F>eemed but minuts: and <U+017F>upper time being come, <hi>I</hi> mu<U+017F>t be againe <U+017F>hut up, but it was for
a <U+017F>hort time; for <hi>Daphnide</hi> being as <hi>I</hi> think, <U+017F>orry to leave me alone <U+017F>o long, <U+017F>he made
<U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te, that her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter complained <U+017F>he had not time enough to eat: yet <U+017F>he had me in
memory; which done, <hi>I</hi> be<U+017F>eeched the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that <U+017F>ince <hi>I</hi> was to depart <U+017F>o <U+017F>oone,
<U+017F>he would be plea<U+017F>ed to put off all vi<U+017F>its for that night, to the end that the time which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
might be imployed with her, which <U+017F>he might wel do by feigning her <U+017F>elf not wel,
and by pretending that their being <U+017F>o long about her bed that afternoon, was the cau<U+017F>e
of it. With much a doe, <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented, and <hi>Delia</hi> went pre<U+017F>ently from her to bid all the
company good night, and to de<U+017F>ire excu<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he went to take her re<U+017F>t <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>I</hi> was all alone with my faire Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: For <hi>Delia,</hi> le<U+017F>t any <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e us, had locked the door, and carried the key with her. Love then, and this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
gave me a great alarm: for loving this fair Lady mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, and <U+017F>eeing
my <U+017F>elfe alone with her, it was enough to invite me unto the highe<U+017F>t <U+017F>train of Court<U+017F>hip:
two other great Con<U+017F>iderations pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves unto me: one was, the a<U+017F><U+017F>urances
which <U+017F>he gave me of her good will, which ought not to make me the more bold: The
other was, The precepts which I received from Great <hi>Eurick,</hi> not to let opportunity
<U+017F>lip; yet judge, Madam, how my affection was tempered: you know, Madam, that all

you live, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, as you have done for the time pa<U+017F>t; for if you <U+017F>hould, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

How <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and <U+017F>tarted up out of her bed; Do you vow to di<U+017F>obey me? Con<U+017F>ider

<U+017F>elf into the Clo<U+017F>et without giving any an<U+017F>wer; but when <U+017F>he was come into the room, &amp;
I <U+017F>aw her alone, I came out, &amp; would have taken the hand of my fair Mi<U+017F>tris, but <U+017F>he pulled it
away in an angry manner, <U+017F>aying unto me <U+017F>o loud that <hi>Delia</hi> heard; <U+017F>ince you are in
that mind <hi>Alcidon,</hi> you would doe me a plea<U+017F>ure, if you would trouble me no longer.
<hi>Delia</hi> hearing her give me this language, had an opinion that I had courted her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter in
<U+017F>ome way that was di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto her: This opinion moved her to <U+017F>mile and <U+017F>ay; I
<U+017F>ee that much may be done in a little time, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>uch a change is hapned in this little
while I have been away<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I dare lay a wager Cavalier, that you have not ob<U+017F>erved the
cu<U+017F>tomes and conditions which I told you off when you fir<U+017F>t undertooke this adventure.
Nay, nay, an<U+017F>wered her <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, but perhaps he hath done much wor<U+017F>e; for had he done
as you <U+017F>ay, he had been onely a perjured Lover, whereas by this which he hath done, he
hath declared him<U+017F>elfe perfidious and a Traytor. Ob<U+017F>erve <U+017F>age <hi>Delia,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto her,
two great injuries, and yet you <U+017F>ee me indure them patiently, untill that you have heard
us both, and I will make you my Judge, hoping that you will appoint what <U+017F>atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hall make me.</p>
                     <p>The Cavalier, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> is infinitely impudent; for he demands <U+017F>atisfaction,
where he de<U+017F>erves puni<U+017F>hment: but <hi>Delja</hi> <U+017F>ince he hath made choice of you for his judge,
<hi>I</hi> will al<U+017F>o chu<U+017F>e you for mine, that you may appoint a puni<U+017F>hment <U+017F>utable to his crime,
if you can find one equall unto it; and becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>ay, that I am too bitter in
my relation, <hi>I</hi> am contented you have it from his owne mouth. Then <hi>I</hi> began to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer
very calmly, Ob<U+017F>erve <hi>I</hi> be<U+017F>eech you oh my Judge, how my affection <U+017F>urmounts the
rigour of this Lady, <U+017F>he requires that you <U+017F>hould cruelly puni<U+017F>h me, and if <hi>I</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a fault, <hi>I</hi> make the <U+017F>ame reque<U+017F>t; but if <U+017F>he have done (<hi>I</hi> will not <U+017F>ay a fault, for <hi>I</hi>
do not think <U+017F>he can) but if <U+017F>he have done any injury again<U+017F>t my love <hi>I</hi> do not require that
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be puni<U+017F>hed; for if <U+017F>he <U+017F>mart, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall die of the paine; all <hi>I</hi> de<U+017F>ire is, that <U+017F>he
may not offend again<U+017F>t that affection which <hi>I</hi> beare her. <hi>I</hi> de<U+017F>ire, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Delia,</hi> that if
you will have me your Judge, <hi>I</hi> may heare your difference. Heare it <hi>I</hi> be<U+017F>eech you <U+017F>aid
<hi>I</hi> unto her, from her owne mouth; for be<U+017F>ides that, <hi>I</hi> know <U+017F>he can <U+017F>peake nothing but
truth; it is rea<U+017F>on you <U+017F>hould know it from her, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he accu<U+017F>eth me, and would have
me puni<U+017F>hed. Tis true, <U+017F>aid <hi>Delia,</hi> it is your part to <U+017F>peake fir<U+017F>t: <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
it in few words, replyed <U+017F>he, for our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was not long; he <U+017F>pake the<U+017F>e words
unto me. How Madam, doe you command me to live? I an<U+017F>wered him, I would not
have you live as you have done for the time pa<U+017F>t; for if you doe <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall never pardon you,
after I have given you <U+017F>uch te<U+017F>timonies of my good will. He an<U+017F>wered; this is a mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>trange command, and I doe vow that I will never obey it, and when I charged him with
his di<U+017F>obedience you entred, and hindred me from knowing what he would an<U+017F>wer.
Then <hi>Delia</hi> turning towards me: Has <hi>Daphnide</hi> told the truth, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he? Yes my Judg, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
I, and upon the<U+017F>e words, I require ju<U+017F>tice; as for the injury <U+017F>he offered in calling
me perfidious and Traytor, I <U+017F>ay nothing, becau<U+017F>e you heard them, and be<U+017F>ides that, they
are but con<U+017F>equents of the fir<U+017F>t offence. But <U+017F>aid <hi>Delia,</hi> which way hath <U+017F>he offended you?
For Cavaler, an<U+017F>wer unto the<U+017F>e que<U+017F>tions; doe you not pro<U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe a lover of this
Lady? Yes, an<U+017F>wered I, <U+017F>o, that when I cea<U+017F>e to love, I cea<U+017F>e to live. Then replyed
<hi>Delia,</hi> do you not know, that it is one of the principalle<U+017F>t laws of Love, for a Lover to obey
the per<U+017F>on loved? Yes, an<U+017F>wered I, and <U+017F>o, the commands be not contradictory to his affection; as
if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould command him not to love her, <U+017F>he is not to be obeyed. Tis true, replyed <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide,</hi>
for every thing doth naturally fly that which would de<U+017F>troy it: but how can you
excu<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elfe as not offending again<U+017F>t this Precept, in this occa<U+017F>ion, where you have
not onely thought the command which <U+017F>he made that you <U+017F>hould love her, to be <U+017F>trange
and hard, but al<U+017F>o has vowed to di<U+017F>obey her. My Judge, an<U+017F>wered I, I did prote<U+017F>t it,
and I vow and prote<U+017F>t it <U+017F>till; and with this re<U+017F>olution, that if I could die and die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

how he <U+017F>peaks, and judge whether he does not de<U+017F>erve puni<U+017F>hment. My Judge, (<U+017F>aid
I and <U+017F>miled) let my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e command me to fight again<U+017F>t a whole Army of men; let

<U+017F>he has over me, let her put me to what te<U+017F>t <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>es; for I am <U+017F>ure <U+017F>he cannot command
me any thing, be it never <U+017F>o dangerous or full of difficulty, but my love will prompt me
immediately to obedience. Doe you not remember that when you fir<U+017F>t admitted me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
and enjoyned conditions upon me, how I promi<U+017F>ed to performe them all, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they did not contradict my love? I doe remember it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Delia:</hi> Then my
Judge, replyed I, methinkes you <U+017F>hould not take it ill, that I <U+017F>hould make this vow and
prote<U+017F>tation of di<U+017F>obedience unto my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, for had I done otherwi<U+017F>e I had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
and a Traytor, both to her and Love. I asked her how it was her plea<U+017F>ure I
<U+017F>hould live; I would not have you live, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, as you have done for the time
pa<U+017F>t. Now if I did love her for the time pa<U+017F>t as much as a heart could love, in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me not to love her as I did for the time pa<U+017F>t, is not this to command me not to
love her; and <U+017F>hould I not be di<U+017F>loyall and perfidious if I <U+017F>hould obey <U+017F>uch a command?
No, no Madam I cannot doe it; I loved you when I was a Child; I have continued it
when I was a man, and <U+017F>hall love you till death; nothing can divert me from this re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
it is <U+017F>o rivitted in my heart that it will never out as long as I live, nay, it will
be found in my heart after my death. <hi>Delia</hi> then began to <U+017F>mile, and <U+017F>aid, I <U+017F>ee that Love
is a Child, and a little thing will <U+017F>et him a crying: my <U+017F>entence is this, I doe ordaine
fir<U+017F>t that all differences <U+017F>hall cea<U+017F>e; then, that <hi>Alcidon,</hi> as a puni<U+017F>hment for his fault in

ki<U+017F><U+017F>e the hand of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; and that <hi>Daphnide</hi> as a puni<U+017F>hment for commanding
him a thing which <U+017F>he would not have done, had <U+017F>he rightly under<U+017F>tood it, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall
ki<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Alcidon,</hi> as a te<U+017F>timony of her repentance. This judgement was executed to my

I will therefore onely tell you, that being ready to depart, after I had deferred it as long
as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could; I took the hand of my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e and kneeling downe I <U+017F>aid thus
unto her; I am now Madam upon the la<U+017F>t minute of my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e; for <hi>Delia</hi> and the
time forceth me to depart; I perceive that neither of them are <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and
for ought I perceive, you, who are the cau<U+017F>e of it, are as in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible as they. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<U+017F>he, doe not complaine of me; but con<U+017F>ider, that if I did not love you, I
<U+017F>hould never run the hazard of my honour, and your life, which is dearer to me then my
owne, and you thinke that the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which blinds my eyes unto all the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations
mu<U+017F>t needs be very great. Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, this is it which mo<U+017F>t amazeth me, that
<U+017F>ince you have already done <U+017F>o much for me, you <U+017F>hould now doe <U+017F>o little. Then her
Si<U+017F>ter being at a little di<U+017F>tance, doing <U+017F>omething in the Chamber, <hi>Daphnide</hi> an<U+017F>wered

into this adventure were, that you <U+017F>hould not be too importunate in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
but to be patient and per<U+017F>evere. At this word <U+017F>he held her hand unto me, which
with a <U+017F>igh I devoutly ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed. Then, <U+017F>aid I unto her, all that I have to doe, is to pray
unto the great God <hi>Saturne,</hi> who is the Governour of time, that he will make it pa<U+017F><U+017F>e
away quickly, <U+017F>o as I may arrive at my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e before my death: otherwi<U+017F>e, that if

the clocke <U+017F>trucke twelve, which was the hour of my departure, by appointment. And
<hi>Delia,</hi> le<U+017F>t he who <U+017F>tayed for me at the doore <U+017F>hould be perceived, would not let me <U+017F>tay

expect to obtain much, <U+017F>ince you are <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teemed by all that know you;
<U+017F>o as your merits might ju<U+017F>tly plead highly in your behalfe; but your love cannot yet
pretend unto much, being <U+017F>o young, as I cannot tell whether your affection can be called
by the name of Love; for the name of man, mu<U+017F>t not be attributed unto one which is
but newly crawled out of his Cradle. How <U+017F>aire <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter of my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid I unto

you, I will give you <U+017F>uch advice, as que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F><U+017F>e, if you doe follow it, you will bring
your enterpri<U+017F>e to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e; I am a little elder then my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, and con<U+017F>equently have a little
more experience then <U+017F>he, and perhaps then you either; therefore doe not <U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which I <U+017F>hall give you, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you meane to repent it. My <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter loves you, <U+017F>he
has told me as much, and you may believe it, by her thus hazarding her honour for a
<U+017F>ight of you: but <U+017F>he is very young, and by con<U+017F>equence naturally <U+017F>ubject unto the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilities
of youth. Youth is apt to take any kind of impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and as apt to lo<U+017F>e it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again;
their moi<U+017F>t memories are like <U+017F>oft wax, you may imprint what you will, and it
will as ea<U+017F>ily lo<U+017F>e the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, if any new print be offered: therefore to avoid this
danger, and if you will <U+017F>till be loved, and well loved, you mu<U+017F>t by your pre<U+017F>ence often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, if you cannot doe it as much as is requi<U+017F>ite by pre<U+017F>ence, let it
be by Letters, and me<U+017F><U+017F>ages: for when <U+017F>uch unhop't for, and unexpected Complements
doe come, they work very great effects: for in love, tho<U+017F>e contentments which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
<U+017F>eem to be due, and it is an injury if they be retarded or refu<U+017F>ed; whereas others
that come unlook't for, work great effect upon that <U+017F>oul which receives them. Fair <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
<U+017F>aid I unto her, If I could requite the<U+017F>e favours which I receive from you, with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of my life, I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elfe much beholding unto fortune: But not daring to
hope for <U+017F>o much happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, I be<U+017F>eech you believe, that in te<U+017F>timony of the e<U+017F>teem which
I have of your judgement and good advice, I will mo<U+017F>t religiou<U+017F>ly ob<U+017F>erve it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
my obligations unto you in my memory as long as I live; and in requital, though I
have not a heart of mine own to pre<U+017F>ent unto you, I will engage my <U+017F>elfe to <U+017F>end you one,
which you will e<U+017F>teem much above that which was mine, and is now <hi>Daphnides. Alcidon</hi>
(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled) I perceive by your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that every thing turnes to its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
for when you came fir<U+017F>t into the Garden, you talked thus of lo<U+017F>ing your heart, and
doe the <U+017F>ame at your going out: I wi<U+017F>h that <U+017F>he who has it, may long injoy it: and in
the meane time, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee what effects your promi<U+017F>es will produce, as well in ob<U+017F>erving
my advice, as in <U+017F>ending me this heart which you have promi<U+017F>ed.</p>
                     <p>Being now come to the Garden door, I took my leave of her; and having found my
guide, we walked a gentle pace towards our rocks, but as if the heavens frowned at our
<U+017F>eparation: they were upon a <U+017F>uddain over<U+017F>pread with Clouds, <U+017F>o as we did not onely lo<U+017F>e
the light of the Moon, but were <U+017F>o wet with Rain, as we were forced to <U+017F>helter our <U+017F>elves
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53527:26"/>
under a thick tree, until the fury of it was over. My guide had <U+017F>o lo<U+017F>t his aime of the way,
as when we went unto tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>tayed for us, he wandered, and led me unto the head
of that Fountaine, which gives both the name and beginning unto the River of <hi>Sorgues.</hi>
This Fountaine is <U+017F>o be<U+017F>et with great Rocks, that it <U+017F>eemes as if it were inclo<U+017F>ed with
high walles every way, but that by which we came. When this Spring is calm, it <U+017F>eems
to be a great well, who<U+017F>e water being too full, runs over: But <U+017F>ometimes, as my guide
told me, it is mo<U+017F>t horrid to behold: For, <U+017F>aid he, do you <U+017F>ee that high Rock upon your
left hand, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that it will often belch out his water as high as it, with <U+017F>uch a
fury and noi<U+017F>e, that no Tempe<U+017F>t at Sea does equal it. Doe they not know the cau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>aid I unto him? No, an<U+017F>wered he; for <U+017F>ometimes it begins to be in this fury, when the
weather is very faire, and as now you <U+017F>ee, when it raines, it will be as calme as other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The cau<U+017F>e, replyed I, mu<U+017F>t needs be from wind inclo<U+017F>ed, which forceth the waters
thus.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t we were talking thus, the Rain <U+017F>till continued, and I, having found a hollow
Rock, under which I could <U+017F>helter my <U+017F>elfe, I advi<U+017F>ed the Guide to go unto them who
<U+017F>tayed for me, in the mean time I would re<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf, and when the raine was pa<U+017F>t, the
Moon would <U+017F>hine, and help us in the way.</p>
                     <p>Now, Reverend Father, I <U+017F>hall here relate unto you a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange adventure, not as
pertinent to our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, but for the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F><U+017F>e of it. When my Guide was gone, as
I commanded him, and I alone under this wild Rock, Love, out of pitty would not let
me be long without him, for I fell into the <U+017F>weet thoughts of <hi>Daphnide;</hi> and after I had
plea<U+017F>ed my <U+017F>elfe a while in tho<U+017F>e raptures, me thought the weather cleared up, and the
Moon breaking through the thick Clouds, <U+017F>hined as bright as ever I <U+017F>aw it: This invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me out of my hollow Rock, and whil<U+017F>t I was looking about me that way which I
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed my company would come, I heard the Fountaine make a noi<U+017F>e. I went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
to the <U+017F>ide of it, thinking it would ri<U+017F>e up, according to reports: and having a
de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee this wonder, I <U+017F>et my <U+017F>elfe down upon a <U+017F>tone near unto this Fountaine; then
did I <U+017F>ee a thing which indeed is beyond beliefe, without a <U+017F>ight: I <U+017F>aw the water ri<U+017F>e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
its bank, up to the height of four feet, and then it appeared to be like an old man
from the middle upward, with long haire dangling about his <U+017F>houlders, and a beard
hanging down to his brea<U+017F>t, which being wet as well as his hair of his head, <U+017F>eemed to be
<U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal <U+017F>treams about him, with another that flowed out of a pot which he held
under his left arm. This old man was Crowned with Rock-fern, and Ru<U+017F>hes, and for a
Scepter, held a great Reed in his right hand. Whil<U+017F>t I <U+017F>tood wondring at this Vi<U+017F>ion,
I <U+017F>aw the water to divide it <U+017F>elfe into <U+017F>everal <U+017F>treames, and as <U+017F>oon as he touched them,
I <U+017F>aw <U+017F>o many Naiades, or water-Nymphs about him, as there was <U+017F>treames in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
All out of reverence, bowed unto him, and he rai<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elfe above them, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Throne which the water made for him, they came to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e his hand, and to pre<U+017F>ent
him with <U+017F>ome Gifts: one pre<U+017F>ented unto him a Chaire, made and covered with Mo<U+017F>s;
another, a Garland of Ru<U+017F>hes and Ivie; another, a Girdle of Fern; another, a basket of
Che<U+017F>nuts; one offered Poites of water flowers; another, a Net full of <U+017F>everall Fi<U+017F>hes:
To be brief, every one gave him <U+017F>omething, as te<U+017F>timonies of their good will, which he
received with many thanks. After this, with a loud <U+017F>hril voyce, he <U+017F>aid, Oh Divine Nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,
whom the De<U+017F>tinies have ordained to live in waters, and who complain that you
are confined unto my little Spring, whereas your <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters <U+017F>wim with full <U+017F>pred armes in the
<hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> and <hi>Durance.</hi> Cea<U+017F>e your complaints, and with me rejoyce at the advantageous
choice which they have made for you. For though the limits of our Dominion is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
unto others in largene<U+017F><U+017F>e: yet we doe excell them in <U+017F>o many priviledges, that we
have no rea<U+017F>on to envy any of our Neighbours: For our life is <U+017F>weet and quiet, none
comes to break our <U+017F>leep, nor interrupt our pa<U+017F>times; our banks are never <U+017F>meered with
Homicides, nor are our waters ruffled with the <U+017F>welling weight of <U+017F>ayling Ships. But
that which ought mo<U+017F>t to content us, nay which makes us glorious, above all the Rivers
of <hi>Europe,</hi> is, my divine <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters, the infallible promi<U+017F>e which we have from De<U+017F>tiny, and
which was confirmed with the<U+017F>e words.</p>
                     <p>Happy <hi>Daemon</hi> of <hi>Sorgues,</hi> Hearken (<U+017F>aid he unto me) to the promi<U+017F>e which I make
unto thee, Nine and twenty ages <U+017F>hall be no <U+017F>ooner pa<U+017F>t, but upon thy bankes <U+017F>hall come
the <hi>Florentine</hi> Swan, which <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ing <U+017F>o <U+017F>weetly under the <U+017F>hade of a Laurel tree, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>hing
thereby both Gods and Men, he <U+017F>hall for ever make thy Name famous through all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53527:26"/>
the world, and <U+017F>hall make thee excell in honour, all the Rivers which like thy <U+017F>elfe doe
empty them<U+017F>elves into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>He would have continued on, when hearing <U+017F>ome noi<U+017F>e, and as I beleeve, e<U+017F>pying
my Companions as they were coming to me, I was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed that he and his troope
da<U+017F>hing the water with their hands, they made it ri<U+017F>e <U+017F>o high that I lo<U+017F>t my <U+017F>ight, and
I lay as if I were a<U+017F>leepe, as tho<U+017F>e who came unto me told me, not <U+017F>o neere the Fountain
as I thought my <U+017F>elfe, but in the <U+017F>ame place where the Guide left me when he went
unto them.</p>
                     <p>This <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> was a mo<U+017F>t miraculous vi<U+017F>ion, which truly for my part I beleeve
to be a dream, but not an ordinary one; for doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e this doth <U+017F>ignifie that <U+017F>ome great
and remarkable per<U+017F>on <U+017F>hall inhabit in tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>olitary Rockes, and make tho<U+017F>e bankes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
by the renowne he <U+017F>hall get; which is to be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed will be very great, <U+017F>ince the
promi<U+017F>e of it is made by the De<U+017F>tinies, with <U+017F>uch advantagious words. I cannot tell,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> whether it was a Dreame or no; but I am <U+017F>ure, that I thought my <U+017F>elfe to
be awake: and afterwards he continued thus:</p>
                     <p>I tooke Hor<U+017F>e, and to omit all the particulars of my returne, after many dangers,
I arrived at the place where I left King <hi>Eurick,</hi> who received me with many a Carra<U+017F><U+017F>e;
and as it plea<U+017F>ed him to honour me <U+017F>o farre as to love me <U+017F>o would he often aske me how
I did thrive in my love; <U+017F>o now taking me by my hand, he carried me into a private
roome where none could heare. Come, Lov's Souldier, <U+017F>aid he unto me, Does all goe
well in your enterpri<U+017F>e, and have you had a good journey or no? Sir, <U+017F>aid I, when it
<U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e you, I <U+017F>hall give a true relation of it, and then your <U+017F>elfe may judge. Let it
be now, <U+017F>aid he unto me, for I much long to know whether you are as pro<U+017F>perous in
Love, as I have been in Warre: Then in obedience to his command, I related the whole
Adventure; but I have <U+017F>ince heartily repented that I <U+017F>poke <U+017F>o advantagiou<U+017F>ly of <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
beauty and <U+017F>pirit; for I perceived that it plea<U+017F>ed him exceedingly to heare that all
I obtained was good words, and a few ki<U+017F><U+017F>es: then would I have applyed a remedy to
my errour, but it was too late: yet to turne the matter, I began to extoll <hi>Delia,</hi> and
<U+017F>o, that at fir<U+017F>t I did beleeve I <U+017F>hould imbarque him there. The King, who was more
<U+017F>ubtill then to beleeve it, to put me out of my <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, did <U+017F>et <U+017F>o good a face upon the
matter, that perhaps any other might have beene deceived as well as I. Oh what gro<U+017F><U+017F>e
folly it is for any Lover to acquaint his Ma<U+017F>ter with his affection! For it did kindle in
him <U+017F>uch thoughts as were not in him before, and put him into hopes of being, if not
a Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or of my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet at le<U+017F>t a pretender unto it; yet God knowes what force
ambition has upon the <U+017F>pirit of a woman, e<U+017F>pecially upon a woman of a generous <U+017F>oule.
Whil<U+017F>t we were thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing upon the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, newes was brought the King, that
they of <hi>Arles</hi> were re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ubmit them<U+017F>elves into his hands, upon tho<U+017F>e conditions he
offered unto them; to wit, the con<U+017F>ervation of their Franchi<U+017F>es and priviledges, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the Inhabitans of the Town were <U+017F>o couragious, as they would never have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented
to acknowledge him. This is the rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>aid the King, and tooke me a<U+017F>ide, why
I aske you whether you are as pro<U+017F>perous in Love, as I am in Warre: For this City is
the chiefe of all the Province, and it rendring it <U+017F>elfe unto me, it is to be thought that
all the re<U+017F>t after its example, will doe the like. Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, it is a very happy
Omen unto me, and if I doe bring about my de<U+017F>igne, I will not change my prize for
yours. The King imbraced me with a <U+017F>mile, and <U+017F>aid afterward aloud, we <U+017F>hall heare
the re<U+017F>t of your bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e another time; Meane while, I will goe and take orders to
content tho<U+017F>e of this Towne <U+017F>o, as may invite others to doe as they have done; that
Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him is the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e you can take; for a great King, as you are, <U+017F>hould
force people unto <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, more by <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e, then violence.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t the King was bu<U+017F>ie on his <U+017F>ide, I was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e on mine; for at the <U+017F>ame time
I di<U+017F>patched <hi>Alvian,</hi> which was the name of him whom <hi>Daphnide</hi> gave me for a guide;
and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had a great tru<U+017F>t and confidence in him, and that his fidelity and affection
was already known unto me, I de<U+017F>ired him to contrive it <U+017F>o, that by his prudence I might
<U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>ee that fair Lady; I told him that I would never forget my obligations unto
him, which I would repay any way he would de<U+017F>ire: <U+017F>o he departed with a promi<U+017F>e,
that he would <U+017F>tudy my contentment, and upon every occa<U+017F>ion would te<U+017F>tifie his de<U+017F>ire
of doing me <U+017F>ervice. Thus I left him, and was in <U+017F>uch raptures of Love, as I had no
other thought but of <hi>Daphnide;</hi> I found by experience, that Lovers doe not mea<U+017F>ure
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53527:27"/>
their time, like other men, but according to the impatiency of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>eth
them; for dayes <U+017F>eemed unto me whole months, <U+017F>o long did I thinke them, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
no newes from this faire Lady; my <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t entertainment was my owne thoughts,
which when I could get my <U+017F>elfe out of all company, ran continually upon the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages
of my voyage.</p>
                     <p>The great <hi>Eurick,</hi> having nothing to doe after the rendition of this Towne, would
refre<U+017F>h his Army for <U+017F>ome dayes; for it had been much tyred out in that occa<U+017F>ion, and
dividing them into <U+017F>everall Quarters, he kept no more about him, then were requi<U+017F>ite
for the <U+017F>afety of his per<U+017F>on. And becau<U+017F>e it was his cu<U+017F>tome when he tooke Truce with
<hi>Mars,</hi> to begin warre with <hi>Venus,</hi> and with his <U+017F>port in hunting, he devoted him<U+017F>elfe
unto them two, there being nothing more odious unto his courage, then idlene<U+017F><U+017F>e; and
it was his ordinary Apothegme, that to live and do nothing, was to bury him<U+017F>elfe before
he was dead.</p>
                     <p>My office called me to be continually about his per<U+017F>on, but my affection to him
much more; and therefore I was never from his elbow. The truth is, this new love, or
rather this renewing of my old love to <hi>Daphnide,</hi> had made me <U+017F>o melancholly that I
could hardly <U+017F>peake unto any: Which the King perceiving one day when he was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
whether it was to mocke at my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or whether it plea<U+017F>ed him to heare talke
of her, who tyed my heart and my tongue, I know not; but he called me unto him,
and with a <U+017F>mile, <U+017F>aid; May one not interrupt your thoughts <U+017F>o farre <hi>Alcidon,</hi> as to
tell you, that they are <U+017F>o much taken up with ab<U+017F>ent per<U+017F>ons, that they care not for us
that are pre<U+017F>ent. Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, there is a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of it upon me, which I hope
wil <U+017F>erve for an excu<U+017F>e. For ought I <U+017F>ee <hi>Alcidon,</hi> replyed he, none but I am a lo<U+017F>er in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
Why Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him? Becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, <hi>Daphnide</hi> hath gotten a Servant,
and you, in lieu of a Ma<U+017F>ter, have gotten both a Ma<U+017F>ter and a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e: But I have lo<U+017F>t;
for whereas, I alone did po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e you, now I have a Companion who has a <U+017F>hare with
me, and perhaps a greater then I have. Did I thinke Sir, replyed I pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap><U+017F>ently, that my
affection would any manner of way divert me from that <U+017F>ervice which I owe unto you;
doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e Sir, in lieu of Love, I would chu<U+017F>e Death, and <U+017F>hould thinke my <U+017F>elfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to live, if I did not to my la<U+017F>t breath continue in this de<U+017F>igue. But then, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prejudice to your <U+017F>ervice I may obtaine that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which Love doth promi<U+017F>e me,
and which my heart does <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire, I cannot thinke it any lo<U+017F><U+017F>e to you; for a
good Ma<U+017F>ter, as you are does alwayes de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee his Servants thrive in contentment. I
mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he unto me, and laughed, that this affection, <U+017F>o it do you no harm,
it will not doe me any; but I much feare, that as di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e cannot continue long, but it
mu<U+017F>t needs either increa<U+017F>e or dimini<U+017F>h; <U+017F>o if yours do not quickly dimini<U+017F>h, it will <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e,
that we <U+017F>hall be both lo<U+017F>ers: And therefore you mu<U+017F>t either be diverted from it,
or el<U+017F>e u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome remedies. Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, the care which you are plea<U+017F>ed to have
of me, will guard me from all danger: But to cure or dimini<U+017F>h my affection, is to attempt
a thing which is beyond the reach of all po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility.</p>
                     <p>This, <U+017F>aid the King, is a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trong and violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, did
you but <U+017F>ee her who is the cau<U+017F>e of it, you would <U+017F>ay, all is too little to equall her:
But is it credible, <U+017F>aid he, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o fair, as you <U+017F>peake her? Sir, an<U+017F>wered I,
did I not feare that I my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>hould be the cau<U+017F>e of my owne ruine, I would tell you (and
truly) much more; but I am afraid<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that in <U+017F>o doing I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>harpen the weapon which
will kill me. How doe you meane? <U+017F>aid he unto me, and becau<U+017F>e I did not an<U+017F>wer:
Speak freely <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, tell me what your fear is; and he commanding me two or
three times, at la<U+017F>t I continued; I feare Sir, and not without rea<U+017F>on, le<U+017F>t <hi>Daphnide</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>o infinitely faire, <U+017F>hould have as great an influence upon your <U+017F>oule, as <U+017F>he hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mine; if that <U+017F>hould happen, there is no way for me but death, and a death <U+017F>o de<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
that my mo<U+017F>t mortall enemies would pitty me.</p>
                     <p>I knew by <U+017F>everall circum<U+017F>tances, <U+017F>aid he then unto me, that you were in this doubt,
and I had a mind to put you out of it: No, no, I would not offer <U+017F>uch wrong unto any
of my <U+017F>ervants, much le<U+017F><U+017F>e unto you, upon whom I have conferred <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ignall te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of my particular good will: live happily, and never fear it, for I <U+017F>wear by my
Crowne, that no humane beauty upon Earth can make me commit <U+017F>uch a fault. Sir, <U+017F>aid
I unto him, I mu<U+017F>t humbly pro<U+017F>trate my <U+017F>elfe at your feet, by way of gratitude: for I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teeme
this favour no le<U+017F><U+017F>e than a new life, and am <U+017F>ure that if <U+017F>uch a misfortune had beene,
I had been but a dead man.</p>

Our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon ended, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e the Cha<U+017F>e coming towards us, had not
forced us away; as for me, I was the mo<U+017F>t contented man alive, putting full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance in
his words, and therefore ever <U+017F>ince, when he <U+017F>pake unto me, I told him freely all pa<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
concerning my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Some dayes thus pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed on, and I heard no newes from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian,</hi>
which was no <U+017F>mall trouble unto me: But at the <U+017F>ame time, the Kings affaires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
him to receive <U+017F>ome place which would <U+017F>ubmit into his hands; and therefore he
drew out part of his Army towards that quarter where <hi>Daphnide</hi> dwelt. When the King
told me his re<U+017F>olution, I was ravi<U+017F>hed with joy, and <U+017F>aid unto him; Now <U+017F>ir, I hope you
will grace me <U+017F>o farre, as to <U+017F>ee my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, for we <U+017F>hall pa<U+017F><U+017F>e clo<U+017F>e by her hou<U+017F>e; with
all my heart, an<U+017F>wered he: then we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee whether <U+017F>he be <U+017F>o faire as you <U+017F>ame her
to be; and if I talke with her, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall quickly know whether you will <U+017F>peed in your
hopes.</p>
                     <p>The King <U+017F>ets forward, and to omit all matters which are not pertinent to my <U+017F>tory,
though in them<U+017F>elves worthy of Chronicle; and being within a mile of <hi>Daphnides</hi> hou<U+017F>e,
he told me that he would <U+017F>ee her, and that in rr<U+017F>pect of the good <U+017F>ervice which her Father
had done him, he could doe no le<U+017F><U+017F>e being <U+017F>o near her and her Mother, but <U+017F>ee them. I am
<U+017F>till afraid Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, that this honour which you intend to doe them, is mixed
with Love. What? <U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>miled, you old fits of folly againe? will you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what I have promi<U+017F>ed with an oath; had I onely promi<U+017F>ed, I <U+017F>hould be onely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
in <U+017F>o doing, but having <U+017F>worn, I <U+017F>hould be perfidious: Come, come, ca<U+017F>t away
the<U+017F>e fooli<U+017F>h thoughts, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you are re<U+017F>olved to offend me; and on the contrary, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that I will do all the good offices I can, and as you can expect from the be<U+017F>t of your
freinds.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, I pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>patched a me<U+017F><U+017F>enger unto <hi>Daphnide,</hi> to let her know of the
Kings coming; and when we were in <U+017F>ight of the hou<U+017F>e, I would have gone before, but
he commanded me to <U+017F>tay with him, becau<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he to me, and <U+017F>miled) I <U+017F>hall be more
welcome if I bring you with me, than if I come by my <U+017F>elfe. Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Lady has <U+017F>o much judgement, as rightly to value the honour which you doe
her; but Sir, take heed le<U+017F>t you lo<U+017F>e the title of invincible; for I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, there are
<U+017F>trange Captivaters in that hou<U+017F>e; it is the habitation of the Graces; <hi>Daphnide</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with two <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters, who yield not unto any but her <U+017F>elfe; and had I not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
engaged, there is one <hi>Delia</hi> who doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e had ab<U+017F>olutely captivated me. Is that
<U+017F>he, <U+017F>aid the King, of whom you <U+017F>poke to me before? Yes <U+017F>ir, an<U+017F>werd I, and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e
the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hed beauty that ever I <U+017F>aw, if as I told you before, <U+017F>he had not a <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter.
To her then, <U+017F>aid the King, will I addre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe. By this time we were come <U+017F>o neare
the Ca<U+017F>tle, that the Ladies being upon the bridge, the King lighted from his hor<U+017F>e to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
them; and taking the Mother by the hand, he went into the great Chamber, where
they talked a while; and the King enquired of her and her husbands health, and whether
Wars were not offen<U+017F>ive to her. In the meane time, I talked to the fair <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who
though at all times fair, yet, that day, it might be <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elfe, having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto her natural beauty, <U+017F>o many Graces by her artificial dre<U+017F>s, as I never <U+017F>aw any
<U+017F>o fit to conquer hearts. <hi>Delia</hi> <U+017F>tood next to her, and my eyes and heart being fixed in
contemplation of their beloved object, I <U+017F>tood gazing a long time before I <U+017F>poke. You
went away, <U+017F>aid <hi>Delia,</hi> without a heart, and return without a tongue; if you lo<U+017F>e as much
every voyage, you will become very ill company: <hi>Delia,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto her, you are very
plea<U+017F>ant; but if <U+017F>he who hinders you from being the faire<U+017F>t in the world, doe u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch
Arts, I know not what will become of me. Who doe you <U+017F>peak of? <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide;</hi> of you
Madam, an<U+017F>wered I, who adds <U+017F>o much art unto your Naturall beauty, that no eye can
look, and hope to e<U+017F>cape impri<U+017F>onment. I <U+017F>hould in favour of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he,
believe that this might be, if every one did look upon me with <hi>Alcidons</hi> eyes. But let us
leave this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and tell us which way do you take. I am <U+017F>ure, <U+017F>aid I unto her, that
the way hither, is the way of my felicity, and my way from you, is the way of my hell:
Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide;</hi> I mean, which way does the King go, and whither does your
Army intend to march? I would have an<U+017F>wered her, but the King called me away. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he unto me, come hither, and be a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e; is not the <U+017F>trong Towne of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
reduced into our hands? Yes certainly, <U+017F>ir, <U+017F>aid I unto him; and you mu<U+017F>t look for
other Kingdomes, and indeed other Worlds, to exerci<U+017F>e your Armes in, for there is no
more to Conquer which I know of. They will not believe me, replyed the King; and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53527:28"/>
therefore I pray relate unto this incredulous Lady, how not onely <hi>Arles,</hi> but almo<U+017F>t all
the Province which is called the <hi>Romans,</hi> is in our hands. Oh, <U+017F>ir, <U+017F>aid the good old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
not but that <hi>I</hi> did believe what you did <U+017F>ay; but it is becau<U+017F>e till now, we thought
the Towne of <hi>Arles</hi> impregnable. Nay, nay, replyed the King, <hi>I</hi> will have you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
the whole <U+017F>eries of the <U+017F>tory, to the end that hereafter you may not doubt of what
<hi>I</hi> <U+017F>ay: Upon this, ri<U+017F>ing up, he <U+017F>et me in his place, and went to the place from whence <hi>I</hi>
came; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Delia</hi> when he came, would have retired, he pulled her back, and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
awhile unto them both. <hi>I</hi> could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly heare what they <U+017F>aid, as well becau<U+017F>e it
was but a little too far off, as becau<U+017F>e <hi>I</hi> was engaged to talke unto this old Lady. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
after, when the King took <hi>Daphnide</hi> by the hand, and carried her the Window, <hi>I</hi>
mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, then <hi>I</hi> began to doubt, and my words did <U+017F>o die in my mouth, as if <hi>I</hi> were
<U+017F>oul-le<U+017F><U+017F>e: I could not chu<U+017F>e but ob<U+017F>erve their faces and actions; and what<U+017F>oever I <U+017F>aw, made
me <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that which I feared mo<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o as I wi<U+017F>hed withall my heart, for <U+017F>ome hot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
to call away the King from the place where he was. I cannot tell how long his
Court<U+017F>hip la<U+017F>ted, but I am <U+017F>ure it la<U+017F>ted <U+017F>o long, that I thought every minute a day. At
the la<U+017F>t, the King took his leave, and went on his journey. <hi>Daphnide</hi> <U+017F>eeing me fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
did beckon unto me, as de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>peak with me; whereupon I commanded one
of my men to hide my hor<U+017F>e, to the end I might have <U+017F>ome colour to <U+017F>tay behind; <U+017F>o as
though the King called me twice or thrice, yet <U+017F>tay I did, <U+017F>eeming to be very angry with
my <U+017F>ervants, for the little care they had of my Hor<U+017F>e. The King, and almo<U+017F>t all the Train
departed; and I going into the hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>eeming onely becau<U+017F>e I would not have the Ladies
<U+017F>tay <U+017F>o long in the Sun, I took <hi>Daphnide</hi> a<U+017F>ide: Well Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, what doe
you thinke of the Great <hi>Eurick?</hi> Nay, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e doe you thinke we had?
I cannot tell, replyed I: Then, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I will tell you, and you <U+017F>hall judge which of us
two loves you be<U+017F>t: when he took me to the window, to the end <hi>Della</hi> might not hear,
though at the fir<U+017F>t he <U+017F>tayed her with me out of civility: he <U+017F>aid unto me; I doe not now
wonder, that <hi>Alcidon</hi> <U+017F>hould run <U+017F>uch hazard to <U+017F>ee you, for I prote<U+017F>t you are the faire<U+017F>t

                     <p>At the fir<U+017F>t, this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e made me blu<U+017F>h, e<U+017F>pecially hearing him mention you, and of
a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e which I did not thinke he knew of: yet <U+017F>eeming as if I did not under<U+017F>tand
him, <hi>I</hi> an<U+017F>wered thus: <hi>I</hi> know not <U+017F>ir, why you <U+017F>hould tell me of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> nor what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
he has run; but I am <U+017F>ure, that there is nothing in me worthy of your eye, nor of
the language of <U+017F>o great a King. Why, fair one, <U+017F>aid he unto me, did you thinke <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi>
could leave our Army without my leave, and without telling me whither he went?
The Law of War is very <U+017F>evere and <U+017F>trickt: moreover, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elfe, that he is too
young to enjoy <U+017F>o much good fortune. I am <U+017F>o little ver<U+017F>ed in the way of War, an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, and the age of <hi>Alcidon</hi> does <U+017F>o little concerne me, as I never learned the one, nor
cared for the other. Why, <U+017F>aid he, doe you thinke I know not, how he hath <U+017F>eene you
twice; the fir<U+017F>t time at a Cavaliers hou<U+017F>e, who has the charge of my Artilery; and the
next time, at your <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters, where you kept him in a Clo<U+017F>et: No, no, Fair one, he has told
me all, and <U+017F>o particularly, as you your <U+017F>elf do not know them better: Certainly, <U+017F>aid I, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi>
has a great confidence in you; and in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o, I was con<U+017F>trained to cover my
blu<U+017F>hes with my hand, being a<U+017F>hamed the King <U+017F>hould know all the<U+017F>e particulars. But
he <U+017F>miling; This, <U+017F>aid he, is the common vanity of all young people; they cannot be
<U+017F>ilent, but mu<U+017F>t be blabbing of their own happine<U+017F><U+017F>e; but be not angry I <U+017F>hould know
this, <U+017F>ince loving and honouring you <U+017F>o much as I do, I <U+017F>hall take no notice of it; but
if you will follow my advice, and pre<U+017F>erve your reputation, ca<U+017F>t off this youth, and reject
his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es; for you may be certaine, that he who would tell me the<U+017F>e things, will in
an humour tell them to any other, and perhaps to <U+017F>ome that are not <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creet as I
am.</p>
                     <p>Judge, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to me, into what a condition you have brought me, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
him with the<U+017F>e things, which above all you <U+017F>hould have concealed. How can I
chu<U+017F>e but be extreamly angry with you, when I reflect upon the wrong you have done
me? Madam, <U+017F>aid I unto her, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe in a great fault, but I am
confident you will excu<U+017F>e it, if you will but plea<U+017F>e to remember the manner how we lived
in the dayes of his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>or King <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond,</hi> who being the fir<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of our love;
I thought this King, being as gracious unto me as the other, would al<U+017F>o favour the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli<U+017F>hment
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53527:28"/>
of it: but I perceive their de<U+017F>ignes are farre different; for the one aimed at
my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e in giving me that which he had a mind unto him<U+017F>elfe: and the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to make me mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable by ravi<U+017F>hing from me, her whom he knowes is mine,
and without whom he knowes I value not my life: For I doe fore<U+017F>ee, by the knowledge
which I have of his humour, that he will love you; his de<U+017F>igne I perceive is to put you
out of conceit with me; <U+017F>o as your mind then not being ingaged, he hopes the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily
to win upon you, and bring about his own ends. But Madam, if you doe think him
able to compa<U+017F><U+017F>e his de<U+017F>ires, and that I <U+017F>hall ever <U+017F>ee this change in you, I conjure you
by the memory of great <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond,</hi> who loved us both <U+017F>o well, never to let me <U+017F>ee it,
but to tell me betimes, that my death may anticipate <U+017F>uch a dire accident. <hi>Daphnide</hi>
then <U+017F>miled, and <U+017F>aid, I am very glad to <U+017F>ee you <U+017F>o much perplexed as you are, as well to
prevent you from relap<U+017F>ing into your crime of being <U+017F>o liberall in your tongue, as to
know by your fears which you have of the King and of his good will unto me, that you
doe really love me. But <hi>Alcidon,</hi> I love you too well to let you be long in this perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
Live therefore contentedly, and be confident, that as long as <hi>Alcidon</hi> loves me, <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
will never love any other, and that neither the grandure, nor authority of a King
<U+017F>hall ever be able to alter me in this re<U+017F>olution.</p>
                     <p>We had talked longer, if the King who had already <U+017F>ent twice for me, had not <U+017F>ent
the third time, fearing, as I beleeve, le<U+017F>t <hi>Daphnide</hi> <U+017F>hould impart unto me, what he had
<U+017F>aid unto her: Therefore after I had ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hand of my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and after <U+017F>he
had given me a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, that if the King continued, <U+017F>he would impart all unto me, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and galloped after the King, whom I found gone but a little way; for he <U+017F>tayed
purpo<U+017F>ely to di<U+017F>patch away an expre<U+017F><U+017F>e to colour thereby his <U+017F>taying for me, and to the end,
that if I came not quickly, he might <U+017F>end another me<U+017F><U+017F>enger for me. When I was come
unto him; <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, I <U+017F>ent for you, becau<U+017F>e there is danger in coming after an
army with few men; for I have intelligence that the Enemy is not farre off, and if they
have any de<U+017F>igne of doing any thing, they will watch <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions by their <U+017F>pies. I gave
him mo<U+017F>t humble thankes for the care he had of me, and though I made no <U+017F>hew of it,
yet I knew very well, that when he <U+017F>aid the enemy was not farre off, he <U+017F>aid truly, <U+017F>ince
he him<U+017F>elfe was neer me, and no enemy could be more dangerous nor cruell then him<U+017F>elfe.
Ob<U+017F>erve, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas,</hi> the follies of love; I re<U+017F>ented the injury <U+017F>o deepely, that had I
not feared to incur the danger of being taxed for a perfidious Cavalier, I know not unto
what fury my re<U+017F>entments might have prompted me unto again<U+017F>t him; but upon good
con<U+017F>ideration of the matter, I re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>mother my wrongs, and <U+017F>eeme to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that I knew any thing; con<U+017F>idering, that when the de<U+017F>ires of people are thwarted,
they are mo<U+017F>t violent, and when the de<U+017F>ires of per<U+017F>ons in power are once knowne, they are
prompted to u<U+017F>e violence. But the great con<U+017F>traint in which I lived, did <U+017F>o perplex me
that I fell <U+017F>icke: By this, reverend Father, you may judge how great my affection was,
<U+017F>ince it had power to bring me into <U+017F>uch a condition. The King did not thinke my <U+017F>ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
<U+017F>o great as it was; but it increa<U+017F>ing every day, and his affaires con<U+017F>training him not
to abide long in one place, he left me in the City of <hi>Avignion,</hi> upon the report of the
Phy<U+017F>itians, who told him how great my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e was.</p>
                     <p>Thus I tarried in this Towne <U+017F>o ill, that but for the contentment which I received
from <U+017F>ome Letters which <hi>Daphnide</hi> <U+017F>ent me by <hi>Alvian,</hi> I know not what would have
become of me. However, it was more then eight dayes that I kept my bed, before I
heard any newes from <hi>Daphnide,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he not knowing of my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, but <U+017F>uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
me to be in the Army, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent <hi>Alvian</hi> thither. In the meane time I who thought
that <U+017F>he knew of my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, I pined away with <U+017F>orrow and griefe, having an opinion
that her <U+017F>ilence proceeded from a defect in her affection, and then I blamed the incon<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and ambition of women, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing that the Kings affection to her was certainly the
cau<U+017F>e of it. At la<U+017F>t, my impatiency not being able to indure this incertainty: I <U+017F>ent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her my Servant, who carried my Letters; the fir<U+017F>t time unto her, and in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, I writ the<U+017F>e few words unto her.</p>

the King continued his enterpri<U+017F>e; and I who thought that I had a good occa<U+017F>ion to
laugh at him, did find my <U+017F>elfe in the conclu<U+017F>ion, the party laughed at. Pardon me, Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, I be<U+017F>eech you, if this truth offend you. Well, well, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide,</hi>
and interrupted him, I will not now an<U+017F>wer you, go on with your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as you
plea<U+017F>e. Upon this, <hi>Alcidon</hi> continued.</p>
                     <p>The King having effected his enterpri<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t his enemies, he returned the <U+017F>ame way
he came, purpo<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>ee his new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e: and to the end I <U+017F>hould know nothing of it,
he came the night before his Army, almo<U+017F>t all alone, and lodged in her hou<U+017F>e. He had
made choice of <U+017F>uch to wait upon him, as I knew nothing of it a long time after; but at
la<U+017F>t, I came to know it by an accident, which hereafter I <U+017F>hall tell you. In the meanetime,
the King came to <hi>Avignion,</hi> where he honoured me <U+017F>o far, as to enquire of me: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
I was extreamly vexed at the pur<U+017F>uit which I <U+017F>aw he made of this faire Lady, I could
not perfectly <U+017F>hake off my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e; but being neither well nor ill, I langui<U+017F>hed away <U+017F>uch
a melancholly life, as I became <U+017F>carce knowable: The King hearing of it, <U+017F>ent <U+017F>everall
times to vi<U+017F>it me, and he him<U+017F>elfe conde<U+017F>cended to come and <U+017F>ee me, but <U+017F>poke not a word
of <hi>Daphnide,</hi> nor made any <U+017F>hew of <U+017F>eeing her, or had her <U+017F>o much as in memory. I for
my part, kept not <U+017F>uch a clo<U+017F>e Guard upon my lips, but told him, that it grieved me <U+017F>o
much, that again<U+017F>t his promi<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e me thus, as the very <U+017F>ight of him aggravated
my griefe, and augmented my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>Since the la<U+017F>t time that the King was with <hi>Daphnide,</hi> <U+017F>he writ unto me onely as an
umbrage for her intentions, and to keep me as long as <U+017F>he could from the knowledge of all
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, though <U+017F>he knew they would out at la<U+017F>t: for the Court<U+017F>hip of Great Princes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53527:30"/>
cannot be long concealed. As for the Letters which <U+017F>he received from him, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent them
not unto me, as <U+017F>he was wont to doe, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it were <U+017F>ome out of which no great matter
could be collected, and tho<U+017F>e very rarely. Thus did I fret away my time with <U+017F>uch heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking
thoughts, as when I think upon them, I cannot chu<U+017F>e but wonder they did not
bring me to my Grave. Sometimes in the evening when the weather was fair, and the Sun
in decline of heat, I <U+017F>hould walke upon the bankes of the River <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> towards the hou<U+017F>e
of this fair one, and there all alone contemplate upon my own thoughts, until the Suns
light had left our Hemi<U+017F>phere; and then I <U+017F>hould returne to my own lodging, and <U+017F>pend
the whole night in the <U+017F>ame melancholly imaginations.</p>
                     <p>How often have I taken conjectures of my misfortune for certainties, and then wi<U+017F>hed
my <U+017F>elfe out of this life, as thinking that I lived onely to re<U+017F>ent my own <U+017F>orrowes and her
treachery? How oft have I with di<U+017F>daine, thought my <U+017F>elfe a fond fool for loving <U+017F>uch a
weathercock beauty? how many times have I re<U+017F>olved to break off all tho<U+017F>e perfidious
bonds that tyed me to her <U+017F>ervice? perfidious may I well call them, for all her oathes and
promi<U+017F>es, which together with her beauty, tyed me to her <U+017F>ervice, are all vanity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luders.</p>
                     <p>But alas, how oft have I al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>idered, that not being my <U+017F>elfe, I was not able either
to doe or re<U+017F>olve upon any thing, but according to her will and by as that drew me unto
her? Till now, <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas,</hi> my mi<U+017F>ery was onely dubious, and hanged onely upon <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition:
but now, <U+017F>ee how the whole truth came to be di<U+017F>covered unto me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> was walking, as <hi>I</hi> told you, upon the bankes of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> not with any intention to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
my <U+017F>elfe, but onely to entertaine my mortal thoughts one evening, as I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to my lodging, I <U+017F>aw a young Cavalier, who was one of my friends, who<U+017F>e Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>erved the King in his Court<U+017F>hip of this faire one; and he rid by me, and did not
know me, not imagining that he whom he <U+017F>aw could be alone <U+017F>o late, whom he knew
never u<U+017F>ed to walke <U+017F>o <U+017F>lenderly attended<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but riding on a little further, and knowing and
<U+017F>ervant that waited upon me at a di<U+017F>tance, he asked him what he did in that place: and
my <U+017F>ervant an<U+017F>wering, that he waited there until I had done walking; the Cavalier pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
alighted from his hor<U+017F>e, and having <U+017F>aluted me, be<U+017F>eeched me to pardon him, for
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by and not knowing me. After <U+017F>ome common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which we had together
upon that <U+017F>ubject, I asked him from whence he came, and whither he was going? He
who was altogether ignorant of my love unto this fair one, and knew nothing neither of
the Kings but by his father, he an<U+017F>wered me with all freedom and plainne<U+017F><U+017F>e. I come <U+017F>ir,
<U+017F>aid he, from a place, where you are had in memory, and I have brought you a letter which
will te<U+017F>tifie as much; then putting his hand into his pocket, he took it out, and withall
another, the <U+017F>uper<U+017F>cription whereof I knew; and having a <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, that it was directed
unto the King; al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eeing how free this young Cavalier was in his language, as I tooke
my owne letter, I asked him, for whom the other was: For whom (<U+017F>aid he) why?
it is to the King my Father is faln <U+017F>ick, and he gave it unto me to carry unto the King:
He <U+017F>pake thus unto me, as thinking that I knew of the Kings love, as I did all other the
Kings bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e before. Though this made a deep impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon my heart, yet I <U+017F>miled
at his <U+017F>implicity, and <U+017F>aid unto him: I doe believe, dear friend, that both you and your
Father, are put to very much trouble in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e. Oh Sir, <U+017F>aid he very freely, I <U+017F>wear
unto you, that all the voyages of War which the King has taken has not been <U+017F>o trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome
to us, as this cur<U+017F>ed love hath been, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince the King in his return, went to
<U+017F>ee that faire Lady; and you may imagine this a truth, by the <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e which my Father
hath gotten. My dear friend, replyed I, and embraced him <U+017F>uch as great Princes doe imploy
upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions, are <U+017F>uch whom they be<U+017F>t love; and therefore you are not a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
unto that fair Lady who is the cau<U+017F>e; be<U+017F>ides your own merit, of the Kings love and
favour unto you. Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto me, I cannot tell what may happen; but I am affraid
that this Lady of whom you <U+017F>peake, will <U+017F>o bewitch him, as none can have any <U+017F>hare in
the Kings favour and love but her<U+017F>elf.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e words went <U+017F>o to my heart, as they con<U+017F>trained me to di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>e him <U+017F>ooner then
otherwi<U+017F>e I would: and having no curio<U+017F>ity to know any more, I told him purpo<U+017F>ely to
make him go away, that the King impatiently expected his coming, and that I would
not deprive him of his contentment by <U+017F>taying him any longer.</p>
                     <p>Thus I remained all alone, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e accompanied with <U+017F>o many di<U+017F>mal and mortal
thoughts, as it was above an hour before I would return: but at la<U+017F>t, night con<U+017F>training
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53527:30"/>
me to retire into the Towne: I went unto my lodging with a defigne to depart all alone
the next morning, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>hun all manner of humane Company, as none <U+017F>hould ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me againe. And to begin, I went unto my Chamber by a backe <U+017F>taires, and having
none but my Page with me, I went pre<U+017F>ently to bed, and commanded him to tell all the
Company that expected me, how I was not well, and that I <U+017F>ent him to bid them all
good night. I clo<U+017F>ed not an eye all the night long, and <hi>Aurora</hi> began to blu<U+017F>h before
any mind of <U+017F>leep came upon me: And being in a full re<U+017F>olution of departure a Feaver
<U+017F>eized upon me <U+017F>o violently, as I was con<U+017F>trained to deferre untill my recovery. I had not
yet looked into the Letter which <hi>Daphnide</hi> <U+017F>ent me, having neither <U+017F>o much courage as to
<U+017F>ee what was in it, nor hate enough to ca<U+017F>t it into the fire; but not knowing which of
the<U+017F>e two I <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>olve upon, I held it in my hand, and kept it two dayes before I
brought it to light: At la<U+017F>t, being tran<U+017F>ported with choller one night when I was alone,
I mu<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid I to my <U+017F>elfe, I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ee the treachery of this perfidious woman, and
afterwards <U+017F>o exclude her out of all memory, that nothing may remaine of her in me
but eternall <U+017F>corne. Upon this, rai<U+017F>ing my <U+017F>elfe up in my bed, I opened it, and by the
helpe of a wax Candle which <U+017F>tood by my bed <U+017F>ide, I read what <U+017F>he had written
unto me.</p>
                     <p>But, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas,</hi> unto what purpo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould I repeat here tho<U+017F>e words which were
writ onely with an intention to delude me the longer: And againe, why <U+017F>hould I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
them, <U+017F>ince it is requi<U+017F>ite the Phi<U+017F>itian <U+017F>hould know the wound, before he can apply
right remedy? I will therefore rehear<U+017F>e them, not any thing to my con<U+017F>olation, but onely
to let you <U+017F>ee how I was u<U+017F>ed.</p>

returne pre<U+017F>ently, and not <U+017F>tay for any an<U+017F>wer. The <U+017F>mart of this di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure was <U+017F>uch,
that my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e increa<U+017F>ed very much; of which the great <hi>Eurick</hi> hearing, although he
was a<U+017F>hamed of his filching away this faire one from me; contrary to all his promi<U+017F>es
made unto mee, yet after dinner he conde<U+017F>cended to come and vi<U+017F>it me. I was indeed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<U+017F>icke, and yet my greate<U+017F>t paine was the remembrance of his theft; <U+017F>o as when I was
told the King was coming to <U+017F>ee me I trembled, as if a new fit of an Ague had <U+017F>eized upon

                     <p>He came to my bed <U+017F>ide, where after he had asked me all circum<U+017F>tances, concerning my

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53527:31"/>
his backe upon all the Company, he began to <U+017F>peake in a lower tone, and <U+017F>eeing that
I <U+017F>carcely <U+017F>poke one word, he thought to waken me by talking of <hi>Daphnide,</hi> little think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that I knew how <U+017F>quares went betwixt them. He asked me how that fair one did, and
how long it was <U+017F>ince I heard from her. I an<U+017F>wered him very faintly, that I thought <U+017F>he
was well, and that I never heard from her <U+017F>ince the day that <U+017F>he writ unto him, by
<U+017F>uch a man, and then I named the man who brought me the la<U+017F>t Letter. The King blu<U+017F>ht
and at fir<U+017F>t would have denied that he received any from her; but I be<U+017F>eeched him to
pardon me, for I knew he did, and that the <U+017F>ame man who brought him his Letter,
brought one to me al<U+017F>o. How? <U+017F>aid he then unto me, did <U+017F>he then <U+017F>end one unto you?
Yes Sir, an<U+017F>wered I, and moreover I know of the honour which you did her, in <U+017F>eeing her
at her hou<U+017F>e At this, he was a little confu<U+017F>ed, when he <U+017F>aw I knew what he thought me
ignorant of: and after a long pau<U+017F>e: <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid he unto me, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e
my fault, though to my <U+017F>hame: Tis true, I did <U+017F>ee that Lady of whom you <U+017F>peake
and have received Letters from her: and more then all this, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that I doe

                     <p>I cannot deny but that in this I am a very bad Ma<U+017F>ter, and a wor<U+017F>e friend to treat you
thus after <U+017F>o many promi<U+017F>es to the contrary; but in my confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of this perfidie, I can
<U+017F>ay no more in my owne defence, but that I was deceived my <U+017F>elfe, before I deceived you:
I was per<U+017F>waded, that as I never met with any man living who could overcome me, <U+017F>o
much le<U+017F><U+017F>e that a woman could be able to doe it; and in this opinion I promi<U+017F>ed you
that which <U+017F>ince I find my <U+017F>elfe not able to performe. The confidence which I had in my
owne <U+017F>trength again<U+017F>t men, did drive me into the errour of de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ing all women in general,
and of this Lady in particular; and my <U+017F>orrow is <U+017F>o much the greater, in that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
upon <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to his prejudice; <hi>Alcidon</hi> I <U+017F>ay, whom I loved <U+017F>o well; and it is to
be beleeved, that <U+017F>ince I have been <U+017F>o perfidious unto him, it is a thing ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
for me to doe otherwi<U+017F>e: <hi>Alcidon</hi> my dear friend, I freely make confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the
wrong which in <U+017F>pight of my<U+017F>elfe, I have done you; prote<U+017F>ting that if I could any way
in the world pay that debt unto which I am obliged, I would pre<U+017F>ently doe it, with as
good a heart, as ever I received any favour from heaven.</p>
                     <p>The King uttered the<U+017F>e words in <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>ed manner, and with <U+017F>uch a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as te<U+017F>tified that his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions did not come from his heart: And becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>aw him
<U+017F>tand <U+017F>ilent, I an<U+017F>wered him; Sir, <U+017F>aid I, all that is in the world were created to <U+017F>erve
your greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Alcidon</hi> who is ready to <U+017F>acrifice him<U+017F>elfe upon the Altar of
your contentment: And the Heavens fore<U+017F>eeing it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould be deprived of
<hi>Daphnide</hi> and live, will take away my life, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould be any ob<U+017F>tacle unto you: And
therefore welcome death, <U+017F>ince my life cannot conduce to your contentment. Upon this,
I could not re<U+017F>traine my teares, and the King being moved at them, after a while of <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<U+017F>aid unto me: You cannot <hi>Acidon,</hi> wi<U+017F>h me <U+017F>o ill, as the injury I have done you
does merit, I doe mo<U+017F>t ingeniou<U+017F>ly acknowledge it, and wi<U+017F>h that my blood could reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it; perhaps I <U+017F>hall doe it in time, but for the pre<U+017F>ent there is no thought of it. And
yet for your <U+017F>atisfaction, I am re<U+017F>olved upon any thing you would have me, onely take
heart and recover of your <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e; and beleeve to your contentment, that I will doe all
I can to procure it. After this, the King went out of my Chamber, leaving me in <U+017F>uch a
<U+017F>ad condition as it is incredible any other than my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>hould live under <U+017F>uch a load of

                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcidon</hi> turmoiled with the memory of the<U+017F>e painfull pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and the wrong which
he received both from his Ma<U+017F>ter and his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, he lo<U+017F>t his <U+017F>peech, <U+017F>o as after a while
of <U+017F>ilence, when he offered to <U+017F>peake, he could not; and therefore he was forced for a long
time to be <U+017F>ilent; at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>triving with him<U+017F>elfe he broke out with much adoe, and <U+017F>aid:
You <U+017F>ee Madam, how in obedience to your commands, I make my old wounds bleed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre<U+017F>h,
but when I con<U+017F>ider all is by your command I doe patiently indure all; but if

                     <p>IT is a Proverbe full of rea<U+017F>on, that Parties intere<U+017F>ted or prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with any Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
can never be good judges, becau<U+017F>e their judgements being offended, they can never
performe their perfect Functions, no more than a leg or an arme can which has any

And becau<U+017F>e my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e would be very long if I <U+017F>hould an<U+017F>wer all his particular rovings

you to cen<U+017F>ure of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. And to begin where he left, I will tell you Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that having received the Letter which he <U+017F>ent unto me, unto which I returntd no
an<U+017F>wer, becau<U+017F>e the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger according to his command went pre<U+017F>ently away without
bidding any adieu. I became the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>olate per<U+017F>on in the world, being taxed with a
crime (and with <U+017F>ome colour of rea<U+017F>on) which I could not helpe. I under<U+017F>tood pre<U+017F>ently
after by the Kings Letters, all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which they two had together, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by <hi>Alvian,</hi> whom I <U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>ee how he did, though I did not write,
who told me how ill he was.</p>
                     <p>I di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed long with my <U+017F>elfe what I <U+017F>hould doe in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; for on the one <U+017F>ide,
his affection to me invited me to goe unto him, and tell him how he was mi<U+017F>taken: on
the other <U+017F>ide, I dur<U+017F>t not doe it for fear of being blamed. I was long wavering in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
between the<U+017F>e two con<U+017F>iderations, before the Scale would turne to either <U+017F>ide; but
at la<U+017F>t, the returne of <hi>Alvian</hi> con<U+017F>trained be to goe unto him; for bringing me <U+017F>uch very
bad newes of his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, I ca<U+017F>t off all other con<U+017F>iderations, and re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ee him:
In this determination I <U+017F>ought out for <U+017F>ome excu<U+017F>e to colour my Voyage: And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
after, a very good one pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elfe: For Peace being made, my Brother-in-law
was con<U+017F>trained to goe to <hi>Avignon</hi> about getting of a Cozen of his, who was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oner
in the Towne which was rendred unto the great <hi>Eurick;</hi> and who becau<U+017F>e he
would needs contradict the generall re<U+017F>olution, tho<U+017F>e of the place <U+017F>eized upon him; and
though Peace was afterwards publi<U+017F>hed, yet they would not <U+017F>et him at liberty, lea<U+017F>t if
the warre <U+017F>hould breake out againe, he <U+017F>hould interpri<U+017F>e <U+017F>omething again<U+017F>t them: And
<U+017F>eeing there was <U+017F>ome difficulty about his inlargement, and that the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e by con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
would take up a long time, he would carry his wife with him, and he had a great
de<U+017F>ire of my Company, that I might be <U+017F>een with him, if he was forced to make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F><U+017F>es
unto the King. As <U+017F>oone as the husband made the motion unto me, I con<U+017F>ented
with a condition of my Mothers con<U+017F>ent: The good old woman gave her con<U+017F>ent as
<U+017F>oone as ever <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood the cau<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o as within two dayes after, we <U+017F>et forward, and
as fortune was, our lodging hapned to be directly over again<U+017F>t the lodging of
<hi>Alcidon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e was much <U+017F>poken of, and the King went oft to <U+017F>ee him, for he loved
him very well: but when he was adverti<U+017F>ed of my arrivall, he <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elfe more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irous
of his health than before: For whereas he was wont to <U+017F>ee him but once or twice
in a weeke, <U+017F>ince I came, he went to him every day, and as he went or came backe he
commonly came to my lodging. As for me, the <U+017F>ame day I came I <U+017F>ent to <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and
told him by <hi>Alvian,</hi> that if he was plea<U+017F>ed, I would willingly come and <U+017F>ee him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and
as <U+017F>oone as I received his an<U+017F>wer, I went thither<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I found him very ill, and his Chamber
full of Phi<U+017F>itians and Chyrurgians, <U+017F>o as at that time. our talke was onely of his mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
unto which, he an<U+017F>wered very little, and <U+017F>ighed much. The day after, I tooke my
time <U+017F>o conveniently as I found him almo<U+017F>t all alone; and then after I asked him how he
did, he an<U+017F>wered me with tears in his eyes, and in a feeble and langui<U+017F>hing tone: Why
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53527:32"/>
Madam, <U+017F>aid he, doe you aske me any que<U+017F>tions concerning that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e which you your
<U+017F>elfe have cau<U+017F>ed? you mu<U+017F>t needs know it better then I, or all my Phy<U+017F>icians. <hi>Alcidon,</hi>
an<U+017F>wered I, I doe indeed know part of your di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, which is that of your minde; but I
am altogether ignorant of your corporal di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and it is that which I am mo<U+017F>t affraid
of: for, as for the other, I am confident you will quickly recover. Ah <hi>Daphnide</hi> (<U+017F>aid
he unto me, with a deep <U+017F>igh) I <U+017F>ee by this, that you have mo<U+017F>t care of that part which
lea<U+017F>t does merit it: for, if there be any thing in me which is commendable, it is this <U+017F>oul,
with which I have not onely loved you, but even adored you, with <U+017F>uch a pure and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
affection, as I believe none but your <U+017F>elfe could <U+017F>leight it as you do. This an<U+017F>wer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
I, argues your di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; but have all the care you can for the cure of your body,
and you will finde that the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of your <U+017F>oule is not mortal; at lea<U+017F>t, if there be any
<U+017F>parke of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>a<U+017F>on yet remaining in you. I doe know, an<U+017F>wered he, that the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of my
<U+017F>oule is not mortal; for our Druids tell us, that the <U+017F>oul never dies, but is immortall:
but <U+017F>ince the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of my body, will not cure the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of my <U+017F>oule, I will further it
with my own hands ere long, that I may no longer look upon a per<U+017F>on with the eyes of
love, who has <U+017F>o little in her <U+017F>oule. I perceive, replyed I, that you are deeply wounded,
and your greate<U+017F>t paine is in your opinion: you thinke that the addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of the Great
<hi>Eurick</hi> have <U+017F>uch an influence upon me, that they will extingui<U+017F>h that affection which I
have promi<U+017F>ed unto you. Is not this your di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e <hi>Alcidon?</hi> Doe you not think you have
rea<U+017F>on to complaine again<U+017F>t me, and your fortune, which was to love a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and incon<U+017F>tant? To this he an<U+017F>wered very faintly; Did you as well know how to
cure, as to find out my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hould confe<U+017F><U+017F>e you to be an excellent good Phy<U+017F>itian.
It is as ea<U+017F>ie to cure it, replyed I, as to know it. And to begin; tell me <hi>Alcidon,</hi> how came
you to know, that <hi>I</hi> doe not love you? is it not by tho<U+017F>e an<U+017F>wers which <hi>I</hi> have given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King, and by <U+017F>uffering my <U+017F>elfe to be <U+017F>een and courted by him? But lay a<U+017F>ide your
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion a little, and con<U+017F>ider who King <hi>Eurick</hi> is; who <hi>I</hi> am; and in what times we live
in: You <U+017F>ee <hi>Eurick</hi> is a great Prince, who is able to doe what he will: again<U+017F>t whom,
Cities, Provinces, nay whole Kingdomes are not able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, when he is plea<U+017F>ed to turne
his Arms again<U+017F>t them.</p>
                     <p>Doe you think that love is not as <U+017F>trong a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in him, as his ambition? Can you
believe that I am able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t his force, more then <U+017F>o many millions of per<U+017F>ons? you know
that I am his <U+017F>ubject; that I dwell in the Country which he hath conquered, and in a
time when he thinks all forfeited unto him: Can you thinke me well advi<U+017F>ed, if I <U+017F>hould
di<U+017F>daine and reject him. Doe you think he would <U+017F>uffer me to live quietly in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
if I <U+017F>hould treat him <U+017F>o, e<U+017F>pecially knowing from your own mouth my love unto
you? He would al<U+017F>o accu<U+017F>e You of all the har<U+017F>h treatment that he received from Me. Is it
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible your pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o blind your eyes, as not to <U+017F>ee that the onely remedy is this
which I have u<U+017F>ed? Into what a <U+017F>trange fury would his di<U+017F>dained love turn, if it <U+017F>hould
be<U+017F>leighted? the name of hatred is too low; <U+017F>ome new phra<U+017F>e which <U+017F>ignifies hatred,
mu<U+017F>t be invented, before it can be rightly expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed: hatred, anger, rage, fury, de<U+017F>ire of
revenge, nay tyranny, and cruelty, will not <U+017F>ignifie his Di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t. Then <hi>Alcidon,</hi> con<U+017F>ider,
into what a condition I <U+017F>hould have brought you &amp; my <U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o, if I had taken that cour<U+017F>e;
the lea<U+017F>t you could have expected, is bani<U+017F>hment out of all his Dominions; and the lea<U+017F>t
that I could look for, is a thou<U+017F>and wrongs and affronts, which neither you nor I could
ever have endured without death or revenge: <U+017F>ee into what extremities we <U+017F>hould have
brought our<U+017F>elves, and what contentments we may well hope for by living thus; confe<U+017F>s
my coun<U+017F>el to be the be<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince it <U+017F>ecures us from all danger, and makes a way for us to
live happily together, and with more contentment than ever we did. Alas, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
he, how ea<U+017F>ie a thing it is to know, that all the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons are but meer excu<U+017F>es, for
did you intend as you <U+017F>ay, why did you conceal the matter from me? why did you not
di<U+017F>cover it at the fir<U+017F>t, but made u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>o many <U+017F>hifts and delu<U+017F>ions, as may well be called
treachery, of which I had never known, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I had made the di<U+017F>covery by a meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent?
I <U+017F>hall in this confe<U+017F><U+017F>e the very truth, an<U+017F>wered I, I thought you to be <U+017F>o farre from
this opinion, that I thought it to no purpo<U+017F>e to tell you, but to u<U+017F>e you as children are u<U+017F>ed
who are <U+017F>ick, they <U+017F>weeten the edges of the Cup which holds the bitter medicine, and <U+017F>o
tempt them to take it the more ea<U+017F>ily, and by this meanes pre<U+017F>erve their lives; a<U+017F><U+017F>uring
my <U+017F>elfe, that you would not take it ill when you knew my intention, but would reli<U+017F>h
both the benefit, and the medicine. Alas, <U+017F>aid he unto me, with a deep <U+017F>igh, a medicine
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53527:32"/>
more bitter and difficult to take and endure, than the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is of which you would cure
me. All <U+017F>ick people, an<U+017F>wered I, when Medicines are pre<U+017F>ented unto them, do <U+017F>ay as much
as you, but when they find the good effects, and recover health, then they commend both
the medicine and Phy<U+017F>ician, and reward them with a thankful Fee: and I hope that ere long
you will do the like.</p>
                     <p>He would have an<U+017F>wered, but was prevented by a great company of Cavaliers, who
came to vi<U+017F>it him; and pre<U+017F>ently after, I left him with them, not fully <U+017F>atisfied in his
mind, but <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, that my arguments began to worke with him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and becau<U+017F>e I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired
his recovery above all things, I <U+017F>aw him againe two or three dayes after, and u<U+017F>ed
<U+017F>uch arguments, that he con<U+017F>idering the <U+017F>tate of things, and that there was no remedy, he
con<U+017F>ented I <U+017F>hould continue <U+017F>o with <hi>Eurick:</hi> upon which, I made a promi<U+017F>e unto him,
that as he was the fir<U+017F>t I ever loved, <U+017F>o <U+017F>hould he be the la<U+017F>t, and that I would love him until
I was in my Grave: That the affection which I bare unto <hi>Eurick,</hi> might be called Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of <U+017F>tate, and that which I bare unto him, might be called Love of heart.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e, Reverend Father, were the remedies which <hi>I</hi> u<U+017F>ed to cure this <U+017F>ick man, and
they had <U+017F>uch an operation upon him, that he began to recover, and ri<U+017F>e out of his bed;
<U+017F>o as before <hi>I</hi> went from <hi>Avignion</hi> he was perfectly well, and <U+017F>o contented that <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>mile upon the King, that he him<U+017F>elfe would often come with him, when he came to vi<U+017F>it
me. The truth is, <hi>I</hi> was put to u<U+017F>e all my art in carrying my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o <U+017F>wimingly, as to
per<U+017F>wade the King that <hi>I</hi> was quite off the hinges with <hi>Alcidon;</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> had much
a doe to per<U+017F>wade him that he had no de<U+017F>igne upon me; for the King knowing what good
will had been betwixt us, he could not believe that he could out of re<U+017F>pect unto him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui<U+017F>h
his flames unto me: Al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>idering, that <hi>Alcidon</hi> was young and han<U+017F>ome,
and at a right age for love, he thought him <U+017F>o fit a <U+017F>ubject for my love, as he could not
thinke I could quit <hi>Alcidon</hi> for him. Thus did he live long in jealous <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition; but the
di<U+017F>creet carriage of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and my coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e towards him, did make him lo<U+017F>e that
opinion; and therefore thinking him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ole po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or of my affection, he openly <U+017F>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his love unto me; <U+017F>o as after my brother in law by my mediation had obtained his
de<U+017F>ires, he <U+017F>ent for my Father and Mother to come unto him, purpo<U+017F>ely as an excu<U+017F>e for
his de<U+017F>ires of having me near him. Although they were both very old, yet ambition
which alwaies takes more root in the <U+017F>oules of old people, then in young, did in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his commands, move them to leave their homes in hopes of preferment unto grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
favours.</p>
                     <p>Now are both become Courtiers, and the King did not deceive their hopes, for he
loaded them with wealth and honours, which yet they did not long enjoy; for whether it
was that their age was arrived at that term, beyond which none can pa<U+017F><U+017F>e: or whether it
was that the Turmoiles and noi<U+017F>e of the Court did abridge their lives; yet <U+017F>o it was, that
they both dyed pre<U+017F>ently after, as if they came to the Court onely to leave me in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, for otherwi<U+017F>e, I dur<U+017F>t not have come: but being there, I <U+017F>tayed there under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e
of taking order about <U+017F>ome dome<U+017F>tique bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e which was left upon me, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
when the Kings affection to me was publi<U+017F>hed in hopes to be his wife, as he him<U+017F>elf
divulged.</p>
                     <p>During all this time, few dayes pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed without giving <hi>Alcidon</hi> an opportunity of <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me in private, and in which I did not <U+017F>pend two hours at the lea<U+017F>t with him, which
alwaies <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>hort unto me when we parted: He knowes very well that all this is true,
and that many times in te<U+017F>timony of my good affection to him, I have put both him and
my <U+017F>elfe in very great danger of life and honour. The truth is, I mu<U+017F>t needs commend
both him and his di<U+017F>cretion in this, that what opportunities <U+017F>oever I gave him, and what
favours <U+017F>oever I <U+017F>hewed unto him, he never offered to go beyond the limits of hone<U+017F>ty:
and though I believe, he thought that I would not <U+017F>uffer him, yet I am much obliged
unto him, in that he never gave me any cau<U+017F>e to repent of my kindne<U+017F>s to him.</p>
                     <p>Living thus in the flow of contentment, though I was in continuall feare le<U+017F>t the
King <U+017F>hould come to know of this good will: and le<U+017F>t that <U+017F>hould give him occa<U+017F>ion to
change, as he had already done to the di<U+017F>advantage of others; I ob<U+017F>erved that there was
many great Ladies, who to enjoy the favour and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of this Prince, whether it was
out of a de<U+017F>ire of the Glory to command him, whom <U+017F>o many millions obeyed; or out
of a <U+017F>piring hopes to obtain a Crown, I cannot tell; but they were very a<U+017F><U+017F>iduous in
<U+017F>prucing them<U+017F>elves up in hopes to be plea<U+017F>ing in the Kings eye. Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, I ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53527:33"/>
two; the one was called <hi>Clarinta,</hi> and the other <hi>Adelonda:</hi> As for <hi>Clarinta,</hi> I
mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I never <U+017F>aw a fairer, nor more meritorious of love, having all the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
qualities that are de<U+017F>irable. In the fir<U+017F>t place, Envy it <U+017F>elfe could not find the lea<U+017F>t tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of a defect in her face; <U+017F>he had a hand, no eye ere <U+017F>aw a fairer nor better proportioned;
her <U+017F>tature was tall, <U+017F>traight and <U+017F>lender, and the Maje<U+017F>ty of her mind was <U+017F>uch, as if <U+017F>he
were borne purpo<U+017F>ely to weare a Crowne, as many of her Ance<U+017F>tors formerly had done:
And to make her Charmes the more inevitable, the Univer<U+017F>e had not a finer wit, the
rayes of which <U+017F>hined in all her actions: but e<U+017F>pecially her <U+017F>peech was <U+017F>o infinitely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
that not to be taken with her, there was no other remedy, but not to <U+017F>ee and heare
her. To be briefe; I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that were I a man, I had devoted my <U+017F>elfe her adorer,
what treatment <U+017F>oever had I found; and woman as I was, I was never <U+017F>atisfied but when I
<U+017F>aw her, and was with her, although <U+017F>o many perfections and merits gave me <U+017F>ufficient
cau<U+017F>e to hate her, becau<U+017F>e of the de<U+017F>igne which I had, and the preten<U+017F>ion which
I know <U+017F>he had.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Adelonda,</hi> truth is, <U+017F>he was faire, but not comparable to <hi>Clarinta;</hi> neither
in beauty nor merit; and moreover, being married, <U+017F>he could not have the a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
preten<U+017F>ions of the other <U+017F>o as though I was not troubled much to <U+017F>ee <hi>Eurick</hi>
carra<U+017F><U+017F>e her, yet the other gave great gu<U+017F>ts of <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition; and therefore I re<U+017F>olved to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the mind of the King fir<U+017F>t from her, and afterwards at more lei<U+017F>ure from <hi>Adelonda;</hi> e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when I <U+017F>aw that he went <U+017F>ometimes unto her. And though at the fir<U+017F>t he feigned that
he did vi<U+017F>it her, not out of love, but only honour; yet afterwards his vi<U+017F>its were ofter
than u<U+017F>uall, and he hid them from me, as much as he could. I quickly ob<U+017F>erved this my
<U+017F>elfe be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>pies which I had continually about the Prince, did pre<U+017F>ently adverti<U+017F>e
me of it. After I had well con<U+017F>ulted with my <U+017F>elfe upon the be<U+017F>t remedy again<U+017F>t this <U+017F>torm;
at la<U+017F>t, I bethought me of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> thinking that if he would <U+017F>econd me in it, my de<U+017F>igne
might happily pro<U+017F>per. And becau<U+017F>e the matter required pre<U+017F>ent expedition, the fir<U+017F>t time
I had an opportunity of talking with him alone, I u<U+017F>ed this language.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcidon,</hi> I am unre<U+017F>olved whether or no I <U+017F>hould impart a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e unto you, which
troubles me more than I am able to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e, fearing lea<U+017F>t the affection which you beare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, <U+017F>hould make you take my words otherwi<U+017F>e then I de<U+017F>ire: and yet if you doe but
con<U+017F>ider how I have lived with you for the time pa<U+017F>t, and what evident te<U+017F>timonies I have
given you of my good will, I am confident you will thinke that it is onely the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity
of our affaires which con<U+017F>traines me to de<U+017F>ire a thing of you, which I have hitherto delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
You know, how as my fortune is, all that looke upon me, are enviers of my happines;
<U+017F>o as I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tand upon my guard again<U+017F>t all per<U+017F>ons who would if they could <U+017F>tep into my
roome. The affection which you have promi<U+017F>ed unto me, and that which I bear unto
you, does <U+017F>trongly invite you to have an e<U+017F>peciall care of me, but more of your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation:
For though none knowes of the great league that is betwixt us; yet few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
but know that you have beene ever well affected to me. Now Maxims of <U+017F>tate doe
<U+017F>ay, that the fortune of the head ought to be communicated to the Members; <U+017F>o as your
ruine is mo<U+017F>t evident if mine befall me. I lay the<U+017F>e in<U+017F>tances before your eyes, to the end
you may not think that <U+017F>trange which I am con<U+017F>trained to propound for our pre<U+017F>ervation.
You <U+017F>ee how <hi>Clarinta,</hi> whether relying upon the grandure of her parents, or building her
de<U+017F>igne upon the foundation of her beauty, I cannot tell, but you <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>he endeavours to
get the good will of <hi>Eurick,</hi> and which is wor<U+017F>e, her labour, is not lo<U+017F>t, for methinks
that Prince begins to thinke her more amiable than I wi<U+017F>h he did; you know how flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and alterable his mind is, and how hitherto none could make him fix.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Clarinta</hi> <U+017F>hould compa<U+017F><U+017F>e her de<U+017F>igne, con<U+017F>ider how <U+017F>he would bani<U+017F>h us from Court,
lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>hould fall into like confu<U+017F>ion, wherein <U+017F>he has brought us. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
things proceed any further we mu<U+017F>t by way of prevention u<U+017F>e all the arts we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
for a <U+017F>helter again<U+017F>t this <U+017F>torm. To thinke of u<U+017F>ing violence, and to force the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<U+017F>pirit of this Prince, would <U+017F>hew ignorance in tho<U+017F>e effects which love u<U+017F>eth at the
beginning to produce, for nothing makes it greater than oppo<U+017F>ition, like unto a coale
which the wind makes blaze by blowing upon it. To thinke that di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation will
mend the matter, and in <U+017F>eeming not to know it, that time may produce <U+017F>ome good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
is very bad, and dangerous coun<U+017F>ell: For although Love which findes no oppo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may by little and little lo<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elfe, and become nothing, yet as this ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>tands, the
danger will be inevitable; for love does never le<U+017F><U+017F>en till after fruition: <hi>Clarinta</hi> cannot
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53527:33"/>
be enjoyed till after the marriage; and after marriage though <hi>Eurick</hi> <U+017F>hould alter his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
yet notwith<U+017F>tanding, <U+017F>he would be Queen of the Vi<U+017F>igots, and we by con<U+017F>equence
<U+017F>ubject unto her will, and liable to all her violences. So that upon <U+017F>erious con<U+017F>ideration,
I can finde no better remedy again<U+017F>t this menacing danger, than this which I <U+017F>hall propo<U+017F>e
unto you, which once more I conjure you to take in a right <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and not upon any other
<U+017F>urmi<U+017F>es than as I intend it. You cannot be ignorant how liberall the heavens has beene
unto you in the gifts of Nature, and in accompli<U+017F>hing you every way above other men:
you have had <U+017F>ufficient proofes of it in all your attempts: I make no doubt but if you
would ca<U+017F>t your flaming eye a little upon <hi>Clarinta</hi> <U+017F>he would pre<U+017F>ently melt at the charms
of it, and unle<U+017F><U+017F>e her heart be made of <U+017F>tone, <U+017F>he cannot avoid the amiable glances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
If you would put this my reque<U+017F>t in execution, mo<U+017F>t certainly <U+017F>he would love you,
and pre<U+017F>ently reject <hi>Eurick</hi> and all his ambition; <U+017F>he would wholly devote her <U+017F>elfe unto
you, or el<U+017F>e <hi>Eurick</hi> <U+017F>eeing his addre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and her entertainment of it, he will di<U+017F>daine her
and retire: Thus <U+017F>hall we avoid a misfortune which does much threaten us; if you can
tell me any better expedient, I be<U+017F>eech you propo<U+017F>e it, that we may make choice of the
be<U+017F>t: I have long deferred the making of this over-ture, fearing lea<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould have an
opinion, that I propo<U+017F>ed it as a way to rid my <U+017F>elfe of you, though my intention onely
is, that we may live together for the future in more contentment and <U+017F>afety.</p>
                     <p>This was the language I u<U+017F>ed unto <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>o plainly demon<U+017F>trating my intention
unto him, as I could not imagine that he <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>contented at it, or <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that I had
any other aime then what I told him: yet for all my a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of the contrary, and mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
all my rea<U+017F>ons and arguments, he was per<U+017F>waded that my de<U+017F>igne in this motion was,
to <U+017F>et him further from me, and then to comply more freely with great <hi>Eurick.</hi> After a
long mu<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ilence, and fixing his eyes upon the ground, he looked up, and with a <U+017F>mile
which <U+017F>poke his di<U+017F>content, he an<U+017F>wered me; I wi<U+017F>h, Madam, that I could <U+017F>erve you in
this according as you de<U+017F>ire: and indeed I will, for your de<U+017F>ire is to me a mo<U+017F>t full
command: but my heart tells me, that a great misfortune will take original from this
command; yet obey it I will, not out of any hopes I have in tho<U+017F>e favours which you <U+017F>ay
the heavens have <U+017F>o liberally indowed me withal, but onely to let you <U+017F>ee that I will obey
you in all things as long as I live. Oh Heavens! cannot the King be contented in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F><U+017F>e
of your love, but he mu<U+017F>t needes make me entirely mi<U+017F>erable? Oh <hi>Alcidon,</hi> ha<U+017F>t
thou a heart that can <U+017F>upport the<U+017F>e injuries of fortune? But why <U+017F>hould I not endure them,
<U+017F>ince the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi> commands it <U+017F>o: then turning towards me with abundance of
reverence, Yes, yes, Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto me, I will doe as you command me, though it
co<U+017F>t me a life, and all manner of contentment.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, he would have gone away, but I held him by the arme, and after a <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
urging of my Arguments, and adding the be<U+017F>t motives I had, I de<U+017F>ired him, that
though our ruines would be inevitable if not prevented; yet if it went <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t
his minde, that he would not attempt it, for no misfortune what<U+017F>oever would be more
grievous unto me then his di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure: but <U+017F>till if he would allow of rea<U+017F>on, he would
plainly <U+017F>ee that he was erronious, in having any <U+017F>uch opinions, and that he did exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
offend me in entertaining them. Madam, <U+017F>aid he, If I doe offend you in it, <hi>I</hi> will
pre<U+017F>ently doe my penance in obeying your command; and <U+017F>o as <hi>I</hi> am confident you will
pitty me for it, but I pray heaven your pitty come not too late: yet <hi>I</hi> am <U+017F>o entirely <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ive
unto what<U+017F>oever is your will, as I prote<U+017F>t obedience unto what<U+017F>oever you <U+017F>hall
command; and doe not believe that <hi>I</hi> will faile in it, further then my power fails me:
and though you doe <U+017F>ee me make a little doe at your command, yet <hi>I</hi> be<U+017F>eech you thinke
that it proceeds from no other cau<U+017F>e, then from my abundance of affection, which cannot
endure to heare of the lea<U+017F>t thought of any <U+017F>eparation from you; or that <hi>I</hi> am able to
make any addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of love unto any whom<U+017F>oever but your <U+017F>elfe, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it be under a gui<U+017F>e
of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, and that too with in<U+017F>ufferable paine unto me. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>I</hi> then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, <hi>I</hi> am not now to begin the knowledge of your affection to me, nor of your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
to have my reciprocall love: but <hi>I</hi> pray you believe, that unle<U+017F><U+017F>e death doe very
<U+017F>uddenly <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e me, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hall in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort come out of your debt, and pay my mo<U+017F>t due

                     <head>The Hi<U+017F>tory of the Artifice of Alcires.</head>
                     <p>IT is ea<U+017F>ie to be imagined, that <hi>Clarinta</hi> being <U+017F>uch a captivating beauty, and brought
up in a Court full of generous young Gallants, was not long without many <U+017F>ervants:
Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, there was two who under an umbrage of Con<U+017F>anguinity, had in<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
them<U+017F>elves highly into her favour: The one was called <hi>Amintor,</hi> and the other
<hi>Alcires,</hi> both of them indeed very valiant and amiable Cavaliers. And who, if <hi>I</hi> be not
mi<U+017F>taken, did imbarque them<U+017F>elves at fir<U+017F>t into the affection of this beauty, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of friend<U+017F>hip; a <U+017F>ubtilty very ordinary and often u<U+017F>ed by love, the better to <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e
tho<U+017F>e who are of harder tempers to give it entertainment, Be<U+017F>ides the kindred which was
between the<U+017F>e two Gallants, their long education together, the conformity of exerci<U+017F>es
unto which they addicted them<U+017F>elves, and their concurrency in age did unite them in a
<U+017F>trong league of friend<U+017F>hip, and adopted them brothers in matter of Armes, and to <U+017F>weare
amity and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of each other: But love which never admits of any companion, did
make a fraction in this league of friend<U+017F>hip, as hereafter I <U+017F>hall relate unto you. Fire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <U+017F>o hid, but <U+017F>ome <U+017F>moak will appeare, but I believe it is a matter more hard to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
love long, e<U+017F>pecially from tho<U+017F>e who have any intere<U+017F>t in it. And therefore <hi>Alcires</hi>
finding that <hi>Amintor</hi> did thrive in his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es better then him<U+017F>elfe, and <U+017F>eeing all ju<U+017F>t
wayes would not avail him, he re<U+017F>olved to have recour<U+017F>e unto <U+017F>ubtilty, thinking that, <U+017F>o
he could overcome, all wayes are allowable in Love.</p>
                     <p>It is u<U+017F>uall among<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons of any quality, to make choice of one among<U+017F>t their <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
whom they make a confident, and tru<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a one more then any other: <hi>Clarinta</hi>
made choice of one among<U+017F>t her maids, whom <U+017F>he loved very well, and tru<U+017F>ted with her
mo<U+017F>t intimate <U+017F>ecrets. <hi>Alcires,</hi> who knew what prevalence <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ervants u<U+017F>e to have with
their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, had long before hand courted the good will of this wench; and being a
brave Gallant, and very liberal, he got him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o farre in her favour, as he could mould
her into a model: <U+017F>o as when <hi>Amintor</hi> and he met together at the faire <hi>Clarinta's,</hi> he
would alwaies yield place unto him, and entertaine this wench who <U+017F>tood a di<U+017F>tance from
them: And when he <U+017F>aw <hi>Amintor</hi> look upon him, he would alwaies have <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret to
whi<U+017F>per in her eare and <U+017F>mile, doing all he could to make <hi>Amintor</hi> enter into <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amintor</hi> ob<U+017F>erving this, as the nature of lovers is, he pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected that this
familiarity betwixt them proceeded from <U+017F>ome greater cau<U+017F>e then from that wench, and
perhaps from <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>ign which <hi>Alcires</hi> had upon the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e. <hi>Amintor</hi> being a man of
a free open heart, and one that could not long <U+017F>mother his thoughts from a friend, one
day meeting with a fit opportunity, he <U+017F>aid thus unto him: Good <hi>Alcires,</hi> what bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
of importance could you have with <hi>Clarinta's</hi> maid, which made you <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>t with
her as you <U+017F>eemed? <hi>Alcires</hi> <U+017F>eeing his plot began to take, did at fir<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer him onely
with a <U+017F>mile<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and afterwards, would you have me tell you? <U+017F>aid he, you doe <U+017F>o wholly
take up the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e when you are with her, as I being all alone, am forced to take up
with what you leave me, the maid: But heretofore, <U+017F>aid <hi>Amintor,</hi> you were not wont
to doe thus, and I am no more a taker up of the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, then I was wont to be; what
new mood has of late po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed you? <hi>Alcires</hi> pau<U+017F>ed a while before he an<U+017F>wered, and
then looked upon him with a <U+017F>ubtile <U+017F>mile; at which <hi>Amintor</hi> was more troubled then
before, and <U+017F>eeing that he <U+017F>poke not a word; Why, <U+017F>aid he, doe you not give me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer:
have I any intere<U+017F>t in your familiarity with her? if I have, I pray let me know
it, that I may <U+017F>hare in your mirth. <hi>Alcires</hi> then, <U+017F>etting a more <U+017F>erious face upon the
matter: <hi>Amintor,</hi> <U+017F>aid he unto him, Although there was no ligaments of Con<U+017F>angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
us, yet as I am your friend, you may ea<U+017F>ily believe, that I will impart any thing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53527:34"/>
unto you; and the very truth is, I had long <U+017F>ince acquainted you with what you de<U+017F>ire
to know at this time, had I not feared your di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t of it; and this con<U+017F>ideration will <U+017F>till
<U+017F>top my mouth, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me of the contrary. I will not give you that a<U+017F><U+017F>urance,
<U+017F>aid he, if you tell it with an intention of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing me; but if you tell it with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
that I may prevent any inconveniency, I <U+017F>hall think it a very great obligation. If
you will promi<U+017F>e me, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcires,</hi> to u<U+017F>e it with di<U+017F>cretion, and to take well the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>ement
which I <U+017F>hall give you, onely with intention to bring you forth of a great error,
I am very ready to tell it you, as your kin<U+017F>man, and as your friend: but otherwi<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hall
not; for unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you make good u<U+017F>e of it, it may doe you much hurt. Then <hi>Amintor</hi>
making that promi<U+017F>e unto him, <hi>Alcires</hi> went thus on: Know <hi>Amintor,</hi> that after a long
Court<U+017F>hip of the faire <hi>Clarinta,</hi> I pro<U+017F>pered <U+017F>o well, that <U+017F>he is intirely mine, aad I have
enjoyed her. Oh Heavens! <U+017F>aid <hi>Amintor,</hi> doe you know what you <U+017F>ay? have you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<hi>Clarinta?</hi> Yes, yes, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcires,</hi> I have enjoyed her, and therefore <U+017F>et your heart
at re<U+017F>t; for <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o much mine, as very few nights pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, but I am with her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you <U+017F>ee I <U+017F>hun her company as much as I can, purpo<U+017F>ely to deceive inqui<U+017F>itive eyes,
as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired me. Oh ye Gods, <U+017F>aid <hi>Amintor,</hi> and lifted up his hands; Oh heavens!
will you not puni<U+017F>h her? I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcires,</hi> that I had a longing de<U+017F>ire to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, becau<U+017F>e I was extreamly <U+017F>orry to <U+017F>ee you <U+017F>o deceived: but as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I much feared that it would vex and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you. <hi>Amintor</hi> upon this folded his
Arms, and <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ilent a long time; at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>aid thus, I <U+017F>hould be extreamly angry with
you <hi>Alcires,</hi> for ravi<U+017F>hing <hi>Clarinta</hi> from me, did I not know that when we both cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Clarinta,</hi> we had no de<U+017F>igne of deceiving one another: for as tho<U+017F>e who run for a
pri<U+017F>e, though many run, yet onely one can win it: <U+017F>o I have no rea<U+017F>on to be angry with
you for winning <hi>Clarinta</hi> from me; but rather, I have rea<U+017F>on to thanke you for telling me,
that I may run on no longer in an error: only one thing wants, which would <U+017F>um up
my obligation, and which I conjure you unto; which is, that you will <U+017F>atisfie my eyes in
the truth of this, as well as you have done my eares. I <U+017F>hall give you as good <U+017F>atisfaction
as I can, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alcires,</hi> but I am afraid it will onely fe<U+017F>ter your wound the more, and
be a greater di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure unto you. No, no, replyed <hi>Amintor,</hi> it cannot more di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me,
but will rather encourage my re<U+017F>olution to doe as I ought: <hi>Alcires</hi> <U+017F>eemed to be a little
puzled at this que<U+017F>tion, but he fore<U+017F>aw it, and therefore prepared him<U+017F>elfe for it from the
fir<U+017F>t: Truly <hi>Amintor,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, I know not well how to <U+017F>atisfie the nice curio<U+017F>ity
of your eye; for I have a good de<U+017F>ire to give full contentment, yet I am afraid it will be
ab<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of difficulty to get you into her Chamber, becau<U+017F>e it is not every night I go
unto her, but onely when the opportunity falls han<U+017F>omly out for it, which <U+017F>he cannot let
me know of, until every one be in bed: be<U+017F>ides, I know how to get in, but you will be
<U+017F>een. Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Amintor,</hi> I de<U+017F>ire not to go <U+017F>o farre, I had the <U+017F>ame con<U+017F>ideration with
my <U+017F>elfe; It will <U+017F>atisfie me, if I can but be with you, and <U+017F>ee when your <U+017F>elf go into her
Chamber. If that be enough, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alcires</hi> pre<U+017F>ently, you <U+017F>hall be fully <U+017F>atisfied, and
perhaps this very night if you <U+017F>tay in my Chamber: then <hi>Amintor</hi> promi<U+017F>ing he would,
they parted in this re<U+017F>olution.</p>
                     <p>See, <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas,</hi> unto what impo<U+017F>tures we women are <U+017F>ubject unto, by the example of
this wi<U+017F>e and faire Lady, who though <U+017F>he was clearly innocent, yet by the calumny of
<hi>Alcires,</hi> was deemed as culpable by <hi>Amintor.</hi> He went and waited with a longing impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency,
untill the crafty <hi>Alcires</hi> came and called him: <hi>Alcires</hi> in the interim hoping to
compleat his plot, which he had thought was well begun, and having long before re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon this way; the time being come when every one went to bed, he came to <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
and told him he would conduct him to the promi<U+017F>ed place. The King who tooke
great delight in bring among<U+017F>t Ladies, had lodged <hi>Clarinta, Adelonda,</hi> and me, in his
Palace, pretending it as a great honour unto us: <hi>Clarintas</hi> quarter was a ground Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
near the Court, and had onely three or four <U+017F>teps unto it: from oft the halfe part of
the<U+017F>e little <U+017F>taires, one might go into her Chamber <U+017F>everall wayes; through one doore, one
came into a great Dining room, and a drawing room, out of which was a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through
a little dark Gallery, which conducted into her Clo<U+017F>et by a back door; and here it was
where <hi>Clarinta</hi> commonly lay; and if one would go further without going into her Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>et,
they needed onely to open a door clo<U+017F>e by, through which they came into a great
Chamber that conducted out of the Palace, by a Gate very <U+017F>eldom frequented.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcires</hi> having long before hand ob<U+017F>erved the<U+017F>e things, he conducted <hi>Amintor</hi> into
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53527:35"/>
his little dark Gallery, where <U+017F>taying without any light when all were in bed, he <U+017F>aid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o
him; you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee <hi>Amintor,</hi> that as <U+017F>oon as I knock at the Clo<U+017F>et door, it will be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto me but <hi>I</hi> be<U+017F>eech you according to your promi<U+017F>e, return as <U+017F>oon as ever you <U+017F>ee
me entred in: then leaving him <U+017F>ome five or <U+017F>ix paces from the door, he <U+017F>eemed to goe
unto it, but went unto the other which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed into the great Chamber, and which being
<U+017F>o neare <hi>Clarintas</hi> Clo<U+017F>et, <hi>Amintor</hi> could not <U+017F>ee the great difference; then after <hi>Alcires</hi>
had <U+017F>tayed a little while, he returned unto <hi>Amintor,</hi> and whi<U+017F>pering him in his eare, told
him that they were come a little to late, for all were a<U+017F>leep, but yet he heard them ri<U+017F>ing:
but <hi>I</hi> be<U+017F>eech you o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ce more, <U+017F>aid he, that when <hi>I</hi> am entred, you may goe away as <U+017F>oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
us you can, and in the mean time <U+017F>tand a little further off le<U+017F>t when the door opens and
a Candle come, you <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een. <hi>Amintor</hi> did <U+017F>o, little dreaming of his <U+017F>ubtilty, which
was onely to get him further off the Clo<U+017F>et door, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee the difference of the
Doores: <hi>Alcires</hi> then going as gently as he could unto this door, he opened that which
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed into the great Chamber, and pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>hut it after him; for the <U+017F>pring lock was
made after <U+017F>uch a fa<U+017F>hion, as it would <U+017F>hut of it <U+017F>elfe, and <hi>Alcires</hi> having ob<U+017F>erving it, he
came a little before, and had left it half open. <hi>Amintor</hi> hearing it open, and <U+017F>hut pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againe, did verily believe that it was <hi>Clarinta's</hi> Clo<U+017F>et doore; and probably any other,
be<U+017F>ides him, might have been deceived, the doores being <U+017F>o neare each other, and the
place <U+017F>o darke<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but for better a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, he went and laid his eare to the doore, and
hearkned if he could heare any talke, or any noi<U+017F>e; but whether it was that the
noi<U+017F>e which <hi>Alcires</hi> made, had wakned <U+017F>ome in <hi>Clarinta'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> Chamber, or whether it was
his owne imagination which made him thinke <U+017F>o; yet <U+017F>o it was, that he had an opinion
he heard a noi<U+017F>e, which tran<U+017F>ported him into <U+017F>uch a fury, as he was ready to breake the
doore open with his foot; but thinking upon the promi<U+017F>e he had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto <hi>Alcires,</hi> and
the kindred between them: al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>idering into what a confu<U+017F>ion he <U+017F>hould put all the
hou<U+017F>e into, he had <U+017F>o much power over him<U+017F>elf as to forbeare, and go away, but <U+017F>o vexed
as he could not re<U+017F>t all the night. On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Alcires</hi> having play'd his part <U+017F>o
well thus far, and fearing le<U+017F>t <hi>Amintor</hi> <U+017F>hould look for him at his Chamber, he would
not go unto it, nor unto any other place where any one might <U+017F>ay the next day that they
<U+017F>aw him, and there pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed all the night away in a grotto of the Garden, whereof he had
got the key: judge you into what a perplexity he put <hi>Amintor,</hi> and how prudently wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
a Lover ought to be in avoiding the artifices of a Rivall. The di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
was <U+017F>uch, as not being willing to declare it unto any, he was con<U+017F>trained to keepe
his bed, and murmur away the time again<U+017F>t a malady, without looking for any remedy;
of which <hi>Clarinta</hi> being adverti<U+017F>ed by common reports, and being ignorant of his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e,
her love to him forced her unto a vi<U+017F>it; and <U+017F>he found him <U+017F>o full of <U+017F>orrowes, that
he could hardly look upon her, which <U+017F>he attributed unto the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his malady:
but going another time to vi<U+017F>it him, and <U+017F>till finding him more melancholly and cold
then at the fir<U+017F>t time, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>ay thus unto him; Is your <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
<U+017F>o extream, that it does not onely make a change in your face, but in your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
al<U+017F>o, which is <U+017F>o much different from what it was wont to be, that indeed you are
not knowable? Ah <hi>Clarinta,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he and <U+017F>ighed, how happy had it been for me, if
this alteration had come <U+017F>ooner? <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at this an<U+017F>wer; and when <U+017F>he would
have continued di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, his Phy<U+017F>itians came unto him, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not make any
further replies; but after a little longer <U+017F>tay, <U+017F>he went away, the wor<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfied per<U+017F>on in
the world: in the meane time, <hi>Alcires</hi> to lo<U+017F>e no time in the <U+017F>econding <U+017F>o good a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and to comply with all occa<U+017F>ions that pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves, he grew more kinde
and familiar with <hi>Amintor</hi> then before, and kept him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tantly near him, as it
was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for any to <U+017F>peak with him, and he not heare. For knowing very well
that his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e proceeded from de<U+017F>paire principally, he was loath any <U+017F>hould undeceive
him, or let him know the truth. But becau<U+017F>e he had not yet accompli<U+017F>hed his chiefe
worke, but thought it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that as he had deceived <hi>Amintor,</hi> <U+017F>o to deceive <hi>Clarinta</hi>
al<U+017F>o, purpo<U+017F>ely to make her fly from him, as he fled from her: one day therefore when
he was with his companion alone in his Chamber, he made a <U+017F>hew as if he would write
<U+017F>omething which was of <U+017F>ome importance; but as if his fancy was not plea<U+017F>ed with
what he writ, he raced out <U+017F>ometimes a word, and <U+017F>ometimes a whole line; and at la<U+017F>t,
as if he were angry at the dulne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his genius, he tore the paper in pieces, and flung away
the Pen; at which <hi>Amintor</hi> <U+017F>miling, and wondering at it, he asked him, why he did <U+017F>o?

I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, an<U+017F>wered he, that my wits are off the hinges this day; This morning the
King commanded me to write a Letter of thankes unto a Lady, for <U+017F>ome favour which
<U+017F>he had done him, and to carry it to him when I had done, that he might tran<U+017F>cribe it;
but my genius is <U+017F>o dull to day, that I am not able to write one <U+017F>ignificant <U+017F>yllable to the
purpo<U+017F>e. <hi>Amintor</hi> loving <hi>Alcires,</hi> and knowing that <hi>Eurick</hi> u<U+017F>ed to imploy his friends
<U+017F>ometimes in <U+017F>uch Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ions, whom he thought had a happy faculty in penning; he
would try whether his malady would permit him to write this Letter for his friend, and
taking his <U+017F>cribled Paper out of his hand, the better to hint him upon the <U+017F>ubject, he
writ the<U+017F>e Lines.</p>

                        <hi>Alcires</hi> did de<U+017F>ire no more, but that <hi>Amintor</hi> <U+017F>hould write <U+017F>uch a Letter upon this <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
not with intention to give it unto the King, as he pretended; but to effect another
de<U+017F>igne which he had plotted in him<U+017F>elfe; he much commended therefore the acutene<U+017F><U+017F>e
of his fancy, and his facility of expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion; then thanked him for it, and put it in his
pocket: after this he went away, pretending to tran<U+017F>cribe it in his Clo<U+017F>et, where he was
to doe <U+017F>uch things. By fortune, the rude Copy which he fir<U+017F>t writ, remained upon

to put <U+017F>uch Papers, without any other de<U+017F>igne but that it might not be <U+017F>een. <hi>Alcires</hi> in
the mean time, <U+017F>ealed the Letter, but gave it no <U+017F>uper<U+017F>cription, and went to <hi>Clarinta,</hi>

not being ignorant that <hi>Alcires</hi> loved her as well as <hi>Amintor;</hi> yet <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e

that you <U+017F>hall not by your <U+017F>overaigne power over me, urge me to tell more then I am

mo<U+017F>t craftily, that poor <hi>Amintor</hi> is <U+017F>ecretly become de<U+017F>perately in love with one of the

cau<U+017F>e of it. Of which this faire one being adverti<U+017F>ed, was moved unto <U+017F>o much compa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
as to vi<U+017F>it him: and <U+017F>ince finding the grandure of his affection, <U+017F>he gave him <U+017F>o much
cau<U+017F>e of contentment, as before <U+017F>he did of de<U+017F>paire Do not expect, Madam, that I <U+017F>hould
tell you who it is, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you can gue<U+017F>s at her by the effects which I <U+017F>hall relate: but <U+017F>o it
is, that this very morning he hath a writ a Letter unto her, and made me his confident to
carry it. <hi>Clarinta</hi> hearing this, and being infinitely <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at it, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e
but blu<U+017F>h extreamly; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not have <hi>Alcires</hi> <U+017F>ee her, <U+017F>he held her Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercher
before her face, and asked him who that kind Lady was, <U+017F>till keeping her Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercher
clo<U+017F>e to her face: This is it Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcires</hi> which you promi<U+017F>ed not to urge
me to reveale; but to give you full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of what I <U+017F>ay, though the Letter be <U+017F>ealed,
yete will break it open and <U+017F>hew it unto you, then he opened it, and pre<U+017F>ented it unto her<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
She who knew it very well to be <hi>Amintors</hi> hand, as <U+017F>oone as ever <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t her eye upon it,
and therefore beleeved all that <hi>Alcires</hi> <U+017F>aid: <U+017F>he read it with a <U+017F>trange perturbation of
<U+017F>pirit, which <U+017F>till made her more and more de<U+017F>irous to know unto whom the<U+017F>e thankes
was directed. Will you not tell me <hi>Alcires</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) unto whom this good
language was written? Madam, <U+017F>aid he, I <U+017F>hould have named her unto you at the fir<U+017F>t,
had I not taken <U+017F>o deepe an oath to the contrary, as it is horror unto me to thinke of
breaking it: but let it <U+017F>uffice you that <U+017F>he is one of the faire<U+017F>t Ladies in all the Court I
beleeve it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Clarinta,</hi> <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ay it: but for all her beauty, let me tell you that <U+017F>he
is very kind: And <U+017F>ince you will not tell me her name, for want of other revenge <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall
never have the contentment of reading this Letter: Then out of <U+017F>pite, <U+017F>he tore it in <U+017F>everall
peeces. <hi>Alcires</hi> <U+017F>eemed to be hugely angry at this and would have hindred her, although
it was the lea<U+017F>t of his cares: at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing there was no remedy, he was pacified: I will
tell him, <U+017F>aid he, that as I pulled my Handkercher out of my pocket it fell into the
Fire and was burned before I ever tooke notice of it, but if he will write it, I will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
another.</p>
                     <p>Could he po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly u<U+017F>e more <U+017F>ubtilty to break of friend<U+017F>hip and love on both <U+017F>ides than
he did? And it had <U+017F>uch operation in them both, that <hi>Clarinta</hi> being deceived by this
Letter, and <hi>Amintor</hi> by his owne eyes, they were both <U+017F>o ill <U+017F>atisfied with each other, as
they longed for an opportunity of meeting to upbrald them<U+017F>elves mutually with infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
But upon better thoughts <hi>Clarinta</hi> <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ee <hi>Amintor</hi> no more, and <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
he would not as he u<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>end any more to vi<U+017F>it her; and all this did but the more
confirme them in tho<U+017F>e opinions which <hi>Alcires</hi> had infu<U+017F>ed into them.</p>
                     <p>Now Reverend Father, be plea<U+017F>ed to ob<U+017F>erve how ea<U+017F>ily Fortune can when <U+017F>he will,
facilitate the way unto her Favorites to bring about their de<U+017F>ignes. I have in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
long upon the <U+017F>ubtilties of <hi>Alcires,</hi> and di<U+017F>contents of <hi>Clarinta,</hi> that you may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the better under<U+017F>tand, how <hi>Alcidon</hi> to effect my reque<U+017F>t unto him, came to be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with <hi>Clarinta:</hi> for it is mo<U+017F>t certain, that without this di<U+017F><U+017F>ention he had very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed his de<U+017F>igne; but as he was ever happy in all his attempts, <U+017F>o he was no le<U+017F><U+017F>e
in this encounter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcidon</hi> would very faine have palliated his infidelity with words; and though I
was <U+017F>ilent when he <U+017F>poke, and <U+017F>eemed the fir<U+017F>t time he came unto me to take no notice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing; yet I know very well that he had other affections in him than unto me; and
without going any further, I was fully informed that <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> being dead, and when
<hi>Thierry</hi> his Brother a<U+017F><U+017F>umed the Crowne, then did he <U+017F>ee <hi>Clarinta</hi> in one of the <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi>
Cities, and loved her; and if I would, perhaps I could tell him both the time and
the place; but it will <U+017F>uffice that his owne <U+017F>oule knowes this to be true. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi>
<U+017F>eemed to deny what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid; Nay, nay, <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, never deny the truth;
you know that what I <U+017F>ay is true; And that a little after the accident of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donthe,
Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> dying and <hi>Thierry</hi> <U+017F>ucceding him, you followed him in his Voyages,
and at the <U+017F>eige of a City, you <U+017F>aw that Lady, in who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervice you had continued longer,
if <hi>Thierry</hi> had not dyed almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oone as he was King, and being <U+017F>ince much imployed
by the great <hi>Eurick</hi> in <U+017F>everall enterpri<U+017F>es, you forgot <hi>Clarinta,</hi> as you did me. Come,

                        </gap>d; if I would, I could relate, not onely the beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F><U+017F>e
of this affection; but perhaps al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o many particulars of your life, as will make
you amazed.</p>
                     <p>I <U+017F>peake this, wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas,</hi> not to upbraid his incon<U+017F>tancy; for I know that his age
would not then permit him to be more con<U+017F>tant; but my drift is onely to let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53527:36"/>
that it was much le<U+017F><U+017F>e paines to him to make his affection knowne unto that Lady.
I do not deny, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and interrupted her, but that at the time you mention, I did
<U+017F>ee <hi>Clarinta,</hi> and that her beauty did at the fir<U+017F>t blu<U+017F>h ravi<U+017F>h me, by an unexpected encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
For at the <U+017F>eige of a Towne, there being an intermi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Armes, I went up to the
wals to fetch off <U+017F>ome Souldiers who lay a little too neere: There I e<U+017F>pyed this Lady
upon the battlements, <U+017F>peaking unto one of our Army whom <U+017F>he knew: I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay,
that as <U+017F>oone as I <U+017F>aw her, I admired her, and that <U+017F>he had then like to co<U+017F>t me my life,
For the Truce being ended whil<U+017F>t I was gazing upon her, I took no notice how Arrows flew
about as thicke as haile<U+017F>tones, which tho<U+017F>e of the Towne did <U+017F>hoot at me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I remember
her dre<U+017F><U+017F>e was an embleme of death, for <U+017F>he was then in mourning for her Father, <U+017F>o as
the <U+017F>ight of her was almo<U+017F>t mortall to me in that kind: but I will never confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that this
did ever make me falle in my duty to you, and you doe me mo<U+017F>t manife<U+017F>t injury if you
<U+017F>ay otherwi<U+017F>e. We will beleeve what you plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> but <hi>Alcidon,</hi> this time
in which I commanded you to <U+017F>peake unto her of Love was not the fir<U+017F>t time you <U+017F>aw her,
and therefore acce<U+017F><U+017F>e was more ea<U+017F>ie unto you. Yet at the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he knowing of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
betwixt us, becau<U+017F>e the King him<U+017F>elfe had told her, <U+017F>he did much reject his addre<U+017F><U+017F>e:
For you mu<U+017F>t know, Reverend Father, that the great <hi>Eurick</hi> de<U+017F>iring to in<U+017F>inuate him<U+017F>elf
into her favour, did let her under<U+017F>tand, that all the addre<U+017F><U+017F>es which he made unto me,
were onely in the behalfe of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> whom he told her was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love
with me.</p>
                     <p>This Cavalier being very de<U+017F>irous to overcome this fair one he would not be repul<U+017F>ed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fir<U+017F>t denial. But one day, when <hi>Eurick</hi> was walking upon the banks of <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> and
the better to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away his time, had invited many Ladies, among<U+017F>t which <hi>Clarinta</hi> and
I were; I ob<U+017F>erved how <hi>Alcidon</hi> accoa<U+017F>ted her, and how after he had talked a while
with her, he gave a paper unto her, which <U+017F>he tooke, and tore in peeces, and without
reading it threw it into the water. I could not then heare what he <U+017F>aid unto her, or what
<U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, becau<U+017F>e they <U+017F>poke very low, and I was very farre off. But <hi>Alcidon</hi> told
me <U+017F>ince, that he <U+017F>aid thus unto her.</p>
                     <p>Doe not thinke it <U+017F>trange Madam, I <U+017F>hould in this place try whether I can obtaine that
which I could not in another; I meane the honour and happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of your favour: For
being alwayes unfortunate, when I begged it upon the Land, I will try whether the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Water will prove more favourable unto me: And becau<U+017F>e when I looked upon
you, my <U+017F>oule was <U+017F>o wholly in my eyes, as my tongue forgot its function, and I could
not <U+017F>peake, therefore I pre<U+017F>ent my hearts humble de<U+017F>ires unto you in this paper, which
I would, but cannot <U+017F>peake: Upon this, he pre<U+017F>ented it unto her, and <U+017F>he fearing that
if <U+017F>he did refu<U+017F>e it, many might take notice of it, <U+017F>he tooke it, and <U+017F>aid thus unto him:
You have rea<U+017F>on <hi>Alcidon</hi> to thinke that this element will be more favourable unto you
than the other, if it be true that every thing favours its like; for your incon<U+017F>tant humour
does not at all re<U+017F>emble the Earth, but the Water very much, which ebbs and flowes,
and is never <U+017F>till. And to <U+017F>hew you that I am of the <U+017F>ame judgement, I will be<U+017F>tow upon it
this paper, in which you <U+017F>ay you have writ your de<U+017F>ires, to the end it may grant
your reque<U+017F>ts, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring my <U+017F>elfe that you being as incon<U+017F>tant as it, it will favour you, as
much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible it can: Upon this <U+017F>he tore the paper all in peeces, and without reading it,
threw it into the Water. Oh Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon</hi> to her, <U+017F>triving to <U+017F>tay her arm) can
you thus de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e the mo<U+017F>t pure affection that ever was offered unto you? Are you not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
unju<U+017F>t beauty that you are, to burne my heart by the flames of your eyes, but you
mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o drownd all my de<U+017F>ires in this Water before you <U+017F>ee them? You doe me wrong
replyed <U+017F>he, in accu<U+017F>ing me of inju<U+017F>tice, <U+017F>ince I make my <U+017F>elfe appeare to be mo<U+017F>t equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in detaining nothing of anothers, and in rendring unto this element, which is <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>tant,
the thoughts and conceptions of the mo<U+017F>t incon<U+017F>tant heart in the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niver<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t this Cavalier and <hi>Clarinta</hi> were thus talking, the King was di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing with
me; yet I was not <U+017F>o attentive to his talke, but <U+017F>till I had an eye upon <hi>Alcidon,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>uring
my <U+017F>elfe that <hi>Clarinta</hi> by <U+017F>ome action or other would give me <U+017F>ome light of what he <U+017F>aid;
and to the end that the King <U+017F>hould take notice of them, I fixed my eyes upon them, and
would not an<U+017F>wer him: And he pulling me by my arme, as if he would wake me out
of a <U+017F>leepe: I am awake Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, pray <U+017F>ee what I am ob<U+017F>erving; then I <U+017F>hewed

                        <hi>Clarinta</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and as fortune was, ju<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>ame time when the Cavalier
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53527:37"/>
gave her the Letter, <U+017F>o as he <U+017F>aw how <U+017F>he tore it, and threw it into the water, of which I
was very glad, to the end he might take notice of this new Love; knowing very well,
that in <U+017F>uch matters as the<U+017F>e, you need onely make them <U+017F>ee a little, and let jealou<U+017F>ie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
to make up the re<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>Since this day, <hi>Alcidon</hi> followed his enterpri<U+017F>e <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, that the faire <hi>Clarinta</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this would be a fit meanes to gaine <hi>Eurick,</hi> and to make <hi>Amintor</hi> lament the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e
he had of her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to incline unto him; I <U+017F>ay <U+017F>eemed, for indeed <U+017F>he was then ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of Ambition then Love; and therefore <U+017F>he aimed at <hi>Eurickes</hi> love, and was vexed
at <hi>Amintor,</hi> thinking he had left her for <U+017F>ome other; again<U+017F>t which, <U+017F>he thought her
Carra<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> might be very profitable unto her: For <U+017F>he knew very well, that to
reduce an Apo<U+017F>tate Lover, there was no better way then to make him jealous; and to get
the affection of a King, no better artifice, then fir<U+017F>t to get the favour of his favorites, as <U+017F>he
knew this Cavalier to be one, to the end that they by their good words in the cure of
their ma<U+017F>ter, might induce him unto love: be<U+017F>ides which, <U+017F>he had as <U+017F>he thought, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this in me, whom <U+017F>he knew <hi>Alcidon</hi> favoured; and <U+017F>he thought that I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
unto the Kings favour by this meanes. Upon the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations therefore, <U+017F>he
began to hearken unto this Cavalier, and to conferre <U+017F>ome kind of triviall favours upon
him, of which I was very glad, thinking that when the King <U+017F>aw it, he would according
to his humour, be extreamly offended at it: and when I could talke unto <hi>Alcidon</hi> in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
I <U+017F>till <U+017F>olicited him to engraciate him<U+017F>elfe further into her favour, and to court her
as much as he could in the <U+017F>ight of King <hi>Eurick,</hi> which he did <U+017F>o effectually, that not
onely the King, and <hi>Amintor,</hi> but almo<U+017F>t all the Court took notice of it, though neither
<hi>Clarinta</hi> nor <hi>Alcidon,</hi> had at the fir<U+017F>t any aimes of making them<U+017F>elves loved in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>t,
but onely as conducing to their <U+017F>everall de<U+017F>ignes, which could not be accompli<U+017F>hed
had they kept their amities in <U+017F>ecret; becau<U+017F>e all the effects which they hoped for, was to
proceed from the knowledge which others were to have of it.</p>
                     <p>They continued thus a long while, during which, <hi>Amintor</hi> <U+017F>till inveighed again<U+017F>t the
affection which he bore unto <hi>Clarinta;</hi> his generous <U+017F>oule not being able to con<U+017F>ent, that
his heart <U+017F>hould ever love one, who as he thought had <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>ely betrayed him. On the
other <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he who thought that <U+017F>he had more rea<U+017F>on to hate him, for <U+017F>o unworthily ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ting
her off, although <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed not to care a ru<U+017F>h for it, yet her <U+017F>oule was <U+017F>o extreamly
nettled with <U+017F>pite at it, as though <U+017F>he was not able to find revenge <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired,
yet <U+017F>he could not defend her <U+017F>elfe from extreame <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e, which in her face did di<U+017F>cover
that di<U+017F>content, which her heart would have concealed: And as a <U+017F>now-ball growes big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for being rowled in the <U+017F>now, <U+017F>o this her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure being joyned unto other vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereof the life of man is very fertile, together with <U+017F>ome indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<U+017F>he was brought into <U+017F>uch a condition, as <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>trained to keep her bed, where
all her pa<U+017F>time was to <U+017F>igh and lament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amintor</hi> was pre<U+017F>ently adverti<U+017F>ed of it; for by rea<U+017F>on of their affinity, both their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<U+017F>tiques
had much familiarity together. But this was not enough to appea<U+017F>e the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<U+017F>pirit of that Cavalier. It happened, that this faire one growing every day wor<U+017F>e and
wor<U+017F>e, he was told one night that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o very ill, as it was feared <U+017F>he would not live
until the morning. Thus farre he had held out; but hearing talke of death, he thought
it time to render him<U+017F>elfe, and therefore without more delay, he dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe by force,
and though <U+017F>ick, yet crawling as well as he could to the lodging of <hi>Clarinta,</hi> he found
her in bed, yet not in <U+017F>uch extremity as was reported. She who expected any vi<U+017F>it <U+017F>ooner
then his, and who was much offended at him, could not indure his pre<U+017F>ence without
paine, thinking that he came to <U+017F>ee her onely to delude her more; and therefore <U+017F>he row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
up her <U+017F>elfe with a re<U+017F>olution to anger him as much as <U+017F>he could: And in order to
this, after <U+017F>ome common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he asked him, what newes at Court: For, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
I keeping my bed as you <U+017F>ee me, I know nothing, but what out of pitty is told me. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Amintor</hi> faintly, It is <U+017F>o long <U+017F>ince I was at Court, or in any place but my bed,
as you mu<U+017F>t not aske me for any newes: I came hither onely to <U+017F>ee you, and am very glad
to find you in a better condition then I heard you were. Perhaps <hi>Amintor,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he,
you were in hopes to finde me dead: No, no, Sir, I will not yet put you to the expences
of mourning for me: And to <U+017F>hew that I am not, thankes be to God, in <U+017F>uch a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
I will manife<U+017F>t to you, that my thoughts are quite another way; then putting her
hand under her Pillow, <U+017F>he pulled out a Paper which <U+017F>he gave him; Here <hi>Amintor,</hi> reade
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53527:37"/>
the<U+017F>e Lines which were writ upon tho<U+017F>e Flowers which you <U+017F>ee at my Beds head; &amp; if you
cannot gue<U+017F>s at the Author, I will tell you who it is: Before I ever reade them, <U+017F>aid he,
I am mo<U+017F>t confident that I can name him; then opening the Paper, he began to read
it.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Amintor</hi> had read two or three lines, he pau<U+017F>ed a while: Well Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinta</hi>
unto him, what doe you thinke upon them? Hitherto, an<U+017F>wered he, I find nothing
which makes me alter my opinion, except the hand, which indeed is not the <U+017F>ame I
thought it; but perhaps it was writ purpo<U+017F>ely to delude tho<U+017F>e that read it. I am <U+017F>ure, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Clarinta,</hi> that you are mi<U+017F>taken; but read on, and perhaps you will know better, and
your opinion will be quite confu<U+017F>ed. Then <hi>Amintor</hi> began to read again; and when he had
read a line or two further; I cannot tell, <U+017F>aid he, whether that which followes may alter
my opinion; but thus far I am <U+017F>till in the <U+017F>ame minde, and then he began to read out the
re<U+017F>t. When he had done, he mu<U+017F>ed, and was much gravelled to imagine who <U+017F>hould be the
Author: for at fir<U+017F>t he thought upon <hi>Alcires,</hi> but the conclu<U+017F>ion put him quite out of
that conceit: <hi>Clarinta</hi> <U+017F>eeing he could not hit upon it, and <U+017F>eeming to make great e<U+017F>teem
of the Paper, <U+017F>he laid it in the place where it lay, and then turning towards him; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>Amintor,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that you cannot find out the Author; but, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, he is a
per<U+017F>on who merits as good fortune as any about the Court, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered

pre<U+017F>ently, doe you thinke me <U+017F>o liberall of my favours, as to conferre them upon any one?
this might <U+017F>erve <U+017F>uch a one unto whom you gave <U+017F>o many fine thanks; but if you have not
forgotten the way of my living with you, when you made addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to me, you may
know that I am not a per<U+017F>on from whom any favours are to be expected. Oh Madam,
an<U+017F>wered he, and <U+017F>ighed, I have but too good a memory of what you mention; But
alas, my own eyes are <U+017F>uch certaine witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, that I cannot give them the lye. <hi>Clarinta</hi>
was very ill; but when <U+017F>he heard him <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he turned in a fury towards him; what can

as you tell me <hi>Alcires</hi> is again<U+017F>t me, who never gave him any cau<U+017F>e? Can the clemency

world more fal<U+017F>e than this impo<U+017F>ture, and may the gods poure out the highe<U+017F>t of their
indignation upon me, if there be any part of this calumny true: in the <U+017F>econd place, I
conjure you by our former friend<U+017F>hip, and by all tho<U+017F>e promi<U+017F>es of good will unto me
which you have vowed unto me, al<U+017F>o by the obligation of con<U+017F>anguinity betwixt us, that
you <U+017F>earch out this wickedne<U+017F><U+017F>e to the very bottome, <U+017F>o as there may not remain in you
or any that heares of it, the lea<U+017F>t doubt of the truth: And upon this condition and no
other, I will pardon the offence you have done me in beleeving <U+017F>uch fal<U+017F>e and wicked
things of me; And though I could clear the matter before you goe from hence; yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
for my <U+017F>atisfaction, that as <hi>Alcires</hi> and your owne eyes have deceived you, <U+017F>o I
would have it them that <U+017F>hould undeceive you, you <U+017F>ay that he u<U+017F>ed to come very often
unto me: Looke, but looke well into the matter, and I am confident you will find he went
<U+017F>ome whither el<U+017F>e. And yet, not to leave you long in <U+017F>o bad an opinion of me, I will let
you <U+017F>ee that <hi>Alcires</hi> does not manage his villany with judgement; You told me that when
he brought you to my Chamber doore, was the <U+017F>ame day that <hi>Eurick</hi> conde<U+017F>cended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Daphnides</hi> petition concerning a Pri<U+017F>oner; I doe very well remember by a remarkable
accident, that it was the fifteenth day of the Month of <hi>Mars:</hi> Now I would gladly have
you heare the te<U+017F>timony of all the <U+017F>ervants in my hou<U+017F>e, before I <U+017F>peake with them, to the
end you may know that God may permit innocency to be <U+017F>landered, but not oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed;
And it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that in this God hath <U+017F>hewed a particular protection, <U+017F>ince for
more than eight dayes before, and more then eight dayes after the fifteenth day of the
month of <hi>Mars,</hi> I did not lye in my Chamber, but in my Mothers, unto whom I went
every night, by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition which <U+017F>he had.</p>
                     <p>If it be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Amintor,</hi> than the villany is cleerly di<U+017F>covered: You <U+017F>hall immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<U+017F>ee (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that <U+017F>o it is: upon this, <U+017F>he called for all her maids, and in the pre<U+017F>ence
of the Cavalier asked them, how long it was <U+017F>ince the la<U+017F>t time <U+017F>he lay in her Mothers
Chamber, and how many nights <U+017F>he lay there; all of them te<U+017F>tified the very <U+017F>ame <U+017F>he had
told, and did make the impo<U+017F>ture of <hi>Alcires</hi> <U+017F>o plaine that <hi>Amintor</hi> was put out of all
doubt.</p>
                     <p>This Cavalier hearing the concurrent Te<U+017F>timonies of <U+017F>o many, he was <U+017F>o convinced of
the truth, as he thought it ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be otherwi<U+017F>e. And when all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were retired, he <U+017F>aid thus unto <hi>Clarinta;</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e Madam, that the
impo<U+017F>ture of <hi>Alcires</hi> is very great, and containes two grand offences; the one again<U+017F>t you,
&amp; the other again<U+017F>t me; and becau<U+017F>e I am <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible as well of my own error as his wickednes;
I mo<U+017F>t humbly beg a pardon for retaining <U+017F>uch an ill opinion of you, be<U+017F>eeching you to
con<U+017F>ider how cunningly this villany hath been carried, and how true love is alwayes apt
to be jealous: When I have the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e to obtaine this pardon, I <U+017F>hall then call <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
to a <U+017F>trickt accompt for <U+017F>taining the reputation of <hi>Clarinta</hi> and for mo<U+017F>t perfidiou<U+017F>ly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53527:38"/>
betraying his friend <hi>Amintor</hi> by his <U+017F>ubtle impo<U+017F>tures. <hi>Clarinta</hi> who <U+017F>till pre<U+017F>erved <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>parkes of good will unto this Cavalier, <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ively upon his knees before
her, <U+017F>he kindly tooke him up, and cau<U+017F>ing him to fit by her, with teares in her eyes <U+017F>aid
thus unto him. Although <hi>Amintor,</hi> the <U+017F>ubtle villany of <hi>Alcires</hi> be very great and much
beyond your crime; yet let me tell you that you are farre from being blamele<U+017F><U+017F>e in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<U+017F>uch things of me, having long before received <U+017F>o many te<U+017F>timonies from me of the
contrary: But when I con<U+017F>ider your affection to me, I will lay the whole load upon jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie,
which is ordinary with tho<U+017F>e that love, and <U+017F>o pardon the fault upon two condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
the one is, that <U+017F>ince <hi>Alcires</hi> u<U+017F>eth to come <U+017F>o often unto me in the night, you to
follow him, <U+017F>o as you may know whither he goes, for certainly he comes not hither; in
thus doing, perhaps you will di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>ome other haunts, which I <U+017F>hall be glad to know,
that I may pay him in his owne Coyne, and doe him the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure he intended to doe
me: The other condition is, that you promi<U+017F>e me not to re<U+017F>ent this offence too deeply
again<U+017F>t him; I know your courage is apt to call him unto <U+017F>atisfaction, and this I mu<U+017F>t
not <U+017F>uffer, becau<U+017F>e if you doe you will offend me more than he has; it would reflect much
upon me, you would thereby make all the Court know that which is now onely knowne
to your <U+017F>elfe; you know that a Calumny will bla<U+017F>t a womans reputation and <U+017F>candals
will <U+017F>pread them<U+017F>elves like aire into all eares. Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Amintor</hi>) this la<U+017F>t command
goes <U+017F>omething hardly downe; and I be<U+017F>eech you con<U+017F>ider, that though it be not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of you, yet I am obliged to let this impo<U+017F>tor know, that I am not a per<U+017F>on that
can put up <U+017F>uch injuries: for reputation is <U+017F>o chairy and cautelous, as though none know
any thing, yet if we our <U+017F>elves can <U+017F>uffer any indignity without re<U+017F>entment, we are not
worthy to be called per<U+017F>ons of honour; for a con<U+017F>cience is as good as a thou<U+017F>and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>es.
<hi>Amintor,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, I would have you doe this for my <U+017F>ake, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
with your <U+017F>elfes, that every Cavalier is obliged at much unto the honour of Ladies
as their own; you know <hi>Amintor</hi> that you ought to have a care of mine, and ought not
to doe any thing which may give it the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>taine. I will not in<U+017F>tance by way of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon you, the affection which heretofore you have promi<U+017F>ed unto me; for I now
<U+017F>ee, that the power I have over you is but very little. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Amintor,</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
her, to <U+017F>hew you that you never had more power over me than now you have, I
will do as you command me, but <U+017F>till upon condition that you tell me, what the perfidie is
whereof you accu<U+017F>e me, and whether it ari<U+017F>e from <U+017F>uch another originall as that of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
I do beleeve, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be <U+017F>o, yet your owne hand writing which
I know very well, will hardly let me thinke you innocent. Then cau<U+017F>ing a box to be
brought unto her, <U+017F>he tooke out the torne paper which <hi>Alcires</hi> gave unto her, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one piece unto him, can you deny, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that this is your writing? <hi>Amintor</hi>
having looked well upon it; I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, Madam, <U+017F>aid he, that this is my hand: Then
<U+017F>aid <hi>Clarinta,</hi> when all the peeces are put together, they will <U+017F>hew you the perfidie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I accu<U+017F>e you; for I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e the Letter was brought whole unto my hands; but when
I <U+017F>aw my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>ely betrayed by a per<U+017F>on from whom I lea<U+017F>t expected it, very <U+017F>pite and
anger made me tear it thus in pieces. <hi>Amintor</hi> was <U+017F>o much amazed as he could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer;
but <U+017F>he rai<U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elfe up in her bed, and <U+017F>preading the pieces of paper upon it, <U+017F>he
joyned them <U+017F>o together as <U+017F>he read unto him, that thankes which he gave for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
favour which he had received. <hi>Amintor</hi> calling to memory the time when
he writ this Letter, and by what cunning he was induced to write it: I mu<U+017F>t needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e
Madam <U+017F>aid he, that <hi>Alcires</hi> is the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtle, crafty and pernitious man that ever
breathed; tis true I writ this Letter, and gave it unto him onely as a Copy, and without
any <U+017F>eale; and <U+017F>o he told the whole <U+017F>tory and truth of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e: but, <U+017F>aid he, I doe
remember one thing which remains in my hands, and which confirmes, as you <U+017F>aid, that
God never fails the innocent, for that will <U+017F>hew you the truth of what I tell you and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by your permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, I will <U+017F>end for a little box, in which I put the paper that <hi>Alcires</hi>
writ, when he intreated me to indite that Letter for him, according as he <U+017F>aid, the King
had commanded him. By which you may plainly <U+017F>ee, that what I did was only at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance,
and without any concernment of my owne. <hi>Clarinta</hi> had a great de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ift out
the matter, and therefore de<U+017F>ired him to <U+017F>end for this paper which being pre<U+017F>ently brought
did cleerly te<U+017F>tifie the truth of what <hi>Amintor</hi> <U+017F>aid, which gave <U+017F>uch full <U+017F>atisfaction unto
<hi>Clarinta</hi> (for <U+017F>he knew the hand of <hi>Alcires</hi> very well) as giving her hand unto <hi>Amintor,</hi>
I aske your pardon wronged <hi>Amintor,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, for the ill opinion which I entertained of

my good fortune; He would have continued, but he was prevented by the Kings coming
in, who hearing how ill this Lady was, he came to vi<U+017F>it her, almo<U+017F>t all alone, le<U+017F>t too
much company <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>quiet her: and he came in upon <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>uddaine, as he <U+017F>urpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
the pieces of the Letter which were upon the bed: As for <hi>Amintor,</hi> he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
put his up; but <hi>Clarinta</hi> was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at the Kings <U+017F>uddaine coming, and finding
that Cavalier with her, as <U+017F>he forgot to put hers up: And the King <U+017F>pying them, laid
his hand upon them <U+017F>o quickly, as <U+017F>he could not hinder him, and all her prayers were fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e
to make him render it back again. But on the contrary, lapping it up very carefully
in his Hankercher; and after he had talked with her a while, he retired him<U+017F>elfe to his
Clo<U+017F>et, where putting the pieces of Paper into order, and <U+017F>aw the thankes which <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
gave her, (for he knew it to be his hand) imagine you in what a ca<U+017F>e he was. All
Lovers are commonly jealous, but e<U+017F>pecially this King; whether it was that he loved with
great violence, or whether his generous courage could not brooke a Rivall; yet <U+017F>o it was,
that this jealou<U+017F>ie moved him to <U+017F>uch a hatred of this fair &amp; wi<U+017F>e Lady, as he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
him<U+017F>elfe with telling this unto me, and <U+017F>hewing the Letter unto <hi>Amintor;</hi> but he
blazed it abroad, and made <U+017F>uch a publique matter of it, as all the Court had talke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
upon that <U+017F>ubject.</p>
                     <p>Ob<U+017F>erve, <U+017F>age Father, how this petti<U+017F>h god, whom they call Love, is plea<U+017F>ed to make
him<U+017F>elfe merry with <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>erve him, I de<U+017F>ired to break off the amity betwixt <hi>Eurick</hi>
and <hi>Clarinta;</hi> and in order thereunto, I made u<U+017F>e of <hi>Alcidons</hi> love by way of gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
and to the end I <U+017F>hould not be beholding to my own prudence, did rai<U+017F>e up <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
who with a Letter which fell into the hands of the King, did doe the work for me.
The drift of <hi>Alcires,</hi> was to take off a <U+017F>ervant from <hi>Clarinta,</hi> and by his <U+017F>ubtilty make
her hate his Rivall, and quite contrary, the di<U+017F>atisfaction of <hi>Clarinta</hi> was the cau<U+017F>e of her
receiving <hi>Alcidon</hi> into her favour: And <U+017F>o <hi>Alcires,</hi> in lieu of one Rivall, found two.
<hi>Alcidon</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, who gave that Paper of Ver<U+017F>es unto <hi>Clarinta,</hi> in hopes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
her favour, he gave occa<U+017F>ion to <hi>Amintor</hi> to be reconciled unto her, and to find out
the knavery of <hi>Alcires. Alcires</hi> he got <hi>Amintor</hi> to write a Letter, with intention to
make the faire <hi>Clarinta</hi> hate him by it; and this Letter quite contrary to his aime, did
make him<U+017F>elfe out of favour: But the wor<U+017F>t of all is, and which is the cau<U+017F>e of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into this Country: I who aiming to make <hi>Clarinta</hi> lo<U+017F>e a <U+017F>ervant, I gave her one,
and deprived my <U+017F>elfe of him, to re<U+017F>igne him unto her; for <hi>Alcidon</hi> <U+017F>ince that time, has
<U+017F>o wholly devoted him<U+017F>elfe unto her, that he is mine onely in his tongue, and hers in
his heart. Oh the giddy and uncon<U+017F>tant humours of men! There is nothing in the world
will make them and their fleeting minds firm and <U+017F>table.</p>
                     <p>But this Cavalier, having begun a Court<U+017F>hip of this Lady, by my commands, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
it according to his will; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he may very well boa<U+017F>t, that as I took one <U+017F>ervant
from her, <U+017F>he has al<U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>hed another from me, and with this advantage, that <U+017F>he loved
<hi>Eurick</hi> onely out of ambition: but I did love <hi>Alcidon</hi> really and cordially: At the
fir<U+017F>t, I did not re<U+017F>ent the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e I received extream contentment in being, delivered
from that inquietude which <hi>Clarinta</hi> kept me in, till of late. But I did not long enjoy
this re<U+017F>t, for it <U+017F>eems the heaven is plea<U+017F>ed I <U+017F>hould tread alwaies upon thornes; for I had
no <U+017F>ooner enjoyed this happy victory, but I was forced to take up Armes again<U+017F>t a new
enemy.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Eurick</hi> being extreamly offended at <hi>Clarinta,</hi> but for <U+017F>ome great and prudent
con<U+017F>iderations, dur<U+017F>t not make <U+017F>hew of his re<U+017F>entments, he re<U+017F>olved to make her repent it,
and through envy would cha<U+017F>tife her, by conferring tho<U+017F>e favours on another, which might
have been hers, could <U+017F>he have been contented to be onely his. And in order to this re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
whereas before time his affection was divided among<U+017F>t three; now his intention
was, to place it all, at lea<U+017F>t all his favours, upon one onely Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>I told you before, that when I de<U+017F>ired <hi>Alcidon</hi> to make addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto <hi>Clarinta,</hi> there
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53527:39"/>
was another Lady who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Adelonde,</hi> unto whom the King had made <U+017F>ome <U+017F>igns
of goodwill. And now, in revenge upon <hi>Clarinta,</hi> he devotes him<U+017F>elfe, and all his favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto her; <U+017F>he is now become his, and the Courts onely Idol; <U+017F>o as though
her extraction was much inferiour unto <hi>Clarinta's</hi> or mine, yet <U+017F>uch was his de<U+017F>igne to
preferre her before us both; <U+017F>o as I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I was two or three times in a mind to break
off quite with him: But <hi>Alcidon,</hi> by his wi<U+017F>e advice, <U+017F>till di<U+017F><U+017F>waded me, and in this made
me overcome both my <U+017F>elfe, the King, and her: <U+017F>o as I may well <U+017F>ay, that I doe owe all
the contentments which I have <U+017F>ince received, unto him, and his patience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adelonde</hi> being now rai<U+017F>ed above all her hopes, <U+017F>he <U+017F>till rai<U+017F>ed her preten<U+017F>ions unto a
higher pitch and though all the world did thinke the favours which this great Prince
conferred upon her, to be very high, yet <U+017F>till her de<U+017F>ires were higher. The<U+017F>e in<U+017F>atible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ires
prompted her to make u<U+017F>e of all wayes, ju<U+017F>t or unju<U+017F>t, ea<U+017F>ie or hard, to accompli<U+017F>h
them. And therefore, when <U+017F>ome of her friends advi<U+017F>ed her to u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome charmes, thereby
to retaine the wavering minde of this Prince, <U+017F>he hearkened unto them; Whereupon, <U+017F>he
gave unto the Great <hi>Eurick,</hi> a bracelet of her haire, the lockets whereof were Lions, <U+017F>et
with <U+017F>tones: The<U+017F>e Lions had <U+017F>uch a quality, as who<U+017F>oever wore them about their arms,
they could love none but her. Perhaps it may not be <U+017F>trange, that two <U+017F>uch pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions,
as Love and Ambition, <U+017F>hould tempt her unto this Crime, had <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ted here, and
not add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d a <U+017F>econd, which indeed proceeded meerly for want of judgement: But <U+017F>he
thinking that he would pre<U+017F>erve them as precious Gemmes, and would weare them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually;
or at lea<U+017F>t, to make him do <U+017F>o, and not give them unto another: <U+017F>he told him,
that a very learned Druid, who had a very particular care of him and his Crown, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what wicked attempts would be again<U+017F>t his life and <U+017F>tate, had made tho<U+017F>e Lions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<U+017F>uch Con<U+017F>tellations, and with <U+017F>uch Art, that as long as he wore them about his Arme,
no enterpri<U+017F>e of his enemies <U+017F>hould have any effect again<U+017F>t him; but as often as any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>e
was attempted to his prejudice, the<U+017F>e Lions would adverti<U+017F>e him, by <U+017F>cratching his
Arm gently with their Clawes.</p>
                     <p>But <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>age Father, how the Heavens doe mock at tho<U+017F>e, who would compa<U+017F><U+017F>e their
de<U+017F>ignes by unlawful meanes. That which this Lady had taken <U+017F>o much paines about, to
augment and pre<U+017F>erve the affection of this great Prince unto her, was it which made her
entirely lo<U+017F>e it: For as <U+017F>oon as ever he perceived that <U+017F>he made u<U+017F>e of Charmes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
he believed that all the inclinations he had unto her, proceeded from <U+017F>ome Divels,
and not from her beauty, or any merit in her: and from that time did <U+017F>o extreamly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
her, as he would never come neere her; and when he <U+017F>pake of her, he called her his
Medea, and his Witch.</p>
                     <p>I have related this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, Father, not as any way relating unto <hi>Alcidon,</hi> or me; but
onely that you may better know the humour and <U+017F>pirit of the Great <hi>Eurick,</hi> and by that
to judge whether I had not great rea<U+017F>on to pre<U+017F>erve his good will unto me, by all manner
of prudent <U+017F>ubtilty that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could; and whether I had not as good rea<U+017F>on to impo<U+017F>e
this task upon <hi>Alcidor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, what<U+017F>oever I <U+017F>hall relate unto you more concerning this great Prince, will not at
all concerne the difference betwixt us; for <U+017F>ince that time, we lived together as we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The King he returned unto me with all manner of <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion and <U+017F>orrow, for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a per<U+017F>on whom formerly he had loved. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before my face, never rendring unto me tho<U+017F>e offices which the affection I had unto him
merited, and which by the law of Fidelity he was bound to pay, had there beene any
<U+017F>park of that virtue in him. As for me, I bore it out as well as I could, and pre<U+017F>erved
the Kings favours to me with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>olicitations: <U+017F>o as I could with truth <U+017F>ay, that
among<U+017F>t all my cares, none was <U+017F>o great, as to <U+017F>ee this fickle <hi>Alcidon</hi> was not a<U+017F>hamed to
<U+017F>erve that Lady in my very pre<U+017F>ence, after <U+017F>o many promi<U+017F>es of affection and fidelity to
me.</p>
                     <p>But, Father, why <U+017F>hould I talke any more upon this <U+017F>ubject, <U+017F>ince I now mu<U+017F>t tell you
of this great Princes death; and tell it I mu<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince, I owe it unto the memory of the
greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t generous Prince that ever raigned in <hi>Gaule.</hi> Now therefore, <U+017F>age
<hi>Adamas,</hi> that the great <hi>Eurick</hi> finding the affection of <hi>Clarinta</hi> fickle, and that of <hi>Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>londa,</hi>
full of foul practices, he thought mine onely worthy of him<U+017F>elfe; for he <U+017F>aw me
keep <U+017F>uch a retired decorum in all my wayes, as he could not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect I loved any but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe,
unle<U+017F><U+017F>e it was <hi>Alcidon,</hi> of whom he could not entertaine the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>park of jealou<U+017F>ie.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53527:40"/>
But calling all my actions into his memory, and how mode<U+017F>tly I had tolerated his various
affections and departures, and al<U+017F>o how <U+017F>weetly I received him at his returne, he came at
length to that re<U+017F>olution which I de<U+017F>ired, and declared that he would marry me, and make
me Queen, as well of his Dominions, as of his heart and affections. Judge, Reverend
Father, whether I and all my relations had not good rea<U+017F>on to deem our <U+017F>elves fully hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py:
But alas, I find too well, that the heavens are not plea<U+017F>ed to let a high happine<U+017F><U+017F>e
la<U+017F>t long: For when I was arrived at the very top of all my hopes, happine<U+017F><U+017F>e and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ires;
when I had made all preparations of joy for the marriage, a cur<U+017F>ed A<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F>inate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in<U+017F>pired with a helli<U+017F>h <U+017F>pirit, did ravi<U+017F>h him from me by a fatall blow which he tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terou<U+017F>ly
gave him to the heart.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heavens! Can you <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>uch a horrid villany to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e unpuni<U+017F>hed? mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>uch

be any <U+017F>o unnaturally wicked from <U+017F>uch a cur<U+017F>ed act? You may imagine in what a <U+017F>ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I was, when this fatall newes was brought unto me by the outcryes of the People:
For my part I am not able to tell you how I tooke it; for I did not onely lo<U+017F>e the u<U+017F>e of
my rea<U+017F>on, but al<U+017F>o of my <U+017F>en<U+017F>es for a long time; for every one tooke me for dead. Oh
happy had I been if it had been to; then <U+017F>hould I have buried all my <U+017F>orrows, &amp; all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments
would have followed him to his Grave. Upon the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>uch a flood of teares
flowed in her eyes, as <U+017F>he was not able to <U+017F>peake of a long time; which gave a <U+017F>ufficient
te<U+017F>timony how deepely <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ented her lo<U+017F><U+017F>e; but at la<U+017F>t, the wind of <U+017F>everall <U+017F>ighes dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the raine of her eyes, <U+017F>he a<U+017F><U+017F>umed her <U+017F>pirit, and continued thus.</p>
                     <p>Pardon I be<U+017F>eech you Father, the weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e of a woman, for <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion might
perhaps excu<U+017F>e a <U+017F>pirit of a higher temper than mine, did any re<U+017F>ent them <U+017F>o neer the heart
as I doe. But to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e over <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ad remembrances which cannot chu<U+017F>e but be tedious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and to fall into the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e where I digre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, give me leave to tell you, that
whil<U+017F>t I was in the mid<U+017F>t of laments, and could not find any re<U+017F>t or con<U+017F>olation to my <U+017F>ad
<U+017F>oule; this cruell <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to loaden me with more mi<U+017F>ery, did pre<U+017F>ently quit <hi>Clarinta</hi>
and comes impudently upon me, as if he had never let any other have a <U+017F>hare in his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I was much amazed to <U+017F>ee him without blu<U+017F>h talke to me with as
much confidence as formerly; but I was more offended at him for coming upon me <U+017F>o
impudently, and never offering to aske pardon for the injury he had done me, and to
talke to me of love and affection: For nothing under the Sun offends a woman more than
after profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Love to quit her and love another. I permitted his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e a long
while and gave no an<U+017F>wer: I beleeve he attributed my <U+017F>ilence unto the re<U+017F>entments of my
lo<U+017F><U+017F>e; but <U+017F>eeing he continued on, my patience could hold out no longer, and therefore
I was con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>ay thus unto him. <hi>Alcidon</hi> let me intreat you to hold your peace,
<U+017F>uch talke as this, is not now <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable betwixt us; though heretofore it was permitted,
yet now, <U+017F>ince both you and I are much changed from what we were, it is not allowable.
He would have an<U+017F>wered, but I gave him the <U+017F>top, and <U+017F>aid unto him; Yes, yes, <hi>Alcidon,</hi>
both you and I are very much altered: I in this, becau<U+017F>e heretofore I thought you had lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
only <hi>Daphaide,</hi> and am now a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of the contrary: And you in this, that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you devoted your <U+017F>elfe wholly unto me, and now the faire <hi>Clarinta</hi> onely po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>eth
you, and may <U+017F>he long and peacably enjoy her Conque<U+017F>t: I promi<U+017F>e you <hi>Alcidon</hi> that
I am <U+017F>o farre from envying her happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, as I will pray the Heavens it may many ages
continue: <hi>Alcidon</hi> was mightily amazed at this, and would gladly have ju<U+017F>tified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe;
but I was <U+017F>o certaine of the truth, as all his talke did rather move anger than love.
Afterwards (for at that time he <U+017F>aw me <U+017F>o angry, as he could not put in a word) I left
him in as angry a mood as I my <U+017F>elfe was: But the next morning he <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed me before
I was dre<U+017F>t; and by chance <hi>Carlis<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                        </hi> and <hi>Stiliana</hi> were then both in my Chamber, and they
being very familiar with us, neither he nor I concealed any thing from them: He fell
downe upon his knees, prote<U+017F>ted that he would never ri<U+017F>e, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I would promi<U+017F>e him
to heare his Ju<U+017F>tification patiently, and then he would let me di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of his life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F><U+017F>e
as I plea<U+017F>ed. I, who was <U+017F>ufficiently loaded with misfortunes already, had no
mind to adde unto them tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures which I fore<U+017F>aw, but per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in my re<U+017F>olution
not to hear him, knowing very well, that good wits never want good words to per<U+017F>wade
what they will, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who<U+017F>e eloquence I was not ignorant of, but was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
he would incline me to imbrace that <U+017F>ervice, which had <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>ely quitted me for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>

At la<U+017F>t <hi>Carlis</hi> and <hi>Stiliana</hi> hearing our conte<U+017F>t, they told me, that <U+017F>uch a Judge was
unju<U+017F>t as would condemne a Party before he heard him. Mo<U+017F>t true, my dear friends, <U+017F>aid
I unto them; but did you know as well as I, what charmes his words have whom you
would have me hear, you would advi<U+017F>e me to <U+017F>top my eares, rather than lend them unto
the inchantments of <U+017F>uch a Charmer as Serpents doe: But <U+017F>ince you will have it <U+017F>o, let
me oblige you to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me; which both promi<U+017F>ing they would, he ro<U+017F>e up, and knew <U+017F>o
well how to plead his Cau<U+017F>e, as they were both ab<U+017F>olutely for him. And becau<U+017F>e I knew
very well that all his eloquence was but oyled words and gilded language to gloze over his
excu<U+017F>es, without any reality of truth, I <U+017F>o farre re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted him, as it was re<U+017F>olved upon by

unto it was re<U+017F>olved upon. I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, Father, his importunity did much
move me unto it; but one of the cheife rea<U+017F>ons which induced me thereunto was my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
of being for a while ab<U+017F>ent from the place where I had <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ad Memorandums of
my lo<U+017F><U+017F>e, hoping that being farre off them, my <U+017F>orrowes would by degrees le<U+017F><U+017F>en: And
unto this may be added my curio<U+017F>ity of <U+017F>eeing whether that Country, and tho<U+017F>e who
dwelt in it were <U+017F>o happy as reports went; for wonders were told me of the places beauty,
of the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the Aire, the abundance of Rivers, full of Fi<U+017F>h, and the plea<U+017F>antne<U+017F><U+017F>e
of the Fields. But when I heard of the delectable lives of the Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es
of <hi>Loire,</hi> of <hi>Furant,</hi> of <hi>Argent,</hi> of <hi>Serane,</hi> but e<U+017F>pecially of <hi>Lignon,</hi> I was ravi<U+017F>hed, and
wondered that all <hi>Europe</hi> did not go and inhabit in Forre<U+017F>ts. To know therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all this fame was true, I con<U+017F>euted unto this journey: and becau<U+017F>e we heard that all
tho<U+017F>e who are there were habited in the garbs of <U+017F>hepherds and <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, al<U+017F>o de<U+017F>iring
not to be knowne, we di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed our <U+017F>elves in this habit, as well for the rea<U+017F>ons afore<U+017F>aid, as
becau<U+017F>e we needed not any great train of Servants to attend us.</p>
                     <p>Thus reverend Father, you have heard, not onely a relation of our lives pa<U+017F>t, and of
our difference, but al<U+017F>o the cau<U+017F>e of our Voyage, and of our di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e; we want nothing
now but your prudent direction, how we may <U+017F>ee and have addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto this Fountain,
and your <U+017F>apient Coun<U+017F>ell unto <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>tand in <U+017F>uch need of it as we doe.</p>
                     <p>Thus ended the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> leaving <hi>Adamas</hi> in a great opinion of her Prudence and
Wit; and becau<U+017F>e he perceived <U+017F>he expected his an<U+017F>wer, he replyed thus. Who is it Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that hath heard of great <hi>Euricke,</hi> and among<U+017F>t the wonders of his Hi<U+017F>tory does not
admire the pui<U+017F><U+017F>ance that the beauty of <hi>Daphnide</hi> had over his <U+017F>oule? I beleeve that <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
and <hi>Thyle</hi> have heard <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of it, as that your names are as well knowne
here as in <hi>Gaule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that pre<U+017F>ence which u<U+017F>ually does dimini<U+017F>h the opinion which fame
gives of ab<U+017F>ent per<U+017F>ons, does make it appeare that the opinion which I had of <hi>Daphni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
beauty and merit was much below what I find to be true: I thanke the Gods for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
my hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>o much as to <U+017F>ee you in it, and <U+017F>hould be much more thankfull if I can
be any way <U+017F>erviceable unto you<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> For, and it is without any flattery, I was never more
affected unto the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> or <hi>Galathea,</hi> then I am unto yours, and I <U+017F>hall e<U+017F>teem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day happy that gives me any opportunity to <U+017F>hew the truth of this: Let al<U+017F>o this my
devotion extend it <U+017F>elfe very farre unto <hi>Alcidon:</hi> And as to the Que<U+017F>tion which you aske
me concerning the Oracle, I can at pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ay no more but this; that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
you <U+017F>hould receive that benefit which the Oracle promi<U+017F>eth from the Fountaine, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>trange and even miraculous things do come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e: For Madam, this Fountaine
as I told you before is indeed in this Country, and not farre from this hou<U+017F>e, but <hi>Clide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
and <hi>Gug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as it is a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to attempt the <U+017F>eeing it by force: For it is perpetually watched
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53527:41"/>
by mo<U+017F>t fierce Animals; and <U+017F>uch Charms cannot be uncharmed, but by the death of the
mo<U+017F>t faithfull Male and Female Lovers in the world. What kind of Animals are they?
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon</hi>): for to te<U+017F>tifie that I doe, and ever did love this faire<U+017F>t Lady, I am very
willing to venture one.</p>
                     <p>If you can but finde, <U+017F>aid the Druid, and <U+017F>miled, the mo<U+017F>t faithfull female, as it <U+017F>eemes
you have the male, perhaps you may with the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of your life, let the faire <hi>Daphnide</hi>
<U+017F>ee this Fountaine: but I believe you will hardly finde a companion; and <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o,
I advi<U+017F>e you to leave off your de<U+017F>igne, and take my word that no humane wit or power
can bring it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, but this way I have told you: It is guarded by two of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t
and mo<U+017F>t fierce Lions that ever any eye beheld, and two of the keene<U+017F>t Unicorns, which
guard the entrance into this Fountaine, whil<U+017F>t the Lions go about to looke for their
prey: As for the Unicornes they fed like Hor<U+017F>es and Deer, upon Gra<U+017F>s and Leaves. But it
is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange, that the<U+017F>e Lions, though of a fierce and keen nature, yet never offer any
harme, but unto <U+017F>uch as offer to enter into this Fountaine; in <U+017F>o much as the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
feare them no more then they doe little Dogges; but if any doe approach neare a
hedge which growes about the Fountaine, you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee the Lions grin with their teeth,
and their eyes <U+017F>parkle; and al<U+017F>o the Unicornes prepare them<U+017F>elves in <U+017F>uch a fearful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture,
as is mo<U+017F>t terrible to behold: There is no thoughts therefore of any force; but in
as much as I know that the Great <hi>Tautates</hi> is no lyer, and that by his Oracle he an<U+017F>wers
you, that one day you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee the Fountaine of Loves Verity; It is very fit methinks,
that we di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e a little upon this <U+017F>ubject; for Oracles are never fal<U+017F>e, but the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them does very often deceive us, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ometimes they mu<U+017F>t be under<U+017F>tood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the naturall word, and <U+017F>ometimes Allegorically: To come therefore to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of this: If one <U+017F>hould take it literally, and according to the word, it might
be thought that the Inchantment of this Fountaine will quickly end, were it not for one
word, which is, <hi>One day,</hi> which methinkes intimates as much, as if it were a thing farre
off: for <U+017F>o we u<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ay, when we wi<U+017F>h for any thing which we long for: And upon
this con<U+017F>ideration I ground, that the Oracle is perhaps to be under<U+017F>tood in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which I thus interpret.</p>
                     <p>The proper quality of the Fountaine of Loves Verity, is to <U+017F>ee whether or no one doe
truly love. Then any thing that can let us <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>ame thing, may upon the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on
be <U+017F>aid in that particular, to be the Fountaine of Loves Verity; that is, working the <U+017F>ame
effects which this Fountaine doth; Now Time, Per<U+017F>everance and Services, may doe the
<U+017F>ame. It followes therefore, that Time, Services, and Per<U+017F>everance, is this Fountaine of
which we <U+017F>peak. And that which induceth me unto this opinion is this word, One
day; For that denotes length of time, which gives occa<U+017F>ions of doing <U+017F>ervice, and gives
lea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>hew per<U+017F>everance. To tell you why the Oracle did Allegorically <U+017F>peak rather
of Forre<U+017F>t in particular, then of the Roman Province, <U+017F>ince time may worke the <U+017F>ame
effects there, as well as here, is a thing which I cannot doe: and yet <U+017F>ince there cannot be
any thing <U+017F>uperfluous or defective in the Oracles which are the words of the Gods; I
thinke this Country was made choice of for two re<U+017F>pects: The one, becau<U+017F>e you <U+017F>hould
be farre from your own Country, where your quality, your bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, your kindred,
friends and acquaintance, may <U+017F>o di<U+017F>turbe you, that the lea<U+017F>t part of this time which
<U+017F>hould be imployed to bring you unto this knowledge, is imployed as the Oracle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
whereas being here free and without any con<U+017F>traint, the whole time is your own.
The other re<U+017F>pect is, and I believe the greater; that heaven would have you <U+017F>ojourne a
while in this Country, to the end that by ob<U+017F>erving the daily conver<U+017F>ation of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<U+017F>hepheards and <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, you may the better come to know the <U+017F>incerity of that
affection which <hi>Alcidon</hi> profe<U+017F><U+017F>eth to you, or el<U+017F>e his fal<U+017F>ity and di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation: For
whitene<U+017F><U+017F>e will be<U+017F>t appeare, when black is oppo<U+017F>ed to it. I conclude therefore, by one
way or other, that the Oracle is to be under<U+017F>tood thus: That you ought to <U+017F>tay for a
time in this Country, as well to <U+017F>ee whether the inchantment will cea<U+017F>e, as to try the truth
of <hi>Alcidons</hi> affection; of which in the interim, I am in very great hopes; for it is to
be thought, that the Gods like good Phy<U+017F>itians, would never apply remedies to di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es
that are incurable; I meane, that had they known the anger of <hi>Daphnide</hi> would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
they would never have propounded this remedy.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <U+017F>age Druid ended his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Daphnide</hi> offered to be going
away, <hi>Adamas</hi> did the like; but <hi>Alcidon</hi> <U+017F>tayed him, be<U+017F>eeching him to make <hi>Daphnide</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:53527:41"/>
<U+017F>it downe againe, that he might in his pre<U+017F>ence import a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome importance.
Then the Druid <U+017F>taying her almo<U+017F>t by force, <hi>Alcidon</hi> began thus.</p>
                     <p>He, Revernd Father, who <U+017F>aid he was cut with the <U+017F>harpe<U+017F>t <U+017F>word, and being asked
what <U+017F>word, an<U+017F>wered, that it was the <U+017F>word of Calumny, does thereby intimate unto
our under<U+017F>tandings, that there is nothing which deeper pierceth the heart and the <U+017F>oule
then it, and which I have very often found to be mo<U+017F>t true in my <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>ince it <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ed
my fortune and this faire one to have it <U+017F>o; and the wounds <U+017F>mart now wor<U+017F>e then ever,
<U+017F>ince <U+017F>he continues her ill opinion of me, and blames me in the pre<U+017F>ence of <U+017F>o reverend a
per<U+017F>on as the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas.</hi> And becau<U+017F>e I know that a charge untrue may pa<U+017F><U+017F>e for
truth, and becau<U+017F>e I had rather die any way then in her ill opinion, I mu<U+017F>t humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech
you, Madam, give me leave to <U+017F>peake the truth in my own defence. Then becau<U+017F>e
the Druid <U+017F>aid it was but rea<U+017F>on, he continued thus:</p>

two dogmaticall opinions: I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he is like unto tho<U+017F>e who look through co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e eyes <U+017F>ee all things to be of the I<U+017F>ame colour: for her minde being
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed either with Love or Ambition, <U+017F>he judges of all things according to tho<U+017F>e Gla<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es;

Alas faire<U+017F>t <hi>Daphnide,</hi> it grieves me to upbraid you thus, and I wi<U+017F>h I could make it fal<U+017F>e
with the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of my blood and life: but you have te<U+017F>tified that it is but, too true, both
by effects and by words: when you commanded me with <U+017F>o many prote<U+017F>tations of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
to court <hi>Clarinta,</hi> what promi<U+017F>es did you then make me? you have heard them,
grave Father; for <U+017F>he has rightly related them, and the rea<U+017F>ons al<U+017F>o why <U+017F>he thought it
requi<U+017F>ite, I <U+017F>hould addre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Clarinta:</hi> I <U+017F>hall onely hint at them, to bring
them into your memory; If I be ruined in the opinion of <hi>Eurick,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, then are you
the <U+017F>ame, becau<U+017F>e our two fortunes are conjunct and in<U+017F>eparable. But what kind of ruine
was it <U+017F>he menaced and meant? onely for<U+017F>ooth, to be bani<U+017F>hed with her from the Court:
If <hi>Clarinta,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, doe pro<U+017F>per in her de<U+017F>ignes, <U+017F>he will bani<U+017F>h us both the Court. Why,
<hi>Daphnide?</hi> Is it <U+017F>uch an intollerable torment, and an utter ruine, to <U+017F>pend the re<U+017F>t of
your dayes with one that loves you beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion? Oh that your language had
been as full of truth as cunning, and that Love had as much power over you as Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
then would you never have enjoyed me to court her, who would have ruined no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in us but this idol Ambition. Nay on the contrary, <U+017F>he would with abundance of
thankes, have been glad of the occa<U+017F>ion of our living together. But I be<U+017F>eech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Sir, ob<U+017F>erve what a fine gilded Pill <U+017F>he gave me to <U+017F>wallow, and what a delicate
cover <U+017F>he had to excu<U+017F>e her <U+017F>etting me away from her. You cannot be ignorant, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
how liberall both Heaven and Nature hath been unto you in all excellent endowments;
If you doe court <hi>Clarinta,</hi> <U+017F>he will be taken with them, which <hi>Eurick</hi> <U+017F>eeing, he will <U+017F>corn
her; and <U+017F>he will give her Selfe, and all her Ambition unto you.</p>
                                 <p>Oh Love, wilt thou not revenge <U+017F>uch poy<U+017F>oning flattery? She would per<U+017F>wade me,
that <hi>Clarinta</hi> would quit that <U+017F>ame Ambition, which cau<U+017F>eth <hi>Daphnide</hi> to reject me, and
give me unto another: but why <U+017F>hould any imagine, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire my <U+017F>eparation from
her? Is it out of any <U+017F>ecret hatred <U+017F>he beares unto me? or becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thinkes me trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome?
No, no, none of the<U+017F>e; but for the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe alleadged. <hi>Eurick,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <U+017F>eeing you Court her, and <U+017F>he entertaining you, he will <U+017F>leight her and retire.
This, this, Father, was the maine end all her candid eloquence did aime at: Thus would
<U+017F>he have <U+017F>hifted me off unto <hi>Clarinta.</hi> Well, <U+017F>he commanded it, and I was all obedience;
but have I not great rea<U+017F>on to complaine, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is not <U+017F>atisfied with thus deceiving me;
but <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o at my returne, accu<U+017F>e me of her own fault? I <U+017F>weare unto you, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
that all the paines you take in Courting her, <U+017F>hall be put upon my accompt, and I will
be your payma<U+017F>ter. Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>Daphnide,</hi> you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peake this, and now blame me for
Courting <hi>Clarinta?</hi> Nay have I not rather rea<U+017F>on to require my wages for doing your

pre<U+017F>ently de<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted, why might it not well be imagined, that then his affection would have
returned: would not this la<U+017F>t fault have beene wor<U+017F>e then the fir<U+017F>t? But faire<U+017F>t <hi>Daphnide,</hi>
if you had a mind that I <U+017F>hould have de<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted, why did not you command me. Could
you imagine that you had not an ab<U+017F>olute power over me, having had formerly <U+017F>o many
<U+017F>ignall te<U+017F>timonies of it. But here comes in a very fine accu<U+017F>ation; As <U+017F>oone as ever <hi>Eurick</hi>
was dead (<U+017F>ayes <U+017F>he) he pre<U+017F>ently leaves his <hi>Clarinta,</hi> and never <U+017F>o much as asking any
pardon, comes to me as impudently, as if he had never devoted him<U+017F>elfe unto another.
What is it thou ever can<U+017F>t doe, unfortunate <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to give a te<U+017F>timony of thy fidelity,
<U+017F>ince that which in all rea<U+017F>on is the greate<U+017F>t evidence of it, is taken for the contrary? I
courted <hi>Clarinta</hi> by command and again<U+017F>t my will: onely as <hi>Daphnide</hi> <U+017F>aid, through
rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>tate, and to the end <hi>Eurick</hi> <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t her: Now can it be thought <U+017F>trange
that when <hi>Euricke</hi> is dead during this counterfeit Court<U+017F>hip, I <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t from it? had
I not done <U+017F>o, it might be thought I had <U+017F>ome other de<U+017F>igne: But <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you ought to
have asked me pardon before you returned to your wonted way of conver<U+017F>ation with me;
Good God, mu<U+017F>t I in lieu of payment and recompence aske pardon? And why Madam
I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>hould <hi>I</hi> aske it? Perhaps you will an<U+017F>wer, becau<U+017F>e you have courted <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinta;</hi>
but I be<U+017F>eech you, did not you command it, and command it with a promi<U+017F>e of
recompence? but perhaps you will <U+017F>ay again, that I continued longer in the <U+017F>ervice than I
<U+017F>hould have done; but why Madam, <U+017F>hould I not have continued longer <U+017F>ince I
expected your commands for it.</p>
                                 <p>May not this <U+017F>ame Que<U+017F>tion be as well asked a Gally-<U+017F>lave, who<U+017F>e will depends upon
anothers? If one <U+017F>hould aske him why he is <U+017F>o long in that Captivity? Has he not more
rea<U+017F>on to aske, why doe they keep me in it <U+017F>o long? You tell me, you are <U+017F>ure I loved <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinta,</hi>
and endeavoured for particular favours: But <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e I did, and that this affection
did di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, can you blame any but your <U+017F>elfe for it; why did you command me to
<U+017F>erve her? Is it not an evident demon<U+017F>tration, that ambition is more predominate in
you than love, and mu<U+017F>t you not needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>ince I obeyed your command <U+017F>o
willingly, Love was more <U+017F>trong in me than your Ambition? For all tho<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons
which you alledged unto me to <U+017F>hift me off from you, was only in favour of this cur<U+017F>ed
ambition: And if the love which you <U+017F>ay I bore unto <hi>Clarinta</hi> was <U+017F>o potent in me,
why did I reject her <U+017F>ervice as <U+017F>oone as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could? Why el<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould I quit
her as <U+017F>oone as ever <hi>Euricke</hi> was dead? Had <hi>Clarinta</hi> treated me wor<U+017F>e than
u<U+017F>uall, had <U+017F>he made any new choice, or had there beene any bad under<U+017F>tanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
her and me, then there had beene <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect my returne unto you; but
<U+017F>ince <U+017F>he never gave me the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hadow of any cau<U+017F>e, what can you thinke could make
me leave her, but onely the inviolable affection which I <U+017F>till pre<U+017F>erved for you? But Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
perhaps you may aske why the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who had formerly made <U+017F>o much
affection unto me appeare both before, and during <hi>Euricks</hi> love, even to the hazard of
our Fortune and reputation, <U+017F>hould after the death of this Prince, thus change her mind

accompli<U+017F>hed every way, and <U+017F>o full of judgment, <U+017F>hould alter her humour without <U+017F>ome
occa<U+017F>ion. No Sir, but will you <U+017F>ee her rea<U+017F>on for it out of her owne words: Tis true,
that at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he loved that Prince onely out of ambition, and as <U+017F>he cals it Rea<U+017F>on of State;
but is it <U+017F>trange a finger <U+017F>hould be burned if It be held in the flame; nay it were rather a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
if it <U+017F>hould not, for that were again<U+017F>t Nature.</p>
                                 <p>The great <hi>Eurick</hi> was doubtele<U+017F><U+017F>e a Prince <U+017F>o fully adorned with all accompli<U+017F>hed blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<U+017F>hments
that allure Love, as the faire one was by degrees caught before <U+017F>he was aware,
and in lieu of loving him, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he loved him as he de<U+017F>erved: And to make this
truth evident, doe but ob<U+017F>erve how <U+017F>adly <U+017F>he has re<U+017F>ented his lo<U+017F><U+017F>e even unto this day;
who can doubt but that the<U+017F>e are effects and certain con<U+017F>equents of a mo<U+017F>t reall and ardent
affection? I cannot relate the <U+017F>everall <U+017F>ad re<U+017F>entments <U+017F>he has expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed of his death, for
they will but open my wounds the wider: But I am <U+017F>ure, <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas,</hi> that you would
judge them full of extreame affection, and the bad entertainment which I have received
from her proceeds from no other cau<U+017F>e, but from her love unto this Prince; and as an
umbrage of it <U+017F>he would <U+017F>et that fault upon my <U+017F>core, which <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould doe upon the great
<hi>Euricks</hi> and my misfortunes. But faire<U+017F>t <hi>Daphnide,</hi> though you have loved him, not as
you <U+017F>ay, in rea<U+017F>on of State, but in good earne<U+017F>t, yet again<U+017F>t whom doe you thinke you
have offended? Not again<U+017F>t one who has not love enough to pardon, to forget, my even
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53527:42"/>
to quite era<U+017F><U+017F>e the offence; but it again<U+017F>t <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who you know adores you; he is
ready to give you his life, and his <U+017F>oule, and not to upbraid you with the injury. Why
doe you not put forth your hand unto him, and by that action of kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>ignifie, that
none but the great <hi>Eurick</hi> could ever interpo<U+017F>e betwixt you and him. It is no meane
glory unto me, that <U+017F>he whom I love <U+017F>hould have beene adored by the greate<U+017F>t Prince in
the whole Univer<U+017F>e; nor will it be a little <U+017F>atisfaction unto the Gho<U+017F>t of that great Prince,
you <U+017F>horld love <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who indeed did yeild unto him in Fortune, but excelled him
in love.</p>
                                 <p>If I <U+017F>ay any thing which your owne <U+017F>oule knowes not to be mo<U+017F>t true, tax me with a

me doe penance for a fault which you your <U+017F>elfe have committed? Upon this, <hi>Alcidon</hi>
ri<U+017F>ing from his <U+017F>eat, and falling downe upon his knees before the faire <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and
taking her hand: I doe vow and <U+017F>weare, <U+017F>aid he, by this faire hand which is onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ravi<U+017F>h away my heart, that I did never in my life render any homage, but unto her
that owes it, and that it is <U+017F>he alone who has and ever <U+017F>hall have the <U+017F>ole power over me.
Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me and of my fortune as you plea<U+017F>e, and let <hi>Daphnide</hi> be as cruell as <U+017F>he can, yet
<U+017F>till <U+017F>hall <hi>Alcidon</hi> love her for ever. And you reverend Father, <U+017F>aid he, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe
to the Druid; The great <hi>Tautates</hi> hath e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed you a Judge in this Country,
why doe you not condemne this Faire one to give me that heart which <U+017F>he hath <U+017F>o often
given me, and taken away againe? If <U+017F>he doe accu<U+017F>e me for loving any el<U+017F>e, is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould know better than I my <U+017F>elfe? She affirmes I love <hi>Clarinta,</hi> I <U+017F>weare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t
the contrary, why <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he thinke to be beleeved more than I? She <U+017F>ees onely my
outward actions, but I know the intentions of my heart; perhaps <U+017F>he will <U+017F>ay that I
would deceive her, and that <U+017F>he would not deceive me; but why <U+017F>hould I deceive her;
for if I did not love her, I would not care for her affection; and if I doe love her, can
<U+017F>he thinke that he who loves one will deceive her.</p>

<U+017F>aid he, that the Oracle is cleared, and that now is the time to compo<U+017F>e this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
I would to God, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that it could be <U+017F>o compo<U+017F>ed, as that quietne<U+017F><U+017F>e of
mind might be re<U+017F>tored unto <hi>Alcidon</hi> and me, which we have taken from each other; Are
you plea<U+017F>ed Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> that I <U+017F>hould be your Judge: If <hi>Alcidon</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
unto it, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, and if he will <U+017F>tand unto what you <U+017F>hall doome, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be again<U+017F>t any thing which you <U+017F>hall deeme fit. I doe prote<U+017F>t by all that is <U+017F>acred, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Alcidon,</hi> that there is nothing in the World which can keepe me from loving and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
you; and I <U+017F>weare that I will <U+017F>o farre <U+017F>tand unto the doome of wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas,</hi> that if
he doe <U+017F>entence the contrary, I will <U+017F>o farre obey it, as that you <U+017F>hall never be troubled
with me; and if I faile in this Oath, may all the Elements he my confu<U+017F>ion. Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas,</hi>
with the gravity of a reverend old Judge, began in a Maje<U+017F>ticall manner to <U+017F>peak
thus: Tell me, Madam, <U+017F>aid he, did you ever love <hi>Alcidon</hi> well. Above my life, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<U+017F>he; and doe you now hate him, replyed he: I hate his levity and incon<U+017F>tancy,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, but not him: But <U+017F>ay he be not incon<U+017F>tant replyed he, nor ever loved any but
you, would you then love him <U+017F>till, and be <U+017F>orry for charging him wrongfully? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e
I <U+017F>hould, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he: Can you charge him with any other incon<U+017F>tancy, continued the
Druid, but in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Clarinta?</hi> Is not that enough, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Daphnide?</hi> But
when he fir<U+017F>t went about to <U+017F>erve <hi>Clarinta,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> was it not by your command,
and did he not undertake it again<U+017F>t his will? I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that in this
I was unwi<U+017F>e, and he adi<U+017F><U+017F>embler; But had he made a retreate, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
clo<U+017F>ed with <hi>Clarinta</hi> againe, would you not then have blamed <hi>Alcidon</hi> for di<U+017F>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Commandement? I thinke I <U+017F>hould, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he. Hear then your dooms oh
<hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Druid; The great <hi>Tautates</hi> who made the whole world
by Love, and by Love pre<U+017F>erves it, would not onely have things in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, <U+017F>hould be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
and linked together by the bonds of Love, but things al<U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and rationall.</p>
                     <p>From hence it is that he hath given unto the in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Elements, qualities which linke
them together by <U+017F>ympathy: Unto Animals he hath given love and de<U+017F>ire to perpetuate
their kind, and unto men rea<U+017F>on, which teacheth them to love God in his Creatures, and
the Creatures in God. Now this Rea<U+017F>on tels us that what<U+017F>oever is amiable ought to be
loved, according to the degrees of its goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e; and <U+017F>o, what<U+017F>oever is mo<U+017F>t amiable,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53527:43"/>
and has mo<U+017F>t goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e, ought to be mo<U+017F>t loved. Yet in as much, as we are not obliged
unto this love, untill this goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e be known unto us; it followes by con<U+017F>equence, that
themore any good is known, the more it ought to be loved: But <U+017F>ince God hath made
every thing by love, and that the end of every thing is alwayes mo<U+017F>t perfect, we may
ea<U+017F>ily judge, that <U+017F>ince all good things have Love for their end, Love is the be<U+017F>t of all
things. Now knowing this goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of love, we are obliged by the Lawes of Rea<U+017F>on to
e<U+017F>teem it above all things; and the more it is known, the more we ought to e<U+017F>teem it.
The Oracle which was given you, for compo<U+017F>ing your difference, makes good what I
<U+017F>ay: For it is this,
<q>
                           <l>Upon a day, you'l <U+017F>ee</l>
                           <l>A Fountaine, in Forre<U+017F>t</l>

                           <l>Will <U+017F>et your hearts at re<U+017F>t.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>That is, In Forre<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hall come to know, that you doe really love each other, and
then your hearts will be <U+017F>et at re<U+017F>t: for the Great <hi>Tautates,</hi> who gave this Oracle unto
you, knowing how religiou<U+017F>ly you payed what was due both unto Him and Rea<U+017F>on, did
al<U+017F>o know that as <U+017F>oon as you were a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of each others affection, you would pre<U+017F>ently
thinke it mo<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>onable, to love according to your merits: And therefore <hi>Daphnide,</hi>
<U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ee, that <hi>Alcidon</hi> does love you, (for why <U+017F>hould he <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire your
love, if he did not truly love you?) And you <hi>Alcidon,</hi> <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ee the love of <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
towards you (for why <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he be je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lous of you and <hi>Clarinta,</hi> unle<U+017F><U+017F>e her love
were the Mother of her jealou<U+017F>ie?) I doe Ordaine, or rather, the Great <hi>Tautates</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
you, that forgetting all pa<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and without any <U+017F>tay to <U+017F>ee any other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of Loves Verity, you doe pre<U+017F>ently unite your affections, and revive your ancient
loves of each other; make it appeare that none loves better then you two, for none have
more cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince heaven hath infu<U+017F>ed it into both.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, <hi>Adamas</hi> took both their hands, and joyning them together, <U+017F>aid, May this
union be happy, and eternall. It is a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e the joyes of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> or
the thanks he gave unto the great Druid, but e<U+017F>pecially unto <hi>Daphnide: Stiliana,</hi> and
<hi>Carlis,</hi> and <hi>Hermantes,</hi> rejoyed for <hi>Alcidons</hi> <U+017F>ake; for where ever he came, he had the
happine<U+017F><U+017F>e to get all mens love.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the di<U+017F>pute betwixt <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> compo<U+017F>ed by the prudence of
the <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas.</hi> Although he conceived the meaning of the Oracle to be, That their
jealou<U+017F>ies of each other <U+017F>hould vani<U+017F>h by a <U+017F>ight of this Fountaine; yet like a per<U+017F>on of

and more <U+017F>utable to their will in reconciling them, he thought it fit to expound the
Oracle in this manner, and al<U+017F>o to advi<U+017F>e them, to <U+017F>tay in this Country a while, to the
end that if any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions yet remained in them, and that if it plea<U+017F>ed the Heavens to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charme

                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e things pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed thus in the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Adamas,</hi> the <U+017F>hepheards and <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>es,
who were in the Great Chamber with <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> as <U+017F>oone as the
Collation was ended, did fall into their <U+017F>everall di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es where they left. But <hi>Alexis</hi>
and <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> for feare of being interrupted, did take each other by the arm, and walked to
the other end of the Chamber, which made well for <hi>Alexis,</hi> for by moving, <U+017F>he might
the better hide the alterations in her face and better excu<U+017F>e her di<U+017F>orderd language. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea</hi>

walking, as well becau<U+017F>e none could heare them, as becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he might with more freedom
expre<U+017F><U+017F>e the affection which <U+017F>he bore unto her. After therefore they had walked two or
three turns, neither of them knowing well how to begin di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> broke <U+017F>ilence
thus,</p>
                     <p>I <U+017F>hall as long as I live, Madam, ob<U+017F>erve this day as a Holiday, in memory of the high

my mo<U+017F>t zealous de<U+017F>ires of doing you <U+017F>ervice. The <U+017F>acred Mis<U+017F>letoe which it hath
plea<U+017F>ed the Great <hi>Tautates</hi> to make grow in our Hamlet this yeare, was an Omen of the
happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which we were to receive by your coming into this place; <U+017F>hewing thereby,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53527:43"/>
that the liberall hand of the great God, where it be<U+017F>towes one favour, does accompany it
with many others. The happine<U+017F><U+017F>e and good fortune of it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> is all on my
<U+017F>ide, in coming hither at <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, when this <U+017F>acred Mis<U+017F>letoe is to be gathered; for
that is the cau<U+017F>e of my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e in <U+017F>eeing you, it being one of my greate<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ires. How,
Madam? <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> doe you thinke it your happine<U+017F><U+017F>e in wronging us all, and me in
particular, by thinking we came hither onely becau<U+017F>e of this <U+017F>acred Mis<U+017F>letoe? I will
thinke, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> as you plea<U+017F>e; but give me leave to <U+017F>ay, that it is at this time the
cau<U+017F>e of my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e in <U+017F>eeing you; and though I had not been here, yet you would
have come to invite <hi>Adamas</hi> unto the <U+017F>acrifice of Thanks. I doe mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly prote<U+017F>t,
Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that it is your <U+017F>elfe onely which invited me to come hither; for I
never in my life had a more earne<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire of any thing, than of <U+017F>eeing of you; be<U+017F>eeching
you to believe, that it is not my humour to meddle with any publique matters, but I leave
them unto our wi<U+017F>er Pa<U+017F>tors, who takes the cure of them according to their cu<U+017F>tome, and
according as they thinke mo<U+017F>t advantagious for this Country. I <U+017F>hould be very proud of
my <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> if I could be per<U+017F>waded of it; for it is a thing which I mo<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>h,
and pri<U+017F>e above any happine<U+017F><U+017F>e that ever happened unto me. But pray tell me, fair <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
in what place is this Mis<U+017F>letoe found? If the Sun would permit you to looke
out of the window, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I <U+017F>hould let you <U+017F>ee it from hence. I believe, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Alexis,</hi> that the Mountain does interpo<U+017F>e, if it be on that <U+017F>ide; but if it do not, I believe the
heat of the day being over, we may enjoy the plea<U+017F>ant pro<U+017F>pect of all that plaine: upon
this, opening the Window, and both looking out; after they had looked about every
way, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> began thus.</p>
                     <p>Doe you <U+017F>ee, Madam, the cou<U+017F>e of that River which runs by the walles of <hi>Boen,</hi> as
if it did cut that plain almo<U+017F>t in the middle, and empties it <U+017F>elfe into the lap of <hi>Loire;</hi>
that is the fatall and defamed River <hi>Lignon,</hi> upon which you may perceive our Hamlet
to be <U+017F>eated, oppo<U+017F>ite unto mount <hi>Verdan,</hi> which is a little Mountaine in forme of a
pointed Diamond, in the middle of the plaine, and which lookes like a Rock in the Sea.
If you plea<U+017F>e to ca<U+017F>t your eye a little upon the left hand, you may <U+017F>ee the Temple of the
good Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e, a little round Temple under which runs an arme of that dete<U+017F>table <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
and a little beyond that, following <U+017F>till that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ravinous River, you may e<U+017F>pie a little
wood, and it is there where the happy Oak grows which this year bears the <U+017F>acred Mis<U+017F>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe.
And truly it is worthy ob<U+017F>ervance, That, there, is the form of a Temple made out of
little Trees, pleached together mo<U+017F>t artificially. None knowes who made it, nor the time
when it was <U+017F>o contrived; and yet it is <U+017F>o well ordered and contrived, as who<U+017F>oever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iders
it, mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e him that did it a mo<U+017F>t admirable Arti<U+017F>t. We almo<U+017F>t all think,
it was the worke either of <hi>Pan,</hi> or <hi>Egipan,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other Rurall God; for <U+017F>uch exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ite
inventions when the Author is unknown, are commonly attributed unto <U+017F>ome Deity.
<hi>Alexis</hi> feemed to wonder at all this, and the better to colour her di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, <U+017F>eemed as
if <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>ee this place which was <U+017F>hewed unto her, though none knew it better
then her <U+017F>elfe but <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> pulling her a little nearer, and holding out her hand to direct
<hi>Alexis</hi> unto the place where this Temple was: Doe you <U+017F>ee, Madam (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her)
that wood which growes almo<U+017F>t clo<U+017F>e upon the banke of the River? Ca<U+017F>t your eye a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
upon the left hand and you may <U+017F>ee a little Meadow greener then all the re<U+017F>t; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of it is, becau<U+017F>e the gra<U+017F>s of it is not <U+017F>oyled, nor any Cattel driven into it, becau<U+017F>e it
hath been long <U+017F>ince dedicated unto <U+017F>ome Deity, as well as that little tuft of Trees which
joynes upon it. Now this little <U+017F>acred Meadow, <U+017F>eems as if it had been con<U+017F>ecrated as the
Court belonging unto that artificiall Temple, which <U+017F>tands among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e Trees I think,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that I doe <U+017F>ee the place you meane, and I doe ob<U+017F>erve one tree much higher
then all the re<U+017F>t: Right, right, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that is the Tree which <U+017F>upports the Temple,
and to its fame, has this yeare the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e to beare the <U+017F>acred Mis<U+017F>letoe, for which we
ought to offer a <U+017F>acrifice of Thanks. Had I <U+017F>o much wit as to relate all the rarities there,
and the Art wherewith it is made, I am <U+017F>ure you would admire them: Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t,
I ob<U+017F>erved the Picture of the Goode<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> (for the Temple is dedicated unto her) much
different from tho<U+017F>e by which they u<U+017F>e to repre<U+017F>ent her unto us: She is pourtrayed in the
habit of a <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, with a <U+017F>heep-hook in her hand, and her flock about her: and
which is mo<U+017F>t admirable, all that <U+017F>ee it, <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>he re<U+017F>embles me. <hi>Alexis</hi> could not
chu<U+017F>e but blu<U+017F>h at this, and it was happy for her none <U+017F>tood by; for it had been an ea<U+017F>ie
matter to <U+017F>ee what alterations were in her face, and fearing le<U+017F>t if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>hould acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53527:44"/>
looke towards her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould perceive it, <U+017F>he leaned upon her elbow in the win<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dow,
and covered her face with her hand, and to give her no lei<U+017F>ure to looke upon her
I beleeve faire Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that he who drew the picture of that Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e in that
manner, did it with much rea<U+017F>on: For <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who is the godde<U+017F><U+017F>e of Ju<U+017F>tice, cannot
be better repre<U+017F>ented, than by a <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e with her <U+017F>heephooke and her flocke; both
to <U+017F>hew that in places mo<U+017F>t retired and rurall, the innocent and weake are by her kept in
<U+017F>afety, and to <U+017F>hew that by the meanes of Ju<U+017F>tice, peaee and abundance is maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
men, which are two things which cannot be better repre<U+017F>ented, than by <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>es
and their flocks. But I doe thinke him much more judicious in giving your,
fair face unto that godde<U+017F><U+017F>e: For how could he po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly make choice of a better being
to repre<U+017F>ent a Diety, than in taking for his patterne, the mo<U+017F>t perfect that ever Nature
<U+017F>hewed unto us? And <U+017F>uch is your beauty, that I beleeve if that godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> would
looke upon this picture <U+017F>he will be prouder of your features, than of her owne and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be <U+017F>uch a one as you are on the Earth than as her <U+017F>elfe is in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e Prai<U+017F>es, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and blu<U+017F>ht, are much too high for one <U+017F>o full of misfortunes
as my <U+017F>elfe; e<U+017F>pecially coming from you Madam, unto whom they are much more due;
but <U+017F>uch as I am. I am mo<U+017F>t devoutly yours, <U+017F>o as you may di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me as you plea<U+017F>e,
and <U+017F>peake of me likewi<U+017F>e: For I profe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I have no higher ambition than to merit
the title of your mo<U+017F>t devoted <U+017F>ervant. Faire <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) would you have

the Combate. As the generous Lyon, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> contemnes all creatures that are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours
in <U+017F>trength; <U+017F>o doe I you, <hi>Silvander,</hi> being <U+017F>o much my inferiour both in wit,
and goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of cau<U+017F>e; thus they began to <U+017F>ing, one for, and the other again<U+017F>t
incon<U+017F>tancy.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>hepherds were thus <U+017F>inging, and the re<U+017F>t of the Company attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<U+017F>uch a plea<U+017F>ant humour (<U+017F>aid he unto her in a low voice) as this of <hi>Hylas?</hi> I thinke (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e) that he is like all other men, onely he is a little more free and
open in uttering his thoughts than others are. Oh Madam, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> have you <U+017F>uch
a bad opinion of men, and thinke them all as incon<U+017F>tant as he is? I have no bad opinion
of men, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> and <U+017F>miled) for I cannot thinke it an errour in them to doe as
<hi>Hylas</hi> doth, <U+017F>ince it is a thing very naturall, to love where we like be<U+017F>t: And <U+017F>ince mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>hepherds doe love onely to plea<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves, have I not good cau<U+017F>e to thinke that where
they find mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ure, there they will without any difficulty love, imitating in this
our <U+017F>heep, who u<U+017F>e not to eat alwayes of the <U+017F>ame gra<U+017F><U+017F>e, nor feed only in one Pa<U+017F>ture, but
loving variety, graze <U+017F>ometimes in the Meadowes, other times upon Hils, and <U+017F>ometimes
again under Shades: The <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e as <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke this, <U+017F>miled, to <U+017F>hew <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke again<U+017F>t
her con<U+017F>cience, and <hi>Paris</hi> taking notice of it, an<U+017F>wered thus: <hi>Hylas</hi> would be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in his opinion, faire<U+017F>t <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, if he heard you; but I beleeve if you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to follow this opinion, it would be <U+017F>omewhat difficult to make you con<U+017F>ent unto
it. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that what you <U+017F>ay is true, for <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es are not <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto the <U+017F>ame Laws which <U+017F>hepherds are; for they doe not only fly incon<U+017F>tancy, but
con<U+017F>tancy al<U+017F>o. This is too enigmaticall for me to under<U+017F>tand, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> unle<U+017F><U+017F>e Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t

the Virgins of this Country, doe not only fly incon<U+017F>tancy, becau<U+017F>e they are not of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering

of amity, loving and e<U+017F>teeming all that de<U+017F>erve it, not with love and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but according

                     <p>I doe beleeve it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Paris</hi> faintly: but for <U+017F>ome intere<U+017F>t which I may have I wi<U+017F>h
that one among<U+017F>t them were of another humor. Generous <hi>Paris,</hi> replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> you
mu<U+017F>t needs pardon their dull capacities: for being brought up, in rurall and halfe <U+017F>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage

there is very few in all this company, who would not more contentedly chu<U+017F>e to live
with their flockes upon the bankes of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and under their homely roofes, than in
princely Pallaces, and civilized Cities. I be<U+017F>eech you faire<U+017F>t <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris,</hi> what

I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hew my <U+017F>elfe of a very weake judgment, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> if I did not
thinke it very noble, and very plea<U+017F>ant. Much more noble and plea<U+017F>ant would it be, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Paris,</hi> if what is now in it, would be alwayes in it. Tis true, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> for <U+017F>o
many faire <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es and han<U+017F>ome <U+017F>hepherds, doe not onely make the company very
great, but al<U+017F>o the place very plea<U+017F>ant. It is not the quantity, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> but the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of per<U+017F>ons which makes me e<U+017F>teem it: I am of your beliefe, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he; for mo<U+017F>t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

will not under<U+017F>tand my meaning; for it is not of all the company which I <U+017F>peake, but it
is, faire<U+017F>t <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e of one only, without which one, all the re<U+017F>t of the company would

                        <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Hylas</hi> had now done <U+017F>inging, and there was not a word among<U+017F>t all

I beleeve Servant (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that you <U+017F>peake like a very knowing man. Tis true
(<U+017F>aid he) I have not been <U+017F>o long Apprentice, but I have learned my Trade; For before I
loved <hi>Phillis,</hi> I thought <hi>Laonice</hi> faire, and before her, <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and before them both,
<hi>Cri<U+017F>ide:</hi> Here is three <U+017F>trangers, <U+017F>aid he, pointing at <hi>Florice, Palanice,</hi> and <hi>Circenea,</hi>

Gallery with <hi>Daphnide</hi> were here, <U+017F>he could tell you how <U+017F>he was the fir<U+017F>t who taught

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53527:45"/>
you hold her for your la<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, as you did for your fir<U+017F>t: for I have heard you <U+017F>ay,
that you have loved but as many as you have met. Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, you <U+017F>hould have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as many faire ones, as I have met: for I doe confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that where<U+017F>oever my eye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
beauty, I was a lover and <U+017F>ervant of it; and methinks you <U+017F>hould like my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
very well, <U+017F>ince it hath made me yours; and without which, ill-favoured <hi>Carlis</hi> had

                     <p>I like your humour extreamly well, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> did I not feare that as it is now
the cau<U+017F>e of your being mine, <U+017F>o it will hereafter make me grieve for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of you.
Oh faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you not to thinke any <U+017F>uch thing; for be<U+017F>ides
your offence unto my love, it is mo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible any <U+017F>uch thing <U+017F>hould ever be; for I never
loved any thing but beauty, and out of you it is mo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to find it. I <U+017F>hould be
very glad, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> to have you continue long in this opinion of me, that I may
not lo<U+017F>e as others have; but I had rather that all your per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions could make me believe
all you <U+017F>ay of me to be true. I need no per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions, an<U+017F>wered he, where every eye is able
to te<U+017F>tifie. If all did <U+017F>ee me with your eyes, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> their te<U+017F>timonies might
perhaps be favourable unto me. I am certaine, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> that there is none here,
will give my eyes the lie. Your eyes indeed may <U+017F>ee things as they are, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi>
but your mouth may perhaps be given a little to Hyperbolize, and your tongue which
is <U+017F>o glib in attributing unto me, more then is my due, does te<U+017F>tifie that you have learned
in more Schools then one. I doe confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> but withall I am able, and
without vanity to <U+017F>peak it, that the Schollar, <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the Ma<U+017F>ter. You never told me
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Florice</hi>) that when you were my Schollar, you learned your le<U+017F><U+017F>on of <hi>Circenea,</hi>
and <hi>Palinice</hi> al<U+017F>o. And had we all three united our learning together, we might have
kept you longer at School. How <U+017F>ervant, replyed <hi>Alexis,</hi> what? <U+017F>erve three at one time?
You may judge by that Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my courage, and whether
I doe not <U+017F>erve you mo<U+017F>t devoutly, <U+017F>ince I attempt none but you alone.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t he was talking thus, <hi>Adamas, Daphnide,</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> came out of the Gallery,

the table was furni<U+017F>hed, and with <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>o many delicacies, as <hi>Daphnide</hi> admired that

ob<U+017F>erved by the eyes of mo<U+017F>t in the company, that it was bed-time; and therefore he
invited <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> unto their re<U+017F>t, waiting upon them to their Chambers, and
leaving <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> to carry the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es and <U+017F>hepheards into theirs:
but though the night was farre <U+017F>pent, yet <hi>Alexis</hi> having carried <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Phillis,</hi> and
<hi>Diana</hi> into their Chambers, <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon part from them; but, after a hundred
good nights, <U+017F>till <U+017F>he had <U+017F>omething to <U+017F>ay: At la<U+017F>t, <hi>Leonide</hi> having lodged all the re<U+017F>t,
came into the Chamber, and hearing the clock <U+017F>trike midnight, <U+017F>he con<U+017F>trained her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
The three <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es being now alone, although there was <U+017F>everall beds in the
Chamber, yet would they needs lie all together.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t they were addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> could not for her life talke of any thing
el<U+017F>e but <hi>Alexis.</hi> Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> was ever two faces <U+017F>o full of re<U+017F>emblance,
as this of the faire <hi>Alexis,</hi> and that of poor <hi>Celadon?</hi> For my part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in my life <U+017F>aw two more like. Nay more, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> did you ever <U+017F>ee any Gla<U+017F>s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ent
a nearer <U+017F>imilitude, betwixt the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and the reflection? Nay <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea,</hi>
what would you <U+017F>ay if you had <U+017F>poken with her in particular as I did? her voyce,
her pronunciation, her aire, her actions, her <U+017F>miles, nay every little feature are <U+017F>o re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blant,
as if <hi>Celadon</hi> were by her, I could finde no difference; and the more I con<U+017F>ider
it, the more I am ravi<U+017F>hed with admiration. I wi<U+017F>h with all my heart, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi>
we could per<U+017F>wade <hi>Adamas</hi> to let her <U+017F>tay among<U+017F>t us for a time; and if we could, <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter,
I believe you would be well contented. Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> for I can
truly <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>ince the death of poor <hi>Celadon,</hi> I never enjoyed any plea<U+017F>ure but in the
<U+017F>ight of <hi>Alexis.</hi> But alas, there is no hopes that <hi>Adamas</hi> will ever <U+017F>uffer her to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, for <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o dear unto him, as he cannot <U+017F>uffer her to be out of his <U+017F>ight, nor would
it be plea<U+017F>ing unto her, being accu<U+017F>tomed unto another kind of life: And fortune is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<U+017F>o little my friend, as I cannot thinke <U+017F>he will ever doe me <U+017F>o great a kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter,
replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> If you de<U+017F>ire that this faire one <U+017F>hould come into our Hamlet, we
mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e a little cunning; <U+017F>ometimes one <U+017F>hall bring that to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e by <U+017F>ubtilty, which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53527:46"/>
would be denyed; if it were openly asked; and <U+017F>uch kind of policy is not blameable when
it will not hurt any one. Should we aske this favour of the Druid, perhaps his civility
would be <U+017F>o great as not to deny it; and perhaps al<U+017F>o, he would alleadge <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as we <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>peed: but let us goe another way to worke; let us entreat
him, and let all the company do the like, that he would be plea<U+017F>ed not to retard the <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of thanks for the <U+017F>acred Mis<U+017F>letoe: he hath already promi<U+017F>ed as much unto other
<U+017F>hepheards, who came with the <U+017F>ame Petition: If we bring him to that pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, as to come
pre<U+017F>ently with us, I am confident he will bring <hi>Alexis</hi> with him, as well becau<U+017F>e <hi>Leonide</hi>
will come, as to accompany <hi>Daphnide,</hi> whom we mu<U+017F>t entreat to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t us in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e:
Be<U+017F>ides, the <U+017F>acrifice being a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of great and religious <U+017F>olemnity; and <hi>Alexis</hi> being
a Druid, it is not likely <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be left at home. Yet to be every way prepared; if it
happen <U+017F>o that <hi>Adamas</hi> do make any difficulty in it, we mu<U+017F>t intreat both her and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
good will unto it; for I do percieve that <U+017F>he is not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed to be in our company;
and yet truly con<U+017F>idering the difference in education, perhaps <U+017F>he does onely con<U+017F>train her
<U+017F>elf out of civility to be <U+017F>o complai<U+017F>ant unto us in her Fathers hou<U+017F>e. But for all that, I
am fully per<U+017F>waded, if we could once get her into our Hamlet, we three <U+017F>hould keep her
in it, by endeavouring to plea<U+017F>e her in <U+017F>uch things as <U+017F>he takes mo<U+017F>t delight in; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
when <U+017F>he <U+017F>ees the hone<U+017F>t innocency of our lives, <U+017F>he will not thinke it much di<U+017F>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to her humour Truly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and <U+017F>hook her head, <U+017F>he is of a <U+017F>trange tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
if we did di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her; but I lay my life, that we <U+017F>hall all cry when <U+017F>he is con<U+017F>train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to leave us, and therefore we had as good let it alone <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> hearing this, <U+017F>aid unto
her; Si<U+017F>ter, if you take any delight in my company, let us procure her to be among<U+017F>t us,
for otherwi<U+017F>e I am but a meer lo<U+017F>t woman. But will you know what I fore<U+017F>ee? (<U+017F>aid
<hi>Phillis</hi>) I make no que<U+017F>tion but we <U+017F>hall get her among<U+017F>t us, by the meanes which <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
hath propo<U+017F>ed; nor doe I feare but <hi>Alexis</hi> will be well plea<U+017F>ed with us, if I doe but
take the paines to humour her; but I plainly <U+017F>ee that when <U+017F>he comes, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> will quite
leave us, and make no more reckoning of us then as meer <U+017F>trangers. And therefore I will
tell you what we will doe if that happen: This <hi>Alexis</hi> will not <U+017F>tay alwayes with us,
but will one day return either to <hi>Dreux</hi> or to <hi>Carnutes,</hi> and then we will make no more
reckoning of her, then <U+017F>he does of us. Fie, fie, Si<U+017F>ter replyed <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I cannot abide you
<U+017F>hould bring this <U+017F>ad <U+017F>eparation into memory; for Gods <U+017F>ake, let us not bring on a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ery
by the thought of it, which will come but too <U+017F>oon of it <U+017F>elfe. No, no, replyed <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
let us lay a<U+017F>ide all <U+017F>uch Cogitations, and doe what our amity commands us: <U+017F>ince
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> has no contentment but in this, let us doe all we can to continue it to her: And
though <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould doe as you <U+017F>ay, yet if we doe love her, we <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>orry for her, <U+017F>ince
all things are common among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e that love one another and loving her as we do, why
<U+017F>hould we not <U+017F>hare with her in the contenment which <U+017F>he receives?</p>
                     <p>With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es got to bed, and after good nights un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one another, they fell a<U+017F>leep in this re<U+017F>olution which they had fixed upon. But on the
other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Alexis</hi> being retired into her Chamber, and <hi>Leonide</hi> with her, <hi>Adamas</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
pre<U+017F>ently after them, who having brought <hi>Alcidon</hi> and the old Pa<U+017F>tors into their
Chambers, leaving the care of the re<U+017F>t unto <hi>Paris;</hi> He came unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> to know what

I cannot tell how he does; but as for <hi>Alexis,</hi> let me prote<U+017F>t unto you, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ayes that <U+017F>he
never in her life had more contentment <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was your Daughter. I am glad on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, <U+017F>ayes
<hi>Adamas,</hi> <U+017F>o it continue. But tell me truly, <hi>Celadon,</hi> Doe you now repent of your believing
me? It is a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepheard, that any <U+017F>hould repent following
your coun<U+017F>ell. For all you give is good, But let me tell you Father, that this which I
have received from you upon this occa<U+017F>ion, is full of danger unto me; for if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>hould
come to know me. I prote<U+017F>t there is nothing under the Sun could keep me alive; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
the ju<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion which I <U+017F>hould give her to blame me, for di<U+017F>obeying her command,
I <U+017F>hould grieve <U+017F>o exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively for failing in my duty, as it would <U+017F>uffice to take away my
life; or if it did not, I would court all inventions in the world to give me a <U+017F>uddaine and
cruell death. Well, well, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> I perceive your condition is not yet in a fit tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to take tho<U+017F>e remedies which I would give you, we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>tay till time has a little

not to di<U+017F>obey any thing I <U+017F>hall command, for otherwi<U+017F>e you will give me occa<U+017F>ion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53527:46"/>
to tax you with ingratitude. Father, <U+017F>aid <hi>Celadon,</hi> I will never faile in my obedience to
you, provided your commands do not contradict tho<U+017F>e which I have already received,
which is mo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould not ob<U+017F>erve: I will never advi<U+017F>e you (<U+017F>aid the Druid)
again<U+017F>t what you <U+017F>ay: But let me tell you, that the patient mu<U+017F>t not think, he knows
what Phy<U+017F>ick is better again<U+017F>t his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, then the Phy<U+017F>itian doth.</p>
                     <p>To morrow, I will go in the company of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepheards and <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, to offer
the <U+017F>acrifice of thankes for the <U+017F>alubrious Mis<U+017F>letoe which is found in their Hamlet; and
as it fortunes, under the very <U+017F>ame Oak where you made the Temple of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> which
let me tell you, is an Onch of very good fortune to you. And becau<U+017F>e I mu<U+017F>t according
to cu<U+017F>tome, carry <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> with me, it is requi<U+017F>ite I <U+017F>hould carry you al<U+017F>o. Oh
Father, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alcidon</hi>) what do you mean? into how much danger would you bring
both me, and your <U+017F>elfe al<U+017F>o? Since it hath plea<U+017F>ed good <hi>Tharamis</hi> to give me the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
of <U+017F>eeing this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, of talking with her, and yet not to be known by
any in the company; doe not put me and your<U+017F>elfe unto any further hazard: what a
wound would it be unto your un<U+017F>tained reputation, if it <U+017F>hould come to be di<U+017F>covered?
and to me it would be mo<U+017F>t certaine death. Let us thank the God for the favour he hath
done us; and let me rather retire into <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>art, where I may end my mi<U+017F>erable dayes.
I <U+017F>ee, replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> that you are to begin again your fir<U+017F>t le<U+017F><U+017F>on: That God whom
you name, hath commanded me to have a particular care of you, and I mu<U+017F>t be obedient.
For, Child, you mu<U+017F>t know, that he never commands any thing, but what is ju<U+017F>t and
laudable: and though humane ignorance does <U+017F>ometimes thinke the contrary, yet in the
end we <U+017F>ee, that he who keeps clo<U+017F>e unto his Ordinances, does <U+017F>urmount all difficulties,
and clear all tho<U+017F>e triviall doubts which may ob<U+017F>cure the glory of his actions. Therefore,
never trouble your <U+017F>elfe with any thing that relates unto me, no nor what returnes unto
your <U+017F>elfe; for <hi>Thamires</hi> never undertakes a thing, which he does not bring unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
end: It is he, who by me does that which you <U+017F>ee me doe for your good, having
commanded me by his Oracle. Doubt not therefore, but that both You and I <U+017F>hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
contentment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celadon</hi> would have replyed: bnt <hi>Leonide</hi> interrupted him, <U+017F>aying, You may <U+017F>ee,
<U+017F>hepheard, that oftentimes one will do tho<U+017F>e things for another, which he would not doe
for him<U+017F>elfe: If <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>hould leave you at home, and carry with him <hi>Paris</hi> and me,
what would be thought of you? what <U+017F>trange opinions would there be, if you who goes
under the notion of Druid, <U+017F>hould not come unto a <U+017F>acrifice of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>olemnitie; <U+017F>ince
you have gone <U+017F>o far, you mu<U+017F>t go farther; and <U+017F>ince <hi>Tautates</hi> hath committed you unto
the tuitiod of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and you your <U+017F>elfe confented to it, you cannot make a retreat
without offence both again<U+017F>t that God, and <hi>Adamas</hi> al<U+017F>o. You mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>hut your eyes again<U+017F>t
all con<U+017F>iderations what<U+017F>oever, and <U+017F>ubmit your <U+017F>elfe wholly unto his prudence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>haked his head at this: Father, <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>ince the Gods have commanded it,
and <U+017F>ince you are plea<U+017F>ed to take it upon you, I refer my <U+017F>elfe, my life, and all my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unto you. Upon this, the Druid embraced him, and taking <hi>Leonide</hi> by the hand,
left him to his re<U+017F>t. But his thoughts would not permit him to take any, for all the night
long his minde ran upon the <U+017F>weet di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and he had, and upon every
circum<U+017F>tance, not forgetting a <U+017F>yllable, or the lea<U+017F>t action which gave him any te<U+017F>timony
that <U+017F>till <U+017F>he loved the memory of <hi>Celadou.</hi> And when he had long entertained the<U+017F>e
thoughts, he would gladly have driven them out of his mind, as thinking them contrary
to his pre<U+017F>ent condition.</p>
                     <p>Fie, fie, mi<U+017F>erable <U+017F>hepheard (<U+017F>aid he) why do<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>uffer thy <U+017F>elfe to be flattered up
with the <U+017F>miles of fortune? ha<U+017F>t thou not often found, that <U+017F>he never Cara<U+017F><U+017F>es, but with a
de<U+017F>igne of deceiving? nor rai<U+017F>eth thee up, but that thy fall may be the greater? Con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to what a height of happine<U+017F><U+017F>e thou wert once elevated; remember that never any
<U+017F>hepheard could call him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed as thy <U+017F>elfe: Then turne but thine eye upon the
pre<U+017F>ent condition, and tell me if it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to fall from a <U+017F>teeper Precipice. And now
at this time, when under a <U+017F>hadow thou art taken for another, and under a borrowed
Name much off: Can<U+017F>t thou take the<U+017F>e favours as thine owne? thou do<U+017F>t not con<U+017F>ider
that thou <U+017F>teale<U+017F>t them under the umbrage of anothers Name, and that they would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
unto thine.</p>
                     <p>This con<U+017F>ideration did make all his fir<U+017F>t thoughts <U+017F>o bitter unto him, as he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53527:47"/>
ready to fall into the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>paire as when he lived in his Cave, and he wanted but
a little of re<U+017F>olving to returne into his fir<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ign of <U+017F>eparating him<U+017F>elfe from the World,
<U+017F>ince he <U+017F>aw no hopes of any cure for his mi<U+017F>eries. And probably this re<U+017F>olution had
prompted him to put his de<U+017F>igne in execution, had not <U+017F>ome good Angell brought into his

                     <p>This is a bad opinion which you have of him, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> but you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee that

tho<U+017F>e that did love them, and afterwards did fall off from loving, though they had no
de<U+017F>igne upon them. Nay, I will goe a little further; I never in my life <U+017F>aw any who were

thinke of me as you plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> but I prote<U+017F>t that if it were in my choice whether
he <U+017F>hould continue, or give over his addre<U+017F><U+017F>e unto me, I doe fore<U+017F>ee that they would both

it what de<U+017F>igne can I have in <U+017F>uffering it? For it is not probable my Parents would
ever <U+017F>uffer me to marry a per<U+017F>on who is unknowne, and I my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>hould be a<U+017F>hamed that
<hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>hould ever commit <U+017F>uch a fault. Then againe, if we <U+017F>hould breake off all amity,
I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you that I <U+017F>hould long lament it, becau<U+017F>e I thinke his merits make him worthy of
Love: It is the greate<U+017F>t folly in the World (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) that Parents <U+017F>hould make mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and we are very fooles to let them. Has not this brought <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
wherein <U+017F>he is; had her Parents left her to the free di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of her <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he had
married <hi>Celadon;</hi> he had been alive, and <U+017F>he for ever contented; whereas, on the contrary,
Parents cro<U+017F><U+017F>ing them has killed the one, and the other is little better. And now, the old

What would you doe (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) if you were in my roome; I would tell him in few
words (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that I could not abide him: What would be thought of a woman

words are but words, and opinion is but opinion, and both but wind; but to marry a

I pray tell me, is it the humour of the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon</hi> to a<U+017F><U+017F>ect <U+017F>o <U+017F>oone, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

when I was courted by <U+017F>hepherds, I thought my <U+017F>elfe of merit enough to make my

<hi>Alexis,</hi> that now he is out of this humour, and does not love her. I believe it true,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> but it was when <U+017F>he had lo<U+017F>t her beauty, and then his flame extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hed;
<U+017F>o that as <U+017F>oon as my face changeth, his affection to me will change al<U+017F>o.
What a <U+017F>ad di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter would it be to me, if I <U+017F>hould live to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch a change, nay the lea<U+017F>t

not the principal difficulty; for perhaps I <U+017F>hould hope to keep his mind in due amity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

wi<U+017F>h you may, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> but I am affraid you will find it a difficulty: when I looke
upon the beauty of your faire face; for beauty, faire <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> is Glue, or Bird-lime,
which will never let go tho<U+017F>e wings which are touched with it. Madam, replyed <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi>
I am not owner of <U+017F>o much beauty; or if I were, I hope my re<U+017F>olution is <U+017F>tronger then
all the violencies and wilfulne<U+017F><U+017F>e of Love.</p>
                     <p>And be plea<U+017F>ed to know, that I will die a thou<U+017F>and death, rather then I will ever
marry, <U+017F>ince it is the will of heaven, or rather my bad fortune <U+017F>o to have it. At this word
<U+017F>he <U+017F>topped, and pulled out her Hankercher to wipe her eyes, for <U+017F>he was not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
her Teares. And when <U+017F>he was beginning her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e againe, the coming in of
<hi>Adamas</hi> prevented her; who coming into the Chamber by chance, and finding this
good company there, he was <U+017F>orry that he had interrupted them: for there was nothing
he de<U+017F>ired more, then to <U+017F>ee <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> together, in hopes that this way would
remit <hi>Alexis</hi> into his former condition, and con<U+017F>equently that his old age <U+017F>hould be very
happy and contented, according to the Oracle. Yet <U+017F>eeming as if his coming in was of
purpo<U+017F>e; and after he had <U+017F>aluted all the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, he <U+017F>aid thus unto <hi>Alexis:</hi> What

Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> the fault is in my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, who brought them hither without
giving me any notice. The fault, replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> is in your <U+017F>elfe, who are yet in bed;
and if they <U+017F>erved you aright, they would pull all the clothes off, and teach you to ri<U+017F>e

                     <p>Then <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who was ri<U+017F>en off the bed, in reverence of <hi>Adamas:</hi> Reverend Father,

Moreover, it is fit, <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>erve her beauty without taking any paines. You
may <U+017F>ay what you plea<U+017F>e, replyed <hi>Adamas;</hi> But my opinion is, that if <U+017F>he will be fair,
<U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t doe as you doe; for your beauty may tell her, that your Receipt is a very good
one. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> blu<U+017F>ht a little, and would have replyed, if one had not come to acquaint
<hi>Adamas,</hi> that <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> <U+017F>tayed for him in the great Chamber; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

                     <p>After all the Company was a<U+017F><U+017F>embled together, and that to the great contentment of

<U+017F>ince you would have me <U+017F>peake cleerly, that either griefe pre<U+017F>ent torments you, <U+017F>eeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

Prophere<U+017F><U+017F>e: For it is one of the<U+017F>e two that does torment me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but perhaps (<U+017F>aid he
and <U+017F>miled) not <U+017F>o much as you imagine. Sometimes in <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es (<U+017F>aid <hi>Laonice</hi>) one
is apt not to think them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o ill as they are, but in good earne<U+017F>t <hi>Silvander,</hi> which of
the<U+017F>e two is it that mo<U+017F>t troubles you? Which doe you thinke, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander?</hi> If I
<U+017F>hould tel you my opinion, <U+017F>aid <hi>Laonice,</hi> perhaps you would not confe<U+017F>s it. Were it a crime
to love, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I had no rea<U+017F>on to confe<U+017F><U+017F>e; but <U+017F>ince it is rather
a vertue, or at the lea<U+017F>t an action which in it <U+017F>elfe is neither good nor bad, why <U+017F>hould you
thinke I will not confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it; <U+017F>ince in denying a truth I <U+017F>hould commit a greater <U+017F>inne:
Mo<U+017F>t true, <U+017F>hepherd, replyed <hi>Laonice,</hi> for every one who would be e<U+017F>teemed good, ought
above all things to be very carefull they never injure the truth: and therefore <hi>Silvander</hi>
tell me upon your reputation; does not the ab<U+017F>ent good trouble you more than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
evill? <hi>Silvander</hi> had no mind of making his affections knowne unto this <U+017F>tranger, if
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could avoid it, and therefore with a <U+017F>mile an<U+017F>wered her: I cannot chu<U+017F>e but
admire at the quickne<U+017F><U+017F>e of your <U+017F>ight, di<U+017F>creet <hi>Laonice;</hi> for I dur<U+017F>t have <U+017F>worne that
none had taken notice of the<U+017F>e things; but I be<U+017F>eech you, how came you to this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
<hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, content your <U+017F>elfe with this that all the<U+017F>e di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations
which you u<U+017F>e to <hi>Diana</hi> may perhaps amuze <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> but not <U+017F>uch as have with my
eyes ob<U+017F>erved your actions: All tho<U+017F>e that live about the delectable River of <hi>Lignon,</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:53527:49"/>
have their hearts <U+017F>o po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with their owne pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as they never ob<U+017F>erve anothers?
have no eyes for any but for them they love. But I who have nothing el<U+017F>e to doe, but to
ob<U+017F>erve the actions of all, I doe plainly <U+017F>ee that <hi>Madonthe</hi> does plea<U+017F>e you more than
<hi>Diana;</hi> but be not <U+017F>orry that I know it, for perhaps it will not be un<U+017F>erviceable to you:
<hi>Madonthe</hi> loves me, and I think <U+017F>he will be ea<U+017F>ily induced unto any thing I <U+017F>hall per<U+017F>wade;
I know what it is to love, and which way to compa<U+017F><U+017F>e the contentments of it, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
you to aide and <U+017F>erve you in all I am able. <hi>Silvander</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh to
heare her talke thus, and to confirme her in the opinion which <U+017F>he had conceived, he
be<U+017F>eeched her to be <U+017F>ilent, and above all, not to acquaint <hi>Madonthe,</hi> lea<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
her, and <U+017F>o ruine his whole de<U+017F>igne; he thanked her for her kind offers, which he
would not refu<U+017F>e, but would not make u<U+017F>e of at that time, for <U+017F>everall rea<U+017F>ons which
hereafter <U+017F>hould be made knowne unto her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvander</hi> thought him<U+017F>elf very <U+017F>ubtle in this, but <hi>Laonice</hi> who <U+017F>eemed to beleeve him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to contrive the mi<U+017F>chiefe which <U+017F>he intended him, upon it, and which <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he made
him pay <U+017F>o dear for. In the mean time <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> were entred deepe into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e;
for this young man was <U+017F>o inflamed with a violent affection unto this <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, as he
could never re<U+017F>t, but when he was with her. Certainly, if <U+017F>he had intended to love any,
<U+017F>he would have pitched here; but <U+017F>ince the death of <hi>Filander,</hi> <U+017F>he would never <U+017F>uffer
love to take any hold of her affections, thinking none worthy to be Succe<U+017F><U+017F>or unto <U+017F>uch
a <U+017F>hepherd as <hi>Filander.</hi> If <U+017F>he did afterwards love <hi>Silvander,</hi> it was not out of de<U+017F>igne,
but upon a <U+017F>urprize which the merits and addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of that <U+017F>hepherd made upon her; <U+017F>o as
the good will which <U+017F>he had unto <hi>Paris</hi> was no more than as a <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter unto a brother, and
<U+017F>o farre <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elfe obliged by the affection he had unto her; and <U+017F>he was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from any farther, by the affection <U+017F>he bare unto the memory of the courteous <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>
yet he who<U+017F>e affection had no limits, to render unto her all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible te<U+017F>timonies of
his love, he re<U+017F>olved to try his fortune, and thinking this opportunity to be good, he
would not let it <U+017F>lip: leading her therefore by the arm, he drew her a little from the
re<U+017F>t, and whil<U+017F>t every one was bu<U+017F>ied in their owne various conceptions, he <U+017F>poke thus
unto her. I cannot chu<U+017F>e but wonder, faire<U+017F>t <hi>Diana,</hi> that all my endeavours to doe you
all <U+017F>ervice, <U+017F>hould not let you <U+017F>ee the great affection which I have unto you; or if you
do <U+017F>ee it, I wonder more that it <U+017F>hould have no greater operation, nor produce any more
reciprocall good will in your <U+017F>oule: Though my <U+017F>ervices cannot merit <U+017F>o high as love,
for that were too much happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, yet Methinkes they might at the lea<U+017F>t produce <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>parkes of good will, and be in <U+017F>ome degree plea<U+017F>ing unto you; I have tryed all wayes,
and in this cannot but accu<U+017F>e the meane<U+017F><U+017F>e of my merit, and the greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
I have tryed, I <U+017F>ay, and doe find all wayes that are advantagious unto others who
are in love, but find them all unprofitable unto me; you injure my extreame affection;
my <U+017F>ervices di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you; my patience makes me de<U+017F>picable: my con<U+017F>tancy tedious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and the very age I <U+017F>pend in loving, <U+017F>erving and adoring you, is <U+017F>o <U+017F>terile, as you

                     <p>At this word <hi>Paris</hi> was <U+017F>ilent, as well becau<U+017F>e he feared that his eyes could not

him. She, who did love him, as I told you before, not thinking him <U+017F>o deeply engaged
in the Fetters of love, and de<U+017F>iring if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible not to let him depart di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a <U+017F>weet glance of her eye towards him, <U+017F>aid thus unto him; I did not thinke gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Paris</hi> to have heard <U+017F>uch language from you, which is as farre from my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the Heavens are from the Earth; you blame me for being in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, and that
I doe not acknowledge the affection which you have unto me, and I be<U+017F>eech you, what
would you thinke of me, if not loving you, yet I <U+017F>hould behave my <U+017F>elfe towards you as
I doe: Have I not <U+017F>hewed you as much plau<U+017F>ibility and favour as I am capable off? Did
I not alwayes an<U+017F>wer you with all courte<U+017F>ie and civility that was han<U+017F>ome for me doe;
What can you de<U+017F>ire more of me? do you <U+017F>ee me Gara<U+017F><U+017F>e any more then your <U+017F>elfe? do
I not apply my <U+017F>elfe more unto you, then any other? and at this very time, do I offer to
talk or glance any eye upon any but your <U+017F>elfe? Oh faire<U+017F>t <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Paris,</hi> and
<U+017F>ighed) I do confe<U+017F>s all you <U+017F>ay, and that you do more for me, than for any other: but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53527:50"/>
what am I the better, as long as you do nothing for any el<U+017F>e, nor me neither? If my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were not as it is<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I mean, extream, perhaps I <U+017F>hould not with <U+017F>o much importunity beg
te<U+017F>timonies of your good will. And as much as you <U+017F>ay, you have done for me: what I
be<U+017F>eech you have you done, but onely as to the <U+017F>on of <hi>Adamas</hi> the fir<U+017F>t time you <U+017F>aw
him, and before he gave te<U+017F>timony of any affection? All your actions towards me, I mu<U+017F>t
confe<U+017F><U+017F>e are full of civility and <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e, But are you not obliged to the <U+017F>ame towards
all of my qualitie? Can you thinke the<U+017F>e duties that belong to my Name and Quality,
can <U+017F>atisfie for tho<U+017F>e that are due unto a violent affection? No, no, fair one, Civility and
Courte<U+017F>ie will <U+017F>erve the <U+017F>on of <hi>Adamas,</hi> but nothing el<U+017F>e but Love can <U+017F>atisfie <hi>Paris:</hi>
There mu<U+017F>t be a reciprocall compliance, before I can leave complaining; and I mu<U+017F>t
blame you of in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility, and my <U+017F>elfe of ill fortune, in loving <U+017F>o great a beauty with
a hard heart. Then <hi>Diana</hi> after a little pau<U+017F>e, returned him this an<U+017F>wer: I thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
now, <hi>Paris,</hi> that there had been nothing in my actions but what would have plea<U+017F>ed
you, thinking that I had regulated them according to the Rules which Virgins ought to
ob<U+017F>erve, even when they have a de<U+017F>igne to plea<U+017F>e and oblige; but I perceive I was mi<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but to <U+017F>hew my repentance, and how free I am with you, I will very <U+017F>incerely tell you
my thoughts: I honour you <hi>Paris,</hi> as much as I do any man in the world; and I do
love you as much as I do my brother; if this will not content you, I cannot tell what
you can de<U+017F>ire more.</p>
                     <p>Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris,</hi> This Declaration is indeed very plea<U+017F>ing unto me, and as the
Son of <hi>Adamas,</hi> I am fully <U+017F>atisfied; but, as <hi>Paris,</hi> not at all: becau<U+017F>e my affection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
nothing more; not Courte<U+017F>ie for Courte<U+017F>ie, but Love for Love. If you be not
contented and <U+017F>atisfied with this I have told you <hi>Paris,</hi> replyed the <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, you
mu<U+017F>t look for more from your <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>uffer your de<U+017F>ires to go beyond due limits;
and I have a ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of complaint again<U+017F>t you, if I would take it, for pretending more
from me, then I ought to give<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 'Tis very true, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> that you would have mo<U+017F>t
ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of complaint, if faire <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire any thing from you which
was not fit for you to grant: But all my de<U+017F>ires being grounded upon honour and virtue,
methinks you <U+017F>hould not complaine again<U+017F>t them; And to open my heart mo<U+017F>t freely
unto her that owes it, know fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I am <U+017F>o wholly devoted unto you,
that I <U+017F>hall never enjoy any re<U+017F>t or contentment, untill you be al<U+017F>o mine, upon condition
of marriage. You do me much honour, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> in having <U+017F>uch thoughts: but
you mu<U+017F>t know, that I have Parents, unto who<U+017F>e wi<U+017F>dome I refer all <U+017F>uch matters: and
yet if you will have me <U+017F>hew you my very heart, I do <U+017F>weare, <hi>Paris,</hi> that neither you nor
they, nor any alive, are able to move me unto any <U+017F>uch mind of marriage. I do love you
as my Brother, but cannot as a Husband; and do not think this <U+017F>trange, for my minde
is the <U+017F>ame towards all men living. Oh ye Gods, <U+017F>aid <hi>Paris</hi> then, mu<U+017F>t I never receive
any perfect contentment? You <U+017F>ay that you do love me as your Brother, but you or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain

<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what would you have me <U+017F>ay? have you a mind I <U+017F>hould deceive you? or with

<U+017F>o <U+017F>he have as much wit as to believe all I tell her, I would not have her able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the deep <U+017F>ciences of our learned Druids. But if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have no more wit then
to believe you, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> you would be put to a great deale of paine, by rea<U+017F>on of
the cure you would have in the carriage of her <U+017F>elfe. You are much deceived <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) for what is plea<U+017F>ure to one, is never painful. Some <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o indeed, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Diana,</hi> but I do not think <U+017F>o; for I believe the plea<U+017F>ure onely keepes them from thinking
of the paine: but that they have none is an error, <U+017F>ince if they be put to any violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci<U+017F>e,
they will blow and paint as if they wanted breath. See <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you
are one of tho<U+017F>e two, whom I would not love; you have too much wit, and put me to pain
in <U+017F>tudying how to an<U+017F>wer you, which is a thing I cannot abide: but on the contrary,
I <U+017F>hould be extreamly contented, if <U+017F>he admire all I do, and all I <U+017F>ay: from admiration
proceeds from a good opinion, and from this good opinion will proceed the love that
I de<U+017F>ire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvander</hi> who was neare, and watched for an occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>econding <hi>Diana</hi> in her di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e:
Admiration, <U+017F>aid he, will work the contrary effect which you de<U+017F>ire. Why <U+017F>o?
<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas;</hi> for if <U+017F>he admire me, <U+017F>he will believe me full of great and high parts; and
when I <U+017F>peak, <hi>I</hi> am an Oracle unto her, my de<U+017F>ires will be Lawes, and my will Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
Admiration will produce quite contrary effects, replyed <hi>Silvander;</hi> For the
learned <U+017F>ay, that Admiration is the mother of Verity, in as much as admiring any thing
the minde of man is naturally apt to <U+017F>earch for the knowledge of it, and this <U+017F>earch makes
him find out the truth: and <U+017F>o <hi>Hylas,</hi> in <U+017F>aying that <U+017F>he will admire you, you doe as
much as <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>he will know you; and knowing you, <U+017F>he will finde that if <U+017F>hee e<U+017F>teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing in you, <U+017F>he is mi<U+017F>taken; and then in <U+017F>corning you, <U+017F>he will admire that <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hould admire you: <hi>I</hi> perceive <U+017F>hepheard, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you are one of tho<U+017F>e wits,
which, were <hi>I</hi> a woman, <hi>I</hi> <U+017F>hould never love: But though you can talk well, yet talke as
long as you will, <hi>I</hi> am <U+017F>till in the <U+017F>ame opinion; for he who does admire whil<U+017F>t he is in
that admiration, does he not infinitely e<U+017F>teem the party that cau<U+017F>eth it? 'Tis true; <U+017F>aid
<hi>Silvander;</hi> but then pre<U+017F>ently after that, he will change when he comes to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth. This, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> does give me <U+017F>atisfaction: for in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>he
will change pre<U+017F>ently, let me tell you, my good friend <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, and clapt him
upon the <U+017F>houlder, <U+017F>he may chance to doe as <hi>I</hi> may do; but let her make as much ha<U+017F>te
as <U+017F>he can, <hi>I</hi> will pardon her if <U+017F>he change <U+017F>ooner then my <U+017F>elfe: and if <U+017F>he do chance
to be before me, faith ile over take her pre<U+017F>ently. This an<U+017F>wer cau<U+017F>ed every one to laugh,
and this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e entertained them till they came into the hou<U+017F>e, where the Table was
furni<U+017F>hed with many delicacies, and every one <U+017F>at down as the night before.</p>
                     <p>All dinner while, nothing was almo<U+017F>t talked on, but the merry humour of <hi>Hylas;</hi>
and to put him upon di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, there was alwayes <U+017F>ome or other who took his part.
Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, <hi>Stella,</hi> who though <U+017F>he did it in <U+017F>hew to plea<U+017F>e the company, yet was it
not at all again<U+017F>t her humour, <U+017F>he having all her life long followed the rules of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And <hi>Corilas</hi> who had heretofore re<U+017F>ented the effects of it, hearing how <U+017F>he took
part with <hi>Hylas:</hi> Shepherd, <U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you tell me; is it true
that love does grow from <U+017F>ympathy? All tho<U+017F>e who ever <U+017F>poke of it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
<U+017F>ay Yes, Then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas,</hi> am I the onely one that believes the contrary, and have
had full experience of it: For can two humours be more like, than tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Hylas</hi> and
<hi>Stella?</hi> and yet I do not <U+017F>ee there is any love betwixt them. There was not one at all
the Table, who did not laugh when they heard this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Corilas.</hi> And when <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi>
would have an<U+017F>wered, <hi>Stella</hi> interrupted him, in <U+017F>aying; I do not blu<U+017F>h, <U+017F>hepherd,
at a thing which hath given me all the contentment I enjoy; for had I not changed when
I loved you, I had lo<U+017F>t it; and you mu<U+017F>t accu<U+017F>e the rea<U+017F>on which <hi>Silvander</hi> gave, for my
changing which is, that Admiration is the mother of Truth: for at the fir<U+017F>t not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, I did admire you; and when I did know you, <U+017F>corned you; <U+017F>o as you may very

well give this Motto; <hi>Farre off, <U+017F>omething; neer nothing.</hi> But, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled; as
you <U+017F>ay, that I am Incon<U+017F>tant for loving you once, and not loving you; <U+017F>o you may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>ay that I am Con<U+017F>tant, in changing once only and continuing in a re<U+017F>olution of never
loving you, as long as I live. The que<U+017F>tion which I asked, replyed <hi>Corilas,</hi> is not whether
you be a wavering Weather-cocke or no: But whether (<hi>Hylas</hi> and you being alike, and
<U+017F>impathy being a cau<U+017F>e of love) whether you doe love one another? Unto this <U+017F>he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
<U+017F>aid, I will tell you <hi>Corilas,</hi> that <U+017F>impathy may worke its effects, when there is no
greater force to oppo<U+017F>e it; And that <U+017F>impathy which may be betwixt <hi>Hylas</hi> and me,
might have <U+017F>o much force as to make us love, if it were not that knowing thee <U+017F>o little wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of love, thou ha<U+017F>t made me have <U+017F>uch an ill opinion of all other <U+017F>hepherds, as I know not
whether ever I <U+017F>hall love any. You have taught me a le<U+017F><U+017F>on, <U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas:</hi> For having
had <U+017F>o much experience of you, I cannot conceive that tho<U+017F>e who are under the <U+017F>ame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
you are, doe not hide under tho<U+017F>e habits the <U+017F>ame imperfections: Fie, fie, <U+017F>aid all the
<U+017F>hepherds, this, <hi>Corilas,</hi> is too much, to blame all the re<U+017F>t: No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas,</hi> my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not to blame them: I onely <U+017F>ay, that I cannot conceive they have not <U+017F>ame imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
I doe not <U+017F>ay, they have them, and in this I blame onely my <U+017F>elfe, as not having

Father, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, that to part the<U+017F>e two friendly Enemies (for <U+017F>he knew
they were <U+017F>o called) and to <U+017F>atisfie a curio<U+017F>ity wherein I have long lived, you would doe
very well to tell us what this Simpathy is, of which they <U+017F>peake, and whether it will
cau<U+017F>e love; and in <U+017F>o doing, you will fea<U+017F>t us double, both in our bodies, and in our
minds. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas,</hi> your curio<U+017F>ity is commendable, and did I not give
it <U+017F>atisfaction I were much to blame, as well in not obeying what you plea<U+017F>e to command,
as in not informing <U+017F>uch as de<U+017F>ire it, as my charge obliges me; and the <U+017F>ooner, becau<U+017F>e I
am able to doe it in few words: Be plea<U+017F>ed to know, Madam, that <hi>Tautates</hi> the <U+017F>upream
Creator of all things, did make Heaven, which is his chiefe<U+017F>t Man<U+017F>ion, and the place where
he created all <U+017F>oules, and becau<U+017F>e it is nothing likely that any thing <U+017F>hould come out of
the hand of <U+017F>uch an excellent Workeman which is not in its full perfection, he formed
the <U+017F>oule by intellectuall participation. Now this participation is taken from the pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of that Planet which is predominate when it is created, and this perfection
which it receives, is <U+017F>o agreeable to it, as it is inflamed with love of that intelligence
which did impart it unto it. And even as a Lover doth forme an Idea of the thing loved in
his fancy, as perfectly as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he can, to the end it may fill the eyes of his <U+017F>oule, and
plea<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elfe in this contemplation when he is deprived of the <U+017F>ight of that beloved face;
<U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e this <U+017F>oule being in love with the <U+017F>upream beauty of this Intelligence, and of
this Planet when it entred into the body unto which it gave the forme, it did imprint
not onely the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and the airy body, in which the learned <U+017F>ay it is wrapped but al<U+017F>o the
fancy with this Character, with the beauty of which it was ardently inflamed in heaven,
<U+017F>o as it can apprehend a figure and perfect re<U+017F>emblance of it: and plea<U+017F>ing it <U+017F>elfe in this
contemplation it conceives a certaine naturall di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to e<U+017F>teeme all that re<U+017F>embles
it good and beautifull, and to di<U+017F>like generally all that is unlike unto it, accu<U+017F>toming
its judgement in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort unto this will as it becomes habituall, from which we cannot
refraine without very great force upon our <U+017F>elves: From hence it is, that as <U+017F>oone as we
ca<U+017F>t our eyes upon any one; if they doe report unto our <U+017F>oules, as faithfull Mirrrors,
that there is in this per<U+017F>on <U+017F>omething which doth re<U+017F>emble that Image of Intelligence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
we doe love, without any farther di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e in our <U+017F>elves, or other <U+017F>earch for
the occa<U+017F>ion of this good will, being drawne unto it by an in<U+017F>tinct which may be termed
blind: On the contrary we doe hate, if we doe find them different; and this is it they
call <U+017F>impathy, which is that conformity which we find betwixt one another; and which
indeed is the <U+017F>ource of love and not beauty altogether, as many believe: For if beauty
were the <U+017F>ource of love, it would follow that all faire ones would be loved of all: But
we <U+017F>ee on the contrary, that not the mo<U+017F>t faire and the mo<U+017F>t worthy, but tho<U+017F>e onely who
come neere<U+017F>t to our humour, and with whom we have mo<U+017F>t conformity, are tho<U+017F>e whom
we doe love be<U+017F>t.</p>

Here the Druide <U+017F>topt, and <hi>Daphnide</hi> began thus; I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e with thankes, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Father, that you have at once cleered <U+017F>everall doubts unto me, yet one remaines in
which I much de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>atisfaction. If it be <U+017F>o that love proceeds from that re<U+017F>emblance that
I meet with all in the party that I doe love: How comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, that the <U+017F>ame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emblance
does not make him love me? For, if I do love by this <U+017F>impathy, and if this <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
doe come as you doe <U+017F>ay, Methinkes it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but that he mu<U+017F>t have the <U+017F>ame
inclination unto me, that I have unto him; My meaning is, that the <U+017F>ame Planet mu<U+017F>t
have the <U+017F>ame influence upon us both; yet for all that we <U+017F>ee many who doe not at all
affect tho<U+017F>e who are even ready to dye for the love of them. Your doubt, Madam, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Adamas,</hi> de<U+017F>erves a cleering; it is very ingeniou<U+017F>ly moved, and <U+017F>hewes the excellency
of that <U+017F>pirit from whence it comes.</p>
                     <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed therefore to know, Madam, that as I told you, the <U+017F>oule fancies unto it <U+017F>elfe
an Idea, and the mo<U+017F>t perfect image that it can of this Planet, and of that Intelligence or
apprehen<U+017F>ion which it loves; but in as much as, to repre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>o faire and <U+017F>o perfect an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
the matter is of <U+017F>uch an inferiour <U+017F>ort, as it is able to doe it but very imperfectly:
It mu<U+017F>t en<U+017F>ue that this repre<U+017F>entation is not equally perfect in every one, becau<U+017F>e the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the body is better di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed in <U+017F>ome than in others, and accordingly as the <U+017F>oul does
find it, <U+017F>o does it worke more or le<U+017F><U+017F>e perfectly; As in painting, if the pencill, and the
colours be naught, the Painter mu<U+017F>t needs make bad work, and but little re<U+017F>emblant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the thing he would repre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>o the <U+017F>oule finding the body indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to receive the
figure and lineaments, that <U+017F>he would give of this beauty which it loves, the re<U+017F>emblance
remaines <U+017F>o imperfect, as the features are hardly knowable: And when this happens thus,
doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he that hath the mo<U+017F>t perfect repre<U+017F>entation of this Intelligence, and of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
<U+017F>hall be loved by <U+017F>impathy of the other who hath it, though ill done: For his <U+017F>oule,
though it hath not the repre<U+017F>entation of this face which it loves, in this body, to the life;
yet does love the Portraiture when he <U+017F>ees it well done in what place <U+017F>oever it be; but on
the contrary, that <U+017F>oule which <U+017F>hall meet with a matter: well di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, and which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence
hath the Idea and patterne well repre<U+017F>ented; it daigns not to turne its eyes upon
the other, either becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>cornes it, <U+017F>eeing it <U+017F>o ill made, or becau<U+017F>e it knowes
it not, having <U+017F>o little re<U+017F>emblance; and from hence proceeds that love which is
not mutuall.</p>
                     <p>But (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi> and interrupted) good Father give me leave to aske you one que<U+017F>tion:
If the<U+017F>e loves proceed from <U+017F>impathy how comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, that after one hath loved ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he <U+017F>ometimes cea<U+017F>eth that love; nay, <U+017F>ometimes to <U+017F>corne, and often to hate. This
que<U+017F>tion, an<U+017F>wered the Druid, and <U+017F>miled, is a que<U+017F>tion fit for <hi>Hylas,</hi> and you may <U+017F>ee
that this <U+017F>impathy is a blind in<U+017F>tinct, <U+017F>ince <hi>Hylas</hi> loving and cea<U+017F>ing to love one and the
<U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject, yet he does not know why he does <U+017F>o: But <hi>Hylas,</hi> I will tell you, to the
end that hereafter you may know the rea<U+017F>on of tho<U+017F>e things which you doe <U+017F>o well
practi<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>Imagine, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that tho<U+017F>e impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions which the <U+017F>oule makes in her body, by which
<U+017F>he repre<U+017F>ents this <U+017F>uperiour beauty of her under<U+017F>tanding, and of her Planet, be indeed
corporeall: For <U+017F>he drawes the lineaments in the fancy, as a Lover does the features of
tho<U+017F>e he loves in his imagination, and repre<U+017F>ents them in <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort in his <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, and in his
complexion, as <U+017F>he makes his humour melancholy, if <U+017F>he have any influence from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne;</hi>
and merry, if from <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and <U+017F>o of the re<U+017F>t. And afterwards, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he takes <U+017F>o great a cu<U+017F>tome in contemplating and approving the<U+017F>e things, as
<U+017F>he has made it habituall, which though it be very difficult to change or lo<U+017F>e, yet it may
be changed and lo<U+017F>t. As we <U+017F>ee commonly come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, in wax and a <U+017F>eale: Though
the wax have an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion and figure, yet if one will make a new impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, the <U+017F>ame
wax lo<U+017F>es the fir<U+017F>t figure, and takes the new; <U+017F>o the <U+017F>oule having imprinted this Coele<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Character in the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, if they through carele<U+017F><U+017F>ene<U+017F><U+017F>e be not plea<U+017F>ed with it, or el<U+017F>e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
new objects make the will rove after them; it is certaine, the<U+017F>e will marke his fancy
with another figure, and it will <U+017F>o lo<U+017F>e the fir<U+017F>t re<U+017F>emblance, as that it will retaine no
<U+017F>hadow of it; and then the party who was loved by him, or who loved him by <U+017F>impathy
lo<U+017F>ing this re<U+017F>emblance which he had, he lo<U+017F>eth al<U+017F>o the love which it cau<U+017F>ed. For even
as Habitudes, <U+017F>o <U+017F>impathy, may be lo<U+017F>t, and gotten; but <hi>Hylas,</hi> if every time you have
changed, you have imprinted a new Idea in your <U+017F>elfe, there is none in the world who<U+017F>e
impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions are not in you; <U+017F>o as my daughter may hope that you will be more con<U+017F>tant
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53527:52"/>
unto her, than you have been to all the world; not that <U+017F>he merits more then her world of
Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors, but becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he is the la<U+017F>t. Every one laughed at the conclu<U+017F>ion; and <hi>Hylas</hi>
had an<U+017F>wered, if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had not interpo<U+017F>ed.</p>
                     <p>I be<U+017F>eech you, Father, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, if it be <U+017F>o that love doth proceed from this <U+017F>ympathy,
how comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, one <U+017F>hould be long acquainted with another without any love,
and yet love at la<U+017F>t? The an<U+017F>wer which I gave unto <hi>Hylas,</hi> replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> may <U+017F>erve
unto this que<U+017F>tion: At the fir<U+017F>t, that per<U+017F>on had not the Character of the beauty of this
intelligence; and <U+017F>ince by a new mark, as with a new <U+017F>eale, he might have it imprinted:
but to demon<U+017F>trate it a little clearer.</p>
                     <p>The <U+017F>oul being wrapped in the<U+017F>e bodies of ours, as long as it is there <U+017F>hut up as in a
Pri<U+017F>on, <U+017F>he does not under<U+017F>tand, nor comprehend any thing but onely by the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es by
which, as by <U+017F>o many windowes, <U+017F>he come to the knowledge of all that is in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e:
And <U+017F>he does not onely not under<U+017F>tand nor comprehend, but by them; but al<U+017F>o
<U+017F>he can neither under<U+017F>tand nor comprehend, but by corporeal repre<U+017F>entations, although
<U+017F>he does <U+017F>tudy and contemplate the incorporeal <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances. Hence it comes to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, that
<U+017F>he cannot have a knowledge of things more perfectly, then as the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es pre<U+017F>ent them
unto her: and if they be fal<U+017F>e and deluders, they deceive her, and cau<U+017F>e her to be of a
fal<U+017F>e judgement; as we <U+017F>ee in <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>ick, who think meats though never <U+017F>o good, yet
to be ill ta<U+017F>ted, becau<U+017F>e their gu<U+017F>t is depraved. So likewi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>uch as have ill eyes, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<U+017F>ee things double, or of another colour: or yet, though the eyes be good and
<U+017F>ound, yet <U+017F>ome interpo<U+017F>itions betwixt the eye and the object may delude; as if they look
through a blew or red Gla<U+017F>s, all they <U+017F>ee <U+017F>eems to be of the <U+017F>ame colours: A <U+017F>traight <U+017F>taff
put into the water, will <U+017F>eem crooked; and all things greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er, according to the
qualities of the Spectacles through which they are looked upon. Now the<U+017F>e fal<U+017F>ities,
being repre<U+017F>ented by the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, for truths, the <U+017F>oule which gives credit unto them, is
pre<U+017F>ently corrupted in her judgement, becau<U+017F>e the things pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, and from whence
<U+017F>he drawes con<U+017F>equences, are <U+017F>uch: The Judgement being made, the Will immediately
con<U+017F>ents unto it: The Will, I <U+017F>ay, which has that which is good for her object, and
that which is judged <U+017F>o, or which on the contrary, does fly that which <U+017F>he thinks to be
evill.</p>
                     <p>And from hence you may under<U+017F>tand, fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that the rea<U+017F>on why <U+017F>ometimes
we <U+017F>ee one whom we doe not love, yet afterwards do love; is, either becau<U+017F>e our eyes and
our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, who<U+017F>e office is to pre<U+017F>ent the<U+017F>e things unto the <U+017F>oule, are not faithful in the
functions; or el<U+017F>e the Mediums by which they act, have <U+017F>ome imperfection which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them from doing their duties faithfully; which imperfections being removed, they
come to di<U+017F>cover the truth, and relate it unto the <U+017F>oule, which then finding this re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
brings ardently to love that which before <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw and did not care for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana,</hi> who hearkened very attentively unto <hi>Adamas:</hi> Reverend Father, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
and <U+017F>miled, I would gladly propound one que<U+017F>tion unto you, did I not thinke I <U+017F>hould
be too trouble<U+017F>ome in it: No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> what<U+017F>oever <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet a <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hall ask,
I <U+017F>hall an<U+017F>wer if I be able: Surely, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas</hi> is able to an<U+017F>wer many
more, then <U+017F>uch a filly ignorant <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e as I am can aske. Tell me, I be<U+017F>eech you,
<U+017F>ince love proceeds from <U+017F>ympathy, which is an image repre<U+017F>ented in us, of that Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and Planet under which we were born; how comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, that faire ones are
commonly loved by every one? For it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem that all tho<U+017F>e who love, are born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one and the <U+017F>ame planet, which we know they are not, being borne at <U+017F>everall
times.</p>
                     <p>I ever expected, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas</hi> that this <U+017F>ubtil <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e would aske <U+017F>ome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion
which was not common; but I will try if I can an<U+017F>wer it. All fair things, although
they be differing, yet have <U+017F>ome conformity among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, as all good things have;
and therefore <U+017F>ome have <U+017F>aid, That there is but one good, and one faire, after the <U+017F>imili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of which all things good and faire are judged to be <U+017F>uch. Now the<U+017F>e Planets, and
the<U+017F>e Intelligences which govern them, are neither good nor faire, but onely as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emble
mo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>upream good and faire. And though they are among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and differing; yet they are not amiable nor e<U+017F>timable, but as they are good and
fair: And this Goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e and Fairne<U+017F><U+017F>e having alwaies conformitie, though they be in
divers <U+017F>ubjects; it need not be thought <U+017F>trange, if many doe love tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons who are
faire, though they be not born under the <U+017F>ame Planet, <U+017F>ince every one ob<U+017F>erves in their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53527:52"/>
beauty <U+017F>omething which is conformable unto their owne.</p>
                     <p>I am now, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t contented man in the world, for I have learned one
thing which will be highly advantagious unto me. And you <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards him, you have rea<U+017F>on to be mute at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, for it nothing concernes
you. I do not know, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> wherein it will much advantage you. O ignorant
<U+017F>hepheard, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> did<U+017F>t thou not hear the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>ay, that the rea<U+017F>on why
faire ones are loved by <U+017F>o many, was, becau<U+017F>e their beauty had a conformity with all the
Planets and Intelligencies? I heard it very well, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander;</hi> but what does that
advantage you? In this, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>ince I do love <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal beauties, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
that I have conformity with them all; <U+017F>o con<U+017F>equently am fairer then you are, who
never looks but upon one. I think, replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, that if your argument
be good, you are not onely fairer then I am, but then any in the Country, nay then all,
put them all together; but you mu<U+017F>t not under<U+017F>tand the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas</hi>
in that <U+017F>ort; but on the contrary, if you remember what he an<U+017F>wered <hi>Daphnide,</hi> you
will finde that it is a <U+017F>igne of a great defect in you, who has the portraiture of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
and Planet <U+017F>o ill made, as there is not one of the<U+017F>e faire ones who does not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
to <U+017F>ee in thee <U+017F>o great imperfection of a thing <U+017F>o perfect.</p>
                     <p>This moved all to laughter, and <hi>Hylas</hi> had replyed <U+017F>omething in his own defence, had
they not ri<U+017F>en from the Table, it being very late, and becau<U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the coun<U+017F>ell which <hi>Leonide</hi> gave her, to entreat <hi>Adamas</hi> that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
to come unto their Town, and offer the <U+017F>acrifice of Thanks for the fortunate Mis<U+017F>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe;
<U+017F>he took <hi>Diana, Phillis, Celidea, Stella,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es a part,
and propounded to them, that <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>hepherds had already <U+017F>hewed their forwardne<U+017F>s
in reque<U+017F>ting <hi>Adamas</hi> to offer this <U+017F>acrifice; it was fit they joyned with them in the <U+017F>ame
de<U+017F>ires, and to try if they could carry him with them when they returned. Every one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of the motion; and after a con<U+017F>ultation, who among<U+017F>t them <U+017F>hould be their <U+017F>pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
it was agreed, that <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>hould be the mouth of the Company, which <U+017F>he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of, though at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he made <U+017F>ome difficulty. So then addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing them<U+017F>elves unto
<hi>Alexis,</hi> they intimated unto her their de<U+017F>ires of <U+017F>peaking unto the <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired
that it might be by her meanes. <hi>Alexis</hi> never asking what the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e was, went
pre<U+017F>ently unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> letting him know the de<U+017F>ires of the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>creet <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es.
Then <hi>Diana</hi> in the Name of all her Companions, delivered their Petition in very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
terms. And added thereunto, that they would e<U+017F>teem it as a high favour, if he would
be plea<U+017F>ed without any longer delay, to go now along with them; al<U+017F>o did humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech
him, to let the fair Druid his Daughter, and the Nimph <hi>Leonide,</hi> honour the <U+017F>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
with their pre<U+017F>ence.</p>
                     <p>Unto which <U+017F>upplication, they received this An<U+017F>wer from the Druid: Fair and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
<U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>es, your reque<U+017F>t is <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t, and I am obliged <U+017F>o much to <U+017F>ee the honour of

am mo<U+017F>t confident an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> that there is none here, who are not plea<U+017F>ed with
any thing you <U+017F>hall be plea<U+017F>ed to command. I de<U+017F>ire then, replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> that you
will <U+017F>tay with me all this day, that I may take order for all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and I promi<U+017F>e you that to morrow I will conduct you to your Town: And I
<U+017F>hall mo<U+017F>t humbly de<U+017F>ire, that this Lady (<U+017F>aid he, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Daphniae</hi>)
will do us <U+017F>o far honour, as to be an a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant at this <U+017F>acrifice of Thanks, as well to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this honour unto our great <hi>Tautates,</hi> as to oblige us all, in not parting <U+017F>o much good

unto our advantage, as we cannot de<U+017F>ire a more noble favour.</p>
                     <p>Thus the voyage of <hi>Adamas</hi> was concluded upon, and he at the <U+017F>ame time in order to

<hi>Alexis</hi> was a little <U+017F>tartled at her returning unto her Town, being <U+017F>till in extream feares
of being known: Yet <U+017F>eeing it was a thing re<U+017F>olved upon, <U+017F>he di<U+017F><U+017F>embled her feares as

                     <p>
                        <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden alteration in her, was much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, as not being able
to imagine the cau<U+017F>e, nor conceive that any thing <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her:
And in this perplexity they both <U+017F>tood a long while <U+017F>peechle<U+017F><U+017F>e; at la<U+017F>t the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e
was the fir<U+017F>t who began to <U+017F>peake: Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her, I <U+017F>ee that you are changed
upon a <U+017F>udden, and I cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly chu<U+017F>e but be exceedingly troubled at it; if I be the
cau<U+017F>e, either by my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, or otherwi<U+017F>e, I doe vow by that <U+017F>oule which loves you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the World, that I will pre<U+017F>ently be revenged upon my <U+017F>elfe for it; if I be not, then
tell me I be<U+017F>eech you, if my life can doe you any <U+017F>ervice, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee there is nothing
<U+017F>o deare unto me, which I would not <U+017F>acrifice unto it. <hi>Alexis,</hi> knowing her fault, and
checking her <U+017F>elfe; did endeavour to excu<U+017F>e and hide it as well as <U+017F>he could, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with a deepe <U+017F>igh, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered thus; Tis true, faire <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that the alteration
which you ob<U+017F>erved in my face, did proceed from you, and yet you are not to be blamed,
but onely my owne <U+017F>oule, which is too <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of a thing which your words did bring
into my memory: And to give <U+017F>atisfaction unto your perplexity, you mu<U+017F>t know, that
I being brought up among<U+017F>t the Virgin Druids of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> among<U+017F>t the multitude that
was there, I made choice of one, whom above all the re<U+017F>t <U+017F>eemed unto me mo<U+017F>t amiable,
and thought my <U+017F>elfe not mi<U+017F>taken in my choice, <U+017F>he being e<U+017F>teemed <U+017F>o among<U+017F>t all our
Companions, and having all de<U+017F>irable qualities which u<U+017F>e to create love: She was faire,
han<U+017F>ome, and as well extracted as any in all the Country, her wit was <U+017F>utable to the
perfections of her body, everyway accompli<U+017F>hed, and all her actions were <U+017F>weetned
with affability and civility; her <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e flowed <U+017F>o upon me, that I loved her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
I thought <U+017F>he loved me, I loved her extreamly, and this love came to that height
betwixt us, that I could not live without her, nor <U+017F>he without me: Thus we pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
many yeares with abundance of content and <U+017F>atisfaction from each other; but whil<U+017F>t
I thought my <U+017F>elfe more happy in this condition of friend<U+017F>hip, than the greate<U+017F>t Monarch
can be of his Dominions, this faire one quitted me, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>eperated her <U+017F>elfe from all
termes of friend<U+017F>hip with me, as <U+017F>he would never <U+017F>ee me againe, and without ever telling
any cau<U+017F>e fell into <U+017F>uch hatred of me as <U+017F>he would never come neere me</p>
                     <p>My perplexity at this alteration was <U+017F>o great, and the blow <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, as I becoming
all <U+017F>orrow, I fell <U+017F>icke, and <U+017F>o dangerou<U+017F>ly, as I beleeve you have heard, that I thought
I <U+017F>hould never recover it. Now when you fell into expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of your con<U+017F>tant and unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
humour, I remembred the like expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions which this faire and wi<U+017F>e Virgin u<U+017F>ed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, and which were <U+017F>o ill ob<U+017F>erved, and this cau<U+017F>ed the alteration which you ob<U+017F>erved
in my countenance. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I am <U+017F>orry that I <U+017F>hould be any way the cau<U+017F>e
of your perplexity; but I hope you will thinke me innocent, for had I knowne it, I
would never have committed this fault: But who would ever have thought, that you
who are <U+017F>o faire and full of all perfections, enough to invite and keep the whole world in
love with you, <U+017F>hould ever find a woman <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple and incon<U+017F>iderate, as to let a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e

voluntarily e<U+017F>cape her hands, which every one ought to de<U+017F>ire and covet? Oh God!
Oh Heavens! Oh all thats <U+017F>acred! how carefull <U+017F>hould I be in keeping <U+017F>o great a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F><U+017F>e,
if Heaven beyond my merit <U+017F>hould ever rai<U+017F>e me to <U+017F>o high a fortune? And with
how much carefull a<U+017F><U+017F>iduity <U+017F>hould I court it, if by my care, paines, and travell I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hopes to obtaine it? But Heaven, which has looked upon me with a frowning eye ever
<U+017F>ince I was borne, will I feare never be <U+017F>o favourable to me as long as I live. Faire <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi> then, let me intreat you, that unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you will exceedingly di<U+017F>oblige

For I cannot endure without much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould ever receive any blame, for that
which is only my fault, and the ill influence of that planet under which I was born. And as
to your de<U+017F>ire of my <U+017F>ucceeding in her place, beleeve it <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> it is I that would covet it with
any Art, but for one thing which gives me a checke. And mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly were it not for
that con<U+017F>ideration, my de<U+017F>ires of it <U+017F>hould exceed yours But, faire <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e I fear, that
though now at the fir<U+017F>t, you judge me worthy of your amity, yet when you do particularly
know me, your judgement will find it <U+017F>elfe mi<U+017F>taken, and looke a<U+017F>quint at me as this faire
and wi<U+017F>e one did, who<U+017F>e lo<U+017F><U+017F>e I doe <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly re<U+017F>ent; and if <U+017F>uch a fatall chance <U+017F>hould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall

<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay that this faire one was to blame in treating you thus, and therefore
becau<U+017F>e I will not upon any con<U+017F>ideration what<U+017F>oever di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, I will not <U+017F>ay it; but by
your permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion I will <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>he will never find <U+017F>uch a jewell as <U+017F>he has lo<U+017F>t; and that
if <hi>Tautates</hi> as a mo<U+017F>t particular ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing would preferre me unto her roome, I would not
part from it for a thou<U+017F>and worlds. Ah faire <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <U+017F>ighed, if <U+017F>uch
a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>hould befall me, I <U+017F>hould vaule your amity at as a high rate, as you can mine:
But beleeve me faire one, you know not what you de<U+017F>ire, when you de<U+017F>ire my amity. I
confe<U+017F><U+017F>e Madam, what you <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> for the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which I de<U+017F>ire is <U+017F>o
high, as the weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e of my under<U+017F>tanding is not of capacity to comprehend it: But
Madam, <U+017F>ince it is not the meane<U+017F><U+017F>e of my merit, what is it which hinders you from
doing me this high favour, <U+017F>ince I doe call <hi>Tautates</hi> to witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, that if I be <U+017F>o happy as
to obtaine it, I will pre<U+017F>erve it deerer than my life; nay, even that life which would be
an infinite happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, if you thinke me worthy of it. <hi>Alexis</hi> upon this, <U+017F>welling with
contentment, <U+017F>he tooke her hand, and gra<U+017F>ping it a little, <U+017F>aid unto her; faire <U+017F>hepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e,
remember where we leave this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and we will fini<U+017F>h it to morrow, as we
goe unto your Towne; in the mean time, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that I have a greater inclination and
will to love you and <U+017F>erve you, than you can tell how to de<U+017F>ire.</p>
                     <p>The rea<U+017F>on why <hi>Alexis</hi> referred this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e untill another time was, lea<U+017F>t lookers
on <U+017F>hould have any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition, had it continued longer; be<U+017F>ides, <U+017F>he could not there hide
her blu<U+017F>hes and alterations in her face, as <U+017F>he hoped to doe by the way, when every one
would imploy their eyes in looking at their feet, and chu<U+017F>ing the way: And be<U+017F>ides that,
<U+017F>he intended to advi<U+017F>e with <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> what to doe upon this occa<U+017F>ion: And
by fortune, <hi>Hylas,</hi> as if he had been <U+017F>ome expre<U+017F><U+017F>e Envoy, came to interrupt their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e.
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, if you continue talking thus long with this <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, I
<U+017F>hall beleeve you thinke the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of this Country more amiable than the <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.
Never doubt that, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and lay the blame only upon Nature which inclines
every thing to love its like; but Servant be not angry nor troubled at it, for I have love
enough for you yet. I thought, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> that being brought up among<U+017F>t the Druids
and learned Virgins, you had knowne the Lawes of Nature better than you doe; but
<U+017F>ince you come from among<U+017F>t them <U+017F>o ignorant, I will in<U+017F>truct you Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than they have done. Perhaps Servant, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled, you will lo<U+017F>e both
your time and your paines as well as they; and therefore I advi<U+017F>e you to let it alone: Yet
I cannot endure the wrong you have done me, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> without complaint, <U+017F>ince
you will not be told of your faults and in<U+017F>tructed in your errours. I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>orry, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis,</hi>
that <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>hould complain of me in earne<U+017F>t, but I hope he is onely in je<U+017F>t. How
can you thinke I <U+017F>hould chu<U+017F>e but be angry? replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> when I heare you <U+017F>ay that
you have love enough yet left for me, after you have loved the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es? It <U+017F>eemes
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53527:54"/>
I mu<U+017F>t be contented with the refu<U+017F>e of others, and take what they leave: I do expect,
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, that they <U+017F>hould have what I leave, and all rea<U+017F>on requires it <U+017F>o. If that be it
which angers you, replyed <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, we <U+017F>hall make all <U+017F>traight. I will divide
my amity into two, one half <U+017F>hall be to love <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and the other <U+017F>hepherds; and
among<U+017F>t all the <U+017F>hepherds you <U+017F>hall be in the fir<U+017F>t place. But of the<U+017F>e two parts, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
Which <U+017F>hall be the prime and the greater? There is no que<U+017F>tion, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi>
but it mu<U+017F>t be that which is to be imployed among<U+017F>t <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es; and with rea<U+017F>on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e

is not one whom I will not love and <U+017F>erve. Then (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e you are
in the right, and that I am too blame for accu<U+017F>ing you of ignorance, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee you are
more knowing then even <hi>Silvander</hi> is.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t they were talking thus, the re<U+017F>t of the company were di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing upon <U+017F>everall

<U+017F>eeing <hi>Calidon</hi> going towards her, and knowing he had a de<U+017F>igne of particular di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
with her, <U+017F>he advanced to interrupt them, and left <hi>Silvander</hi> alone with <hi>Diana;</hi> for as
fortune was, <hi>Paris</hi> de<U+017F>iring to con<U+017F>ult with <hi>Leonide,</hi> he was gone with her to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<U+017F>o as <hi>Silvander</hi> had the opportunity of coming nearer this <U+017F>hephearde<U+017F><U+017F>e, with whom
<hi>Phillis</hi> alwayes <U+017F>tayed, until <hi>Calidon</hi> cau<U+017F>ed her to go away: And becau<U+017F>e there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual

think me jealous, <U+017F>o as I dare not leave this <U+017F>hepherd with you; for I am <U+017F>o confident of
my good fortune, and of his <U+017F>hallow merit, as I do not at all fear him: And to <U+017F>hew the
truth of my words, I will leave you both together, whil<U+017F>t I go and helpe <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> in a great
Combate which I <U+017F>ee <U+017F>he is preparing for, again<U+017F>t an approaching enemy; <U+017F>o without <U+017F>tay
for any an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>he went towards <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who imagining the occa<U+017F>ion of her coming, took
her by the hand, and pulled her <U+017F>o near, as <hi>Calion</hi> could not well acco<U+017F>t her. But that
young <U+017F>hepherd who was really wounded with the beauty of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> could not forbeare
from coming to her: and becau<U+017F>e his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto her were known unto <hi>Phocion,</hi> who
liked very well of it, and was advi<U+017F>ed unto it by <hi>Thamires,</hi> he thought it no matter,
though he <U+017F>poke unto this <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e in the pre<U+017F>ence of any other; and that <hi>Phillis</hi>
perhaps would help him out in the declaration of his minde, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he might think it a
match advantagious to her companion. <hi>Phocion</hi> had already declared him<U+017F>elfe to be of
the <U+017F>ame judgement, who was held to be one of the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Pa<U+017F>tors of his time, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

                     <p>Approaching therefore with this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance unto this faire <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e; Shall I not be

<U+017F>ay it is any prejudice unto my <U+017F>elfe, it cannot be, for on the contrary I <U+017F>hall never enjoy
contentment until it be brought to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. I cannot tell (replyed <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> with a little an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in her eye) what the reque<U+017F>t whereof you <U+017F>peak may be; But if it be any thing that
concerns me, there is none who either ought or can promi<U+017F>e any thing for me again<U+017F>t my
will and con<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>ince my Father and my Mother, to my <U+017F>ad misfortune, are both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away. And as to what you <U+017F>ay concerning <hi>Phocion,</hi> you cannot tell me any thing
of his prudence and wi<U+017F>dome, more then I do know; but this does not conclude him
and I to be both of the <U+017F>ame judgement: and though that his may be the better, yet it
mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ome time before I can con<U+017F>ent unto it Al<U+017F>o to tell you truly, I do believe that
if this wi<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F>tor did know my mind, he would quickly change his opinion; and that is
it, which makes me entreat you to change yours; for if you do continue in it, be<U+017F>ides the
doing of your <U+017F>elf no good, it will draw much di<U+017F>content both upon your <U+017F>elfe, and me.

Fair ones, replyed <hi>Calidon,</hi> are like unto Gods, they will be overcome by <U+017F>upplications.
I cannot tell what fair ones you meane, replyed <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> but I am mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ure, that neither
your words, nor your prayers, will ever obtaine any thing from me that will plea<U+017F>e you.
Perhaps, <U+017F>aid he, that when you <U+017F>ee me even ready to die before your faire face, you will
not be <U+017F>o extreamly cruel as to let no pitty be found among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much beauty. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,

do not think but that I do e<U+017F>teem and honour your merit, as much as I do any <U+017F>hepherd in

                     <p>This An<U+017F>wer was <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olute, that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> amazed the <U+017F>hepherd, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he <U+017F>troke him
dum, and could not reply; and the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>eeing him in <U+017F>uch a confu<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e
up and left <hi>Phillis</hi> in her room: Then <U+017F>he went towards <hi>Alexis,</hi> who <U+017F>eeing her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and knowing by her looks that <U+017F>he was troubled, <U+017F>he left <hi>Hylas</hi> to aske her what the
matter was. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> unto her, with a <U+017F>mile mixed with di<U+017F>daine, you may
think that it is ea<U+017F>ie for me to <U+017F>upport my burthen, but I was never more weary of it in
all my life; for the importunities of the<U+017F>e Lovers are abominably trouble<U+017F>ome. <hi>Calidon</hi>
knows how to chu<U+017F>e his time, and he knowes how well di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of Love does plea<U+017F>e
me: I advi<U+017F>ed him to continue, if he did intend to lo<U+017F>e his labour and his time, and that
perhaps he thought he was <U+017F>peaking unto <hi>Celidea.</hi> Then <U+017F>he related unto the Druid all
the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and the an<U+017F>wer <U+017F>he had given him, with <U+017F>o much pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>aw that

                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Silvander</hi> was with <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>at, and he kneeled, and <U+017F>o over-joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elfe with her, in the ab<U+017F>ence of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> as he could not be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

thank you for this high favour, in <U+017F>taying here with me, whereas you might <U+017F>pend the
time in talk with the<U+017F>e kind <U+017F>hepherds, and fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es? <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, though
I would oblige you, yet in this I do not do it <U+017F>o much as you <U+017F>ay; for I am confident
there is none in all the company, who would not be glad to change places with me: and
I <U+017F>weare <U+017F>hepherd, that I think my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o well, as I would not with them. Did I think,
replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> that your heart is con<U+017F>entant to the harmony of your tongue, I <U+017F>hould
think my <U+017F>elfe the happie<U+017F>t <U+017F>hepherd in the Univer<U+017F>e. If that be all thats wanting to make
you happy, replyed <U+017F>he, be confident <hi>Silvander,</hi> that then you are as happy as you can
wi<U+017F>h. What a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> can I have of it? You are a per<U+017F>on of <U+017F>o much
judgement, an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, as you will quickly find the truth of it, if you
will but be plea<U+017F>ed to look for it; or if you could not, what el<U+017F>e, do you think could <U+017F>tay
me here? I could find excu<U+017F>es in abundance to go away; But I rather fear, <hi>Silvander,</hi> that
I am weary<U+017F>ome to you, and that it is onely civility which keeps you here with me:
Faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander</hi> pre<U+017F>ently, This exce<U+017F>s of kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e which you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
to <U+017F>hew me, does but offend me, <U+017F>ince if you have that opinion of me, or think me a
man of <U+017F>o weak a judgement, you doe a manife<U+017F>t wrong unto your and my affection;
for certainly I were a man without common <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, if I did not <U+017F>ee the perfections of the
faire <hi>Diana,</hi> which every one that <U+017F>ees, confe<U+017F><U+017F>es, and admires. Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
<U+017F>hould be the onely man that is blind? Can he not <U+017F>ee the Sun when it <U+017F>hines? But
the truth is, I am <U+017F>o dazled with <U+017F>o great a light when I am with you, as I have no eyes
but onely to <U+017F>ee, nor <U+017F>pirit, but onely to adore divine <hi>Diana</hi> upon earth, whom I hold
tran<U+017F>cendent to her in the heavens, <U+017F>ince the one is <U+017F>urmounted in Glory by the Sun her

what I am: but who would ever have thought, that the wager which you undertook,
could in<U+017F>pire you with <U+017F>uch fained expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. But as to your wager with <hi>Phillis;</hi> how

Judge? Tho<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions wherewith I am in<U+017F>pired, replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> are <U+017F>o full of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53527:55"/>
reallity, as they have no dependance upon the wager: And as for the name of Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e,
whereof you <U+017F>peake: beleeve it faire <hi>Diana,</hi> that you may take the name of Judge when
you plea<U+017F>e, but never can <U+017F>hake off the name of Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, which not the wager, nor fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but your perfections and my affection have <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>tly gotten upon my <U+017F>oule. I have
formerly told you, replyed the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that I allow you to <U+017F>peake thus untill the
wager be decided; but pray tell me, when <U+017F>hall we all three be di<U+017F>charged of this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e?
For it has continued <U+017F>o long that the term of three Months is almo<U+017F>t doubled. For my part
<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> I <U+017F>hall neither prolong nor retard the time, being a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that come when
it will, I <U+017F>hal not alter my condition. Do not talk of the future, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> but with doubt,
<U+017F>ince none but the gods can tell what it will produce, but tell me <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>hall we imploy
the afternoon in ending the difference? I conceive it a convenient opportunity, and we <U+017F>hall
have as good a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, as we can de<U+017F>ire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvander</hi> knowing that he could not hope to live with her in <U+017F>uch freedome, when
this fiction was taken away, he made a <U+017F>top, and did not returne an an<U+017F>wer to the <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
which <U+017F>he perceiving how he was perplexed, it did the more a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her of his
affection; but feigning, as before accu<U+017F>tomed; why do you not give me an an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>hepherd,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, would you have us take this convenient opportunity, or would you have it defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
untill to morrow when we are at our owne Town? See what a tractable Judge I am,
I refer it unto your will. My Judge, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, before I give an an<U+017F>wer
I be<U+017F>eech you let <U+017F>ome Articles pa<U+017F><U+017F>e betwixt us; promi<U+017F>e me that your judgement <U+017F>hall
pa<U+017F><U+017F>e to my advantage, and that the thing which is mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ing to me, may not be
forbidden me, and then if you plea<U+017F>e I will receive your doome before I depart from this
place. My judgement, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>hall be ju<U+017F>t; and as for the forbidding which you <U+017F>o
much feare, let me under<U+017F>tand what you meane, and I will an<U+017F>wer you. <hi>Silvander</hi> then
a<U+017F><U+017F>uming a more <U+017F>erious looke: I never had the lea<U+017F>t doubt, <U+017F>aid he, but that you would
be mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t; but give me leave to tell you, that extream ju<U+017F>tice, is extreame injury; and
becau<U+017F>e you de<U+017F>ire an expo<U+017F>ition upon my <U+017F>econd reque<U+017F>t, I conceive Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, continued
he, and <U+017F>miled, that it is be<U+017F>t to defer the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e untill another time, to the end, I may
have the more time to informe my Judge: Upon this, they were interrupted by <hi>Adamas,</hi>
who invited <hi>Daphnide</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the company to goe and walke; for the heat of the
day being over, it was more plea<U+017F>ant abroad than in the hou<U+017F>e. And mo<U+017F>t of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being de<U+017F>irous to take the Aire, the delight<U+017F>omene<U+017F><U+017F>e of the place inviting them, they
all <U+017F>et forward, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>inging, and others di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing upon <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ubjects as be<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ed them.</p>
                     <p>The Cavalier who was clo<U+017F>e by the Temple of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> taking the <U+017F>ame way that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
went, he came pre<U+017F>ent to the bridge of <hi>Botereux,</hi> and a little after to the height of
the Plaine which di<U+017F>covered the Ca<U+017F>tle, and great Cittie of <hi>Marcellies.</hi> The Country
<U+017F>eemed very delectable unto him: For on the one <U+017F>ide he <U+017F>aw the fertile Hils of <hi>Cou<U+017F>ant,</hi>
which from the tops to the bottomes were enricht with many Vineyards, and upon the
tops of all, great Woods, which Nature had placed there to fence them from blu<U+017F>tering
winds; The Plaine extended it <U+017F>elfe as farre as <hi>Mont Bri<U+017F>on,</hi> and following tho<U+017F>e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
Hils enlarged it <U+017F>elfe towards <hi>Surida,</hi> Mount <hi>Round</hi> and <hi>Feurs,</hi> with <U+017F>o many
little Rivolets and Lakes, that the variety made the pro<U+017F>pect beyond imagination plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant:
And becau<U+017F>e the way in which he was, conducted to <hi>Marcellies,</hi> and his face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that way, it was the fir<U+017F>t place his eye fell upon. The Ca<U+017F>tle, <U+017F>cituated upon the point
of a Rock, which made it obvious to the eye, and <U+017F>een farre, did pre<U+017F>ently bring into his
memory, the place where he fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw <hi>Madonthe:</hi> For its grandure, its Towers and
magnificence of <U+017F>tructure had a great re<U+017F>emblance of the place where <U+017F>he dwelt. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum
brought into his fancy the many plea<U+017F>ing pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages which formerly he had <U+017F>een
with her, and the extream perplexities and <U+017F>orrows he had <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained <U+017F>ince his di<U+017F>grace: And
becau<U+017F>e this compari<U+017F>on could not chu<U+017F>e but much trouble his mind, this poor Cavalier was
con<U+017F>trained to lite from his hor<U+017F>e, and re<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf under the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hade he found, where lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Hor<U+017F>e with his Servant, he went under a <U+017F>hady tree, he lifted his eyes up to heaven,
&amp; <U+017F>tood <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>hed in contemplation, as he could neither hear, nor <U+017F>ee anything about him</p>
                     <p>The Servant, who did exceedingly love his Ma<U+017F>ter, and was <U+017F>orry in his <U+017F>oule to <U+017F>ee
what a mi<U+017F>erable life he lived, did heartily cur<U+017F>e love, and her that was the cau<U+017F>e of it.
By fortune at the <U+017F>ame time, hearing a voice, he began to li<U+017F>ten, and <U+017F>tepping a little
neerer <U+017F>aw a Cavalier complaining again<U+017F>t the ingratitude and incon<U+017F>tancy of a Lady.
And becau<U+017F>e he thought this would be a good excu<U+017F>e to make him retire from his <U+017F>ad
thoughts. Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto him, hearken I be<U+017F>eech you unto the Cavalier is <U+017F>inging who
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53527:55"/>
is neer you. Away, away, <U+017F>aid he, I care not for medling with the matters of another:
Do<U+017F>t thou not thinke I have enough to doe with my owne? The bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of another,
Sir, replyed the Servant, may doe good if good u<U+017F>e be made of them: Upon this they
hearkned, and heard the Cavalier <U+017F>inging a very invective <U+017F>ong again<U+017F>t his owne Lady,
and again<U+017F>t all others.</p>
                     <p>The one Cavalier hearing the other blame all women again<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on for the fault of one
was much offended again<U+017F>t him for it, taxing him with indi<U+017F>cretion and inju<U+017F>tice: And
thinking that if he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer it without revenge, and let <U+017F>uch bla<U+017F>phemies pa<U+017F><U+017F>e unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed,
he <U+017F>hould commit a great fault again<U+017F>t the faire <hi>Madonthe:</hi> And therefore he
would pre<U+017F>ently make him eat his words, and cry mercy for the injurious language he had
uttered; but upon better con<U+017F>ideration he thought it more expedient to give him occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <U+017F>eeking Combate; for, <U+017F>aid he, if he be couragious, he will re<U+017F>ent the offence I <U+017F>hall
give, and require <U+017F>atisfaction, and if he be a Coward, he is not worthy my fighting with
him. In this re<U+017F>olution, the Cavalier ro<U+017F>e up, and turning towards the other Cavalier,
after he had a little con<U+017F>idered what he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, he <U+017F>ung in as loud, and di<U+017F>tinct a voice
as he could, a <U+017F>ong which intimated, That <U+017F>ince he <U+017F>aw how incon<U+017F>tant his Lady was,
it was his part either to die, or el<U+017F>e cure him<U+017F>elfe with di<U+017F>daine of her.</p>
                     <p>This being di<U+017F>tinctly heard by the other Cavalier, he could not chu<U+017F>e but thinke that
the<U+017F>e words were intended again<U+017F>t him. And being one of the mo<U+017F>t couragious Cavali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in all that Country, he tooke it for <U+017F>uch an affront, that without more adoe, he
pulled downe his Helmet (for he was armed <hi>Capape</hi>) and went through the Wood to
the place from whence the voice came.</p>
                     <p>The other, who expected to <U+017F>ee what effects his an<U+017F>wer would produce as <U+017F>oone as he
<U+017F>aw him coming, and being re<U+017F>olved that if he did not re<U+017F>ent his words, he would adde
<U+017F>uch as <U+017F>hould provoke him to fight But the arrogance of him with whom he had to do
was <U+017F>uch, as he needed <U+017F>mall provocations, as well becau<U+017F>e he was confident of his own
<U+017F>trength &amp; skill, as becau<U+017F>e he was Nephew unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> who<U+017F>e authority was <U+017F>o heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<U+017F>ince the departure of <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as he was neere the capacity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him<U+017F>elfe ab<U+017F>olute Lord of the <hi>Segu<U+017F>ians.</hi> The name of this Cavalier was <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus;</hi>
he was taller than the common height, and <U+017F>o well proportioned every way, as it
was ea<U+017F>ie to judge him a man of great <U+017F>trength and courage. He had long courted one of
<hi>Galatheas</hi> Nimphs, and whether it was true or no, I know not, but <U+017F>o it was, that he
thought <U+017F>he loved him: her name was <hi>Silere,</hi> one that was very faire and highly han<U+017F>ome;
but when he was urgent with her for <U+017F>ome te<U+017F>timony of her good will, and when <U+017F>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him, he according to his arrogant humour would needs u<U+017F>e a kind of authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her; which <U+017F>he taking very ill, <U+017F>he cho<U+017F>e rather to break quite off with him, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer to endure his arrogancy. He <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elfe deceived in his hopes, fell into
<U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of anger again<U+017F>t her as he conceived an extreame hatred again<U+017F>t all women
what<U+017F>oever for her <U+017F>ake, and ever <U+017F>ince, did vent the mo<U+017F>t bitter invectives again<U+017F>t them,
that he could invent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argenteus</hi> then, according to his cu<U+017F>tome, arrogantly approaching the other Cavalier
without any <U+017F>alute or action of civility, was it to me Cavalier (<U+017F>aid he) that you inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
your <U+017F>ong. The Stranger who naturally could not put up any incivility, and being
already ill <U+017F>atisfied with him; Take it as you will, <U+017F>aid he unto him, I perceive by your
armes and your language, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Argenteus</hi>) that you are a Stranger: For did you know
me, you would give me another an<U+017F>wer; but <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o, either get upon your Hor<U+017F>e,
or el<U+017F>e be as you are on foot, and I will make you know your folly and ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F><U+017F>e. Then
lo<U+017F>e no time (<U+017F>aid the Stranger) but on foot let us end the difference: Upon this he <U+017F>tept
into the high way, he drew his <U+017F>word, and <U+017F>tood in <U+017F>uch a bold po<U+017F>ture that <hi>Argenteus</hi>
judged him to be a brave Cavalier.</p>
                     <p>When they were ready to begin fight, they heard a great noi<U+017F>e of Hor<U+017F>es and Coaches,
which came from <hi>Marcelleis</hi> <U+017F>traight towards them. This moved <hi>Damon</hi> to <U+017F>ay, that
he thought it better to goe into the Wood, and let the Company pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, lea<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould
be interrupted: But <hi>Argenteus</hi> who did imagine that it was <hi>Galathea</hi> or <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and
was very de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>hew his valour: No, no, Cavalier, <U+017F>aid he, never let us hide our
<U+017F>elves but when we do ill, and therefore as you <U+017F>ay, let us lo<U+017F>e no time, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e your heart
faile you to maintaine your quarrell My quarrell, <U+017F>aid he is <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t, that though in other
occa<U+017F>ions I had no courage, yet I <U+017F>hould in this, not only again<U+017F>t you, but again<U+017F>t all men
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53527:56"/>
living. But if as you <U+017F>ay, ill actions ought to be hid, I know not a place dark enough to
hide yours, who maintaines a thing <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>o unworthy the name of a Cavalier,
in blaming Ladies whom every Cavalier is obliged to maintain, <U+017F>erve, and defend. Alas
my good friend, <U+017F>aid <hi>Arganteus,</hi> and mocked him, how long have you been a high-way
Orator:<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> It is with this, <U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>hewed him his <U+017F>word; that I u<U+017F>e to <U+017F>peak; and if
you have courage, you <U+017F>hall find that I can doe better then you can <U+017F>peak.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, they fell on very furiou<U+017F>ly, and as <U+017F>tout a Combate it was, as could be <U+017F>een
betwixt two valiant Cavaliers: They were no <U+017F>ooner warmed in the fight, but all the
company, whom they <U+017F>aw coming, arrived at the place: And becau<U+017F>e the Combat was
in the high way, and every one knew <hi>Arganteus,</hi> they <U+017F>topped to <U+017F>ee what would be the
i<U+017F><U+017F>ue. <hi>Galathea,</hi> who was in the Coach with the Nymphs, did hate the arrogance of
<hi>Arganteus,</hi> and they all wi<U+017F>hed he might be puni<U+017F>hed for it by this <U+017F>tranger. But know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his great valour, <U+017F>trength and skill, they were much afraid he would be too hard for
this unknown Gavalier, though his han<U+017F>ome pre<U+017F>ence and good beginning got him a
good opinion among<U+017F>t them. <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Polemas</hi> near her Coach, called unto him,
and asked who it was which was fighting with <hi>Arganteus,</hi> and what was the cau<U+017F>e of
the quarrel, and whether it were not be<U+017F>t to part them? To which he an<U+017F>wered, That it
was injurious to hinder them from ending their difference, <U+017F>ince they fought upon equall
terms, and without treachery: And as to the Cavalier and their Quarrel, he could meet
with none that could inform him, but the <U+017F>ervant unto the <U+017F>tranger. <hi>Polemas</hi> an<U+017F>wered thus,
becau<U+017F>e he was very confident in the valour of <hi>Arganteus,</hi> and that the <U+017F>tranger would
not be able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t him: and he was very de<U+017F>irous that <hi>Galathea</hi> might <U+017F>ee the valour
and courage of tho<U+017F>e that had relation unto him. But <U+017F>he according to the curio<U+017F>ity of
all Ladies, being de<U+017F>irous to know who this <U+017F>tranger was, cau<U+017F>ed his <U+017F>ervant to be called
unto her, whom <U+017F>he asked who that <U+017F>trange Cavalier was, and how the quarrell began.
The cau<U+017F>e of their quarrel, Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, is very ju<U+017F>t on my Ma<U+017F>ters <U+017F>ide; For he
hearing that other Cavalier <U+017F>peaking very ill of all women, he could not endure it, as
thinking it again<U+017F>t the honour of a Cavalier: But as for telling you who he is, I am
<U+017F>orry it is forbidden me; yet I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elfe, that as <U+017F>oon as the Combat is ended, he is
<U+017F>o civil as to <U+017F>atisfie your demands. <hi>Polemas</hi> laughed to hear him <U+017F>peak thus, and in
mockery <U+017F>aid unto him; well <U+017F>aid my good friend, thou art in the right, when thou <U+017F>aid<U+017F>t,
my Lady <U+017F>hould know, when the Combate is ended; for his Epitaph upon his Tomb will
tell her. Sir, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>ervant to him, if my Ma<U+017F>ter had not come off a more dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpri<U+017F>e
then this, he would never have been able to come <U+017F>o farre as he hath done upon
this he retired to the place where he <U+017F>tood before.</p>
                     <p>During this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the two Cavaliers continued the fight mo<U+017F>t furiou<U+017F>ly; and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
had <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>ire to come off with honour, as there was not a by-<U+017F>tander, who did
not e<U+017F>teem him a very brave Cavalier, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Galathea,</hi> and her Nymphs, in who<U+017F>e
eyes might their contentments be <U+017F>een, when <hi>Damon</hi> got any advantage, which they
would not di<U+017F><U+017F>emble though <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>tood by, becau<U+017F>e it was their cau<U+017F>e in which he
fought.</p>
                     <p>It was now near half an hour <U+017F>ince they fir<U+017F>t began blows, theirs Arms were broken and
<U+017F>hattered in <U+017F>everal places, when <hi>Argantens</hi> felt him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>omething faint, and was not
<U+017F>o nimble, nor laid on <U+017F>uch vigorous blows. On the contrary, <hi>Damon</hi> did not onely
<U+017F>eem hearty and fre<U+017F>h, but did rather increa<U+017F>e in vigour and agility, which did exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
trouble <hi>Polemas,</hi> but more <hi>Arganteus,</hi> who did now begin to e<U+017F>teem his enemy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
highly; but pre<U+017F>enly after, the <U+017F>trangers <U+017F>word did reach his body almo<U+017F>t at every
blow, <U+017F>o as <hi>Arganteus</hi> fainted down right, either by rea<U+017F>on of the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of blood, or
greatne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his wounds. Now <hi>Polemas</hi> did heartily repent that he did not part them
at the beginning of the Combate, and wi<U+017F>hed that <U+017F>ome good genius would move <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
to interrupt them: <U+017F>he who perceived how <hi>Polemas</hi> was troubled, although <U+017F>he did
not love him, yet would give him this <U+017F>atisfaction in re<U+017F>pect of the <U+017F>ervice he did her
Mother; and knowing no better way to part the<U+017F>e Cavaliers, then by entreating them her
<U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he came out of her Coach, and withal her Nymphs came to the Combatants; At
the very <U+017F>ame time <hi>Arganteus</hi> not being able to <U+017F>u<U+017F>taine him<U+017F>elfe, fell on his knee, and
<U+017F>eemed as if at the <U+017F>ight of the<U+017F>e Ladies, he had done it purpo<U+017F>ely to ask them pardon
for the injury he had done unto women. But becau<U+017F>e <hi>Polemas</hi> thought <hi>Galathea</hi> too
<U+017F>low, and that his Nephew who drooped already, would be quite di<U+017F>honoured if he <U+017F>tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53527:56"/>
any longer; he made a <U+017F>ign unto <U+017F>ome of his <U+017F>ervants, who pre<U+017F>ently gallopped, and
fell upon <hi>Damon,</hi> who never <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting <U+017F>uch treachery, nor had <U+017F>o much as looked back
but for the cry of <hi>Galathea</hi> and the Nimphs, towards whom turning his head, he <U+017F>aw
<U+017F>even or eight Cavaliers coming towards him with <U+017F>words in their hands, and menacing
him. All he could do, was to recoil unto his <U+017F>ervant; but his courage was mo<U+017F>t high
and admirable <U+017F>ince coming out of this Combate, after which he <U+017F>tood in need of re<U+017F>t;
as <U+017F>oon as his <U+017F>ervant brought him his Hor<U+017F>e, he vaulted into the <U+017F>addle without any
<U+017F>tirrup; and he <U+017F>tood in need of all his agilitie to <U+017F>ave him<U+017F>elfe from the hurt they would
have done him; for he was no <U+017F>ooner in his <U+017F>addle, and the bridle in his hand, but he had
them all upon him, do what <hi>Galethea</hi> could, who was much terrified with all her Nimphs
among<U+017F>t all the hor<U+017F>es. As for <hi>Polemas,</hi> he faigned that he never <U+017F>aw the confu<U+017F>ion, being
with <hi>Arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the mean time, the<U+017F>e Cavaliers did <U+017F>o a<U+017F><U+017F>ault this <U+017F>tranger, as though at two blowes
he <U+017F>ent two of them out of the Combat, yet could he not prevent a wound in his <U+017F>houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and his hor<U+017F>e from being killed under him, with <U+017F>everal blowes which they gave him
in his flank. The <U+017F>tranger perceiving him to faint under him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> let go his <U+017F>tirrops, and jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
nimbly upon the ground, which helped him very well, for the Hor<U+017F>es of his enemies
would not come near unto his being dead; yet it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>ave him<U+017F>elf long, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<U+017F>ome unexpected helpe.</p>
                     <p>The Nimph who <U+017F>aw <U+017F>uch ba<U+017F>e injury done unto this Cavalier, and not being able to
endure it, <U+017F>he cryed, and threatned the men of <hi>Polemas;</hi> but one among<U+017F>t their who
commanded the re<U+017F>t, and to whom he had made a <U+017F>igne, knowing his ma<U+017F>ters will, and
<U+017F>eeming as if he did not heare <hi>Galathea,</hi> did <U+017F>till command them to kill the Cavalier;
when, as fortune was, one of the Lions of the Fountain of Loves Verity, <U+017F>eeking for his
prey came among<U+017F>t the hor<U+017F>es.</p>
                     <p>This Lion was <U+017F>o great and terrible, that all the Hor<U+017F>es when they <U+017F>aw him come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
them, took <U+017F>uch a fright, as there was neither Cavaliere nor Servant that could
be ma<U+017F>ter of his own, but all ran away. That of <hi>Polemas</hi> and the <U+017F>trangers <U+017F>ervant, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the bridle in their teeths, they ran as far as the Town of <hi>Boen,</hi> no Bridge, no Gate, no
Hedge, nothing could <U+017F>top them; tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>tayed with the Coaches, took <U+017F>uch a flight,
that they never <U+017F>tayed till they were above a league from the place, where they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned,
and all the Coaches and Harne<U+017F><U+017F>es torne in pieces; <U+017F>o as it was a thing impo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
to bring them back that day: as for <hi>Arganteus,</hi> they had <U+017F>et him on hor<U+017F>e-back,
but he was not able to hold him<U+017F>elfe on, <U+017F>o as being for<U+017F>aken by all tho<U+017F>e who held him,
at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tart of the hor<U+017F>e he fell down, and <U+017F>o unluckily, as he broke his neck: Thus
ended the proude<U+017F>t, and mo<U+017F>t arrogant Cavalier in all the Country, and his hor<U+017F>e by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
running away for fear, and almo<U+017F>t over the <U+017F>tranger, he ran him through the body
with his <U+017F>word, and he fell down dead by his Ma<U+017F>ter. The Nimph thanked God for this
encounter, for <U+017F>he knew that the Lion would not doe any harme, being <U+017F>o inchanted as
he could not offend any, but tho<U+017F>e who would try the adventure. And yet pre<U+017F>ently after
<U+017F>he was driven into feare; for the Lion who came onely to <U+017F>eek for his prey of food, <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <U+017F>trangers hor<U+017F>e dead, he began to eat upon him: But the Cavaliere having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<U+017F>o much good fortune from him, thought it a kind of ingratitude to <U+017F>een him torn in
pieces without defending him; he went towards him with his <U+017F>word drawn, which the
Nimph <U+017F>eeing, and fearing le<U+017F>t the Lion being provoked <U+017F>hould hurt him, <U+017F>he cryed out,
and entreated him not to go any further: But he could not endure this indignity, he
went <U+017F>traight to the Lion, but becau<U+017F>e his back was towards him he would not <U+017F>trike him
behind, and made him turne the other way: The furious bea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elfe threatned
with a <U+017F>word, he leapt a<U+017F>ide, as if he would have run towards the Nimphs, which the
Cavalier fearing, he was much more exa<U+017F>perated to interpo<U+017F>e betwixt them, <U+017F>o as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
who was <U+017F>till before him, began to roar out extreamly, beating his taile again<U+017F>t the
ground, grinning with his teeth and <U+017F>parkling eyes, he <U+017F>eemed as if he would pre<U+017F>ently
fall upon him, and but for the inthantment, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e, he had; But that force being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
his, he was con<U+017F>trained to turne aboue, and went to feed upon the hor<U+017F>e of <hi>Argan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus,</hi>
of which after he was <U+017F>atisfied, he carried part of the re<U+017F>t, according to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tome,
unto the other Lion which guarded the Fountaine. The Cavaliere <U+017F>eeing the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
going towards <hi>Arganteus,</hi> and fearing le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould devour his body, he <U+017F>tood by it,
and guarded it, not being willing the Corps of <U+017F>o crave a Cavalier <U+017F>hould be abu<U+017F>ed<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>

But when he <U+017F>aw him gone, then he went to the Nymphs, who having beene Spectators

imagining it to be her, as well by her Maje<U+017F>tical deportment, as by the honour which all did

and be<U+017F>eech you not to refu<U+017F>e it at my reque<U+017F>t Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, it mu<U+017F>t be you that mu<U+017F>t for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them, <U+017F>ince it is you whom they have offended; It is not the part of the<U+017F>e Ladies
and my <U+017F>elfe to deny you any thing you <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e to aske, <U+017F>ince you have <U+017F>o well defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us again<U+017F>t this di<U+017F>courteous Cavalier; and would have defended us from the Lyon;
but we will <U+017F>peake of this another time. In the interim I thinke you have received a
wound in your <U+017F>houlder, it is requi<U+017F>ite the blood <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>topped, untill we come to a
place where the wound may be dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed. The wound whereof you <U+017F>peake Madam, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, is but a <U+017F>cratch; and all that you plea<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ay I have done for you, is farre <U+017F>hort
of what low, and which I would mo<U+017F>t willingly pay in your <U+017F>ervice: But <U+017F>ince all your
company is <U+017F>cattered<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I be<U+017F>eech you give me leave to conduct you unto <U+017F>ome place of <U+017F>afty,
for I perceive this Country is not without very dangerous Bea<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>o as it is not <U+017F>afe to go
without good guard. <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>miled, and <U+017F>aid: I perceive Sir that you are a Stranger
<U+017F>ince you doe not know this Lyon to be inchanted, <U+017F>o as he will doe no harm unto any
unle<U+017F><U+017F>e unto <U+017F>uch who will try the adventure of the Fountaine which he guards, and had
you not provoked him, he would not <U+017F>o much as have looked towards us. I could not
endure, <U+017F>aid he, that he <U+017F>hould tear my Hor<U+017F>e in pieces before my face, much more that
Cavalier, who though indi<U+017F>creet, yet was very valiant and couragious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvia,</hi> who pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed behind this Cavalier to looke upon his wound, tooke notice that
it bled <U+017F>till which cau<U+017F>ed her to <U+017F>ay unto <hi>Galathea;</hi> Madam, you talke too much unto
this Cavalier, for he bleeds very fa<U+017F>t: Then they went all unto him, and almo<U+017F>t by force
bound up his wound with their Handkerchers and made him a Scarfe to hold up his arm.
Then <hi>Galathea</hi> conceived, that <U+017F>ince their Coaches came not, that it was the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e
to walke gently unto <hi>Mount Verdan,</hi> where they might conveniently <U+017F>tay, doubting that
the Coaches were overturned and broken: And becau<U+017F>e the way was but <U+017F>hort and very
faire, all the Nymphs approved of the motion; and therefore the Cavalier tooke <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
by one arme, and <hi>Silvia</hi> tooke her by the other; and all the re<U+017F>t followed, di<U+017F>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
upon nothing el<U+017F>e but the valour and merit of this Stranger: <U+017F>ome extolled his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
others blamed the wrong that had beene done him; Some admired his boldne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
and others could not highly enough e<U+017F>teeme him for defending his dead Hor<U+017F>e, and his
intention to defend the Corps of <hi>Arganteus?</hi> But all de<U+017F>ired mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately to know
who he was, <U+017F>uch extraordinary favour had his valour purcha<U+017F>ed him among<U+017F>t the
Ladies.</p>
                     <p>He had not yet pulled up his Helmet, and walked on as if he did not intend it; when
<hi>Silvia</hi> ob<U+017F>erving the curio<U+017F>ity of all her companions: Is it not <U+017F>trange Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
that we <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o much obliged to this brave Cavalier, and neither know his Name
nor his face: If you plea<U+017F>e, we will make tryall of his courte<U+017F>ie as we have already of his
valour: for he walkes on with his Helmet downe as if he were yet in hand with <hi>Argan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus.</hi>
The Cavalier not <U+017F>taying for <hi>Galatheas</hi> an<U+017F>wer, an<U+017F>wered: For my face, Madam,
it <U+017F>hall not be concealed from you if it plea<U+017F>e you; but as for my name, I be<U+017F>eech you let
it be concealed <U+017F>till, becau<U+017F>e I am <U+017F>ure you know it not. To which <hi>Galathea</hi> an<U+017F>wered;
You may, noble Cavalier content us in both, if you plea<U+017F>e, and indeed you ought not to
make any difficulty of it: For <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ay we doe not know it, you may <U+017F>hew it and
<U+017F>atisfie us, and yet it is no more known than before. I <U+017F>ee Madam, replyed he, that it is
an ea<U+017F>ier thing to vangui<U+017F>h Cavaliers, be they never <U+017F>o valiant, than to defend ones <U+017F>elfe
again<U+017F>t faire Ladies. I will therefore addre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe unto <U+017F>upplications; and of two
things which you aske I will <U+017F>atisfie you in one pre<U+017F>ently, and be<U+017F>eech you to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>er the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
untill we come to <hi>Mount Verdan.</hi> It <U+017F>hall be then, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> upon condition
of granting one thing which I will aske you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:53527:57"/>
There is nothing Madam, which you can command, replyed the Cavalier which I will
not obey, and <U+017F>atisfie withall my power. Upon this, lifting up his Helme, he appeared
to be very faire, he was young, and his paines in the combate had put <U+017F>uch a fre<U+017F>h colour
in his cheekes, as none could by his face <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his <U+017F>oule; and this was the
rea<U+017F>on, that all <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o very faire, they were the more impatient to know who he
was: And had they not <U+017F>eene the aged <hi>Cleontine</hi> coming with a great number of Virgin
Druids, with <U+017F>ome of the <hi>Vaci</hi> and <hi>Eubagi</hi> mo<U+017F>t certainely they had gotten him, not
onely to tell his Name, but al<U+017F>o what fortune brought him thither: But he an<U+017F>wered,
how one ought never to de<U+017F>paire of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from heaven, e<U+017F>pecially when one has right
on their <U+017F>ide.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t they were talking thus, the <U+017F>age <hi>Cleontine</hi> was come <U+017F>o neer, as <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>tep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
a little before, received her in her armes, and held her <U+017F>o whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid; What doe
you thinke Mother of the Equipage in which we come? I doe not thinke you expected us
in this manner I did not expect Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> that you <U+017F>hould take <U+017F>o much
paines as to come <U+017F>o farre to <U+017F>ee me, for when you have any <U+017F>ervice for me, you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me to come unto you; but you doe honour our great <hi>Tautates</hi> in conde<U+017F>cending
unto <U+017F>o much humility, as coming unto this <U+017F>acred place, where it plea<U+017F>eth him to render
Oracles. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that my de<U+017F>ign was to come hither, but not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon.
Upon this <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>aluted the Virgin Druids; and afterwards, continuing her way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Mount Verdan,</hi> and not <U+017F>eeing <hi>Celidea</hi> among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he asked where <U+017F>he was:
Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her, never was a more happy marriage, than that between <hi>Thami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
and her; and I doe not thinke that any who <U+017F>ees them but doe de<U+017F>ire to marry: And
what's become of <hi>Calidon,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Nymph: Oh Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cleontine,</hi> he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured of the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e which <U+017F>he cau<U+017F>ed in him, he has now no other thoughts but
of marrying <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> How, replyed the Nymph, will <hi>Calidon</hi> marry <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and is <U+017F>he
con<U+017F>enting? who is it that makes this match? It is, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>Phocion,</hi> Uncle to <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
and <hi>Thamires,</hi> who is very <U+017F>olicitous in it, but I am affraid it will hardly be a match:
For <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is <U+017F>o aver<U+017F>e unto it, as they will have much adoe to get her con<U+017F>ent. And
why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> does <U+017F>he love any other Shepherd? We do not heare, replyed <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontine,</hi>
that <U+017F>he loves any yet, for <U+017F>he is too bu<U+017F>ie in lamenting her lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and
erecting him a Tombe. What is become of that <U+017F>hepherd, <U+017F>aid the Nymph: I thinke
Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> that about <U+017F>even or eight Months <U+017F>ince, he was drowned: And
why, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, doe they make him an empty Tombe? Becau<U+017F>e Madam (<U+017F>aid
<hi>Cleontine</hi>) that the learned Sarronides and Druids tell us the <U+017F>pirit of him who dies, will
wander and walke many ages if tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>urvive doe not pay the office of Sepulture:
And becau<U+017F>e the body of <hi>Celadon</hi> was not found, they erected him this empty Tombe of
which I told you: How, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> when he was drowned, and his body lo<U+017F>t,
was it never <U+017F>ince found? Never Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> that we could hear of, and it is
to be beleeved that all the <U+017F>hepherds about u<U+017F>ed all endeavours po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; for never was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<U+017F>hepherd in this Country more beloved, nor any truly more de<U+017F>erved it: And Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
had he been <U+017F>o happy as to be known unto you. I am confident you would have
thought him <U+017F>o. And as I hear, this <U+017F>hepherd had a long time beene a devoted <U+017F>ervant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> but carried the matter <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e and di<U+017F>creetly as none could perceive it; and
the le<U+017F><U+017F>e becau<U+017F>e it was unlikely ever any love <U+017F>hould be betwixt them by rea<U+017F>on of an
inveterate enmity that had long been betwixt their Fathers: And becau<U+017F>e clo<U+017F>e and <U+017F>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
love is alwayes mo<U+017F>t violent, probably <U+017F>o was theirs, both in that re<U+017F>pect, and in
re<U+017F>pect of both their merits: For I dare <U+017F>ay Madam, and with abundance of truth that I
never in all my life <U+017F>aw a fairer nor more accompli<U+017F>hed <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e. Now <hi>Phocion,</hi> who
is her Uncle, and who, as next of kin, has the care of her, would gladly marry her unto
<hi>Calidon,</hi> who indeed is a very fine <U+017F>hepherd; but there is <U+017F>o much difference betwixt him
and <hi>Celadon,</hi> as it is very unlikely, that <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e will ever con<U+017F>ent e<U+017F>pecially having
yet <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h in her memory; yet <hi>Calidon</hi> <U+017F>till hopes, and keepes as clo<U+017F>e to her as
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he can<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> As for <hi>Thamires,</hi> he lives the mo<U+017F>t happily and be<U+017F>t contented of any
man in the world, and <U+017F>ayes that the <U+017F>cars of <hi>Celideas</hi> face being te<U+017F>timonies of her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
doe make her so faire and amiable, as he cannot de<U+017F>ire her otherwi<U+017F>e; and in this
contentment, he is <U+017F>o well <U+017F>atisfied, as he cannot be an inch from her: I am very <U+017F>orry
<U+017F>he is not here, that <U+017F>he might have the honour of ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing your hand, as much disfigured
and ill favoured as <U+017F>he is. But <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana, Phillis,</hi> and other <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53527:58"/>
neighbouring Towns, are the cau<U+017F>es of her mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing this honour, having ye<U+017F>terday invited
her to vi<U+017F>it the Daughter of <hi>Adamas,</hi> who is returned from the virgin Druids of <hi>Carnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and reputed one of the faire<U+017F>t Ladies, and the mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>creet in all the Country. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea, Celidea</hi> will return at night, then we may <U+017F>ee her. I wi<U+017F>h it, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cleontine;</hi> but I am afraid that <hi>Thamires</hi> who accompanies her, is the
cau<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>tay; for it being late, he will not let her travell, becau<U+017F>e he is extreamly
careful of her health; be<U+017F>ides, I know the venerable <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante</hi> will not let her part from
<hi>Bonlieu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Galathea,</hi> without <U+017F>eeming to take any great notice of things, gleaned from the
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Cleontine,</hi> all the <U+017F>tate of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and of his love; yet much wondring that
none <U+017F>hould know what was become of him. Then con<U+017F>idering with her <U+017F>elfe that this
<U+017F>hepherd not being in this Country, <U+017F>he was to blame in accu<U+017F>ing <hi>Leonide,</hi> <U+017F>he intended
to call her unto her again, and in order thereunto re<U+017F>olved to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e by the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
as well to bring her away with her, as in hopes to meet <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> there, of whom <U+017F>he
had heard <U+017F>o much, to the end <U+017F>he might judge, whether her beauty was <U+017F>uch as might
invite <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>o much to <U+017F>light hers. In the<U+017F>e thoughts <U+017F>he could not refraine from <U+017F>igh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very loud, which <hi>Cleontine</hi> ob<U+017F>erving; Oh Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, why do you <U+017F>igh? Is there
any thing which troubles you? <hi>Galathea</hi> having no mind <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be the <U+017F>ecretary of

is, and there are many occa<U+017F>ions of danger to cau<U+017F>e feare of his being well. It is many
dayes <U+017F>ince either <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> or I heard from him; and of late the <hi>Vaci</hi> tell us, that when they
look into the intrals of the Victims, they find the mo<U+017F>t noble parts defective: Moreover,
I have had <U+017F>ome very horrid Dreams, and believe it, the<U+017F>e things much trouble me. My
Mother al<U+017F>o, who is fuller of apprehen<U+017F>ions then I am, hath thought it fit we <U+017F>hould offer
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>acrifices, and that I <U+017F>hould come to con<U+017F>ult with this Oracle, whether I intend to

future evill may make us turn to him, and that with <U+017F>acrifices, <U+017F>upplications, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we do appea<U+017F>e his anger, and divert the puni<U+017F>hments from us. And therefore, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
the<U+017F>e adverti<U+017F>ements are not to be de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed; for if they <U+017F>hould, it would make his
hand more havy upon us, for having <U+017F>o little care of his advice: Let <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and you,
lay the<U+017F>e things to your hearts, <U+017F>ince it is to be believed they are not without great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on.
Examine well all your actions, and if upon a <U+017F>trict <U+017F>urvey you finde any that is
not good, reprove them your <U+017F>elves, and not tarry till <hi>Tautates</hi> make you more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
of them: Afterwards make a <U+017F>trict inqui<U+017F>ition what is done in your hou<U+017F>e, and if you
find any offences in it, reform them <U+017F>o as they may be no more committed: Then let
your eye be over all the Country, and diligently inform your <U+017F>elves what abu<U+017F>es are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
and u<U+017F>ed there; cha<U+017F>tife tho<U+017F>e that are the Authors of them; for that <U+017F>tate
where vice goes unpuni<U+017F>hed, and vertue unrewarded, is very near de<U+017F>olation. Know Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that the Prince and the State are but one body, whereof the Prince is the head
And as all the paine which the body re<U+017F>ents does come from the head, <U+017F>o all the paine
which the head endures, does proceed from the body: My meaning is, that as <hi>Tautates</hi>

                        <hi>Galathea</hi> thanked the <U+017F>age <hi>Cleontine</hi> for her prudent and religious admonitions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ing
her, not onely to ob<U+017F>erve them her <U+017F>elfe, but to acquaint <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> with them, that
<U+017F>he al<U+017F>o might follow them: Afterwards, <U+017F>he related unto her the accident which had
hapned, and how much it troubled her; for be<U+017F>ides the death of <hi>Argenteus,</hi> the in<U+017F>olen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Polemas</hi> in her pre<U+017F>ence was very di<U+017F>ta<U+017F>teful to her, <U+017F>o as it wounded her to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<U+017F>oul. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cleontine,</hi> <U+017F>uddain pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions are often to be excu<U+017F>ed, becau<U+017F>e they

for <hi>Polemas</hi> to doe thus unto a <U+017F>tranger, one that had right on his <U+017F>ight, and in

does think he may do <U+017F>omething which is wor<U+017F>e. Indeed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> when a <U+017F>ubject
does faile in that re<U+017F>pect which he owes unto his <U+017F>overaigne, he does it either out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in his judgement, or el<U+017F>e becau<U+017F>e he thinkes him<U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o powerfull, that he feares not
not any di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, and therefore it concerns him to take good heed.</p>
                     <p>With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, they came to the hou<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>age <hi>Cleontine,</hi> into which

all the Nymphs could not do too much honour, nor <U+017F>hew too much demon<U+017F>tration of

before <hi>Arganteus</hi> tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F><U+017F>ed the limits of his di<U+017F>cretion; but <U+017F>ince his love was
turned into di<U+017F>daine, <U+017F>he fell into <U+017F>o great a hatred of him, as <U+017F>he had courage to look on
him when he was dead, without be<U+017F>towing upon him one <U+017F>ingle tear; <U+017F>o much did the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent

                     <p>The Cavalier was pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>armed, and <U+017F>earched by the Chyrurgions, who found
onely one wound in his <U+017F>houlder, which was <U+017F>o <U+017F>light that they made no matter of it,
onely advl<U+017F>ed him to keep his bed that day, by rea<U+017F>on of the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of blood. <hi>Galathea</hi>
de<U+017F>iring to offer the <U+017F>acrifice which <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved upon before <U+017F>he went from the place, <U+017F>he
<U+017F>ent to provide bulls and other things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary again<U+017F>t the next morning: Al<U+017F>o <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved

with the Oracle al<U+017F>o, and joyn their <U+017F>acrifices together: She was plea<U+017F>ed to gratifie him
<U+017F>o far, as to permit him, although it was not altogether the cu<U+017F>tome: In the mean time,
they <U+017F>ent out every way to enquire of their Coaches, and the <U+017F>ervant of the unknowne
Cavalier.</p>
                     <p>After they had dined, and every one expected to heare <U+017F>ome newes of tho<U+017F>e that were

you undertook again<U+017F>t the in<U+017F>olent <hi>Arganteus,</hi> yet you are in one thing obliged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us; for when we entreated you to pull up your Helmet, and tell us your Name, and
what fortune brought you into this Country; you were plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>atisfie us in letting
us <U+017F>ee your face, but the coming of the <U+017F>age <hi>Cleontine</hi> hindred you from an<U+017F>wering the
other part of our de<U+017F>ires; but <U+017F>ince we have <U+017F>een your face, it does the more inflame our
de<U+017F>ires of knowing unto whom we are <U+017F>o much obliged; and what was the cau<U+017F>e of your
coming hither: And all this, that we may the better <U+017F>erve you in any way we are able.
Now is the time convenient; there is no feare of any prejudice to your wound, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we hope that you will <U+017F>atisfie our de<U+017F>ires. Madam, an<U+017F>wered the Cavalier and <U+017F>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
Does the demanding of a thing make it a debt? Sir, replyed the Nymph, It is the
peculiar priviledge of Ladies in this Country; and you know that every one is obliged
to the ob<U+017F>ervation of the Lawes belonging unto that Country wherein he is. 'Tis true,
Madam, <U+017F>aid he, but my greate<U+017F>t difficulty is, not without rea<U+017F>on; That I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

to him, <U+017F>ince in acquainting us with your misfortunes, we are de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>erve you,
and may help you. Madam, <U+017F>aid he, If my misfortunes be contageous, we had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

burthen, and I am <U+017F>ure there is none in all the company but thinkes their own the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t:
open therefore your wound unto us, <U+017F>ometimes one may meet with another, who
is able to give unexpected remedy. It is not the hopes of any Remedy, replyed he, which
will move me to <U+017F>hew mine, for I know there is none but death: But it is onely, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,

                     <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed to know then, Madam, that my Country is <hi>Aquitane;</hi> I was educated by
King <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond,</hi> one of the greate<U+017F>t Princes that ever reigned over the Vi<U+017F>igots: A Prince
<U+017F>o good and ju<U+017F>t, that he got the peoples love as much as if they were Vi<U+017F>igots. This
King rai<U+017F>ed his Court unto a higher pitch of glory than any other neighbouring Kings,
both by his arms, and the civility of tho<U+017F>e that were about his Per<U+017F>on: We were a jolly
company of young boyes brought up under him with as much care and indulgency, as if
we had beene his owne: Of this Volley was <hi>Alcidon, Cleomer, Cel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who all became very brave and gallant Cavaliers; it was my fate to be brought up
among<U+017F>t them, and I may <U+017F>ay, that this education was the onely peece of good fortune
that ever I had. My Father, who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Beliantes,</hi> and who by his vertue was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
unto great Authority about <hi>Thierry,</hi> he left me an Orphan in my cradle, there begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fortune which ever <U+017F>ince hath pur<U+017F>ued me: For, not being willing I <U+017F>hould ever
arrive unto that credit which my Father had gotten, <U+017F>he deprived me of it when I was
<U+017F>ucking my Mothers bre<U+017F>t, and pre<U+017F>ently after tooke away my mother al<U+017F>o, and made
me mourn in my cradle.</p>
                     <p>At my coming out of my infancy, I ca<U+017F>t my eyes upon a faire Lady, who<U+017F>e name I
de<U+017F>ire to conceale, as well as my owne, becau<U+017F>e I would not di<U+017F>cover all my mi<U+017F>ery. Nay,
nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> we mu<U+017F>t needs know both her name, and yours al<U+017F>o; for there is
nothing you can tell us which we more de<U+017F>ire. Then, <U+017F>aid he my name is <hi>Damon,</hi> and
hers <hi>Madonthe.</hi> How, replyed the Nymph pre<U+017F>ently; <hi>Damon</hi> who <U+017F>erved <hi>Madonthe,</hi>
Daughter unto the great Captaine of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> who<U+017F>e name was <hi>Amorant,</hi> and killed
in the Battle of <hi>Attila</hi> upon the body of the valiant King <hi>Thyerry,</hi> and whom <hi>Leontidas</hi>
would have married to his Nephew? Are you that <hi>Damon,</hi> who out of jealou<U+017F>ie fought
with <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> a little before the death of <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond?</hi> I am the very <U+017F>ame <hi>Damon</hi> of
whom you <U+017F>peake, replyed he, that is the mo<U+017F>t unfortunate Cavalier that lives, or ever
did live: You doe infinitely a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h me, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, for every one beleeves you to be long
<U+017F>ince dead, and that you <U+017F>ent your <U+017F>ervant with a Hankercher full of your blood, unto
your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, or rather unto the wicked <hi>Leriana,</hi> as a te<U+017F>timony of your death. Tis
true, replyed the Cavalier with a deep <U+017F>igh, but fortune intending to per<U+017F>ecute me more
yet, would not let me go <U+017F>o good a way: Truly, <U+017F>aid the Nymph, many are deceived;
for the opinion of your death is <U+017F>pread all the Country over, and nothing is thought more
certaine.</p>
                     <p>I do remember, that when the newes of your death came hither, and relation was made
of your Love, of your Jealou<U+017F>ie, and of your death, many did pitty you, not only becau<U+017F>e
you were dead by <U+017F>o ill a way, but becau<U+017F>e you did not live to <U+017F>ee the revenge which
was upon the wicked <hi>Leriana,</hi> every one thinking that your fidelity and your affection
did merit <U+017F>o much <U+017F>atisfaction before you dyed, as to know the innocency of the poore
<hi>Madonthe.</hi> But how was it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>aved from that mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perate danger?
Madam, an<U+017F>wered the Cavalier, <U+017F>ince I perceive you are informed of all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages as well
as my <U+017F>elfe, I will only relate unto you what hath chanced unto me <U+017F>ince my combate with
<hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and <U+017F>o abridge a great part of my dy<U+017F>a<U+017F>trous life.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, I received in the combate which I had with <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> very many
wounds, and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t two very great ones, which put me into good hopes of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53527:59"/>
dying, having no de<U+017F>ire to live, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he for who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ake onely my life was deer unto me
had <U+017F>o cruelly betrayed me. In that de<U+017F>igne, I took the blinde<U+017F>t way I could chu<U+017F>e, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that when my blood failed me, I <U+017F>hould end this mi<U+017F>erable life; and in this re<U+017F>olution,
when I found my <U+017F>elfe begin to faint, I commanded <hi>Hall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>dine</hi> my <U+017F>ervant to carry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Madonthe</hi> the Ring which I tooke from <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and unto <hi>Leriana</hi> my Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
full of my blood: The one, to <U+017F>hew unto her whom I loved, that <U+017F>he was to blame
in preferring one before me, who did le<U+017F><U+017F>e de<U+017F>erve it, and the other to glut the cruelty
of <hi>Leriana.</hi> I perceived by the an<U+017F>wer which <hi>Halladine</hi> gave me, that if I had followed
his directions he would have gotten me unto <U+017F>ome place where whole<U+017F>ome remedies might
have hindred me from what I de<U+017F>ired, my death.</p>
                     <p>This conceit, and finding my <U+017F>elfe faint, did make me <U+017F>trive to get unto the River of
<hi>Garrone,</hi> and by chance I came unto a place where the bank was very <U+017F>teep, and under it
<U+017F>o full of points of little Rocks, that I thought when I fell I <U+017F>hould certainly be da<U+017F>hed in
pieces before I came to the water; but my faithfull Servant who<U+017F>e eye was never off me,
perceived my de<U+017F>igne, as I thinke by my eyes which perhaps were <U+017F>tartled at the horrour
of death, and to prevent it, <U+017F>tepped neerer, and catched hold of me. But <U+017F>ee Madam, what
a man will doe that is re<U+017F>olved to dye: I forced my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly and vigorou<U+017F>ly from
him, as I fell, and never touched any of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>harp Rocks, becau<U+017F>e I over leaped them:
Thus Fortune was plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ave me again<U+017F>t my will, and my extreame de<U+017F>ire of dying
may be <U+017F>aid to be the cau<U+017F>e of my not dying. My Servant cryed, and ran pre<U+017F>ently about
to looke for me at the bottome, and finding me neere the <U+017F>ide, he took hold of me; but
the <U+017F>tream was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong as it pulled him into the water after me, and it was a very mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that he e<U+017F>caped drowning, for the place was <U+017F>o full of weeds as his feet were intangled
in them; but it is to <U+017F>hew others that the Gods never for<U+017F>ake tho<U+017F>e as are faithfull to their
Ma<U+017F>ters; he was <U+017F>o intangled that he lo<U+017F>t me, and knew not what was become of me, for
I being further in the water than he, the <U+017F>tream was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong and impetuous, as it carried
me away, <U+017F>ometimes under, and <U+017F>ometimes above the water, neer halfe a mile from the
place; and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e I had beene carryed into the Sea, had I not been <U+017F>topped by <U+017F>ome
Fi<U+017F>hermen, who by fortune were upon the River in their little boats: They <U+017F>pyed me
afar off, and not knowing at the fir<U+017F>t what it was; a de<U+017F>ire of gain moved them to <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<U+017F>ome one way, and others another, to be <U+017F>ure of catching me; but when I was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
neerer them, they plainly <U+017F>aw that I was a man; and then, be<U+017F>ides a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of booty,
a charitable di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition moved them unto their be<U+017F>t endeavours, and with a long hooke
catched hold of my clothes, and then pulling me into one of their little boats, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me on <U+017F>hore, where laying me along upon the <U+017F>and, and <U+017F>tripping me, they perceived
that I had <U+017F>everall wounds, and that they were fre<U+017F>h; at this they were much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed,
and much more when rifling my pockets, they found a good quantity of money, and on
my fingers three or four Rings of good value: Upon which, one of them <U+017F>aid, that this
day was either their enriching for ever, or el<U+017F>e their utter undoing: For, <U+017F>aid he, here
is riches enough to <U+017F>erve us all as long as we live: But if ever this come to the eares of
ju<U+017F>tice, it will be <U+017F>aid that we killed him, and condemne us for not revealing it; <U+017F>o as if
we conceale it we are made for ever, and if revealed we are all undone, all of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the <U+017F>ame, and knew not what cour<U+017F>e to re<U+017F>olve upon; at la<U+017F>t, one of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a little more re<U+017F>olution than the re<U+017F>t: Brothers, <U+017F>aid he, let us bury him, let us <U+017F>hare
and keep the riches which <hi>Tautates</hi> hath <U+017F>ent us, &amp; not reveal it unto <U+017F>uch as who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e
will take them from us; we know that we are not guilty of this mi<U+017F>hap, and <U+017F>ince
we are not, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that God will protect the innocent, and therefore let us divide
what we have found, and live happily all our dayes after it.</p>
                     <p>As <U+017F>oone as this motion was made, it was con<U+017F>ented unto by the re<U+017F>t, and pre<U+017F>ently
they fell to divide, but in the fir<U+017F>t place they made a grave, in which they would inter
me, and till then would not divide, to the end every one <U+017F>hould worke at it with the
better will.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t they were thus bu<U+017F>ied, there was an old Druid, who <U+017F>eeing the<U+017F>e Fi<U+017F>hermen
afar off, he had an opinion that they were dividing their Fi<U+017F>h; this Druid was a holy man,
lived a very godly and exemplary life, and fa<U+017F>ted almo<U+017F>t every day and therefore he was lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
honoured and reverenced by every one. This grave old Druide, had in his younger
dayes followed the gli<U+017F>tering follies of the world, as others did; but having found them
all to be but empty plea<U+017F>ures, he retired him<U+017F>elfe from the frequent <U+017F>ociety of men, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53527:60"/>
lived in a little Cabin upon the top of a Rocke clo<U+017F>e be<U+017F>ides this River, and that he
might the more freely be devoted unto his contemplation, he deve<U+017F>ted him<U+017F>elfe from a good
e<U+017F>tate which was de<U+017F>cended unto him from his Ance<U+017F>tors an action which brought him
<U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teem in all the Country, as he was reputed, loved and feared as a <U+017F>acred Servant,
and reall friend unto <hi>Tautates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Druid then, <U+017F>pying the<U+017F>e fi<U+017F>hermen digging in the ground, he came unto them, and
they were <U+017F>o bu<U+017F>ie at work, as he was very near them before they <U+017F>aw him, and <U+017F>o near,
as he could <U+017F>ee a naked body, riffled from its clothes; I know not which were mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F>toni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed,
they in <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o near as they could not hide my body, or he in <U+017F>eeing as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
<U+017F>o many murderers. For he verily believed that they had killed me; and the
rather, becau<U+017F>e coming nearer, he <U+017F>aw the blood fre<U+017F>h; for blood ran <U+017F>till out of my
wounds, as fre<U+017F>h as if the wounds were newly given. When he was come up unto them,
and <U+017F>aw the<U+017F>e wounds thus fre<U+017F>h, and them bloody, he began to reprehend them very <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,
and menace them with the puni<U+017F>hments of God and men. Doe you think, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wretches as you are, <U+017F>aid he unto them, that though you <U+017F>hould hide this body in the
very center of the earth, <hi>Tautates</hi> would not di<U+017F>cover it to the <U+017F>ight of all? Can you
think this blood does not cry to heaven for vengeance? and that you can fly into any
any part of the earth where ju<U+017F>tice will not find you? How dur<U+017F>t you for a little mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erable
gaine which will deceive you, commit <U+017F>uch an execrable wickedne<U+017F><U+017F>e? The<U+017F>e
Fi<U+017F>hermen, who were not of any wicked temper, as afterwards they <U+017F>hewed, did bear a very
great re<U+017F>pect unto this Druid; fell down upon their knees before him, prote<U+017F>ted them<U+017F>elves
innocent of the blood, told him how they drew the body out of the water, what their
de<U+017F>ign was, that they had no arms to make the<U+017F>e wounds, and that if they had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they could ea<U+017F>ily have fled when they <U+017F>aw him coming, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>ide of the River, but they <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>till, and would <U+017F>tand upon their ju<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                     <p>The Good man con<U+017F>idering all the<U+017F>e circum<U+017F>tances, he began to think they <U+017F>poke truth;
but the better to know it, he came unto my Corps, and <U+017F>eeing the wounds <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h; Doe
you tell me, <U+017F>aid he, that you are innocent of his death? We do <U+017F>weare it, <U+017F>aid they, by
the <U+017F>acred Mis<U+017F>leto: Then, <U+017F>aid the Druid, you may doe well to looke out for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
for doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he cannot be far from hence; and beleeve it, if you do not find him
out, you your <U+017F>elves will be accu<U+017F>ed for it: And becau<U+017F>e I would not have the innocent
puni<U+017F>hed, and the guilty go free, where are his clothes which he had when you fir<U+017F>t found
him? The Fi<U+017F>hermen, as if they had been already in the hand of the Judge, and never
thinking upon their re<U+017F>olution, they did not onely produce what the Druid demanded of
them, but al<U+017F>o the money and Rings, and all that they found. Then the good Druid,
<U+017F>aid unto them; Now friends, I doe thinke, you really innocent, <U+017F>ince you doe <U+017F>o freely
produce the<U+017F>e pretious things; be certain that God will a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t you both in this occa<U+017F>ion
and all others. Then pre<U+017F>ently falling downe upon his knees, and making a <U+017F>igne unto
them to doe the like.</p>
                     <p>Oh great Tautates, <hi>cryed he out, and lifting up his hands and eyes to Heaven;</hi> Thou
who ha<U+017F>t a particular care of men, we be<U+017F>eech thee to turne thy vengeance from us for
the death of this Man, and let thy infinite goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e forgive and amend them that did
commit this <U+017F>inne.</p>
                     <p>And becau<U+017F>e my wounds <U+017F>till bled, he commanded them to wa<U+017F>h me, and then do that
charitable office which they had begun in burying me: According to his command, they
did wa<U+017F>h me, then he asked of them a peece of money, which he intended according to
the Cu<U+017F>tome when any was buryed, to put into my mouth: The poore Fi<U+017F>hermen did all
as he commanded them; and the good old Druid, weak though he was, did take me in
his arms, and thought that he found <U+017F>ome heat in me, which made him lay his hand
pre<U+017F>ently upon my heart, which he perceived to move and tremble. Courage, my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<U+017F>aid he, I hope this man has life enough to cleere you from the Calumny which
may be laid upon you, and to lay the fault where it rightly de<U+017F>erves, for he is yet warm,
and I perceive his heart to beat: Then letting my head hang a little downe, the water
came out in great abundance, and the good Druid bound up my wounds with Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
as well as he could; then he commanded them to make a devi<U+017F>e with their Oares,
whereon they might carry me with more ea<U+017F>e; and whil<U+017F>t they were working about it,
the good Druid went to <U+017F>eeke out <U+017F>ome hearbs by the bank <U+017F>ides, which he knew were
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53527:60"/>
good to be applyed unto my wounds, and which would a little fre<U+017F>hen and invigorate
my <U+017F>pirits; he was not long about them, but brui<U+017F>ing tho<U+017F>e Simples betwixt two <U+017F>tones,
he put <U+017F>ome of them into my wounds, and applyed <U+017F>ome to my heart, and pre<U+017F>ently the
blood <U+017F>tayed: Pre<U+017F>ently after, I began to breathe, and my pul<U+017F>e came unto me, whereof
they were all <U+017F>o glad, that after thanks unto the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> they carried me upon
their Oars into the Cell of this good Druid, and laid me upon a good bed, where one
of his Nephews u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ometimes to lye, when he came to vi<U+017F>it him; for as for him<U+017F>elfe,
his bed was onely a few dry leaves without any order or delicacy.</p>
                     <p>I was all the re<U+017F>t of the day and never opened an eye, or gave any <U+017F>igne of life, but
onely my breath and my pul<U+017F>e: The next morning about breake of day my eyes ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and I was never in my life more a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, than to <U+017F>ee my <U+017F>elfe in that place; for I
remembred the Combate which I had, and my re<U+017F>olution of throwing my <U+017F>elfe into the
River; but I could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly imagine how I <U+017F>hould come there. I continued long in
this thought; at la<U+017F>t, the room growing lighter, and the little loophole which was in
lieu of a Window being towards the <U+017F>un ri<U+017F>ing, I looked about, and the <U+017F>ight made me
wonder more, for my Chamber was onely a Cave, the roof Rock, and Ivie my hangings:
Seeing all the<U+017F>e things as I lay on my bed, I endeavoured to rai<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf a little, the
better to con<U+017F>ider them; but I was not able, both in re<U+017F>pect of my weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and al<U+017F>o
by rea<U+017F>on of my wounds. Bening then forced to lie <U+017F>till as I was, and as they had laid me,
I began to put my hand to the places where I found my paine, and finding the Napkins
and <U+017F>uch other things as they had applyed unto me, I was <U+017F>till more amazed. Then, not
being able to imagine how all the<U+017F>e things <U+017F>hould come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, I began to think upon
<U+017F>uch <U+017F>tories as I had heard of concerning Water-Nymphs, and Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es, who dwelt in
Rivers, almo<U+017F>t condemning my <U+017F>elfe of incredulity that I had not believed them, and
now thought that this place could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be any other, then one of their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
But as a wandring mind does u<U+017F>ually rove immediately from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I pre<U+017F>ently began to think upon the injuries and ingratitude of <hi>Madonthe.</hi> The
memory of which went <U+017F>o near my heart, as it forced from me <U+017F>o deep a <U+017F>igh, as the
good man of God heard me; for he was <U+017F>et at the door, attending till it was time to
come and <U+017F>ee me. As <U+017F>oon as ever he heard me, he came into the Chamber, and without
<U+017F>aying any thing, after he had a little looked upon me, he went and opened the window
wider, that he might the better <U+017F>ee in what condition I was: Afterwards coming to
me, feeling my pul<U+017F>e and my heart, and finding me much amended, did <U+017F>eem to be
very glad of it: Then <U+017F>itting down in a Chaire which <U+017F>tood by my beds <U+017F>ide, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a while upon me, he began thus to <U+017F>peak. My Son, <U+017F>ince the great God hath made
his love unto you evidently appeare by <U+017F>ending you <U+017F>uch unexpected A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, you are
the more obliged unto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nkes for <U+017F>o great a mercy and favour, and to be obedient unto
what<U+017F>oever he command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>: For as the acknowledgement of favours received from him,
does invite his hand unto more liberality, <U+017F>o ingratitude provokes him to <U+017F>lack his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and in lieu thereof, to cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e. Take good heed of this my Son, and let us <U+017F>ee how
you will expre<U+017F><U+017F>e your thankes by your words, and with what demon<U+017F>trations you
will acknowledge the particular Cure which hath been over you: upon this he was <U+017F>ilent
to <U+017F>ee what I would an<U+017F>wer. This good old man, had a very venerable and grave a<U+017F>pect,
a plea<U+017F>ing look, a <U+017F>weet Phy<U+017F>iognomy, and <U+017F>o mild a voyce, as it <U+017F>eemed as if <U+017F>ome God
had <U+017F>poken by his mouth: But yet my amazement was <U+017F>o great, as it was long before I
returned him an an<U+017F>wer; He fearing that it was my weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e, or the pain of my wounds,
which hindred me. Son, <U+017F>aid he, if your paine and weakne<U+017F><U+017F>e will not permit you to
an<U+017F>wer; yet make a <U+017F>ign in te<U+017F>timony of your de<U+017F>ire, and God will <U+017F>o well accept it, as he
will give you further <U+017F>trength. Then recollecting my <U+017F>pirits, I forced my <U+017F>elfe to an<U+017F>wer
him with a feeble voyce, in the<U+017F>e words: Father, it is not the wounds of my body hath
brought me into this condition wherein you <U+017F>ee me; but it is the wounds of my <U+017F>oul,
which expecting no other cure or remedies, but <U+017F>uch as death u<U+017F>eth to give unto tho<U+017F>e
that are mi<U+017F>erable, made me look for an end of my life from a River, which it <U+017F>eems is
<U+017F>o pittile<U+017F><U+017F>e, as <U+017F>he will not not afford me that help which <U+017F>he never denyes unto others.
The<U+017F>e things are <U+017F>till in my memory, but I cannot tell how I came out of that River
wherein I threw my <U+017F>elfe; nor how I came into this place, and in your pre<U+017F>ence.</p>
                     <p>Son, replyed the Druid, I perceive your crime, and the favour of <hi>Tautates</hi> are greater
then I did imagine them: For I had an opinion, that <U+017F>ome of your enemies had thus u<U+017F>ed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53527:61"/>
you, and that the great God had <U+017F>aved and delivered you out of their hands but for ought
I <U+017F>ee you would have procured your own death, a <U+017F>in <U+017F>o great &amp; execrable both unto God

brought with them a man tyed with cords, <U+017F>o as at the fir<U+017F>t I did not know him, as well
becau<U+017F>e my mind was di<U+017F>tracted another way as becau<U+017F>e he looked with a <U+017F>trange affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Ma<U+017F>ter, my Ma<U+017F>ter, I knew him to be <hi>Halladine</hi> my Servant: You may imagine Madam
whether I was amazed to <U+017F>ee him in that condition; for I could remember how I pulled
him into the water, and thought he had been drowned but I was much more amazed when
I heard one of the Fi<U+017F>hermen addre<U+017F><U+017F>e unto the Druid, &amp; a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him, that this was the man
who had brought me into the condition I was, and that he was not content with what
he had done, but he was looking about for the corps that he might hide it and his wicked
act together. The good old man would have <U+017F>poke, when I interrupted and told him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
No, no, my friends, you are mi<U+017F>taken, he is innocent, he is my Servant, and the mo<U+017F>t faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Servant I ever had, <U+017F>et him at liberty I intreat you, and let me imbrace him once more.
The poore men wondered to <U+017F>ee me hug him <U+017F>o affectionately, and he falling downe upon
his knees at my bed <U+017F>ide, with eyes <U+017F>howring tears, he was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with joy, that
he could not <U+017F>peake: But when he was unbound, I embraced him as tenderly as if he
had been my borther.</p>
                     <p>I was extreamly de<U+017F>irous to know whether he had delivered my me<U+017F><U+017F>age as I comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, and how he came to be brought thus unto me, but I dur<U+017F>t not aske him,
lea<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover what I de<U+017F>ired to keepe <U+017F>ecret. The Druid who was di<U+017F>creet and
wi<U+017F>e did perceive as much; For pre<U+017F>ently upon it, <U+017F>eeming as if he would go and enquire
the manner of their meeting with this Servant, he went out of the Cell, and carryed with
him all but us two. My curio<U+017F>ity would not <U+017F>uffer me to be any longer without asking

my commands, and failed in nothing, that all tho<U+017F>e who heard of my death, did
extreamly lament me, that had he thought to have found me alive, he would have brought
me an an<U+017F>wer unto my letter; but being de<U+017F>irous to doe me the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervice he could; he
came to looke for my corps along the River <U+017F>ide, that he might give it buriall, intending
afterwards to retire him<U+017F>elfe from that Country and all habitable places: And this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

he <U+017F>ought: And they, after they had looked upon him, and whi<U+017F>pered a while together,
they fell upon him and bound him, as I <U+017F>aw he was<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> thinking it was he who had treated
me in that manner; that doe all they could; he would not tell my name, nor give them
any light by which they might know whom I was<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> But Sir, <U+017F>aid he, I be<U+017F>eech you by
what good fortune came you hither, and what good God was it that re<U+017F>tored you unto
life againe? Then joyning his hands together, and lifted up his teare <U+017F>welled eyes to
Heaven; for ever happy may he be, <U+017F>aid he, that did this good worke. <hi>Halladine,</hi> my
Friend, <U+017F>aid I unto him, I thanke thee heartily for thy good will, and I am very glad
thou ha<U+017F>t not revealed my name, for I would not have any know me to be alive: And
as to thy que<U+017F>tion, how I came hither, you mu<U+017F>t enquire of <U+017F>ome body el<U+017F>e than me, for
I am as ignorant as thou art. And yet let me tell thee, that though Heaven has pre<U+017F>erved
my life again<U+017F>t my will, I cannot chu<U+017F>e but thank it, <U+017F>ince I can by thee heare of <hi>Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,
Madonthe</hi> whom I be<U+017F>eech the Heavens to pre<U+017F>erve, and unto whom I wi<U+017F>h all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F><U+017F>e
and contentment. Oh Heavens (<U+017F>aid <hi>Halladine</hi>) is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould continue
<U+017F>till in this errour? you have little rea<U+017F>on to make that prayer for her, or ever to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
her, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e to dete<U+017F>t her and to be revenged both of her, <hi>Leriana,</hi> and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander:</hi>
And were I as you, I would doe it, and be as eager to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her as you have been to do
her <U+017F>ervice. Were't thou, as I, replyed I thou would<U+017F>t not give harbour unto any thought
<U+017F>o ill; and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that were I not confident thy language proceeds from thy love unto
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53527:61"/>
me, I would never looke upon thee againe with a good eye, <U+017F>o extreamely contrary are
thy thoughts unto mine; and therefore if thou wilt continue, with me unto the end of
my dayes (which will beere long: if it be as I de<U+017F>ire) never offer any <U+017F>uch language unto
me againe, nor again<U+017F>t a per<U+017F>on whom I love, as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erves above all the world.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, I was <U+017F>o weake that I could <U+017F>ay no more; for whether it was my <U+017F>udden
<U+017F>urprize of joy to <U+017F>ee <hi>Halladine,</hi> or my anger to hear him utter <U+017F>uch language, I cannot
tell, but my wounds began to bleed <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h, as I grew cold and pale, and almo<U+017F>t with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pul<U+017F>e. I perceived it, at the beginning of my talke, but becau<U+017F>e I did not much de<U+017F>ire
to live, I would not <U+017F>peake of it, and but for <hi>Halladine</hi> who tooke notice of my chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
colour, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e I had then put an end unto all my mi<U+017F>eries; but that faithfull
Servant ran pre<U+017F>ently to the Druid, and told him: He who during all the time of our
talke, was preparing what he thought be<U+017F>t for the dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing of my wounds, and <U+017F>tayed
but for the terme of fifteene houres, before he would apply the fir<U+017F>t plai<U+017F>ter, he came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
into the Chamber, and finding me all in blood, did conceive that <U+017F>ome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
emotion was the cau<U+017F>e of it; yet not <U+017F>eeming to take any notice of it then, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had carefully dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed me, and made me take <U+017F>ome broth, he <U+017F>hut the window, and
bad me re<U+017F>t a little; for this <U+017F>econd lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of blood had brought me <U+017F>o low, as I was not
able to lift up my hand.</p>
                     <p>In the meane while he took <hi>Halladine</hi> a<U+017F>ide, did put into his hands all that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Fi<U+017F>hermen, and enquired very particularly who I was, and by what acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
I came to be in that condition, and thereupon related unto him all circum<U+017F>tances,
how I was <U+017F>aved. My Servant gave him very many thanks for the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance he had <U+017F>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto me, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, that he would not be <U+017F>orry for the paines he had taken; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
him by the great <hi>Tautates</hi> to continue it, and that both God and men would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him for <U+017F>o good a worke; as for the other que<U+017F>tion which he asked him, they were
things he dur<U+017F>t not an<U+017F>wer without my permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, becau<U+017F>e I had expre<U+017F>ly forbidden him;
but he might a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him<U+017F>elfe, I was <U+017F>uch a one, as when he knew me, he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of his paine and time imployed in my <U+017F>ervice; all he could <U+017F>ay, was, that I was one
of the principall men in all <hi>Aquitane<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                        </hi> Is he then a <hi>Gaul,</hi> replyed the Druid, and not a
Vi<U+017F>igot? Mo<U+017F>t true, replyed <hi>Halladine,</hi> but he was brought up by the King of the Vi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
in his hou<U+017F>e: It is enough, <U+017F>aid the good Druid, all I de<U+017F>ire to know more, is onely
what beliefe he has in the great Gods, for I tooke notice that he is extreamly troubled in
his mind, and mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly, the mind mu<U+017F>t then be cured before the body can. Indeed,
Father, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Halladine,</hi> you have rightly ob<U+017F>erved his di<U+017F>temper, for never was mind
more po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with a deepe melancholy, than the mind of this Cavalier: And for my
part I beleeve there are onely two remedies to cure him. What doe you thinke them to
be, asked the Druid? The one, <U+017F>aid <hi>Halladine,</hi> is God who is able to doe any thing:
Then replyed the good old man, we mu<U+017F>t have recour<U+017F>e unto God, and pray unto him
to direct us in his cure; but what is the other? Death, <U+017F>aid <hi>Halladine:</hi> Still I <U+017F>ee no
way, <U+017F>aid the holy man, but to have recour<U+017F>e unto God. And <U+017F>ince this time, he had <U+017F>o
great a care of me, as he would never be from me, at lea<U+017F>t as little as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could:
And one day when he perceived me to be a little better, he u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o many arguments unto
me, and alledged <U+017F>o many rea<U+017F>ons as in conclu<U+017F>ion I did acknowledge that nothing did
come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e but by the appointment of God, who loving us better than we can do our
<U+017F>elves, it is to be in common rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, that what<U+017F>oever he does is to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
though the Phy<U+017F>icke he gives us be <U+017F>ometimes bitter, and hard to be <U+017F>wallowed.
As <U+017F>oon as I was grounded in this knowledge, I pre<U+017F>ently rejected my barbarous re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of dying, and re<U+017F>igned my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o into the hands of great <hi>Tautates,</hi> as I began to
think all things <U+017F>weet <U+017F>ince they came unto me from the Soveraign goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e. This re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did operate <U+017F>o well, that in a little time, I was pa<U+017F>t danger, and within a few dayes
after that, <U+017F>o recovered, as I wanted only a little more <U+017F>trength; which indeed by rea<U+017F>on
of my lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <U+017F>o much blood, was <U+017F>o great a want, as I mu<U+017F>t refer it unto time for my
recovery.</p>
                     <p>During which time, having nothing to bu<U+017F>ie my <U+017F>elfe in, but my owne thoughts, I
was mo<U+017F>t commonly out of the little Cell, under the excu<U+017F>e of taking the fre<U+017F>h Air, though
it was only becau<U+017F>e none <U+017F>hould interrupt me. The good old man <U+017F>pent mo<U+017F>t of his time
in prayers and contemplation; and <hi>Halladine</hi> went out unto the neighbouring Townes
and Villages to provide Victuals, and other nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries, whil<U+017F>t I in the meane time, was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53527:62"/>
upon the top of the Rock, looking alwaies towards the place where I left <hi>Madonthe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as it was day, I was alwayes wont to leave my little Cell, and crawl a weak
march to the top of this Rock; where <U+017F>itting upon a mo<U+017F><U+017F>y Cu<U+017F>hion, I <U+017F>ummoned into
my memory all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages unto that very time, not forgetting neither my good fortune, nor
my bad, which went deep to my heart; for the mi<U+017F>ery pa<U+017F>t did wound me, as much as
the mi<U+017F>ery pre<U+017F>ent; and I re<U+017F>ented the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which once I had, and then had not, as
a lo<U+017F><U+017F>e which was pre<U+017F>ently ravi<U+017F>hed mo<U+017F>t injuriou<U+017F>ly from me</p>
                     <p>After dinner, retiring my <U+017F>elfe under <U+017F>ome Trees which made a plea<U+017F>ant <U+017F>hade not far
from the Cell; there I contemplated the mi<U+017F>erable condition unto which fortune had
reduced me: my own mi<U+017F>eries, and the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e of another did equally offend me: the
one, by my own re<U+017F>entment; the other, by envy and jealou<U+017F>ie of that contentment which
was ravi<U+017F>hed from me. But after Supper, walking along the River <U+017F>ide, my contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was bu<U+017F>ied in con<U+017F>ideration of tho<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>eries which might fall upon me for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and what little hopes there was of preventing them, <U+017F>o as all my dayes journey
was divided into three kind of con<U+017F>iderations; the morning, in things pa<U+017F>t; the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
in things pre<U+017F>ent; and the evening in things future: and the la<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e would la<U+017F>t
<U+017F>o long, as they would take mo<U+017F>t of the night; being invited thereunto by the <U+017F>oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the place, or by the <U+017F>ilence of the night, or by the plea<U+017F>ure I took in thinking
upon my di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures. For, Madam, life was a thing of <U+017F>o little value to me at that
time, as there was nothing I de<U+017F>ired more then to <U+017F>ee the end of it: And being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to u<U+017F>e no violence again<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elfe, I wi<U+017F>hed that <U+017F>ome accident or other would be
<U+017F>o friendly to me, as to doe that good office for me, without my contributing unto the
homicide of my <U+017F>elfe: And I had an opinion, that if <U+017F>orrow increa<U+017F>ed on, as it had done
of late, it would doe the worke for me; <U+017F>o as I <U+017F>uffered this opinion to <U+017F>way <U+017F>o much in
my mind, as I could <U+017F>eldome begotten unto my lodging, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e the good old man or my
<U+017F>ervant, came to fetch me.</p>
                     <p>This kind of life, was <U+017F>o agreeable to my humour, as I was oft in a mind to quit both
Arms and Fortune, and <U+017F>tay here all the re<U+017F>t of my dayes. And in order to this de<U+017F>igne,
I acquainted my <U+017F>ervant, advi<U+017F>ing him to retire him<U+017F>elfe with tho<U+017F>e goods which fortune
had given me, which I would freely be<U+017F>tow upon him, if he would leave me in this place
where I would de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e fortune, and bid her defiance. But <hi>Halladine</hi> in a flood of teares,
could <U+017F>ay nothing el<U+017F>e, but that nothing under heaven <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eparate him from me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e
onely death; and that he wi<U+017F>hed for no greater wealth then to <U+017F>erve me. Then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
after he had gotten me to bed, and hearing me <U+017F>igh he came unto me; and <U+017F>ince he
perceived I could not <U+017F>leep, he <U+017F>aid thus unto me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, Sir, you <U+017F>hould har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<U+017F>uch <U+017F>trange thoughts of ruining your <U+017F>elfe? Ah my friend, <U+017F>aid I unto him, I <U+017F>hall
not be <U+017F>o ruined here, but griefe and <U+017F>orrows will find me out. And <U+017F>o they may very
well, <U+017F>ir, (<U+017F>aid he unto me) as long as you doe thus forget your <U+017F>elfe, and what you were
wont to be, in <U+017F>o much as you will not endeavour your happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and try if you can
re<U+017F>tore your <U+017F>elfe unto that <U+017F>tate which you have lo<U+017F>t. <hi>Halladine,</hi> (<U+017F>aid I and <U+017F>ighed) It
is the height of imprudence, to attempt things impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible. Why, <U+017F>ir, <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>hould you
give the name of impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible unto that which you have not tryed, nor has any rea<U+017F>on to
be <U+017F>o per<U+017F>waded? For my part, I have <U+017F>uch an opinion of my <U+017F>elfe, that any thing which
a <U+017F>ervant can doe is not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible; and I am much more certaine, that what<U+017F>oever any
Cavalier in Europe can obtaine, you can if you will. If this <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> who is the
cau<U+017F>e of your mi<U+017F>ery, had this con<U+017F>ideration, he would attempt to remove you from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donthe.</hi>
And why <U+017F>hould not you doe as much for him? you were once in her favour,
and he removed you; and believe it, <U+017F>ir, <U+017F>o may you him<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> for that which has once been
done, may be done againe. Do<U+017F>t thou not know, (<U+017F>aid I unto him) that <hi>Madonthe</hi> loves
him? Yes, <U+017F>aid he, And did <U+017F>he not once love you? But now, an<U+017F>wered I <U+017F>he wi<U+017F>hes me ill.
Have I not <U+017F>een, <U+017F>ir, an<U+017F>wered he, her <U+017F>corn him, and <U+017F>corn is much further from love then
hatred? Hatred, replyed I, is further from friend<U+017F>hip then <U+017F>corn: 'Tis true, replyed he,
but there is much difference between love and friend<U+017F>hip; for Love is more proud, and
never looks upon things that are de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>eable, but alwaies upon the rare<U+017F>t, highe<U+017F>t, and
mo<U+017F>t e<U+017F>timable things. And this is it which makes me thinke, that <hi>Madonthe</hi> after <U+017F>he
had <U+017F>corned <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>he did, and afterwards did love him; <U+017F>o <U+017F>he may
as well you, again<U+017F>t whom <U+017F>he had onely hatred, but never the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hadow of <U+017F>corn.
Friend, replied I, It is the love thou beare<U+017F>t unto me, moves thee to talke thus in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53527:62"/>
my advantage. I talk, Sir, replied he, as any that is without pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion may: Well, <U+017F>aid I
unto him, what is it thou would<U+017F>t have me do? My affection, <U+017F>ir, <U+017F>aid he, is it which
moves my tongue; and I be<U+017F>eech you <U+017F>ir, receive my language as proceeding from thence:
And <U+017F>ince you command me, let me tell you, I would have you a<U+017F><U+017F>ume the <U+017F>ame kinde
of life you were wont to live, and try if any happy encounter will help you to recover
that happine<U+017F>s which is ravi<U+017F>hed from you: For I cannot <U+017F>ee how it <U+017F>hould any way advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
you to <U+017F>tay here: I have ever had an opinion, that <hi>Madonthe</hi> does not hate you; or
if <U+017F>he doe hate you, yet that <U+017F>he does not love <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> <U+017F>o well as you imagine: or if
<U+017F>he doe love him, yet as <U+017F>he has changed once, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he may change againe: For I have
heard <U+017F>ay, that the whole world is nothing but change; but <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould change,
and yet believe you dead, this change would not availe you at all; whereas if <U+017F>he doe
but <U+017F>ee you, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould revive her fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>parks of good will unto you.
Put out a Candle, Sir, and bring it to another that is light, you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>uddainly
it will light againe: The heart of one who once loved, is of the <U+017F>ame nature, when it
comes in the pre<U+017F>ence of the per<U+017F>on loved; whereas ab<U+017F>ence puts all hopes out, and is the
very ruine and death of love.</p>
                     <p>Well, well, <hi>Halladine,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him, we will thinke upon it, and <U+017F>ee what the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
will advi<U+017F>e us unto; then turning me about, I <U+017F>eemed as if I had an inclination to
<U+017F>leep; and yet it was onely becau<U+017F>e I would not heare any more di<U+017F><U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions from my <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
humour: but the Candle being put out, and I not being able to <U+017F>leep <U+017F>o <U+017F>oone, I
began to con<U+017F>ult and con<U+017F>ider upon the rea<U+017F>ons and arguments which <hi>Halladine</hi> urged;
and finding them upon <U+017F>erious con<U+017F>ideration to be very <U+017F>olid and good; I was almo<U+017F>t in a
mind to leave this place, being e<U+017F>pecially invited unto it out of a pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant de<U+017F>ire of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For I hoped, that being in que<U+017F>t after adventures, I might perhaps meet with one
that would bring me to my death. Be<U+017F>ides this, I con<U+017F>idered that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for
me to <U+017F>tay long there and not be known, <U+017F>ince certainly tho<U+017F>e Fi<U+017F>hermen would be blab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
out all they knew of me: And being not far from the place where <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi>
kept his Court, I could very hardly conceal my <U+017F>elf any longer.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, and <U+017F>ome others which I will omit, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hould be too tedious
in my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, did move me to take the advice which <hi>Halladine</hi> gave: And as <U+017F>oon as
it was day I walked, then told him that I would take his coun<U+017F>ell; and that he <U+017F>hould
look out to buy Hor<U+017F>es for him<U+017F>elfe and me, al<U+017F>o to provide me Arms and other things
requi<U+017F>ite. Away he went immediately, the gladde<U+017F>t man in the world to <U+017F>ee me in this
mind: and though he made all the ha<U+017F>te that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could, yet he <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>ome
twelve or fifteen dayes before he could get my Arms fitted unto my directions. During
his ab<U+017F>ence, I grew more <U+017F>olitary and private then before, in <U+017F>o much as the good old
man did wonder at me. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that at this time, I often di<U+017F>puted with my
<U+017F>elfe, whether I <U+017F>hould break Pri<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>hake off my <U+017F>hakles or no, and u<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
as might be urged by Genero<U+017F>ity unto a man of courage, I was a while <U+017F>tagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in my re<U+017F>olutions. But this all-commanding Love, whom none is able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e
by flying, did out of <U+017F>pite, load me with new Fetters, and renewed my chains by new
meanes, <U+017F>o as I plainly <U+017F>aw there was now no hopes of ever having liberty.</p>
                     <p>The Fi<U+017F>hers, Madam, with whom I often talked when they came to <U+017F>ee me, as well to
know how I did, as in gratitude for the money which I had given them for their paines:
and becau<U+017F>e they carried their Fi<U+017F>h once a week unto the Town where <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> dwelt,
to <U+017F>ell them there, they would oftentimes bring me the news of the Town. There was
one among<U+017F>t them, who was elder then the re<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>hewed to have more wit, of whom
I u<U+017F>ed to enquire; and asking him what was the talk of the Town, he an<U+017F>wered, that all
the talk was of a great Lady, who was brough to bed of a Childe; and becau<U+017F>e the
Lawes of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> was to puni<U+017F>h <U+017F>uch by fire, <U+017F>he was condemned unto it. Ob<U+017F>erve,
Madam, how the heart will <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>oretell <U+017F>uch things as it feares: and though I did
never in my life, <U+017F>ee any action in <hi>Madonthe</hi> which could in rea<U+017F>on move me to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect her
guilty of <U+017F>uch a fault; yet I did pre<U+017F>ently think it was <U+017F>he? And for more a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, I
asked him the name of this Lady, but he told me that he had forgotten it; yet he a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ured
me <U+017F>he was one of the principal Ladies who was unmarried.</p>
                     <p>Then did I take my <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions for certainties, when I reflected upon the kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e which
was betwixt her and <hi>Ther<U+017F>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>der;</hi> and becau<U+017F>e I would have no notice taken of my di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ure,
I was con<U+017F>trained to leave their company, and retired my <U+017F>elfe under <U+017F>ome Trees
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53527:63"/>
that were neere the hou<U+017F>e; and there being alone, oh what contrariety of thoughts came
into my mind to torment me? My vexation or rather my rage that I had been <U+017F>o extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guld, moved me to a de<U+017F>ire to revenge for this injury: But how <U+017F>uddenly did I check
my thoughts when I con<U+017F>idered my affection unto her: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>tifling all
thoughts of revenge, I could not re<U+017F>traine my teares, which flowed mo<U+017F>t abundantly
when I thought upon the mi<U+017F>erable condition unto which Fortune had brought me: I
had continued longer in this Labyrinth of confu<U+017F>ed thoughts, if <hi>Halladine</hi> who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
had not come to fetch me away. At fir<U+017F>t when I <U+017F>aw him, I did imagine that he
had <U+017F>omething to tell me, but dur<U+017F>t not, yet <U+017F>ince the old Fi<U+017F>herman had broke the ice,
I was <U+017F>o bold as to aske him. Come <hi>Halladine,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him, ha<U+017F>t thou provided
Armes and Hor<U+017F>es? Yes Sir, <U+017F>aid he, all are ready, and I thinke you will be well fitted<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
I have brought the Hor<U+017F>es hither, but I have left the Armes at the Townes end, where I
have cau<U+017F>ed them to be locked up: Thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>o long, replyed I, as I was almo<U+017F>t
out of all patience<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> But good <hi>Halladine,</hi> I charge thee upon thy Fidelity, to tell
me truly, ha<U+017F>t thou heard any newes of <hi>Madonthe?</hi> Shall I tell you Sir, <U+017F>aid he what
I know? With all my heart, replyed I, for I doe extreamly de<U+017F>ire it; I feare, replyed he
that I <U+017F>hall but vex and grieve you Sir, if I <U+017F>hould. Oh Heavens, <hi>Halladine</hi> (cryed I
out) thou ha<U+017F>t told me enough, my <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions are all truths; Is <U+017F>he condemned to the fire
for having a Child? tell me truly. Who<U+017F>oever told you <U+017F>o, replyed he, told you the
truth; but Sir, how came you to know it? The Fi<U+017F>hermen, replyed I, who u<U+017F>e to goe
and <U+017F>ell their fi<U+017F>h, are my informers: But <hi>Halladine</hi> I conjure thee to tell me all thou
knowe<U+017F>t, and conceal not any thing, as thou love<U+017F>t me. Sir, <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>ince you are plea<U+017F>ed
to command me with <U+017F>o many a<U+017F><U+017F>everations, I will; though I know that this new Newes
will vex you as much, as it ought to doe the contrary. Then he related unto me, how <U+017F>ince
the workmen required <U+017F>o much time, before they could fini<U+017F>h my Armes, he thought
that he could not <U+017F>pend his time better, than in going to Court, being confident that I
would be glad of newes at his returne; that being there as privately as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could,
he was put unto no great matter of paines for newes, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Madonthe</hi> was the Towne
talke all over; that <hi>Leriana</hi> was her Accu<U+017F>er, and that <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his brother would
maintaine what <hi>Leriana</hi> <U+017F>aid, concerning her and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander.</hi> How, replyed I pre<U+017F>ently,
is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that <hi>Madonthe</hi> <U+017F>hould looke <U+017F>o low, as upon a man <U+017F>o ba<U+017F>e? <hi>Halladine,</hi>
who thought that this con<U+017F>ideration might make me <U+017F>corne her. Yes Sir, <U+017F>aid he, it is <U+017F>o
held for certaine, and con<U+017F>idering what proofes <hi>Leriana</hi> makes, none beleeves the
contrary.</p>
                     <p>I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e Madam, that hearing this newes confirmed, I was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>ht at it, as
but for <hi>Halladine,</hi> I had falne to the ground. At la<U+017F>t, recollecting my <U+017F>elfe, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a pace or two, I folded my armes one with the other, and lifting up my eyes to
heaven, with a deep <U+017F>igh I <U+017F>aid: Oh God, how deep are thy judgements? and by how
many <U+017F>trange wayes do<U+017F>t thou di<U+017F>cover truth? Then <U+017F>tanding a while <U+017F>ilent, as ravi<U+017F>hed
with admiration, at la<U+017F>t I broke out againe. Oh <hi>Madonthe,</hi> is it then true, that you
have made choice of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and preferred him before me, was your <U+017F>pirit <U+017F>o low,
as to make him Lord of your will, whom your Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors did highly honour in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him their Servant? Is is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that generous heart which heretofore I have <U+017F>eene
in you <U+017F>hould be thus changed, As not to die rather than endure the <U+017F>hame of <U+017F>uch a
choice? Oh God, oh Heavens, why would you infu<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a ba<U+017F>e di<U+017F><U+017F>embling <U+017F>pirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<U+017F>o faire a body?</p>
                     <p>After this, I <U+017F>tood a long while <U+017F>ilent, as having <U+017F>o much to <U+017F>ay, that I could not <U+017F>peake
at all, re<U+017F>embling a bottle that is full which will not come out but with <U+017F>ome difficulty.
<hi>Halladine</hi> who con<U+017F>idered my affection, thinking to comfort me, and <U+017F>eeing me <U+017F>o long
<U+017F>ilent, he took occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>peak unto me. Had I thought Sir, <U+017F>aid he, that this news would
have reli<U+017F>hed <U+017F>o ill, you <U+017F>hould never have known it by me: Why <hi>Halladine,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him
coulde<U+017F>t thou ever thinke I would not be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of her <U+017F>hame whom I loved above all the
world? And why <U+017F>hould you doe <U+017F>o Sir, replyed he, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he proves a per<U+017F>on who has
given you occa<U+017F>ion to hate her above all the World. Love, replyed I, is greater in me,
than any wrong can be in her, and do<U+017F>t thou not know that the wound which is once
made will never heale? If maladies may be cured by Antipathy, and contrary medicines,
replyed <hi>Halladine,</hi> then that love which was cau<U+017F>ed by vertues and favours may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in you by the injuries which you have received from her, and by the knowledge of <U+017F>o
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53527:63"/>
foule a fault. That which cau<U+017F>eth love, <U+017F>aid I unto him, is fate and de<U+017F>tiny unto whom
the heavens have <U+017F>ubmitted it, and therefore there is no thought that it will change, untill
the very heavens and de<U+017F>tiny them<U+017F>elves doe change: And as for matter of <U+017F>hame I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to be her Champion again<U+017F>t all tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>hall oppo<U+017F>e her fame with
any Calumny. Heavens forbid it Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto me, for you will have to deale with
two of the <U+017F>turdie<U+017F>t Cavaliers in all <hi>Aquitane;</hi> be<U+017F>ides you will too apparently wrong
your <U+017F>elfe, and exceedingly offend a ju<U+017F>t God in maintaining a quarrell that is unju<U+017F>t.
As for the valour of <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his brother (<U+017F>aid unto him) it is not unknowne unto
me, and it <U+017F>hall not be that which <U+017F>hall divert me from the Combate: But as to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
which you mention to be again<U+017F>t God, I doe referre it unto him, <U+017F>ince it is his
plea<U+017F>ure to make me love <hi>Madonthe</hi> <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, as it is a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to
doe otherwi<U+017F>e. Good Sir, <U+017F>aid he, will you offer to imploy your courage in taking arms
for the defence of one who has mo<U+017F>t unworthily u<U+017F>ed you? are you not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of <U+017F>uch
injuries, and would you have all the World take notice of this in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility? Doe you
not remember how in<U+017F>upportably rigorous <U+017F>he was to you, whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was in the arms of
<hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and loaded him with more favours than he could de<U+017F>ire? Will you again<U+017F>t
all rea<U+017F>on expo<U+017F>e your life in defence of one who to content another, <U+017F>corned you? Shall
it be ever <U+017F>aid that you did unju<U+017F>tly arme your <U+017F>elfe to pre<U+017F>erve the plea<U+017F>ures and delights
of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander?</hi> He would have continued longer had not I interrupted him. Enough,
enough <hi>Halladine,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him, no more of this language to me; the <U+017F>tone is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
throwne, and it cannot be recalled; I am fully re<U+017F>olved upon it, all that thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>aid
or can <U+017F>ay, cannot unre<U+017F>olve me</p>
                     <p>When I doe thinke upon <hi>Madonthes</hi> death, and that I <U+017F>hall never <U+017F>ee her more whom
I doe love <U+017F>o well; when I con<U+017F>ider the paine and confu<U+017F>ion in which <U+017F>he is, and the <U+017F>hame
which is prepared for her, and when I doe remember, it is <U+017F>he whom <hi>Damon</hi> hath <U+017F>o long
<U+017F>erved, and that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t now be throwne into the Fire. Oh God, oh Heavens, <hi>Halla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi>
do<U+017F>t thou thinke I am able to indure it? and can any injury or <U+017F>corne hinder me
from giving her all the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance I can? No, no, <hi>Halladine, Damon</hi> mu<U+017F>t either cea<U+017F>e
to live, or el<U+017F>e he mu<U+017F>t not cea<U+017F>e from doing what is his duty: It is the duty of a Cavalier to
relieve afflicted and di<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Ladies, whether this Lady be accu<U+017F>ed ju<U+017F>tly or unju<U+017F>tly God
knows; as for us we ought rather to think the be<U+017F>t, than to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect the wor<U+017F>t: And <U+017F>ince
<hi>Leriana</hi> is her accu<U+017F>er, I mu<U+017F>t thinke <hi>Madonthe</hi> wronged, knowing the extreame malice
which <U+017F>he beares unto her; I will therefore render <hi>Madonthe</hi> this proofe of my affection.
I know, <hi>Halladine,</hi> thou wilt <U+017F>ay that <U+017F>he will thanke me no more for this <U+017F>ervice than
for others <U+017F>he hath received from me but, friend, it is no matter if <U+017F>he do not; I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>atisfie
my duty in it, and then I have the recompence I expect. My Servant <U+017F>eeing me <U+017F>o fully
<U+017F>etled upon it, he told me, that <U+017F>ince I was <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olved, he could doe no more but pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God for a ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing upon my intentions and endeavours; but if I would execute my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne,
I mu<U+017F>t not lo<U+017F>e a minute of time: For the la<U+017F>t hour which the King had given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> would expire to morrow by noone, and that from the place where we
were, the neere<U+017F>t way was five Leagues at the lea<U+017F>t unto the Towne of <hi>Tecto<U+017F>ages,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
eight Leagues to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e by the place where my Arms lay; <U+017F>o as it was full time to
depart that very hour.</p>
                     <p>Upon this intelligence, I re<U+017F>olved to take Hor<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ently; and lea<U+017F>t the good old
Druid <U+017F>hould make me lo<U+017F>e any time, I thought it be<U+017F>t to depart without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him untill afterwards, and then if I proved victorious, I would make my excu<U+017F>e,
and thanke him for the great obligations wherein I was bound unto him. I tooke Hor<U+017F>e
then, and made all ha<U+017F>te I could to the place where my Armes lay, I tryed them, and
found them to be very good and fit, they were blacke, and on the Shield a Tyger fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon the heart of a man with this Motto.
<q>Thou giv'<U+017F>t me death, and I <U+017F>u<U+017F>taine thy life.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then, without more delay, I rode to the Town of <hi>Tecto<U+017F>ages,</hi> and made <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te,
as I came a little before noon: I alighted, to give my Hor<U+017F>e a little re<U+017F>t, for indeed he
was weary; and this might well have been <hi>Madonthes</hi> ruine; for when I came to the li<U+017F>ts,
I found the Combate already begun, but one Cavalier again<U+017F>t two: and certainly had I
<U+017F>tayed never <U+017F>o little longer that Cavalier had dyed, and <hi>Madonthe</hi> been convicted; for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53527:64"/>
he fell into a <U+017F>woon when I was entred not ten paces into the li<U+017F>ts; and had he falne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I had entred, the Combate had been ended, and it would not have been permitted me
to begin it againe: But God was plea<U+017F>ed I <U+017F>hould arrive <U+017F>o opportunely, as the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of that Lady was made known: For to omit the particulars of the Combate, it will
<U+017F>uffice to tell you, that it plea<U+017F>ed God to give me victory over the<U+017F>e two valiant Brothers,
who were overcome rather by the innocency of <hi>Madonthe,</hi> then any <U+017F>trength or virtue in
me, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o, that being armed for the life and honour of my mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e
could not re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t me.</p>
                     <p>Thus I was victorious; and when I lea<U+017F>t though of it, the truth was manife<U+017F>ted; <hi>Leri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
detected, <hi>Madonthe</hi> cleared; the Childe known to belong unto one that was Neece
unto <hi>Leriana:</hi> and to be briefe, all things <U+017F>o cleared, that the wicked <hi>Leriana</hi> was ca<U+017F>t
into the <U+017F>ame fire which <U+017F>he had prepared for <hi>Madonthe; Madonthe</hi> <U+017F>et at liberty, and
I the gladde<U+017F>t man that ever was, to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>he had beene wrongfully accu<U+017F>ed: and that
though <U+017F>he had injured me, yet it was without the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>taine unto her honour or cha<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This was <U+017F>uch a high contentment unto me, as I e<U+017F>teemed all the paines I had
taken in her <U+017F>ervice, more then recompenced.</p>
                     <p>Seeing this thus <U+017F>ettled, and thinking it not expedient to make my <U+017F>elfe known, untill
I knew a little better whether or no <U+017F>he loved <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander;</hi> or whether all that I had <U+017F>een
concerning it, was onely the artifice and <U+017F>ubtilty of <hi>Leriana,</hi> I went unto her <U+017F>caffold,
to know whether I could <U+017F>erve her in any other occa<U+017F>ion: She gave me many thanks, and
had two reque<U+017F>ts unto me; the one was, to tell her who I was; &amp; the other, to conduct her
unto her hou<U+017F>e: As for telling her my Name, I excu<U+017F>ed it as well as I could; and as for
conducting her, I <U+017F>aid I would, upon condition it might be pre<U+017F>ently: And becau<U+017F>e at
the <U+017F>ame time, a throng of Ladies came to congratulate her delivery, and al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e I
feared the King would cau<U+017F>e me to declare my <U+017F>elfe, al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e I had <U+017F>ome wounds
which required dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I went into the croud and <U+017F>o <U+017F>tole away; <U+017F>o as every one being
diverted another way, none took any notice which way I went: And <U+017F>o I came to the
place where I left my <U+017F>ervant, where binding up my wounds as well as I could, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my Hor<U+017F>e graze a little, I got up againe, and went to my good old Druid.</p>
                     <p>I forgot to tell you, Madam, That meeting a man going to the Town, I entreated him
to make my excu<U+017F>e unto <hi>Madonthe;</hi> and, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould think me uncivil, I feigned to
be engaged another way by promi<U+017F>e, but if <U+017F>he had any further <U+017F>ervice to imploy me in,
<U+017F>he might hear of me towards <hi>Mount d'Or,</hi> and that I would <U+017F>till weare my en<U+017F>igne of a
Tiger. My de<U+017F>igne was, to make her believe I was gone that way, though I did not intend
it, lea<U+017F>t the Kings curio<U+017F>ity <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uch as to find out who I was.</p>
                     <p>I cannot, Madam, expre<U+017F><U+017F>e unto you, with what joy the good Druid received me, nor
his thankes, when he knew the cau<U+017F>e of my voyage, and the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>ervice I had
done <hi>Madonthe</hi> in her great nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity: For he told me, that her Father brought him up;
and that in this action I had over paid him, for all the paines and care he had taken about
me. And becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw my arms bloody, he took them off, and looked about every part
of me; then finding <U+017F>ome wounds, he was <U+017F>o careful of me, and took <U+017F>uch cour<U+017F>es, as I
was well again in a little time.</p>
                     <p>But <U+017F>ince the be<U+017F>t Phy<U+017F>ick, and no other could cure me, but to hear more of <hi>Madonthe,</hi>
I intreated the good old Druid to <U+017F>end one of the Fi<U+017F>hers unto the place where <hi>Thori<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
was, to inquire what newes. The good man did as I de<U+017F>ired, and the Fi<U+017F>her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<U+017F>o well, as at his return he brought me but too much newes for my contentment:
That <hi>Madonthe</hi> was gone to her hou<U+017F>e, and carried <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> with her wounded as he
was; for it was he who before I came, was in Combate with <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother. I
under<U+017F>tood farther, that a little after the departure of <hi>Madonthe,</hi> how King <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi>
was killed by his Chyrurgion, who in letting him blood had cut the vein, and that his
brother <hi>Eurick</hi> <U+017F>ucceeded him. I cannot expre<U+017F><U+017F>e, Madam, how near the<U+017F>e two accidents
went unto my heart; onely thus far, I never think upon them, but the memory is <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad,
as I conclude no re<U+017F>t belongs unto me but in my Grave.</p>
                     <p>Thus every thing from whence I expected comfort, augments my mi<U+017F>ery; all my hopes
are now quite bla<U+017F>ted, <U+017F>olitary places di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed, becau<U+017F>e there I thought upon nothing
but the Towne of <hi>Tecto<U+017F>ages,</hi> and my thoughts grated upon my very <U+017F>oul, when
they repre<U+017F>ented unto me the ingratitude of this woman. To be brief, I was angry with my
<U+017F>elfe, becau<U+017F>e I loved her again<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on, and could not chu<U+017F>e but love her. My condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

grew wor<U+017F>e then ever; my wounds indeed being but <U+017F>mall, did heal in a few days;
but I became <U+017F>o pale as if I were dead, and this palene<U+017F><U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ently after turned into <U+017F>uch
a yellowne<U+017F><U+017F>e, as if I had rubbed my <U+017F>elfe with Saffron. <hi>Halladine,</hi> who had heard <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>Madonthes</hi> actions, did <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect what the cau<U+017F>e was of my being thus di<U+017F>ordered,
and watched for an opportunity of <U+017F>peaking unto me But the good old man not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what to thinke, he advi<U+017F>ed me to change aire, hoping that exerci<U+017F>e and diver<U+017F>ion
might recover my health; and I according to the advice of this good man, re<U+017F>olved to
<U+017F>ee the world, and wander from place to place, and re<U+017F>t no where, till death arre<U+017F>ted
me.</p>
                     <p>After then, I had given mo<U+017F>t hearty thankes unto this good man, I departed, without
any other de<U+017F>igne in my voyage, than continuall wandring: yet as fortune was, our way
did lie towards <hi>Madonthes</hi> hou<U+017F>e, where we heard <U+017F>uch newes, as did more and more ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
my mi<U+017F>ery. For we heard<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that this ill advi<U+017F>ed woman (as <hi>Halladine</hi> calls her)
was gone, or rather <U+017F>tolne away, without any in her company but her Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Imagine what operation this report had upon me; my Servant would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded
me, that <U+017F>he did me no wrong in it, but onely her<U+017F>elfe; for <U+017F>he believing me to be
dead, as all <hi>Aquitane</hi> did, I had no rea<U+017F>on to blame her: But however, my di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
was <U+017F>o great, as not being able to endure the <U+017F>ight of <U+017F>uch places where formerly
I found <U+017F>uch delight, and now di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure; I re<U+017F>olved to leave <hi>Europe,</hi> and never to
leave wandring till I met with <U+017F>omething that would <U+017F>horten my <U+017F>ad life. So I pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed
into <hi>Africa,</hi> there I <U+017F>aw King <hi>Gen<U+017F>erick</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> his Son, and found every where

changes and rechanges, delights and di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures, in all tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>ubjects
unto it, according to its own plea<U+017F>ure without any rea<U+017F>on. For being among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi>
I heard of the fortunes of <hi>Ur<U+017F>a<U+017F>es</hi> and <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and of young <hi>Placidia,</hi> and her
Mother <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> wife unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> all whom by their examples, could not divert
me from <U+017F>till loving; but I learned rather this le<U+017F><U+017F>on, That who<U+017F>oever will love, mu<U+017F>t
prepare them<U+017F>elves for good and bad, and receive them both with the <U+017F>ame vi<U+017F>age. And
con<U+017F>idering the various changes in the fortune of <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> the long per<U+017F>ervance of <hi>Ur<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es</hi>

but thence forward, to endure them with more patience. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Halladine</hi> who
was tired out with my long and tedious travels, did advi<U+017F>e me not to love her any longer,
who did not think me <U+017F>o much as in the world, thinking that if he could bring me to
this con<U+017F>ideration, I <U+017F>hould ea<U+017F>ily be per<U+017F>waded to return into <hi>Aquitane:</hi> I told him, to

Coun<U+017F>ells; <U+017F>o as hearing that at the further end of the <hi>Pirenian</hi> hills towards the

my importunity, the Oracle was mute, and would give no other an<U+017F>wer but
<hi>Forre<U+017F>ts;</hi> <U+017F>o as I re<U+017F>olved to look for <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi> all <hi>Europe</hi> over. I will not tell you, Madam,
how many <U+017F>everall places I pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and all in vaine, onely in generall; how after I had
run through all <hi>Spain, Cantabria, Gaul, Narbon,</hi> and <hi>Aquitane,</hi> I came into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the <hi>Gebennes,</hi> and re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>ee <hi>Hircania</hi> and <hi>Ardennes,</hi> and all other places
through the world: For I cannot be per<U+017F>waded, that this God who is mo<U+017F>t true and ju<U+017F>t
unto all other men, <U+017F>hould be a deceiver unto me alone: but on the contrary, I hope
that in the<U+017F>e <U+017F>olitary places I <U+017F>hall finde that contentment which is promi<U+017F>ed unto
me.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Damon</hi> concluded the Hi<U+017F>tory of his mi<U+017F>erable life. And <hi>Galathea,</hi> who had
formerly heard the fir<U+017F>t part, was very glad <U+017F>he had heard the re<U+017F>t, and de<U+017F>ired to give him
all the contentment this Country afforded. Therefore when he had fini<U+017F>hed, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid
thus unto him. I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>ir, you have rea<U+017F>on to complaine again<U+017F>t your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
having without any rea<U+017F>on been <U+017F>o long afflicted, but <U+017F>till you mu<U+017F>t not let your
hopes droop: for the Gods are no Impo<U+017F>tors, nor deceivers; and having received <U+017F>uch an

an<U+017F>wer from them, you mu<U+017F>t beleeve that you <U+017F>hall find that contentment which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire.
Tis true they are plea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ometimes to give ambiguous and ob<U+017F>cure an<U+017F>wers, and
that to teach us, that there is no happine<U+017F><U+017F>e to be obtained without a mixture of mi<U+017F>ery,
and that they are plea<U+017F>ed humane wits <U+017F>hould bu<U+017F>ie them<U+017F>elves in finding out the truth,
and true meaning of their Oracles; and if you will have my opinion upon this an<U+017F>wer
you have received, I think you have not rightly under<U+017F>tood it, in conceiving that this word
<hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> does <U+017F>ignifie Woods and <U+017F>olitary places, peopled only with Trees; but you mu<U+017F>t
know that this Country wherein you now are, is not only called the Country of the <hi>Segu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iaus,</hi>
but more particularly called <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts,</hi> <U+017F>o as I do beleeve, it is this <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi> in which the
Oracle intends you <U+017F>hall find that happine<U+017F>s which you are to receive. And to tell you truly
it is very probable that this is the Country and place, and not in Woods &amp; places <U+017F>olitary:
For it may <U+017F>o fall out that <hi>Madonthe</hi> may come hither upon <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ion which may be
hid from you; therefore take heart, and beleeve, that as one evill never comes alone, <U+017F>o one
good is alwayes accompanied with another. It is a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e you <U+017F>hould light upon the
place which the Oracle foretels <U+017F>hall put an end unto your mi<U+017F>eries, and ere long it will
be <U+017F>econded with <U+017F>uch another as may afford you the effects of all.</p>
                     <p>Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Damon</hi> and <U+017F>ighed, I find all you <U+017F>ay to be grounded upon great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,

nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the Sacrifice, both for you and me. In the the meane time our Coaches and

Who is it, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> whom <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> loves? I can onely tell you, Madam,
replyed he; that <U+017F>he is <U+017F>ad and melancholly, and they <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e a Shepherd was
drowned about four or five Months <U+017F>ince. And <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Nymph, is <U+017F>he in love
with any? They <U+017F>ay No, an<U+017F>wered he, &amp; yet there are two about her who torment her much
if <U+017F>he doe not love them; the one is called <hi>Paris,</hi> and the other <hi>Silvander;</hi> the truth is, if
I were to chu<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hould give my voice for <hi>Silvander;</hi> for though he be but a <U+017F>hepherd,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53527:65"/>
yet I never <U+017F>aw one more Gentile, nor civili<U+017F>ed. If thou goe<U+017F>t on, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> thou
wilt make us all de<U+017F>irous to become <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, onely to enjoy <U+017F>uch good company.
Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, you may chance beleeve the<U+017F>e to be but Fables, but I am confident
two or three dayes could not, be better imployed then among<U+017F>t them. Then <hi>Galathea</hi>
turning towards the aged <hi>Cleontine.</hi> Mother, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I am halfe in a mind to <U+017F>tay here
two or three dayes, that <hi>Damon</hi> may a little ea<U+017F>e his wounds whil<U+017F>t in the interim walk
towards <hi>Lignon,</hi> and <U+017F>ee whether all the<U+017F>e reports of the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es be true. Madam
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cleontine,</hi> their conver<U+017F>ation is the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t and plea<U+017F>ante<U+017F>t you can imagine;
and beleeve it, there is nothing of Ru<U+017F>tique in them but the name, <U+017F>o as if you de<U+017F>ire to
take that plea<U+017F>ure, now is the mo<U+017F>t conveniency; for the great Druid is to come and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a <U+017F>olemne <U+017F>acrifice of thankes unto <hi>Tautates</hi> for the Mis<U+017F>leto, which is found neer their
Towne, What kind of ceremony is that? asked <hi>Galathea;</hi> for they u<U+017F>e to gather this
Mis<U+017F>leto the <U+017F>ixteenth of the Month of <hi>July.</hi> Tis true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cleontine,</hi> but this is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <U+017F>acrifice of Thanks, that <hi>Tautates</hi> would be plea<U+017F>ed to honour that place with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any other, and making it to grow, as they <U+017F>ay, upon the goodlie<U+017F>t Oake that ever
was <U+017F>een, and in thus favouring that Towne it is a <U+017F>igne he loves it above others. How do
you know (<U+017F>aid the Nymph) that the great Druid comes now to performe this Sacrifice?
becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> he promi<U+017F>ed it <U+017F>hould be within eight dayes, whereof four are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
pa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o as if he keepe his word, he cannot deferre it no longer: And I am certaine,
his ha<U+017F>te would be the more, did he know it was your plea<U+017F>ure to honour the <U+017F>olemnity
with your prefence.</p>
                     <p>This made <hi>Galathea</hi> re<U+017F>olve to retard her journey unto <hi>Bon-lieu,</hi> as well to ea<U+017F>e <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>

the occa<U+017F>ion of his coming into this Country. As<U+017F>oone as <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> received this Newes,
<U+017F>he was much plea<U+017F>ed, and much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed both: For <U+017F>he was very glad to heare that
<hi>Damon</hi> was alive, whom <U+017F>he thought dead, becau<U+017F>e he was her Kin<U+017F>man in a near de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and the carriage of <hi>Polemas</hi> did extreamly di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her, it being again<U+017F>t a per<U+017F>on
of <U+017F>o much merit, and in the pre<U+017F>ence of her daughter, whom it was his duty to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
And to <U+017F>hew how ill <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ented it, <U+017F>he tooke Coach immediately, and went as
fa<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he could unto <hi>Mount Verdan,</hi> where her daughter was amazed at her <U+017F>udden co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and asked her the rea<U+017F>on of her <U+017F>udden re<U+017F>olution. She told her that <U+017F>he came to
<U+017F>ee <hi>Damon,</hi> and offer him what<U+017F>oever was in her power, as her Kin<U+017F>man, and as one who
had much obliged her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Damon</hi> being adverti<U+017F>ed of her coming, he aro<U+017F>e out of bed to meet her for his wounds
were <U+017F>uch as he might doe it without danger, but being <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed upon <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>udden he
accoa<U+017F>ted her onely with excu<U+017F>es, and thankes for <U+017F>o great a favour. I am obliged, <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he, unto you more than this, as well by con<U+017F>anguinity, as by memory of him who gave you
life, who at the returne with <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> King of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots,</hi> made unto <hi>Tecto<U+017F>ages,</hi>
after he had fought <hi>Attilas</hi> in the <hi>Catalaunique</hi> fields with <U+017F>o great an Army, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the ruine of this Country, turning his pa<U+017F><U+017F>age by the <hi>Sequanois,</hi> by the lower <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broges,</hi>
by the <hi>Veblomiens,</hi> and by the Mountaines of <hi>Gebbenes,</hi> and <U+017F>o into his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And this Obligation was not <U+017F>o little as it was thought of: For the young King I
know not how, did fall in love with one of my Nymphs, who having no mind to marry
he ravi<U+017F>hed her away by force, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e upon my in<U+017F>tigation of her unto that deniall.</p>
                     <p>Madam (an<U+017F>wered the Cavalier) all men are obliged to <U+017F>erve Ladies, particularly tho<U+017F>e
of your quality and merit: And my father in doing you this little <U+017F>ervice, which you are
plea<U+017F>ed to remember, did right unto the title of a Cavalier; and I <U+017F>ucceeding him, doe
offer unto you my blood and life.</p>
                     <p>Much more di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of civility pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed betwixt them, &amp; in conclu<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he told him, that
<U+017F>he would have him carryed unto <hi>Marcelles</hi> in a Litter, that his wounds might be there
better looked unto: But he excu<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o, as <U+017F>he permitted him to <U+017F>tay there for <U+017F>ome
dayes till his wounds were better: and this he de<U+017F>ired, becau<U+017F>e he would be more quiet,
and out of the world, <U+017F>ince <hi>Madonthe</hi> was not in it for him, re<U+017F>olving that as <U+017F>oon as
he had con<U+017F>ulted with the Oracle, and conducted <hi>Galathea</hi> to her Mother, he would get

                        <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>eeing he would not <U+017F>tir from the place where he was, and fearing to be too
trouble<U+017F>ome unto him if <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed any longer, becau<U+017F>e the hou<U+017F>e was little; <U+017F>he returned
unto <hi>Marcelles</hi> after many excu<U+017F>es, for the di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ie which <hi>Polemas</hi> had <U+017F>hewed unto
him, and which <U+017F>he prote<U+017F>ted <U+017F>hould not pa<U+017F><U+017F>e unpuni<U+017F>hed. <hi>Damon</hi> who was all <U+017F>weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e

no more upon it, becau<U+017F>e it was a thing above his merit; and becau<U+017F>e the offence of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas</hi>
was <U+017F>ufficiently puni<U+017F>hed by the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of his kin<U+017F>man. He did <U+017F>o extenuate the fault,
that though <hi>Galathea</hi> who was extreamly offended at <hi>Polemas</hi> for being <U+017F>o in<U+017F>olent in
her pre<U+017F>ence, did give the crime all due aggravations; yet <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> promi<U+017F>ed <hi>Damon</hi>
to doe what<U+017F>oever he de<U+017F>ired, intending to give him all the <U+017F>atisfaction and contentment
<U+017F>he could: Yet at her return unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> <U+017F>he did let <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>ee how much this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed her, though he excu<U+017F>ed it as well as he could, <U+017F>aying it was not done by
his command: but whil<U+017F>t he was bu<U+017F>ie in helping <hi>Arganteus,</hi> his <U+017F>ouldiers <U+017F>eeing him
in that ca<U+017F>e, would needs revenge his death. <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> who was very well informed how all
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, commanded him to turn off his <U+017F>ervice all <U+017F>uch unworthy per<U+017F>ons, as would offer
<U+017F>uch a ba<U+017F>e act; which <hi>Polemas</hi> did with <U+017F>o ill a will, and was <U+017F>o vexed again<U+017F>t <hi>Damon,</hi> as he
re<U+017F>olved to be revenged upon him. Be<U+017F>ides, he being of an envious nature, and <U+017F>eeing how
much the Nymph did e<U+017F>teem him, he was not able to endure it. But that which came
neere<U+017F>t the quick, was, that having <U+017F>ome hopes of marrying <hi>Galathea,</hi> and finding that he
could not with all his tricks make her love him, he began to contrive the meanes how he

Love denyed him: he was the more induced unto this enterpri<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>aw much
facility in bringing it about; <hi>Clidemant</hi> being ab<U+017F>ent; with <hi>Lindamore, Gugamant,</hi> and
all the Grandees of the Country: All the chief places of <U+017F>trength in his hands, and all
the Souldiers li<U+017F>ted; and being backed by a great number of his kindred and allies, both
within and without the State: Al<U+017F>o, on the contrary, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> having nothing but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tice
on her <U+017F>ide, having conferred all the power upon that faith and confidence <U+017F>he had in
him.</p>
                     <p>He thus a<U+017F>piring unto this enterpri<U+017F>e, and being prompted thereunto by Love and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
he could not <U+017F>ee any able to give him a <U+017F>top; for <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> had not one Cavalier
which had not dependence upon him, and were under his Authority, except <hi>Damon,</hi> who
though <U+017F>ingle, made him afraid of his valour: And fearing that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> being di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
by this la<U+017F>t action, <U+017F>hould keep him in the Country, and confer Authority upon him
by the <U+017F>un-<U+017F>hine of her favours, he re<U+017F>olved to prevent it. For he remembred that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
the Father of this Cavalier <U+017F>hould once have married <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and all the great
value and e<U+017F>teem which <U+017F>he now <U+017F>et upon him, he did attribute it unto the remembrance
<U+017F>he had of that. This con<U+017F>ideration was a cau<U+017F>e, why taking a<U+017F>ide <U+017F>ix of the Souldiers
whom <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> had commanded him to di<U+017F>charge; he <U+017F>poke thus unto them, after he

                     <p>The<U+017F>e Souldiers were <U+017F>oon per<U+017F>waded by <U+017F>uch an Orator, and promi<U+017F>ed to attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <U+017F>tranger what he had propounded; as for their parts, they had no other con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
but to obey him; and at the danger of their lives, to keep up his grandure and
authority.</p>
                     <p>This attempt being thus re<U+017F>olved upon, the next morning, he a<U+017F><U+017F>embled together all tho<U+017F>e
who were with him that day, and who had a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted <hi>Damon;</hi> and told them, that by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>e
command from <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> he commanded them, not onely to retire from his <U+017F>ervice,
but to depart the Country within <U+017F>ix days; that he was <U+017F>orry to treat them <U+017F>o but he mu<U+017F>t
obey; that they mu<U+017F>t not fail upon paine of death; and yet not being able to forget
tho<U+017F>e good <U+017F>ervices which he had received from them, he promi<U+017F>ed to obtaine the favour
of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> for them, as <U+017F>oon as he could, and to get them re<U+017F>tored into their former <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
And that they might be better able to <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the meane time, be<U+017F>ides their pay
which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> allowed for the time pa<U+017F>t, he would out of his own pur<U+017F>e give them three
moneths pay: de<U+017F>iring them not to be angry with him for it; but to believe that he did
execute this command with much griefe, being very <U+017F>orry to part from tho<U+017F>e that with <U+017F>o
much valour and fidelity had <U+017F>erved him, and in whom he had great confidence. By
this <U+017F>mooth language and <U+017F>hew of <U+017F>orrow to part with them, he did not onely get the
good will of tho<U+017F>e who were di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed, but of all the Souldiers be<U+017F>ides; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
did <U+017F>teal away their hearts from <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> which was no <U+017F>mall advancement to the
de<U+017F>ign which he had plotted in him<U+017F>elfe; for what he took from her, redounded unto
his advantage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adamas,</hi> who was extreamly de<U+017F>irous to welcome all the good company in his hou<U+017F>e,

their Town to offer the <U+017F>acrifice of Thanks; as <U+017F>oon as it was day, he ordered the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
to go before with their Cattle, and other things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary; and to give notice unto

the fair <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and all the re<U+017F>t of the company, did dre<U+017F><U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves, and took
the way unto the place where the Sacrifice was to be offered. <hi>Alexis,</hi> among<U+017F>t all the re<U+017F>t,

<hi>Lignon,</hi> and <U+017F>aw the place of her habitation: She did imagine that this voyage was
not reall, but a dream onely. As <U+017F>he was walking down a little hill with <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Hylas</hi>
did <U+017F>o awake her by his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, as <U+017F>he perceived it no dream, but a reall voyage; and
then <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o full of contentment, that every one might perceive it in her eyes and face.

                     <p>In the meane time they all walked on, a gentle but a merry pace, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>inging, others
talking, all doing <U+017F>omething or other to beguile the length of the way. <hi>Calidon</hi> who <U+017F>till

he walked <U+017F>ometimes before her, and <U+017F>ung <U+017F>ome ver<U+017F>es, which imported that to love her,
was recompence enough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hylas</hi> who was next him, and could not endure any of the<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>tinate affections, as <U+017F>oon
as <hi>Calidon</hi> ended, he <U+017F>ung <U+017F>ome other ver<U+017F>es which imported, that Let them change that
that would, for his part he would never change. Every one did laugh at the

him, tho<U+017F>e who accu<U+017F>e you of incon<U+017F>tancy, doe you much wrong, <U+017F>ince never was man
more con<U+017F>tant than you are: For from the very fir<U+017F>t time I ever <U+017F>aw you untill now, you
were <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame: Oh, good old Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid he unto her) I wonder you <U+017F>hould not
know this before now, have all the men and women of our age <U+017F>o little wit, as not to
know this truth? This, replyed <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled, is a bad recompence for a good office;
you call me old Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and doe you not know <hi>Hylas,</hi> that there is nothing under the
Sun more offends a woman than to be called old. I doe beleeve <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but it is
<U+017F>o long <U+017F>ince we were acquainted, that I thought it no injury. <hi>Daphnide,</hi> who was talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Adamas</hi> hearing tho<U+017F>e that were about <hi>Hylas</hi> to laugh <U+017F>o heartily, and being
de<U+017F>irous to know at what; <U+017F>he inquired of <hi>Diana,</hi> who was next her, and <U+017F>he acquainting
her with the cau<U+017F>e; I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that his humour is the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant
that any one can meet with, in his kind; and I beleeve all the company would be very
<U+017F>orry to lo<U+017F>e him. But I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, how long is it, <U+017F>ince fir<U+017F>t he came among<U+017F>t
you; what moved him to come, and what bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e has he here? To which Que<U+017F>tions,
<hi>Diana</hi> an<U+017F>wered, it is about four or five Months <U+017F>ince fir<U+017F>t he came; as for the cau<U+017F>e of
his <U+017F>tay, I thinke it is <U+017F>uperfluous to tell you, knowing his humour <U+017F>o well as you do, for
you may ea<U+017F>ily imagine it; but for the occa<U+017F>ion which brought him hither, I think none
knowes, except him<U+017F>elfe, not that he is of <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e and retired a temper, as that he will
not tell any thing, but becau<U+017F>e alwayes when he began to tell us his <U+017F>tory, either he has
been interrupted, or el<U+017F>e time would not <U+017F>erve him to tell it out: And I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elfe,
Madam, if you would but intimate the lea<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire of knowing it, he would without
any difficulty tell it, for he thinkes him<U+017F>elfe obliged unto any that will hearken unto
him in the relation of his fortunes.</p>
                     <p>I thinke, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide,</hi> that it would be a very good diver<U+017F>ion, if he would entertaine
us with it, and the way would <U+017F>eeme le<U+017F><U+017F>e tedious unto us: but the be<U+017F>t way to bring him
to it, will be this faire Druid, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and pointed at <hi>Alexis,</hi> if <U+017F>he would be plea<U+017F>ed to
command him. <hi>Alexis</hi> hearing her <U+017F>elfe named, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Daphnide</hi> point unto her, to
<U+017F>hew that <U+017F>he was not too <U+017F>erious in her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> did aske her if <U+017F>he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<U+017F>ervice to command her, and knowing by <hi>Diana</hi> what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that none has more power than your <U+017F>elfe, yet <U+017F>ince you are plea<U+017F>ed to
put me upon it, I will try what I can doe: Then calling unto him, Servant, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I
am growne very jealous. Faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you have no occa<U+017F>ion for it. Yes,
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) the occa<U+017F>ion is very great: For be<U+017F>ides the beauty of the<U+017F>e faire <U+017F>trangers,
which is occa<U+017F>ion enough; you know there is good rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect one of theft who is
accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>teale: You meane, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, that I have been accu<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to <U+017F>teale away the hearts of tho<U+017F>e who looke upon me, and you feare I <U+017F>hould doe
the like by the<U+017F>e new <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es; but never feare it, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e; for it may be I
<U+017F>hall commit this theft, but though I doe take their hearts, yet I promi<U+017F>e you, they <U+017F>hall
not take mine, for it is only yours. This a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, Servant, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> does plea<U+017F>e
me very well, but that is not my meaning: For it is, that the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers are very fair,
and you doe make it your glory and boa<U+017F>t to love all tho<U+017F>e who have any beauty. <hi>Hylas</hi>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:53527:67"/>
then going neerer <hi>Alexis,</hi> I perceive Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he unto her, that you doe not yet know
after what manner I u<U+017F>e to love. You mu<U+017F>t know that I u<U+017F>e to doe as Merchants u<U+017F>e;
when any of them has an intention to buy any commodity, they looke well upon it, and
con<U+017F>ider what it is worth, and lay by <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tocke of money as is equall to the worth
and as far as that <U+017F>um will go, they will bid, and no farther, and when they have bought
the commodity, they value it at <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>um as they gave, and <U+017F>pend accordingly: Now
I u<U+017F>e to doe the like; for when I fir<U+017F>t intend to love a Lady, I pre<U+017F>ently looke upon her
beauty (for you mu<U+017F>t know that it is beauty which <U+017F>ets the worth and value upon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
and when I have con<U+017F>idered the full value of it, pre<U+017F>ently I lay by a <U+017F>tocke of Love
in my <U+017F>oule, equall unto the price and value of beauty which <U+017F>he has, and when I love, I
bid <U+017F>o much as that <U+017F>tocke comes unto, and <U+017F>pend upon it. Then, after I have <U+017F>pent all
that <U+017F>um in her <U+017F>ervice, for whom I fir<U+017F>t laid it by, I have no more for her; but if I will
love, I mu<U+017F>t looke out for another beauty and lay by another <U+017F>um for it, <U+017F>o as in this, my
money and my love are alike; I mean, that when I have <U+017F>pent them, I can <U+017F>pend no more;
therefore Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, you might have <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on to feare, if I never had loved the<U+017F>e new
<U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es before, but it is <U+017F>o long <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>pent all <U+017F>tocke which I laid by for their
beauties as I have none left for them, my money is gone, and it will not come againe.
But Servant, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> Merchants that are rich, though they have once or twice emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
their pur<U+017F>es, yet will they fill them againe, to buy that at the <U+017F>econd bidding, which
they could not at the fir<U+017F>t. Perhaps they may, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> but Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>uch rich
Merchants and I am not alike; for they will chaffer and bid two or three times, whereas
I bid all at the fir<U+017F>t: be<U+017F>ides, if they have no money, they will borrow upon their credit,
and I <U+017F>pend and trade only upon my owne <U+017F>tock; This, replyed <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, is
the fine<U+017F>t way of loving that ever it was my fortune to heare of. It is <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> but
not very advantageous unto me, for I am affraid that you will quickly have <U+017F>pent your
<U+017F>tocke of Love, which you laid up for me, and then you will love me no longer. Tis
true indeed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that, <U+017F>hould I <U+017F>pend it all, you could not hope for any more in
me, but that is ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible; for when I fir<U+017F>t lay by a <U+017F>tocke of Love, I do make
it equal unto the beauty which I love, and yours being infinite, you mu<U+017F>t thinke that the
heap that I laid up to equall it, is a va<U+017F>t Mountaine. I am glad of it, replyed <hi>Alexis,</hi>
and e<U+017F>teeming you as I doe, <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry to lo<U+017F>e you; and this moves me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you, that if this Mountaine be not <U+017F>o big as you doe <U+017F>ay it is, you will abate a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and le<U+017F><U+017F>en your expences to the end your Provi<U+017F>ion may hold out the longer; I had
rather you would <U+017F>pend a little le<U+017F><U+017F>e, and imitate tho<U+017F>e good Husbands who <U+017F>pend one
day, as it may hold out the whole year. Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he pre<U+017F>ently, if that be all your
care, <U+017F>et your heart at re<U+017F>t, for my mountaine of Love to you, will la<U+017F>t as long as I live.
But good Servant, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> though your mountaine be as bigge as you <U+017F>ay, yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
you <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire mine <U+017F>hould be as big to you, lea<U+017F>t this love <U+017F>hould be lame,
and let downe of one <U+017F>ide? You <U+017F>ay very well, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> and I doe de<U+017F>ire it with
all my heart. Then <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome meanes whereby you may come to the
knowledge of it<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I have heard, that nothing is more requi<U+017F>ite unto Love, than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the thing loved; and how doe you thinke I <U+017F>hould love you, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I know you?
Hidden trea<U+017F>ures are not e<U+017F>timable; your actions, I make no que<U+017F>tion would render you of

                     <p>IGnorance has this quality, that it cau<U+017F>eth many things to be condemned, which in
them<U+017F>elves are laudable: And this I have often found to be true, <U+017F>ince I came among<U+017F>t
the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es about the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> where the fal<U+017F>e Tenents of <hi>Silvander</hi> are <U+017F>o
much followed, as all he <U+017F>ayes is Oracle, and it is held an offence again<U+017F>t the very Gods,
not to believe what ere he <U+017F>ayes. This is an error <U+017F>o rooted in the opinion of all that fect,
as it is, in matter of Love, a crime of the highe<U+017F>t nature, to contradict him. Yet I, who
am not <U+017F>wayed by opinion, but by truth; and who will not be convinced by words, but
by rea<U+017F>ons; I have ever followed that which rea<U+017F>on dictates unto me, and bids me doe.
Can any be <U+017F>o irrationall as to blame experience, which is the mother and the Nur<U+017F>e of
Prudence? yet talke to <hi>Silvander,</hi> or any of his hereticall <U+017F>ect, and they will maintaine
it even with their lives that all experience is vicious and fallacious; and that they mu<U+017F>t
cleave unto their own errors, like <U+017F>nailes which once <U+017F>ticking to a wall, mu<U+017F>t not part
from it: As if the Gods had not given us a judgement and rea<U+017F>on to di<U+017F>cern things that
are good, things that are better, and things that are mo<U+017F>t perfect.</p>
                     <p>The<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>iderations, I be<U+017F>eech you, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>et before your eyes, when you
<U+017F>ee that I have <U+017F>ometimes loved and changed; and yet do not feare I <U+017F>hall change you for
any other, becau<U+017F>e it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to find one that is better or more perfect; For when
I am come once to the highe<U+017F>t <U+017F>tep, I cannot go any higher. You are not the fir<U+017F>t, faire<U+017F>t
Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, that has de<U+017F>ired to under<U+017F>tand the <U+017F>equell of my <U+017F>trange fortune; many others
have had the <U+017F>ame curio<U+017F>try, and <U+017F>ome in this company. What I have formerly related
into them, I will not relate now, becau<U+017F>e they can inform you as well as I: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will onely tell you, that I am originally of <hi>Carmargues,</hi> where I began my Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>hip
with <hi>Carlis,</hi> and ended it with <hi>Stiliana.</hi> Afterwards, being but yet a novi<U+017F>t in
my trade, I quitted that place and came to <hi>Lions,</hi> after that I had by the way loved the
faire <hi>Aymea,</hi> the fool <hi>Ploriante,</hi> and the <U+017F>ad <hi>Cloris,.</hi> Then being come thither, I <U+017F>aw
<hi>Circena,</hi> whom, as my love unto her began in the Temple, <U+017F>o it dyed as <U+017F>oon as I was
out againe, and revived it <U+017F>elfe in the charitable <hi>Palinice;</hi> and from her was transferred
unto the kind <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> afterwards to the crafty <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and the proud <hi>Florice.</hi> And
becau<U+017F>e <hi>Florice</hi> is the la<U+017F>t I named, I will begin my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e where my love to her end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that you may the better under<U+017F>tand what you de<U+017F>ire to know concerning my
life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Periander,</hi> a very brave Cavalier, and one that was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love with <hi>Dorinde,</hi> to
plea<U+017F>e her, was a cau<U+017F>e of my declining <hi>Florice,</hi> by <U+017F>tealing from me (though my friend)
<U+017F>ome Letters which <U+017F>he had written unto me: And <hi>Dorinde</hi> to be revenged both of her
and me, <U+017F>hewed them (like a <U+017F>pitefull woman as <U+017F>he was) unto <hi>Theombres</hi> the husband
of <hi>Florice,</hi> who upon this, fell into <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of her, as he carried her out of the
the Town, <U+017F>o as in a little time I began to forget her: for Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, I mu<U+017F>t ingenuou<U+017F>ly
confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that as my love began fir<U+017F>t by my eyes, <U+017F>o it ended as <U+017F>oon as it wanted nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from my eyes, according to that true Maxime <hi>Out of <U+017F>ight, out of mind,</hi> and what
is far from the eye never troubles the heart. <hi>Florices</hi> <U+017F>tay out of Town a whole moneth
(a term long enough to kindle and extingui<U+017F>h a dozen <U+017F>everall loves in me) had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to quench all my flames to her. But her <U+017F>tay being to continue a longer time, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
with my <U+017F>elfe to take my leave of her: for I could never like tho<U+017F>e loves, that can
feed them<U+017F>elves with thoughts and fancies, and fond imaginations. But finding Love to
be a fire, and my <U+017F>elfe burned with it, I thought the be<U+017F>t Cure was by <U+017F>ympathy, and to
cure my <U+017F>elfe by another fire; and in order to this, I <U+017F>ought out for <U+017F>ome new beauty
which might cure my old burn; and at la<U+017F>t, heaven which alwayes favours de<U+017F>ignes that
are ju<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ent me <U+017F>uch a fire as I <U+017F>tood in need of.</p>
                     <p>One evening as I was walking without any other de<U+017F>ign, but taking the air by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Arar,</hi> clo<U+017F>e by a Bridge, and looking about, I e<U+017F>pied three Coaches drawn by <U+017F>ix Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
apeece: And becau<U+017F>e that was among<U+017F>t us an equipage unu<U+017F>ual, I drew neerer the bridge
to <U+017F>ee them pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. In one of them was four Ladies habited much different from our Mode,
and very rich; and their uncouth habits made me look upon them with more curio<U+017F>ity
and eagerne<U+017F><U+017F>e. The fir<U+017F>t whom fortune fixed my eye upon, did keep it upon her as long as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53527:68"/>
I could <U+017F>ee; She was in the fir<U+017F>t Coach, and <U+017F>eated in the be<U+017F>t place; her hair was faire,
<U+017F>omething inclinable to Che<U+017F>nut; her Complexion, no dye could make a mixture of <U+017F>uch
perfect vermilion upon <U+017F>now; her eyes black, but <U+017F>o quick, <U+017F>weet, and piercing, as no
heart had humour good enough to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t them; her lips exact Corrall, her N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ck a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
of pure<U+017F>t Alabla<U+017F>ter, and every part proportionable in perfection: as for her <U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I could not perfectly <U+017F>ee it, but as near as I could judge, it was neither tall nor lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
as for her Hand, which <U+017F>he often <U+017F>hewed in lifting up her haire which lay upon her
<U+017F>houlder in curles, it could not be equalled unto any thing <U+017F>o well as to the whitene<U+017F><U+017F>e of
her neck.</p>
                     <p>Judge, Madam, whether <U+017F>uch a beauty could be looked upon and not loved; <U+017F>he was
the fire by which I cured all my other burnings, <U+017F>o as quite forgetting <hi>Circinea, Palanice,
Dorinde,</hi> and <hi>Florice,</hi> I devoted my <U+017F>elfe wholly unto her. But perhaps you will thinke
it <U+017F>trange, that <U+017F>he being in a Coach, and onely pa<U+017F><U+017F>ant, I <U+017F>hould ob<U+017F>erve <U+017F>o many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
in this beauty; but you mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider, that I looked upon her with more eyes then
my own, and had tho<U+017F>e of love to help me in looking upon this wonder. Nor mu<U+017F>t
you believe any <U+017F>uch thing which <hi>Silvander</hi> is often alleadging, that Love is blind: but
on the contrary, that tho<U+017F>e who look with his eyes, can look through dre<U+017F><U+017F>es and <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch
beauties as are hid from others. But it <U+017F>eems that love had a de<U+017F>ign upon me at this time,
for he would not let me make u<U+017F>e of his eyes and my hands, but loadned the Coach hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
then it was before, becau<U+017F>e it carried my heart away with it.</p>
                     <p>I <U+017F>ee <hi>Silvander,</hi> you laugh; and I know you would <U+017F>ay that the Coach was not a jot
more loadned for having my heart in it; but know, that my heart as light as it is, yet is
as heavy as yours. I know not that, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> but I am <U+017F>ure the Coach which
carried your heart, had need go very fa<U+017F>t, or el<U+017F>e your heart would quickly be out, for it
cannot endure to be long in a place. This <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> was <hi>Perianders</hi> opinion, when he
found me looking upon the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers as they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed. This good friend of mine percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me halfe out of my <U+017F>elfe, did begin to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect the cau<U+017F>e; and coming unto me, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid he unto me; you will recover of this, I warrant you, as well as you
have done of others.</p>
                     <p>I an<U+017F>wered him with a love <U+017F>ick look; I <U+017F>ee <hi>Periander,</hi> you mock me; but did you
know how great my pain was, you would pitty me, though I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it proceeds
from love, Ah, ah, my friend, <U+017F>aid he and laughed, have a good heart; this is not the fir<U+017F>t
time you have been <U+017F>ick of the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e and never dyed. 'Tis true, <U+017F>aid I unto him,
then I did know who was the cau<U+017F>e, but now I am ignorant of it: How friend? <U+017F>aid <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
and laughed; What? in love, and knows not with whom? So it is, <U+017F>aid I unto
him, and I cannot help it, Love has catcht me. That you do love, <U+017F>aid he, I doe believe,
but that you <U+017F>hould love, and not know her whom you doe love, though I <U+017F>hould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you in any thing el<U+017F>e, yet in this I am incredulous: And if it be true, I <U+017F>ay it is a
thing as ea<U+017F>ily done, as to per<U+017F>wade any to believe it. Whether you believe it or no, <U+017F>aid
I, and <U+017F>ighed, yet I am <U+017F>ure it is <U+017F>o. How long, <U+017F>aid he, have you been <U+017F>ick of this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<U+017F>tical
di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e? A little longer, an<U+017F>wered I, then we have been talking of it. Upon this,
<hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ander</hi> laughed, and laying his hand upon my <U+017F>houlder, <U+017F>aid; Well friend, if you be
long <U+017F>ick of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, I will pay your Doctors: then he offered to go away, but I laid
hold upon his Cloak: What? <U+017F>aid I unto him, is this all the helpe and con<U+017F>olation I
mu<U+017F>t expect from your friend<U+017F>hip? What can I doe for you, an<U+017F>wered he, as long as you
doe not know her that is the cau<U+017F>e of your malady? You may help me, replyed I, and
contrive it how I <U+017F>hould come to the knowledge of her whom I adore. This is <U+017F>trange
folly, <U+017F>aid he, Can I know her better then you doe? Why not, replyed I; Is it not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
for people in health, to tell <U+017F>ick folks their di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and to give them <U+017F>uch remedies
as they them<U+017F>elves knew not? Ah, <hi>Periander,</hi> did you love me as well as you profe<U+017F><U+017F>e,
you would not deny me that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which friend<U+017F>hip requires. To which he an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
In the name of Heaven, <hi>Hylas,</hi> what would you have me to <U+017F>ay or doe? upon my
faith I think you are become a fool. A fool, <U+017F>aid I, is it folly to love her whom I adore?
<U+017F>he whom I am ready to die for, will not yeeld unto any Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e in beauty; <U+017F>he has
more Graces, then all the Graces them<U+017F>elves; and if Love were not hood-winckt, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F><U+017F>e
he would dote upon her: but the truth is, I know not who <U+017F>he is. This is fine folly
indeed, replyed he; where, and when did you <U+017F>ee her? Oh Heavens, <U+017F>aid I, are you
blind, that you could not <U+017F>ee the Sun when it <U+017F>hin'd? Did you not <U+017F>ee the Coaches which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53527:69"/>
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by? In the fir<U+017F>t of them was <U+017F>he whom I love, and know not, Is it <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid he unto
me, then friend know, that you are a Pri<U+017F>oner unto a Pri<U+017F>oner; <hi>Gondebunt</hi> our King
did take them beyond the Alpes, and hath <U+017F>ent them hither as Trophies of his
Victory.</p>
                     <p>Thus I under<U+017F>tood who this faire <U+017F>tranger was, and had it not been very late I had
endeavoured to have <U+017F>een her that night, but deferring untill the morning I retired to my
lodging <U+017F>o tormented that I could not re<U+017F>t all the night. As <U+017F>oone as day appeared, I left
my bed: And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Periander</hi> promi<U+017F>ed to accompany me to the Pallace, where we
might <U+017F>ee them as they went to the Temple, and <U+017F>taying in my Chamber till he came,
I took my Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, and trimmed my <U+017F>elfe up as gay as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could, and kept <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tirre
with curling my haire, and <U+017F>etting my <U+017F>elfe in a right quirpo, as none about me were able
to plea<U+017F>e me. Then taking the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>e into my hand and and finding my haire appeared
a little too much of the gilded hue, al<U+017F>o thinking that it would make but a bad impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion
in the fancy of women, I loaded my head with <U+017F>o much Cypre<U+017F><U+017F>e powder, as it looked
more like the head of a Miller than the head of <hi>Hylas:</hi> And <hi>Periander</hi> <U+017F>uprizing me,
looked on a long while before I perceived him; at the la<U+017F>t, turning about, and lifting
up my eyes, I <U+017F>aw him laughing. <hi>Periander,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him, you are no good friend of
mine, <U+017F>ince in lieu of help and pitty, you laugh at me. And <U+017F>o I may very well, <U+017F>aid he,
and I cannot beleeve your paine to be <U+017F>o great, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e Love in revenge of your folly, doe
make you find that in your <U+017F>elfe, which you would hardly beleeve in another. Wherein,
<U+017F>aid I, have I beene <U+017F>o incredulous? In that <U+017F>o great an affection cannot be
found, <U+017F>aid he, as will efface all other cares but <U+017F>uch as concerne, and depend
upon it.</p>
                     <p>You are in the right (<U+017F>aid I unto him) but did you ever <U+017F>ee me <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to plea<U+017F>e
any of tho<U+017F>e I loved? Nay, put all the Loves I ever had unto this time together, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
all equall the affection which I have unto this one, and therefore you need not think
it <U+017F>trange I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o carefull, and take more paines with my <U+017F>elfe for her, then for all
the re<U+017F>t: For I know very well that the fir<U+017F>t impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions which are made in the minds of
women, are not ea<U+017F>ily blotted out. Thus talking to him, and <U+017F>till tricking up my <U+017F>elfe
as fine as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Come, come, <U+017F>aid he, and make an end of all your finerye, for
otherwi<U+017F>e they will be gone before you come; then taking my hand, and pulling me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
by force from my gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, he con<U+017F>trained me to follow him unto the Pallace, where
tho<U+017F>e faire <U+017F>trangers were lodged, unto which we were no <U+017F>ooner come, but we <U+017F>aw them
going to the Temple, two and two together, holding hands.</p>
                     <p>I was <U+017F>o attentive in <U+017F>eeing them pa<U+017F><U+017F>e along, and ob<U+017F>erving which was <U+017F>he who had
thus wounded me, that <hi>Periander,</hi> by way of mockery whi<U+017F>pered me in the ear; take
heed, <U+017F>aid he, that <U+017F>he whom you admire <U+017F>o much, doe not pa<U+017F><U+017F>e by, and you not know
her; <U+017F>hould my eyes commit <U+017F>uch a fault, <U+017F>aid I, I would pull them out, and they <U+017F>hould
never deceive me againe. Well, well, <U+017F>aid he, I am much mi<U+017F>taken if <U+017F>he be not pa<U+017F>t alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, replyed I pre<U+017F>ently, doe you not mocke me? Upon this, not <U+017F>taying
for any an<U+017F>wer, I ran a little forward, that I might <U+017F>ee them pa<U+017F><U+017F>e againe; but then I
found <hi>Periander</hi> onely mocked me, for pre<U+017F>ently after, I <U+017F>aw her whom I expected, the la<U+017F>t

<U+017F>econd vi<U+017F>ion did <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>h me, that I knew not what I did, onely I remember that when

for mo<U+017F>t certainly to undervalue a womas beauty is a wound almo<U+017F>t incurable. And on

they were there before I imagined it halfe way, and I thought the Sacrifice <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort, as it
was ended before I thought it begun, and this becau<U+017F>e I received <U+017F>uch extreame content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in looking upon this fair <U+017F>tranger, and my eye was never off as long as the Sacrifice
la<U+017F>ted. The<U+017F>e Ladies al<U+017F>o were as full of curio<U+017F>ity as we, and were not <U+017F>o fervent in their
devotions, but they would <U+017F>ometimes looke round about the Temple, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<U+017F>o much contentment unto my <U+017F>elfe, as I thought all the paines I tooke that day very well

Aunt unto <hi>Periander,</hi> a few dayes after the arrivall of the<U+017F>e faire <U+017F>trangers, did
enquire of tho<U+017F>e who had the guard of them whether it would be permitted to vi<U+017F>it them,
and under<U+017F>tanding that the King was very well plea<U+017F>ed to allow it, <U+017F>he went unto them,
and offered unto them all manner of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance and <U+017F>ervice; <U+017F>he had a daughter called <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inda,</hi>
who was not unhan<U+017F>ome: This daughter was at the fir<U+017F>t vi<U+017F>it <U+017F>o much plea<U+017F>ed with
the<U+017F>e Ladies, and <U+017F>o was <hi>Ama<U+017F>onte,</hi> that they went very often afterwards to <U+017F>ee them.
By fortune the greate<U+017F>t intimacy they had, was with that Fair one who had <U+017F>o captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me. And it was, as I beleeve, be<U+017F>ides tho<U+017F>e perfections which <U+017F>he had above the re<U+017F>t of
her companions, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke the <hi>Gaul</hi> language, and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he had been brought
up in tho<U+017F>e Countries, <hi>Periander</hi> acquainting me with the<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, I told him, that
he mu<U+017F>t needs contrive it <U+017F>o by any means, that this good Aunt of his did might us admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
without acquainting her with any de<U+017F>ign.</p>

<U+017F>eemed to be inqui<U+017F>itive in hearing her to tell of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers, and enquired very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
how they behaved them<U+017F>elves, and whether they were civill and affable, to
whom <hi>Ama<U+017F>onte</hi> and <hi>Or<U+017F>inda,</hi> both giving very high and advantageous Characters of
them, he feigned an extream de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>eeing and talking with them. If you will, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Or<U+017F>inda,</hi> you may go with my Mother and me, <U+017F>o <U+017F>atisfie your curio<U+017F>ity. 'Tis
true, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ama<U+017F>onte,</hi> if men may be permitted to vi<U+017F>it them, and of that I have not
enquired: but to morrow I promi<U+017F>e you to ask the que<U+017F>tion, whether any men have yet
or may be admitted, and if any have been allowed, you <U+017F>hall I warrant you, as <U+017F>oon as
any. And indeed; the good Aunt was as good as her word; for the next morning <U+017F>he
under<U+017F>tood that any might come and vi<U+017F>it them; for the King did not feare any could
<U+017F>teal them away, having them <U+017F>o farre from home.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Periander</hi> brought me this newes, it was not unwelcome unto me, as you may
well imagine, e<U+017F>pecially when I heard, that the next day in the afternoon, they would
conduct us thither. The day <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o long to my impatience, as I asked what a clock
it was, above a hundred times, thinking the Sun a <U+017F>luggard and <U+017F>lower then u<U+017F>ual: I was
no le<U+017F><U+017F>e unquiet all the night, nor had any more patience all the morning, untill

my time, as when they came to the Gate I met them, and <U+017F>eeming as if the
meeting was meerly accidentall; I asked <hi>Periander</hi> whither he was going? He an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he was to wait upon his Mother (for <U+017F>o he called <hi>Ama<U+017F>onte</hi>) then <U+017F>he addre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed

<U+017F>hould thus at the fir<U+017F>t make this remon<U+017F>trance unto her; but you mu<U+017F>t know, that my
humour was not to langui<U+017F>h it out in amorous Trances, nor to let my eyes be Orators as
long as my tongue could tell her my heart. For I ever thought that delayes doe rather
marre then make it better, and that in love, not to vanqui<U+017F>h quickly, is to be vanqui<U+017F>hed;
but the principal motive why I would no longer deferre the declaration of my affection
unto this faire <U+017F>tranger, was a double con<U+017F>ideration, which at that time I had in my
mind: I con<U+017F>idered that <U+017F>he was in the power of another, and not as others are under a
Mother or Parents: but a Pri<U+017F>oner of War, and kept by command from <hi>Gondebert,</hi> as
the re<U+017F>t of her companions were. And becau<U+017F>e it was hard to know what de<U+017F>igne he had
upon her, I feared le<U+017F>t this opportunity <U+017F>hould be taken from me, either by being guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more <U+017F>trictly, or removed unto <U+017F>ome other place. I con<U+017F>idered al<U+017F>o, that <U+017F>he came from
beyond the Alpes, where the women are much bolder to attempt what they de<U+017F>ire, and
execute what they attempt, then our women of <hi>Gaul</hi> are: I <U+017F>ound this to be their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
by my conver<U+017F>e in <hi>Camargue,</hi> and in the Town of <hi>Arles,</hi> which made me think that
this faire one would not derogate from her Climate, nor thinke this <U+017F>uddain declaration
<U+017F>trange.</p>
                     <p>Following therefore the genius of her Country and my own, I did acquaint her with
my affection. And though perhaps my words were not at the fir<U+017F>t taken as proceeding
from love, but civility; yet however, they did break the Ice, and facilitate the way to my
en<U+017F>uing addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and made her believe that which I did de<U+017F>ire to per<U+017F>wade her of: I had
an opinion that <U+017F>he had no thoughts which tended unto what I de<U+017F>ired; and yet <U+017F>he took
more plea<U+017F>ure in talking with me, then with <hi>Periander,</hi> or any that came to vi<U+017F>it her;
<U+017F>he thinking that this affection which tyed me unto her, did oblige her to tru<U+017F>t more in
me. And though I had no other knowledge of her good will then this, yet I can truly
<U+017F>ay, that there were very few things which <U+017F>he did not communicate unto me, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<U+017F>o private or important; and within a moneth after the fir<U+017F>t time I had <U+017F>een her, there
was <U+017F>o great familiarity betwixt us, as <U+017F>he adverti<U+017F>ed me, how <U+017F>he and her companions
intended to walk in the <hi>Athenian</hi> I<U+017F>le at the evening, in a Garden which was where the
<hi>Ro<U+017F>ne</hi> and <hi>Arar</hi> met, a place very plea<U+017F>ant, both in variety of Wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, and Groves of
Trees. I re<U+017F>olved not to mi<U+017F>s this appointment, as well becau<U+017F>e I had no other exerci<U+017F>e
nor de<U+017F>ign, as becau<U+017F>e I thought <U+017F>he would be much offended if being <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
of it, I <U+017F>hould let <U+017F>lip that opportunity which <U+017F>he gave me. When <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw me fir<U+017F>t,
<U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed unto her Companions, as if the meeting were by chance and not de<U+017F>igne.
What fortune brought you hither, <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto me, where my companions and
my <U+017F>elfe did think to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away the re<U+017F>t of the day un<U+017F>een by any? This di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation of
the matter, did plea<U+017F>e me very well. For it is a good <U+017F>igne of love, to hide from others
the addre<U+017F><U+017F>e which is made unto any Lady. And to <U+017F>econd her in her artifice, I an<U+017F>wered
very faintly. It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Madam, but that the fortune which brought me hither
<U+017F>hould be good, <U+017F>ince I am <U+017F>o happy in meeting <U+017F>uch company; and it would be much
better, if I knew any way how to doe you any acceptable <U+017F>ervice.</p>
                     <p>Tho<U+017F>e who began to under<U+017F>tand a little of our language did thanke me in mo<U+017F>t pittifull

broken words, yet as kindly as they could, and went away into <U+017F>everall walkes, leaving
us two together as we de<U+017F>ired to be. I tooke her therefore under the Arm, and began to
walke, but lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould thinke <U+017F>o much familiarity <U+017F>trange, I <U+017F>aid unto her, though
this Madam be not the cu<U+017F>tome and fa<U+017F>hion of your Country, yet it is in <hi>Gaule,</hi> and
therefore I be<U+017F>eech you take it not ill, if I u<U+017F>e our owne priviledges, and by taking your

unto more familiarity than this: Tis true, that the condition wherein I am will not let
me acknowledge it more than in words, <U+017F>o as I cannot require your amity as I ought to
doe; upon this I ob<U+017F>erved her to <U+017F>igh and change colour, as if the thought of her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did exceedingly trouble her: And being very de<U+017F>irous to know the particular cau<U+017F>e
of her <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e, after many thankes for her kind expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, I be<U+017F>eeched her to let me

and humours of tho<U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e favour we de<U+017F>ire, I was the more urgent with her: For I

which are in it, and for which the Inhabitants of the place have beene forced to revolt <U+017F>o
often. I have made this de<U+017F>cription of my Country unto you, that you may the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand
what was foretold my Father when I was borne, by a female Druide, who came
out of <hi>Gaw</hi> into this Country, by the command (as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid) of a great God, who<U+017F>e name
was unknown unto us, and I think it was by him whom you did <U+017F>wear. Is it <hi>Tautates;</hi>
<U+017F>aid I unto her? The <U+017F>ame, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he whom this woman <U+017F>aid was a great God, and all
others depended upon him, Now this female Fortune teller came to my Fathers hou<U+017F>e,
at the <U+017F>ame time when my Mother was delivered of me: And my Father <U+017F>eeing her look
very earne<U+017F>tly upon me, he asked her what my fortune would be: It will be, an<U+017F>wered
<U+017F>he, like unto the Country where <U+017F>he is borne. This an<U+017F>wer was very darke: But
<U+017F>ome yeares after <U+017F>he chanced to come againe unto the <U+017F>ame place, and my Mother being
very inqui<U+017F>itive did pre<U+017F><U+017F>e her to explaine her former prediction. To whom <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered,
that this woman <U+017F>hall have the <U+017F>ame fortune which the Country wherein <U+017F>he was borne
hath; the <hi>Romans</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of the Gold found there have <U+017F>o harra<U+017F><U+017F>ed the people by wars,
as it is almo<U+017F>t depopulated, <U+017F>o as her abundance is the cau<U+017F>e of her poverty; even <U+017F>o <U+017F>hall
this your daughter be very much troubled by rea<U+017F>on of her beauty and merit. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
this Druid was very knowing; for I have found ever <U+017F>ince, that never was
woman more cro<U+017F><U+017F>ed by fortune than my <U+017F>elfe, as you may judge by the en<U+017F>uing di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>I was born, as I told you, among<U+017F>t the <hi>Salla<U+017F>es,</hi> in a Town called <hi>Eporides,</hi> <U+017F>eated between
two great Hils, where the golden <hi>Baltea</hi> runs: my Father was called <hi>Leander,</hi> and my
mother <hi>Luira,</hi> and though my owne prai<U+017F>es be not han<U+017F>ome out of my owne mouth, yet
that you may the better under<U+017F>tand the <U+017F>equell of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, you mu<U+017F>t know, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53527:71"/>
there was none in all the Country, who did not yeild unto my Father, in grandure, in
antiquity of Family, in offices which he po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed, or in authority which he had gotten,
as well by his owne merit, as by the favour of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and <U+017F>ince of <hi>Vaelentinian,</hi> and all
tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ince him ruled over <hi>Italy,</hi> who advanced him unto that height, that if his
death had not prevented it, when the Empire was in decline, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e he had not only
made him<U+017F>elfe Soveraigne Lord over the <hi>Salla<U+017F>es,</hi> but al<U+017F>o of the <hi>Libices,</hi> of the <hi>Centrons</hi>
and of the <hi>Veragrois.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This his death was the fir<U+017F>t blow which I received from Fortune &amp; did not re<U+017F>ent it, for
want of capacity: For, being but nine yeares of age, I knew not what it was to lo<U+017F>e a
Father, and to be at the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of a mother who was more carefull of her <U+017F>elfe than
her Children, yet I lived very contentedly till I came to be fourteen of fifteen years old, for
till then. Fortune did not thinke me able to feele the weight of her blows; and <U+017F>ee how
<U+017F>ubtilly <U+017F>he undermined me: for <U+017F>he gilded over her bitter pils of poy<U+017F>on with a glo<U+017F><U+017F>e of
good, knowing very well (cruell one as <U+017F>he is) that any mi<U+017F>ery that comes under the
<U+017F>hrowd of a happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, makes it <U+017F>elfe much more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly re<U+017F>ented.</p>
                     <p>In the <U+017F>ame Towne where I was, did dwell very many Cavaliers: for that <hi>Gaul,</hi> which

                           </gap>pine</hi> is not as it is here, for I have heard, that here Cavaliers and men of
quality doe live in the Country. Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, there was one young <hi>Libicinian</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
who certainly was as much favoured by Nature in all the graces <U+017F>he could be<U+017F>tow, as
was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible; nor did he want any noblene<U+017F><U+017F>e of Ance<U+017F>tors, nor alliance to the be<U+017F>t Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
nor any other good quality that could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be de<U+017F>ired, but only Riches; and in
that, he was little beholding to his Father, who was all his life more thir<U+017F>ty after the
acqui<U+017F>ition of Honour than Wealth, little con<U+017F>idering that the one without the other is
like a bird that has good wings, yet has <U+017F>uch a clog at her foot that <U+017F>he cannot fly. This
young man did dwell in <hi>Eporides</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of the hatred which <hi>Rhithimer</hi> bore unto his
Father. I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, <hi>Hylas,</hi> you have heard, how this <hi>Rhithimer</hi> though a <hi>Goth</hi> by Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet through his valour and good conduct was made a Citizen of <hi>Rome;</hi> afterward,
Patrician, and la<U+017F>tly Governour of <hi>Gaul Ci<U+017F>alpine,</hi> or indeed, rather the Lord of it; for
his Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion was <U+017F>o large, and his authority <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olute, that he might be called Lord
as well as Governour. The Father of <hi>Arimant</hi> (for <U+017F>o was the young man called) had
mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion to feare his Enemy; For though otherwayes he was very well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>hed,
yet he had ever in him the Nature of a <hi>Goth:</hi> And this was the rea<U+017F>on why he
came into this Towne that he might <U+017F>o much the <U+017F>ooner goe out of <hi>Italy,</hi> in ca<U+017F>e
he was forced to it, either by the <hi>Centrons,</hi> by the <hi>Veragrois,</hi> or by the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This young Cavalier of whom I <U+017F>peake did accidentally <U+017F>ee me at a marriage which
was kept in the hou<U+017F>e of one of my Cozens. The cu<U+017F>tom of the Country is, that upon <U+017F>uch
occa<U+017F>ion, entrance is permitted unto all as freely as into Churches. I <U+017F>ay that as ill
lucke was, he <U+017F>aw me there: For there he fell in love with me, and this love was the
<U+017F>cource both of all his mi<U+017F>eries and mine. He tooke occa<U+017F>ion to declare his love unto me
in a Ball, wherein many u<U+017F>e to dance at once by two and two, walking only round the
roome, and ob<U+017F>erving the cadency a little. The name of it was the great Ball, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
purpo<U+017F>ely to give a han<U+017F>ome opportunity unto Cavaliers of talking unto Ladies.
<hi>Arimant</hi> tooke me out, and though it was with a de<U+017F>igne of di<U+017F>covering his affection,
yet was it long before he dur<U+017F>t begin; yet at la<U+017F>t, lea<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch an opportunity

to overcome one per<U+017F>on twice; it was enough your eyes had already got the victory

                     <p>I knew not all this while, who this young Cavalier was, having never <U+017F>een him before:
yet <U+017F>ince he was <U+017F>o confident as to addre<U+017F><U+017F>e him<U+017F>elfe unto me, I did imagine him a man
of principall Rank among<U+017F>t the <hi>Salla<U+017F>es;</hi> his han<U+017F>ome pre<U+017F>ence, and the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
his affection, made me very de<U+017F>irous to know his name: And I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I had been
put hard to it for an an<U+017F>wer, if the Ball had continued longer. But it being ended, I had
opportunity to enquire of what I de<U+017F>ired. He who began to be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of loves fir<U+017F>t blows,
which commonly are full of impatience, and who thought that perhaps it would be long
before he had <U+017F>uch another opportunity, he took me out to dance againe although it
was not the cu<U+017F>tome; but being grown more bold, and a better husband of his time, he
<U+017F>aid thus unto me; I have been a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that faire ones will never believe things that
are true, and rather hearken unto things things that are not <U+017F>o. Though I <U+017F>hould leave it
unto fair ones, to give you an an<U+017F>wer (<U+017F>aid I) yet <U+017F>ince they doe not hear, I will aske
you, why you accu<U+017F>e them of that fault? Becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered he, I find it <U+017F>o in you. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

then I doe prote<U+017F>t that I am not a man. What are you then, replyed I pre<U+017F>ently? I am,
<U+017F>aid he, your <U+017F>ervant, and the mo<U+017F>t faithfull and zealous <U+017F>ervant that ever was. I mu<U+017F>t

give him another kind of an<U+017F>wer then I did, but for <U+017F>ome other con<U+017F>iderations which
hindred me, and therefore I onely <U+017F>aid thus unto him; we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee <hi>Arimant,</hi> whether
you continue in the <U+017F>ame mind the next time we meet, and I will deferre my an<U+017F>wer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
then.</p>
                     <p>The Ball now ended and the company parted, for it was <U+017F>upper time, and doe what
he could, I would not give him any opportunity of <U+017F>peaking unto me againe, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that for the fir<U+017F>t time he might be very well contented with <U+017F>uch an<U+017F>wers as he had
received. And becau<U+017F>e the joy for this marriage continued many dayes, the next day,
and as oft as the meetings continued, he did not omit any opportunity of te<U+017F>tifying the
truth of his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions: which at the la<U+017F>t, I was per<U+017F>waded to believe, and to <U+017F>atisfie him
<U+017F>o farre, as to let him thinke I loved him. 'Tis true, I <U+017F>tayed until the very la<U+017F>t day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I did <U+017F>o declare my <U+017F>elf unto him, le<U+017F>t if I had done it <U+017F>ooner, he <U+017F>hould pretend to any
greater favour, and had I tarried any longer, I could not have told him <U+017F>o much; but I
would not upon any terms, let him go without <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of my good will.</p>
                     <p>Since this time, it was long before we <U+017F>aw each other, except in Temples and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
places, which I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e did trouble me, becau<U+017F>e indeed, I did begin to love him,
con<U+017F>idering his di<U+017F>cretion in the carriage of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>o as none could <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne.
He would come often in the night to my window, and pre<U+017F>ent me with <U+017F>ome Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades:
but that was all the vi<U+017F>its I had from him.</p>
                     <p>My di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, kind <hi>Hylas,</hi> would be too long and tedious, if I <U+017F>hould relate all the
particulars of this Court<U+017F>hip. Let it <U+017F>uffice, that <hi>Arimant</hi> could not with di<U+017F>cretion te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tifie
the good that he wi<U+017F>hed unto me, although he <U+017F>ought out all wayes, and neglected
no opportunity of doing it. Oh <hi>Hylas,</hi> how full of <U+017F>ubtilty Love is? and though they
paint him but a boy, yet what old tricks he has? They are very ignorant who know it
not, or who think to ma<U+017F>ter him. I know, and I know it by experience, and to my grief,
that they who would overcome him, mu<U+017F>t fight as tho<U+017F>e doe who get their victory by
flying, for otherwi<U+017F>e if they come to handy-blowes, he will get the better, it is ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibly to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t him: for he has <U+017F>o many tricks, and can u<U+017F>e <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everall <U+017F>orts
of Arms, as with one or other doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e if he doe not wound, yet at lea<U+017F>t he will foile
and make <U+017F>cratches, and his weapons are al<U+017F>o impoy<U+017F>oned, that as <U+017F>oon as ever they draw
blood, there is no hope of health for him that is <U+017F>o wounded, for his wounds will <U+017F>o itch,
as he him<U+017F>elfe will <U+017F>cratch them and make them <U+017F>ore. Oh that I had known this before?
For, <hi>Hylas,</hi> at the fir<U+017F>t I did not admit of this addre<U+017F><U+017F>e, but onely to <U+017F>ee <hi>Arimant</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>h

before my face, as a te<U+017F>timony of my beauty: Afterwards, his ob<U+017F>equiou<U+017F>he<U+017F><U+017F>e and
kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e, moved me to look upon him a little better, and then his Noble Extraction,
his Merits, his Genero<U+017F>ity, and his Di<U+017F>cretion, made me thinke very well of him, and a
little after, to e<U+017F>teem him <U+017F>o, as I <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>orry to lo<U+017F>e him And love was no <U+017F>ooner po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or
of heart, but pre<U+017F>ently I was con<U+017F>trained to render it unto him, <U+017F>ince time did put
me out of all doubt of his loving me. But I be<U+017F>eech your con<U+017F>ider how <U+017F>uddenly my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
changed, when love had gotten this victory over me: As long as I did not love him,
I cared not at all who knew of his affection to me: but on the contrary, was very glad
it <U+017F>hould be divulged, as thinking that the more pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately he loved me, and the more it
was known, the more was the honour of my beauty. But then, as <U+017F>oon as I began to love
him, I cannot expre<U+017F><U+017F>e how I was offended at the lea<U+017F>t knowledge of it, in <U+017F>o much as
every time I talked of him, my principal charge was to be <U+017F>ilent and <U+017F>ecret, and carry all
clo<U+017F>e. Our affaires then <U+017F>tanding upon the<U+017F>e terms, and our affections growing every day
to a higher <U+017F>traine, our onely endeavours were for han<U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ions to te<U+017F>tifie them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
each other. But <U+017F>uch was the con<U+017F>traint in which the women beyond the mountaines
lived, being kept as it were Pri<U+017F>oners, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for us to <U+017F>ee one another, unle<U+017F>s
by chance, nor to <U+017F>peak together but in the pre<U+017F>ence of <U+017F>ome, and that too, very <U+017F>eldome.
This made him think upon an old woman, who got her living by going unto hou<U+017F>es and
<U+017F>elling Laces and Ribbands; that by her meanes we might <U+017F>peak unto each other by
Paper, though not by voyce. He ea<U+017F>ily gained the woman, what by promi<U+017F>es, and what
by Gifts. And <U+017F>he coming to the hou<U+017F>e where I was, <U+017F>eeming to take mea<U+017F>ure of me for a
piece of Lace to a Gorget, and to that end drawing me to the window, <U+017F>he would have
thru<U+017F>t a Letter into my hand, <U+017F>aying not a word but onely <hi>Arimant.</hi> I knew well enough
it was a Letter from him, but being unwilling to be obliged unto the di<U+017F>cretion or fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of this woman whom I knew not; and knowing well enough, that <U+017F>uch kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being in<U+017F>inuators into the <U+017F>ecrets of <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>o fond as to tru<U+017F>t them, would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
prove very Tyrants, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ell their <U+017F>ilence at <U+017F>o dear a rate, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to content them; I would not receive it, but on the contrary rejected it with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>harpe
language, yet low, that the poor woman was quite out of countenance, and carried it
back unto him that gave it her, intreating him to imploy her nomore in any <U+017F>uch matters.
He who thought it would have been very welcome to me, and hoped for <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>urance
of my good will in the an<U+017F>wer to it; <U+017F>eeing this refu<U+017F>all, and hearing what <U+017F>harpe words
I u<U+017F>ed, he was the mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed man in the world; and not knowing unto whom to
complaine, he came that very night into our <U+017F>treet with a con<U+017F>ort of Mu<U+017F>ick, after they
had played a le<U+017F><U+017F>on or two, and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing I was come unto the window, he came ju<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

receive his Letters.</p>
                     <p>I ea<U+017F>ily apprehended the rea<U+017F>on of his complaint; and becau<U+017F>e my refu<U+017F>al did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

this <U+017F>ecret affection long, without a third per<U+017F>on, becau<U+017F>e as I told you before, the
con<U+017F>traint of women was <U+017F>o great as we knew not which way to meet: Therefore I
thought it a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to tru<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elfe unto <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>creet per<U+017F>on, who might both comfort
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53527:73"/>
and coun<U+017F>ell me. In order unto this, I ca<U+017F>t my eye upon all that were in the hou<U+017F>e where
I lived, and found none more fit than my Nur<U+017F>es daughter, who was brought up with me
and loved me <U+017F>o very well, as <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf happy in any <U+017F>ervice <U+017F>he could do me. This
wench was of my owne age, and <U+017F>uch a one, as I <U+017F>tood in need of; for <U+017F>he had more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

<U+017F>he had wit at will, and was full of <U+017F>uch petty contrivances as I <U+017F>tood in need of. As
for her fidelity and di<U+017F>cretion, I was <U+017F>o confident of them, as I dur<U+017F>t tru<U+017F>t her as <U+017F>oon as

<U+017F>elfe, in throwing the Letter <U+017F>o out of the Window; <U+017F>he found out an invention to write
with le<U+017F><U+017F>e danger, and it was this. The evening before I intended he <U+017F>hould receive my
Letter from me it was agreed betwixt us, that I <U+017F>hould hang out a Hankercher out of
my window as if it were to dry, and by which we under<U+017F>tood, that the next morning
at the time when others went unto the Temple, he was to go al<U+017F>o; and where we <U+017F>aw
the greate<U+017F>t throng of people there we would be, to prevent <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition. If I could let a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Book fall, in which I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem to be at devotion, and none <U+017F>ee, then I <U+017F>hould doe
it: otherwi<U+017F>e when I went away, I <U+017F>hould pretend that I had carele<U+017F>ly left it behind me
in the place where I kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eled, or to let it fall <U+017F>ome way or other when he <U+017F>aw me; and he
who had his eye <U+017F>till upon me and who at that time was to be as near me as he could,
he <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ently reach it up: if none <U+017F>aw, then he was to look into it; but if any did
perceive it, then he was to give me another which re<U+017F>embled mine, and which was
made purpo<U+017F>ely alike. Now in the<U+017F>e Books we writ our Letters, but with <U+017F>uch devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as were not ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>covered: my Mother and my Nur<U+017F>e, have had the<U+017F>e Bookes in
their hands <U+017F>everal times, but could not make any thing of them, becau<U+017F>e they under<U+017F>tood
not the Charracters. Since this way was agreed upon, not a day pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, but we writ unto
each other, which was no <U+017F>mall comfort unto us in the con<U+017F>traint wherein we lived. But
Love was in this re<U+017F>emblant unto Fire, which the more you feed it, the more it augments;
<U+017F>o did my favours unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> for they did <U+017F>o inflame his de<U+017F>ires, as not contented with
what I had done, he importun'd me by a thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>upplications, to admit him into my
Chamber, unto which at la<U+017F>t I con<U+017F>ented, <U+017F>o the meanes could be contrived, and <U+017F>o he
would promi<U+017F>e to require no more of me, then I was willing to permit. This permi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion

The fir<U+017F>t was, how to enter, but that was ea<U+017F>ily contrived; for by a Ladder made of
a Rope, which he would give unto <hi>Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Chamber when the ca<U+017F>ement was open. But my Nor<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e bed was clo<U+017F>e to mine,
and who was not of our con<U+017F>piracy, was a much greater difficulty unto us, and yet he
found out a remedy for that. There was in <hi>Epocedes,</hi> a very famous Mountebanke, who
had many mo<U+017F>t excellent receipts. This man was <U+017F>o much obliged unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> that
he was infinitely de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>erve him. Love advi<U+017F>eth this young man to make addre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
unto him, and to ask him for a Receipt which would cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>leep; he who made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ecrets, did give him an ointment, which being put under the
No<U+017F>e of the party that was faln a<U+017F>leep, would <U+017F>o <U+017F>tupifie the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, as no noi<U+017F>e what<U+017F>oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
would awake the party until it was taken away. Before <hi>Arimant</hi> would make
u<U+017F>e of it upon this occa<U+017F>ion, he tryed the operation of it upon one of his Dome<U+017F>tiques,
who <U+017F>lept <U+017F>o foundly, that no <U+017F>houting at his eare could awake him; but he removed
him from place to place, and he never <U+017F>tirred, until taking away the Box, and throwing
a little water in his face, and then he awaked.</p>
                     <p>All things being thus prepared, execution onely wanted. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, my heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
now to faile me; and when I con<U+017F>idered the danger into which I <U+017F>hould put my <U+017F>elfe,
I wi<U+017F>hed that a <U+017F>top might be in the proceedings: But <hi>Clarina</hi> who was more couragious
then I, told me that I was gone too farr to retreat now; that had I put the Cavalier
out of hope at the fir<U+017F>t, he would not have been offended; but now as things <U+017F>tood, it
was a manife<U+017F>t wrong unto him and knew how to argue the matter <U+017F>o well, and to <U+017F>hew
the ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of it, as at la<U+017F>t I re<U+017F>olved to goe through. Bed time being come, we all reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

and <U+017F>eemed to take our re<U+017F>t: and my good Nur<U+017F>e who never dreamed of our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e,

good old woman was <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, that if the hou<U+017F>e had falne, <U+017F>he could not heare it. <hi>Clarina</hi>
joyed at this good beginning, did ri<U+017F>e from her <U+017F>leeping Mother, and helped me with my

                        <hi>Clarina</hi> <U+017F>aid unto her, you are a fool, for if the victory were not already gotten, we

be not on both <U+017F>ides. I am more afraid, <U+017F>aid I, that the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e will be on both <U+017F>ides.
Nay, nay, replyed <U+017F>he, never think <U+017F>o, heaven loves you better then to u<U+017F>e you <U+017F>o hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but pray tell me, <U+017F>ince the victory will fall on your <U+017F>ide, what Ran<U+017F>ome mu<U+017F>t the
Conquered pay into you? His heart, <U+017F>aid I unto her. His heart? an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he: but if
he part with his heart, what <U+017F>hall he have for him<U+017F>elfe? and how can he afterwards love
you? In lieu of that I take from him, <U+017F>aid I unto her I will give him mine. Yours? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled? if he have your heart, he will be the verie<U+017F>t cowardly Cavalier that
ever lived. Come come, <U+017F>aid I unto her, you are a <U+017F>cold, and <U+017F>tand and <U+017F>pend the
time in tattling whil<U+017F>t he <U+017F>tayes. Upon this, we went to the window, and no <U+017F>ooner
looked out, but I <U+017F>aw <hi>Arimant</hi> at a corner of a <U+017F>treet over again<U+017F>t us. He had his eye <U+017F>o
continually up in the window, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to look one and he not <U+017F>ee us; and
therefore the Ca<U+017F>ement was no <U+017F>ooner open, but he was under the window, expecting when
the Ladder would be thrown out. I began to tremble <U+017F>o, both for contentment and fear,
as I was con<U+017F>trained to fit down upon my bed, leaving <hi>Clarina</hi> to all the paines, who
with abundance of confidence, fa<U+017F>tned the Cord, and threw out the Ladder, by which
<hi>Arimant</hi> <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly mounted, that he was in my Chamber before I thought his foot
upon the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tep. As <U+017F>oon as he was entred, he fell down upon his knees before me,
whom he found in <U+017F>uch a maze, as I could not <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>peak unto him. <hi>Clarina</hi> pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Ladder, <U+017F>hut the window, and then came to <U+017F>ee what we did; but finding the
Cavalier <U+017F>till upon his knees, and I <U+017F>peaking not a word to him, nor he to me; I to <U+017F>ee a
man in my Chamber at <U+017F>uch an hour, and he with an exta<U+017F>ie of contentment to have this
a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of my affection, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto me; Methinks, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e (for <U+017F>o <U+017F>he called me)
you are not very civil towards this Cavalier, in letting him be <U+017F>o long in this unea<U+017F>ie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture:
for God <U+017F>ake, <U+017F>aid the Cavalier, let me alone where I am, for I am where I mo<U+017F>t
earn <U+017F>tly de<U+017F>ire to be, and think my <U+017F>elfe beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, happy in it. Then recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
my <U+017F>elfe, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid I unto him, that <hi>Clarina</hi> is in the right, and
if my a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment doe not plead my excu<U+017F>e, you may very well tax me with incivility,
and indi<U+017F>cretion. Upon this I <U+017F>tood up, and taking him by one arm, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Clarina</hi> took
him by the other, we forced him to <U+017F>it in a Chaire which was by my beds <U+017F>ide. Then
<hi>Clarina</hi> taking <hi>Arimant</hi> by the hand, Sweare Cavalier (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e

to performe all I have <U+017F>aid, but al<U+017F>o not to faile in my very thoughts; I call God, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
Earth, and all the world, to witne<U+017F><U+017F>e my Oath, and pray them all to inflict their

                     <p>The<U+017F>e Oathes and imprecations, <hi>Arimant,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him, are needle<U+017F><U+017F>e, your owne

to the end that their power and their goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e may be <U+017F>een and acknowledged.
So you, Madam, re<U+017F>embling them both in beauty and in virtue, you have done me a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
which does not onely infinitely tran<U+017F>cend my merits, but al<U+017F>o all the hopes that ever
I could imagine. Since it is <U+017F>o, and fince I mu<U+017F>t needs acknowledge it <U+017F>o; what <U+017F>hould I

doe, not to acquit my <U+017F>elfe, for I cannot pretend unto it, knowing it to be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible; but
onely to avoid the brand of ingratitude? I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, the more I think upon it, the
more I am confounded and a<U+017F>hamed, that my fortune <U+017F>hould he to receive <U+017F>uch high be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
and have <U+017F>o little under<U+017F>tanding as not to know, how I <U+017F>hould be thankful as I
ought<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I have no other way to come out of this Labyrinth, but this only refuge, which is
to referre my <U+017F>elfe wholly unto your will; that as at my reque<U+017F>t you were plea<U+017F>ed to doe
me this favours <U+017F>o<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that I may by your commandment do what I ought, to acknowledge
it. After this expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he was <U+017F>ilent, in expectation of my an<U+017F>wer, which was this:
<hi>Arimant,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him, that you <U+017F>hould acknowledge that what I have done for you,
to be <U+017F>omething that is great and extraordinary, is as full <U+017F>atisfaction as I can de<U+017F>ire; but
I cannot endure you <U+017F>hould e<U+017F>teem your <U+017F>elfe at <U+017F>o low a value, as to thinke that you doe
not de<U+017F>erve this favour; for in <U+017F>o doing, you doe not onely offend again<U+017F>t truth, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
that judgement which I had of you, when I thought you worthy of my amity.
Doe not thinke, <hi>Arimant,</hi> that I have done any thing at random, or without <U+017F>ound de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.
When I fir<U+017F>t gave entertainment to your good will, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it was
without any de<U+017F>ign, and onely becau<U+017F>e your addre<U+017F><U+017F>e did invite me to it: But when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>towed
my good will upon you, doe not thinke unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you have an ill opinion of me,
that I did it without long and <U+017F>erious debate in my <U+017F>elfe: whether I ought to doe it or
no, and whether I <U+017F>hould be blamed for <U+017F>uch a choice. I con<U+017F>idered your family, becau<U+017F>e
I would not di<U+017F>parage my own Ance<U+017F>tors; and I found it <U+017F>o full of noblene<U+017F><U+017F>e, as I could
not chu<U+017F>e but be contented with it, I looked upon the per<U+017F>on, and I could take no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
again<U+017F>t it, either in your body or mind: I have ob<U+017F>erved your behaviour, and
I could not find any thing which was not noble, and to be e<U+017F>teented, all your actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full of honour and virtue. Briefly, I have ca<U+017F>t my eyes upon your affection, and I
find that you doe really love me. Now, <hi>Arimant,</hi> can you think that he who is owner
of the<U+017F>e qualities, does not de<U+017F>erve any favour from the per<U+017F>on whom he loves? Madam,
an<U+017F>wered he, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed my hand, this favour which you are plea<U+017F>ed to doe me now, is
greater (if it can be) then the fir<U+017F>t; and I <U+017F>ee you will put me out of all hopes of ever
being able to pay <U+017F>o great a debt. I received all tho<U+017F>e applaudes which you are plea<U+017F>ed to
be<U+017F>tow upon me, not than I am <U+017F>o vaine as to think them my due, but becau<U+017F>e I de<U+017F>ire you
<U+017F>hould think them <U+017F>o, that they may <U+017F>o much the more oblige you to continue unto me
the honour of your favours<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 
                        <hi>Arimant,</hi> replyed I, you know very well, and I al<U+017F>o, that
what I <U+017F>ay of you is true; and this may be a great te<U+017F>timony of your merit, that <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi>
loves you; for you mu<U+017F>t either think her without wit or knowledge, or el<U+017F>e think your

you, whether the report be true that you are to marry? and whether, as I am told, you
intend it? At this que<U+017F>tion <hi>Arimant</hi> blu<U+017F>ht, and though I <U+017F>poke it ignorantly, yet <U+017F>o it
was, that his Father had made <U+017F>uch a motion to him not long before, and therefore he
an<U+017F>wered me, 'Tis true indeed, Madam, <U+017F>uch a thing is talked of, but my Father <U+017F>hall

where I have vowed to <U+017F>tay eternally, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you accompli<U+017F>h my reque<U+017F>t? Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t,
replyed I pre<U+017F>ently, is unju<U+017F>t, and your vow invalid <U+017F>ince your fir<U+017F>t which you made
at your entrance is contrary to it. Why <U+017F>aid he unto me? You promi<U+017F>ed, an<U+017F>wered I, and
bound it with an Oath, that you would move me unto nothing but what I was willing
unto; and <U+017F>ince I am not willing you <U+017F>hould make this reque<U+017F>t, you are obliged to pre<U+017F>s it no
further, and what vowes <U+017F>oever you have made <U+017F>ince, which are contrary unto that fir<U+017F>t,
is of no force nor cannot bind. It is mo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, <U+017F>aid he, (and then ro<U+017F>e up) to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t
either your beauty, or your will: And I know, I <U+017F>hould receive but too great a load of
happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, if this were added to the number of the re<U+017F>t. <hi>Arimant,</hi> <U+017F>aid I then unto him,
doe but <U+017F>till pre<U+017F>erve your affection unto me, and I will freely promi<U+017F>e, that if I can make
tho<U+017F>e who have the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of me con<U+017F>ent unto it, I will marry you, and give my <U+017F>elf
entirely unto you. It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould expre<U+017F><U+017F>e how this young man was joyed when
he heard this; and I was as glad as he, though he made greater <U+017F>hew by words, and all
the thanks that could be invented. But yet, this was the cau<U+017F>e of our ruine, for calling
<hi>Clarina</hi> to witne<U+017F><U+017F>e what I promi<U+017F>ed, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>he coming ha<U+017F>tily towards us, did draw
the Box from the no<U+017F>e of her Mother, and <U+017F>o unluckily, as it fell off the bed, was broke,
and the liquid ointment ran about the floor.</p>
                     <p>It was a thing very <U+017F>trange, for almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oon as ever the Box was from under the no<U+017F>e
of my Nur<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he awoke, but her head <U+017F>o dizzy with the <U+017F>mell, that <U+017F>he knew not what
<U+017F>he did, and was like one that was drunk. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Arimant</hi> heard the Box fall upon
the floor, he doubted it, and <U+017F>aid unto me ha<U+017F>tily, ri<U+017F>e Madam, and <U+017F>tand before the old
woman, whil<U+017F>t I get out at the window, for certainly <U+017F>he is awake. Upon this, I ran to
the bed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he to the window, and <hi>Clarina</hi> to the Ladder; and I coming to her, I laid me
down upon her bed, began to embrace her, laid my hand upon her brea<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>eeming as
if I thought her to be very fick; I bad her take good heart, told her, <U+017F>he would be well
againe pre<U+017F>ently; called for <hi>Clarina,</hi> and <U+017F>ent her for <U+017F>ome Vineger or water to throw in
her face, and make her come to her <U+017F>elfe againe: I did <U+017F>o deceive her by my talke,
and by rubbing one while her Pul<U+017F>e, and another her No<U+017F>e, as I gave <hi>Arimant</hi> time to be
gone, and <hi>Clarina</hi> to hide the Ladder: Then <U+017F>eeming to be very bu<U+017F>ie about her, we
threw water into her face, and did <U+017F>o da<U+017F>h her, as <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>oundly a<U+017F>leep, had <U+017F>he
not awaked with it. Then in a great a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, a<U+017F><U+017F>uming her <U+017F>pirits: Oh my God,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, where have I been? how <U+017F>trangely have I been taken, what in the name of God
is the cau<U+017F>e of it? Oh my good Children, I thank God and you, for bringing me to my <U+017F>elf
again, for but for you I had dyed. Oh Mother, <U+017F>aid <hi>Clarina,</hi> you have been in a <U+017F>woone
above two hours, we have held you in our Arms, and done all we could to revive you,
and I believe if you had not vomited, you had dyed. And good Children, <U+017F>aid the good
old woman, what did you doe to waken me? Why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Clarina,</hi> as I was lying by you,
I heard you keep a great <U+017F>tirring and a rattling in your throat as if you were choaked;
upon which, I called upon you two or three times, and <U+017F>eeing you did not an<U+017F>wer, I lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of bed and waked <hi>Cry<U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ide;</hi> then taking the Candle, we came both to help you, and
thanks be to God you came to your <U+017F>elfe againe. And did I vomit, <U+017F>aid the old woman?
Vomit? <U+017F>aid <hi>Clarina,</hi> Yes certainly, and happy you did, for if you had not, I believe you
had dyed, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>uch black and filthy <U+017F>tuffe did lie upon your <U+017F>tomack. Oh God, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
and held her No<U+017F>e, doe you not <U+017F>well it? This <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, becau<U+017F>e of the ointment which
was <U+017F>pilt upon the floor, and <U+017F>melt very ill: Yes, yes, (<U+017F>aid my Nur<U+017F>e) I doe <U+017F>mell it;
Good <hi>Clarina,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, take the be<U+017F>ome and make it cleane, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould doe you hurt,
<hi>Clarina,</hi> who de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>uch a command, did fetch <U+017F>ome water, and wa<U+017F>hed the place as
clean as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and afterwards threw it out of the window. But the accident of the
next morning, may move one to laugh a little; for this ointment falling in the <U+017F>treet,
and a Dogge pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by and <U+017F>melling at the oyle, he licked it, and there lay as if dead.
<hi>Clarina,</hi> who <U+017F>aw this out of the window, and doubted the cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he threw a little
water upon him, then the Dog ro<U+017F>e up, <U+017F>hook his eares, and went away. The evening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Arimant,</hi> according to his cu<U+017F>tome, came with Mu<U+017F>ick under the window, and after
they had played a while, he <U+017F>ung <U+017F>ome Ver<U+017F>es which intimated, that he would mo<U+017F>t invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53527:75"/>
keep his promi<U+017F>e. And while we lived in this manner, both our affections encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
to <U+017F>uch a height, as I cannot tell which was the more loved. But now fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to mix many bitters among<U+017F>t our <U+017F>weets, or rather to ravi<U+017F>h from us all our <U+017F>weets,
and leave us none but bitters. Alas, alas, well may I phra<U+017F>e them <hi>Bitters:</hi> for <U+017F>ince this
time, I cannot <U+017F>ay I enjoyed any delight or contentment. <hi>Rithimer</hi> of whom I have already
<U+017F>poke, a great Captain and a Favorite of the Emperour <hi>Majoranus</hi> had obtained, not
onely to be a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> but al<U+017F>o to be a Senator and Governour of <hi>Gaul Ci<U+017F>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,</hi>
and he attained unto <U+017F>uch high e<U+017F>teem, as he di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed ab<U+017F>olutely of all that was in
<hi>Gaul.</hi> This large Authority did not proceed onely from good will and favour of the
Emperours, but much from the great exploits which he had done again<U+017F>t the <hi>Vandals,</hi> for
the pre<U+017F>ervation of <hi>Italy.</hi> This valiant Prince, married one that was of kin to my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and de<U+017F>iring to <U+017F>ee me well matched, did ca<U+017F>t his eye upon a young man, a little
of kin unto <hi>Rithimer,</hi> very rich, but of a mo<U+017F>t vicious <U+017F>pirit, and the mo<U+017F>t ugly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
body that was in all <hi>Gaul Ci<U+017F>alpine.</hi> My Mother who de<U+017F>ired to be rid of me,
becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought me to be a rub in her way of marriage, <U+017F>he took occa<U+017F>ion by the
foretop, and re<U+017F>olved to carry me unto this Prince<U+017F>s, hoping at the lea<U+017F>t to leave me with
her as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired.</p>
                     <p>This being re<U+017F>olved upon, and unknown to me, it was almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oon executed without
my knowledge. For beginning to ob<U+017F>erve how I did much favour the addre<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi>
<U+017F>he thought to prevent me, which doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not have done, had his
e<U+017F>tate been equall to his merit and noblene<U+017F><U+017F>e. But <U+017F>ince it was not, <U+017F>he thought that <U+017F>end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me away, was the be<U+017F>t remedy <U+017F>he could u<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t it. Yet <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o bufie in <U+017F>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

did imagine that <U+017F>ome voyage was intended. And becau<U+017F>e I could not depart without
adverti<U+017F>ing <hi>Arimant,</hi> I commanded <hi>Clarina</hi> to let him know it, and give unto him the
Book which was accu<U+017F>tomed to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e betwixt us, and in it was this Letter.</p>

                     <p>I received this Letter, as we were taking Coach to begin our journey; <U+017F>o as I could not
read it, becau<U+017F>e I had not time to look it out, it being mingled among<U+017F>t many others in
the Book, which was no <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure unto me. <hi>Arimant</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I was to depart that day, met us upon the way, as if accidentally with two Cavaliers
his friends, whom he had not acquainted with his affection unto me; and who yet were
not altogether ignorant of it; and who upon this occa<U+017F>ion, being very familiar with my
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53527:75"/>
Mother; as <U+017F>oon as they met the Coach, they <U+017F>aluted us, and enquired of her voyage.
She who now did not care who knew it, did freely tell them, and began to talk of <hi>Rithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
Grandure<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> of the power her Cou<U+017F>en had with him, and of the hopes <U+017F>he had of
doing great matters for me. In the meane time, <hi>Arimant</hi> had got him<U+017F>elfe on my <U+017F>ide,
but in <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ad and afflicted po<U+017F>ture, as he moved me to pitty him: and was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
out of him<U+017F>elfe, as he began to rove, and talke very idlely; and yet to augment
our mi<U+017F>ery, for feare of making known the good corre<U+017F>pondency betwixt us; he dur<U+017F>t
not addre<U+017F><U+017F>e his <U+017F>peech unto me, though his eyes were never off me; tho<U+017F>e who heard him,
and did not know the cau<U+017F>e which thus di<U+017F>tracted his mind, they began to laugh at his
ridiculous language.</p>
                     <p>I who confidered that <U+017F>ometimes to be over <U+017F>ubtle <U+017F>poiles all, I thought it expedient
to <U+017F>peake unto him as a per<U+017F>on indifferent; and therefore I asked him, from whence this
great <U+017F>orrow proceeded, which cau<U+017F>ed every one to take notice of it? I doe a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you,
<U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>ighed, it proceeds from nothing but envy. I did not thinke, an<U+017F>wered I
that a per<U+017F>on of your merit could envy any one; but of whom and why are you envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
I envy your Coach (<U+017F>aid he unto me) that is going towards the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>bices,</hi> and becau<U+017F>e
I may not go with you, although it be my Country. Why, replyed I, are you <U+017F>uch a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of your Country, as you <U+017F>hould envy things that are in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible? What <U+017F>hould I doe,
<U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>uch in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibles are more happy than I am? Heaven, I hope, <U+017F>aid I, is better
unto you than <U+017F>o. This is the con<U+017F>olation, an<U+017F>wered he, which is given unto tho<U+017F>e who
are mi<U+017F>erable, yet I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you any better <U+017F>hall never be de<U+017F>ired by me, but rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Tho<U+017F>e who are <U+017F>icke, <U+017F>aid I, doe the like, they thinke all medicines bitter, and <U+017F>uch
Phy<U+017F>icke is commonly given unto them, as is contrary to their de<U+017F>ires, though conducing
to their health. Great is the difference, <U+017F>aid he, betwixt the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the body, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>es
of the mind: For tho<U+017F>e of the body are cured by contraries, but tho<U+017F>e of the
mind, by the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of that thing which cau<U+017F>es the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. If ambition wound us
is there any better cure than to arrive at the thing a<U+017F>pired unto? If beauty offend us,
will any thing <U+017F>o quickly ture, as the injoyment of that beauty? And therefore they
<U+017F>ay, that de<U+017F>ires <U+017F>atisfied doe coole at the very fir<U+017F>t, afterwards are quite glutted; <U+017F>o as
to the maladies of the mind mu<U+017F>t be applyed <U+017F>uch remedies as have the qualitie of the
Scorpion, which can cure the wound it makes. It is long <U+017F>ince you were in your owne
Country, <U+017F>aid <hi>Clarina;</hi> and what makes you thinke upon it <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>hly now? Your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>ighed, brings it fre<U+017F>h into my memory.</p>
                     <p>Tho<U+017F>e who heard our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e did not under<U+017F>tand it, though if my Mother had not
been diverted by the que<U+017F>tions of tho<U+017F>e two Cavaliers, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>he would have <U+017F>melt out
<U+017F>omething, but <U+017F>he <U+017F>eeing us thus talking, <U+017F>he would not <U+017F>uffer them to goe any farther
with us, although they told her their way did lye that way, but <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o urgent with
them, that they were con<U+017F>trained to leave us. Now did I find, that to part from a per<U+017F>on
loved might well be called a death, both by my owne re<U+017F>entments, and by <hi>Arimants,</hi>
for he looked as pale as death it <U+017F>elfe, and was <U+017F>o out of him<U+017F>elfe, that he could not bid

                     <p>We under<U+017F>tood by the returne of the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, that the <U+017F>ame day he came, <hi>Arimant</hi>
was at the height of his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and that the Phy<U+017F>itians had good hopes of his recovery;
and al<U+017F>o that the next day he was out of all danger. For my part, I flattered my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o
far as to beleeve, that the contentment which he found in my Letter was the cau<U+017F>e of it;
but whether that was true or no, I know not, but it is certaine, that he perfectly recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which was <U+017F>o great a joy unto me, that I al<U+017F>o began to mend of my malady, as if there
was <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ympathy in our Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, both falling <U+017F>icke, and both recovering at one
time.</p>
                     <p>When I came to the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> and his wife <U+017F>aw me <U+017F>o much out of temper,
what through my long journey, and what through my <U+017F>orrows to be <U+017F>o far from him I
loved, <U+017F>he thought it be<U+017F>t to recover me before I was expo<U+017F>ed to the view, and not to
<U+017F>peake of the marriage which <U+017F>he intended till then, thinking that it was beauty which
would bring on <hi>Cloringus</hi> (for <U+017F>o he was called whom <U+017F>he aimed for my Husband). My mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cheered me up as much as <U+017F>he could, and told me that within few dayes I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
and to my mi<U+017F>ery it hapned <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid: For I was told that <hi>Arimant</hi> would
come and <U+017F>ee me, either in di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, or <U+017F>ome other way, in which he <U+017F>hould not be known.
This hope gave me health, and my face became as it was wont to be, <U+017F>o as I began to <U+017F>hew
my <U+017F>elfe; and indeed many began to ca<U+017F>t amorous eyes upon me, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Rithimer,</hi> as
<U+017F>ince I under<U+017F>tood, his wife at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>olicited the match, propounded unto <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimer,</hi>
and de<U+017F>ired him, that in re<U+017F>pect I was her Kin<U+017F>woman he would be a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a <U+017F>elfe de<U+017F>igne upon me, and knowing <hi>Clorangus</hi> to be a man of that deformity, he
did approve of it, thinking that the le<U+017F><U+017F>e I loved my husband, the more it would make for
him<U+017F>elfe; <U+017F>o as faigning all that he did was at his wifes in<U+017F>tance and de<U+017F>ire, he <U+017F>ent for
<hi>Clorangus,</hi> propounded it unto him, advi<U+017F>ed him to imbrace it, and at the <U+017F>ame time
got his con<U+017F>ent. I know not whether that which they call beauty in me, or my misfortune
was the cau<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>o it was, that the match was concluded upon, before a <U+017F>yllable was
<U+017F>poke of it unto me. Ob<U+017F>erve how Heaven does mocke at all humane intentions; when I
fancied unto my <U+017F>elfe the fulle<U+017F>t contentment, even then was I overwhelmed with the
greate<U+017F>t misfortune that could befall me.</p>
                     <p>My mother came one night into my Chamber when I was undre<U+017F>t and ready to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<hi>Clorangus,</hi> and told me, that <hi>Rithimer</hi> and his wife had made up the match, that
within two dayes the marriage was to be <U+017F>olemnized, and that <U+017F>he thought good to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
me with it, to the end that when <hi>Rithimer</hi> did me the honour to <U+017F>peake unto me
of it, I <U+017F>hould be prepared to <U+017F>et a good face upon it, and to thanke him, as the paines he
had taken in my behalfe de<U+017F>erved; that though <hi>Clorangus</hi> was a little defective in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet he had many other qualities which <U+017F>upplyed tho<U+017F>e defects, and rendred him ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
and e<U+017F>timable; that he was in love with me, and <U+017F>o deeply, that if I would but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him a little, I might make him doe what I would.</p>
                     <p>To be <U+017F>hort, <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>he neglected no argument which might induce me to this marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
and not <U+017F>taying for my an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>he went pre<U+017F>ently to bed, thinking that I would
not reli<U+017F>h it at the fir<U+017F>t, but hoping al<U+017F>o that my Pillow-cogitations would make me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve
according to her de<U+017F>ires.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heavens, <hi>Hylas,</hi> in what a <U+017F>trange dumpe was I <U+017F>truck when I heard this, and yet
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53527:76"/>
it was <U+017F>ome comfort that my Mother was gone, for I could cry with more liberty; I
threw my <U+017F>elfe upon my bed, and lea<U+017F>t my complaints <U+017F>hould be heard I <U+017F>topped my mouth
with the <U+017F>heet, but all would not hinder <hi>Clarina</hi> from hearing me, who being adverti<U+017F>ed
of it, came unto me, and would have given me <U+017F>ome good coun<U+017F>ell; but turning towards
her, I <U+017F>aid; Away, away, <hi>Clarina,</hi> I am tormented enough without any addition from
you; let me weepe away that little time I have to live, and lament that misfortune, which
cannot be lamented enough; <U+017F>he who did mo<U+017F>t tenderly love me, and knew well enough
what it was I thus grieved at: I come not, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, with any intentions of comforting
you, but onely to helpe you into bed to the end none may mole<U+017F>t you. I had rather, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
I<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that you would helpe me to my grave: Upon that I <U+017F>uffered her to undre<U+017F><U+017F>e me,
and lay as <U+017F>till as if I had been dead: For <U+017F>o deepe were my re<U+017F>entments that I could not
cry; but when I was in bed, and the Light taken away, then teares began to flow in <U+017F>uch
abundance downe my cheekes and bre<U+017F>t, that my bed was all water: Sometimes my
thoughts were all upon <hi>Arimant,</hi> his merits, and all tho<U+017F>e te<U+017F>timonies of his affection to
me; otherwhile I reflected upon <hi>Clorangus</hi> and his crabbed deformities, and finding <U+017F>uch
a va<U+017F>t difference between them, I was in <U+017F>uch an extream Labyrinth of griefe, that truly
the Gods were mercifull unto me, that I did not fall into a mo<U+017F>t violent de<U+017F>paire; all
Night long I did nothing but lament, and Day found me in bed without ever clo<U+017F>ing an
eye; and <U+017F>ee what a violent affection may <U+017F>ometimes doe. I was fully re<U+017F>olved to dye,
knowing that my Mother would not be <U+017F>tirred at any prayers, <U+017F>o as <U+017F>till thinking upon
<hi>Arimant,</hi> and his affection to me, I thought it better to dye once, than be dying every
hour as long as I lived.</p>
                     <p>The next morning when I <U+017F>aw <hi>Clarina</hi> and mo<U+017F>t of the hou<U+017F>e were gone to the Temple
according to cu<U+017F>tome leaving none to looke unto me but a young Boy, who <U+017F>erved me,
I de<U+017F>ired him to goe pre<U+017F>ently and fetch a Chyrurgion, without telling any one. When
he came, Sir, <U+017F>aid, I am much troubled with a paine in my head; and I de<U+017F>ire you to
let me blood in my left arme, for I have u<U+017F>ed to doe <U+017F>o when the paine tooke me, finding
alwayes pre<U+017F>ent ea<U+017F>e by it. He <U+017F>eeing me looke red, and my eyes heavy, verily beleeved
me, <U+017F>o as he bound my arme, opened my veine, and went away; he was no <U+017F>ooner out
of the hou<U+017F>e, but I called the little Officer, and de<U+017F>ired him to fetch another, for this la<U+017F>t
had done me no good; the Boy made ha<U+017F>te, and brought another, I told him the <U+017F>ame
tale I told before; I opened my other arme, keeping the other clo<U+017F>e, he did as I de<U+017F>ired,
and went away.</p>
                     <p>Thinking that this was enough to end my mi<U+017F>erable dayes, I cau<U+017F>ed the Curtaines to
to be drawne, and the windowes <U+017F>hut, as if the light offended me; then thinking how <U+017F>ad
the Newes of my death would be unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> but withall thinking it would be a
great comfort unto him to hear I dyed loving him, I tooke my Hankercher and <U+017F>preading
it upon the bed, I dipt my finger in my blood, and writ in it the<U+017F>e words, <hi>Arimant I dye
thine,</hi> which was all I was able to doe, for pre<U+017F>ently my eyes began to faile me, and my
heart fainted, <U+017F>o as I lo<U+017F>t my knowledge, yet I doe remember, that my la<U+017F>t thought being
of <hi>Arimant,</hi> I <U+017F>aid aloud, <hi>Now Fortune the Victory is mine:</hi> After this, I remained
as dead, and certainly had been <U+017F>o if <hi>Clarina</hi> had not come into the Chamber, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that all my griefe proceeded from my lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Arimant,</hi> <U+017F>he came to bring me a Letter
from him, brought by him who u<U+017F>ed to bring them before; but when <U+017F>he drew the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and found me <U+017F>wimming in blood: Oh God (cryed <U+017F>he out <U+017F>o loud as was heard
into my Mothers Chamber) Oh God, <U+017F>he is dead, <hi>Chry<U+017F>eide</hi> is dead, and wringing her
hands together, <U+017F>he ran out of the room all in tears, not knowing what <U+017F>he did. The
windowes were immediately opened, and every one ran unto me; they <U+017F>aw I was all in
blood, but not imagining it came from my arme, they were long in <U+017F>earching for the
wound. <hi>Clarina</hi> in the mean time laying her hand upon my Hankercher, and opening it
<U+017F>he <U+017F>aw what I had writ with my finger; and though it was <U+017F>o ill written as <U+017F>he could
hardly read it, yet <U+017F>he put it in her pocket lea<U+017F>t any el<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee it, and running out of
the Chamber to my Mother told her of the accident: By fortune, as <U+017F>he went, <U+017F>he met
him that brought the Letter from <hi>Arimant,</hi> who asked her for an an<U+017F>wer, becau<U+017F>e his
Ma<U+017F>ter had commanded him to returne as <U+017F>oon as he could, to whom <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered all in
tears, it is a <U+017F>ad an<U+017F>wer which you mu<U+017F>t carry to your Ma<U+017F>ter at this time, <hi>Chry<U+017F>eide</hi> is
dead, becau<U+017F>e they would have forced her to marry <hi>Clorangus.</hi> Carry him this Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
there will he find writ with the hand and blood of <hi>Chry<U+017F>eide</hi> the cau<U+017F>e of her death:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53527:77"/>
Upon this, <U+017F>he went all teares to tell my Mother, who was then with the wife of <hi>Rithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi>
when they heard this <U+017F>aid newes, they were extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed. But the Prince,
like one that was tran<U+017F>ported, ran pre<U+017F>ently to the place where I was, and <U+017F>eeing me <U+017F>o
in blood, by chance he took me by the arme to lift me up, and finding my <U+017F>leeve full of
blood <U+017F>he has cut her veines (<U+017F>aid he); and then turning up the <U+017F>leeve of my <U+017F>mock,
he found that the bloud did not run, becau<U+017F>e my <U+017F>leeve <U+017F>tuck to the wound (and I believe
that <U+017F>aved my life) for as <U+017F>oon us it was pulled away, he <U+017F>aw it began to bleed afre<U+017F>h;
he put his finger upon it, and bad <hi>Clarina</hi> doe the like to the other arm, for he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
the other <U+017F>leeve bloody al<U+017F>o; then cau<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ome cold water to be brought; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
(<U+017F>aid he) <U+017F>he is not yet dead, for I find <U+017F>he is hot: Then throwing <U+017F>ome of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

like, my Pul<U+017F>e began to returne, and I began to breathe. Then <U+017F>ending in all po<U+017F>t ha<U+017F>te
for Phy<U+017F>itians, and they coming before it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ight, I returned to my <U+017F>elfe againe, and
recover'd my knowledge. <hi>Rithimer</hi> never <U+017F>tirring from me all the while, till he <U+017F>aw me
out of all danger: Afterwards he told me, that he never <U+017F>aw me <U+017F>o faire as then; for the
lo<U+017F>s of blood making me look pale and white, and that whitene<U+017F>s being as it were paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with blood, one <U+017F>eemed to adde beauty to the other. Moreover, his pitty of me did
augment his love, and his love was covered under the vail of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
                     <p>But when I was a little better <U+017F>ettled, his wife and my Mother, asked me, what, and
who it was that had brought me into that condition? but I knowing that they were
the cau<U+017F>es of all my mi<U+017F>ery, to avoid their importunity, <U+017F>eemed not to heare them, and
would not <U+017F>peak. And one of the Phy<U+017F>itians told them, that it was better not to trouble
me, for <U+017F>peaking might doe me harme; but it was requi<U+017F>ite I <U+017F>hould take <U+017F>omething, and
be left unto my re<U+017F>t, which accordingly they did; and in the meane time <hi>Rithimer</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of the boy who waited upon me, whether he perceived what I did unto my <U+017F>elfe.
The boy fearing a beating if he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, an<U+017F>wered; No, and that onely I commanded
him to <U+017F>hut the windows, and draw the Curtaines. This cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Rithimer</hi> to call for <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina:</hi>
Doe not leave <hi>Cry<U+017F>edd,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) for if you doe, <U+017F>he will make her <U+017F>elfe bleed

did the like. There, Sir, I <U+017F>aw her; Oh di<U+017F>mall <U+017F>ight! I <U+017F>aw her dead on her bed, and it
<U+017F>o full of blood, that it ran downe upon the ground. At this time <hi>Rithimer</hi> and many
women entred; and I heard <hi>Rithimer</hi> cry out and <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he had cut her veines. I was
then afraid lea<U+017F>t any <U+017F>hould know me, and becau<U+017F>e you had expre<U+017F>ly forbidden that, and
thinking I could hear no more, I came pre<U+017F>ently out of the Towne, and made all ha<U+017F>te
that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could, becau<U+017F>e you had <U+017F>o commanded, though with much <U+017F>orrow to be
the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ad Newes. Alas, alas, (cryed he) I <U+017F>ee it is but too true that <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eide</hi>
is dead, <U+017F>ince you have <U+017F>een her <U+017F>o with your owne eyes; could the Gods ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
unto <U+017F>uch a cruelty, and can I heare this Newes and <U+017F>till live? He would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
on, when his Father hearing of his being ill, and who loved him mo<U+017F>t tenderly,
being his onely Son, came and knocked at the Chamber door. The young man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his voice, he adverti<U+017F>ed <hi>Arimant,</hi> who <U+017F>etting as good a face upon it as he could,
bad him open the door. The windows were yet <U+017F>hat, and the curtaines drawne, <U+017F>o as when
his father came into the Chamber, he could not well <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e in <hi>Arimants</hi> face;
but coming to him, and taking his hand, he asked him how he did? Well Sir, an<U+017F>wered
he, but only for a little faintne<U+017F><U+017F>e which proceeds from repletion of humours, for want of
exerci<U+017F>e, but if you thinke it good, I de<U+017F>ire to ride abroad and take <U+017F>ome journey, as
well to di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate tho<U+017F>e humours, as for change of Aire. I like it very well, <U+017F>aid the Father;
but whither would you goe? My greate<U+017F>t fancy, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Arimant,</hi> is to the <hi>Libicens,</hi>
as well becau<U+017F>e it is the place of my birth, and naturall aire, as to <U+017F>ee my kindred and
friends. I <U+017F>hould like it very well, <U+017F>aid the Father but that I feare the hatred of <hi>Rithimer.</hi>
Sir, replied <hi>Arimant,</hi> never fear it; I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that for you to goe would be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
but not for me, for there will not any advantage acrue unto <hi>Rithim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were dead; be<U+017F>ides, being there among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many kindred and friends, he could not have
any intention again<U+017F>t me, but it would be told me and ea<U+017F>ily prevented. The Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
what he <U+017F>aid, was ea<U+017F>ily brought to his opinion, which was not a little happine<U+017F><U+017F>e
unto us all, e<U+017F>pecially unto <hi>Arimant:</hi> For having before re<U+017F>olved to kill him<U+017F>elfe, he now
deferred the execution of what he intended unto the end of this voyage. He accoutred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe
therefore as well as he could, and the next morning <U+017F>et forward, taking none with
him but this man, and another to walte upon him in his Chamber, telling his Father it
was more <U+017F>afe to goe with a <U+017F>mall Traine, than if better attended, becau<U+017F>e le<U+017F><U+017F>e notice
would be taken of him. His de<U+017F>igne of going to the <hi>Libicens,</hi> was to meet with <hi>Clorangus,</hi>
and when he had di<U+017F>patched him, then to go unto the place where I was interred, there to
<U+017F>acrifice him<U+017F>elfe unto my a<U+017F>hes. And truly it was happy that this revenge was thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
for it retarded his intention of killing him<U+017F>elfe, and the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger whom I <U+017F>ent
had more lea<U+017F>ure to carry him our Letters.</p>
                     <p>The <U+017F>ame day he departed from his Father, halfe of it was gone before <hi>Arimant</hi> thought
either upon eating or re<U+017F>ting him<U+017F>elfe; and the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger whom I <U+017F>ent met him at a pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
over a River which is called <hi>Te<U+017F>in,</hi> and not knowing him, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed on, as well becau<U+017F>e
he did not thinke of finding him in any place but <hi>Eporedes,</hi> as becau<U+017F>e his grief had much
changed his face, and was but <U+017F>lenderly attended, <U+017F>o as he never <U+017F>o much as dreamed of
<hi>Arimant.</hi> And <hi>Arimant</hi> he rid on <U+017F>o pen<U+017F>ive, and his eyes <U+017F>o fixed to the ground, as he
did not <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>ee him when he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by: But as good lucke was, the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger who
came unto me from him, was not heedle<U+017F><U+017F>e, for he <U+017F>eeing the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger who came from
me, acquainted his Ma<U+017F>ter, telling him that if he would he might heare all the <U+017F>tory of
<hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> for yonder was the man who once brought Letters from her. What can I hear,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Arimant,</hi> more than I have? Is it not too much that I have heard <U+017F>he is dead?
<U+017F>o never <U+017F>o much as turning his eye towards him, he rid on; but the young man being
de<U+017F>irous to know how I was interred, and all other pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, he went unto the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger
whom I had <U+017F>ent, and taking acquaintance, asked him of <hi>Clarina,</hi> and how <U+017F>he took the
death of <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide? Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, why, <U+017F>he is alive, and thanks be to God very well.

what would you have with me? Sir, <U+017F>aid the young man, Good newes, <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> is not

Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger from her; upon this, <hi>Arimant</hi> lifted up his eyes and hands to heaven. Oh ye
good Gods, continued he, be ye for ever ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed, for this favour you have done me. Sir
<U+017F>aid my Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, <hi>Clarina</hi> commanded me to give you this Letter; <hi>Arimant</hi> was <U+017F>o
much out of him<U+017F>elfe, as he took it with a trembling hand, and knew not what he did.
But at la<U+017F>t, recollecting him<U+017F>elfe, he asked him how I did. Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <U+017F>he is very well,
and in good health, <hi>Clarina</hi> commanded me to tell you as much. They told me, replyed
<hi>Arimant,</hi> that <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> was dead: upon this, opening <hi>Clarina's</hi> Letter, though he
would have di<U+017F><U+017F>embled it, yet his countenance betrayed his joyes, e<U+017F>pecially when he <U+017F>aw
my Po<U+017F>t<U+017F>cript, without which, he <U+017F>hould have thought that <hi>Clarina</hi> deluded him; but
<U+017F>eeing my hand, and knowing it, he a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him<U+017F>elfe I was alive, although he imagined
I was very weake. But tell me, my friend, <U+017F>aid he, Was it true that <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> was in <U+017F>uch

then <U+017F>he was; for it night well be <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he was dead, and afterwards returned to life:
Then he related unto him how I had been, how I was, and what they had done unto me.
I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Arimant</hi> then) that <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> tran<U+017F>cends all Ladies in
beauty, and all Cavaliers in grandure of courage: but fearing le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay too
much, he held his peace, and riding on repa<U+017F>te I him<U+017F>elfe at the next Town, where he did
nothing but repeat unto him<U+017F>elfe all that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed.</p>

the day; all the night took up his thoughts in contriving meanes how to <U+017F>ee me. And not
being able to re<U+017F>olve upon it alone, he called for the young man whom he was wont to
<U+017F>end unto me, and who be<U+017F>ides his love to his Ma<U+017F>ter, wanted neither wit nor judgement.
Unto him he did communicate his de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>eeing me, and that he <U+017F>hould never enjoy
him<U+017F>elfe till then: And yet he told him, that <hi>Rithimer</hi> did <U+017F>o extreamly hare his Father,
as he could not with any <U+017F>afety come where I was, much le<U+017F><U+017F>e into my Chamber. The
young man after he had a little con<U+017F>idered upon it: Sir, <U+017F>aid he, you mu<U+017F>t make a Virtue of
Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity: fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>end away this Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, that he may not di<U+017F>cover your de<U+017F>ignes: Next,

remaine there a while unknown; and being there <U+017F>uch opportunities may happily

                     <p>
                        <hi>Arimant</hi> liking the opinion of the man, as <U+017F>oon as it was day, he di<U+017F>patched my Me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>enger
away, who the next day brought me Letters from him, told us where he met him,
and by what chance he knew him; I will not now, <hi>Hylas,</hi> tell you what his an<U+017F>wer was,
but you may imagine it full of thankes and extream contenment; and in the conclu<U+017F>ion
of it, a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me, that he would <U+017F>ee me ere long what fortune <U+017F>oever he ran; in the interim,
he lo<U+017F>t no time. For thinking it no di<U+017F>cretion to come into the place where I was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

ha<U+017F>te; and going into a wood, they <U+017F>hifted them<U+017F>elves, and put their owne clothes in a
Portmantle. Thus clad, and di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed as well as they could, they came into the Towne
where I was, and lodged in an Inne near the Gate. As for <hi>Arimant,</hi> he kept his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

and he whom he imployed unto my lodging, told him that he had <U+017F>een <hi>Clarina,</hi> and <U+017F>poke

came into <hi>Gaul</hi> to plunder the Country as he had done divers times heretofore; then
falling into particulars, he <U+017F>aid, the Town<U+017F>men murmured, becau<U+017F>e whil<U+017F>t this King was
Pillaging and Ravaging all the Country, and carrying away both men women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
Pri<U+017F>oners. <hi>Rithimer</hi> was making love to a young Lady called <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> and did not

                     <p>This la<U+017F>t part touched <hi>Arimant</hi> to the quick, yet being <U+017F>o near me and hoping ere long
to <U+017F>ee me, he waved the thoughts of it; but giving his mind wholly to provide <U+017F>uch
Merchandize as would admit him to my Chamber, he loaded both him<U+017F>elfe and his
man with the fine<U+017F>t Laces and Ribands he could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly procure, and pretended to come
from <hi>Gaul,</hi> from whence <U+017F>uch things commonly come: be<U+017F>ides, having that language,
he might the better be taken for a Merchant of <hi>Gaule.</hi> He <U+017F>pent all the next day in
triming up his equipage of Merchandize; and having very well furni<U+017F>hed his Packes,
he came to the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed for a Pedler. The young man who had
been already there, conducted him to my lodging: Tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>aw him go up with
his Packs, never que<U+017F>tioned whither he went; for taking them for Pedlers, and many
u<U+017F>ing to come thither, they thought it not <U+017F>trange to <U+017F>ee them there. They <U+017F>tayed with
their Packs in the Anti-chamber, where the little boy which waited on me, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by

with joy, that I could not unloo<U+017F>e my armes. My deare<U+017F>t friend, <U+017F>aid I unto him, here
is thy <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> whom the Gods have retu<U+017F>ed, becau<U+017F>e they would not be <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>t as to
rob thee of her. I doe acknowledge, Madam, <U+017F>aid he, that they are Gods, <U+017F>ince they
are ju<U+017F>t But, Madam, <U+017F>aid he, what doe you meane, when you <U+017F>ay my <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide? Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi>
replyed I, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that if <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> be not yours, he is no bodies. I writ it in my
blood, and if you would have a greater<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Te<U+017F>timony, you <U+017F>hall have all I can give, and
that honour will permit me: For I thinke it rea<U+017F>onable that <U+017F>ince I expo<U+017F>ed my life
to pre<U+017F>erve my <U+017F>elfe yours, I <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>erve nothing but render my <U+017F>elfe wholly unto your
di<U+017F>cretion.</p>
                     <p>He would have an<U+017F>wered, when <hi>Clarina</hi> took him off, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he heard <U+017F>ome walking
in the Anti-chamber. Retiring therefore with all ha<U+017F>te, he went to his Companion,
who was begun already to lay open his Merchandize, and to <U+017F>hew them unto <hi>Clarina,</hi>
who <U+017F>eemed to be very bu<U+017F>ie in looking upon <U+017F>everall Laces, when <hi>Rithimer</hi> came into the
Chamber. He u<U+017F>ed to come unto me very often; as if the report which went about the
Town, of his love to me, were not fal<U+017F>e: <U+017F>oever <U+017F>ince the accident which hapned unto
me, his affection to me was increa<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>uch a flame, as his Wife perceived it; <U+017F>he being
naturally jealous; and unwilling any <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hare with her in that which <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
alone <U+017F>he began to hate me extreamly, and was re<U+017F>olved to remove me from <hi>Rithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
as <U+017F>oon as I was able to go abroad: And <U+017F>eeing my Mother extreamly angry with
me for refu<U+017F>ing <hi>Clorangus,</hi> <U+017F>he told her of it. As for the was, <hi>Clarina</hi> heard their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
unknown to them, and told it unto me.</p>
                     <p>This remove which was intended did not trouble me at all; but on the contrary I was
rather glad of it, hoping it would be a meanes of my returne unto <hi>Eporedes,</hi> but I was
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53527:80"/>
much perplexed at the cruelty of my Mother, who <U+017F>wore and vowed that as <U+017F>oon as I
was out of <hi>Rithimers</hi> reach, <U+017F>he would, whether I would or no, make me marry <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This re<U+017F>olution of my Mother moved me unto another, which otherwi<U+017F>e perhaps I
<U+017F>hould not; it was to give my <U+017F>elfe wholly unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> and avoid that tyranny which
<U+017F>he threatned again<U+017F>t me.</p>
                     <p>But to returne unto <hi>Rithimer;</hi> <U+017F>eeing him enter into my Chamber, I de<U+017F>ired <hi>Clarina</hi>
to tell the Pedlers that they <U+017F>hould go away now, and come againe in the morning, and
that then I would buy their Laces. This I did purpo<U+017F>ely, becau<U+017F>e if <hi>Rithimer</hi> <U+017F>aw him
againe, he <U+017F>hould not think it <U+017F>trange. <hi>Arimant</hi> knowing how reports went, concerning
this Princes love unto me, <U+017F>eeing him very amiable, and con<U+017F>idering what favour his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
might procure him, he looked upon him with an eye not like a Pedlers, and vexed
he was to quit his place unto him; yet <U+017F>eeing there was no remedy, he put up his ware,
made a low leg, and went away; and I <U+017F>eeing him going, <U+017F>aid unto him; Farewell good
Friend, be <U+017F>ure you come again to morrow.</p>
                     <p>This was the fir<U+017F>t interview, but to <U+017F>horten my di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; Know, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that the next
day he came againe, when all was gone to the Temple, and when none was in the room
but <hi>Clarina</hi> and my <U+017F>elfe. But to lo<U+017F>e no time, <U+017F>eeing my Mother was re<U+017F>olved as <U+017F>oon as
I was well, to marry me by force unto <hi>Clorangus,</hi> we thought it expedient to be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
and that in the habit of a man <hi>Arimant</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>teale me away, and carry me
where he thought fit, upon a promi<U+017F>e to marry me at the fir<U+017F>t place where it could conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
be done, and that in the mean time we <U+017F>hould live as Brother and Si<U+017F>ter. This
being the re<U+017F>olution, <hi>Arimant</hi> provided clothes, as well for <hi>Clarina,</hi> as for me; he
brought them unto us, and promi<U+017F>ed without faile to be in the hou<U+017F>e where he lodged,
the fifth day after, which he <U+017F>hewed unto <hi>Clarina,</hi> that <U+017F>he might conduct me thither. See
<hi>Hylas,</hi> unto what the <U+017F>everity of Parents may drive their Children, and <U+017F>ee what came
on't: The five dayes being expired, and making no que<U+017F>tion but <hi>Arimant</hi> was at his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
according to appointment; I trimmed my <U+017F>elfe up like a man, and <hi>Clarina</hi> al<U+017F>o, and
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed our <U+017F>elves <U+017F>o well, as meeting my mother when <U+017F>he came from the Temple, <U+017F>he
knew us not; but I was much amazed when I came to <hi>Arimants</hi> lodging, and found no
<hi>Arimant</hi> there, and much more when night came upon us, and could heare no newes of
him: Then did I begin to repent of my ra<U+017F>h act, and being <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty as to <U+017F>tirre out of the
hou<U+017F>e till fir<U+017F>t I knew he was in his lodging: But the greate<U+017F>t trouble was the report <U+017F>pred
abroad all over the Towne that I was lo<U+017F>t, and could not any where be heard of; that I
was <U+017F>earched for all over; This made me tell <hi>Clarina,</hi> that come what fortune would, we
mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome way or other get out of the Town, and that <U+017F>ince <hi>Arimant</hi> was not there, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<U+017F>ome great mi<U+017F>chance had hapned unto him: When we were thus con<U+017F>ulting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
perplexed and knew not which way to turne our <U+017F>elves, I <U+017F>aw the young man who
waited upon <hi>Arimant</hi> enter into the Chamber; imagine <hi>Hylas,</hi> how great our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was when we <U+017F>aw him: Oh my good friend, <U+017F>aid I unto him, where is thy Ma<U+017F>ter?
He is in his owne hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he unto me, but <U+017F>o wounded as he cannot come unto you.
Who wounded him? (replied I, and trembled every joynt): One, an<U+017F>wered he, whom he
has kild, and to be <U+017F>hort, you mu<U+017F>t know that my Ma<U+017F>ter not being ignorant of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne
which <hi>Clorangus</hi> had upon you, he challenged him, they fought, and he killed him;
but yet he came not off without two great wounds, which though not dangerous, yet
are <U+017F>o trouble<U+017F>ome that he can neither ride nor go, the one is in his thigh, and the other
in his leg. Now <U+017F>eeing he could not come hither as he promi<U+017F>ed, he <U+017F>ent me to wait upon
you, and conduct you where he is, having furni<U+017F>hed me with hor<U+017F>es and all things nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary.
Friend, <U+017F>aid I unto him, I knew <U+017F>ome great occa<U+017F>ion hindred thy Ma<U+017F>ter from being
here, I am glad both he and I are rid of the trouble of <hi>Clorangus,</hi> but I wi<U+017F>h it had not
co<U+017F>t him <U+017F>o deare; when thou wilt, we will be going that we may the <U+017F>ooner be with thy
Ma<U+017F>ter, and <U+017F>ee his wounds dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed: Truly, <U+017F>aid he, I thinke there is no better <U+017F>alve than
your <U+017F>elfe; then calling <hi>Clarina</hi> we con<U+017F>ulted what we <U+017F>hould doe to e<U+017F>cape, it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<U+017F>trict guards would be at the Gates: and after a long debate we concluded that the
young man <U+017F>hould goe unto the Pallace of <hi>Rithimer</hi> to heare what people <U+017F>aid, and to
learne if it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, in what manner they <U+017F>earched for me, and that in the mean time
we <U+017F>hould cut our haire, to the end that if they did <U+017F>earch for us, they might not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon
know us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:53527:80"/>
This being re<U+017F>olved upon, the young man went accordingly, and was <U+017F>o nimble and
<U+017F>ubtle, as he mingled him<U+017F>elfe among<U+017F>t the Dome<U+017F>tiques of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> where he heard all
their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to be of nothing but upon me; <U+017F>ome <U+017F>aid I was fled, and had good rea<U+017F>on
for it, becau<U+017F>e they would needs force me to marry <hi>Clorangus,</hi> the uglie<U+017F>t fellow among<U+017F>t
all the <hi>Ci<U+017F>alpine Gaules;</hi> others who thought them<U+017F>elves more wi<U+017F>e, murmured again<U+017F>t
the wife of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> <U+017F>aying <U+017F>he had packt me away, being jealous of her husband and
me, and this opinion went <U+017F>o far that <hi>Rithimer</hi> beleeved it, remembring <U+017F>he had <U+017F>erved
him <U+017F>uch a tricke before, and this was the rea<U+017F>on that when my Mother fell downe upon
her knees and be<U+017F>eeched him that a <U+017F>trict <U+017F>earch might be made for me, he an<U+017F>wered her
with an angry <U+017F>mile: Go, go, Madam, if you doe not know where you daughter is,
aske your Cozen, and without further an<U+017F>wer turned away from her. This was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
that my mother telling this unto his wife, and how <hi>Rithimer</hi> <U+017F>lighted the <U+017F>earch for
me, <U+017F>he beleeved that <hi>Rithimer</hi> had <U+017F>ent me away, and hid me in <U+017F>ome place for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure.</p>
                     <p>As for my Mother, <U+017F>he knew not whom or what to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect; one while <U+017F>he thought <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimer</hi>
had ravi<U+017F>hed me away; another while, that it was his wife, who out of jealou<U+017F>ie
had done it; and to thinke of <hi>Clorangus,</hi> <U+017F>he could not imagine he <U+017F>hould be any in<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in it. And <U+017F>o not knowing which to be the cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected both <hi>Rithimer</hi> and
his wife. Hence it was that all three being jealous of each other, they were not very hot
in <U+017F>earching for me, but rather laughed at one another when <U+017F>uch a thing was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                     <p>This gave we the opportunity of getting out of the Towne by noone, for it being
the market day, we ea<U+017F>ily pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed among<U+017F>t the crowd, none being at the Gates who had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
charge to looke or take any notice of us. So when we were out of the Suburbs of the
Towne, we tooke Hor<U+017F>e, and when we came to a Wood we fell to eat <U+017F>uch Victuals as
the young man had provided for us: Then <U+017F>etting forward, we travelled all the night,
and the next day till noone; then the young man brought us into a Hou<U+017F>e, the Owner
whereof was a friend unto <hi>Arimant,</hi> and unto whom the young man delivered a Letter
from him, for who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ake we were entertained with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible welcome; but I was <U+017F>o
weary with my travell, as I fell a<U+017F>leep almo<U+017F>t with the meat in my mouth, <U+017F>o as we went
all to bed, and re<U+017F>ted our <U+017F>elves here all that day<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and the night following; For my part
I doe not thinke I ever wakened all the time, at lea<U+017F>t I am <U+017F>ure the Sun was up before I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
my eyes, and before I got out of my bed; then the young man called me, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
the night had been <U+017F>horter than u<U+017F>uall: As <U+017F>oon as we were all ready, we <U+017F>et for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
againe and travelled untill night, when we came to the Towne of the <hi>Libicians</hi> with
all contentment. But I cannot expre<U+017F><U+017F>e the joyes of <hi>Arimant,</hi> when I came unto his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide;
it was <U+017F>uch, as his wounds did open again, and began to bleed afre<U+017F>h as he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to keep his bed <U+017F>till; his joyes were <U+017F>o great to <U+017F>ee me in the hou<U+017F>e, as I beleeve, if I
had not taken notice of it, he had <U+017F>aid nothing for fear of affrighting me; but <U+017F>eeing his
colour to change, I asked him whether he did not find him<U+017F>elfe ill: It is nothing, Brother
<U+017F>aid he (for <U+017F>o it was agreed we <U+017F>hould call each other) onely I be<U+017F>eech you let a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
come to me whil<U+017F>t you pull off your boots, for though I be in bed, yet I will <U+017F>up with
you. Then after I had imbraced him, I called for the Chirurgion, and retired my <U+017F>elfe a
little to my Chamber: But oh how jocund were <hi>Clarina</hi> and I when we were together:
for, having pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over <U+017F>o many frights, we now thought our <U+017F>elves returned even from
death to life. Whil<U+017F>t we were thus rejoycing together, one came to adverti<U+017F>e us that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
had lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much blood, that his wounds were much wor<U+017F>e than they were before,
and he in great danger. I ran in a fright unto him, and found that the blood was <U+017F>topped,
but the Chirurgion de<U+017F>ired me to let him re<U+017F>t all that night, and told me that there was
no great danger yet, but that there might be, if good heed was not taken. Then was I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to retire my <U+017F>elfe without <U+017F>eeing him: And <U+017F>ee, <hi>Hylas,</hi> what love can doe; the day
before I was <U+017F>o weary with travelling, as I was not able to keep my eyes open, but now after
as much more pains taken, I could not clo<U+017F>e an eye all the night long, but was <U+017F>till <U+017F>ending
to know how <hi>Arimant</hi> did, and could not re<U+017F>t till the next morning it was permitted me
to <U+017F>ee him. Brother, <U+017F>aid I unto him, were you <U+017F>o ill and would not tell me? I mu<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e
indeed, <U+017F>aid he, that I did perceive my wounds to bleed, but I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e withall,
that I was de<U+017F>irous to lo<U+017F>e a little blood for you, as in payment of the abundance which
you lo<U+017F>t for me. Oh Brother, <U+017F>aid I unto him, our de<U+017F>ignes in that were much different:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53527:81"/>
for in lo<U+017F>ing mine, the intent was to pre<U+017F>erve my <U+017F>elf for you, but you by this would take
your <U+017F>elfe from me.</p>
                     <p>But, <hi>Hylas,</hi> why <U+017F>hould I <U+017F>tand relating all the<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, <U+017F>ince this time, which I mu<U+017F>t
accompt the happie<U+017F>t of all my life, is thus changed, and nothing remaines of it, but <U+017F>o
much memory as to lament the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of it? But however, let me tell you, that after we
had <U+017F>tayed <U+017F>ix weeks in this place, for the recovery of <hi>Arimant,</hi> his Father <U+017F>ent for him;
for he hearing of the Duell with <hi>Clorangus,</hi> he was in continuall feare of him, not onely
in re<U+017F>pect of the wounds he had received, but al<U+017F>o of <hi>Rithimers</hi> hatred. His being thus
ill of his wounds, was the cau<U+017F>e why he deferred all his de<U+017F>igns that he had upon me, until
he was better recovered, and quitted his bed. And now when he was recovered and well,
he began to urge me further then I would permit him: I told him, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider,
I was his, and that tho<U+017F>e Te<U+017F>timonies which I had given, might well put him out
of all doubt of it: That what he de<U+017F>ired was not rea<U+017F>onable, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e upon <U+017F>uch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as might be free form all manner of blame: That he might well thinke, that when
I put my <U+017F>elfe into his hands, it was with a de<U+017F>igne of giving up my <U+017F>elf entirely unto him,
as I had done, and yet would doe; but yet I be<U+017F>eeched him to have regard unto what
both of us ought to doe; for as I owed unto him all manner of contentment and <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<U+017F>o he owed unto me the pre<U+017F>ervation of that thing, which onely could make me
worthy of him, which was my cha<U+017F>tity. And when he an<U+017F>wered, that he never had any
other de<U+017F>igne; and that he had rather die then move any thing unto me, but upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of marriage, I told him, that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible the marriage could be in that place,
but <hi>Rithimer</hi> would know it, and pur<U+017F>ue his revenge, and therefore it was requi<U+017F>ite to
deferre unto <U+017F>ome other time and place which was out of danger. Be<U+017F>ides this con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
it were good that his Father were acquainted with it<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> And though we were both
re<U+017F>olved to go through with our de<U+017F>igne, yet it was but fit and rea<U+017F>onable to render him
that duty. I put him in minde that the Gods were well plea<U+017F>ed with the reverence and
obedience of Children to their Parents; and that if we did <U+017F>o, they would ble<U+017F><U+017F>e our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and actions the better.</p>
                     <p>To be briefe, <hi>Hylas,</hi> I u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o many arguments and rea<U+017F>ons to him, as he taking me in
his armes, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing me; It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible (<U+017F>aid he) to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t any thing you plea<U+017F>e;
and therefore order and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of my life and contentment, as you <U+017F>hall think good. And
when he received his Fathers command to go unto him; doe you not <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid I unto
him, how God begins to pro<U+017F>per our de<U+017F>igne, <U+017F>ince we are going unto that place where we
may more ea<U+017F>ily accompli<U+017F>h it?</p>
                     <p>He therefore went unto him, and carried me al<U+017F>o; but being unwilling his Father
<U+017F>hould know me, before he had con<U+017F>ented unto his marriage, he changed my name, and
called me <hi>Cleomires,</hi> <U+017F>aying I was a Tran<U+017F>alpine <hi>Gaul,</hi> and that I having that language, I
<U+017F>hould the better pa<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o. Then for a better colour of keeping me with him, he <U+017F>aid I had
<U+017F>aved his life in his Combate with <hi>Clorangus,</hi> having hindred two of his men in ambu<U+017F>h
from falling upon him, and forced them to fly; <U+017F>o as this generous act forced him never to
part from me.</p>
                     <p>Thus we <U+017F>et forward in our journey, and arrived at <hi>Eporedes,</hi> where <hi>Arimants</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
received us with <U+017F>uch welcome, as did manife<U+017F>t the affection which he bore unto his
Son: And when he under<U+017F>tood me to be <hi>Cleomires,</hi> of who<U+017F>e valour and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance his
Son had informed him, I cannot expre<U+017F><U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e thankes and offers which he made unto
me: for truly he was a very noble minded Cavalier, full of virtue, and worthy of the
Title which he had.</p>
                     <p>Both <hi>Arimant</hi> and I were very glad of <U+017F>o good a beginning, hoping that ere long this
good entertainment would bring us to a happy conclu<U+017F>ion of our de<U+017F>ires. Some dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pa<U+017F>t, and <hi>Arimant</hi> not able to re<U+017F>t until our marriage was concluded, we con<U+017F>ulted
together how to bring it about; In conclu<U+017F>ion, we did all foure concur in opinion, (for
<hi>Clarina</hi> and the young man, were alwaies admitted to our Coun<U+017F>ells) that the be<U+017F>t way
was, for me to make the over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o farre into his good opinion, us he believed what<U+017F>oever I <U+017F>aid, and would be
coun<U+017F>elled and advi<U+017F>ed unto any thing I would. I took this charge upon me much again<U+017F>t
my heart, thinking it to be again<U+017F>t cu<U+017F>tome for me to be the wooer, it being ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the mans part: Yet having already broken the cu<U+017F>tomes of other women, and a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the habit of man, I thought my affection at this time, might well make me undertake

it; and <U+017F>eeing it was <hi>Arimants</hi> mind, I thought it a crime to contradict it.</p>
                     <p>I went therefore unto the Father, who was walking by him<U+017F>elf in the Garden; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a <U+017F>alute, and <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the fine <U+017F>cituation of the place, I fell at length to talk
upon the contentment which every one had in <U+017F>eeing them<U+017F>elves perpetuated in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
And afterwards hinting unto him that it <U+017F>hould be his al<U+017F>o, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but al<U+017F>o of all <hi>Aemilia;</hi> he an<U+017F>wered me, that my affection to him, made me

doe love him above any Cavalier I ever knew: but I doe a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, Sir, before I did

I cannot chu<U+017F>e but wonder, that it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o long before you marry him; It is full time,
his age requires it; and I believe it would be a great addition of contentment unto you,

more opportunity of knowing her better then others: and if you plea<U+017F>e I will propo<U+017F>e her
unto you, but it <U+017F>hall be upon condition, that you honour me <U+017F>o farre, as to take all I <U+017F>ay,
to proceed from one who infinitely honours you, and loves <hi>Arimans</hi> above all the world.
You have already given, my Son, good te<U+017F>timony of what you <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered he, and
I have <U+017F>uch a beliefe of your affection unto me, as you need not que<U+017F>tion but I <U+017F>hall take
what<U+017F>oever you propound; as coming from one whom I ought to love, honour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
before any that I know.</p>
                     <p>In this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance Sir, replyed I, I <U+017F>hall tell you, that there is one in this very Towne,
who<U+017F>e noblene<U+017F><U+017F>e of Family, virtue, and <U+017F>uch love as ought to be betwixt Husband and

The<U+017F>e things altogether, are not incon<U+017F>iderable. Good <hi>Cleomires,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, name her
quickly. It is, Sir, replyed I and blu<U+017F>hed, <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide.</hi> Truly, <U+017F>aid he then, as for her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and Portion I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it; but as for the re<U+017F>t, I know not what to <U+017F>ay:
and I mu<U+017F>t tell you, the time was when I thought to motion it unto her mother, and had
done it, but that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o neare of kin unto the wife of <hi>Rithimer,</hi> who is my mortall
enemy. Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, will you be plea<U+017F>ed to let me <U+017F>peak in her behalfe, without
offence unto your judgement? unto which he an<U+017F>wering, yes, I went on thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> has done two things, which may well make you change your judgement of
her: The fir<U+017F>t is, The cutting her veines<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and chu<U+017F>ing rather to die, then marry <hi>Clorangus:</hi>
And the other is, Her flight out of the hands of her Mother. But to cleare the<U+017F>e two
things unto you, Sir, I mu<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cover a thing unto you, which I believe you did not know,
and which I be<U+017F>eech you not to take ill, <U+017F>ince all due re<U+017F>pect was ever pre<U+017F>erved unto
you. Be plea<U+017F>ed therefore to know Sir, that <hi>Arimant</hi> having <U+017F>een her of whom we <U+017F>peak,
and con<U+017F>idering her beauty, he fell in love with her, and u<U+017F>ed all wayes to make him<U+017F>elfe
loved: She being <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the honour which you Son did her; after long Court<U+017F>hip,
and <U+017F>uch addre<U+017F><U+017F>es as are u<U+017F>uall among<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons that love, <U+017F>he aked him what his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in it was, <hi>Arimant,</hi> in this, as well as in all other his actions, <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elf a noble
Cavalier, and one that did not degenerate from the vertue of his illu<U+017F>trious Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors,
but an<U+017F>wered her, that his preten<U+017F>ions were to obtaine her favour in way of marriage:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:53527:82"/>
And when <U+017F>he <U+017F>et before him the hatred which <hi>Rithimer</hi> bore unto you, and the neer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
betwixt his wife and her mother; <hi>Arimant</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that the Gods who would
not have this emnity perpetuall, perhaps intended to reconcile the two Hou<U+017F>es by this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance;
and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him<U+017F>elfe, that when you Sir were acquainted with it (for he would
do nothing without your permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion) you would like of it, and commend his ju<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ign.
After this, Love did every day <U+017F>o increa<U+017F>e on both <U+017F>ides as they promi<U+017F>ed each other to
marry, provided your approbation could be procured, and in the mean time both of them
to u<U+017F>e their utmo<U+017F>t endeavours to obtain the con<U+017F>ent of their Parents.</p>
                     <p>When things was brought to this pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Chry<U+017F>eide</hi> was carried away unto <hi>Rithimers</hi>
hou<U+017F>e, where they would needs force her to marry <hi>Clorangus;</hi> you know Sir what kind
of man he was, the mo<U+017F>t deformed and vitiou<U+017F>ly minded of all men living, but though he
had been the mo<U+017F>t compleat and plea<U+017F>ing, yet <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> could not marry him, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given her <U+017F>elfe unto your Son: Yet in this, you may <U+017F>ee her vertue, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he
had promi<U+017F>ed nothing but upon condition of their con<U+017F>ent upon whom <U+017F>he depended, and
finding their minds <U+017F>o far from her de<U+017F>ires, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to dye; this was an act of vertue
beyond <hi>Lucretia's;</hi> for <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> would prevent the crime before hand and dye; but the
other dyed not till after the crime committed. If this be not a great demon<U+017F>tration of her
love to <hi>Arimant,</hi> and whether <U+017F>he was not re<U+017F>olved to pre<U+017F>erve her affection intirely for
him, I refer it Sir, unto your judgement. But <U+017F>o it was, that <U+017F>he being miraculou<U+017F>ly re<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued
from the grave, and began to recover the great lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of her blood, <U+017F>he was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
by one of her Mothers maids, that her Mother and <hi>Rithimers</hi> wife would packe her out
of the pre<U+017F>ence of that Prince to make her marry <hi>Clorangus</hi> whether <U+017F>he would or no.
Now <U+017F>he thought it high time to have recour<U+017F>e unto the la<U+017F>t remedy, and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e had
if <hi>Arimant</hi> had not come unto her, and with tears in his eyes diverted her from that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
re<U+017F>olution, and told her that mo<U+017F>t certainly if <U+017F>he did dye he would follow her, and
therefore it was better to retire her <U+017F>elfe from this cruell tyranny of her Mother; that if
<U+017F>he would tru<U+017F>t him, he would vow by all <U+017F>acred and inviolable oathes, he would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
her among<U+017F>t the Ve<U+017F>tals, where <U+017F>he might <U+017F>tay untill he could obtain your approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their marriage.</p>
                     <p>Now Sir, I be<U+017F>eech you judge whether the<U+017F>e two actions can be di<U+017F>liked, or whether
there wanted any either genero<U+017F>ity or love in this woman, or any other quality or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which you can de<U+017F>ire?</p>
                     <p>And thus I ended, extreamly a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hing the father, who walked two or three turnes
without <U+017F>peaking one word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> whil<U+017F>t I was in expectation of the <U+017F>entence either of life or
death: At la<U+017F>t lifting up his head which he had all the while hung downe, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered thus.</p>
                     <p>I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Cleomire</hi> you have told me mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange things, which may well plead
my excu<U+017F>e for being a little pen<U+017F>ive. But con<U+017F>idering that there is nothing in this world
which comes by chance, but by the wi<U+017F>e providence of the Gods, I will beleeve that all
the<U+017F>e things which you have told me, have happened by their wils, &amp; <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o, I <U+017F>hould
be very har<U+017F>h if I offer to cro<U+017F><U+017F>e them. My Son, you <U+017F>ay, loves <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> and I do beleeve it,
for I have heard that his voyage to the <hi>Libicians,</hi> was only to make addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto her, and
fight with <hi>Clorangus</hi> who pretended unto her. <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> hath al<U+017F>o given very great te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of her love to him. I doe conclude from hence, that the Gods do never make <U+017F>uch
contraries to meet, and <U+017F>ympathetically agree, but they are contented with the good will
which is betwixt them. Friend, I do commend my Sons choice, for <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> doth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
de<U+017F>erve to be loved, and now I know her rea<U+017F>ons which induced her unto what <U+017F>he
did, my e<U+017F>teem of her is double unto what it was. Tell therefore my Son as much, for I
<U+017F>ee that it was he who imployed you to <U+017F>peak unto me? Tell him, that <U+017F>ince according
to his duty he has re<U+017F>pected me <U+017F>o much as not to contract with <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> without my
con<U+017F>ent, I doe take it <U+017F>o kindly, as I both approve and commend his choice, and pray
unto the Gods that I may <U+017F>oon <U+017F>ee them both together: And though I doe fore<U+017F>ee that
<hi>Richimer</hi> will rage more hatred again<U+017F>t me, and colour it with my Sons offence in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>hing
his wifes Cozen out of his hou<U+017F>e, yet that <U+017F>hall not make me alter my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

                     <p>I beleeve <hi>Hylas,</hi> you thinke that this an<U+017F>wer did give me as much contentment as I
could de<U+017F>ire, and well you might; for after I kneeled downe and thanked him in behalf
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53527:82"/>
of his Son and <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> (not daring to declare my <U+017F>elfe without the advice of my dear <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimant</hi>)
I thought he would never have <U+017F>atisfied him<U+017F>elfe with thanking me, hugging and
ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing me. Then I parted from him, and went to acquaint <hi>Arimant</hi> with my happy <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>e
which ravi<U+017F>hed him beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion: At la<U+017F>t it was re<U+017F>olved among<U+017F>t us, that
<U+017F>ince I had told his Father I was among<U+017F>t the Ve<U+017F>tals, I <U+017F>hould not yet declare my <U+017F>elfe, le<U+017F>t
I <U+017F>hould be taken in a lie; For all lies have this quality, that when they are known, they
make truth it <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected. And to avoid the rage of <hi>Rithimer</hi> and my mother we
thought it be<U+017F>t to conceale our marriage for a while, whil<U+017F>t in the mean time endeavours
were u<U+017F>ed to pacific them: <hi>Arimants</hi> Father approved of this, and from thence forward
referred the whole matter unto the will of his Son.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>ee, how men purpo<U+017F>e, and God di<U+017F>po<U+017F>eth, who would have thought but

all our cro<U+017F><U+017F>es hitherto were but playes in compari<U+017F>on of what en<U+017F>ued; For <hi>Arimant</hi> and
I de<U+017F>iring to con<U+017F>ummate our de<U+017F>ign, pretended to go unto <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> and after we had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
womens cloths, and all that was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for our marriage, and were come into
a Towne of the <hi>Caturges,</hi> we intended to <U+017F>tay there <U+017F>o long as to make the father beleeve
we were gone unto her whom we had with us. But as ill luck was, <hi>Gundehunt</hi> King of the
<hi>Burgundians</hi> having pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over the Alps with a pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant Army, did fall into the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of the <hi>Taurinois</hi> and <hi>Caturges</hi> <U+017F>o unexpectedly as he found them without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or thoughts of any Enemy: And by fortune, the very next day we came into this
Towne, he fell upon it, where all they could do was to <U+017F>hut the Gates again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e
of the fir<U+017F>t Comers; but when the maine body of the army came up, all the inhabitants
could then do was to render their Town upon <U+017F>uch pittifull condition as little mended the
matter, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e that the women were not ravi<U+017F>hed nor their Temples pillaged as they were

<hi>Hylas</hi> what a lamentable <U+017F>ight was it to <U+017F>ee women carried away Captives out of

So <U+017F>adly did I re<U+017F>ent this mi<U+017F>ery, as I can <U+017F>peake it experimentally: as fortune was, I was

that I could not trim my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o well as I de<U+017F>ired; and poor <hi>Arimant</hi> did cara<U+017F><U+017F>e me, as
if he did fore<U+017F>ee it <U+017F>hould be the la<U+017F>t time: The Towne was pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>tributed into
quarters; and every place a<U+017F><U+017F>igned unto <U+017F>ome troope, who by degrees turned the Owners
out of doors, both men, moveables and hor<U+017F>es<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 
                        <hi>Arimant</hi> hearing of this ba<U+017F>e capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
went crying through the Towne, that it was better to dye than <U+017F>ubmit unto <U+017F>uch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
termes, telling the people that their wals were yet up, that the Enemies had no
wings to fly over them, that their arrowes were not all <U+017F>pent, nor their bowes broken:
he promi<U+017F>ed them that he would defend their Towne till <hi>Rithimer</hi> came to relieve them,
who was already upon his march, and that they <U+017F>hould never be branded with <U+017F>o much ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy.
But <U+017F>eeing there was no remedy, and that none <U+017F>tirred upon his words, he drew
his Sword, and cryed in the open <U+017F>treets that the principals of the Towne had betrayed
and <U+017F>old the people; that for their parts they would receive no harm, but all would fall
upon the poor people, <U+017F>o as it was better to give them up to the Enemy, and <U+017F>ave the re<U+017F>t:
And thus he cryed out <U+017F>o lowd, as he was followed by <U+017F>ome, with whom he <U+017F>eized upon
a Gate, which he defended <U+017F>o well, that <hi>Gondebunt</hi> was forced to retreat, and fall on upon
another Quarter, where the Inhabitants did let him in: And thus betrayed by tho<U+017F>e of
the place, whil<U+017F>t he was repul<U+017F>ing tho<U+017F>e Enemies which were before him, he was a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted
<U+017F>o furiou<U+017F>ly upon the backe, as at la<U+017F>t, vertue being over powred by number, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
many wounds, he was taken and killed, though he would never yeild, chu<U+017F>ing
rather to dye, then fall into the hands of tho<U+017F>e, whom he called <hi>Barbarians.</hi> As for me,
to my mi<U+017F>ery, though I may call it good fortune, that part of the Towne where I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be was a<U+017F><U+017F>igned for the Quarter of King <hi>Gondebunt;</hi> and tho<U+017F>e who were with
him tooke me and many other Ladies pri<U+017F>oners, and all committed to <U+017F>afe cu<U+017F>tody; where
we <U+017F>tayed untill the coming of this great King, in hopes his genero<U+017F>ity would give us li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,

                     <p>Now <hi>Hylas</hi> you know both me and my fortune which I beleeve you will thinke to be

when it was <U+017F>o late, that all her companions came to tell her it was time to retire. And
waiting upon them unto the <U+017F>ide of the River <hi>Arar,</hi> I then retired as full of love, as I
was of <U+017F>atisfaction, to know that this faire one had learned how to love, and that her
affection was not <U+017F>ettled any where, <U+017F>ince the death of <hi>Arimant,</hi> which gave me abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

unto it. What? what doe you expect more from me? <U+017F>aid he, and wondred
they <U+017F>hould expect it: If there be any among<U+017F>t you, that knowes any more of the <U+017F>tory
then I have related, I <U+017F>hall willingly lend them audience; but if you look for any more
from me, good friends, you will be mi<U+017F>taken, for I have not a jot more to tell you. All the

unto her all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age in the Temple, and how <U+017F>he did not know <hi>Bellaris,</hi> whom

he revived: when he opened his eyes, he wondered to <U+017F>ee where he was, and I fearing his
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment might do him hurt; courage, Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, the Gods will <U+017F>end us
better fortune: The Gods, <hi>Bellaris</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) are indeed very good, but my de<U+017F>tiny is

would needs regulate the matter; But the Souldiers thinking he would take all their Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

from them, in lieu of obeying, fell upon him, and <U+017F>o, as he was forced to <U+017F>ave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elfe
by running to the <U+017F>table door where we were. The Souldiers who had laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide
all re<U+017F>pect, and knew that if he e<U+017F>caped their hands, he would have them all puni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
they re<U+017F>olved to kill him, hoping then to be <U+017F>afe and enjoy their Plunder. In order to
this de<U+017F>igne, they endeavoured to enter in; which <hi>Arimant</hi> con<U+017F>idering, let us defend this

he will doe the like for us: Upon this, drawing both our <U+017F>words, we took his part;
and though my Ma<U+017F>ter was much wounded, yet his courage which never failed him, gave
him <U+017F>trength enough to repell the fury of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ouldiers; <U+017F>ome were killed, others taken,
and the re<U+017F>t fled.</p>

all I did, and if I have done you any <U+017F>ervice, I de<U+017F>ire no other recompence, but that you

Captaine upon this looking better upon him, and <U+017F>eeing by his habit that he was no <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundian,</hi>
he <U+017F>aid thus unto him: Sir, I do receive you as you de<U+017F>ire, not to u<U+017F>e you as a

we found, and who according to the cu<U+017F>tome of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> did <U+017F>eldome remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
any benefits; for though he was a <hi>Vi<U+017F>igot</hi> yet he followed the King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi>
as a per<U+017F>on who <U+017F>ought for fortune where<U+017F>oever he was in hopes to find it. The fir<U+017F>t day,
we received all the kind u<U+017F>age we could expect upon <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion; But the next day,
being better informed of the quality of his Pri<U+017F>oner, by <U+017F>ome in the Town, he began to
keep us under better guard, pretending it was becau<U+017F>e he would have us keep our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
that our wounds might <U+017F>ooner heale, forbidding any to <U+017F>peak with us: Afterwards,
<U+017F>eeing the Army was to move, and he not knowing whither, he took my Ma<U+017F>ter apart,
and told him, that in performance of his word, he was forced to <U+017F>end him over the Alpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

becau<U+017F>e the King being informed, that it was he who had rai<U+017F>ed the oppo<U+017F>ition in the
Town, and had cau<U+017F>ed the death of many of his men; he has commanded him to be
<U+017F>earched for throughout all the Army, intending to put him to death, as a terrour unto
the neighbouring Towns: that perhaps he could make a <U+017F>hift to protect him again<U+017F>t any
but the authority of the King: That he would willingly let him pa<U+017F><U+017F>e free among<U+017F>t his
own Souldiers if he dur<U+017F>t, but it would hazard his life if the King <U+017F>hould heare he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<U+017F>uch a thing without his con<U+017F>ent: yet on the contrary, he could without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
<U+017F>end him beyond the Alpes, <U+017F>ince it was permitted unto all the Souldiers to <U+017F>end
their Pri<U+017F>oners and Pillage thither. But as <U+017F>oon as the Army was returned unto <hi>Bungun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi>
he would <U+017F>end him back unto <hi>Eporedes,</hi> or any other place he plea<U+017F>ed. <hi>Arimant</hi> then
asked him, whether the Queen had <U+017F>ent her Pri<U+017F>oners thither al<U+017F>o? The Queen, an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Captaine, is not here; but they have <U+017F>ent their Pri<U+017F>oners thither, to the end the
Army may be di<U+017F>charged of them. My Ma<U+017F>ter looked upon me, as if he had <U+017F>aid, you
are mi<U+017F>taken, and afterwards continued; I will go, <U+017F>aid he, whither you plea<U+017F>e, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring

                     <p>Do the next morning betimes, not without great danger of my Ma<U+017F>ters life, by rea<U+017F>on

Gods doe know, there is not a day, nor an hour, nor a minute, in which <hi>Clarina</hi> and I
have not talked of him with eyes full of teares. Now my deare friend, I will declare one
thing unto you, which I have not yet mentioned unto any; but finding my <U+017F>elfe in this
condition, and fore<U+017F>eeing that it will be wor<U+017F>e with me, I am forced to tell it unto you,
that by your Coun<U+017F>ell I may find a remedy. Know <hi>Bellaris,</hi> that <hi>Gondebunt</hi> the King of
<hi>Burgundie,</hi> is faln in love with me; I know it both by his deportment towards me, and
his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. I would not upon any termes reject him at the fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e an incen<U+017F>ed
love may drive a man unto violent cour<U+017F>es: but after I had given him many thanks for the
honour he did me; I told him, that I was none of the common <U+017F>ort of people, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of the be<U+017F>t Families among<U+017F>t the <hi>Salla<U+017F><U+017F>es: Rithimers</hi> wife, who was <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter

much; and that upon his returne he would make it appeare, how much he e<U+017F>teemed my

Could<U+017F>t thou but doe as thou <U+017F>ay<U+017F>t, my obligation to thee would be extream; if thou
can<U+017F>t but get a Boat upon the River <hi>Arar</hi> under my window, it is <U+017F>o near the ground,
that by the help of thy hand, I could come down in the night. Enough, <U+017F>aid he, I can do
it; but how <U+017F>hall we pa<U+017F><U+017F>e the Chaines which are at the end of the Town, before we come
to the River? Friend, replyed <U+017F>he<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> God will help us; and if thou wilt but take a little
paines, thou wilt ea<U+017F>ily find the meanes; for I have heard that others have e<U+017F>caped the

But the wor<U+017F>t is, I have not money to buy Hor<U+017F>es or Boat, or to make you clothes in the

                     <p>In the meane while, he took notice of the place where they were to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, where their

together a cro<U+017F>s the River; he went the night before and filed the ring of one Boat,
<U+017F>o as it was held together by a little <U+017F>trength. All things being thus ready, and the
hour appointed being come, <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> ro<U+017F>e out of bed, and <hi>Clarina</hi> al<U+017F>o; And being in
their fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>leeps in the dead of the night, they went out of the window without any noi<U+017F>e,
and took Boat; and <hi>Bellaris</hi> being their conductor, pu<U+017F>hed the Boat from the <U+017F>hore, and
hit right upon the Boat who<U+017F>e ring he had filed, which breaking out right, with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
noi<U+017F>e as he could for feare of being heard by the Guards, he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed through with his
Boat, though a little after they were all in great danger of being drowned<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> For the
<hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> into which the River <hi>Arar</hi> runs, it was <U+017F>o rough, and the Boat <U+017F>o little, al<U+017F>o the
Waterman not being very skilfull, as the danger was great, but at la<U+017F>t he gained the <U+017F>hore:
And though it was much lower then he aimed at, yet by the help of the Moon which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to <U+017F>hine, he found the place where a little boy held their Hor<U+017F>es, who al<U+017F>o promi<U+017F>ed
him to be his guid.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t they were fitting all things about the Hor<U+017F>es, <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> and <hi>Clarina</hi> did take

And after they had with much wearine<U+017F><U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the <hi>Cemmenian</hi> Mountaines,
travelling more by night then day, and eating alwaies in <U+017F>ome wood, in which the
Country was abundant; they came at la<U+017F>t to the Town of <hi>Gergovia,</hi> in which <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi>
was not afraid to lodge, becau<U+017F>e it was in the Dominions of <hi>Eurick</hi> King of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots.</hi>
She took up her lodgings therefore in an Inn; and the faithfull <hi>Bellaris</hi> went the next

                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as he was returned, the Captaine of the Ca<U+017F>tle brought him to his Ma<U+017F>ter:

the valiant <hi>Bellimart</hi> is not returned neither, <U+017F>o as I have lo<U+017F>t my journey. I met with one
that was your Cou<U+017F>in, who was very inqui<U+017F>itive of you, and offers you all a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance unto
the King and <hi>Bellimart,</hi> and is confident of finding favour, otherwi<U+017F>e my journey is to
no purpo<U+017F>e: and I believe that ere long; I mu<U+017F>t have another; for the King is dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
You had done very well to have <U+017F>tayed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Arimant,</hi> and not returned with
<U+017F>o little contentment unto me. Sir, an<U+017F>wered he, I was in feare you would have thought
my <U+017F>tay too long; and having none to wait upon you I thought it better to return, then
<U+017F>tay <U+017F>o long to no purpo<U+017F>e. Then the Captaine began to <U+017F>peak; you had better have <U+017F>tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<U+017F>aid he, then make another journey; for according to the intelligence which we have,
if the King be not come already, he will not <U+017F>tay long.</p>
                     <p>But as <U+017F>oon as the Captaine was gone, and they two alone, <hi>Bellaris</hi> fell down upon his
knee, took his Ma<U+017F>ters hand, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it, and with a <U+017F>miling countenance, <U+017F>aid unto him;
I perceive<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Sir, you are di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with my journey, but I believe you will bid me wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
when you know all How does <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Arimant?</hi> Does <U+017F>he endure her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>onment
well, and does <U+017F>he <U+017F>till love me? Suppo<U+017F>e, Sir, replyed, <hi>Bellaris,</hi> I <U+017F>hould bring
you better newes then all this; would you then <U+017F>ay I were welcome? What better newes
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Arimant</hi>) can<U+017F>t thou bring then this? I will not onely tell you, Sir, replyed
<hi>Bellaris,</hi> That <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> is well<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and that <U+017F>he loves you as well as ever: But more, <U+017F>he is
at liberty: nay more yet, <U+017F>he is coming to you; <hi>Clarina</hi> and <U+017F>he doe <U+017F>tay for you in
<hi>Gergovia, Bellaris,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Cavalier and <U+017F>miled, is this all true thou <U+017F>ay<U+017F>t? Doe you
thinke, Sir, <U+017F>aid this faithful <U+017F>ervant, that I would bring you any lies? The goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of
the Gods be prai<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Arimant,</hi> and lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him<U+017F>elf towards <hi>Bellaris:</hi> But friend, is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible all this <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o? Can <U+017F>o much
happine<U+017F><U+017F>e come all at once? Sir, an<U+017F>wered he, doe not make any doubt of what I <U+017F>ay;
and to te<U+017F>tifie my affection and fidelity, you may to morrow, if you will, <U+017F>ee this fair one,

he began to relate unto him, how he met with <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> in the Temple, and in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;

Now, Sir, you mu<U+017F>t make all the ha<U+017F>te you can to get from hence for doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e,
King <hi>Gondebunt</hi> is even very now upon his return; and then you may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elte,
that <hi>Bellimart</hi> will either come or <U+017F>end for you; you know his covetous and greedy
mind, and God knowes how he will u<U+017F>e you: you may remember his ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, and you cannot hope for any courte<U+017F>ie from him, who has <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elfe
already <U+017F>o unworthy. Be<U+017F>ides, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay long where <U+017F>he is,

it is full time to make all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>te out of this Country<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and judge whether or no

<U+017F>ome hurt, and if it could be contrived <U+017F>ome other way it would be better. No, no,
Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Bellaris,</hi> there is no other way: For in the fir<U+017F>t place, time does pre<U+017F><U+017F>e you, and
there is no probability that this man who guards you, will be corrupted by Gifts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
he thinkes your Ran<U+017F>ome will be very high<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and it is probable that <hi>Bellimart</hi> has
promi<U+017F>ed him a <U+017F>hare. And as for me never let it trouble you for I am confident the Gods
will help tho<U+017F>e who hope in them, and are faithful to their Ma<U+017F>ters, by <U+017F>ome unexpected
meanes<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Can I doe you any better <U+017F>ervice, Sir, then in a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of this importance? But
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the Barbarian <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e me with the wor<U+017F>t of his cruelty; <U+017F>hall any danger what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever
deter me from doing you <U+017F>ervice? If I die, it is no more then I ought to doe for
you<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> And I can never doe it with more honour then in gaining your liberty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment:
If on the contrary, I <U+017F>hould not, I may be upbraided all the dayes of my
life, for lo<U+017F>ing <U+017F>o faire an opportunity of te<U+017F>tifying how much I am devoted to you. Doe
not ravi<U+017F>h from me this Glory, I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>ir, I aske it in recompence of all the <U+017F>ervice
I ever did you, and onely require three things from you: The fir<U+017F>t, That if I die, you will
remember, you never had a more faithfull <U+017F>ervant: Secondly, if I live, that you will give
<hi>Clarina</hi> unto me for my Wife: And la<U+017F>tly, That when you are got out from hence, you
will make all ha<U+017F>te away that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly you can, le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould be taken againe. Thus
continuing his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <U+017F>o much urgency, he prevailed <U+017F>o far with <hi>Arimant,</hi> as not
to deny him his reque<U+017F>t, though it was with abundance of <U+017F>orrow to leave him in <U+017F>o
much danger.</p>
                     <p>Night then being come, <hi>Arimant</hi> entreated the Captaine, as <hi>Bellaris</hi> propo<U+017F>ed, to
give him leave to goe again, who the King knowing would ere long beat Lyons, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irous
to be fingering of the Ran<U+017F>ome as <U+017F>oon as he could, whereof he was to receive a
good <U+017F>hare; he did not onely give leave, but advi<U+017F>ed him unto it, and that he would
<U+017F>end a Letter by him unto <hi>Bellimart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the departure of <hi>Bellaris</hi> was re<U+017F>olved upon; and the Gate was ordered to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
for him when he would: <hi>Bellaris</hi> informed <hi>Arimant</hi> in all things; to wit, where he
<U+017F>houl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

telling him it was better to go a little about, and go more <U+017F>afely. In <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as
this, they <U+017F>pent a good part of the night; another part in <U+017F>hifting habits, and taking or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for all things requi<U+017F>ite; <U+017F>o as when it was break of day, after <hi>Arimant</hi> had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
his faithful <U+017F>ervant with many teares, and recommending him<U+017F>elfe unto <hi>Mercury,</hi>
he <U+017F>et forward towards the Gate in great feare of di<U+017F>covery; for though he had the clothes
of <hi>Bellaris,</hi> yet he was not like him, being much bigger, and faces <U+017F>o unlike as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
not to know the one from the other, if the lea<U+017F>t notice was taken; yet he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed
without any rub, it being dark, and <U+017F>peciall order being given for it <hi>Bellaris</hi> looked after
him out of his Chamber window, as farre into the plain as his eye could reach, and he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53527:87"/>
ob<U+017F>erved how <hi>Arimant</hi> looked often back to <U+017F>ee whether any followed him. At la<U+017F>t, when
he was out of <U+017F>ight, then the danger wherein he was, began to pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elfe before his
eyes, and he thought upon the horrors of death: But neither death nor danger, nor any
thing, could make him repent of what he had done, or be <U+017F>orry for it in the le<U+017F>t manner.
Yet, as every one de<U+017F>ires to prolong his life as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he can; <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as he had
got his Ma<U+017F>ter away, he would now try what he could doe for him<U+017F>elfe. He turned the
Doublet and the Stockings of <hi>Arimant</hi> the wrong <U+017F>ide outward, and <U+017F>ullied his Hat, <U+017F>o
as it had a re<U+017F>emblance of his own. As fortune was, <hi>Arimant</hi> had left his Cloak behind
him, perhaps on purpo<U+017F>e to be the lighter: To be briefe, he tricked up him<U+017F>elfe as well
as he could, and with a confident countenance he went to the Gate and offered to goe
out: The Corporal who commanded there denyed him, <U+017F>aying, that one was already
gone out, and he had no command for any more. But <hi>Bellaris</hi> <U+017F>hewing him a Letter
which was directed unto <hi>Bellimart,</hi> and the Captaines hand which was known unto all
tho<U+017F>e at the Gates, they permitted him to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. But fir<U+017F>t, the Corporall who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
in his office, would not <U+017F>uffer it without a new command, and therefore <U+017F>ent him
with a Souldier to know the Captaines will; the Souldier went, but being very early,
and they keeping <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e at the Captaines Chamber door, they awaked him: then
he was very angry with the Corporal for not letting any to pa<U+017F>s who had Letters for him;
<U+017F>o the Captaine being angry at his being wakened, he turned about and fell fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leepe
againe.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Bellaris</hi> got out of the Ca<U+017F>tle, and taking his way towards <hi>Gergovia,</hi> he made
as much ha<U+017F>te as if he had wings at his heels: But his Ma<U+017F>ter having got the <U+017F>tart of him,
and finding out the Inn, he went and knocked at <hi>Cry<U+017F>eides</hi> Chamber door, who being but
in a <U+017F>lumber did pre<U+017F>ently hear him, and called upon <hi>Clarina</hi> to <U+017F>ee who it was: <hi>Clarina</hi>
<U+017F>he aro<U+017F>e out of bed, put her Petticoat on, and a Mantle over her <U+017F>houlders, and went to
the door with her eyes hardly open. <hi>Bellaris,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, thou art welcome, we have long
looked for thee. And <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> being very impatient, did ask who it was: It is <hi>Bellaris,</hi>
Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, let him come in, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> perhaps he brings good newes. Yes,
Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Arimant,</hi> I doe bring you very good newes. <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> hearing him, and
knowing his voyce: Oh my good God, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>tarted up, it is the voyce of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant:</hi>
Then drawing the Curtain, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him already upon his knees by her beds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ide. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine,
Madam, how this did <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e her, and how infinitely <U+017F>he was joyed? She ca<U+017F>t her
armes about his neck, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed him <U+017F>o long, as if <U+017F>he intended never to part from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
As for him, he was <U+017F>o over-joyed to have his deare <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> in his armes, that he
held her <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t his brea<U+017F>t, as <U+017F>he was afraid he would have <U+017F>topped her breath:
<hi>Clarina</hi> having <U+017F>hut the door, did look upon them, and <U+017F>tood immoveable, <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>hed
with admiration, as <U+017F>he knew not whether it was waking or dreaming. After <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood
thus like a <U+017F>tatue a long while, <U+017F>he went to open the windows, afterwards went to them
againe, and found them <U+017F>till embracing, and her <U+017F>elfe as much ravi<U+017F>hed as before: Then
fearing they would even die with over joy, <U+017F>he thought good to part them for a while,
that they might take a little breath; but checking her <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he let them alone to glut
them<U+017F>elves with ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing and carra<U+017F><U+017F>ing; and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e they had not ended <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, if they
had not heard one knock at the Chamber door. <hi>Clarina</hi> wondred, and could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
who <U+017F>hould come <U+017F>o early to trouble them. <hi>Arimant</hi> aro<U+017F>e, and laying his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his <U+017F>word, he went to the Chamber door; but never was man <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed as he; for
he <U+017F>aw <hi>Bellaris,</hi> beyond all hope or thought; Oh Heaven my dear friend, <U+017F>aid he, Is it
thee? Yes, Sir, <U+017F>aid he, the Gods have delivered me, that I may doe <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
O good Gods, replyed <hi>Arimant,</hi> Can all this good fortune continue; <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> at
liberty, I at liberty, <hi>Bellaris</hi> at liberty too? this is happine<U+017F><U+017F>e beyond all hopes. Then
taking him by the hand, he carryed him to <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> related unto her how he had got
him to e<U+017F>cape, and unto what extream danger he expo<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe. When <U+017F>he and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
began to give him thanks, he interrupted them, <U+017F>aying; <U+017F>pare your words, Sir, I

and when we are more at lei<U+017F>ure I <U+017F>hall tell you how I e<U+017F>caped.</p>

and after the reckning of the hou<U+017F>e was di<U+017F>charged, <hi>Arimant</hi> took the hor<U+017F>e of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

they went <U+017F>lower, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Bellaris</hi> was on foot; and who by the way, telling them how
he e<U+017F>caped, did make them laugh heartily at the extream feares in which he was, when
the Corporall denyed him pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and at his ha<U+017F>te which he made when he was once
out of the Ca<U+017F>tle.</p>
                     <p>Thus they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed on the way as plea<U+017F>antly as per<U+017F>ons in <U+017F>uch conditions po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could;
and being <U+017F>tirring betimes in the morning, they went over the great Mountaines of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes;</hi>
&amp; afterwards through the gloomy wood, called <hi>Black-wood,</hi> and came very late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

as unto tho<U+017F>e who thinking to avoid an ambu<U+017F>h, doe leave their right way to fall
into it. For the Captain who had <hi>Arimant</hi> in Guard<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> hearing that he was e<U+017F>caped,
took with him <U+017F>even or eight of his men, and re<U+017F>olved to pur<U+017F>ue him, or at the wor<U+017F>t, to

that Country men, and knowing the <U+017F>horte<U+017F>t wayes they got before them, and that
night came into the very <U+017F>ame Inn where <hi>Arimant</hi> and his company were to lodge:
<hi>Bellaris</hi> was alwayes wont to goe a little before and provide lodging and coming into
this Inn, the Captain knew him pre<U+017F>ently, and thought <hi>Arimant</hi> not farre of; he a<U+017F><U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

an<U+017F>wered, yes; Well then, <U+017F>aid he in a loud voyce, I will go and fetch my Ma<U+017F>ter: The
Captain who was in the next Chamber and ready to <U+017F>eize upon him, hearing this, would
not di<U+017F>cover him<U+017F>elfe, becau<U+017F>e he would catch them both together; but wary <hi>Bellaris,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning

can, for the Captaine is in the Inn. <hi>Arimant</hi> was extreamly <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at this; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering
what a <U+017F>hort time he had to con<U+017F>ult upon the matter, he thought it be<U+017F>t that
<hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> and <hi>Clarina</hi> <U+017F>hould go unto the Inn with the guard and invent <U+017F>ome tale or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to excu<U+017F>e their journey, and the next morning they <U+017F>hould take the way to
<hi>Vienna,</hi> and to know which way they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tick a little branch in the way
they took, when they met with <U+017F>everall paths; and tho<U+017F>e who came fir<U+017F>t to <hi>Vienna,</hi>
<U+017F>hould lodge in an Inn next the bridge on the other <U+017F>ide of the River <hi>Ro<U+017F>ne,</hi> and there <U+017F>tay
for the re<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>The, would have <U+017F>aid more, but they thought they heard Hor<U+017F>es trampling in the

to <hi>Vienna</hi> betimes, where they lodged in the Inne next the Bridge: At night asking newes

                        <hi>Arimant</hi> hearing this Proclamation, was in extreame feare le<U+017F>t <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> <U+017F>hould be
known as <U+017F>he entred into the Town, e<U+017F>pecially when the Ho<U+017F>t continued his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and
told him, that the King had <U+017F>ent per<U+017F>ons who knows her, unto all Bridges, and advenues
of Towns. This cau<U+017F>ed him to take <hi>Bellaris</hi> apart, and command him to provide mens
habit both for <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> and <hi>Clarina</hi> in all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>te; and as <U+017F>oon as they were ready,
to carry them that way they were to come, that they might <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they entred into the Town. <hi>Bellaris</hi> did as he was appointed, and all being ready
he went to meet them. In the mean time <hi>Arimant</hi> furni<U+017F>hed him<U+017F>elfe with better Cloaths,
then tho<U+017F>e he had from <hi>Bellaris.</hi> But fortune who was minded to vex the<U+017F>e two generous
Lovers yet a little longer, and to have greater te<U+017F>timonies of their love and courage, did
<U+017F>o contrive the matter, that at the very <U+017F>ame time <hi>Bellaris</hi> met <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide;</hi> and when <U+017F>he
thanked the Gods for <hi>Arimants</hi> <U+017F>afe arrivall unto <hi>Vienna,</hi> the King <hi>Gondebunt</hi> being hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Hart, he rode clo<U+017F>e by her, onely with five or <U+017F>ix who followed him: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
he ob<U+017F>erved that as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he <U+017F>pyed him, <U+017F>he retired her <U+017F>elfe behinde the next
bu<U+017F>h which <U+017F>tood a little out of the way, he followed her onely out of curio<U+017F>ity: But
<hi>Bellaris</hi> knowing him at the very fir<U+017F>t, he clapped him<U+017F>elfe flat down upon the ground in
a valley, which <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> could not doe, nor <hi>Clarina</hi> neither, becau<U+017F>e they were on hor<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back;
<U+017F>o as the King overtaking her, and <U+017F>eeing her in the Gauli<U+017F>h mode, he thought at
the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ome of that Country, who becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would be retired, went out
of the high way: but asking her who <U+017F>he was, and whither <U+017F>he went, as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
her mouth, he knew her; for though <U+017F>he had the language of <hi>Gaul</hi> very good, yet
<U+017F>he had the accent and tone of a <U+017F>tranger. And looking a little neerly upon her, though
<U+017F>he endeavoured to hide her face all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could; Oh Heavens, <U+017F>aid he, it is
<hi>Cry<U+017F>eide:</hi> Then lighting from his Hor<U+017F>e, he ran to embrace her; How long is it, faire
Ladie, <U+017F>aid he unto her, <U+017F>ince you fir<U+017F>t took this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e? What good Angel is it that

them? Poor <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> more amazed then is imaginable, to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elfe in the power of
him whom <U+017F>he mo<U+017F>t feared, and falne from <U+017F>uch a height of happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, into <U+017F>uch a gulph
of mi<U+017F>ery, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood a while and could not an<U+017F>wer: At the la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing there
was no way to conceal her <U+017F>elfe, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to take heart, and mo<U+017F>t couragiou<U+017F>ly an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thus; You ask me, Sir, when I a<U+017F><U+017F>umed this habit and di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e? and I an<U+017F>wer, ever
<U+017F>ince Love did command me: And becau<U+017F>e you call that good Angell who got me
out of your hands, a Devill, I mu<U+017F>t vindicate his honour, and let you know, Sir, that it is
unworthy in <U+017F>o great a King, to break both the Lawes of Humanity, and the Lawes of
Chivalry, which commands you to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t, relieve, and honour Ladies; and not to take
them Pri<U+017F>oners, and keep them again<U+017F>t their wills. The King hearing the freene<U+017F><U+017F>e of
<hi>Cry<U+017F>eides</hi> language, and his love not letting him con<U+017F>ent unto what he knew was the duty
of a Cavalier, he an<U+017F>wered her; Before any <U+017F>hould doe you any wrong, Madam, I will
lo<U+017F>e both my Crown and my life; and in this which I do, I intend it for your good and
advantage, and not to harme or wrong you in the lea<U+017F>t degree. She would have reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but the King was <U+017F>o over-joyed at this happy encounter, and not willing to enter any
further into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, he took her Hor<U+017F>e by the bridle, and led him into the high-way,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53527:88"/>
where taking his own Hor<U+017F>e, he returned to <hi>Lyons</hi> pre<U+017F>ently, more contented with this prize,
then with all his Victories. When <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> was thus taken, <hi>Clarina</hi> could ea<U+017F>ily have
<U+017F>aved her <U+017F>elfe, if <U+017F>he would as well as the Guid; but having no mind to leave her, <U+017F>he did
follow her voluntarily. Thus was the <U+017F>ad <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> carryed back to <hi>Lyons,</hi> and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
the re<U+017F>t of the Ladies Pri<U+017F>oners, but under a more carefull Guard then before; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the King did really intend to marry her, as well for her beauty, as for her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
to <hi>Rithimers</hi> wife, <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter unto the Emperour <hi>Anthemius<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                        </hi> and commanded that <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hould be waited upon with all <U+017F>ervice and civility: and his joyes that he had met with
her were <U+017F>uch, as he cau<U+017F>ed Bonfires and great Fea<U+017F>ts of rejoycing to be made. In the
mean time, <hi>Bellaris</hi> having e<U+017F>caped through Ru<U+017F>hes and Bogges, he came in a pittifull
fright, to bring this <U+017F>aid Newes unto his Ma<U+017F>ter, who was <U+017F>o much <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and <U+017F>orrow, that he was not able to <U+017F>peak one word; but throwing him<U+017F>elfe upon his
bed, there he lay till night, and <U+017F>ay what <hi>Bellaris</hi> could by way of con<U+017F>olation, he would
not an<U+017F>wer him: Afterwards, he went into bed, and would not eat nor <U+017F>leep all the
night; In the morning he called for <hi>Bellaris,</hi> bad him go unto <hi>Lyons,</hi> and enquire how
<hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> did, and how they u<U+017F>ed her: This faithfull <U+017F>ervant, though with much danger
to him<U+017F>elfe, did as he was commanded; when he came into the Town, he found no
great need of any enquiry; for <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> was the talk all the Town over, and the Kings
favours were <U+017F>uch, as it was generally believed he would marry her<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> though <U+017F>he was much
again<U+017F>t it, for <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons which yet were unknown unto them. But <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o great a
difficulty to <U+017F>peak unto her, he returned to his Ma<U+017F>ter, with a re<U+017F>olution of per<U+017F>wading
him to retire into <hi>Italy,</hi> <U+017F>ince it was now not likely<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but <U+017F>he who was courted and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by <U+017F>o great a King; Ambition to be Queen, would quench all her love to <hi>Arimant:</hi>
Being returned then unto <hi>Vienna,</hi> he related unto him all he heard, afterwards did
<U+017F>et before his eyes the levity of Women, their Ambition; the gilded flattery of being
Queen, and the great probability that <U+017F>he would entertaine the honour which the King
did her. He would advi<U+017F>e him, not to bu<U+017F>ie him<U+017F>elfe any more in the matter, but to
con<U+017F>ider how his Father would grieve for his lo<U+017F><U+017F>e: How it might be the cau<U+017F>e of his
death, and the utter ruine of his hou<U+017F>e; That to <U+017F>tay any longer here would not be <U+017F>afe,
becau<U+017F>e their Guid might di<U+017F>cover him, and cau<U+017F>e him to be taken: And that for the<U+017F>e
rea<U+017F>ons, and con<U+017F>iderations, and many others, it was requi<U+017F>ite he <U+017F>hould with all <U+017F>peed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to his hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Arimant</hi> did heare <hi>Bellaris</hi> all this while, though his mind was quite
another way. But when he had done; <hi>Bellaris,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he, I <U+017F>hall perhaps follow thy
coun<U+017F>ell, after thou ha<U+017F>t done one thing yet more for me: Go againe pre<U+017F>ently to <hi>Lyons,</hi>
give this little Book unto <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> procure me an an<U+017F>wer, and then thou <U+017F>halt <U+017F>ee what I
will doe. This <U+017F>ervant infinitely loving his Ma<U+017F>ter, did a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him he would doe it, el<U+017F>e
lo<U+017F>e his life; but entreated him that he would not grieve <U+017F>o exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively; to remember that
his virtue is able to <U+017F>urmount the greate<U+017F>t misfortunes; that he ought to hope <U+017F>till, and
not to <U+017F>ink under his <U+017F>orrows. And <hi>Arimant</hi> promi<U+017F>ing he would take his coun<U+017F>ell, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi>

when it was dark, and took up the mo<U+017F>t private lodging he could chu<U+017F>e. There he
heard the continuation of the <U+017F>ame reports, and more; That the next morning the King
intended to offer a <U+017F>acrifice upon the Tombe of the two Lovers, in hopes that they would
mediate for him unto the Great <hi>Tautates,</hi> to change the heart of <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> and move her

                     <p>
                        <hi>Arimant</hi> was very glad of this newes, and thought it a fit opportunity to effectuate his
de<U+017F>igne, therefore he prepared him<U+017F>elfe again<U+017F>t the next morning. In the interim, the King
<U+017F>olicited her with all manner of Court<U+017F>hip, and u<U+017F>ed all his Rhetorick to per<U+017F>wade her
unto compliance with him: But <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood as con<U+017F>tant and firme to her re<U+017F>olution as any
Rock again<U+017F>t the waves of the Sea, which cannot be moved. And this was the rea<U+017F>on why,
before he had recour<U+017F>e unto force, he would <U+017F>eek the favour of <hi>Tharamis,</hi> and by <U+017F>acrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
obtaine from him <U+017F>o much grace, as to change the heart of this generous Maid. When
he entreated her to be pre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>he willingly con<U+017F>ented: For, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her <U+017F>elfe, if the
God <hi>Tharamis</hi> be a ju<U+017F>t God, he will move the minde of this King, to de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t from
any inju<U+017F>tice.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, when it was time to go unto the Sacrifice, he prepared for her a mo<U+017F>t
glorious Chariot, and con<U+017F>trained her to weare the Royall Crown, cau<U+017F>ing all the re<U+017F>t of
her Companions to wait upon her in great <U+017F>tate, as if <U+017F>he were already the <hi>Burgundian</hi>
Queen; thinking to <U+017F>hake her con<U+017F>tancy with <U+017F>uch Grandures and Pomp: <U+017F>he appeared

but for all that, the inward di<U+017F>gu<U+017F>t of her <U+017F>oule appeared in her face, and all her actions.
The King was <U+017F>o much plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee her in this deck, as he did imagine her already his
wife. Thus they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed through the Town, and came to the Monument of the two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,

the Prie<U+017F>ts approaching as neare as they could to the Tomb, they commanded the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims
to be killed; when they were opened, and their intralls <U+017F>earched, they were found
to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and told <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> that it was an evidence the Gods were well plea<U+017F>ed with their alliance.
She, who till then, had <U+017F>ome hopes in the ju<U+017F>tice of this unknown God; and now <U+017F>eeing

                     <p>The King who was confident in the Reports of the Prie<U+017F>ts, she was very glad <U+017F>he had
<U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>ire, thinking that the <U+017F>ight would make her more inclinable unto him, when <U+017F>he

of the<U+017F>e two Lovers, was a <U+017F>anctuary unto all tho<U+017F>e who laid hold upon it, and

that being a<U+017F>tranger, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o much as know or thinke of it. But <U+017F>eeing it <U+017F>o, he

of the Sanctuary he dur<U+017F>t not; both out of fear of the Gods, and tumult of the

thinking the forces which he had about him, would keep the people within compa<U+017F><U+017F>e;

                     <p>In this re<U+017F>olution he advanced, thinking him<U+017F>elfe to go unto her; and <U+017F>he <U+017F>eeing him

<U+017F>pectator, and feared le<U+017F>t <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> <U+017F>hould be driven to the extremity, had not pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed

and proclamed unto him, who <U+017F>hall tell you who it was which helped this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Lady to e<U+017F>cape your Guards. Stranger (<U+017F>aid the King) I never will break any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
that I made: declare therefore the man, that I may puni<U+017F>h him; then ask what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
thou wilt, and obtain it. Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Arimant</hi> then, and ro<U+017F>e up, The man is in your
pre<U+017F>ence, and you may puni<U+017F>h him when you plea<U+017F>e, for it is my <U+017F>elfe. This, replyed the
King, is in<U+017F>olence in the height; and how dur<U+017F>t thou pre<U+017F>ent thy <U+017F>elfe before my face?
Onely in hopes, Sir, <U+017F>aid he, of the favour which I <U+017F>hall aske: Never think, Sir, that
it <U+017F>hall be my life, or the le<U+017F><U+017F>ening of any puni<U+017F>hment upon my <U+017F>elfe, which I <U+017F>hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
but that in ob<U+017F>ervance of your promi<U+017F>e unto which you obliged your <U+017F>elfe by the
great God whom you adore, by the glorious memory of your Father's <U+017F>oul, and by the
Maje<U+017F>tie of your Crown, you would grant me another favour which I <U+017F>hall aske. The
King <U+017F>tood amazed at the re<U+017F>olution of this man, and going back a pace or two: Stranger,
<U+017F>aid he unto him, certainly thou art out of thy wits, otherwi<U+017F>e thou would<U+017F>t never <U+017F>peak
thus; but how wert thou the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Cry<U+017F>eides</hi> e<U+017F>cape? Sir, replyed he, my name is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimant;</hi>
and I am the happy Cavalier whom this faire one <U+017F>ayes, <U+017F>he loves: I was taken
Pri<U+017F>oner when <U+017F>he was; I was carryed Pri<U+017F>oner to the Town of <hi>Gergovia,</hi> where I found
meanes to let her heare from me: She who thought me dead, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he heard I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
<U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to e<U+017F>cape and come unto the place where I was, and help me out, which
<U+017F>he did accordingly, and was the cau<U+017F>e of my liberty. You <U+017F>ee, Sir, how I was the cau<U+017F>e of her
e<U+017F>cape, and having declared it unto you, you are obliged to grant me the favour which
you have promi<U+017F>ed. The King, who was on the one <U+017F>ide a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at his re<U+017F>olution, and
on the other <U+017F>ide offended with him, as thinking him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>leighted by this <U+017F>tranger<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Yes,

to <U+017F>uffer the puni<U+017F>hment of my ju<U+017F>t indignation. Sir, replyed <hi>Arimant,</hi> I never expected
le<U+017F><U+017F>e from <U+017F>o great a king as you are: and therefore I doe freely put my <U+017F>elfe into your

the favour which I <U+017F>hall aske. Ask it then (<U+017F>aid the King) and by all the oathes which
I formerly took, I do oblige my <U+017F>elfe to grant it. Sir, replyed <hi>Arimant,</hi> then I doe aske
that <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> whom I <U+017F>ee at the corner of the Tombe, and who is your Pri<U+017F>oner,
may be <U+017F>et at liberty, and <U+017F>ent unto her friends, or whither <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e, without any

inflamed with anger, and a<U+017F>hamed to be accu<U+017F>ed before all the people of breach of
faith and promi<U+017F>e; he re<U+017F>olved to maintain it, but withall, to <U+017F>atisfie and vent his anger
upon <hi>Arimant.</hi> And therefore with eyes inflamed with fury; I do declare, <U+017F>aid he, that
<hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> is at liberty; and I do <U+017F>trictly charge upon pain of my great di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, that none
who<U+017F>oever, doe offer her the le<U+017F>t violence or injury: vowing by the <U+017F>oul of my Father, that
he <U+017F>hall never obtain either favour or pardon from me: Then turning towards <hi>Arimant,</hi>
Well <U+017F>tranger (<U+017F>aid he) art thou contented with me? Yes <U+017F>ir, an<U+017F>wered he, the mo<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

this <U+017F>turdy contemner of my anger, and let him <U+017F>uffer torment till he die, that other ra<U+017F>h
men like him, may by his example learne to dread my anger. <hi>Arimant</hi> looked up with a
cheerful a<U+017F>pect, and ob<U+017F>erving <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> to weep: Oh Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto her, I be<U+017F>eech
you let not your teares di<U+017F>turbe the tranquillity of my <U+017F>oul: Alas, my life could never be
better imployed then in procuring your liberty: Liberty? <U+017F>aid <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> I value not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

in the flower of your age: But go <hi>Arimant,</hi> and if I have my liberty, I will not be long
after you; I will make it appeare, that I can die as well to follow you, as you can to
<U+017F>ave my honour.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was talking thus, and <hi>Arimant</hi> conjuring her to live as long as it <U+017F>hould plea<U+017F>e
the Gods to prolong her dayes, they had fini<U+017F>hed the tying of his armes with chaines.
The people were all <U+017F>o moved at the con<U+017F>tancy of the Cavalier at the compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eide,</hi>

<U+017F>o did the Captaine who was come to acquaint him, that he was e<U+017F>caped. And <U+017F>eeing that

whom you have ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e to be angry, and <U+017F>everely to puni<U+017F>h: for indeed he is in
all the fault, and you cannot in rea<U+017F>on accu<U+017F>e this poore Cavalier of any crime; though
it is true, he was a cau<U+017F>e of her e<U+017F>cape, becau<U+017F>e he did not contribute any thing toward it,
farther than that he lived and loved her: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that had he not been among<U+017F>t the

he ever give her any coun<U+017F>ell or advi<U+017F>e her to it? or did he ever take any paines or indu<U+017F>try
about it? No, no, Sir, not at all, further then to let her know he was alive. But on the
other <U+017F>ide, he whom I <U+017F>hall di<U+017F>cover unto you, is onely culpable; he fir<U+017F>t gave the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ell,

To be briefe, Sir, he did all; and by con<U+017F>equence de<U+017F>erves all the puni<U+017F>hment.</p>

according to your Royal word, you have granted me the favour which I <U+017F>hall ask. I doe

Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Bellaris,</hi> the favour which I ask is, That this Cavalier may be <U+017F>et at liberty, and
that all his fetters may be charged upon me; for it was I onely, that helped <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> to

that am the cau<U+017F>e of your high di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure. But now <U+017F>ince I have made good what I
have promi<U+017F>ed, it is your part, Oh great King, to make good yours and grant the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
which I asked: I was from my infancy brought up in the hou<U+017F>e of this Noble Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,
I do owe unto him all that I am; I have been a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his affection unto <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eide,</hi>
from the very fir<U+017F>t beginning of it; and I have <U+017F>een <U+017F>o much virtue and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
of minde between them, that I thinke the end of my dayes mo<U+017F>t happy, if I can be a

my <U+017F>elfe culpable of ingratitude, if being able to <U+017F>ave the life and honour of him who gave
me life, and who by his example has taught me all things vertuous and honourable, I
did not freely doe it. And therefore, Great Sir, I de<U+017F>ire you will ab<U+017F>olve <hi>Arimant</hi> from all
kind of puni<U+017F>hment, and not onely <U+017F>et him at liberty, as you have already <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide;</hi> but
al<U+017F>o, that you would be plea<U+017F>ed, out of your incomparable magnanimity, to make them
marry each other, as they are already by the con<U+017F>ent both of them<U+017F>elves and their Parents.
Let all your anger which you aimed at him, be imployed, good Sir, again<U+017F>t me, and adde
as many torments as you will, <U+017F>o they be <U+017F>afe; for the very Glory of doing what I ought
to doe, will make them all <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet unto me, as I <U+017F>hall not re<U+017F>ent the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the
paine.</p>
                     <p>And becau<U+017F>e, Sir, I hear that the valiant <hi>Bellimart</hi> pretends to have <U+017F>ome right unto my
Ma<U+017F>ter, becau<U+017F>e he was formerly his Pri<U+017F>oner. Give me leave to contradict his preten<U+017F>ion
in the pre<U+017F>ence of your Maje<U+017F>tie. Fir<U+017F>t, What can he pretend unto my Ma<U+017F>ter, but onely
this, that my Ma<U+017F>ter gave him<U+017F>elfe unto him? When you took the Towne of <hi>Cartures,</hi>
Oh great King, <hi>Bellimart</hi> knowes very well how much he is beholding unto this valiant
Cavalier, for his life; I will not repeat it, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould blemi<U+017F>h <U+017F>uch a generous courage
as that of <hi>Bellimart:</hi> But I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay (and he knowes I <U+017F>ay truly) that it was not
he who took my my Ma<U+017F>ter; But my ma<U+017F>ter after he had done <hi>Bellimart</hi> a very notable
piece of <U+017F>ervice, did entreat him to take him as his Pri<U+017F>oner, upon condition to u<U+017F>e him

                        </gap>ality: whether this make my Ma<U+017F>ter a Pri<U+017F>oner of War,
or a Pri<U+017F>oner of Courte<U+017F>ie, I refer it unto the judgement of your Maje<U+017F>tie. But to wave
this, and admit him his Pri<U+017F>oner; what is it he would now have? If he was his Pri<U+017F>oner
then, why did he not keep him? Did he let him go upon his Parole? No, Sir, he guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him as well as he could, and he could not keep him. Now if a Pri<U+017F>oner doe e<U+017F>cape,
and he who had him, do meet him in another Province, can he take him again? No, <U+017F>ir,
this concerns the grandure of your Maje<U+017F>tie. I doe not <U+017F>ay, but that if <hi>Bellimart</hi> had kept
him <U+017F>till his Pri<U+017F>oner within your Dominions, he might now have had <U+017F>ome Law to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

e<U+017F>caped as for <U+017F>afety into your Dominions; and <U+017F>o much the rather, becau<U+017F>e your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je<U+017F>tie
having made a peace with all the poor people of <hi>Ci<U+017F>alpine Gaul,</hi> there is no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that all tho<U+017F>e who fly hither for refuge, <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>eized upon as Enemies. This, Sir,
is the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervice I am like to doe for this noble Cavalier, unto whom I doe owe much
more then I am able to pay.</p>
                     <p>Thus the faithful <hi>Bellaris</hi> ended his <U+017F>peech, which contained in it <U+017F>o much affection
and rea<U+017F>on, that the King could not chu<U+017F>e but admire the love of <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> the Genero<U+017F>ity
of <hi>Arimant,</hi> and the fidelity of <hi>Bellaris;</hi> in <U+017F>o much as he <U+017F>tood amazed at them along
while, and began to relent; At la<U+017F>t he broke out into the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions: Great are the
Judgements of <hi>Tautates,</hi> and his wayes are <U+017F>o deep, that no mortal man can find the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.
I made choice of this <U+017F>acrifice, in hopes of per<U+017F>wading <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> to love me; and on
the contrary, <U+017F>he flyes to the priviledge of the Tomb of the two Lovers, I publi<U+017F>hed a
Declaration, thinking by promi<U+017F>es to regain lo<U+017F>t <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> and that Declaration is it
which hath ravi<U+017F>hed her from me, and made me quite lo<U+017F>e her even when <U+017F>he was in my
own hands; and all this to <U+017F>hew that all humane wi<U+017F>dome is but folly, compared to the
infinite wi<U+017F>dome of that great God whom we adore. And though I do <U+017F>ee all the<U+017F>e things
do conduce unto the confu<U+017F>ion of all my de<U+017F>igns, and plainly fore<U+017F>ee that there is no hopes
for me in the fair <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide:</hi> yet mu<U+017F>t I needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that all things have been alleadged
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53527:91"/>
upon <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ound rea<U+017F>on<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> as I prote<U+017F>t that had I known the beginning and progre<U+017F><U+017F>e of this
great and vertuous affection, I would <U+017F>ooner have dyed then <U+017F>uffered it to be <U+017F>eparated.
And therefore, oh you happy couple of Lovers, I doe declare you free, and exempt from
all manner of puni<U+017F>hment or impri<U+017F>onment, be it either in relation to me or unto <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mart,</hi>
upon tho<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly urged by that faithful <U+017F>ervant, who<U+017F>e offence I doe
al<U+017F>o mo<U+017F>t freely remit, wi<U+017F>hing rather <U+017F>uch a friend and <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ervant, then <U+017F>uch another
Kingdome as I have; I do give you all three free power and liberty to live in any part of
my Dominions or el<U+017F>e to go whither you plea<U+017F>e; yet if you will afford me <U+017F>o much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
as to <U+017F>ee you married before you depart, I <U+017F>hall think both my Kingdom and my
<U+017F>elf much honoured and very happy in it.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, he commanded that <hi>Arimant</hi> <U+017F>hould be unloo<U+017F>ed, who with the generous
Lady and faithfull Servant, came and ca<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves at his feet upon their knees, <U+017F>ome
ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing his hands, others his knees, and all the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly did commend the Magnanimity
and ju<U+017F>tice of the King, who by the grandure of his courage, knew <U+017F>o well how to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>h
him<U+017F>elf.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Florice</hi> ended the relation of the fortunes of the<U+017F>e two perfect Lovers, every one
admiring their virtues; <U+017F>ome did highly e<U+017F>teeme <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> for refu<U+017F>ing the Scepter and
Crown of <hi>Rithimer</hi> and <hi>Gondebunt,</hi> to pre<U+017F>erve her fidelity unto <hi>Arimant:</hi> Others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
the re<U+017F>olution of <hi>Arimant,</hi> in offering <U+017F>o voluntarily to die for the liberty of <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eide,</hi>
but all with one commune con<U+017F>ent commended the fidelity and affection of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris.
Hylas</hi> onely laughed at all three, and at all tho<U+017F>e who did commend their actions.
Was ever the like folly <U+017F>een? <U+017F>aid he. <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> like a fool as <U+017F>he was might have beene a
Queen, and now <U+017F>he is onely a <U+017F>illy Country wench; <hi>Arimant</hi> al<U+017F>o, like a fond ob<U+017F>tinate
Coxcombe in his court<U+017F>hip of <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> mu<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>e his time, be wounded, taken Pri<U+017F>oner,
and after abundance of perill and trouble, be at la<U+017F>t like to lo<U+017F>e his life in di<U+017F>grace, and
had done <U+017F>o if <hi>Gondebunt</hi> had not been more courteous in performing his promi<U+017F>e, then
he was wi<U+017F>e in putting him to it: Had it not been better for both parties if <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi>
had been a Queen, and afterwards given <hi>Arimant</hi> that <U+017F>atisfaction he de<U+017F>ired? But <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi>
all their perplexities and mi<U+017F>eries do proceed from that which you call Con<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
It is that onely which tormented them <U+017F>o pittifully; onely that, which had like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have co<U+017F>t them their lives, and made them the <U+017F>port of fortune and chance. <hi>Silvander</hi>
hearing him<U+017F>elfe named, came neerer <hi>Hylas,</hi> and an<U+017F>wered him thus; All the<U+017F>e things
which you have named, <hi>Hylas,</hi> are indeed the con<U+017F>equents of con<U+017F>tancy which you doe
<U+017F>o much condemn; aud how much they are accompanied with paines and dangers, <U+017F>o
much more are they to be e<U+017F>teemed: they are onely generous <U+017F>pirits that dare attempt
difficulties to accompli<U+017F>h their de<U+017F>igns: They are but <U+017F>imple <U+017F>oirits, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> who run
after a <U+017F>hadow and leave the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance: <hi>Arimant</hi> is tyed to a thing called Con<U+017F>tancy very
finely; he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>pend all his youth in the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> and when he is old, then <U+017F>he
will give her <U+017F>elf unto him, this is as much as to give a hard bone to knaw upon unto a
Dogge that has no teeth: Had not this Cavalier done better if he had <U+017F>tayed in <hi>Eporedes,</hi>
and comforted his poor old Father who loved him, than to break his heart with griefe,
or at lea<U+017F>t made his old age <U+017F>o full of <U+017F>orrows and misfortunes, as death was welcome
to him: And then for <hi>Arimants</hi> own proper contentment doe you thinke there was no
women in all the Town but <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide?</hi> Ah my friend <hi>Silvander,</hi> what gro<U+017F><U+017F>e folly is it
to lo<U+017F>e ones time, and <U+017F>pend all one has upon one Commodity? had he followed my
Lawes, when he met with <U+017F>o many difficulties oppo<U+017F>ing his de<U+017F>ires he would have wi<U+017F>ely
turned his back upon them, and have made his addre<U+017F>ses unto <U+017F>ome other who<U+017F>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t
would have been more ea<U+017F>ie, and perhaps more advantageous: Every one did laugh
at the opinion of <hi>Hylas;</hi> and <hi>Tircis</hi> began then to <U+017F>peak; I perceive, <hi>Hylas,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he)
that you are one who will never build any Temple unto Fortune, becau<U+017F>e you will not
have any thing to doe with her. And I perceive (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that you are one whom
onely tho<U+017F>e that are old and ugly will adore. And why? <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis:</hi> Becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Hylas,</hi> tho<U+017F>e who are old &amp; il-favoured, to invite any to love and <U+017F>erve them, do propo<U+017F>e
you as a God: You, I <U+017F>ay, who are <U+017F>o far out of your <U+017F>en<U+017F>es as to love one that is dead.
This, <hi>Hylas,</hi> replyed <hi>Tircis,</hi> is inhumane, to repre<U+017F>ent unto the afflicted the cau<U+017F>e of their
griefe; but be it <U+017F>o, that I <U+017F>hould be e<U+017F>teemed by the<U+017F>e old ones of whom you <U+017F>peak, and
propo<U+017F>ed as a God, what hurt is it unto me? Is it not better, my friend, to be thought
a God, then to be held for an uncon<U+017F>tant man? And <hi>Hylas,</hi> are not Altars and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53527:92"/>
plea<U+017F>ing unto the Gods, whom we adore? and why then <U+017F>hould they not be <U+017F>o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men? Do you think, <hi>Tircis,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> that I have not as many Altars and
Sacrifices as you? certainly I have; for I can make my <U+017F>elf more adoreable then you can:
This onely is the difference, you are the God of the old and ugly, and I the God of the
young and faire: And therefore the <U+017F>acrifices which are offered unto you are old and
wrinkled, and mine are young and plump: Unto your Altar comes none but ancient
Matrons, crawling upon Crutches, and crooked, their heads and hands <U+017F>haking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;
but unto mine comes none but the faire<U+017F>t, younge<U+017F>t, and jollie<U+017F>t wenches in all the
Country; <U+017F>o as I am then the God of Plea<U+017F>ure, of Joy and of Life; and you the God of
Envie, Sorrow, and Death. Now tell me, <hi>Tircis,</hi> without p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sacrifices doe you think more agreeable and e<U+017F>timable? <hi>Tircis</hi> would have an<U+017F>wered,
when the venerable <hi>Cry<U+017F>ante</hi> being adverti<U+017F>ed, that <hi>Adamas</hi> with his company would
pa<U+017F><U+017F>e by very near her hou<U+017F>e; <U+017F>he came through the wood which joyned to the Meadow

the Druid advanced to <U+017F>alute her, and calling <hi>Alexis,</hi> pre<U+017F>ented her as his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The venerable <hi>Cry<U+017F>ante,</hi> ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed and embraced her with abundance of joy and <U+017F>o did

which, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, does mo<U+017F>t trouble me; for I perceive <U+017F>he will come unto me <U+017F>ooner then
<U+017F>he thought, by rea<U+017F>on of this new accident which happened: What Accident? <U+017F>aid
<hi>Adamas:</hi> I thought, replyed the venerable <hi>Cry<U+017F>ante,</hi> that you had been acquainted with
it. You mu<U+017F>t know, <hi>Arganteus</hi> was killed in the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Galathea</hi> and <hi>Polemas,</hi> by
a Cavalier <U+017F>tranger, and in the conclu<U+017F>ion of the combate one of the Lyons which guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the inchanted Fountain, <U+017F>eeking about for food, came upon the place, and <U+017F>o affrighted
the Hor<U+017F>es of <hi>Galatheas</hi> Coach, as they ran away, over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc><<U+25CA>></desc>
                        </gap> the Coach, and broke is
all in pieces; So as <U+017F>he, who by fortune was on foot, to <U+017F>ee the Combate and part them,
was forced to walk on foot unto Mount <hi>Verdune,</hi> where <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayes, expecting her Coach,
and the recovery of the Cavalier who killed <hi>Arganteus,</hi> and I believe is there <U+017F>till. Whil<U+017F>t
they were thus talking, they were interrupted by the coming of young <hi>Lerindas, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea's</hi>
me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, who addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elfe unto the <U+017F>age Druid; Father, <U+017F>aid he, The
Nimph <hi>Galathea</hi> has <U+017F>ent me unto you, to let you know that <U+017F>he intends to be pre<U+017F>ent at
the <U+017F>acrifice which you intend to offer for the Mis<U+017F>letoe; and fearing <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould come
too late, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires you to <U+017F>tay a little, and <U+017F>end her word in what place you will
offer it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adamas</hi> hearing this me<U+017F><U+017F>age, was a little <U+017F>urprized at it, becau<U+017F>e remembring that
<hi>Galathea</hi> had formerly <U+017F>een <hi>Celadon</hi> in womans Clothes, and therefore he feared <U+017F>he would
know him now in the habit of a Druid: Yet not to give any notice of his feare, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
him thus: Friend, I de<U+017F>ire thee to tell the Nimph, that I <U+017F>hould be very willing
to obey her commands, but the time is <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort now, as I am afraid I <U+017F>hall not: For I
know <U+017F>he would not have the <U+017F>ervice of <hi>Tautates</hi> retarded: all things being in readine<U+017F><U+017F>e,
and the <U+017F>hepherds and <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es a<U+017F><U+017F>embled upon the place, <U+017F>o as it is indeed impo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
to defer until another time, without great di<U+017F>order and <U+017F>candall; but if <U+017F>he have a

two or three dayes unto Mount <hi>Verdune:</hi> for I believe <U+017F>he would be at the <U+017F>acrifice, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee them altogether: I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you Father (<U+017F>aid the young <hi>Lerindas</hi>)
you have divined aright; For I have heard her <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires nothing more, then
to <U+017F>ee whether the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon</hi> be as faire as they are reported: I thought as
much, replyed <hi>Adamas;</hi> For this Sacrifice which now we are about, is but a private
<U+017F>acrifice of a few, and not worthy of her pre<U+017F>ence; but the great Day of Solemnity is the
<U+017F>ixth day of <hi>July,</hi> when I <U+017F>hall be happy in her pre<U+017F>ence, if <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>e to honour us <U+017F>o far:
Tell her therefore, <hi>Lerindas,</hi> that the <U+017F>hortne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the time, and the little <U+017F>olemnity
which is now to be u<U+017F>ed, is not enough to invite her hither, and that I know the<U+017F>e faire
<U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es will make good my promi<U+017F>e. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, Father, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> none of us

tell me whom you thinke it doth mo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>emble? It does re<U+017F>emble, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t
<U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e in the world: Then, replyed <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you are not of the opinion of us
all; for the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me, and I thinke they are <U+017F>omething in the right, that
this face doth much re<U+017F>emble mine. Mo<U+017F>t certaine, replyed <hi>Alexis.</hi> For the Picture does
extreamly re<U+017F>emble you; and yet that doth not at all hinder, but that you are the faire<U+017F>t
<U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e in the world. I receive this commendations, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> from <hi>Alexis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
I de<U+017F>ire to be the more plea<U+017F>ing unto her, and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he being no <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e but a
Druid, I doe not any injurie unto her in accepting of it. Though I were a <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> yet you ought to accept it, <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o much your due: And though
you refu<U+017F>e it out of exce<U+017F>s of mode<U+017F>ty, yet rea<U+017F>on will force you unto it by the judgement
of all. But faire<U+017F>t <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, let us talk no more of that which cannot be denyed by
any, and let us <U+017F>ee, I be<U+017F>eech you, what is upon this Altar, which I think have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
unto you by the <hi>Pans</hi> and <hi>Egypans</hi> of this Country, under the name of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e
<hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> The <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F>s hearing <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>he thought that <U+017F>he heard the very voice of
<hi>Celadon,</hi> as he was wont to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e unto her; and <U+017F>he was infinitely joyed at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emblance,
as <U+017F>he could not hide her joyes from her companions. And at the <U+017F>ame time
when they came unto the Altar, <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> came al<U+017F>o having <hi>Daphnis</hi> with them,
who being a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at what her Companions <U+017F>aid concerning that place, went along
with them, looking upon all the rarities in it: and by fortune, <hi>Diana</hi> laying her hand
upon one of the little Roles of Paper, of which there were many upon the Altar: <U+017F>he
opened it, and found certaine Ver<U+017F>es in it, and <U+017F>hewed them unto <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi>
Methinks Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her, that I <U+017F>hould know this hand: It is <hi>Celadons,</hi> an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Phillis,</hi> and I cannot chu<U+017F>e but be ravi<U+017F>hed with wonder at what I <U+017F>ee in this place.
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> blu<U+017F>hed at the name of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> much more, who to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e it the
better, did ask who this <hi>Celadon</hi> was, of whom they <U+017F>poke; He was, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> one of
the mo<U+017F>t courteous <U+017F>hepherds in all this Country, and by unhappy misfortune was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
In what place? <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis:</hi> It was, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> in the fatal River of <hi>Lignon:</hi>
but, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, let us talk upon <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>ubject, and look upon the<U+017F>e other Roles; Then
taking one which was in the hands of <hi>Daphnis,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>ome Ver<U+017F>es which were written
in another Character: for they were written by the Nimph <hi>Leonide,</hi> when not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to per<U+017F>wade <hi>Celadon</hi> to for<U+017F>ake the melancholly life he led in that place, <U+017F>he did vi<U+017F>it
him almo<U+017F>t every day; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he could not conceal her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate affection to him,
<U+017F>he writ tho<U+017F>e Ver<U+017F>es as a te<U+017F>timony of it: When <hi>Phillis</hi> heard the name of <hi>Celadon,</hi>
certainly, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, this is the place of wonders, for there is no que<U+017F>tion but every thing
in it relates unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> and yet we all know that he is dead. How do you know that,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis:</hi> Nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> it is but too true, for I <U+017F>aw him die, and <U+017F>ince have <U+017F>eene
his Gho<U+017F>t, but I be<U+017F>eech you let us leave off this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e: and then offering to go away,
<hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>tayed her, and looked in another Paper which was written in the <U+017F>ame Characters
the fir<U+017F>t was, and contained the<U+017F>e words:</p>

who heard this new way of loving, could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh, and were <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to
<U+017F>ee the conditions, as they every one began to look for <U+017F>ome Paper, and a piece being
found, <hi>Hylas</hi> him<U+017F>elfe would needs be the Secretary; But <hi>Stella</hi> <U+017F>aid, that it was more
rea<U+017F>on it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>he, becau<U+017F>e it was <U+017F>he that fir<U+017F>t made the Propo<U+017F>ition. At la<U+017F>t, after
a long di<U+017F>pute, <hi>Hylas</hi> agreed that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould dictate unto him, and both parties <U+017F>hould
con<U+017F>ent unto every Article: But <U+017F>till <hi>Stella</hi> feared that <hi>Hylas</hi> would not <U+017F>et down accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to her Dictates, and <hi>Hylas</hi> feared the like of her, <U+017F>o as they dur<U+017F>t not tru<U+017F>t each
other.</p>
                     <p>This di<U+017F>pute could not be without abundance of delight to the company; and becau<U+017F>e

might do very well to be the Secretary unto them both. I <U+017F>hould willingly undertake the
office, fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) if that true and perfect affection which I beare unto
<hi>Diana,</hi> could <U+017F>uffer my hand to write things <U+017F>o contrary to the fidelity and purity of my
love; and truly I had rather die, than any <U+017F>uch conditions <U+017F>hould ever be <U+017F>een under the
hand of <hi>Silvander.</hi> Nay, nay, <U+017F>crupulous Lover, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> never trouble your <U+017F>elfe for
an excu<U+017F>e, I will <U+017F>ave you the labour of it; For the true love which is to be betwixt this
<U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e and me, cannot endure that any one of <U+017F>o different an humour, <U+017F>hould
ever be Secretary unto our Ordinances. <hi>Corilas</hi> who heard all this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee <hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Stella</hi> linked together <U+017F>ince never two was more like.
<hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, Pray put the office upon me, and I promi<U+017F>e to write ju<U+017F>t as it is agreed

object to the contrary: I <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander</hi> that though I was pre<U+017F>ent, yet I would
not be a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, and in rea<U+017F>on I ought not to be con<U+017F>trained unto it. For is not the

except again<U+017F>t your judgement. Though I mu<U+017F>t not be your judge, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander,</hi> yet I
may be your Accu<U+017F>er, which I cannot be if I am a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e. And as for the ingratitude of

publi<U+017F>h that which I de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>hould be concealed; and I <U+017F>hould take the very concealment

after in jea<U+017F>t, but at la<U+017F>t it grew to be in good earne<U+017F>t: For <hi>Stella</hi> was a very fine and

as living together in great freedom, they did by little and little, conceive <U+017F>uch affection
the one to the other, as they met not with any that plea<U+017F>ed them better.</p>
                     <p>But Dinner being ready, and the Table <U+017F>pred under a <U+017F>hady Tree, as near the Fountain
as the conveniency of the place would permit, all the company <U+017F>at down. The Vaices,
Bardes, Sarronides, Eubages, and Druids, did <U+017F>it at a Table by them<U+017F>elves, where they
did eat what was their due of the <U+017F>acrifice; But <hi>Adamas,</hi> to render the more honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> did dine with them, and the be<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es and
<U+017F>hepherds. As long as dinner la<U+017F>ted, the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e was all upon the Rarities of the place,

and remembring the judgement which <hi>Diana</hi> was to give 'twixt <hi>Silvander</hi> &amp; <hi>Phillis,</hi>
he thought both the time and the occa<U+017F>ion very fit for that purpo<U+017F>e; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
<hi>Daphnide</hi> who <U+017F>tayed in the Country onely to be acquainted with the <U+017F>weet lives of
the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es and <U+017F>hepherds, would be very glad to hear this difference argued and
what judgement <hi>Diana</hi> would give upon it. He went unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
acquainted them with his de<U+017F>ign, he de<U+017F>ired them to joyn with him in obtaining
<hi>Dianas</hi> con<U+017F>ent unto it. Believe it, Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> there will not need much <U+017F>olici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
for I know that <U+017F>he has deferred it <U+017F>o long, onely becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he wanted the pre<U+017F>ence
of the Nymph <hi>Leonide,</hi> who <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was at the beginning of that conte<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he thought it
fit <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be al<U+017F>o at the end of it. I feare, if <hi>Silvander</hi> know of your intention, he will
break off company. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who thought the Druids Propo<U+017F>ition very rea<U+017F>onable, and
be<U+017F>ides was weary in imploying any time, but in the entertainment of her dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

you; for I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elfe, he <U+017F>peaks nothing unto my advantage. <hi>Silvander</hi> was he who

quickly be at an end, and my <U+017F>upream fellcity begin: For, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed

upon the merits of <hi>Silvanders</hi> <U+017F>ervice and mine. <hi>Diana</hi> was a little <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at
this; for though it was her intention to give judgement ere long, yet <U+017F>he did fore<U+017F>ee
that after it, <U+017F>he could not allow any longer of <hi>Silvanders</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of love unto her.
But the <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>hepherd was much greater; for he <U+017F>aw there was no po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of
delaying it any longer, and then the fiction of his wager, which was the cloak for his,
reall affection would be taken from him, and he <U+017F>hould be no longer permitted to make
his amorous addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto his adored <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e. The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations made them both

you cannot deny unto my <U+017F>ervices: or perhaps you are afraid of lo<U+017F>ing that <U+017F>hepherd,
and unwilling to be exempt from his importunities. Then <hi>Diana,</hi> left <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould let her
di<U+017F>content appear, did <U+017F>mile, and an<U+017F>wer thus; I know not what glory you can pretend

your own, <U+017F>ince both do proceed from the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e. <hi>Silvander</hi> kneeled down, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
thanked <hi>Diana</hi> for that favourable an<U+017F>wer. Afterwards, ri<U+017F>ing up, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid he

unto her, This <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e not knowing how to love, and finding that the longer <U+017F>he
continues, the more defects <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hew in her affection; <U+017F>he would not be put to any
further Te<U+017F>t of it, but de<U+017F>ires an end of that which <U+017F>he cannot prolong any longer. For,
<hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, and turned towards her, why el<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould you <U+017F>peak thus unto our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e?
Your <U+017F>ervices wherewith you upbraid her, are <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall that the reward of them
mu<U+017F>t needs be accordingly; and her feares which you mention of lo<U+017F>ing me mu<U+017F>t needs be

<hi>Phillis,</hi> does all faint-hearted Souldiers fly all occa<U+017F>ions of any danger: but I on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
dare look the grimme<U+017F>t dangers boldly in the face, and give te<U+017F>timony of my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
Why good <hi>Silvander,</hi> do you <U+017F>hrink like a coward from the hazard of that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is to be the touch-<U+017F>tone of our merits? And what other excu<U+017F>es than tho<U+017F>e I
have named, can <hi>Diana</hi> have for her retarding it any longer? I am afraid, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
that your ru<U+017F>tick di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e will be trouble<U+017F>ome to the a<U+017F><U+017F>embly, e<U+017F>pecially unto the

will think Country pa<U+017F>times very tedious; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Diana</hi> would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

<U+017F>uit their minds unto the humble innocency of your lives: and therefore I did make
this Propo<U+017F>ition, to the end that by your judgement, this new <U+017F>hepherd and fair <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>e

therefore the time cannot be better imployed, then to heare the difference betweene <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi>
and <hi>Phillis</hi> argued and judged. I know, reverend Father, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can proceed from you but what is grounded upon great rea<U+017F>on, and we are all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
unto what<U+017F>oever you <U+017F>hall command; and therefore without more adoe, I will doe
what<U+017F>oever you <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e; onely I be<U+017F>eech <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> to look upon the <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of our trifles with a favourable eye, and attribute them unto that obedience which
we are all obliged to render both unto you and them. Fair <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F>s (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>)
all that I have hitherto <U+017F>een among<U+017F>t you, has filled me with <U+017F>o much contentment
and admiration, that you need not doubt but all your pa<U+017F>times will be very plea<U+017F>ing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and one higher then the re<U+017F>t for <hi>Diana,</hi> again<U+017F>t the back of a Tree, who<U+017F>e branches doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>hade
the Circle. And when all were placed according to his de<U+017F>ire, he cau<U+017F>ed three
Garlands to be made of Flowers, and put one upon the head of <hi>Diana<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                        </hi> another upon the
head of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and the third upon the head of <hi>Silvander;</hi> Afterwards taking <hi>Diana</hi> by

                        </gap> of Judgement; before her, a little on the right hand, he
placed <hi>Phillis,</hi> and a little on the left hand, <hi>Silvander;</hi> and after <U+017F>ilence de<U+017F>ired, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Leonide</hi> to make known unto the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers, the beginning of the di<U+017F>pute betwixt
<hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> to the end they might better judge of the difference: thinking it fit

<hi>Leonide,</hi> who little thought of being more then an Auditor in this a<U+017F><U+017F>embly, was a little
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elfe an Orator; but in obedience to the Druid <U+017F>he undertook it, and
after <U+017F>he had a little recollected her memory, <U+017F>he turned towards <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and began
thus.</p>

did not love any, was not as <hi>Phillis</hi> had alleadged: And <hi>Diana</hi> being a <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F>s both
of beauty and and judgement, fit to judge of his merit, <U+017F>he was propo<U+017F>ed to be as it were
his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, and he was to court her under that Notion, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e he wanted the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to undertake it<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Upon this he began to <U+017F>erve her, and court her as clo<U+017F>e as if he had
been really in love: <hi>Phillis</hi> was not exempt from the <U+017F>ame task, <U+017F>he was al<U+017F>o condemned
to love and <U+017F>erve <hi>Diana</hi> with all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion that <U+017F>hepherds u<U+017F>e unto tho<U+017F>e whom they doe
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately love; and at the end of three moneths <hi>Diana</hi> was to judge which of them
two knew be<U+017F>t how to love. Ever <U+017F>ince, there has been <U+017F>uch an emulation betwixt this
<U+017F>hepherd and that <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that they have neglected no manner of behaviour or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion
which could manife<U+017F>t a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervent and real affection: And though the prefixed
term of three moneths be expired, during which time they were to demon<U+017F>trate their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
unto <hi>Diana;</hi> yet their addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto her has continued longer becau<U+017F>e it was thought

the judgement which <hi>Diana</hi> was to give; <U+017F>o as it <U+017F>eems the heavens did prolong it untill

affaires, to live in this <U+017F>weet and harmle<U+017F>s tranquillity. Infinitely happy you are in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pects:
happy are you in this Country of <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts;</hi> happy in being obeyed and loved
as a great Druid; but much more happy in being <U+017F>o near a Neighbour unto the plea<U+017F>ant

you <U+017F>ay, and do profe<U+017F>s, that I would not change my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e with the greate<U+017F>t Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
upon earth; having nothing to pray for from the Great <hi>Tautates,</hi> but onely that it
may continue for many yeares. As for the commends you are plea<U+017F>ed to be<U+017F>tow upon our
<U+017F>hepherds and <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, I am a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that they will not receive them without blu<U+017F>hes,

as you have heard the cau<U+017F>e of their court<U+017F>hip, will it plea<U+017F>e you to hear their judgement?
With much contentment, <U+017F>aid <hi>Daphnide;</hi> Then the Druid turning towards <hi>Phillis,</hi> It was

thou be <U+017F>o arrogant and ra<U+017F>h, as dare to love her? But as this is high impudence; yet
methinks that to pretend unto her love againe, is much more extream. But <hi>Silvander,</hi>
what colour can<U+017F>t thou have for this thy fond preten<U+017F>ion? what <U+017F>hould make thee think
of obtaining her love before me? Thou can<U+017F>t not deny, but every thing is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to love its like; and I being a woman, as our Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s is, certainly <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t needs
naturally love me more then thee. But be<U+017F>ides this; what will cau<U+017F>e love <U+017F>ooner then
long acquaintance and continuall conver<U+017F>e? By it, perfections come to be better known;

of Nature, who was plea<U+017F>ed to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h it <U+017F>o: And he is <U+017F>o far from being blameable
for failing in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e, as he is to be much e<U+017F>teemed, that can arrive at <U+017F>o high a point

                                 <p>Why then, injurious <hi>Phillis,</hi> to fortifie your weak preten<U+017F>ions, <U+017F>hould you without any

but Natures, who gave me no greater capacity, if I do not love her to the height of her
merit: but I cannot complain, <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>ame law is common unto all mortals, none being
able to doe it more then my <U+017F>elfe: But wi<U+017F>e nature would have it <U+017F>o, and perhaps pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely
to manife<U+017F>t the high beauty of <hi>Diana,</hi> who con<U+017F>traines me to love her, an Act far

you propo<U+017F>e to be in them who love.</p>
                                 <p>Then <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, were you not jealous of <hi>Dianas</hi> Glory, you would not blame me
for loving her, nor tax me with arrogance, <U+017F>ince it is the force of her beauty which
con<U+017F>traines me, and <U+017F>ince by this, the grandure of her perfections are more evidently
<U+017F>een. Aks me no more, I be<U+017F>eech you, how I dur<U+017F>t love her: for though I doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

me: If you object, that this does not prove her love unto me, but onely my love unto
her. I an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, That the love which her beauty produceth in me, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eparable

that I cannot live without this <U+017F>oul which gives me life, than it is, that I cannot live

                                 <p>If you reply, That though this <U+017F>hould be granted, yet it does not follow that this <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>e

Noble company you told her, that I did pre<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>elfe before her in raptures of love:
and <U+017F>urely the te<U+017F>timony of an enemy, when it is to our advantage, is much more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
then the te<U+017F>timony of per<U+017F>ons indifferent. So as, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e, you cannot

                                 <p>But <hi>Phillis,</hi> what <U+017F>hallow argument did you u<U+017F>e in having recour<U+017F>e unto tho<U+017F>e favours
which Nature hath be<U+017F>towed upon you? <U+017F>imply alledging that you being a woman,
therefore <U+017F>he ought to love you before a <U+017F>hepherd, thinking that by this quality you have
the advantage of me. But let me tell you, that it is more naturall for a woman to love a
man, then a woman. And if you will but look into the Lawes of Nature, you will find
that it is <U+017F>o among<U+017F>t all Animalls: Does not the Hen follow the Cock <U+017F>ooner then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hen: Will not the widdowed Turtle lament her lo<U+017F><U+017F>e? Does not all femalls of all
kindes the like? you know this, <hi>Phillis,</hi> as well as I doe; or if you do not, common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
will teach you: Nay, things even in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, doe ob<U+017F>erve the <U+017F>ame law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
The Palme, will it thrive, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e by another Palme? Will the femall Myrtle live
without the male? Therefore, <hi>Phillis,</hi> It is not by the lawes of Nature, that <hi>Diana</hi>
mu<U+017F>t love you more then me; for if <U+017F>he follow them, they will turne her eyes from any
thoughts of you. But if you will have it <U+017F>o, I am content, <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould love
you as a woman, <U+017F>o you will al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>ent <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould love me as a man, and her mo<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
<U+017F>ervant. You cannot be again<U+017F>t this, for as certainly as you are a woman, <U+017F>o cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
am I her <U+017F>ervant: nor is it more naturall for one woman to love another woman,
then it is for every one to love what<U+017F>oever loves them: This is the way for us both to
obtaine what we aske: But I <U+017F>ee now, that you will alter your opinion, and without any
further recour<U+017F>e unto this naturall amity, which cannot be advantageous to you, you
will fly unto <U+017F>uch advantages as proceed from election. You conceive <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t
love you better than me, becau<U+017F>e of your more intimate conver<U+017F>e together, which you
<U+017F>ay does beget a neerer and more mutual affection. But <hi>Phillis,</hi> you may be much mi<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
for by the very <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on you may perhaps as well me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as well as good qualities: And let me tell you, that being perpetually together,
does oft break off amity as well as augment it: little <U+017F>eparations makes love more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent,
continuall pre<U+017F>ence is apt to cloy.</p>
                                 <p>I would not urge this point <U+017F>o farre, Oh my enemy, did I thinke you could make

the advantage which you get by your intimate conver<U+017F>ation, does more hurt then
help you; And indeed your Allegation has much more malice in it then matter, and
all things rightly con<U+017F>idered, I think my <U+017F>elfe more happy in my conver<U+017F>ation with her,
then you can be in yours; for your <U+017F>tay with her is onely in the day, and that al<U+017F>o
you imploy much of it out of her pre<U+017F>ence, either in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of your hou<U+017F>e and
flock, or other diver<U+017F>ions which <U+017F>teal you from her, <U+017F>o as you dedicate the lea<U+017F>t of the
day unto my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: whereas I on the contrary, what day did ever dawne,
which I <U+017F>pent not wholly in her company? When was the night I was not with her, as
long as decency would permit me? Could ever any diver<U+017F>ion draw me from her?
And when any unwilling accident did keep me away, did I not continually think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, and in my heart adore her? Can you <U+017F>ay, <hi>Phillis,</hi> that you are more with her
then I? Fie, fie, <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, never think it, but know, that <U+017F>he is not more with her
<U+017F>elfe then I am: for <U+017F>he is <U+017F>ometimes diverted from her <U+017F>elfe by the pre<U+017F>ence of other

<U+017F>ometimes by cro<U+017F>s accidents, whereas I am continually with her as <hi>Prometheus</hi> upon

is not more natural for the body to die, as <U+017F>oon as the <U+017F>oul is <U+017F>eparated from it, then it
is for me to die, if I be but one minute <U+017F>eparated from my <U+017F>weet thoughts of her.</p>
                                 <p>I <U+017F>ee very well, <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, how you laugh to heare me <U+017F>ay that I am continually
with my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, thinking that it being onely in thought, I am a man much plea<U+017F>ed
with my own imagination. But <hi>Phillis,</hi> what would you have me doe? I mu<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e
that if I could be alwayes pre<U+017F>ent with her both in thought and body, I <U+017F>hould be
more contented: but how ever let me tell you, that as I am, I am more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
with her then you are, <U+017F>ince when you are pre<U+017F>ent with her, your thoughts of her
are farre off, retaining nothing with her but your body which is the inferiour part,
whereas my heart is with her, though my body be di<U+017F>tant: If you doe object that the<U+017F>e
imaginary thoughts are not at all <U+017F>erviceable unto her, becau<U+017F>e they are meer fancies,
I mu<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer you, <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that it is in thought onely that we adore the

and adore <hi>Diana</hi> upon the earth, as all the world does adore the great <hi>Tautates</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
which is in heart and thought.</p>
                                 <p>You <U+017F>ee therefore, <hi>Phillis,</hi> how this rea<U+017F>on argues more for me then you. And as to
that advantage which you <U+017F>ay your <U+017F>ex hath over mine, I an<U+017F>wer thus; That I doe

come nearer the divine and immortal Intelligences: I do believe that women may well
be ranked among<U+017F>t them, and they doe <U+017F>o much excell us in perfections, as it is a kinde
of wrong to reckon them among<U+017F>t men: we may with rea<U+017F>on e<U+017F>teem them the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
betwixt Angels and us, <U+017F>ince we find by experience, that all the good thoughts
which men have, do take their beginning from them. It is at them they aim, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
them<U+017F>elves in them; and que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F><U+017F>e it is by them that we come unto tho<U+017F>e
pure thoughts; And God hath placed them on earth to draw us unto heaven: For
my part, I do believe it, and will maintaine it unto the end of my life. But this does
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53527:101"/>
not at all argue you, Oh <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, to be the better loved by my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: but rather
will produce contrary effects.</p>
                                 <p>I told you before, that when one has done all that nature has given him power to
doe, and hath rai<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elfe unto that height to which naturally he may ri<U+017F>e, it is
highly to be e<U+017F>teemed. And I <U+017F>ay again, that who<U+017F>oever does le<U+017F><U+017F>e then naturally he
may doe, is much to blame, e<U+017F>pecially when the thing is in it <U+017F>elfe laudable, and he
through naturall impui<U+017F><U+017F>ance leaves it undone. Now, <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, does not this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
much condemn you, who being born a woman, of a <U+017F>ex <U+017F>o perfect as you hold a
medium betwixt the Angels and us; and yet to love <U+017F>o imperfectly as you do, e<U+017F>pecially a
<U+017F>ubject <U+017F>o full of perfection? I am mo<U+017F>t confident, that <hi>Diana</hi> did never out of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e con<U+017F>ider my extream affection, without e<U+017F>teeming it, nor look upon the
<U+017F>hallowne<U+017F><U+017F>e of your Amity without condemning it<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> For when <U+017F>he found mine <U+017F>o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<U+017F>o pure, <U+017F>o entire, and <U+017F>o exempt from all exceptions, <U+017F>he could doe no le<U+017F><U+017F>e then
highly commend it, that <U+017F>uch a perfect love <U+017F>hould be found in <U+017F>o imperfect a <U+017F>ex as
the ma<U+017F>culine. And on the contrary, <U+017F>he is a<U+017F>hamed that <U+017F>o many faults and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<U+017F>hould be found in you and your <U+017F>ex, which is by nature <U+017F>o much above
ours.</p>
                                 <p>But Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, let us examine her other rea<U+017F>ons, whereby <U+017F>he argues me <U+017F>o guilty in
matter of love. She <U+017F>ays, that all my demon<U+017F>trations of love are onely fictions, di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>ements,
and di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations; and <U+017F>he thinks <U+017F>he has proved this Calummy very well,
when <U+017F>he <U+017F>ayes that I began to love you onely upon the wager, and did not love you
before. But I be<U+017F>eech you, my fair and ju<U+017F>t judge, take notice of the evill con<U+017F>equen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which <U+017F>he drawes from the<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>itions: I doe confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, <hi>Phillis,</hi> That the
wager did move me fir<U+017F>t to love <hi>Diana,</hi> and that this wager did give beginning unto my
affection: But mu<U+017F>t it from hence be concluded, that my love is only di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation; or
that becau<U+017F>e I never loved any before, therefore I do not love <hi>Diana</hi> now? The<U+017F>e, <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
are ab<U+017F>urd conclu<U+017F>ions. If one do run for a wager, and win it, can it be thought
he did run for it in je<U+017F>t, and not in good earne<U+017F>t? Tell me no more my enemy, that my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions and raptures are but di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ements, fictions, and di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations: For it is
true, I did love upon that wager, but it is more true that my affection is mo<U+017F>t real: And I
am not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ure I am <hi>Silvander,</hi> as that I am the mo<U+017F>t real <U+017F>ervant of the fair <hi>Diana.</hi> What
a <U+017F>illy <U+017F>yllogi<U+017F>m is it to <U+017F>ay, that becau<U+017F>e I did not once love <hi>Diana,</hi> therefore I doe not
love her now? If <U+017F>uch a conclu<U+017F>ion may be drawn, then one may <U+017F>ay, that becau<U+017F>e <hi>Phillis</hi>
was not in the world forty years <U+017F>ince, therefore <U+017F>he is not in it now. Had you <U+017F>aid, it
was not long <U+017F>ince this love began, you had <U+017F>aid truly, and I would have confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed it
with you, with <U+017F>orrow that it was no <U+017F>ooner: But to prove that I doe not love, becau<U+017F>e
the time was when I did not know her, is as much as if you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, that he who is not
born to day, will never be born.</p>
                                 <p>Now Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, be plea<U+017F>ed to ob<U+017F>erve, how <U+017F>he does contradict her <U+017F>elfe; But it is not
<U+017F>trange, for it is the property of lying and calumny to be in <U+017F>everall tales, whereas
truth is alwayes in one and the <U+017F>ame. But admit, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that your beauty did
a little move him, and by this meanes, he is in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort become yours: Is it po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible,
<hi>Phillis,</hi> you <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o long conver<U+017F>ant with the fair <hi>Diana,</hi> and know her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
no better? Doe you think it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to love her but a little? Oh ignorant
<hi>Phillis</hi> in the force of her beauty, not one dart flyes from her faire eye, which does not
reach the heart and wound it mortally. You might well keep your littles for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
beauties, which when they have <U+017F>cratched the skin a little, do think they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a great te<U+017F>timony of their power; But as for <hi>Diana's</hi> beauty, it <U+017F>eems you have not
felt the blowes of it, <U+017F>ince you can talk <U+017F>o of a little. But know, Oh my enemy, that
a Remora which can <U+017F>tay a Ship under full <U+017F>ayle, has not halfe the force of her perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<hi>Diana's</hi> beauty takes not hearts by Littles, but by Alls; and he a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that the
Gordian knots are more ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, then tho<U+017F>e by which <U+017F>he fetters <U+017F>oules. That
fire which our Druids tell us mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ume all the Univer<U+017F>e, has le<U+017F><U+017F>er flames then
tho<U+017F>e of her fair eyes; <U+017F>ay not therefore, ignorant <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that one can love her
a little, or that one can be in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort hers: All tho<U+017F>e who love her, doe love her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly;
and all tho<U+017F>e who are hers, are hers entirely; <U+017F>o as when you grant that I doe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53527:101"/>
love her a little, you doe grant that I do love her infinitely, and by con<U+017F>equence that
nothing can equall the grandure of my affection Whereas you, <hi>Phillis,</hi> that can <U+017F>peak
<U+017F>o, doe thereby argue your <U+017F>elfe incapable of being moved, and is in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of that
which is able to kill others. But I be<U+017F>eech you, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ee what a fine peece of <U+017F>ophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>try
my enemy u<U+017F>es, to prove that I doe not love you, and to make you de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and judge whether <U+017F>he ever <U+017F>o much as heard of <U+017F>uch a thing as love? Is <U+017F>he
not very <U+017F>ubtile in accu<U+017F>ing me, for never loving any but you? and that you were the
fir<U+017F>t that ever fettered me: If this be a crime, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e I never heard of it before,
and mu<U+017F>t needs acknowledge my <U+017F>elfe culpable: for, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, you are not onely the
fir<U+017F>t, and onely one that ever I loved; but more, you mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be the la<U+017F>t, and onely one
that ever I will love: And if ever it be otherwi<U+017F>e, let the Sun cover me with eternal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e;
let the Earth which nouri<U+017F>heth me, <U+017F>wallow me alive as not worthy to live in
it; Let the Air become my poy<U+017F>on, and may all the elements become my enemies: and
wi<U+017F>e men are all mi<U+017F>taken in their Tenet, that what<U+017F>oever has a beginning mu<U+017F>t have an
end: For <hi>Phillis,</hi> this affection which you have <U+017F>eene begin, <U+017F>hall la<U+017F>t to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                                 <p>But <hi>Phillis,</hi> I admire you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, that if my affection de<U+017F>erve any reward, it is all
due unto you: You tell me that you were the cau<U+017F>e of it, and that all which does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from it, ought to be attributed unto you as the originall cau<U+017F>e. But <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
take heed, le<U+017F>t this being granted, it doe not turn to your di<U+017F>advantage; for tho<U+017F>e who
are the cau<U+017F>e of any evil, de<U+017F>erve puni<U+017F>hment: And as you <U+017F>ay, that my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s ought
rather to laugh, then love me; <U+017F>o it mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equently follow, that <U+017F>he ought to laugh
at you, and not at <hi>Silvander,</hi> becau<U+017F>e you attribute all unto your <U+017F>elfe.</p>

ought not to be laid unto his charge, if he be no other way culpable: but if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

en<U+017F>ue by it: this being granted, as needs it mu<U+017F>t, let us con<U+017F>ider before we either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
or condemne you, what your intention was when you propounded this wager.
We <U+017F>hall not be put unto much pain, Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, before we di<U+017F>cover it: for <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elfe
has told us: The fictions, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and the di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations once knowne will procure
him hatred: But <hi>Diana</hi> knowes, that all my Court<U+017F>hips, and amorous addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto
her, doe proceed onely from the wager which you made; and if all the con<U+017F>equents of it
be fictions and di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations, then you are the cau<U+017F>e of them. You may ob<U+017F>erve, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e,
how <U+017F>he thought that I would u<U+017F>e onely fictions and di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations in this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Now <U+017F>ince it is the Intention which makes the Action either good or bad, have I
not ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ay, It was you, Oh <hi>Phillis,</hi> who by your di<U+017F><U+017F>embling wager, gave
your <U+017F>elfe unto faire <hi>Diana,</hi> but it was my heart which did really give me unto her, by
the knowledge which it had of her perfections, and <U+017F>o by con<U+017F>equence all the puni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which <U+017F>uch di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations de<U+017F>erve, are due unto you; and all the favours which a

                                 <p>Wi<U+017F>h me no more to quit the pretended victory unto you, to <U+017F>hew my wit and my

reall love; and my Judgement, in acknowledging the advantage which you have over
me: For on the contrary, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hew my <U+017F>elf the verie<U+017F>t fool alive, if I did counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
a love unto her, who de<U+017F>erves to be perfectly loved above all the world: And I
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>hew but little judgement, if I did not <U+017F>ee the advantage which my true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
affection does give me over your faigned follies. I would have you, <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
recant all your reproaches, and be the fir<U+017F>t who <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay, That there is no affection, be
it never <U+017F>o ill begun, either by a wager, or pa<U+017F>time, but may prove in earne<U+017F>t, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
reall, as mine for an example.</p>
                                 <p>But, oh my enemy, all this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e is but aire, and I believe in vain; for we are
contending with one another for the victory, whil<U+017F>t who<U+017F>oever conquers, perhaps may
not be the couquerer<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I make no que<U+017F>tion, but if either of us doe obtaine the victory
which we pretend unto, that this Chaplet of Flowers at the feet of the faire <hi>Diana</hi>
                                    <pb n="206" facs="tcp:53527:102"/>
will be mine. But alas, <hi>Phillis,</hi> my great feare is, and with abundance of rea<U+017F>on, that it
will prove to be neither yours nor mine; for all our arguments which we have allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to merit her favour, may be valid as again<U+017F>t one another, but not at all in relation
to <hi>Diana: Diana,</hi> who<U+017F>e tran<U+017F>cendent perfections and merits is above all the power of
Nature, and therefore will not be <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient unto the lawes of Mortalls. And then,
when we <U+017F>ay, That love ought to be paid with love; and that long and faithfull lovers
are worthy of reward and acknowledgement; This is right, and good rea<U+017F>on, as to
men, and does oblige them to follow tho<U+017F>e precepts, but not at all, <hi>Diana</hi> For <U+017F>he is one
whom heaven has elevated above the degree of mortals, and is equall unto Angels. To
whom then <U+017F>hould I addre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elfe, unto what <U+017F>hould I have recour<U+017F>e? Shall I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F>s
my <U+017F>elfe unto Love, and have recour<U+017F>e unto Ju<U+017F>tice, by whom all things are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ballanced and recompenced? But alas, Love and Ju<U+017F>tice has nothing to doe with
<hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>he is above them all. Addre<U+017F>s then thy <U+017F>elfe <hi>Silvander,</hi> and have recour<U+017F>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her <U+017F>elfe; and waving all other powers and rea<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>ay thus unto her.</p>
                                 <p>Then he kneeled down before <hi>Diana,</hi> and holding up his hands, continued.</p>
                                 <p>Oh <hi>Diana,</hi> the onely honour of her Country, the glory of Men, and the Ornament
of the whole world: Be plea<U+017F>ed to look upon a <U+017F>hepherd here before you, who does
not onely love you, and offer at your feet his <U+017F>ervice and his life, but does even adore
you, and does <U+017F>acrifice his heart and his <U+017F>oul unto you in a mo<U+017F>t zealous and devout
manner. As Nature cannot make any thing which can equal you; <U+017F>o Love cannot kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<U+017F>o great a flame and perfect affection as can equall your merit. It hath plea<U+017F>ed the
great <hi>Tautates</hi> to advance you <U+017F>o high above all the re<U+017F>t of his works, as no extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of love, no <U+017F>incerity of devotion, can in any rea<U+017F>on hope for any grace or favour
from you, or that you conde<U+017F>cend <U+017F>o low, as to look at my complaints and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances:
I doe humbly acknowledge, that all human hearts, and all mortall <U+017F>ervices,
are mo<U+017F>t due unto you, and cannot be denyed you without a <U+017F>inne: But alas, we can
merit nothing, all we can do is to love<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>erve and adore you, and when all is done, we
cannot claim any reward, becau<U+017F>e all is but a ju<U+017F>t duty. Under the<U+017F>e Notions and
Qualifications, I now pre<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>elfe before you, as before a Deity, not daring to
aske any recompence for all my <U+017F>ervices, or my affection, for that were a demand too
arrogant, and above my hopes and de<U+017F>erts: but onely to be<U+017F>eech you, that you will
be a witne<U+017F><U+017F>e how none knowes better how to love than <hi>Silvander,</hi> nor any that de<U+017F>erves
to be more loved again.</p>

                     <p>Thus <hi>Silvander</hi> ended, and would not ri<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>till continued kneeling in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

unto the Druid: And taking up <hi>Silvanders</hi> Garland, <U+017F>he put it upon his head, and
gave him her hand to ki<U+017F>s as he kneeled; which he received with <U+017F>o much contentment
and joy, that the <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e was well a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, it was not a ki<U+017F><U+017F>e which proceeded
from any di<U+017F><U+017F>embled affection.</p>
                     <p>The heat of the day was much abated, when <hi>Diana</hi> gave her judgement; and <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
being de<U+017F>irous that <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Daphnide</hi> might <U+017F>ee the exerci<U+017F>es of the <U+017F>hepherds;
he aro<U+017F>e from his <U+017F>eat, which cau<U+017F>ed all the re<U+017F>t to doe the like, and <U+017F>o they parted;
And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> did di<U+017F>pute the matter among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, as que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tioning
unto whom <hi>Diana</hi> had given the advantage; and the Druid perceiving that the
di<U+017F>pute was not ea<U+017F>ily determined: he advi<U+017F>ed them to talk of it by the way, becau<U+017F>e it
would be a good diver<U+017F>ion to make the way <U+017F>eem <U+017F>horter. As <U+017F>oon as they were <U+017F>et for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<hi>Phillis</hi> began to fall upon the <U+017F>hepheard: Well, <hi>Silvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) what doe
you think of <hi>Dianas</hi> judgement? Shepherde<U+017F>s, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> I never hoped for
<U+017F>o much as our Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s hath given unto me: And I will maintaine, that never was
judgement pronounced with more equity nor wi<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, then this which <U+017F>he
hath given. Why <U+017F>hepherd? (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) doe you thinke that <hi>Diana</hi> has given you
any advantage above me? Who<U+017F>oever doubts it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> does either not
under<U+017F>tand her judgement, or has no judgement to under<U+017F>tand. For my part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
I doe not onely under<U+017F>tand it, but doe admire it; for I do very well under<U+017F>tand that
I have won the wager, and do admire it, becau<U+017F>e both parties are plea<U+017F>ed; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in other ca<U+017F>es, one party complains of inju<U+017F>tice. In this as in all her other actions,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silvander,</hi> the admirable wit of <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>hewes it <U+017F>elfe: and yet (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>)
It is I that am declared the more amiable; and it is I unto whom <hi>Dianas</hi> <U+017F>eat is
given, as unto her who be<U+017F>t de<U+017F>erves it; intimating thereby, that it is I unto whom
<hi>Silvander</hi> owes the <U+017F>ame duties, and honours which our Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s formerly received
from us. Oh <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvander</hi>) the my<U+017F>tery of this judgement is very deep,
and abundance of <U+017F>tudy is requi<U+017F>ite to under<U+017F>tand it: And if our faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
would be plea<U+017F>ed to con<U+017F>titute a Judge to declare her intention in it, I <U+017F>hould quickly
make it appear that her judgement is more in my advantage then yours: And if it
plea<U+017F>e her to heare us now, you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee that it is my part to thank her for the victory
which <U+017F>he has mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>tly judged on my <U+017F>ide. <hi>Silvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> then, There
is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of any further explanation, for I think I have declared my <U+017F>elfe <U+017F>o plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of it. But I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>ince now there is no wager betwixt
<hi>Phillis</hi> and you, and <U+017F>ince I am not now either your Judge or your Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, I pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that my name is <hi>Diana,</hi> and <U+017F>o let me be called. The<U+017F>e words were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>erious brow, that <hi>Silvander</hi> <U+017F>aw it was her will to have it <U+017F>o; yet <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to take it in another manner, he an<U+017F>wered thus<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I doe know very well, that you are
the faire <hi>Diana,</hi> whom <hi>Phillis</hi> and I have <U+017F>erved: I know al<U+017F>o, that you permitted me
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53527:103"/>
to take you for my Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, which I did; and doe you think I am of the humour
of <hi>Hylas?</hi> Pardon me I be<U+017F>eech you, if I hate incon<U+017F>tancy, and let me continue as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
for I cannot change; <hi>Hylas,</hi> who did not hate <hi>Silvander;</hi> but though they were
continually in conte<U+017F>t with one another, yet he thought him the mo<U+017F>t accompli<U+017F>hed <U+017F>hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
in all the Country. Methinks, fair <hi>Diana,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) that you are obliged by many
rea<U+017F>ons, to like this <U+017F>hepherds propo<U+017F>ition, which you cannot deny without offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
your own judgement. But if to ea<U+017F>e you of that labour, you will let me declare
what your intention is in your judgement, I <U+017F>hould have quickly condemned <hi>Silvander.</hi>
I perceive, <hi>Hylas,</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana</hi> and <U+017F>miled) That you would be as good a judge
unto them, as you are a Coun<U+017F>ellor unto me<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> No, no, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I will not admit of
any partial Judge, and <hi>Silvander</hi> has the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on; But if it plea<U+017F>e the Reverend
<hi>Adamas</hi> to undertake it, let him ordain and compo<U+017F>e the matter. No, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi>
there is no rea<U+017F>on that any <U+017F>hould be judge but <hi>Diana</hi> her <U+017F>elfe; but if you plea<U+017F>e to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
what you thinke conducing to your advantage, we <U+017F>hall all give our advice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her. Then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I doe wonder <hi>Silvander,</hi> you <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o prejudicated with
the love of your <U+017F>elfe, as not to <U+017F>ee a thing which is as clear as the Sun: I am confident
that none here but thinks you to be a man of rea<U+017F>on, and that you doe this onely to
<U+017F>hew the <U+017F>ubtilty of your wit: Could ever any <U+017F>peak more plainly then <hi>Diana</hi> did?
I doe declare, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that <hi>Phillis</hi> is more amiable then <hi>Silvander,</hi> and the better to
clear her intention, <U+017F>he added the honour of <U+017F>etting me in her own <U+017F>eat, to <U+017F>hew that
there was as great a difference betwixt you and me, as there is between you and <hi>Diana,</hi>
and that in this regard you <U+017F>hould behave your <U+017F>elfe unto me with the <U+017F>ame re<U+017F>pect and
honour: Could <U+017F>he doe more to <U+017F>hew my victory? or declare it in more expre<U+017F>s words?
on the contrary, in <U+017F>aying that thou knowe<U+017F>t better how to make your <U+017F>elfe loved then
I doe; this was as much as if <U+017F>he Irad <U+017F>aid, that you are <U+017F>uller of <U+017F>ubtilty and art then
I am, and <U+017F>o far I confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it; but what<U+017F>oever is amiable in it <U+017F>elfe, needs no art or
<U+017F>ubtilty to make it <U+017F>elfe loved. Although <U+017F>he did give you a Garland of Flowers, and
cau<U+017F>ed me to re<U+017F>tore mine unto him who gave it unto me; yet this was onely to <U+017F>hew,
that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw nothing amiable in you<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but <U+017F>uch things as re<U+017F>emble flowers which grow
and die in a day. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought my merits more <U+017F>olid and durable, <U+017F>he
would not emblem them by things <U+017F>o fadeable: And to the end you might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
know it, not being willing any thing <U+017F>hould pa<U+017F><U+017F>e without recompence; con<U+017F>ider
<hi>Silvander,</hi> what it is which <U+017F>he gave you: and what it is which I receive in recompence
of my <U+017F>ervice: <U+017F>he permitted you to ki<U+017F>s her hand, which is a gratification u<U+017F>ed unto
<U+017F>laves, and <U+017F>uch as are in little e<U+017F>teem; but unto me <U+017F>he <U+017F>urrendred her place, to <U+017F>hew
<U+017F>he thought none more worthy then my <U+017F>elfe, and to intimate unto you, that <U+017F>he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
it your duty to doe me the <U+017F>ame honour which you did unto her. Boa<U+017F>t then,
<hi>Silvander,</hi> of the advantage which you pretend to receive by the this judgement: Keep
well in memory the great victory which you have this day obtained: Go unto the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the good Godde<U+017F>s, and there let it be Chronicled in the Annalls, that future ages
may al<U+017F>o know it. After this, <hi>Phillis</hi> was <U+017F>ilent: and when <hi>Silvander</hi> would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered,
<hi>Hylas</hi> prevented him, <U+017F>aying; If I were to give my opinion, I <U+017F>hould declare
<hi>Phillis</hi> victorious. <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, you give your judgement with
too much precipitation; for you condemn a man before he be heard; <hi>Silvander</hi> has not
yet <U+017F>poke for him<U+017F>elfe: 'Tis true, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but all's one, for I know he cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer
any thing to the purpo<U+017F>e. Every one began to laugh at the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Hylas;</hi>
and when they were all <U+017F>ilent, <hi>Silvander</hi> began to an<U+017F>wer thus.</p>

                                 <p>I Have learn'd in the Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilian Schools, that <hi>Prometheus</hi> had <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ubtle wit, as
he mounted up to heaven, and from thence <U+017F>tole that Fire from the Gods where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he did animate the Statue which he made; and that for a puni<U+017F>hment of his
Theft, he was ty'd to a Rock, where an Eagle did continually feed upon his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Shall not I run the <U+017F>ame Fortune, if in declaring the intentions of the fair <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>teal from her that <U+017F>ecret which <U+017F>he would re<U+017F>erve unto her <U+017F>elf; for I
think the Theft not inferiour to that of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> nor that I <U+017F>in again<U+017F>t a le<U+017F>s Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
But on the other <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>hall I comply with the crime of <hi>Phillis,</hi> who to my di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
and again<U+017F>t all equity, and the good judgement of <hi>Diana,</hi> does attribute

ask that by way of gift, which thou may'<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>tly <U+017F>teal from her. It is unto you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
O faire<U+017F>t and divine Mi<U+017F>tris, that I addre<U+017F>s my Prayers; begging leave to declare
the equity of your judgement, and the truth of my Victory; Prote<U+017F>ting, that in this
action I will have a greater regard unto any thing which <U+017F>hall concern you, then unto
any thing that <U+017F>hall concern my <U+017F>elf. For the matter would not concern me <U+017F>o much,
though <hi>Phillis</hi> had the advantage of me, becau<U+017F>e notwith<U+017F>tanding I <U+017F>hould be no le<U+017F>s
your <U+017F>ervant then I am; but that <hi>Phillis</hi> by her <U+017F>ubtle glo<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>hould make it thought
that you are the Author of a judgement again<U+017F>t all manner of Rea<U+017F>on: This would
wound the honour of your Wit and Judgement. But in a confidence that your <U+017F>ilence
gives con<U+017F>ent, I will an<U+017F>wer <hi>Phillis</hi> thus.</p>
                                 <p>It <U+017F>eems Shepherde<U+017F>s that you have a mind to be twice overcome, and will make me
your <U+017F>uperiour by two Judgements; I <U+017F>ee you would have appealed from <hi>Dianas</hi>
Throne, unto another; and if our prudent <hi>Druide</hi> had not hindred you, perhaps this
injury had been done unto her: But it is no wonder, that <U+017F>he who does not know how
to love, <U+017F>hould be ignorant in the <U+017F>ecrets and ordinances of Love: yet to the end that
neither you, nor tho<U+017F>e who hear you, may not re<U+017F>t any longer in that error, hearken
Shepherde<U+017F>s unto this Truth, which I <U+017F>hall briefly declare unto you.</p>
                                 <p>That great God which is in the highe<U+017F>t heavens, and who with one <U+017F>ingle look doth
behold, not only all things which the Sun doth <U+017F>hine upon, but al<U+017F>o all the <U+017F>ecrets
that are hidden in the Intrals of the Earth, and deepe<U+017F>t Aby<U+017F>s of Waters; he was
plea<U+017F>ed to give this priviledge unto man, that he only can know and under<U+017F>tand his
mind; and for his further help, he did not endue him with this knowledge, to conceal
it from all, but to communicate and participate this knowledge unto others: And that
he might do it the more intelligibly, he gave unto him two ways whereby he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
him<U+017F>elf; which is, by Speech, and by Actions: And by the<U+017F>e two every one may
di<U+017F>cover their intentions, and make them more intelligible unto one another: And
therefore when our Actions are Ambiguous, we add Speech, to make them the more
plain: And when our Speech is ob<U+017F>cure and dubious, we do interpret them by our
Actions. And the great <hi>Tautates</hi> was plea<U+017F>ed to order it thus, to the end that tho<U+017F>e
deluding <U+017F>pirits which take delight in deceiving all tho<U+017F>e they have conver<U+017F>e withal, may
be without excu<U+017F>e, when their decreitfulne<U+017F>s is di<U+017F>covered.</p>
                                 <p>Now the mo<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>e and ju<U+017F>t <hi>Diana,</hi> being willing to let us know what <U+017F>he

the<U+017F>e two ways whereby to expre<U+017F>s her <U+017F>elf. Fir<U+017F>t, She has declared her <U+017F>elf in clear
words; and to her words <U+017F>he has added actions, which demon<U+017F>tratively do <U+017F>peak her
mind: Yet <U+017F>ince the ignorance of <hi>Phillis</hi> is <U+017F>uch, and to leave none in any doubt of
the Truth, I am forced to go a little further, and to <U+017F>ay, That to di<U+017F>cover this Truth,
it is requi<U+017F>ite to <U+017F>ound it to the bottome, and to know who has got the victory by the
judgement of <hi>Diana;</hi> It is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to con<U+017F>ider the beginning of the Difference, which
cau<U+017F>ed our Wager.</p>

The Nymph <hi>Leonide</hi> did very faithfully relate the Truth, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, That three
months being expired, <hi>Diana</hi> was to judge whether <hi>Phillis</hi> or I did know better how to
make our <U+017F>elves Loved: For our wager was grounded upon the <U+017F>aying of <hi>Phillis,</hi> that
the rea<U+017F>on why I did not attempt to <U+017F>erve any of our Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es was, becau<U+017F>e I was
defective in <U+017F>uch things as might procure Love: And becau<U+017F>e I maintained that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rea<U+017F>on was want of will, both <hi>Phillis</hi> and I were ordered to <U+017F>erve the fair <hi>Diana</hi> three
months; and afterwards <U+017F>he was to judg, which of us two did know better how to make
our <U+017F>elves Loved. This being well under<U+017F>tood, I beleeve there is none here, who does
not plainly <U+017F>ee, that by the words of the fair <hi>Diana,</hi> I have obtained that which I did
pretend unto: Her words were the<U+017F>e, We do declare, that <hi>Sylvander</hi> does know how
to make him<U+017F>elf beloved better then <hi>Phillis:</hi> Could <U+017F>he expre<U+017F><U+017F>e her mind by any
words more intelligibly and cleerly? And yet to leave no <U+017F>cruple of any doubt, <U+017F>he has
added actions unto her words; and <U+017F>uch as none can con<U+017F>ider, but they mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ently
confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my victory. Her Actions were two, Fir<U+017F>t, putting the Crown upon my head,
<U+017F>econdly, giving me her hand to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e; both of them are favours <U+017F>o high, as hardly any
can be greater: For <hi>Phillis,</hi> Unto whom are Crowns given, but <U+017F>uch as overcome?
and unto whom do Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es u<U+017F>e to give their hands to ki<U+017F><U+017F>e, but unto tho<U+017F>e whom
they think worthy of their Loves? I cannot tell Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e what Country it is, where
the cu<U+017F>tome is to permit <U+017F>uch ki<U+017F><U+017F>es unto their <U+017F>laves, and <U+017F>uch as they little e<U+017F>teem:
but if they u<U+017F>e to confer <U+017F>uch favours upon tho<U+017F>e whom they di<U+017F>-e<U+017F>teem, what will they
do unto tho<U+017F>e who are high in their Favours? Believe me, O my enemy, that after
this rate, there are very few, who would not be very glad my Faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e would
de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e them, and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, I would be contented to live and die in <U+017F>uch di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>teem.
And as to what you <U+017F>ay, That our judge in giving me a Garland of Flowers,
does intimate thereby, that what<U+017F>oever is amiable in me, is like tho<U+017F>e flowers, which
grow and die in a day: I be<U+017F>eech you con<U+017F>ider what <U+017F>he has added unto tho<U+017F>e flowers,
as if <U+017F>he did fore<U+017F>ee that this would be objected: We do ordain, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that <hi>Sylvander</hi>
<U+017F>hall take his chaplet of flowers from my hands, and wear it hereafter, by renewing
it with fre<U+017F>h flowers: Can you think Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he intended it to wither in a
day, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he would have me wear it for eternal memory? But in this, I mu<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e
you are excu<U+017F>able: For it is one of tho<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>teries in Love which you do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand,
and which I will unfold unto you, to the end you may know, why our ju<U+017F>t
judg did ordain, that you <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>tore that Garland which was given unto you, and
why I <U+017F>hould wear mine alwaies.</p>
                                 <p>Love, which our <U+017F>age <hi>Druides</hi> e<U+017F>teem to be the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> whom the Doctors
in the Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilian Schools do <U+017F>ay, was the fir<U+017F>t of all the gods who after the Chaos did
<U+017F>eparate things mortal from things immortal, and gave them life and perfection. And
becau<U+017F>e man was only created to know, to love, and to <U+017F>erve this great <hi>Tautates,</hi> whom
we were not able to comprehend by any corporeal repre<U+017F>entations or Ideas, he did <U+017F>et
before our eyes a body <U+017F>o perfect, as might in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort repre<U+017F>ent unto us, that which
he would have us know of him: To the end, that knowing him, we might come to
love him, and loving him, to <U+017F>erve him. And in as much as nothing is <U+017F>o bright and
pure as this great <hi>Tautates,</hi> he created that which he thought mo<U+017F>t pure and perfect,
and did imbelli<U+017F>h it with all the beauties, and accompli<U+017F>h it with all the perfections
that a body could be capable of, and called it the Sun. Thus the Sun, appeared pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
from one <U+017F>ide of Heaven unto the other, gave life and motion unto all that was
upon the earth, and wrought <U+017F>uch admirable effects, as many did think it to be the
great God, of whom it was only but an imperfect re<U+017F>emblance, and did adore it in
lieu of that which it did repre<U+017F>ent. Now <hi>Phillis,</hi> if you would know in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort what
this great <hi>Tautates</hi> Love is, you mu<U+017F>t learn it by the Sun, and <U+017F>uch things as fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our <U+017F>en<U+017F>es: And when you <U+017F>ee how the Sun gives life unto all that is in the univer<U+017F>e,
you ought to <U+017F>ay it your <U+017F>elf, that Love gives life unto all <U+017F>ouls, when it <U+017F>hines, not only
in heaven, but al<U+017F>o throughout all the earth: you mu<U+017F>t acknowledg Love to be the
light, which gives under<U+017F>tanding unto all <U+017F>pirits; for there is none <U+017F>o blind, but it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to open his eyes, and make him cleer <U+017F>ighted. And if this Sun of Love do not
<U+017F>hine, then is he all in darkne<U+017F><U+017F>e, without any light or under<U+017F>tanding: con<U+017F>ider al<U+017F>o,
how as the Sun does alter and change <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons, Love does the like: It cau<U+017F>eth the Spring,
by producing in our <U+017F>pirits the flowers of hopes; It cau<U+017F>eth Summer, by giving us the
fruits of tho<U+017F>e hopes; It cau<U+017F>eth Autumn, by letting us enjoy them; and it cau<U+017F>eth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53527:104"/>
Winter, by giving us <U+017F>o much under<U+017F>tanding, as to know how to pre<U+017F>erve them long. I
<U+017F>hould be too long if I <U+017F>hould relate all the re<U+017F>emblances betwixt Love and the Sun: Let
it <U+017F>uffice Shepherde<U+017F>s, that by this re<U+017F>emblance already in<U+017F>tanced, you may under<U+017F>tand,
how the<U+017F>e flowers, which you <U+017F>o much undervalue, &amp; <U+017F>ay are withered as <U+017F>oon as blown<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
are the hopes which Love produceth in his Spring: Oh Love! What greater favour
could I receive from my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e? Oh <hi>Phillis!</hi> how dear and infinitely plea<U+017F>ing
are the<U+017F>e flowers unto me? e<U+017F>pecially when I con<U+017F>ider the con<U+017F>equents of this favour<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
The<U+017F>e fair and <U+017F>weet flowers, are the Spring of my hopes; and can you think that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
will not pre<U+017F>ently follow after the Spring? Is not that ki<U+017F><U+017F>e of her fair hand
which <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to afford me, the fruit of tho<U+017F>e hopes? Does not this Glorious
Sun of my <U+017F>oul, afford me al<U+017F>o an Autumn and a Winter? Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Phillis,</hi> my
faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>e did not omit them, when <U+017F>he ordained I <U+017F>hould wear that Crown of
flowers continually among<U+017F>t the Shepherds, and renew it with fre<U+017F>h ones: Is not this
an Autumn and Winter both, <U+017F>ince I mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>erve it long, and renew my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e?
Con<U+017F>ider, O my enemy, how in taking the<U+017F>e flowers from you, and re<U+017F>toring them
unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> <U+017F>he intimates, that you mu<U+017F>t not hope for any thing. And if you have
flattered up your <U+017F>elf with any fond hopes, without any ground of rea<U+017F>on, it is fit you
be deprived of them before all this venerable company.</p>
                                 <p>There remaines nothing now to an<U+017F>wer; but only to tell you, why my faire<U+017F>t Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tris
was plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Phillis</hi> was more amiable then <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and upon what
rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he placed you in her own <U+017F>eat. For the better under<U+017F>tanding of it, know Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>e;
That what<U+017F>oever is good is amiable: but if the good be unknown, it is like
unto a hidden trea<U+017F>ure, which none can e<U+017F>teem until it be known: when <hi>Diana</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that you were amiable, <U+017F>he did it with good rea<U+017F>on, for doubtle<U+017F>s the vertues
which are in you, are good: for re<U+017F>embling my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris in <U+017F>ex, and other gifts of
Nature, there is no doubt but therein you are amiable, and much more then <hi>Sylvander:</hi>
But being deficient in other things which <U+017F>hould make you loved, and which <U+017F>he finds
in me, <U+017F>he has declared me to know better how to make my <U+017F>elf loved, then you do.
And this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, if you do rightly under<U+017F>tand it, is mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t, and not at all
di<U+017F>-advantagious to you: For all three mu<U+017F>t be con<U+017F>idered; <hi>Diana</hi> is <U+017F>he who was
to receive our <U+017F>ervices and our pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions: And you and I were to <U+017F>erve and Court her.
It is the property of a man to <U+017F>erve and Court a fair Mi<U+017F>tris: I have done according
to the duty and office of a man, in my Court<U+017F>hip of <hi>Diana;</hi> and <U+017F>he has done the right
office of a woman, in receiving my <U+017F>ervices: But it is prepo<U+017F>terous and ab<U+017F>urd for you,
who are a woman, to Court a woman, and therefore it is not at all <U+017F>trange, that
though you be more amiable, yet <hi>Sylvander</hi> <U+017F>hould know how to procure love better
then you, <U+017F>ince it is his part to court, and yours on the contrary to be courted; and
certainly our ju<U+017F>t Judge did <U+017F>o intend it, when <U+017F>he placed you in her room, intimating,
that as it was hers, <U+017F>o it was your part, not to <U+017F>erve, but to be <U+017F>erved. Confe<U+017F>s there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Phillis,</hi> that I have won the wager, and I will confe<U+017F><U+017F>e you to be more amiable
then I: And let us both <U+017F>ay, that never was a more wi<U+017F>e and ju<U+017F>t Judge, nor a fairer
Mi<U+017F>tris, then <hi>Diana,</hi> who<U+017F>e judgement has given me the victory, and who<U+017F>e perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
have made me eternally hers.</p>

                     <p>Thus <hi>Sylvander</hi> ended, leaving every one very well <U+017F>atisfied with his rea<U+017F>ons and
mode<U+017F>ty. <hi>Phillis</hi> her <U+017F>elf was forced to yeild unto him: and therefore <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>eeing
there was no need of a <U+017F>econd judgement, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid no more. <hi>Hylas</hi> only, who jeared
at all he had <U+017F>aid, and held <hi>Stella</hi> under the Arm, <U+017F>eeing all was <U+017F>ilent, he began to
talk. Well <hi>Sylvander,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) To what purpo<U+017F>e is all this long Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e? And
what can we learn from it? You may learn (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) that the ju<U+017F>t judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which <hi>Diana</hi> gave upon <U+017F>uch <U+017F>olid rea<U+017F>on, had like to have <U+017F>uffered the <U+017F>ame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
by the mi<U+017F>-interpretation of <hi>Phillis,</hi> that mo<U+017F>t Oracles do receive from tho<U+017F>e who
will turn them according to their own de<U+017F>ires, and wre<U+017F>t them <U+017F>o, as they <U+017F>uit with their
own pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. And <hi>Stella</hi> and you may learn, That as there is but one Sun which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embles
Love, <U+017F>o all ought to have but one Love. If it be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that Love,
like the Sun, gives life, and that none do live without it, and that you never loved any
until of very late, then you have been alive but very lately: And if <U+017F>o, good <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
tell me, how you did being dead, to look <U+017F>o well to your Flock, to hunt, to talk, to
<U+017F>ing, to run, and wre<U+017F>tle? I <U+017F>hould be very glad to learn that trick of you, that I may
do the <U+017F>ame when I am dead; for I have <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as they are dead, ca<U+017F>t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53527:105"/>
into the earth, and there's an end of them; but I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s you are the fine<U+017F>t
dead man that ever I <U+017F>aw; and if I could but do as you did before you were in love, I
would not care a ru<U+017F>h for death. <hi>Sylvander</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh at the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
of <hi>Hylas;</hi> but by way of an<U+017F>wer, he <U+017F>aid: 'Tis true, that Love is the life of our <U+017F>ouls,
if it be rightly under<U+017F>tood; and to that end, you mu<U+017F>t know <hi>Hylas,</hi> that there are
two kinds of life in a <U+017F>oul: The one, is that which it lives in the body; and the other,
which it lives with it <U+017F>elf. The fir<U+017F>t doth animate the Body, makes it walk, talk, eat,
and do all tho<U+017F>e things which you knew I did before I had the happine<U+017F>s to love <hi>Diana.</hi>
And the other gives life unto the Soul, and makes it live in it <U+017F>elf: For it enlightens
the Under<U+017F>tanding, forms the Imagination, and takes up the Will. The fir<U+017F>t kind of
life is common unto man, as unto all other animals; for all living do produce the <U+017F>ame
actions: But the other <U+017F>oaring higher then the Body, does give the Soul another kind
of life, which is common unto tho<U+017F>e pure thoughts of which we <U+017F>poke before. Now
<hi>Hylas,</hi> when I <U+017F>aid that Love gives life unto Souls; I did not then <U+017F>ay that the Body
was dead, in that <U+017F>en<U+017F>e which you apprehend it; for then I had <U+017F>aid things impo<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, becau<U+017F>e none can die before he live; and he who never loved, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lived; and he who never lived, cannot die. Ask me no more therefore, how
being dead, I came to talk, <U+017F>ing, leap, run, and <U+017F>uch like; for all tho<U+017F>e actions do
depend upon a life, which love daigns not to meddle with. Then I perceive (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>)
that your love is only in thought and imagination. No que<U+017F>tion of it (replyed
<hi>Sylvander</hi>) and as for other things, I leave them unto that in<U+017F>tinct which Nature gives
unto every one. Then (replyed <hi>Hylas</hi>) It is pity but we two <U+017F>hould love one Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s;
for we <U+017F>hould both agree excellently well: You in the Favours which <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>hew you in thought and imagination; and I, in tho<U+017F>e which your love leaves unto that
in<U+017F>tinct of Nature. <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and mo<U+017F>t of the Shepherds, did laugh heartily at the
merry humour of <hi>Hylas;</hi> and e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who at la<U+017F>t returned him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer.
Ah <hi>Hylas,</hi> Did you know how to Love, you would not <U+017F>peak thus, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
things as you do. Though my Soul doth live in its own thoughts, yet for all
that, it gives life unto that body which it animates: The Sun, which as I told you, is
the true Embleme of Love, though it do <U+017F>hine upon Cele<U+017F>tial things, yet it does al<U+017F>o
ca<U+017F>t his rayes upon Bodies here below: And why <U+017F>hould not Love, which enlightens
our Under<U+017F>tanding, and forms the thoughts of our <U+017F>ouls, give <U+017F>uch de<U+017F>ires al<U+017F>o unto
our Bodies, as are natural unto it? No, no <hi>Hylas,</hi> here lies all the difference; Tho<U+017F>e
who love as I do, they have none of tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ires whereof you <U+017F>peak, but becau<U+017F>e they
love: And tho<U+017F>e who love as you do, do not love, but becau<U+017F>e they have tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ires.
But <hi>Sylvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Stella,</hi> who was a little netled at this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e) <U+017F>ince you have
the<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ires, Are you not very bold, when you con<U+017F>ider who you are, and who <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
is? I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> That when I do look upon my <U+017F>elf
with eyes of equality, I think you are in the right; but when I con<U+017F>ider my extream
love, and the hopes which <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to give me, I think my <U+017F>elf not too blame.
Your extream love (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) and your hopes al<U+017F>o, are things invi<U+017F>ible. But the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of my faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) may make them vi<U+017F>ible: And though
mine have not hitherto been <U+017F>o great as to demon<U+017F>trate them, yet I hope to render her
<U+017F>uch <U+017F>ervice, as <U+017F>hall evidence it to her, and all the world, that my Love is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
that ever was. But had you ob<U+017F>erved her actions as well as I, you would not have
upbraided me with my hopes, as you have done: For is not every flower a hope? And
to what purpo<U+017F>e do you think <U+017F>he ordained I <U+017F>hould wear them upon my head? It is
true replied <hi>Stella;</hi> but as you received tho<U+017F>e flowers from the <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas,</hi> <U+017F>o you
mu<U+017F>t expect your hopes from him, and not from <hi>Diana.</hi> O <hi>Stella,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I
perceive your eye was only upon <hi>Hylas:</hi> for had you looked about you, you might
have <U+017F>een, I had them not from that <hi>Druide:</hi> It is true, I had them fir<U+017F>t from him,
but I laid them at the feet of <hi>Diana;</hi> to <U+017F>hew, that from her I expected all my hopes:
and now you <U+017F>ee them upon my head, from what other hand do you think I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, but from hers, upon whom all my hopes depend? Did I not receive this
Crown of Flowers from her fair hand? And did <U+017F>he not thereby as much as <U+017F>ay, HOPE?
But yet, replied <hi>Stella,</hi> the<U+017F>e flowers, and the<U+017F>e hopes, did come from the <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas:</hi>
This, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> is not without a deep mi<U+017F>tery, for perhaps the great <hi>Tauta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The di<U+017F>pute betwixt the<U+017F>e Shepherds, and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es had continued longer, had
they not come at the <U+017F>ame time unto the great Meddow, where the Shepherds u<U+017F>ed to
perform their exerci<U+017F>es. A great company was already a<U+017F><U+017F>embled from all parts, and
were prepared with all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, when <U+017F>eing the grand <hi>Druide</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a far off, they came to meet him, with many demon<U+017F>trations of joy, to have him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
them. After the Complements of Courte<U+017F>ie were performed, the Prizes were
<U+017F>et up, for Running, for Wre<U+017F>tling, for Leaping, and for throwing the Bar: <hi>Sylvander</hi>
had the honour of the fir<U+017F>t, <hi>Lycidas</hi> of wre<U+017F>tling, <hi>Hylas</hi> of leaping, and <hi>Hermantes</hi> of
throwing the bar: As for <hi>Sylvander,</hi> every one was glad of his victory, and of that
of <hi>Lycidas</hi> al<U+017F>o; but as for <hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Hermantes,</hi> who came with <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
the Shepherds of Forre<U+017F>ts did a little grudge at them: and <hi>Hylas</hi> going unto <hi>Stella,</hi>
becau<U+017F>e the prize which he had won, was a little Crown compo<U+017F>ed of Feathers; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eeched
her to let him put it upon her head; <hi>Sylvander</hi> <U+017F>eeing this, by way of mockery,
<U+017F>aid unto him, That, <hi>Hylas,</hi> is a very right reward for thy faithful paines. What do you
<U+017F>ay? (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> after he had put the Crown upon the head of <hi>Stella</hi>) I <U+017F>ay (an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Sylvander</hi>) that tho<U+017F>e who know you, and dare leap with you, are very bold; for
having <U+017F>uch a light head as you have, they might ea<U+017F>ily imagine your heels like unto
it, and be out of hopes to overcome you: but they who made that Crown, <U+017F>hewed
more judgement, for nothing could <U+017F>ute <U+017F>o well to your light mind, as a Cap of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
I am not at all a<U+017F>hamed of it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas;</hi> for unto you who are lumpi<U+017F>h
and dull, they did very well to give <U+017F>uch things as the gro<U+017F>s earth produceth, as that
Garland of Flowers, which you have in your hand: But unto me, as unto one who is
compo<U+017F>ed of a more noble temper, they have pre<U+017F>ented Feathers, to <U+017F>hew, that I do
elevate my <U+017F>elf in the Element of Ayr; as de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch a lumpi<U+017F>h piece as you are;

(an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) I did not run, to make it appear I was lighter; but becau<U+017F>e I

in the mean time, I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you, to accept of this Crown which I have
won, to the end I may put this day in the Calender, as the happie<U+017F>t I ever yet lived.
The Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e who did love this Shepherd, and began to re<U+017F>ign that place in her
heart which <hi>Philander</hi> had, <U+017F>he was inclinable to grant his reque<U+017F>t: but fearing le<U+017F>t her
good will would too much appear, <U+017F>he refu<U+017F>ed it, and had gone away, if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and
<hi>Alexis</hi> had not <U+017F>tayed her; telling her, that <hi>Sylvanders</hi> reque<U+017F>t was <U+017F>o rea<U+017F>onable,

that this Chaplet of Flowers, which <hi>Diana</hi> wears upon her head, were given unto <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi>
for otherwi<U+017F>e, it will grieve him at the heart, to <U+017F>ee <hi>Sylvander's</hi> Garland upon the

though <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw that <U+017F>he had no rea<U+017F>on to love him, being but a poor unknown <U+017F>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<U+017F>he was at a <U+017F>tand what to do; but thinking that then there was no better way then
to <U+017F>eem contented he <U+017F>hould behave him<U+017F>elf the re<U+017F>t of the day as he de<U+017F>ired, <U+017F>he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered

the day, as you began it, <U+017F>ince <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> would have it <U+017F>o. If I thought
(an<U+017F>wered he) that when this day is ended, I <U+017F>hould have done loving you; I
vow by him that gave me life, I would not live it out. You are permitted (replied

therefore within an hour after the Sun is <U+017F>et, there will be no light, nor by con<U+017F>equence,
any day to continue the behaviour which your Wager permitted you. Give me leave
to tell you, Faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid he, That no time can limit the <U+017F>ervice which I owe you,
nor any forbiddance has power to divert me from that real Affection, which I have
vowed unto you: And faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F>s, Let me further tell you in words of Truth,
That this Wager fir<U+017F>t began without any other De<U+017F>ign then to conquer <hi>Phillis,</hi> and for

made it appear, that there is no je<U+017F>ting with Love; and that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be long
neer a great fire, and not be burned. <hi>Sylvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) If you do intend I <U+017F>hould

the difference betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and you began: But when the day is done, Take heed
how you an<U+017F>wer me, that I may know what to do; And I heartily entreat you to think
well upon it. <hi>Sylvander</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Diana</hi> more in earne<U+017F>t then he imagined, and fearing
that if he went any further, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould for ever bani<U+017F>h him; he re<U+017F>olved to incen<U+017F>e her
no farther, but to refer it unto time, which by his long <U+017F>ervices might have better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence

his Services, and a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of his Affection, under the <U+017F>ame cover which <U+017F>he

The day is not yet done; and when it is, I <U+017F>hall be-think my <U+017F>elf how to an<U+017F>wer you;

an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> and <U+017F>mil'd; for however <U+017F>he <U+017F>eems the contrary, yet there is not one
Spepherde<U+017F>s that takes your part more really then <U+017F>he: But I would not have our di<U+017F>pute
to be made a publique bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, as that was betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and you; for <U+017F>everal con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:
Let it be this night, when every one is retired, for we all <U+017F>up this night at

                     <p>Oh, what con<U+017F>olation were the<U+017F>e words unto <hi>Sylvander!</hi> For <hi>Dianas</hi> de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>ecrecy
was an argument unto him, that his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was upon good terms: And the truth is,
The good will of this Shepherde<U+017F>s was by degrees more and more inclinable unto <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander;</hi>
<U+017F>o as though <U+017F>he knew not well what to do, yet it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for her to

                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>A<U+017F>rea</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> went talking together; and as it is u<U+017F>ual in

Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, to pa<U+017F>s from one <U+017F>ubject unto another; they fell at la<U+017F>t upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

you think of <hi>Sylvander</hi>'s love? I think, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that this Shepherd is very deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in love, and that if <hi>Diana</hi> did not carry her <U+017F>elf very prudently, I <U+017F>hould fear <U+017F>he
does not di<U+017F>like of it. For my part, replied the <hi>Druide,</hi> I am of opinion that <U+017F>he does
not wi<U+017F>h him ill. You are not <U+017F>ingular in your opinion, Madam, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi>
for I have ob<U+017F>erved that the addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of this Shepherd are not at all di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto
her; and the truth is, <hi>Sylvander</hi> is no de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>eable Shepherd, nor have I met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of more merit. Upon this <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ilent, and <U+017F>o did <hi>Alexis.</hi> At la<U+017F>t <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
again, with a deep <U+017F>igh; It is mo<U+017F>t certain (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that <hi>Diana</hi> does love this
Shepherd, and both <hi>Phillis</hi> and my <U+017F>elf are the cau<U+017F>e of it; for we did con<U+017F>train her
even by force, to permit <hi>Sylvander</hi> to make addre<U+017F>s unto her; and though it was at the
fir<U+017F>t in je<U+017F>t, yet it proved afterwards in good earne<U+017F>t; and I fore<U+017F>ee, that unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he
take good heed, <U+017F>he will not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>-engage her <U+017F>elf as <U+017F>he imagines. Be plea<U+017F>ed
to know Madam, that <hi>Sylvander</hi> is a Shepherd unknown, and nothing beholding unto
Fortune, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he has concealed from him, both his Country, and the knowledge of
his Parents: So as <hi>Diana,</hi> who has as high a mind as any Shepherde<U+017F>s in all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood,
will never permit <hi>Sylvander</hi> to <U+017F>erve her openly, be his merits never <U+017F>o great:
nor would her Parents, who are the principal of all about the Banks of the Fatal
<hi>Lignon,</hi> allow of it: And yet I <U+017F>ee that <hi>Sylvander</hi> is <U+017F>o much taken with her Beauty
and Perfections, as I dare lay a wager, that nothing in the world, neither the rigour
of the Shepherde<U+017F>s, nor the forbiddance of Parents, nor any other ob<U+017F>tacle what<U+017F>oever,
can divert him; <U+017F>o as when <hi>Diana</hi> commanding him to <U+017F>peak no more unto her, as he
did, during the wager, he will con<U+017F>train him<U+017F>elf a little, but it will be ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
for him to overcome him<U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o as after <U+017F>o many great expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the more he would hide it, the more will <U+017F>he <U+017F>ee it through his con<U+017F>traint. I will
not <U+017F>ay any thing of what I have already thought concerning <hi>Diana;</hi> for loving her as
I do, I <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry to <U+017F>ee her any way mi<U+017F>carry; and yet con<U+017F>idering the way
<U+017F>he takes, it is almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould do otherwi<U+017F>e. What does <U+017F>he intend to
do? asked <hi>Alexis.</hi> The good opinion which <U+017F>he ju<U+017F>tly has of her own merits (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) will not permit her to allow of <hi>Sylvander</hi>'s Court<U+017F>hip, but makes her
re<U+017F>olve to have recour<U+017F>e unto tho<U+017F>e extream remedies of forbidding him, which women
u<U+017F>e unto <U+017F>uch who<U+017F>e Court<U+017F>hip is di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto them. I do not like her way (<U+017F>aid
<hi>Alexis</hi>) and if <U+017F>he follow it, <U+017F>he will repent it: For <hi>Sylvander</hi> loving her as he does,
he will not be diverted by it; and then, as you <U+017F>ay, the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s will become the talk of
the Country. But <U+017F>he had better take one of the<U+017F>e two ways, either to let him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es under the vail of a Fiction; for which excu<U+017F>es enough are to be
found; or el<U+017F>e permit him <U+017F>ecretly to make his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es: For I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, Fair
Shepherde<U+017F>s, that the Vertues of <hi>Diana,</hi> and the Merits of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> makes me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
they may live contentedly, though it be to the di<U+017F>advantage of <hi>Paris</hi> my Brother,
who I know does love her; but it is better he <U+017F>hould mi<U+017F>s of his de<U+017F>ires, then by-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
them, to make two of <U+017F>o much merit, mi<U+017F>erable all the re<U+017F>t of their days: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides,
<hi>Diana</hi> loving my Brother only by rea<U+017F>ons of E<U+017F>tate, Doubtle<U+017F>s the lo<U+017F>s of one <U+017F>o
dear unto her as <hi>Sylvander</hi> is, would make her <U+017F>o full of <U+017F>orrow, and <U+017F>o much change
her, that my Brother could not take any great delight in her: And though this do at
the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e <hi>Paris,</hi> yet he will better pa<U+017F>s it over then <hi>Sylvander</hi> can, having not
<U+017F>o violent an affection unto <hi>Diana</hi> as that Shepherd hath. Moreover, we <U+017F>hall more
ea<U+017F>ily divert him from it, by propounding <U+017F>ome other marriage unto him, more <U+017F>utable
unto his quality.</p>
                     <p>In <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, they came unto the Town of <hi>Phocion,</hi> who received them
very kindly, and treated them with <U+017F>o neat a <U+017F>upper; that <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Daphnide</hi> confe<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed,
he <U+017F>hamed the great Cities. But <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was not <U+017F>o well contented as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired: For
<hi>Phocion</hi> had young <hi>Calidon</hi> there, and <U+017F>et him at the Table ju<U+017F>t oppo<U+017F>ite unto her:
This young Shepherd was <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in Love, that his eyes were never off her;
which troubled <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> extreamly: for <U+017F>he could never look up, but <U+017F>till met with his
eye upon her. <hi>Alexis,</hi> who was of <hi>Calidons</hi> mind, did the very <U+017F>ame, though with
much more <U+017F>atisfaction unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who al<U+017F>o could not <U+017F>atisfie her eyes with looking
upon <hi>Celadon</hi> under the umbrage of a woman: But <hi>Alexis</hi> had the advantage of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53527:107"/>
for having <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> on her <U+017F>ide, they could talk together and not be heard, which
they did almo<U+017F>t all <U+017F>upper while: And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Alexis</hi> ob<U+017F>erved the eyes of <hi>Calidon,</hi>
<U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto <hi>Astrea:</hi> Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e do you not think that you <U+017F>it in a very ill
place? I <U+017F>hall never think <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> as long as I am <U+017F>o neer you, which is
the greate<U+017F>t contentment I can have; but I wi<U+017F>h that <U+017F>ome trouble<U+017F>ome eyes which are
continually on my face, were turned <U+017F>ome other way, or el<U+017F>e that the owner of them
were further off. The trouble which you endure, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> is a con<U+017F>equent of your
beauty; and you mu<U+017F>t not think it <U+017F>trange, that Shepherds <U+017F>hould Love you, <U+017F>ince I
who am a woman, and one who never <U+017F>aw you before this three or four dayes, am <U+017F>o
extreamly taken with you, that I think my <U+017F>elf in Love with you. As <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>poke
the<U+017F>e words <U+017F>he changed countenance: The Zeal of her expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or her fear of <U+017F>peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too plainly, was the cau<U+017F>e of it. <hi>Astrea</hi> an<U+017F>wered her with a <U+017F>miling eye, I wi<U+017F>h with
all my heart Madam, that there were any thing in me which might do you any real <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and ingratiate me into your favour: For I am <U+017F>o perfectly yours that nothing
but death can <U+017F>ever me from you and I think the happine<U+017F>s of it <U+017F>o great, that I would
not change contentment with all the Kings, Emperors, and Monarchs upon earth.
<hi>Alexis</hi> fearing that if the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions continued, hearers would think they talked too
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately for women, <U+017F>he took her hand, and wi<U+017F>pered unto her, I will <U+017F>ooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>e
life then this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance you give me: but for <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons which afterwards I will
tell you, let us break off this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and talk of it at night when we are alone, or
to morrow when we walk in the woods.</p>
                     <p>After <U+017F>upper ended, and tables removed, many Neighboring young Shepherds
came to dance and <U+017F>ing, and rejoyce, for finding the Mi<U+017F>sletoe of the New-year, for
<U+017F>o they called it. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> were de<U+017F>irous to be <U+017F>pectators of
their harmle<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>ports, they de<U+017F>ired <hi>Adamas</hi> he would be plea<U+017F>ed they might wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> out
and <U+017F>ee the Shepherds and Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es dance. <hi>Adamas</hi> who was willing to give
them all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>atisfaction, he took <hi>Daphnide</hi> by the hand, and led her forth, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Leonide</hi> to conduct <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and all the re<U+017F>t of the Company, who followed them
into a great room, where <U+017F>uch publique rejoycings were wont to be kept, and where
they found abundance of Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es dancing and <U+017F>inging.</p>
                     <p>The Sun had been long <U+017F>et, and no day appeared; but the Moon <U+017F>hined <U+017F>o cleer, as
if <U+017F>he had borrowed more light then u<U+017F>ual, purpo<U+017F>ely for that night: <hi>Daphnide</hi> was
much taken with the plea<U+017F>antne<U+017F>s of the place, and coolne<U+017F>s of the air: And all <U+017F>itting
down, <U+017F>ome on one <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>ome on another, they began to dance and <U+017F>ing, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
their parts <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omly, that <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but admire
the Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon.</hi> After they had danced half an hour, there
came from the neighboring Towns, a company of Shepherds di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed in the habit of
Egyptians, who danced after the manner of that people: And as they had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
taught by <hi>Alcippe</hi> the father of <hi>Celadon,</hi> upon his return from his long travels,
they danced unto <U+017F>ongs, and <U+017F>ang as they danced: And when they had done, they
went unto all the company, and offered to tell the Fortunes of all <U+017F>uch who would
<U+017F>hew them their hands. This pa<U+017F>time having la<U+017F>ted long, and it being almo<U+017F>t midnight,
<hi>Adamas</hi> thought it time to retire: So as they all parted, and went unto their Towns,
<hi>Phocion</hi> carried unto his hou<U+017F>e, <hi>Adamas, Paris, Alexis,</hi> and <hi>Leonide,</hi> being very <U+017F>orry
that his hou<U+017F>e was not of capacity to lodge <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> with their company
al<U+017F>o. But <hi>Adamas</hi> thinking before hand that he could not do it with any conveniency,
he appointed <hi>Lycidas</hi> to lodg them in the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Celadon,</hi> where <hi>Diamis</hi> his uncle
expected them; but by rea<U+017F>on of his old age left the management of all things unto
<hi>Lycidas,</hi> which that Shepherd did perform very exactly, though he was extreamly
perplexed, that he could not have the company of his dear <hi>Phillis</hi> in his hou<U+017F>e: For
<U+017F>he told him, that if he would bid tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers welcome, <U+017F>he would go with <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi>
and lye with her.</p>
                     <p>Thus every one retired to their lodgings, <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by <hi>Sylvander,</hi> they carryed <hi>Adamas</hi> unto <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> hou<U+017F>e, where <hi>Phocion</hi> <U+017F>tayed
to bid them welcome as well as he could. The Chambers were ordered thus; <hi>Adamas</hi>
and <hi>Paris</hi> did lie in one, where <hi>Phocion</hi> was wont to lie; <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to lie in that which was wont to be <hi>A<U+017F>treas,</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> took another. When <hi>Adamas</hi>
under<U+017F>tood that the chambers were thus ordered, he did not like that <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
<U+017F>hould be alone together in a chamber, fearing le<U+017F>t the Female <hi>Druide,</hi> <U+017F>hould, by a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53527:107"/>
miracle of Love become a Shepherd, and le<U+017F>t <hi>Leonide,</hi> whom he knew did not hate
<hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>hould carre<U+017F>s <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>o much, as to make him ca<U+017F>t off his <hi>Druides</hi> habit:
And therefore, taking <hi>Leonide</hi> a<U+017F>ide, he <U+017F>aid unto her, that when all the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es
were retired, he would have <hi>Alexis</hi> come <U+017F>ecretly, and lie in his chamber; and
though there was but two beds in it, yet it was no matter; for <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>hould lie with
him, and <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>hould lie in the other. I thought upon that before, (an<U+017F>wered
the Nimph) but I thought it not expedient, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome of the hou<U+017F>e might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
come in and <U+017F>ee her, which would be no <U+017F>mall <U+017F>candal: be<U+017F>ides, <hi>Paris</hi> perhaps
might take notice of her. What cour<U+017F>e (replied <hi>Adamas</hi>) would you then take?
For I do not think you can find a better way: Pardon me good father, replied <U+017F>he;
I conceive it much better for <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and I to lie together in one bed, and <hi>Alexis</hi> in
the other.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps (<U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas</hi>) that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> loving <hi>Alexis</hi> better then <U+017F>he does you,
<U+017F>he will de<U+017F>ire to lye with her rather then with you. If <U+017F>he needs will do <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered
the Nimph, then let her, and I will take the other bed: but you may do as I <U+017F>ay
very ea<U+017F>ily; for if you come under pretence of <U+017F>eeing us: you may <U+017F>ay it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable
we <U+017F>hould put <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> out of her Chamber, that it is enough you have di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
<hi>Phocion</hi> out of his, and <U+017F>o you may appoint that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and I <U+017F>hould lye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
pretending that the daughters of <hi>Druides</hi> never u<U+017F>e to lye with any, but by
them<U+017F>elves. <hi>Adamas</hi> thought this invention to be good: And <hi>Phocion</hi> being reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he commanded <hi>Paris</hi> to go to bed, and then he came to vi<U+017F>it <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide;</hi>
but he found the Chamber fuller then he expected, there being with <hi>A<U+017F>trea,
Diana</hi> and <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who was di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing upon his difference with <hi>Diana,</hi> when
the <hi>Druide</hi> entred: Daughters, <U+017F>aid he, I come to <U+017F>ee how you are lodged, but I
perceive you are very trouble<U+017F>ome unto the Fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> for I under<U+017F>tand that it is
her Chamber. It is true Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> but both my Chamber and my <U+017F>elf
are much honoured in that we are able to do any <U+017F>ervice unto <U+017F>uch whom I love <U+017F>o
infinitely. Daughter, replied <hi>Adamas,</hi> I will not upon any termes <U+017F>uffer you to go
out of it; <hi>Leonide</hi> and you may lye together; and did not the Laws of <hi>Druides</hi>
daughters forbid it, I <U+017F>hould intreat the Fair <hi>Diana</hi> take half of a bed with <hi>Alexis.</hi>
Father, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> the bed is <U+017F>o large, as we may lye all three together without
any trouble. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> out of re<U+017F>pect unto the Nimph, <U+017F>eemed not to be
willing. No, no, replied <hi>Adamas, Leonide</hi> and my daughter <U+017F>hall go into my
Chamber, were we will lye as well as we can, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you re<U+017F>olve to lye altogether,
for I will not by any means, you <U+017F>hould have any other Chamber then this, <hi>Diana,</hi>
then <U+017F>eeing it was the will of <hi>Adamas,</hi> gave her con<U+017F>ent, and <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Diana</hi>
con<U+017F>ented, obeyed the <hi>Druide:</hi> All this while <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>tood mute, <U+017F>o amazed to <U+017F>ee
her <U+017F>elf in <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> hou<U+017F>e, and to lye with her, though not in the <U+017F>ame bed, yet in
the <U+017F>ame Chamber with her, as he thought this to be a fault unpardonable if ever it
was known unto her. <hi>Adamas</hi> ob<U+017F>erving it when he bad good night unto all the
re<U+017F>t, took her hand and <U+017F>aid unto her. I think daughter, the length of the way has
much wearied you, it is good for you to lie long in bed to morrow, and re<U+017F>t your
<U+017F>elf; for <hi>Phocion</hi> has de<U+017F>ired me to retain <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> here two or three
dayes, <U+017F>o as if you be but ready again<U+017F>t dinner it is time enough: Afterwards he
whi<U+017F>pered her in the ear; <hi>Alexis,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) what makes you <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad? Take heed
you do not <U+017F>poil the plot which we have thus far carried on <U+017F>o well; and from which
you may expect <U+017F>o much contentment. Then <hi>Adamas</hi> retired to his Chamber,
leaving <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> took notice of it; and believing that the
length of the way had done her <U+017F>ome harm, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewed abundance of <U+017F>orrow to <U+017F>ee
her in that condition. But <hi>Leonide</hi> who knew well enough where her <U+017F>hooe did pinch
her, did an<U+017F>wer for her; No, no, <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, never trouble your <U+017F>elf, her pain
will be quickly over: I have <U+017F>een her often in the<U+017F>e fits, and well again pre<U+017F>ently.
But me thinks (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and turned towards <hi>Sylvander</hi>) that it is time for this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
to retire, it being not long before it will be day. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
I <U+017F>hall be quickly gone, <U+017F>o I may but carry with me what I brought hither.
<hi>Diana</hi> knowing that he meant her; Shepherd <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I do not intend to <U+017F>tir from
hence this night, but I will put <hi>Phillis</hi> in my room whom you may wait upon home
as if it was my <U+017F>elf, and to morrow I will expect you give me an account of her
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53527:108"/>
here, where I promi<U+017F>e to expect you about ten or eleven of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
What power, I be<U+017F>eech you, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> have you to give her unto
me? The <U+017F>ame power, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> that <U+017F>he has to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me, when <U+017F>he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth.
I had rather, replied he, ta<U+017F>t her liberality then yours. It is enough for this
time (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide</hi>) that <hi>Diana</hi> to <U+017F>hew what an ab<U+017F>olute victory you have gotten,
does let you carry your enemie away as a pri<U+017F>oner. I had rather Madam, replied
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> be a pri<U+017F>oner unto her, who gave me the victory, and be tyed never to
<U+017F>tir from her, then to be the Conqueror of this enemy, whom <U+017F>he hath put into my
hands. <hi>Phillis</hi> offered to reply, when <hi>Lycidas,</hi> according to his promi<U+017F>e, came to
wait upon her; and then loo<U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf from the hands of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> <U+017F>ee ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

nothing to do with you, and before you get me your pri<U+017F>oner again, you mu<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

                     <p>In the interim, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was <U+017F>o bu<U+017F>ie, and officious about her dear <hi>Alexis,</hi> in

<hi>Druide</hi> was willing to allow it as long as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could: but when <U+017F>he came to
put off her Gown, fearing le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould find <U+017F>ome fault with her bre<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>he beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<U+017F>he let grow vvhile<U+017F>t <U+017F>he was in her cave, and ever <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he had the name of <hi>Alexis,</hi>
vvas now <U+017F>o long as might vvell become a vvoman; and if <U+017F>he had but any rea<U+017F>ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

for her, to remedy her bre<U+017F>ts, and therefore <U+017F>he took all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible care to hide
them, though it vvas a hard matter to conceal them from any that vvould take any
particular notice. Having therefore pinned her <U+017F>mock before her bre<U+017F>ts, and at
the <U+017F>leeves, <U+017F>he drew the Curtaines towards that <U+017F>ide where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> undre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her

eye: So as it being light day, and <U+017F>he not able to <U+017F>leep, <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t her eye upon the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53527:108"/>
bed where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> lay; it being very hot weather, in the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> the<U+017F>e
Fair ones left their Curtains open; and the Sun di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed its Rays <U+017F>o <U+017F>plendidly into
the Chamber, that the curious eye of this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide,</hi> might ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi>
who by chance lay almo<U+017F>t out of the bed; <hi>Leonide</hi> lay in the mid<U+017F>t; that, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid,
<U+017F>he might make it her boa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he had lain between two of the greate<U+017F>t Beauties in the
whole world: And indeed, <U+017F>he did <U+017F>o; for never was two different Beauties more
exactly perfect then the<U+017F>e two. Judge then what a Vi<U+017F>ion had <hi>Alexis,</hi> when he
<U+017F>aw <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> thus; one of her Arms hung carele<U+017F>ly out of the Bed, and hardly any
difference could be found betwixt her <U+017F>mock and it in whitene<U+017F>s; her other Arm lay
under her head, and cau<U+017F>ed the right <U+017F>ide of her Brea<U+017F>t to lie naked, with which the
Sun <U+017F>eemed to be in love, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed, by <U+017F>hining upon it. O Love! How many
<U+017F>everal ways thou ha<U+017F>t to torment tho<U+017F>e who are thy Subjects! How did<U+017F>t thou treat
this Shepherd in his <U+017F>olitary Cave, when being deprived of the <U+017F>ight of his Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s,
thou made<U+017F>t him to lament his ab<U+017F>ence from this Fair one? And at this time,
How do<U+017F>t thou torment him with too much light, and blinding his eyes by two
Suns; <U+017F>o as whether ab<U+017F>ent or pre<U+017F>ent, he is <U+017F>till tormented? This thought did <U+017F>o
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the mind of <hi>Alexis,</hi> that before ever he took any notice of it, the Sun was
a great height; And had not <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> by chance turned on the other <U+017F>ide, and by
that means taking this plea<U+017F>ant Vi<U+017F>ion from his eye, doubtle<U+017F>s he had looked longer:
but being deprived of the light of this glorious Sun, <U+017F>he thought her <U+017F>elf in darkne<U+017F>s,
and that the other Sun gave no light. At the la<U+017F>t, not being able to abide in the<U+017F>e
impatiences, <U+017F>he aro<U+017F>e <U+017F>oftly out of her bed, dre<U+017F>s'd her <U+017F>elf without any noi<U+017F>e, and
went unto the bed of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who was turned towards <hi>Leonide,</hi> with her right Arm
over her, and her cheek upon her <U+017F>houlder. What jealou<U+017F>ie, or rather, what envie
did <U+017F>he not conceive again<U+017F>t this Nymph? Oh heavens! (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her <U+017F>elf) too
happy <hi>Leonide,</hi> how can<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>leep, and have <U+017F>uch a glorious occa<U+017F>ion to wake?
Can<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>hut thy eyes, and employ them upon any thing then looking upon this
Beauty, which every one ought to adore? Then <U+017F>taying a while mute; What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Inju<U+017F>tice is in the Fate of things here below? (replyed <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently after)
Why <U+017F>hould this in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Nymph have a happine<U+017F>s which <U+017F>he cannot enjoy? And
why <U+017F>hould I who am infinitely de<U+017F>irous of it, be thus unju<U+017F>tly deprived? Then
folding her Arms upon her Brea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he retired back a pace or two, not removing her
eye from this plea<U+017F>ing object: And after <U+017F>he had long contemplated upon it; Oh
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he a little louder) will you never recal me from my bani<U+017F>hment? And
mu<U+017F>t I, without knowing the cau<U+017F>e, Live continually in your pre<U+017F>ence, as if I were
di<U+017F>tant from you? But again<U+017F>t whom <U+017F>hould I complain, <U+017F>ince Fortune has brought
me nearer my happine<U+017F>s, then ever I could expect or hope for? And why <U+017F>hould I
not try Fortune a little further? Perhaps <U+017F>he will as well give me as high content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as before <U+017F>he dejected me into the Aby<U+017F>s of mi<U+017F>ery: Courage Shepherd, why
art thou <U+017F>o fearful to approach this Fair one? Why do<U+017F>t thou not beg her pardon,
and re<U+017F>tore <hi>Celadon</hi> unto her, whom thou ha<U+017F>t <U+017F>toln from her under the habit of
<hi>Alexis?</hi> Say unto her, Here is the Shepherd whom you <U+017F>o much loved; Here is
<hi>Celadon</hi> that has given you his heart, and all that's his: You did once love him;
and if <hi>Celadon</hi> has done any thing which hath offended you, then open this Brea<U+017F>t
which he here pre<U+017F>ents unto you, and take that which is your own, his heart; which
mo<U+017F>t certainly never con<U+017F>ented unto any thing that could offend you. As thou <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
thus unto her, fall down upon thy knees, and pre<U+017F>ent thy naked Brea<U+017F>t unto her,
that if <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he may take that heart which loves and adores her, and which
cannot re<U+017F>t until it be in her fair hands. Upon this <hi>Alexis</hi> all in a rapture, <U+017F>tepped
forward, as if he did intend to effect his thoughts; and perhaps had now di<U+017F>cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him<U+017F>elf, had he not upon a <U+017F>udden reprehended him<U+017F>elf thus. Oh <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid
he) can<U+017F>t thou be thus di<U+017F>obedient unto the command of this Shepherde<U+017F>s? Mu<U+017F>t
thou be upbraided with failing in the Laws of perfect Love? Ha<U+017F>t thou thus long
<U+017F>erved this Fair one with un<U+017F>tained affection, and now by an imprudent and ra<U+017F>h Act,
which will bring thee too late repentance, <U+017F>poil all? O <hi>Celadon,</hi> Do<U+017F>t thou not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the<U+017F>e words? Go di<U+017F>loyal Lover, and never <U+017F>ee me again, till I command thee;
Can<U+017F>t thou (I <U+017F>ay) remember this, and have <U+017F>o little affection as to dare to di<U+017F>obey?
No, no (<U+017F>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Upon this, with teares in her eyes, <U+017F>he went out of the chamber to view tho<U+017F>e pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where formerly <U+017F>he had received <U+017F>o much contentment, and to ask an account
of all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ighes and de<U+017F>ires which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o often committed to their cu<U+017F>tody.
At fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he went into the garden, through which an arm of the River <hi>Lignon</hi> runs:
Then looked upon the Fountain, which is in the mid<U+017F>t of it; over which <U+017F>tands the
Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Ceres</hi> upon an Arch, <U+017F>upported by great Columns; and under which is a
great Ba<U+017F>in, re<U+017F>embling a Crown, that receives this plea<U+017F>ant <U+017F>ource. Approching
unto this Fountain, <U+017F>he there wa<U+017F>hed her hands, and her face, as formerly <U+017F>he was
wont; and looking upon it, here is the very place, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> has <U+017F>o
often vowed eternal affection unto me. This is the Fountain where taking my
hand in hers, <U+017F>he <U+017F>wore that <U+017F>he would <U+017F>ooner cea<U+017F>e to live<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> then cea<U+017F>e to love <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon:</hi>
Then <U+017F>tepping forward with a trembling pace to the ba<U+017F>in which held the
water, here are the Letters of our Names, <U+017F>aid he, engraved by her own hand; Oh
ye witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of my extream affection! and now ye ju<U+017F>t accu<U+017F>ers of the faire<U+017F>t Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
in the world, why are you not defaced out of this Marble, as well as out of
her heart? Or do you remain here <U+017F>till to upbraid her with her change? Then going
from this Fountain, <U+017F>he went into a little wood of Ha<U+017F>els, where the walks are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
with <U+017F>o many turnings and windings, that they will deceive tho<U+017F>e that walk in
them, and make them lo<U+017F>e their way in going out again. This was the place which
brought into his memory his pa<U+017F>t happine<U+017F>s, which he now re<U+017F>ented <U+017F>o bitterly,
that his teares did te<U+017F>tifie his grief: For it was in this little wood, where he was
wont to talk often with his Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, when their Parents even weary with
cro<U+017F><U+017F>ing their loves, did permit them more liberty of <U+017F>eeing each other, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, then before they u<U+017F>ed. Calling into memory therefore all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ented in that place, and all the vowes of fidelity which <U+017F>he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from her Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e, but wonder that <U+017F>he could forget
all the vowes and oathes which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>worn in that place.</p>
                     <p>This thought entertained her a long while, not without the company of many a
<U+017F>igh, and many a tear; and had not her walk conducted her before <U+017F>he was aware
unto the <U+017F>ide of that arm of the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> which ran about all the Garden, <U+017F>he
had not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon got out: but the <U+017F>ight of this River did <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>hly revive the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of her former happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, as <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>it down upon the bank,
and was <U+017F>o much tran<U+017F>ported out of her <U+017F>elf, as it was a long time before <U+017F>he knew
where <U+017F>he was.</p>
                     <p>All this while <U+017F>he did not remember that perhaps <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> would wake, and that
<hi>Leonide</hi> and <U+017F>he, not finding her in the chamber, would wonder extreamly what
was become of her. And <U+017F>o it hapned; for it being already late enough <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
wakned, and the Sun <U+017F>hining very gloriou<U+017F>ly into the room, <U+017F>he looked towards
the bed of <hi>Alexis:</hi> but <U+017F>eeing all the Curtaines open and none in bed, <U+017F>he rai<U+017F>ed her
<U+017F>elf a little higher in the bed to look a little better, and <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he was not there, <U+017F>he
could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>igh <U+017F>o loud that <hi>Leonide</hi> heard her, and asked her whether <U+017F>he
was <U+017F>ick: No, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> but I am troubled that I cannot <U+017F>ee <hi>Alexis</hi> in the
bed where <U+017F>he lay the la<U+017F>t night; How! <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> and <U+017F>tarted up, is <U+017F>hee not
there? Then rai<U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf a little, and finding it true, and that the door was
open: what in the name of Heaven is become of her? <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he. I beleeve, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Diana,</hi> that <U+017F>he is gone to walk before the heat of the day begin: <hi>Leonide</hi> was
afraid that the melancholy humour of <hi>Celadon</hi> might make <hi>Alexis</hi> take up <U+017F>ome
new re<U+017F>olution: yet lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover too much of her thoughts unto the<U+017F>e
Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es; I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, unto them, let me dre<U+017F><U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf as <U+017F>oon as
I can, and <U+017F>ee if I can find her: for if <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>hould know that I let her go alone,
he would be very angry with me: The Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es ro<U+017F>e all out of bed, and made
<U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>t, that they were ready before the Nimph although <U+017F>he made all the ha<U+017F>t
that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could. And going by Fortune out of the <U+017F>ame door, which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into the Garden, they went unto the Fountain of <hi>Ceres,</hi> which <hi>Leonide</hi> found
to be a very fine piece, and exqui<U+017F>itly wrought: From thence they went forward
into the grove of <hi>Hazels,</hi> and as if they were guided through that Labyrinth by the
thred of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> they came directly to the River <U+017F>ide, where <hi>Alexis</hi> was lying
upon the ground; and as fortune would have, it was ri<U+017F>ing up to view the re<U+017F>t of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53527:109"/>
tho<U+017F>e places, where <U+017F>he had left <U+017F>o many marks of her former contentments, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
affection. <hi>Astrea</hi> <U+017F>pied her fir<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>hewing her unto the Nimph, <U+017F>aid unto
her, I think Madam, that <hi>Diana</hi> can divine; for <U+017F>ee where the <hi>Druide</hi> is walking
all alone upon the banks of the water, which runs into that fatal River of <hi>Lignon,
Leonide</hi> then <U+017F>eeing that <hi>Alexis</hi> had no <U+017F>uch intention as <U+017F>he feared, <U+017F>he was very
joyfull: but as <U+017F>he was advancing towards her, <U+017F>he heard one call upon her, and
turning her <U+017F>elf about, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw it was <hi>Paris,</hi> who <U+017F>eemed a far off very de<U+017F>irous to
<U+017F>peak with her; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew not what his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e might be, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it might be <U+017F>uch as was not for <hi>Diana</hi> to hear: Fair ones, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I be<U+017F>eech
you go you unto <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <U+017F>tay with her, while<U+017F>t I go and <U+017F>ee what bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e
<hi>Paris</hi> hath with me. The Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es were very glad of this commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion; for
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> longed to <U+017F>ee the face of <hi>Celadon</hi> in that <hi>Druide,</hi> who<U+017F>e voice, words and
ge<U+017F>tures, were <U+017F>o re<U+017F>emblant unto that Shepherd, as <U+017F>he took extream delight in her
company: and <hi>Diana</hi> was glad al<U+017F>o to be thus rid of <hi>Paris,</hi> as well becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he did
not love him, as becau<U+017F>e love made her think very well of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and <U+017F>he could
not permit her eares to hearken unto any words of affection, which came from any
mouth but of that kind Shepherd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leonide</hi> then went to meet <hi>Paris;</hi> and the two Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es went towards the
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide,</hi> whom they found looking upon an old willow which time had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed,
and which retained no more of it <U+017F>elf but a hollow bulk, and a withered bark:
Oh Willow! <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi> to her <U+017F>elf, what is become of the<U+017F>e letters which I tru<U+017F>ted
thee with all? And why do<U+017F>t thou not render me the <U+017F>ame good offices thou wert
wont, in a<U+017F><U+017F>uring me of my Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es good will? For thou <U+017F>ee<U+017F>t me now with
no le<U+017F>s love nor le<U+017F>s affection then I had at that time: Oh beloved Willow, I know
thy meaning, for had the heart of my Faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e retained the memory
of my <U+017F>ervices, thou vvould<U+017F>t have <U+017F>till retained tho<U+017F>e characters, vvhich vvere the
dear te<U+017F>timonies of her good will; but I <U+017F>ee that time has vvorn both thee, and
them, out of her thoughts; had <U+017F>he <U+017F>poken the<U+017F>e words any louder, the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es
had heard them; but as luck was, <U+017F>he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them unto her <U+017F>elf only in
thought: And becau<U+017F>e they were unwilling to interrupt tho<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ing imaginations,
vvhich they thought <U+017F>he fancied, they <U+017F>topped; and vvhen the <hi>Druide</hi> vvalked, they
did the like, not vvith any intention to di<U+017F>cover any thoughts of her <U+017F>oul, but only
le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould divert her by their pre<U+017F>ence from that which <U+017F>he thought mo<U+017F>t plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing;
<hi>Alexis</hi> then, thinking her <U+017F>elf alone, continued on her thoughts, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvi<U+017F>e
her vvalk along the River <U+017F>ide, until <U+017F>he found a Tree on her right hand, where
two dayes before her unfortunate accident, <U+017F>he had engraved <U+017F>ome ver<U+017F>es, which
te<U+017F>tified vvith how much con<U+017F>traint <U+017F>he courted the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Aminthe;</hi> and
ca<U+017F>ting her eyes thereupon, Oh how this <U+017F>ight did vvound her memory!</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the reading of tho<U+017F>e vvords had made her <U+017F>peak <U+017F>omething <U+017F>o loud as to
be heard by tho<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, which followed her, if by fortune <hi>Sylvander</hi> at
the <U+017F>ame time had not a far off began to <U+017F>ing; and the voice came <U+017F>o di<U+017F>tinctly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, that <hi>Alexis</hi> turning her head that way, e<U+017F>pied the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es
clo<U+017F>e by her; <U+017F>hee vvas <U+017F>orry to <U+017F>ee them <U+017F>o neer, and perceive them no <U+017F>ooner,
fearing le<U+017F>t her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had made her utter <U+017F>ome vvord, or u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome action, vvhich
might di<U+017F>cover vvhat <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to conceal: But that which mo<U+017F>t troubled her vvas
her eyes, vvhich vvere full of tears, and which being <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed <U+017F>he could not hide;
yet faining not to <U+017F>ee them, <U+017F>he turned the other way, and vviped her eyes as well
as <U+017F>he could, and then <U+017F>etting a good face upon it, <U+017F>he came unto them, and bad
them good morrow, calling them <U+017F>luggards, and faining <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>leep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
the pretty birds began to <U+017F>ing <U+017F>o <U+017F>weety at her chamber-window: It was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they troubled you. No indeed, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Alexis,</hi> for I took <U+017F>o much delight in their Mu<U+017F>ick: that I could not chu<U+017F>e but ri<U+017F>e
to hear them more plainly as I walked by this River <U+017F>ide; and I think the time <U+017F>o
<U+017F>hort, that it <U+017F>eems not above a quarter of an hour <U+017F>ince I came hither. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana</hi>) you have <U+017F>lept <U+017F>o little, that I fear it will do you <U+017F>ome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury:
It is true indeed, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> and you may <U+017F>ee my eyes have done pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for it; but I was <U+017F>o much delighted in hearing the warble of the<U+017F>e pretty
birds, and in taking the fre<U+017F>h ayr, that it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to receive any harm. The
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53527:110"/>
be<U+017F>t remedy will be, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> to go to bed betimes at night, that you may
enjoy your re<U+017F>t and <U+017F>leep before the day do break, and before the<U+017F>e little chanters
of the wood begin to <U+017F>ing; and then we <U+017F>hall Madam be glad to bear you company,
and carry you unto places which are better furni<U+017F>hed with this kind of harmony.
<hi>Alexis</hi> offered to reply when <hi>Sylvander</hi> began to <U+017F>ing, and becau<U+017F>e they <U+017F>pied
<hi>Phillis</hi> coming towards them, they <U+017F>tayed for her, while<U+017F>t <hi>Sylvander</hi> <U+017F>ung. <hi>Phillis</hi>
being come unto them; after <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aluted the <hi>Druide</hi> and her company: Madam,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, how do you like this Shepherds voice? I like it very well, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi>
and think him to be a very well accompli<U+017F>hed Shepherd, and a very perfect lover.
Madam, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> and both <U+017F>miled and blu<U+017F>hed) perhaps you may be mi<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in your judgement of him; for the Shepherds of <hi>Lignon,</hi> do often hide di<U+017F><U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<U+017F>ouls under the innocent habit which they wear. Perhaps indeed, replied the
<hi>Druide,</hi> that this may be <U+017F>o in <U+017F>ome, but I am mo<U+017F>t confident, I am not mi<U+017F>taken
in my opinion of this Shepherd. Tell her Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and interrupted her)
that <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf thinks the <U+017F>ame; and that if the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon</hi> were not
greater di<U+017F><U+017F>emblers then this Shepherd, <U+017F>he would not have <U+017F>poken <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he did.
Si<U+017F>ter replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I am much beholding to your rallary: for <U+017F>peaking thus of
me in the pre<U+017F>ence of this <hi>Druide,</hi> you will infu<U+017F>e a <U+017F>trange opinion of me into her.
Do not fear (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi> and <U+017F>miled) that the<U+017F>e words can make me believe any
thing of you but good: I know the virtue and merits of <hi>Diana</hi> very well; be<U+017F>ides,
di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation is <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary unto our <U+017F>ex: as it may well be taken for a
kind of virtue. But <U+017F>ince we have gone <U+017F>o far, give me leave to tell you out of my
affection to you, what <hi>Phillis</hi> hath formerly <U+017F>aid unto your dear friend here, upon
the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject: Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> you will do me an honour in it, but
the wor<U+017F>t is, I fear it is nothing worthy of your paines, which you can tell me that
concerns my <U+017F>elf. I make no doubt, wi<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) but you have
often heard the <U+017F>ame which I <U+017F>hall tell you: but becau<U+017F>e we are all oftentimes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
in our cau<U+017F>es, and becau<U+017F>e the advice of friends will do no harm, I will tell you
what di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and I, had ye<U+017F>terday, concerning you: and I <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
al<U+017F>o to give her advice, becau<U+017F>e I know you have a great confidence in them
both. Upon this, <U+017F>he related unto <hi>Diana</hi> all the con<U+017F>iderations which they had
upon <hi>Sylvanders</hi> love: and after they had all concluded, that it was no fiction nor
by rea<U+017F>on of the wager, but reall and in good earne<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he continued thus: Now
Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> it concerns you to con<U+017F>ider well upon it; as for <hi>Sylvander,</hi> to love or
not to love you, does not depend upon him, he has but the choice of the<U+017F>e two
wayes, either to grieve, or to live happily with you, even as you <U+017F>hall appoint.</p>
                     <p>But upon you does depend not only his mi<U+017F>ery, and his happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, but your own
al<U+017F>o: And though I may believe that perhaps you are not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of tho<U+017F>e tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which his love inflicts upon him; yet I conceive it very hard that one <U+017F>hould
be loved, and <U+017F>erved <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creetly by <U+017F>uch a very excellently qualified Shepherd, and
have no <U+017F>park of good will towards him: but however it be, can you think to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
your <U+017F>elf from all the torment of it? And that you are not acce<U+017F><U+017F>ary unto his?
You are mi<U+017F>taken, wi<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, if you be in that opinion; for if you <U+017F>hould
forbid him to love you, you may as well do nothing; for you may be certain he
will not obey: and if by any rigorous language, you command him to get out of
your <U+017F>ight, then the violence of his affection, will <U+017F>o divulge it <U+017F>elf all over the
Country, as perhaps not a Shepherd but will know it: So as I <U+017F>ee the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is unevitable, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you re<U+017F>olve upon <U+017F>ome wi<U+017F>e expedient. All tho<U+017F>e that
know <hi>Sylvander,</hi> do think him a Shepherd <U+017F>o amiable, as they think there is not a
Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, but may well daign to love him, and that the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e whom he
loves may, if <U+017F>he have any wit, very well do the like: what opinion then will the
world have of <hi>Diana,</hi> whom every one knows to have wit, and judgement, when
they <U+017F>ee how this Shepherd loves her, <U+017F>erves her, and adores her with <U+017F>o much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
I <U+017F>hall by way of advice propo<U+017F>e two wayes unto you, the one of which I
conceive more <U+017F>afe then the other: The one way is, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee it a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to divert this Shepherd from his affection to you, permit him to <U+017F>erve you <U+017F>ecretly;
and this permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion will be a way by joyning his prudence unto yours, to hide this
affection from all <U+017F>uch as have nothing el<U+017F>e to do, but cen<U+017F>ure and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y into the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53527:110"/>
of others. But if you do not love this Shepherd, this coun<U+017F>el is naught; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
this <U+017F>ecret corre<U+017F>pondency will oblige you unto certain indulgencies, and te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of affection, which may co<U+017F>t you very dear: Therefore I conceive this other
expedient to be better; Let him continue that gui<U+017F>e in which he hath hitherto <U+017F>erved
you; by this permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, his flame will not fla<U+017F>h with <U+017F>uch violence: and if by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o break out that every one takes notice of it, they wil not at all think it
<U+017F>trange, becau<U+017F>e he is already accu<U+017F>tomed unto it: and his Court<U+017F>hip being under
that pretence of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, they will not think he loves you in earne<U+017F>t: I know
there will be <U+017F>ome malevolent minds that will be <U+017F>pending their cen<U+017F>ures, but who
can avoid the la<U+017F>h of <U+017F>uch tongues? But mo<U+017F>t will not believe it: And the be<U+017F>t thing
of this way is, you will not be obliged unto him: For there is nothing <U+017F>o dangerous,
as for a woman to commit her <U+017F>elf unto the di<U+017F>cretion of him <U+017F>he loves; becau<U+017F>e
mo<U+017F>t men being naturally of a wavering temper, when they change their affection,
they will not for all that lo<U+017F>e the memory of things pa<U+017F>t; but on the contrary, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make them<U+017F>elves the more e<U+017F>teemed, they blaze them abroad, and brag how
much they have been loved by <U+017F>uch a one; and the bad condition of our age being
as it is, and people more apt to believe the evil then the good, it is pre<U+017F>ently believed
that <U+017F>uch a woman is a very loving <U+017F>oul, who will love more then <U+017F>he is loved. Now
Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> by permitting him to continue his gui<U+017F>e of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, you will not be
in any danger this way, becau<U+017F>e you are not obliged to render him any knowledge
of your good will: But on the contrary, may take his real affection as if it were Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and he cannot complain again<U+017F>t you. This al<U+017F>o is another thing con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this cour<U+017F>e: I know very well that <hi>Diana</hi> has a little vanity, and good rea<U+017F>on
has <U+017F>he for it, being a Sherherde<U+017F>s <U+017F>o full of perfections, and the principal in all this
Country; on the contrary, <hi>Sylvander</hi> being a per<U+017F>on unknown, and Owner of no
Fortune but what his own Indu<U+017F>try can get, I am afraid that <hi>Diana</hi> would blu<U+017F>h if
any <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee her allow of any real addre<U+017F>s from a Shepherd <U+017F>o much her inferiour.
But fair Shepherde<U+017F>s, you are by this expedient, exempt from this inconveniency,
having a good excu<U+017F>e when you receive his complements of Love, as if all were but
in je<U+017F>t, to exerci<U+017F>e his wit, and <U+017F>harpen it with feigned conceptions of an imaginary
Love.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Alexis</hi> ended; and when <hi>Diana</hi> would have an<U+017F>wered, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> interrupted
her: Nay, nay Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) there is no more to be <U+017F>aid, after this fair <hi>Druide;</hi>
She has cleared all doubts that could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be fore<U+017F>een, and fully an<U+017F>wered them,
<U+017F>o as I <U+017F>hall not think you to be <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e as I ever took you, if you do not follow her
coun<U+017F>el; <hi>Phillis</hi> I am confident will be of the <U+017F>ame opinion. But one thing does a
little <U+017F>cruple me, again<U+017F>t which a remedy may haply be applyed; which is, That if
<hi>Diana</hi> do permit this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed Court<U+017F>hip of this Shepherd, <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t have a good
occa<U+017F>ion for the permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, otherwi<U+017F>e I am afraid the Artifice <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And you know, Madam, that if one he found jugling in one trick, all the re<U+017F>t
of their actions will be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected. Never trouble your <U+017F>elf (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) about that,
for <hi>Sylvander</hi> him<U+017F>elf did ye<U+017F>terday give an excellent occa<U+017F>ion to colour the permi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion:
For <hi>Diana</hi> told me, the la<U+017F>t night when we were retired, that <hi>Sylvander</hi> having
obtained leave to continue his Court<U+017F>hip all the re<U+017F>t of the day, he pretended that
this permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion was to la<U+017F>t alwaies; and both he and <U+017F>he falling in difference about it,
the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was referred unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and my <U+017F>elf; and <U+017F>hould have been determined
that <U+017F>ame night: But becau<U+017F>e <hi>Diana</hi> was not willing the matter <U+017F>hould be argued in
Publique, and both you, Madam, and <hi>Leonide</hi> being in the chamber, the difference
was deferred until another time; and <hi>Sylvander</hi> accompanying me to my Lodging,
he told me how glad he <U+017F>hould be if it could be deferred, becau<U+017F>e till then he might
enjoy his Priviledge: There is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity therefore, that the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>hould be
made <U+017F>o private; but on the contrary, I am of opinion, that the matter is to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
in <U+017F>ome publique place; to the end, that when all do <U+017F>ee <hi>Sylvander</hi> continue
his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to <hi>Diana,</hi> they may know it is upon the old <U+017F>core as he begun it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did very well approve of this advice; and <hi>Diana,</hi> who perhaps
did like of it as well as they, and till then <U+017F>tood mute, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to be convinced by
the rea<U+017F>ons of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and the approbation of her two dear friends; <U+017F>o as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved,
that the difference <U+017F>hould come to hearing at <U+017F>uch a time when <hi>Adamas, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon,</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53527:111"/>
and <hi>Daphnide</hi> were pre<U+017F>ent; and that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>hould give judgment
in the behalf of <hi>Sylvander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As fortune was, <hi>Sylvander</hi> hearing the voices of the<U+017F>e fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>o near
him, he turned that way, and <U+017F>pied them; and <U+017F>eeing all their backs towards him,
being prompted by a Lovers curio<U+017F>ity, he got as near them as he could un<U+017F>een; and
creeping upon the ground, he got behind a Bu<U+017F>h which was within two or three pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the place where they were <U+017F>et; <U+017F>o li<U+017F>tning attentively, he heard what <hi>Alexis</hi>
had propounded, and what was re<U+017F>olved upon. Oh how much did he think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
obliged unto that fair <hi>Druide,</hi> for giving <U+017F>uch coun<U+017F>el unto <hi>Diana?</hi> And when
they went away, he did accompany them with a thou<U+017F>and wi<U+017F>hes of happine<U+017F>s: and
when he <U+017F>aw them <U+017F>o far off as they could not think he heard them, he ro<U+017F>e up and
followed; and to make them look back, he began to play upon his Corner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> who loved this Shepherd very well, as one whom <U+017F>he ranked in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of her be<U+017F>t friends: Come <hi>Sylvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) Do you not think
your <U+017F>elf much obliged unto me for bringing the fair <hi>Diana</hi> hither? For had I not
been, <U+017F>he would have been <U+017F>till in her chamber, and you deprived of your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
in <U+017F>eeing her. Madam, an<U+017F>wered the Shepherd, you cannot do me <U+017F>o great a
favour, as I expected always from your fair face. Why (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) does my face
promi<U+017F>e you <U+017F>o much? Yes Madam (replyed <hi>Sylvander</hi>) for it has <U+017F>uch a lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emblance
of a Shepherd who would have expo<U+017F>ed his life for my contentment, as I
can think no le<U+017F>s. I am very glad (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis</hi>) that Nature has been <U+017F>o favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
unto me, as to make me like unto any whom you love; for I make no doubt,
but though I do not de<U+017F>erve it, yet you will love me for his <U+017F>ake. Madam, replied
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> were he alive, I <U+017F>hould love him for your <U+017F>ake; your merits being <U+017F>o
high. as not to yeild unto any: And to let you <U+017F>ee the truth of my words, I will put
my life into your hands, if you will be plea<U+017F>ed to take <U+017F>o much pains as to judge a
difference which is dearer unto me then my life. Shepherd, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> Why
would you change the Judges which you have already cho<U+017F>en? Not but that I am
willing to <U+017F>ubmit unto what<U+017F>oever the fair <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>hall ordain; but me-thinks it is a
<U+017F>igne you know your cau<U+017F>e to be bad, and would corrupt your Judges by flatteries,
and reject tho<U+017F>e who are already cho<U+017F>en. I did not think, faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> That any prai<U+017F>es which one could give unto this fair Lady, was e<U+017F>teemed
flattery; for merit cannot be flattered, nor can any flattery equal her perfections.
I would not have you think I refu<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e Judges which you were plea<U+017F>ed to chu<U+017F>e;
But I propounded this fair <hi>Druide</hi> only to be an Umpire in ca<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e two Judges
cannot agree among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves; and that then <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould ordain what <U+017F>he thought
mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>onant to Ju<U+017F>tice. I cannot deny (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana</hi>) the advantagious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
which you give of this fair Lady, nor any commendation that can be given her,
and therefore I do mo<U+017F>t willingly accept her for our Umpire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sylvander</hi> would have replied, had they not <U+017F>een coming <hi>Adamas, Daphnide, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon,</hi>
and all the company which <U+017F>upped the night before at the hou<U+017F>e of old <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
except <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> who parted from the re<U+017F>t of the company, to fini<U+017F>h
the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which they had begun in the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas:</hi> for <hi>Paris</hi> adoring <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
beyond all mea<U+017F>ure, and having received from her another kind of an<U+017F>wer then
he de<U+017F>ired, he would take <hi>Leonides</hi> coun<U+017F>el in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; and <U+017F>he being very affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
to him, was willing to give him the be<U+017F>t advice <U+017F>he could: And therefore
retiring them<U+017F>elves into the Grove of <hi>Hazles,</hi> Brother (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) I have
twice deferred the giving you my opinion in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s whereof you <U+017F>poke, hoping
that time would alter your mind; but now, <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee nothing will work any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in it: I be<U+017F>eech you tell me what your intention is. Si<U+017F>ter, replied <hi>Paris,</hi>
my intention is, to Court <hi>Diana</hi> in the way of marriage. And do you think (<U+017F>aid
<hi>Leonide</hi>) that <hi>Adamas</hi> will approve of it, for you ought to have a <U+017F>pecial con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of that? I have not expre<U+017F>ly acquainted him with it (<U+017F>aid <hi>Paris</hi>) but he
knows that I do love her, and does not di<U+017F>approve of it. This (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide</hi>)
is not enough; you ought to acquaint him with it <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, and ask his con<U+017F>ent. In
the <U+017F>econd place, which indeed ought to be the fir<U+017F>t, you ought to con<U+017F>ider <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly
with your <U+017F>elf, whether this marriage be fit and convenient for you: For Love is a
partial Judge, and many things are hand<U+017F>ome in a Mi<U+017F>tris, which are in<U+017F>ufferable in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53527:111"/>
a Wife. Oh Brother, there is abundance of difference betwixt Love and Marriage:
for Love la<U+017F>ts no longer then one plea<U+017F>eth, but Marriage mu<U+017F>t continue long, and
therefore is more di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing: Love is an Embleme of Liberty, becau<U+017F>e it never
forceth the Will; but Marriage on the contrary is an Embleme of <U+017F>ervitude; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
nothing but death can break the Bonds. 'Tis true, when a marriage is made
between fit and <U+017F>utable per<U+017F>ons, I believe there is no greater happine<U+017F>s among<U+017F>t mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
becau<U+017F>e all joys and contentments are doubled; the joy of the one, is the joy
of the other: And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch is the mi<U+017F>ery of all Mortals, as they are <U+017F>ubject
unto a thou<U+017F>and di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters of Fortune, a faithful companion in marriage, does help to
bear the burthen of them. To be brief, it is almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to enjoy any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
happine<U+017F>s without a <U+017F>econd <U+017F>elf, unto whom all things may be communicated.
But <hi>Paris,</hi> give me leave to tell you, that the man who marries, mu<U+017F>t not con<U+017F>ult
altogether with his eyes, or his de<U+017F>ires; but with his rea<U+017F>on and judgement; and
you mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider whether there be any thing de<U+017F>irable in <hi>Diana</hi> be<U+017F>ides her Beauty,
not only as a Mi<U+017F>tris, but al<U+017F>o as a Wife: For Beauty does ordinarily deceive, and is
often like an Inn-<U+017F>igne before a poor Inn, where no good accomodations can be had.
Beauty re<U+017F>embles tho<U+017F>e Spectacles which makes every thing look greater then they
are, and is at be<U+017F>t but a fair fading Flower, which when once decayed, and one is
tyed unto it, repentance comes too late: So much in con<U+017F>ideration of Beauty. Then
Brother, Great heed mu<U+017F>t be taken that nothing be done which may redound unto
your di<U+017F>honour and reproach; You are <U+017F>on unto the Grand <hi>Druide; Diana</hi> I mu<U+017F>t
needs confe<U+017F>s is a Shepherde<U+017F>s of much merit, but yet <U+017F>he is a Shepherde<U+017F>s; and do
you think that <U+017F>uch Alliance will not be much wondred at? We are not born for our
<U+017F>elves; we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>omtimes leave our own contentment, for the <U+017F>atisfaction of tho<U+017F>e
who love us, and tho<U+017F>e unto whom we are obliged: Con<U+017F>ider Brother, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is the happine<U+017F>s or the mi<U+017F>ery of every one: and therefore be not too ra<U+017F>h in
your actions. But to wave all the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, this only is enough for all: That
one had better be a Gally-<U+017F>lave, and be tyed to <U+017F>erve a Tyrant, then marry one that
loves him not; Imagine Brother, What delight can one find in eating, or drinking,
lying, or <U+017F>leeping with his enemy? It is requi<U+017F>ite therefore that you know her mind;
For if <U+017F>he do love another, or cannot love you, I would advi<U+017F>e you to marry a grave,
rather then <hi>Diana.</hi> Think well upon all the<U+017F>e things; and after you have <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly
con<U+017F>idered them, tell me what you think of them, then I will further tell you what I
conceive be<U+017F>t to be done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paris</hi> hearing <hi>Leonide</hi> <U+017F>peak with <U+017F>o much con<U+017F>ideration and eagerne<U+017F>s, did think
at fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>igne to marry him <U+017F>omwhere el<U+017F>e, and therefore de<U+017F>ired
to divert him from <hi>Diana;</hi> But afterwards <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly con<U+017F>idering her rea<U+017F>ons, and
finding much <U+017F>olidity in them, he altered his opinion, and found that all <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid
proceeded from her affection to him: and therefore he returned her this an<U+017F>wer:
That it was true, he ought to acquaint <hi>Adamas</hi> with his intention; That he did not
doubt but to find him a very good Father, as formerly he had upon all other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions:
That as for the conditions of <hi>Diana,</hi> It was meer folly to di<U+017F>pute upon a
thing that was already re<U+017F>olved: and that he could as well live without a <U+017F>oul, as live
happily without her; and that this did an<U+017F>wer all tho<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations. That as for
the approbation of his Parents, he thought none of them did love him better then
he did him<U+017F>elf, and that therefore he was obliged to <U+017F>atisfie and content him<U+017F>elf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Kindred or Friends. That as for the good Will and Affection of <hi>Diana;</hi>
It is true indeed, Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid he) I mu<U+017F>t ask your coun<U+017F>el upon that point; for you
being a woman as <U+017F>he is, you may better judge of her intention then I, who<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
perhaps has di<U+017F>turbed my judgement. I have <U+017F>everal times attempted to know
her Will; and the la<U+017F>t time <U+017F>he was at the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> when we walked <U+017F>o
long together, I complained unto her, that all my <U+017F>ervices were <U+017F>o ill accepted, and
almo<U+017F>t thrown away: unto which <U+017F>he returned me an an<U+017F>wer full of courte<U+017F>ie and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility:
And when I replied, that it was neither courte<U+017F>ie nor civility, but only Love
which I looked for from her; <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, That <U+017F>he did honour me as much as any
man in the world, and loved me as well as any Si<U+017F>ter could love a Brother; and told
me; that this was all <U+017F>he was able to do. But when I reply'd that my de<U+017F>igne and
hopes was to marry her; <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered me, that <U+017F>he had Parents who had the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53527:112"/>
of her, and <U+017F>he alwayes referred <U+017F>uch things unto their di<U+017F>cretions: But
<hi>Paris</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) if you will know my mind, let me tell you, that, I do not intend to
marry, either you or any el<U+017F>e; no nor ever will, I will alwayes love you as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but never as a Husband: upon this, Si<U+017F>ter, we were interrupted, and I would not
urge her any further, until I had your advice, how to behave my <U+017F>elf: I conjure
you therefore by the affection you have ever expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed towards me, to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me:
for to think of diverting my affection to her, is meer folly, becau<U+017F>e death only is
able to do it. Brother (<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide</hi> and <U+017F>miled) you ask my advice in a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s,
which it <U+017F>eemes you are re<U+017F>olved upon; but I beleeve your de<U+017F>ire is I <U+017F>hould tell
you, how you <U+017F>hould demean your <U+017F>elf to win the affection of this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e:
and truly, <U+017F>ince you are in <U+017F>uch an extremity as you <U+017F>ay you are, I conceive your
be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e is to obtain leave of her to <U+017F>peak unto her Parents; for they, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e
con<U+017F>idering the advantage which will accrue unto <hi>Diana</hi> by it, will not be again<U+017F>t
the propo<U+017F>ition: and <U+017F>hee who is very wi<U+017F>e, and one that hath alwayes carried her
<U+017F>elf with abundance of prudence and virtue, <U+017F>he dares not be again<U+017F>t their opinion,
lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be thought either wilful or in love with <U+017F>ome other, or el<U+017F>e tax her
di<U+017F>cretion: Thus may <U+017F>he before <U+017F>he be aware, engage her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o far, that <U+017F>he
cannot hand<U+017F>omly retire. But my opinion is, that your be<U+017F>t way is, not to <U+017F>peak
unto her untill the very day we depart from hence, to the end, that if you do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this leave, <U+017F>he may not know where to find you, in ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>he have a mind to
revoke it again, or at the lea<U+017F>t not find you before you have made the overture unto
<U+017F>ome of her Parents.</p>
                     <p>This was the opinion of <hi>Leonide,</hi> which <hi>Paris</hi> re<U+017F>olved to follow; And while<U+017F>t
they were thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing, <hi>Adamas</hi> and all the Company joyned with them. And
becau<U+017F>e <hi>Sylvander</hi> was grown very bold, by the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which he had heard, as
<U+017F>oon as all complements were pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf unto <hi>Diana:</hi> Mi<U+017F>tris,
(<U+017F>aid he aloud) I <U+017F>hall not refu<U+017F>e the judgement of tho<U+017F>e whom you appointed, <U+017F>o
you will but be plea<U+017F>ed to do the like: you need not que<U+017F>tion, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) but I
<U+017F>hall con<U+017F>ent unto it, <U+017F>ince I know my cau<U+017F>e to be good, and made choice of my
Judges: The difference (replied <hi>Sylvander</hi>) needs not <U+017F>o much arguing, as that
betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and me; and therefore, I be<U+017F>eech you, that without any more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
the matter may be judged. I <U+017F>hall never be again<U+017F>t it (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana</hi>) <U+017F>ince
I hope for a decree to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e on my <U+017F>ide. For my part, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I derive
all my right and title from the permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion which you gave me, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
my behaviour towards you always, as I did during the wager betwixt <hi>Phillis,</hi>
and me: How, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> did I ever permit you to continue alwayes <U+017F>o? Good
Shepherd, do you take one day, for alwayes? And yet I permitted you the re<U+017F>t of
the day only, which being ended, you was not to make any more u<U+017F>e of your fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I be<U+017F>eech you Mi<U+017F>tris, (<U+017F>aid he) do you remember how you permitted me
to end that day which remained after the judgement, as I had begun it, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
my behaviour, as I did before? It is very true, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) but that day is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and I have begun another. You had good rea<U+017F>on, fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, (<U+017F>aid he)
to <U+017F>ay that you began another day; becau<U+017F>e it is the quality of the Sun to begin and
limit days, and you are the Sun of all our Horizon; and therefore you cannot <U+017F>ay,
that the day which you granted unto me is ended: For I be<U+017F>eech you, faire<U+017F>t Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tris,
as long as the light continues, does not the day continue al<U+017F>o? I confe<U+017F>s it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Diana;</hi> but you mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s al<U+017F>o, that when the Sun is <U+017F>et, and cannot be
<U+017F>een, it is night. I do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e it, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and thereupon I have gained
what I asked: for my <U+017F>oul and my eyes acknowledging no other Sun, but tho<U+017F>e glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
rayes of your beauty, and perfection, mo<U+017F>t certainly as long as I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of this Light, and of this Sun, it is not night unto me: and <U+017F>ince it is not
night, have I not good rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ay, that the day which you allowed me was not
ended; but on the contrary that it will la<U+017F>t as long as I live, becau<U+017F>e your beauty,
and your merits, will be alwayes in my <U+017F>oul? <hi>Diana</hi> a little <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, or at lea<U+017F>t
<U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o, returned this an<U+017F>wer; I cannot deny, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) but that when you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
me leave for a day, you might mean <U+017F>uch a day as you <U+017F>peak of: but I know
that the day which I granted, was only one of our natural days. Faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris,
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) things that are ambiguous and doubtful, ought to be interpreted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53527:112"/>
to the advantage of the poor, and him that begs: Liberality and Genero<U+017F>ity, are
qualities <U+017F>o becoming a Noble <U+017F>oul, as I am confident, O my Judges, that you will
not dimini<U+017F>h the lea<U+017F>t of what is the fair <hi>Dianas</hi> due, <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>miled and <U+017F>aid, For
my part, under the favour of <hi>Astrea</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs condemn <hi>Diana,</hi>
and think <hi>Sylvander</hi> in the right; becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e who give, ought to re<U+017F>train and
explain their gifts, if they do not intend to give all that is asked: for otherwi<U+017F>e it is
to be believed, it is in the <U+017F>ame intention that he had who receives the benefit. Ah
me! cryed out <hi>Diana,</hi> I am afraid my cau<U+017F>e will go again<U+017F>t me: for I know <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
will accord unto all that <hi>Alexis</hi> thinks good; and <hi>Phillis</hi> will not contradict <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi>
And I <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas,</hi> do ordain, that if <hi>Sylvander</hi> do hereafter re<U+017F>ent the power of
a beauty in good earne<U+017F>t, he <U+017F>hall not complain, neither of <hi>Diana</hi> nor his Judges,
but of him<U+017F>elf only, who was the procurer of his own mi<U+017F>ery, and that the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s
<U+017F>hall not be obliged by his <U+017F>ervices to pity him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>aid this, becau<U+017F>e he had a de<U+017F>ign to give <hi>Paris</hi> unto this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
and <U+017F>eeing that <hi>Sylvander</hi> was not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto her, he was afraid the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of this court<U+017F>hip <U+017F>hould ingage her more. But <hi>Sylvander</hi> <U+017F>eeming to take
no notice of what he <U+017F>aid, but ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing the hands of his Judges, he kneeled down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Diana;</hi> Faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid he unto her, if ever any of my actions do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
that vow, which I make of my faithful and perpetual <U+017F>ervice, let me immediately
be condemned unto the mo<U+017F>t cruel torture, that ever mortal endured. <hi>Diana</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
him, very faintly: Remember Shepherd <U+017F>aid <U+017F>hee, that you are permitted no
farther then to faign and di<U+017F><U+017F>emble, and that I <U+017F>hall take all your actions only as

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sylvander</hi> had replied, had not <hi>Diana,</hi> and all the Company, entred into the
grove of Hazels, and there met <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> who at the <U+017F>ame time were
coming to look them: and after they had walked a while, they all went together
into the hou<U+017F>e to dinner, where they found the Table furni<U+017F>hed with many delicate
varieties, far above the rate of a Country Village.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lerindas,</hi> lea<U+017F>t the Nimph <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>hould think him long, he made all the ha<U+017F>t

de<U+017F>irous to plea<U+017F>e his Lady, he made <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>t, that he was there again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dinner. Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto her, <hi>Adamas</hi> cannot retard the <U+017F>acrifice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
the people were already a<U+017F><U+017F>embled; but becau<U+017F>e I told him you were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irous
to <U+017F>ee the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon,</hi> he <U+017F>ends you word, that if you <U+017F>tay any
time here, he will bring them all hither. I am very <U+017F>orry, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that I
cannot <U+017F>hew this <U+017F>acrifice unto the Generous Damon, that he al<U+017F>o might have <U+017F>een
the<U+017F>e fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es; but if <hi>Adamas</hi> keep his word, we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee them as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
here; which if we do not, we cannot better imploy our time then in going
to their Town. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cleontine,</hi> <U+017F>ince <hi>Adamas</hi> has <U+017F>aid it, you may
be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured he will doo't: Doubtle<U+017F>s he will come before he return to his hou<U+017F>e, and
will be glad that all tho<U+017F>e fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>hould accompany <hi>Alexis,</hi> when he
pre<U+017F>ents her unto you. But as to <hi>Alexis</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> unto <hi>Lerindas</hi>) is <U+017F>he as
full of beauty as they report her to be? For I know thou art a per<U+017F>on of judgement,
and would be <U+017F>ure to view her: Madam, <U+017F>he is fair, an<U+017F>wered he, but in my mind
there are three others which are fairer, and plea<U+017F>e me more; and <U+017F>ince you ask
me, I had rather tel you <U+017F>o, then let <hi>Leonide</hi> have that advantage of me: I am of
opinion Madam, that if they were changed for your Nimphs, you would have the
faire<U+017F>t women in the world to wait upon you. How <hi>Lerindus?</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi>)
do<U+017F>t thou think them fairer then my Nimphs? Then your Nimphs Madam? an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
he, Yes, yes, Fairer then all the Nimphs in the world. What <hi>Lerindas?</hi> (<U+017F>aid
<hi>Galathea</hi>) are they Fairer then I am? Ah Madam, (an<U+017F>wered he, and was a little
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed) I <U+017F>peak not of you, for you are the Lady and Mi<U+017F>tris of all Nimphs; but
I <U+017F>ay, that all others mu<U+017F>t yield unto them in beauty, for they are as much above
your Nimphs in beauty, as your Nimphs are above me. You <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvia,</hi>
that <hi>Lerindas</hi> is faln in love. Love (an<U+017F>wered he with a di<U+017F>daining look) Nay, I
<U+017F>hould never fall in Love, with them, if they were as <U+017F>cornful as you. <hi>Galathea</hi>
then laughed extreamly; Certainly, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>Silvia</hi> is in the right, <hi>Lerindas</hi> is a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
in Love with one of the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es: but which of the three does plea<U+017F>e
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53527:113"/>
the be<U+017F>t? Stay a little Madam (an<U+017F>wered he) I cannot upon a <U+017F>udden re<U+017F>olve you:
The one has more Attracts, The other has more Mode<U+017F>ty, The third more Beauty:
The fir<U+017F>t is called <hi>Daphnide,</hi> the <U+017F>econd <hi>Diana,</hi> the third <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf
replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> that this <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is the faire<U+017F>t, Is <U+017F>he not <hi>Lerindas?</hi> Certainly <U+017F>he
is, <U+017F>aid he, and <hi>Diana</hi> is more mode<U+017F>t, and <hi>Daphnide</hi> more attractive. To tell you
truly, Attracts do much take me, Mode<U+017F>ty does much move me, but I love Beauty
be<U+017F>t of all: And therefore I conclude, that if I be in Love, it mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity be
with <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> Believe it Madam, when you <U+017F>ee them, you will <U+017F>ay that I am a man
of judgement; and <hi>Silara,</hi> as di<U+017F>dainful as <U+017F>he is, would be glad to change Beauty
with them. Then <hi>Galathea</hi> turned towards <hi>Cleontine,</hi> Mother <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her I
be<U+017F>eech you what does <hi>Celidea</hi> think of the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es? Madam, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Cleontine,</hi> always when <U+017F>he begins to commend them, <U+017F>he will never almo<U+017F>t make an
end<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>o as you will think her in love with them as well as <hi>Lerindas:</hi> But indeed I
never heard her <U+017F>peak of this <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and if you plea<U+017F>e, I will call <hi>Lerindas</hi> to
give you more particular <U+017F>atisfaction: And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Galathea</hi> was very de<U+017F>irous to
know all circum<U+017F>tances concerning the<U+017F>e Fair ones, <U+017F>he called for him. But Mother,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Cleontine,</hi> I could wi<U+017F>h you would <U+017F>end for <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>lidea,</hi> that we might
have a full relation from her. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lerindas,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, you will hardly
<U+017F>peak with her this night it is <U+017F>o late; for I left her near the Temple of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> where <U+017F>he was to offer a Sacrifice, and <hi>Thamires</hi> with her: But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<U+017F>he can tell you no more then I can, either concerning their Beauty, or any
thing el<U+017F>e. If you de<U+017F>ire to know who this <hi>Daphnide</hi> is, I can tell you, <U+017F>he is a
<U+017F>tranger, late come among<U+017F>t them, with one who<U+017F>e name is <hi>Alcidon:</hi> For though
I <U+017F>tayed not long among<U+017F>t them, yet <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o fair, I enquired who <U+017F>he was. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Cleontine</hi>) it will not be long before <hi>Celidea</hi> and <hi>Thamires</hi> will be here, and
then you may be better informed of all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages.</p>
                     <p>Thus did <hi>Galathea</hi> enquire of the<U+017F>e fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es; and the more <U+017F>he enquired
the rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>he thought <hi>Celadon</hi> had to love <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>ince every one gave her <U+017F>uch a
high Character above others: And Dinner being done, <U+017F>he went to vi<U+017F>it <hi>Damon,</hi>
who <U+017F>tirred not yet out of his chamber, becau<U+017F>e his lo<U+017F>s of blood, and going <U+017F>o far
on foot in his Arms, had <U+017F>o wearied and weakned him, that he was con<U+017F>trained to
keep out of the Ayr, for fear of a further inconvenience. In the mean time <hi>Halla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>
was come unto him, and never <U+017F>tirred from his Beds feet, but waited upon him
with <U+017F>o much care and vigilance, that <hi>Galathea</hi> did much e<U+017F>teem him for it. It was
now the third day <U+017F>ince he received his wounds; and the Nymph who thought her
<U+017F>elf much obliged unto the valour of this Cavalier, for being wounded in defence
of Ladies; moreover, being her Kin<U+017F>man, and injured in her own Dominions and
pre<U+017F>ence, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved never to leave him until he was perfectly recovered: And to
divert him a little, <U+017F>he would have <hi>Lorindas</hi> relate in his pre<U+017F>ence, all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of
his voyage.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the day <U+017F>pent, and when it was night, <hi>Celidea</hi> and <hi>Thamires</hi> returned,
<hi>Galathea</hi> would needs <U+017F>ee them pre<U+017F>ently; as well becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he highly e<U+017F>teemed that
Shepherde<U+017F>s, as becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to know more particularly of tho<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
whom <U+017F>he had vi<U+017F>ited. Come wi<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) tell us, I
be<U+017F>eech you, the news of your Voyage. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, we have done our
duties both unto God and man; for we have offered a <U+017F>acrifice of Thanks unto
<hi>Tautates</hi> for the Mi<U+017F><U+017F>etoe of the New Year; and we have done our duty unto <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
in vi<U+017F>iting his daughter <hi>Alexis:</hi> and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, we are all very well <U+017F>atisfied.
For be plea<U+017F>ed to know Madam, that <hi>Alexis</hi> is the mo<U+017F>t fair, mo<U+017F>t lovely, and mo<U+017F>t
courteous Lady that ever eye beheld; and has given <U+017F>uch contentment to us all, that
there is not one of us who does not even adore her: and <hi>Adamas</hi> has entertain'd
us beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. As for the Sacrifice, the great <hi>Tautates</hi> has well accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of it; for all the victimes were as <U+017F>ound and perfect as we could de<U+017F>ire: The
Mi<U+017F><U+017F>leto which we <U+017F>aw is <U+017F>o large and great, that we call it another Tree that is fixed
unto the Oak, <U+017F>o as our <hi>Druides</hi> have no rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>pare either us or our cattel this
year in our Sacrifices. But be<U+017F>ides this, we have al<U+017F>o been highly delighted with the
Loves of <hi>Hylas</hi> who is the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant humored Shepherd that ever was; that
no diver<U+017F>ion could equal it: Al<U+017F>o we heard the judgement of <hi>Diana</hi> upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover<U+017F>ie
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53527:113"/>
between <hi>Sylvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis;</hi> And the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
was no <U+017F>mall grace unto all the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly. Who is that <hi>Hylas</hi> of whom you
<U+017F>peak, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea?</hi> He is a young man, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celidea,</hi> who falls in love with
all the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es he meets, and maintains, that it is not incon<U+017F>tancy, with <U+017F>uch
plea<U+017F>ant arguments and quirks, as it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to hear him and be <U+017F>ad: For Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
he is not above twenty, or one and twenty years of age, and he reckoned up
above twenty with whom he had been in love, and mo<U+017F>t of them pre<U+017F>ent; The la<U+017F>t
he quitted was the fair and wi<U+017F>e <hi>Alexis;</hi> and God knows for whom: I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you
Madam it is not for a fairer, for he has made choi<U+017F>e of <hi>Stella,</hi> one that is old enough,
and not comparable to the fair <hi>Druide</hi> in point of Beauty.</p>
                     <p>But I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> Does the daughter of <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>uffer him to
<U+017F>erve her, and before the eyes of every one? Yes Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celidea,</hi> but
I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, without any <U+017F>candal; and if you <U+017F>aw her, you would <U+017F>ay as much:
There is not the daughter of any <hi>Druide</hi> whom he does not Court. Nay Madam,
I am confident that if he had the honour to <U+017F>ee you, neither you, nor any of your
Nymphs would e<U+017F>cape his Court<U+017F>hip; for he would expre<U+017F>s his mind at the very
fir<U+017F>t. But what is the judgement of <hi>Diana,</hi> replied <hi>Galathea.</hi> Madam, an<U+017F>wered
the Shepherde<U+017F>s, It hapned upon a time that <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Sylvander</hi> were in a hot di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
which of them had mo<U+017F>t merits to make them<U+017F>elves loved: For <hi>Sylvander,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be as well a qualified Shepherd, as any in all the Country, yet did he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
love any particularly, nor was loved: And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Phillis</hi> did upbraid him that
rea<U+017F>on was his want of courage and merit, and <hi>Sylvander</hi> <U+017F>aid as much by her, they
were both of them condemned by the company to Court <hi>Diana,</hi> and at three months
end, <U+017F>he was to judge which of them won the wager. Doubtle<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Damon, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
would adjudge it on the womans <U+017F>ide. Her judgement, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celidea,</hi> is
<U+017F>omthing doubtful: She adjudged <hi>Phillis</hi> to be more amiable then <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and
that <hi>Sylvander</hi> knew better how to make him<U+017F>elf loved then <hi>Phillis</hi> did. Certainly
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Damon</hi>) <hi>Diana</hi> is a very di<U+017F>creet and wi<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F>s; for I <U+017F>ee <U+017F>he had a mind
to content both; and <U+017F>he has done it with much di<U+017F>cretion. But Madam, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, and turned towards <hi>Galathea,</hi> you have not yet asked her who that <hi>Daphnide</hi>
is? I heard <hi>Lerindas</hi> <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he was one of the faire<U+017F>t of all the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, and I
would gladly know who <U+017F>he and <hi>Alcidon</hi> is, for <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>pects which afterwards I
<U+017F>hall tell you. Then <hi>Thamires</hi> began to <U+017F>peak; Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Damon, Lerindas</hi>
was in the right to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he was fair, for indeed <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o; but he was in the wrong
in <U+017F>aying <U+017F>he was a Shepherde<U+017F>s; for <U+017F>he is not <U+017F>o, but only to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf, does
wear the habit of a Shepherde<U+017F>s: We under<U+017F>tood by <hi>Hylas</hi> that <hi>Daphnide</hi> is one of
the greate<U+017F>t Ladies in the Province of the Romans, and <hi>Alcidon</hi> the greate<U+017F>t Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of King <hi>Euriche,</hi> and that they came into this Country out of curio<U+017F>ity to <U+017F>ee
the Fountain of <hi>Loves Verity.</hi> It is enough (<U+017F>aid <hi>Damon</hi>) and then turning tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
<hi>Galathea,</hi> Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto her, you mu<U+017F>t by all means <U+017F>ee the<U+017F>e two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons,
and be acquainted with them, for <hi>Daphnide</hi> is one of the faire<U+017F>t of all the <hi>Gallo-Ligurians,</hi>
and was highly loved by King <hi>Guricke,</hi> <U+017F>o as had he lived, <U+017F>he had been
his Queen: As for <hi>Alcidon,</hi> I <U+017F>hall commend him unto you, Madam, for the mo<U+017F>t
accompli<U+017F>hed Cavalier in the Court of <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond;</hi> and I <U+017F>aw him <U+017F>o care<U+017F><U+017F>ed and
loved by that King, as he could not give demon<U+017F>trations enough of his good will
towards him. I could relate many things worthy of knowledge, but <U+017F>ince he is <U+017F>o
near you, it is better you know them from his mouth then from mine. <hi>Damon</hi> then
began to whi<U+017F>per with the Nymph, which cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Celidea</hi> to remove a
little further di<U+017F>tant, But Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>Damon</hi> unto her) Is the face of this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s
thus <U+017F>poiled with cutting? She <U+017F>eems to be very wi<U+017F>e and di<U+017F>creet, how came
this misfortune to pa<U+017F>s? The<U+017F>e cuts in her face, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea,</hi> are the mo<U+017F>t
glorious marks that ever woman wore: thereupon <U+017F>he related the whole <U+017F>tory, and
how happily her de<U+017F>igne pro<U+017F>pered <U+017F>ince the fond affection of <hi>Calidon</hi> was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hed,
and the perfect Love of <hi>Thamires</hi> augmented by it, <U+017F>o as never was any
more tenderly loved then <U+017F>he is now in her deformity. <hi>Damon</hi> admired the re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this young woman, e<U+017F>pecially in a Shepherde<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch genero<U+017F>ity is
<U+017F>eldom but among<U+017F>t higher and more noble <U+017F>pirits. You are mi<U+017F>taken, Sir, <U+017F>aid the
Nymph, The Shepherds of this Country are not Shepherds of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53527:114"/>
to keep their flocks, for a livelyhood, but have made choice of this kind of
life, purpo<U+017F>ely to enjoy more tranquillity, and live at ea<U+017F>e: for the truth is, they are
of kin and allied unto the greate<U+017F>t Nobility in all our Dominions. Madam, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Damon,</hi> although the <U+017F>cars in this womans face, were made with the point of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
yet I do know one that can mo<U+017F>t certainly cure them, provided <U+017F>he have <U+017F>o
<U+017F>o much courage, as to do what is requi<U+017F>ite thereto: As for her courage, replied
<hi>Galathea,</hi> you need not doubt <U+017F>o much as her will. How? (replied he and was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed)
has <U+017F>he no will to become fair? Truly, I believe, <U+017F>he is the only woman in the
world who is of that opinion. Call her, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee what <U+017F>he
will <U+017F>ay. Upon which he calling her by her name; <U+017F>he came to know what <hi>Galathea</hi>
would be plea<U+017F>ed to command her. <hi>Celidea,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Nimph, here is a Cavalier who
pittying the mi<U+017F>-fortune of your face, and inquiring how it came to pa<U+017F>s, does <U+017F>ay
that mo<U+017F>t certainly he can get you cured, and make you as fair as ever you were, if
you plea<U+017F>e. Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Damon,</hi> It is mo<U+017F>t undoubtedly true, for when I
was in <hi>Africa,</hi> one of Eudoxes women was wounded in her face with a Diamond,
and <U+017F>o deep that the bone in her cheek did almo<U+017F>t appear; yet there was a skilful
Chirurgion, who wetting a little <U+017F>tick with her blood, did dre<U+017F><U+017F>e the <U+017F>tick with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
called the <hi>Sympathy Salve,</hi> and <U+017F>o cured her again<U+017F>t the opinion of all the
world. And becau<U+017F>e I thought this cure to be very rare; I was <U+017F>o full of curio<U+017F>ity,
as to ask <U+017F>ome of the Salve; but he an<U+017F>wered me, that it was a thing which he could
not give unto any, becau<U+017F>e he was obliged to it by oath: but that when<U+017F>oever I had
any need, if I would but <U+017F>ent unto him a little piece of wood, bloodyed in the wound,
he would pre<U+017F>ently work the cure, though he were a thou<U+017F>and miles di<U+017F>tant, if I
would only keep the wound clean: Therefore Shepherde<U+017F>s, if you would be cured,
you need only but <U+017F>cratch the wound, <U+017F>o as blood may run a little, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee
you will recover your former beauty.</p>
                     <p>Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Celidea,</hi> your kindne<U+017F>s, and the care you have of my face, obliges
me very much unto you for it: but give me leave to tell you, that this beauty, which
you are plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>peak of, is at this time a thing <U+017F>o indifferent unto me, as if I could
recover it again by going to the door, I <U+017F>hould hardly <U+017F>tir a foot that way, if there
was any other way out of the hou<U+017F>e. When I call to memory, what abundance of
trouble, and importunity, it cau<U+017F>ed me, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you Sir, I would rather go out at
the window then that way, or have any corre<U+017F>pondency with it again. Surely,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Damon,</hi> all women have a particular de<U+017F>ire to be fair, or at the lea<U+017F>t not to be
deformed. Tho<U+017F>e who are <U+017F>o eager after beauty, replied <hi>Celidea,</hi> perhaps have
<U+017F>ome de<U+017F>igns to procure the Love of <U+017F>ome who<U+017F>e amity they de<U+017F>ire. But for my
part, I do prote<U+017F>t unto you Sir, that I de<U+017F>ire to be fair only in the eyes of <hi>Thamires,</hi>
and if I would, make my <U+017F>elf invi<U+017F>ible to any el<U+017F>e. Me thinks yet, replied <hi>Damon,</hi>
you <U+017F>hould de<U+017F>ire that <hi>Thamires</hi> <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee you fair. It is very true, replied <U+017F>he,
but I believe the<U+017F>e <U+017F>cars in my face do <U+017F>eem as fair unto him, as all beauty, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of Features can be <U+017F>ince they came unto me only for his <U+017F>ake. This con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
replied the Nimph, may make him have a great opinion of your affection,
goodne<U+017F>s, and virtue; but perhaps he de<U+017F>ires you were fair, as well as virtuous. For
my part, Sir, replied <hi>Celidea,</hi> I am <U+017F>o very well contented, and <U+017F>atisfied, with being
as I am, that I think I <U+017F>hould offend <hi>Tautates,</hi> <U+017F>hould I de<U+017F>ire to be better: yet if
<hi>Thamires</hi> do de<U+017F>ire to have it <U+017F>o, I am mo<U+017F>t ready to do what<U+017F>oever is his plea<U+017F>ure.
Deare<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid <hi>Thamires,</hi> were you never <U+017F>o fair, mo<U+017F>t certainly I could not Love you
better then I do, as you are: But I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that if I thought it were
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to re<U+017F>tore you unto your former beauty, I would <U+017F>pare no paines, or co<U+017F>t,
to procure it; for I am obliged unto it, and <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf mo<U+017F>t ungreatfull,
if I did not: and therefore Sir, <U+017F>aid he to <hi>Damon,</hi> if you know of any remedy, I
be<U+017F>eech you, acquaint me with it, and I <U+017F>hall think my <U+017F>elf eternally obliged unto
you for it. Mo<U+017F>t certainly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Damon,</hi> <U+017F>he will be cured, and without much
pain; for I have <U+017F>een the experience of it. A little <U+017F>tick mu<U+017F>t be wet in the blood
of the wounds, and carried unto the place which I <U+017F>hall direct very carefully; you
will not be above twelve or fifteen daies in going, and I will write unto a Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F>s will pre<U+017F>ently work the cure: Now did <hi>Celidea</hi> hate the very
thought of this beauty <U+017F>ince, for the gaining of it, <U+017F>he was to be <U+017F>o long deprived
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53527:114"/>
of her deare<U+017F>t <hi>Thamires:</hi> Oh Heavens! <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, with teares in her eyes, did I take
<U+017F>o much paines to deprive my <U+017F>elf of this beauty, to buy it now again at <U+017F>o dear a
rate? Ah <hi>Thamires!</hi> content your <U+017F>elf with your <hi>Celidea</hi> as <U+017F>he is; and do not run
your <U+017F>elf into <U+017F>o much hazard of lo<U+017F>ing her for ever. For if you go <U+017F>o far into a
<U+017F>trange Country from her, grief perhaps may bring her to her grave, before your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he is not able to be <U+017F>o long ab<U+017F>ent from you. Ha<U+017F>t thou not told me, a
hundred times <hi>Thamires,</hi> that thou could<U+017F>t live with me as I am, the happie<U+017F>t Shepherd
in the World? And what, dear <hi>Thamires,</hi> needs more? Would<U+017F>t thou be better
then happy? No, no, the joy of my life, enjoy that happine<U+017F>s which Heaven has
given thee, and <U+017F>trive for no more then thou art like to obtain; content thy <U+017F>elf
with what the Gods have thought good for thee to be contented with: If it be for
my <U+017F>ake, deare<U+017F>t <hi>Thamires,</hi> you de<U+017F>ire this beauty, believe it, that your ab<U+017F>ence is
<U+017F>o odious to me, as I had rather die then be deprived of you one week; the journey
I perceive is <U+017F>o long, <U+017F>o full of danger, that I cannot con<U+017F>ent unto it: you are to
go among<U+017F>t the Barbarians, perhaps he unto whom you go, is dead: who knows
whether his receipt be proper to cure me? Perhaps it has his right upon another,
but I am confident the wound which this Cavalier <U+017F>peaks of, was made by <U+017F>ome
piece of gla<U+017F><U+017F>e, or <U+017F>ome other counterfeit <U+017F>tone, and not with a right Diamond:
the wound he <U+017F>peaks of was dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and the receipt applied unto it, as <U+017F>oon as it
was made, but mine is old, and out of all hopes to be helped. But <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I may recover this <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed beauty, by the torments which you will put
me unto, and which at be<U+017F>t is but doubtful: yet <hi>Thamires,</hi> <U+017F>ince I do not value it,
and <U+017F>ince it is only to procure your <U+017F>elf a little more contentment; will you buy
that contentment at a price which is <U+017F>o dear unto me? In the fir<U+017F>t place, you mu<U+017F>t
carry my blood, but alas! the blood is nothing; I would give it all to keep you with
me: but Oh? how many tears will your ab<U+017F>ence cau<U+017F>e? What <U+017F>ighs? What <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows?
What mortal di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures <U+017F>hall I have in this <U+017F>ad <U+017F>eparation? Oh <hi>Thamires!</hi>
did<U+017F>t thou know how thou wilt torment thy <hi>Celidea</hi> by it? I cannot think, that for
<U+017F>uch a fading thing as this beauty, thou would be <U+017F>o long from her. When all is
done, <hi>Thamires,</hi> when after a long and weari<U+017F>ome journey, ful of dangers, thou ha<U+017F>t
brought back with thee this beauty, what will it avail thee Shepherd, if a Feaver, or
<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, or <U+017F>orrow, or the happine<U+017F>s of a child bearing, <U+017F>hould take it away again?
But admit, it do e<U+017F>cape all <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

tears did <U+017F>o accompany her words, that <hi>Damon</hi> was moved unto much compa<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Wi<U+017F>e and di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid he) your virtue makes you admirable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all tho<U+017F>e who know you, and obliges every one to <U+017F>erve you, not only upon this
occa<U+017F>ion, but in all other. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e you have rea<U+017F>on to de<U+017F>ire the pre<U+017F>ence
of <hi>Thamires;</hi> but me thinks you might well di<U+017F>pence with him upon <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet to <U+017F>atisfie you both, I will promi<U+017F>e to bring this Chirurgion hither ere it be
long, and he <U+017F>hall cure your face without parting you from your dearly beloved
Shepherd. Oh Sir! <U+017F>aid <hi>Celidon,</hi> if you will do this favour for a poor Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s,
the great <hi>Tautates</hi> will reward you, for I <U+017F>hall never be able; but I will pray
for your happine<U+017F>s as long as I live.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Damon</hi> admired the virtue and affection of this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, a<U+017F><U+017F>ured her, that
<hi>Thamires</hi> <U+017F>hould not be put unto the trouble of parting from her: And it being late,
the Nimph retired with a re<U+017F>olution to offer her <U+017F>acrifice the next morning, and the
day after to <U+017F>ee the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es: conceiving that <hi>Damon</hi> would be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <U+017F>tir abroad, and by his means, <U+017F>he would try if <U+017F>he could bring back <hi>Daphnide</hi>
and <hi>Alcidon</hi> with her, that <U+017F>he might do them all the honour their merits de<U+017F>erved;
and having made her de<U+017F>ign known unto <hi>Damon,</hi> he prepared him<U+017F>elf, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
de<U+017F>ire to know what his Fortune would be: The morning being come, and
all things ready for the <U+017F>acrifice, <hi>Cleontine</hi> put upon her head a Chaplet of Flowers,
girded her <U+017F>elf about with Vervine, took a branch of Mi<U+017F>sleto in her hand, cau<U+017F>ed
the fire to be kindled, and after the white Buls were <U+017F>acrificed, <U+017F>he <U+017F>prinkled her
<U+017F>elf with <U+017F>ome of the blood, afterwards <U+017F>he <U+017F>prinkled <U+017F>ome upon the Nimph, and
then upon <hi>Damon:</hi> Then throwing the Savine, the Mi<U+017F><U+017F>leto, and the Vervine into
the Fire, <U+017F>he ran to the Vault of <hi>Bellinus,</hi> and touching the Lock with the Branch of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53527:115"/>
Mi<U+017F><U+017F>leto, the door flew open with a great noi<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>he leaning her <U+017F>elf as far into
the Cave as <U+017F>he could, <U+017F>he received the Wind which with a kind of murmuring voice
came out of the Cave: Then, as if in<U+017F>pired with Enthu<U+017F>ia<U+017F>tique Rapture, <U+017F>he ran
unto the place where the Sacrifice was offered, which was in a little Grove near the
Temple, according to the ancient Cu<U+017F>tome; There <U+017F>he found the Nymph and the
Cavalier upon their knees, expecting the an<U+017F>wer of <hi>Bellinus.</hi>

                     <p>The Nymph and the Cavalier having received this Oracle, they <U+017F>tudied a long

                     <p>Oracles, which are the words of the great Gods, are ordinarily rendred very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cure;
becau<U+017F>e future things ought to be concealed from Humanes: For did we
know the hour of our death, we <U+017F>hould not reli<U+017F>h the <U+017F>weets of life, but live as if

Intralls, and blood of all the Sacrifices which we have offered, we expect <U+017F>ome

left <U+017F>ide, and when they did fall, did beat them<U+017F>elves extreamly upon the ground,
and died very impatiently; their blood would hardly come out, and was defective
both in quality and quantity: and as for their Intralls, their Hearts and their Livers
were rotten. To be brief, we <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o many apparent <U+017F>ignes from heaven, that it is

                     <p>As for the Oracle which is rendred unto you, O valiant <hi>Cavalier,</hi> you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
great contentment from it, for it <U+017F>peaks good unto you: In being called from
death to life, is to be under<U+017F>tood your coming out of <U+017F>ome eminent danger; Death
<U+017F>ignifies <U+017F>ome deep di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure out of which you are ere long to be relea<U+017F>ed by the

done you both, to the end your gratitude may oblige him to continue his goodne<U+017F>s
<U+017F>till unto you.</p>
                     <p>Thus <U+017F>pake the Prie<U+017F>t: And both the Nymph and the Cavalier upon their knees
<U+017F>eemed to be very devout towards heaven, by many actions of thanks: Afterwards
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53527:115"/>
retired to their Lodgings, with intention to go the next day unto the Temple of the
good Godde<U+017F>s; and afterwards in their return to <U+017F>ee the Shepherde<U+017F>s of <hi>Lignon,</hi>
with <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> though <hi>Damon</hi>'s intention was to make him<U+017F>elf as little
known unto them as he could, intending to <U+017F>tay among<U+017F>t them a few days, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
if he found no remedy again<U+017F>t his di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures, to go <U+017F>o far away, that he
<U+017F>hould not hear either <hi>Aquitain,</hi> or any he knew <U+017F>poken of. Being <U+017F>et down at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
therefore, with this re<U+017F>olution, and Dinner being almo<U+017F>t done, the Nymph <U+017F>aw
enter into the Room a Cavalier from <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who was in great favour and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with her. This Cavalier (after all due reverence) came unto her, and told her
in her ear, That he had great matters to impart unto her from <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> but the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
of it would be long, and fit to be kept in <U+017F>ecret, and therefore he would <U+017F>peak
no more of it, until <U+017F>he commanded him to wait upon her in private. The Nymph
hearing this, and <U+017F>eeing his face in a kind of confu<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>he began to think upon
what the Prie<U+017F>t told her concerning the defects in the Victims: And not being able
to think upon any greater misfortune then the lo<U+017F>s of her Mother, <U+017F>he asked him
aloud how <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> did? Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, thanks be to heaven <U+017F>he is in good
health, and does pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee you, thinking every hour an age you are
ab<U+017F>ent from her. We will wait upon her pre<U+017F>ently, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>ince <hi>Damon</hi> is
in a condition to ride; for it was not rea<U+017F>onable to leave him in a <U+017F>ick condition, <U+017F>ince
he received his wounds by defending us again<U+017F>t the injuries of <hi>Argenteus.</hi> Upon this
<U+017F>he retired pre<U+017F>ently into her chamber, and cau<U+017F>ed the Cavalier to be called. Has my
Mother (<U+017F>aid the Nymph unto him,) received any News from the Army of the
<hi>Francks?</hi> And does <U+017F>he hear how <hi>Clidemant</hi> does? Madam (an<U+017F>wered the Cavalier)
<U+017F>he did receive <U+017F>ome news this morning, which is not very good, but <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires to
communicate it her <U+017F>elf unto you, and would have you make all the ha<U+017F>te you can
unto her: She commanded me to let you under<U+017F>tand, that the <hi>Francks</hi> have been
in great Tumult upon King <hi>Childerick;</hi> who was forced to retire into <hi>Thurin;</hi> I am
afraid that this was not without great blood<U+017F>hed, and you know <hi>Clidemant, Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
and <hi>Gayamant</hi> were always with him, I be<U+017F>eech God no misfortune have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln
them. I can a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you of one thing, Madam, That <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> your Mother is
very <U+017F>ad, and much troubled, and extreamly de<U+017F>ires to <U+017F>peak with you. Friend, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Galathea,</hi> your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e does much amaze me, and I wi<U+017F>h either that I knew not <U+017F>o
much, or that I knew more: I mu<U+017F>t before I <U+017F>end you away, talk a little with the
<U+017F>age <hi>Cleontine,</hi> and with <hi>Damon,</hi> who is a per<U+017F>on which may be very <U+017F>erviceable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us in <U+017F>uch accidents as may happen; and cau<U+017F>ing them to be both called, <U+017F>he
acquainted them how <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> had <U+017F>ent for her: And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew not whether
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould return pre<U+017F>ently, or fir<U+017F>t go unto <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> to offer <U+017F>ome prayers there,
as the Oracle did wi<U+017F>h her, <U+017F>he asked the opinion of the old <hi>Cleontine;</hi> who an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her thus: I conceive Madam, that in all our affairs we <U+017F>hould have recour<U+017F>e unto
<hi>Tautates,</hi> and you e<U+017F>pecially, <U+017F>ince by the relation of the Prie<U+017F>t, you are menaced
with <U+017F>ome great misfortune; and to divert it, the be<U+017F>t remedy is to have recour<U+017F>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, from whom all proceeds, and to be<U+017F>eech him he would with hold his cha<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hand. And therefore my opinion is, your be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e is to go unto the good
Godde<U+017F>s, offer your <U+017F>acrifice unto her, and the <U+017F>ame day go into <hi>Marcelles. Damon</hi>
was of the <U+017F>ame opinion. You hear (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi> unto the Cavalier which <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is</hi>
<U+017F>ent) what the opinion of <hi>Cleontine</hi> and <hi>Damon</hi> is; A<U+017F><U+017F>ure <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> that to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
I will wait upon her, and in the mean time, will pray unto the great <hi>Tautates,</hi>
for a ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing upon us all.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Cavalier went away, leaving <hi>Galathea</hi> in <U+017F>uch a perplexity, as <U+017F>he had no
mind to <U+017F>ee the fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, or <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> but re<U+017F>olved to depart
the next morning betimes: which being come, <hi>Damon</hi> armed him<U+017F>elf according to
his cu<U+017F>tome; and having put <hi>Galathea</hi> and her Nymphs into their Coaches, he
mounted a Hor<U+017F>e which the Nymph gave unto him, and which was one of <hi>Clidemants</hi>
her Brothers. This Cavalier appeared <U+017F>o gallant in the eyes of <hi>Galathea,</hi> that he
put her in mind of the generous <hi>Lindamore;</hi> and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing from one thought unto
another, <U+017F>he imagined that the news perhaps that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> would tell her, was of that
Cavaliers death; and then <U+017F>he plotted how to get <hi>Polimas</hi> to go in his room, as well
to pack him further from her, and be rid of his importunity, as in hopes that <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>is</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:53527:116"/>
would ca<U+017F>t her eyes upon <hi>Damon,</hi> in ca<U+017F>e <hi>Lindamore</hi> was dead: and yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
his actions and glory he had gotten in this voyage, together with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he had born unto her, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but lament the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of him; and in
ca<U+017F>e he was not dead, and that <U+017F>he could be convinced of the impo<U+017F>ture of <hi>Cleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this,</hi>
then to have <U+017F>ome advantagious thoughts of him. The<U+017F>e thoughts entertained her
a great part of the way to <hi>Bonlieu:</hi> But pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing over the river of <hi>Lignon,</hi> <U+017F>he began to
think upon <hi>Daphnide, Alcidon,</hi> and all tho<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es whom <U+017F>he intended to
<U+017F>ee: but being unwilling that this <U+017F>tranger Lady <U+017F>hould go away, and <U+017F>hee not <U+017F>ee
her, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent unto the <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas,</hi> to de<U+017F>ire him he would come to her unto
<hi>Bonlieu,</hi> and in ca<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was gone before he came, to follow her unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>ellis,</hi>
and that he would infinitely oblige her, if he would bring <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi>
with him: Afterwards, <U+017F>he arrived at the Temple of the good Godde<U+017F>s, where the
venerable <hi>Chri<U+017F>ante</hi> received them with all honour and civility; and becau<U+017F>e the
Nymph acquainted her with her ha<U+017F>t unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles, Chri<U+017F>ante</hi> cau<U+017F>ed all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
ha<U+017F>t to be made with the <U+017F>acrifice, telling her that the Victimes which was offered
for the publique and the happy voyage of <hi>Clidamant,</hi> were found <U+017F>o defective, as
it was evident <U+017F>ome great di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter was towards.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who had obtained that permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion which he
de<U+017F>ired, he was <U+017F>o intent and bu<U+017F>ie in it, as he had forgotten to tell <hi>Madonthe</hi> and
<hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> that there was a Cavalier in que<U+017F>t of them, with many terrible mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and threats; and had he not accidentally met them one morning, as they were
walking to take the ayr, certainly it had been long before they had been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it; for he was <U+017F>o much taken up with his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as he had no room in his
<U+017F>oul for any other thought: But meeting them <U+017F>o opportunely, he acquainted them
with all that <hi>Paris</hi> told him, and the danger which they had incurred, if they had
met with that Barbarous Man, who <U+017F>ought for them with <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
<hi>Madonthe</hi> did thank him for the intelligence; and having long debated
among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, who it <U+017F>hould be, they could not imagine it could be <hi>Damon,</hi>
becau<U+017F>e he was dead in their belief: but rather that it was <U+017F>ome of <hi>Madonthis</hi> kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
who not being able to <U+017F>uffer her flight away with <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> did <U+017F>eek to he
revenged upon him. <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who alwayes carried much good will unto <hi>Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi>
both becau<U+017F>e of her re<U+017F>emblance unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was very vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and mode<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>hed abundance of tears, he had much compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of her,
and asked her the cau<U+017F>e of them. Oh Shepherd! <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, have I not great
rea<U+017F>on to lament my mi<U+017F>erable Fortune, which thus cruelly torments me? Was it not
enough, and too much, to per<U+017F>ecute me in my own Country, and among<U+017F>t my friends,
but I mu<U+017F>t be al<U+017F>o tormented here, where I hoped to find re<U+017F>t and tranquility. O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
O Gods! What crime have I committed lately, that after I had for<U+017F>aken my
Country, my e<U+017F>tate, and all my acquaintance, I <U+017F>hould be pur<U+017F>ued <U+017F>til, &amp; find no hopes
of any re<U+017F>t, but in my Grave. Upon the<U+017F>e words, her tears did flow in <U+017F>uch abundance,
as <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>trained unto <U+017F>ilence, and to have recour<U+017F>e unto her handkerchief.
<hi>Sylvander</hi> who was moved when <U+017F>he began her tears, was moved much more at
her continuance of them, and offered to guard and defend her from all injuries this
<U+017F>tranger could do her, by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of his friends, if <U+017F>he would <U+017F>tay in the
Country. As ill luck was, <hi>Laonice</hi> meeting them at the <U+017F>ame time, and being very
familiar with <hi>Madonthe,</hi> <U+017F>he advi<U+017F>ed her to retire into her own Country, where
<U+017F>he might live more quietly, and not to refu<U+017F>e the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <hi>Sylvander</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
her, at the lea<U+017F>t as far as Forre<U+017F>ts reached. <hi>Madonthe</hi> fearing to receive <U+017F>ome
burt for this <U+017F>tranger, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to be gone, and accept of <hi>Sylvanders</hi> offer, to
guard her with his friends: But <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> was much again<U+017F>t it, and di<U+017F><U+017F>waded her;
<U+017F>o as <U+017F>he thanked <hi>Sylvander</hi> for his good will, and would not permit him to go any
farther then the place where this <U+017F>tranger was <U+017F>een: Then pre<U+017F>ently at the <U+017F>ame hour,
after <U+017F>he had taken leave of <U+017F>ome Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, which <U+017F>he met with by chance, <U+017F>he

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53527:116"/>
in her own Town among<U+017F>t the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es and Shepherds, and was never out of
<hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> <U+017F>ight but when <U+017F>he was in bed; for all the day they talked together, and
were all the night in a chamber, where their beds were not far di<U+017F>tant: and the
impatient Love of <hi>Alexis</hi> not permitting her to <U+017F>leep; <U+017F>he aro<U+017F>e the <U+017F>econd mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to contemplate upon the beauty of her fair Shepherde<U+017F>s, before it was perfect
light, and put on <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> Gown in <U+017F>tead of her own; and <U+017F>he took <U+017F>uch extream
delight to be in that Gown, which covered the body of her deare<U+017F>t Saint, that <U+017F>he
took the re<U+017F>t of <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> Clothes, and trimmed her <U+017F>elf compleatly in the habit of a
Shepherde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o as any one would have taken her for one: and though <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi>
Gown was a little too <U+017F>trait for her, yet it was not <U+017F>o un<U+017F>it, but it might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the eye of any that was not too <U+017F>trict an ob<U+017F>erver: being thus decked, <U+017F>he
went unto the bed where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was a<U+017F>leep, and kneeling down, <U+017F>he began to adore,
and contemplate upon her beauty as <U+017F>he <U+017F>lept.</p>
                     <p>And though <hi>Alexis</hi> uttered many raptures in a loud voice, yet none of the three
awaked: <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>till looked upon <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and the more <U+017F>he looked, the more <U+017F>he
Loved: And being tran<U+017F>ported with her affection, <U+017F>he went neer her to <U+017F>teal an
amorous ki<U+017F><U+017F>e, but pre<U+017F>ently checked her <U+017F>elf, out of her re<U+017F>pect. But <U+017F>till having a
longing de<U+017F>ire unto it, <U+017F>he uttered <U+017F>ome ver<U+017F>es in a lone voice, upon this <U+017F>ubject;
That her Mi<U+017F>tris <U+017F>lept, and <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not ki<U+017F>s her; and perhaps <U+017F>he had grown a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more couragious, if <hi>Leonide</hi> by fortune had not waked, and perhaps again <hi>Alexis</hi>
was <U+017F>o loud in her expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as <U+017F>he was the cau<U+017F>e of it. As <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he opened her
eyes, <U+017F>he took her for <hi>Phillis,</hi> and bidding her good morrow, asked her, why <U+017F>he
was <U+017F>o early: <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>miled, and returning no an<U+017F>wer, covered her face with her
hand, purpo<U+017F>ely to keep her the longer in her mi<U+017F>take: <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> waking
at the <U+017F>ame time, they were both deceived as well as <hi>Leonide,</hi> both of them <U+017F>alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her, and asked the <U+017F>ame que<U+017F>tion which the Nimph did, <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>eeing all thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>taken,
<U+017F>he grew more confident then when they were a<U+017F>leep, and going unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi>
ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her cheek, &amp; bad her good morrow. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> hearing a voice unlike unto <hi>Phillis,</hi>
pulled back her cheek, and looking a little better upon her, <U+017F>he knew her. Am I
mi<U+017F>taken, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> or do I <U+017F>ee <hi>Alexis</hi> in the habit of a Shepherde<U+017F>s? Upon this,
<hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> looking al<U+017F>o better upon her, they knewher to be <hi>Alexis</hi> indeed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> then, rai<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf up a little in her bed, and taking <hi>Alexis</hi> in her arms,
ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her, with abundance of joy, to <U+017F>ee her in her clothes. Give me leave, new
Shepherde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> to ki<U+017F>s you; and give me leave al<U+017F>o to tell you mo<U+017F>t truly,
That <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi> never <U+017F>aw <U+017F>o Fair a Shepherde<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>Then all three looking upon her with admiration, they were all ravi<U+017F>hed to <U+017F>ee
her <U+017F>o Fair in that unaccu<U+017F>tomed habit: <hi>Alexis</hi> all this while, <U+017F>aid nothing; but at
la<U+017F>t, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw that <U+017F>he was known, Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto the Nymph, do you
not think, that the<U+017F>e clothes have not changed for the wor<U+017F>e? I do think (an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Nymph) that you are a Fairer Shepherde<U+017F>s then a <hi>Druide;</hi> and that if <hi>Hylas</hi>
<U+017F>aw you, he would pre<U+017F>ently lay by a new <U+017F>tock of Love, to <U+017F>pend in your <U+017F>ervice.
And I think, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that the<U+017F>e clothes, could they be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it, would be
infinitely happy, in being worn by the Faire<U+017F>t that ever lived. But (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> and
interrupted) it were pity to put this Fair <hi>Druide</hi> unto <U+017F>o much paines as to
undre<U+017F><U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf, and therefore it would be better, if <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> took tho<U+017F>e
of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and wear them all the day: I am confident it would be an excellent
mask unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> and he would certainly take the one for the other: Truly, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Leonide,</hi> I dare venture a wager, that mo<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ee them, mi<U+017F>take them;
e<U+017F>pecially if my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters clothes were as fit for <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> as <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> are for her. <hi>Alexis,</hi>
thinking it an happine<U+017F>s to be in tho<U+017F>e clothes, which u<U+017F>ed to cover the body of her
Faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris, had a great de<U+017F>ire to wear them all the day. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> who did pa<U+017F><U+017F>io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
Love this <hi>Druide,</hi> had al<U+017F>o a mo<U+017F>t extream de<U+017F>ire to wear the clothes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis;</hi>
and yet, neither of them, dur<U+017F>t publi<U+017F>h their de<U+017F>ires. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Diana</hi>
was very earne<U+017F>t with them to have it <U+017F>o. But <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi> unto <hi>Leonide,</hi> what
will my Father <U+017F>ay when he <U+017F>ees me in <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e? What will he <U+017F>ay? an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Leonide;</hi> he will laugh, and be very glad to <U+017F>ee you in <U+017F>uch a merry humour: he
knows that nothing is more prejudicial to your health then melancholy and <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e:
and thinks nothing more conducible to your health, then jollity, and mirth. Could

I believe, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> that I <U+017F>hould delude the eyes of tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee me
this day, as well as I was deluded in the choice of my clothes, I <U+017F>hould be glad:
For though there was much difference between our clothes, yet I took <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> for
my own, and yet I <U+017F>ee you mi<U+017F>took me: Believe it, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> one would believe,
you took much paines in dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing your <U+017F>elf, for it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould be better
dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed; and as for me, I will take <U+017F>ome other clothes, to make it the more belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that you are a new come Shepherde<U+017F>s, No, no, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) you mu<U+017F>t needs
take the <hi>Druides</hi> clothes: otherwi<U+017F>e, what will they think is become of her? We will
<U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide,</hi> that my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter is not well, upon condition <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
to take her clothes to morrow, that we may <U+017F>ee whether <U+017F>he will be as fine a
<hi>Druide,</hi> as my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter is a Shepherde<U+017F>s. I <U+017F>hall do as you de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> but
I believe her Gown will be too big for me. As much, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> as yours is too
little for me; but both may be ea<U+017F>ily helped. Since Madam it is your plea<U+017F>ure to have
it <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I <U+017F>hall be the <hi>Druide</hi> to morrow: but I am confident, that if
<hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>aw this new come Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e to day, he would burn all his Artieles of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with <hi>Stella,</hi> and add this Fair Stranger unto the great number of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es:
I am <U+017F>ure, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that neither he nor any el<U+017F>e can <U+017F>ee you, but
both he and all mu<U+017F>t needs Love you.</p>
                     <p>And becau<U+017F>e now it began to grow late, and full time for the<U+017F>e Fair Ones to
ri<U+017F>e; <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was con<U+017F>trained to ri<U+017F>e out of the bed in her <U+017F>mock, to fetch another
Gown, and other Linnen, which were in a Trunk at the other end of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and thinking none in the room but Women, <U+017F>he aro<U+017F>e very confidently, and
carele<U+017F>ly.</p>
                     <p>The fir<U+017F>t thing the di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide</hi> <U+017F>aw, was her bare Foot, and Leg; and half
her Thigh: The delicacy, and whitene<U+017F>s of her Feet, the hand<U+017F>ome proportion of
her Leg, the plumpne<U+017F>s of her Thygh, and the beauty of her Neck, could not be
equalled by any things, but them<U+017F>elves: And <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>tood in <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture of
amazement as <U+017F>he looked upon her, as invited <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> to take her in her arms and
ki<U+017F>s her: The embraces of <hi>Alexis</hi> might well have rai<U+017F>ed a <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, that they were
a little more affectionate and clo<U+017F>e, then <U+017F>uch as women u<U+017F>e: And <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was as
zealous in her imbraces, as <hi>Alexis</hi> was, and perhaps received them, not as the
ki<U+017F><U+017F>es of an <hi>Alexis,</hi> but as the living re<U+017F>emblance of <hi>Celadon. Leonide</hi> ob<U+017F>erving
the<U+017F>e amorous ki<U+017F><U+017F>es and care<U+017F><U+017F>es, and growing a little jealous, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto the
<hi>Druide:</hi> Take heed, new Shepherde<U+017F>s, le<U+017F>t holding <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>o long in your arms,

cau<U+017F>e of any inconveniency to you, but I hope my <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter <U+017F>peaks only out of envy:
then <hi>Alexis</hi> took <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> in her arms from off the ground, and carried her to the
Trunk, unto which <U+017F>he was going; and there <U+017F>etting her down, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing <U+017F>ometimes
her Eyes, <U+017F>ometimes her Mouth, and <U+017F>ometimes her Neck: And <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> thinking
her a Woman, did freely permit it; and was <U+017F>o extreamly contented to be thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F><U+017F>ed
by one <U+017F>o much re<U+017F>emblant unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> as <U+017F>he payed back her ki<U+017F><U+017F>es unto

<U+017F>he knew that all her happine<U+017F>s would be bla<U+017F>ted, if <U+017F>he were di<U+017F>covered;
and perhaps had di<U+017F>covered all, had not <hi>Phillis</hi> in the height of their carre<U+017F><U+017F>es knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the door: And therefore, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> fearing it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ome body el<U+017F>e, ran
pre<U+017F>ently to bed, and looked through the Curtaines who it was which entred. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis,</hi>
vexed at the heart to be thus interrupted, <U+017F>he went to the door, and asking
who was there, did open it unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t her mind, that <U+017F>he looked
not plea<U+017F>antly all the day. When <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>aw it was her Companion <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>he
bad her good morrow, and looked about for <hi>Alexis:</hi> and when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw that <U+017F>he
was not in the Chamber, <U+017F>he thought that <U+017F>he was gone to walk, as formerly <U+017F>he
had done; <hi>Phillis</hi> al<U+017F>o enquired for her, and they an<U+017F>wered that <U+017F>he was not very
well, and was gone into another Chamber, but would return pre<U+017F>ently. <hi>Phillis</hi> did
ea<U+017F>ily believe them, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>eeing her clothes upon the table. But when they
were all dre<U+017F>t, and ready to go out; I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> let us <U+017F>ee <hi>Alexis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

after our walk, and <U+017F>ee how <U+017F>he does: So taking <hi>Phillis</hi> by the hand, <U+017F>he carried
her out.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the new come Shepherde<U+017F>s being walked into the Hazle Grove,
where <U+017F>he thought to be mo<U+017F>t private, and might be<U+017F>t entertain her own thoughts,
in contemplation of tho<U+017F>e beauties which <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een, and of tho<U+017F>e favours which
<U+017F>he had received, or rather under a borrowed notion, had <U+017F>toln.</p>
                     <p>But the day being now well on, and mo<U+017F>t Shepherds retired with their Flocks
under the <U+017F>hade, <U+017F>he heard many <hi>Shepherds</hi> <U+017F>inging under <U+017F>hady trees, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the coming of their Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es: Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t <hi>Calidon,</hi> who was up

and to try his Fortune before he <U+017F>poke any farther unto <hi>Phocion;</hi> And he
meeting <hi>Hylas</hi> by the way, they came together unto this place, where both of

the<U+017F>e maximes were not, they would not delight <U+017F>o much in <U+017F>eeing their <U+017F>ervants to
langui<U+017F>h, but would add every day fre<U+017F>h favours, in hopes to keep us from chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.
Unto all this <hi>Calidon</hi> an<U+017F>wered thus; you are much mi<U+017F>taken <hi>Hylas,</hi> if you
think <hi>Sylvander</hi> to be the fir<U+017F>t Author of the<U+017F>e opinions: The Shepherds of this
Country have for many ages ob<U+017F>erved the <U+017F>ame Laws; and though cu<U+017F>tome did not
oblige us unto it, yet the beauty of our Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es would con<U+017F>traine us: For is
it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to Love them once, and not alwayes? I <U+017F>ee, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> that now
you do Love <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and therefore one mu<U+017F>t not argue the matter with you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rules of rea<U+017F>on: But I hope to <U+017F>ee you as far from this affection, as
you are from that of <hi>Celidea.</hi> Several rea<U+017F>ons, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Calidon,</hi> did divert me
from her you la<U+017F>t named, and many more do oblige me never to cea<U+017F>e loving the
other, unle<U+017F>s I cea<U+017F>e to live; for be<U+017F>ides the accident, which took away the beauty
of <hi>Celidea,</hi> and which was the fir<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of my affection, I was obliged to re<U+017F>tore
her unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> in point of honour; but <U+017F>etting this and all other con<U+017F>iderations
a<U+017F>ide, having <U+017F>ubmitted my <U+017F>elf by oath unto arbitration, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould have
drawn upon me, both the anger of Heaven, and hatred of men, if I had not been
obedient unto it. On the other <U+017F>ide, all things do induce, and invite me, never to
change my affection unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> for in the fir<U+017F>t place, her beauty is <U+017F>uch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be equalled. She is <U+017F>o much the prouder for that, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas:</hi> No matter,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Calidon,</hi> a little pride in a Woman makes her the more amiable. Yes,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>o <U+017F>he be proud unto others, and not unto us: but is not beauty very
<U+017F>ubject unto the injury and bla<U+017F>ts of time? Oh <hi>Hylas!</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Calidon,</hi> when age
has bla<U+017F>ted the beauty of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> the <U+017F>ame age will make <hi>Calidon</hi> not much care for
beauty: moreover, Parents who have the government of her, and tho<U+017F>e who have
the power over me, do allow of this affection. The contentment of Parents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Hylas,</hi> is often a cau<U+017F>e that Women will not Love tho<U+017F>e who otherwi<U+017F>e are
not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto them; as well becau<U+017F>e, they cannot abide Parents <U+017F>hould be
courted more then them<U+017F>elves, as becau<U+017F>e con<U+017F>traint is odious unto them: For Love
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53527:118"/>
never comes by con<U+017F>traint, nor the opinion of others; but only by the will of tho<U+017F>e
who love.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e (replied <hi>Calidon</hi>) that <U+017F>he will be conformable unto the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of her friends. May be not (replied <hi>Hylas</hi>) <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is able to build upon her
own re<U+017F>olution. I <U+017F>hould ea<U+017F>ily believe it (<U+017F>aid <hi>Calidon</hi>) did I not <U+017F>ee that <U+017F>he is di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged,
and free from loving any: and as yet I have not done her <U+017F>ervice <U+017F>ufficient
to engage her: <U+017F>o as <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he be ea<U+017F>ily won, <U+017F>he would not be <U+017F>o e<U+017F>timable. Oh
<hi>Calidon</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) Do you think long <U+017F>ervice will make her love? Alas, alas poor
Shepherd, I pity you, if you be of that opinion; you had need to make provi<U+017F>ion
of Spectacles to <U+017F>ee her Beauty withal at that time; for when it comes, I believe you
will not be able to <U+017F>ee without them. Did you never hear how <hi>Celadon</hi> loved her?
Yes (replied <hi>Calidon</hi>) but he being dead, that makes nothing again<U+017F>t me: Nothing
again<U+017F>t you! <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> Yes, yes perhaps more then you imagine: For why el<U+017F>e,
according to <hi>Sylvanders</hi> doctrine, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>erve the memory of him <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as <hi>Tyrcis</hi> does of his dead <hi>Cleon?</hi> But this is not that I would <U+017F>ay: Do you
know how long this <hi>Celadon</hi> Courted her? Some four or five years (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>)
Well friend, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> Do you not think a pair of Spectacles will do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well at five years end? I do not think (<U+017F>aid <hi>Calidon</hi>) that <U+017F>o long a time is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ite
to win her; but though it be, yet I <U+017F>hould not be reduc'd unto any <U+017F>uch nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as you <U+017F>peak of. Shepherd, <U+017F>hepherd, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> you may flatter your <U+017F>elf
as long as you plea<U+017F>e, but you may con<U+017F>ider, that nothing is more certain then expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and what you have formerly <U+017F>een come to pa<U+017F>s. Con<U+017F>ider if you be wi<U+017F>e,
that it may come to pa<U+017F>s again: You <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he is not engaged in her affection unto
any: Why, this is it Friend which makes me think wor<U+017F>e of your bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; for tho<U+017F>e
women which will love any, may be drawn and won to love us; but the<U+017F>e in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
Creatures are <U+017F>uch things as do not <U+017F>o much as know what and whom is to be
loved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Calidon</hi> began to boggle at the rea<U+017F>ons which <hi>Hylas</hi> urged, and thought them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<U+017F>trong. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you <hi>Hylas</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) I <U+017F>tand in need of all the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>olations
which you give me, I think my <U+017F>elf happy in meeting with you. If you would have
me flatter you (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) I could <U+017F>peak in another dialect, but if your judgement
be <U+017F>ound, you will <U+017F>ee I <U+017F>peak like a friend: If you de<U+017F>ire to find comfort in your
mi<U+017F>ery, you mu<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e the like remedies which I alwaies did in the like ca<U+017F>es; which if
you do, I will warrant you from taking any harm from <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e as this. But
let me tell you (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Calidon</hi>) that if you mean, quitting <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> or loving
any other, I had rather lo<U+017F>e my eyes then look upon any other Beauty then hers;
and lo<U+017F>e this heart which gives me life, then ever love any other Shepherde<U+017F>s then
<hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> Upon this, being a little angry with <hi>Hylas,</hi> he would have gone away
from him: But <hi>Hylas</hi> held him, and <U+017F>miling, <U+017F>aid unto him. Nay (<U+017F>aid he) if you
be upon that lock, and de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>o much to <U+017F>ee <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you may go into the Grove of
<hi>Hazles:</hi> For I <U+017F>aw her there alone, but would not tell you, becau<U+017F>e I feared you
would but lo<U+017F>e all your labour: For a woman is <U+017F>omtimes like unto death, which
comes upon us before we be aware, and lea<U+017F>t think upon it. <hi>Hylas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Calidon</hi>)
It was not friendly done, to keep me <U+017F>o long from my happine<U+017F>s in being with her.
Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> take heed you come not <U+017F>oon enough to receive a cour<U+017F>e en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.
<hi>Calidon</hi> having not <U+017F>o much patience as to <U+017F>tay <U+017F>o long to reply, he
went as fa<U+017F>t as he could to the place which <hi>Hylas</hi> named, thinking it the mo<U+017F>t happy
opportunity that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly could be, to find her in a place where none would interrupt
their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hylas</hi> thought he had told him right; for <U+017F>eeing <hi>Alexis</hi> only behind in the habit
of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> he was mi<U+017F>taken. In the mean time the <hi>Druide</hi> being de<U+017F>irous to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
her own <U+017F>weet Imaginations of that Vi<U+017F>ion which <U+017F>he had lately <U+017F>een. <U+017F>he went
a great pace unto the wood, where the <U+017F>olitude of the place, and the fre<U+017F>h memory
of tho<U+017F>e Favours <U+017F>he had received, did repre<U+017F>ent before the eyes of her fancy, the
Beauties and <U+017F>weet Ki<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> in <U+017F>uch lively apprehen<U+017F>ions, that folding her
Arms, and lifting her eyes up to heaven: Oh good Gods, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that <hi>Alexis</hi>
could be happy without <hi>Celadon;</hi> or that <hi>Celadon</hi> could be happy without <hi>Alexis:</hi>
Were I really <hi>Alexis,</hi> and not <hi>Celadon,</hi> how happy <U+017F>hould I be in <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> favours?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53527:118"/>
And oh how much more happy <U+017F>hould I be, if being <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>he did not do me
the<U+017F>e Favours as being <hi>Alexis!</hi> Was ever Lover <U+017F>o happy and unhappy both, as I
am? Happy in being care<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the Faire<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t Lovely Shepherde<U+017F>s in the
world; and unhappy, in that all the<U+017F>e favours would mo<U+017F>t certainly be turned into
Torments, were I not <U+017F>hrouded under the vail of <hi>Alexis.</hi> Here <U+017F>topping a little,
and afterwards beginning again; But <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) how long mu<U+017F>t this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e
la<U+017F>t? What end do<U+017F>t thou aim at in this thy de<U+017F>igne? Do<U+017F>t thou think thou can<U+017F>t
delude always? Why (fooli<U+017F>h Lover!) do<U+017F>t thou not declare thy <U+017F>elf? Does <U+017F>he
not as good as tell thee, that all her amity with <hi>Alexis</hi> proceeds only from her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emblance
unto <hi>Celadon?</hi> This manife<U+017F>ts that <U+017F>he does not hate this Shepherd, <U+017F>ince
thinking him dead, <U+017F>he does cheri<U+017F>h his memory: And do<U+017F>t thou think thy pre<U+017F>ence
would not be welcome to her, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>ees him<U+017F>elf upon his knees before her living,
and adoring her? Go, go and ca<U+017F>t thy <U+017F>elf at her feet; <U+017F>ay thus unto her, Here
Faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F>s, is <hi>Celadon</hi> mo<U+017F>t humbly before you; he died when you were
di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed, and now is revived again, <U+017F>ince you are plea<U+017F>ed with him in the face of
<hi>Alexis:</hi> If he hath <U+017F>inned in any thing again<U+017F>t you, he hath done penance for it:
but if you think his fault yet unexpiated, command him what torments you <U+017F>hall
plea<U+017F>e, and you <U+017F>hall find him more ready to obey, then you can be to command:
Upon this, <U+017F>tanding a while <U+017F>ilent, he con<U+017F>idered whether this re<U+017F>olution was good
or no; but afterwards beginning again, Peace, peace <hi>Celadon</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) content thy
<U+017F>elf with being dead, and envie not the happine<U+017F>s of <hi>Alexis;</hi> <U+017F>ince thou can<U+017F>t not
thy <U+017F>elf, let her enjoy it: for all the hopes thou ha<U+017F>t, is by the interce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of this
<hi>Druide,</hi> unto who<U+017F>e conduct thou ought wholly to <U+017F>ubmit thy <U+017F>elf: And do not
flatter thy <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much, as to think that <U+017F>he loves thy re<U+017F>emblance in her; Perhaps
indeed thy face may be like hers; but it is thy fault which invites her to hate thee:
If there be any thing in thee which can plea<U+017F>e her, it is that in thy <U+017F>oul thou did<U+017F>t ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
infringe the Laws of a perfect affection; and wilt thou <U+017F>tain the innocency of thy
Love by <U+017F>o great a di<U+017F>obedience as this? I do command you (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto thee) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to <U+017F>ee my face until I do allow it. Love her then, oh <hi>Celadon!</hi> Obey her, and
be <U+017F>ilent, if thou wilt live and love without reproach. Thus did this <hi>Druide</hi> think
her <U+017F>elf in a place where <U+017F>he might enjoy her own thoughts with delight; and Love,
who perhaps was jealous of the Favours which Fortune had done her, did venome
them with the<U+017F>e mortal imaginations; <U+017F>o as her eyes being over-flowed with Tears,
<U+017F>he was con<U+017F>trained to the u<U+017F>e of her Handkerchief: And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Calidon</hi> at the
<U+017F>ame time came into the Wood, <U+017F>he no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>pied him, but <U+017F>he <U+017F>tarted back, as if
<U+017F>he were ready to tread upon a Serpent; and went away (<U+017F>hunning him) into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Walk, which was in the high Wood, out of the Grove: But as Fortune was,
<hi>Hylas</hi> was walking there; and <U+017F>eeing her, did <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect the rea<U+017F>on of her coming into
that Wood; for he <U+017F>aw her run, and ob<U+017F>erved the place into which <U+017F>he entred; and
<U+017F>tayed a while to inform <hi>Calidon,</hi> whom he believed was not far off; and yet he was
deceived, for <hi>Calidon</hi> not thinking her to be gone out of the Wood, he <U+017F>ought her
in every place there, as if he had looked for a pin: But finding all his labour lo<U+017F>t, he
then believed that <U+017F>he had purpo<U+017F>ely hid her <U+017F>elf from him; and thinking this indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity
too great to be endured, he was <U+017F>o vexed to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf thus <U+017F>lighted, as fir<U+017F>t
in anger, and afterwards in de<U+017F>pair, he re<U+017F>olved an hundred times never to love
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> any longer: But then, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as he thought upon her Beauty and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he changed that thought, and was more entangled in this affection then ever.
In the mean time, <hi>Hylas,</hi> who <U+017F>tayed to <U+017F>hew him which way <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, began
to be weary of this <U+017F>tay, when he <U+017F>aw coming from towards the Hou<U+017F>e, <hi>Leonide,
Diana, Phillis,</hi> and among<U+017F>t them (as he thought) <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> At the fir<U+017F>t, he dur<U+017F>t
have <U+017F>worn the contrary; for he thought that he had <U+017F>een her on the other <U+017F>ide; but
going neerer, he could not give his eyes the lie, which a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was
in the company; when one came behind him, and laid their hands upon his eyes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to make him gue<U+017F>s who it was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till; feeling her hands, and finding them to be the hands of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
I know (<U+017F>aid he) who you are; but my wonder is, how you got behind me:
whil<U+017F>t he was talking thus, all the company came up, and could hear <hi>Hylas</hi> continue
his talk: I do know (<U+017F>aid he) that you are <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> Then letting him go, he <U+017F>aw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf

mi<U+017F>taken, and that it was <hi>Laonice.</hi> What <hi>Hylas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) do you know your
friends no better then <U+017F>o? No wonder Shepherde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid he, that I <U+017F>hould thus
mi<U+017F>take you for <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> for I <U+017F>aw her ju<U+017F>t now enter into that Wood; and as <U+017F>oon
as you laid your hands upon my eyes, I <U+017F>aw her ju<U+017F>t before me among<U+017F>t this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
What <U+017F>hould I think, when <U+017F>eeing her in <U+017F>everal places at once, but that <U+017F>he
can be every where? How <hi>Hylas!</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> Did you <U+017F>ee me enter into that
Wood? I did <U+017F>ee you, an<U+017F>wered he, and I am not alone that <U+017F>aw you; for <hi>Calidon</hi>
is <U+017F>till among<U+017F>t the <hi>Hazles</hi> looking for you. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the company
did know well enough his mi<U+017F>take; but <U+017F>eeing otherwi<U+017F>e, Certainly (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>)
your eyes are not very good this morning; for this Nymph and we all are able to
witne<U+017F>s that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> has been all this day with us. I <U+017F>ee <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is there (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>)
and I know that the <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> which I <U+017F>aw yonder, could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon with

to <U+017F>ee him in <U+017F>uch a maze: And becau<U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was very de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee this <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
which he <U+017F>pake of, <hi>Hylas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) we will think you out of your wits if you do not
<U+017F>hew us this other <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and therefore <U+017F>hew us which way <U+017F>he went. You may
think me as much out of my wits as you plea<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, I think
as much my <U+017F>elf; for I am the mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>taken man alive, if I did not <U+017F>ee one <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
there, and another yonder, and therefore I be<U+017F>eech you let us go and look for her.
Upon this he led the way into the high wood, and having looked long in vain, at la<U+017F>t
he thought that he <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>itting by an arm of the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> under a <U+017F>hady
Tree. <hi>Hylas</hi> went on as fa<U+017F>t as he could hye, and when he came <U+017F>o neer as to know
her, he beckned unto the re<U+017F>t of the company to come neerer; and taking <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
by one hand, and pointing at <hi>Alexis</hi> with the other: Look Shepherde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid he
unto her) Are not you <U+017F>itting under yonder Tree? Unto which <hi>Phillis</hi> an<U+017F>wered, I
believe late <U+017F>ervant (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that you are of the nature of Lions, who know their
Keepers better by their clothes then by their faces. Why do you <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Hylas?</hi> Becau<U+017F>e (replied <hi>Phillis</hi>) tho<U+017F>e clothes which you <U+017F>ee are like unto tho<U+017F>e
which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> wears, therefore you are per<U+017F>waded it is <U+017F>he. They talked <U+017F>o loud,
and <hi>Hylas</hi> made <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e, that <hi>Alexis</hi> turned about, and <U+017F>aw all the company
coming towards her: Therefore wiping her eyes, and <U+017F>etting as jolly a look upon it
as <U+017F>he could, <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e up and came to meet them; And becau<U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>
beckned unto her to <U+017F>eem as if <U+017F>he were a <U+017F>tranger, <U+017F>he demeaned her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o, that
both <hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Laonice</hi> did not know her: As for <hi>Phillis,</hi> they had acquainted her
already with the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. <hi>Hylas</hi> went to her, and <U+017F>aid, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, fair Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s,
you had almo<U+017F>t turned my mind when I <U+017F>aw you at a di<U+017F>tance; and now I <U+017F>ee
you neerer, I am afraid you will quite make me alter my affection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>eeming not to know him, or what he <U+017F>aid, I be<U+017F>eech you Shepherd, <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he, pardon me if I do not an<U+017F>wer, for I do not under<U+017F>tand what you <U+017F>ay. I mean,
replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> that taking you for <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> in one place, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Astrea</hi> pre<U+017F>ently
in another, I was almo<U+017F>t out of my wits; but now I do <U+017F>ee you perfectly, I fear you
will <U+017F>teal away my heart, which I gave unto another. You do very much oblige
me (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis</hi>) to take me for <U+017F>o fair a Shepherde<U+017F>s, whom I have <U+017F>o much
de<U+017F>ired the happine<U+017F>s of <U+017F>eeing and knowing; but then you do as much di<U+017F>-oblige
me, in <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting me for a Thief; for you mu<U+017F>t know, I never u<U+017F>e to take anything
but what is my own: But if you will repair the injury you have done me, <U+017F>hew me
which of all the<U+017F>e fair ones is <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and I will pardon the offence. I believe, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Hylas,</hi> that did you know me, you would not think, that in letting you take my
heart from another, I have committed any offence, for <hi>Hylas</hi> never gives it unto
any: yet <U+017F>ince it is an ea<U+017F>ie matter to repair the injury which you pretend I have
done you, I will not di<U+017F>pute it any further; upon condition, that when i have <U+017F>atisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your curio<U+017F>ity in <U+017F>hewing you <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you will not di<U+017F>dain to accept the gift of this

heart of <hi>Hylas,</hi> as it <U+017F>eems you call your <U+017F>elf. This is <U+017F>he (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas</hi>) and
<U+017F>hewed her <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh as well as all the company, to <U+017F>ee
<hi>Hylas</hi> <U+017F>o blind as not to know <hi>Alexis;</hi> who going unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>aluted her, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53527:119"/>
held <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of civility, purpo<U+017F>ely to deceive <hi>Hylas</hi> the more, who was <U+017F>o
much taken with the behaviour of this <U+017F>tranger, that he could not chu<U+017F>e but pre<U+017F>s
her to the reception of his heart: How now my late <U+017F>ervant? <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> what will
<hi>Stella</hi> <U+017F>ay when <U+017F>he hears you offer your <U+017F>elf unto this Fair <U+017F>tranger? What <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>he <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered he, but that I have ob<U+017F>erved our articles, by which it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me, to Love whom, when, and where I lifted, without any offence to her?
How Shepherd (<U+017F>aid the new Shepherde<U+017F>s) can you think I will allow of any <U+017F>harer
in Love? Why not? an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> as long as I love you as much as you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire?
But I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, would you in earne<U+017F>t Love me, and Love another
be<U+017F>ides? Yes <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas:</hi> and if after dinner there remain any meat, would you have
have me throw it to the dogs? And <U+017F>o after I have Loved you as much as you can
de<U+017F>ire, and have <U+017F>ome Love yet to <U+017F>pare, why <U+017F>hould I not imploy it in loving tho<U+017F>e
who <U+017F>tand in need of it? Oh Shepherd, <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>tranger, believe it, I will not allow
of any <U+017F>harers with me; he that Loves me, mu<U+017F>t Love only me, and therefore you
are not like to have me for your Mi<U+017F>tris: Nor you me (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas</hi>) for your
<U+017F>ervant; and <U+017F>ince you are of <U+017F>uch an humour, I advi<U+017F>e you to look out for one <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi>
who is <U+017F>uch a one as will fit your turn. Now <hi>Sylvander</hi> is mentioned, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Phillis,</hi> where is he? for I wonder we do not <U+017F>ee him this morning? It is well for
you <hi>Hylas</hi> that he is not here, for he would have checked you for thus talking of
Love unto this Paire <U+017F>tranger, at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight. <hi>Hylas</hi> would have an<U+017F>wered, but
<hi>Laonice</hi> interrupted him; Nay, nay, <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you may talk of Love, or
what you will to day, for I am <U+017F>ure you will not <U+017F>ee him; and though he were here,
I could not contradict you, for he is imployed in the like <U+017F>ervice, and offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
unto it. What <U+017F>ervice is that? (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> pre<U+017F>ently) You mu<U+017F>t know, an<U+017F>wered
the <U+017F>piteful <hi>Laonice,</hi> that <hi>Paris</hi> chanced to meet with a <U+017F>trange Cavalier, who thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out many menaces again<U+017F>t <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander;</hi> and <hi>Sylvander,</hi> undertaking to acquaint
<hi>Madonthe</hi> with it from him, he did this morning tell her of it; and <U+017F>he fearing le<U+017F>t
<hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> <U+017F>hould receive <U+017F>ome hurt by rea<U+017F>on of her, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to return pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
into <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and de<U+017F>ired me to make her excu<U+017F>es unto you all, giving a
thou<U+017F>and thanks for the favours <U+017F>he has received, and promi<U+017F>ing never to forget
them. But poor <hi>Sylvander,</hi> <U+017F>eeing her ready to depart, and not able any longer to
hide the <U+017F>ecret affection which he bare unto her, in the fir<U+017F>t place he u<U+017F>ed al the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could to divert her journey, and then <U+017F>eeing he could not
prevail, he offered him<U+017F>elf to wait upon her: but <U+017F>he, being unwilling to accept of
his offer, le<U+017F>t (as I believe) <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould make <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> jealous, <U+017F>he refu<U+017F>ed him
an hundred times: He <U+017F>eeing he could not obtain that favour from her, he fell
down upon his knees, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her feet, and conjured with the mo<U+017F>t earne<U+017F>t <U+017F>olicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that ever I heard, to give him leave; and <U+017F>he not knowing how in civility to put
him off after <U+017F>uch importunity, <U+017F>he permitted him to go with her a days journey or
two.</p>
                     <p>I believe (<U+017F>aid <hi>Astrea</hi>) that you are mi<U+017F>taken, if you think <hi>Sylvander</hi> in Love
with any: In Love with any, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> pray what do you think of his behaviour
towards <hi>Diana?</hi> Oh! an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that is only a Fiction. Yes <hi>Hylas,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Laonice,</hi> his behaviour towards that Shepherde<U+017F>s is but a fiction; he him<U+017F>elf
<U+017F>wore it this morning a hundred times, when <hi>Madonthe</hi> charged him with it. Well,
well <hi>Sylvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Madonthe</hi> to him, though my ab<U+017F>ence do a little trouble you,
yet the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Diana</hi> will comfort you. <hi>Diana,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he, does merit more
then my <U+017F>ervice, neither <U+017F>hould I ever have rendered her any, but in re<U+017F>pect of
my wager with <hi>Phillis;</hi> and I wi<U+017F>h <U+017F>he were here, that you might <U+017F>ee the truth of
my words. <hi>Phillis</hi> who knew that this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e would much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
did an<U+017F>wer thus; I cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly believe that <hi>Sylvander</hi> does Love <hi>Madonthe,</hi>
for he never made the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hew of it. I believe (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> and interrupted her)
that you are much mi<U+017F>taken; for I have <U+017F>een <U+017F>ufficient <U+017F>igns of it: and why <U+017F>hould
not a young Shepherd that has Wit and Spirit enough, Love a Woman that is <U+017F>o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
as <hi>Madonthe?</hi> E<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>peaks it knowingly, and <U+017F>aw him
obtain this permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to wait upon her with <U+017F>o much importunity? But good <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> is it certain that <hi>Sylvander</hi> has followed <hi>Madonthe?</hi> Do you think
(<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>ubtile Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e) that I would <U+017F>ay it unle<U+017F>s I <U+017F>aw them depart? Why
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53527:120"/>
<U+017F>hould I verifie a thing which if it were not true, would <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily be proved to be a
lye? Farewel <hi>Sylvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> and come back again even when you have a
mind. Upon this, <U+017F>eeming as if <U+017F>he were not troubled at it, <U+017F>he turned away, and
went from them; but <hi>Phillis</hi> followed her, and heard her upbraid <hi>Sylvander</hi> with
incon<U+017F>tancy: Ah Shepherd, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, are the<U+017F>e the effects of that Love which you
<U+017F>hewed unto me? Is this the eternity of thy affection? And did<U+017F>t thou trouble
both thy <U+017F>elf and me with thy di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, to quit me for <hi>Madonthe?</hi> Ha<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>o often
and <U+017F>o long blamed the Incon<U+017F>tancy of <hi>Hylas,</hi> to become as ill thy <U+017F>elf? Then <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
<U+017F>eeing <hi>Phillis</hi> follow her! Well Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what do you now think of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander?</hi>
I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that if <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>ay truly, I was
never in my life <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>taken as in this Shepherd; for I have <U+017F>een him make <U+017F>uch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trations
of a real pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as I thought it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be ever extingui<U+017F>hed.
But is there any credit to be given to <hi>Laonice?</hi> Yes doubtle<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
what <U+017F>he hath told us, I have alwaies ob<U+017F>erved a great affection in him towards
<hi>Madonthe;</hi> and when <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>ent him word of the menaces which were threatned
unto <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> how ready he was to be the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger? It mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that
<hi>Madonthe</hi> is very fair and di<U+017F>creet, yet truly in my eye <U+017F>he is not very amiable; and
were I a man, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>erve many others that are not <U+017F>o fair, rather then her: and
all this while <U+017F>he has been among<U+017F>t us, have we <U+017F>een any that loved her except <hi>Hylas</hi>
and <hi>Sylvander?</hi> For my part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I have the <U+017F>ame opinion of <hi>Madonthe</hi>
which you have, but I cannot believe that <hi>Sylvander</hi> loves her; and as for your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervations
of him, truly I think them only effects of his curte<U+017F>ie and civility towards
that <U+017F>tranger. But, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> what do you think of his <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>t <U+017F>olicitation
to wait upon her? Think, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> That it was <U+017F>till his curte<U+017F>ie. It had
been curte<U+017F>ie <U+017F>ufficient, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> to have undertaken the office of <hi>Laonice,</hi>
and brought us her excu<U+017F>es; but to fall upon his knees, to <U+017F>hed tears, and to go
with her almo<U+017F>t by force, and leave us without bidding one adieu, if this be curte<U+017F>ie,
and not Love, I know not what is Love. But its no matter, I am <U+017F>ure he has much
obliged me in this action; for I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, his continual court<U+017F>hip, and his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
behaviour had begun in me <U+017F>uch a good opinion of him, as I began to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineable
to wi<U+017F>h him very well, and indeed to love him. What a lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
had I been in, if he had <U+017F>tayed a little longer: And <U+017F>ince he is of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
I had rather both he and I were dead, then he <U+017F>hould have known my mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phillis</hi> perceiving that <hi>Diana</hi> did love this Shepherd, and fore<U+017F>eeing that <U+017F>he could
never decline it without mo<U+017F>t mortal di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure; Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) let us not
give <U+017F>uch ea<U+017F>ie credit unto <hi>Laonice;</hi> <U+017F>tay till <hi>Sylvander</hi> return; and condemn not a
man before you hear him an<U+017F>wer for him<U+017F>elf. Nay, nay Si<U+017F>ter, replied <hi>Diana</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently,
the <U+017F>tone is already thrown; let him <U+017F>ay and do what he will, I know what
to think. But <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> It is unju<U+017F>t to condemn before you hear. No, no
<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> all that hear him, will judge him in the wrong: and if you love me, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not to divert me from the mind I am in. But becau<U+017F>e I remember he has a
Bracelet of my hair, which once I made for you, I be<U+017F>eech you ask it of him from
me, the next time you <U+017F>ee him. I know that Shepherds of his humour u<U+017F>e to brag of
<U+017F>uch favours as they can get from unadvi<U+017F>ed Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es; and if I could, I would
not have him do <U+017F>o by me. <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Diana</hi> much vexed, and thinking it not a
time to contrary her, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ilent a while; and when they offered to continue
their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, they <U+017F>aw all the company coming towards them, but much encrea<U+017F>ed,
becau<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas, Daphnide, Alcidon, Paris, Hermantes, Stiliana,</hi> and <hi>Carlis</hi>
were there: Among<U+017F>t them al<U+017F>o was <hi>Lerindas,</hi> the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger from <hi>Galathea</hi> unto
the great <hi>Druide,</hi> who would not return before he had <U+017F>een <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> of
who<U+017F>e Beauty he thought he could not <U+017F>peak too high. But <hi>Adamas</hi> was much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
<U+017F>ince he under<U+017F>tood by <hi>Lerindas</hi> the mind of <hi>Galathea;</hi> for he was unwilling
to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e her, and he <U+017F>aw there was no going to her without <hi>Alexis,</hi> and he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <U+017F>he who had <U+017F>een <hi>Celadon</hi> in the habit of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> would find him under the
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e of <hi>Alexis.</hi> Therefore not knowing whom to advi<U+017F>e withal but <hi>Leonide</hi> and
this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide,</hi> he acquainted that Nymph with his perplexity. <hi>Leonide</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an excellent wit, pre<U+017F>ently returned this an<U+017F>wer. Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you mu<U+017F>t leave
<hi>Alexis</hi> and me here; for be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, if <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>ees her, <U+017F>he knows her; and if
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53527:120"/>
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould know her, it would be a great blemi<U+017F>h to your profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion: The Gods do
<U+017F>eem to direct you unto this cour<U+017F>e; for you <U+017F>ee <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed in the habit of a
Shepherde<U+017F>s, that <hi>Hylas</hi> does not know her; and which is of mo<U+017F>t concernment, I
am confident <hi>Lerindas</hi> will not; <U+017F>o as it is an ea<U+017F>ie matter to per<U+017F>wade all the <U+017F>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that <hi>Alexis</hi> is not well, and keeping her bed, you left me to keep her company,
for I have no mind to <U+017F>ee the Nymph as long as <U+017F>he continues in the humour wherein
I left her; But if you re<U+017F>olve upon this cour<U+017F>e, which as I conceive is the only way
to keep <hi>Alexis</hi> out of <U+017F>ight: Two things mu<U+017F>t be done, fir<U+017F>t, This new Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s
mu<U+017F>t hand<U+017F>omly <U+017F>teal out of the company, and get into her chamber, le<U+017F>t <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindas</hi>
or <hi>Alcidon,</hi> or any el<U+017F>e, <U+017F>hould come at la<U+017F>t to know her. The other is, That
I do u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome artifice or other to get tho<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es who know of her di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e
to entreat you, Father, that we may <U+017F>tay here a while under colour of <hi>Alexis</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
her complexion which <U+017F>he lo<U+017F>t in her <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s; for otherwi<U+017F>e they may <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect
<U+017F>omthing, and it is not yet time for our plot to be di<U+017F>covered. <hi>Adamas</hi> who had
not yet taken notice how <hi>Alexis</hi> was di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, did wonder he <U+017F>hould not know her,
and upon <U+017F>erious cogitation, did approve of <hi>Leonides</hi> opinion: But <hi>Alexis</hi> much
more when <U+017F>he knew it; as well becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought <hi>Galathea</hi> would know her, as
becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was afraid that then <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>weet contentments which <U+017F>he
enjoyed with her Shepherde<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e ki<U+017F><U+017F>es and care<U+017F><U+017F>es could not chu<U+017F>e but be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
unto her, though <U+017F>he received them only under the notion of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi>
only the Bearer of the name. All three therefore concurring in opinion, the
thing was pre<U+017F>ently re<U+017F>olved upon; and the new Shepherde<U+017F>s <U+017F>tole away from the
company, and looked her <U+017F>elf in her chamber; where undre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he went
to bed, after <U+017F>he had dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf as if <U+017F>he were <U+017F>ick, On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
having bid good morrow unto <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> I am very <U+017F>orry, <U+017F>aid he unto
them all, that I mu<U+017F>t leave you <U+017F>ooner then I re<U+017F>olved; for fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea</hi>
has <U+017F>ent for me, and I mu<U+017F>t go immediately unto her; <hi>Lerindas</hi> here <U+017F>wears
he will not leave me till I go. <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who was mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>orry for the news, Oh Sir,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, is there a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of your going <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon? Can you not prolong it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle?
<hi>Lerindas</hi> began then to <U+017F>peak; He cannot go <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon (<U+017F>aid he) nor be with the
Nymph <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires. It is not to you <hi>Lerindas,</hi> that I <U+017F>peak (<U+017F>aid
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> with an angry look) for I know me<U+017F><U+017F>engers are always in ha<U+017F>te. <hi>Adamas</hi>
knowing very well why <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o; Sweetheart, <U+017F>aid he, I cannot now <U+017F>tay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
the Nymph <U+017F>ends me word <U+017F>he has bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s with me, and <hi>Lerindas</hi> tells me
there is a <U+017F>tranger with her, of whom <U+017F>he makes great account: perhaps the bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
is of <U+017F>ome great concernment, and delay may do much hurt. The Shepherde<U+017F>s
<U+017F>hrugged her <U+017F>houlders, and with a <U+017F>ad look retired to <hi>Leonide,</hi> who beckned to her
with her <U+017F>inger. In the mean time <hi>Adamas</hi> de<U+017F>ired all the company to go home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and after Dinner, to go with him. Of all the company, none was <U+017F>o much
amazed as <hi>Hylas;</hi> for every man looking for one to wait upon particularly, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ires
were devoted unto the new Shepherde<U+017F>s; and after he had looked all over for
her, and all in vain; Fair Nymph <U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Leonide,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you tell me where
and what is become of that Shepherde<U+017F>s with whom <hi>Adamas</hi> and you were talking
but almo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t now? Unto whom (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide</hi>) did you commit the cu<U+017F>tody
of her? Unto my eyes, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas.</hi> Then, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you mu<U+017F>t ask your eyes; for
we who were otherwi<U+017F>e bu<U+017F>ie, did take no notice of her. Believe me, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi>
if <U+017F>he return not again, I laid by my <U+017F>tock of Love in vain, which I intended to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
in her <U+017F>ervice. Why, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> were you <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty in making your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ion?
I thought you would have taken more time before you re<U+017F>olved upon a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
of that importance. Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that would be enough for <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi>
who had need to a<U+017F><U+017F>emble all the Orders of <hi>Gaul,</hi> before he can re<U+017F>olve
whether he <U+017F>hould Love or no. For my part, I can re<U+017F>olve upon <U+017F>uch a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in
a day, as well as he can in an hundred years: For a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>ees a Fair one,
he con<U+017F>ults with him<U+017F>elf whether <U+017F>he has all the qualities that are fit for his Ta<U+017F>te:
Perhaps he will finde her too tall, or too low: too black, or too Brown: her eyes
may be too gray, her no<U+017F>e too long, or too little, her mouth too big, or too little,
perhaps her chin too <U+017F>harp, her cheeks too lean; and if <U+017F>he be defective in any of
the<U+017F>e, he has done: But a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as ever my eye meets with a Fair one, and <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53527:121"/>
fair unto them, I never <U+017F>tay to examine any particulars, but pre<U+017F>ently my will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ents
to Love her, and makes provi<U+017F>ion immediatly to be<U+017F>iege the Fort, or lay by
<U+017F>uch a <U+017F>um of love, as I think will buy it. Me thinks <hi>Hylas,</hi> replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> <U+017F>ince
you have taken <U+017F>o much paines about this <U+017F>tranger, you <U+017F>hould take a little more,
and go to <U+017F>eek her, whil<U+017F>t this Shepherde<U+017F>s and I, do talk about <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s,
which much concerns us.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, both of them turning another way, they <U+017F>eperated them<U+017F>elves from
the re<U+017F>t of the Company, to the end none might hear them: then <hi>Leonide</hi> <U+017F>poke
thus unto the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e: You heard, Sweetheart, how <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>aid he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained
to go away, and he was of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>o to do; for otherwi<U+017F>e the Nymph
would have occa<U+017F>ion to be angry with him. But let me tell you, that I was never
in my life in a place from whence I am <U+017F>o unwilling to depart as this: and not only
I, but <hi>Alexis</hi> al<U+017F>o, who I could never have believed would have liked it <U+017F>o well, if
I did not <U+017F>ee it; for having been brought up in great a<U+017F><U+017F>emblies, and continually
conver<U+017F>ant in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of the world, it is hardly imaginable, that a life <U+017F>o reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and <U+017F>olitary, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ure with her di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition: And yet I have ob<U+017F>erved, that
<U+017F>ince <U+017F>he came hither, her complexion is much bettered, which I believe proceeds
from the affectionate Love <U+017F>he has taken unto you, which is <U+017F>o great, that ye<U+017F>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<U+017F>he <U+017F>wore unto me, that a <U+017F>eparation from you would wound her very heart and
<U+017F>oul. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> It is an unexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible happine<U+017F>s unto me that our
kind of life, and our pa<U+017F>times, are plea<U+017F>ing unto you, and the Fair <hi>Alexis,</hi> for my
part, I am mo<U+017F>t entirely devoted unto both your <U+017F>ervices, and think your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
my greate<U+017F>t honour and happine<U+017F><U+017F>e: <U+017F>uch is my affection unto <hi>Alexis,</hi> as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t
Madam, that nothing upon earth can or <U+017F>hall <U+017F>eparate me from her, <U+017F>o <U+017F>he will
but be plea<U+017F>ed to accept of me: And therefore I do mo<U+017F>t humbly and heartily be<U+017F>eech
you, to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me with your favour in my addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto her and <hi>Adamas,</hi> for I am
fully re<U+017F>olved to follow her unto <hi>Dreux,</hi> and <hi>Carnutes,</hi> when <U+017F>he returns. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
difficulty concerning that, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> re<U+017F>ts not in them: for I could find a
way to procure both their con<U+017F>ents; but it re<U+017F>ts in your own Parents: Oh Madam!
<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> let that be the lea<U+017F>t of your care, for I know wel enough what to do in that,
you know it hath plea<U+017F>ed God to leave me without either Father, Mother, or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
As for <hi>Procion</hi> my Uncle, I ow him no <U+017F>uch obedience, but I may very well
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of my <U+017F>elf among<U+017F>t the <hi>Druides</hi> Daughters without any reproach: No, no,
Madam, there is nothing <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t as to devote our <U+017F>elves unto him who gives us all
we have. Were it a matter of marriage, or di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of my e<U+017F>tate, it were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ca<U+017F>e; but in re<U+017F>igning my <U+017F>elf up into the hands of the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> I cannot
be blamed: and therefore, Great Nymph, my only bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is, by your mediation
to procure me the approbation and con<U+017F>ent of <hi>Adamas</hi> and the Fair <hi>Alexis.</hi> I will
do you all the good offices I can, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide;</hi> and let me tell you, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas</hi>
does extreamly Love <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <U+017F>o, that there needs no more but to get
her favour and con<U+017F>ent: But why <U+017F>hould I <U+017F>ay, get her favour? Doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e you
have it already; you need no more but keep her company, and <U+017F>he will be the fir<U+017F>t
that will be again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>eparation. I believe her Love to you, <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>eth yours to
her; but my advice is to keep continually in her Company, and entreat <hi>Adamas</hi> to
let her and me <U+017F>tay here for a few days, which we may ea<U+017F>ily do under a pretence of
her being <U+017F>ick: And I, <U+017F>eeing what delight <U+017F>he took in this <U+017F>weet place, I did advi<U+017F>e
her to retire into her Chamber, and pretend <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e, purpo<U+017F>ely for an excu<U+017F>e of
<U+017F>taying here: And though <hi>Adamas</hi> knows that <U+017F>he is not <U+017F>ick, yet he is willing to
let it pa<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>o, becau<U+017F>e it will excu<U+017F>e his carrying her unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> who has long
de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee her, and keep her with her: But <hi>Adamas</hi> has no mind unto it, de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould continue her cour<U+017F>e of life which <U+017F>he has begun, <U+017F>ince <hi>Tautates</hi> <U+017F>eems
to approve of it, by all the <U+017F>acrifices which he has offered, for that purpo<U+017F>e. You
<U+017F>ee, Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, how freely I <U+017F>peak of things; and I do it, becau<U+017F>e I do much
e<U+017F>teem you, and would give you all the contentment that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could. It is a
thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to repeat the thanks which this Shepherde<U+017F>s rendred unto <hi>Leonide,</hi>
and as they were thus talking, they wandred a little out of the right way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
the Company had got a great way before them, they took into a path, which
might have brought them that were behind, to be before, had they not heard a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53527:121"/>
voice, which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> knew to be <hi>Calidons:</hi> and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he turned out of the way
to avoid hearing any more, thinking that to hearken to him were to offend again<U+017F>t
the memory of <hi>Celadon, Leonide</hi> ob<U+017F>erved her, and knowing him to be the <U+017F>ame
Shepherd that <hi>Phocion</hi> de<U+017F>ired to marry her unto; let us hearken a little, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he)
for I am confident he is <U+017F>inging <U+017F>omething that concerns you, and you may pa<U+017F><U+017F>e
away through the wood un<U+017F>een, when you plea<U+017F>e: Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you will
but <U+017F>pend the time in vain, for I am <U+017F>ure <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ubject is not worth it. <hi>Leonide</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
not, but began to hearken, as he began to <U+017F>ing out his re<U+017F>olution not to Love
her longer. I knew (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) that you would lo<U+017F>e your labour and time in
hearing him. Me thinks, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> that he is extreamly angry; may he be <U+017F>o
eternally, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> Upon this, both turning upon the left hand, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
on their way.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Paris,</hi> remembring the Coun<U+017F>el which <hi>Leonide</hi> gave him, to
ask <hi>Dianas</hi> leave, for asking her Parents con<U+017F>ent that he might marry her; and
knowing that <hi>Adamas</hi> was to go unto <hi>Galathea</hi> as <U+017F>oon as he had dined, he re<U+017F>olved
to lay hold upon the opportunity which pre<U+017F>ented it <U+017F>elf: For, as Fortune was, <hi>Diana</hi>
chanced to be all alone. And though <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>aw much <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s in her countenance,
yet after <U+017F>ome ejaculations unto <hi>Tautates</hi> to pro<U+017F>per his enterpri<U+017F>e, he acco<U+017F>ted her,
and taking her under the arm, he <U+017F>aid thus unto her: You <U+017F>ee, Faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
that my Father is to depart as <U+017F>oon as dinner is done, and that I am con<U+017F>trained to
go with him; <U+017F>ome comforts I be<U+017F>eech you give me, to pre<U+017F>erve the life of the mo<U+017F>t
faithful <U+017F>ervant that ever you had. <hi>Paris,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, in the quality you mention,
I cannot give you any, but in the quality of a per<U+017F>on whom I do much honour, I
will give you all I am able. In the quality you mention (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Paris</hi>) I <U+017F>hould
find nothing but death; and if you will not receive me as really I am, I be<U+017F>eech you
command me to dye: for I am not able to live and endure the torments which I do.
Now, <U+017F>ee how far <U+017F>pite and revenge may carry the heart of a woman, be <U+017F>he never

it. For if <hi>Sylvander</hi> did not Love her, <U+017F>he did not at all vex him by giving her <U+017F>elf
unto another: and if he did Love her, why <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he offer to give him any cau<U+017F>e
of vexation? For <U+017F>he did not give this permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion unto <hi>Paris,</hi> but only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
upon <hi>Sylvander;</hi> and would make her <U+017F>elf for ever mi<U+017F>erable, rather then
not prejudice him: and in this, <hi>Paris</hi> found that there is a critical hour in which
Women can deny nothing; and happy is he that can hit upon it, either by Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or by Fortune. The thanks he gave unto the Shepherde<U+017F>s, were very great,
but to no purpo<U+017F>e, for <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o much out of her <U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood not a

to her Cabin, where giving her eyes leave to weep, <U+017F>he cea<U+017F>ed not all the re<U+017F>t of

would accompany him, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> finding her in bed, they <U+017F>hut the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,

not to <U+017F>uffer her to walk in the heat of the Sun, which doubtle<U+017F>s would make her
wor<U+017F>e; <U+017F>he told him, that all the Town would be extreamly <U+017F>orry his daughter
<U+017F>hould go from among<U+017F>t them in <U+017F>uch a condition, and that every one would be as

could be; and therefore, as a witne<U+017F>s of all this, <U+017F>he be<U+017F>eeched him to let <hi>Leonide</hi>
keep her company: <hi>Phocion</hi> and all the re<U+017F>t joyned with her in this de<U+017F>ire, and u<U+017F>ed
<U+017F>o many Arguments, that <hi>Adamas</hi> was ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>waded to leave this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide</hi>
among<U+017F>t them, yet <U+017F>eemed very <U+017F>orry for her, and <U+017F>aid he was afraid <U+017F>he would be

among<U+017F>t them, commanding them both to come away as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Alexis</hi> was

told them in a low voice, that as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Galathea</hi> was pa<U+017F>t, he would either <U+017F>end

he left the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> where <U+017F>he was? Who an<U+017F>wered, that perhaps <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
at her hou<U+017F>e: Which <hi>Adamas</hi> and the <U+017F>trangers hearing, they de<U+017F>ired <hi>Phillis</hi> and
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> to pre<U+017F>ent their <U+017F>orrows unto her, that they had not taken their leaves of her,
and that if po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly they could, they would <U+017F>ee her again before they went out of the
Country.</p>
                     <p>All being thus parted, and tho<U+017F>e who accompanied <hi>Adamas</hi> returned, <hi>Paris</hi> would
no longer delay his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; but addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> he be<U+017F>eeched
him he would be plea<U+017F>ed to let him communicate a thing unto him by the way, which
concerned him<U+017F>elf and <hi>Diana. Adamas</hi> imagining his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, told him, with all
his heart: But <hi>Paris</hi> having obtained this leave, and not knowing how to begin, he
<U+017F>tood a long while, and <U+017F>pake not a word: yet <hi>Adamas</hi> knew well enough that love
was the cau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>ilence. Well <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>miled, Is this all you have to
<U+017F>ay? <hi>Paris</hi> opened his mouth two or three times, but blu<U+017F>hed and trembled <U+017F>o, as
he could not utter a word. Well well <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas</hi> unto him, I under<U+017F>tand you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, and to put you out of your pain. I know that you are in love with <hi>Diana;</hi>
but does <hi>Diana</hi> love <hi>Paris?</hi> Or rather, Does not <hi>Sylvander</hi> po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s that place which
<hi>Paris</hi> de<U+017F>ires to have? This infu<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o much confidence into <hi>Paris,</hi> that he an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Adamas,</hi> That he was afraid he had done ami<U+017F>s in <U+017F>uffering his affection unto that
Shepherde<U+017F>s to go too far, before he made him acquainted with it: That having
u<U+017F>ed the habit of a Shepherd, and <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o oft, his love was grown to that
height, as he was not able to live unle<U+017F>s he had <U+017F>uch contentment as tho<U+017F>e who real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love do de<U+017F>ire; and therefore con<U+017F>idering that tho<U+017F>e Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
were extracted out of as ancient and honourable Families as any was in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he thought it would be no di<U+017F>paragement unto his Hou<U+017F>e, if he married <hi>Diana;</hi>
and that Love did at la<U+017F>t force him to acquaint her with his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. And what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer
did you receive from her, <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas?</hi> That <hi>Belinde</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Paris</hi>) was
her mother, and had the <U+017F>ole di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of her. Then <U+017F>aid <hi>Adamas</hi> unto him, I
have long ob<U+017F>erved that you have loved that Shepherde<U+017F>s; and had I di<U+017F>liked that
alliance, I <U+017F>hould have forbidden the Banes before now: I do commend your choice,
for <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Astrea</hi> are extracted out of the be<U+017F>t Families not only of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
but all <hi>Gaul: Ama<U+017F>is</hi> her <U+017F>elf when <U+017F>he knows of it, will acknowledge as much:
Al<U+017F>o the Vertue and Mode<U+017F>ty of this Shepherde<U+017F>s is <U+017F>uch, as I <U+017F>hall think him very
happy that marries her: I mention not her Beauty, becau<U+017F>e that is one of the lea<U+017F>t
con<U+017F>iderable qualities in a Wife; though <U+017F>he may brag that <U+017F>he is one of the faire<U+017F>t
about all <hi>Lignon,</hi> and this <hi>Lignon</hi> includes all <hi>Europe.</hi> And therefore, I do not
only give you all the leave you can de<U+017F>ire, but do coun<U+017F>el and advi<U+017F>e you not to lo<U+017F>e
a minute of time: And becau<U+017F>e I am now going to <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> where <hi>Galathea</hi> may
perhaps <U+017F>tay me a day or two, I advi<U+017F>e you to go home, and make all ready for your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53527:122"/>
journey, and when you come to <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> I will have a letter ready for you to carry
unto <hi>Belinde,</hi> that <U+017F>he may know who you are, and treat you, according to your
own de<U+017F>ires. Upon this, <hi>Paris</hi> ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hand of <hi>Adamas,</hi> gave him a thou<U+017F>and
thanks for this favour, and taking leave of him, of <hi>Daphnide,</hi> of <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and of
all the re<U+017F>t of the Company, he took upon the left hand, and went unto the hou<U+017F>e of
<hi>Adamas,</hi> full of contentment, and joy.</p>
                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as dinner was done, the Nymph <hi>Galathea</hi> and <hi>Damon</hi> departed from
<hi>Bonlieu,</hi> to go unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who being very impatient, or rather troubled at the
news which <U+017F>he received, had <U+017F>ent another Cavalier to ha<U+017F>te them away. This was
a cau<U+017F>e why <hi>Adamas</hi> <U+017F>etting out later then the Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, he
did not find her at the Temple of the good Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e as <U+017F>he extreamly de<U+017F>ired; but
he, being very diligent to ob<U+017F>erve her as his Lady and Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and knowing <U+017F>he
was gone, he entreated <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> to continue on their journey, and
he would <U+017F>end <hi>Lerindas</hi> to acquaint the Nymph, who he was confident would <U+017F>tay
for them and take them in her Coach. The<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers were willing to <U+017F>atisfie his
de<U+017F>ire, and continued on the way, and <hi>Lerindas</hi> at the <hi>Druides</hi> command, ran
before.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the Nymph and <hi>Damon,</hi> went on their journey, and talked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<U+017F>everal things as well as the way would permit them: For <hi>Damon</hi> would not go
in the Coach, but armed, rid upon an excellent Hor<U+017F>e, which the Nymph <U+017F>ent him,
thinking him<U+017F>elf in a condition to defend Fair Ladies; and therefore that day, he
wore his Head-piece, and his Buckler, which at other times his <U+017F>ervant was wont to
carry. Riding on in this manner, when they were pa<U+017F>t the Bridge of <hi>Boutere<U+017F>s,</hi>
and entred into a wood, through which the high way pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, not far from the
hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas, Halladine</hi> who was behind <hi>Galatheas</hi> Coach, <U+017F>aw three Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
come ru<U+017F>hing out of the wood, betwixt him and <hi>Damon,</hi> and ran with their
Launces in their Re<U+017F>t as fa<U+017F>t as their Hor<U+017F>es could ride, again<U+017F>t his Ma<U+017F>ter: This
Faithful <U+017F>ervant, could adverti<U+017F>e his Ma<U+017F>ter no other way, then by crying out as loud
as he could; the Cavalier turning his head at his <U+017F>ervants cry, <U+017F>aw the three Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
<U+017F>o neer upon him, as all he could do was to draw his Sword, and <U+017F>heild him<U+017F>elf
with his Buckler. The<U+017F>e three were no <U+017F>ooner out of the wood, but <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>aw
other three, who galloped as fa<U+017F>t as they could up to <hi>Damon</hi> al<U+017F>o: who having not
<U+017F>een the fir<U+017F>t three, <U+017F>he and her Nymphes in the Coach cried out, which cau<U+017F>ed
<hi>Damon</hi> to turn about towards them, and mi<U+017F>s the <U+017F>hock of two Launces, which
otherwi<U+017F>e would certainly have thrown him to the ground: the third who came a
little after the other two, received the wages for all three; for <hi>Damon</hi> in a fury to
<U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf thus unworthily treated, did cut off mo<U+017F>t of his Arm, and he fell at his
Hor<U+017F>es feet. <hi>Damon</hi> <U+017F>till hearing the Nymphes to cry out louder and louder, he
turned towards them, and <U+017F>aw the other three Cavaliers; who more advi<U+017F>ed then
the fir<U+017F>t, ran all three with their Launces at his Hor<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o as he fell immediatly, and
gave his Rider no more time then to get his feet out of the <U+017F>tirrups. <hi>Damon</hi> then
leaping out of the Saddle, and <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>et on by no fewer then five at once he
thought his be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e was to keep neer his Hor<U+017F>e which lay dead; and tho<U+017F>e who
a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted him, <U+017F>eeing their hor<U+017F>es to boggle at the dead one, three of them alighted,
and two kept <U+017F>till on hor<U+017F>-back, and thus all five fell upon him at once mo<U+017F>t furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly.
<hi>Damon</hi> who had formerly been in the like condition, re<U+017F>olved to fell his
life as deerly as he could; and the fir<U+017F>t footman he met with, he gave him <U+017F>uch a
blow on his head, that the mans Arms being good, but he not able to bear the
weight of that blow, he fell down in a dead <U+017F>woon, and falling with his head again<U+017F>t
a <U+017F>tone, his head piece fell off: <U+017F>o as the fight being neer the Coach, <hi>Galathea</hi> and
all the Nymphs knew him to belong unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> <U+017F>o as all the Nymphs per<U+017F>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Galathea</hi> to <U+017F>tay no longer there for fear of <U+017F>ome Trea<U+017F>on again<U+017F>t her: In the
mean time the Souldiers were very bu<U+017F>y about <hi>Damon;</hi> but the Nymph an<U+017F>wered,
that it were a <U+017F>hame for her to leave <U+017F>o brave a Cavalier in the mid<U+017F>t of a danger,
whereof <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf was the cau<U+017F>e. Whil<U+017F>t the Nymphs were thus talking, <hi>Damon</hi>
had <U+017F>weathed his <U+017F>word up to the very hilts in the body of one of his enemies; but
another of them, <U+017F>pying his opportunity, did clo<U+017F>e with <hi>Damon,</hi> and threw him to
the ground, but yet <hi>Damon</hi> was fully revenged: for there being a defect in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53527:123"/>
Souldier's Armour, <hi>Damon</hi>'s <U+017F>word ran him into the belly, <U+017F>o as he fell dead <U+017F>ome
two or three paces off: Of <U+017F>ix, there remained now but three that were able to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him, and all on foot; and they fell upon him <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olutely, as doubtle<U+017F>s they
had di<U+017F>patched him, had not a Shepherd and a Shepherde<U+017F>s come luckily to the place:
For the Shepherd <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o many upon one, he went to <hi>Damon</hi>'s <U+017F>ervant, and asked
him why he did not defend his Ma<U+017F>ter? Alas friend (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>ervant) mo<U+017F>t willingly
I would if I might; but not being of the Order of Cavalry, my Ma<U+017F>ter has charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me not to pre<U+017F>ume unto <U+017F>o much honour as to u<U+017F>e a weapon. A mo<U+017F>t cur<U+017F>ed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ideration
it is (<U+017F>aid the Shepherd) that hinders thee from helping <U+017F>o brave a Ma<U+017F>ter
in his need: Upon this the Shepherd ran to one of the dead Cavaliers, took his
Sword and Buckler, and fell couragiou<U+017F>ly upon one of them that was upon <hi>Damon,</hi>
giving him <U+017F>uch a blow upon his <U+017F>houlder, that he made him turn towards him, and
upon his turning, the Shepherd ran his Sword through the Cavaliers body under his
right Arm, <U+017F>o as he fell down dead clo<U+017F>e by his companions: This did extreamly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze
tho<U+017F>e that were upon <hi>Damon;</hi> and one of them <U+017F>eeing the Shepherd di<U+017F>armed,
did bid his companion cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e him who had killed their fellow; which he did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
and fell upon him <U+017F>o furiou<U+017F>ly, that having the advantage of fighting with one
unarmed, he gave him two or three great wounds in his Body, although the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
defended him<U+017F>elf very bravely, and with much courage and dexterity; but alas,
all the blows he made were again<U+017F>t hard Armour, and all tho<U+017F>e he received, upon his
naked body. <hi>Damon</hi> in the mean time having now no more but one to deal with, yet
he received two or three wounds in his Thigh; but however, he clo<U+017F>ed with his
Antagoni<U+017F>t, and ran him into the Belly, <U+017F>o as he fell dead at his feet. Then running
to relieve the Shepherd who had relieved him, he fell upon the Souldier who had
newly <U+017F>o wounded the Shepherd, as he was <U+017F>taggering and ready to fall: <hi>Damon</hi>
pre<U+017F>ently with a dexterous blow divided his head and his <U+017F>houlders; and the poor
Shepherd having <U+017F>een his revenge, he fell to the ground almo<U+017F>t dead. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s
ran pre<U+017F>ently unto him, and <U+017F>itting down upon the ground, did lay the
Shepherds bleeding head in her lap, <U+017F>o full of <U+017F>orrow to <U+017F>ee him in that <U+017F>ad condition,
as <U+017F>he wi<U+017F>hed her <U+017F>elf in the <U+017F>ame. <hi>Damon</hi> was going to help her, when <hi>Galathea</hi>
cryed out, and bade him take heed; and doubtle<U+017F>s he had been in great danger, had
<U+017F>he not cryed out; for he thinking that all the <U+017F>ix Souldiers were dead, he never
imagined that he who lay in a <U+017F>woon <U+017F>hould ri<U+017F>e again, and come behind him; but
turning pre<U+017F>ently about upon her cry, he <U+017F>aw the man with his Arm up; who gave
<U+017F>uch a weighty blow upon his Buckler, as he clove it in two; had this blow been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
behind upon his head, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e it had cloven it al<U+017F>o in two, for he had put his
Helmet off. This fellow being both <U+017F>tout and de<U+017F>perate, and <hi>Damon</hi> being both
wounded and weary, the fight was very dangerous unto him, for he was not <U+017F>o nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and dexterous as u<U+017F>ual: yet at the la<U+017F>t, he ran his Sword into the very throat of
his enemy, who fell choaked in his own blood.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Adamas</hi> came to the place, and <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Hermantes</hi> <U+017F>eeing
all this, al<U+017F>o thinking that perhaps there would be no more work, they ran pre<U+017F>ently
to tho<U+017F>e that lay dead, and <U+017F>eized upon their <U+017F>words and bucklers; then they went
unto the Nymphs Coach to defend her, and pre<U+017F>ented them<U+017F>elves in <U+017F>uch a po<U+017F>ture,
as made it apparently appear, they could do <U+017F>omthing el<U+017F>e be<U+017F>ides keeping of Sheep,
although they were in that habit: As for <hi>Adamas,</hi> he went to the Shepherde<U+017F>s, and
finding him who<U+017F>e head lay in her lap to be very much wounded, he helped her to
binde up his wounds, which he had fini<U+017F>hed; when <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>eeing the Souldier di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched,
<U+017F>he went unto <hi>Damon,</hi> to know how he did. <hi>Damon</hi> who <U+017F>aw that the
man who had relieved him was in a bad condition, he ran pre<U+017F>ently to help him, but
he found that <hi>Adamas</hi> had already bound up his wounds, and the Shepherde<U+017F>s lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over him <U+017F>o <U+017F>welled with Tears, that <U+017F>he never looked up. The Shepherd find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his end was near, did offer twice or thrice to turn his head and look upon
her, but he could not, becau<U+017F>e he lay the contrary way; yet hearing what <U+017F>ad <U+017F>ighs
and tears <U+017F>he <U+017F>hed for him: Be of good comfort Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto her) and fear
not, but that he who is the ju<U+017F>t Judge of all, will <U+017F>end you <U+017F>ome in my room to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
you into your Country: the greate<U+017F>t grief that I <U+017F>hall carry to my grave, is, to
leave you in this Country, and <U+017F>ee none with you that will <U+017F>erve you as faithfully as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53527:123"/>
hitherto I have done: but I know that the great and good <hi>Tautates</hi> will hear my
prayers, and guide you out of the place <U+017F>o full of danger. He would have <U+017F>poken
more but his weakne<U+017F>s would not permit him. Then the Shepherde<U+017F>s began: Alas
(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) will you leave me in my greate<U+017F>t need? Have you not promi<U+017F>ed never to
for<U+017F>ake me, till we find the Cavalier whom we <U+017F>eek for? Madam an<U+017F>wered the
Shepherd, it is the fault of Fate, not mine: for I prote<U+017F>t, I would never leave you
untill I have put you into the hands of the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> as you de<U+017F>ire. Alas
Madam, you cannot ju<U+017F>tly accu<U+017F>e me of any thing, but undertaking more then I was
able to perform; In all this long voyage, I have rendered you all the honour, all
the re<U+017F>t, and all the <U+017F>ervices I was able, and the great <hi>Tautates</hi> be my witne<U+017F><U+017F>e, I
would have continued it <U+017F>till, if my life might continue: and could I but <U+017F>ee you in
any place of <U+017F>afety, death <U+017F>hould be mu<U+017F>t welcom unto me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Damon</hi> as I told you, ran to held the Shepherd; but as <U+017F>oon as ever he ca<U+017F>t his
eye upon him, and <U+017F>aw his face, he was amazed, and <U+017F>tood looking upon him as if
he were immovable: and doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e his admiration had been more, had not the
Shepherde<U+017F>s lifted up her drooping head, <U+017F>o as he thought that he <U+017F>hould know her
face, and the tone of her voice: but the habit of a Shepherde<U+017F>s and a Shepherd, and
the wan palene<U+017F>s of both their faces, made him <U+017F>tand in doubt, whether his eyes
and his eares did deceive him. In the mean time <hi>Halladine</hi> came unto him to bind
up his wounds; but he was <U+017F>o taken up with the <U+017F>ight of this Shepherde<U+017F>s and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
that without an<U+017F>wering <hi>Halladine,</hi> or <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>eeing him, he <U+017F>uffered him
to take away his Buckler, and began to di<U+017F>-arm him, where he <U+017F>aw the blood run,
when <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> came to him, and when the Shepherd, ca<U+017F>ting his eye
by chance upon the Buckler which <hi>Halladine</hi> laid upon the ground; Oh good God,
Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto her) what is this I <U+017F>ee? and with much a do, holding out his
arm, he <U+017F>hewed her the Buckler with a <hi>Tiger</hi> feeding upon a mans heart: <U+017F>o as
knowing it to belong unto that Cavalier whom they were in que<U+017F>t of; Oh happy
<hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> (cryed he out) now dye when thou wilt with full contentment, <U+017F>ince
Heaven has been <U+017F>o favourable unto thee as to <U+017F>ee <hi>Madonthe</hi> in the hands of her <U+017F>o
much de<U+017F>ired Protector. <hi>Damon</hi> hearing the name of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and afterwards
<hi>Madonthe;</hi> and both of them looking upon him, he had been blind if he had not
known them. Now did he plainly <U+017F>ee his long lookt for <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi>
al<U+017F>o, who<U+017F>e life he <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olved to take away. His love of <hi>Madonthe,</hi> his hatred of
<hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and his unexpected meeting with them, did make him tremble, as if he
had an extream fit of an ague upon him: He knew not what to do; whether he
<U+017F>hould go away, or whether he <U+017F>hould take revenge, and kill the ravi<U+017F>her of his
happine<U+017F>s before the face of her whom he thought had u<U+017F>ed him <U+017F>o ill: The injury
which he conceived he had received, did invite him to it; and his affection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect
<U+017F>tayed his trembling hand: But at la<U+017F>t, thinking upon the Oracle which he
had received at <hi>Mount Verdune,</hi> he quenched all de<U+017F>ires of revenge. But <U+017F>haking
from him all tho<U+017F>e that were <U+017F>o bu<U+017F>ie in di<U+017F>-arming him, who thought that his
trembling proceeded from his wounds, he ran pre<U+017F>ently to the Shepherde<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>Oh <hi>Madonthe, Madonthe!</hi> cryed he out, has Heaven been <U+017F>o favourable to me,
as to let me once more <U+017F>ee you before I dye? Upon this kneeling down upon the
ground before her, he offered to take her hand and ki<U+017F>s it; but <hi>Madonthe</hi> <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed
beyond imagination, fir<U+017F>t, to have met with the Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> whom <U+017F>he
<U+017F>ought for, and <U+017F>econdly, <U+017F>eeing him to be <hi>Damon</hi> whom <U+017F>he thought long <U+017F>ince
dead, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o ravi<U+017F>hed with wonder, that <U+017F>eeing him upon his knees before her,
when <U+017F>he lea<U+017F>t hoped for him, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but with open arms embrace
him: But this unexpected meeting, and <U+017F>udden joy, made her look as if death were
in her face. <hi>Damon,</hi> on his <U+017F>ide, looked as pale as <U+017F>he, <U+017F>o as if <hi>Halladine</hi> had not
run pre<U+017F>ently to hold them up, doubtle<U+017F>s they had both faln to the ground. <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ander</hi>
now knowing him al<U+017F>o to be <hi>Damon,</hi> and hearing him <U+017F>peak, he lifted up his
eyes to Heaven, having not <U+017F>o much <U+017F>trength as to <U+017F>tir his hands: Oh God! <U+017F>aid he,
How ju<U+017F>t, how good, and how omnipotent thou art? Ju<U+017F>t in rendring <hi>Damon</hi> unto
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> and <hi>Madonthe</hi> unto <hi>Damon;</hi> good in making three per<U+017F>ons happy at
once: The<U+017F>e two Lovers in meeting that happine<U+017F>s they de<U+017F>ired, and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> in
<U+017F>eeing <U+017F>o good a conclu<U+017F>ion of his <U+017F>ervices; and omnipotent in bringing all the<U+017F>e
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53527:124"/>
things to pa<U+017F>s when we lea<U+017F>t hoped for them: Oh <hi>Madonthe!</hi> Oh <hi>Damon!</hi> may
you enjoy all fulne<U+017F>s of contentment, and live happily together many, many years.
Upon this expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion he grew pale, and re<U+017F>igned his la<U+017F>t breath with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>miling
countenance, as plainly <U+017F>hewed he left this life with contentment. <hi>Galathea</hi> in the
mean time, and <hi>Adamas,</hi> who with all the re<U+017F>t of the Nymphs were come to this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,
they were all in extream amazement, to <U+017F>ee all the<U+017F>e three per<U+017F>ons look as if
they were all dead alike. But <hi>Halladine</hi> who loved his Ma<U+017F>ter extreamly, Madam
(<U+017F>aid he) if there be any <U+017F>parke of pity in you, I be<U+017F>eech you command <hi>Damon</hi> to
di<U+017F>-arm him<U+017F>elf, lea<U+017F>t his lo<U+017F>s of blood prove the lo<U+017F>s of his life. How friend, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Alcidon</hi> to <hi>Halladine,</hi> is this <hi>Damon</hi> the Valiant Cavalier of <hi>Aquitane?</hi> The very
<U+017F>ame Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Halladine,</hi> who has lo<U+017F>t more blood in eight dayes he has been here in
this Country; then he has of many years in all other places: Oh Father! (<U+017F>aid <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon</hi>
unto <hi>Adamas</hi>) I be<U+017F>eech you let us contribute all the help we can; for I can
a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, there is not a braver and more accompli<U+017F>hed Cavalier in all <hi>Aquitane</hi>
then this: Then kneeling down upon the ground, he began to di<U+017F>-arm him, <hi>Damon</hi>
not being <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of it. As for <hi>Madonthe</hi> after <U+017F>he had continued a while in a <U+017F>woon,
<U+017F>he came again to her <U+017F>elf; and <U+017F>eeing every one <U+017F>o bu<U+017F>ie about <hi>Damon,</hi> <U+017F>he thought
that he was dead of tho<U+017F>e wounds which he received in the combate. Oh my God!
cryed <U+017F>he out, and wrung her hands, mu<U+017F>t I lo<U+017F>e thee <hi>Damon</hi> as <U+017F>oon as ever I have

happine<U+017F>s only to be the more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of its lo<U+017F>s? Oh Heavens! Oh Fate! was ever
<U+017F>uch bitter torments re<U+017F>erved for any that lives? Life I defie thee; and torments do
your wor<U+017F>t till you have brought me to my grave: upon this, her <U+017F>ighs and her tears
did <U+017F>o <U+017F>top the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of her voice, that <U+017F>he was forced to be <U+017F>ilent; but her <U+017F>ilence
moved <U+017F>o much compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion in all the Nymphs, that whil<U+017F>t <hi>Alcidon, Daphnide, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes,
Adamas,</hi> and <hi>Galathea,</hi> were about <hi>Damon,</hi> they took the Shepherde<U+017F>s under
her arms, and removed her almo<U+017F>t by force from the place where <U+017F>he was, every one
giving her all the con<U+017F>olation they could.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Damon</hi> was di<U+017F>-armed, his wounds bound up as well as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency
of the place would permit; and a little after he began to open his eyes:
but being <U+017F>o weak as he was not able to ri<U+017F>e, he turned his head two or three times
about to look for <hi>Madonthe:</hi> and <hi>Halladine</hi> knowing very well what he looked for;
Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto him, do not trouble your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much, <hi>Madonthe</hi> is not far from

is it, which hinders me from a <U+017F>ight of that Fair Face? is <U+017F>he <U+017F>till with <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander?
Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Halladine,</hi> is dead, and dyed to <U+017F>ave your life, by which
you may <U+017F>ee the truth of the Oracle, and what great rea<U+017F>on you have to rejoyce,

took heart; and being extreamly joyed to <U+017F>ee him in a better condition then <U+017F>he
imagined, <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e up, and ran as fa<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he could unto him, and without any regard
unto tho<U+017F>e about him, <U+017F>he almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>mothered him with embraces; but being taken off
by <hi>Halladine,</hi> who feared that her exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive kindne<U+017F>s might make him wor<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he

Ah <hi>Damon!</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, is Heaven <U+017F>o good unto me, as to let me

                     <p>She would have replied, when <hi>Adamas</hi> mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ting the <U+017F>ecurity of that place, and
fearing le<U+017F>t the wounds of <hi>Damon</hi> <U+017F>hould grow wor<U+017F>e, he told <hi>Galathea,</hi> that he
thought it convenient to carry this Cavalier unto <U+017F>ome place where his wounds
might be better dre<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>ince he was very weak, he de<U+017F>ired he might re<U+017F>t him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
<U+017F>ome dayes in his hou<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e it was the neere<U+017F>t place of conveniency. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity
made the Nymph con<U+017F>ent unto this motion; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>ending unto <U+017F>ome of the
Neighboring Hamblets, they got <hi>Damon</hi> to be carried unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi>
and the corps of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> unto the Town of <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> to give it an honourable
Funeral. In the mean time <hi>Galathea</hi> adverti<U+017F>ed <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> by <hi>Lerindas,</hi> of all the<U+017F>e
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, be<U+017F>eeching her that <hi>Damon</hi> might be put into <U+017F>ome place of <U+017F>afety, which
when <U+017F>he had done, <U+017F>he would pre<U+017F>ently come and receive her commands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Madonthe</hi> could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly chu<U+017F>e but lament the lo<U+017F>s of poor <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and
certainly it had co<U+017F>t her many more tears had <U+017F>he not met with <hi>Damon:</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
his long fidelity, affection, and <U+017F>ervice, might well claim <U+017F>ome tears for his
di<U+017F>a<U+017F>terous Fate, and in reward of all his pains, which <U+017F>he did mo<U+017F>t zealou<U+017F>ly pay.
In the mean time, they began to carry away <hi>Damon,</hi> who turning his head every
way to <U+017F>ee what <hi>Madonthe</hi> did, and <U+017F>pying the body of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> he could not
chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>igh, not yet knowing whether he <U+017F>hould wi<U+017F>h him alive or no. Yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering
that he dyed to <U+017F>ave his life, his genero<U+017F>ity con<U+017F>trained him to <U+017F>ay, Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
Friend, re<U+017F>t contented, in that having <hi>Damon</hi> for thy enemy, thou ha<U+017F>t obliged
him to lament thy lo<U+017F>s, and to call thee his Friend. Upon this, he held out his hand
unto <hi>Madonthe,</hi> who came unto him, and never left him until he was in the hou<U+017F>e
of <hi>Adamas,</hi> although <hi>Galathea</hi> did mo<U+017F>t earne<U+017F>tly de<U+017F>ire her to come into the
Coach, chu<U+017F>ing rather to follow <hi>Damon</hi> on foot, then to be one minute ab<U+017F>ent from
him.</p>
                     <p>On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Adamas</hi> having pre<U+017F>ented <hi>Daphnide, Alcidon,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t
of their Company unto the Nymph, and <U+017F>he receiving them with all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of
civility, that the trouble wherein <U+017F>he was would permit; <U+017F>he took them into her
Coach: as for <hi>Adamas,</hi> he would needs follow <hi>Damon,</hi> whom they carried a <U+017F>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way then the Coach was able to go. In the mean time <hi>Lerindas,</hi> leaving tho<U+017F>e
that were to bring the corps of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> he ran as fa<U+017F>t as he could before, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verti<U+017F>e
<hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> according to the in<U+017F>tructions of <hi>Galathea;</hi> and though he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
per<U+017F>ons running up and down the fields on his left hand, and though he thought
them to belong unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> yet he went on, having a command to <U+017F>peak unto
none but <hi>Ama<U+017F>is:</hi> yet he whom <hi>Polemas</hi> had <U+017F>et as a <U+017F>py upon the way, to ob<U+017F>erve
who pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, ran pre<U+017F>ently unto him to acquaint him; and pre<U+017F>ently after, another
brought him word that they <U+017F>aw a Company coming, who carried <U+017F>omthing like a
corps. <hi>Polemas</hi> who <U+017F>tayed there only to know the <U+017F>ooner what was become of
<hi>Damon,</hi> did pre<U+017F>ently beleeve, that is was he whom they brought dead, or at lea<U+017F>t
wounded. And rejoycing much in him<U+017F>elf, though <U+017F>eeming to be much troubled, he
walked <U+017F>oftly to the way, <U+017F>eeming ignorant of <hi>Galatheas</hi> removing from <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> he
asked tho<U+017F>e who were with him, whom it might be whom they brought in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
None knew what to an<U+017F>wer, becau<U+017F>e he had not di<U+017F>covered his enterpri<U+017F>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any about him, being more politique then to divulge tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ign, which he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53527:125"/>
intended to execute: after he had walked a little farther, one of his men came and
told him, that it was one who was dead, whom <hi>Galathea</hi> had cau<U+017F>ed to be carried
unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and who was killed in her pre<U+017F>ence within the next wood. Now
did he begin to think that the Souldiers had executed what they had promi<U+017F>ed, and
began to gu<U+017F>t all the <U+017F>weets of revenge; but it la<U+017F>ted no longer then till he met this
corps: for ob<U+017F>erving it to be the corps of no Cavalier, and asking where they found
that corps, and whither they carried it? The men an<U+017F>wered, that <hi>Galathea</hi> had been
<U+017F>et upon by <U+017F>ix Cavaliers, that one <U+017F>ingle man had defeated them all: that this
Shepherd offering to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t was killed, but all the re<U+017F>t lay dead upon the ground, and
that they carried the corps of this Shepherd unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> by command of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi>
to be there honorably interred. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi> what is become of the
Cavalier that re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted all the re<U+017F>t? He is much wounded, an<U+017F>wered they, and is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
unto the hou<U+017F>e of the grand <hi>Druide. Polemas</hi> then <U+017F>eeming to know nothing
of the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: This it is (<U+017F>aid he as went away) to ca<U+017F>hier Souldiers without a
cau<U+017F>e; I do verily believe, the<U+017F>e are <U+017F>ome of them that were ca<U+017F>hiered, who being
angry again<U+017F>t <hi>Damon,</hi> did now <U+017F>eek to be revenged upon him in this wood; and
this he <U+017F>aid as a preparative to an excu<U+017F>e when <hi>Galathea</hi> <U+017F>hould complain again<U+017F>t him,
for he did imagine that the men would be all known. Then continuing <U+017F>till his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
to take away all thoughts that he had any hand in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; he pre<U+017F>ently
di<U+017F>patched one of his men to congratulate <hi>Galathea</hi> from him, for the good Fortune
which <hi>Damon</hi> had in this Country, and commanded the man to take e<U+017F>pecial notice
of all the words, and have an ob<U+017F>ervant eye over all the actions of the Nymph.
And at the <U+017F>ame time di<U+017F>patched another man to acquaint <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> with the accident,
be<U+017F>eeching her not to <U+017F>uffer <hi>Galathea</hi> to go abroad any more alone, and without
<U+017F>uch guards as are fitting for her Grandeur: he al<U+017F>o commanded this man to have
a <U+017F>pecial ob<U+017F>ervance of all that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>aid and did.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clidamant, Guyemant,</hi> and <hi>Lindamore,</hi> with mo<U+017F>t of the Cavalry in the
Country, being now in the Army of the <hi>Franks, Polemas</hi> <U+017F>tayed at home
as Lieutenant unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> in the room of <hi>Clidamant;</hi> And an ambitious de<U+017F>ign
<U+017F>welled him with hopes to make him<U+017F>elf Lord of this Province; and yet con<U+017F>idering
what abundance of difficulties he was to meet withall, in altering the Fundamental
Laws of a State, and in taking the whole frame from off its ba<U+017F>is, he thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
fir<U+017F>t, to try all wayes if he could marry <hi>Galathea,</hi> and left nothing invented
which might probably bring it to pa<U+017F>s: Now <U+017F>eeing but only two ways to compa<U+017F>s
his de<U+017F>ign, the one by <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s, the other by violence, he would fir<U+017F>t try if he
could win her good will; and if that failed, then to have recour<U+017F>e unto the fa<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                     <p>In order to his fir<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ign, he would imploy that pretended <hi>Druide,</hi> called <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthes,</hi>
who had formerly told <hi>Galathea</hi> her Fortune, having an opinion, that
the Nymph had a Genius, very apt and inclinable to hearken unto <U+017F>uch impo<U+017F>tures
and Novelties. He procured him therefore to <U+017F>et up his Cell again neer the Garden
of <hi>Mount Bri<U+017F>on</hi> where it was before; and <U+017F>etting all his things in better order as he
thought, then formerly; he <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elf two or three dayes, in hopes that <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
would come and vi<U+017F>it him as before <U+017F>he had done. And <hi>Polemas</hi> to make the
be<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e of the ab<U+017F>ence of <hi>Clidamant</hi> and <hi>Lindamore</hi> he could, he provided him<U+017F>elf of
many Souldiers in the Dominions of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots</hi> and <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who remained
quietly in the neighbouring Towns in expectation of his commands. He had already
courted him<U+017F>elf into the amity of the neighbour Princes, by corrupting their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Officers; and was <U+017F>o liberal in the <hi>Segu<U+017F>ian</hi> Country, <U+017F>o Courteous both to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Souldiers, and <U+017F>o re<U+017F>pective unto the <hi>Druides, Fubages, Sarronides, Vaces,</hi>
and other Sacrificers, as every one de<U+017F>ired nothing more then the marriage betwixt
<hi>Galathea</hi> and him, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome few, who being wi<U+017F>er then the re<U+017F>t, did plainly <U+017F>ee
that all this was not his nature, but only forced to compa<U+017F><U+017F>e his ends in obtaining
Soveraign Power, which once gotten, he would not keep by the <U+017F>ame means he
got it, but by more <U+017F>harp and Tyranique cour<U+017F>es. It was long before <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> could
<U+017F>ee the<U+017F>e things; becau<U+017F>e an hone<U+017F>t and good <U+017F>oul cannot imagine that a per<U+017F>on obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<U+017F>hould ever become ungrateful and traiterous. But at the la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he began to
perceive it by a letter which dropped from him, in which <U+017F>he found out what great
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53527:125"/>
intimacy there was betwixt <hi>Gond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>bant</hi> and him, and therefore a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <hi>Lerindas</hi>
told her of the accident which had hapned unto <hi>Damon,</hi> and that it was by the
Souldiers of <hi>Polemas,</hi> <U+017F>he believed him to be the <U+017F>etter on; yet knowing how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
it is to <U+017F>hew any mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t of a Prime Officer, before one be in a good capacity
to oppo<U+017F>e him: when the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger of <hi>Polemas</hi> came to deliver his me<U+017F><U+017F>age, <U+017F>he
<U+017F>eemed very thankful unto him for the care he had of <hi>Galathea,</hi> and <U+017F>ent him word
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ck, that his Coun<U+017F>el was <U+017F>o good, as <U+017F>he would follow it in this and all things el<U+017F>e;
And di<U+017F>patching away the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, <U+017F>he left <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> and went unto the hou<U+017F>e
of <hi>Adamas</hi> with a good guard of Cavaliers to wait upon her: For the news which
<U+017F>he had received from the Army of the <hi>Francks,</hi> did extreamly trouble her; and <U+017F>he
feared that <U+017F>ince it could not be long kept in <U+017F>ecret, <hi>Polemas</hi> would re<U+017F>olve upon
<U+017F>ome ill de<U+017F>ign, as of late <U+017F>he began to think he was apt to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galathea</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner come to the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas,</hi> but the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger from
<hi>Polemas</hi> came al<U+017F>o, and delivered the me<U+017F><U+017F>age of his Ma<U+017F>ter very bluntly unto her;
but <U+017F>he not being able to hide the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure which <U+017F>he had conceived again<U+017F>t him,
an<U+017F>wered him very <U+017F>harply: Go and tell your Ma<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that I am very much
di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed with tho<U+017F>e that belong unto him; and if he do not take <U+017F>ome better order,
I <U+017F>hall be very angry with him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Damon</hi> was got into bed, and when the Chyrurgions <U+017F>earched
his wounds, they found them to be more painful then dangerous; For though he
was run through the Thigh in two or three <U+017F>everal places, yet as happy luck was, no
Nerve nor Vein was hurt, which joyed <hi>Madonthe</hi> beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. The
Chyrurgions knowing that the contentment of the mind was highly conducible to the
cure of the body, they intreated <hi>Madonthe</hi> not to <U+017F>tir from him; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he
was de<U+017F>irous he <U+017F>hould know all her adventures <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he came out of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> <U+017F>he
did not only an<U+017F>wer unto all his que<U+017F>tions, but related all the plots and <U+017F>ubtilties of
<hi>Leriana,</hi> which <U+017F>he had contrived to the advantage of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander:</hi> But when <U+017F>he
came to rehear<U+017F>e the grief which <U+017F>he conceived at his death, when <hi>Halladine</hi> brought
the Handkerchief full of blood unto <hi>Leriana,</hi> and <hi>Ther<U+017F>anders</hi> Ring unto her, <U+017F>he
was not able to refrain from tears: then <U+017F>he related the horrours of that ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
death which <U+017F>he was to dye, and the unlookt for relief which <U+017F>he received from
the Knight of the <hi>Tiger:</hi> And his departing unknown, continued <U+017F>he, was the cau<U+017F>e
of my re<U+017F>olution to <U+017F>eek him out. But cruel <hi>Damon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, for I mu<U+017F>t give you
that Title, how could you find a heart to go away and never tell me who you were?
Why <U+017F>hould you after you had given life to my body, ravi<U+017F>h away the life of my
<U+017F>oul? Why would you not let me know you were alive? Oh <hi>Damon!</hi> how many
<U+017F>ad <U+017F>ighes, <U+017F>orrows and tears, had you <U+017F>pared me if you had? Afterward <U+017F>he related
unto him her re<U+017F>olution of <U+017F>eeking out this unknown Knight, whom <U+017F>he was in que<U+017F>t
of, though <U+017F>he knew no rea<U+017F>on, why <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>t after him: But the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
providence of Heaven would have it <U+017F>o, that I might find <hi>Damon</hi> under the
name of another: The truth is, continued <U+017F>he, I had a far fetched conceipt, that I
<U+017F>hould find him thus, or el<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould never find him; and you <U+017F>ee how happily God
brings all things about: <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of our <U+017F>eparation, and <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ander</hi>
is the la<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of our conjunction; how faithfully has he waited upon me,
and kept him<U+017F>elf within the limits of a re<U+017F>pectful di<U+017F>tance, maugre all the falacies and
fal<U+017F>e hopes that <hi>Leriana</hi> had in<U+017F>u<U+017F>ed into him; by which the be<U+017F>t advi<U+017F>ed man might
well have been deluded? Upon this <U+017F>he acquainted him how her Nur<U+017F>e dyed at
<hi>Mount Dor;</hi> how <U+017F>he met with <hi>Laonice, Hylas,</hi> and <hi>Tirsis;</hi> and how the <hi>Oracle</hi>
cau<U+017F>ed her to come into this Country, where <U+017F>he had <U+017F>pent her time in the Company
of <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana, Phillis,</hi> and other Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon,</hi> from whom <U+017F>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
that morning, with a de<U+017F>ign of returning into <hi>Aquitane,</hi> and there <U+017F>pend
the re<U+017F>t of her days among<U+017F>t the <hi>Ve<U+017F>tals</hi> and <hi>Druides</hi> Daughters. To be brief, <U+017F>he
omitted nothing, but made a mo<U+017F>t faithful relation of every pa<U+017F><U+017F>age unto <hi>Damon,</hi>
who hearkned unto it with <U+017F>o much joy and contentment, as he knew not which way
to be thankful enough unto his good Fortune, for this favour: and after a while of
ravi<U+017F>hment in this contemplation, he <U+017F>aid unto her, I <U+017F>hall Madam another time
give you an exact relation of my life <U+017F>ince I had the happine<U+017F>s of <U+017F>eeing you la<U+017F>t; but
at this time the Chyrurgions forbid me <U+017F>peaking, and therefore I will not u<U+017F>e any
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53527:126"/>
long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, only let me tell you, that I hope our future Fortunes will be better
then they have been: For the Oracle which I con<U+017F>ulted with at <hi>Mount Verdun,</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me that I <U+017F>hould be re<U+017F>tored from death to life by that man whom I mo<U+017F>t hated
and contemned: And <U+017F>ee how this poor Cavalier brought you hither, where I find
you: For the Truth is, I might mo<U+017F>t rightly be <U+017F>aid to be dead when I was deprived
of you; and alive again in the happine<U+017F>s of being with you; when I do con<U+017F>ider the
pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, I cannot chu<U+017F>e but admire at the wi<U+017F>e providence of the Great Gods, who
has ordered <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> to give me a double life, the life of my body, by that relief
which he brought me, and the life of my <U+017F>oul, in conducting you Madam unto the
place where I was: There is only one doubt in the Oracle, which I do <U+017F>cruple at:</p>
                     <lg type="poem">
                        <head>The Oracle.</head>
                        <l>AND thou, O perfect Lover, when</l>
                        <l>Thou hear'<U+017F>t a Diamond <U+017F>peak: Oh! then</l>
                        <l>From Death to Life thou <U+017F>halt return,</l>
                        <l>By help of him whom thou did<U+017F>t <U+017F>corn.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>I <U+017F>ee, (<U+017F>aid he) that all is mo<U+017F>t perfectly accompli<U+017F>hed, except this hearing a
Diamond <U+017F>peak, unle<U+017F>s the Oracle will have me to take you Madam, for a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
in con<U+017F>tancy and excellency of amity. <hi>Adamas</hi> hearkned unto this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
very attentively; Sir, <U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>miled, if I had been known unto you, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>curity
of this Oracle would vani<U+017F>h: for my name is <hi>Adamas,</hi> which <U+017F>ingifies in the
Roman Language a Diamond; <U+017F>o as this Oracle let you know, that as <U+017F>oon as you
hear me, this accident <U+017F>hall befall you; and <U+017F>o indeed it did: For at the very <U+017F>ame
time that <hi>Alcidon, Daphnide,</hi> and I, came unto the place where you were, you met
with <hi>Madonthe.</hi> I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Damon</hi>) the Oracle is fully cleered, and I am
mo<U+017F>t humbly thankful unto that Deity which ordained me this happine<U+017F>s when I lea<U+017F>t
expected it: But Reverend Father, continued he, and looked about the Chamber,
I heard you name two per<U+017F>ons, whom I infinitely e<U+017F>teem, and <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf
very happy to <U+017F>ee in this place. Then <hi>Alcidon</hi> <U+017F>tepped to him, and imbracing him,
<U+017F>aid, yes <hi>Damon, Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> are here, and are conducted unto this
Country of wonders, by the <U+017F>ame Love which brought you into it: At the <U+017F>ame
time <hi>Daphnide</hi> came unto him, and <U+017F>aluting him, <U+017F>aid, yes, yes <hi>Damon, Madonthe</hi>
can tell you, that <hi>Daphnide</hi> is al<U+017F>o here, and pre<U+017F>ents her <U+017F>elf unto you under the
notion of one of your be<U+017F>t Friends. <hi>Damon</hi> being <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee this Cavalier, and
this Lady, thus clad in the habit of Shepherds, he knew not at fir<U+017F>t whether he was
a<U+017F>leep or awake; but afterwards touching them, and hearing them <U+017F>peak, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
them, and cryed out; O <hi>Alcidon!</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s with you, that this
Country is a Country of Wonders, but they are wonders full of joy and happine<U+017F>s,
greater then ever I could hope to <U+017F>ee. Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> were <U+017F>aluting,
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> and they were all rejoycing together at their happy meeting, news was
brought unto <hi>Adamas</hi> that the Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> was entred into the Court; and he
was no <U+017F>ooner out of the Chamber to meet her, but he found her at the door,
where after <U+017F>he had <U+017F>tayed a little, <U+017F>he entred into the room where <hi>Damon</hi> was: I
think, valiant Cavalier, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, that I <U+017F>hall never come to <U+017F>ee you, but
<U+017F>hall find you thus unfortunately wounded. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Damon,</hi> I <U+017F>hall never
complain again<U+017F>t any of the<U+017F>e wounds which I have received: For the fir<U+017F>t, gave me
the honour of <U+017F>eeing the Nymph <hi>Galathea,</hi> and then you Madam; and the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t
have made me meet with her, who only in all the World can make me happy: <U+017F>o
as in lieu of complaining again<U+017F>t this Country, I have cau<U+017F>e to Love it, e<U+017F>teem it, and
<U+017F>peak well of it. Upon this <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> being informed of the quality of <hi>Madonthe,</hi> <U+017F>he
went to embrace her, and care<U+017F>s her according to her merits; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he
took no notice of <hi>Daphnide</hi> and <hi>Alcidon;</hi> I perceive <hi>Madam,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Damon</hi> unto her)
that tho<U+017F>e two per<U+017F>ons are unknown unto you, but be plea<U+017F>ed to know, that they
are worth your acquaintance; for though you <U+017F>ee them thus di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, yet Madam
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53527:126"/>
the one is <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and the other is <hi>Alcidon;</hi> the very <U+017F>ame <hi>Daphnide</hi> who<U+017F>e me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<U+017F>o much commanded the affection of the Great <hi>Eurick:</hi> And the very <U+017F>ame <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon,</hi>
<U+017F>o Feared and Loved for his valour by <hi>Thori<U+017F>mond</hi> King of the <hi>Vi<U+017F>igots,</hi> and
all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ucceeded him. <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> upon this, gave him thanks for his advice,
and went to embrace them: It had been enough (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) if you had only told me
their right names; for as <U+017F>oon as I had heard them, I <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ently have known
the<U+017F>e two to be the Great Favorites of King <hi>Eurick:</hi> But I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, that
<U+017F>eeing them thus habited, I <U+017F>hould not have known them for what they are, and
therefore I am obliged unto you for telling me. The obligation Madam, replied
<hi>Daphnide,</hi> is on our <U+017F>ides, <U+017F>ince he has made us known unto the greate<U+017F>t, mo<U+017F>t
e<U+017F>teemed, and honoured Nymph among<U+017F>t all the <hi>Gaules.</hi> But Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>
unto <hi>Alcidon,</hi> how came you to be thus di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed? And where met you with this
Shepherds habit? The Story of it Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alcidon,</hi> would be too long;
but I be<U+017F>eech you, who can be in Forre<U+017F>ts and not become a Shepherd? The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is <U+017F>o full of accompli<U+017F>hed Shepherds, and Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, as I rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that you Madam, and all your Nymphs, are not in the Habits of Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>
                     <p>I am very glad (an<U+017F>wered the Nymph) that you have found any thing in this
Country which plea<U+017F>eth you; but when we have the happine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ee you in <hi>Mar<U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
perhaps you will not think my Nymphs le<U+017F>s lovely then the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, nor
find them in any humour of changing habits with them. Madam, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>)
I do not doubt of any thing you <U+017F>ay; but I be<U+017F>eech you give me leave to be <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and to <U+017F>ay nothing unto what I do not yet know.</p>
                     <p>The Nymph had continued the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e longer, if <U+017F>he had not been very de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to have <U+017F>ome talk with the <U+017F>age <hi>Adamas:</hi> and having held a long di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with
<hi>Galathea</hi> and him, upon the news which <U+017F>he had received, <U+017F>he went at la<U+017F>t unto
<hi>Damon,</hi> and asked him how he did after his wounds were dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed? And under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he found him<U+017F>elf much better, <U+017F>he left him with <hi>Madonthe,</hi> <U+017F>aying <U+017F>he
would not hinder them of their contentments in talking privately together: Then
<U+017F>he commanded <hi>Silvia,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the Nymphs, to entertain <hi>Daphnide</hi> and her
Company, and to <U+017F>hew <hi>Alcidon</hi> that the Nymphs of <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles</hi> do not yeild unto
the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon.</hi> Upon this taking <hi>Adamas</hi> by one hand, and <hi>Galathea</hi>
by another, <U+017F>he went into the Gallery, where the doors being all <U+017F>hut, <U+017F>he took
a whole turn before <U+017F>he began to <U+017F>peak: afterwards a<U+017F><U+017F>uming another look more
<U+017F>erious then before, and <U+017F>eeming to be much troubled, <U+017F>he turned her <U+017F>elf toward
<hi>Adamas</hi> and <U+017F>poke thus.</p>
                     <p>Father (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I have things of great importance to impart unto you; and you
mu<U+017F>t give me that Faithful and Prudent Coun<U+017F>el, which you were always wont:
and becau<U+017F>e I may perhaps forget <U+017F>ome material pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, I de<U+017F>ire that he who
brought me the news, may make the relation of it unto you, if we have but as much
time afterwards as to return unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles:</hi> Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas,</hi> I pray
Heaven you be not mi<U+017F>taken in my Prudence, and I dare an<U+017F>wer for my fidelity;
and as for your return unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> I <U+017F>hall hope that unle<U+017F>s your ha<U+017F>te be very
great, you will honour me and my hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>o much as to <U+017F>tay this night in it: Father,
(an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>) if the urgency of my affairs would permit it, I <U+017F>hould be very
willing; but when you <U+017F>hall hear what the Cavalier will <U+017F>ay whom <hi>Lindamore</hi> <U+017F>ent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, you will not judg it convenient: Then cau<U+017F>ing <hi>Galathea</hi> to call in the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
whom <hi>Lindamore</hi> <U+017F>ent, and the doors being <U+017F>hut, pray Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto the
Cavalier, make us a relation of all the me<U+017F><U+017F>age which <hi>Lindamore</hi> has <U+017F>ent unto me,
and omit not any particular either concerning our affairs, or the affairs of <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
and <hi>Guyemant,</hi> <U+017F>ince they are <U+017F>o linked together, that they can hardly be <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
Upon this, placing the Cavalier between her <U+017F>elf and <hi>Adamas,</hi> and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Galathea</hi> in her other hand, they all walked together; and the Cavalier in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to her commands, with a deep <U+017F>igh, began thus.</p>

                     <p>The Reputation of the Father, and the Love which he had got among<U+017F>t the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
moved all the <hi>Franks</hi> with a common con<U+017F>ent to make choi<U+017F>e of <hi>Childerick</hi> the

and the other to <U+017F>peak the conque<U+017F>ts of his Father, they carried him upon

<hi>Franks:</hi> before him went the Heralds of Arms, carrying in their hands En<U+017F>ignes
won by <hi>Merovius</hi> from the <hi>Huns, Gepides, Alaines, Burgundians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> all
which they trailed upon the ground: after followed the En<U+017F>ignes of the <hi>Franks,</hi>
which were <U+017F>emi-Flower de Luces in an Azure Field: and la<U+017F>t of all followed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ignes
of <hi>Merovius</hi> his Father; The fir<U+017F>t was a <hi>Lion</hi> endeavouring to mount a <U+017F>teep

Buckler <U+017F>ecures a Crown.</hi> Thus going Triumphantly through all the <U+017F>treets, the
Air did Eccho with the loud acclamations of the People and Souldiers: Bonfires
blazed befory every door, and when they were extingui<U+017F>hed, great Wax Tapers
burned all the night before every mans hou<U+017F>e, and nothing but dancing and joy
could be <U+017F>een in the <U+017F>treets; Tables <U+017F>umptuou<U+017F>ly furni<U+017F>hed were <U+017F>et out for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers:
And it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me Madam, to expre<U+017F>s the great hopes that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

was yet <U+017F>o fre<U+017F>h, that all his great victories <U+017F>eemed to be before their eyes, and
the generous actions of the Father made them hope for the <U+017F>ame from the Son, both
in matter of Arms, and management of publique affairs. But he quickly <U+017F>hewed
them that Dominion is a place <U+017F>o <U+017F>lippery, that few per<U+017F>ons can attain to it, and
fewer can find firm footing without a fall: For in a <U+017F>hort time after he was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he began to lay Arms a<U+017F>ide, and addict him<U+017F>elf unto all manner of plea<U+017F>ures; not
remembring that it was the magnanimity, and martial exploits of his predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors,
which had promoted them unto that Dominion: <U+017F>o as now the Court was quite
changed and <U+017F>warmed with e<U+017F><U+017F>eminate Sycophants, whil<U+017F>t valiant and brave minds
had nothing to do, but <U+017F>tand with their hands in their pockets; young Gallants
who under <hi>Merovius</hi> began to bud in valour, are now after the example of <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
turned women, and look not like the <U+017F>ame men they promi<U+017F>ed to be. So as all
the hopes of conque<U+017F>t were turned unto fears, le<U+017F>t the <U+017F>tate which they had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<U+017F>hould revolt; and the utmo<U+017F>t limits of all their hopes was only to keep what
they had already gotten. <hi>Clidamant, Lindamore,</hi> and <hi>Guyemant,</hi> were much di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ed
at the alteration of this Prince, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Guyemant,</hi> as one mo<U+017F>t concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

advi<U+017F>ed <hi>Clidamant</hi> to return into his own Country, becau<U+017F>e this Prince was <U+017F>o
drowned in plea<U+017F>ures, that there was no more glory to be got by <U+017F>taying there,
<hi>Gayemant</hi> with tears in his eyes di<U+017F><U+017F>waded him, <U+017F>aying, that if any thing under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
would awake <hi>Childerick</hi> from his drow<U+017F>ie <U+017F>ecurity, it would be the genero<U+017F>ity
and virtue of <hi>Clidemant;</hi> and if <U+017F>o much happine<U+017F>s befel the <hi>Franks</hi> by his means,
he would get more glory by it then any other way: be<U+017F>ides, he was to con<U+017F>ider, that
he having a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted <hi>Merovius</hi> again<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many potent enemies, it would torn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly

                     <p>There was in the Court a young Cavalier called <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> Son unto one of
the mo<U+017F>t valiant Heroes of all the <hi>Franks:</hi> he had the honour to be educated with
this young Prince, when he was <U+017F>o young, as he was not fit to follow <hi>Merovius</hi> in

continually with young <hi>Childerick,</hi> and in<U+017F>tructed in all manner of Noble exerci<U+017F>es,
that might make them fit to <U+017F>erve their Prince and Country. And the<U+017F>e yourhs were
not only taught in all things requi<U+017F>ite unto courage and war, but al<U+017F>o in all things
that might poli<U+017F>h their minds, and temper the Natural Ferocity of the old Sicam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians,
and the inhabitants of the <hi>Meotidan</hi> Lake. Al<U+017F>o to render them more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
unto the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who are a people the mo<U+017F>t civilized of all <hi>Europe,</hi> they were
very often among<U+017F>t the young Ladies, which belonged unto the Queen <hi>Methina,</hi>
and there was <U+017F>uch pritty familiants among<U+017F>t them, as they would propound <U+017F>everal
marriages among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves: this Queen had command from the prudent <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
her Husbandi to entertain as many of the <hi>Gaul</hi> Ladies as <U+017F>he could, de<U+017F>igning
by this way to make him<U+017F>elf King of the <hi>Gaules</hi> by Love as well as by Arms.</p>
                     <p>Among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e that were thus entertained and educated during the infancy of
<hi>Childerick, Silviana</hi> had the fir<U+017F>t place, as well in re<U+017F>pect of her merit, as of her
family from whence <U+017F>he was extracted: This young Lady was adorned with all <U+017F>uch
qualities as have power to cau<U+017F>e Love; both Fortune and Nature had equally been
favourable unto her: And be<U+017F>ides her beauty which was very high, <U+017F>he had a wit <U+017F>o
<U+017F>weet, as all tho<U+017F>e whom her eyes attracted, were held by her courte<U+017F>y, and <U+017F>weet
conver<U+017F>ation. This young Lady was not yet above ten or eleven years of age; and
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> who was about thirteen or fourteen, did ca<U+017F>t an amorous glance upon
her: <hi>Silviana</hi> was e<U+017F>teemed the only Star about the Queen <hi>Methina;</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes</hi>
among<U+017F>t all tho<U+017F>e about <hi>Childerick</hi> carried away the commendations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for dancing, leaping, or any other exerci<U+017F>e of the body. Moreover he was of
<U+017F>uch a <U+017F>weet and tractable di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, that when he got the better of any of his
Companions, he was <U+017F>o far from in<U+017F>ulting, that none was <U+017F>orry to be <U+017F>urmounted by
him, but very willing to yeild unto him that glory which was his due.</p>
                     <p>At this age the young <hi>Andrimartes</hi> began to ca<U+017F>t an eye upon the Fair <hi>Silviana,</hi>
who being <U+017F>uch a beauty as could not be looked upon and not loved, he began to
court her, and give her <U+017F>uch te<U+017F>timonies of his affections as his green age could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.
Shee, who yet hardly knew the name of Love, received his boyi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ervices,
as other children u<U+017F>e to do, without any further de<U+017F>ign: yet in a little time <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to like him better then any of the re<U+017F>t, and re<U+017F>ented <U+017F>omthing which inclined
her to talk with him, and to be glad when he was with her from all the re<U+017F>t of her
companions, though this inclination yet could not be phra<U+017F>ed either love or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in her: But as the longer one <U+017F>tands by a fire, the more heat he feels; <U+017F>o <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes</hi>
could not hold <U+017F>uch intimate familiarity with <hi>Silviana,</hi> without kindling
<U+017F>uch <U+017F>parks of Love, as at length <U+017F>o inflamed his <U+017F>oul, that neither time nor any
thing el<U+017F>e could extingui<U+017F>h them.</p>
                     <p>The fir<U+017F>t time that he made it known unto her, was one evening when the Queen
<hi>Methina,</hi> according to her cu<U+017F>tome, went to walk upon the banks of <hi>Seine:</hi> for <U+017F>he
re<U+017F>ided mo<U+017F>t at <hi>Paris,</hi> as well becau<U+017F>e it was the center of the conque<U+017F>ts of <hi>Merovius,</hi>
as by rea<U+017F>on of an Oracle, which was lately received from the Temple of <hi>Ijis,</hi> and
which <U+017F>aid thus:
<q>
                           <pb n="50" facs="tcp:53527:128"/>
                           <l>WHen <hi>Paris</hi> is the Prime of Gaul,</l>
                           <l>A Gauli<U+017F>h <U+017F>tranger govern <U+017F>hall.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Merovius</hi> and the <hi>Franks</hi> thought that their Ance<U+017F>tors being <hi>Gaules,</hi> this
Oracle was <U+017F>poken of them; and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf that Madam you know how this
delectable River of <hi>Seine</hi> runs round about that City. And when the Queen went
to walk upon the banks of it, all the Ladies and Cavaliers waited upon her, and
walked al<U+017F>o two and two, where and how they plea<U+017F>ed. One evening therefore after
<U+017F>upper, <hi>Methina</hi> went to take the Air, and <hi>Andrimartes</hi> taking <hi>Silviana</hi> under her
arm, he entertained her as he was wont with his young affections, unto which <U+017F>he
an<U+017F>wered in as innocent Language, as infancy it <U+017F>elf could imagine: As they were
wandering among<U+017F>t the thick of the wood, they <U+017F>ate down at the fir<U+017F>t under an old
Willow, which grew by the River <U+017F>ide; but the young Lady, not liking to <U+017F>tay too
long in a place, and being weary with <U+017F>itting, <U+017F>he ro<U+017F>e up and went unto a little
tree of O<U+017F>iers; and making choi<U+017F>e of one who<U+017F>e bark was <U+017F>mooth and tender, <U+017F>he
had a mind to engrave her name upon it; <U+017F>o as taking a Gold Bodkin which <U+017F>he
wore in her hair, <U+017F>he engraved the Letters of <hi>Silviana. Andrimartes</hi> <U+017F>eeing what
<U+017F>he began to do, he went upon the other <U+017F>ide of the tree, and write upon the <U+017F>ame
<U+017F>talk, as if it were in the very <U+017F>ame line, the<U+017F>e words, <hi>I Love:</hi> <U+017F>o as what he writ,
meeting with what <hi>Silviana</hi> had written, both together made, <hi>I Love Silviana:</hi>
but <U+017F>he going on his <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>he could <U+017F>ee only what he had written; how <hi>Andrimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, do you Love? I be<U+017F>eech you who? You may <U+017F>ee Madam, (<U+017F>aid he
unto her) if you will plea<U+017F>e to read on the Line: For my part, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I <U+017F>ee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what you have written; look a little better Madam, (<U+017F>aid he) and you
may find that which is engraved upon my heart, as well as upon that bark: where
is the name, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that you <U+017F>peak of? Look well, <U+017F>aid <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and you
will find it not far off: I do not under<U+017F>tand you, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, for I <U+017F>ee nothing
but that which you writ; what then is this? (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and pointed
unto what <U+017F>he had engraved) That is <hi>Silviana,</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) Then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi>
joyn what I writ, and what you writ, together. I <U+017F>ee, replied <U+017F>he, that
by joyning them together, there is, <hi>I Love Silviana;</hi> but it was my <U+017F>elf that wrote
it: Mo<U+017F>t true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and it is you who has engraven it in my
heart. Your heart, replied <U+017F>he, and wondred, how could I do that, for I never
<U+017F>aw your heart? I know not Madam how you did it, an<U+017F>wered he, but I am <U+017F>ure
that with you Fair Eyes you have done it. Fie, fie, (cryed <U+017F>he out) I cannot believe it,
for my eyes cannot engrave, or if they could, I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>urely have <U+017F>een when they
did it; had they that quality, I <U+017F>hould not have u<U+017F>ed my Bodkin to engrave upon
this bark. This childi<U+017F>h an<U+017F>wer did plainly <U+017F>hew <hi>Andrimartes</hi> how ignorant <U+017F>he was
in matters of Love: yet for all that, he continued on; It is no wonder Madam, <U+017F>aid
he, that your Fair Eyes cannot engrave your Name upon a bark, becau<U+017F>e it is a
thing in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible; but <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I have often looked upon the Queens little dogs,
which <U+017F>he loves <U+017F>o well, and can you find one letter of my Name upon them? No,
no, replied he, they are animals without rea<U+017F>on; it is only upon the hearts of men,
and men who are mo<U+017F>t worthy of that character. How? <U+017F>aid <hi>Silviana,</hi> can I do it
and not perceive it? I be<U+017F>eech you Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> do you perceive your
<U+017F>elf to grow? Alas, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I do that naturally; and you do naturally, replied <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes,</hi>
make wounds in hearts. Oh my good God, replied <U+017F>he, I have heard
<U+017F>ay that all wounds upon the heart are mortal; and if my eyes have wounded yours,
I <U+017F>hall be the cau<U+017F>e of your death, and you will have all the rea<U+017F>on in the world to
hate me: Tis mo<U+017F>t certain, replied he, that all wounds upon the heart are mortal,
and tho<U+017F>e which you have given me will cau<U+017F>e my death, unle<U+017F>s you give me a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
but however, I cannot hate you, <U+017F>ince on the contrary, I think that I cannot love
you <U+017F>o much as I de<U+017F>ire, and as you de<U+017F>erve. I conceive the be<U+017F>t way will be, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
the young <hi>Silviana</hi>) that <U+017F>ince my eyes do hurt you <U+017F>o much, to hide them
from you for the future. By no means Madam I be<U+017F>eech you, an<U+017F>wered he, unle<U+017F>s
you would have me die, as <U+017F>oon as you begin that mortal remedy<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> for you mu<U+017F>t know,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53527:128"/>
that if any thing under Heaven can <U+017F>ave my life, it mu<U+017F>t be by giving me new
wounds. This remedy, (<U+017F>aid the young <hi>Silviana</hi>) is very <U+017F>trange, and lea<U+017F>t you
<U+017F>hould dye, I will not only do as you <U+017F>ay, but de<U+017F>ire all my companions to do the
<U+017F>ame, in hopes that the multitude of wounds which their eyes do make, may ea<U+017F>e
you in tho<U+017F>e you receive from me: The eyes of your companions (an<U+017F>wered he)
can neither hurt nor heal me: what difference (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) do you find betwixt my eyes
and theirs? For my part, I know not any. There is <U+017F>o much, replied <hi>Andrimartes,</hi>
That I had rather be dead then want the lea<U+017F>t wound which I have from you, and I
would accord theirs as much as I can. I do not under<U+017F>tand (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) why you
<U+017F>hould think <U+017F>o; for wounds are wounds, from whom<U+017F>oever they be received. There
are (replied <hi>Andrimartes</hi>) wounds that are honourable and plea<U+017F>ing, and others
that are ignominious and painful: tho<U+017F>e which I receive from you are of the fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ort; and tho<U+017F>e which your companions can give are of the other. I cannot imagine
(an<U+017F>wered the young <hi>Silviana</hi>) what the difference <U+017F>hould be. If there were other
<hi>Silvianas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Andrimartes</hi>) as Fair and full of Excellencies as you are, and as able
by their beauty to make <U+017F>uch welcom wounds, I <U+017F>hould then agree with you that
they would be all de<U+017F>irable alike; but <U+017F>ince that cannot be, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf Madam,
I <U+017F>hall think nothing to be a favour or a remedy which comes not from your Faire<U+017F>t
<U+017F>elf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silviana</hi> was very young, and yet not <U+017F>o young, but hearing <hi>Andrimartes</hi> <U+017F>peak
thus, <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood his good will unto her; for <U+017F>elf love is <U+017F>o natural unto us, that
nothing does oblige more, at what age <U+017F>oever, then a good e<U+017F>teem which is held of
us; and that made him to return this an<U+017F>wer: the good opinion which you have of
me, moves you unto this language; but believe it <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> you are as much
obliged unto it by the good opinion which I have of you. Perhaps their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
had gone farther, but for the coming of <hi>Childerick,</hi> who with a great number of
young boyes came running and leaping through tho<U+017F>e woods, and parted them;
for this young Prince carried away <hi>Andrimartes</hi> almo<U+017F>t by force to leap and exerci<U+017F>e
with his companions, as he who excelled them all in agility and nimblene<U+017F>s. He left
the Fair <hi>Silviana</hi> with an ill will, and <U+017F>he remained alone with no le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure;
for though till then <U+017F>he never had the lea<U+017F>t re<U+017F>entment of Love, yet the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
infu<U+017F>ed <U+017F>trange imaginations into her fancy; and pre<U+017F>ently after, con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
upon the merits and perfections of the young <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and calling into
memory the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his particular good will unto her: Love did begin <U+017F>o
gently to <U+017F>cratch the skin, that it became <U+017F>uch an itch, as by degrees became a
wound incurable.</p>
                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Andrimartes</hi> could <U+017F>teal away from <hi>Childerick,</hi> he returned to
<hi>Silviana,</hi> begging a thou<U+017F>and pardons for leaving her alone, and excu<U+017F>ing it with
the force which that young Prince u<U+017F>ed unto him. I cannot blame him, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Silviana,</hi> nor your friends, for de<U+017F>iring the happine<U+017F>s of your company. Oh Madam,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that you would rank your <U+017F>elf in that number, and think
it a happine<U+017F>s to have my company. Do you doubt of either? (replied <hi>Silviana</hi>)
No, no, <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> you have merits enow, to make all become your friends, and
de<U+017F>ire your company, and I have known you too long not to e<U+017F>teem them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
Madam (an<U+017F>wered he) I <U+017F>hould think this evening the happie<U+017F>t time of all
my life, could I think the Fair <hi>Silviana</hi> did ever daign to ca<U+017F>t her Fair eye upon my
actions, and if I could have any a<U+017F><U+017F>urance in what you are now plea<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ay. The
young <hi>Silviana,</hi> not dreaming that Love would oblige a heart to give it <U+017F>elf away,
but thinking it only a piece of plea<U+017F>ing complai<U+017F>ance and delight in the company of
one per<U+017F>on with another, <U+017F>he did believe that <hi>Andrimartes</hi> did Love her, and al<U+017F>o
did intend to Love him, as a Si<U+017F>ter may Love a Brother, or a Daughter a Father;
and therefore according to the innocency of her age, and <U+017F>implicity of her <U+017F>oul, <U+017F>he
an<U+017F>wered him thus. Be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that I do really Love you; and
whereas you de<U+017F>ire to have <U+017F>ome a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of my words, I will mo<U+017F>t willingly give
it, prote<U+017F>ting unto you, that I do not Love any Brother <U+017F>o well as I do you. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes</hi>
who was older, and more capable of Love then <U+017F>he, did know very well
that all this was but the words of a child; yet thinking that he had already brought
her to a very good pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, he contented him<U+017F>elf for that time, hoping that time and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53527:129"/>
continuance of his Court<U+017F>hip would work this innocent Love into <U+017F>uch a perfect af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as he de<U+017F>ired; and therefore taking her hand, he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it, and with a <U+017F>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
look <U+017F>aid, Now Madam, do I think my <U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t happy and be<U+017F>t contented
man alive, <U+017F>ince I have received this declaration from you, which I de<U+017F>ire above all
the world: only one thing more I be<U+017F>eech you Madam let me beg, which is, that
you will be con<U+017F>tant unto this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance which you have given me, and that you will
be plea<U+017F>ed to let me bear the name of your Brother, and to call you Si<U+017F>ter, as an
obligation unto us to continue in this amity: With all my heart (an<U+017F>wered the
young Lady) and I do promi<U+017F>e to Love and e<U+017F>teem you as much as if you were my
Brother. <hi>Andrimartes</hi> would have an<U+017F>wered, had it not began to rain, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
them both to remove: however, <U+017F>ince that day, he courted this young and Fair
Lady <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, as by degrees he taught her know, that Love was not to be confined
by the Laws of Friend<U+017F>hip, nor kept within compa<U+017F>s of a meer good will; for in a
few days <U+017F>he loved him in <U+017F>uch a height, as <U+017F>he perceived it to be a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
for her to make a retreat: So as one day when <U+017F>he met him upon the banks of <hi>Seine,</hi>
where <hi>Methina,</hi> according to her cu<U+017F>tom, was walking, and taking an occa<U+017F>ion to
retire them<U+017F>elves under a <U+017F>hade of Trees, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto him; Do you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
brother (for <U+017F>o <U+017F>he called him) what di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e we had in this place, when I
engraved my name upon the bark of yonder Tree? Doubtle<U+017F>s I do Si<U+017F>ter, (an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Andrimartes</hi>) and <U+017F>hall remember it as long as I live: no time is able to de<U+017F>ace
it out of my memory; for it was then I received my greate<U+017F>t hopes of happine<U+017F>s
from you. What did I then <U+017F>ay, replied <U+017F>he, which gave you <U+017F>o much contentment?
The<U+017F>e Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, were your own words; Be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that
I do really Love you. Brother (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silviana</hi>) will you have me confe<U+017F>s the truth
unto you? I would have you believe (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled) that when I <U+017F>poke tho<U+017F>e
words I knew not what I <U+017F>aid: how Si<U+017F>ter! replied he pre<U+017F>ently, not know what
you <U+017F>aid? Certainly I did not, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, for how could I give you a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of
a thing which I was ignorant of, and did not know? Then, <U+017F>aid he unto her, you
did deceive me: 'Tis true indeed (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silviana</hi>) I did deceive you; but it was
when I was fir<U+017F>t deceived my <U+017F>elf: for I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, that when I <U+017F>aid I did Love
you, I did not know what it was to Love; and yet the good will which I had unto
you, did make me think it was Love, which was only a childi<U+017F>h kind of an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> hearing her <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, he was a little <U+017F>tartled, fearing that <U+017F>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to break her promi<U+017F>e with this excu<U+017F>e: But <U+017F>he who had other intentions <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him <U+017F>o mute, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting the cau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>ilence; Brother (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) be not
troubled at what I <U+017F>ay, for it is only to give you a fuller a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of that affection
which I have unto you; let me tell you now, that I am more knowing then I was
then; and am better able to di<U+017F>cern your merits and affection to me: I know now
what it is to Love; not only as a Brother, but as <hi>Andrimartes;</hi> and knowing this,
I do prote<U+017F>t unto you, that I do Love you as well as you ought to de<U+017F>ire. <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes</hi>
hearing this welcom expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, kneeled down upon the ground, and <U+017F>aid;
Should I employ all my dayes in thanks Madam, and <U+017F>pend all my blood in doing
you <U+017F>ervice, I were not able to recompence you for this happine<U+017F>s which you have
conferred upon me by this declaration: but <U+017F>ince you are plea<U+017F>ed to be <U+017F>o infinitely
good, give me leave to beg, that you will al<U+017F>o be plea<U+017F>ed to compleat this my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F>s.
What is it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silviana,</hi> that I can <U+017F>ay more? Have I not profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that
now I do know what it is to Love, and that I do Love <hi>Andrimartes</hi> as much as he
ought to de<U+017F>ire? I de<U+017F>ire a little more Madam, an<U+017F>wered he, for perhaps you may
<U+017F>ay that I ought not to de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>o much as I do. Then <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he,
I do Love you as much as I oght to do: yet a little more, good Madam, an<U+017F>wered
he, for there is not among<U+017F>t men that can a<U+017F><U+017F>ume <U+017F>o much honour to him<U+017F>elf as to
<U+017F>ay that you ought to Love him: Then replied <U+017F>he, I do Love <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> as well
as he does Love me: upon this, <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was <U+017F>atisfied. Now, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silviana,</hi> I
will go further, and do more then you de<U+017F>ire; for I do Love <hi>Andrimartes</hi> more
then he Loves me: and I vow by all the Nymphs and Deities of the River, that I will
never Love any el<U+017F>e: Only one thing Brother I <U+017F>hall reque<U+017F>t, which is, that you
will promi<U+017F>e me upon your Faith, never to de<U+017F>ire of me any thing which my honour

                     <p>When this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed betwixt them, <hi>Silviana</hi> was about thirteen or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of age, and <hi>Andrimartes</hi> about <U+017F>ixteen or <U+017F>eventeen, an age <U+017F>o apt to
take all amorous impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, that Love did imprint in their young hearts all the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of it <U+017F>elf: <U+017F>o as ever <U+017F>ince that time, they did both <U+017F>o grow in affection, that
had not their young and familiar education together been an umbrage for all their
amorous actions, and <U+017F>hadowed them with a vail of courte<U+017F>y and long acquaintance,
certainly many had taken notice of it: but <U+017F>ince this familiarity did begin when they
were little children, none did wonder at their kindne<U+017F>s unto each other, e<U+017F>pecially
both of them being yet but very young.</p>
                     <p>Thus they did live together in all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>atisfaction and contentment, waiting
until <U+017F>uch time as they could hand<U+017F>omly procure the con<U+017F>ent of their Parents unto a
marriage. And this happy condition la<U+017F>ted until <U+017F>uch time as <hi>Childerick</hi> did unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ca<U+017F>t his eye upon this <U+017F>hinning Star: for <U+017F>eeing her at a Ball where <hi>Silviana</hi> was
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, according to the cu<U+017F>tom of the Romans, he took <U+017F>uch a liking to her, that
ever <U+017F>ince he loved her mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perately: <hi>Silviana</hi> took notice of it pre<U+017F>ently; and
becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought it would be a <U+017F>in unpardonable in her, if <U+017F>he did not impart all
that <U+017F>he knew unto her dear Brother, as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him, <U+017F>he acquainted
him with all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages: <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was apt to believe it; Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid he unto
her) it is no wonder if all the World do Love you; but mu<U+017F>t your ambition to be
the Mi<U+017F>tris of a Kings Son, extingui<U+017F>h your affection unto a Brother? And mu<U+017F>t I
be the widdowed Turtle left de<U+017F>olate without a Companion? Brother, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he
then unto him, and took his hand) be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that you <U+017F>hall never be the Turtle
which you <U+017F>peak of, until death do ravi<U+017F>h me from you: and if I thought any <U+017F>uch
doubt did enter into your <U+017F>oul, the affection which I bear unto you would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
angry: be confident <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that death it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>hall not alter my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
for I will pre<U+017F>erve it unto that <U+017F>econd life, which our <hi>Druides</hi> tell us of
after this: Here Brother, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) take this Ring; and if you be the <U+017F>ame <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes,</hi>
which I take you to be, <U+017F>ummon me by it either in this or the next life, to
keep that promi<U+017F>e which now I do mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olemnly confirm for ever unto you.</p>
                     <p>I want words, Madam, wherewith to expre<U+017F>s the joyes of young <hi>Andrimartes;</hi>
he fell down upon his knees, he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her hand, and the Ring which <U+017F>he gave him, a
hundred times, with a vow to pre<U+017F>ent it unto her at that time when <U+017F>he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him. Then taking a pin and pricking that finger whereon he wore the Ring, he
cau<U+017F>ed it to bleed in <U+017F>everal places, and making his handkerchief all bloody, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented
it unto <hi>Silviana:</hi> Madam (<U+017F>aid he unto her) I do <U+017F>eal the vow which I have
made with my blood, and I conjure you to re<U+017F>tore me this handkerchief when you
command me to re<U+017F>tore unto you this Ring; to the end that by the<U+017F>e marks both
the living and the dead may know how great the affection is which <hi>Andrimartes</hi>
bears unto <hi>Silviana,</hi> and how happy this affection has been above its merits, in
meeting with her reciprocal affection. Thus did Love link the hearts of the<U+017F>e two
young Lovers together with fa<U+017F>ter knots, as if all the powers upon earth were not
able to unty them.</p>
                     <p>But for all that, <hi>Childerick</hi> continued his begun Love, which grew to that height,
that he could not enjoy any contentment nor re<U+017F>t, but when he was with her. At the
fir<U+017F>t, le<U+017F>t <hi>Merovius</hi> <U+017F>hould be adverti<U+017F>ed of it, he hid his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion as much as he
could, and this was the rea<U+017F>on why he dur<U+017F>t not in words declare it unto <hi>Silviana,</hi>
though all his actions did make it <U+017F>o apparent unto every one, as it was a thing <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
to tell her that which none was ignorant of.</p>
                     <p>At the <U+017F>ame time, taking infinite delight in looking upon her, he commanded
an Arti<U+017F>t to take her Picture unknown unto her, thinking that <U+017F>he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it otherwi<U+017F>e: and the Picture-drawer was <U+017F>o ready to <U+017F>atisfie this young Prince,
as he took her Picture very exqui<U+017F>itely, at two or three times <U+017F>eeing her in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
when <hi>Childerick</hi> <U+017F>aw it, he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it a thou<U+017F>and times; and thinking that his

meeting her in the Anti-chamber of the Queen his Mother, he took her a<U+017F>ide and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53527:130"/>
<U+017F>aid thus unto her; Fair <hi>Silviana,</hi> I can tel you <U+017F>ome news, which perhaps you are
ignorant of; for you think your <U+017F>elf to be the only Daughter of your Mother, yet
let me tell you, that you have a Si<U+017F>ter: Did I think this news to be true, Sir, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Silviana,</hi> I <U+017F>hould think it the be<U+017F>t that ever I heard, and think my <U+017F>elf much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
unto you for telling me of it. You have good rea<U+017F>on to be glad of it (<U+017F>aid <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>)
for though <U+017F>he be not <U+017F>o fair as you are, yet <U+017F>he does very much re<U+017F>emble
you; and becau<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>hall be judge whether or no I <U+017F>peak the truth, pray look
upon this. As <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Silviana</hi> <U+017F>aw it, <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently knew it, and <U+017F>tarted to
<U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elf in any other hands then tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and de<U+017F>iring to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, he gave it unto her. After <U+017F>he had a while looked upon it, and not knowing
how to get it hand<U+017F>omly from him; <U+017F>he threw it into the fire, and it was burned
before <hi>Childerick</hi> took notice of it, yet <U+017F>he did not ca<U+017F>t it into the fire <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, as <U+017F>he
repented of her ha<U+017F>te, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw that young Prince <U+017F>tand as if he were planet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truck
with amazement, and to excu<U+017F>e her <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort: Oh God Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
it was <U+017F>o ill-favouredly done, that I could not endure to <U+017F>ee my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o ugly. <hi>Silviana,</hi>
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Childerick,</hi> you have angered me to the <U+017F>oul, and I cannot tell whether
I have patience enough to endure it. Sir, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Silviana,</hi> and blu<U+017F>ht; I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<U+017F>orry for it: but the truth is, it was <U+017F>o very ill done, that I had rather have
<U+017F>een the Picture of death then it. Love and anger had now a great debate in the
heart of this offended Prince; but Love, at la<U+017F>t triumphing; I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee (<U+017F>aid he)
whether that was your rea<U+017F>on or no, or whether you did it as an affront unto me;
for if it be as you <U+017F>ay, then you will permit that another be taken with more lei<U+017F>ure,
that the Arti<U+017F>t may do it better then he could the fir<U+017F>t: but if you deny me this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t,
then I have rea<U+017F>on to think that you did it by way of affront, and that you
<U+017F>corn a Prince who never adored any but your <U+017F>elf. The young <hi>Silviana</hi> fearing the
di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure of her friends, was con<U+017F>trained to grant what he de<U+017F>ired in <U+017F>uch a civil
and courteous manner, as he could not chu<U+017F>e but be very well contented with this
<U+017F>atisfaction. Will you permit (<U+017F>aid the Prince) that another Picture may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?
Sir, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, I will permit any thing you plea<U+017F>e as far as is in me; but
doubtle<U+017F>s the Queen will take it very ill if I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>uffer it without her permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or
at lea<U+017F>t without the permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of my governe<U+017F>s. It is enough, <U+017F>aid <hi>Childerick,</hi> that
I know I have your con<U+017F>ent unto what I de<U+017F>ire, and that you threw the Picture into
the fire, only becau<U+017F>e it was ill done. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to be much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at her <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing him, la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome by-<U+017F>tanders <U+017F>hould take notice of it,

                     <p>If this Picture were good for nothing el<U+017F>e, yet it <U+017F>erved this young Prince to make
his Love known unto <hi>Silviana,</hi> for this young Lady dur<U+017F>t not but receive all that he
<U+017F>aid with a favourable a<U+017F>pect, la<U+017F>t otherwi<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould complain again<U+017F>t her for ca<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Picture <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>tily in the fire: and continuing <U+017F>till his Court<U+017F>hip, he omitted
no occa<U+017F>ion which might te<U+017F>tifie the grandeur of his affection to her: and becau<U+017F>e it
is extream hard for the violent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Love to be confined unto the limits of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
and di<U+017F>cretion, it <U+017F>o increa<U+017F>ed, that very often tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the Laws of mode<U+017F>ty,
it hapned one day hearing her <U+017F>ing, that he was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with this pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
of Love, that though it was among<U+017F>t many Ladies and Cavaliers, yet he could
not forbear from ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <hi>per</hi> force. <hi>Silviana</hi> having no inclination at all unto
<hi>Childerick,</hi> <U+017F>eemed to be extreamly offended with him for this violence, and <U+017F>eeing
it was done in the face of all the Court, <U+017F>he made many great complaints again<U+017F>t
him; and the rather, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was pre<U+017F>ent, unto whom <U+017F>he would not
give the lea<U+017F>t thought, that the Court<U+017F>hip of <hi>Childerick</hi> was able to alter her from
her vowed re<U+017F>olution. But the young Prince, though he <U+017F>aw her much offended,
yet he turned all to rallary, and laughed it out,</p>
                     <p>But yet <hi>Silviana</hi> would not take the continuation of his Love as in je<U+017F>t; and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes,</hi>
as good a face as he <U+017F>et upon the matter, yet was he netled to <U+017F>ee his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
become his Rival; knowing very well that Love and Dominion will not admit
of any Companions: and therefore he re<U+017F>olved to ask the Queens con<U+017F>ent to marry
<hi>Silviana;</hi> but becau<U+017F>e he would not do any thing that might di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e <hi>Silviana,</hi> he

leave <hi>Silviana</hi> <U+017F>olely unto him, who<U+017F>e favour he hoped more ea<U+017F>ily to obtain wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this young man was out of her eye, who he <U+017F>aw wi<U+017F>hed him very well. Every thing
thus favouring the de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> he was dubbed a Knight by the hands of
<hi>Childerick,</hi> who had received the <U+017F>ame honour a little before from the hand of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovius.</hi>
When <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was to be girt with the Sword, and demanded what
Lady he would make choi<U+017F>e of to be his Mi<U+017F>tris, he kneeled down, and be<U+017F>eeched
the Fair <hi>Silviana</hi> to let him make choi<U+017F>e of her, that he might make it his boa<U+017F>t,
that he received his honours from the Faire<U+017F>t Hand, and Faire<U+017F>t Lady that lives.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Childerick</hi> was extreamly <U+017F>urprized at this reque<U+017F>t, and was ready to break out
into <U+017F>ome violent demon<U+017F>trations of his di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, yet the pre<U+017F>ence of the King his
Father re<U+017F>trained him, though not from blu<U+017F>hing, and letting many <U+017F>ee how much
this Act di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed him; and much more was he incen<U+017F>ed when he <U+017F>aw in what a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner this Fair Lady gave con<U+017F>ent unto the reque<U+017F>t which <hi>Andrimartes</hi> made,
and expre<U+017F>s her contentment by her eyes, and all her actions. But the joyes of this
young Knight was unimaginable, when thanking her for the favour which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he prote<U+017F>ted and vowed to imploy both his <U+017F>word and his life in her <U+017F>ervice: And
<U+017F>he, who never offered to hide the good will which <U+017F>he bore unto him, knowing
that ere long he would ask the Queens con<U+017F>ent unto a marriage, prayed heartily unto
<hi>He<U+017F>us</hi> to make his Sword victorious, and <U+017F>aid, that <U+017F>he would with all her heart do
any thing within the compa<U+017F>s of her power, to te<U+017F>tifie the great e<U+017F>teem which <U+017F>he
had of his merits. But Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I neither will, nor can confer this favour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you without the Queens con<U+017F>ent, who has the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of me. <hi>Andrimartes</hi>
thinking that <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke with much di<U+017F>cretion, he kneeled down before <hi>Methina;</hi>
Madam, (<U+017F>aid he unto her) Is it your plea<U+017F>ure I <U+017F>hould this day receive the greate<U+017F>t
honour that ever I can pretend unto? <hi>Childerick</hi> tran<U+017F>ported at this beyond all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
interrupted him and <U+017F>aid; Me thinks <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that unle<U+017F>s you were too
impudent, you would never offer to make this reque<U+017F>t unto the Queen and <hi>Silviana,</hi>
until you had by <U+017F>ome noble action made your <U+017F>elf worthy of it, <hi>Andrimartes</hi> who
knew very well what it was which made <hi>Childerick</hi> <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o; Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto him,
I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s that I do not de<U+017F>erve this favour and honour; but yet I ask it
out of a de<U+017F>ire I have of doing you <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice: and I know that when once I am
honoured with the Title of <hi>Silvianas</hi> Knight, that glorious name will <U+017F>o invigorate
and encourage my <U+017F>pirits, as no enterpri<U+017F>e can be <U+017F>o difficult, but I <U+017F>hall bring it
happily to pa<U+017F>s. This thought, an<U+017F>wered the angry Prince, were good, if it were
not unju<U+017F>t: But it is not rea<U+017F>onable you <U+017F>hould a<U+017F><U+017F>ume unto your <U+017F>elf a name which
cannot be merited but with blood. My blood, replied the young Cavalier pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<U+017F>hall never be <U+017F>pared in <U+017F>uch a cau<U+017F>e, no more then my life in the <U+017F>ervice of the
King: But Sir, I find my <U+017F>elf much mi<U+017F>taken in my hopes; for I thought that in
this, and upon all other occa<U+017F>ions, you would have been my Protector, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53527:131"/>
thered me all you could, as a Prince, unto whom I am devoted both by nature and
my own inclination. <hi>Childerick</hi> would have an<U+017F>wered, and perhaps according to
the violence of his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, if <hi>Merovius</hi> mi<U+017F>liking the action of his Son, had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo<U+017F>ed;
and to cover the imprudence of <hi>Childerick,</hi> <U+017F>aid thus, You had rea<U+017F>on
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> to expect all favour from <hi>Childerick:</hi> I know that he intends it, and I do
command him unto it; what he <U+017F>aid was only by way of rallary, and both he and I
will become your Mediators unto the Queen, to con<U+017F>ent that <hi>Silviana</hi> may receive
you as her Knight; for it is but rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>o Fair a Lady <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>o brave a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
for her Knight. The young man all tran<U+017F>ported with joy, offered to ki<U+017F>s the
hands of <hi>Childerick</hi> and the King, and though the young Prince did permit him, yet
it was with <U+017F>uch a brow, as plainly <U+017F>hewed that he did it only out of re<U+017F>pect unto the
King: and though <hi>Methina</hi> <U+017F>aw this as well as <hi>Merovius,</hi> yet <U+017F>he commanded
<hi>Silviana</hi> to receive <hi>Andrimartes</hi> as her Knight, <U+017F>ince the King did approve of it.
The young Lady never obeyed any command more willingly then this, and did it
with a face <U+017F>o full of contentment, as every one took <U+017F>pecial notice of it: This did
<U+017F>o <U+017F>ting the heart of <hi>Childerick,</hi> that he re<U+017F>olved, what<U+017F>oever came of it, to break off
this Love which went <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t his heart.</p>
                     <p>And becau<U+017F>e he knew that he had too much di<U+017F>covered his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and that the
King was not well plea<U+017F>ed with it, he con<U+017F>trained him<U+017F>elf as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he
could, to make it believed that what he had done was only out of rallary, as <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
<U+017F>aid: but there was not one in all the company which did not know the contrary,
e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> who knew very well that it proceeded from his affection
unto <hi>Silviana,</hi> and well did plainly fore<U+017F>ee many a <U+017F>torm towards from him: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
come what come could, he re<U+017F>olved to continue his Love; and becau<U+017F>e that
Honourable Order of Knight-hood, which he had taken upon him, was an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon him to <U+017F>hake off the drow<U+017F>ie life of being always among women, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to quit that idle and effeminate kind of life, and to go into the Army as <U+017F>oon
as he had obtained <hi>Silvianas</hi> leave, and not to return until <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ignal act had <U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him meritorious of the Fair Lady. She who <U+017F>aw a kind of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity upon him to
take this cour<U+017F>e, and thought that it would much conduce unto that contentment
which they both aimed at; <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ented unto it, though with abundance of <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to part with him: and knowing that it was the Kings cu<U+017F>tom to incite all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
young Spirits unto gallant actions, and to recompence tho<U+017F>e that by their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
did <U+017F>ignalize them<U+017F>elves in the Army; they did both of them overcome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
and with a River of Tears parted, in hope that their ab<U+017F>ence would bring
them to their de<U+017F>ired end, <U+017F>ooner then their pre<U+017F>ence.</p>
                     <p>To relate all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of this <U+017F>ad parting, and the demon<U+017F>trations of good will
unto each other, is neither pertinent to the <U+017F>tory, nor indeed po<U+017F><U+017F>ible: let it <U+017F>uffice
therefore, that <hi>Silviana</hi> expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her affection as far as her mode<U+017F>ty and honour
would permit, and <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> as became a perfect and noble minded Lover. But
I conceive it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to acquaint you with the <U+017F>equel of this de<U+017F>ign when he was in
the Army, though the day be not long enough to relate the hundred part of his
brave deportments; for he gave <U+017F>uch te<U+017F>timony of his courage and valour, that
<hi>Merovius</hi> made choi<U+017F>e of him to command that relief which he <U+017F>ent into <hi>Belgium,</hi>
again<U+017F>t the children of King <hi>Clodion, Renald</hi> and <hi>Alberick;</hi> who being come at full
age, <hi>Alberick</hi> being Lord of <hi>Cambray</hi> and the bordering Countries, and <hi>Renald</hi>
Duke of <hi>Au<U+017F>tra<U+017F>ia,</hi> and having married <hi>Hu<U+017F>emide,</hi> Daughter unto <hi>Multiades</hi>
King of Tongres, they contracted a league with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and with a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Army, fell into <hi>Au<U+017F>tra<U+017F>ia,</hi> <U+017F>o as had not <hi>Merovius</hi> very prudently <U+017F>ent this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
under the conduct of the valiant <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> certainly their Arms had reached
as far as the gates of <hi>Paris;</hi> and perhaps had not only retarded all the conque<U+017F>ts of
this Valiant King, but al<U+017F>o, had put his very Crown into great hazard. But the
Valour and Prudence of <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was <U+017F>uch, that giving a <U+017F>top unto the progre<U+017F>s
of the<U+017F>e two brothers, he con<U+017F>trained them to keep within the confines of <hi>Au<U+017F>tra<U+017F>ia,</hi>
until <hi>Merovius</hi> had quelled tho<U+017F>e enemies which the Romans had <U+017F>ecretly <U+017F>tirred
up again<U+017F>t him: and this piece of <U+017F>ervice was <U+017F>o great, that <hi>Merovius</hi> did highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
it; and thought no recompence <U+017F>ufficient for <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ervices as he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the brave <hi>Andrimartes.</hi>
                     </p>

It is a hard matter to expre<U+017F>s the joys of <hi>Silviana,</hi> when <U+017F>he heard of all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
exploits of her beloved <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ence <U+017F>he did infinitely de<U+017F>ire,
that <U+017F>he might rejoyce with him for his happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s: and yet <U+017F>he was well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his ab<U+017F>ence, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf was a <U+017F>harer in his glory, and <U+017F>ince it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<U+017F>o much unto the advantage of the Crown of the <hi>Franks;</hi> <U+017F>hewing her <U+017F>elf
by her wi<U+017F>e and virtuous moderation, to be the Grand-child of <hi>Semmon</hi> Duke of
<hi>Gaul Armorique,</hi> the faithful friend of King <hi>Merovius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was not a man who did not love, and highly commend the Valiant and Wi<U+017F>e
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> (and for <U+017F>ix years together which he continued in the Army, he met
not with one accident which did not end in happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s) <hi>Childerick</hi> only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
who grudged at all his victories, though they were all to the advantage of that
Crown which he was to inherit after <hi>Merovius:</hi> but his love being above his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he di<U+017F>liked all his actions, and detracted from his glory as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
he could; knowing very well, that all the<U+017F>e applaudes of him would kindle the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which <hi>Silviana</hi> bore unto him. But at length, <hi>Andrimartes</hi> not being able to
live any longer from his adored Lady, though he received Letters continually from
her, he obtained leave from the King to return unto <hi>Paris,</hi> to <U+017F>ettle <U+017F>ome affaires
which he pretended, did require his pre<U+017F>ence. He pre<U+017F>ented him<U+017F>elf therefore unto
the Queen, who received him with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible welcom; and he thought it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to <U+017F>trike now whil<U+017F>t the Iron was hot, and <U+017F>peak unto the Queen concerning his
marriage: and in order-thereunto, he entreated a neer Co<U+017F>en of his to make this
reque<U+017F>t unto the Queen in his behalf. <hi>Methina</hi> who was well acquainted with the
merits of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and con<U+017F>idered what <U+017F>ignal <U+017F>ervices he had done the King
her Husband, <U+017F>he was very glad of any occa<U+017F>ion to give <U+017F>atisfaction unto his de<U+017F>ire;
and to te<U+017F>tifie how <U+017F>he approved of that marriage: Tell <hi>Andrimartes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto
the party that was imployed to deliver the reque<U+017F>t unto her) that I do not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
unto his de<U+017F>ire; but al<U+017F>o <hi>Silviana</hi> being Grand-child unto <hi>Semnon</hi> our dear
friend, I promi<U+017F>e him to procure his good will, and the Kings al<U+017F>o: and in te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of my forwardne<U+017F>s to gratifie him all the wayes I am able, I do allow him
to live with her, not only as her <U+017F>ervant, but al<U+017F>o as him that is to be her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                     <p>This an<U+017F>wer which was as favourable as <hi>Andrimartes</hi> could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly hope for,
was received with <U+017F>o much joy, that it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to keep it <U+017F>ecret: <U+017F>o as
the news of it was pre<U+017F>ently all over the Court and Army; and <hi>Methina</hi> having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Merovius</hi> with it, it plea<U+017F>ed him <U+017F>o well, that he <U+017F>poke of it openly, and
<U+017F>aid, that he was obliged to acknowledg the <U+017F>ervices of that brave Cavalier, in the
highe<U+017F>t manner: <U+017F>o as to defer his <U+017F>atisfaction no longer, he pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>patched a
Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger to Duke <hi>Semnon</hi> his dear and ancient friend, to procure his con<U+017F>ent unto
this marriage, promi<U+017F>ing to advance <hi>Andrimartes</hi> unto <U+017F>uch a height, as he <U+017F>hould
never repent of be<U+017F>towing his Grand-child upon him.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Childerick</hi> hearing this news, fir<U+017F>t by the letters of the Queen his Mother, and
afterwards by the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Merovius</hi> his Father, he was <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at it, that
he could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>peak of it unto him, under a pretence of doing him <U+017F>ervice;
Sir, (<U+017F>aid he unto him, finding him alone) I do under<U+017F>tand by the Queens let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and al<U+017F>o by your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e this morning, that <hi>Andrimartes</hi> intends to marry
<hi>Silviana:</hi> now Sir, the <U+017F>ervice which I ow unto you, commands me to hint unto
you a thing which I think worthy of your con<U+017F>ideration. And though I do not
doubt of your high prudence, yet your multitude of other great affairs, makes me
fear that you have not time to think upon things of lower importance. I mu<U+017F>t needs
confe<U+017F>s Sir, that the <U+017F>ervices of this Cavalier does de<U+017F>erve a recompence, but not <U+017F>o
far as to make you commit a greater offence again<U+017F>t <hi>Semnon</hi> your dear friend &amp; ally,
and al<U+017F>o again<U+017F>t your <U+017F>elf: for certainly recompen<U+017F>es ought never to be made to the
di<U+017F>-advantage of our friends, or <U+017F>uch as tru<U+017F>t us with things that are mo<U+017F>t dear unto
them: <hi>Semnon</hi> Sir, you know, is Duke of <hi>Gaul Armorique;</hi> it was he who at your
fir<U+017F>t coming into this Country received you into his friend<U+017F>hip; a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted you with all
his <U+017F>trength and coun<U+017F>el; and it may be <U+017F>aid, that he and <hi>Guyveline</hi> Governour of
the <hi>Edvois,</hi> were the two <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t Pillars, upon which you laid the foundation of
your Dominion. Is it therefore rea<U+017F>onable Sir, that if he tru<U+017F>t you with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53527:132"/>
who is to be the <U+017F>upport and comfort of his age, you <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her
without his con<U+017F>ent? Or is it fit, to propound a match <U+017F>o unequal and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>-advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
unto him? Will you Sir, let it be <U+017F>aid that <hi>Merovius</hi> does recompence his
<U+017F>ervants at the charges of his neighbour Princes and friends? Pardon me Sir, for
<U+017F>peaking <U+017F>o boldly unto you; and if it be a crime, blame my natural de<U+017F>ire to cleer
your name from a<U+017F>per<U+017F>ion, which I know is contrary to your intention, and al your
former actions: not but that I do think it rea<U+017F>onable, and worthy of commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in you, to remunerate <hi>Andrimartes:</hi> But then Sir, I be<U+017F>eech you, let it be out
of your own charges, and with <U+017F>omthing in which you have an intere<U+017F>t; in <U+017F>o doing,
you will get the name of a Generous and Magnanimous Prince: you will then be
called the King of <hi>Hearts</hi> as well as of <hi>Franks;</hi> there are other matches in your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which <hi>Andrimartes</hi> him<U+017F>elf cannot chu<U+017F>e but think much more <U+017F>utable and fit
for him, then <hi>Silviana,</hi> whom if he pretend unto, in lieu of getting friends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him<U+017F>elf by that unequal alliance, he will draw a mortal odium upon him<U+017F>elf, and
have enemies that will never pardon that offence which he <U+017F>hall commit by your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tigation.
Thus without advantage to him<U+017F>elf, he will cau<U+017F>e you to lo<U+017F>e that credit
and amity, which you have gotten with <U+017F>o much paines, and which with <U+017F>o much
care and prudence you have hitherto pre<U+017F>erved with all that know you. Do not
think Sir, that I am the fir<U+017F>t Authour of the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, for many of your
be<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervants that dare not tell you as much, have addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves unto me,
thinking that great Princes who are full of high imployments, will not reflect upon
things of a lower <U+017F>phere, which though <U+017F>mall in them<U+017F>elves, yet may draw after
them many dangerous con<U+017F>equences: I believe if <hi>Andrimartes</hi> did but con<U+017F>ider of
what importance, or rather what prejudice this marriage will be unto your <U+017F>ervice,
he would be the fir<U+017F>t (as deeply in love as he is) that would decline it; I am confident
he would not offer <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>-<U+017F>ervice unto your Maje<U+017F>ty, as to di<U+017F>content your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in cau<U+017F>ing you to lo<U+017F>e the amity of your Allies. So as Sir, if you will plea<U+017F>e to
command me, I will undertake to divert him from it, and u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch pregnant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and rea<U+017F>ons, as <U+017F>hall <U+017F>o convince him, that he <U+017F>hall think no more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Childerick</hi> found <U+017F>uch a patient hearing from his Father, that he hoped pre<U+017F>ently
to obtain commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion for <U+017F>peaking unto <hi>Andrimartes.</hi> But that wi<U+017F>e King, having
long <U+017F>ince ob<U+017F>erved how this young Prince was in Love with <hi>Silviana;</hi> and knowing
that all the<U+017F>e in<U+017F>tances proceeded only from his de<U+017F>ires of enjoying her him<U+017F>elf, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him a full hearing, and <U+017F>eeing that he expected his an<U+017F>wer, he a<U+017F><U+017F>umed
a <U+017F>erious look, which te<U+017F>tified the <U+017F>mal <U+017F>atisfaction which he received for his long
Oration, and gave him this an<U+017F>wer.</p>
                     <p>I am very <U+017F>orry <hi>Childerick,</hi> to find in you <U+017F>uch humours as I lea<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in two things, which believe it my Son, will become your ruine, if they be
not prudently corrected. The fir<U+017F>t is an effeminate inclination, which does bebauch
you unto a di<U+017F><U+017F>olute kind of life, devoting your <U+017F>elf wholly unto plea<U+017F>ures and love:
for if from contraries, contrary effects may be expected: How can I imagine but
that when I <U+017F>hall leave you this Crown, which was gotten by <U+017F>o many hazards and
toyl from the valiant Romans, you will as <U+017F>oon lo<U+017F>e it as it was gotten? Alas you
do degenerate from the martial vertue of your Nation the <hi>Franks.</hi> The other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
which I do extreamly condemn you for, is; The imploying your wit to cover
your vice with a vail of virtue. Do you think me <hi>Childerick</hi> <U+017F>o little vers'd in the
affairs of the world, that I do not <U+017F>ee how all your <U+017F>pecious arguments are only to
hinder <hi>Silviana,</hi> whom you do love, from marrying? Do you think I have forgot
your Language which you u<U+017F>ed when <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was made a Knight? Can you
believe me ignorant of her throwing a Picture into the fire, which you had gotten
of hers, unknown unto her? Do you think I never heard how violently you ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed
her by force? Do not think <hi>Childerick</hi> that any of your actions towards her is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
unto me; and though hitherto I <U+017F>uffered them, and <U+017F>eemed to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
yet it was only in hopes that you would reclaim your <U+017F>elf from <U+017F>uch a manner
of life, as you could not chu<U+017F>e but know would exceedingly di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me. You take
upon you to be a very great States-man, and will needs teach me how much I am
obliged unto <hi>Semnon,</hi> hinting upon all the good offices he has done me: Pray
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53527:132"/>
                        <hi>Childerick,</hi> unto which of all my neighbours have you <U+017F>een me deficient, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in paying my duty unto their amity and good will? Why <U+017F>hould you think me
<U+017F>o negligent of him whom I love and e<U+017F>teem above all the <hi>Gaules?</hi> If you cannot
dive into the depth of my de<U+017F>igns, why <U+017F>hould you not think tho<U+017F>e things which pa<U+017F>s
your under<U+017F>tanding to be done with as much rea<U+017F>on, as tho<U+017F>e things are which be
within the compa<U+017F>s of your capacity? What have I done hitherto, which any of
my friends can upbraid me withall? Nay, can any of my enemies charge me with any
neglect of duty to them? And is <hi>Childerick</hi> the only one that can condemn the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Father? Good Son give me a rea<U+017F>on for your cen<U+017F>ure: Nay, I believe
you have no rea<U+017F>on; but becau<U+017F>e I con<U+017F>ent to the marriage of a Lady, which out of
a fond affection you would di<U+017F>honour: do you think it better and more honourable
for <hi>Semnon,</hi> our generous and ancient friend to marry his Daughter unto you, then
unto <hi>Andrimartes?</hi> But <hi>Childerick,</hi> do you de<U+017F>ire to marry her? Can your fooli<U+017F>h
humour hurry you unto <U+017F>uch a crime? I cannot believe it, and had rather you were
dead then ever <U+017F>ee the day; or that you <U+017F>hould entertain <U+017F>uch a thought: not but
that I do highly e<U+017F>teem the virtue of the Father, and like the Lady, for both are
very worthy of much honour: but I had rather re<U+017F>tore back unto <hi>Reynald</hi> or his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Aberick,</hi> the Crown of their Father <hi>Clodion,</hi> then con<U+017F>ent that <U+017F>uch a pu<U+017F>illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimious
courage as yours <U+017F>hould have the Soveraign Power over <U+017F>uch a war-like peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as this which I command. Now if your drift be not to marry <hi>Silviana,</hi> what
would you do with her? Would you make her your whore? Do you think the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of my hou<U+017F>e can brook it? Will the reputation of the Queen your Mother <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it? Or the courage and genero<U+017F>ity of <hi>Semnon</hi> endure it? Fie, fie, <hi>Childerick,</hi> <U+017F>tifle
<U+017F>uch leud thoughts, and abominate them: let not <U+017F>uch a fond love blind your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding;
and then you will plainly <U+017F>ee that if I do not con<U+017F>ent unto this marriage of
<hi>Silviana</hi> unto <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> I am infinitely to blame; for Princes as your <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ays,
are obliged to recompence <U+017F>ervices done, with benefits and honours: and if <U+017F>o, how
much am I obliged unto <hi>Andrimartes?</hi> Who, not to mention his other exploits
which he hath done for us, has not only repul<U+017F>ed the power of <hi>Clodions</hi> children,
but forced them to keep within the limits of <hi>Austra<U+017F>ia:</hi> he may be <U+017F>aid to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
all the re<U+017F>t of our Dominions, by his valour and wi<U+017F>e conduct, and repre<U+017F><U+017F>ing
the in<U+017F>olency of our enemies, has given us the means to make new conque<U+017F>ts. Now
tell me <hi>Childerick,</hi> how great is my obligation for <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ignal <U+017F>ervice? How ju<U+017F>tly
might I be branded with ingratitude, if I <U+017F>hould deny his affection, his fidelity, his
courage, and his merits, the fir<U+017F>t reque<U+017F>t that he <U+017F>hall make unto me? But you bid
me pay my debts with my own mony, and not with <hi>Semnons,</hi> who keeps this
Daughter for the <U+017F>upport and comfort of his old age. Let me tell you Son, that
if I <U+017F>hould deny unto his Grand-child <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>utable and advantageous marriage, it
would be a great prejudice and injury to her aged Father; for there is no Prince,
nor King, though never <U+017F>o great; but would be glad of his alliance, who is able
not only to pre<U+017F>erve a <U+017F>tate, but by his valour and prudence is able to get a hundred
Kingdoms: What greater advantage or comfort can <hi>Semnon</hi> have in his old age,
then to <U+017F>ee <hi>Silviana</hi> his Daughter in the hands of <U+017F>o brave and virtuous a Cavalier,
and his State under the guard of <U+017F>uch a valiant, prudent, and pro<U+017F>perous Captain as
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> is? Con<U+017F>ider <hi>Childerick,</hi> that I do ow this gratification unto <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi>
for his Excellent <U+017F>ervices which he hath done; and I do ow it al<U+017F>o unto
<hi>Semnon,</hi> for the friend<U+017F>hip and fidelity which I have always found from him. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you your <U+017F>elf will acknowledg as much, and if you contradict me, it is not
<hi>Childerick</hi> which does it, but a fooli<U+017F>h effeminate pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which will ruine him, and
which if he do not pre<U+017F>ently correct, will make him lo<U+017F>e that Crown which now I
wear. If therefore you have any de<U+017F>ire to plea<U+017F>e me, leave off this drow<U+017F>ie kind of
life, which will render you the <U+017F>corn and odium of all that know you, e<U+017F>pecially of
the <hi>Franks,</hi> who<U+017F>e martial di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions will never love nor endure <U+017F>uch an effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
per<U+017F>on to be their King. Al<U+017F>o <hi>Childerick,</hi> I would have you leave off all your
tricks of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, with which you would cloak your effeminate de<U+017F>igns with a
vizard of virtue: otherwi<U+017F>e, let me tell you Son, that though I am your Father by
name, yet I am not in affection, but will make it appear both unto you and all the
world, that I do not con<U+017F>ent unto <U+017F>uch a contemptible life, as you do live.</p>

                        <hi>Childerick</hi> was extreamly confounded at this an<U+017F>wer which <hi>Merovius</hi> gave him,
for his own con<U+017F>cience did convince him; yet according to the common cu<U+017F>tom of
of all <U+017F>uch as would put a glo<U+017F>s upon their faults, he offered to excu<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf of part
of tho<U+017F>e things wherewith his Father upbraided him, by denying the one ab<U+017F>olutely,
and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ing the other, that perhaps he had made his cau<U+017F>e good, if he had had
to do with one le<U+017F>s Judicious then <hi>Merovius.</hi> But the wi<U+017F>e Father after he had
heard all his gilded excu<U+017F>es, at la<U+017F>t he interrupted him. I perceive <hi>Childerick</hi> (<U+017F>aid
he unto him) that you are very <U+017F>orry I have been <U+017F>o quick <U+017F>ighted as to <U+017F>ee your
faults: but you ought not to grieve for that; repent rather the committing them,
then my <U+017F>eeing them: for being your Father, I <U+017F>hall be as careful to conceal them
as your <U+017F>elf; but if you be wi<U+017F>e, continue no longer in this cour<U+017F>e of life, which
will mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>hamefully become your ruine: and con<U+017F>ider that a Prince who is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
a people, ought to render him<U+017F>elf more wi<U+017F>e, and more virtuous, then the
people, which are to obey him; for otherwi<U+017F>e his government will be only by Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which is le<U+017F>s <U+017F>afe unto him, and more di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing unto them.</p>
                     <p>Upon this <hi>Merovius</hi> would hearken unto no reply, but leaving him, he di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
a me<U+017F><U+017F>enger pre<U+017F>ently unto the Queen <hi>Methina,</hi> which let her under<U+017F>tand,
that without more delay, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould propound this marriage unto <hi>Semnon</hi> Duke of
<hi>Gaul Armorique,</hi> and to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him, that he would rai<U+017F>e <hi>Andrimartes</hi> unto <U+017F>uch
a degree, as he <U+017F>hould have no cau<U+017F>e to repent the be<U+017F>towing his Grand-child upon
<U+017F>uch a brave Cavalier. The Queen who was as desirous to give <hi>Andrimartes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
as the King, <U+017F>he di<U+017F>patched an Amba<U+017F><U+017F>ador immediately unto <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
who<U+017F>e con<U+017F>ent was ea<U+017F>ily obtained; and who having heard <U+017F>o great a Fame
upon the Name of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> did embrace the motion, with many thanks unto
the Queen, for her de<U+017F>ires of <U+017F>uch a Match for <hi>Silviana:</hi> thinking him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
both unto her and <hi>Merovius</hi> for it, as he thought him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<U+017F>ed
for all the <U+017F>ervices he had ever done them, and be<U+017F>eeched them to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of
him and his Grand-child as they plea<U+017F>ed. Only this he de<U+017F>ired, that he might <U+017F>ee
<hi>Andrimartes,</hi> to the end he might be better acquainted with him, who was to enjoy
<hi>Silviana</hi> and his e<U+017F>tate.</p>
                     <p>This an<U+017F>wer being received, the Queen did pre<U+017F>ently acquaint her Husband with
it, who thought it expedient for <hi>Andrimartes</hi> to make this journey unto the good
Duke; and the rather, becau<U+017F>e at that time he had either Peace or Truce with all his
Neighbours, and could be<U+017F>t <U+017F>pare him. <hi>Andrimartes</hi> and <hi>Silviana,</hi> hearing of this
intended <U+017F>eparation, though they knew it conduced much unto their future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,
yet their extream affections unto each other, could not con<U+017F>ent unto it
without abundance of grief; for whil<U+017F>t he was in the Army, <U+017F>he heard from him
every day: but now the journey was long, and they fore<U+017F>aw that the good Duke
<hi>Semnon</hi> would not <U+017F>uffer him to return <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as they de<U+017F>ired: yet nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>training
them, <hi>Andrimartes</hi> departed, more de<U+017F>irous to return, then to be the po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or
of <hi>Gaul Armorique.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I <U+017F>hall not Madam, here relate the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of his reception both by <hi>Semnon</hi> and
his people, who under<U+017F>tanding the intentions of their Lord, did make preparations
to receive him with all manner of honour and joy; infinitely applauding the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their good Duke: Let it <U+017F>uffice to tell you, that after <hi>Semnon</hi> had welcomed
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> with all manner of magnificence, and kept him a while in his Court,
he did not only grant <hi>Silviana</hi> unto him, as he de<U+017F>ired; but al<U+017F>o proclaimed him
his Succe<U+017F><U+017F>or in <hi>Gaul Armorique,</hi> and cau<U+017F>ed all his va<U+017F><U+017F>als and <U+017F>ubjects to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
him <U+017F>o: <U+017F>o as all the Grandees, all the Souldiers, and all the Knights, received
him as their <U+017F>ucceeding Lord with great applau<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>Pre<U+017F>ently after this or a little before, <hi>Clidemant</hi> was come into the Army of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovius,</hi>
and <U+017F>aw <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> being a witne<U+017F>s of his brave exploits: So as when this
news was divulged in the Court of <hi>Merovius,</hi> it was very welcom unto all the brave
Cavaliers, <hi>Childerick</hi> only excepted, who was much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed at it: for though
he made a <U+017F>hew of the contrary, and <U+017F>ince his Father had chid him, was not <U+017F>o
bold as to let his love unto <hi>Silviana</hi> appear, yet in lieu of dimini<U+017F>hing, it encrea<U+017F>ed
every day: not that he had any intention to marry her, for he aymed at <U+017F>omething
higher; but his de<U+017F>ign was to enjoy her in another quality. When he heard any
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53527:133"/>
commend the choi<U+017F>e which <hi>Semnon</hi> had made for his Grand-child, he could not
forbear <U+017F>peaking very di<U+017F>-advantageou<U+017F>ly of it, and charge him, <U+017F>ometimes with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<U+017F>tice,
and <U+017F>ometimes with indi<U+017F>cretion: of inju<U+017F>tice, in depriving his right Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ors
from his E<U+017F>tate; and of indi<U+017F>cretion in <U+017F>ubmitting <hi>Gaul Armorique</hi> unto a
<hi>Frank</hi> who was a <U+017F>tranger. So as not being able to quench his flaming pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
an opportunity of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <hi>Silviana,</hi> he <U+017F>aid thus unto her: Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,
Fair Lady, you <U+017F>hould ever think of marrying <hi>Andrimartes?</hi> Sir, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, is
he not a Cavalier of greater merit then I can de<U+017F>erve? It <U+017F>eems, replied he, that you
are ignorant in matter of merit, <U+017F>ince you do not <U+017F>ee that the lea<U+017F>t of your perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
does infinitely tran<U+017F>cend all that is in <hi>Andrimartes.</hi> Sir, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he and <U+017F>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
If I be of <U+017F>uch worth as you <U+017F>eem to make me, I <U+017F>hall quickly make him rich;
for I will wholly be<U+017F>tow my<U+017F>elf upon him: and for my part, I <U+017F>hall think my <U+017F>elf
<U+017F>ufficiently payed if he do but love me, and unto that I <U+017F>hall hope to oblige him, by
the extream affection which I do bear unto him. This <U+017F>peaks your judgment to be
wonderous weak, <U+017F>aid <hi>Childerick,</hi> and that your will tran<U+017F>ports you beyond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
Sir, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, if you think to vex me by <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, you are
to blame, <U+017F>ince my will was alwayes to honour you. And if it be to cro<U+017F>s <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi>
I <U+017F>hall wonder, <U+017F>ince the only ambition of that poor Cavalier, is to imploy
his life for the propagation of your Crown. Fair one, an<U+017F>wered the young Prince,
my de<U+017F>ign is neither to vexe you, nor cro<U+017F>s him; but only to prevent your ruine,
which I fore<U+017F>ee will be if you do not retire your <U+017F>elf from this young and indi<U+017F>creet
affection: believe it, I do not <U+017F>peak without rea<U+017F>on, and did you con<U+017F>ider what
good fortune is offered you, perhaps you would not thus precipitate your <U+017F>elf: Sir,
replied <hi>Silviana,</hi> <U+017F>et your heart at re<U+017F>t, and believe this for a mo<U+017F>t certain truth,
that all the great advantages in the world, <U+017F>hall never divert my affection unto <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimartes:</hi>
The Queen and the King allow of it, <hi>Semnon</hi> approves of it al<U+017F>o, and
what then can make me backward? Why good <hi>Silviana,</hi> replied <hi>Childerick,</hi> do
you make no reckoning of my will? And do you not think that my con<U+017F>ent is al<U+017F>o ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary?
Certainly I do Sir, (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) but I cannot think you will ever cro<U+017F>s
the will of <hi>Merovius.</hi> The Love which I do bear unto you is <U+017F>uch, (<U+017F>aid he) that
if I <U+017F>aw it would be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for your good, I would cro<U+017F>s even <hi>Tautates</hi> him<U+017F>elf.
But <U+017F>ince you care <U+017F>o little for your own good, adieu; and remember that I am
<hi>Childerick,</hi> a Kings Son, and one who hereafter will let you <U+017F>ee what a fool you are to
de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e that good will which he offers unto you. Upon this, not <U+017F>taying for her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer,
he went away in an angry mood: At which <U+017F>he was very <U+017F>orry, not in any
con<U+017F>ideration of her <U+017F>elf, but out of fear le<U+017F>t his anger <U+017F>hould reflect upon her dear
<hi>Andrimartes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Semnon</hi> having kept <hi>Andrimartes</hi> a long while with him, and
thinking it now time for him to return unto <hi>Merovius,</hi> he di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed him, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that as <U+017F>oon as he was married he <U+017F>hould return and bring <hi>Silviana</hi> with him,
with a re<U+017F>olution of <U+017F>taying alwayes, and taking upon him the care of his E<U+017F>tate, and
<U+017F>pending the re<U+017F>t of his dayes in re<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>At his return every one received him with all imaginable honour, and care<U+017F><U+017F>es.
<hi>Merovius</hi> who treated him already as Duke of <hi>Gaul Armorique,</hi> was very glad that
one of his own nation, and one over whom he had <U+017F>o much influence, <U+017F>hould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<U+017F>o great a People, and become his Neighbour; thinking it to be a great <U+017F>ecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
unto his Crown: and in this con<U+017F>ideration he commanded <hi>Childerick</hi> to make
much of him, and to love him, not as his Va<U+017F><U+017F>al, but as his Neighbour, and one
who might give a great <U+017F>ettlement unto his conque<U+017F>ts. But all the<U+017F>e care<U+017F><U+017F>es were
nothing unto <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> in compari<U+017F>on of that welcom which he received from
his deare<U+017F>t <hi>Silviana,</hi> who now took him for her Husband, and lived in all hone<U+017F>t
liberty with him; and though <U+017F>he did not conceal any of her actions or thoughts
from him, yet <U+017F>he would not acquaint him with the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Childerick,</hi> as well
becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he knew that all he <U+017F>aid was fal<U+017F>e, as becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he thought that it would
much di<U+017F>content him: But <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to retire her <U+017F>elf with him as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<U+017F>he could, into the dominions of <hi>Semnon;</hi> and <U+017F>o avoid that Tiranny and tho<U+017F>e
in<U+017F>olencies, which <U+017F>he expected from him when he <U+017F>hould be ab<U+017F>olute Lord of the
<hi>Franks.</hi>

There being no <U+017F>top in the accompli<U+017F>hment of this <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ired marriage, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thina</hi>
by the Kings authority, and by con<U+017F>ent of <hi>Semnon,</hi> cau<U+017F>ed the articles of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to be drawn; and about eight dayes after, the ceremonies were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>hed,
to the contentment of all, and with <U+017F>o much joy and <U+017F>atisfaction unto <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viana</hi>
and <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that never two Lovers were better contented. <hi>Childerick</hi>
only <U+017F>ighed whil<U+017F>t all other rejoyced.</p>
                     <p>But as if Heaven <U+017F>tayed only until this marriage was pa<U+017F>t, before all <hi>Gaul</hi> <U+017F>hould
become all <U+017F>orrows, within <U+017F>even or eight dayes after, <hi>Merovius</hi> fell <U+017F>ick, and
pre<U+017F>ently after dyed, full of glory and honour, and infinitely bewailed by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Childerick</hi> was pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>et upon the Throne, and proclaimed King of the
<hi>Franks,</hi> in fal<U+017F>e hopes that he would be the Imitator of his Fathers virtues. <hi>Silviana</hi>
remembring the har<U+017F>h language which <U+017F>he had received from him, advi<U+017F>ed her dear
Husband to get out of the reach of this young King, and to retire into <hi>Gaul Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
as well to avoid the malignity of <hi>Childerick,</hi> as to keep his promi<U+017F>e with
<hi>Semnon.</hi> But <hi>Andrimartes</hi> who was ignorant of the la<U+017F>t language which he had
u<U+017F>ed unto <hi>Silviana,</hi> and who thought him<U+017F>elf obliged to <U+017F>tay a while with this new
King, and <U+017F>ee the Crown <U+017F>etled upon his head, he would not hearken unto the
coun<U+017F>el of <hi>Silviana,</hi> thinking it again<U+017F>t his duty to retire before all was <U+017F>etled, and
<U+017F>o delayed the time under pretence of furni<U+017F>hing him<U+017F>elf with all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for
their journey: in the mean time he was alwayes with the King, and <U+017F>o full of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and care in all his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as any other but <hi>Childerick</hi> would have thought
him<U+017F>elf obliged: But he on the contrary remembring the injuries which he thought
he had received, deferred the re<U+017F>olution of his <U+017F>oul only till the Ceremonies of his
Coronation were pa<U+017F>t: In the mean time news was brought unto the Valiant <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes</hi>
and <hi>Silviana,</hi> that the good Duke <hi>Semnon</hi> was dead, and that all his <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
earne<U+017F>tly de<U+017F>ired them to come into their dominions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvianas</hi> grief was very great, and that of <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was no le<U+017F>s; for
having received <U+017F>o many benefits from that Prince, it grieved him extreamly,
that he <U+017F>hould die before he had done him any <U+017F>ervice. But when their fir<U+017F>t tears
were almo<U+017F>t dryed up, Heaven gave them cau<U+017F>e for new ones, and more bitter then
the fir<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Childerick</hi> now thinks all well enough, and his Crown fa<U+017F>t upon his head; and
he fell into <U+017F>uch a licentious cour<U+017F>e of life, as every one was out of hopes to find
his Fathers virtues in him. The People complained, the Grandees grumbled, and
his be<U+017F>t lovers lamented him. After they had a while endured his <U+017F>hameful kind of
life, and <U+017F>uffered many Pre<U+017F><U+017F>ures and Tyrannies obtruded upon the people, the
Grandees of the State a<U+017F><U+017F>embled them<U+017F>elves together at <hi>Province,</hi> and afterwards
at <hi>Beauvois;</hi> where after deep debate and <U+017F>erious con<U+017F>ideration, they re<U+017F>olved to
declare him unworthy and incapable of the Crown of <hi>Franks;</hi> and at the <U+017F>ame time
to make choi<U+017F>e of one, who though a Roman, yet they thought to be a per<U+017F>on of
great merit and worthy to be their King: his name was <hi>Gillon,</hi> who had long <U+017F>ince
left the Roman Empire, and followed <hi>Merovius,</hi> unto whom he had done very
great and faithful <U+017F>ervice, and had added unto the State of the <hi>Franks</hi> the Town of
<hi>Sai<U+017F><U+017F>ons,</hi> of which he was the Governor. But for my part, I believe, they made
choi<U+017F>e of this ambitious man, becau<U+017F>e there was not any <hi>Frank</hi> that would take the
Title and charge upon him, and maintain it again<U+017F>t their natural and legal King:
For trea<U+017F>on was a mo<U+017F>t dete<U+017F>table <U+017F>in among<U+017F>t them, and abhorred by all. But you
may <U+017F>ee Madam, how when the great <hi>Tautates</hi> has a mind to cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e men for their

and arming him<U+017F>elf, and all the Grandees confederating and plotting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Childerick</hi> drowned in a dull <U+017F>ecurity, was mo<U+017F>t indi<U+017F>creetly contriving how
he <U+017F>hould get <hi>Silviana</hi> by force from <hi>Andrimartes;</hi> not by any de<U+017F>ign of marrying
her, for that he could not do, <U+017F>he being married already, but to u<U+017F>e her at his
plea<U+017F>ure, as he had done <U+017F>ome others, <U+017F>ince the death of <hi>Merovius:</hi> This young
Prince was much induced unto the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>orders, by the poi<U+017F>onous advi<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome ba<U+017F>e
Flatterers about him, who cryed up, that all things were Lawful unto a King; that
Kings made Laws for their Subjects, not to tye up their own hands; and that <U+017F>ince
the lives of his Va<U+017F><U+017F>als were in his power, he might do what he would with their

e<U+017F>tates or any thing of theirs: The<U+017F>e flattering but fal<U+017F>e maximes, moved him to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
this injury unto <hi>Silviana,</hi> and the Valiant <hi>Andrimartes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Queen <hi>Methina</hi> retired her <U+017F>elf to <hi>Remois,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not be any
witne<U+017F>s unto the di<U+017F>honourable and debauched actions of <hi>Childerick,</hi> and becau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to comfort her <U+017F>elf after her great lo<U+017F>s, by the con<U+017F>olations of one <hi>Remy,</hi>
a per<U+017F>on who <U+017F>hined in all virtue, and one, who though the God whom he adored
was unknown unto the <hi>Franks</hi> and us, yet never any afflicted per<U+017F>on parted from
him without much comfort. <hi>Childerick,</hi> taking the opportunity of his Mothers
ab<U+017F>ence, he de<U+017F>ired no more but to make <hi>Andrimartes</hi> leave <hi>Silviana</hi> by her <U+017F>elf;
in order to which he took him a<U+017F>ide, and told him that he had matters of very great
importance to imploy him in, and <U+017F>uch as he would not commit unto the fidelity of
any one but him<U+017F>elf: he told him that the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>o neerly concerned his Crown,
and required <U+017F>uch extream ha<U+017F>te, that he hoped he would not deny him, but prepare
him<U+017F>elf for a <U+017F>udden departure. <hi>Andrimartes</hi> who did not think the Son of <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
<U+017F>hould ever entertain any <U+017F>uch damnable thoughts, did freely an<U+017F>wer him, that
he was ready to <U+017F>erve him in this occa<U+017F>ion or any other; and that though he loved
<hi>Silviana</hi> as his wife, yet he loved <hi>Childerick</hi> as his Soveraign: and to <U+017F>hew that
the<U+017F>e two affections were not incompatible, he would te<U+017F>tifie that he held nothing
more dear unto him then his <U+017F>ervice. Upon this <hi>Childerick</hi> gave him <U+017F>ome coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in<U+017F>tructions, and gave him no longer time to prepare him<U+017F>elf for his journey
then that night, and therefore <hi>Andrimartes</hi> acquainted his dear <hi>Silviana</hi> with his
imployment, and told her that he hoped to return within five or <U+017F>ix dayes at the
furthe<U+017F>t. The wi<U+017F>e <hi>Silviana</hi> gave a patient hearing unto what <hi>Andrimartes</hi> told her,
and having a quick and apprehen<U+017F>ive wit, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered him with a deep <U+017F>igh, thus:
This journey, I am afraid, will not bring me any contentment, and I be<U+017F>eech Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
I be deceived in my thoughts: <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> you may remember that <hi>Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
did once love me, or at the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o whil<U+017F>t his Father lived; and he has
u<U+017F>ed very <U+017F>trange expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions unto me, <U+017F>uch as I never did impart un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o you, but
<U+017F>uch as make it manife<U+017F>t that he <U+017F>lights all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervices which you have done for him
and <hi>Merovius;</hi> and having all the power in his own hands, Heavens know how far
he will extend it: you <U+017F>ee what kind of life he lives, and how apt he is to be hurried
unto any violent act; and therefore, what good can we ever hope for from him?
for my part I am extreamly afraid of the man; and he has two qualities which may
well make any to fear him; that is, a wicked will, and ab<U+017F>olute power: what imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
can he have for you that are good? Why <U+017F>hould he be <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty in packing you
away? I be<U+017F>eech Heaven, it be with a good de<U+017F>ign: upon this, <U+017F>he took him about
the neck, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed him, but bathed her ki<U+017F><U+017F>es in a flood of tears, which did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
move the heart of this Generous Cavalier unto compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: then <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly
thinking upon the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Silviana,</hi> and finding much rea<U+017F>on in it, he an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her thus: The<U+017F>e teares, my deare<U+017F>t, do infinitely <U+017F>well my <U+017F>oul with <U+017F>orrows;
and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, I find all your words <U+017F>o full of rea<U+017F>on, that I wi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ome other
were imployed in my room: but <U+017F>ince I have already taken it upon me, and have
his in<U+017F>tructions in my keeping, what excu<U+017F>e can I make to come off withal? And
how can I be quit of my imployment without an extream di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing him? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be: but <U+017F>ince I have gone thus far, I mu<U+017F>t go further, and do as well
as we can; and therefore, I will tell you what I think we ought to do: Fir<U+017F>t, I mu<U+017F>t
go, and return with all the ha<U+017F>te that po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I can make; in the mean time, go you
unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Andrenick</hi> our old and tru<U+017F>ty <U+017F>ervant, yet unknown unto any:
If <hi>Childerick</hi> have any bad de<U+017F>ign, doubtle<U+017F>s he will either come unto you, or <U+017F>end
for you; by this his intentions will be known unto us: if they prove good, I <U+017F>hall
be very glad that no more noi<U+017F>e is made of our jealou<U+017F>ies of him: and if they be
bad, I <U+017F>hall give him but a very <U+017F>mal time to execute his de<U+017F>ign; for he <U+017F>hall not
live a day after my return: becau<U+017F>e I will give his wicked <U+017F>oul a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age out of his
body in the mid<U+017F>t of all his guards and <U+017F>ouldiers: but being yet in doubt of it, I

                     <p>This was the re<U+017F>olution of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> who <U+017F>etting forward in the morning very
early, acquainted the tru<U+017F>ty <hi>Andrenick</hi> with his purpo<U+017F>e concerning <hi>Silviana;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53527:135"/>
him to keep it <U+017F>ecret from all the world. This <hi>Andrenick</hi> was an old <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
who had the government of him in his youth, who<U+017F>e affection was <U+017F>o great,
and his fidelity <U+017F>o well known, as <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was as <U+017F>ure of him as of him<U+017F>elf.
His hou<U+017F>e was neer the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> and he took it, becau<U+017F>e he thought
that ere long his Ma<U+017F>ter would go into <hi>Gaul Armorique,</hi> and he having a wife and
children could not go with him.</p>
                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Andrimartes</hi> was gone, <hi>Silviana</hi> without acquainting any of her
maids, went unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Andrenick;</hi> and commanded them, that if any Ladies
came to vi<U+017F>it her, to <U+017F>ay that <U+017F>he was not well, and de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee no body. <hi>Silviana</hi>
in the interim, locked her <U+017F>elf up with the wife of <hi>Andrenick,</hi> trembling at every
noi<U+017F>e which <U+017F>he heard, and thinking that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <hi>Childerick</hi> at her Chamber door.
It is very <U+017F>trange to ob<U+017F>erve, what a blind knowledg we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ometimes have of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
that are to happen. <hi>Silviana</hi> indeed had rea<U+017F>on to fear the exorbitant in<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of <hi>Childerick;</hi> but yet <U+017F>ince the death of <hi>Merovius,</hi> <U+017F>he needed not have
any <U+017F>uch deep apprehen<U+017F>ions, <U+017F>ince his in<U+017F>olencies fell upon <U+017F>ome others; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>he
might well imagine his thoughts to be diverted from her, and carried another way:
but I cannot tell, <U+017F>ome good Genius told her, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould never <U+017F>ee her Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
again, and that <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>-fortune would befal both him and her: this was the
rea<U+017F>on of her fears, and <U+017F>tudy to prevent all manner of di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he
had a great confidence in the wife of <hi>Andrenick,</hi> <U+017F>he acquainted her with her fears,
and they two plotted together what cour<U+017F>e was be<U+017F>t to be taken. <hi>Silviana</hi> asked
her what they <U+017F>hould do, if <hi>Childerick</hi> not finding her at her own hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>hould
look for her there. Fir<U+017F>t of all they <U+017F>ought out for <U+017F>ome private place where <U+017F>he
might hide her <U+017F>elf; for it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the power and force of the King:
but finding the hou<U+017F>e to be very little, and very inconvenient for <U+017F>uch a purpo<U+017F>e,
there being no places of privacy in it, <U+017F>he began to think upon having recour<U+017F>e unto
death as her ultimate refuge: but the good woman loving her very well, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Andrimartes</hi> would never <U+017F>urvive her: No, no Madam, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) never
think upon any dying; but if you will follow my directions, I will <U+017F>ecure you from
all manner of violence. You are young, and tall, you have a good leg, and no big
bre<U+017F>ts; I would advi<U+017F>e you to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elf in the habit of a Cavalier: I have here a
<U+017F>uit of Clothes which is newly made for one of my Sons, he never wore them, and
therefore none can know them; and I am confident that none who <U+017F>ees you with a
Sword by your <U+017F>ide, and a Feather in your hat, will ever take you for <hi>Silviana;</hi>
as for your hair, what if you did cut it, though not till we <U+017F>ee an ab<U+017F>olute nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of
it? in the mean time therefore, whil<U+017F>t we have lei<U+017F>ure let us put you into this trim, for
however, there is no harm in it, whether you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>tand in need of it or no. Oh
Mother (cryed out <hi>Silviana</hi>) ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed for ever may <U+017F>he be that bore you; for now
by your prudence I <U+017F>hall hope to pre<U+017F>erve my <U+017F>elf for my deare<U+017F>t <hi>Andrimartes:</hi>
there is no better way under Heaven then this; dear Mother, let us make all the ha<U+017F>t
we can; for my heart tels me, that we <U+017F>hall be pre<U+017F>ently put unto all our <U+017F>hifts:
and as for my hair, let the Sci<U+017F><U+017F>ers be in readine<U+017F><U+017F>e, for I will not make any <U+017F>cruple
of it.</p>
                     <p>Upon this the virtuous <hi>Silviana</hi> began to undre<U+017F>s her <U+017F>elf, while<U+017F>t the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
went to fetch the Suit of Clothes which <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke of; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired
to do her all the <U+017F>ervice <U+017F>he was able, <U+017F>he returned again immediately, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hut the
door fa<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he helped to trick up <hi>Silviana,</hi> who appeared to be the brave<U+017F>t Cavalier
in all the Court, and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed her, that the good woman verily believed <U+017F>he
would pa<U+017F>s unknown by any: the <U+017F>uit did fit her <U+017F>o well, and became her, that
when <U+017F>he girded the Sword about her, now, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, do I create you a Cavalier,
and under that name oblige you to defend the honour of Ladies. Mother, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Silviana,</hi> this Sword will defend the honour of one Lady at the lea<U+017F>t, and having
it by my <U+017F>ide, I fear not the violence of <hi>Childerick,</hi> but will make u<U+017F>e of it again<U+017F>t
him, or if he prove too <U+017F>trong for me, again<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf, who as feeble as I am, have
courage enough to pa<U+017F>s into another world without any <U+017F>tain unto my honour: but
Mother, me thinks I want Boots and Spurs: for if this Tyrant do come hither, it
is not likely I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay here; and if I go away, to be in this habit and on foot, is
not hand<U+017F>om, but will rather render me more <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitious: <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53527:135"/>
(<U+017F>aid the good woman) I do not fear your <U+017F>afety; as good luck is, there
are two hor<U+017F>es in the hou<U+017F>e, which I have heard <hi>Andrenick</hi> <U+017F>ay, are very gentle and
fair conditioned; I will accompany you, and before I di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them to be made ready: the Footman of <hi>Andrimartes</hi> <U+017F>hall hold them, and if
we <U+017F>tand in need of them, we will then mount them.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t the good woman went down to take order about the<U+017F>e Hor<U+017F>es, and Boots,
and Spurs, <hi>Silviana</hi> <U+017F>tayed alone in the Chamber, <U+017F>o glad of her di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e, that <U+017F>he
knew not how to be thankful enough unto Heaven for this happy occa<U+017F>ion of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the de<U+017F>ignes of <hi>Childerick:</hi> for remembring his la<U+017F>t language unto her, <U+017F>he
verily believed that he had <U+017F>ent <hi>Andrimartes</hi> away, only to have more opportunity of
offering <U+017F>ome violence unto her; this memory filled her full of chill fears: I know,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he in her <U+017F>elf, that the Tyrant intends violence unto me, and becau<U+017F>e he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the courage of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> has packed him away with a de<U+017F>ign of getting him
to be killed at his return. As <U+017F>he was in the<U+017F>e thoughts, the wife of <hi>Andrenick</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto her, to whom with a trembling voice and tears in her eyes, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus;
Oh Mother! I am but a dead woman unle<U+017F>s you help me; for this wicked man,
knows very well that the courage of <hi>Andrimartes</hi> will never endure the injury which
he thinks to do unto me, without revenge, and therefore for certain, he will cau<U+017F>e
him to be murdered at his return, if we do not <U+017F>ome way or other prevent it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
(an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) let me dre<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf as <U+017F>oon as I can, that I may follow you;
for me thinks I hear <U+017F>ome noi<U+017F>e in the <U+017F>treets: what you <U+017F>ay Madam is not without
<U+017F>ome probability, for a Tyrant never acts his villany by halfs: She had no <U+017F>ooner
dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf, but a me<U+017F><U+017F>enger brought them word that the King had been at the
hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that he <U+017F>ought for <hi>Silviana,</hi> and menaced <hi>Andrenick,</hi> and
the re<U+017F>t of the Dome<U+017F>tiques, to know where <U+017F>he was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silviana</hi> now did cut her hair, and the hair of <hi>Andrenicks</hi> wife, and then went
all three to the hor<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>o opportunely, that they were no <U+017F>ooner out of the hou<U+017F>e,
but <hi>Childerick</hi> with all his guard entred in at another door; making <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e,
that the poor Ladies trembled out of fear of falling into their hands: but the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who had been in <U+017F>everal dangers with his Ma<U+017F>ter in the wars, he was not at all
affrighted: follow me, <U+017F>aid he, and fear not, for I <U+017F>wear by the life of my Ma<U+017F>ter,
that I will kill him who <U+017F>hall offer any injury unto his wife. Thus ha<U+017F>ting them away,
becau<U+017F>e the noi<U+017F>e encrea<U+017F>ed, he got them over the bridg; and mending their pace,
he carried them towards the Mount of <hi>Mars,</hi> and in a clo<U+017F>e valley under the
Mountain, they did hide them<U+017F>elves, intending when it was night to go unto <U+017F>ome
Town, a little farther off. But the wife of <hi>Andrenick,</hi> who was in great fear of
her Husband, and <hi>Silviana</hi> being very de<U+017F>irous to know what <hi>Childerick</hi> did when
he found her not; they commanded him to go into the Town, and hear what news:
the Footman went, &amp; as luck was, came into the Town ju<U+017F>t as they were ready to <U+017F>hut
up the gates, leaving the<U+017F>e two Ladies <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed to <U+017F>ee them<U+017F>elves in <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
place <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, as they could not chu<U+017F>e but be in great perplexity. But <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianas</hi>
great affection unto <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> when <U+017F>he con<U+017F>idered the danger he was in
at his return, made her de<U+017F>ire to be going towards him; and certainly had <U+017F>he
known the way, <U+017F>he would not have <U+017F>tayed for the return of the Footman: but advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
with the good woman upon the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e, it was judged dangerous to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without a guide; and therefore, comforting them<U+017F>elves as well as they could,
they <U+017F>tayed until Heaven <U+017F>hewed them a better cour<U+017F>e. Expecting therefore the
return of the Footman with much impatience, and time beginning to <U+017F>eem very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
unto them, at the la<U+017F>t they <U+017F>pied him coming, and running as fa<U+017F>t as he could;
and becau<U+017F>e they perceived that none could <U+017F>ee them, they went to meet him, being
extreamly de<U+017F>irous to know what news he brought.</p>
                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as he came unto them, he wanted breath to <U+017F>peak; Madam, <U+017F>aid he, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Silviana,</hi> the Heavens have helped you beyond all expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions; and you could
never have taken a better cour<U+017F>e, then thus di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ing your <U+017F>elf and getting away:
for Madam, that ungrateful <hi>Childerick</hi> (for he de<U+017F>erves not the name of a King)
that wicked man, that Tyrant, has committed more <U+017F>trange in<U+017F>olencies and violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in your hou<U+017F>e, and in the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Andrenick,</hi> then any Barbarian would ever
have offered in the <U+017F>acking and plundering of an enemies Town: Oh Friend, (<U+017F>aid
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53527:136"/>
                        <hi>Silviana</hi>) prethee tell us the whole <U+017F>tory of his actions, Madam, (<U+017F>aid the wife of
<hi>Andrenick</hi> and interrupted her) fir<U+017F>t let him tell me how my husband does. Your
Husband (an<U+017F>wered the man) is well, and was joyed beyond all mea<U+017F>ure when I
told him what cour<U+017F>e you had taken; but becau<U+017F>e this place is too neer the Town, I
think it be<U+017F>t Madam to get us further from it, and by the way I will make a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
unto you. Good Friend (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silviana</hi>) conduct us towards the place where
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> is, for I am re<U+017F>olved to go unto him, and tell him my <U+017F>elf what has
hapned.</p>
                     <p>The man then directed them the way which his Ma<U+017F>ter told him he would come
when he returned; and becau<U+017F>e it grew late, and <hi>Silviana</hi> was not u<U+017F>ed to travel
in that manner, they re<U+017F>olved to go no further that night then <hi>Clay:</hi> the man
therefore placed him<U+017F>elf betwixt them, and began to <U+017F>peak thus unto his Mi<U+017F>tris by
the way.</p>
                     <p>Madam, <U+017F>aid he unto her, Though it is but a while <U+017F>ince you left your hou<U+017F>e, yet
<U+017F>uch and <U+017F>o many <U+017F>trange accidents have <U+017F>ince hapned, that I know not where I
<U+017F>hould fir<U+017F>t begin the relation of them. Happy you are that <hi>Tautares</hi> in<U+017F>pired you
with <U+017F>uch feares of <hi>Childerick;</hi> and it is no le<U+017F>s then a miracle that you have e<U+017F>caped
his inhumane hands: for he came unto your hou<U+017F>e in a more in<U+017F>olent manner then
ever was heard of. Be plea<U+017F>ed to know Madam, that when I came to the gates of
the Town, I wondred to find them half <U+017F>hut, <U+017F>o as had I <U+017F>tayed but a minute lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
I could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly have entred: all the Town was up in Arms; and in <U+017F>uch a
tumult, that every <U+017F>treet was chained, and all doors <U+017F>hut. With much ado I got
unto your hou<U+017F>e, which I found full of people and <U+017F>ouldiers ready to fall together
by the ears; in the mean time, I heard many cryes and much lamentation made,
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>aid that <hi>Silviana</hi> was there, that <hi>Childerick</hi> would ravi<U+017F>h her; and to have a
better opportunity for it, had <U+017F>ent away <hi>Andrimartes</hi> unto the good Queen <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thina:</hi>
many did grumble at it, and <U+017F>aid, it was a <U+017F>hame for the people of <hi>Paris</hi> to
<U+017F>uffer <U+017F>uch a piece of violence before their faces: that if they endured this, they
<U+017F>hould encourage a Tyrant to commit the like actions; that now, neither their
Wives, nor their Daughters, were in <U+017F>afety, <U+017F>ince all was at the will of a luxurious
Prince, and that they had much better die once, then live alwayes in <U+017F>uch igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
and <U+017F>lavery. I ob<U+017F>erved that among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e who u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch plain language,
there was both <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Franks:</hi> and I perceived that a very little <U+017F>purring on,
would move them unto Arms. To the <hi>Franks</hi> therefore I <U+017F>aid thus; Oh Sirs, can
you endure to <U+017F>ee <hi>Andrimartes</hi> thus unworthily u<U+017F>ed before your faces? And unto
the <hi>Gaules</hi> I <U+017F>aid; Oh Friends, mu<U+017F>t the virtuous Daughter of the good Duke <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
be thus ravi<U+017F>hed in your Town, and find no relief among<U+017F>t you? There needed
no more to <U+017F>et them together by the ears, and with <U+017F>uch furie, that of the Tyrants
guard and <U+017F>ouldiers <U+017F>ome were killed, others put to flight, and all in <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>order,
that he him<U+017F>elf had much ado to get into his Palace, to which the people flocked,
and God knows what they did further. As for me, I ran pre<U+017F>ently unto your hou<U+017F>e,
where I found <hi>Andrenick,</hi> without either hat or cloak, and pitifully abu<U+017F>ed by the
followers of <hi>Childerick;</hi> yet he received not a wound: but all the hou<U+017F>e was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and all the women with their hair about their ears, and never was greater
violence and di<U+017F>order offered unto any hou<U+017F>e. As <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Andrenick</hi> and tho<U+017F>e
women <U+017F>aw me, they all cryed out for joy, and asked me where you were; unto
whom I an<U+017F>wered, that you were in a place where your greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>orrow was for
them and their injuries: and taking <hi>Andrenick</hi> a<U+017F>ide, I told him what you had
done, and where you were; at which he was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with joy, that he fell
down upon his knees and held up his hands to Heaven; Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed for ever be the great
<hi>Tantates,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, for directing you how to fore<U+017F>ee and prevent <U+017F>o great a mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
then ri<U+017F>ing up, he asked me of all circum<U+017F>tances; whether his wife was with
you, and what <U+017F>hift you made to e<U+017F>cape: and having <U+017F>atisfied him in all his que<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as briefly as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could, I left him the mo<U+017F>t contented man in the world;
but when he <U+017F>aw me ready to depart, he commanded me to tell his wife, that <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hould rather die then for<U+017F>ake you. And becau<U+017F>e I feared le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould think
the time long, I made all the ha<U+017F>te that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I could to return unto you, but with
much ado, for I found every <U+017F>treet chained up, and it was long before I could get
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53527:136"/>
a pa<U+017F>s: but at la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing the people <U+017F>o much incen<U+017F>ed, and hearing them all <U+017F>peak
very advantageou<U+017F>ly of my Lord, I told them openly that I belonged unto <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi>
and that you had <U+017F>ent me unto him to acquaint him with the violence that
<hi>Childerick</hi> had offered unto you. I cannot expre<U+017F>s Madam, how affectionately they
all offered them<U+017F>elves to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me when they heard this; I found my pa<U+017F><U+017F>age very
ea<U+017F>ie after this, and every one offered me any favour and courte<U+017F>ie I could de<U+017F>ire:
<U+017F>o as when I came to the gates, they were pre<U+017F>ently opened unto me, and when I
was out, he who kept the guard, call'd me, and <U+017F>aid; good friend, bid thy ma<U+017F>ter
make all the ha<U+017F>te he can, and tell him, that we are all ready to venture our lives for
him, in revenge of this injury which is offered. Thus the man ended his relation;
and in the mean time <hi>Silviana</hi> went on as fa<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he could out of her extream de<U+017F>ires
of meeting <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> that <U+017F>he might acquaint him with this accident, and move
him to take that revenge which the people promi<U+017F>ed.</p>
                     <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed to know Madam, that as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Childerick</hi> was <U+017F>ure that <hi>Andrimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
was gone, he a<U+017F><U+017F>embled a company of young Ruffians, which u<U+017F>ed to prompt
him unto <U+017F>uch violences, and went unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Andrimartes,</hi> where finding
none but the faithful <hi>Andrenick,</hi> and thinking that he had hid the Fair <hi>Silviana,</hi> or
at lea<U+017F>t knew where <U+017F>he was, he <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ed upon his per<U+017F>on, and offered him a thou<U+017F>and
injuries; <U+017F>o as but for <hi>Clidemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamore,</hi> he had put him to death. But they
hearing that the people a<U+017F><U+017F>embled them<U+017F>elves tumultuou<U+017F>ly together, they Armed
them<U+017F>elves, and ran into the throng of the tumult; and well it was for the King they
did <U+017F>o, for el<U+017F>e he had found the danger of an incen<U+017F>ed people, who upon great
rea<U+017F>on had Armed them<U+017F>elves. But <hi>Clidemant</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Childerick</hi> in this danger, he
drew his Sword, and di<U+017F>-engaged the King from among<U+017F>t them, though <hi>Clidemant</hi>
and <hi>Lindamore</hi> al<U+017F>o were much wounded, yet not <U+017F>o dangerou<U+017F>ly, but they accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the King into his Palace: unto which all the <hi>Segu<U+017F>ians</hi> pre<U+017F>ently flocked, and
among<U+017F>t them <hi>Guyemant,</hi> who though he was known to be the <U+017F>ervant of <hi>Childerick,</hi>
yet was not hated by the people, becau<U+017F>e every one knew that he was none of that
debauched number, which prompted the King unto the<U+017F>e unworthy and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cour<U+017F>es. When <hi>Lindamore</hi> <U+017F>pied him, Oh <hi>Guyemant,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) mu<U+017F>t
<hi>Clidemant</hi> do pennance for a fault which he never committed?</p>
                     <p>Heavens forbid, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Guyemant</hi> and was much troubled) I hope <U+017F>o great
a mi<U+017F>-fortune will not befall us: Then going neerer unto <hi>Clidemant,</hi> he kneeled down
by his bed-<U+017F>ide, and taking him by the hand, Sir, <U+017F>aid he unto him, let your courage
make it appear, that you are able to overcome a greater mis-fortune then this. Dear
friend (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Clidemant</hi>) I do not want courage, but yet I am not able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t
the power of death. <hi>Guyemant</hi> with tears in his eyes, then <U+017F>aid unto him, I hope
that <hi>Tautates</hi> will not afflict us <U+017F>o much, as to ravi<U+017F>h from us a Prince <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
for the happine<U+017F>s of men, but will let us enjoy him longer to our happine<U+017F>s and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
<hi>Guyemant,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he, we are all in the hands of the great <hi>Tautates;</hi> he
may di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of us as he plea<U+017F>eth: and for my part, <U+017F>o he will be plea<U+017F>ed to let me
leave this life, with that good reputation which my <hi>Ancestors</hi> did leave unto me, I
<U+017F>hall be well contented and <U+017F>atisfied with the time that I have already lived. Then
calling <hi>Lindamore</hi> unto him, who was wounded, though not <U+017F>o mortally as he, and
who was all in tears to <U+017F>ee his Lord in this extremity: You two (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damore</hi>
and <hi>Guyemant</hi>) are the per<U+017F>ons in whom I have greate<U+017F>t confidence; <hi>Guye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
I conjure you to tell <hi>Childerick,</hi> that I do die his <U+017F>ervant, and am very <U+017F>orry
that I have given no greater te<U+017F>timony of my affection: yet tell him, that if the <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
which I have done unto the King his Father, have any influence upon him; I
hope he will not take it ill if you tell him from me, that if he do not leave this ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
life, which he hath lived <U+017F>ince he was King, he mu<U+017F>t expect a puni<U+017F>hment from
Heaven. And you <hi>Lindamore,</hi> as <U+017F>oon as I am dead, or at lea<U+017F>t, as <U+017F>oon as your
wounds will permit you, carry back all the <hi>Segu<U+017F>ian</hi> Cavalry into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
re<U+017F>tore them back from me unto the Nymph my Mother, unto who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervice,
I conjure you, to continue faithful as you have begun: de<U+017F>ire her not to grieve for
the lo<U+017F>s of me, <U+017F>ince it is the will of Heaven to have it <U+017F>o; and de<U+017F>ire her to comfort
her <U+017F>elf with this, that I have imployed the time which I lived, in the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and die without reproach. Al<U+017F>o tell my dear Si<U+017F>ter, that if any thing make me
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53527:137"/>
unwilling to die <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, it is my de<U+017F>ires of <U+017F>eeing her, more then any thing el<U+017F>e;
then cau<U+017F>ing us all to be called for, and <U+017F>eeing mo<U+017F>t of us <U+017F>tanding by his beds-<U+017F>ide,
with tears in our eyes, he <U+017F>tretched out his hand unto us, and commanded us to
obey <hi>Lindamore</hi> as him<U+017F>elf; but above all to <U+017F>erve you Madam, and the Nymph
<hi>Galathea,</hi> with all the fidelity of true Cavaliers, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring us that we <U+017F>hould receive
from you a full recompence for all the <U+017F>ervices which we had done unto him.</p>
                     <p>He would have <U+017F>aid <U+017F>omething more, but his Spirits fail'd him, and he dyed in
the arms of <hi>Lindamore;</hi> who <U+017F>eeing this, for grief fell into a <U+017F>woon. I cannot expre<U+017F>s
our <U+017F>orrows, nor the <U+017F>orrows of all the Court, when they heard of his death: the
very people of the Town, who commonly are very dull in <U+017F>uch re<U+017F>entments, did
lament him, and al<U+017F>o applaud him to the Heavens, <U+017F>aying; that the death of this
Prince was a great lo<U+017F>s unto their Nation and Crown; they were <U+017F>ure he never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented
unto the Violent Extravagancies, and Tyranny of <hi>Childerick,</hi> and doubtle<U+017F>s
our condolements had been much more, but for the imminent peril and danger which
pre<U+017F>ently after did threaten us; the fear of our lives forced us to <U+017F>tand upon our guard:
And at the <U+017F>ame time, as fortune was, all the Lords and Grandees which were a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embled
at <hi>Province,</hi> not knowing of this accident, came all to feel the pul<U+017F>e of the
people; and finding them to beat after their own tempers, and with Arms in their
hands, they put it into the peoples heads to go and clamor at the Palace Royal, with
abundance of Drums and Trumpets; which making a great noi<U+017F>e, <hi>Childerick</hi> began
to fear the fury of the<U+017F>e mutinies. And becau<U+017F>e he had a great confidence in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of <hi>Lindamore,</hi> and in the advice of <hi>Guyemant,</hi> he <U+017F>ent for them both to advi<U+017F>e
about his <U+017F>afety: neither of them both would in this juncture of danger upbraid him
with his faults; but both offered him their aid and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to the hazard of their
lives. <hi>Lindamore</hi> though wounded, advi<U+017F>ed to fall pre<U+017F>ently upon the enemy, and
coun<U+017F>elled the King to die like a King, and a man of courage. But <hi>Guyemant,</hi> like
a wi<U+017F>e and prudent Coun<U+017F>ellor advi<U+017F>ed the contrary: Sir, <U+017F>aid he, let us not too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>perately
precipitate our <U+017F>elves, till there be no hopes of <U+017F>afety; though we were near a
thou<U+017F>and men, yet we were nothing to the number of the enemy: time is the ma<U+017F>ter
of occa<U+017F>ions, and may unexpectedly fit us with them: it is wi<U+017F>dom therefore to <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto time, and <U+017F>ail with the wind; nothing is now to be done but to u<U+017F>e our be<U+017F>t
endeavours for the changing the mind of this tumultuous people, <U+017F>ince we <U+017F>ee all
the Grandees both of <hi>Gaul</hi> and of the <hi>Franks</hi> are joyned with them; it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<hi>Andrimartes</hi> and all his Friends will al<U+017F>o comply, for he is already <U+017F>ent unto:
<hi>Gillon</hi> the Roman likewi<U+017F>e with all his adherents will doubtle<U+017F>s be <U+017F>tirring; and who
knows whether <hi>Renauld</hi> and his Brother the Sons of <hi>Clodion,</hi> will not be fi<U+017F>hing
in the<U+017F>e troubled waters? And therefore what good can we ever hope to do by
force? I advi<U+017F>e therefore, and Sir if you will follow my Coun<U+017F>ell, I will engage
my life to re<U+017F>tore you unto the Crown of your Father: I advi<U+017F>e you, I <U+017F>ay, to
yeild unto the violence of this aver<U+017F>e piece of Fortune; retire your <U+017F>elf out of
this Kingdom, and re<U+017F>t quiet with <hi>Ba<U+017F>in,</hi> in <hi>Thuring;</hi> he is your Kin<U+017F>man and
your Friend, he will be glad to have you in his hou<U+017F>e, and ready to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t a
great affied Prince: In the mean time I call the Gods to witne<U+017F>s, that when
you are ab<U+017F>ent, I will imploy my whole intere<U+017F>t and endeavours to reconcile
you unto the People, and I make no doubt but to effect it, if you will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the advice which I <U+017F>hall give.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Guyemant</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner done <U+017F>peaking, but they heard a Trumpet, which being
come neerer the draw Bridge, <U+017F>ounded thrice, and afterwards they heard the<U+017F>e
words uttered in a loud voice:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53527:137"/>
                        <q>The Druides, the Princes, and all the Cavalry of the Franks
and Gaules, a<U+017F><U+017F>embled and united, do declare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
GILLON King of the Franks; and Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
a Tyrant, and incapable of wearing the Crown of
his Father.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Childerick</hi> and <hi>Guyemant</hi> upon this looked out of the window into the <U+017F>treet, and
they <U+017F>aw <hi>Gillon</hi> carried, according to the cu<U+017F>tom, upon the peoples <U+017F>houlders, with
<U+017F>uch loud acclamations of the people, that <hi>Childerick</hi> <U+017F>aw <hi>Guyemant</hi> told him truly,
and therefore fearing le<U+017F>t his own <U+017F>ervants <U+017F>hould betray him, he retired him<U+017F>elf
with the faithful <hi>Guyemant,</hi> and after <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hort di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e together, he parted from
him; carrying with him one half of a piece of gold, for a token, that when <hi>Guye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
<U+017F>ent him the other half, he might return into his Kingdom in <U+017F>afety: the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of this piece being joyned together, was on one <U+017F>ide a <hi>Tower,</hi> to expre<U+017F>s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy;
and on the other a <hi>Dolphin</hi> amid<U+017F>t the Surging Waves, with this Motto
about, <hi>De<U+017F>tiny does not Cro<U+017F>s any:</hi> Then changing his habit, he entreated <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damore,</hi>
though he was wounded, to accompany him with his <hi>Segu<U+017F>ian</hi> Cavalry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he was out of the hands of this tumultuous people; <hi>Lindamore</hi> con<U+017F>ented; and
<hi>Guyemant</hi> promi<U+017F>ed to give an honourable funeral unto the Prince <hi>Clidemant.</hi>
Night being come, the King got <U+017F>ecretly out of the gates, and was conducted by
us Cavaliers as far as <hi>Thuring,</hi> and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Lindamores</hi> wounds would not give him
leave to travel, he was forted to <U+017F>tay upon his return in the Town of <hi>Rhemois,</hi> where
the Queen <hi>Methina</hi> had a particular care of him and his cure.</p>
                     <p>There we heard how the Generous <hi>Andrimartes</hi> having met with the Fair <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viana,</hi>
pre<U+017F>ently re<U+017F>olved upon revenge; but hearing the <U+017F>ame day how <hi>Childerick</hi>
was puni<U+017F>hed, he thought it be<U+017F>t to retire into his own dominions, and pardon the
fault of <hi>Childerick,</hi> which he did in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort excu<U+017F>e, con<U+017F>idering the <U+017F>uperlative
beauty of <hi>Silviana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lindamore</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, thought it expedient to acquaint you Madam with
the news, which though it be extreamly <U+017F>ad, yet fearing the neglect of it might be
di<U+017F>-<U+017F>ervice unto you, I did undertake his commands, and became the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Cavalier ended with his eyes full of tears; but <hi>Galathea</hi> hearing of her
Brothers death, although <U+017F>he con<U+017F>trained her <U+017F>elf as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could, yet
<U+017F>he fell into <U+017F>uch a flood of tears, that <U+017F>he did <U+017F>ufficiently pay the tribute of human
imbecility, and <U+017F>hewed her good nature. Her Mother gave her time to di<U+017F>charge
her <U+017F>elf of her ju<U+017F>t grief, and in the mean time asked the Cavalier whether <hi>Lindamore</hi>
intended to return ere it was long: and he an<U+017F>wering, that he <U+017F>tayed only for his
recovery, <U+017F>he took <hi>Adamas</hi> a<U+017F>ide, and commanded the Cavalier to withdraw, until
<U+017F>he <U+017F>ent for him again, but gave him a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trict charge, to acquaint none living
with the death of <hi>Clidemant,</hi> nor of any accidents that had hapned unto <hi>Lindamore,</hi>
or King <hi>Childerick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Cavalier was gone, and none within compa<U+017F>s of hearing but <hi>Galathea,</hi>
<U+017F>he turned towards the <hi>Druide</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto him: You hear Father this <U+017F>ad news,
and I mu<U+017F>t tell you that the lo<U+017F>s of my Son goes very neer my heart; nights can be<U+017F>t
te<U+017F>tifie my tears: but the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of affairs forces me to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble my <U+017F>orrows in
the day; and Daughter it is very requi<U+017F>ite you do the <U+017F>ame, for if the death of <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demant</hi>
<U+017F>hould come to be known before we have put our affairs into good order, I
am afraid <hi>Polemas</hi> <U+017F>hould take advantage of the ab<U+017F>ence of all our Cavalry, and plot
<U+017F>ome trea<U+017F>on again<U+017F>t us. I <U+017F>peak-not this without <U+017F>ome ground of rea<U+017F>on, for I have
ob<U+017F>erved of late, that this man a<U+017F><U+017F>umes more authority to him<U+017F>elf then he ought; he
has made two attempts already upon the life of <hi>Damon,</hi> even in your pre<U+017F>ence, and
this becau<U+017F>e he feares I have no fancy to marry you unto him. But that which mo<U+017F>t
di<U+017F>covers his bad intentions, is the letters which <hi>Gondebaut</hi> King of the <hi>Burgundians</hi>
did write unto him, which I have <U+017F>een, and which intimate a very clo<U+017F>e corre<U+017F>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
betwixt them; The<U+017F>e things being thus clo<U+017F>ely hid from me, mu<U+017F>t needs be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53527:138"/>
unto my di<U+017F>advantage; and I believe his de<U+017F>ign is to attempt again<U+017F>t the State, and
to e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h his u<U+017F>urpation by ravi<U+017F>hing <hi>Galathea</hi> from me, and marrying her either
by good will or by force.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heavens Madam, cryed out <hi>Galathea;</hi> do you think this pernicious man has
any <U+017F>uch abominable de<U+017F>ign? It is not to be doubted Madam, an<U+017F>wered the <hi>Druide,</hi>
and I ground my opinion upon his procuring that Impo<U+017F>tor to place him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o neer
the Gardens of <hi>Mount Bri<U+017F>on,</hi> to deceive you under a colour of Sanctity, and of
being a <hi>Druide,</hi> and to try if by this means he could obtain your favour; but <U+017F>eeing
that this failed him, and that <hi>Clidemant, Lindamore,</hi> and all the Cavalry are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent,
he may very well take hold of this opportunity, and make u<U+017F>e of his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pondents
to that purpo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince the whole government of the Country is in his
hands; therefore, I humbly conceive Madam, (<U+017F>aid he unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>) that your
be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e is to ha<U+017F>ten <hi>Lindamore's</hi> return as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he can, and that he
bring with him al his Cavalry; in the mean time, retire your <U+017F>elf into the City of
<hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> where without any noi<U+017F>e, I will <U+017F>end unto you as many Souldiers and
Cavaliers as I can: within two dayes I will come thither my <U+017F>elf, and if it be po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bring <hi>Damon</hi> with me, for I do not think the Country <U+017F>afe enough again<U+017F>t the
violence of <hi>Polemas.</hi> I do vow (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi>) that if this wicked man do offer
any attemps upon my per<U+017F>on, I will with my own hands and nails <U+017F>trangle my <U+017F>elf-Daughter,
(an<U+017F>wered <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>) good Angels pre<U+017F>erve you from any <U+017F>uch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
I had rather <U+017F>ee you in your Coffin, then under the <U+017F>ubjection of this in<U+017F>olent
man; but I hope never to <U+017F>ee it: and yet it concerns us to u<U+017F>e that remedy which
<hi>Adamas</hi> out of his prudence and fidelity, hath propounded unto us; this very night
you <U+017F>hall go with me unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> we will carry <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Daphnide,</hi> and all
their Company with us, and entreat them to leave off that habit which <U+017F>uits <U+017F>o ill
with their qualities; to morrow, I will <U+017F>end a letter for <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Madonthe:</hi>
But Father (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and turned towards <hi>Adamas</hi>) as for the <hi>Druide,</hi> who was
formerly at <hi>Mount Bri<U+017F>on,</hi> who told Fortunes, and lived with <U+017F>o much appearance
of Sanctity, you mu<U+017F>t know that he is returned again, and begins to live, and do as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
he did: Oh Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas,</hi> he is a mo<U+017F>t abominable Impo<U+017F>tor,
and did you but know how <hi>Polemas</hi> makes u<U+017F>e of him, you would think them both
worthy of puni<U+017F>hment: but the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of it will be too long for this time, for I <U+017F>ee
the Sun grow very low, and you have no more time then to return unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles</hi>
by day light; but if we could <U+017F>ei<U+017F>e upon this Impo<U+017F>tor, perhaps we <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover
by him what the de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Polemas</hi> is, for he is one of his great in<U+017F>truments. <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
who<U+017F>e very <U+017F>pleen again<U+017F>t this man had almo<U+017F>t dryed up her tears, if you plea<U+017F>e
(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) we <U+017F>hall ea<U+017F>ily take him; for there needs no more but to pretend that I
de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>peak with him: but I do not know how to manage the matter hand<U+017F>omly,
without the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <hi>Leonide,</hi> and therefore it is requi<U+017F>ite to <U+017F>end for her. A<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
your <U+017F>elf Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Adamas,</hi> that to morrow I will <U+017F>end her unto you;
and yet I think it a good way to <U+017F>end <hi>Silvia</hi> to morrow very early unto this Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tor,
to tell him that you Madam have a very great de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee him, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this two or three dayes you intend to come unto him; this will al<U+017F>o deceive <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
and perhaps may cau<U+017F>e him to retard his wicked de<U+017F>ign, which will be very
advantageous unto us: for we <U+017F>hall have more time to provide for our defence,
which I fore<U+017F>ee we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>tand in need of. This being re<U+017F>olved upon, <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more delay, and to give <hi>Galathea</hi> time to dry her eyes, <U+017F>he called for Pen, Ink,
and Paper, to write unto <hi>Lindamore,</hi> that he <U+017F>hould in all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>te come unto
her, and that he <U+017F>hould under<U+017F>tand the great nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of his pre<U+017F>ence by the bearer:
which done, <U+017F>he called for the Cavalier, gave him the Letter, and commanded him
not to lo<U+017F>e one minute of time, but po<U+017F>t unto <hi>Lindamore</hi> withal po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>peed, and
tell him that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee his good affection by the ha<U+017F>te that he will make in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her, and bringing with him all his Cavalry and Souldiers: And becau<U+017F>e the
Cavalier was very tru<U+017F>ty, and <hi>Lindamore,</hi> had great confidence in him, <U+017F>he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with the wicked intentions of <hi>Polemas,</hi> purpo<U+017F>ely to make him more quick
in his imployment, and to bring back <hi>Lindamore</hi> the <U+017F>ooner. The Cavalier without
more delay took his leave; and <hi>Galathea</hi> to oblige <hi>Lindamore</hi> to make the more ha<U+017F>te,
Good Sir, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, tell <hi>Lindamore</hi> that I <U+017F>hall know whether or no he be
my friend, by the ha<U+017F>te that he <U+017F>hall make.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:53527:138"/>
Upon this the Cavalier departed, and the Nymphs with <hi>Adamas</hi> went out, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, they entreated <hi>Daphnide</hi> and her Company to go
along with them, and pa<U+017F>s away <U+017F>ome dayes in <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles. Daphnide</hi> ca<U+017F>ting her eye
upon <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and <U+017F>eeing that he referred it unto her, <U+017F>he thought it not civil to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Nymph, and therefore <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he would wait upon her: for which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> gave
them thanks; and taking <hi>Daphnide</hi> by the hand, <U+017F>he went unto <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the.
Damon,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, I intend to <U+017F>end my letter for you to morrow, and
I de<U+017F>ire that for the rea<U+017F>ons which <hi>Adamas</hi> will give you, you will put your <U+017F>elf to a
little more paines in coming unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles.</hi> Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Damon,</hi> I have
both <U+017F>trength and devotion to <U+017F>erve you in what<U+017F>oever you plea<U+017F>e to command.
After this, night compelled the Nymph to depart with all this good company; and
<U+017F>he was <U+017F>o careful to <U+017F>end for <hi>Damon</hi> in the morning, that before ten of the clock,
he was at <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles</hi> with <hi>Madonthe, Adamas,</hi> and <hi>Leonide.</hi> But <hi>Paris</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
de<U+017F>irous of going unto <hi>Belinde,</hi> he entreated <hi>Adamas</hi> he would be plea<U+017F>ed
to write the letter which he had promi<U+017F>ed: <hi>Adamas</hi> being al<U+017F>o very willing to give
him all <U+017F>atisfaction, did write according to his de<U+017F>ires: upon this, he departed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
<U+017F>o glad of <hi>Dianas</hi> permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and <hi>Adamas</hi> his con<U+017F>ent, as he could not
tell how to wi<U+017F>h for more happine<U+017F>s.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adamas</hi> in <U+017F>atisfaction unto <hi>Galatheas</hi> de<U+017F>ire, <U+017F>ent the <U+017F>ame night for <hi>Leonide,</hi> to
the end <U+017F>he might be with her the next morning betimes. And <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he was to go
unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> he writ unto her that <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>hould not upon any terms go with her,
le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be known; and therefore <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould provide her <U+017F>elf with <U+017F>ome hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ome
excu<U+017F>e, and that this <U+017F>eparation would not be for above two or three dayes at
the mo<U+017F>t. When <hi>Leonide</hi> received this letter it was almo<U+017F>t night, and as it chanced,
<hi>Astrea</hi> had carried them unto <hi>Dianas</hi> hou<U+017F>e: <U+017F>o as whil<U+017F>t <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was talking with
<hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Daphnis, Leonide</hi> <U+017F>hewed <hi>Alexis</hi> the letter which <U+017F>he had received. At
the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he was a little troubled at it, thinking it very odd <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay alone in
a place, where if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould come to be known, it would turn to her di<U+017F>grace. But
on the other <U+017F>ide con<U+017F>idering, that if <U+017F>he went unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be utterly
ruined, <U+017F>he was contented to <U+017F>tay <U+017F>till in that place, pretending that <U+017F>he was not yet
well, and telling <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> in private, that <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o much in Love with this retired
kind of life, as <U+017F>he had no mind of going unto <hi>Galathea</hi> who had <U+017F>ent for her; and
that <U+017F>he would fain her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>ick, purpo<U+017F>ely to <U+017F>tay with her in a place that was free
from the turbulent noi<U+017F>e of a Court. Thus <hi>Leonide,</hi> got up betimes the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and left <hi>Phillis</hi> in bed with <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> and taking her leave of them, <U+017F>he promi<U+017F>ed
to return very <U+017F>hortly to <U+017F>ee them and <hi>Alexis;</hi> then going unto this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide</hi>
who was not yet up: be <U+017F>ure (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her in her ear) that you manage your
time hand<U+017F>omly, and let not good opportunities <U+017F>lip<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> 
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> an<U+017F>wered her only
with a <U+017F>igh, and then <hi>Leonide</hi> went unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> and afterwards with him unto
<hi>Galathea,</hi> leaving the di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide</hi> in abundance of content, and more might
have had, if <U+017F>he had had but confidence enough to make u<U+017F>e of that fair occa<U+017F>ion.</p>
                     <p>Although <hi>Galathea</hi> out of a violent fit of jealou<U+017F>ie had bani<U+017F>hed the Nymph <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi>
from her pre<U+017F>ence, yet <U+017F>he did after wi<U+017F>h for her again, as well of her own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
goodne<U+017F>s, when <U+017F>he remembred the affection and fidelity of that Lady; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion being now a little cooled, her judgment rea<U+017F><U+017F>umed its <U+017F>trength,
and <U+017F>uffered her to think her not <U+017F>o culpable, as in the heat of her anger <U+017F>he thought
her: moreover the help of <hi>Silvia</hi> did not a little help her to di<U+017F>charge <hi>Leonide</hi> of
<hi>Celadons</hi> e<U+017F>cape, when they talked together. But that which mo<U+017F>t made her forget
all her anger again<U+017F>t this Nymph, was the death of <hi>Clidemant,</hi> and the enterpri<U+017F>e of
<hi>Polemas,</hi> who had <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>igns both again<U+017F>t her per<U+017F>on and e<U+017F>tate. And becau<U+017F>e
great pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions have a quality which drown all inferiors, and makes the <U+017F>oul think
upon nothing but it, this Nymph was <U+017F>o extreamly offended again<U+017F>t the boldne<U+017F>s
and trea<U+017F>on of <hi>Polemas,</hi> that her mind did run wholly how <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e him:
<U+017F>hewing by this, that a generous Spirit can hardly brook any unworthy violence.</p>
                     <p>And ob<U+017F>erve how Heaven does laugh at the <U+017F>ubtilties of men, and how ea<U+017F>ily it
can confute all human policy, and turn it to their own di<U+017F>-advantage: All the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
which <hi>Polemas</hi> had u<U+017F>ed to ruine <hi>Lindamore</hi> in <hi>Galatheas</hi> affection, being once
di<U+017F>covered, it made her Love him more; and the ra<U+017F>h enterpri<U+017F>e upon which he laid
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53527:139"/>
the foundation of his future Grandeur, did revive in her tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>parks which were
almo<U+017F>t quite extingui<U+017F>hed by the <U+017F>ubtilties of <hi>Polemas</hi> and <hi>Climanthes. Lindamore</hi>
being ab<U+017F>ent, could not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon be a witne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e favours which this renewed
Love prepared for him: and <hi>Galathea</hi> longed for one unto whom <U+017F>he might freely
di<U+017F>charge her heart of <U+017F>uch thoughts as were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to be concealed; when <U+017F>he
looked upon tho<U+017F>e that were about her, <U+017F>he found none capable of the <U+017F>ecret: as
for <hi>Silvia</hi> and her Nur<U+017F>e, who knew mo<U+017F>t of her <U+017F>ecrets, <U+017F>he thought the one too
young, and the other too old; and though <U+017F>he was confident of both their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and fidelities, and though the prudence and wi<U+017F>edom of <hi>Silvia</hi> was above her
age, yet <U+017F>he thought that matters of State were things of too great a weight to tru<U+017F>t
them withall: and upon this rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>eeking for a good occa<U+017F>ion to recal <hi>Leonide,</hi>
and con<U+017F>idering that <U+017F>he never had any good ground to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect either her affection
or fidelity, unle<U+017F>s it was in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of <hi>Celadon,</hi> which being now out of mind,
and new accidents coming in lieu of it, they blotted out the memory of the other.
So as this new bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s coming upon her, and <U+017F>o neerly concerning her, <U+017F>he accu<U+017F>ed
her <U+017F>elf of too much ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s in bani<U+017F>hing <hi>Leonide,</hi> <U+017F>he intended to let <U+017F>lip no occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of calling her back, and treating her better for the future.</p>
                     <p>And in as much as it is natural to de<U+017F>ire the concealment of our faults, <hi>Galathea</hi>
de<U+017F>iring not to be taxed with levity and incon<U+017F>ideration in the bani<U+017F>hment of <hi>Leonide</hi>
from her, <U+017F>he did with abundance of care <U+017F>eek out for a good occa<U+017F>ion of calling
her back, without giving any knowledg of the cau<U+017F>e why <U+017F>he did bani<U+017F>h her: <U+017F>o as
when it was <U+017F>aid that <hi>Climanthes</hi> was returned, and when <U+017F>he heard that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>
and <hi>Adamas</hi> de<U+017F>ired to know whether it was the Impo<U+017F>tor who had formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid that <hi>Leonide</hi> knew him better then any other, though <U+017F>he
knew well enough that <hi>Silvia</hi> knew him as well as <U+017F>he; and not to let <U+017F>lip this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
<U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired <hi>Adamas</hi> to bring her back pre<U+017F>ently: <hi>Leonide</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide,
when her Uncle acquainted her with <hi>Galatheas</hi> will, <U+017F>he was willing to obey her, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem too much di<U+017F>contented: but with a re<U+017F>olution of returning unto the
plea<U+017F>ant banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could, as well to avoid the confu<U+017F>ed
life of the Court, as to enjoy the <U+017F>weet liberty in which <U+017F>he lived among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es: and though <U+017F>he did not tell her <U+017F>elf as much, yet the
true rea<U+017F>on of her de<U+017F>ires to return, was to <U+017F>ee <hi>Celadon,</hi> whom <U+017F>he left di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed
under the habit and name of <hi>Alexis:</hi> for though <U+017F>he had endeavoured as much as
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could to quench that flame in her <U+017F>elf, yet <U+017F>he found how hard a matter
it is for a <U+017F>oul to rea<U+017F><U+017F>ume its former liberty, after it is once captivated with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
love; and <U+017F>he could not free her <U+017F>elf from that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, though <U+017F>he knew
that <hi>Celadon</hi> would never leave <hi>A<U+017F>trea:</hi> confuting hereby the opinion of tho<U+017F>e who
affirm, that there is no love without <U+017F>ome hope.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Leonide</hi> came unto the hou<U+017F>e of her Uncle <hi>Adamas,</hi> though it was very
early, yet <U+017F>he found all ready to depart: for the <hi>Druide</hi> knowing that important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
requires all ha<U+017F>te, and that it is ha<U+017F>te which gives them both life and accompli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he had taken order for every thing requi<U+017F>ite by the break of day; both for
<hi>Damon</hi> and for <hi>Madonthe: Ama<U+017F>is</hi> had <U+017F>ent a good guard of Souldiers to be their
convoy, under a pretence of an honour unto them, and not as if <U+017F>he feared any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
would be offered unto them by the way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvia,</hi> and mo<U+017F>t of her Companions, who knew of <hi>Leonides</hi> return, went and
waited for her at the outmo<U+017F>t gate of the Ca<U+017F>tle, and did expre<U+017F>s <U+017F>o many <U+017F>igns of
good will, as made it mo<U+017F>t evident that they loved her, at the lea<U+017F>t, if any true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip
can be found in a Court. <hi>Silvia</hi> above all the re<U+017F>t, embraced and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her a
hundred times: and as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aluted <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> who received her very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and had ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hands of <hi>Galathea,</hi> who welcomed her with extraordinary
care<U+017F><U+017F>es, they <U+017F>eparated them<U+017F>elves as <U+017F>oon as they could from the re<U+017F>t of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and related unto each other all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages which had hapned <U+017F>ince their
la<U+017F>t being together. <hi>Leonide</hi> with a calm temper related how plea<U+017F>ingly <U+017F>he had <U+017F>pent
the time of her bani<U+017F>hment, in the company of tho<U+017F>e fair and di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es,
and told even wonders of their beauty, virtue, courte<U+017F>ie, civility, and wit, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis:</hi> but in this, more <U+017F>ubtile then her companion,
<U+017F>he <U+017F>poke not a <U+017F>illable of <hi>Celadon,</hi> thinking it no di<U+017F>cretion to tru<U+017F>t a young woman
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53527:139"/>
with a thing which once known, might bring her much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure: and when <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
asked her concerning <hi>Alexis,</hi> as thinking her to be the daughter of <hi>Adamas,</hi>
<U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered very coldly and carele<U+017F>ly, and <U+017F>aid, that indeed <U+017F>he was a very good
harmle<U+017F>s body, and had a wit <U+017F>utable unto the profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, in which <U+017F>he had been
educated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Madonthe</hi> were in the interim received with all honour that <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi>
and <hi>Galathea</hi> could do them, as well in duty to their merit, as to oblige <hi>Damon</hi> to
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them in the urgent affairs which they fore<U+017F>aw. When he was got into bed,
and the Chirurgions looked upon his wounds, though the <U+017F>haking in the litter had
a little altered them, yet they thought that in a very few days he would be perfectly
whole: for though his wounds were great, yet they were not dangerous; and his
meeting with <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and finding her as affectionate unto him as he could de<U+017F>ire,
conduced much to his cure; and therefore every one conceived that the Chirurgery
unto the body, was to begin with the cure of the heart and mind. <hi>Madonthe</hi> on her
<U+017F>ide, finding how much good her kindne<U+017F>s did unto him, <U+017F>he was almo<U+017F>t continually
with him, <U+017F>hewing unto him all manner of civil favours: and fore<U+017F>eeing that <U+017F>he
was to <U+017F>tay long in that place in expectation of <hi>Damon</hi> cure, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to change
her habit and become a Nymph; <U+017F>he knew that <hi>Damon</hi> would be better plea<U+017F>ed with
it, as more <U+017F>utable to her quality: and her new dre<U+017F>s did <U+017F>o well become her, as <U+017F>he
appeared to be a great beauty, which manife<U+017F>ts, that beauty receives no <U+017F>mall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from trimming up it <U+017F>elf.</p>
                     <p>Night being come, and <hi>Galathea</hi> having commanded <hi>Leonide</hi> to lie in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw that all the re<U+017F>t were retired, <U+017F>he called unto her; and cau<U+017F>ing
her to take a candle, as if <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice for her: then looking a long while
upon her without <U+017F>peaking a word: at the la<U+017F>t with a <U+017F>miling eye <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto her,
well <hi>Leonide,</hi> are you <U+017F>till angry with me? With you Madam (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide</hi>
and made a low courte<U+017F>ie) why, I be<U+017F>eech you, do you ask that que<U+017F>tion? Do you
think me to be out of my wits? I mo<U+017F>t humbly be<U+017F>eech you to believe that <hi>Leonide</hi>
will never fail in that honour and re<U+017F>pect which I ow unto you. But Madam (<U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he, and <U+017F>miled) may I a<U+017F><U+017F>ume <U+017F>o much boldne<U+017F>s as to ask you the very <U+017F>ame que<U+017F>tion
which you do me? Yes <hi>Leonide,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea,</hi> and let us here make a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
and <U+017F>o rip up the whole matter, that we never after have any occa<U+017F>ion to
jarr: the truth is, you was angry with me, and I with you; and for my part I will
confe<U+017F>s it proceeded from jealou<U+017F>ie: but <hi>Leonide</hi> why were you angry? If you will
needs have it <U+017F>o that I was angry, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> it did proceed from the <U+017F>ame
jealou<U+017F>ie: How? replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> were you jealous of me? No Madam, an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Leonide,</hi> but if I was angry, it was to <U+017F>ee you jealous, and that you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect
me of a crime, whereof I was not guilty. Then <hi>Leonide,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Nymph, I
would have all things to be forgotten, and if I was too ra<U+017F>h, excu<U+017F>e my error; for
truly I had an opinion that all which the <hi>Druide</hi> told me, was as certain as if it had
come from the mouth of an Oracle: Oh Madam, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> that <hi>Druide</hi> was
a mo<U+017F>t vile Impo<U+017F>tor, and had you been plea<U+017F>ed to have believed me, his villany
<U+017F>hould never have deceived you. Alas, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea,</hi> I was <U+017F>o deceived by
his language, as I was extreamly offended with all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>poke unto me again<U+017F>t
him. But Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> do you know the truth now? Oh Sweet-heart,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea,</hi> I have <U+017F>ince found him to my co<U+017F>t, a very knave: I am mo<U+017F>t
heartily glad of it, replied the Nymph, for then you will find my innocency. Speak
no more concerning your <U+017F>elf, replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> for I have quite altered my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and believe, that if I could have met with an opportunity, I <U+017F>hould have called
you back unto me before now; but I would not upon any terms that the cau<U+017F>e of our
difference <U+017F>hould be known; yet I prote<U+017F>t unto you <hi>Leonide,</hi> I never wi<U+017F>hed you
any ill; it is true, I was angry with you, upon the ground that I have told you, but
for all that, I loved you better then any that are in my <U+017F>ervice: and I think it may
be excu<U+017F>ed for being angry, for <hi>Leonide</hi> confe<U+017F>s the truth, did not you help <hi>Celadon</hi>
to e<U+017F>cape? And were not you to blame for oppo<U+017F>ing my will? Confe<U+017F>s it freely
<hi>Leonide,</hi> for now, I care not for him, and will pardon you. Madam, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Leonide</hi> and <U+017F>miled, I <U+017F>ee you de<U+017F>ire I <U+017F>hould confe<U+017F><U+017F>e a fault which I never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and <U+017F>ince you have no more intere<U+017F>t in him, I will freely confe<U+017F>s, and prote<U+017F>t
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53527:140"/>
that I did nothing but change <hi>Celadon</hi> into <hi>Lucinda,</hi> and you your <U+017F>elf did approve
of what I did, when I dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him in the habit of a woman. But why <U+017F>hould I be <U+017F>o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>irous
of packing him from you? And what intere<U+017F>t had I in it? If you had no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t,
replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> why did you <U+017F>o often importune me to let him return unto
<hi>A<U+017F>trea?</hi> Many rea<U+017F>ons, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide</hi> did induce me thereunto: Fir<U+017F>t, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
le<U+017F>t that a man <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een among<U+017F>t us, and what a blemi<U+017F>h would it have
been to your reputation, if it had been known? Next, the ingratitude and <U+017F>corn of
that Shepherd did extreamly di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e me: I thought him unworthy of that honour
which you did him, and which he did <U+017F>o ill acknowledg: but my chief rea<U+017F>on of all
was, becau<U+017F>e I was <U+017F>ure you was deceived, and that the trea<U+017F>on was invented by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas</hi>
and <hi>Climanthes,</hi> tho<U+017F>e two unworthy wretches: and how came you to know
there villany? <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea.</hi> Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> I told you then, but pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
kept you from believing me: when <hi>Celadon</hi> was <U+017F>ick, you <U+017F>ent me unto <hi>Adamas;</hi>
and by fortune coming into an Inn, I was lodged in a chamber, next unto that where
<hi>Polemas</hi> and <hi>Climanthes</hi> were all alone, and when they lea<U+017F>t dreamed of it, I heard
all their villany. Ah <hi>Leonide,</hi> replied the Nymph, I will remember that you told me
as much, but time only could teach me how to believe you. <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> my Mother
was deceived in him as well as I, and would never <U+017F>uffer him to be puni<U+017F>hed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his merit: but nothing is <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e which time does not di<U+017F>cover, my Mother
hath <U+017F>ince found out his knavery; for all that he <U+017F>aid in relation to <hi>Clidemant,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ab<U+017F>olutely fal<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o as now, <U+017F>he hates him as much as either you or I can. I am
very glad, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> that the knavery of this wicked man is known, and more
glad to <U+017F>ee you convinced of that error which he infu<U+017F>ed into you, and <U+017F>hould be as
glad to <U+017F>ee him puni<U+017F>hed for an example, and in terror of all <U+017F>uch Impo<U+017F>tors. Never
fear it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> for I believe that ere long we <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>ufficiently revenged;
you mu<U+017F>t know, that he is of late returned again, and therefore I much de<U+017F>ired your
return al<U+017F>o. How Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> is that Impo<U+017F>tor returned again? It is as I
tell you, replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> and it is to be believed that he has <U+017F>ome grand de<U+017F>ign in
hand, for he is the great Coun<U+017F>ellor of that Traitor <hi>Polemas.</hi> Oh Heavens Madam,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> how infinitely you joy me to hear you <U+017F>peak thus of tho<U+017F>e two wicked
men; but, if I may be <U+017F>o bold as to ask, I be<U+017F>eech you what have they done of late?
They have done <U+017F>uch things, an<U+017F>wered the Nymph, that when you hear them, you,
will admire and abhor them both: they are plotting no le<U+017F>s then the ruine of us and
all the Country: I do love you, Sweet-heart better then I did before, for in your
ab<U+017F>ence I have found your di<U+017F>cretion and affection to me; I will therefore tru<U+017F>t you
with a thing that none but <hi>Ama<U+017F>is, Adamas,</hi> and my <U+017F>elf does know: then after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he began thus.</p>
                     <p>You know <hi>Leonide,</hi> that when this impudent villain was fir<U+017F>t at <hi>Savignea,</hi> my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as well as we, went to know of him the event of that voyage which <hi>Clidemant</hi>
my dear brother was to undertake. This Impo<U+017F>tor among<U+017F>t many other things told
her, that after he had gotten much honour and glory, he <U+017F>hould return <U+017F>afely and
with much contentment unto all: But on the contrary, we have received news from
<hi>Lindamore,</hi> that poor <hi>Clidemant</hi> is dead, and him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o wounded, as he is forced to
<U+017F>tay with the Queen <hi>Methina</hi> in the City of <hi>Rhemois.</hi> Oh Heavens Madam, (cryed
our <hi>Leonide</hi>) is <hi>Clidemant</hi> dead? Speak low, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Galathea,</hi> le<U+017F>t any <U+017F>hould hear
us: for it concerns us to keep it clo<U+017F>e for a while, unle<U+017F>s we would fall into the mo<U+017F>t
ba<U+017F>e Tyranny that is imaginable. I be<U+017F>eech you Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> what does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
you unto <U+017F>uch feares? And from whom do you expect <U+017F>uch in<U+017F>olence? From
him (an<U+017F>wered the Nymph) who did before plot how to deceive me, I mean <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas:</hi>
you mu<U+017F>t know that this arrogant wretch out of an incredible pre<U+017F>umption,
does not only plot how to marry me, as you heard from his own mouth, and from
<hi>Climanthes,</hi> but more, he intends to marry me though again<U+017F>t my will: and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to that, he hath plotted mo<U+017F>t damnable trea<U+017F>on both again<U+017F>t me and the State,
ayming to make him<U+017F>elf ma<U+017F>ter of us both at once; you heard of his actions again<U+017F>t
<hi>Damon,</hi> and we do under<U+017F>tand what great intelligence he holds with <hi>Gondebaut,</hi>
King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> without acquainting us: certainly his trea<U+017F>on had broken
out before now, were he not in fear of <hi>Clidemant;</hi> nothing el<U+017F>e re<U+017F>trains him: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<U+017F>is</hi>
hath therefore <U+017F>ent for <hi>Lindamore</hi> to return with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>te; and though I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53527:140"/>
a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf he will not fail, yet being <U+017F>o far off, we are full of many fears. We
<U+017F>ee how <hi>Polemas</hi> has all the Souldiers at his devotion, and my Mother thinking <U+017F>he
had done very well in it, has conferred upon him <U+017F>uch ample power, as he has the
means to oblige them all to be at his own beck, though again<U+017F>t us. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> in a great amazement, you have rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ay, that the<U+017F>e are things
of great importance; <U+017F>o great, as I believe, nothing can more neerly concern you.
Now Sweet-heart, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> this Traytor who is yet ignorant of <hi>Clidemants</hi>
death, hath cau<U+017F>ed him whom you call <hi>Climanthes,</hi> to come unto the <U+017F>ame place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
where he was before: for my part, I believe, it is to try if by <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
he can win upon my will to marry <hi>Polemas:</hi> and <hi>Adamas</hi> whom I believe you
acquainted with the knavery of this Impo<U+017F>tor, hath be<U+017F>eeched <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> to know
whether it be he or no, and if he prove the deceiver, to cau<U+017F>e him to be <U+017F>eized upon;
for it is probable that by him we <U+017F>hall know of all <hi>Polemas</hi> his plots: and <U+017F>ince he
tru<U+017F>ted him with his de<U+017F>ign upon me, he would not hide the re<U+017F>t of his de<U+017F>ign from
him. We were in the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas</hi> when this cour<U+017F>e was re<U+017F>olved upon; and I
had an extream de<U+017F>ire to have you with me, I <U+017F>aid that there was none who could
manage this matter better then your <U+017F>elf, who had <U+017F>o often talked with him. In the
mean time, we came hither, and do all that we can for our own <U+017F>afeties: but we are <U+017F>o
unprovided of all manner of defence, as we know not which way to turn our <U+017F>elves.
This, Sweet-heart, is the <U+017F>tate of our affairs, which when well con<U+017F>idered is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable;
for we have lo<U+017F>t <hi>Clidemant:</hi> all our be<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubjects are either dead with him,
or out of the Country; and we are almo<U+017F>t in the hands of an in<U+017F>olent fellow, who<U+017F>e
impudent ambition threatens us with intollerable <U+017F>ervitude.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, the Nymph could not withhold her tears, nor <hi>Leonide</hi> neither, who
after <U+017F>he had emptied her eyes and recollected her <U+017F>elf, did an<U+017F>wer thus: I mu<U+017F>t needs
confe<U+017F>s Madam, that of all trea<U+017F>ons this is the wor<U+017F>t, which being grounded upon
great ingratitude, it is to be hoped, Heaven will never let it arrive at the end of this
wicked mans de<U+017F>ires. The Gods are more ju<U+017F>t then to favour him in <U+017F>uch unju<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns,
and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee they will <U+017F>end us help in our nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity from <U+017F>uch means as
perhaps we lea<U+017F>t expected. Put all your confidence Madam, in God, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
your <U+017F>elf, that he will not fail you; be<U+017F>ides, your cau<U+017F>e is <U+017F>uch, that though there
was none but women to defend this place, I believe we are enough to keep it again<U+017F>t
all men alive: and for my part, I believe, that upon <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion I <U+017F>hould be
more valiant then <hi>Lindamore:</hi> but Madam, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ent for me, as thinking I
might be u<U+017F>efull unto you in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, what <U+017F>ervice is it you are plea<U+017F>ed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me? I would have you go, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi>) and <U+017F>ee whether this man be the
Impo<U+017F>tor or no: if he be the <U+017F>ame <hi>Climanthes,</hi> as I believe he is, I would have you
make him believe, that I have an extream de<U+017F>ire to confer with him upon a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
of great concernment; and if it be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, per<U+017F>wade him to come hither, and <U+017F>peak
with me here: if you can prevail <U+017F>o far, we <U+017F>hall keep him <U+017F>o as he <U+017F>hall not go out
when he will; if you cannot, becau<U+017F>e guilty per<U+017F>ons are always <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitious of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
appoint a day when I may be <U+017F>ure to find him there, for as you know, he
u<U+017F>eth to hide him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome dayes: and if we <U+017F>hould go unto him with a <U+017F>trong hand,
and he not be there, this would divulge our de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>o much, as we <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ever catching him.</p>
                     <p>After much other <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this, <hi>Galathea</hi> di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed <hi>Leonide</hi> unto her re<U+017F>t;
but calling her pre<U+017F>ently back again. I mu<U+017F>t needs know (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) what
character you give of your Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, &amp; how you have lived all this while of
your ab<U+017F>ence from me. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide,</hi> I can <U+017F>ay nothing of them but that
they are the faire<U+017F>t, the mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>creet and lovely women that ever I <U+017F>aw, and their
conver<U+017F>ation is <U+017F>uch, that who<U+017F>oever is weary of their company, is certainly of a
very ill humour: the golden age Madam, which men lived in long <U+017F>ince, and which is
<U+017F>o much envied by all that lived after them, could never enjoy <U+017F>o much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and plea<U+017F>ure as is to be found among<U+017F>t them. I profe<U+017F>s <hi>Leonide,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi>
you give them <U+017F>uch a character, as makes me wi<U+017F>h my <U+017F>elf a Shepherde<U+017F>s. Certainly
Madam, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> did you but once ta<U+017F>te tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>weets, and tranquility which
they enjoy, you would not de<U+017F>ire to leave them. And yet, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> they al<U+017F>o
have their di<U+017F>tempers and cares, and inquietudes; for when they lo<U+017F>t <hi>Celadon,</hi> did
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53527:141"/>
they not exceedingly re<U+017F>ent the lo<U+017F>s? It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> to be in the
world, and be exempt from paying the tributes of humanity: but I call them happy
and free from inquietude, when I compare our cares and theirs together: I know
not why you <U+017F>hould think theirs <U+017F>o little, replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> for I have heard <U+017F>ay that
when <hi>Celadon</hi> was lo<U+017F>t, not only <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> but all the Town made great lamentations.
Truly Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide,</hi> they had <U+017F>hewed them<U+017F>elves very in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible if the
lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>o well an accompli<U+017F>hed Shepherd had not moved them: I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my <U+017F>elf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Galathea</hi> very <U+017F>ubtilely, that as the lo<U+017F>s of him did fill them with <U+017F>orrow, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of him was as joyful unto them. <hi>Leonide</hi> knew the rea<U+017F>on why the Nymph
<U+017F>poke thus, and therefore <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered her very coldly, doubtle<U+017F>s, when they do
recover him, it will be abundance of joy unto them all; for that Shepherd was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
beloved of all that knew him: why (<U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea</hi>) is not <hi>Celadon</hi> yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto them? No Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Leonide,</hi> and now they hardly <U+017F>o much as think
upon him. Does not <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>peak of him? She does,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide,</hi> but never unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome other begin the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Why (<U+017F>aid the
Nymph) does <U+017F>he not love him <U+017F>till? Or has <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>ucceeded him in her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
Did <U+017F>he love him, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Leonide,</hi> <U+017F>he would love in vain, for every one
thinks him dead. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that if he were dead I <U+017F>hould exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lament him; for he was the fine<U+017F>t Shepherd of all his Country; and I mu<U+017F>t tell
you truly, the knavery of <hi>Climanthes</hi> did fir<U+017F>t move me to cheri<U+017F>h him, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
his own merits moved me much more: and <U+017F>ay what you will, I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
but <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> what face <U+017F>oever <U+017F>he <U+017F>et upon it, will have him in her heart, as long
as <U+017F>he lives; for I who am le<U+017F>s concerned then <U+017F>he, I cannot think upon him without
much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure. But, added <U+017F>he, it is late, retire your <U+017F>elf therefore; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you go to morrow with your companion <hi>Silvia,</hi> to <U+017F>ee whether yond man be
<hi>Climanthes,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other like him, for the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s does not a little concern us.</p>
                     <p>This was the fir<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which <hi>Galathea</hi> had with <hi>Leonide</hi> in private, of which
<U+017F>he was very glad; yet <U+017F>he perceived that <hi>Galathea</hi> was not <U+017F>o well cured of <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
as <U+017F>he made a <U+017F>hew of; and therefore <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved not to di<U+017F>cover or di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
any thing of that Shepherd, which might bring him into memory, knowing very
well, that a Candle newly extingui<U+017F>hed, will light it <U+017F>elf again even by the very <U+017F>moak.
But becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not fail in tho<U+017F>e commands which <U+017F>he had laid upon her, being
of <U+017F>uch great concernment, after <U+017F>he had conferred with her Uncle <hi>Adamas,</hi> <U+017F>he went
with her companion <hi>Silvia</hi> to make this di<U+017F>covery.</p>
                     <p>When they came fir<U+017F>t to the place, they made a doubt whether it was <hi>Climanthes</hi>
or no; for they found every thing <U+017F>o changed, as they hardly thought it to be the
<U+017F>ame place which formerly it was. Now was the place trimmed up very fine and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then before, with windows to give more light. This alteration did at the fir<U+017F>t
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h them; yet <U+017F>eeing the door <U+017F>hut, they re<U+017F>olved to knock and be better re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
They went up eight or ten <U+017F>teps higher unto the Temple then it was before:
and when they were at the top, through the windows which were on either <U+017F>ide the
door, they <U+017F>aw an Altar at the other end of the Temple, and before it, a man at
his prayers, but they could not know him, becau<U+017F>e his back was towards them. The
Cell being but little, they could hear what he prayed, <U+017F>o it is; Oh mo<U+017F>t Pui<U+017F><U+017F>ant
Deity, (<U+017F>aid he) I be<U+017F>eech thee for a <U+017F>ign from Heaven; and having repeated
the <U+017F>ame words thrice over in a loud voice, they <U+017F>aw the fire kindle upon the Altar
of it <U+017F>elf, as readily as it was wont to do at other times, which made the two Nymphs
believe him to be the <U+017F>ame Impo<U+017F>tor whom they looked for: and they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
for he having <U+017F>pied them afar off, he prepared him<U+017F>elf into this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e of
Sanctity: but they <U+017F>eeming not to have the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of his Artifice, they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
unto one another words of great admiration, in an audible voice; which he
hearing, did much rejoyce at it, believing that they did not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect his knavery; and
the more to delude them by his new jugling, he turned his head towards them at the
noi<U+017F>e which they made: and becau<U+017F>e they de<U+017F>ired to enter into the Temple and <U+017F>peak
with him, he took <U+017F>ome Holy Water and wa<U+017F>hed his eyes and his eares, becau<U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had both <U+017F>een and heard the<U+017F>e Nymphs whil<U+017F>t he was at his devotion; then throwing
<U+017F>ome Veruin, and a few leaves of Oak and Mi<U+017F>leto into the fire, he elevated his voice
and <U+017F>aid: If it be thy plea<U+017F>ure, Oh mo<U+017F>t omnipotent Deity, that they <U+017F>hall enter into

thy Sacred Temple, then open thou the doors and let them in. He had no <U+017F>ooner
uttered the<U+017F>e words, but the doors opened of them<U+017F>elves, though none touched
them, which made the two Nymphs to wonder <U+017F>o much, that though they knew the
fellow to be but a jugling knave, yet they could not chu<U+017F>e but be afraid; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they <U+017F>tood a while as if they doubted whether they <U+017F>hould enter or no; until he
him<U+017F>elf in his Sacerdotal robes, and with a face full of gravity, came to invite them,
<U+017F>ince it <U+017F>eemed to be the will of God they <U+017F>hould, by this particular <U+017F>ign of favour
unto them. <hi>Leonide</hi> and her companion being grown a little more confident, and
<U+017F>eeming to bear a great reverence unto him, they entred, and followed him as far as
the Altar, where kneeling down after the example of this Impo<U+017F>tor, they remained
in that po<U+017F>ture until he ro<U+017F>e up, and <U+017F>aid unto them; <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Silvia,</hi> the Deity of
the place whom I adore, is plea<U+017F>ed with your coming into this Holy Temple; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
adverti<U+017F>ed me of your coming, and commanded me to let you enter without puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
you either by perfumes or holy water, I could not chu<U+017F>e but be a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at it;
and therefore I asked of him an extraordinary <U+017F>ign of his will; upon which, the fire
did pre<U+017F>ently kindle of it <U+017F>elf. Then when you were come, I not being able to think
that you <U+017F>hould enter in this manner, I be<U+017F>eeched him to <U+017F>hew his plea<U+017F>ure by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the doors of the Temple unto you, which he mo<U+017F>t miraculou<U+017F>ly did, as you

were done by <U+017F>ome inchantment or witchcraft; and therefore they would needs go

them both by their arms, and <U+017F>aid, that <U+017F>ince the doors were <U+017F>hut by the will of God,

Ceremonies, lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven, and returned to the <U+017F>ame place
where he <U+017F>aw them when they fir<U+017F>t came: And becau<U+017F>e they were extreamly afraid

fir<U+017F>t that they had met with <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter: But when they related all that they had
<U+017F>een, and their fears at the opening and <U+017F>hutting of the doors, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e

him leave to <U+017F>tir out of tho<U+017F>e limits allotted to him: But for my part, I believe he

the prime Burgoma<U+017F>ters of the City of <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> and long <U+017F>ince made his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
asking therefore of the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, who was his <U+017F>on, what he had to <U+017F>ay, he
acquainted him with the arrival of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and the honour and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F><U+017F>es
which <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> did unto them; the care which both of them had
of him, and the opinion which the Chirurgions had of him: Afterwards he gave
him an accompt of all the Souldiers that were in the Town, in what manner the
Guards were placed, the little <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition that either <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> or <hi>Adamas</hi> had of any
attempts, and briefly a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, that he would open a gate of the Town unto
him when he plea<U+017F>ed: <hi>Polemas</hi> received this news with much joy; and after thanks
unto <hi>Merontes</hi> for his affection and fidelity, he conjured him to continue it, with
a<U+017F><U+017F>urance that he would one day recompence him to the full: That when time <U+017F>erved,
he would make u<U+017F>e of his offer, as from one whom he confided in, the mo<U+017F>t of any
man in the world: then fetching a bag of money which he kept always ready for a
recompence of <U+017F>ecret Intelligences; Here <U+017F>aid he unto him, take this as an earne<U+017F>t
of my good Will, and when occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>erves, I will do more for you: But pray tell
me (<U+017F>aid he unto the man) is there any News at Court? Sir (<U+017F>aid the young man)
all the talk is of a <hi>Druide</hi> who lives neer <hi>Mount Bri<U+017F>on</hi> in <U+017F>o much <U+017F>anctity, that the
Gods do grant unto him what<U+017F>oever he asks: I cannot relate all the <U+017F>tories that are
told of him, for they are <U+017F>o many, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange, as are incredible: His greate<U+017F>t
reputation did <U+017F>pring from a voyage which <hi>Leonide</hi> did make unto him, who reports
<U+017F>uch wonders of him, as does a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h all hearers: Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>)
what does <U+017F>he report to have <U+017F>een? Sir, an<U+017F>wered the man, <U+017F>he reports many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, of the Door of the Temple, which opens and <U+017F>huts of it
<U+017F>elf, at the very command of this holy Man. For my part Sir, I go but <U+017F>eldom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ca<U+017F>tle, and what I report, is only by hear-<U+017F>ay: But it is mo<U+017F>t certain, that
many <U+017F>trange wonders are reported of this holy per<U+017F>on. Well Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi>
Return unto your Father, tell him, I give him a thou<U+017F>and thanks for the News
which I have received by you, and <U+017F>hall one day be as forward in real recompence,
as I am now in my verbal thanks: De<U+017F>ire him to continue in his Affection and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but above all, I de<U+017F>ire both him and you to be <U+017F>ecret. Upon this, <hi>Polemas</hi>
di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger, and returned to <hi>Climanthes;</hi> who hearing what the man
reported of him, could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh at the opinion which the world conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him: And let me tell you (<U+017F>aid he) that it is beyond the reach of a Female <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
to find out the Art which I have u<U+017F>ed. Good <hi>Climanthes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech
you tell me how you kindled the Fire upon your Altar, and how the Doors
did open and <U+017F>hut of them<U+017F>elves at <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>tance from you; for I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I do
not under<U+017F>tand how you can do it. The truth is, Sir, <U+017F>aid <hi>Climanthes,</hi> the<U+017F>e Arts,
like all tricks of Legerdemain, are not to be under<U+017F>tood by words, as they may be
mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ily by <U+017F>ight and demon<U+017F>tration; for I have ordered my Engines in <U+017F>uch a
manner, as words cannot de<U+017F>cribe them; but be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, they are the ea<U+017F>ie<U+017F>t things
in the world to be under<U+017F>tood when they are once <U+017F>een. I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay, replyed
<hi>Polemas,</hi> that <hi>Climanthes</hi> is a Ma<U+017F>ter in his Art, and now I am fully per<U+017F>waded that
the<U+017F>e Women are deceived by it: But dear friend, <U+017F>aid he, and embraced him, how
do you think our De<U+017F>igne will take? Doubtle<U+017F>s Sir, <U+017F>aid he, as well as we can wi<U+017F>h;
for though the event of future things be uncertain, yet take it upon my word, a
happy beginning is mo<U+017F>t commonly <U+017F>econded by a happy end; and I am certain you
cannot de<U+017F>ire a more happy beginning then we have had. Within this Country all
is your own; and out of it, there is not one Prince nor Neighbour who does not
love and favour you: All tho<U+017F>e that can any ways hinder you, are at a far di<U+017F>tance
from you, and <U+017F>o employed in the affairs of others, that they give you time enough
to tran<U+017F>act ours; The be<U+017F>t of it is, <hi>Clidemant</hi> who is the only mote in your eye, he
is <U+017F>o engaged in the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of a Prince <U+017F>o far di<U+017F>tant from us, that any relief from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53527:143"/>
him is not to be feared; whereas your Confederates and Allies, are at hand, <U+017F>o as we
<U+017F>hall meet with no oppo<U+017F>ition, unle<U+017F>s from a Company of weak women, who though
very potent in Wars of Love, yet are they but pitifully weak in the Wars of <hi>Mars.</hi>
But you mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider, replied <hi>Polemas,</hi> that <hi>Adamas</hi> who<U+017F>e good will, will never
be gained, is a very con<U+017F>iderable enemy, by rea<U+017F>on of the credit and reputation that
he has in this Country; the authority of <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and the aver<U+017F>e di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi>
will be great hindrances unto us. Pray Sir con<U+017F>ider, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Climanthes,</hi>
that every thing will act according to its own nature: <hi>Adamas</hi> may hurt you in
words, but not in deeds; take but Arms, and all his books are not worth a ru<U+017F>h. As
for <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o affectionate unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> as <U+017F>he will not cro<U+017F>s her in any
thing <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire: there is the greate<U+017F>t difficulty, replied <hi>Polemas,</hi> for <hi>Galathea</hi>
is young, and has no con<U+017F>ideration of the States tranquility, but all her de<U+017F>ignes
and inclinations, are cro<U+017F>s and aver<U+017F>e unto mine. How know you that? replied
<hi>Climanthes,</hi> perhaps <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ires it as much as you, but knows not how to bring it
about: I pray tell me, Has <U+017F>he not formerly loved you? True, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Polemas,</hi>
but <hi>Lindamore</hi> has <U+017F>toln her affection from me: Pray Sir con<U+017F>ider, <U+017F>aid <hi>Climanthes,</hi>
that what was once, may be again. The Nature of a woman, e<U+017F>pecially of a young
one, is very wavering; catches at every object of novelty that plea<U+017F>eth the eyes, and
fixes <U+017F>olidly upon none, her mind is like a Ship at Sea without any Anchor or <U+017F>tay,
which flotes as every wind plea<U+017F>eth. Now if we may be conjectures gue<U+017F><U+017F>e all things
hidden, I mu<U+017F>t needs think <U+017F>he is fully intended to ob<U+017F>erve what<U+017F>oever I <U+017F>hall bid
her; why el<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he <U+017F>end <hi>Leonide</hi> unto me, to de<U+017F>ire that I <U+017F>hould come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
unto her? I am either extreamly mi<U+017F>taken, or el<U+017F>e I <U+017F>ee her heart infinitely
impatient to <U+017F>ee me, with intentions to put her <U+017F>elf wholly into my hands; a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
your <U+017F>elf, that I gave her a very hot allarm, when I told her that if <U+017F>he married any
but him whom the Gods had appointed for her, <U+017F>he would be the mo<U+017F>t unhappy
woman alive. But <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover your <U+017F>ubtilty? But
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Climanthes</hi>) the sky <U+017F>hould fall? There is as much likelyhood of the
one as of the other: I would have you to know, that <hi>Climanthes</hi> is <U+017F>uch a Ma<U+017F>ter in
his Art, that if he would attempt to make <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> marry him, he could bring it to
pa<U+017F>s. <hi>Polemas</hi> laughed and <U+017F>aid, I wi<U+017F>h with all my heart that I were a witne<U+017F>s of
your marriage with her, and you of mine with <hi>Galathea.</hi> No, no, <U+017F>aid <hi>Climanthes,</hi>
I would be contented with <hi>Leonide,</hi> Oh my dear friend (<U+017F>aid <hi>Polemas</hi>) when I do
marry <hi>Galathea,</hi> I will promi<U+017F>e you <hi>Leonide:</hi> and I promi<U+017F>e you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Climanthes,</hi>
that I will give you <hi>Galathea</hi> within a few dayes, or el<U+017F>e I will lo<U+017F>e my life. Upon
this the que<U+017F>tion grew, whether he <U+017F>hould make <hi>Galathea</hi> come unto him, or he go
unto her; at la<U+017F>t it was concluded better for him to go unto her, becau<U+017F>e in making
her come into the Temple it was to be feared, le<U+017F>t his tricks in opening and <U+017F>hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the doors, might <U+017F>ome way or other mi<U+017F>carry or be di<U+017F>covered, and then the
whole plot was <U+017F>poiled: be<U+017F>ides, tho<U+017F>e things that are taken for wonders at the fir<U+017F>t,
and admired, do grow <U+017F>tale by often u<U+017F>ing, and <U+017F>corned: Moreover, <U+017F>ince this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and <U+017F>hutting is believed to be the Act of God, it will be thought <U+017F>trange that
this God can do nothing but <U+017F>till one and the <U+017F>ame things. But by going to the
Palace, all the<U+017F>e things are not to be expected, and nothing is to be done but tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with her. Upon this they parted full of hopes to arrive ere long at their de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ends.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Polemas</hi> who was a man of a <U+017F>harp wit, and a <U+017F>ound judgment, and a <U+017F>pirit
<U+017F>well'd with ambition, although he <U+017F>eemed to rely wholy upon the skil of <hi>Climanthes,</hi>
yet he neglected nothing which might bring his enterpri<U+017F>e to pa<U+017F>s; and though he
had <U+017F>ome hopes in the <U+017F>ubtilty of this fellow, yet he followed his other bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s very
clo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o that if the <U+017F>ubtilty of the one failed, the force of the other might effect it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
the Souldiers of that Province, he had entertained many others, both within
and without the State: He had made him<U+017F>elf ma<U+017F>ter of all the <U+017F>trong places, brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and pa<U+017F><U+017F>es; and not to do any thing at random, there was neither King nor
Prince his Neighbour, with whom he had not clo<U+017F>e intelligence, and promi<U+017F>e of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
in ca<U+017F>e of need; he provided him<U+017F>elf of a va<U+017F>t Magazine of Arms, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Amunition. And becau<U+017F>e the whole management of all the<U+017F>e corre<U+017F>ponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and the whole enterpri<U+017F>e re<U+017F>ted upon him<U+017F>elf, he made choi<U+017F>e of four men
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53527:143"/>
whom he imployed in things particular: the<U+017F>e four confidents whom he relied upon,
were the four pillars of all his hopes and fortune; the name of the one was <hi>Pelidon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
unto whom he committed the charge of his Cavalry: another was called <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi>
unto whom he committed his Infantry; <hi>Li<U+017F>trandes</hi> had the command of the
Artillery, and Engines; and <hi>Ligonias</hi> of the Amunition and victual. The<U+017F>e four
were acquainted with the de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Polemas,</hi> and had long <U+017F>ince contracted a league,
and linked their fortunes and lives together. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Climanthes</hi> was gone, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas</hi>
called for them, and asked them particularly, how many men he might build
upon, if within the compa<U+017F>s of eight or ten dayes he <U+017F>hould have occa<U+017F>ion to imploy
them? <hi>Pelidontes</hi> promi<U+017F>ed him fifteen hundred hor<U+017F>e, and be<U+017F>ides all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Country, two thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>trangers: <hi>Argonides</hi> promi<U+017F>ed twelve thou<U+017F>and
Pikes, Archers, Slingers, and Cro<U+017F>s-bows, and <U+017F>ix thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>trangers: <hi>Ligonias</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ed
victual for four months: and <hi>Li<U+017F>trandes</hi> promi<U+017F>ed as many Arms of all <U+017F>orts as
they <U+017F>hould need: now my friends, <U+017F>aid he and embraced them, my hopes are all
in you; I do wholly rely upon you, and know that you will have as great a care of
my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, as I my <U+017F>elf can have; perhaps we <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>tand in need of all the<U+017F>e
preparations, I hope Heaven will bring our enterpri<U+017F>e to pa<U+017F>s by fair means, and
not by force. I de<U+017F>ire it may be <U+017F>o, as well for the good of the State, as becau<U+017F>e that
way <U+017F>eems every way the better. However, all preparations mo<U+017F>t go forward, for I
am re<U+017F>olved, within eight dayes to be either <hi>Ca<U+017F>ar</hi> or nothing; I be<U+017F>eech you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and conjure you to have a great care of every thing under your particular
charges, that they may be in readine<U+017F>s when we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>tand in need of them. Thus
with abundance of good language, and a thou<U+017F>and large promi<U+017F>es, they parted;
and hoped to <U+017F>ee the day when he <U+017F>hould be able to make them all good.</p>
                     <p>But whil<U+017F>t the mind of <hi>Polemas</hi> thus boyled over with ambition, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was ready to break out into a flame: Love <U+017F>till boyled as fa<U+017F>t as ambition, for it
gave no re<U+017F>t unto <hi>Celadon</hi> whom <hi>Leonide</hi> left in the habit of <hi>Alexis,</hi> and in the hou<U+017F>e
of <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> who with all her Companions could not know him to be <hi>Celadon,</hi> <U+017F>o
well was he di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed: But the wonder is, that neither <hi>Licidas,</hi> nor any of his neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
kindred or intimate friends <U+017F>hould have the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of him; and that was
the rea<U+017F>on why <hi>Phoceon,</hi> when <hi>Adamas</hi> brought her into his hou<U+017F>e, did lodg her
in the Chamber where <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was wont to lie: and indeed that Fair Shepherde<U+017F>s
and her Companion <hi>Phillis,</hi> when <hi>Leonide</hi> was gone unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> did endeavour
to <U+017F>leep, that they might let this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide</hi> take <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>t, whom they <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed
to be not well. But this new, or indeed old affection renewed, which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
bore unto this Shepherd, believing him a woman, and her re<U+017F>olution to follow her
unto <hi>Carnutes,</hi> and con<U+017F>ecrate the remainder of her dayes unto <hi>Tautates,</hi> did <U+017F>o po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e
her mind, that <U+017F>he could not entertain any thought or imagination, but what
proceeded from them and that de<U+017F>ire. <hi>Phillis</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, who knew how the
Fair and Wi<U+017F>e <hi>Diana</hi> was perplexed ever <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>ubtile <hi>Laonices</hi> invention again<U+017F>t
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> <U+017F>he bad deffiance unto any re<U+017F>t till <U+017F>he went unto her to comfort her in
her grief, knowing very well by <U+017F>ad experience, what it was to be troubled with the
panges of jealou<U+017F>ie. <hi>Celadon</hi> who lay in the <U+017F>ame Chamber with the<U+017F>e Fair Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>es,
had his enquietudes as well as they, and took as little re<U+017F>t; for calling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his memory how <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had formerly appointed him never to <U+017F>ee her until by
her command; when he con<U+017F>idered his re<U+017F>olution to ob<U+017F>erve this ordinance mo<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiou<U+017F>ly,
and thought upon the rea<U+017F>ons which the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Adamas</hi> u<U+017F>ed to make him
quit that <U+017F>olitary kind of life, which he had begun when he reflected upon the artifice
which <hi>Leonide</hi> and the <hi>Druide</hi> u<U+017F>ed to bring him, not only into his own Town, and
among<U+017F>t his kindred, but al<U+017F>o into the very hou<U+017F>e of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and leave him alone
with her; the<U+017F>e thoughts did <U+017F>o imbroyl the imagination of this poor Shepherd, that
he knew not what Councel, or what re<U+017F>olution to take; for though he had the <U+017F>ame
thoughts in his mind before, yet the <U+017F>everal rea<U+017F>on and arguments of the Nymph,
and the <hi>Druide,</hi> did help him to di<U+017F>ge<U+017F>t them; but now when he was all alone, he
thought him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>urrounded with a thou<U+017F>and dangers, and without all humane help
or comfort. He con<U+017F>idered that now he was among<U+017F>t abundance of his familiar
and intimate acquaintance, and that it was a thing almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
long from them: and though the prudence of the great <hi>Druide Adamas,</hi> who
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53527:144"/>
did acknowledge him for his Daughter, did ca<U+017F>t a mi<U+017F>t before the eyes of tho<U+017F>e that
were the mo<U+017F>t clear <U+017F>ighted, and much authorize his di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e; yet he knew very
well, that tho<U+017F>e eyes which he was to deceive, were <U+017F>o quick <U+017F>ighted, that if any of
his actions or words <U+017F>hould betray him, he was <U+017F>ure his di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
di<U+017F>covered: Upon this con<U+017F>ideration, he bethought him<U+017F>elf how prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant he was to <U+017F>eem of knowing any thing which related unto the quality of a
Shepherd, how <U+017F>imple he was to <U+017F>eem in their way of life, their exerci<U+017F>es, and how
unacquainted he was to be with all his friends, kinred, acquaintances, and places, he
thought this a task impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be undertaken; and though he did all he could,
yet the face of <hi>Alexis</hi> was <U+017F>o very like unto that of <hi>Celadon,</hi> all her words, actions,
and ge<U+017F>tures were <U+017F>o re<U+017F>emblant unto that <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed lo<U+017F>t Shepherd, as doubtle<U+017F>s he
<U+017F>hould be known in <U+017F>pite of all his di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations and di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ements. But his harde<U+017F>t
task was, to rule and check a mo<U+017F>t domineering pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which amid<U+017F>t his greate<U+017F>t
felicities, would not give his <U+017F>oul leave to enjoy any full contentment. How oft did
he command his tongue and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ds not to take too much liberty unto them<U+017F>elves, le<U+017F>t
they <U+017F>hould betray him<U+017F>elf to be <hi>Celadon?</hi> How oft did he turn away his eye from
many Beauties which under the notion of <hi>Alexis</hi> were permitted unto him; and all,
le<U+017F>t his too much curio<U+017F>ity <U+017F>hould bring him into <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion.</p>
                     <p>After all the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations had long embroyled his mind, and the more he
thought upon them, the more <hi>Hydras</hi> of difficulties he found, the be<U+017F>t coun<U+017F>el he
could think upon, was, to re<U+017F>olve to <U+017F>tay in that place as little as he could, knowing
it to be a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>tay, and not be known, and that the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t foot may
<U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>tumble; but this re<U+017F>olution he thought to be as full of difficulties in the
execution, and therefore he re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay <U+017F>till in that place: Upon which he began
to think how he <U+017F>hould employ him<U+017F>elf; and he conceived that he could no way
better <U+017F>pend his time, then in <U+017F>till engaging that Shepherde<U+017F>s unto a <U+017F>tronger league
of amity, thinking very rationally, that if <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould afterwards come to know him,
<U+017F>he would not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon con<U+017F>ent unto a <U+017F>econd Bani<U+017F>hment. And becau<U+017F>e he knew
that we are much led by the examples of tho<U+017F>e whom we e<U+017F>teem, and <U+017F>hall after them
do tho<U+017F>e things which otherwi<U+017F>e we <U+017F>hould never con<U+017F>ent unto, he intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>s
a love unto her; not <U+017F>uch a kinde of love as one woman u<U+017F>eth to expre<U+017F>s unto
another, but <U+017F>uch a one as <hi>Celadon</hi> was wont to expre<U+017F>s unto <hi>Astrea,</hi> and thus by
his example to draw her unto the like affection, and <U+017F>o in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly to bring her from
Friend<U+017F>hip unto Love. But when he was to put this thought in execution, he found
abundance of more difficulty in acting, then in propounding it; it being a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to expre<U+017F>s love unto that Shepherde<U+017F>s, and not make her to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect it to be more
then became a Virgin <hi>Druide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This chaos and confu<U+017F>ion of difficulties did <U+017F>o di<U+017F>temper him, that he could not
chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>igh very oft, and <U+017F>o loud, that the two Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es could not chu<U+017F>e
but hear him; for they did not <U+017F>leep, only <U+017F>eemed as if they did, becau<U+017F>e they would
not di<U+017F>turb the re<U+017F>t of <hi>Alexis.</hi> But hearing her to <U+017F>igh <U+017F>o exceedingly, and knowing
her to be awake, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> feared, that though <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid that <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>ick, only as a
colour for <U+017F>taying with her, yet I <U+017F>ay <U+017F>he feared le<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome real di<U+017F>temper <U+017F>hould be
the cau<U+017F>e of <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ighs. This doubt cau<U+017F>ed her to turn towards <hi>Phillis,</hi> whom
<U+017F>he knew was awake: Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he in as low a voice as <U+017F>he could) do you not hear
<hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>igh? I am afraid that <U+017F>he is wor<U+017F>e then <U+017F>he will tell unto us. I heard her
<U+017F>igh <U+017F>everal times (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) and I had the <U+017F>ame conceipt, but me-thought they
were <U+017F>ighs of one that was rather full of cares, then of one that was <U+017F>ick: For <U+017F>ighs
of a <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>on are fetched from the brea<U+017F>t with more violence, and tho<U+017F>e which I
hear, are but <U+017F>ilent whi<U+017F>pering <U+017F>ighs, <U+017F>uch as proceed from pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion and di<U+017F>temper of
mind. I think, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that we <U+017F>hould do well if we diverted her from <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ad
thoughts, and yet if <U+017F>he be a<U+017F>leep, we <U+017F>hould not waken her. Certainly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi>
<U+017F>he is not a<U+017F>leep, for <U+017F>he has turned her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>everal times, but perhaps <U+017F>he is <U+017F>ilent
upon the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on that we are, I mean, le<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>turb each other. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
being very impatient to <U+017F>ee whether it was <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he opened her curtain and peeped out;
but <U+017F>he could not do it <U+017F>o <U+017F>oftly, but <hi>Alexis</hi> ob<U+017F>erved her, who for all his confu<U+017F>ed
thoughts, had his eye and his heart towards her, and who had not lain <U+017F>o long in
bed, but only to make <hi>Phillis</hi> believe her <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s was real. <hi>Astrea</hi> perceiving that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53527:144"/>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> was not a<U+017F>leep, Madam (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) we are much afraid you are very
ill, for we have heard you complain very much <U+017F>ince <hi>Leonide</hi> wakened you. I thank
you heartily, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> for your care of me, which were I wor<U+017F>e then I am,
would make me well again: yet truly I am not very well, and therefore I de<U+017F>ire not
to <U+017F>tir out of the chamber this morning, but will try whether a little head-ach will be
cured with a little re<U+017F>t. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I have heard <U+017F>ay that <U+017F>leep is the be<U+017F>t

but I could not per<U+017F>wade my eyes together, becau<U+017F>e many odd thoughts came into
my mind, <U+017F>o as I think the be<U+017F>t way will be to divert it by di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; for I have heard
<U+017F>ay, that pain will away when it is lea<U+017F>t thought upon. What then <U+017F>hall we do, <U+017F>aid
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> to make you forget your pain? I de<U+017F>ire, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> that you will

Madam (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) we will do any thing in the world to obey you: upon this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing

to dre<U+017F>s her <U+017F>elf that day in the habit of a <hi>Druide,</hi> <U+017F>he claimed her promi<U+017F>e. Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart

of a <hi>Druide</hi> this day, it would be a very great content unto me. Oh Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<U+017F>he, you would never pardon me, if I <U+017F>hould commit <U+017F>o gro<U+017F>s a crime: Indeed
it is too much pre<U+017F>umption for a <U+017F>illy Shepherde<U+017F>s. It may be <U+017F>o, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi>
for a <U+017F>illy Shepherde<U+017F>s, but not for <U+017F>uch a Shepherde<U+017F>s as <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> is, who<U+017F>e merits,
beauty, and perfections does tran<U+017F>cend all the <hi>Druides</hi> that I do know; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you will oblige me, lay all <U+017F>uch con<U+017F>iderations a<U+017F>ide: for the love of you I
was a Shepherde<U+017F>s, and will be <U+017F>o as long as you plea<U+017F>e; why then for the love of me

I cannot wi<U+017F>h for any addition unto my happine<U+017F>s, further then the continuance of

dominion over my Will, or can hinder me from dedicating my <U+017F>elf unto that cour<U+017F>e
which the very Laws of Nature do oblige all Humanes unto? Upon this ground I
do but laugh at the preten<U+017F>ions of <hi>Calidon,</hi> who thinks me his own already, becau<U+017F>e

much zeal as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly you can, that we may never part as long as we live; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured it <U+017F>hall be long only of your <U+017F>elf, if ever we <U+017F>eparate: But my fear
is, that when I tell you what is to be done, your mind will change, and your de<U+017F>ign
alter. Oh Madam cried out <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you wrong me not <U+017F>o far, as to have
<U+017F>uch a thought. But on the contrary, be mo<U+017F>t certainly a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd, that both in life and
death this re<U+017F>olution will continue in me. I am apt to believe (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis</hi>)
any thing that you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay, e<U+017F>pecially a thing which is <U+017F>o advantagious unto my
<U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>utable to my de<U+017F>ires; believe it therefore that I will do all I can to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your de<U+017F>ires. Know Shepherde<U+017F>s that there is no great difficulty in bringing
your de<U+017F>ire to pa<U+017F>s, if you will your <U+017F>elf; and in this I am contrary to the opinion of
<hi>Leonide.</hi> The<U+017F>e two things, I <U+017F>hall only require from you; the one is, that you do
love me, as well as I do you: and I <U+017F>hall tell you the other, when I <U+017F>ee you have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
this fir<U+017F>t propo<U+017F>ition. <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> with a <U+017F>miling look, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed the hand of <hi>Alexis,</hi>
by way of thanks: If your <U+017F>econd propo<U+017F>ition (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) be no harder then your
fir<U+017F>t, you have good rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ay Madam, that there is no great difficulty in the
matter. For I be<U+017F>eech you, give me leave to <U+017F>wear, that if I do not Love the Fair
<hi>Alexis</hi> far above my own <U+017F>elf, nay better then ever any per<U+017F>on loved another, then
let the Gods deny me the honour of your favour, and bla<U+017F>t all my hopes of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment:
Oh <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> do you think for all this, that you love me
more then I Love you? Oh Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I cannot think my <U+017F>elf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of <U+017F>o much affection from you; but <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf infinitely happy if I were
<U+017F>ure that mine to you were accepted: Faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F>s, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> be a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that never Love did equal mine unto you; and in this, I cannot be deceived as
you may, becau<U+017F>e I know what I <U+017F>ay by experience; for I think I told you, how
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53527:145"/>
formerly I did Love one of my fellow Virgins, and I am confident it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible
for any humane to equal my affection to her; but when I do compare my affection
unto her, and my affection unto you together, I find that they hold no compari<U+017F>on,
for mine unto you do infinitely tran<U+017F>cend that unto her. Whereas you on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
who never Loved any, you may ea<U+017F>ily be mi<U+017F>taken, and think your Love great
when it is not <U+017F>o, for you want experience. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> the di<U+017F>pute
betwixt us is of <U+017F>uch a nature, that the victory is prejudicial to the Conqueror; and
the conquered is victorious: and yet I will not throw away my Arms upon very ea<U+017F>ie
terms, though I will yeild unto you in what you plea<U+017F>e, but it would be a mo<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<U+017F>hame unto me, if I <U+017F>hould let you out<U+017F>trip me in affection as you do in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Give me leave Madam therefore to tell you, that I began to Love when I was
even in my Cradle, and have continued that affection <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tantly, that no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
no time, no ab<U+017F>ences, no commands of tho<U+017F>e that had the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me, nor
any thing under Heaven could divert me from it, but death only: and yet I <U+017F>wear,
and <U+017F>wear mo<U+017F>t truly, that I do Love you better then ever I loved any; and though
this be but a proud word to i<U+017F><U+017F>ue from the mouth of a poor Shepherde<U+017F>s, yet give
me leave to pronounce it, and <U+017F>ay again, that though others may bear a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect,
yet never any more Love and more Affection, then <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> unto the Fair <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis.</hi>
Upon this, they embraced each other with <U+017F>uch mutual expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of Love,
that if <hi>Alexis</hi> dur<U+017F>t, but have <U+017F>aid I am <hi>Celadon,</hi> nothing could have made them
both more happy in each other. But the feares of this <hi>Druide,</hi> did make her reli<U+017F>h
all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>weet imbraces with a kind of bitter among<U+017F>t them, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>till feared
le<U+017F>t her raptures of joy <U+017F>hould make her di<U+017F>cover her <U+017F>elf; and therefore <U+017F>he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
her <U+017F>elf a little with a blu<U+017F>hing collour which came into her cheeks; and after
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>tood a while <U+017F>ilent, <U+017F>he uttered the<U+017F>e words with <U+017F>uch a mode<U+017F>t <U+017F>hamefa<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
that if any of her actions had rai<U+017F>ed any doubts of what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to hide, it
was enough to clear them all. But faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) I cannot
tell, what the violence of my affection to you, may make you think of me, unle<U+017F>s yours
and your goodne<U+017F>s plead me excu<U+017F>e: and yet I do <U+017F>wear unto you by <hi>Ve<U+017F>ta,</hi> and all
that is <U+017F>acred, that I am <U+017F>o far from any <U+017F>uch affections as many women of my age
are apt unto, that I did never love any man: but all my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions were wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in my love of one woman, whom truly I did love as much as I was then able,
though not comparable unto you now; and though perhaps you may laugh at my
humour, yet I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that I took as great delight in ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing and care<U+017F><U+017F>ing of
her, as if I had been a man, or <U+017F>he not a woman. And indeed I find the very <U+017F>ame
humour to revive in me when I am with you, which I can attribute unto nothing but
the exce<U+017F>s of my affection which I bear unto you, and which I <U+017F>hould be infinitely
<U+017F>orry if it were di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing or trouble<U+017F>ome unto you: <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>hewing by her
countenance, how well <U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed with the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, did return this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer;
It is my part Madam, to u<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame excu<U+017F>es unto you, <U+017F>ince I have more
rea<U+017F>on to fear being trouble<U+017F>ome unto you, by following the inclination of my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
too far: I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s Madam, that I did Love a Shepherd; but let me
tell you truly, that I was never more joyed at any te<U+017F>timonies of his good will unto
me, then I am of yours.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heaven! (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) how much am I obliged unto it, and you, for this
affection: my joyes and my <U+017F>atisfaction is compleat. But Faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he) <U+017F>hall we live together, in the <U+017F>ame freedom and affection when we are together
in private, that we do now? I <U+017F>ay in private; for it is fit to be more re<U+017F>erved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
other Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, lea<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould give occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect us
of <U+017F>omthing which may be di<U+017F>advantagious unto us. How? Madam, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Astrea</hi>)
do you ask me this que<U+017F>tion? Nay, may you not better ask whether I <U+017F>hould not die
for <U+017F>orrow, if you <U+017F>hould forbid me? But Madam, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ee I have ob<U+017F>erved
your fir<U+017F>t command, I be<U+017F>eech you what is the other? That by obeying it al<U+017F>o, I
may call my <U+017F>elf the wo<U+017F>t happy woman alive. Faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F>s, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi>)
it is not yet time to tell it; but <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee you are de<U+017F>irous to know it, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
you, that when I think it fitting that you <U+017F>hould know it, I will not put you to
the trouble of asking me. In the mean time, to try whether this kind of life will be
as agreeable unto us as we imagine, let us begin to live together as we mu<U+017F>t do all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53527:146"/>
the re<U+017F>t of our dayes; I mean, with that hone<U+017F>t freedom and liberty that two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Lovers ought to u<U+017F>e unto each other. In the fir<U+017F>t place I be<U+017F>eech you, let us
leave off in our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, the<U+017F>e terms of Madam, and <hi>Druide,</hi> and begin to be free
and familiar, as we mu<U+017F>t for ever be. Madam, (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) in what place <U+017F>oever I
be, and of what quality <U+017F>oever I am, I will alwayes render unto you, tho<U+017F>e re<U+017F>pects
which I am bound to pay; that will not be any hindrance to tho<U+017F>e contentments
which I hope for from you, but rather further them by keeping my <U+017F>elf within the
terms of my duty. You are mi<U+017F>taken, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> and though you can have
<U+017F>o much power over your <U+017F>elf, yet I cannot; for I am not able to endure that one
whom I take to be my other <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch words as <U+017F>peak any difference
betwixt us: and if the principal con<U+017F>equence of Love be union, why <U+017F>hould we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<U+017F>uch Tyrannies di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, under the names of re<U+017F>pect, or civility, or duty, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that perfect union of wills, which ought to be betwixt us? I do ordain therefore
that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>hall be <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>hall be <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and that we bani<U+017F>h from
among<U+017F>t us, not only all words, but al<U+017F>o all manner of actions that may put any
difference between us, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee that when we have lived long in this mutual
freedom and liberty, Love wil double and <U+017F>till encrea<U+017F>e. Then Madam, replied <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea,</hi>
I be<U+017F>eech you let it be under the notion of a command, that my obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it may excu<U+017F>e the fault which I <U+017F>hall commit in it. If that be all (an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi>)
to <U+017F>atisfie you, I do command it, with a promi<U+017F>e that I will not repent it as
long as I live. And becau<U+017F>e it is fit we conform our <U+017F>elves unto the cu<U+017F>toms of tho<U+017F>e
with whom we are to live: know therefore Shepherde<U+017F>s that it is the cu<U+017F>tom of the
<hi>Druides</hi> at <hi>Carnutes,</hi> not to call them<U+017F>elves by their proper names, but by
others, which their affection unto one another makes them invent; and their new
names are called among<U+017F>t them, <hi>Alliances,</hi> as much as to <U+017F>ay that they are Allied
and obliged by tho<U+017F>e names unto more Affection and Love. I conceive it requi<U+017F>ite
we do the like as well to confirm our Loves, as to let tho<U+017F>e <hi>Druides</hi> <U+017F>ee when we
come among<U+017F>t them, that we do not only know their cu<U+017F>toms, but mo<U+017F>t religiou<U+017F>ly
ob<U+017F>erve them: now I cannot think of any which are fitter for us then the names of
Mi<U+017F>tris and Servant, as well becau<U+017F>e they are names not ordinary among<U+017F>t them, as
becau<U+017F>e me thinks they <U+017F>ound well betwixt you and me. I do accept of this honour,
<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> with a thou<U+017F>and thanks, and with a prote<U+017F>tation and vow unto the
Godde<U+017F>s <hi>Vesta,</hi> that for ever, not only in name but in deed I will take you for my
Mi<U+017F>tris, and profe<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf your <U+017F>ervant. <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>miled at this, I had rather, <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he, that you would take the name of Mi<U+017F>tris, and let me have that of <U+017F>ervant: but
<U+017F>ince you have made your choi<U+017F>e, I am contented: Now Servant (continued <U+017F>he)
give me your hand, in te<U+017F>timony that you accept of this name, and that you will
never break this alliance of Love which we now make; and I <U+017F>wear by the Great
God of Love, who is the God that is adored at <hi>Carnutes,</hi> that I will eternally live
with you as with the only per<U+017F>on whom I perfectly Love, and of whom only I de<U+017F>ire
to be Loved in the like manner. Then <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>aid, I do not only give my hand,
but both hands, nay more, my heart and my <U+017F>oul, in te<U+017F>timony, that I will love you
and you only, con<U+017F>ecrating and dedicating my <U+017F>elf, my de<U+017F>ires, my affections, and
all that is mine unto you: and if ever I fail in the ob<U+017F>ervance of this promi<U+017F>e, or
ever <U+017F>tain that honourable Name which I have received, let me be abhorred by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, and all that is in them. Upon this they both embraced and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed
each other, as an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of what they had promi<U+017F>ed; and carra<U+017F><U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves
with <U+017F>o much affection as if they would never have ended.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Phillis</hi> went unto <hi>Diana,</hi> thinking to find her in bed, but that
Shepherde<U+017F>s was <U+017F>o very ill plea<U+017F>ed, that <U+017F>he could not re<U+017F>t <U+017F>o long; for <U+017F>he was up
long before, and after <U+017F>he had put all things into order in her little hou<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he went
out with her flock, and without any other company but her own thoughts. By
fortune, <U+017F>he came unto the <U+017F>ame place upon the Banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> when the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of <hi>Celadon</hi> did happen, when the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> made him throw him<U+017F>elf
into the River. After <U+017F>he had <U+017F>eated her <U+017F>elf, and long looked upon the current of
the water, without any other action which <U+017F>hewed life, but only <U+017F>ighing; at la<U+017F>t,
as if <U+017F>he had revived out of a profound Lethargy, and <U+017F>ending forth a deep <U+017F>igh.
Thus (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) does all things mortal, run into the Gulf of Oblivion: then <U+017F>top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53527:146"/>
a while, <U+017F>he broke out thus. This River is not the <U+017F>ame water it was ye<U+017F>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
for it glides away, and fre<U+017F>h comes in the room of it; nay I my <U+017F>elf am not the
<U+017F>ame <hi>Diana</hi> that I was when I came hither: time by an uncontrollable power runs
on and drives all before it. The Sun it <U+017F>elf, which is the mea<U+017F>ure of time as all things
in the univer<U+017F>e is, is hurried on by time, and is not the <U+017F>ame it was when I began to
<U+017F>peak: why then <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>houlde<U+017F>t thou think an ordinary thing to be <U+017F>trange and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary?
Every thing changes, and rechanges again: If it be a generall Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
all things, that nature produceth to change, why <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t thou wonder that
one particular per<U+017F>on <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>o? It is very unrea<U+017F>onable to ob<U+017F>erve it in thy <U+017F>elf,
and not allow it in another: can<U+017F>t thou <U+017F>ay that it is not thy <U+017F>elf which doth change,
but art the <U+017F>ame thou wert wont to be? Ah fond flatterer of thy <U+017F>elf, remember what
thou wert before <hi>Fiiander</hi> <U+017F>aw thee, what operation his Court<U+017F>hip had upon thee?
and how thou did<U+017F>t behave thy <U+017F>elf after his deplorable lo<U+017F>s. Con<U+017F>ider thy humour
as it was when <hi>Sylvander,</hi> or rather that deceive, began fir<U+017F>t unluckily to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee: How wa<U+017F>t thou won by his counterfet affection? And how do<U+017F>t thou find
thy <U+017F>elf now after a knowledg of his trea<U+017F>on? Needs mu<U+017F>t thou confe<U+017F>s, that as the
humours, complexions, and tempers, do change once every <U+017F>even yeers; thine chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
ofter, and not only in <U+017F>even yeers, for a year is an age unto thee, but in a month,
in a week, in an hour, nay even in a munite.</p>
                     <p>This thought touched her to the quick; for never having this opinion of her <U+017F>elf
before, yet finding it now to be true, <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at it, that <U+017F>he was
not able to utter one word. At the la<U+017F>t, rou<U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf up, as out of a dead <U+017F>leep,
<U+017F>he began again thus: Oh Heavens! Oh Earth! art thou not changed? Yes yes,
<hi>Diana,</hi> and <U+017F>o that if thou do<U+017F>t but look well upon thy <U+017F>elf, thou wilt hardly know
thy <U+017F>elf, thou wilt not find any thing of the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Diana</hi> in thee, but only the very
Name. An<U+017F>wer me, I pray thee to the<U+017F>e que<U+017F>tions; how did<U+017F>t thou heretofore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
the flatteries of men, what credit wa<U+017F>t thou wont to give unto their <U+017F>upple lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage?
Ha<U+017F>t thou quite lo<U+017F>t the memory of all tho<U+017F>e wi<U+017F>e in<U+017F>tructions and good
Coun<U+017F>els thou wert wont to give thy companions? Or do<U+017F>t thou think that thy <U+017F>elf
does not need them as much as they? Ah <hi>Diana!</hi> do not deceive thy <U+017F>elf, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s,
that thou art now much different from what thou wert wont to be. Recollect
thy <U+017F>elf a little better, and tell me; do<U+017F>t thou not remember the time when thou
wert the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Diana,</hi> and when all that this co<U+017F>ening Shepherd either <U+017F>aid or did, was
indifferent unto thee? And why <U+017F>hould thou now, if thou art the <U+017F>ame <hi>Diana,</hi> be
angry at this loving <hi>Madonthe,</hi> at his following her, and at his going with her,
whether <U+017F>he would or no? If the<U+017F>e things do vex thee, then confe<U+017F>s that thou art
not the <U+017F>ame <hi>Diana;</hi> and if thou do<U+017F>t deny it, will not thy own con<U+017F>cience accu<U+017F>e
thee? Well, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) if I be not the <U+017F>ame <hi>Diana</hi> I was wont to be, then what
am I become now? Quite contrary (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) to that <hi>Diana</hi> I was wont to
be: Oh Heavens! what a deplorable alteration is this? How much better and more
honourable had it been for me to have dyed in the dayes of the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Diana,</hi> then have
lived to <U+017F>ee this alteration?</p>
                     <p>When <U+017F>he was in the height of her di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure again<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he was diverted
by the coming of <U+017F>ome Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, which talked and di<U+017F>puted
among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves very vehemently; and though <U+017F>he was very bu<U+017F>ie in her own
perplexed thoughts, yet they making a great noi<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>he hearing them a far off,
<U+017F>he had time enough to withdraw her <U+017F>elf un<U+017F>een, behind a great Bu<U+017F>h, which grew
clo<U+017F>e to the way; which <U+017F>he did with intention to let them pa<U+017F>s on, and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
unto the place again, and continue on tho<U+017F>e thoughts which they had interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but <U+017F>he was di<U+017F>appointed; for they, as if it was upon <U+017F>ome expre<U+017F>s de<U+017F>ign, went
<U+017F>traight to the place from whence <hi>Diana</hi> came, and <U+017F>eated them<U+017F>elves upon the bank,
as if they intended to <U+017F>tay there a long time: but <U+017F>he fearing to be di<U+017F>covered, and
perhaps con<U+017F>trained to remain with them, according to the Laws of civility, which
were mo<U+017F>t Religiou<U+017F>ly ob<U+017F>erved about the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> <U+017F>he thought the be<U+017F>t
way was to let them enter into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and when they were mo<U+017F>t earne<U+017F>t and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
unto each other, then <U+017F>he to <U+017F>teal away un<U+017F>een. Then peeping through the
Bu<U+017F>h, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw them <U+017F>itting in a round figure, and that they who<U+017F>e faces were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, were Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, which were not altogether unknown
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53527:147"/>
unto her, having formerly <U+017F>een them at their general Solemnities and Sacrifices.
Then <U+017F>he began to wonder more why they <U+017F>hould come directly to that place, and
<U+017F>tay there as if it was upon <U+017F>ome premeditated de<U+017F>ign; at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>he heard one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
among<U+017F>t them, begin thus: Oh <hi>Delphire,</hi> you are a mo<U+017F>t partial and <U+017F>evere
Judge, in condemning a per<U+017F>on without ever hearing what he can <U+017F>ay for him<U+017F>elf. I
<U+017F>ee <hi>Thaumantes</hi> (an<U+017F>wered the Shepherde<U+017F>s) that you take more pains in pumping
for excu<U+017F>es and glo<U+017F><U+017F>es unto your fal<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons, then I have done to convince and
prove them fal<U+017F>e: If the Gods, replied the Shepherd, had <U+017F>een your <U+017F>oul unbya<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed,
and fit to judge the difference betwixt us, they would not have appointed us to
come and look for a Judge in this place. The Gods, replied the Shepherde<U+017F>s, are
plea<U+017F>ed that the laudable actions of men <U+017F>hould be divulged and recompenced, and
likewi<U+017F>e their faults made publique and puni<U+017F>hed. If puni<U+017F>hments and recompences
(replied he) be to be expected from their hands. Oh <hi>Delphire,</hi> I begin to pitty
you, for you are never able to endure the puni<U+017F>hments that are due unto your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty:
and I know not how my heart, which is <U+017F>o much unaccu<U+017F>tomed unto any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F>s,
will be able to receive that bli<U+017F>s and reward of my fidelity and affection. If
we do meet with a ju<U+017F>t Judge, an<U+017F>wered the Shepherde<U+017F>s and <U+017F>miled, I believe you
will not <U+017F>o much pity as envy me: But <hi>Thaumantes,</hi> let us leave off this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, I
<U+017F>ee you u<U+017F>e it only to plea<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome that are in the company, but a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, there
is none that has a <U+017F>ound judgment will approve of it. I know, replied the Shepherd,
that nothing angers a per<U+017F>on who is in the wrong, more, then to hear that <U+017F>tring
touched upon, becau<U+017F>e it puts them in mind of the injury they do: but he that has
Ju<U+017F>tice on his <U+017F>ide, cannot be <U+017F>ilent at the inju<U+017F>tice which is done him: yet <U+017F>ince you
command me to be <U+017F>ilent, I will obey; yet I hope you will give me leave to <U+017F>ing: <U+017F>o
not <U+017F>taying for her an<U+017F>wer, and having a very good voice, he began to <U+017F>ing a very
invective and bitter <U+017F>ong, which upbraided her with cruelty and inju<U+017F>tice. As <U+017F>oon
as he had done, <hi>Delphire</hi> <U+017F>aid unto him; there needs no other te<U+017F>timony of your
change then this which you have given me, in contemning my commands which
formerly, for your life your dur<U+017F>t not have done: for <U+017F>inging and <U+017F>peaking are crimes
alike, if what is forbidden be pronounced. The Shepherd an<U+017F>wered not a word,
but <U+017F>hrugged his <U+017F>houlders and made a <U+017F>ign that his tongue was tyed: and this gave
occa<U+017F>ion unto another Shepherd in the company, to <U+017F>peak for him: This, <U+017F>aid he,
is exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of cruelty; and very hard that a man may not <U+017F>o much as complain of his
torment. That I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s is very hard, an<U+017F>wered the Shepherde<U+017F>s, but you
mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o confe<U+017F>s with me on the other <U+017F>ide, that to hear a man baul and keep a coyl
when he has no cau<U+017F>e, is exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of patience. But I be<U+017F>eech you, replied he, if you
will not <U+017F>uffer <hi>Thaumantes</hi> to <U+017F>peak, upon what de<U+017F>ign did you come unto this place?
We came hither, replied <U+017F>he, not to di<U+017F>pute and wrangle as we have done, but to
<U+017F>ee if we could find that Judg which the Oracle has promi<U+017F>ed we <U+017F>hould. Are you
<U+017F>ure replied he, that this is the place where you are to expect this Judge: No que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion
but it is, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Delphire,</hi> for it is named, and we are told that this is the
place where <hi>Celadon</hi> fell into the water. There is not one in all the neighbour-hood,
who does not know it as a place ob<U+017F>ervable for <U+017F>everal di<U+017F>a<U+017F>terous accidents: and
as for our Judge, we cannot be mi<U+017F>taken: for the Oracle is this:</p>
                     <lg type="poem">
                        <head>The Oracle.</head>
                        <l>WHere <hi>Celadon</hi> they <U+017F>ay did find a grave,</l>
                        <l>There you, a ju<U+017F>t and prudent judge <U+017F>hall have,</l>
                        <l>Who though un<U+017F>een <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee you, and <U+017F>hall hear</l>
                        <l>Your difference, and do you right, ne'er fear.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>This, replied the Shepherd, is an Oracle very ob<U+017F>cure; for if you do not <U+017F>ee the
party who is to be your Judge, how <U+017F>hould you ever know who he is: Nay more,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Delphire,</hi> the Oracle <U+017F>ays, he <U+017F>hall hear us though we do not <U+017F>ee him: but
certain it is, it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o, for the Gods have <U+017F>aid it, and we are bound upon pain of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53527:147"/>
di<U+017F>obedience to believe it, and therefore we mu<U+017F>t expect he will make it manife<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us. But I be<U+017F>eech you <U+017F>aid the Shepherd, how <U+017F>hould this Judge hear the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<U+017F>ince he is not here? And how <U+017F>hould you tell it unto him? The<U+017F>e difficulties
(an<U+017F>wered <hi>Delphire</hi>) mu<U+017F>t be re<U+017F>olved by the God that gave the Oracle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana</hi> who was all the while behind the Bu<U+017F>h, heard all this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through the leaves, <U+017F>he knew all the Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, though
<U+017F>he had no great familiarity with them; for they were neighbours, and dwelt upon
the banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> towards the Mountains of <hi>Rochfort</hi> and <hi>Chevieres:</hi> and <U+017F>he had
often <U+017F>een them at the publique Sacrifices of Mi<U+017F>leto, and other a<U+017F><U+017F>emblies: <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
al<U+017F>o the high e<U+017F>teem which every one had of the beauty of <hi>Delphire,</hi> and
merit of <hi>Thaumantes,</hi> and <U+017F>o was not altogether ignorant of the amity that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, becau<U+017F>e they did not offer to hide their affections. But <U+017F>eeing now
<U+017F>uch a divorce betwixt them, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e but wonder, and yet her wonder
cea<U+017F>ed, when <U+017F>he con<U+017F>idered what occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he had to complain again<U+017F>t <hi>Sylvander.</hi>
When <U+017F>he heard the Oracle, <U+017F>he concluded that certainly it was <U+017F>he whom the Gods
had cho<U+017F>en to be their Judge, at which <U+017F>he was much di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed; for the ill humour
<U+017F>he was in, made her de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>hun all company, even of her own companions.
Thus <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elf forced to <U+017F>tay all the morning, and to hear their difference,
though it went again<U+017F>t her mind, yet <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to obey what the Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Therefore <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to take little truce with her <U+017F>orrows, and <U+017F>hew her
<U+017F>elf, and take upon her the office of their Judge, but to defer her judgement until
the next day, hoping that in time <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould overcome her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and put her
mind in better order. In order therefore unto this re<U+017F>olve, <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke in a loud
voice the<U+017F>e words: Trouble your <U+017F>elves no further, Oh <hi>Delphire,</hi> and <hi>Thaumantes;</hi>
for here is your Judge, whom the Heavens have ordained to determine your diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
upon this, ri<U+017F>ing from behind the Bu<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>triving to <U+017F>hew a well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
countenance, <U+017F>he went unto them, who were all in <U+017F>uch an amazement, that
they <U+017F>tood like <U+017F>o many Statues: but when they had looked well upon her, and knew
her to be <hi>Diana,</hi> they broke out into an univer<U+017F>al joy: for there was not one of all
the company, who did not know the virtue and merit of that Shepherde<U+017F>s: and
<hi>Thaumantes</hi> was <U+017F>o over joyed to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch a Judge, as he fell down upon his knees,
and offered to ki<U+017F>s her hand; but <hi>Diana</hi> would not permit him, yet <U+017F>aluted him, and
went toward <hi>Delphire,</hi> who imbraced her as heartily as <hi>Thaumantes,</hi> who <U+017F>eeing it
and <U+017F>eeming to be very envious at it: I am afraid (<U+017F>aid he in a loud voice) <U+017F>he will
be as partial in her judgement, as <U+017F>he is in her care<U+017F><U+017F>es. <hi>Diana</hi> hearing this, <U+017F>miled
and <U+017F>aid; Do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ear, for I will ballance every thing according to equity, and
render unto each one what is due. It is the cu<U+017F>tom of tho<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Delphire</hi>) who
have a bad cau<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect the judgement of the mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t per<U+017F>ons, and corrupt
it if they can by their impo<U+017F>tures: But <hi>Thaumantes,</hi> tho<U+017F>e favours which I receive
from this fair Shepherde<U+017F>s, are no more due unto me then unto you; and know,
that what<U+017F>oever is freely given out of meer liberality, cannot be claimed as a debt
due, and therefore you are to blame in asking any part or <U+017F>hare in tho<U+017F>e favours <U+017F>he
is plea<U+017F>ed to confer upon me, <U+017F>ince neither you nor I can pretend unto them as due.
To which <hi>Thaumantes</hi> an<U+017F>wered, it is no wonder, Fair <hi>Delphire,</hi> that he who has <U+017F>o
often troubled you with his angry que<U+017F>tions, <U+017F>hould continue to ask them, <U+017F>ince he
has got a habit of them: and it is no wonder, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that you be denied now,
<U+017F>ince you have been <U+017F>o accu<U+017F>tomed unto it.</p>
                     <p>Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had continued longer, if the re<U+017F>t of the Shepherds and Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es
in <U+017F>aluting <hi>Diana,</hi> had not interrupted them. But when they had all done,
<hi>Delphire</hi> began again; Fair and di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Diana,</hi> I have
often heard <U+017F>ay, that the Graces are never painted alone; to intimate unto us, that
the party who confers one, will immediately <U+017F>econd it with another; or perhaps that
the party who receives one, may be encouraged to ask more: if it be <U+017F>o, then this
Shepherd and I may hope that by what favours you have done unto us, you will add
more, which we do mo<U+017F>t humbly beg at your hands. Sweet <hi>Delphire,</hi> an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Diana,</hi> it were a great di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ie to deny any thing which <U+017F>o fair and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creet a
Shepherde<U+017F>s as you are, <U+017F>hall ask; and therefore you may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf of any
thing within the compa<U+017F>s of my power. The Gods (<U+017F>aid <hi>Thaumantes</hi>) are not like
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53527:148"/>
unto men, for men may give and be<U+017F>tow Offices as they plea<U+017F>e, but they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
capacity to exerci<U+017F>e them; But when the Gods do give any thing, they give with
it all that is requi<U+017F>ite and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary unto it; And therefore, <U+017F>ince it hath plea<U+017F>ed the
Gods to make choice of you, fair <hi>Diana,</hi> to compo<U+017F>e all tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>tempers which
have fallen out betwixt us, and which without you can never be reconciled, it is not
to be doubted but that they have endued you with wi<U+017F>dom, power, and capacity to
effect it. <hi>Thaumantes</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana</hi>) If I had been asked who I thought lived
together in mo<U+017F>t tranquility and contentment, I <U+017F>hould have an<U+017F>wered <hi>Delphire</hi> and
<hi>Thaumantes;</hi> and I do exceedingly wonder to hear you <U+017F>ay that you <U+017F>eek for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilements
and compo<U+017F>ures; But <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o, and <U+017F>ince the Gods have made
choice of me to that end, I will obey them in the execution of their Ordinances, and
as their In<U+017F>trument, who though of my <U+017F>elf le<U+017F>s capable, yet by their a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, may
render them the glory that is due unto them. Every one (replied <hi>Delphire</hi>) are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>taken
as you are, in their opinions of this Shepherds and my happine<U+017F>s, but <U+017F>ince
you are plea<U+017F>ed to undertake the office of our Judge, we be<U+017F>eech you to hear what
we can <U+017F>ay for our <U+017F>elves, and by your wi<U+017F>dom and judgement recover us out of that
gulf of di<U+017F>content and inquietude wherein we are plunged. That which you do ask
as a favour, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> I do think my <U+017F>elf obliged to pay as a due debt, as being
enjoyned unto it by the Ordinance of the Gods, and prompted by mine own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inclination to <U+017F>erve you: But I <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire one favour from you both, which
if granted, I <U+017F>hall take as a very great one; which is, that you will defer the whole
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s until to morrow, at the <U+017F>ame hour and place; for I am obliged to do a piece
of <U+017F>ervice unto a very dear friend, which cannot be delayed without much prejudice
and inconvenience unto her. Unto which <hi>Delphire</hi> replied, Fair and Di<U+017F>creet Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s,
we are obliged unto what<U+017F>oever you <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire or command, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you may take that leave which out of your <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s you are plea<U+017F>ed to ask of
us, for you have a mo<U+017F>t full and ab<U+017F>olute authority over us. Since you are <U+017F>o well
contented, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I will go unto the place where nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity calls me unto,
being very <U+017F>orry to part from <U+017F>uch good company, and promi<U+017F>ing to be here to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
at this place, and about this time: Upon this <U+017F>he took her leave of them, and
went away as fa<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he could, to <U+017F>hew that her bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was urgent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phillis</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide not finding her at home, <U+017F>he went to <U+017F>eek her in <U+017F>uch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed mo<U+017F>t to drive her Flock: But as Fortune was, <U+017F>he made choice of a
place more retired that day, purpo<U+017F>ely becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired not to be <U+017F>een by any:
<U+017F>o that <hi>Phillis,</hi> after <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ought for her in <U+017F>everal places, <U+017F>he came at la<U+017F>t to the
great Meddow, and at the one end of it <U+017F>he e<U+017F>pied <U+017F>ome Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, among<U+017F>t
whom <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw <hi>Diana,</hi> but when <U+017F>he was come neerer, <U+017F>he found her
<U+017F>elf mi<U+017F>taken; and that they were the three <U+017F>trangers, who came from the coa<U+017F>ts of
<hi>Arar,</hi> I mean <hi>Florice, Cercinea,</hi> and <hi>Palinice:</hi> And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw them talking
very affectionately unto each other, and would not tell any the cau<U+017F>e of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into this Country, <U+017F>he thought that perhaps <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould learn <U+017F>omthing if un<U+017F>een
<U+017F>he could hear what they <U+017F>aid. This curio<U+017F>ity cau<U+017F>ed her to creep from Bu<U+017F>h to Bu<U+017F>h,
till <U+017F>he came <U+017F>o neer, that <U+017F>he could hear <hi>Florice</hi> <U+017F>ay, The truth is, I begin to doubt
that the Oracle which cau<U+017F>ed us to come into this Country of Forre<U+017F>ts, will either
deceive us, or el<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e that did interpret it unto us are them<U+017F>elves deceived: for
we have been <U+017F>o long here to no purpo<U+017F>e, that it <U+017F>eems the Gods have either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
us, or el<U+017F>e laugh at us for under<U+017F>tanding them no better. For my part, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Cercinea,</hi> I am the younge<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>ubmitted my <U+017F>elf to the conduct of you both; if
I have failed, the fault is <hi>Palinices,</hi> unto whom I wholly referred my <U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diving into any deep my<U+017F>teries, I under<U+017F>tood the Oracle as <U+017F>he did interpret it
unto me. I am <U+017F>ure an<U+017F>wered <hi>Palinice,</hi> that I did not deceive either of you; for
you heard the Oracle which we received from the Temple of <hi>Venus:</hi> and as for the
interpretation of it, I did not lye in a <U+017F>illable, but told you truly, as the old <hi>Druide</hi>
told me. Since it is <U+017F>o replyed <hi>Cercinea,</hi> we mu<U+017F>t not make too much ha<U+017F>te away,
and though the time be long, yet it is no longer here then upon the Banks of <hi>Arar,</hi>
for the <U+017F>weet conver<U+017F>ation of the di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon,</hi> is as plea<U+017F>ing as
any company we can find in any other place. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Florice,</hi> that the
company of <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> is very <U+017F>weet and plea<U+017F>ing, and that here is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53527:148"/>
many pretty innocent pa<U+017F>times which are <U+017F>utable unto their hone<U+017F>t <U+017F>implicity: but I
mu<U+017F>t tell you, that they are fitter for <U+017F>uch inferiour <U+017F>pirits as theirs are, then for us,
who are accu<U+017F>tomed unto a higher and more noble <U+017F>train; and to tell you truly, this
kind of life begins to be very irk<U+017F>ome unto me, <U+017F>o as if I <U+017F>tay here a little longer, I
<U+017F>hall throw away my Sheep-hook and my Scrip. I know not why you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o
much di<U+017F>like it (replied <hi>Cercinea</hi>) but me-thinks there is nothing in Cities which
equals the liberty and freedom of the<U+017F>e Villages. Here (<U+017F>aid <hi>Florice</hi>) is nothing to
be <U+017F>een but Sheep and Hares, and Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es. Tell me no more
of Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Cercinea,</hi> but find me out <U+017F>uch another
Wit as <hi>Sylvander</hi>'s among<U+017F>t all your great Cities and Towns; or a Woman compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
unto either <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> or <hi>Phillis,</hi> either in beauty, wit, or di<U+017F>cretion: I
mention none of the re<U+017F>t, bur do admire their civility and <U+017F>weet conver<U+017F>ation; and
I do abominate all the con<U+017F>traints, tricks, and di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations of Cities. I <U+017F>ee (<U+017F>aid
<hi>Florice</hi>) that you are like tho<U+017F>e Sorcerers, who having u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome charm upon the
skin of a Wolf, do no <U+017F>ooner put it upon them, but they pre<U+017F>ently participate of
their nature; for this habit of a Shepherd which you wear, has infu<U+017F>ed the wit and
courage of a Shepherde<U+017F>s into you: But well <hi>Cercinea,</hi> be you a Shepherde<U+017F>s as
long as you plea<U+017F>e; but for my part, I de<U+017F>ire to be among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e of my own qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and in my own Country: For to tell you truly, I am mo<U+017F>t delighted in <U+017F>eeing a
Cavalier bravely Arm'd and Mounted, and breaking his Lance hand<U+017F>omly: But what
pitiful <U+017F>port is it to <U+017F>ee two Shepherds run for a Garland of Field-Flowers? To be
<U+017F>hort, the Purple and Scarlet plea<U+017F>eth my eye better then the Ru<U+017F><U+017F>et and Gray; Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
is <U+017F>ofter then Wool; and I love to be among<U+017F>t my equals. Unto <U+017F>uch as ayme
at their contentment, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> Grandeur, and <U+017F>uch vanities as you <U+017F>peak of,
are not the way unto it: and <U+017F>uch as con<U+017F>ider things as indeed they are, not embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<U+017F>haddows for <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances, will mo<U+017F>t certainly condemn them; the gli<U+017F>ter of gold,
and <U+017F>ilver, and purple, which dazles <U+017F>o much the eye, are not half <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ing as a
green Field diapred with Flowers; What needs the Body more then <U+017F>uch a cover as
will defend it from the injury of wind and weather? Provided <U+017F>uch a Suit be fit and
hand<U+017F>omly made, it is better then all the gaudery of Gold, which does but beguil the
eys of tho<U+017F>e who are not able to look what is in the in<U+017F>ide of <U+017F>uch a Suit: As for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari<U+017F>on
between the feats of Chivalry, and the harmle<U+017F>s exerci<U+017F>es of Shepherds, it mu<U+017F>t
needs be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed the one is all blood, violence, injury and murder, and the other is
all innocency, and gives no offence unto any; the one comes near the nature of
Bears, Tigers, and Lions, and the other of men: And as for the reproach which
you put upon me for loving the habit of Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, I <U+017F>ay that I wi<U+017F>h I were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from all tho<U+017F>e turbulencies and cares which does torment tho<U+017F>e that do live in
your perpetual confu<U+017F>ion.</p>
                     <p>She would have continued on, if <hi>Palinice</hi> had not interrupted; It is not our

I conceive it good for us to peru<U+017F>e it again, and con<U+017F>ider <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly upon the

                        <hi>Phillis</hi> who till now never knew the cau<U+017F>e of their voyage, <U+017F>he was very glad

it; not only out of a common curio<U+017F>ity, but a will to do them <U+017F>ervice: And this

had repeated it <U+017F>everal times, For my part (<U+017F>aid <hi>Palanice</hi>) I mu<U+017F>t needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that we ought to <U+017F>tay here yet a while longer, <U+017F>ince it is certain that the <hi>Druide</hi>
told us, <hi>Forre<U+017F>ts</hi> was the place where we <U+017F>hould meet with our <U+017F>atisfaction, and that
our happine<U+017F>s mu<U+017F>t proceed from three per<U+017F>ons, of which, two are hard to be found
out; but the goodne<U+017F>s of God is great, <U+017F>ince that which mu<U+017F>t in<U+017F>truct us, is <U+017F>o cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed that we cannot mi<U+017F>take: for (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and I ob<U+017F>erve it in the words)
when you <U+017F>hall find a per<U+017F>on who <U+017F>hall tell you that God hath appointed you by his
Oracle, that a living dead man <U+017F>hall be your Phi<U+017F>itian and Medicine, with a per<U+017F>on

wor<U+017F>t of all this, is (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Florice</hi>) the lo<U+017F>s of time which will <U+017F>eem very tedious.
<hi>Circenea</hi> an<U+017F>wered and <U+017F>miled, that no happine<U+017F>s is attained without pains. Your
happine<U+017F><U+017F>e is compleated, replied <hi>Florice,</hi> for you are of a more Shepherdi<U+017F>h humour,
then the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es them<U+017F>elves. I have often heard you <U+017F>ay (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Circenea</hi>)
that it is great wi<U+017F>dom to be plea<U+017F>ed with any thing that nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity makes inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es were thus di<U+017F>puting among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, <hi>Phillis</hi> who

therefore when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw them mo<U+017F>t eager in their conte<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>he crept away, and went
to <U+017F>eek <hi>Diana,</hi> who on her <U+017F>ide was not a little perplexed; for as <U+017F>he de<U+017F>igned to
<U+017F>eparate her <U+017F>elf from all conver<U+017F>ation, Fortune would have it <U+017F>o, that which way
<U+017F>oever <U+017F>he went, <U+017F>he met with <U+017F>everal encounters; for having quitted her <U+017F>elf of
<hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Thaumantes,</hi> as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he was out of their <U+017F>ight, looking for the
mo<U+017F>t unfrequented place of all the Wood, <U+017F>he had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>eated her <U+017F>elf under a
<U+017F>hady thicket, but <U+017F>he heard a <U+017F>tranger <U+017F>ing very neer her, <U+017F>inging, and the effect of
the <U+017F>ong was, <hi>That men are without any amity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Diana</hi> heard this voice, <U+017F>he had a good mind to go and <U+017F>ee who it was,
but hearing her begin to talk unto her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he thought it be<U+017F>t to hear what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid;
and <U+017F>he heard her <U+017F>ay thus: What a hard and <U+017F>evere thing it is which Nature hath
impo<U+017F>ed upon Women, that they mu<U+017F>t not only live among<U+017F>t their enemies, but
al<U+017F>o be <U+017F>ubject unto their Tyrannical Dominion? Had <U+017F>he but put a little more
<U+017F>trength into our body, we had not been <U+017F>ubject unto that proud and fierce animal,
called Man: but why did <U+017F>he not as well <U+017F>ubject this man, unto an Ox or an Hor<U+017F>e,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53527:149"/>
which are <U+017F>tronger then he, as he is <U+017F>tronger then us? For if weakne<U+017F>s be the cau<U+017F>e
of our <U+017F>ubjection, why <U+017F>hould not they be <U+017F>ubject unto them? Nay, upon the <U+017F>ame
rea<U+017F>on, why <U+017F>hould not the weakne<U+017F>s of their minds <U+017F>ubject them unto our bodies?
For the <U+017F>trength of their judgements cannot be equal unto the <U+017F>trength of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Is it not an infallible argument of a weak judgement, to de<U+017F>ire a thing mo<U+017F>t
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, and mediately not to de<U+017F>ire it? Which is he among<U+017F>t men, that has
not deceived her that tru<U+017F>ted in him? Shew me the man, who makes it a matter of
con<U+017F>cience to keep his word, his promi<U+017F>es, nay his very oaths and execrations, when
he intends to deceive? They think their di<U+017F>loyalty is hand<U+017F>omly covered, when they
<U+017F>ay, that the Gods will not puni<U+017F>h the oaths of perjured Lovers: It is true indeed,
they do not puni<U+017F>h them immediately upon the very act, but yet they defer it only,
becau<U+017F>e they will puni<U+017F>h them according to their merits altogether: there is not a
man breathing upon the face of the earth, that does not <U+017F>wear and prote<U+017F>t, and vow,
and yet his intention is quite contrary: their de<U+017F>ignes are meer Chimeras, empty
clouds; one is no <U+017F>ooner begun, but another <U+017F>econds it, and quite obliterates the
fir<U+017F>t<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> their promi<U+017F>es and their oaths re<U+017F>emble great claps of thunder, who<U+017F>e noi<U+017F>e
is no <U+017F>ooner ended, but no more is heard of it: what God is there whom they will
not call to witne<U+017F>s? What cur<U+017F>e will they not call for upon them<U+017F>elves? And what
a<U+017F><U+017F>urance will they not give, when they would obtain any thing of us? But when the
humour of it is pa<U+017F>t, or when they have obtained what they de<U+017F>ire, who cares for
any performances of promi<U+017F>e, or fears any cur<U+017F>es they called upon them<U+017F>elves? But
pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>eek out for excu<U+017F>es to avoid tho<U+017F>e cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ements which they de<U+017F>erve: they

<U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed, but looked about her with <U+017F>uch an affrighted countenance, and
wild eye, as te<U+017F>tified, the words of her mouth proceeded from her heart. <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her in this condition, and thinking her a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment proceeded from the <U+017F>ame

                        </gap>he began to pity her; and <U+017F>aluting her with
a kind a<U+017F>pect, offered all the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance and <U+017F>ervice <U+017F>he was able. The <U+017F>tranger <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her <U+017F>o fair and full of curte<U+017F>ie, began to leave her affrighted and wild looks, and
a<U+017F><U+017F>ume her ordinary countenance and temper. After <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aluted <hi>Diana,</hi> and
thanked her for her courteous offers, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered thus; I am very willing and de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
Fair Shepherde<U+017F>s, to render the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ervices unto you, which you out of
your goodne<U+017F>s are plea<U+017F>ed to offer unto me, and wi<U+017F>h with all my heart, I were
able to <U+017F>econd my de<U+017F>ires with real performances, as your civility does oblige me;
but as the ca<U+017F>e is with me, I mu<U+017F>t now be all upon the craving <U+017F>ide, and not only beg
your a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, but al<U+017F>o that remedy, which by the appointment of the Gods, I
come to look for in this Country. A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> that you will
find none here who will not be very ready to do you any <U+017F>ervice: but I believe you
will not find any here <U+017F>o vain as to think them<U+017F>elves able to Coun<U+017F>el others, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<U+017F>implicity of our words will not permit <U+017F>o much arrogance to be among<U+017F>t us:
Yet two things, replied the <U+017F>tranger, makes me hope well in my voyage; the one,
that the Gods are no lyars, nor breakers of their promi<U+017F>es, but have left that quality
unto men: The other is, becau<U+017F>e my fir<U+017F>t encounter in this Country, is a very good
omen that I <U+017F>hall find what I look for: your beauty, your civility, and your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions makes me hope for a happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s in my voyage. The Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> are no lyars nor deceivers, but <U+017F>ometimes they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
to render their Oracles <U+017F>o full of ob<U+017F>curity, that men do often mi<U+017F>take and deceive
them<U+017F>elves in the interpretation: as for any thing that relates unto me, I wi<U+017F>h fair
Shepherde<U+017F>s that the meeting may prove as <U+017F>erviceable unto you, as it is plea<U+017F>ing
unto me, and as I de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>erve you. If there be any thing in this Country which
you think conducible unto your contentment, I be<U+017F>eech you, tell it unto me; and
if without prejudice to your <U+017F>elf you may, tell me what occa<U+017F>ion brought you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53527:150"/>
and what rea<U+017F>on you have to enveigh <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t men? Upon this the <U+017F>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<U+017F>tood mute a while, and looked upon the ground; at the la<U+017F>t, lifting up her head
with a <U+017F>ad <U+017F>ih, <U+017F>he returned this an<U+017F>wer: The que<U+017F>tion which you ask, Fair Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s,
is <U+017F>o rea<U+017F>onable, that I will very willingly give you <U+017F>atisfaction; knowing
very well that the patient mu<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cover his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e unto that Phi<U+017F>itian from whom he
de<U+017F>ires a remedy; but before I trouble you with a hearing of it, I be<U+017F>eech you <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
my curio<U+017F>ity, and tell me whether you be not either <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> or <hi>Diana;</hi> for one
of my greate<U+017F>t inducements unto the voyage, was my hopes of <U+017F>o much happine<U+017F>s,
as to be acquainted with tho<U+017F>e two Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, as well by <U+017F>ight, as by tho<U+017F>e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
which Fame gives of them. There may be many Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es in this Country
(an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana</hi> blu<U+017F>hing) who<U+017F>e names may be <hi>Diana,</hi> and perhaps <U+017F>ome one of
them more favoured by the Heavens above the re<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o as the name of <hi>Diana</hi> which I
do bear, cannot make me believe my <U+017F>elf the <U+017F>ame you <U+017F>peak of, <U+017F>ince Fame has no
ground of any reports from me: but <U+017F>uch as I am, I will not deny the name, of
which you have <U+017F>o good an opinion, and wi<U+017F>h I were able, as I am willing to do you
any <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ervice as might make you continue here. Are you (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>tranger) the
companion of <hi>A<U+017F>trea?</hi> I am, replied <hi>Diana;</hi> Then (<U+017F>aid the <U+017F>tranger) there are no
more <hi>Dianas</hi> in this Country whom I de<U+017F>ire to know: it is you only and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
who have filled me <U+017F>o full of curio<U+017F>ity, and made me more willingly come
into this Country, though the Gods did advi<U+017F>e me unto it by their Oracle: upon
this <U+017F>he <U+017F>aluted her with <U+017F>uch demon<U+017F>trations of good will, that <hi>Diana</hi> was obliged
unto the like.</p>
                     <p>At the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant, <hi>Phillis,</hi> who had been looking for <hi>Diana</hi> in all places where
there was any probability of finding her, <U+017F>aw them thus <U+017F>aluting and care<U+017F><U+017F>ing each
other, and therefore <U+017F>he made the more ha<U+017F>te towards them. The <U+017F>tranger <U+017F>eeing
her coming, and being very de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewed her unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and
asked her whether that was her Companion? She is my Companion (an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Diana</hi>) but I believe, not that Companion whom you de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee, for the name
of this is <hi>Phillis;</hi> and though perhaps <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t yeild unto the other in point of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
yet I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, there is not one in all the Country that exceeds her in di<U+017F>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and virtue. I make no que<U+017F>tion of it (an<U+017F>wered the <U+017F>tranger) <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is your
Companion: Indeed <U+017F>he is, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> and the deare<U+017F>t Companion that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
and I have, and <U+017F>uch a one, as when you know her, you will think worthy of Love
and e<U+017F>teem. Upon this, <hi>Phillis</hi> was come unto them, and broke off their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
and <hi>Diana</hi> going to her, Si<U+017F>ter <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her, make much of this <U+017F>tranger, and for
my <U+017F>ake Love her, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he is come to encrea<U+017F>e the number of the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of
<hi>Lignon. Phillis,</hi> as well to an<U+017F>wer the de<U+017F>ires of her Companion, as in ob<U+017F>ervance
to the Laws of the Country, <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently advanced towards her, and the <U+017F>tranger
did the like, infinitely <U+017F>atisfied with the kind entertainment of the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es,
who<U+017F>e <U+017F>weet civility <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>ufficiently admire, thinking that they did much
<U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s all the reports that Fame had trumpetted in their prai<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Diana,</hi> though <U+017F>he made no <U+017F>hew of it, yet, was her <U+017F>oul full of perplexity,
by rea<U+017F>on of <hi>Sylvander;</hi> and the con<U+017F>traint wherein <U+017F>he was <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he met with
this <U+017F>tranger, <U+017F>eemed intollerable to be endured any longer: and therefore <U+017F>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he had learned the cau<U+017F>e of her coming into this Country, to
leave her: Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> This fair <U+017F>tranger is come into the Country
to find a remedy again<U+017F>t a di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure which pre<U+017F><U+017F>eth her; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he merits the
<U+017F>ervice of us all, I <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire her, <U+017F>ince you are come, to acquaint us with the cau<U+017F>e
of her voyage, that we may be better enabled to do her that <U+017F>ervice which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire,
and <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erves. <hi>Phillis</hi> on the contrary, who was not willing to lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>o much
time as to hear this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered thus: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s Si<U+017F>ter, that you have
great rea<U+017F>on for your de<U+017F>ire, but me-thinks we <U+017F>hould much wrong our companion,
if we do not an<U+017F>wer her expectation of our company; and therefore I conceive it
be<U+017F>t to defer it until <U+017F>uch time as <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> may be pre<U+017F>ent. <hi>Diana</hi> did quickly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
the rea<U+017F>on which cau<U+017F>ed <hi>Phillis</hi> to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, and approving of it, they all went
together towards the great Walk; into which, as <U+017F>oon as they entred, they <U+017F>aw
<hi>Florice, Cercenea,</hi> and <hi>Palinice</hi> very near them; who having long debated upon
the <U+017F>ubject which <hi>Phillis</hi> overheard, they came thither to pa<U+017F>s away their time, till

the re<U+017F>t of the Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es a<U+017F><U+017F>embled according to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tome.</p>
                     <p>When the <U+017F>tranger fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw them, <U+017F>he knew them not, nor ever imagined that
they were in this Country, al<U+017F>o their habits of Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es did <U+017F>o di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e them,
that <U+017F>he might very well mi<U+017F>take them; and when they came nearer, <U+017F>he knew them
by their voices, and not by their vi<U+017F>ages: I am either extreamly deceived (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he in a
great amazement) or el<U+017F>e I do <U+017F>ee my dear friends. <hi>Florice</hi> then and her two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
looking upon her, and hearing her <U+017F>peak, they knew her; they went unto
her, and embraced her with <U+017F>uch extream joy, as made it manife<U+017F>t that people love
one another better when they meet in a <U+017F>trange Country, then when they are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their own: For they had not <U+017F>o much patience as to embrace her one after
another, but fell upon her all at once; one ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her lips, another her cheek, and
a third gra<U+017F>ped her hand, with <U+017F>uch demon<U+017F>trations of good will, as perhaps never
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed among<U+017F>t them when they met upon the Banks of <hi>Arar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Diana</hi> in a low voice) had we not be<U+017F>t leave this <U+017F>tranger among<U+017F>t

before we have given her notice, as well in re<U+017F>pect of <hi>Alexis,</hi> as becau<U+017F>e you know

                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t they were thus talking, <hi>Florice</hi> and her companions could not <U+017F>ufficiently

upon condition you will be as good as you promi<U+017F>e, in making me known unto the
Fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and in the mean time a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her, that you have met with one who with

faithfully promi<U+017F>e, and more, we promi<U+017F>e to do any thing el<U+017F>e which may conduce

                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Phillis</hi> thought it expedient to engage <hi>Florice, Cercinea,</hi> and
<hi>Palinice,</hi> le<U+017F>t their impatience <U+017F>hould make them depart the Country too <U+017F>oon; and

<U+017F>he unto her in a loud voice) I be<U+017F>eech you <U+017F>tay a little for me, and I will wait upon
you pre<U+017F>ently, for I mu<U+017F>t needs talk a little with the<U+017F>e three fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es. Si<U+017F>ter,

what you plea<U+017F>e unto them. Then <hi>Phillis</hi> addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf unto the<U+017F>e three <U+017F>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<hi>Florice</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, in a low and grave countenance, otherwi<U+017F>e then <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed) and
you <hi>Cercinea</hi> and <hi>Palinice,</hi> The Gods do let you know by me, that which they have
already <U+017F>poken unto you by their Oracle, how that one who was dead, and yet lives, is
to be your medicine, and likewi<U+017F>e another unto whom is rendred again<U+017F>t her Will, a
benefit which <U+017F>he lo<U+017F>t with her Will. O ye Gods! cryed they all out, and clapped their
hands together, oh ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed Shepherde<U+017F>s, whom the heavens have ordained for our
happine<U+017F>s and contentment, may you for ever find the accompli<U+017F>hment of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ires,
as we have of ours in meeting with you: Then gazing upon one another, Is
it not mo<U+017F>t certain (<U+017F>aid they) that the Gods are no Deceivers, but will at the la<U+017F>t
mo<U+017F>t infallibly perform all their promi<U+017F>es? Upon this, all three <U+017F>aluted <hi>Phillis</hi> with
<U+017F>o many expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of joy, that <hi>Diana,</hi> and the other <U+017F>tranger who knew not the
cau<U+017F>e of their coming, <U+017F>tood amazed: But <hi>Phillis</hi> who continued her grave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
after <U+017F>he had returned their <U+017F>alute; Now, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I cannot <U+017F>tay with you
any longer; the time is not yet come that your pain mu<U+017F>t have an end, but it will be

very <U+017F>hortly: content your <U+017F>elves therefore with this, that the Gods have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
what they told you by their Oracle, but will in fit time and place accompli<U+017F>h
it. <hi>Florice</hi> then began to <U+017F>peak; now (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) we know unto whom the Gods
have committed the care of us, we will with all contentment wait as long as you <U+017F>hall
plea<U+017F>e; a<U+017F><U+017F>uring you <U+017F>age Shepherde<U+017F>s, that we are infinitely plea<U+017F>ed with the choi<U+017F>e

unto their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, but not under<U+017F>tanding it, <hi>Diana</hi> asked <hi>Phillis,</hi> what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
this was which they <U+017F>poke off. The Gods, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis</hi> have <U+017F>ent
the<U+017F>e three <U+017F>trangers into the Country to receive a remedy unto <U+017F>ome perplexities
which troubles them, and by their Oracle have forbidden them to <U+017F>peak of it unto
any, but unto that per<U+017F>on who <U+017F>hall repeat the an<U+017F>wer which they received from the
Oracle. Now I have repeated it unto them, and more, I do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure them, that they
<U+017F>hall receive all manner of <U+017F>atisfaction and contentment. As <hi>Diana</hi> was a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed
at the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o was <U+017F>he much more, when <U+017F>he heard the<U+017F>e words, for <U+017F>he could not
imagine how her Companion <U+017F>hould come to the knowledg of this Oracle. But
<hi>Phillis</hi> counterfeiting admirably well, that it was by divine in<U+017F>piration; after <U+017F>ome
other <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he took her leave of them; a<U+017F><U+017F>uring them, that ere long they
<U+017F>hould find ea<U+017F>e and <U+017F>atisfaction to their minds: and by the way, <U+017F>he related unto
<hi>Diana</hi> how as <U+017F>he was <U+017F>eeking her, <U+017F>he met with them, and un<U+017F>een of them, heard
them repeat and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon this Oracle.</p>
                     <p>Thus they went talking upon this encounter, till they came to the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi>
but finding her no further dre<U+017F>t, then when they left her; Oh Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi> and
<U+017F>eemed to wonder) what, not farther yet? Do I find you ju<U+017F>t as I left you? It is to
<U+017F>hew (an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) that I am no changeling. Nay, nay, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> my
meaning is, you are dre<U+017F>t no more then you were when I went to <U+017F>eek <hi>Diana:</hi> Pray
what have you been doing all the while? Certainly Si<U+017F>ter, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you
are very weary, <U+017F>ince the time <U+017F>eems <U+017F>o long unto you: I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you I thought you
but newly parted: It <U+017F>eems quite contrary with you, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> and that you
have been <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ed, that hours <U+017F>eem but minutes unto you. If contentment and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F>s
can do it, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s what you <U+017F>ay: and yet Si<U+017F>ter, do
not think that I have done nothing <U+017F>ince you went, for in this <U+017F>hort time, I have
gotten the Faire<U+017F>t Mi<U+017F>tris that ever was: And I, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t Servant
that ever lived. I warrant you (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) you have <U+017F>pent all this morning about
this piece of work. Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) you need not <U+017F>light it <U+017F>o much; for it is not
a work <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily done; <U+017F>ome are whole months and years, nay whole ages about it.
Yes, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) and for all the ha<U+017F>te which they make, they have time enough to
repent all the dayes of their life: That is a thing (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) which I <U+017F>hall never
do, unle<U+017F>s I repent that I begun it no <U+017F>ooner: I do believe it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
your Mi<U+017F>tris is a Woman, but if it were a man, believe it Si<U+017F>ter, you would be
no more exempted then others; and for my part, I <U+017F>hall advi<U+017F>e all tho<U+017F>e that de<U+017F>ire
to have a quiet life, never to contract amity with any but Women, and to <U+017F>hun all
the a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of any good will which Men u<U+017F>e to make, as a Serpent does the words
of enchantment. I do wonder (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) you <U+017F>hould accu<U+017F>e men of that vice
which they do <U+017F>o much charge us with all. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> did you never
hear the Proverb, <hi>The Debtor demands money;</hi> Men likewi<U+017F>e do prevent us, and blame
us for that which them<U+017F>elves are guilty of: believe it, the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>ervitude that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
did impo<U+017F>e upon us, is in that <U+017F>he con<U+017F>trained us to live in their company. Then
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi> and <U+017F>miled) how happy are the re<U+017F>t of our <hi>Druides</hi> who are exempted
from this inconveniency. Doubtle<U+017F>s they are Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> and you
will know it better, if you will but he plea<U+017F>ed to con<U+017F>ider what I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay unto you;
certainly if men be at any time plea<U+017F>ing unto tho<U+017F>e they court, it is when they are
inflamed with Love, and <U+017F>eem as if they adored them, for then they are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,
all <U+017F>ervice, all cares, all <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, all flatteries; briefly their continual
<U+017F>tudy is to get the favour of tho<U+017F>e who hearken unto them: <U+017F>o as que<U+017F>tionle<U+017F>s if ever
a man be not trouble<U+017F>ome, it is at this time; and yet if we do but well con<U+017F>ider it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
how many inconveniences and troubles do they bring tho<U+017F>e poor unfortunate
women, whom they have de<U+017F>igns upon? For if they do not Love them, then
all their cares and court<U+017F>hips are <U+017F>o many wrongs and injuries unto them: and if
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53527:151"/>
they do Love them, con<U+017F>ider, I be<U+017F>eech you Madam, how un<U+017F>upportable they are if
they find entertainment, and how trouble<U+017F>ome they are if they be rejected: they
think one favour to be a <U+017F>tep unto another, and never leave till they arrive at
the highe<U+017F>t: if you reject them, then they are all complaint, reproaches, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>paires,
and very often driven unto hatred and revenge: if thou entertain them, they
are <U+017F>till never contented, till they arrive at that which they cannot obtain, without
the ruine of tho<U+017F>e that give the entertainment; if you do not grant them all that they
de<U+017F>ire, then, the more favours you have done them, the more occa<U+017F>ions have you
given them to ruin you. Then to Crown the work; when they are arrived at the
height of their de<U+017F>ires, you run a hazard either to be <U+017F>lighted, or to live in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
inquietude for their incon<U+017F>tancy. As for tho<U+017F>e that are repul<U+017F>ed at the fir<U+017F>t; how
infinitely trouble<U+017F>ome they are unto us? What in<U+017F>upportable torments they are by
their importunities, and <U+017F>ubtilties? They will hang upon you like a bur; they will
follow you as a <U+017F>haddow does the body; they will never be ab<U+017F>ent from you, but
when night comes and <U+017F>eparates you from them and all others: you can have no
other object before your eyes but them; and will be <U+017F>o trouble<U+017F>ome unto you, that
you will be glad to bani<U+017F>h from you <U+017F>uch company as you love, only to be rid of
them you love not. At the la<U+017F>t, if their love do die, as they are very <U+017F>ubject unto
<U+017F>uch changes, what is it which their <U+017F>pite will not make them belch forth again<U+017F>t you?
Their calumnies will bla<U+017F>t the mo<U+017F>t unblameable life that ever lived: the herce<U+017F>t Tygers
that ever nature created, are not <U+017F>o full of revenge as they will be again<U+017F>t us. So
then it mu<U+017F>t be concluded (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and interrupted) that men are troubles at
all times, according to <hi>Dianas</hi> Doctrine. For my part (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) I <U+017F>hall not
need to fear them, when I am with <hi>Alexis</hi> among<U+017F>t the Virgin <hi>Druides</hi> of <hi>Carnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi>
but to tell you truly, I do believe, there are very few men who have not a
tincture of tho<U+017F>e vices, wherewith <hi>Diana</hi> upbraids them. The<U+017F>e few words from
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> did touch <hi>Celadon</hi> <U+017F>o to the quick, that he knew not what to <U+017F>ay, yet le<U+017F>t he
<U+017F>hould give any notice of it, he thought him<U+017F>elf obliged to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omething: For my
part, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> I know not what to <U+017F>ay, for I never made any tryal of the<U+017F>e
deceivers, and have known <U+017F>ome changing women: Then turning to <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> Oh
Servant, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he in a low voice) when we are among<U+017F>t the Virgin <hi>Druides,</hi> we
<U+017F>hall care but a little for the incon<U+017F>tancy of the<U+017F>e wavering men, and we will laugh at
your Companions who do live in that <U+017F>ervitude. I hope <U+017F>o, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) and
I prote<U+017F>t unto you Mi<U+017F>tris, I do with extream impatience long to <U+017F>ee the day when
we mu<U+017F>t depart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>eeing them whi<U+017F>per, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould interrupt them, did <U+017F>tand a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off, but <hi>Phillis</hi> who was of a very plea<U+017F>ant and gay humour, and knew very
well that <hi>Alexis</hi> would take delight in it, Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Diana</hi>) is not my
prophecy come to pa<U+017F>s? Does not <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> who was wont to Love none but <hi>Diana</hi>
and <hi>Phillis,</hi> and who took delight in no company but theirs, does not <U+017F>he I <U+017F>ay,
di<U+017F>dain them now? and Loves only this new Shepherde<U+017F>s? Whereby you may note,
that men may well accu<U+017F>e us al<U+017F>o of levity, and incon<U+017F>tancy. Ah <hi>Phillis</hi> (an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Astrea,</hi> and <U+017F>miled) do you not ob<U+017F>erve that I am now no Shepherde<U+017F>s? Do
you <U+017F>ee, how I am become a <hi>Druide?</hi> And do you not know that honours change
manners? But I hope, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that when this <hi>Druide</hi> is gone, who has infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
<U+017F>o much pride into you, then you will return unto your former humility, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech
you angry Shepherde<U+017F>s, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> withhold your revenge upon me till
that time, and then I will not complain of any hurt you can do me: your meaning
is replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that then you will be full of greater di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures then ours, and
will not value what we can do: that, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> is not my meaning. Then, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Phillis,</hi> do you think us of <U+017F>uch good di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions, that <U+017F>eeing you afflicted for others,
we will have no mind to augment your di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures? But you will deceive your <U+017F>elf in
that; for ingratitude is a vice <U+017F>o dete<U+017F>table, that it turns the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t natures into
har<U+017F>h di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions, and makes the mo<U+017F>t courteous and kind, become <U+017F>urly, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative.
That is not my meaning neither, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> but it is, becau<U+017F>e you
<U+017F>hall not <U+017F>ee my here after my Fair Mi<U+017F>tris is gone; for I am fully re<U+017F>olved to follow
her whither<U+017F>oever <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall go, and <U+017F>he is plea<U+017F>ed to permit me. Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,
Calidon</hi> will never permit that voyage; <hi>Calidon,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> has no more
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53527:152"/>
to do with me, then I will have with him: But <hi>Phocion</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) will order it
after another manner. The will of Heaven and of my de<U+017F>tiny, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the will of men. But I be<U+017F>eech you, added <hi>Phillis,</hi> has not tho<U+017F>e friends which
you have here any prevalence with you? I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that
if any have, it is they, and this con<U+017F>ideration only can make me re<U+017F>ent my di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ures:
but when I think upon tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>orrows, which I have received from the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>table
River of <hi>Lignon;</hi> I <U+017F>hall de<U+017F>ire to be <U+017F>o far di<U+017F>tant from it, as that the memory
of it may be quite extingui<U+017F>hed. If that be your de<U+017F>ign (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) then you mu<U+017F>t
re<U+017F>olve to carry us with you, for you know our affection will never <U+017F>uffer us to be
far from you. Should Heaven con<U+017F>ent unto that, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I <U+017F>hould be but
too happy: I hope, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> that Heaven will favour us as well as you, and
deliver us from that <U+017F>ervitude wherein we live. <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Belinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) will
pronounce an arre<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t you: Yes, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi> will no le<U+017F>s oppo<U+017F>e
the voyage, unle<U+017F>s he may have leave to follow <hi>Phillis. Paris</hi> and <hi>Belinde,</hi> an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Diana,</hi> will never ordain any thing again<U+017F>t my will, nor again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ervice of
<hi>Tautates;</hi> for both of them are Religious and Wi<U+017F>e. But if they <U+017F>hould, I <U+017F>hould be
excu<U+017F>able in my di<U+017F>-obedience to <hi>Belinde,</hi> becau<U+017F>e I ought to imitate my Mother in
dedicating my <U+017F>elf unto the <U+017F>ame God unto whom <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf is devoted: And as for
<hi>Paris,</hi> I hope that I may di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e him to exempt my <U+017F>elf from all manner of di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ures.
This con<U+017F>ideration therefore, need not to hinder you from carrying us
with you. If this con<U+017F>ideration will not hinder, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi> and <U+017F>miled) I have one
that will, which is, a re<U+017F>olution never to put <hi>Lycidas</hi> unto the trouble of following
me <U+017F>o far; for I do not intend to be di<U+017F>tant from him, farther then the limits of our
Town will extend.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> could not forbear laughing at <hi>Phillis,</hi> which cau<U+017F>ed her to
add further; do not think Si<U+017F>ter, what<U+017F>oever I <U+017F>ay of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> but that I love you as wel
as any Si<U+017F>ter in the world can: but I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, that the affection which I
bear unto the Shepherd, is of another kind then that which I bear unto you: were I
as well learned as <hi>Sylvander,</hi> perhaps I <U+017F>hould make a better definition of it; but <U+017F>o
it is, that I can hardly be deprived of his <U+017F>ight for any other: I hope you will not
take my freedom in an ill <U+017F>ence, but rather excu<U+017F>e it, becau<U+017F>e lying is not permitted
among<U+017F>t us. Si<U+017F>ter, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Astrea,</hi> I <U+017F>hall never be one that will condemn your
humour; but perhaps I <U+017F>hall be extreamly <U+017F>orry to be <U+017F>o far di<U+017F>tant from you.
Could I divide my <U+017F>elf into two parts, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> the one <U+017F>hould wait upon
you which way <U+017F>oever you went: but <U+017F>ince that cannot be, I be<U+017F>eech you, give me
leave to make good my promi<U+017F>e unto <hi>Lycidas. Diana</hi> then <U+017F>miled and <U+017F>aid, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
there is none but my <U+017F>elf who will keep the promi<U+017F>e which we made unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea.</hi>
I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>upply the place of <hi>Phillis</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) and perform the office of
amity which that Shepherde<U+017F>s hath <U+017F>worn unto her. Do not think Madam, replied
<hi>Phillis,</hi> that I will ever fail in my promi<U+017F>e to her: but <U+017F>he knows very well, that
when we contracted our league of amity unto each other, one condition was, not to
deny any thing that the one <U+017F>hould ask of the other; and <U+017F>ince I ask her pardon if I
do not follow her, <U+017F>he cannot, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>he be perjured, deny it. It is very true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <U+017F>ighed, nor will I blame you for what you do, no more then
you upbraid me with my pa<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>-fortune.</p>
                     <p>Their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had la<U+017F>ted long, had it not been for <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf: but
<hi>Alexis</hi> being taller then <U+017F>he, and by con<U+017F>equence her Gown too long for her, <hi>Diana</hi>
and <hi>Phillis</hi> did take it in, by tucking it up <U+017F>o hand<U+017F>omly, that it was as fit as if mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
had been taken of her. The <hi>Druide,</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide thinking that <U+017F>he had
counterfeited <U+017F>ick long enough, al<U+017F>o fearing that if <U+017F>he continued in bed, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
di<U+017F>cover the defects of her bre<U+017F>ts; <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to get up, and walk in the little grove
of Ha<U+017F>les with <hi>A<U+017F>trea;</hi> fore<U+017F>eeing that otherwi<U+017F>e if <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed in her chamber, they

took in talking with the Shepherde<U+017F>s without interruption. In order therefore unto
this de<U+017F>ign, Servant (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) <U+017F>ee what an excellent operation your
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e has had upon my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s: Since you came hither, I have been as well as I
can wi<U+017F>h: if therefore you will let me ri<U+017F>e, we will go and walk away the re<U+017F>t of the
morning in the little Wood: If I have been any In<U+017F>trument of your well being, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered

                        <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I <U+017F>hall think my <U+017F>elf the happie<U+017F>t Woman in the world, for I have no
greater ambition then to do you <U+017F>ervice. Oh Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis;</hi> we will all thank
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> for being <U+017F>o good a Doctor. Indeed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> I find my <U+017F>elf very well,
and if you will give me the Gown which I am to put on, I will dre<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf and go
with you whither you plea<U+017F>e. <hi>Phillis</hi> ran pre<U+017F>ently to reach <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> Gown, and
helping her to put it on, <U+017F>he was dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed pre<U+017F>ently: then coming unto the window,
<U+017F>he dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed up her head, and tricked up her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o, that this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be one of the Faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon: A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>eeing her, could not
chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>ay unto <hi>Phillis;</hi> Well <hi>Phillis,</hi> do you think the time I <U+017F>pent in getting
<U+017F>uch a Fair Mi<U+017F>tris, was not well imployed? Certainly it was, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> and
<U+017F>miled, if you were <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> Brother; for it is the cu<U+017F>tom in this Country, when one
<U+017F>peaks of a Mi<U+017F>tris and Servant, a Shepherd and a Shepherde<U+017F>s is to be under<U+017F>tood.
Oh <hi>Phillis</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana</hi>) among<U+017F>t the Virgin <hi>Druids,</hi> the cu<U+017F>tome is quite
contrary; and you mu<U+017F>t know, (added <hi>Alexis</hi>) that in the Sacrifices of <hi>Ve<U+017F>ta,</hi>
men are not received.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Druide</hi> was dre<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he took <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> by the hand, and led her out;
and the Flocks of <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> being neer the door, <hi>Alexis</hi> would needs drive
them, to <U+017F>hew <U+017F>he was not a<U+017F>hamed of her habit; but to make them believe <U+017F>he was
ignorant in that mi<U+017F>tery, <U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed her Sheephook and talked to the Flock very auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
at which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh, and <hi>Diana</hi> would needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to direct and teach her what to do. After they had a while made them<U+017F>elves
merry at this exerci<U+017F>e, they walked to the Wood, into which they were no <U+017F>ooner
entred, but they <U+017F>pied upon their left hand, a great company of Shepherds and
Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, who were walking there in the <U+017F>hade: this encounter did a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the two di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed parties, for being not yet grown confident enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
they were afraid to be <U+017F>een by any; and therefore they de<U+017F>ired <hi>Diana</hi> and
<hi>Phillis,</hi> to walk towards that company, whil<U+017F>t they, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>hould be known, would
take another way: the two good friends according to their de<U+017F>ires, went forward
and came up to the company; who <U+017F>eeing them, did advance them<U+017F>elves to bid
them good morrow. <hi>Diana</hi> having met with <hi>Daphnis</hi> among<U+017F>t them, as her <U+017F>pecial
and intimate friend; <U+017F>he went to embrace her, and ask her how <U+017F>he had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away
the night. All complements and <U+017F>alutations being ended, <hi>Hylas</hi> who was in the
company, and <hi>Corilas</hi> al<U+017F>o, not being able to be together without <U+017F>everal di<U+017F>putes,
they continued on the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, which they had begun before tho<U+017F>e two Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es
came unto them. Good <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas,</hi> tell me one thing; when thou
did<U+017F>t change <hi>Alexis</hi> for <hi>Stella,</hi> at what game did<U+017F>t thou play? Why, (an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Hylas</hi>) do you ask me that que<U+017F>tion? Becau<U+017F>e I think, replied <hi>Corilas,</hi> that thou
dare<U+017F>t hardly <U+017F>ay it was the game of the Faire<U+017F>t, as thou wert wont to <U+017F>ay when thou
did<U+017F>t leave <hi>Phillis</hi> for <hi>Alexis;</hi> for I cannot believe thy eyes <U+017F>o bad, but thou mu<U+017F>t
needs <U+017F>ee, that <U+017F>he whom thou ha<U+017F>t left, is Fairer then <U+017F>he whom thou ha<U+017F>t taken:
Oh thou ignorant novice, in beauty (cryed out <hi>Hylas</hi>) what is it that can be called
Fair, unle<U+017F>s it plea<U+017F>e? I confe<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas</hi>) that beauty does plea<U+017F>e; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
confe<U+017F>s, all that plea<U+017F>eth to be Fair: and <U+017F>o that which a depraved ta<U+017F>te thinks
good, ought not to be e<U+017F>teemed <U+017F>o therefore. How now friend? (replied <hi>Hylas</hi>)
What, one of <hi>Sylvanders</hi> di<U+017F>ciples? Perhaps thou thinke<U+017F>t as he does, that beauty is a
right proportion, and a true mixture of colours; Oh how gro<U+017F>ly thou art mi<U+017F>taken,
if thou thinke<U+017F>t <U+017F>o? Beauty is nothing but an opinion of her whom we judge to be
<U+017F>o: and to demon<U+017F>trate it unto thee; when a woman has a little mouth, a well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
no<U+017F>e, a cleer skin, a fre<U+017F>h complexion, and bux<U+017F>om plumpne<U+017F>s, do<U+017F>t thou
not call this beauty? I do <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Corilas;</hi> then tell me (replied <hi>Hylas</hi>) beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and ugline<U+017F>s, are they the Mother and the Daughter of one another, or are they
contraries? Certainly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas,</hi> beauty does never engender ugline<U+017F>s, and they
are <U+017F>o contrary, that the one cannot be without de<U+017F>truction unto the other. Then
confe<U+017F>s, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> that beauty, and ugline<U+017F>s are only in opinion: for I will <U+017F>hew
thee how that which very oft we e<U+017F>teem Fair, does <U+017F>eem very ugly unto us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as opinion commands. When a dog has a crooked no<U+017F>e, a wide mouth, large
lips, and eares hanging down to the ground, do they not <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>uch a one is a
very fair and a fine dog, and yet all the<U+017F>e are quite contrary unto what you call fair.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53527:153"/>
All this were right, replied <hi>Corilas</hi> and <U+017F>miled, if the beauty of a Woman, and the
beauty of a Dog were all one and the <U+017F>ame thing. Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e
will not pa<U+017F>s, and if thou wert but as learned as thy ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I would
ask thee que<U+017F>tions concerning Ideas of Beauty: But thou my Friend, who art not
<U+017F>o high a Flyer, I mu<U+017F>t deal with thee by demon<U+017F>trations more ea<U+017F>ie and <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible:
Thou thinke<U+017F>t that thou ha<U+017F>t given me a <U+017F>ufficient an<U+017F>wer, in <U+017F>aying, That the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Woman, and the beauty of a Dog are not the <U+017F>ame: But what wilt thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
when I <U+017F>hew thee that the beauty of Women has a contrary e<U+017F>timation: The
Gauls e<U+017F>teem white to be Beauty, the Moors e<U+017F>teem Black to be the <U+017F>ame: The
Tran<U+017F>alpines loves tho<U+017F>e that are high coloured, almo<U+017F>t red, they e<U+017F>teem great and
fat women to be the prime Beauties, the Gauls are for the <U+017F>lender and lean: The
Greeks admire the Black eye, the Gauls the Grey. All <hi>Europe</hi> e<U+017F>teem a little mouth,
red lips, and an even proportioned no<U+017F>e: The <hi>Affricans</hi> quite contrary, a wide
mouth, flapping lips, and a large <U+017F>addle no<U+017F>e: Now my good friend, prithee tell
me, wherein does Beauty con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t? If thou do<U+017F>t deny it to be in the opinion of him
that looks upon it, tell me no more that <hi>Alexis</hi> is fairer then <hi>Stella,</hi> <U+017F>ince thou
judge<U+017F>t by the Genius and Rules of thy Country, and I by mine, which is <hi>Camargue;</hi>
for I will tell thee, that according to the Rules of that place where I was born, there
is none <U+017F>o fair as <U+017F>he who plea<U+017F>eth.</p>
                     <p>Every one did laugh <U+017F>o much at the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the Incon<U+017F>tant <hi>Hylas,</hi> that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilas</hi>
could not an<U+017F>wer him: and ju<U+017F>t as he began, they heard a Shepherd begin to
<U+017F>ing, who by his voice was known to be <hi>Sylvander.</hi> All the company did pre<U+017F>ently
turn their eyes upon <hi>Hylas,</hi> as if they did advertize him, that now he was like to have
a more powerful enemy. <hi>Stella</hi> who took notice of it: Servant (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) all the
company looks upon you, to <U+017F>ee whether you begin to look pale at the encounter of
this fierce Champion: I among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t do expect to <U+017F>ee what defence you will
make of my Beauty, for I <U+017F>hould be very glad for your own honours <U+017F>ake, if you
can with honour bring about the enterprize: Not that I care for my own Intere<U+017F>t at
all, for I do know very well that if Beauty do con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in opinion, there is not a
Shepherde<U+017F>s in the world who has more of it then I have. Mi<U+017F>tris, an<U+017F>wered he, let
this Giant come when he will, I value him not, it is not the fir<U+017F>t time we have grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together. Then <U+017F>aid <hi>Corilas,</hi> I am confident the victories were never doubtful.
No more then tho<U+017F>e I obtained over you, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas.</hi> I <U+017F>hould confe<U+017F><gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Corilas,</hi> if you could per<U+017F>wade me that <hi>Stella</hi> is fairer then <hi>Alexis,</hi> you have
gotten a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ignal victory of me. It is very hard, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> to per<U+017F>wade a
man that is wilful; but I am contented that all who hear us, do judge me to be in the
right. If they do, replied <hi>Corilas,</hi> it may be <U+017F>aid that Right is without Rea<U+017F>on.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Sylvander</hi> came unto them, with a countenance of contentment
more then he had cau<U+017F>e for: For <hi>Diana,</hi> who was not able to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble her anger,
and left her countenance <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>cover it more then <U+017F>he was willing, <U+017F>he went unto
<hi>Phillis,</hi> and whi<U+017F>pered in her ear; I be<U+017F>eech you Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) do not follow me:
for I am con<U+017F>trained to go unto <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> upon a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which I forgot, and I would
not by any means draw you from this good company. I will do what<U+017F>oever you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> but I <U+017F>hall be very glad to go with you. Do what you
plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> but if you do come, let it be a little after me: Upon this <U+017F>he
went away four or five paces; and then, as if <U+017F>he had remembred <U+017F>omthing which
<U+017F>he had once forgotten, <U+017F>he turned ha<U+017F>tily back to <hi>Phillis,</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto her in a low
voice; Be <U+017F>ure Si<U+017F>ter you remember the Bracelet of my Hair, for I de<U+017F>ire you by all
means to get it from him; and afterwards I <U+017F>hall be extreamly de<U+017F>irous to hear what
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e you have had with this Lover of <hi>Madonthe.</hi> Si<U+017F>ter, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> you
believe upon too light grounds, but if you will, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak unto <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and
give you an accompt of his an<U+017F>wer. His an<U+017F>wer! <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> No Si<U+017F>ter, I de<U+017F>ire
it not, nor any thing el<U+017F>e from him, but that unfortunate Bracelet which he had of
mine; But if you will take <U+017F>o much pains as to ob<U+017F>erve his countenance and ge<U+017F>ture
when you ask it of him, you will do me a plea<U+017F>ure if you relate it unto me. I know
your mind, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis</hi> and <U+017F>miled, and therefore trouble your <U+017F>elf no further,
but commit the care of it to me. Upon this <hi>Diana</hi> went away as fa<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he could
go, and dur<U+017F>t hardly look back, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould give <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53527:153"/>
which <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to conceal. On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Astrea</hi> who were <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the company, purpo<U+017F>ely to enjoy them<U+017F>elves in freedom of di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
they were no <U+017F>ooner alone, but <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> with contentment, began thus: I cannot tell
Mi<U+017F>tris what will be the end of my Enterprize, nor how the De<U+017F>tinies will di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of
me; but this beginning is <U+017F>o infinitely plea<U+017F>ing unto me, that nothing can be added
unto my de<U+017F>ires, for I am able to <U+017F>ay, that hopes never dur<U+017F>t promi<U+017F>e unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
<U+017F>o much as the kindne<U+017F>s of my <U+017F>weet Mi<U+017F>tris hath granted unto me. Servant,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>uch is your merit, that you may well a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf of all the favours
you can de<U+017F>ire from me: But if you will oblige me, con<U+017F>ider I be<U+017F>eech you how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
the Heavens are to me in meeting with you: For having <U+017F>uch a bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the change in that woman whom I loved <U+017F>o well, and yet do love
her, that bitter memory of her is driven from my heart, by the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s which I
find in your amity, making it appear that the be<U+017F>t remedy again<U+017F>t a mi<U+017F>ery, is alwaies
the contrary. Give me leave, <U+017F>weet Mi<U+017F>tris, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> with a little <U+017F>mile, to tell
you, that by the<U+017F>e extream favours which you do me, you do make me jealous. Is
it, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>ay that I do love this Maid <U+017F>till, of who<U+017F>e change I
complain <U+017F>o much? Have I not a little rea<U+017F>on for it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Astrea?</hi> Servant <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi>
You have no rea<U+017F>on for it; for I love you as my Servant, and her as my Mi<U+017F>tris. This
an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> does not remove my jealou<U+017F>ie, but rather much more augment it,
becau<U+017F>e the love which one bears unto a Mi<U+017F>tris, does much <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s the good will
which one bears unto a Servant. Well Servant, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> to let you <U+017F>ee that I
will conform my <U+017F>elf unto any thing you would have me, I will take this cour<U+017F>e: To
cea<U+017F>e loving this woman of whom we <U+017F>peak, is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, as well becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>hall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be <U+017F>aid that I am uncon<U+017F>tant, as becau<U+017F>e it would be an unpardonable error to <U+017F>ee
<U+017F>o much merits and not love them: But to cut the thred as even as I can betwixt you,
I will love this changeling <U+017F>till, but I will love her only for your <U+017F>ake. Perhaps I
<U+017F>hould be <U+017F>atisfied with this promi<U+017F>e, if I did under<U+017F>tand it, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> My
meaning is, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> That I will love her only, becau<U+017F>e I am certain that when
you do know her, you will love her as well as I do: and if it do not prove <U+017F>o, then
I prote<U+017F>t that I will not love her: But Servant, I remember you once told me, that
you did love a Shepherd, I be<U+017F>eech you let me know who that happy man is; for if
our amity continue, as I make no que<U+017F>tion but it will, then it is not rea<U+017F>onable we
<U+017F>hould live together, as we are re<U+017F>olved to do, and let any thing be concealed from
each other. Though <hi>Alexis</hi> had a great de<U+017F>ire to know the cau<U+017F>e of his Bani<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet this que<U+017F>tion came out before <U+017F>he was well aware, otherwi<U+017F>e, her fears of
a <U+017F>harp an<U+017F>wer would doubtle<U+017F>s have <U+017F>topped her mouth: But the word being out,
and pa<U+017F>t recal, <U+017F>he expected <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> an<U+017F>wer, as a <U+017F>entence of either life or death. The
Shepherde<U+017F>s on the other <U+017F>ide, or rather the new <hi>Druide,</hi> <U+017F>he was a little troubled at
this que<U+017F>tion, and knew not well what an<U+017F>wer to return; but at la<U+017F>t, after <U+017F>he had
<U+017F>tood a while mute, <U+017F>he returned this an<U+017F>wer, with a deep <U+017F>igh: Ah Mi<U+017F>tris! you
command me to tell you a thing which hath co<U+017F>t me many a bitter tear; and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
memory of it cannot come into my mind without much <U+017F>ad re<U+017F>entment: But <U+017F>ince
I am forced unto it by your command, I will <U+017F>hut up my <U+017F>orrows within my <U+017F>oul, and
tell you, becau<U+017F>e I have made a vow never to di<U+017F>obey you. Know therefore Mi<U+017F>tris,
that the name of this Shepherd whom I loved is <hi>Celadon,</hi> and an enmity that was
betwixt our Families, was not able to give any <U+017F>top unto the affection that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us; but when we were in our highe<U+017F>t hopes of a happy conclu<U+017F>ion, Death did
ravi<U+017F>h him away from among<U+017F>t men, and made me a widdow before I was married.
This, Mi<U+017F>tris, is it that hath co<U+017F>t me a Sea of Tears, and I be<U+017F>eech you pardon me that
I make no longer a relation of it unto you: for be<U+017F>ides that I think it both out of
<U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, and impertinent; al<U+017F>o I de<U+017F>ire you to have <U+017F>o much pity upon your Servant,
as not to open a wound, which perhaps will never be cured, and which is the mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that ever any received. <hi>Alexis</hi> might well have been contented with this
an<U+017F>wer, but his extream de<U+017F>ire to know the full cau<U+017F>e of his mi<U+017F>ery, urged him to go
further, and <U+017F>ay; I am very <U+017F>orry Servant, I <U+017F>hould be any cau<U+017F>e of your <U+017F>ad re<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but you may think that this my curio<U+017F>ity is no <U+017F>mall te<U+017F>timony of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to you; and therefore if this con<U+017F>ideration have any influence upon your <U+017F>oul, I
be<U+017F>eech you tell me why and how this Shepherd died, when he was at the very top
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53527:154"/>
of all his hopes? Ah Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you touch the wound where it is mo<U+017F>t
<U+017F>ore, and yet let the pain be what it will, I cannot di<U+017F>obey you.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was ready to <U+017F>atisfie the <hi>Druide,</hi> they were at the end of the long
Walk; and when they turned back, they <U+017F>pied the Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Diana</hi> at the other
end, who was coming to them, purpo<U+017F>ely to avoid the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Sylvander. A<U+017F>trea</hi>
was very glad of this encounter, which would <U+017F>erve her for an excu<U+017F>e in not <U+017F>atisfying
the curio<U+017F>ity of <hi>Alexis;</hi> who de<U+017F>iring to have no witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, was the fir<U+017F>t which
entreated her to defer this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e until another time.</p>
                     <p>Pre<U+017F>ently after, <hi>Diana</hi> came unto them, with a countenance that <U+017F>poke the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea<U+017F>ure
<U+017F>he had received by meeting with <hi>Sylvander:</hi> And becau<U+017F>e this alteration
was very apparent, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> perceived it as <U+017F>oon as ever they <U+017F>aw her. This
moved <hi>Alexis</hi> to ask her whether <U+017F>he was not well: to whom <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered yes, but
was on the contrary much delighted at the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Hylas</hi> again<U+017F>t Beauty: But
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, he found a more ea<U+017F>ie Antagoni<U+017F>t of <hi>Corilas</hi> then he will of <hi>Sylvander.
Sylvander!</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> is he in the Country? Yes, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana</hi> faintly, he
came ju<U+017F>t as I came away, and I <U+017F>aw all the company preparing them<U+017F>elves to hear
him. Then <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>miled, and turned towards <hi>Alexis;</hi> Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her,
you need not ask <hi>Diana</hi> whether <U+017F>he be ill, for I know from whence proceeds that
alteration which we ob<U+017F>erved in her face. The rea<U+017F>on of it is, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> becau<U+017F>e
I made <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te in coming to you; and indeed I have not found my <U+017F>elf of late <U+017F>o
well as I was wont to be. This excu<U+017F>e, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> cannot hide it from us, nor
will our amity permit you <U+017F>hould be thus clo<U+017F>e unto us. Do you not con<U+017F>ider (<U+017F>aid
<hi>Diana</hi>) in who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ence you are? Very well, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> both what I <U+017F>ay, and
in who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ence; But my Mi<U+017F>tris is plea<U+017F>ed to allow us <U+017F>o much liberty and freedom,
that you ought not to u<U+017F>e any <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>timulations and di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ements, which it <U+017F>eems
you would hide your <U+017F>elf withal, both from her and me. Servant, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi>
and <U+017F>miled, unle<U+017F>s you will have me accu<U+017F>e you of the <U+017F>ame fault for which you blame
<hi>Diana,</hi> you will tell me openly what it is that <U+017F>he di<U+017F><U+017F>embles. Mi<U+017F>tris, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> pre<U+017F>ently, I cannot conceal any thing which you have a de<U+017F>ire to know: but
le<U+017F>t this Shepherde<U+017F>s <U+017F>hould have any rea<U+017F>on to complain again<U+017F>t me, I be<U+017F>eech you
command me, and I will tell you. Then I command you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> with all the
power that you have given me over you. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> offering to <U+017F>peak, <hi>Diana</hi> put her
hand before her mouth, and hindered her: But <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> putting her hand away, and
pulling <hi>Alexis</hi> betwixt them, <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, though it co<U+017F>t me my life, I will obey my
Mi<U+017F>tris in all her commands. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> Do not either hear or believe
her, for <U+017F>he cannot tell you any thing either of truth, or worth your hearing: But
if you plea<U+017F>e, you may <U+017F>pend your time much better in hearing the di<U+017F>putes between
<hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Sylvander,</hi> which cannot chu<U+017F>e but be very plea<U+017F>ant, <U+017F>ince your <U+017F>elf is
concerned in it; for the Di<U+017F>pute is betwixt your Beauty and <hi>Stellas.</hi> We will do <U+017F>o
<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>ince you will have us, though neither <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> nor I have any great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in our new Habits; and as we go, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> <U+017F>hall tell us what it is which you
are <U+017F>o <U+017F>hye in imparting to us. I would not have her tell you Fancies and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for truths, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch imaginations as cannot be told with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much offence. Then <hi>Alexis</hi> taking in each hand one, they walked that way
from whence <hi>Diana</hi> came: And <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> began thus: Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you will be
<U+017F>oon offended if what I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay will do it: For when I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my Mi<U+017F>tris that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
which <U+017F>he ob<U+017F>erves in your face proceeds only from your meeting with <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi>
do I tell any thing but what is truth? Why <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he change her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) at the <U+017F>eeing of one whom <U+017F>he <U+017F>o much loves and honours?
Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you do but look upon her, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee her face
an<U+017F>wer for me. <hi>Diana</hi> then held her hands before her eyes, and turning her head
the other way, <U+017F>he held it <U+017F>o a long while, and would not be <U+017F>een: But at la<U+017F>t, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering
that her companion would certainly tell what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to conceal, <U+017F>he
thought it better to tell it her <U+017F>elf, then <U+017F>uffer another to do it. Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he
and <U+017F>miled, What <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> tells you is a meer Imagination: but <U+017F>ince you have <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>ire
to know, I had rather tell it my <U+017F>elf, then <U+017F>uffer her; and when I have told you,
then judge what probabilities there is in the matter. You know Madam, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Wager that was betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Sylvander,</hi> this Shepherd <U+017F>eemed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53527:154"/>
long as if he had really loved me, and <U+017F>ince we have di<U+017F>covered that he is extreamly
in love with <hi>Madonthe.</hi> Who is that <hi>Madonthe?</hi> asked <hi>Alexis.</hi> A <U+017F>tranger, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who was here a while among<U+017F>t us, and one whom <hi>Diana</hi> has an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that <hi>Sylvander</hi> is in love withal. An opinion, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> Why Si<U+017F>ter do
you not po<U+017F>itively <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>he is one whom <hi>Sylvander</hi> loves as much as he can love, for
you know it to be true? Did I know it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I would <U+017F>ay as you do, but
I <U+017F>wear that I think all he does is only out of civility. Civility! cryed out <hi>Diana,</hi>
Do you call it Civility to cry, to pray, to beg, to importune, and to kneel at the
feet of <hi>Madonthe,</hi> to get leave that he may follow her? If this be civility, then I
do not know what is Love. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you believe all that <hi>Laonice</hi> tells
you, and I would have you <U+017F>u<U+017F>pend your Belief, until the Shepherd return, that
you may have the truth from his own mouth. Fie, fie Friend, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak thus: Would you have me look for any truth from the mouth
of a Man? a man in Love? Or (to <U+017F>peak all in one word) from a <hi>Sylvander?</hi> from
him that thinks he can by the volubility of wit and tongue blind the eyes of our
mind, as Juglers do the eyes of our Body? No, no, there is no credit to be given
unto any thing he <U+017F>ays. Why <U+017F>hould you think, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that <hi>Sylvander</hi> loves
any but your <U+017F>elf? I never thought he loved me, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> nor ever had
any intention to <U+017F>uffer him. Surely, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you had an opinion once that he
did love you; but if he did not, why <U+017F>hould he take <U+017F>o much pains about you as he
did? To pa<U+017F>s away his time, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> or becau<U+017F>e he had nothing el<U+017F>e to do.
Do you think, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that <U+017F>o fine a Wit as <hi>Sylvanders</hi> can find it <U+017F>elf nothing
to do but to trifle away his time about one whom he loves not? You may remember
Si<U+017F>ter, if you plea<U+017F>e, how that Shepherd lived before he ca<U+017F>t any amorous eye upon
you, and compare that time with the time of his love unto you, and con<U+017F>ider what
a difference there was; which of your commands, nay the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>haddow of your
will did he not ob<U+017F>erve as a Law inviolable? To be brief Si<U+017F>ter, Tell me what greater
reverence he could render unto any Grandee upon earth, nay unto the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
then he hath alwaies done unto you? And whether there be not certain <U+017F>ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes,
<U+017F>igns, and con<U+017F>equents of a real love, let any hearer judge? Si<U+017F>ter, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o highly in behalf of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I believe you think
as you <U+017F>ay; But I who never <U+017F>aw, nor will <U+017F>ee any <U+017F>uch matters, I will believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of <hi>Laonice;</hi> and if tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>igns which you have ob<U+017F>erved in him be any te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Love, they may be of his love to <hi>Madonthe.</hi> No replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> for I
have heard him in my pre<U+017F>ence <U+017F>ay a hundred and an hundred times, that it is you,
and you only whom he loves. It is the common quality of men, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi>
thus to delude tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>illy women who hear them: and do you not think he has <U+017F>aid
as much in private unto his dear <hi>Madonthe?</hi> But if I be not much deceived, he never
<U+017F>aid as much to me, nor ever <U+017F>hall. I perceive, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> you are apt to believe
all that is <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t <hi>Sylvander,</hi> as confidently as if you had <U+017F>een it your <U+017F>elf. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it is true: But I am contented to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
him with all my heart, and will believe all that <hi>Laonice</hi> has told me. Me thinks
<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> you are over-apt, and too partial to believe the reports of that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
you ought to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pend your belief and judgement, till you hear him an<U+017F>wer
for him<U+017F>elf. Ah Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you that I care <U+017F>o little either for his
love or hate, as I would not have one word more <U+017F>pent about the matter: For do
you think to draw truth from a fal<U+017F>e and di<U+017F><U+017F>embling tongue? For my part, <U+017F>aid
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I cannot believe him in any fault: But if he be in fault, his fault is his love
unto <hi>Madonthe;</hi> now when <U+017F>he is gone, his fault will appear; and if he be in no
fault, then he will continue his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>till unto you. I do not think (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>)
that he will continue them. But if he do continue them, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> what will you
<U+017F>ay then? I will <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> that he will be a<U+017F>hamed to <U+017F>hew his Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy.
If he was a<U+017F>hamed of that, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> he would not have <U+017F>o freely di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
it before all tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>aw him take his leave of <hi>Madonthe.</hi> Perhaps, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Diana,</hi> he was not <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olute a ma<U+017F>ter of him<U+017F>elf, but he was <U+017F>urprized with
this <U+017F>udden and unexpected departure; <U+017F>o as though he be his Arts ma<U+017F>ter in matter
of lying, yet he could not chu<U+017F>e but upon <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>urprize di<U+017F>cover the truth. But
Si<U+017F>ter, why <U+017F>hould we <U+017F>pend <U+017F>o much time about a thing which is not worth it? Let
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53527:155"/>
us leave <hi>Sylvander</hi> to his beloved <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and have no more memory of him then
he has of us; for I believe his <U+017F>oul is capable of no thought but his <U+017F>orrows at this
<U+017F>ad <U+017F>eparation.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es were thus di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing, pre<U+017F>ently after <hi>Dianas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from <hi>Phillis, Sylvander</hi> came to the place from which <hi>Diana</hi> went; and he
had hardly <U+017F>aluted all the company before <hi>Hylas</hi> acco<U+017F>ted him.</p>
                     <p>Will you, <U+017F>ay <hi>Sylvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) that <hi>Diana</hi> is Fairer then <hi>Stella?</hi>
Will you deny <hi>Hylas</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) that the Sun is cleerer then Darkne<U+017F>s? All the
Company began to laugh at the an<U+017F>wer of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and the que<U+017F>tion of <hi>Hylas:</hi>
but <hi>Hylas</hi> without being at all daunted, I will maintain (<U+017F>aid he) that <hi>Stella</hi> does
not only equal, but much excel the beauty of <hi>Diana.</hi> I do not wonder at what you
<U+017F>ay (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) but yet me thinks thy very ignorance <U+017F>hould have made a
better judgment then <U+017F>o; I <U+017F>hould an<U+017F>wer you after another manner (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) if
I had not right on my <U+017F>ide, and if I did not think to make you confe<U+017F>s before we
part in the pre<U+017F>ence of all the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, that <hi>Stella</hi> is fairer then <hi>Diana,</hi> at
the lea<U+017F>t if you will an<U+017F>wer me. Doubt not but I will an<U+017F>wer unto all you <U+017F>hall ask,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander</hi> and <U+017F>miled, but if you make me confe<U+017F>s what you affirm, and which
I can never believe, I will <U+017F>ay you can do more then is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, and makes u<U+017F>e of
<U+017F>ome enchantment. The enchantments which I will u<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>hall be
the <U+017F>trength of my rea<U+017F>ons, of which, not you, but all the company <U+017F>hall judge:
therefore <hi>Sylvander,</hi> an<U+017F>wer unto this que<U+017F>tion; How Fair do you think <hi>Diana</hi> to
be? As Fair, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> as any woman can be. And I, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> do
think <hi>Stella</hi> to be Fairer then any Woman in the world can be: thus you <U+017F>ee <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi>
how you have <U+017F>poken truth before you were aware; you hold the beauty of
<hi>Diana,</hi> only in the comparative degree, but I <hi>Stellas</hi> in the <U+017F>uperlative: If opinion,
replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> were to end the difference, or were that which makes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
more or le<U+017F>s Fair, then I <U+017F>hould confe<U+017F>s that in this argument you have in <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>ort the advantage of me. But how gro<U+017F>ly are you deceived if you have that belief;
for beauty is the perfection of that which hath it: and can you <U+017F>ay that perfection
is only an imagination? But can you deny, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> that beauty, even the
beauty of Women, is any thing el<U+017F>e but the opinion of him who <U+017F>ees it? For if it were
otherwi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he who <U+017F>eems Fair unto one, would <U+017F>eem Fair unto all eyes, which holds
fal<U+017F>e in the opinion that you have of the beauty of <hi>Diana,</hi> and the greater beauty of
<hi>Stella.</hi> The ground you build upon, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> is <U+017F>uch a loo<U+017F>e <U+017F>and, that it
mu<U+017F>t needs fall pre<U+017F>ently to ruine: for it is not opinion which <U+017F>ets a value upon things,
but their own proper quality which is in them; for otherwi<U+017F>e a piece of Gla<U+017F>s or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimy
well wrought and counterfeited, were as good as Gold, or a right Diamond,
for they are oftentimes thought to be as good as the other: but <hi>Hylas,</hi> you know
from whence this opinion has its ri<U+017F>e; even from nothing but ignorance: for if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
knew that the Alchimy, and the Gla<U+017F>s, were counterfeit; they would never <U+017F>et
<U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teem upon them: the very like is of the judgement which you make of
<hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Stella;</hi> for did you know what beauty is, you would give a <U+017F>ound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not ra<U+017F>hly at random as you do: for my part, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> I cannot
think my <U+017F>elf in any error, I have mo<U+017F>t men on my <U+017F>ide; and mo<U+017F>t ignorants al<U+017F>o,
replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> yet if you will refer it unto the vote of this company, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
you will find very few on your <U+017F>ide: for as there is commonly more <U+017F>ound
then <U+017F>ick per<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>o there are more <U+017F>ound then <U+017F>imple judgements, otherwi<U+017F>e na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was defective in her works, and did not accompli<U+017F>h them according to the
right rule, which to think, were a bla<U+017F>phemy both again<U+017F>t her, and the God of
Nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvander</hi> having an ample field for his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, would have continued it longer,

                     <p>I know <hi>Sylvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) that it will be a very dear year when you want words:
but an<U+017F>wer me to this; If beauty be not meer opinion, then how comes it to pa<U+017F>s
that one <U+017F>hould affect the grey eye, another the black, a third the brown, and every
one according to their <U+017F>everal fancies; is this from ignorance? whole Provinces we

ea<U+017F>ily an<U+017F>wered: I know the <hi>Gaules</hi> are for grey eyes; the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> black,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53527:155"/>
becau<U+017F>e the women there are commonly black, and the <hi>Gaules</hi> white: now <hi>Hylas,</hi>
can you fancy that white eyes, and white hair, would <U+017F>hew well upon a black com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;
or black hair or eyes upon a white complexion? But <hi>Hylas,</hi> all the<U+017F>e an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments

have I committed again<U+017F>t thy power? Doubtle<U+017F>s it is <U+017F>ome great one, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me to be <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>tly condemned for a fault which I never committed, and which
I never will commit. The<U+017F>e expo<U+017F>tulations, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and interrupted him, are all
in vain, for you know, the God of Love is Priviledged above all the re<U+017F>t of the Gods,
and that Heaven never puni<U+017F>heth his fal<U+017F>ities. But Shepherde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> do
you and <hi>Diana</hi> al<U+017F>o believe that I have no good will unto her? I do not <U+017F>ay that I

rea<U+017F>on to Love you: for do you think <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that <U+017F>he is a Shepherde<U+017F>s that will
be contented to be a pretence for your affection unto another? Do you find <U+017F>o little

deceive <U+017F>uch as do not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect any trea<U+017F>on in them; but when notice is taken of them
which rubbed a little, it will pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>hew its fal<U+017F>ity. There is nothing comparable

to a free, cleer, and genuine way in all things; <U+017F>ubtilties, tricks, and fetches, are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a vile and ba<U+017F>e Spirit. I do confe<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) all that you <U+017F>ay, but
I be<U+017F>eech you what have I done? You know, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> better then any: the
thing is made publique, and if you will have it from my mouth, I <U+017F>ay <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that
you have made a <U+017F>hew of loving <hi>Diana,</hi> whil<U+017F>t you have given your whole <U+017F>oul and

laughs at it; <hi>Diana</hi> her <U+017F>elf among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t makes it her rallery; if you be <U+017F>orry
for any thing, it is, that <hi>Diana</hi> cares not for your Love: It is a great credit indeed
to be courted by an unknown vagabond Shepherd as you are; e<U+017F>pecially to her who is
to eminent in virtue and merit; but all our <U+017F>orrows proceeds from our being <U+017F>o much

di<U+017F><U+017F>imulations? How could you imagine you <U+017F>hould continue long undi<U+017F>covered?

<hi>Sylvander,</hi> when you made <U+017F>o bad a choi<U+017F>e? Can <hi>Diana</hi> believe all this? replied
<hi>Sylvander:</hi> Believe it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> why <U+017F>hould <U+017F>he not believe it, when every one

why tears when you bade adieu? and why that un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable voyage which you made
with her? Now <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I tell you all this, not that <hi>Diana</hi> cares a ru<U+017F>h for it,
but on the contrary, <U+017F>he thanks God, that <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o well rid of all your importunities

                     <p>Thus <U+017F>poke <hi>Phillis</hi> unto <hi>Sylvander,</hi> not that <U+017F>he had any commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion for it from
<hi>Diana,</hi> who<U+017F>e mode<U+017F>ty was <U+017F>uch, and Spirit <U+017F>o great, that <U+017F>he had rather have died

did it, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was angry with that Shepherd, and re<U+017F>ented the injury done
unto her Companion, as her own, And well it was they were <U+017F>o far from the re<U+017F>t

was greater then <hi>Phillis</hi> expected. His regret to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf accu<U+017F>ed of a fault which
he never committed; the lo<U+017F>s of <hi>Dianas</hi> favour which he hoped that he had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the har<U+017F>h language of <hi>Phillis,</hi> which he <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed came from his Mi<U+017F>tris,
all the<U+017F>e did <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e him, that he was not able to utter one word; he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained

ground, where <U+017F>uch a faintne<U+017F>s of heart <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ed upon him, that within a little time,
he was immoveable, and without any <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who <U+017F>aw him in this condition,
did pull him <U+017F>everal times by the arm, and afterwards, <U+017F>eeing him ready to dye, <U+017F>he
ran to a little Rivelet which was clo<U+017F>e by, and taking <U+017F>ome water in her hands, <U+017F>he
came and threw it in his face: but the<U+017F>e remedies doing no good, <U+017F>he was extreamly
affrighted, and ran that way which <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw all the company pa<U+017F>s, to call <U+017F>ome to

was the fir<U+017F>t that heard her, and fearing that <U+017F>ome mi<U+017F>chance had hapned unto her:
I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto the re<U+017F>t, let us make all the ha<U+017F>te we can to help <hi>Phillis;</hi>

for I <U+017F>ee her run and make <U+017F>igns, certainly <U+017F>he <U+017F>tands in need of us. Upon this all
of them doubled their pace; and <hi>Diana,</hi> as if <U+017F>ome Demon had in<U+017F>pired her, did
feel <U+017F>uch a kind of unaccu<U+017F>tomed temper upon her heart, as made her almo<U+017F>t divine
what the matter was. When <hi>Phillis</hi> was come nearer, and within di<U+017F>tance of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Oh <hi>Diana! Diana!</hi> cryed <U+017F>he out, <hi>Sylvander</hi> is dead! <hi>Sylvander</hi> is dead!
<hi>Sylvander!</hi> replied <hi>Diana,</hi> who killed him? You and I, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> you in
commanding me, and I in obeying you. At this <hi>Diana</hi> was <U+017F>eized with <U+017F>o much
<U+017F>orrow, that <U+017F>he could not <U+017F>peak a word, nor go one foot further; making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that in her heart <U+017F>he never believed what was reported of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and
that what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid again<U+017F>t him, was only words of an offended Love, which was
prone to jealou<U+017F>ie. <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> on the contrary, who did highly e<U+017F>teem the
vertue and merit of that Shepherd, Alas, alas, <U+017F>aid they, is he dead? It is but too
true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> his face is pale, and all tears; do but follow me a little, and
you <U+017F>hall find him in the condition I tell you. Then both of them began to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her as fa<U+017F>t as they could, they pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>aw him lying all along upon the ground,
and in the <U+017F>ame condition <hi>Phillis</hi> left him. <hi>Diana</hi> who followed a <U+017F>lower pace after
them, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould too much di<U+017F>cover that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired to hide, <U+017F>he
no <U+017F>ooner ca<U+017F>t her eye upon the Shepherd, but her cheeks were all tears, which <U+017F>he
was not able to with hold, and which to te<U+017F>tifie the <U+017F>orrows of her heart, forced
their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through her eye-lids: And becau<U+017F>e the mode<U+017F>ty of this Shepherde<U+017F>s
would not permit her to di<U+017F>cover this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>he <U+017F>tayed ten or twelve paces from
her companions, and turned her <U+017F>elf fromwards them, <U+017F>eeming as if the accident did
not trouble her. But <hi>Alexis, A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> out of abundance of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
were very bu<U+017F>ie about him; one lifted up his arm, another his head, and a third
feeling if his heart did beat; but finding no <U+017F>ignes of life in him, they gave over all
hopes, and <U+017F>aid unto one another that he was dead. The<U+017F>e words reaching the
ears of <hi>Diana,</hi> were <U+017F>o many <U+017F>harp <U+017F>words, which wounded her heart with new <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:
and coming unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>he whi<U+017F>pered her in the ear; Good Si<U+017F>ter <U+017F>eek a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his arm for the Bracelet which you know of, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould be found. <hi>Phillis</hi> to
give her companion <U+017F>atisfaction, and thinking that <U+017F>he had good rea<U+017F>on to de<U+017F>ire
that none <U+017F>hould know of it, <U+017F>he took the Shepherds arm, and pulled off the Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let;
But as <U+017F>he was untying it, <U+017F>he and her companions al<U+017F>o <U+017F>pied a mark which in all
probability he had worn from his Mothers womb; it was a branch of Mi<U+017F>leto, <U+017F>o
plain, that any might know it to be <U+017F>o; for the leaves, the berries, and the knots of
Branches, although they were not green, yet were <U+017F>o perfectly marked, that none
could doubt it to be Mi<U+017F>leto.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t they were bu<U+017F>ie in looking upon this Mi<U+017F>leto, and untying the Bracelet, and
<hi>Diana</hi> at a good di<U+017F>tance from them, <hi>Sylvander</hi> revived out of his <U+017F>woon; but <U+017F>o
much amazed to <U+017F>ee him<U+017F>elf in this condition, and among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es,
that he knew not whether he dreamed or waked. All three did not a little rejoyce
to <U+017F>ee him alive, after they had lamented his death; for the vertue and merit of that
Shepherd, did get the love of all that knew him. When he revived, <hi>Phillis</hi> had not
quite untied the Bracelet; and though he perceived they had unloo<U+017F>ed his <U+017F>leeve,
yet he did not perceive the theft, but thought that they only untied his <U+017F>leeve to feel
his pul<U+017F>e. <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>eeing that he <U+017F>pake not a word, but let them do what they would
unto him, <U+017F>he thought it good to begin. Shepherd, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, How comes
this to pa<U+017F>s? What? Does your Courage fail you? <hi>Sylvander</hi> taking <hi>Alexis</hi> for a
Shepherde<U+017F>s by rea<U+017F>on of her Habit, he thanked her and her companions for the
pains they had taken about him, and then told them, that it was rather a <U+017F>igne of
want of courage to endure the mi<U+017F>eries which he re<U+017F>ented, and not die. No, no,
<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you are deceived, for it is courage to <U+017F>urmount all manner of accidents
what<U+017F>oever: and believe me, your mi<U+017F>ery is not <U+017F>o great, but being a man you may
ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>urmount it. <hi>Phillis</hi> who feared that this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e would renew his grief,
Come, come, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, Let us talk no longer of mi<U+017F>eries and di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters, but let us think
how to cure them. <hi>Sylvander</hi> then an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> taking her for a <hi>Druide</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e

conduct me ere long unto a place where I hope to find a cure, though that Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s
think it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible. Upon this, thanking them for their help, he offered to go
away: But all of them con<U+017F>idering how wildly and ragingly his eyes looked, they
were afraid that he would kill him<U+017F>elf. <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> as be<U+017F>t experienced in the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<U+017F>he took hold of his arm, and <U+017F>eeing that he took her for a <hi>Druide,</hi> Know
Shepherd, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, that the Genius of whom you <U+017F>peak, commanded me
to come hither, as well to help you, as to tell you for him, That he would have you
live with a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, that his aid <U+017F>hall never fail you, neither in this occa<U+017F>ion, nor

and I take all the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es to witne<U+017F>s that I have told you. Upon this <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>
who counterfeited her voice as well as <U+017F>he could le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be known, <U+017F>he went
away, <U+017F>eeming as if <U+017F>he did not know any of the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es in the company, and
as if her coming thither were only upon that occa<U+017F>ion. Now, <U+017F>ee what power an
opinion of Divine a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance has over the <U+017F>pirits of men; <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner
pronounced the<U+017F>e words, but <hi>Sylvander</hi> received them as coming from an Oracle:
<U+017F>o as beginning to hope again, tho<U+017F>e wilde and raging looks which de<U+017F>pair had
brought into his eyes, did leave them, and his countenance became more calm and
<U+017F>etled: Afterwards with a religious look, he kneeled down upon the ground, lifted
his hands and eyes up to heaven, and uncovering his head, he <U+017F>aid: From you, oh
omnipotent <hi>Tautates</hi> and <hi>Tharamis,</hi> Do I expect that help which from no other I
can hope for: You know my puni<U+017F>hment to be unju<U+017F>t, and that I am not guilty of
that fault for which I am condemned: Help, therefore, Oh great Gods! tho<U+017F>e
injured per<U+017F>ons who tru<U+017F>t in you. <hi>Alexis</hi> who <U+017F>aw <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> go away, and who
could not endure to be from her, <U+017F>he intended to follow: and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was afraid
le<U+017F>t the Shepherd <U+017F>hould know her in <hi>Astreas</hi> clothes, <U+017F>he would <U+017F>tay no longer:
upon the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, they made a <U+017F>igne unto <hi>Phillis</hi> to <U+017F>tay with him a while,
le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould follow them: At parting, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto him, Remember Shepherd
you follow the good advice your good Genius hath given you, and take heed you do
not make your <U+017F>elf incapable of that help and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance which he hath promi<U+017F>ed. Then
not <U+017F>taying for his an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>he went away towards <hi>Astrea,</hi> whom <U+017F>he quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took:
And it <U+017F>eems that Heaven would have <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> render the <U+017F>ame Office

                     <p>When <hi>Phillis</hi> was alone with <hi>Sylvander,</hi> <U+017F>he was much moved to think what harm
<U+017F>he had done him, which indeed was much more then ever <U+017F>he intended: Shepherd,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, <U+017F>ince heaven has taken care of your conduct, I hope you will find
more contentment then ever yet you did: but I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, and tell me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniou<U+017F>ly
and freely, and with an a<U+017F><U+017F>urance that you tell it unto one of your be<U+017F>t
friends, and one that can keep a <U+017F>ecret, and will, if it concern your good: Is it true
or no that you love <hi>Madonthe?</hi> It is not a crime unpardonable to love a fair woman
as <U+017F>he is: There is none but does know that it was the wager which was betwixt us
did give beginning unto the Love which you bore unto <hi>Diana;</hi> a thing which cannot
oblige you any longer then the time of the wager, and the cau<U+017F>e which gave it a

                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Phillis</hi> was <U+017F>peaking to this purpo<U+017F>e unto <hi>Sylvander, Diana</hi> though <U+017F>he
went away before the Shepherd revived, yet <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him ri<U+017F>e up, for <U+017F>he was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
turning and looking back to <U+017F>ee what would become of him: And when <U+017F>he
<U+017F>aw he was not dead, as <U+017F>he once thought that he was, for all her anger, <U+017F>he could
not chu<U+017F>e but be extreamly glad, and re<U+017F>ented as much joy, as her apprehen<U+017F>ions of
his death cau<U+017F>ed <U+017F>orrow. Her jealou<U+017F>ie and anger had <U+017F>o much power, as to make
her <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the offence which <U+017F>he thought was given her, but not to extingui<U+017F>h
the affection which really <U+017F>he had unto that Shepherd; and upon this occa<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>he
gave an apparent proof of it; <U+017F>ince <U+017F>eeing <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> go away, and pre<U+017F>ently after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi>

Shepherd you mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t clear your <U+017F>elf unto me, and give me your rea<U+017F>ons why yon
were <U+017F>o officious and indulgent towards <hi>Madonthe.</hi> You know <hi>Sylvander</hi> that Love is
like a little child, &amp; is offended at a <U+017F>mall thing, <U+017F>oon angry, &amp; as <U+017F>oon jealous: do you
think tho<U+017F>e extraordinary indulgencies which you manife<U+017F>ted unto <hi>Madonthe,</hi> the tears
you <U+017F>hed at her departure, the earne<U+017F>t <U+017F>upplications you made to wait upon her into
<hi>Aquitain,</hi> nay to go with her, almo<U+017F>t whether <U+017F>he would or no; do you think I
<U+017F>ay, that all the<U+017F>e circum<U+017F>tances coming to the knowledg of <hi>Diana,</hi> are not <U+017F>ufficient
enough to make her offended at you? Ought you not to have con<U+017F>idered, that as
<hi>Madonthe</hi> would not <U+017F>uffer you to follow her any further, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould offend
<hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> whom <U+017F>he loved, <U+017F>o you ought not to have made the motion, for fear
of making <hi>Diana</hi> jealous, whom you loved? Could you hope for any better looks
from her at your return then now you have? For my part, I think <U+017F>he has obliged
you in treating you thus, and no otherwi<U+017F>e: for if <U+017F>he had, you might have thought
her to be in a <U+017F>tate of a cold indifferency towards you, which is a mo<U+017F>t certain <U+017F>ign
of <U+017F>mall good will.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Phillis</hi> talked thus, <hi>Diana</hi> who lo<U+017F>t not a <U+017F>illable of what <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, did <U+017F>o
approve of it, that if any had <U+017F>een her, they might ea<U+017F>ily have known her di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.
For when <hi>Phillis</hi> talked upon tho<U+017F>e points which touched her mo<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he made <U+017F>uch
actions with her head, her hands, and every part of her body, as plainly <U+017F>hewed

him, <U+017F>ee the crafty man (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to her <U+017F>elf) he knows not what to an<U+017F>wer, and
he would have her make a repetition, that he may invent an excu<U+017F>e in the mean time;
and then <U+017F>he heard <hi>Phillis</hi> reply unto him thus; Confe<U+017F>s freely your fault <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
here is none to hear or ob<U+017F>erve your actions; or if they do, none that will tell <hi>Diana:</hi> I
do believe al<U+017F>o, that <U+017F>he who acquainted her with the<U+017F>e things, did not think any
harm, for <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke very <U+017F>imply and innocently: I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
what did <U+017F>he <U+017F>ay? She <U+017F>aid, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that you your <U+017F>elf were in<U+017F>trumental
to your own hurt, of which, afterwards you could not cure your <U+017F>elf: for meeting
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> you acquainted her with the coming of that <U+017F>tranger, who had <U+017F>ome
bad de<U+017F>igns upon her: It is mo<U+017F>t true, an<U+017F>wered the Shepherd, I did <U+017F>o: and I
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53527:158"/>
thought my <U+017F>elf obliged unto it by the Laws of Civility. The Laws of Civility did
not enjoyn you to accompany her as far as <hi>Aquitane,</hi> replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> much le<U+017F>s
when <U+017F>he denied you, to fall upon your knees, and with a torrent of tears, beg, nay
force her to give leave you might wait upon her, at the lea<U+017F>t, part of a dayes journey;
telling her, after your tears had obtained leave, that <U+017F>he might well permit you the
happine<U+017F>s of <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a time, <U+017F>ince you were to endure <U+017F>o long a torment of ab<U+017F>ence
from her. But here comes the mi<U+017F>ery of it: when <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered you with a <U+017F>mile,
that though her ab<U+017F>ence did grieve, yet the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Diana</hi> would comfort you:
you an<U+017F>wered again, <hi>Diana</hi> merits much more then my <U+017F>ervice, but I pay them unto
her only upon a wager: I wi<U+017F>h <U+017F>he were to go this journey in your room, and you
to <U+017F>tay in hers here in this Country. Do you think Shepherd that any Laws of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
oblige you to u<U+017F>e any <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e unto <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and to <U+017F>peak with <U+017F>uch
<U+017F>corn of <hi>Diana?</hi> Do you think it <U+017F>trange <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be offended at you, and re<U+017F>olve
to take all occa<U+017F>ions from you, of treating her <U+017F>o unworthily? Oh Heavens! Oh
Earth! Oh God! Oh <hi>Diana!</hi> (cri'd <hi>Sylvander</hi>) What trea<U+017F>on is invented again<U+017F>t
me? Trea<U+017F>on, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) why? Can you deny it? How? replied the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
pre<U+017F>ently, I <U+017F>ay or do any <U+017F>uch things as the<U+017F>e; I had rather my Sheep-hook
were run through my heart, then any <U+017F>uch thoughts <U+017F>hould be in it; do you deny
(replied <hi>Phillis</hi>) that you accompanied <hi>Madonthe,</hi> as far as <U+017F>he would permit you?
I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that it is true, I did accompany her, but it was
upon <U+017F>uch rea<U+017F>ons, as if I have done otherwi<U+017F>e, I had been blamed by all tho<U+017F>e that
heard of it; and that you may know the truth, give me leave to make a <U+017F>hort relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it unto you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diana</hi> hearing <hi>Sylvander</hi> prepare him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>peak; I am confident (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he to
her <U+017F>elf) that if one word of truth be in his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, it is again<U+017F>t his will and de<U+017F>ign;
but <U+017F>ee with what a brazen face he <U+017F>ets him<U+017F>elf to lie: Then <hi>Sylvander</hi> began thus;
Shepherde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid he) it is long <U+017F>ince <hi>Paris</hi> was telling how that <U+017F>tranger was come
into the Country, with a bad de<U+017F>ign upon <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and when I <U+017F>aw him much
troubled how he <U+017F>hould acquaint her with it, I took upon me to make it known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her: he does not tell (replied <hi>Diana</hi> to her <U+017F>elf) how ready he was to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
in this <U+017F>ervice, le<U+017F>t any other <U+017F>hould undertake that charitable office. In the
mean time <hi>Sylvander</hi> went on with his <U+017F>tory. Ye<U+017F>terday morning (<U+017F>aid he) I met
her with <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and I thought the blame of all the accident might be charged
upon me, if I did not acquaint her, I told her therefore as it was told me, and <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her eyes flow in tears, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I was much moved unto compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: nay
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion you <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>aid, (replied <hi>Diana</hi> to her <U+017F>elf) And I to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure her (<U+017F>aid
<hi>Sylvander</hi>) again<U+017F>t the injuries of this unknown per<U+017F>on, I offered my <U+017F>elf to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
her with <U+017F>ome of my friends, if <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>ed. He is her Champion (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>)
and will defend her again<U+017F>t all her enemies. And <U+017F>o I did (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) but it
was no further then the place where <hi>Paris</hi> <U+017F>aw that <U+017F>tranger: It was (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>)
becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not <U+017F>uffer him to go any further. Could I do any le<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi>)
unle<U+017F>s I tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F><U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t the Laws of Civility and Humanity? If I did
any more, then what I have told you Shepherde<U+017F>s, may I be denied Heaven, and
peri<U+017F>h eternally as a puni<U+017F>hment of my crime. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> did you not follow
her as far as <hi>Aquitane,</hi> or would you not if <U+017F>he had permitted you? Had I thought,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>tood in need of me, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, I had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
her farther, thinking it the duty of man to help any in di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, Hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> we <U+017F>hall have this Shepherd become the <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and
wander from Province to Province, to fight with Giants and Mon<U+017F>ters. But, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he, that I <U+017F>hould be importunate, or pre<U+017F>s her, or do any more then civilly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire
her, is a thing <U+017F>o fal<U+017F>e, as I admire any <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o impudent as to invent it, or
<U+017F>ay it. None more likely then <hi>Sylvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) 'Tis true, I did offer my <U+017F>elf
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) to be her convoy, and guard her till <U+017F>he was out of Forre<U+017F>ts. But
is it true, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that you did not <U+017F>hed any tears, nor kneel down, nor
<U+017F>peak of <hi>Diana,</hi> nor lament her departure? Now, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> is he pumping, and
preparing him<U+017F>elf for a lie. Shepherde<U+017F>s, (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander</hi>) if any one <U+017F>illable
of all the<U+017F>e be true, let the Ju<U+017F>tice of Heaven <U+017F>trike me dead immediately; let the
earth <U+017F>wallow me up alive, and never let me <U+017F>ee the face of men again; let the anger
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53527:158"/>
of Gods and men do all their wor<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t me, if all that you have <U+017F>aid unto me be
not fal<U+017F>e, and invented by <U+017F>ome who wi<U+017F>h my death, and has <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>igns upon
<hi>Diana.</hi> Now has he hit upon it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> for what preten<U+017F>ions or de<U+017F>igns can
<hi>Laonice</hi> have upon me, or his life? Shepherd (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) when you know who
it is, certainly you will be of another mind: But you mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s a fault in
accompanying this Shepherde<U+017F>s without asking leave of your Mi<U+017F>tris. Ah Si<U+017F>ter,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you give no <U+017F>uch Name unto me, that Shepherd <U+017F>hall be none
of my Servant. You know <hi>Sylvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that one who loves truly, ought
never to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of him<U+017F>elf without the Will of the party loved; why then would
you go away and never tell her? He is at a non-plus, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> and knows not
what to <U+017F>ay. Certainly an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> if the journey which I was to take had
de<U+017F>erved the name of a journey, I had done as you <U+017F>ay; but <U+017F>ince it was not above
two or three miles, I thought neither <U+017F>he nor you could take any exceptions: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides,
<hi>Madonthe</hi> departed <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to have done it,
unle<U+017F>s I had failed in doing her that civil office. Ob<U+017F>erve (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) that rather
then fail <hi>Madonthe,</hi> he will fail in his duty to us. But it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>)
that the excellent wit of my Mi<U+017F>tris (Raze out the words, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> unle<U+017F>s
you <U+017F>peak of <hi>Madonthe.</hi>) It is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>ay, (continued he,) that the
Judgement of <hi>Diana,</hi> which is never deceived, (Unle<U+017F>s in you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily believe <U+017F>uch a fal<U+017F>ity: But good Shepherde<U+017F>s tell me, If it were true that
I were in love with <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and had taken upon me that office which <hi>Paris</hi> gave
me, to acquaint her and <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander</hi> with the coming of this <U+017F>tranger; If I <U+017F>ay, I
was <U+017F>o greedy and affectionate to take it upon me, can you think my violent love
would have let me <U+017F>tay <U+017F>o long before I acquainted her? Yet if <hi>Diana</hi> plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he
may remember I received this Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion the <U+017F>ame day that we went unto <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
and I did not acquaint them before ye<U+017F>terday. Believe it Shepherde<U+017F>s, tho<U+017F>e
that are enflamed with Love, are <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>o <U+017F>low in rendring <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ervices, or to <U+017F>ay
better, in forgetting them as I did: for I <U+017F>wear that I never thought upon it till I
<U+017F>aw them; and had I not <U+017F>een them, I think I <U+017F>hould have never remembred it. But
I be<U+017F>eech you con<U+017F>ider, that if I were <U+017F>o far in love with this woman, as you <U+017F>eem
by your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to believe, why <U+017F>hould I not follow her whither<U+017F>oever <U+017F>he went?
What con<U+017F>ideration <U+017F>hould <U+017F>tay me in this Country? unle<U+017F>s my love to <hi>Diana,</hi> I
know no occa<U+017F>ions I have el<U+017F>e in it, more then any where el<U+017F>e: My mi<U+017F>erable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
is <U+017F>uch, that I have neither Parents or E<U+017F>tate to <U+017F>tay me, nor do I get any thing
here more then my indu<U+017F>try would get me in any other place. If then I do not leave
this Country to follow <hi>Madonthe,</hi> me-thinks it <U+017F>hould be a <U+017F>tronger argument unto
my Mi<U+017F>tris and you, that I do not love <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and that nothing <U+017F>tays me here
but the love of <hi>Diana.</hi> But I be<U+017F>eech you <hi>Phillis,</hi> Did you not <U+017F>ee that I did not
love her before our Wager? I know you will confe<U+017F>s you never <U+017F>aw the lea<U+017F>t inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in me that way: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, that naturally I am not prone unto that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
But then the conver<U+017F>ation which I have had with <hi>Diana,</hi> has forced me to <U+017F>erve her;
<U+017F>he has ravi<U+017F>hed my heart. I cannot tell what you have thought of me <U+017F>ince I have
had the honour to live among<U+017F>t you; yet I think you have had a good opinion of
me, and thought me not without <U+017F>ome Wit and Judgement, till this action whereof
I am accu<U+017F>ed, and which is a di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter <U+017F>o fatal, that I cannot tell whether the poor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra<U+017F>tes</hi>
had a greater. What a gro<U+017F>s defect in Wit and Judgement were it, to chu<U+017F>e
<hi>Madonthe,</hi> and reject <hi>Diana? Diana!</hi> the faire<U+017F>t, the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t, and the mo<U+017F>t accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>hed
woman in the whole Univer<U+017F>e; and <hi>Madonthe,</hi> who only merits to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teemed
in her re<U+017F>emblance of <hi>Diana,</hi> though in an inferiour degree of perfection.
Moreover, were it not madne<U+017F>s in the highe<U+017F>t degree, if I knowing that <hi>Madonthe</hi>
does love a Cavalier, and wanders in que<U+017F>t of him, if I <U+017F>hould pretend to divert
her: The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations are <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong that when I reflect upon them, I cannot
chu<U+017F>e but admire at the opinion which you have conceived of me, and fear, that
heaven which from my birth hath condemned me unto <U+017F>o many misfortunes, will have
the end of my life like the beginning.</p>
                     <p>The Shepherd had many other arguments, and was full of <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this,
unto which <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> did hearken with much attention; for though the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Diana</hi> was extreamly prejudicated, yet being rational, the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53527:159"/>
did work upon her heart, and made her think there was <U+017F>ome truth in them:
moreover, commendations which are given without <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of flattery, do get
more favour then <U+017F>uch as are given in pre<U+017F>ence; <U+017F>o that this di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F>s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to relent, and champ upon the rea<U+017F>ons which <hi>Sylvander</hi> urged: yet her haughty
<U+017F>pirit would hardly permit her to clear him ab<U+017F>olutely, but put the que<U+017F>tion whether
<hi>Laonice</hi> or he <U+017F>aid truly: And that <U+017F>he had learned enough for that time, al<U+017F>o fearing
<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be perceived either by that Shepherd or <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>tole away as <U+017F>oftly
as <U+017F>he could, and went to <U+017F>eek <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phillis</hi> al<U+017F>o at the <U+017F>ame time, thinking the Shepherd to be well recovered, and that
her <U+017F>tay any longer at that time would do him no good; Well Shepherd <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, I am very glad to hear as much as you have told me; Comfort your <U+017F>elf, and
believe that your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>hall not be unprofitable to you: for indeed, when I
con<U+017F>ider your rea<U+017F>ons, I believe you to be wrongfully accu<U+017F>ed; and I promi<U+017F>e you,
I will not be mute unto <hi>Diana,</hi> but hope that ere long you <U+017F>hall find the effects of
my <U+017F>olicitation: in the interim, do what is fit to be done on your part, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
loving that Shepherde<U+017F>s, who cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be excelled in Beauty and merit by
any, nor equalled but by very few.</p>
                     <p>Upon this <hi>Phillis</hi> left him, and <U+017F>tayed not to hear the thanks which he would
have given her for her kind promi<U+017F>es, nor the prote<U+017F>tations of inviolable and eternal
affection which he would ever have unto <hi>Diana,</hi> what treatment <U+017F>oever he had from
her. But when he was alone, and none to divert him, then did his di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
them<U+017F>elves before his eyes: And though the a<U+017F><U+017F>urances which he received from
that <hi>Druide</hi> which was unknown unto him, and the promi<U+017F>es which <hi>Phillis</hi> made, did
give him <U+017F>ome hopes, yet the con<U+017F>ideration of tho<U+017F>e misfortunes which be<U+017F>el him
even from his cradle, did put him out of all hopes, for again<U+017F>t them the arms of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
&amp; rea<U+017F>on were almo<U+017F>t of no validity. Being thus pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with extream <U+017F>orrows,
he walked gently towards the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> and <U+017F>ate him<U+017F>elf down upon the Bank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Then there was not a <U+017F>illable of that cruel me<U+017F><U+017F>age which <hi>Phillis</hi> brought him from
<hi>Diana,</hi> but the <U+017F>olitude of that place did fre<U+017F>hly bring into his memory; and he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the cro<U+017F>sne<U+017F>s of his <U+017F>ullen fate, in a thou<U+017F>and various expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. He had
continued longer in this lamenting vein (had not <hi>Florice, Cercinea,</hi> and <hi>Palinice,</hi>
with that <U+017F>tranger their companion, who were retiring homewards) heard him,
<hi>Cercinea</hi> knew his voice; and becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>tranger was de<U+017F>irous to know how they
<U+017F>hould pa<U+017F>s away the re<U+017F>t of the day, <hi>Cercinea</hi> <U+017F>aid unto her, that if they were in the
company of that Shepherd whom they heard talking, it would be impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to
think the time tedious or ill <U+017F>pent, and I am confident, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, when you <U+017F>ee him,
you will <U+017F>ay as much as I. But tell me I be<U+017F>eech you <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, if he be a man, how will
it plea<U+017F>e <hi>Dorinde?</hi> who <U+017F>ays, that if <U+017F>he were one, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould not abide her <U+017F>elf. I
do believe, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> and I dare venture a wager, that when you have <U+017F>een
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> if you do continue your hatred of men, yet at the lea<U+017F>t you will <U+017F>ay that
Shepherd is not a man: What <U+017F>hould he be then asked <U+017F>he? Somthing more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Cercinea,</hi> and the tryal will but co<U+017F>t you the time that you <U+017F>hall employ in
<U+017F>eeing him. He mu<U+017F>t indeed be more then a man (<U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde</hi>) if he force <U+017F>uch a
confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion from my mouth; For if a God (be it <U+017F>poken without bla<U+017F>phemy) <U+017F>hould
a<U+017F><U+017F>ume the <U+017F>hape of a man, he would grow near to become ungrateful, and a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and I could not chu<U+017F>e but hate him.</p>
                     <p>It <U+017F>eems (<U+017F>aid <hi>Florice</hi>) that you have a very bad opinion of men. Yes, replied
<hi>Dorinde,</hi> and wor<U+017F>e then my words can expre<U+017F>s; for I do believe that there is none,
no not one <U+017F>ingle one that can love. You will alter your opinion <U+017F>aid <hi>Palinice</hi> when
you <U+017F>ee <hi>Sylvander</hi> with <hi>Diana.</hi> I cannot tell what I may do, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> but
I never yet met with any woman who tru<U+017F>ted in them, that was not deceived. When
you under<U+017F>tand, replied <hi>Florice,</hi> how <U+017F>ome do drown them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>ome bani<U+017F>h them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
and others kill them<U+017F>elves by rea<U+017F>on of too much pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, you will be very
hard of Belief if you do not confe<U+017F>s that there are men in this Country that can and
do love. Tho<U+017F>e re<U+017F>olutions of which you <U+017F>peak, <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> are indeed very high,
but anger may produce them as well as love, and who knows but that they were tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion? for believe it Ladies, Men are of a very bad Nature, they
do all by contraries; they are a kind of Bea<U+017F>ts, which never do any good, but when
they think to do ill.</p>

Thus as the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es di<U+017F>puted, they came to the place where <hi>Sylvander</hi>
was, whom they found <U+017F>o plunged in his own <U+017F>ad thoughts, that for all the noi<U+017F>e
which they made, he never heard them: he lay all along, his head leaning upon
his hand, his eyes up to Heaven, and upon either cheek a river of tears. <hi>Dorinde</hi>
after <U+017F>he had looked upon him in this condition; Is this the Shepherd (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he in a
low voice), that never deceived any who tru<U+017F>ted in him? Why do you ask this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion?
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Palinice;</hi> becau<U+017F>e, replied <hi>Dorinde,</hi> if he never did deceive any,
he weeps becau<U+017F>e he never did: and if he has deceived any, he weeps becau<U+017F>e he has
deceived no more. This Shepherd, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> has a better reputation then <U+017F>o;
and is held for a very good man: This reputation, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> is the <U+017F>talking
hor<U+017F>e, by which men come to deceive us. But dear friends, ob<U+017F>erve how a gla<U+017F>s
<U+017F>hews tho<U+017F>e things which are on the right <U+017F>ide to be of the gla<U+017F>s in its left <U+017F>ide, the
be<U+017F>t remedy is to do <U+017F>o with them; take all that they do or <U+017F>ay by contraries: and
as for the tears of this Shepherd, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elves my Companions, they are but the
tears of a Crocadile: he can cry and feign, till he has gotten one into a belief of him,
and then he will deceive.</p>
                     <p>Nature to our mi<U+017F>ery, has given them power to cry or laugh when they plea<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>o it be but to deceive a poor woman that puts her tru<U+017F>t in them: they are of a mo<U+017F>t
depraved nature, and are like unto hunters, who make it their delight in taking abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of paines to catch a poor <U+017F>illy harmle<U+017F><U+017F>e Woman that flyes before them.</p>
                     <p>The earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s wherewith <hi>Dorinde</hi> <U+017F>poke, made her rai<U+017F>e her voice <U+017F>o high before
<U+017F>he was aware, that <hi>Sylvander</hi> heard her: and turning her face towards them, he
was a<U+017F>hamed they <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e him in that condition: for <U+017F>uch was his warie
di<U+017F>cretion, that he had rather have dyed, then give them any knowledg of that real
affection which he bare unto <hi>Diana:</hi> therefore to remove all <U+017F>uch <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>hew them a more contented face, then his heart was; <U+017F>o as drying
his eyes as well as he could, and <U+017F>eeming to be doing <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e: Oh Fair Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>es,
(<U+017F>aid he unto them) how much am I obliged unto you for diverting me
From a melancholy mood. There is none of us, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Florice,</hi> who are not very
glad to plea<U+017F>ure <hi>Sylvander</hi> in any thing, and thinks not our walk well imployed <U+017F>ince
we have met which <U+017F>uch a courteous Shepherd: and the rather (added <hi>Cercinea</hi>)
becau<U+017F>e at the fir<U+017F>t we were afraid, le<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould be a di<U+017F>turbance unto you: Oh
never, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible but the pre<U+017F>ence of <U+017F>uch Fair and Lovely
Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, <U+017F>hould bring me all manner of happine<U+017F>s and contentment: The
po<U+017F>ture in which we found you, replied <hi>Palinice,</hi> made us doubt it: for every
thing will trouble us, when we are troubled our <U+017F>elf: <hi>Sylvander</hi> now conceived that
they <U+017F>aw tho<U+017F>e tears which he would have concealed; and to drive them from any
opinion that they proceeded from any Love: It is very hard (Wi<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es,
<U+017F>aid he unto them) to keep dry eyes, when the <U+017F>oul is pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with any tormenting
thoughts; for to con<U+017F>ider, that I know neither who was my Father nor Mother,
no nor the ground upon which I fir<U+017F>t breathed, nor to have any e<U+017F>tate or fortune, or
any hopes but in my own indu<U+017F>try: are not the<U+017F>e thoughts enough to draw tears
from the heart of him who is in that mi<U+017F>erable condition? Did I not <U+017F>ay, replied
<hi>Dorinde,</hi> that they were not tears of Love? Though all my Companions would
needs per<U+017F>wade me to the contrary. <hi>Sylvander</hi> then looking upon her, and not
knowing her, but <U+017F>eeing her to be very Fair, and Lovely: Why Fair <U+017F>tranger, <U+017F>aid
he unto her, can you di<U+017F>cern tears of Love from others? Before you ask that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> you <U+017F>hould tell me, whether there be any <U+017F>uch things as
tears of Love: Nay rather (replied the Shepherd) whether there be any el<U+017F>e but
tears of Love. Why? <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> do you think one never cryes but for Love? I
do not only think it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> but I am <U+017F>ure you will confe<U+017F>s it when I have
made you under<U+017F>tand it; That, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, can never be, at the lea<U+017F>t I am <U+017F>ure, that if
one never cry but for Love, <hi>Dorinde</hi> never cryed; your beauty and your age, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
the Shepherd, will hardly excu<U+017F>e you from paying that tribute, unle<U+017F>s Love
be contented, which make tho<U+017F>e only cry who do Love you. If <U+017F>ome mu<U+017F>t cry, replied
<U+017F>he, I had rather the lot <U+017F>hould fall upon any other then my <U+017F>elf: yet to return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what we <U+017F>poke of before; be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <hi>Sylvander,</hi> that if none ever cryed but for
Love, then never any man cryed, for never any man neither did, nor will, or can
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53527:160"/>
Love. This opinion, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> is much wor<U+017F>e then the fir<U+017F>t; and if you
plea<U+017F>e to give me leave, it <U+017F>hall be the fir<U+017F>t that I will make cleer unto you. I am
afraid; an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> you will but lo<U+017F>e your labour, becau<U+017F>e I have had mo<U+017F>t

<hi>Sylvander</hi>) when we ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

with this opinion, that <U+017F>he would needs turn the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon <U+017F>ome other
<U+017F>ubject: but her Companions did almo<U+017F>t force her to hear what <hi>Sylvander</hi> would
<U+017F>ay, and then the Shepherd began thus.</p>
                     <p>Among<U+017F>t all the Doctors in the Ma<U+017F><U+017F>ilian Schools, I learned this le<U+017F><U+017F>on, never to
di<U+017F>pute with tho<U+017F>e that will deny Principles: Tell me therefore Fair Shepherde<U+017F>s,
whither you do believe that there is any <U+017F>uch thing in the world as is called Love. I
do believe, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that there is <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which is called by that name,
and which men are not capable of. We will not meddle with that yet, <U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
but I am contented that you do confe<U+017F>s there is <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which is called
Love. Then tel me I be<U+017F>eech you, what do you think this Love is? It is, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
a certain de<U+017F>ire to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s that thing which one judges good and beautifull. There is
not a <hi>Druide</hi> in all <hi>Gaul,</hi> replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who could have given a better an<U+017F>wer
then this Fair Shepherde<U+017F>s. But, continued he, and turned towards her, is there not
in the world <U+017F>ome Animals that have rea<U+017F>on, and <U+017F>ome that have none? I have heard
<U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that there are <U+017F>uch. And in which of the<U+017F>e two ranks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> will you place man? You put me to it, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled) for I
cannot deny but that they are rational in <U+017F>ome things, and not in others, and mo<U+017F>t
commonly without any rea<U+017F>on at all. Yet is it not true, (added <hi>Sylvander</hi>) that men
do always <U+017F>eek after their delights and contentments? Of this, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde,</hi>
there is no doubt: for there is not one of them but will lo<U+017F>e the be<U+017F>t of their friends,
rather then the lea<U+017F>t of their delights. I am <U+017F>atisfied, replied <hi>Sylvander</hi> then, that you
confe<U+017F><U+017F>e there is a Love, that this Love is a de<U+017F>ire of that which one thinks good or
beautifull: and that men are very earne<U+017F>t to accompli<U+017F>h their de<U+017F>ires. Now it will
be an ea<U+017F>ie matter to prove unto you, that men do not only Love, but al<U+017F>o, that
they do Love better then women. If what I have <U+017F>aid, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde</hi> pre<U+017F>ently,
will help you to prove what you <U+017F>ay, I will un<U+017F>ay it again: and I had rather be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
with it, then <U+017F>uch a fal<U+017F>e conclu<U+017F>ion and con<U+017F>equence <U+017F>hould be drawn
from any thing which came from me. All the company began to laugh at this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer,
and de<U+017F>ired <hi>Sylvander</hi> to continue on, which he did in this manner.</p>
                     <p>There needs not many words, Fair Shepherde<U+017F>s, to decide the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: for it
mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity be concluded, that <U+017F>ince men have <U+017F>uch violent de<U+017F>ires of their
contentment, and the will having nothing but a good for its object, or at the lea<U+017F>t
e<U+017F>teemed <U+017F>o, it follows by con<U+017F>equence, that Love being nothing but a de<U+017F>ire, as you
have confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed, he does Love mo<U+017F>t, who has mo<U+017F>t objects of good before his eyes;
and the woman being much fairer and fuller of goodne<U+017F>s then man, who can deny
but that a man Loves better then a woman, who has not <U+017F>o worthy a <U+017F>ubject to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
her de<U+017F>ires upon? I do confe<U+017F>s all, <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> until you come unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu<U+017F>ion
which you infer: you cannot, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> unle<U+017F>s you take away that
advantage which women have above men, and therefore it is better for you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s,
that there is none in all the world that knows how to Love <U+017F>o well as man: yet
if it happen that any judg the contrary, it is not that the truth is <U+017F>o, but is like a
<U+017F>treight <U+017F>taff, which being put into the water, will <U+017F>eem crooked; and all that we
<U+017F>ee through a gla<U+017F>s, <U+017F>eems to be of the <U+017F>ame colour that the gla<U+017F>s is: for the Meduim
by which the <U+017F>ight is conveyed, does repre<U+017F>ent it fal<U+017F>e to the eye: Even <U+017F>o it comes
to pa<U+017F>s that the actions of a Lover are <U+017F>een and judged otherwi<U+017F>e then indeed they
are; and all by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome defect in the Medium, through which they are <U+017F>een.
But the truth is, every man does Love, and this a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion is <U+017F>o true, as one may
boldly <U+017F>ay, that all tho<U+017F>e who Love not, are not men; for there was never any man
that did not Love.</p>
                     <p>Though <hi>Sylvander</hi> was in no fit humour for any <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, yet he could not

this great company which he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>hun, unto the very <U+017F>ame place where he

at his hou<U+017F>e, which is a remote di<U+017F>tance from hence, on the other <U+017F>ide of the River
<hi>Lignon,</hi> upon a little hill, which you may <U+017F>ee on your right hand as you go to the
great City of <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles:</hi> but the <hi>Druide Cloridamantes</hi> is not far from hence,
dwelling at an ancient Pallace, which is called <hi>Julius,</hi> after the name of him who
conquered <hi>Gaul.</hi> Then all the company entreated him to conduct them thither,
to the end they might have more <U+017F>peedy ju<U+017F>tice upon an injury which had been done
unto all the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and by one whom they had brought along
with them. <hi>Sylvander</hi> hearing this, and ca<U+017F>ting his eyes upon the Shepherde<U+017F>s that
had been wronged, al<U+017F>o being much moved as well by her beauty and mode<U+017F>ty, as
by the general offence, he thought him<U+017F>elf obliged to conduct them, although he
had a great de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>taying alone, to complain again<U+017F>t his mi<U+017F>ery and di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter. He
quitted therefore his <U+017F>hady bu<U+017F>h, and went before them to <U+017F>hew the way; having
an opinion that if he did otherwi<U+017F>e, the Gods perhaps would puni<U+017F>h him for
the offence which others had committed, <U+017F>ince they had directed this company un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
                     <p>All the way as they went, this great company ob<U+017F>erved a very wary and <U+017F>trict
<U+017F>ilence; which was no <U+017F>mall contentment unto <hi>Sylvander,</hi> for by that means he
could both guide them, and entertain his own <U+017F>ad thoughts. When they were come
to the hou<U+017F>e, and <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> under<U+017F>tood that they were per<U+017F>ons who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
reparation of <U+017F>ome injury which had been done; he came into the great Hall,
where he was wont to do Ju<U+017F>tice unto <U+017F>uch as demanded it: and there entred, not
only all tho<U+017F>e whom <hi>Sylvander</hi> brought, but al<U+017F>o many others who followed them,
only out of curio<U+017F>ity. <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner entred into the Hall, and <U+017F>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon his Tribunal, but an old Pa<U+017F>tor, holding his wife, almo<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>ame age, by
the hand, began to <U+017F>peak thus unto him:</p>
                     <p>Mo<U+017F>t Reverend and mo<U+017F>t Ju<U+017F>t Father, you <U+017F>ee here before your Tribunal, a Father
and a Mother extreamly grieved and offended by a new way of Proceeding, and by
injuries committed again<U+017F>t them and their only Daughter, all who come to demand
Ju<U+017F>tice of you: we have brought before you, the offences, the offenders, and the
witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, that when the matter is heard, equity and right may be done according
to your cu<U+017F>tom, and wicked offenders puni<U+017F>hed according to their merits.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Druide</hi> then, with <U+017F>uch a gravity as became a Judge, a<U+017F><U+017F>ured them that the
Scale of Ju<U+017F>tice <U+017F>hould be held even betwixt both parties, offences <U+017F>hould be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed,
and right <U+017F>hould be done unto them all: and to the end, continued he, a more
<U+017F>ound and ju<U+017F>t judgment may be given, make choice of one among<U+017F>t you, who is not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53527:161"/>
intere<U+017F>ted in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, who may let us under<U+017F>tand your difference, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
let each party alledg what they can for them<U+017F>elves. Then the old Pa<U+017F>tor tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him<U+017F>elf towards tho<U+017F>e who came with him, to <U+017F>ee who among<U+017F>t them was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intere<U+017F>t, and knew all the particulars of the difference: all the company ca<U+017F>t
their eyes upon a Shepherde<U+017F>s who came with them: and becau<U+017F>e doubt was made
whether being a woman the <hi>Druide</hi> would admit of her; yes, yes, <U+017F>aid <hi>Clorida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes,</hi>
truth is as good from the mouth of that woman, as from any other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the parties intere<U+017F>ted, do acknowledg what <U+017F>he <U+017F>ays: and therefore if you think
her able to inform us of the whole matter, we will admit of her: for the innocency
of her age and <U+017F>ex, will be a <U+017F>trong argument and te<U+017F>timony of the truth. By the
command therefore of the <hi>Druide,</hi> and by the election of all parties, this woman
began thus.</p>

to all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of that Love, from the beginning until now, which is the

therefore a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olemn-prote<U+017F>tation to <U+017F>peak the truth, I <U+017F>hall tell you, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Father, that neer this place on the other <U+017F>ide of the River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> at the
foot of that high and great Mountain, which is called <hi>Mount Luna,</hi> is <U+017F>eated that
Village where we inhabit, and among<U+017F>t us is a very venerable Pa<U+017F>tor, who<U+017F>e name is
<hi>Menander,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and pointed to him) one that is held of the be<U+017F>t rank and
reputation, both for his e<U+017F>tate, and for his wi<U+017F>dom: This <U+017F>age Pa<U+017F>tor being joyned
in marriage many years with <hi>Lerice,</hi> that wi<U+017F>e and di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F>s whom you
<U+017F>ee next unto him, they never had any te<U+017F>timony of their mutual affection, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that Fair and young Shepherde<U+017F>s, whom I named before, and who <U+017F>tands now
betwixt them. As <U+017F>oon as it plea<U+017F>ed Heaven to be<U+017F>tow her upon them, all their care
was to <U+017F>ee her educated in all tho<U+017F>e virtues which beget e<U+017F>teem: and nature (whil<U+017F>t
her Parents were careful in the cultivating of her mind) did imbelli<U+017F>h her body
with as many graces and beauties, as <U+017F>he was able to be<U+017F>tow: were <U+017F>he not in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence
I <U+017F>hould prai<U+017F>e her more: but <U+017F>o it is, that in the <U+017F>pring of her age, <U+017F>he grew
unto that height of perfections, that <U+017F>he attracted all eyes upon her, and <U+017F>welled
them with admiration at her beauty.</p>
                     <p>One of <hi>Menanders</hi> next neighbours, and perhaps al<U+017F>o one of his be<U+017F>t friends, was
that Reverend old man, whom you <U+017F>ee upon the other <U+017F>ide of him, who<U+017F>e name is
<hi>Arion;</hi> a Pa<U+017F>tor without reproach, and who<U+017F>e Ance<U+017F>tors have long with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
governed the <U+017F>mall bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of our Village. But I mu<U+017F>t tell you, and I hope
he will not be angry with me for <U+017F>aying it, that his Father was <U+017F>tudious to leave him
more honour then e<U+017F>tate: <U+017F>o that though he was well to live, yet perhaps not <U+017F>o
rich as <U+017F>ome of his neighbours. Some two or three years before <hi>Silvanire</hi> was born,
<hi>Arion</hi> had that young Shepherd to his Son, who <U+017F>tands next him, and who<U+017F>e name
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53527:161"/>
is <hi>Aglantes,</hi> whom he educated in all commendable qualities. The friend<U+017F>hip and
good corre<U+017F>pondency of the Fathers, the neerne<U+017F>s of their dwelling, the beauty of
<hi>Silvanire,</hi> and the inclination, or rather the de<U+017F>tiny of <hi>Aglantes,</hi> made it a thing
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for this young Shepherd to <U+017F>ee her, and not devote him<U+017F>elf wholly unto
her; and he courted her with a de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>o innocent and harmle<U+017F>s, that none could
but think very well of it. <hi>Silvanire</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>erved with
<U+017F>o much <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, not knowing yet what Love was, did entertain this Shepherd
with <U+017F>uch a childi<U+017F>h <U+017F>incerity, and good will, that neither her Father nor Mother
<U+017F>eemed to di<U+017F>-approve of it: when <hi>Aglantes</hi> attained to the age of twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years, and <hi>Silvanire</hi> unto nine or ten, they always played in the fields toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <U+017F>eldom were they <U+017F>een a<U+017F>under: and when they returned home <hi>Menander</hi>
and <hi>Lerice</hi> did make <U+017F>o much of the little <hi>Aglantes,</hi> that he was more at their hou<U+017F>e,
then at his Fathers. All tho<U+017F>e that ob<U+017F>erved their actions and behaviour, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
them; the extraordinary indulgence, and continual care of this young Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
in courting this Shepherde<U+017F>s, and her <U+017F>weet mode<U+017F>ty in intertaining him, was
very <U+017F>trange: If the Sheep of this young Shepherde<U+017F>s did at any time go a<U+017F>tray, he
was never at re<U+017F>t till he had brought them back unto <hi>Silvanire:</hi> If <U+017F>he chanced to
lye longer in bed any morning then ordinary, he was <U+017F>o careful in enquiring of her
health, and in driving her Sheep with his own unto the pa<U+017F>ture, that none living
could be more officious and careful: And when <U+017F>he came unto him, he would give
her an account, not only of what he had done, but al<U+017F>o of every thought, be<U+017F>eech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her to have a care of her health, and leave the care of her flock unto him. One
day, when he brought back a <U+017F>trayed Sheep unto her; Sweet <hi>Aglantes,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he
unto him) which way can I requite all this pains you take for me? By permitting
me to <U+017F>erve you, an<U+017F>wered the Shepherd. That payment is ea<U+017F>ily made, an<U+017F>wered
<U+017F>he; but I fear <U+017F>uch coyn is not good enough to <U+017F>atisfie <U+017F>o great a debt: I do e<U+017F>teem
that permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion which I ask at <U+017F>o high a rate, <U+017F>aid <hi>Aglantes;</hi> that if I do but obtain
it, I <U+017F>hall think my <U+017F>elf over payed, not only for tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervices which I have already
rendred, but al<U+017F>o for all tho<U+017F>e which I <U+017F>hall or can render: Why do you e<U+017F>teem
that permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, continued <U+017F>he, at <U+017F>uch a rate? becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, my highe<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and my greate<U+017F>t ambition, is all my life to be your <U+017F>ervant. I <U+017F>ee, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<U+017F>he, that tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervants which my Father keeps, do ask other wages then
that permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Oh Faire<U+017F>t <hi>Silvanire</hi> (an<U+017F>wered he) they are not <U+017F>ervants, but
varlets, drudges, or <U+017F>laves: What difference do you put, <U+017F>aid <hi>Silvanire,</hi> betwixt
them and <U+017F>ervants? They, replied <hi>Aglantes,</hi> are mercenary, and <U+017F>erve for money or
fear; but <U+017F>ervants, <U+017F>ince all they do is out of Affection and Love; are mo<U+017F>t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
and may rightly be called Lovers, who are fully contented, if their <U+017F>ervices be
but acceptable to them unto whom they are rendred. I do much wonder then, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
the child, why my Father does not rather keep of the<U+017F>e Lovers, then others;
<hi>Aglantes</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>mile at this <U+017F>implicity: and though in rea<U+017F>on, his
age <U+017F>hould not make him more knowing in the<U+017F>e things then <hi>Silvanire;</hi> yet the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which is commonly u<U+017F>ed in talk of <U+017F>uch things among<U+017F>t boys, more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
wenches, had made him better acquainted with <U+017F>uch things then <U+017F>he was:
he <U+017F>miled therefore, and an<U+017F>wered thus: There is, Faire<U+017F>t <hi>Silvanire,</hi> abundance of
difference betwixt <U+017F>laves and Lovers, not only in that which I formerly <U+017F>aid, but
al<U+017F>o, in that one may entertain as many mercenary varlets as they plea<U+017F>e, but they mu<U+017F>t
never entertain above one Lover; and more then that, none but women can have
them: So then, replied <U+017F>he, <U+017F>ince you are my Lover, mu<U+017F>t I not entertain any other?
The truth is, an<U+017F>wered he, that unle<U+017F>s you do me wrong, you mu<U+017F>t not. I <U+017F>hall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by my good will wrong you, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he with a <U+017F>trange innocence, but if it
happen <U+017F>o that any other <U+017F>hould meet with one of the<U+017F>e Lovers who is ill favoured,
and di<U+017F>-agreeable, can <U+017F>he never have any but him? Sweet-heart, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Aglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
you mu<U+017F>t know, that Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es are not con<U+017F>trained to entertain all the Loves
which pre<U+017F>ent them<U+017F>elves; they have liberty to chu<U+017F>e: but when they have once
made their choi<U+017F>e, they cannot quit them without <U+017F>hewing them<U+017F>elves, either incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant
or weak in judgement; and both the<U+017F>e reproaches, are <U+017F>hame unto a di<U+017F>creet and
wi<U+017F>e woman. Then it <U+017F>eems, replied <U+017F>he, that if any of tho<U+017F>e Lovers do offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
unto me, I may refu<U+017F>e them, by <U+017F>aying that I have one already.</p>

I do relate the<U+017F>e trivial particulars, Reverend Father, to <U+017F>hew you, at what age
<hi>Silvanire</hi> and <hi>Aglantes</hi> began to Love one another. For ever <U+017F>ince that time, this
plant <U+017F>o grew, that who<U+017F>oever offered to cut it up, was doubtle<U+017F>s puni<U+017F>hable before
the Throne of Love. But when <hi>Silvanire</hi> was grown a little elder, and old enough
to know the truth of the<U+017F>e Queries which <U+017F>he put unto <hi>Aglantes,</hi> <U+017F>he learned that
every wi<U+017F>e woman ought to obey tho<U+017F>e unto whom <U+017F>he owed her being, and not to
di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her <U+017F>elf according to her own will, farther then as they approved. And
becau<U+017F>e this knowledg came a little too late, becau<U+017F>e Love had already <U+017F>owed <U+017F>uch
<U+017F>eeds, as had taken deep root in her <U+017F>oul, and could not be pulled up without abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of <U+017F>orrow; <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he could do not better, to feign that <U+017F>he was
free in her captivity. And though this di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation was a hard task, yet <U+017F>he <U+017F>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her <U+017F>elf to have a very great power over her actions. <hi>Aglantes</hi> for four years
together, lived in <U+017F>uch incertainty of her good will, that he could not <U+017F>ay he ever
received any other te<U+017F>timonies, then <U+017F>uch as might make him think that <U+017F>he held him
in the rank of common indifferency, <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewed unto all: a mo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
prudence, for a woman of her age, and certainly not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled.</p>
                     <p>At that time, I began to be familiar with this Fair and Wi<U+017F>e Woman; and I mu<U+017F>t
confe<U+017F>s that her virtue, her di<U+017F>cretion, and her beauty, made me almo<U+017F>t in Love with
her: and to my great happine<U+017F>s, I met with a mutual return; al<U+017F>o I believe, that
upon this, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to retire in appearance, from that good will which as a child
<U+017F>he had <U+017F>ignified unto that Shepherd: <U+017F>o as by help of this diver<U+017F>ion <U+017F>he was able to
be ab<U+017F>ent from him.</p>
                     <p>The cold u<U+017F>age wherewith <U+017F>he began to entertain <hi>Aglantes,</hi> went <U+017F>o to his heart,
that it almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>truck him dead with wonder to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch an alteration: and after he
had filled all our <U+017F>olitary places, woods, and caves, full of his complaints; an old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tor
came unto him when he was in a dark valley, and thinking that none heard him,
he broke out into a thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>ad complaints, which might give knowledg unto this
old and experienced Shepherd of his mi<U+017F>ery: this old man, being long <U+017F>ince a friend
unto the Father of <hi>Aglantes,</hi> after he had harkned a while un<U+017F>een, he went unto
him, and gave him a very <U+017F>harp reprehen<U+017F>ion, telling him he ought not to <U+017F>pend
his pretious time in <U+017F>uch vain thoughts, but rather in comforting his aged Father,
and looking to his Flocks and Family. That the Gods would puni<U+017F>h him if he thus
deceived the hopes which every one had in him; that this enemy which kept him in
<U+017F>uch <U+017F>ervitude, was to be overcome by flying; that idlene<U+017F>s was both the Mother,
and the Nur<U+017F>e of contempt and want; and repentance would be all the fruit he would
gather from it. But the young Shepherd being <U+017F>welled with his plea<U+017F>ing pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an<U+017F>wered he, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s that tho<U+017F>e who do Love a <U+017F>ubject which does
not de<U+017F>erve it, ought to be blamed and reprehended; and tho<U+017F>e again who do not
Love that which is amiable, want judgment, and are ignorant: and therefore for my
part, I will cheri<U+017F>h my affection; and when I cea<U+017F>e, my life <U+017F>hall cea<U+017F>e with it. As
for <hi>Arion,</hi> I hope he will help me to <U+017F>upport my torment; I know what filial duty
belongs unto him, and I have ever found his Paternal affection towards me: <U+017F>o as I
hope that when he remembers how he him<U+017F>elf has heretofore pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed through the
<U+017F>ame difficulties, he will con<U+017F>ider mine: and as for you Father, who <U+017F>hews <U+017F>o much
good will in your <U+017F>apient admonitions, I do be<U+017F>eech and conjure you to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t me
with all your aide and power. <hi>Aglantes,</hi> an<U+017F>wered the good old man, it is true I love
you, and knowing how hard a thing it is for a young heart to be rid of that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
which you re<U+017F>ent, I wi<U+017F>h you were free from it, that you might avoid tho<U+017F>e evils
which may fall upon you, and which I <U+017F>ee almo<U+017F>t inevitable: but <U+017F>ince you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved,
hearken unto the coun<U+017F>el that I will give. Does <U+017F>he whom you court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
to be your wife? I know your pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion will make you tell me wonders of her
merit; but for this time <U+017F>etting a<U+017F>ide all partiality, an<U+017F>wer me if you can, like a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
man, and ingeniou<U+017F>ly tell me who <U+017F>he is, that I may out of my Love to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi>
to you, and your Family, give you <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ound coun<U+017F>el as may be good for you.
<hi>Aglantes</hi> knowing this old man to be a lover of him, and all his Family, did name <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanire.</hi>
The good man, hearing her named, an<U+017F>wered thus; I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s <hi>Aglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
that if you have committed a fault in Loving, you are to be pardoned, and your
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53527:162"/>
crime is commendable: I would yet farther know, whether you ever did let that
Fair one know that you Love her: I have <U+017F>pent all my time hitherto in <U+017F>erving her, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
he; and to my mi<U+017F>ery, when <U+017F>he was not in an age to know Love, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed
as if <U+017F>he did know it, and Love me: but <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he came to be of age, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eems ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olutely
in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible: Perhaps, <U+017F>aid the prudent old man, <U+017F>he does it to try your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy:
Four years, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Aglantes,</hi> is too long for a tryal; Does <U+017F>he not Love
<U+017F>ome other? (asked the old man) The que<U+017F>tion may better be asked, <U+017F>aid <hi>Aglantes,</hi>
whether ever <U+017F>he turn her eyes upon her <U+017F>elf: Did you ever give her any cau<U+017F>e, asked
the Pa<U+017F>tor, to alter her good will unto you? Never that I know of, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glantes.</hi>
Then <U+017F>aid the old man, believe it from me, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, that you
will not repent it; <U+017F>he Loves you, and to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble it, according to the humour of
mo<U+017F>t women, le<U+017F>t other <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee it, <U+017F>he will not make it appear unto you. I a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Aglantes,</hi> that I cannot accu<U+017F>e her of di<U+017F><U+017F>embling it; for <U+017F>he treats all
others, as <U+017F>he does me, and behaves her <U+017F>elf towards all alike: So much the better
(an<U+017F>wered the old man) for were <U+017F>he engaged unto any other, you would find much
more difficulty in your enterpri<U+017F>e; but <U+017F>he does di<U+017F><U+017F>emble it, to make you the more
affectionate; knowing that things mo<U+017F>t hardly obtained, are mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ired: Oh Father,
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Aglantes,</hi> and interrupted) I fear that in this you are mi<U+017F>taken, for <U+017F>he cannot
wi<U+017F>h me more affectionate, then <U+017F>he knew I was. Then (<U+017F>aid the old man) it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
her Father has commanded her <U+017F>o to do; and <U+017F>he being wi<U+017F>e and virtuous, will
not di<U+017F>obey him: but be her rea<U+017F>on what it will, I would advi<U+017F>e you to make a <U+017F>hew
as if you Loved <U+017F>ome other; for by that, you will know what her de<U+017F>ign is: <U+017F>he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
crafty if <U+017F>he di<U+017F><U+017F>emble it then; and to tell you truly, women are <U+017F>omtimes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with being too much loved: as you <U+017F>ee, there is none but loves light, but too
much light dazles, and we are oft forced to put our hands before our eyes to ea<U+017F>e
them: I do believe (<U+017F>aid <hi>Aglantes</hi>) that this <U+017F>tratagem might be good in them that
can act it; but I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to do it: I <U+017F>hould be a<U+017F>hamed
that any <U+017F>hould think me of <U+017F>o little judgment, or that <hi>Silvanire</hi> <U+017F>hould any way
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect my fidelity. Oh young man (<U+017F>aid the old one and <U+017F>miled) you are a very
novice in the mi<U+017F>tery of Love; the <U+017F>hame or the glory of him that attempts any thing,
is to effect it, or not effect it: and if a Lover can make him<U+017F>elf loved, that is all he
de<U+017F>ires or aims at. For my part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Aglantes,</hi> my de<U+017F>ign is to Love her: and, <U+017F>aid
the old man interrupting him, to be beloved: To be beloved, replied <hi>Aglantes,</hi> is
above all my hopes. Then Shepherd, <U+017F>aid the Pa<U+017F>tor, if you cannot <U+017F>eem to Love
another, I would advi<U+017F>e you however, to let it be reported <U+017F>o; for you mu<U+017F>t know,
that the<U+017F>e young women, though they <U+017F>hew the contrary, are not always affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
when they <U+017F>mile upon tho<U+017F>e that court them; but it is more out of vanity, that
it may be <U+017F>aid their beauty has gotten <U+017F>uch a number of <U+017F>ervants, and <U+017F>omtimes out
of envie at their companions; but be it what it will, it is <U+017F>till very good for him that
Loves, to put them into <U+017F>ome doubts: and if you be not <U+017F>o hardy as to undertake
this enterpri<U+017F>e, leave the paine of it unto me; and I will effect it for you: it will be
<U+017F>ufficient for your di<U+017F>charge, that when it is a fit time to make known your real affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to <U+017F>ay that you are not acce<U+017F><U+017F>ary unto the <U+017F>tratagem.</p>
                     <p>The wi<U+017F>e old man made it pre<U+017F>ently be rumoured abroad that <hi>Aglantes</hi> was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in his affection; and every one was apt to believe it, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Silvanire</hi> was <U+017F>o
cold towards <hi>Aglantes.</hi> But though <hi>Silina</hi> a Fair and Virtuous Shepherde<U+017F>s, and
Daughter to this old Pa<U+017F>tor, was reported to be his Mi<U+017F>tris, and that the marriage
was ready to be <U+017F>olemnized; yet <hi>Silvanire</hi> would never believe it. 'Tis true, it did
a little trouble her, but not <U+017F>o much as to make her alter her behaviour towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glantes:</hi>
for <hi>Menander</hi> her Father had a de<U+017F>ign to marry her unto <hi>Theaner</hi> one of
the riche<U+017F>t Shepherds in all our Village; and though <U+017F>he did <U+017F>car<U+017F>e know him whom
they would have her to marry, yet was <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to follow the will of <hi>Menander.</hi>
One day, I chanced to <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>e her, as <U+017F>he was <U+017F>aying aloud unto her <U+017F>elf, that he
could not change, though he faigned the contrary. <hi>Silvanire</hi> was a little a<U+017F>toni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed
to <U+017F>ee her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed as <U+017F>he was <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o: but <U+017F>eeming as if what <U+017F>he had <U+017F>aid,
was not any thing that concerned her, but only a part of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ong which <U+017F>he had
heard <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>ing, <U+017F>he continued talking upon <U+017F>everal other <U+017F>ubjects: but as
cunning as <U+017F>he was, I <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected that <U+017F>he was troubled at the report of the marriage of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53527:163"/>
                        <hi>Aglantes:</hi> And by fortune, as if that Shepherd came purpo<U+017F>ely to an<U+017F>wer for his
own innocency, we <U+017F>aw him afar off coming with a <U+017F>heep before him; as <U+017F>oon as
<hi>Silvanire</hi> <U+017F>aw him, <U+017F>he knew the Sheep; Yonder (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) is the man that is to be
married, who it <U+017F>eems thinks very little upon it; for yonder <U+017F>heep which you <U+017F>ee, is
the <U+017F>ame which I lo<U+017F>t this morning. It will be very hard for him, an<U+017F>wered I, not
to have <hi>Silvanire</hi> alwaies in his memory: But, continued I, what do you conceive
of that marriage? You mu<U+017F>t ask him that que<U+017F>tion, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he. But replied I,
what do you think of it? I believe (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that he never yet thought upon it, and
that he is too young to think of it yet this long time. When I would have replied,
<hi>Aglantes</hi> came to us, who pre<U+017F>enting the Sheep unto <hi>Silvanire,</hi> told her where he
found it, what mi<U+017F>chance it had, and what great care he had of it: The Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s
thanked him kindly, but yet with <U+017F>uch a mode<U+017F>ty as might be called coldne<U+017F>s in
any but <hi>Silvanire:</hi> And becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>aw <hi>Aglantes</hi> was a little a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at it, though
he was <U+017F>ufficiently accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>uch u<U+017F>age, to let him under<U+017F>tand why my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
u<U+017F>ed him <U+017F>o, I <U+017F>aid unto him, Have you any mind <hi>Aglantes,</hi> or any permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion
to <U+017F>erve any other then <hi>Silina? Silina?</hi> <U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>tood amazed, why <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>he pretend more unto my <U+017F>ervice then any other Shepherde<U+017F>s? Becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered
I, you are ere long to marry her; Do you think to carry it <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecretly that we mu<U+017F>t
not know of it? No, no, <U+017F>aid he, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf that my wi<U+017F>e is yet unborn: <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanire</hi>
could not chu<U+017F>e but laugh, and ask him why? Becau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>he whom I
would have, my own <U+017F>mall merits makes me receive a denial; and <U+017F>he who perhaps
I may have, my heart forbids the Banes. But I hope, <U+017F>aid I, that when <U+017F>he is born
we may know her, and tell us in the mean time (I be<U+017F>eech you) what kind of creature
mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>he be that plea<U+017F>eth you? If <hi>Silvanire</hi> do command me, an<U+017F>wered he, I will
tell you. I am very willing (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvanire</hi>) that you <U+017F>atisfie my friends curio<U+017F>ity.
Know then <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde</hi> (<U+017F>aid he, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf unto me, for that is my name)
that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t re<U+017F>emble <hi>Silvanire</hi> in all things; and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, that if <U+017F>he differ
from her in any thing, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall never be mine. Yet <hi>Aglantes</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto him)
let me tell you that <hi>Silina</hi> is a very hand<U+017F>ome woman, but <U+017F>he does not at all re<U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
her: I confe<U+017F>s, replied he, that <U+017F>he is hand<U+017F>ome, and has no re<U+017F>emblance of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanire,</hi>
and therefore I have nothing to <U+017F>ay unto her: How? <U+017F>aid I, will you not
marry <hi>Silina?</hi> No, no, <U+017F>aid he faintly, <hi>Silina</hi> de<U+017F>erves better then me, but yet though
<hi>Silina</hi> were <hi>Galathea,</hi> and would have me, yet I would have none of her: But <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e
<U+017F>he did re<U+017F>emble <hi>Silvanire,</hi> and were <hi>Galathea,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, would you refu<U+017F>e her?
Though <U+017F>he did re<U+017F>emble <hi>Silvanire,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, yet being <hi>Galathea,</hi> I <U+017F>wear by the <U+017F>acred
Mi<U+017F>leto, I would not have her.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t we were thus talking, my companion made a <U+017F>hew as if <U+017F>he minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the found <U+017F>heep, yet I ob<U+017F>erved that <U+017F>he hearkned very attentively unto
us, which made me afterwards look a little more narrowly into all her actions; <U+017F>o as
within a few days after, I came to know, that though <U+017F>he made it not appear, yet
<U+017F>he did love him: And truly I cannot but admire the wi<U+017F>dom of this young Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F>s,
who at <U+017F>uch a tender age had <U+017F>uch an ab<U+017F>olute power over her own will.</p>
                     <p>At the <U+017F>ame time <hi>Tirintes</hi> returned into our Village, he is the Shepherd that is
brought before you as a Delinquent, and again<U+017F>t whom, <U+017F>age <hi>Clorimantes,</hi> all this
company demands ju<U+017F>tice: I <U+017F>ay, he returned into our Town: for though he was
from thence originally, yet was he educated and lived upon the confines of <hi>Furan:</hi>
his Father <U+017F>ent for him home, and as we all know, very unluckily. When this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
was among<U+017F>t us, he no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw <hi>Silvanire,</hi> but he fell in love with her, and
that <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, that many thought him in danger to imitate <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Silvanire</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, who<U+017F>e re<U+017F>olution was upon exact obedience unto
her Father, and had no inclination unto any but <hi>Aglantes,</hi> though <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewed it not,
<U+017F>he did di<U+017F>-intangle her <U+017F>elf from the addre<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Tirintes</hi> with as much di<U+017F>cretion as
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>he could; and though <U+017F>he carried a very great indifferency both towards
him, and towards <hi>Aglantes,</hi> and all the re<U+017F>t of the Shepherds who courted her,
which was no <U+017F>mall number, yet his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion did from day to day <U+017F>o augment, that he
re<U+017F>olved, <U+017F>ince he could not live in her favour, not to live at all. That Shepherd,

perhaps this la<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on made <hi>Alciron</hi> to go thither a little before; <hi>Tirintes</hi> not <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, <U+017F>its down under a Fir-tree, <U+017F>eemed for a while to be immoveable, his eyes
fixed upon <U+017F>ome certain Rocks which were clo<U+017F>e by; and at la<U+017F>t fetching a mo<U+017F>t deep
<U+017F>igh, <hi>Alciron</hi> heard him utter many <U+017F>ad complaints again<U+017F>t the obduracy of his
Mi<U+017F>tris, comparing her unto tho<U+017F>e Rocks, and his eyes flowing with tears.</p>
                     <p>As <U+017F>oon as he had ended his <U+017F>ad complaints, it was not long before <hi>Alciron</hi> would
needs help him to condole: oh my dear <hi>Tirintes</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) how long will
this mo<U+017F>t lamentable life la<U+017F>t? Are you not weary with <U+017F>hedding <U+017F>uch Rivers of
Tears, and rai<U+017F>ing <U+017F>o many winds of unprofitable <U+017F>ighs? Do you not know how all
your labour and pains is unfruitly lo<U+017F>t? Is not Hope it <U+017F>elf (which <U+017F>eldom leaves a
Lover) quite vani<U+017F>hed? Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that with the lo<U+017F>s of thy liberty, thou <U+017F>hould<U+017F>t
al<U+017F>o lo<U+017F>e the u<U+017F>e of thy rea<U+017F>on? If thou ha<U+017F>t thy wits, when wilt thou make u<U+017F>e of
them? Mu<U+017F>t they be alwaies unprofitably idle? Do<U+017F>t thou think any <U+017F>ervice will ever
oblige yonder Shepherde<U+017F>s? Will any Tears mollifie her? Will any pains move her?
Or will any Affection or faithful ob<U+017F>tinacy win her? Oh <hi>Tirintes,</hi> if thou art in
that error, how gro<U+017F>ly art thou mi<U+017F>taken? She is deaf, and ab<U+017F>olutely in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible to
all manner of prayers, or <U+017F>ervices, or tears: She is <U+017F>tark blind, Man land cannot <U+017F>ee
any of tho<U+017F>e pains and pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions which thou do<U+017F>t endure for her; and what can<U+017F>t
thou ever expect in any rea<U+017F>on from <U+017F>uch a deaf and blinde <U+017F>oul, but that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
neither hear, nor <U+017F>ee, nor re<U+017F>ent any thing? Oh ye Gods! replied <hi>Tirintes,</hi> what
would ye have me to do? Command me what you plea<U+017F>e, I am here ready to obey
you in all, but only in bidding me cea<U+017F>e to love her. In this, I be<U+017F>eech you pardon
me if I di<U+017F>obey; for the fault is not mine, but that all-commanding Beauty which I
have not power to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>He had long continued his complaints, if <hi>Alciron,</hi> who could not endure to <U+017F>ee
his friend in <U+017F>uch torment, had not interrupted him, with intentions to give <U+017F>ome
comfort. The Gods <hi>Tirintes</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) do know our weakne<U+017F>s and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and out of their infinite goodne<U+017F>s, will excu<U+017F>e and pardon them: But they
will not endure the crime of tho<U+017F>e who will make them guilty of their own errors:
Therefore, dear friend, Do not by any <U+017F>uch bla<U+017F>phemies provoke their ju<U+017F>t anger
again<U+017F>t thee. Oh my dear friend, replied <hi>Tirintes</hi> with a deep <U+017F>igh, <U+017F>ince they do
know our imbecilities and imperfections, and will pardon them, doubtle<U+017F>s they will
not impute that crime for which you reprehend me, for it is weakne<U+017F>s only which
makes me commit it; prote<U+017F>ting, that my intention was not to tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F>s their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
but when I could not obey them. And to make it appear that it is <U+017F>o,
good <hi>Alciron</hi> tell me, who is he that can love <U+017F>uch a mo<U+017F>t amiable piece le<U+017F>s then I do?
And in loving her <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, who can bla<U+017F>pheme le<U+017F>s then I, if it be bla<U+017F>phemy
to <U+017F>ay that I cannot chu<U+017F>e but love her? Oh <hi>Tirintes,</hi> replied <hi>Alciron,</hi> Do not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thy <U+017F>elf in thine own fault, for this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which you <U+017F>ay is <U+017F>o potent in thee, is
indeed only thy own Will, which if thou woulde<U+017F>t <U+017F>urmount, thou ha<U+017F>t power enough
to do it. I do confe<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes</hi> coldly) that it does depend upon my own will:
But do you not <U+017F>ee that I cannot will any thing but what <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>e? So then it <U+017F>eems
<U+017F>aid <hi>Alciron,</hi> you will cea<U+017F>e to be a man, that you may become a Lover. If being
a man, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> be not to love <hi>Silvanire,</hi> I neither am, nor will be a man. Not
to make u<U+017F>e of Rea<U+017F>on, replied <hi>Alciron,</hi> is not to be a man; and can there be any
thing more unrea<U+017F>onable then to cea<U+017F>e loving ones <U+017F>elf, to love another? Is not <U+017F>elf
pre<U+017F>ervation the great and principal law of Nature? Oh dear friend, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi>
let me not <U+017F>ee the greatne<U+017F>s of my wound; I hope it is not incurable: but you take
the cour<U+017F>e to make it more de<U+017F>perate: But the <U+017F>tone is thrown, it is re<U+017F>olved upon,
that I will die in loving <hi>Silvanire;</hi> and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that I wi<U+017F>h for nothing now, but
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53527:164"/>
to end this life quickly; for here I hope for no mitigation of my pain. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you <hi>Alciron</hi> to promi<U+017F>e, that when I am dead, you write this Epitaph upon
my Tomb, <hi>Here lies he that was murdred by the Faire<U+017F>t Eyes under Heaven:</hi> I hope,
that one day this cruel Fair One, will in the<U+017F>e few words read my affection, and her
own cruelty, and the Gods to my <U+017F>atisfaction move her unto <U+017F>ome repentance. Oh
how happy <U+017F>hould I be, if in the other life I hear one <U+017F>ay that her Fair Eyes was once
wet, or that one <U+017F>ingle tear did trickle down her Fair Cheek: Fie, fie, <hi>Tirintes,</hi> <U+017F>aid
<hi>Alciron,</hi> why this talk of death and Tombs? Love is the God of life, and nothing
can ruine his empire but death: Live, live man, though it were for nothing but to
pre<U+017F>erve a faithful Lover for this <hi>Silvanire</hi> whom you Love <U+017F>o well: and for my part,
I will promi<U+017F>e you, that if you will follow my directions, and do as I bid you, I will
quickly give this Fair One unto you. Oh <hi>Alciron,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
never oblige tho<U+017F>e unto whom they are made; this which I do promi<U+017F>e, replied
<hi>Alciron,</hi> is no impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility, provided you will but do as I <U+017F>ay: then he continued thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tirintes</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) I de<U+017F>ire as much as I do my own life, to <U+017F>ee you rid of this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; but <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>ee all per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions are in vain, I promi<U+017F>e to give you
this woman, in a very <U+017F>hort time; <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>o much your own, that it <U+017F>hall be
long only of your <U+017F>elf, it you do not di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her according to your own will: do
not think it a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, for you <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ently find it effected, and confe<U+017F>s
that I never promi<U+017F>ed, but I performed. In order to this, within a few days after, he
came unto him again, and brought him a Mirrour, in which he forbad him to look;
and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, that if by any artifice he could <U+017F>o contrive it as <hi>Silvanire</hi> might
ca<U+017F>t her eye upon it, certainly <U+017F>he were his own, How? <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> is it an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment?
No, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alciron,</hi> but it is a natural power, which is in this
gla<U+017F>s; and what effects will it cau<U+017F>e? asked <hi>Tirintes.</hi> Nay, nay, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alciron,</hi> be not
too inqui<U+017F>itive; be contented <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall be yours. And what? <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> will
<U+017F>he Love me? Still too much curio<U+017F>ity, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alciron,</hi> can you not be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall be yours? But <hi>Tirintes,</hi> take <U+017F>pecial heed that neither you nor any
other whom<U+017F>oever, look into it; for the con<U+017F>equence will be very bad: and if you
<U+017F>hould before you are aware, ca<U+017F>t your eye upon it, come pre<U+017F>ently unto me, that I
may remedy the fault which you <U+017F>hall commit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tirintes</hi> took this Mirrour with much contentment and thanks, and to lo<U+017F>e no
time, went pre<U+017F>ently unto <hi>Silvanire,</hi> unto whom he pre<U+017F>ented the gla<U+017F>s with many
<U+017F>upplications <U+017F>he would be plea<U+017F>ed to take it. And becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he made <U+017F>ome que<U+017F>tion
whether <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould receive it from him; as thinking it not hand<U+017F>ome, for any maid
to take any thing from a young Shepherd, without the knowledg of her Parents, he
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed her with <U+017F>o many humble entreaties, and arguments of per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion; that at
la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he would give him that <U+017F>atisfaction; but upon condition, that <U+017F>he would keep
it no longer then <U+017F>he plea<U+017F>ed. So after <U+017F>he had looked in it, and much commended
it, <U+017F>he gave it him pre<U+017F>ently back: he who <U+017F>aw his de<U+017F>ign was attained, he pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
her no farther, but was well <U+017F>atisfied that he had done as <hi>Alciron</hi> appointed him:
but his contentment la<U+017F>ted but a while; for pre<U+017F>ently after, <hi>Silvanire</hi> was taken
with <U+017F>uch a giddine<U+017F>s in her head, and <U+017F>uch a drow<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, that <U+017F>he fell a <U+017F>leep, and
they could not awake her, <U+017F>he was troubled above three hours in this manner, and
none knew her di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>The noi<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ently ran about the Town, that this Fair One was poi<U+017F>oned, and no
hopes of life left in her: you may imagine that <hi>Aglantes</hi> and <hi>Tirintes</hi> did run with
<U+017F>ad hearts to <U+017F>ee what the matter was: but as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Tirintes</hi> <U+017F>aw her in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he knew it to be an effect of the Mirrour, which made him <U+017F>o extreamly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
again<U+017F>t <hi>Alciron,</hi> that had he met him, doubtle<U+017F>s he had dyed for it. This villain
(<U+017F>aid he to him<U+017F>elf) de<U+017F>igned her death, to deliver me from the affection which I
bare unto her: but cruel wretch that he is, he never con<U+017F>idered that my life depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon hers, and that when <U+017F>he dies, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to live: O thou mo<U+017F>t
inhumane Tiger! Could<U+017F>t thou find a heart to hurt this Fair One? Who never
thought thee the lea<U+017F>t hurt? Certainly, the blacke<U+017F>t fiend in Hell was thy Nur<U+017F>e and
gave thee <U+017F>uck: but Barbarian, thou <U+017F>halt receive a death by no other hand but my
own: Oh <hi>Tirintes, Tirintes!</hi> Can<U+017F>t thou know who did this damned act, and live
or breath without revenge?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:53527:164"/>
This Shepherd in this mind, went as fa<U+017F>t as ever he could to <U+017F>eek <hi>Alciron,</hi> tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with <U+017F>o much fury, that had he met him, he had never told who hurt him:
In the mean time <hi>Silvanire</hi> grew wor<U+017F>e and wor<U+017F>e, and none looked for any thing
but death. Among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e that were in the Chamber, and who, <U+017F>adly re<U+017F>ented this
lo<U+017F>s, was the <U+017F>ad <hi>Aglantes,</hi> who<U+017F>e grief was <U+017F>o great, that he <U+017F>wooned almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>oon
as <U+017F>he. <hi>Menander</hi> al<U+017F>o and <hi>Lerice,</hi> who<U+017F>e hopes and comfort was in this Fair Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<U+017F>eeing her in this <U+017F>ad condition, they repented that they had lived <U+017F>o long, and
accu<U+017F>ed the Gods of cruelty, in be<U+017F>towing <U+017F>o many rare endowments upon <hi>Silva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi>
and depriving them of her <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon; all eyes that <U+017F>aw her in this <U+017F>tate, were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into tears in <U+017F>uch abundance, that nothing could be heard but <U+017F>ighs, groans, and
great lamentations. At the la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he being in extream agony, and not looking to
live, <U+017F>he forced her <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>peak thus unto her Father and Mother, who <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ighing
and <U+017F>obbing by her bed <U+017F>ide.</p>
                     <p>Father, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I am afraid, le<U+017F>t the Gods <U+017F>hould be offended at your exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive
<U+017F>orrow for my death; you know better then I call tell you, that life is not more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
then death; and tho<U+017F>e who begin to live, begin it with a condition to dye:
why then <U+017F>hould you be <U+017F>orry, that I am now ready to pay that debt, which all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
are obliged to pay unto death? Perhaps you are <U+017F>orry the Fatal Si<U+017F>ters have
<U+017F>pun the thred of my life no longer, and your good nature makes you de<U+017F>ire, that
as you preceded me in life, <U+017F>o you might in death: But Oh my dear Father, con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how good and wi<U+017F>e the Gods are; who fore<U+017F>eeing the mi<U+017F>erable condition of a
young woman that is deprived of Father and Mother, they would not leave me in
this wicked world without a guide: if you do but con<U+017F>ider this favour which they
do me, you will acknowledg it to be the greate<U+017F>t they ever gave me. But perhaps
you will complain, that having taken <U+017F>o much care, and be<U+017F>towed <U+017F>o much co<U+017F>t in
my education, I <U+017F>hould now be taken from you, when I am be<U+017F>t able to render you

to de<U+017F>ire longer life, it is this; for it is a kind of ingratitude not to de<U+017F>ire the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that debt which I ow: at this word, her pain forced her to <U+017F>top, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a little <U+017F>trength, and <U+017F>he gave lei<U+017F>ure unto all that heard her, to admire her wi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and courage, thinking her to re<U+017F>emble a Candle, which gives greate<U+017F>t light at
the la<U+017F>t end: this con<U+017F>ideration forced <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ighs and tears, from all that heard
and <U+017F>aw her, as they were not able to <U+017F>peak; <U+017F>o as when <U+017F>he had recollected a little
<U+017F>trength, <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke again unto <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice</hi> in this manner.</p>
                     <p>I have many things to <U+017F>ay, but my end which I perceive approacheth, does hinder
me; only I be<U+017F>eech you both, my dear Father and Mother, to conform your <U+017F>elves
unto the divine will of God: and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elves, that I <U+017F>hould depart from hence
more contentedly then ever I lived, were I but ea<U+017F>ed of two burthens, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
oppre<U+017F>s me. <hi>Menander</hi> then forcing him<U+017F>elf to <U+017F>peak, di<U+017F>charge your heart
my deare<U+017F>t child (<U+017F>aid he unto her) and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, that as never Father had a
better child then I, <U+017F>o never child had a Father who loved her more then I do you.
This permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion (<U+017F>aid <hi>Silvanire</hi>) is the only thing that can make me leave this life
with contentment; which <U+017F>ince you are plea<U+017F>ed to allow, I <U+017F>hall tell you Father and
Mother al<U+017F>o, that I was extreamly troubled, having received <U+017F>o many favours and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
from your goodne<U+017F>s, and having been hitherto <U+017F>o unhappy in my return of
that <U+017F>ervice which I ow unto you both, as I <U+017F>hall grieve in my very <U+017F>oul if your good

bed pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed <hi>Menander</hi> to give her a <U+017F>peedy permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which he freely did, and
then <hi>Silvanire</hi> fetched a deep <U+017F>igh, and lifting her eyes up to Heaven to <U+017F>hew her
extream contentment, and forced her <U+017F>elf to utter the<U+017F>e weak words.</p>
                     <p>You have both of you <U+017F>o often taught me, that ingratitude is the mo<U+017F>t dete<U+017F>table

vice among<U+017F>t humanes, as I think the Gods would never forgive me, if I pre<U+017F>ented
my <U+017F>elf before them, <U+017F>tained with that horrid <U+017F>in. Therefore I cannot hide the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
contentment which this your permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion brings me; <U+017F>ince by it, I may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wa<U+017F>h away the crime, but al<U+017F>o the thought that I was guilty of it. Then taking a
little breath, and <U+017F>triving again<U+017F>t the violence of her di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he continued thus:
You <U+017F>ee (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and pointed at <hi>Aglantes</hi>) that Shepherd who <U+017F>tands at my beds-feet,
and who <U+017F>eems to re<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly, be plea<U+017F>ed mo<U+017F>t dear Father

to me, that perhaps not any about the River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> can equal him, and
yet all this while, I do prote<U+017F>t, I never could ob<U+017F>erve in him, the lea<U+017F>t action or word
that could offend the mo<U+017F>t mode<U+017F>t maid upon earth; but the great Gods who know
my actions, my words, and my mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret thoughts, are my witne<U+017F><U+017F>es and judges,
whether in all this time I ever let this Shepherd know that his amity and affection was
plea<U+017F>ing unto me. And yet <hi>Aglantes</hi> do not think that any <U+017F>corn was the cau<U+017F>e of
it, for I know you de<U+017F>erve better then what you de<U+017F>ire: but it was only the duty of
a maid, as I am, which con<U+017F>trained me to u<U+017F>e you <U+017F>o.</p>
                     <p>Upon this word, feeling her <U+017F>elf extreamly in pain; Oh death! (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he with a

which I began. Then taking a little breath; Oh <hi>Aglantes,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, though I
have been brought up in the<U+017F>e Woods, and among<U+017F>t wild Rocks, yet am I not <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
as they: your Virtue, your Love, and your Di<U+017F>cretion, did work that effect

never to let you know that good will which I wi<U+017F>hed unto you<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and from hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
all tho<U+017F>e incivilities, and di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ies which you have erceived from me. But
now, <U+017F>ince the Gods, who are all goodne<U+017F>s and wi<U+017F>dom, have by my death untied tho<U+017F>e
knots which tyed my tongue, as <U+017F>ince tho<U+017F>e who have the power over me, do give
me leave: Know friend, that never was any greater affection conceived in the heart
of any human, then the affection which <hi>Silvanire</hi> does bear unto you. And that I
may be cleerly purged from that ingratitude, wherewith I might be charged, give
me a little farther leave, Oh my mo<U+017F>t dear Parents; which they permitting, and <U+017F>he
thanking them; <U+017F>he ha<U+017F>ted to utter the<U+017F>e words: Alas! (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I can do no more.
Then holding out her hand unto the Shepherd, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto him; here <hi>Aglantes,</hi>

                     <p>The Father who had another de<U+017F>ign, would not have been <U+017F>o forward if he had

head gently towards her Shepherd: Oh Gods! (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I die, but <hi>Aglantes</hi> I die
thine: Upon this word <U+017F>he grew <U+017F>peechle<U+017F>s, and lay as dead in the arms of <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <hi>Lerice.</hi> To relate here all the lamentations and cryes of the Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and principally of <hi>Aglantes,</hi> I conceive it not pertinent; for it will ea<U+017F>ily be

her, even by plain force, and carry them away, for grief did enrage <hi>Aglantes:</hi> &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

<hi>Alciron</hi> prevented them, who told them that it was not humane to bury people,

<U+017F>o as upon this, they left her without pulling off her clothes, in this <U+017F>ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

<U+017F>aw him enter, he rou<U+017F>ed out of bed to run upon him; but <hi>Alciron</hi> holding

the door half open half <U+017F>hut; <hi>Tirintes</hi> <U+017F>aid he unto him, can you po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly imagine,
that he who loves you the be<U+017F>t of all the world, <U+017F>hould ever deprive you of that
which you hold mo<U+017F>t dear? And yet cruel Tyger, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and interrupted him,
the Fair <hi>Silvanire</hi> is dead. <hi>Silvanire,</hi> replied <hi>Alciron,</hi> is alive, and I will die the mo<U+017F>t
cruel death your rage can invent, if I do not put her into your hands alive, and well,
within this hour, if you will let me go where <U+017F>he is. <hi>Tirintes</hi> all amazed at this, is
not <hi>Silvanire</hi> dead? <U+017F>aid he, and did not you cau<U+017F>e her to be let in the room by her
<U+017F>elf? It is true (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alciron</hi> and <U+017F>miled) but <U+017F>he is left there for you; Oh good
Gods! <hi>Alciron</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes</hi>) <hi>Silvanire</hi> to be dead, and to be for me are two things
that cannot hold together. I confe<U+017F>s, replied <hi>Alciron,</hi> that they cannot; but to be
alive, and be yours may: Surely, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> you do deceive me: why <U+017F>hould I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alciron</hi>) or indeed how can I, when I offer, if you will go with
me, to put her into your hands alive and well the <U+017F>ame hour? And if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e,
why <U+017F>hould I come unto you? You <U+017F>ee I do not <U+017F>hun you, nor fear meeting
with you. Come, come, <U+017F>et your mind at re<U+017F>t; dre<U+017F>s your <U+017F>elf, and come with me,
and you <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ee what I <U+017F>ay punctually performed. But prethee tell me,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and <U+017F>hrugged his <U+017F>houlders, can you fetch <U+017F>ouls back after they be
once wa<U+017F>ted over the Stigian Lake? Will <hi>Charon</hi> <U+017F>uffer that? No, no, I cannot (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Alciron</hi>) but <hi>Tirintes</hi> know mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly that <hi>Silvanire</hi> is not dead, but by
a <U+017F>ecret virtue of nature, which is in that gla<U+017F>s which you had of me, <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o <U+017F>tupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that every one thinks her <U+017F>o. Oh Heavens, cryed out <hi>Tirintes,</hi> what wonders
do you tell me? I tell you nothing but truth (replied <hi>Alciron</hi>) and to <U+017F>atisfie your
wonder, and perplexity, know <hi>Tirintes,</hi> that the gla<U+017F>s is made of a Stone, called
the <hi>Memphitique Stone,</hi> which has a virtue to <U+017F>tupifie the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es <U+017F>o extreamly, that
as <U+017F>oon as it is touched by the eye, it pre<U+017F>ently takes away the under<U+017F>tanding: And
unto this Stone is added <U+017F>ome of the bones of a Fi<U+017F>h, which is called the <hi>Torpedo,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by <U+017F>uch art, and concocted together, that as the <hi>Torpedo</hi> benums the arm of
the Fi<U+017F>her, when it touches the hook that is fa<U+017F>tned to the line; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o as <U+017F>oon as
the eyes are touched by this gla<U+017F>s, they receive a poy<U+017F>on <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtile, that fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ing
upon the brain, it dilates a general <U+017F>tupifaction all over the body, as every one
would think it dead. Now <hi>Tirintes,</hi> judge whether I have not rea<U+017F>on to complain
again<U+017F>t you, who ever found my extream affection flowing towards you; and yet
can think I would offer <U+017F>uch a mortal di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure: what advantage could you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
I could draw from the death of this woman? If it be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and went
neerer him, you were to blame Shepherd in that you did not acquaint me with it:
By that, replied <hi>Alciron,</hi> you may better know that I do love you; for did I not
know Shepherd, that thou neither woulde<U+017F>t nor coulde<U+017F>t live after thou wert depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of <hi>Silvanire,</hi> and coulde<U+017F>t thou hope ever that thy <U+017F>ervices or thy merits could
gain her? I know, that having but that only remedy, thou would<U+017F>t never have
u<U+017F>ed it, if I had acquainted thee with all the effects of it: con<U+017F>ider <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly with your
<U+017F>elf, and an<U+017F>wer me; <U+017F>hould I have told you, that as <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Silvanire</hi> did look
in the gla<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he would fall into <U+017F>uch extremity of pain, as <U+017F>he would fall down like
dead, and being <U+017F>o judged by all that <U+017F>ee her, they will embowel her, and put her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her grave: an<U+017F>wer me I <U+017F>ay <hi>Tirintes,</hi> dur<U+017F>t you have executed <U+017F>uch an enterpri<U+017F>e

attempts upon the party Loved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tirintes</hi> hearing this, and knowing that <hi>Silvanire</hi> was not dead, he held out his
arms, and went to embrace <hi>Alciron,</hi> with <U+017F>uch abundance of contentment, that he
was almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>peechle<U+017F>s; but recovering him<U+017F>elf, he asked a hundred pardons for the
anger which he had conceived again<U+017F>t him: and dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf as fa<U+017F>t as ever he
could, he be<U+017F>eeched him to conduct him unto the room where <hi>Silvanire</hi> re<U+017F>ted, to
the end that <U+017F>he who was the life of his <U+017F>oul, might not remain any longer in the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
of death. But dear friend, continued <hi>Tirintes,</hi> by the way as they went, when
<hi>Silvanire</hi> is taken out of the vault, (for you mu<U+017F>t under<U+017F>tand that they had carried
her out of the Town into one) How do you mean <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall be mine? Yours? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Alciron,</hi> who will take her from you? Does not every one think her dead?
And when <U+017F>he is in your hands, who will ask her of you? Oh <hi>Tirintes, Tirintes!</hi>
learn how to make u<U+017F>e of the time pre<U+017F>ent, as well as I do: and if you do not, blame
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53527:166"/>
not me, but your <U+017F>elf. With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this they came to the place where
the Vault was; where the <U+017F>tone being pre<U+017F>ently taken away, <hi>Silvanire</hi> was found in
the <U+017F>ame condition they left her, at which <hi>Tirintes</hi> was extreamly a<U+017F>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the a<U+017F><U+017F>urances of life which <hi>Alciron</hi> gave him. But to <U+017F>ee the wonderful qualities
and effects of <U+017F>ome things which Nature doth produce; as <U+017F>oon as ever <hi>Alciron</hi> threw
a little water which he had in a little Bottle, into her face, and rubbed her pul<U+017F>e and
temples, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hewed <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ignes of Life; <U+017F>he began to breath, and pre<U+017F>ently after
<U+017F>he perfectly waked. Then <U+017F>aid <hi>Alciron</hi> unto <hi>Tirintes;</hi> Here Friend, I give you
<hi>Silvanire,</hi> I have performed my promi<U+017F>e, and make u<U+017F>e of your Fortune and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity:
Upon this he left them alone together, as thinking that he had no more
to do with them.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Silvanire</hi> opening her eyes, and finding her <U+017F>elf in that place, and at that time,
for it was hardly day, <U+017F>he was the mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed woman in the world; for <U+017F>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
all that had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed very well: but <U+017F>he could not imagine how <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
come out of the Tombe: <U+017F>o as remaining a while in her a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, and <U+017F>eeing
none by her but <hi>Tirintes;</hi> Shepherd (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) I pray tell me what miracles
are the<U+017F>e? Faire<U+017F>t <hi>Silvanire,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, I can tell you no more, but that they are the
ordinary effects of your Beauty. But <hi>Tirintes,</hi> replied <U+017F>he, have not I been dead?
and, am I not now alive? You are not only alive, replied he, but can give life unto
whom you plea<U+017F>e. If I was dead, added <hi>Silvanire,</hi> how came I to be alive again?
who was able to bring me back from the Stygian Lake? One that is <U+017F>o fair as <hi>Silva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi>
an<U+017F>wered the Shepherd, cannot <U+017F>tay in <U+017F>o foul a place. This is flattery, <U+017F>aid
the Shepherde<U+017F>s, but pray <hi>Tirintes</hi> tell me <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, was I not dead? and am I not
now alive? Dead you never were I am <U+017F>ure <U+017F>ince I knew you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> for you
were alwaies alive in my heart. The truth is, the affection of <hi>Tirintes</hi> unto you is
<U+017F>uch, that when death was ready to triumph over you, I changed death into <U+017F>leep,
and afterwards, that <U+017F>leep into the condition wherein now you are. Your affection
replied <hi>Silvanire,</hi> changed my death into <U+017F>leep, and that <U+017F>leep into the condition
I now am in? How could you do it? For my part I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand

                     <p>
                        <hi>Tirintes</hi> who had no mind to <U+017F>tay any longer in that place, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be found
by <U+017F>ome who might mar all the plot before him, he thought it be<U+017F>t to deal plainly,
and tell her truly the whole pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. Know therefore <hi>Silvanire</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) that to <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your curio<U+017F>ity, after I had loved, <U+017F>erved, and adored you with infinite devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and found all to be in vain, I had recour<U+017F>e unto Art. Do you remember a
Gla<U+017F>s which I be<U+017F>eeched you to take from my hand? I do remember it very well an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<U+017F>he, for I never had my health <U+017F>ince. That Gla<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> was of
<U+017F>uch a compo<U+017F>ition, that as <U+017F>oon as any did look in it, they were pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>urprized
with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tupifaction and lethargie, that they would <U+017F>eem to be dead: The <U+017F>ame
operation it had upon you; and they laid you in this Vault, from whence I now
come to take you out. Oh Heavens! cryed out <hi>Silvanire,</hi> How dangerous all men
are? But what was your de<U+017F>igne in <U+017F>o doing? My de<U+017F>ign was, an<U+017F>wered he, to do
as I did, that is, to make all believe that you were dead, and afterwards to live the
re<U+017F>t of our days together in <U+017F>ome place where none might trouble us. Oh <hi>Tirintes</hi>
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and <U+017F>hook her head, could you ever imagine I would con<U+017F>ent unto it? I
thought (<U+017F>aid he) that an ob<U+017F>tinate <U+017F>ervice might <U+017F>urmount your ob<U+017F>tinate rigour. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
(an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) which is not plea<U+017F>ing, is always in vain. Love, replied he, did
put me into that hope. Love, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, is never the Author of <U+017F>uch Trea<U+017F>on;
and that you may find the truth of what I <U+017F>ay, Love will <U+017F>o puni<U+017F>h your trea<U+017F>on,
that you have quite lo<U+017F>t all the hopes of my being ever yours; you are much mi<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Shepherd in your de<U+017F>igns, for <hi>Silvanire</hi> is not her own to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of if <U+017F>he would.
How, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes,</hi> not <hi>Silvanire</hi> her own, unto whom is <U+017F>he given? She is his,
replied the Shepherde<U+017F>s, unto whom you have given her, which is, unto <hi>Aglantes.</hi>
Who I? replied <hi>Tirintes,</hi> Did I ever give you unto <hi>Aglantes?</hi> Yes, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanire,
Tirintes</hi> did give me unto <hi>Aglantes:</hi> Hearken and I will tell you how:
<hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice</hi> my parents, did intend to marry me unto the Shepherd <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes:</hi>
And the truth is, by my good will I would never marry any but <hi>Aglantes;</hi>
Death is more welcome to me a thou<U+017F>and times, then to be the wife of any other:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53527:166"/>
yet I was <U+017F>o fully re<U+017F>olved never to fail in my duty to my Parents, that <hi>Aglantes,</hi> nor
any other, <U+017F>hould never make me fail in my obedience to them. Now being in this
extremity of pain, your artifice did obtain that for me, which otherwi<U+017F>e I never
dur<U+017F>t ask; The poi<U+017F>on in your gla<U+017F>s proved my happine<U+017F>s: So as when every one
did think me dead, Love did in<U+017F>pire me to ask my Parents con<U+017F>ent to be<U+017F>tow my <U+017F>elf
upon <hi>Aglantes,</hi> in gratitude and reward of his long and faithful <U+017F>ervices: They <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me in great pain, did give me free leave to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of my <U+017F>elf; upon which I
took <hi>Aglantes</hi> by the hand, and declared my <U+017F>elf to be his wife: Therefore <hi>Tirintes,</hi>
your hopes are all bla<U+017F>ted, and it is in vain for you to attempt any further. Come,
come (<U+017F>aid <hi>Tirintes</hi> in a great rage) <hi>Menander, Lerice,</hi> and <hi>Aglantes</hi> al<U+017F>o are dead
unto you, as you are to them. Upon this he offered to take her by the arm, and
carry her away: But the Shepherde<U+017F>s with a greater confidence then the place could
allow her, did <U+017F>toutly defend her <U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t his violence; <U+017F>omtimes by per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions,
otherwhiles oppo<U+017F>ing force again<U+017F>t force, and <U+017F>omtimes flying. But <U+017F>he <U+017F>eeing him
pa<U+017F>t all re<U+017F>pect, and that her flight and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance was in vain, <U+017F>he was con<U+017F>trained to
cry out: As Fortune was, <hi>Aglantes</hi> came in upon her voice, who (as I under<U+017F>tood
<U+017F>ince) was looking for the Tomb of that Shepherde<U+017F>s, that he might there end his
days: When he <U+017F>aw her fir<U+017F>t, he had an opinion that it was <U+017F>ome delu<U+017F>ion of his
Fancy; but afterwards, knowing him to be <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and hearing her voice, he
knew that <U+017F>he was alive whom he thought to be dead: and fell into <U+017F>uch an extream
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that he fell furiou<U+017F>ly upon <hi>Tirintes;</hi> <U+017F>o doubtle<U+017F>s one of them had ended
his days, (for they were both extreamly incen<U+017F>ed) had not a great number of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
come in and parted them; and who <U+017F>eizing upon the mi<U+017F>erable <hi>Tirintes,</hi> brought
him hither before you, oh <U+017F>age <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> to be puni<U+017F>hed according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his offence.</p>
                     <p>But all the<U+017F>e that came in the company, did not come upon the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e; for
the joy and contentment of <hi>Menander, Lerice,</hi> and <hi>Aglantes</hi> was <U+017F>o great, that they
would willingly have forgotten the injury, or at the lea<U+017F>t would have di<U+017F>dained all
revenge. But their coming is to have judgement upon another difference which
hath hapned <U+017F>ince.</p>
                     <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed to know therefore, oh Reverend Father, That this great Tumult being
appea<U+017F>ed, and <hi>Tirintes</hi> in the hands of tho<U+017F>e who have brought him hither, <hi>Aglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
full of joy to <U+017F>ee the fair <hi>Silvanire</hi> ri<U+017F>en from the dead, or to <U+017F>ay better, born
again, addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf unto <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice,</hi> he be<U+017F>ought them both that
they would be plea<U+017F>ed to con<U+017F>ummate his happine<U+017F>s by a conclu<U+017F>ion of this <U+017F>o much
de<U+017F>ired marriage, as thinking that the delay of <U+017F>uch a happy union could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
unto any. <hi>Menander</hi> at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tood a while mute, <U+017F>eeming as if he heard
not; but <hi>Aglantes</hi> <U+017F>econding his fir<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire with mo<U+017F>t earne<U+017F>t <U+017F>upplications, he took
notice that <hi>Menander</hi> walking about the room with his hands behind him, he mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<U+017F>o as none could under<U+017F>tand him, or as if he was deaf on that ear; but he went
<U+017F>haking his head, as it is u<U+017F>ual for one to do that would deny a reque<U+017F>t. This <U+017F>ilence
and this action did exceedingly <U+017F>urprize <hi>Aglantes;</hi> for he thought his marriage <U+017F>o
<U+017F>ure, that when he <U+017F>aw the old man make a doubt of it, he fir<U+017F>t grew pale, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
was taken with an extream trembling. Many of the Shepherds that were
in the room wondering at the <U+017F>ilence of <hi>Menander,</hi> and his way of proceeding,
they drew nearer, and <U+017F>eeing <hi>Aglantes</hi> in that condition, to wit, almo<U+017F>t be<U+017F>ide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
they feared that if <hi>Menander</hi> did not keep his word, <U+017F>ome fatal accident would
befal his hou<U+017F>e; therefore gathering about him, they be<U+017F>eeched him not to trouble
their great joys, by <U+017F>uch an alteration as appeared to be in him: But <hi>Menander</hi> not
<U+017F>o much as giving them a look, he walked <U+017F>till on, and held his eyes fixed upon the
ground. Friends (<U+017F>aid he unto them at la<U+017F>t) New matters, new re<U+017F>olutions. How,
replied <hi>Aglantes,</hi> New matters, new re<U+017F>olutions? What do you mean by that?
My menning is, replied <hi>Menander,</hi> That when I promi<U+017F>ed my daughter unto yon,
I thought her dead, and <U+017F>o I am contented <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be yours; But now, <U+017F>ince
(thanks be to heaven) <U+017F>he is alive, I mean to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her another way. <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
(an<U+017F>wered <hi>Aglantes</hi>) you have already given your Daughter unto me, her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
con<U+017F>ents unto it, and <hi>Silvanire</hi> would have it <U+017F>o: I have accordingly taken her,
I conceive her to be mine, and none can take her from me, but they mu<U+017F>t take away
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53527:167"/>
my life al<U+017F>o. Your life (replied <hi>Menander</hi>) is nothing unto me; but my Daughter
is my own, and none can take her from me; you cannot pretend unto her by vertue
of my promi<U+017F>e; for if promi<U+017F>es oblige, <hi>Theantes</hi> may better claim her as his, becau<U+017F>e
I made a promi<U+017F>e unto him long before any to you: Therefore <hi>Aglantes,</hi> if you
have a mind to marry, you may do well to look for a wi<U+017F>e <U+017F>omwhere el<U+017F>e. Oh ye
good Gods (cryed out <hi>Aglantes,</hi> <U+017F>tamping his foot again<U+017F>t the ground, and <U+017F>triking
his hands together) Oh heavens! oh Earth! is there any Ju<U+017F>tice among<U+017F>t men? Is
it not beyond the bounds of any patience to endure <U+017F>o great a wrong.</p>
                     <p>All the Shepherds who heard them talk thus, fearing (and with rea<U+017F>on) <U+017F>ome
great di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ter if this di<U+017F>pute went any further, they gathered them<U+017F>elves together, and
were of opinion that the be<U+017F>t cour<U+017F>e was to pre<U+017F>ent them<U+017F>elves before you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<U+017F>uch judgement as in your prudence you <U+017F>hould think mo<U+017F>t fit in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e. It
was not without much ado that they con<U+017F>ented unto it; for <hi>Menander</hi> thought it an
undervaluing him<U+017F>elf and his daughter; and <hi>Aglantes</hi> could not endure a thing <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his due, <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o much as di<U+017F>puted, or put unto the arbitriment of men: yet
at la<U+017F>t, by the mediation of friends and kinred, they were per<U+017F>waded to <U+017F>ubmit unto
what<U+017F>oever <U+017F>hould be ordained by you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner ended, but <hi>Menander</hi> tran<U+017F>ported with rage, and not
<U+017F>taying till the <hi>Druide</hi> gave him permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to <U+017F>peak; he <U+017F>tood up, and in a loud voice
began thus: I do demand Ju<U+017F>tice, Oh <U+017F>age <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> again<U+017F>t the in<U+017F>olency of
this age; which would take away from a Father, that power which nature hath given
him over his child: I do conjure you to maintain, that which all Laws ordains, all
cu<U+017F>toms ob<U+017F>erve, and all the world approves of: I demand no novelties, <U+017F>ince from
the beginning of time, Fathers have u<U+017F>ed to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of their own children: I require
nothing but what is ju<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince nothing is more equitable then for every one to be
the Ma<U+017F>ter and Lord of his own workman<U+017F>hip: and I require nothing but what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to natural <U+017F>ence and rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>ince it is rea<U+017F>onable, that tho<U+017F>e whom a grave
experience has preferred above others, <U+017F>hould be believed and obeyed, in what they
advi<U+017F>e and appoint. The whole di<U+017F>pute re<U+017F>ts upon this <U+017F>ingle point, whether a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may not di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of his child as he will: If the negative, then I have lo<U+017F>t my cau<U+017F>e;
but then I would advi<U+017F>e all Fathers, never to care for having any children, nor to
trouble them<U+017F>elves with giving any education unto them, <U+017F>ince they are not their
children, but their companions nay, their Ma<U+017F>ters; if the Proverb be true, which
<U+017F>ays, <hi>Have a Companion, and have a Ma<U+017F>ter.</hi> Then will the Father, who is Lord
Paramont in his little Republique, be outed of his Dominion by him whom he bred
in his own bo<U+017F>om; Oh mo<U+017F>t depraved age! I have <U+017F>een the time when if a child had
in the lea<U+017F>t circum<U+017F>tance di<U+017F>-obeyed the command of a Father, he had been hi<U+017F><U+017F>ed at
in the <U+017F>treet, and pointed at by every finger: but now, it is grown wit to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer;
it is courage and <U+017F>pirit to <U+017F>light commands, and it is duty in a child to u<U+017F>urp
authority from the Father. The name of Father, <U+017F>age <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> does <U+017F>ignifie
ab<U+017F>olute Lord and Soveraign Ma<U+017F>ter of his child. This being <U+017F>o, I am mo<U+017F>t confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that you honour the Gods <U+017F>o far, as to maintain my Title and Prerogative
over this young Daughter which is mine, and whom I have brought up with <U+017F>uch
abundance of care, co<U+017F>t and paines. For my part, I will u<U+017F>e no other argument but
this, <U+017F>he is my Daughter; if <U+017F>he be mine, I may di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her as I plea<U+017F>e. If the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition
of her be taken from me, It mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be declared that <U+017F>he is none of mine:
and if I may di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of her, I do give her unto the Shepherd <hi>Theantes,</hi> according to
my promi<U+017F>e long <U+017F>ince made unto him: of this, <hi>Aglantes</hi> cannot complain, becau<U+017F>e
he has no right but what he claims by promi<U+017F>e; but if my promi<U+017F>e oblige, then that
promi<U+017F>e which I made fir<U+017F>t unto <hi>Theantes,</hi> has much more <U+017F>trength and validity in it,
by rea<U+017F>on of precedency: and therefore I conclude, that, Oh <hi>Aglantes,</hi> if you have
any de<U+017F>ire to marry, you mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>eek <U+017F>omewhere el<U+017F>e for a wife.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Menander</hi> ended, and <hi>Aglantes</hi> offered to an<U+017F>wer, but becau<U+017F>e <hi>Silvanire</hi>
thought that his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion perhaps would make him over <U+017F>harp in his argument, <U+017F>he
pulled him by the arm and interrupted him, be<U+017F>eeching <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> to appoint
<U+017F>ome other to an<U+017F>wer for them, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>pirit was le<U+017F>s po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with anger and chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler;
for el<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>Aglantes</hi> in the heat of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, may utter <U+017F>omthing which
may di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e <hi>Menander. Cloridamantes</hi> admiring the di<U+017F>cretion of this young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53527:167"/>
man, and impo<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ilence upon <hi>Aglantes,</hi> he looked among<U+017F>t all the Company
for one that <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak in his behalf; and after he had veiwed them all, he made
choi<U+017F>e of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> to an<U+017F>wer <hi>Menander,</hi> and plead tho<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons which <hi>Aglantes</hi>
could alledge. The Shepherd would gladly have excu<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf, becau<U+017F>e he was
in no good humour: but thinking it a crime to refu<U+017F>e any thing the <hi>Druide</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
he undertook it: <U+017F>o after he had required a little time to con<U+017F>ider how he
<U+017F>hould frame his Arguments, he began thus:</p>
                     <q>
                        <floatingText xml:lang="unk">
                           <body>
                              <div type="speech">
                                 <head>The an<U+017F>wer of Sylvander, in behalf of Aglantes
and Silvanire.</head>
                                 <p>THE weight which you lay upon me, Oh wi<U+017F>e <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> is a little too
heavy for my weak <U+017F>houlders to bear: for it is not a light matter to <U+017F>peak
in this place, or to undertake the cleering of the duty from a child to the
father, or the authority of a father over his child: there are few here
who are not intere<U+017F>ted, either as a father, or as a child; and to hold the ballance <U+017F>o
even, as it <U+017F>hall not lean more on one <U+017F>ide then another, is not a thing <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
may perhaps think it. Do not think <hi>Aglantes,</hi> that if by the command of this
Reverend <hi>Druide,</hi> I do undertake to an<U+017F>wer <hi>Menander,</hi> it is any way to maintain,
that children are not obliged to obey their parents; God forbid I <U+017F>hould utter <U+017F>uch
a word, for all our <U+017F>ervices and all our obedience that we can render unto them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
acquit us of that duty which we ow unto them: neither would I have <hi>Menander</hi>
think that if I do declare the exact obedience of children to their Parents, I do infer
thereby as you do, that the Father has power to do what he will with his child. 'Tis
true, the Gods have named them Fathers, but has not made them ab<U+017F>olute Lords of
men; but it is rather to <U+017F>hew the love that the Gods do bear unto them, becau<U+017F>e
nothing can more re<U+017F>emble it then the love of a Father to his child; and to teach
men that they ought to ask all things that are nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for them, and expect them
from their goodne<U+017F>s. For that tyrannical authority which you <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t, is not that
which Fathers ought to have over their children; that does too much re<U+017F>emble the
authority of a Ma<U+017F>ter over his <U+017F>lave: there is a va<U+017F>t difference between a child and a
<U+017F>lave. 'Tis true, a Father ought to be obeyed in all things; but <U+017F>till with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>o,
that the Father do command as he ought, and according to rea<U+017F>on: for a child
is more obliged to obey rea<U+017F>on, then any one that can command him; for it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
which gives him a <U+017F>oul, and makes him different from irrational animals: and
this <U+017F>oul is it which gives him his very being. A man, <hi>Menander,</hi> is compo<U+017F>ed of a
<U+017F>oul and a body; the body he has from his Father, but that is common with all brutes:
The <U+017F>oul he has from God, and this <U+017F>oul is rational: con<U+017F>ider now, whether a man
be obliged more to him that gives the body, or to him that gives the <U+017F>oul; I think
then you will conclude with me, that a child is not bound to obey the command of
the Father, if the command be again<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on; for in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e, his obedience would
be a <U+017F>in: and therefore I <U+017F>ay, Fathers have no <U+017F>uch ab<U+017F>olute power as you imagine,
nay perhaps they have no power at all, if they go beyond the bounds of rea<U+017F>on: 'Tis
true, the child ought not of him<U+017F>elf to judg whether the commands of the Father be
ju<U+017F>t or unju<U+017F>t, or unrea<U+017F>onable, unle<U+017F>s they be <U+017F>o apparently gro<U+017F>s that common
<U+017F>ence will <U+017F>hew them <U+017F>o, but if the child do at any time doubt, he ought alwayes
to incline towards the obeying <U+017F>ide, and that he think his Father more wi<U+017F>e and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to judg then him<U+017F>elf, until tho<U+017F>e who are con<U+017F>tituted judges, do determine
and declare it otherwi<U+017F>e. Now, the ca<U+017F>e which is pre<U+017F>ented before you at this time,
Wi<U+017F>e <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> is of this nature; for here is <hi>Menander,</hi> who is not willing that
<hi>Silvanire</hi> <U+017F>hould marry <hi>Aglantes,</hi> but would have her marry another Shepherd; <U+017F>he
who is wi<U+017F>e, and knows how far the name of daughter does oblige her unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ents her <U+017F>elf before you, to know whether the command be rea<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
or no: It is you, Wi<U+017F>e <hi>Druide,</hi> that mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>et down the Law unto her, for <U+017F>he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53527:168"/>
is ready to obey it; the rea<U+017F>ons of <hi>Menander</hi> are that ab<U+017F>olute power which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
unto over his child: that the promi<U+017F>e which he made unto <hi>Aglantes,</hi> does not
oblige him for two rea<U+017F>ons; the fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e he promi<U+017F>ed <hi>Theantes</hi> before: the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that though he did promi<U+017F>e her unto <hi>Aglantes,</hi> yet it was when he thought
his daughter would dye that <U+017F>ame hour. The rea<U+017F>ons of <hi>Silvanire</hi> and <hi>Aglantes</hi> (for
they are in<U+017F>eparable) are, that the promi<U+017F>e which he made unto <hi>Theantes,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
con<U+017F>ented unto by <hi>Silvanire;</hi> and her con<U+017F>ent unto <hi>Aglantes</hi> was not only in the
pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice,</hi> but al<U+017F>o by their permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, con<U+017F>ent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that the e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of marriage con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts principally in the will of the two parties
who do marry, and therefore rea<U+017F>ons tels her that <U+017F>he is more obliged to perform
this la<U+017F>t promi<U+017F>e, then that which <hi>Menander</hi> made unto <hi>Theantes,</hi> unto which <U+017F>he
was never privy, though had <U+017F>he been called, <U+017F>he would have con<U+017F>ented. As to that
point of <hi>Menanders,</hi> that his intention was not to <U+017F>uffer this marriage, but only
becau<U+017F>e he belived his daughter would dye the <U+017F>ame hour; <hi>Aglantes</hi> an<U+017F>wers, that
contracts are never made by thoughts, but by words: for thoughts are not to be
dived into.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sylvander</hi> would have proceeded, when <hi>Menander</hi> tran<U+017F>ported with extream
impatience, did interrupt him: But upon the fir<U+017F>t word he uttered, <hi>Cloridamantes</hi>
commanded him to be <U+017F>ilent, and <hi>Sylvander</hi> al<U+017F>o, when he offered to continue his
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, telling them, that the ca<U+017F>e was well enough under<U+017F>tood, and therefore
there needed no more time to be <U+017F>pent. At the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant <hi>Theantes</hi> de<U+017F>ired audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and in a loud voice <U+017F>aid, Oh wi<U+017F>e <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> there is no greater folly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sun, then to love without any hopes of ever being loved again; and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is a mo<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable torment when it is not tyed with mutual and reciprocal knots,
and therefore I conclude and declare, that <hi>Silvanire</hi> may marry, but never <hi>Theantes:</hi>
Upon this he made an humble reverence to the <hi>Druide,</hi> and the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, and went
his way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> then ro<U+017F>e up to ask the opinion of other <hi>Druids,</hi> and to give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the ca<U+017F>e; But <hi>Tirintes,</hi> who could not with any patience endure to hear
that <hi>Silvanire</hi> <U+017F>hould be given unto any other, he <U+017F>aid with a raging voice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen<U+017F>ed
eye, Who is he that does accu<U+017F>e me? and why am I kept here a pri<U+017F>oner?
<hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde</hi> then began to <U+017F>peak; Wicked Shepherd, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, Dare you be <U+017F>o
impudent as to ask why you are kept here, or who will accu<U+017F>e you? Does not your
own con<U+017F>cience tell you, that never was a greater malefactor brought before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of any Ju<U+017F>tice? Does not every thing, every circum<U+017F>tance accu<U+017F>e you of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
and Infidelity? The Heavens that <U+017F>ee you, the Earth that bears you, Trees,
Men, Gods, and all things, oh perfidious and mi<U+017F>erable Shepherd, do accu<U+017F>e you,
and call for vengeance upon your crime.</p>
                     <p>Every one wondered to hear <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde</hi> give <U+017F>uch tart language; for there was very
few in the whole a<U+017F><U+017F>embly who did not know that <U+017F>he loved <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and though
unfruitfully, yet had done long; <U+017F>o as to <U+017F>ee her now thus exa<U+017F>perated again<U+017F>t him,
it <U+017F>eemed much again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>tream of her long continued cu<U+017F>tome, and it was <U+017F>trange
that her extream affection <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon change it <U+017F>elf into <U+017F>uch an implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
as <U+017F>he would have made him lo<U+017F>e his life. But <hi>Tirintes</hi> <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till, and without
any alteration in his countenance, Speak (<U+017F>aid he) unto the Judges if you have any
charge again<U+017F>t me, it is they from whom you mu<U+017F>t have ju<U+017F>tice: Do you think I have
not courage enough to abide all your objections? <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde</hi> blu<U+017F>hed at the<U+017F>e words,
and turning towards <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> <U+017F>he be<U+017F>eeched him to <U+017F>it down again, and hear
what <U+017F>he could <U+017F>ay; and then <U+017F>he began thus.</p>
                     <p>This impudent Shepherd, oh wi<U+017F>e <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> who is brought before you, is
the mo<U+017F>t worthy of death of any man that lives; he <U+017F>ays he loves <hi>Silvanire,</hi> but who
believes him? Nay, who can believe him if they con<U+017F>ider his actions? Mo<U+017F>t certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he never knew the power of Love, though to excu<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf, he would ca<U+017F>t all the
fault upon that God. For what are the effects of love? To <U+017F>erve, to honour, nay
even to adore the per<U+017F>on that is loved: But what witne<U+017F><U+017F>es does this wicked Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
give of his affection unto <hi>Silvanire?</hi> In lieu of <U+017F>erving her, he gives her poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on;
he cau<U+017F>ed her to be buried alive, and <U+017F>uffer intollerable torments; in lieu of
honouring her, he would have bla<U+017F>ted her reputation, and made her the mo<U+017F>t infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53527:168"/>
Shepherde<U+017F>s that lives: if the<U+017F>e be the effects and con<U+017F>equents of Love, I dare
<U+017F>ay that Love has changed its Nature: But haply he will be apt to <U+017F>ay, that the<U+017F>e are
meer impo<U+017F>tures, and a<U+017F>per<U+017F>ions ca<U+017F>t upon him, and that he did never commit any
<U+017F>uch crimes. Sage <hi>Druide,</hi> here is the wicked man, he cannot deny it, his con<U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
flies in his face, and ties his tongue: The truth is, his vilany is <U+017F>o great, that it
is hard to find words to excu<U+017F>e it under the umbrage of a Lover, or with any glo<U+017F><U+017F>es
of affection and fidelity: To give poy<U+017F>on unto a poor innocent woman <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtilly
couched in a gla<U+017F>s, what excu<U+017F>e under heaven is there for <U+017F>uch a black horrid inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
He cannot glo<U+017F>s it over with an excu<U+017F>e of ignorance, nor <U+017F>ay that <hi>Alciron</hi> did
not tell him the effects of it; for it is mo<U+017F>t infallibly certain, his intention was to make
her die, and be revenged upon her for loving another, or at lea<U+017F>t, for having no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
unto him: But <U+017F>eeing his de<U+017F>ign fru<U+017F>trated, perhaps by the <U+017F>trong con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Silvanire,</hi> which re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted the poy<U+017F>on, or as it is mo<U+017F>t probable, by the Will
of God, who would not deprive the world of <U+017F>o fair, <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e and <U+017F>weet a woman,
to excu<U+017F>e or extenuate his crime, he mu<U+017F>t pretend that his intention was only to ca<U+017F>t
her a<U+017F>leep. But oh <U+017F>age <hi>Druide,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you ask the good <hi>Menander, Lerice, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glantes,</hi>
and all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>aw her in the Agony <U+017F>he was, whether in any <U+017F>leeping
fits they u<U+017F>e to have <U+017F>uch cruel pain, <U+017F>uch convul<U+017F>ions, <U+017F>uch contraction of Nerves,
and <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ymptomes of inevitable death; and then judge whether it was not a
mo<U+017F>t mortal poy<U+017F>on, which the Gods by a miracle made ineffectual to his intentions.
But this cruel Barbarian, not being <U+017F>atisfied with her death, but he would al<U+017F>o with
the <U+017F>ame cruel eyes <U+017F>ee her in the Tomb, to glut his cruelty; and finding her revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he never offers to ask a pardon, but would carry her into <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>olate place,
God knows where, and certainly, but for the relief of tho<U+017F>e Shepherds which came
in upon her cry, he had executed his mo<U+017F>t wicked de<U+017F>igne. Judge now, ju<U+017F>t <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantes,</hi>
whether in all this there be the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>hadow of any Love: Con<U+017F>ider, that
if <U+017F>uch a Trea<U+017F>on as this pa<U+017F>s unpuni<U+017F>hed, there is no <U+017F>afety for any Shepherde<U+017F>s to
live in Forre<U+017F>ts; How can we guard our <U+017F>elves again<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch violences? I be<U+017F>eech you
therefore let us dwell <U+017F>afely in our hou<U+017F>es, and quietly in our fields; and make this
man exemplary, by inflicting <U+017F>uch <U+017F>evere puni<U+017F>hments, as may be a terror unto others.
Thus <U+017F>pake <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde,</hi> who after a low congie unto the <hi>Druide</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the A<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>embly,
<U+017F>he fate down in her place. Every one were a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed to hear this tart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>ation,
<hi>Tirintes</hi> only <U+017F>tood un-amazed; for having lo<U+017F>t his hopes of <hi>Silvanire,</hi> he
valued not his life: But making a <U+017F>igne that he de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>peak, and the <hi>Druide</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
him, he an<U+017F>wered thus.</p>
                     <p>This Shepherde<U+017F>s, mo<U+017F>t wi<U+017F>e <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> is in the right, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>ays that I

I never con<U+017F>ented, but am as innocent as her <U+017F>elf: No, no <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde,</hi> I refu<U+017F>e not one
of tho<U+017F>e torments or puni<U+017F>hments which are prepared for me, and which I know are
my due; I will not excu<U+017F>e my <U+017F>elf, for I cannot; and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, that though
I could, I would not: But bitter and malicious Shepherde<U+017F>s, Why <U+017F>hould you add
fal<U+017F>e crimes unto crimes that are true? You had no rea<U+017F>on in the earth for it; for
tho<U+017F>e which I have committed, are <U+017F>ufficient to glut your <U+017F>oul, be it as cruel as it can
be. Oh <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> the affection which I bear unto the fair <hi>Silvanire,</hi> is too
great to make me think of any <U+017F>uch impieties as <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde</hi> fal<U+017F>ly charges me: It is true,
I did give poi<U+017F>on unto the Fair one, but it was becau<U+017F>e I was deceived by the words of
him whom I could not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect to have any <U+017F>uch thoughts. Let the fair <hi>Silvanire</hi> tell
you how <U+017F>he found <hi>Alciron</hi> and me about her, when <U+017F>he awaked, with a Bottle of
Water which we ca<U+017F>t in her face to awake her. All tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Menanders</hi> hou<U+017F>e can
te<U+017F>tifie, that it was <hi>Alciron</hi> who hindred that Faire One from being embalmed, le<U+017F>t it
<U+017F>hould have hurt her: Oh <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> Could I but be declared innocent of this
impo<U+017F>ture, I would willingly confe<U+017F>s all the other crimes which are charged upon me,
I value not the torments of death a ru<U+017F>h, <U+017F>o my love and my fidelity be pre<U+017F>erved
pure and innocent, for them do I extreamly de<U+017F>ire to carry with me unblemi<U+017F>hed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other world.</p>
                     <p>Thus <U+017F>poke <hi>Tirintes,</hi> leaving all the Auditory ravi<U+017F>hed at his re<U+017F>olute alacrity and
pittying his mi<U+017F>-fortune: <hi>Alciron</hi> who could not endure to <U+017F>ee his friend thus at the
<U+017F>take, and him<U+017F>elf the author of the crime: Sage <hi>Druide,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) <hi>Tirintes</hi> is not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53527:169"/>
only cleer and free from any guilt again<U+017F>t <hi>Silvanire,</hi> concerning the gla<U+017F>s which I
gave unto him, but al<U+017F>o from all the con<U+017F>equents of it: for fir<U+017F>t, though the gla<U+017F>s
be broken, yet the pieces are to be <U+017F>een, and ea<U+017F>ily tryed whether the compo<U+017F>ition
be mortal poy<U+017F>on, or only of a <U+017F>tupifying quality. It is compounded of <U+017F>uch ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
as <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde</hi> hath named: here are the pieces, and tryal of them if you plea<U+017F>e
may be made; then he pulled out his handkerchief wherein he lapped them up, when
<hi>Tirintes</hi> in anger again<U+017F>t <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde</hi> broke it. Every one turned away their eyes, le<U+017F>t
they <U+017F>hould be tainted by the virtue of this Stone, and <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> him<U+017F>elf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to put it up; no, no, <U+017F>aid he, I cannot believe that either you or <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rintes</hi>
had any <U+017F>uch abominable intention; becau<U+017F>e it is an act <U+017F>o extreamly horrid,
as it cannot be imagined it <U+017F>hould enter into the thoughts of any in this Country:
but if you have any thing to <U+017F>ay which will quit <hi>Tirintes</hi> of the violence which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
unto this Shepherde<U+017F>s, you may <U+017F>peak it before all this A<U+017F><U+017F>embly. Then <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
offered to <U+017F>peak as to that, when <hi>Tirintes</hi> interrupted him; Peace, peace, friend,
<U+017F>aid he unto him, for I will dye; and happy is he that dyes who cannot live happily.
Yet I thank thee hartily for thy good will, and evidencing that it was not my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to make <hi>Silvanire</hi> dye, who<U+017F>e life I be<U+017F>eech the Gods pre<U+017F>erve to eternity. But
for all this, the affection of <hi>Alciron</hi> made him begin to <U+017F>peak; yet he had no <U+017F>ooner
uttered the fir<U+017F>t word, but <hi>Tirintes</hi> interrupted him again. Oh <U+017F>age <hi>Druide,</hi> <U+017F>aid
he, it is only compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon his friend, and not the truth, which makes him <U+017F>trive
for <U+017F>ome arguments to defend me, for my part, I di<U+017F>avow what he <U+017F>ays, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech
you not to believe him, but to do Ju<U+017F>tice according to the Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cloridamantes</hi> then, after he had impo<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ilence upon <hi>Alciron</hi> and the re<U+017F>t, he
aro<U+017F>e from his <U+017F>eat, and went to gather the voices of the other <U+017F>even <hi>Druides;</hi> for
when the life of any one was in que<U+017F>tion, they were to call that number at the lea<U+017F>t
to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them. The time which he imployed in taking their votes, was very long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
there was <U+017F>ome difference of opinions concerning the judgement. <hi>Tirintes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
re<U+017F>olved to dye, <U+017F>ince he had no hopes to obtain <hi>Silvanire,</hi> all delay was tedious
unto him: <hi>Aglantes</hi> and <hi>Silvanire,</hi> who thought the pain no le<U+017F>s then a death to
be <U+017F>eparated one from the other, they expected the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of their enterpri<U+017F>e with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible

abundance of Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es grieved for poor <hi>Tirintes;</hi> for he was a
very kind and courteous Shepherd, and <U+017F>uch an accident had not hapned of a long

at it: for he received the Sentence of death with a <U+017F>miling and contented coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
and turning towards <hi>Silvanire,</hi> Shepherde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid he unto her, I hope

if your life were in my power, as well as a pardon, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured you <U+017F>hould live many

(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) you <U+017F>hall know ere it be long, that I am as free from any malice
or rancor as you, and that my own life is not <U+017F>o dear unto me as yours: alas, all

and by that means, free him from that puni<U+017F>hment, unto which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                     <p>Upon this all the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly <U+017F>houted, and clapped their hands in <U+017F>ign of joy, and
<U+017F>aid with an univer<U+017F>al voice, Thanks, thanks. Then did all the friends of <hi>Tirintes</hi> run
to imbrace him, and rejoyce with him. Every one commended the good act of
<hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde:</hi> for it was a Law mo<U+017F>t religiou<U+017F>ly ob<U+017F>erved, that if any woman came to
demand a condemned per<U+017F>on for her husband, he <U+017F>hould be delivered unto her.
<hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Lerice,</hi> only looked but half contented, and could not con<U+017F>ent unto
the marriage of <hi>Silvanire;</hi> but <U+017F>eeing the publique joy, and <hi>Aglantes</hi> upon his knees
with <hi>Silvanire,</hi> at their feet, their anger began to cool, and they imbraced both <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glantes</hi>
and <hi>Silvanire</hi> with a joyful countenance, and confirmed the Sentence of the
<hi>Druides.</hi> Then all the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly rejoyced: and <hi>Cloridamantes,</hi> who by the force of
the Laws had condemned <hi>Tirintes,</hi> was very glad of <U+017F>uch an occa<U+017F>ion to deliver him;
and therefore cau<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ome Chaplets of Flowers to be brought; he fir<U+017F>t put two
upon the heads of <hi>Silvanire</hi> and <hi>Aglantes;</hi> and afterwards turning towards <hi>Fo<U+017F><U+017F>inde,</hi>
here Shepherde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid he unto her) take this which I put upon your head, and I
leave the other in your hands; give it unto <hi>Tirintes,</hi> for a te<U+017F>timony that you have

                     <p>The Shepherde<U+017F>s rendred mo<U+017F>t humble thanks for the favour, and <U+017F>aid, I do take
this which you have given to me, and put it upon the head of <hi>Tirintes,</hi> and I do
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53527:170"/>
take his, and put it upon my own, in witne<U+017F>s that we will never be <U+017F>eparated. And
now, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>uch an univer<U+017F>al joy was unexpectedly fallen upon them all, it was
thought fit to go into the Temple, and thank the Gods: And <U+017F>ince the impatience
of the<U+017F>e two Lovers were very great, it was re<U+017F>olved upon, that they <U+017F>hould then be
married, and the re<U+017F>t of the ceremonies be performed afterwards, when they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their homes. But <hi>Sylvander</hi> who could not endure to be among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many
joyful and contented per<U+017F>ons, after he had received many thanks from <hi>Aglantes</hi> and
<hi>Silvanire,</hi> he left the company, and went into the Woods to lament his own mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

know, that if you had known their de<U+017F>igne, you would not have put them to that

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53527:170"/>
I am infinitely a<U+017F>hamed in not being able to requite it. Their complements had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he after they were <U+017F>et) we have a cu<U+017F>tome among<U+017F>t us, that we e<U+017F>teem all
promi<U+017F>es to be due debts: we do hold the obligations as firm, and reckon upon the
payment, as certainly as if it were indented and <U+017F>ealed; and therefore I be<U+017F>eech you,
do not think it <U+017F>trange that I <U+017F>hould in the pre<U+017F>ence of this good company <U+017F>ummon
you to the payment of that debt which you owe unto me; and I conceive that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
your promi<U+017F>e, the time, and the place, and every thing does invite you to it.
Although (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde</hi>) I were not obliged by my promi<U+017F>e, yet <U+017F>hould I be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ready to pay obedience unto any thing you <U+017F>hall either command or de<U+017F>ire; I am
<U+017F>orry for nothing, but that what I <U+017F>hall tell you, will not be worth the time that
will be <U+017F>pent in hearing: Yet <U+017F>ince it is your command, I had rather fail in obeying
you, then in not <U+017F>atisfying your de<U+017F>ires. Then after a while of <U+017F>ilence, <U+017F>he began

                     <head>The Hi<U+017F>tory of DORINDE, of PERIANDER,
of MERINDOR, and of BELLIMARTES.</head>
                     <p>IT is with great rea<U+017F>on that learned Phy<U+017F>icians <U+017F>ay, Interior di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are mo<U+017F>t
dangerous, and difficult to be cured, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ight cannot reach them, they
know by conjectures only what they are: The heart, and the mo<U+017F>t noble parts,
are more ea<U+017F>ily infected, and <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>eized upon, then tho<U+017F>e that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us. The di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the <U+017F>oul, are the <U+017F>ame with the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the body; and
tho<U+017F>e which do proceed from things without us, are much le<U+017F>s dangerous then tho<U+017F>e
which are from within us. I do call tho<U+017F>e things which are without us, Riches, the
favour of others, health, <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, and briefly, all things upon which Fortune has a
Soveraign Authority: And I do call tho<U+017F>e things which are within us, every thing
that does depend upon our own wills, and within the power of our own <U+017F>ouls: For
it is but little hurt that Fortune can do unto one that is re<U+017F>olved, and fully intends to
do what they ought in every thing. But on the contrary, when the Will and the
Under<U+017F>tanding are infected and corrupted, every trifle is a torment, and he mu<U+017F>t
look for a cure from the party from whom his malady proceeds. I <U+017F>peak all the<U+017F>e
things (mo<U+017F>t fair and di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es) by experience, for I have found them
in my <U+017F>elf, and to my co<U+017F>t do know, that a prejudicated under<U+017F>tanding does deceive
the Will, which is blind, and mi<U+017F>led by every thing which it judges good. But oh
God, of all poy<U+017F>ons which does mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ily invenome us, there is none more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
nor wor<U+017F>e to be avoided, then the treachery of men; for, as if they were
our <U+017F>worn mortal enemies, they will attempt any thing in the world to venome our
<U+017F>ouls with their poy<U+017F>on: If we have high <U+017F>pirits, they will fall down upon their
knees, even upon the bare ground, they will honour, reverence, and adore us, they
are our very <U+017F>laves, they will not live but to obey us, and will not change their <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
for an Empire: If they meet with a more inferiour or humble <U+017F>oul, what <U+017F>ervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will they not offer? Into how many <U+017F>hapes will they transform them<U+017F>elves? What
will they not invent to plea<U+017F>e her? How many Balls and Treatments will they give?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53527:171"/>
how will they <U+017F>pruce up them<U+017F>elves in variety of habits? And how careful will they
be to render them<U+017F>elves plea<U+017F>ing in the eyes of tho<U+017F>e whom they have any de<U+017F>igns
upon? And why all this art, care and paines to plea<U+017F>e, but only to win upon tho<U+017F>e
whom they will afterwards deceive, or rather kill with grief and vexation at their
perfidies and trea<U+017F>ons? I am <U+017F>ure, the <U+017F>tory which you de<U+017F>ire to hear, will make
this mo<U+017F>t apparent unto you, which I am the more willing to relate, becau<U+017F>e I may
make others more prudent and wary by my example, and by the knowledg of all
<U+017F>ubtilties and trea<U+017F>ons of men. Be plea<U+017F>ed to know therefore, Madam, and all you
Fair and Di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, that the ancient City of <hi>Lyons</hi> was the place of my
birth, where my Ance<U+017F>tors ever held them<U+017F>elves of the prime Rank: the name of
my Father is <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> and my Mothers <hi>Alcinea;</hi> <U+017F>he left me when I was in
my Nur<U+017F>es arms; but my Father with abundance of care did educate me in all the
accompli<U+017F>hments fit for a woman of my quality, as dancing, <U+017F>inging, <U+017F>everal In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and <U+017F>uch Ornaments; by which he did <U+017F>o imbelli<U+017F>h my youth, that many of
the be<U+017F>t Rank did Court me in the way of marriage: but my Father, who de<U+017F>ired to
marry me very advantageou<U+017F>ly, and <U+017F>aw me yet very young, he waved all motions
that were made, to <U+017F>ee if any better match would offer it <U+017F>elf unto me: I mu<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s,
that <U+017F>omtimes I was angry at it; and at that time blamed the Prudence of my
Father, which I now commend; now I <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>ince I know how mi<U+017F>erable that woman
is who is a <U+017F>ubject unto the <U+017F>ervitude of Tyrants; which are called indeed Husbands
by our Fathers, who are in effect the executioners of mens Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>The fir<U+017F>t that ca<U+017F>t his eyes upon me, or at lea<U+017F>t, whom I took any notice of, was
one called <hi>Theombres,</hi> who <U+017F>ince married <hi>Florice.</hi> I was then of an age <U+017F>o innocent,
as I did believe my <U+017F>elf in no fault if I did believe him. But the clowni<U+017F>h behaviour
of that man (be it <U+017F>poke without offence unto <hi>Florice</hi>) together with my young
years, which had not made me capable, but in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of <U+017F>uch addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and the
<U+017F>hort time he <U+017F>tayed there, did defend me from any wicked de<U+017F>igns he could have
upon me; for whether he had already <U+017F>erved this Fair <hi>Florice,</hi> whom he <U+017F>ince marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or that then he began to love her pre<U+017F>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tly after, I cannot tell; but <U+017F>o it was,
that his addre<U+017F><U+017F>e <U+017F>erved to no other purpo<U+017F>e, but to teach me (if I had made u<U+017F>e of
it) that all men are deceivers; and that the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>tant among<U+017F>t them, is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Camelion,</hi> which changes colour, according to the objects it looks upon.</p>
                     <p>Almo<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>ame time <hi>Periander,</hi> a young and lovely Cavalier, and owner of
many excellent qualities, free from the vices of cu<U+017F>tom, which are in all men, he
would make me believe that he was in Love with me. And becau<U+017F>e his Fathers hou<U+017F>e
was not far di<U+017F>tant from the place where I dwelt, he had all the convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of <U+017F>hewing his good will, that he could de<U+017F>ire. Indeed I was very young,
and knew not at all what it was to Love; yet his con<U+017F>tant addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, the time he <U+017F>pent,
and the flattery of dome<U+017F>tiques, made me believe he wi<U+017F>ht me well; my capacity was
able to reach no farther: and <U+017F>ee how much children are obliged unto their Parents;
and how thankful they ought to be unto Heaven, when they have <U+017F>uch as are Wi<U+017F>e
and Prudent. If <hi>Arci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gentorix</hi> had been too ha<U+017F>ty in marrying me, as many Fathers
are who de<U+017F>ire nothing more then to be rid of their daughters, he had certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>towed
me upon <hi>Periander;</hi> whom now I <U+017F>ee rather then I would have married, I
would with my life have pulled my heart out of my bre<U+017F>t.</p>
                     <p>But my Father out of a Prudent de<U+017F>ign which he had, was the cau<U+017F>e why this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was delayed: many thought it a match very <U+017F>utable and advantagious for me,
as well in re<U+017F>pect of age, as of the noblene<U+017F>s and valour of <hi>Periander,</hi> but e<U+017F>pecial
of his e<U+017F>tate, which is the main thing mo<U+017F>t Fathers con<U+017F>ider. This bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s being
<U+017F>pun out to the length, it hapned pre<U+017F>ently after that one <hi>Hylas,</hi> a Cavalier, or a
Pa<U+017F>tor of the I<U+017F>le of <hi>Carmagues</hi> in the Province of the Roma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, came accidentally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Lyons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is none in the company (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and interrupted) who does not know
him very well. <hi>Dorinde</hi> then <U+017F>miled; <U+017F>ince you know him <U+017F>o very well, replied
<U+017F>he, I <U+017F>hall nor need to relate his tricks which he has put upon me. We do know,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> of his Love unto you: how he put his picture in a gla<U+017F>s, and pre<U+017F>ented
it unto you: and briefly of all his behaviour with you and with <hi>Periander</hi> until his
departure from <hi>Lyons.</hi> I believe (<U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde</hi>) that he has been forward enough
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53527:171"/>
in blazing his Heroick Acts, but I make a que<U+017F>tion whether he was true in his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Do not doubt it Co<U+017F>en (<U+017F>aid <hi>Florice</hi>) for I heard all he <U+017F>aid, and he has not
the gift of lying, as he has of incon<U+017F>tancy. Le<U+017F>t then I <U+017F>hould be tedious, (continued
<hi>Dorinde</hi>) I will wave all di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e concerning him, only will ob<U+017F>erve, that <hi>Hylas</hi> is
the <U+017F>econd per<U+017F>on that deceived me; for <hi>Periander</hi> who was the <U+017F>econd who loved me,
he had not yet compleated his trea<U+017F>on. But I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, that of all tho<U+017F>e
who ever deceived me, I complain lea<U+017F>t of <hi>Hylas,</hi> for he prote<U+017F>ted <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly unto
me, that he would Love me mo<U+017F>t faithfully as long as his humour continued; but if
that were pa<U+017F>t, neither Heaven nor Earth had bonds <U+017F>trong enough to hold him:
<U+017F>o as this free and ingenious confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, keeps me from blaming him; and when I
think upon his change, I do only accu<U+017F>e the general fault of men, among<U+017F>t which I
reckon <hi>Hylas</hi> the lea<U+017F>t deceiver of all. But <U+017F>ince you know all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages betwixt
him, <hi>Periander, Florice,</hi> and my <U+017F>elf, I will return to the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e where I left. I
mu<U+017F>t tell you, that <hi>Theombres</hi> carried <hi>Florice</hi> out of the Town, and how <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi>
that Fair <U+017F>tranger e<U+017F>caped out of King <hi>Gondebauts</hi> pri<U+017F>on, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring my <U+017F>elf Madam,
that he could tell you no farther; <U+017F>ince then he left the banks of <hi>Arar</hi> to follow the
Fair trans-<hi>Alpine, Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> as many <U+017F>ay.</p>
                     <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed to know then, that <hi>Periander</hi> <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf alone with me, having lo<U+017F>t
the Rival whom he always much feared, he did <U+017F>o devote him<U+017F>elf wholly unto me,
at lea<U+017F>t in <U+017F>hew, that his Love was unknown only unto <U+017F>uch as would not know it. As
<U+017F>oon as ever I waked every morning, I was <U+017F>ure of a <U+017F>ervant from him to bid me
good morrow, and to bring either <U+017F>ome flowers, or <U+017F>ome rare fruits of the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on:
I no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>et my foot out of doors towards the Temple, but I found him ready to
tender his <U+017F>ervices unto me: after dinner, no garden or publique rendevous of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
was about the Town, but he carryed me thither: after <U+017F>upper, bals never fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
either at my hou<U+017F>e, or <U+017F>ome of my friends, by his procurement: that night was
very blu<U+017F>tering and <U+017F>tormy, if I had not mu<U+017F>ick at my window, <U+017F>omtimes voices,
<U+017F>omtimes In<U+017F>truments, <U+017F>omtimes one <U+017F>ort, another time another: all his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tiques
wore no other Livery but mine; him<U+017F>elf never wore any favour but what he
begg'd from me. To be brief Madam, all this was not done in a corner, but (as I
may <U+017F>ay) upon the hou<U+017F>e top: he called and profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf my <U+017F>ervant publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s that he did <U+017F>o flatter my young unexperienced youth, as I did
comply with him: and the rather, becau<U+017F>e my Father con<U+017F>idering the merit of this
young Cavalier, and the affection which he expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto me, was minded, contrary
to his de<U+017F>ign, to marry me unto him.</p>
                     <p>About the <U+017F>ame time, there was two Cavaliers who did both ca<U+017F>t their eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me; one was a <U+017F>tranger and called <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> the other was a neighbour about
the banks of <hi>Arar,</hi> and his name was <hi>Merindor:</hi> the fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e came with King
<hi>Gondebaut</hi> from beyond the <hi>Alps,</hi> and was a <hi>Goth;</hi> to <U+017F>hew, that be a man born in any
Region where<U+017F>oever, yet he cannot be exempt from the fault of his <U+017F>ex, I mean from
being giddy, uncon<U+017F>tant, and a deceiver. This <hi>Bellimartes</hi> was he who kept <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi>
pri<U+017F>oner, the <U+017F>ervant, and <U+017F>ince the Husband of the unfortunate, and happy
<hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> for <U+017F>o I prai<U+017F>e the unfortunate and fortunate events, which <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ented
during the time of their Loves: and were not the <U+017F>tory too long, I would relate it,
for I am confident you would be of the <U+017F>ame judgment. You need not take <U+017F>o much
pains (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) for we know it already, partly from <hi>Hylas,</hi> and partly from the
Fair <hi>Florice.</hi> 'Tis very well, <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> for thereby you will better under<U+017F>tand
the <U+017F>equel of my relation.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Bellimartes</hi> then, after he had renounced all his preten<U+017F>ions unto <hi>Arimant,</hi>
as <hi>Florice</hi> I believe has told you, he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf particularly unto the King,
and put him in memory of all his long <U+017F>ervices which he had done, the dangers he
had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, the wounds he had received, and the blood he had lo<U+017F>t, al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hewed
many great <U+017F>cars which he had in <U+017F>everal places: then he be<U+017F>eeched him to con<U+017F>ider,
that for all the<U+017F>e he had got nothing, but the bare honour of <U+017F>pending in his <U+017F>ervice
both his dayes and e<U+017F>tate: that true it was, he held this honour at a high price, and
would not exchange it for any recompence he could give: But though this was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
for <hi>Bellimartes;</hi> yet it was not <U+017F>utable with the grandeur and Maje<U+017F>ty of a
great King; that it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>aid he had <U+017F>o long and <U+017F>o faithfully <U+017F>erved, and <U+017F>erved
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53527:172"/>
a Ma<U+017F>ter and received no other gratification, but the empty <U+017F>ound of being called
his <U+017F>ervant; this would argue that I did not <U+017F>erve a good Ma<U+017F>ter. Unto the<U+017F>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderations,
he added many others, which <U+017F>o moved the heart of that generous King,
as after he had layed the fault upon him<U+017F>elf in never asking any recompence, to <U+017F>hew
<U+017F>ome effects of his good will, he be<U+017F>towed upon him the Regiment of <U+017F>tranger Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
which for the guard of the Town, he entertained in <hi>Lyons:</hi> an office truly <U+017F>o
honourable and <U+017F>o beneficial, as it was a gratification beyond all his hopes, and by
which he did thrive <U+017F>o well, that in a <U+017F>hort time he might without pre<U+017F>umption a<U+017F>pire
unto the be<U+017F>t matches in all the Country.</p>
                     <p>All the<U+017F>e things fell out whil<U+017F>t I was a<U+017F><U+017F>iduou<U+017F>ly courted and <U+017F>erved by <hi>Periander.</hi>
And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Bellimartes</hi> had a mind to <U+017F>ettle him<U+017F>elf in that Province where he had
<U+017F>uch a beneficial office, he intended to match him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o, that he might rather get
friends then money for the portion; upon this ground he ca<U+017F>t his eye upon me, and
at <U+017F>uch a time that I was <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t him, as I could never <U+017F>ince endure the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of him. At the <U+017F>ame time al<U+017F>o <hi>Merindor</hi> being newly returned from travel,
he did unluckily <U+017F>ee me at the marriage of <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> and from that time began
al<U+017F>o to court me: <U+017F>o as <hi>Periander</hi> found him<U+017F>elf more company then he de<U+017F>ired.
'Tis true <hi>Merindor</hi> did carry the matter much better, and with more di<U+017F>cretion then
<hi>Bellimartes,</hi> who pre<U+017F>uming upon the Kings favour, and the authority which he
had in the Town, did at the very fir<U+017F>t acco<U+017F>t me publiquely, as thinking, that though
<hi>Periander</hi> was more in favour with me, yet the advantages of his fortune would
prevail with <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> to make choi<U+017F>e of him before <hi>Periander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This addre<U+017F>s did inflame the affection of <hi>Periander</hi> more then ever, and he expre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
more Love unto me then before; he was <U+017F>o netled to think that another <U+017F>hould
take from him that prey which he had been <U+017F>o long in cha<U+017F>e after, that he thought
time to be<U+017F>tow him<U+017F>elf. So that he re<U+017F>olved, with my con<U+017F>ent, to make the motion
of marriage unto my Father. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s that I did con<U+017F>ent unto it, becau<U+017F>e I
did not like <hi>Bellimartes;</hi> his age and his rough behaviour re<U+017F>embling a man in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
did make me almo<U+017F>t afraid of him. As for <hi>Merindor,</hi> I was not yet acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with him, for he carried the matter with <U+017F>o much cautious di<U+017F>cretion, as it was
hard to know whether he was in earne<U+017F>t or in je<U+017F>t. <hi>Periander</hi> then, to lo<U+017F>e no time,
did motion the marriage unto <hi>Arcingentorix;</hi> and at the fir<U+017F>t overture, <U+017F>ubmitted
him<U+017F>elf wholly unto him, and de<U+017F>ired him to write what conditions he plea<U+017F>ed; my
Father fir<U+017F>t thanked him for his good will; and told him, that truly he had yet no
thoughts of marrying me, <U+017F>ince my age required no great ha<U+017F>te: but yet to make it
appear how much he e<U+017F>teemed of his alliance, he would promi<U+017F>e him within a month
to let him know his full re<U+017F>olution. All the<U+017F>e things could not be tran<U+017F>acted <U+017F>o <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
but <hi>Bellimartes</hi> and <hi>Merindor</hi> were adverti<U+017F>ed, and therefore they both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to cro<U+017F>s this treaty as much po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly they could; but believing that <hi>Arcingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torix</hi>
would not marry me again<U+017F>t my will, they thought the be<U+017F>t way was to gain
me, and therefore they declared them<U+017F>elves more openly then before.</p>
                     <p>I remember that <hi>Merindor</hi> in this re<U+017F>olution meeting me one morning in the
Temple, whither <hi>Periander</hi> conducted me, and went out; he kneeled down clo<U+017F>e by
me, and <U+017F>aid; Did you come hither, Fair <hi>Dorinde,</hi> to pray unto the Gods, or to
thank them? I did not know how to an<U+017F>wer him, becau<U+017F>e I knew not what he
meant; and therefore after I had looked upon him without giving any an<U+017F>wer, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to my prayers again. What means this <U+017F>ilence (<U+017F>aid he again) is it a te<U+017F>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <U+017F>corn? or is it becau<U+017F>e you would be importuned? Neither, <U+017F>aid I unto him,
for I do much e<U+017F>teem <hi>Merindor,</hi> but it is becau<U+017F>e I do not under<U+017F>tand you: for what
do you mean by prayers and thanks? I ask you (<U+017F>aid he) whether you came to
pray the Gods that you may marry <hi>Periander,</hi> or give them thanks, becau<U+017F>e they
have granted that reque<U+017F>t before? Neither the one nor the other, (an<U+017F>wered I, and
<U+017F>miled) you are a di<U+017F><U+017F>embler, <U+017F>aid he, to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o: you are incredulous, an<U+017F>wered I, if
you do not believe me. Why? <U+017F>aid he, can you deny a thing which is known unto
all? Why? an<U+017F>wered I, and turned my head the other way, why doe you ask me
if you know, and if you will not believe me? I do know that which all knows, <U+017F>aid
he, but I do ask you that which you only can tell me: tell me therefore upon what
con<U+017F>ideration do you take this Husband? As a daughter <U+017F>hould take him (an<U+017F>wered I)
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53527:172"/>
who is given her by her Father. I wi<U+017F>h to God (<U+017F>aid he and <U+017F>ighed) that you took
him only out of obedience and not will: my will, an<U+017F>wered I, <U+017F>hall be alwayes the
will of <hi>Arcingentorix:</hi> but pray tell me <hi>Merintor,</hi> what intere<U+017F>t have you in all
this that <U+017F>hould make you <U+017F>igh for it? Well may I <U+017F>igh, (<U+017F>aid he) for that which I <U+017F>hall
never cea<U+017F>e weeping; upon this I <U+017F>aw his eys began to flow with tears: and becau<U+017F>e he
would not as I think, let me know any more at that time, he went away and <U+017F>poke
not a word, leaving me fully a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that he did Love me, and that this marriage
pierced him to the very heart: but all this had no operation upon me, becau<U+017F>e I was
already wholly dedicated unto <hi>Periander,</hi> and thought that his merits and affection
did oblige me unto it.</p>
                     <p>The little account that I made of <hi>Merindors</hi> di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, when he went away,
went <U+017F>o neer his heart, that being almo<U+017F>t out of all hopes of getting my Love, as
long as <hi>Periander</hi> lived, he was in two or three minds to fight him, and <U+017F>ee, upon
which of the two, the lot would fall. As he was deeply in this thought, a friend
of his did meet him, in whom he had great confidence. <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias</hi> (for that was the
name of his dear and wi<U+017F>e friend) <U+017F>eeing <hi>Merindor</hi> walk with his hat pulled over his
eyes, looked upon the ground, and his cloke lapped di<U+017F>orderly about him, walking
in the <U+017F>treets, and never looking upon any; he knew that <U+017F>omthing troubled his mind:
and becau<U+017F>e he knew that youth and courage are often apt unto too violent re<U+017F>oluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which they may repent of when it is too late, he went unto him, and <U+017F>aluted
him: and when he <U+017F>aw that he did not an<U+017F>wer what <hi>Merindor</hi> (<U+017F>aid he and took him
by the arm) will you not <U+017F>peak unto your friends? <hi>Merindor</hi> hearing this voice,
and feeling him<U+017F>elf held by the arm, <U+017F>topped <U+017F>hort, and looked upon <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias</hi> as
if he were newly revived out of an exta<U+017F>ie: and after he had <U+017F>tood a while mute;
Good <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) pardon this fault which proceeds from a very bad humour
which has <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ed upon me. I will (an<U+017F>wered his friend) upon condition you will tell
me the cau<U+017F>e. Though perhaps you would not know it, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Merindor,</hi> yet I
be<U+017F>eech you hear it, for I have need of your coun<U+017F>el in a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which concerns me
as neer as my life: but let us go a<U+017F>ide le<U+017F>t any <U+017F>hould hear us di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. Upon this
making choi<U+017F>e of a private place, he began to tell him the original of his Love, the
progre<U+017F>s, and the pre<U+017F>ent condition wherein he was: afterwards he acquainted him
with the Love of <hi>Bellimartes</hi> and <hi>Periander:</hi> but when he came to the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he
had with me in the Temple, and my an<U+017F>wers in favour of <hi>Periander,</hi> he entred into
<U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that the Prudent <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias</hi> did <U+017F>ee, that the affection which he had
unto me, was too great to be diverted either by rea<U+017F>ons or entreaties: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to avoid the two evils which he fore<U+017F>aw, he thought it mo<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to draw
him only from the mo<U+017F>t dangerous, which was his hatred unto <hi>Periander,</hi> and as for
the cure of his affection, there was no way but to refer it unto time: therefore in
lieu of any <U+017F>harp reprehen<U+017F>ions, or any four looks, he <U+017F>miled upon him, and an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thus; Good <hi>Merindor</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) tell me upon your faith, if this be all the cau<U+017F>e
of your being thus di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>ed? How? (<U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor</hi>) is not this enough, <U+017F>ince
my affection is <U+017F>uch unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that it is a thing mo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to help it?
And do I not <U+017F>ee before my face, the man that is the great ob<U+017F>tructor of my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s?
Is there no way, an<U+017F>wered his friend, to find a remedy? None, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Merindor,</hi> that I know, but to take away the life of him, that takes away from me
that happine<U+017F>s without which I cannot live. Oh <hi>Merindor!</hi> cried out <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias,</hi>
you take things at the wor<U+017F>t. Tell me, I be<U+017F>eech you; do you think <hi>Dorinde</hi> Loves
<hi>Periander?</hi> Think it? <U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor,</hi> nay I were the mo<U+017F>t incredulous fool that
lives if I were not certain of it. Then (replied his Wi<U+017F>e friend) you mu<U+017F>t not go
the wor<U+017F>t way to compa<U+017F><U+017F>e what you de<U+017F>ire: for you can never hope to get the good
will of <hi>Dorinde</hi> by murdering that per<U+017F>on whom <U+017F>he Loves be<U+017F>t; your pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion does
but flatter and deceive you, for by that cour<U+017F>e you will make her hate you even to
the very death. Certainly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor,</hi> there is no remedy, if this be not good:
Certainly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias,</hi> this is neither good, nor a remedy; but I be<U+017F>eech you
tell me, why you think it <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for <hi>Periander</hi> to die? Becau<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) the
Love that <hi>Dorinde</hi> bears unto him, is the cau<U+017F>e why <U+017F>he does not Love me: If that
be it, replied <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias,</hi> make the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on as well ob<U+017F>truct him, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructs
you; I mean, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall not Love <hi>Periander</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he Loves <hi>Merindor.</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:53527:173"/>
Yes, yes, <U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor,</hi> you are very kind; but here is the difficulty, how <U+017F>hould
I make her love me? Do as <hi>Periander</hi> does, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias,</hi> nay, and better;
why <U+017F>hould you think heaven will not be as favourable to you, as any other Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
of your age? But <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) <U+017F>he does love <hi>Periander.</hi> So much the
better, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias,</hi> it is a <U+017F>igne <U+017F>he is not in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, nor invulnerable by the
blows of Love: Pray why <U+017F>hould you think your <U+017F>ervices <U+017F>hould not work as happy
effects as his? You <U+017F>ee <hi>Merindor</hi> that you do love <hi>Dorinde</hi> in <U+017F>uch a height, that you
cannot retire; re<U+017F>olve with your <U+017F>elf to love her <U+017F>till in <U+017F>uch extremity, that it <U+017F>hall
invite her unto Love again, or rather to con<U+017F>train her unto it. Oh my dear friend,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor,</hi> and <U+017F>ighed; how difficult is it to bring this enterprize to pa<U+017F>s! Yet
let me tell you, notwith<U+017F>tanding all I told you before concerning <hi>Periander,</hi> that I do
verily believe <U+017F>he does not love him; but all <U+017F>he does, is only in obedience unto her
Father. So much the better <U+017F>till (<U+017F>aid <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias</hi>) for if <U+017F>he does not love him, you
will far <U+017F>ooner win her, then if <U+017F>he were engaged unto any. Oh but if <U+017F>he do love
<hi>Periander,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor</hi>) what hopes can I have? Why <U+017F>hould not you hope as
well as another, replied <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias?</hi> Will not mo<U+017F>t merit <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t obtain? Or <U+017F>ay
that Argument have no validity in it, you mu<U+017F>t know <hi>Merindor,</hi> that the love of
women is one of tho<U+017F>e things that mu<U+017F>t not be <U+017F>ought after by the Rules of Rea<U+017F>on,
and of whom one mu<U+017F>t never de<U+017F>pair; for be mo<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that there is a certain
hour in the day in the which they can deny nothing; And therefore the an<U+017F>wer of
the Oracle was good, when a Lover asked what he <U+017F>hould do to overcome the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of his Mi<U+017F>tris; The An<U+017F>wer was,
<q>Love, be Bold, and Continue.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>With <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias</hi> diverted his friend from his de<U+017F>igne again<U+017F>t
<hi>Periander,</hi> and filled him <U+017F>o full of new hopes, that he began to court <hi>Dorinde</hi> with
<U+017F>uch fre<U+017F>h a<U+017F><U+017F>aults, as <hi>Periander</hi> and <hi>Bellimartes</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but be jealous; for
until then he did not openly declare him<U+017F>elf, but thought him<U+017F>elf out of hopes, yet
now by rea<U+017F>on of the time of my Father's an<U+017F>wer unto <hi>Periander,</hi> he was the only
mote in his eye; and certainly not without rea<U+017F>on, for I <U+017F>eeing my father very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to give me unto him, I thought my <U+017F>elf already <U+017F>o certain to be his wife, that
I devoted my <U+017F>elf wholly unto him.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e three were thus <U+017F>triving who <U+017F>hould win me, the term which my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>et for <hi>Periander</hi>'s an<U+017F>wer drew on; and he who expected with extream impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the day whereon he <U+017F>hould be pronounced happy, that very evening he failed
not to go unto my Father with three of his neere<U+017F>t kinred; As <U+017F>oon as he came into
his pre<U+017F>ence, he fell down upon his knees, and be<U+017F>eeched him with as much earne<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
as if his life was at <U+017F>take, that he would be plea<U+017F>ed to give him that an<U+017F>wer which
he promi<U+017F>ed. But Sir, <U+017F>aid he, if it be not <U+017F>utable to my de<U+017F>ires, make but a <U+017F>igne,
and it <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffice to be rid of me; for I am mo<U+017F>t perfectly re<U+017F>olved to throw my <U+017F>elf,
and all my de<U+017F>ires and de<U+017F>igns, into the bottom of <hi>Arar.</hi> He accompanied the<U+017F>e
words with <U+017F>uch actions of his hands, head, and every part of his body, that every
one believed they came from his heart: And my Father, as the re<U+017F>t, being deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by this opinion, did hold out his hand to take him up from his knees; Son, <U+017F>aid
he unto him, for <U+017F>o I will hereafter call you, ri<U+017F>e up, and believe, that if I have any
thing which is dearer then <hi>Dorinde,</hi> I will give it unto you and your merit; I do
here give her unto you, and pray unto the heavens to make you a mo<U+017F>t happy pair.
<hi>Periander</hi> ravi<U+017F>hed with joy, did ki<U+017F>s the hand of <hi>Arcingentorix</hi> an hundred times,
with <U+017F>o many demon<U+017F>trations of Love, as none doubted but that his Love was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.</p>
                     <p>At the <U+017F>ame time my Father called for me, and taking my hand, carried me in to
<hi>Periander.</hi> Daughter (<U+017F>aid he) I would have you love this Cavalier, as him that
mu<U+017F>t be your husband, and unto whom I now do give you, and within the<U+017F>e eight
days, I will prepare for your marriage. Upon this <hi>Periander</hi> advanced, and came
to <U+017F>alute me; and I Sir, <U+017F>aid he, do take you for my Lord and Father, and her for
my Wife and Mi<U+017F>tris.</p>

Judge, I be<U+017F>eech you Madam, and you wi<U+017F>e and fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, whether <U+017F>uch
promi<U+017F>es as the<U+017F>e <U+017F>o <U+017F>olemnly made, would not make any one believe them indi<U+017F><U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable?
But with <U+017F>hame to all humane kind, you <U+017F>hall hear the perfidie of all men in
general included in this one particular man. The<U+017F>e eight days which <hi>Arcingentorix</hi>
prefixed for a conclu<U+017F>ion of the marriage, were variou<U+017F>ly imployed: For my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
whole care was in providing all things nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for this marriage: All the
Neighborhood to <U+017F>hew how much they loved and honoured our Family, de<U+017F>igned
<U+017F>everal diver<U+017F>ions of Tilting, Masks, Dancings, and <U+017F>uch like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellimartes</hi> on the contrary was perpetually whi<U+017F>pering into the Kings ear, and
contriving how to break off this marriage. But <hi>Merindor,</hi> what in <U+017F>ighs and tears,
what in care<U+017F><U+017F>ing me and my Father, his time was <U+017F>o <U+017F>pent, that he could hardly
<U+017F>leep: He was continually telling <U+017F>everal tales, and foretelling me of <hi>Periander</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>tancy,
di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, and perfidie, which <U+017F>ince I have found but too true, and
unto which I would not then hearken, thinking it an offence again<U+017F>t the love which
he bore unto me, and which I had unto that Deceiver. As for <hi>Periander,</hi> his whole
care was in care<U+017F><U+017F>ing me, and treating me with all the diver<U+017F>ions about the Town,
and thought upon nothing el<U+017F>e, at lea<U+017F>t in <U+017F>hew. For my part, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I
thought my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o obliged to him, that my <U+017F>tudy was wholly how to plea<U+017F>e him.
Now, <U+017F>age <hi>Druide,</hi> <U+017F>ee how heaven does laugh at all our De<U+017F>igns, and can change
them.</p>
                     <p>During this while, whether it was with too much dancing, or by eating too much
fruit, or rather, as I think, by coming into <U+017F>ome infectious place; or to <U+017F>ay better,
whether it was the will of heaven by this <U+017F>mall <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s to prevent a greater mi<U+017F>ery,
I cannot tell; but upon the <U+017F>ixth day, I was taken with an extream pain in my head,
and a Fever <U+017F>o violent, as put me all into a flame, and continued <U+017F>everal days, and
<U+017F>till with <U+017F>uch a drow<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s upon me, as I could hardly lift up my eyes: and after it
had thus tormented me, one morning when the Phi<U+017F>icians came to <U+017F>ee me, they found
me full of red <U+017F>pots, which by little and little growing bigger, did <U+017F>o become bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters,
that I was a horrid <U+017F>ight to be <U+017F>een: It was a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e which children are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<U+017F>ubject unto; and many other children and young people of my age in the
<U+017F>ame Town were at the <U+017F>ame time infected as I was.</p>
                     <p>This malady thus falling out, it prevented all de<U+017F>igns and preparations; for I was
<U+017F>o exceedingly tormented, that many thought I would die: <hi>Periander</hi> at the fir<U+017F>t
came twice or thrice to <U+017F>ee me, and <U+017F>eemed to be extreamly di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed that our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<U+017F>hould be thus retarded: But as <U+017F>oon as the Smal pox appeared, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
after <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>et his foot into the hou<U+017F>e where I was; he <U+017F>ent indeed <U+017F>omtimes
to <U+017F>ee how I did, but he was <U+017F>o afraid of me, and catching the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, that he would
not <U+017F>o much as come neer the door.</p>
                     <p>As long as pain was upon me, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, I did not re<U+017F>ent his behaviour, though
every one el<U+017F>e did think it very <U+017F>trange; but I was <U+017F>o full of pain, as I never asked
what became of him; yet afterwards, when the violence was a little pa<U+017F>t, I did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what became of <hi>Periander;</hi> and perceiving the little memory he had of me, I
began to think that <hi>Merindor</hi> <U+017F>poke truth when he foretold me of <hi>Periander</hi>'s incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy;
and yet I could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>eek out for <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons to excu<U+017F>e him: <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I did imagine, that perhaps <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s had carryed him out of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and
that it grieved him as much as it did me that he could not hear how I did; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles
I had an opinion, that my Father had changed his mind, and had forbidden
him to <U+017F>ee me: <U+017F>omtimes I thought he was <U+017F>ick, and that none in my hou<U+017F>e would
acquaint me: Briefly, I turned every <U+017F>tone, and tryed all my wits, and all how to
deceive my <U+017F>elf: But my malady continuing long, and this perfidious man al<U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in his neglect, I was but too well a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that his mind was turned.</p>
                     <p>What do you think Madam, and you fair Shepherde<U+017F>s, the re<U+017F>entment of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
might move me unto? At the fir<U+017F>t, I wept and was <U+017F>ilent, and hid my tears
from the <U+017F>ight of every one; But when I heard it the common talk, and that every
one condemned his fal<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to hide my re<U+017F>entments any
longer.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>Merindor,</hi> as if my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s had augmented his affection, he
was continually at my chamber door, asking how I did, and would gladly have <U+017F>een
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53527:174"/>
me, if they would have permitted him. And as <U+017F>oon as ever he heard all danger
was pa<U+017F>t, he brought mu<U+017F>ique of <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts unto my door, to divert me: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
he knew of <hi>Perianders</hi> change, I remember, he cau<U+017F>ed a <U+017F>ong to be <U+017F>ung at
my chamber door, which intimated the incon<U+017F>tancy of a Lover. And becau<U+017F>e he
thought that perhaps I did not under<U+017F>tand the words at that di<U+017F>tance, he <U+017F>ent the
<U+017F>ong in a paper unto me, by a woman that came into my chamber: yet I was <U+017F>o at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
that I heard and remembred every word. I <U+017F>eemed not to take any notice
of all this, though I had a great re<U+017F>entment of it: but when I was alone, the thoughts
of <hi>Perianders</hi> neglect and oblivion, made me even hate his humour: and more,
when being out of my bed, and yet dur<U+017F>t not go out of my chamber, becau<U+017F>e my
face was much changed, as is common in that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; he did not <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>end to
<U+017F>ee how I did: now I thought it time to forget him, as well as he did me; and I
thank Heaven for it, I did <U+017F>o exclude him from my thoughts, that I made him a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<U+017F>tranger unto them: It would be but lo<U+017F>s of time to tell you what reproaches I
laid in his di<U+017F>h; how I re<U+017F>olved my <U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t him; how <U+017F>adly I fir<U+017F>t re<U+017F>ented this
<U+017F>eparation; for the truth is, I had <U+017F>uch confidence in his promi<U+017F>ed affection, that I
thought it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to alter: but now, finding my <U+017F>elf deceived, and my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e to
be the cau<U+017F>e of his apo<U+017F>tacy, I could not complain again<U+017F>t him enough, and indeed
again<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf for believing him: now did I admire his incon<U+017F>tancy, and for his <U+017F>ake
condemn the ficklene<U+017F>s and perfidy of all men what<U+017F>oever.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwith<U+017F>tanding I had <U+017F>worn a hundred times never to care for him again, and
that though he <U+017F>hould return, yet never to look upon him; yet for all this, I could
not chu<U+017F>e but ask him by one that I imployed, what was the cau<U+017F>e of this <U+017F>o <U+017F>udden
<U+017F>eparation? And <U+017F>he who asked him the que<U+017F>tion, was a woman that waited upon
me, and in whom I had great confidence during all the time of his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto
me. <hi>Periander</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) how comes it to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e that you never <U+017F>ee <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde,</hi>
nor ask what becomes of her? How? <hi>Dorinde?</hi> (an<U+017F>wered he) is <U+017F>he alive
<U+017F>till? Alive (<U+017F>aid the woman) why? <U+017F>he is recovered, and ready to come out of her
chamber. Ah Sweet-heart, replied <hi>Periander,</hi> you are much mi<U+017F>taken, or el<U+017F>e does
mock me; certainly <U+017F>he is dead: but has left in her room<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, a certain ugly woman,
whom for the Love of her they call <hi>Dorinde:</hi> but the Fair <hi>Dorinde</hi> whom I Loved is
certainly dead, and I am <U+017F>o <U+017F>orry for it, as I will not go and <U+017F>ee this <hi>Dorinde,</hi> le<U+017F>t the
memory of the other <U+017F>hould give an occa<U+017F>ion of tears. Fie, fie, <hi>Periander,</hi> (replied
the woman much amazed at his an<U+017F>wer) is it not enough to <U+017F>eperate your <U+017F>elf from
her, but you mu<U+017F>t mock at her mi<U+017F>ery? <hi>Dorinde,</hi> as I told you before, replied he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently,
is not in the world: What? would you have me go and Love her in her
grave? And as for her that is in her room; alas Sweet-heart, <U+017F>he is <U+017F>o ugly, that I
will leave her to whom that will. As <U+017F>oon as he had <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, he went away and <U+017F>tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not for any an<U+017F>wer.</p>
                     <p>Judge Madam, whether this was to be endured; and yet I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>wallow this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pill, and <U+017F>eem, as if I did not ta<U+017F>t it. But was it not the height of cruelty, to
<U+017F>trike one that was <U+017F>o deeply wounded before? For fir<U+017F>t my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s had <U+017F>poiled my
face, which was wound enough, without the addition of another from a per<U+017F>on
whom I lea<U+017F>t expected it.</p>
                     <p>A little while after, my Father came to <U+017F>ee me; and not without tears in his eyes
to find me <U+017F>o much changed: which I perceiving, Father, <U+017F>aid I unto him, never
afflict your <U+017F>elf for the lo<U+017F>s of that which could not be long kept: but rather, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech
you to rejoyce with me, <U+017F>ince by the lo<U+017F>s of a trifle I am re<U+017F>cued from an ill
fortune. Upon this I told him all that <hi>Periander</hi> had done and <U+017F>aid, then falling
down upon my knees, I be<U+017F>eeched him, that he would not command me to have any
more conver<U+017F>e with this perfidious man: <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid he and took me up) I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
you I will not; and I command you, not <U+017F>o much as to name him unto me, who
thinks him the mo<U+017F>t unworthy Cavalier that lives.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, my Father went away, and left me extreamly well <U+017F>atisfied with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e.
And from hence forward I began to think more of <hi>Merindor,</hi> then formerly
I had, as thinking that his behaviour towards me did oblige me to prefer him before
any other; for though <hi>Bellimartes</hi> did <U+017F>end often to vi<U+017F>it me, and was very careful
in <U+017F>ending all <U+017F>uch remedies as were proper for that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; yet his humour and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53527:174"/>
was contrary unto mine, <U+017F>o as I could not for my heart Love him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, I recovered very fa<U+017F>t; not but that my face was <U+017F>o bla<U+017F>ted, as I
was hardly knowable; and when I looked in a gla<U+017F>s, I admired to <U+017F>ee my <U+017F>elf: and
therefore I <U+017F>till kept the door of my chamber <U+017F>hut very clo<U+017F>e, to the end none
<U+017F>hould enter but <U+017F>uch as waited upon me; hoping <U+017F>till that time might hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<U+017F>ome amendment. But <hi>Merindor,</hi> who<U+017F>e affection to me <U+017F>eemed to be greater
then before, and who never <U+017F>tirred out of my anti-chamber with <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick,
as I told you before: one day when I was alone with that woman whom I <U+017F>ent
unto <hi>Periander,</hi> and when the door was but ill <U+017F>hut, he entred in upon <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
that he was upon his knees before me ere I could <U+017F>ee him. As fortune was, I
had a mask upon my face: but I could no way hide my eyes but with my hands, and
they were <U+017F>o bla<U+017F>ted, that I was a<U+017F>hamed to <U+017F>hew them, for I had not time to put on
my gloves. You may imagine me not a little <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed when I <U+017F>aw him; I did my
ende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>vour to get into my Clo<U+017F>et, but he kneeled <U+017F>o before me, and held my knees,
that I was not able to ri<U+017F>e from my <U+017F>eat: Oh <hi>Merindor</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto him) you are
exceeding trouble<U+017F>ome unto me, and would do me a great plea<U+017F>ure, if you would
think upon me no more then <hi>Periander</hi> doth. Alas, alas, an<U+017F>wered he, do you think
to limit the effects of my affection unto the <U+017F>hallow amity of him whom you named?
Ah Madam, pardon me I be<U+017F>eech you, if I think his offence not <U+017F>o great unto me, as
it is unto you Unto me? an<U+017F>wered I; I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you <hi>Merindor,</hi> if <hi>Perianders</hi> offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
trouble you no more then me, you will never complain again<U+017F>t him: for as for
my part, I am <U+017F>o far from any memory of his name, that what<U+017F>oever he does cannot
offend me But let us talk of <U+017F>omthing el<U+017F>e I be<U+017F>eech you, and tell me, what makes
you <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee me in this condition wherein I am; for me thinks you <U+017F>hould
rather <U+017F>hun all occa<U+017F>ions of it, then de<U+017F>ire it: upon this que<U+017F>tion I cau<U+017F>ed him to ri<U+017F>e,
and a chair to be <U+017F>et for him, becau<U+017F>e I would not <U+017F>uffer him to kneel. Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
he, the affection of him who loves, will never let him re<U+017F>t till he have <U+017F>atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his curio<U+017F>ity, by <U+017F>eeing her whom he loves and adores; and <U+017F>uch is mine to you:
do not imagine, I be<U+017F>eech you that I do love you with any re<U+017F>erved thoughts to leave
off, though you <U+017F>hould not be <U+017F>o Fair as you was before; <U+017F>uch a love de<U+017F>erves not
the name: and I do e<U+017F>teem rather a trea<U+017F>on, and not to be entertained into any
heart that loves well: my affection <U+017F>ets no other term but eternity, nor no other
condition, but to Love <hi>Dorinde,</hi> as <U+017F>he is, and as <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall be; for the future, as well
as for the pre<U+017F>ent. Now <U+017F>ee, Wi<U+017F>e and Fair <hi>Druide,</hi> how apt one is to judg others
by them<U+017F>elves; a very dog that is burned will fear the fire: yet I, le<U+017F><U+017F>e wi<U+017F>e then
tho<U+017F>e animals, after I had been deluded by the <U+017F>upple language of <hi>Periander,</hi> could
not chu<U+017F>e but give credit<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> unto the gilded flatteries of <hi>Merindor;</hi> thinking, that a
man well born, and a Cavalier, ought above other men to be ju<U+017F>t, and to have his
heart in his tongue: but I confe<U+017F>s, that I did partly believe that which I <U+017F>hould not
have believed at all; I began to fancy that I might live happily with him: but to
tell you truly, I did it much out of <U+017F>pite again<U+017F>t <hi>Periander,</hi> thinking it a full revenge,
if I gave my <U+017F>elf unto another, but never thinking that it was a revenge again<U+017F>t my
<U+017F>elf: but it was imprudence, which commonly is a con<U+017F>equent of little experience,
did give me this <U+017F>imple coun<U+017F>el, which <U+017F>ince hath co<U+017F>t me many a tear, and much
torment.</p>
                     <p>The an<U+017F>wer that I gave him was this; Do you think <hi>Merindor</hi> that any one who
has a de<U+017F>ign to make them<U+017F>elves loved, will <U+017F>ay le<U+017F>s then you? I think (<U+017F>aid he) that
tho<U+017F>e who have the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>ires which I have, may make u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ame words.
But (<U+017F>aid I) if all tho<U+017F>e who have the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>ires, do <U+017F>peak as you do, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
tho<U+017F>e who tru<U+017F>t them, what a<U+017F><U+017F>urance can I have in your words? <hi>Periander</hi>
u<U+017F>ed them a thou<U+017F>and times, and even deafned me with his candid language, which
was only a glo<U+017F><U+017F>e upon intended treachery. If my words (replied <hi>Merindor</hi>) were
not accompanied with <U+017F>ome more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured te<U+017F>timonies, I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e the
treachery of <hi>Periander,</hi> might make you <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect all I <U+017F>ay. But, Oh <hi>Dorinde,</hi> I hope
I am not <U+017F>o unfortunate, but that you have taken notice of my actions, and how,
<U+017F>ince the very fir<U+017F>t day I ever <U+017F>aw you, I have devoted my <U+017F>elf to be wholly yours.
'Tis true, an<U+017F>wered I, and I <U+017F>hould be very ungrateful if I did not acknowledg that
your proceeding and behaviour does much oblige me; but with all let me tell you,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53527:175"/>
That I think all men make it their glory to deceive tho<U+017F>e who put any tru<U+017F>t in them.
If <U+017F>o, replied <hi>Merindor,</hi> then I prote<U+017F>t Madam, that henceforward I will not be a
man, the very name <U+017F>hall be odious unto me, and I will abominate the title, as much
as I do that of Vilain or Traytor. Do you <U+017F>peak this in good earne<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid I unto
him? Madam (an<U+017F>wered he) Do you ask this que<U+017F>tion in good earne<U+017F>t? Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till doubt of <hi>Merindors</hi> affection? No, no <hi>Dorinde,</hi> Do not give
your eyes, your ears, your judgement the lie; I am <U+017F>ure they all tell you that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindor</hi>
loves you: had he been prone to change, he might with more rea<U+017F>on then
<hi>Periander,</hi> who received favours a thou<U+017F>and for one. <hi>Merindor</hi> (<U+017F>aid I) I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s
it, and having ob<U+017F>erved your affection to me ever <U+017F>ince you fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
during all the time of my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, I have often <U+017F>aid unto my <U+017F>elf, what would
he have done if he had found as much good will from me, as I have <U+017F>hewed unto that
Deceiver <hi>Periander?</hi> But this is not enough to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure me that you will not change;
for all men, by the example of one hath taught me, that it is Beauty which they
love, and not the per<U+017F>on of her who has it; <U+017F>o as when by any accident this Beauty
is gone, their love is immediately gone with it. Oh <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) you are an
unju<U+017F>t Judge, to pronounce <U+017F>entence again<U+017F>t all men in general, for the offence of
one particular man: Do you not <U+017F>ee that into what condition <U+017F>oever your <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s
hath brought you, yet <U+017F>till I love, nay even adore you? Perhaps (<U+017F>aid I) you may
love me yet, becau<U+017F>e you have not <U+017F>een my face, and does not think it <U+017F>o deformed
as it is by my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s. But to cure you of your di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, I will let you <U+017F>ee it, upon
condition you will lament my lo<U+017F>s, and afterwards leave me at re<U+017F>t to endure my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
alone: Upon this I pulled off my mask, and <U+017F>hewed him my face, which had
no re<U+017F>emblance of what it was before, more then the name of a Face: This I did
with de<U+017F>ign, that he <U+017F>eeing me, might not love me any longer, and <U+017F>o I <U+017F>hould be
neither troubled nor deceived: then if he did continue loving me, I might be a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that my ugline<U+017F>s would never make him change, it being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible I <U+017F>hould be
wor<U+017F>e then I was. I ob<U+017F>erved that as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw me, he <U+017F>tood mute, and was
much a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, and that tears pre<U+017F>ently after trickled from his eyes, <U+017F>o as he was
not able to <U+017F>peak; but a little after he began thus: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, Madam, that your
di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e u<U+017F>ed you more unkindly then any, unle<U+017F>s they <U+017F>aw you, can imagine; but
this alteration cannot change my affection to you, if you think it does, Madam, you
do wrong me: <hi>Periander</hi>'s action is unpardonable; but be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, I be<U+017F>eech you,
that only death, and not any accident of Fortune what<U+017F>oever, is able to quench
tho<U+017F>e flames which your Vertues and your Merits have kindled in the heart of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindor.</hi>
I do not deny but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which gave me a will to <U+017F>erve you; but <U+017F>ince I have had the honour and happine<U+017F>s to
be better acquainted with you, oh <hi>Dorinde,</hi> I find more la<U+017F>ting invitations and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unto Love, then any Beauty can be: Your Soul, you Soul <hi>Dorinde,</hi> your
noble and <U+017F>weet <U+017F>oul is far fairer then ever was your face; and therefore, as your
face fir<U+017F>t invited me, your <U+017F>oul will eternally keep me to your <U+017F>ervice.</p>
                     <p>I <U+017F>hould be too long, Madam, <U+017F>hould I relate all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which we had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Subject; and it is fit I bury them in <U+017F>ilence, as he did pre<U+017F>ently after in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion;
But <U+017F>o it was, I thought that I had found a man that was not a Deceiver, and
in that belief I contracted amity with him. The way of your behaviour to me (<U+017F>aid
I unto him) ever <U+017F>ince you fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw me, and the a<U+017F><U+017F>urance you give me that my face
does not affright you, nor le<U+017F><U+017F>en your affection to me, does oblige me to e<U+017F>teem
and love you more then I thought I could any, after <U+017F>uch an unworthy fal<U+017F>hood as
that of <hi>Periander;</hi> and if you do continue, as hitherto you have, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf
<hi>Merindor,</hi> that I will love and e<U+017F>teem you as your merits do oblige me. Oh <hi>Dorinde,</hi>
replied he, I am not contented with this promi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince your love is to be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
according to my merits, and therefore I am afraid your love will be but a little.
No, no, <U+017F>aid I, it may be infinite, and yet but hold proportion with your merits; but
to content you, I do promi<U+017F>e, that if you do not Perianderize, I will love you as much
as you can de<U+017F>ire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Merindor</hi> having this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, he fell upon his knees, took my hand by force,
and though it was covered with marks of my di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, yet he ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it <U+017F>everal times
with <U+017F>uch abundance of thanks, as this action gave me more full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of his love,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53527:175"/>
then my words could him of my good will, and I believe, that if my Father had
not come, he would never have cea<U+017F>ed his Demon<U+017F>trations of Affection and
Thanks.</p>
                     <p>My Father at his entrance <U+017F>miled, becau<U+017F>e he either <U+017F>aw him kneeling before me,
or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome of the Dome<U+017F>tiques told him. This invited me to tell him all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
betwixt us, and to <U+017F>peak very advantagiou<U+017F>ly in behalf of <hi>Merindor:</hi> My di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
and my free expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions were <U+017F>o agreeable unto my Father, that taking me
a<U+017F>ide, he asked me whether I did really love that Cavalier, and whether I thought
he loved me; and I an<U+017F>wering, that con<U+017F>idering both <hi>Perianders</hi> behaviour and his,
I did both love him, and that he loved me. Since it is <U+017F>o (<U+017F>aid he unto me) I like
him better then I do <hi>Periander:</hi> Sir, <U+017F>aid I unto him, you may di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of me as you
plea<U+017F>e, for I have no will but yours. We mu<U+017F>t not be too ha<U+017F>ty in any thing (an<U+017F>wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he) nor mu<U+017F>t we <U+017F>light them, <U+017F>ince he has behaved him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o well, let us enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him with a few hand<U+017F>ome delays, and re<U+017F>olve upon the matter at more lei<U+017F>ure:
then turning towards <hi>Merindor,</hi> he looked upon him with a kind a<U+017F>pect, thanked him
for the care he had of me in my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, and commanded me to bid him welcome, and
honour him as I was obliged.</p>
                     <p>Since this day, the door was never <U+017F>hut again<U+017F>t <hi>Merindor;</hi> as <U+017F>oon as I was dre<U+017F>t,
he might enter into my chamber at all times without denial: and he, who let no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<U+017F>lip, was in it from morning till night, with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>hew of affection, that
it <U+017F>eemed my deformity did augment it. On the other <U+017F>ide, <hi>Bellimartes</hi> <U+017F>eeing how
this Cavalier had admittance, and thinking the <U+017F>ame might as well be allowed unto
him, did <U+017F>end to know whether he might come in or no: And my Father, <U+017F>ince <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindor</hi>
was permitted, dur<U+017F>t not deny him; <U+017F>o as one afternoon he came to <U+017F>ee me;
but being adverti<U+017F>ed of his coming, I put on my Mask and my Gloves, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>tation,
not to pull them off as long as he <U+017F>tayed in my chamber.</p>
                     <p>The di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Bellimartes</hi> <U+017F>melt more of a State<U+017F>-man then a Lover; and
though he <U+017F>aw the <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s had much changed me, yet he <U+017F>eemed not to care; but
within a few days after, he made <U+017F>uch addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto King <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> that he <U+017F>olici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my Father to marry me. <hi>Bellimartes</hi> being of another Nation, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
among<U+017F>t us, my Father de<U+017F>ired no alliance with him, but rather with <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
whom he thought to be a man of much merit, and who<U+017F>e e<U+017F>tate and parents
were not unknown; therefore he be<U+017F>eeched the King to pardon him, if he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
unto the marriage, becau<U+017F>e I only was the <U+017F>upport and comfort of his age, and
to marry me unto a <U+017F>tranger, who had no <U+017F>etled e<U+017F>tate in his Dominions, was not
any comfort unto him. He told him, that if I did di<U+017F>-obey him, he would de<U+017F>ire
to puni<U+017F>h me no more, then to marry me unto that man; for I <U+017F>hould be as good as
bani<U+017F>hed from him: Moreover, he <U+017F>aid, that I was at <U+017F>ufficient age to make my own
choice, and he would never contradict my Will, <U+017F>ince it was a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s that made
me either happy or mi<U+017F>erable all my life; and therefore he would not by any means
force my Will: and for a conclu<U+017F>ion, he be<U+017F>eeched the King to remember the
faithful <U+017F>ervices which he and his Ance<U+017F>tors had ever done him; and for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of all, that he would do him the favour not to con<U+017F>train me unto this. The
King, who loved <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and intended to oblige him further by doing this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for him, did an<U+017F>wer unto all tho<U+017F>e objections which my Father urged, and to
every point did give good rea<U+017F>ons to cover that Soveraign power which he intended
to u<U+017F>e in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: And as to that objection, that <hi>Bellimartes</hi> had no e<U+017F>tate in
his Dominions, and that he was a <U+017F>tranger, therefore he <U+017F>hould never <U+017F>ee me again;
he an<U+017F>wered, That he would confer <U+017F>uch an e<U+017F>tate upon him in his Kingdom, as
<U+017F>hould take away that exception; and that <hi>Bellimartes</hi> did intimate as much in his
addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto me, who<U+017F>e Beauty now was not <U+017F>uch as could invite him to marry me
for any matter of Love, but rea<U+017F>on of State, and to get Alliance in a Country where
he was a <U+017F>tranger: That this re<U+017F>olution would make him more tractable unto me,
more obedient towards him, and more <U+017F>erviceable towards all our kinred, then any
other he could mention unto him. That as to the choice and free liberty of my
Will, which he would leave unto me in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, that it was great indi<U+017F>cretion to
do <U+017F>o; becau<U+017F>e youth and wi<U+017F>dom can never be together; and that being <U+017F>o young
as I was, he would commit a great fault, in leaving it to my own choice; which I
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53527:176"/>
could never make but with indi<U+017F>cretion: but on the contrary, that he was obliged
by the very name of a Father to find out a Husband for me, <U+017F>uch a one as might be
advantagious, and not to leave it unto me to chu<U+017F>e at random and without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
That if they ordained Guardians to <U+017F>uch as are within age; <U+017F>o certainly, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
which is to la<U+017F>t for life, mu<U+017F>t be contracted by the approbation and con<U+017F>ent of
Wi<U+017F>e and Prudent per<U+017F>ons, who have the Tuition of any young and unadvi<U+017F>ed child.
That it was generally ob<U+017F>erved, few marriages which were made for Love, prove
pro<U+017F>perous in the end; and almo<U+017F>t all tho<U+017F>e that were made by advi<U+017F>e, the contrary:
and that the authority of Wi<U+017F>e Parents is commonly <U+017F>econded by all <U+017F>orts of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
and felicities. And as to the <U+017F>ervices which he and his Ance<U+017F>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs had done
him, he did make it appear that he had them in memory, by taking <U+017F>o much pains
in marrying me unto one whom he e<U+017F>teemed and loved: that had he not remembred
them, he would have marryed him unto <U+017F>ome other within his Dominions who was
as rich, and as well allyed as I was: but in this action, he thought to acquit him<U+017F>elf
of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervices which he had received from him and his hou<U+017F>e. To be brief, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired
the marriage might be, and if it was not, he had an occa<U+017F>ion to take it unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
upon this he left my Father <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, that he neither could nor dur<U+017F>t an<U+017F>wer
him a word.</p>
                     <p>The authority of a Soveraign Prince, has <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>troke with it in the mind of loyal
<U+017F>ubjects, that it <U+017F>trikes dead what re<U+017F>olutions <U+017F>oever was to the contrary; e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when it comes with a colour of rea<U+017F>on: for mo<U+017F>t certain it is, that <U+017F>ubjects
ought naturally to obey their Prince; di<U+017F>-obedience is again<U+017F>t honour, and again<U+017F>t
great <hi>Tautates:</hi> in all other things, good excu<U+017F>es may be u<U+017F>ed, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by per<U+017F>ons of judgment. But in this, my Father had no will to be<U+017F>tow me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <U+017F>tranger, and had rather have dyed then to <U+017F>ee me in his hands: one while,
he had a mind to tell him that he had already given me unto <hi>Merindor,</hi> but he was
pre<U+017F>ently off that, becau<U+017F>e when the King <U+017F>poke unto him, he did not tell him <U+017F>o then;
other whiles, he re<U+017F>olved to marry us <U+017F>ecretly, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him<U+017F>elf, that when it was
done, <hi>Gondebaut</hi> could not break it: but upon a <U+017F>udden he fore<U+017F>aw <U+017F>o many mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that would befal both him and us, that he altered his opinion; for he knew
the Kings anger would never cool till he was revenged upon us: <U+017F>ometimes his
thoughts prompted him to admit me among<U+017F>t the Ve<U+017F>tals; but when he fancied that,
he <U+017F>aw me <U+017F>o reclus'd and buried before I was dead, he waved that re<U+017F>olution: be<U+017F>ides,
the Kings anger would have been as high again<U+017F>t him for that, as if he had flatly
di<U+017F>-obeyed him. Thus not knowing what cour<U+017F>e to take, he continued many dayes
<U+017F>o unre<U+017F>olved and uncertain, as it troubled him <U+017F>o much, that he moved pity from all
that <U+017F>aw him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Bellimartes</hi> whom the King acquainted with all the difficulties
which my Father objected, he took coun<U+017F>el from a prudent and wi<U+017F>e friend, to gain
me with a golden <U+017F>hower, as the Poets <U+017F>ay <hi>Danae</hi> was by <hi>Jupiter;</hi> I mean, that
though his nature was not over liberal, yet upon this occa<U+017F>ion he <U+017F>hould overcome
him<U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>end rich pre<U+017F>ents unto me and my Father: for it was the cu<U+017F>tom of old
people to be covetous, and it was the nature of young women to be de<U+017F>irous of new
dre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <U+017F>hew them<U+017F>elves brave among<U+017F>t their a<U+017F><U+017F>ociates. Probably the King
was of this opinion; for we were <U+017F>ure that <hi>Bellimartes</hi> was not able of him<U+017F>elf to
be<U+017F>tow <U+017F>uch delicate curio<U+017F>ities as he <U+017F>ent unto me, nor <U+017F>uch great and rich pre<U+017F>ents
as he <U+017F>ent unto my Father every day. Oh how true a <U+017F>aying it is, that <U+017F>tones will
<U+017F>trike the Thunderbolt out of the hand of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and that gifts does <U+017F>teal away the
liberty of them that receive them. After <hi>Bellimartes</hi> had continued this cour<U+017F>e
<U+017F>ome twelve or fifteen dayes, his pre<U+017F>ents had more eloquence in them, and more
authority then the King. There was not a woman about me, nor a <U+017F>ervant about
my Father, but was <U+017F>o gained, that they talked of nothing but of his merit and of
his valour: all others were not worthy to look upon him; and although he was
formerly very il-favoured, tho<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves that were of that judgment, do now
cry him up to the clouds; but that which was the greate<U+017F>t wonder unto me, was to
<U+017F>ee my Father my degrees to approve of that which he <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>proved before:
Daughter (<U+017F>aid he unto me) this man is not <U+017F>uch a Barbarian as we did conceive
him; tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>pend their judgment upon one they know not, are much to blame:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53527:176"/>
for who would not have been deceived, in this man? Who<U+017F>e birth was among<U+017F>t Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians;
who<U+017F>e education was in blood and cruelties, and yet his conver<U+017F>ation and
humour is quite otherwi<U+017F>e then at fir<U+017F>t we thought him. For my part, I think, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<U+017F>erious con<U+017F>ideration, that it were not ami<U+017F>s, to give the King contentment in
this alliance with him: it mu<U+017F>t needs be very advantagious unto us, and he may one
day advance us above all our Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors: again, it is not good to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the will of
him whom Heaven has commanded us to obey; the ruine of him who commits the
crime is impardonable and infallible: for my part, I did re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t him when I thought
the man to be not <U+017F>o good as he is; but now I know him, I find the King has good
rea<U+017F>on to admit him into his favour, I <U+017F>ee my error and my <U+017F>implicity in not
obeying him, and in not acknowledging that happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which he intends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heavens! How little re<U+017F>olution there is in a childs judgment? And how ea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are they <U+017F>wayed by the rea<U+017F>ons of tho<U+017F>e who know how to argue them with art,
they will <U+017F>wallow them like bitter pils which are lapt in hony; I did Love <hi>Merindor,</hi>
and I had no inclination at all unto <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and yet my Fathers di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e turned
me which way he plea<U+017F>ed. Truth is, when I was alone, and remembred <hi>Merindors</hi>
affection, and with what con<U+017F>tancy he continued his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es during all the noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>omne<U+017F>s
of my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s; I could not chu<U+017F>e but pity and be exceedingly <U+017F>orry for him.
As <U+017F>oon as this cour<U+017F>e was re<U+017F>olved upon, my Father commanded me not to <U+017F>ee him
<U+017F>o often as I was accu<U+017F>tomed: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I lamented the lo<U+017F>s of this Cavalier in
whom I found <U+017F>o much affection. But <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> who by his pre<U+017F>ents had blinded
the eyes of my Father, was the cau<U+017F>e of my re<U+017F>olution to obey him who had the
power over me. Yet being moved unto compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, I intended to adverti<U+017F>e <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
to the end he might betimes decline any further court<U+017F>hip or addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to me, and
divert him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome other way.</p>
                     <p>The next morning therefore when he came to <U+017F>ee me, according to his cu<U+017F>tom, as
<U+017F>oon as I heard that he was at my chamber-door, I be<U+017F>eeched my Father, he would
be plea<U+017F>ed to give way that he might enter, that I might acquaint him with our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olutions,

his humble addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, the hopes which was given him, and his merits and quality de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
all manner of contentment. My Father did much commend my de<U+017F>ign, and
to give us the better opportunity of talk; after <hi>Merindor</hi> was entered, my Father
retired to his own chamber, and left me to <U+017F>ay what I would. <hi>Merindor</hi> at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>eeing
this new favour, entred into great hopes, thinking that my Father retired purpo<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in favour of him: but when he was gone, he ob<U+017F>erved <U+017F>uch a hollow kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour

that a harmle<U+017F><U+017F>e liberty would permit: but now <U+017F>ince that hope is quite taken away,

and I have done all we can to prevent it, but find that there is no way to do it but by
death. Since there is that remedy (<U+017F>aid he pre<U+017F>ently) all hopes are not gone, and
without <U+017F>aying any more, or hearing me, he went <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly out of my chamber, as
made it plain he intended <U+017F>ome violent cour<U+017F>e. I called him <U+017F>everal times, and then
run after him as far as the gates, fearing left in that fury he <U+017F>hould do him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome
harm; but all was in vain, for he was gone out of <U+017F>ight upon a <U+017F>udden, as if he had
wings. My Father who was not far off, hearing me <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o loud, he came to me,
and hearing how this young Cavalier was gone, he feared le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould make <U+017F>ome
attempt upon <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and afterwards the King ca<U+017F>t all the blame upon us: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this con<U+017F>ideration, he went unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Bellimartes;</hi> he let him under<U+017F>tand
in as di<U+017F>creet a manner as he could, all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age betwixt <hi>Merindor</hi> and me, that if
any ill hapned we might be di<U+017F>charged of it. <hi>Bellimartes</hi> who was a man of courage,
and had all the authority and power in his own hands, did an<U+017F>wer, that the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e
did not trouble him at all, and that if <hi>Merindor</hi> was extravagant, he knew how to
tame him.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Merindor</hi> tran<U+017F>ported with extream pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, did go unto his
chamber, where <U+017F>hutting the dore, he began to walk a great pace, <U+017F>o much out of
him<U+017F>elf, as he knew not either what he did, or where he was: then after he had
walked <U+017F>everal turns, and thinking none could hear, he began to <U+017F>peak with a loud
voice in this manner: Mu<U+017F>t <hi>Dorinde</hi> be enjoyed by another, and <hi>Merindor</hi> <U+017F>it tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and endure it? Can the authority of a Tyrant prevail above all my <U+017F>ervices, and
mo<U+017F>t unju<U+017F>tly take that from me which is my due? Is there no remedy again<U+017F>t this
wrong, and I with hazard of life and limb not make u<U+017F>e of it? And here making a
<U+017F>udden <U+017F>top, he began to <U+017F>ay, mu<U+017F>t this depriver of my happine<U+017F>s, have it to him<U+017F>elf
at any other rate then the price of my blood and life? No, no, if I live, he mu<U+017F>t dye;
that's po<U+017F>itive: <hi>Dorinde</hi> was in the right, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid there was no remedy but
death. But (<U+017F>aid he, as much enraged as at the fir<U+017F>t) if it be <U+017F>o, why do I <U+017F>tay any
longer? And why do I not put my hand to a work that mu<U+017F>t inevitably be done?
Do it then <hi>Merindor</hi> quickly, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e thou had<U+017F>t rather turn the <U+017F>word again<U+017F>t

                        <hi>Merindor</hi> thought he had been alone in his chamber; and that there was none to

being come a little before to <U+017F>eek him, was <U+017F>aid down upon the bed in expectation of
him, and falling a <U+017F>leep, did not wake till <hi>Merindor</hi> began to talk loud; <U+017F>o as <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in <U+017F>uch a fury, he was de<U+017F>irous to know the cau<U+017F>t, and let him empty his
heart by the words which he uttered: knowing very well, that to <U+017F>top the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing

and execute what he had <U+017F>poken, he <U+017F>tarted up, and took hold of his arm, de<U+017F>iring
him to hear him <U+017F>peak: <hi>Merindor,</hi> not knowing whether it was a man or a <U+017F>pirit, he
was <U+017F>truck with <U+017F>uch a fright, that his fury was a little cooled; but recollecting his

which you were going to execute without imparting it unto me. Do you
think I know not how the King intends to marry <hi>Dorinde</hi> unto <hi>Bellimartes?</hi> And
that her Father con<U+017F>ents unto it? Why man, it is all the Town talk, and I came hither
to acquaint you, if you were not acquainted with it before, to the end you might
re<U+017F>olve with your <U+017F>elf, not only unto the Kings will, but al<U+017F>o unto the will of God,
again<U+017F>t which there is no re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance: for <hi>Merindor,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t know that marriages
are made in Heaven, and accompli<U+017F>hed upon earth. How, how? <U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:53527:177"/>
ha<U+017F>tily, do you <U+017F>ay that marriages are made in Heaven? There is no doubt on it,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias,</hi> and thereupon it is, that <U+017F>o many unexpected marriages come
to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, if it be <U+017F>o (<U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor</hi>) it may be <U+017F>aid, that as bad a
market may be made in Heaven as in Earth; but from this, I do not conclude that
<hi>Bellimartes</hi> mu<U+017F>t enjoy <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and <hi>Merindor</hi> live; It mu<U+017F>t be concluded, replied
<hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias,</hi> that what<U+017F>oever the Heavens will ordain for you, mu<U+017F>t be done: but
tell me <hi>Merindor,</hi> what is your de<U+017F>ign? To take away his life (an<U+017F>wered he) that
takes away all my contentment. But (<U+017F>aid <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias</hi>) What will that advantage
you? Oh (<U+017F>aid the young Cavalier) revenge is <U+017F>weet. Revenge, replied the Wi<U+017F>e
friend, is indeed very <U+017F>weet, when it does not make the offence greater; but if you
<U+017F>hould kill <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> the lea<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hment you can expect, is bani<U+017F>hment from all
places where <hi>Gondebaut</hi> has any power; and if <U+017F>o, what will become of your Love
unto <hi>Dorinde?</hi> Will not then this revenge make your offence which you receive,
greater? I do not hold him wi<U+017F>e, who to put one of his enemies eyes out, will put
out both his own. What then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Merindor,</hi> mu<U+017F>t I <U+017F>it down tamely without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entment,

not <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Euphro<U+017F>ias,</hi> but on the contrary; but if you will be ruled by
me, I hope, we <U+017F>hall obtain for you, this <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ired <hi>Dorinde.</hi> Do you think
that the King is <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate in behalf of <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> as that he would do you any
harm? No, no, it is only to gratifie <hi>Bellimartes</hi> in a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s wherein he does not
think any has any intere<U+017F>t but <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> and of him the King makes no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
though he be one of the chief in all the Country, becau<U+017F>e he is old and not
able to <U+017F>erve him, and on the contrary, <hi>Bellimartes</hi> is young, and may: for you mu<U+017F>t
know, that mo<U+017F>t Princes do with their Subjects, as we do with our hor<U+017F>es, when they

would do any good, or that the King being engaged by his word, would be taken
off it; but his drift only was, to cool a little that angry heat which was kindled in the
<U+017F>oul of <hi>Merindor;</hi> hoping, that if the fir<U+017F>t impetuo<U+017F>ity were but a little allayed, he
might the more ea<U+017F>ily afterwards per<U+017F>wade him to rea<U+017F>on. And indeed, it came <U+017F>o

among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, to imploy tho<U+017F>e about the King, whom they thought had

as wrought much upon the young mans apprehen<U+017F>ions; and he promi<U+017F>ed
unto him <U+017F>everal a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances of great prevalency, though all was only to divert him:
for he knew that the be<U+017F>t way to per<U+017F>wade, is to infu<U+017F>e great hopes of that which is

                     <p>But Madam, I be<U+017F>eech you hear how Heaven is plea<U+017F>ed to play with men, and

yet none of my kindred were of that opinion, e<U+017F>pecially my Father, who told him
freely, that he had <U+017F>uch a belief in what the woman <U+017F>aid, as he would never con<U+017F>ent
his daughter <U+017F>hould marry him, till this impo<U+017F>ture was cleered. <hi>Bellimartes</hi> who
was naturally of a proud imperious temper, and thought him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>upported by the
Kings favour; let me tell you <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, that I care neither for you nor
your daughter, and that I do find my <U+017F>elf much mi<U+017F>taken in the alliance which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make with you. My Father, who was generous, and though age hung
heavy upon him, yet could re<U+017F>ent the honour of him<U+017F>elf and his Ance<U+017F>tors, <hi>Bellimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
<U+017F>aid he unto him, I had rather you <U+017F>hould deceive your <U+017F>elf then me; and let
me tell you, that I value you far le<U+017F>s then you can do my daughter or me. As God
would have it, <hi>Bellimartes</hi> never heard the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words, for he was gone all in a rage,
and left all the company in a <U+017F>trange confu<U+017F>ion. But for his part, he was in the
greate<U+017F>t confu<U+017F>ion of all; becau<U+017F>e his con<U+017F>cience, which is a thou<U+017F>and witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, did
convince him of that unworthy act which he would have done. This hour, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
was the happie<U+017F>t of all my life: for certainly if this Lady had <U+017F>tayed but this
hour longer then <U+017F>he did, I had been married unto him: and mo<U+017F>t certain it is, this
perfidious wretch had a wife, and as we are informed <U+017F>ince, had quitted her, becau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>he was not rich enough: But <U+017F>ee here, what the faith of men is? And how mi<U+017F>era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that woman is who tru<U+017F>ts them; for this <hi>Alderina</hi> had been long courted by him,
and with <U+017F>o many pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of affection, as it is hardly credible he <U+017F>hould
for<U+017F>ake her: yet avarice did <U+017F>ince mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>hamefully overcome his Love. But <U+017F>o it
was Madam, that for this time, I was almo<U+017F>t miraculou<U+017F>ly delivered from a mi<U+017F>-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
for <hi>Alderina,</hi> having made her addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to the King, and convinced <hi>Bellimar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
who though he denied all, yet he was ordained to take her for his Lawful wife;
and charged upon <U+017F>evere penalty, to marry no other, as long as <U+017F>he lived: many did
wonder that <hi>Alderina</hi> being very fair and hand<U+017F>om, <hi>Bellimartes</hi> <U+017F>hould leave her
for me, who<U+017F>e face was enough to affright him: and when an<U+017F>wer was made that he
did it out of covetou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, it was hard to be believed, becau<U+017F>e of the many rich
pre<U+017F>ents which he <U+017F>ent unto us, and which <U+017F>ince we <U+017F>ent back: but they did not
con<U+017F>ider that tho<U+017F>e gifts, which made him thought liberal, they were not given, but
only lent, which he knew well enough would return back if he married me, <U+017F>ince
then all we had was his: <U+017F>o as this <U+017F>o much e<U+017F>teemed liberality, was mo<U+017F>t certainly a
ba<U+017F>e and unworthy <U+017F>elf ended avarice. <hi>Merindor</hi> who was going upon his la<U+017F>t, and
was fully re<U+017F>olved that when all hope was pa<U+017F>t, to kill him<U+017F>elf, but yet to <U+017F>end <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes</hi>
out of the world before him, he was not the la<U+017F>t man that was adverti<U+017F>ed of
this accident; and as if a new life had been given unto him, he leaped up, clapping
his hands together, and ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing the Fates for this happy fortune: then leaving his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53527:178"/>
chamber, he made all the ha<U+017F>te that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could unto mine, where he expre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
him<U+017F>elf the mo<U+017F>t joyful man alive, and asked an hundred merry que<U+017F>tions: He
asked me how I did after my marriage? and whether it was good to be two wives to
one Husband; and becau<U+017F>e I knew not well whether I <U+017F>hould laugh or cry, I <U+017F>aid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, well, well <hi>Merindor,</hi> do not mock at me, perhaps when you are married,
you may al<U+017F>o find a wife that has two husbands. If I have (<U+017F>aid he) the <U+017F>tronger will
drive the other out of the hou<U+017F>e; but I fear not any <U+017F>uch accident will ever befal me,
unle<U+017F>s it be by you. By me? an<U+017F>wered I, Nay, <hi>Merindor,</hi> the re<U+017F>olution which I
have, will free you from that fear; for within the<U+017F>e few days, if my Father will give
me leave, I will become of tho<U+017F>e that are to keep in the Sacred Fire. How, how?
replied he, will you become a Ve<U+017F>tal? Yes certainly (<U+017F>aid I) purpo<U+017F>ely to be rid of men,

                        </gap>fidie. You do wrong me (<U+017F>aid he)
not to put me out of the general number, <U+017F>ince I am <U+017F>ure you never <U+017F>aw any action,
or heard any language from me, which was derogatory from my vowed affection, or
which in any rea<U+017F>on could induce you to put me into that rank: One indeed, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, does make no number; but what do you <U+017F>ay of <hi>Theombres,</hi> of <hi>Hylas,</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander,</hi>
and of <hi>Bellimartes?</hi> I <U+017F>ay (an<U+017F>wered he) that they de<U+017F>erve not only to be
razed out of the rank of men, but al<U+017F>o out of the number of the living: But I <U+017F>ay,
that all men ought not to be blamed for them, and of all men, e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Merindor.</hi>
Oh Madam, give me leave to tell you, it is mo<U+017F>t extream inju<U+017F>tice to puni<U+017F>h a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of innocents for a few culpable; and <U+017F>ince faults are per<U+017F>onal, every per<U+017F>on ought
to bear the burthen of his own puni<U+017F>hment. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s <hi>Merindor,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto
him, that you are in the right, but I am not to be blamed; for having found <U+017F>o
much fal<U+017F>hood and perfidie in all tho<U+017F>e that ever made any addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto me, I had
good rea<U+017F>on to fear the <U+017F>ame from all others. This <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) is a <U+017F>econd
wrong, not inferiour to the fir<U+017F>t; for you rank me in the number of tho<U+017F>e who have
deceived you, <U+017F>ince you cannot exclude me from the number of tho<U+017F>e who have
made addre<U+017F><U+017F>es unto you. Hitherto (replied I,) I cannot <U+017F>ay I have been deceived
by you; but I cannot tell what you may do upon occa<U+017F>ion.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t we were talking thus, my Father came into the chamber, <U+017F>till much moved
at the former accident; and <U+017F>eeing this young Cavalier with me, Come <hi>Merindor</hi>
(<U+017F>aid he unto him) are you not much offended again<U+017F>t my Daughter and me, for the
fault which the Kings power cau<U+017F>ed us to commit? Sir (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Merindor</hi>) I am
more your <U+017F>ervant, then to be offended at you; but on the contrary, I thank the
Gods for making the vilany of that wicked man known unto you; though let me tell
you, that if his vilany had been executed, the Vilain <U+017F>hould not have lived an hour
after; for I <U+017F>wear by the great God <hi>Ife<U+017F>us,</hi> this <U+017F>word <U+017F>hould have wa<U+017F>hed away
his crime with his own blood, for not one <U+017F>ingle drop <U+017F>hould have remained: But
Sir, thanks be to God that there is no need of <U+017F>uch extremities; and remember I
be<U+017F>eech you for the future, that our old Fathers had good rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>ay, That no
man ought to rub an herd which he knows not: And Sir, there are many in this
Province who<U+017F>e Ance<U+017F>tors and E<U+017F>tates are known unto you; and who would think
them<U+017F>elves honoured and happy in your Alliance: And if heaven would make me <U+017F>o
happy as to obtain that favour, what <U+017F>ervices (<U+017F>aid he, and kneeled down) would I
not pay unto you all my life, and what love, what duty and affection <U+017F>hould not
<hi>Dorinde</hi> receive from me? <hi>Dorinde</hi> I <U+017F>ay, whom you know I ever loved and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
what accidents <U+017F>oever hapned. The good old man who knew how affectionate
he alwaies appeared, even all the time of my <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>till continue his
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, he did believe him. But, oh Heavens! who might not as
well have been deceived as he? <hi>Merindor</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto him) <U+017F>peak freely and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niou<U+017F>ly,
as you are a Cavalier; Are you real, or is it only out of your civility and
court<U+017F>hip that you u<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions? Sir, an<U+017F>wered he, I cannot commit an act
<U+017F>o unworthy of the name I bear, as to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble or deceive; and therefore I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t
and <U+017F>wear, that all the words which I have <U+017F>poke, do proceed from the real
thoughts of my heart, with all <U+017F>incerity and true meaning, el<U+017F>e may <hi>Bellinus</hi> root
me and my name out from the number of men. If <U+017F>o, replied <hi>Arcingentorix,</hi> and
that it prove <U+017F>o that <hi>Bellimartes</hi> has another wife, and that your mother do con<U+017F>ent
unto your de<U+017F>ires, I do promi<U+017F>e you <hi>Dorinde</hi> for your wife, and I do call the Gods to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53527:179"/>
be a witne<U+017F>s unto the promi<U+017F>e which now I make unto you. And I (added <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>)
do call all the Gods to witne<U+017F>s, that I do receive this promi<U+017F>e as the greate<U+017F>t
happine<U+017F>s I can de<U+017F>ire: for hence forward, I do devote my <U+017F>elf unto you Sir, as my
Lord and Father; and unto <hi>Dorinde</hi> as my Lady and Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and I do vow and
<U+017F>wear unto you both, an affection without end, and perpetual obedience. Who
would have thought, that heard the<U+017F>e <U+017F>olemn prote<U+017F>tations expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed which <U+017F>o much

they did proceed from his heart, but it was from the mo<U+017F>t wicked, vile, perfidious
heart, that ever was in any traiterous and perjured man: certainly it is enough to
expre<U+017F><U+017F>e him, to <U+017F>ay that he is a man without any addition of traiterous, or perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or perjured; for I do believe all others that bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from us in appearance full of contentment, as full as man could be, and went unto
the Palace to hear more certain news of <hi>Alderina</hi> and of her marriage: at night he
returned again, and told us that the King having <U+017F>een the atte<U+017F>tations of the <hi>Druids</hi>
and Nobles of <hi>Gergovia,</hi> was highly offended again<U+017F>t <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to depart his Dominions, and never to come into his pre<U+017F>ence again;
yet <U+017F>ome Grandees about <hi>Gondebaut,</hi> were in hope to obtain, his Pardon, when the
King his choller was a little over: and <U+017F>o it hapned; for a while after, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
by the mediation of <hi>Alderina</hi> her <U+017F>elf; who fell down at the feet of <hi>Gonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut,</hi>
who pardoned her Husbands fault, upon condition he would live with her as
he ought:</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e things hapned, it <U+017F>eems the Gods were plea<U+017F>ed to mock <hi>Periander,</hi>
for the <U+017F>pring coming on, and <U+017F>ome remedies which a Phi<U+017F>itian gave me, did <U+017F>o re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tore

                     <p>I cannot expre<U+017F>s the joy and contentment of <hi>Merindor,</hi> when from day to day, he
<U+017F>aw my complexion return: and not being able (as he <U+017F>aid) to endure any longer
delay in our marriage, he entreated my Father to give him con<U+017F>ent that he might
go unto his Mother for hers, there being nothing el<U+017F>e which could hinder it. Oh
Heavens what new prote<U+017F>tations did he make to my Father and me when he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I have wondred <U+017F>ince a hundred times, that the earth did not open and <U+017F>wallow
him alive.</p>
                     <p>I <U+017F>hould but trouble you, Madam, did I relate the whole <U+017F>eries of his actions:
but <U+017F>o it was, that going away, he lo<U+017F>t all memory of me, and all his oaths: about

(to omit the re<U+017F>t) that ever were committed again<U+017F>t any woman. The<U+017F>e
that I have told you, are enough to make any that have eyes or their wits, never to
tru<U+017F>t any that has either the name or the figure of a man: but hear what torments
they cau<U+017F>ed me to endure; and then I am confident you will confe<U+017F>s that the hatred
which I bear unto this animal, man, is grounded upon mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dorinde</hi> would have continued, had not the noi<U+017F>e of men on hor<U+017F>e-back, di<U+017F>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
them: the<U+017F>e Fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es being unaccu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch a<U+017F><U+017F>emblies in
their Villages, they all ran out of curio<U+017F>ity to the door: <hi>Dorinde</hi> and the other
<U+017F>trangers did the <U+017F>ame; then they <U+017F>aw pa<U+017F><U+017F>e along the way, which joyned almo<U+017F>t
clo<U+017F>e to the door of this Cabin, fifteen or <U+017F>ixteen per<U+017F>ons very well mounted, and
armed, alter the <hi>Burgundian</hi> fa<U+017F>hion, having head-pieces upon their heads, Suits of
Arms for back and bre<U+017F>t, a Javelin in their right hands, and a Buckler on their left
arm. The<U+017F>e men marched in order, and in the head of them was him who condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them, as might be imagined, both by the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of his Hor<U+017F>e, which was
much fairer then the re<U+017F>t, and by the richne<U+017F>s of his Armor, which was almo<U+017F>t all
gilt, and a Plume in his Head-piece, which made him remarkable above the re<U+017F>t.
This Troop marched very fa<U+017F>t, and their Armor and Hor<U+017F>es <U+017F>eet made a great noi<U+017F>e:
as for the men they talked not loud, though they did hold <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e which
could not any di<U+017F>tance be under<U+017F>tood. When they came neer unto this Cabin, they
ca<U+017F>t their eyes upon the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, which out of curio<U+017F>ity were come to the
door, and <U+017F>eeing them <U+017F>o Fair, they <U+017F>tayed a little, almo<U+017F>t ravi<U+017F>hed to <U+017F>ee <U+017F>uch Fair
Faces in <U+017F>uch rural Cottages. Oh Heavens, cryed he that commanded them, is not
yonder <hi>Dorinde?</hi> She, hearing her <U+017F>elf named, and looking him in the face, <U+017F>he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently
remembred that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een him very often with King <hi>Gondebaut:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fearing <U+017F>ome violence, <U+017F>he retired into the Cabin, to try if <U+017F>he could hide her
<U+017F>elf: but he, being more a<U+017F><U+017F>ured by this action that it was <U+017F>he, did pre<U+017F>ently alight,
and five or <U+017F>ix of his companions with him: and entring very blu<U+017F>teringly among<U+017F>t
the<U+017F>e women, they came to the place where <hi>Dorinde</hi> was retired; who trembling
for fear, and hiding her face with her hands, <U+017F>he looked as pale as death. <hi>Celadon</hi>
in the dre<U+017F><U+017F>e of <hi>Druide,</hi> wi<U+017F>hed now that he had Arms, to repul<U+017F>e the injury which
the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers <U+017F>eemed to offer unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and not being able to endure any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53527:180"/>
<U+017F>hould be done unto her in his pre<U+017F>ence, he fir<U+017F>t u<U+017F>ed entreaties and fair lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
and <U+017F>eeing them <U+017F>lighted, and offers made to carry away that trembling
woman out of the Cabin, he could not chu<U+017F>e but joyn hands unto his language, and
beyond the <U+017F>trength of a woman, like man, re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t this violence. The Captain and the
Souldiers would quickly have di<U+017F>patched him, had they believed him to be a man,
but thinking him to be a woman <hi>Druide,</hi> their re<U+017F>pect unto that <U+017F>ex, and the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
they bore unto her habit, made them take it into their con<U+017F>ideration. All the
re<U+017F>t of the women, <U+017F>eeing this attempt of the <hi>Druide,</hi> after her example, did their
endeavours to <U+017F>ave <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and perhaps this feeble defence, had held them long in
play, had not the Captain being grown into choller, made a <U+017F>ign unto the Souldiers,
that without any con<U+017F>ideration of the<U+017F>e women, they <U+017F>hould u<U+017F>e force, and carry
her away. As <hi>Celadon</hi> was holding the arms of this man <U+017F>o as he could not <U+017F>tir, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea</hi>
and <hi>Diana</hi> were on both <U+017F>ides of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and held her by the arms; but the
Souldiers who had received the <U+017F>ign from their Commander, pu<U+017F>hing them both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
roughly away, they con<U+017F>trained the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es to let their hold go, and
with <U+017F>uch violence that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> fell to the ground. Who crying out, and the <hi>Druide</hi>
turning about her head, <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>o unworthily u<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>he grew as furious as any
raging <hi>Lyon,</hi> and letting him go whom <U+017F>he held, and ran upon him who did the
affront with <U+017F>uch violence, and gave him <U+017F>uch a blow upon the face, as <U+017F>he con<U+017F>trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him to let <hi>Dorinde</hi> go, who was already pulled out of the door, and after he
had reeled two or three paces, he fell among<U+017F>t the hor<U+017F>es feet, which trampled him
<U+017F>o, as he was not able to do more harm unto this fair company: the Captain in the
mean time being out of the <hi>Druids</hi> hands, and <U+017F>eeing they had carried <hi>Dorinde</hi> out
of the place, he went out al<U+017F>o, to <U+017F>ee her carried away according to his de<U+017F>ign:
but when he was out, he <U+017F>aw his companions on foot, and running after her in the
fields: for fear made her <U+017F>o <U+017F>wift, as <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed to have wings at her heels. At the
fir<U+017F>t, he laughed, for he confidently believed <U+017F>he would be taken again. But whil<U+017F>t
he was looking and laughing at this cha<U+017F>e, for <U+017F>o may the flight of <hi>Dorinde</hi> be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
they <U+017F>aw appear <U+017F>ix Cavaliers, who being very well mounted and armed, came
riding the <U+017F>ame way. At the fir<U+017F>t, they rid in file, as Travellers u<U+017F>e in a Journey;
but when they <U+017F>aw <U+017F>o many men running after one woman, they drew up together,
and galloped to oppo<U+017F>e the violence which they thought would be done unto her.
Yet they could not come in <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, but <hi>Dorinde</hi> was fir<U+017F>t taken; and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he
had no other defence, they <U+017F>aw her fall down upon her knees, hold up her hands,
and make lamentable prayers and <U+017F>upplications to them. The Souldiers, on the
other <U+017F>ide, without any compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, took her, and would have carried her away:
when the<U+017F>e Cavaliers came up unto them, they out of pity, though they knew not
<hi>Dorinde,</hi> oppo<U+017F>ed this violence; but one of them upon a <U+017F>udden ca<U+017F>ting his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, did know her: Oh ye crew of villains (<U+017F>aid he unto the Souldiers) and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to bear arms, <U+017F>ince you imploy them <U+017F>o ill; cea<U+017F>e wronging her whom ye
all ought to honour and <U+017F>erve, or el<U+017F>e by Heaven (<U+017F>aid he, and drew his <U+017F>word) I
will cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e you according to your merits. Sir, (an<U+017F>wered one of them) King <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debaut</hi>
commanded us to do what we have done, and none ought or can oppo<U+017F>e his
will. Upon this, not caring for the menace of the Cavalier, and <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o <U+017F>len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
accompanied, al<U+017F>o his Captain and company coming to his relief, he
continued on his way: at which the Cavalier was <U+017F>o incen<U+017F>ed, that he gave him <U+017F>uch
a blow upon the <U+017F>houlder, that for all his Coat of Male, it gave him a deep wound,
and being a little di<U+017F>tant from <hi>Dorinde,</hi> he rid upon him with his hor<U+017F>e, and trod
him to the ground. In the mean time, the re<U+017F>t of the Cavaliers advanced again<U+017F>t the
Captain, and his Souldiers, who without any expo<U+017F>tulations, did a<U+017F><U+017F>ault them very
furiou<U+017F>ly. The Cavaliers being better armed, and better mounted, and having more
courage, though they were interior in number, yet gave them <U+017F>uch a hot <U+017F>alute that
the combat did not la<U+017F>t above a quarter of an hour: for the Captain being killed, the
re<U+017F>t were quickly routed, and fled <U+017F>ome one way, and <U+017F>ome another, as fa<U+017F>t as ever their
hor<U+017F>es could carry them. This victory was the <U+017F>ooner gotten, by rea<U+017F>on that mo<U+017F>t
of one party was on foot, and were running after their hor<U+017F>es, which were broken
loo<U+017F>e in the fields. But of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ix Cavaliers, two of them were killed, and one <U+017F>o
wounded that he could hardly <U+017F>it his hor<U+017F>e.</p>

                        <hi>Dorinde</hi> <U+017F>eeing this unlook'd for relief, although <U+017F>he thought <U+017F>he knew the voice
of him who <U+017F>poke, yet not being <U+017F>ure, becau<U+017F>e his head-piece covered his face, <U+017F>he
retired as fa<U+017F>t as <U+017F>he could in a trembling and panting pace unto her companions,
though not <U+017F>o much affrighted as when <U+017F>he was fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>eized upon: But when <U+017F>he was
told of the end of the combate, for <U+017F>he was gotten into the cabbin, and that one of
the Cavaliers who defended her was much wounded, <U+017F>he went out of the cabin with
watry eyes and cheeks to receive him and help him all that po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly <U+017F>he could: And
becau<U+017F>e his three companions took off his helmet to give him Ayr, as <U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t
her eye upon him, <U+017F>he knew him to be <hi>Bellimartes;</hi> at which <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urprized,
that <U+017F>he knew not whether <U+017F>he dream'd or waked: But whil<U+017F>t the three Cavaliers
were laying him upon the Bed, and one of them <U+017F>tayed with him, the other two pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
off their helmets, and kneeled down before her, <U+017F>hewing all <U+017F>igns of humble
obedience; <U+017F>he all the while was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urprized at the <U+017F>ight of them, that <U+017F>he could
not utter a word; for the one was <hi>Merindor,</hi> and the other <hi>Periander.</hi> Oh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
(cryed <U+017F>he out at the la<U+017F>t, when <U+017F>he could <U+017F>peak) Oh heavens! Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
I <U+017F>hould be thus much obliged unto three men, who have made me hate all men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for their <U+017F>akes? <hi>Merindor</hi> then began fir<U+017F>t to <U+017F>peak: Oh <hi>Dorinde</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto
her) do not by your disfavours le<U+017F><U+017F>en that contentment which heaven has given us,
in rendring you a te<U+017F>timony that we do love you more then you would be loved by
us. After this, <hi>Periander</hi> continued, Heaven (fair <hi>Dorinde</hi>) has made choice of us,
to render you this little <U+017F>ervice; and believe, that the choice could not be made of
any others, who have vowed <U+017F>o much affection as we: Receive, we mo<U+017F>t humbly
be<U+017F>eech you, the willingne<U+017F>s we have to expo<U+017F>e our lives in repul<U+017F>ing that violence
which was offered unto you. I do prote<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and turned his
head towards her, I <U+017F>hall leave this world the mo<U+017F>t contented man that is in it,
<U+017F>ince I have lo<U+017F>t my life in your <U+017F>ervice; and if you will have me think my death more
welcome then ever was my life, fair <hi>Dorinde,</hi> Do but only <U+017F>ay, Go in peace <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes.</hi>

                        <hi>Dorinde</hi> turning her eyes upon <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> and <U+017F>eeing a mortal palene<U+017F>s in his
face, <U+017F>he only embraced <hi>Merindor</hi> and <hi>Periander,</hi> and not having lei<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>peak
unto them, <U+017F>he ran unto <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> who expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch <U+017F>igns of perfect content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as every one ob<U+017F>erved an alteration in his eyes and countenance; but e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when <U+017F>he took his hand, and <U+017F>aid unto him; If heaven hath decreed that you
mu<U+017F>t end your days in this relief which your Valour has given me, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi>
that it <U+017F>hall never be forgotten; and if it be the plea<U+017F>ure of the Gods, as I

I be<U+017F>eech you accept al<U+017F>o of my <U+017F>oul, which I do mo<U+017F>t religiou<U+017F>ly devote unto you,

her hand, but he wanted <U+017F>trength; for he grew pale and cold, and immediately
died in the arms of that Cavalier who held him in the bed, and who<U+017F>e tears and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
made all beholders pity him.</p>
                     <p>This la<U+017F>t action of <hi>Bellimartes</hi> did <U+017F>o mollifie the heart of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the fault which he had committed again<U+017F>t her, and reviving the memory of that
affection which by <U+017F>o many addre<U+017F><U+017F>es he had expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto her, <U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e
but accompany his death with tears of compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion and amity; an office which <U+017F>he
continued long in performing, and had continued longer, if the company, moved
unto pity, had not removed her by force from the Corps; <U+017F>o <U+017F>eeing her <U+017F>elf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained
to leave him, Adieu <hi>Bellimartes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto his corps) if thou did<U+017F>t think
it a happine<U+017F>s to have my love, go contented into the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, &amp; be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that
thou art happier in thy death then in thy life. The<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions were accompanied
with tears, to te<U+017F>tifie they were real, and that he had gotten her love in dying, more
then he could have obtained by living.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t all the<U+017F>e things thus pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, a great number of Shepherds in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Vilages came running with Pike-<U+017F>taves, and <U+017F>uch Arms as they u<U+017F>ed in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and <U+017F>ome brought Bows and Arrows, <U+017F>uch as they u<U+017F>ed at their general A<U+017F><U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in the Forre<U+017F>t of <hi>I<U+017F>oures,</hi> and other meetings: <U+017F>o as in a little time there was a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53527:181"/>
great Army about this little Cabin: Their a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment was not a little when they
heard of the violence which was offered unto that fair <U+017F>tranger by the fir<U+017F>t company,
and when they heard of the relief which the la<U+017F>t brought her <U+017F>o opportunely; and
their wonder was more yet, when they <U+017F>aw tho<U+017F>e marks which the Cavaliers left of
their courage and valour. <hi>Merindor</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> <U+017F>eeing <hi>Dorinde</hi> in the hands of
the <hi>Druide</hi> and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, they thought it fit to leave her a little to dry up her
tears, whil<U+017F>t in the mean time they went to pay that office unto their dead compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which the <U+017F>urvivors were obliged unto; and the more, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Periander</hi> had
lo<U+017F>t a co<U+017F>in german, and <hi>Merindor</hi> a brother, whom they exceedingly loved. Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore the other Cavalier with the corps of <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> they went out of the
cabin, accompanied with many Shepherds, and went afterwards among<U+017F>t the dead
to look for their kinred: They found them both clo<U+017F>e by one another; the one was
run through with a Javelin which pierced his heart, and <hi>Merindor</hi>'s brother lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his hor<U+017F>e with a wound given by a <U+017F>word through his brea<U+017F>t; but as a note of
their valour, four dead enemies did lie about the<U+017F>e two, who held their <U+017F>words <U+017F>till
in their hands, with vi<U+017F>ages which <U+017F>eemed to threaten as well dead as alive.</p>
                     <p>The griefs and lamentation of <hi>Merindor</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> were indeed very great,
and had been greater, if <U+017F>ome <hi>Druides</hi> had not at the <U+017F>ame time come thither; and
this great number of people were <U+017F>ent by their authority to appea<U+017F>e the tumult, as
upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions they u<U+017F>ed to do. The<U+017F>e <hi>Druides</hi> under<U+017F>tanding the ju<U+017F>t and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
defence which tho<U+017F>e Cavaliers had made in relieving this <U+017F>tranger; after that
they had highly commended them, and in the name of the Country given them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thanks, they endeavoured by all manner of ways to comfort them, and therefore
they de<U+017F>ired them to leave their immoderate grief, and al<U+017F>o leave the care of their
friends interment unto them; which after many entreaties they permitted, but not
without embracing and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing their dead kinred <U+017F>everal times, and bidding them their
la<U+017F>t farewel.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Druides</hi> being advertized that there was yet one of their companions dead in
the next cabin? they went and brought him thither, and there wa<U+017F>hed their Corps in
the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> afterwards interred them in the place where the combate was; and
la<U+017F>tly, they rai<U+017F>ed up monuments of Earth upon their graves, and decked them with
all the rural Art that is imaginable. This Funeral ceremony was performed with <U+017F>o
much honour and order, that <hi>Merindor, Periander,</hi> and the Cavalier who was
friend unto <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> had rea<U+017F>on in <U+017F>ome degree to le<U+017F><U+017F>en their mourning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dorinde</hi> during all the time of this ceremony, never <U+017F>tirred out of the cabin, becau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>he had not yet recollected her <U+017F>elf, nor was rid of her fears; The Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es
<hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> with the di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide,</hi> did keep <hi>Florice, Cercinea,</hi>
and <hi>Palinice</hi> company; all whom could not <U+017F>ufficiently wonder at this unaccu<U+017F>tomed
accident: And when <hi>Periander</hi> and <hi>Merindor</hi> returned to give an account of that
charitable office which they had performed, they, <U+017F>aw a Shepherd coming, who <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be in very great ha<U+017F>te; when he was a little nearer, he was known to be <hi>Hylas:
Periander</hi> no <U+017F>ooner heard him named, but he cryed out; Oh God, <U+017F>aid he, is it
<hi>Hylas</hi> of the I<U+017F>le of <hi>Camargues,</hi> the be<U+017F>t humored man alive, and the mo<U+017F>t jolly
companion? The very <U+017F>ame, an<U+017F>wered one of the <hi>Druides</hi> that came with them,
he has <U+017F>ojourned in this Country <U+017F>everal moneths; and he found every day <U+017F>o delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as I do not think he will ever leave it. <hi>Periander</hi> then turning towards <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
Brother (<U+017F>aid he) I be<U+017F>eech you go you unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and tell her, if <U+017F>he ask
for me, that you left me with <hi>Hylas,</hi> I am confident <U+017F>he will be very glad to hear it,
for I mu<U+017F>t needs go and meet and embrace him as one of my be<U+017F>t friends: Upon this,
he went a great pace towards <hi>Hylas,</hi> who <U+017F>eeing him coming, did not know him, as
well becau<U+017F>e of his Arms, as becau<U+017F>e he little expected to find him in that place:
<hi>Periander</hi> held out his Arms, and embraced him, he not knowing that the<U+017F>e care<U+017F><U+017F>es
came from <hi>Periander.</hi> But when he <U+017F>aid unto him, Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>Hylas</hi> that you <U+017F>hould
be turned a Shepherd of Forre<U+017F>ts, and quite forget your good friends? His voice
made him know that face which he had forgotten, and therefore he took him about
the neck and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed him, and was <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported with joy, that he <U+017F>eemed to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
out of him<U+017F>elf. Then <hi>Periander</hi> <U+017F>aid unto him, <U+017F>ee <hi>Hylas</hi> whether I have not
good rea<U+017F>on to complain again<U+017F>t your memory, that does not only forget me when
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53527:181"/>
I am ab<U+017F>ent but al<U+017F>o when I am pre<U+017F>ent; but I am glad to <U+017F>ee you, and to te<U+017F>tifie
how really I love you, I am come to <U+017F>ee you, accompanied with one whom you
love the be<U+017F>t of any in the world. <hi>Periander</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas</hi>) I pray di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h
what kind of one you <U+017F>peak? It is a man or a woman? For if it be a man, none can
be more welcom unto me then your <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ince there is none I love better then I do
<hi>Periander;</hi> and if it be a woman, then, if it be <U+017F>he I love be<U+017F>t, you have met with
<hi>Stella,</hi> for it is <U+017F>he unto whom I have devoted my <U+017F>elf. What? replied <hi>Periander,</hi>
have you forgotten <hi>Dorinde? Dorinde</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> I perceive my good friend,
that you have forgotten the cu<U+017F>tom of <hi>Hylas;</hi> you mu<U+017F>t know, that her name has
hardly room in my memory: for <U+017F>ince I have <U+017F>een <U+017F>o many <hi>Crey<U+017F>ides,</hi> <U+017F>o many <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donthes,</hi>
<U+017F>o many <hi>Laonices,</hi> <U+017F>o many <hi>Philli<U+017F>es,</hi> <U+017F>o many <hi>Alexi<U+017F>es,</hi> and above all one
<hi>Stella,</hi> who dazles my eyes, I tell you the lu<U+017F>ter of <U+017F>o many new lights, will not let
me <U+017F>ee, the ob<U+017F>curities of your City of <hi>Lyons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I perceive (<U+017F>aid <hi>Periander,</hi> and <U+017F>miled) that you are <U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame <hi>Hylas,</hi> upon the
banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> that you were wont to be upon tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Arar.</hi> The very <U+017F>ame
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) but yet, if <hi>Dorinde</hi> be here, I <U+017F>hall be glad to <U+017F>ee her, that I may know
whether my mouth was not in tho<U+017F>e dayes out of ta<U+017F>te: If you de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee her, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Periander,</hi> you may go into that Cabin, and find her <U+017F>till frighted, at an accident
which hapned: What accident? <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> it is, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Periander,</hi> that but for
<hi>Bellimartes, Merindor,</hi> and my <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>ome of King <hi>Gondebauts</hi> Souldiers would have
carried her away: but we finding her ju<U+017F>t in the very nick of time, we made them
quit their enterprize; but alas the poor <hi>Bellimartes</hi> is dead, with <hi>Merindor</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I have lo<U+017F>t a Co<U+017F>en germane. How? replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> have you thus hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
King <hi>Gondebaut</hi>'s men? If <U+017F>o, I be<U+017F>eech you, carry me to <hi>Dorinde,</hi> for I mu<U+017F>t of
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity adverti<U+017F>e her of <U+017F>ome things which I have heard, and which cau<U+017F>ed me to
come hither in <U+017F>uch ha<U+017F>te.</p>
                     <p>They were then clo<U+017F>e by the Cabin, <U+017F>o as <hi>Hylas</hi> upon this entred, who <U+017F>eeing all
the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es about the <U+017F>tranger, did judge her to be <hi>Dorinde;</hi> but faigning not
to know her: where is this new Shepherde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid he, who at her fir<U+017F>t coming has
<U+017F>tained the purity of our banks with bloody Sacrifices? <hi>Dorinde</hi> then knowing <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
ro<U+017F>e up to <U+017F>alute him, being very glad to meet him in that place, where <U+017F>he
thought <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould need all manner of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and going towards him, is it po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
<hi>Hylas;</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that my face <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o changed, as your eyes <U+017F>hould not
know her now, whom your heart did formerly know <U+017F>o well? I believe, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Hylas,</hi> that if my heart were here, it might an<U+017F>wer the que<U+017F>tions which you ask, but
<U+017F>ince it is not, I think there are few here who can tell what to <U+017F>ay unto them. How?
<U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> your heart not here? Who is the thief that <U+017F>tole it? As for any male
thieves, replied he, I know how to keep it well enough from them; but I mu<U+017F>t
confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my bad influences has <U+017F>ubmitted me unto <U+017F>ome certain Female thieves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
whom I cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly defend my <U+017F>elf: and the wor<U+017F>t is, they are of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that the fir<U+017F>t thing they <U+017F>eize upon is the heart, <U+017F>o as I can very <U+017F>eldom keep
this little piece of hou<U+017F>hold <U+017F>tuffe in my hou<U+017F>e. I believe, <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that when
the<U+017F>e Femal thieves do <U+017F>teal it from you, it is not long before you can furni<U+017F>h your
<U+017F>elf with another: You are mi<U+017F>taken (<U+017F>aid <hi>Florice</hi> and interrupted) for tho<U+017F>e who
do <U+017F>teal it, do find it <U+017F>uch a bad piece of <U+017F>tuff, that they pre<U+017F>ently re<U+017F>tore it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at the next meeting: you are mi<U+017F>taken your <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and you had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
have <U+017F>aid, that becau<U+017F>e it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible two hearts <U+017F>hould dwell together, without
the <U+017F>tronger driving out the weaker, tho<U+017F>e who do <U+017F>teal my heart, are con<U+017F>trained to
let theirs come unto me, and become mine, and <U+017F>tay with me until <U+017F>ome other thief
do <U+017F>teal it from me to give me her own; and therefore <hi>Dorinde,</hi> if you have any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion
for your heart, which you <U+017F>ent unto me, when you <U+017F>tole mine, ask it of <hi>Florice;</hi>
and you <hi>Florice,</hi> ask yours of <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> when you <U+017F>ee her next: and let <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide</hi> ask
hers of <hi>Madonthe;</hi> and if <hi>Madonthe</hi> will have that back, which I had of hers, let
her look out <hi>Laonice:</hi> and who<U+017F>oever has any thing to do with <hi>Laonices,</hi> they will
find it in <hi>Phillis:</hi> and you <hi>Phillis,</hi> if you de<U+017F>ire to have yours again to be<U+017F>tow upon
any Shepherd, bid the Fair <hi>Druide</hi> return it unto you; for as for hers which I had,
it is now in the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Stella,</hi> who in a happy exchange, did mo<U+017F>t courteou<U+017F>ly
give me hers, which I will keep as long as it plea<U+017F>eth me; but <hi>Dorinde,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:53527:182"/>
and interrupted, I be<U+017F>eech you let us di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e upon the<U+017F>e hearts another time
when we have more lei<U+017F>ure: <hi>Hylas</hi> comes to adverti<U+017F>e you, that you are not <U+017F>afe in
this place, and therefore it is requi<U+017F>ite you hear what he <U+017F>ays: you do very well, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Hylas,</hi> to put me in memory of it; for this new Shepherde<U+017F>s, does <U+017F>o put me in
mind of what is pa<U+017F>t, that I forget the pre<U+017F>ent. Let me tell you therefore that not
long <U+017F>ince, as I lay clo<U+017F>e in a bu<U+017F>h expecting a Shepherde<U+017F>s whom I loved, and was
to walk that way with her Flock, I <U+017F>aw four men on hor<U+017F>-back, terribly affrighted,
and in great di<U+017F>order; and one of them had a great cut upon his hand, which bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extreamly, con<U+017F>trained them to alight very near the place where I was; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left one to watch whether any followed, the other held the hor<U+017F>es, and the
third tore his handkerchief, gathered a little ground-mo<U+017F><U+017F>e, and applied it unto the
wound to <U+017F>top the blood; in the mean time I heard one of them <U+017F>ay, that if they
made a little more ha<U+017F>te, they <U+017F>hould meet with the re<U+017F>t of their company from whom
they were parted; &amp; then they would return, and be revenged, by bringing away that
woman whom King <hi>Gondebaut</hi> <U+017F>o much de<U+017F>ired to have. As <U+017F>oon as they were gone,
I met with <U+017F>ome Shepherds, who told me partly what had hapned in this place, unto
which I came purpo<U+017F>ely to tell you, that unle<U+017F>s you have a mind to fall into their
hands, you mu<U+017F>t remove from this place. Oh ye Gods! (cryed out <hi>Dorinde</hi> with
tears in her eyes) will not fortune let me remain at re<U+017F>t, even in the<U+017F>e <U+017F>olitary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Periander,</hi> when we came away from <hi>Lyons,</hi> we heard that you
were pur<U+017F>ued by many of King <hi>Gondebauts</hi> guard; and therefore if you will take my
advice, you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>eek out <U+017F>ome place of <U+017F>trength for your <U+017F>ecurity: as long as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindor</hi>
and I do live, we will defend you again<U+017F>t all the world; but we being but
three, with this Cavalier that is friend unto <hi>Bellimartes,</hi> our lives may be taken away
by a multitude, and you injured, which is wor<U+017F>e then the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of us. <hi>Licydas</hi> upon
this, who was come unto this place upon the noi<U+017F>e, a little before <hi>Hylas.</hi> Madam,
<U+017F>aid he, we will all of us <U+017F>erve you, again<U+017F>t all that <U+017F>hall offer you any injury; but
give me leave to tell you, that to avoid a mis-fortune, it were good you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> where your merits would meet with much honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect
from all: the great Nymph <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> and <hi>Galathea,</hi> will bid you welcom, and
defend you again<U+017F>t all violence.</p>
                     <p>Every one did much approve of this advice; And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Dorinde</hi> was unwilling
to put her <U+017F>elf into the hands of the<U+017F>e Cavaliers by her <U+017F>elf alone, <hi>Florice, Cercinea,
Palinice,</hi> and <hi>Celidea,</hi> offered them<U+017F>elves to accompany her, provided <U+017F>ome Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
would go with them, becau<U+017F>e they would not return alone. <hi>Hylas, Lycidas,
Thamires, Calidon</hi> and <hi>Corilas,</hi> did pre<U+017F>ent them<U+017F>elves very freely: and therefore
without more delay, after the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers had bid adieu unto <hi>Alexis, Diana, A<U+017F>trea,</hi>
and <hi>Phillis,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, they <U+017F>et forward: the three Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,
mounted and armed as when they came fir<U+017F>t, kept at a <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>tance from the
company, in a po<U+017F>ture to defend them, if any came to a<U+017F><U+017F>ault them: and the re<U+017F>t of
the Shepherds, helped the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es to walk, whil<U+017F>t <hi>Thamires</hi> helped his dear
<hi>Celidea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now all the company parted; <hi>A<U+017F>trea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> to accompany <hi>Alexis,</hi>
went towards the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Phocion,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it grew very late; and by the way, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
the accident that had hapned unto this <U+017F>tranger: I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,
Dorinde</hi> is le<U+017F><U+017F>e beholding unto tho<U+017F>e that love her, then to tho<U+017F>e that do not; why?
<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, tho<U+017F>e that do not love her, do not deceive her,
and tho<U+017F>e that do, betray her: why good Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) do you not think that
all men are deceivers? Certainly you are deceived if you think otherwi<U+017F>e: for believe
it for an infallible truth, that fal<U+017F>hood and treachery will be in the world as long as
there is one man in it. <hi>Alexis,</hi> who though in the habit of a woman, yet could not
<U+017F>hake off tho<U+017F>e re<U+017F>entments of a man which nature had infu<U+017F>ed; is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible di<U+017F>creet
and Fair Shepherde<U+017F>s, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) that you <U+017F>hould think as you <U+017F>peak? Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> that you <U+017F>hould live to this age, and be ignorant of the
truth of which we <U+017F>peak? That men <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o bad as you <U+017F>ay they are, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi>
and yet I not know it, is not <U+017F>trange: for my education among<U+017F>t <hi>Druids</hi> has been <U+017F>o
retired from all men, that we do hardly know them further then by name: but yet
I cannot imagine that the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> who is all goodne<U+017F>s, would ever give unto
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53527:182"/>
our <U+017F>ex <U+017F>uch a bad companion as you repre<U+017F>ent him. I can an<U+017F>wer you no otherwi<U+017F>e
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>) but that it is a <U+017F>ecret re<U+017F>erved to him<U+017F>elf: and if it be lawful for me to
tell you what I think, I believe it is to make us exerci<U+017F>e the virtue of Patience. Oh
Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I am not of your opinion, and I believe very few are: <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi>
replied <hi>Diana,</hi> how were you <U+017F>atisfied with <hi>Celadon?</hi> for my part an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi>
I had no rea<U+017F>on to be ill <U+017F>atisfied with him you name, no more then you were with
<hi>Philander:</hi> I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> I had no rea<U+017F>on to be di<U+017F>-<U+017F>atisfied in
him, but I believe if he had lived longer, I might have been, for he was a man: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis</hi>
hearing <hi>Celadon</hi> named, began to blu<U+017F>h, and not daring to look upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea,</hi>
<U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t her eyes upon the ground; but when <U+017F>he heard her <U+017F>ay that <U+017F>he had
no rea<U+017F>on to be more di<U+017F>-<U+017F>atisfied with <hi>Celadon,</hi> then <hi>Diana</hi> was with <hi>Philander,</hi> <U+017F>he
was very de<U+017F>irous to know what occa<U+017F>ions of di<U+017F>-<U+017F>atisfaction <hi>Philander</hi> had ever gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
her, to the end <U+017F>he might know by that, what it was which his Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e
complained of: and <U+017F>eeing that <hi>Diana,</hi> did not an<U+017F>wer any further, <U+017F>he began:
But di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) oblige me <U+017F>o far, I be<U+017F>eech you, as to
tell me freely, what di<U+017F>-<U+017F>atisfaction you received from that Shepherd of whom you
<U+017F>peak. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e would be too long and tedious for
your ears, and for me to relate. You may if you plea<U+017F>e, replied <hi>Celadon,</hi> epitomize
it in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a method, as will not be a trouble unto either. <hi>Phillis</hi> upon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
for her: Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I be<U+017F>eech you, pardon her from that whole dayes
work, which I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you would weary her more then you imagine: I <U+017F>hould mo<U+017F>t
willingly <U+017F>atisfie your curio<U+017F>ity, and tell you what di<U+017F>-<U+017F>atisfaction <hi>Diana</hi> received from
that Shepherd; but that I know the bad fortune of <hi>Philander,</hi> made <U+017F>uch a wound in
the <U+017F>oul of <hi>Diana,</hi> as cannot be touched with never <U+017F>o delicate a hand, but it is <U+017F>o
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible as will grieve her: but Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto <hi>Diana,</hi> pray tell me, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
have you again<U+017F>t <hi>Lycidas?</hi> I <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> that he is not yet dead
nor married, and that perhaps before either of the<U+017F>e come to pa<U+017F>s, <U+017F>uch things may
fall out, as may give you occa<U+017F>ion to rank him in the Catalogue of men. Oh Si<U+017F>ter,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> who do you foretel <U+017F>uch things as cannot chu<U+017F>e but infinitely di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e
me? and of which there is no appearance? But I <U+017F>ee, a pallate out of ta<U+017F>te, makes all
viands <U+017F>eem bitter. Si<U+017F>ter, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I know your meaning; but con<U+017F>ider, that
he is a man, and con<U+017F>equently a deceiver: and when <hi>Merindor</hi> deceived <hi>Dorinde,</hi>
there was no appearance, nor no likelyhood he <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>o: and yet you <U+017F>ee he
did. You mu<U+017F>t know, that deceipts, are not deceipts, unle<U+017F>s they deceive the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of tho<U+017F>e again<U+017F>t whom they are done, and therefore they mu<U+017F>t be done <U+017F>o,
as there may be no appearance or thought of them before hand. For my part, <U+017F>aid
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> who has no intere<U+017F>t in the<U+017F>e things you <U+017F>peak of, I ought to be believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either of you, and therefore hearken unto my opinion: I do believe, that men
are not <U+017F>uch deceivers as many do think them, nor <U+017F>o faithful, as many have opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
they are. Good Servant (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) explain this riddle; Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea,</hi>
my meaning is, that <U+017F>ome men are deceivers, and <U+017F>ome are not; all ought
not to be mea<U+017F>ured by one and the <U+017F>ame ell; and that the virtues and vices of <U+017F>ome,
ought not to be the honour, or di<U+017F>-honour of others: and therefore, tho<U+017F>e who
have cau<U+017F>e to complain again<U+017F>t the infidelity of men, ought not to <U+017F>ay po<U+017F>itively
that they are all deceivers: nor tho<U+017F>e who have full a<U+017F><U+017F>urance of the fidelity
of <U+017F>ome particular man, mu<U+017F>t not think, but that another may be unfaithfull.</p>
                     <p>Their Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had la<U+017F>ted longer, had they not heard the voice of a Shepherd
<U+017F>inging, whom they pre<U+017F>ently knew to be <hi>Sylvander:</hi> and coming a little neerer
the hedge where he <U+017F>ate, they heard him repeat <U+017F>ome ver<U+017F>es, which intimated that
he was not changed: <hi>Diana</hi> who was the fir<U+017F>t that heard him, would have drawn off
the company from hearing any further: but for all that, they would needs hear him
on: and then they heard him break out into the<U+017F>e expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions.</p>
                     <p>Mi<U+017F>erable <hi>Sylvander</hi> (<U+017F>aid he with a deep <U+017F>igh) why do<U+017F>t thou drone on this mi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
life, and has <U+017F>uch, and <U+017F>o much rea<U+017F>on to die? Is it out of hopes of any better
Fortune? Ah fond man, is it not full time to undeceive thy <U+017F>elf, at lea<U+017F>t, if thou ha<U+017F>t
any con<U+017F>ideration, any feeling, or any <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility of thy unfortunate life? Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne<U+017F>t

name one minute that was not remarkable for <U+017F>ome misfortune or other? I cannot
indeed call that hour di<U+017F>a<U+017F>trous in which I fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>aw <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>ince in her I <U+017F>aw all the
excellencies and perfection that Nature can give unto mortals: but was not that the
time that Fortune took a greater Empire over me then ever <U+017F>he had before? For if
<U+017F>he had any power over me before, it was only over my poor <U+017F>heep; and the little
<U+017F>tock which I had, but my <U+017F>oul was free, and exempt from blows and changes: But
oh ye Gods! <U+017F>ince I <U+017F>aw this fair, this divinely fair <hi>Diana,</hi> my <U+017F>oul is a <U+017F>lave, and
from being in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, is grown <U+017F>o weak and <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F>s, that the lea<U+017F>t Will of this
Shepherde<U+017F>s is a Law unto me, her commands are Oracles, and the lea<U+017F>t twinkle of
her, commands <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olute, that I would rather chu<U+017F>e the wor<U+017F>t death, then di<U+017F>obey
the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>haddow of her Will: and is not this the very height of mi<U+017F>ery, that all
my cares, all my <U+017F>ervices, all my endeavours, and all my extream pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions <U+017F>hould be
<U+017F>o many offences, and <U+017F>o many injuries unto her? If the Univer<U+017F>e, and all that is
compri<U+017F>ed in it, be ruled and governed by rea<U+017F>on, what rea<U+017F>on is there, that I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

<U+017F>he <U+017F>hould make no return but hatred and <U+017F>corn? Then making a <U+017F>top, and <U+017F>taying
mute a while, he began again: But oh ye Gods! I do under<U+017F>tand this <U+017F>ecret, or at
the lea<U+017F>t I think I do; It is to puni<U+017F>h me becau<U+017F>e I have loved this divine <hi>Diana</hi> too
much, and have preferred my affection unto her, before that which I owed unto
you. But if it be <U+017F>o, give me leave with all reverence to expo<U+017F>tulate a little with
you; why did you not make her with le<U+017F>s perfection? For being as <U+017F>he is, it were
a <U+017F>in to love her le<U+017F>s then I do: But well (<U+017F>aid he with a profound <U+017F>igh) do your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure,
and if you think good, double and redouble your puni<U+017F>hment, for I cannot le<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en
or dimini<U+017F>h one jot.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Sylvander</hi> was talking thus to him<U+017F>elf, <hi>Diana</hi> had got a good di<U+017F>tance off,

<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and whi<U+017F>pered them in their ears, that if they intended to <U+017F>tay any longer, <U+017F>he
would go and <U+017F>tay with her; but the <hi>Druide</hi> and her companion <U+017F>eeing it was

where they could not receive any better <U+017F>atisfaction of this Shepherds innocency then
they had; and therefore <U+017F>tealing off unperceived, they went as fa<U+017F>t as they could to
overtake <hi>Diana,</hi> unto whom they told all that they could in di<U+017F>charge of <hi>Sylvander.</hi>
But <U+017F>he, <U+017F>eeming as if <U+017F>he cared not, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered in <U+017F>uch a kind of neglective man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as if he were not <hi>Sylvander</hi> they talked of, or as if <U+017F>he was not <hi>Diana</hi> whom
they talked to.</p>
                     <p>

how hard a thing it is to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t a domineering pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, fair Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es

Why do you <U+017F>ay this? <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea.</hi> Becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervant (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis</hi>) hearing the

he does love infinitely who can endure it. And with what coldne<U+017F>s <hi>Diana</hi> does <U+017F>light

and become <U+017F>eeming rea<U+017F>on. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you pardon me,
if I tell you, That you are mi<U+017F>taken in both the judgements which you have given:
For as to that which relates unto me, believe it to be a very ea<U+017F>ie matter to carry it
as I do, having no intere<U+017F>t at all in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, as you think I have: And as to that
which relates unto the Shepherd, be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, That not only about the Banks of
<hi>Lignon,</hi> but every place where the name of Love is known, men do <U+017F>tudy more to
di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e and di<U+017F><U+017F>emble their affections, then to render them real and great: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emble

but empty wind, and the lea<U+017F>t prick of a pin di<U+017F>covers their empty imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Sage Shepherde<U+017F>s, replied the <hi>Druide,</hi> I do believe that you have more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
then I in the humours of tho<U+017F>e you <U+017F>peak of; but give me leave to tell you,
that <hi>Sylvander</hi> does love. I do believe it Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> but it is <hi>Madon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the.</hi>
I do believe (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) that <hi>Sylvander</hi> does love, and that he does love none
but <hi>Diana.</hi> Then certainly (replied <U+017F>he) <hi>Madonthe</hi> has changed her name, and
calls her <U+017F>elf <hi>Diana;</hi> and if you will not believe me, I will refer you unto <hi>Laonice.</hi>

You will find <U+017F>aid (<U+017F>aid the <hi>Druide</hi>) in the end, that there is <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret mi<U+017F>tery in
the report of <hi>Laonice:</hi> for if it were <U+017F>o, that <hi>Sylvander</hi> did love <hi>Madonthe,</hi> why
<U+017F>hould he <U+017F>eem to love you? What benefit will accrue unto him by di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ing it?
To blind the eyes, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, of the jealous <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander:</hi> this might be <U+017F>o, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Alexis,</hi> in the time of <hi>Ther<U+017F>ander,</hi> and when <hi>Madonthe</hi> was here: but now
they are gone, to what purpo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould he <U+017F>o do? Oh Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> did you
but know the humours of men, e<U+017F>pecially of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> you would not make <U+017F>uch
a wonder at it: you mu<U+017F>t know that there is not a man under the cope of Heaven,
who de<U+017F>ires more to give a good opinion of him<U+017F>elf then he; and this is the rea<U+017F>on
that having made a <U+017F>hew of loving me formerly, he is now a<U+017F>hamed his fal<U+017F>hood
<U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>covered: all his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions and behaviour which you <U+017F>ee,
and think they proceed from affection, are but tricks and glo<U+017F><U+017F>es which he u<U+017F>es, out
of <U+017F>hame to be thought a di<U+017F><U+017F>embler, and a man of no faith.</p>
                     <p>If he were a<U+017F>hamed, as you object, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that <U+017F>hame would produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effects: for if he loved <hi>Madonthe,</hi> he would with all <U+017F>peed flye from tho<U+017F>e
places where his di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation would be known; and doubtle<U+017F>s would follow her
whom he loved: for I have heard that he has no relations in this country to <U+017F>tay him
in it, or invite him unto it more then any other place; for he is a man meerly of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and has nothing but what he gets by his indu<U+017F>try, which he may do any where
el<U+017F>e, as well as about the River <hi>Lignon:</hi> al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>peak of <hi>Sylvander</hi>'s humour,
I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that in this <U+017F>hort time I have known him, and ob<U+017F>erved his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
I find him to be a Shepherd of <U+017F>o free a Spirit, and of <U+017F>o pure and genuine wit, as I
cannot believe any <U+017F>uch abominable vice to be in him, as di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation is; and indeed
in<U+017F>tance me one action of all his life which argues him of that humour: I have heard
by a general report of all the Country, that he is a very Wi<U+017F>e, and Virtuous Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd:
and is it probable that one <U+017F>ingle man <U+017F>hould deceive <U+017F>o many eyes which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
his actions? A<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf <hi>Diana</hi> that you are mi<U+017F>taken in your judgement.
'Tis true Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> and interrupted, that perhaps I was: but now I am
not, and if one could fore<U+017F>ee the future, I never will be in my judgment of <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
unle<U+017F>s my re<U+017F>olution do change very much: <hi>Phillis</hi> who till then <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ilent to
hear the rea<U+017F>ons of her companion, <U+017F>eeing now that <U+017F>he replied not; <U+017F>he began to

has any here: and therefore you ought to receive what we <U+017F>ay, not as coming from
per<U+017F>ons who are well wi<U+017F>hers of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> but as from your good friends, who had
rather be deceived them<U+017F>elves, then be any In<U+017F>truments that others <U+017F>hould deceive

think that when we <U+017F>peak any thing of this Shepherd, it is not to divert you
from any good de<U+017F>ign you may have, nor to your prejudice to advantage <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
<U+017F>ince he is meerly indifferent unto us; but on the contrary, you know we love
you, and would if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible deliver you from an opinion which doubtle<U+017F>s, (<U+017F>et
as good a face upon it as you will) will bring you nothing but di<U+017F>content: Con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Si<U+017F>ter, that every one is blind in their own ca<U+017F>e, and often, that which they mo<U+017F>t

<U+017F>ay that <U+017F>he loved me, but mu<U+017F>t needs give credit unto the words of one whom I
think <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t; I receive this favour which you are plea<U+017F>ed to confer upon me, with
abundance of re<U+017F>pect and thanks; a<U+017F><U+017F>uring you, that both in this and every thing
el<U+017F>e, I will always prefer your judgment before my own in all things: but I be<U+017F>eech
you give me leave to tell you withall, that tho<U+017F>e who are not concerned in a bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
farther then re<U+017F>entment and compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion cau<U+017F>eth, commonly they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
nor look into the matter <U+017F>o neerly, as tho<U+017F>e who mu<U+017F>t bear all the burthen:
and to their advice and their coun<U+017F>els, although they do not proceed from any ill will,
but perhaps from much affection, yet may they be mi<U+017F>taken and be deficient in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

it be grounded upon mo<U+017F>t certain knowledg: and therefore we do commonly <U+017F>ay,
that every one knows be<U+017F>t where his <U+017F>hooe pinches him, or on which <U+017F>ide the pain
is mo<U+017F>t trouble<U+017F>ome. But Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> things that are dubious, and cannot
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53527:184"/>
be well made out, me thinks <U+017F>hould be decided by plurality of voices: for my part,
this has been always my rule, that were I <U+017F>ee all are of opinion that <U+017F>uch a thing is
of a green colour, which <U+017F>eems red unto me, I do infallibly believe, that my eye is
deceived, or el<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould think the thing to be of the <U+017F>ame colour which all others
do: you have an opinion that <hi>Sylvander</hi> loves <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and we all <U+017F>ay that there is
no <U+017F>uch thing, nor any probability of it; why therefore <U+017F>hould not you conform
your opinion unto ours? But Si<U+017F>ter, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> I am not alone; <hi>Laonice</hi> who
has <U+017F>een the truth, does <U+017F>econd me; <hi>Laonice,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> is <U+017F>ubtile enough to <U+017F>ay it,
with a de<U+017F>ign of putting you to abundance of pain and trouble. What profit, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Diana,</hi> will accrue unto her by that? The profit, replied <hi>Astrea,</hi> which <U+017F>uch reap
who are delighted in <U+017F>owing <U+017F>editious, it is their pa<U+017F>time and plea<U+017F>ure; and hers may
be to <U+017F>ee how you will carry it out, and perhaps to di<U+017F>cover, whether it be true that
<hi>Sylvander</hi> does love you, or you him: good Si<U+017F>ter, do not give more credit unto
that <U+017F>ubtile woman, then you do unto your deare<U+017F>t friends: the judgment of all
tho<U+017F>e who do know <hi>Sylvander,</hi> will be again<U+017F>t you; the whole cour<U+017F>e of that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
life has been <U+017F>uch, as his very enemies cannot lay the lea<U+017F>t reproach to his
charge: Joyn all the<U+017F>e together, and add thereunto the rea<U+017F>ons which we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented
unto you, and afterwards <U+017F>ee, whether it be likely, or have any <U+017F>hadow of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood,
that the <U+017F>ingle te<U+017F>timony of <hi>Laonice</hi> can be true and credible. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis</hi>) I have talked with <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and he does <U+017F>o peremptorily deny all
that <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>ays, that if <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>ay truly, he is the mo<U+017F>t dete<U+017F>table Shepherd in the
world. Yet every one does know (added <hi>Alexis</hi>) that <hi>Sylvander</hi> is a man who
<U+017F>ears the Gods, and is not ignorant of what is a <U+017F>in again<U+017F>t them; if he be not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
then he knows how great a <U+017F>in perjury is: and if he do fear the Gods, he
would never commit it; and therefore I conclude that my judgment was good, when
at the fir<U+017F>t I affirmed that <hi>Sylvander</hi> does love you, and that he loves none el<U+017F>e but
you. Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> and interrupted, not being able to endure the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, neither <hi>Sylvander</hi> nor I, do de<U+017F>erve you <U+017F>hould take <U+017F>o much
pains in talking of us, e<U+017F>pecially upon a <U+017F>ubject which concerns us <U+017F>o little: for as for
him, I believe all his demon<U+017F>trations of good will unto me, are only con<U+017F>equents of
that wager which is betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and him: and as for me, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you that I did
never receive them but under the notion of that di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, <U+017F>o as the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is of
<U+017F>o <U+017F>mall a weight, and we are both <U+017F>o little intere<U+017F>ted in it, that it is not worth talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any further. Oh Madam, cryed out <hi>Phillis,</hi> I prote<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he di<U+017F><U+017F>embles, and

al<U+017F>o that <hi>Sylvander</hi> loves you, I am <U+017F>ure you are not ignorant of it: <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trea,</hi>
began to laugh at the manner of <hi>Phillis</hi> in her expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions; and <hi>Diana</hi> her <U+017F>elf
could not forbear, although <U+017F>he endeavoured to hide it; and therefore recollecting
her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered thus; I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s Si<U+017F>ter, that I did blu<U+017F>h to hear you <U+017F>peak
thus, e<U+017F>pecially before this great <hi>Druide,</hi> what opinion do you think <U+017F>he will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of me, who has not had the honour to be known unto her till of late? But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

may <U+017F>ay as much, and almo<U+017F>t about the <U+017F>ame time, at lea<U+017F>t if reports make a true

therefore for my part, knowing them to be <U+017F>o, I <U+017F>hun them as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I
can: Oh Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> It is an ea<U+017F>ie matter for you to expel <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ad remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
of things which grieve you, for you have a good Father who loves you, and
helps you out with <U+017F>upplies of comforts; but were you an orphan, deprived of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother as I am, I believe you would more deeply re<U+017F>ent the remembrance
of <U+017F>uch fatal lo<U+017F><U+017F>es: but however, I have mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on to be thankful unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which after <U+017F>o great a lo<U+017F>s has not left me without <U+017F>ome <U+017F>upport, in giving me a
<U+017F>econd Father, unto whom I am obliged in double bonds of gratitude; but for all
that, believe it Mi<U+017F>tris, it is a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ad con<U+017F>traint that <U+017F>eparates a child from Father
and Mother. Upon this <hi>Phocion</hi> began to <U+017F>peak; It is mo<U+017F>t certain children (<U+017F>aid
he) for <U+017F>o my age permits me to call you, that fortune has the <U+017F>ame power in all
places alike; and that <U+017F>he is plea<U+017F>ed to make her power known as well in Villages, as
in great Monarchies. But it is true al<U+017F>o, that as high and lofty Towers are more
expo<U+017F>ed to the tearing tempe<U+017F>ts and blu<U+017F>tering winds, then the humble Cottages
wherein we live, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o we do more <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>ee any of the<U+017F>e bloody con<U+017F>equences
of fortune among<U+017F>t us: they are much more frequent in great Empires, and proud
Republiques, which the more re<U+017F>t and quiet they have, the fuller they are of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and inquietudes, and of greater turbulencies then our poor Villages are capable
of: <U+017F>o as what we e<U+017F>teem a <U+017F>torm, is with them a calm. This was the main rea<U+017F>on
why tho<U+017F>e from whom we are de<U+017F>cended, did chu<U+017F>e this kind of life, as the mo<U+017F>t
happy which mortals can make choi<U+017F>e of. But for all that, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> I do
hear as many complaints and griefs among<U+017F>t you, as among<U+017F>t the greate<U+017F>t Potents
upon earth. So children, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phocion,</hi> do u<U+017F>e to cry for the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of an apple,
as if it were the lo<U+017F><U+017F>e of a great Empire: For my part (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi> and interrupted)
I do not think <U+017F>orrows are greater, for having the greater cau<U+017F>es of them; but that
is lea<U+017F>t which is lea<U+017F>t re<U+017F>ented. Mo<U+017F>t true, replied <hi>Phocion,</hi> it is <U+017F>o in regard unto the
troubled <U+017F>oul, but not <U+017F>o, if it be re<U+017F>ented, and mea<U+017F>ured according to the right
rules of rea<U+017F>on; for then every thing will be re<U+017F>ented and e<U+017F>teemed as it is: and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
when the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion is cea<U+017F>ed, we do laugh at that, at which we cryed before;
but all our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Phocion,</hi> <U+017F>eeing them ready to ri<U+017F>e from the Table) does
teach us this, that there is no place under the cope of Heaven which is entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the blows of fortune, and that we ought alwayes to <U+017F>tand upon our
guards again<U+017F>t them, that when they come to a<U+017F><U+017F>ault us, we may not only re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t
them, but al<U+017F>o without taking the <U+017F>hadow for the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which is commonly the
greater, we may mea<U+017F>ure them according to rea<U+017F>on, and not with any partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>entments
of tho<U+017F>e blows which we receive, nor with too many tears which <U+017F>eldom
do any good, but with prudence, rea<U+017F>on, moderation and patience.</p>

Palinice;</hi> and did you <U+017F>ee <hi>Cry<U+017F>eide,</hi> you would <U+017F>ay that all tho<U+017F>e whom I love,
are hugely beholding to me; for I leave them all fairer then I found them: and not
like tho<U+017F>e bla<U+017F>ters of Beauty (for <U+017F>o may all your <hi>Thamyre<U+017F>es,</hi> your <hi>Tyrci<U+017F>es,</hi> your
<hi>Sylvanders,</hi> and <U+017F>uch like be called) who never leave any one of tho<U+017F>e they love, till
they have either made them ugly, or brought them to their graves, as two of you
have done, and you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee what will become of <hi>Diana,</hi> before the wilful <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <U+017F>he part; you <U+017F>ee <U+017F>he is now young, and very fair; and I dare venture the
affection which I have unto <hi>Stella,</hi> that before he quit her, either he or <U+017F>he are in
their graves; then what will become of tho<U+017F>e fair eyes, and a hundred alluring fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
Well, well, God keep you from <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ervants, as will never let tho<U+017F>e they love
alone till they be dead; nay, even in their very graves they will be troubling them.
Pray <U+017F>ee I be<U+017F>eech you, if any that ever I <U+017F>erved were u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>o indi<U+017F>creetly: No, no,
when I leave them, I leave them in <U+017F>uch a condition, as others are contented to love
them after me. Do not think <hi>Hylas</hi> (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Thamires</hi> <U+017F>oberly) that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy
which we do <U+017F>o religiou<U+017F>ly ob<U+017F>erve, and which you do <U+017F>o much inveigh again<U+017F>t,
is either an humour, or any ob<U+017F>tinacy, but only an earne<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire not to fail in tho<U+017F>e
duties which we owe both unto our <U+017F>elves and unto tho<U+017F>e we love; Unto our <U+017F>elves,
becau<U+017F>e alteration of opinion is to condemn that which we once approved of, and
there is nothing more <U+017F>hameful, nor which <U+017F>hews more defects in a man then that;
For if it be under<U+017F>tanding which prefers us before the re<U+017F>t of animals, are not tho<U+017F>e
who want this under<U+017F>tanding no better then bea<U+017F>ts without rea<U+017F>on? But of all vices,
Incon<U+017F>tancy does mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cover and argue that defect; then <hi>Hylas,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity
confe<U+017F>s, that none can commit a greater offence, then by <U+017F>hewing them<U+017F>elves
wavering and incon<U+017F>tant: For the Will which never con<U+017F>ents unto any thing but
what the Judgement tells him is good, chu<U+017F>ing another object, does undeniably ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
that his judgement was deceived either the fir<U+017F>t or the <U+017F>econd time: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though there were no other rea<U+017F>on but our own particular reputation, we ought
never to con<U+017F>ent unto incon<U+017F>tancy, which renders us mo<U+017F>t worthy of all <U+017F>corn and
contempt. But further, it a mo<U+017F>t unpardonable offence again<U+017F>t the per<U+017F>on whom
we do love; For <hi>Hylas,</hi> does any change but when they think they change for the
better? And therefore is it not an injury unto her whom we loved, to leave her for
another, <U+017F>ince we do as good as <U+017F>ay that the la<U+017F>t is the better? <hi>Hylas</hi> not being able
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53527:185"/>
to endure that <hi>Thamires</hi> <U+017F>hould go any further with this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e without interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
he went nearer him, and looked him in the face, and <U+017F>eeming de<U+017F>irous to look
under his clothes, Shepherd (<U+017F>aid he unto him) let me <U+017F>ee, if under the habit of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,
Sylvander</hi> be not di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed, for me-thinks I hear him <U+017F>peak in his tone. Ah
<hi>Hylas,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Thamires,</hi> your having that opinion, is a <U+017F>igne you think my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be good; for there is nothing which comes from <U+017F>o excellent a wit, which
ought not to be e<U+017F>teemed <U+017F>o. You are very much mi<U+017F>taken good <hi>Thamires,</hi> replied
<hi>Hylas,</hi> for hearing your arguments <U+017F>o <U+017F>hallow and ill-grounded, I thought them to
be his, or he him<U+017F>elf which uttered them, and not <hi>Thamires,</hi> who is held for a very
prudent and wi<U+017F>e Shepherd; and to make good what I <U+017F>ay, I will <U+017F>hew you how
fal<U+017F>e your rea<U+017F>ons are.</p>
                     <p>You affirm that one ought to continue in his ob<U+017F>tinacy of loving one that they
once loved, in two con<U+017F>iderations: The one in re<U+017F>pect of him<U+017F>elf; and the other in
re<U+017F>pect of her whom he loves. Ah <hi>Thamires!</hi> It is an ea<U+017F>ie matter to you who are
antiquated; for your clothes are not only made after the old mode, but your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are as old, and cut out according to the old Gauli<U+017F>h garb: Good friend, is
there any thing in a man more de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>able then <U+017F>illine<U+017F>s and indi<U+017F>cretion? And is it not
the height of indi<U+017F>cretion and <U+017F>illine<U+017F>s, to know what is happine<U+017F>s, and to court and
follow that which will make him mi<U+017F>erable? I be<U+017F>eech you fair and di<U+017F>creet Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es
be judges, and tell me whether you would not think that husbandman a very
fool, that has divers times found by experience <U+017F>uch a piece of ground is not fit for
corn, and will <U+017F>till continue <U+017F>owing it with the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>eed, and only out of a fooli<U+017F>h
fear, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>aid that he had no judgement at the fir<U+017F>t. Ah my good friend
<hi>Thamires,</hi> is it any thing but gain and profit that gets reputation in the<U+017F>e days? And
indeed, if one <U+017F>hould enquire of the quality and capacity of any one, be it either as
a <U+017F>ervant, or any other ways, Did you ever hear the que<U+017F>tion asked <U+017F>uch a one,
whether he be con<U+017F>tant or incon<U+017F>tant? No, no <hi>Thamires,</hi> but only whether he can
manage well his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, whether he be rich, whether he have good flocks, and
<U+017F>uch things as can encrea<U+017F>e and keep them, not by an ob<U+017F>tinate re<U+017F>olution never to
part with them, but by <U+017F>elling and changing them as oft as occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>hall require.
Suppo<U+017F>e friend, you were upon the Sea, you would quickly be <U+017F>hipwrack'd if you
kept your Sayl con<U+017F>tant to one wind; no, no, wi<U+017F>e men will turn their <U+017F>ayl to all
winds. The very <U+017F>ame it is in the affairs of the world, and it is <U+017F>overain wi<U+017F>dom to
change according to occa<U+017F>ions. And as to your a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion, that changing does of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
again<U+017F>t the per<U+017F>on whom one did love; good <hi>Thamires,</hi> what do you think of
me? Or, whom do you think I am? Is there not <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons who make bread, and
others who eat it? Do not <U+017F>ome make clothes, and others wear them? Why <U+017F>hould
I not give them the <U+017F>ame coun<U+017F>el that I would take my <U+017F>elf? I mean, that as I change
them for others, <U+017F>o let them change me for whom they like better, when they have
a mind unto it: But in as much as I think it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that tho<U+017F>e whom I once lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<U+017F>hould ever meet with a better, they mu<U+017F>t even content them<U+017F>elves as well as
they can, and con<U+017F>ider, that of all things in the world, <U+017F>ome are de<U+017F>tined unto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F>s,
and others unto mi<U+017F>ery. Among<U+017F>t hor<U+017F>es, <U+017F>ome are for the plow, and <U+017F>ome
are for the <U+017F>addle; among<U+017F>t dogs, <U+017F>ome lie in Ladies laps, and others lick the drip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
pan in the kitchin; and <U+017F>o among<U+017F>t men, <U+017F>ome to be <U+017F>erved, and others to
<U+017F>erve: 'Tis true, their fate is hard, but will they complain of <hi>Hylas</hi> for it? No, it
is not in me to command him who ordained them that cruel de<U+017F>tiny; but if they
will be complaining, it mu<U+017F>t be for being born under <U+017F>uch an unlucky con<U+017F>tellation:
and yet I mu<U+017F>t tell you, that this very offence which you pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, is nothing but
imagination: For when a Mu<U+017F>ician changes notes, does he change them becau<U+017F>e he
thought tho<U+017F>e he left to be wor<U+017F>e then tho<U+017F>e he took? No, no Shepherd, but it was
to make his Mu<U+017F>ique better, and more delightful, which otherwi<U+017F>e would be dull
and tedious. If a Painter change colours, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay <U+017F>omtimes the very piece it <U+017F>elf, is it
becau<U+017F>e he de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed the fir<U+017F>t colour? No, but on the contrary, becau<U+017F>e he would
more enliven it, and <U+017F>hadow the fir<U+017F>t colour <U+017F>o, that he <U+017F>ets it off with greater lu<U+017F>ter
then at the fir<U+017F>t: So <hi>Thamires,</hi> when we do leave a Shepherde<U+017F>s whom we did love,
and take another, it is not as you think, becau<U+017F>e we e<U+017F>teem her more then her we
left, but only to follow the rules and dictates of Nature, which reacheth us, that it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53527:186"/>
is nothing but variety which renders the univer<U+017F>e delightful. Look upon every thing,
even from the lowe<U+017F>t to the highe<U+017F>t, and you will find, that nature has engraved
this in<U+017F>tinct and this Law, in <U+017F>uch characters as cannot be defaced. Tell me <hi>Thami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
when you lye in your bed, do you never turn from one <U+017F>ide to another? If
you do, you are incon<U+017F>tant, and <U+017F>hews want of judgement, in chu<U+017F>ing the wor<U+017F>e
<U+017F>ide at the fir<U+017F>t: when you walk, or dance; why do you change legs, but rather
hop upon the fir<U+017F>t you began with, if you will be punctual to your fir<U+017F>t beginnings?
When you <U+017F>peak, why do you not make u<U+017F>e <U+017F>till of the <U+017F>ame word? Why do Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
finger more <U+017F>trings then one? And why do they vary into <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal tunes?
I <U+017F>ee Shepherd that you laugh at what I <U+017F>ay: but believe it, I have greater rea<U+017F>on to
laugh at you, when you <U+017F>ay, that one is incon<U+017F>tant in loving <U+017F>everal Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, or
that one offends her whom he leaves.</p>
                     <p>I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Thamires,</hi> that I do laugh at the arguments which you
u<U+017F>e to maintain your fickle humour: I believe there is none in the company but does
the like, and perhaps <hi>Hylas</hi> him<U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o, if not in his face, yet in his heart: for it is
a very hard matter to forbear upon <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ubject: and I wi<U+017F>h <hi>Sylvander</hi> were here
to an<U+017F>wer (as it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary) unto your Sophi<U+017F>try: I am glad to hear, replied <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
that you call for help; it is a <U+017F>ign you think your <U+017F>elf overcome: but never be
a<U+017F>hamed of it, for though <hi>Sylvander</hi> him<U+017F>elf were here, whom you accompt your
Oracle, yet I am confident he would confe<U+017F><U+017F>e my victory, and him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ubmit unto
it: Oh <hi>Hylas!</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Thamires</hi>) you do mi<U+017F>take the rea<U+017F>on why I de<U+017F>ired <hi>Sylvanders</hi>
company; it is not becau<U+017F>e I want any arguments to an<U+017F>wer your a<U+017F><U+017F>ertions, for it is
an ea<U+017F>ie matter unto any that will take the pains: but it is becau<U+017F>e that Shepherd is
able by his <U+017F>plendent fancies, and excellent eloquence, to give this fair company bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contentment, then is my dull genius: and yet in his ab<U+017F>ence, <U+017F>ince he who is <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
unto truth, is culpable of a lye; I will briefly an<U+017F>wer you, but it <U+017F>hall be upon a
condition, that you give me leave to laugh at what you have a<U+017F><U+017F>erted: in the fir<U+017F>t
place, I confe<U+017F>s <hi>Hylas,</hi> that Husbandman to be very indi<U+017F>creet; who having found
by tryal that his ground is not proper for one <U+017F>eed, will not <U+017F>ow it with another, and
change his <U+017F>eed: but <hi>Hylas,</hi> this does not prove what you a<U+017F><U+017F>ert; for love ought
not to precede the knowledg of the party loved. The Husbandman had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
at the fir<U+017F>t of the quality of his Land, <U+017F>o as he ought not to change his <U+017F>eed till
he has found it by experience and knowledg; and therefore all tho<U+017F>e con<U+017F>equent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which you u<U+017F>ed, to change the <U+017F>ail according to the wind, and that it is
prudence to know how to comply with occa<U+017F>ions, we do agree with you, that it is
indeed high wi<U+017F>dom to be guided by, and according to the weather; and the rea<U+017F>on
is, becau<U+017F>e we cannot command the wind and the weather as we will: <U+017F>o that <hi>Hylas,</hi>
you mu<U+017F>t know, that in things which have dependency upon our <U+017F>elves, and which
are in our own power, it is a <U+017F>hame to change; but on the contrary, in tho<U+017F>e things
which depend upon the power of another, it is high prudence to know how, and
when to turn and change according to occa<U+017F>ion. Now Love, which does depend
upon the will, there is no que<U+017F>tion, but it is in our power, <U+017F>ince God did never give
us any thing which is more ab<U+017F>olutely ours, then this will; which has no matter of
chance or fortune in it, as there is in the Sea, or in the Winds. But truly your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
of Mu<U+017F>itians in changing Notes, and Painters in colours, is a very <U+017F>ubtile ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
indeed: but good <hi>Hylas,</hi> do you not know, that their fir<U+017F>t de<U+017F>igns are to
arrive at the end of their works? The Mu<U+017F>itian he de<U+017F>igns to make good Mu<U+017F>ique,
and the Painter to illu<U+017F>trate his work; and by changing Notes, and u<U+017F>ing <U+017F>everal
colours, they both arrive at their fir<U+017F>t de<U+017F>igned end: mo<U+017F>t right (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and
interrupted) and even <U+017F>o I doe never change, but with a de<U+017F>ign to arrive at the end
of my de<U+017F>ires. But, replied <hi>Thamires,</hi> Love will not allow of that, who<U+017F>e perfection
does <U+017F>o much con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in unity, as it can never be perfect until it attain unto that one
which it aymes at: and hence it is that our <hi>Druids</hi> <U+017F>ay, two per<U+017F>ons that do love,
become one and the <U+017F>ame; which is ea<U+017F>ily comprehended, <U+017F>ince both parties have
one and the <U+017F>ame will, and <U+017F>o con<U+017F>equently are one and the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on. As for
your arguments of incon<U+017F>tancy drawn from turning my <U+017F>elf in my bed, inferring it to
proceed from want of judgement in not chu<U+017F>ing the be<U+017F>t <U+017F>ide at the fir<U+017F>t; you mu<U+017F>t
know <hi>Hylas,</hi> that the body, which is heavy and <U+017F>ubject to wearine<U+017F><U+017F>e, by its own
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53527:186"/>
weight, mu<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elf by turning, that both <U+017F>ides may bear the weight alike: but
the <U+017F>oul, which is all <U+017F>pirit, is not <U+017F>ubject unto <U+017F>uch inconveniences, and therefore
ought not to change: but good <hi>Hylas,</hi> give me leave to laugh a little before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer
your argument of walking and <U+017F>peaking; <U+017F>aying, that tho<U+017F>e who walk, if they
will be con<U+017F>tant, mu<U+017F>t never go but upon one leg, and hop; or when they <U+017F>peak, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
u<U+017F>e but one word: I believe <hi>Hylas,</hi> if nature had called you to councel, when <U+017F>he
appointed to every thing their motions, perhaps you had invented <U+017F>ome other way
for men to walk, and had made hopping <U+017F>erve the turn; but <U+017F>ince you were not,
you cannot call them incon<U+017F>tant, who walk as nature ordained them, <U+017F>ince they can
do no otherwi<U+017F>e: and as for matter of <U+017F>peaking, know <hi>Hylas,</hi> that <U+017F>peaking was
given unto men, to make tho<U+017F>e who hear them, under<U+017F>tand the <U+017F>ecret conceptions
of their <U+017F>ouls: now do but invent one word, that can make to be under<U+017F>tood all
that the mind conceives; and then I will <U+017F>ay, we were incon<U+017F>tant if we u<U+017F>ed any
words but that alone: do you <U+017F>ee therefore how <U+017F>hallow all your rea<U+017F>ons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are? Certainly you mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that they are grounded upon <U+017F>and,
which is as loo<U+017F>e, and fleeting, as your incon<U+017F>tant humour is. But are you not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
plea<U+017F>ant, in <U+017F>aying, that tho<U+017F>e whom you quit for others, ought not to
lay the blame upon you, but upon their con<U+017F>tellation and their de<U+017F>tiny? It is mo<U+017F>t
true indeed, that they have rea<U+017F>on to complain again<U+017F>t their malignant influence, for
I think it a very great mi<U+017F>-fortune unto them that are troubled with your addre<U+017F><U+017F>es;
but are not you extreamly to blame in being the in<U+017F>trument of this malignant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Tell me, I be<U+017F>eech you, is not the gallows upon which a malefactor is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
a horror unto every one, and <U+017F>corned? Ah my friend, what are you unto tho<U+017F>e
poor women that are de<U+017F>tined unto your incon<U+017F>tancies, but the gallows where they
receive their puni<U+017F>hments?</p>
                     <p>At this all the company laughed a long while, and <hi>Hylas</hi> al<U+017F>o, though it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
him<U+017F>elf; and when he began to reply, he was prevented by <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> who
having met with <hi>Doris,</hi> did <U+017F>o hang upon her, that <U+017F>he could not be rid of him;
at the fir<U+017F>t he ran unto her, and kneeled before her; he would have ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her feet,
and with all humble reverence touched the hem of her garment: but <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>he went
<U+017F>till on, he would not go out of tho<U+017F>e limits, unto which he was by a kind of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
confined; he was <U+017F>o bold as to <U+017F>tay her by her gown, and would have taken
her by her arm, which cau<U+017F>ed her to cry out: and <hi>Palemon</hi> being not far off, ran in
to help her; but do what <hi>Palemon</hi> could, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> would not let his hold go: when
he pulled one hand off, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> took hold with the other: and <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> being a
big <U+017F>trong man, <hi>Palemon</hi> would hardly have ma<U+017F>tered him, but for the coming of
this company, who advancing towards them, the Shepherds took hold of <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi>
and gave <hi>Doris</hi> time to e<U+017F>cape out of his hands. The <U+017F>tate and mi<U+017F>erable condition of
this poor Shepherd, moved <hi>Dorinde</hi> to pity him: and the beauty of <hi>Doris</hi>
made her very de<U+017F>irous to know how the di<U+017F><U+017F>ention did ari<U+017F>e: <hi>Palemon</hi> as a very
civil and courteous Shepherd, <U+017F>aid unto her, be plea<U+017F>ed to know, fair <U+017F>tranger (for
<U+017F>o he thought her by her habit) that this Shepherd and I were both in love with this
Shepherde<U+017F>s, &amp; <U+017F>he being adjudged unto me, he received the <U+017F>entence <U+017F>o <U+017F>adly, that he
fell mad, and lo<U+017F>t the u<U+017F>e of rea<U+017F>on. A thou<U+017F>and pities, <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> for he <U+017F>eems
to be a Shepherd of excellent qualities: were he in the Town where I was born, I
believe, there might be found a remedy for him; for I have <U+017F>een one cured of the
<U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>o may he, e<U+017F>pecially if it be not long <U+017F>ince the mi<U+017F>-fortune did
befal him. It was not above two months <U+017F>ince (<U+017F>aid <hi>Palemon</hi>) and I am <U+017F>o excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<U+017F>orry for him, that I would do any thing which might be conducing to his
cure<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> doubtle<U+017F>s (<U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde</hi>) this will; I have had the experience of it, and
the remedy is very ea<U+017F>ie, is there not a Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in this Country? And
is there not another near unto it, dedicated unto the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>e <hi>Minerva?</hi> There is
many of them, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Thamires,</hi> which they <U+017F>ay, the Romans built; but, as for
us, we do never frequent them; becau<U+017F>e our <hi>Druids</hi> teach us, that the Maje<U+017F>ty of
the Great <hi>Tautates</hi> is <U+017F>o incomprehen<U+017F>ible, that the whole Univer<U+017F>e is only a Temple
worthy of his grandeur, which he him<U+017F>elf did build; for <U+017F>uch as are built by the
impotent hands of men, are too mean for <U+017F>uch a Divinity: and this is the rea<U+017F>on
why all our Sacrifices are offered in Sacred Groves, and under no other roof, but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53527:187"/>
the glorious Arch of Heaven. But that people whom I mentioned, had Sacrificers
which <U+017F>erved in Temples, and I think that I have <U+017F>een <U+017F>uch a one in the great City
of <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles:</hi> for the Founder did not only give it his own name, but al<U+017F>o planted
his Religion there, and I remember very well, there is al<U+017F>o another dedicated unto
<hi>Minerva,</hi> which as I think joyns unto that of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> If <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and
that you de<U+017F>ire the cure of this poor Shepherd, carry him thither, and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his cure: for there needs no more then to drive a nail which hath touched
his Pemples into the wall of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Temple, which is on that <U+017F>ide towards the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Minerva.</hi> If that be all (<U+017F>aid <hi>Palemon</hi>) I <U+017F>wear that to morrow I will neither
eat nor drink until I have driven one <U+017F>o far, as it <U+017F>hall hardly be pulled out, but by
breaking the wall. It is not you, replied <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that ought to do that ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but it mu<U+017F>t be the principal per<U+017F>on of the place. If <U+017F>o, (<U+017F>aid <hi>Palemon</hi>) I will
fall upon my knees before <hi>Ama<U+017F>is,</hi> I will be<U+017F>eech her to do that charitable Act, and
I will make a vow, that if this poor Shepherd recover, I will not deny the fir<U+017F>t thing
that <U+017F>hall be asked of me, be it made by whom it will. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> <U+017F>till
followed the company, and the place which he u<U+017F>ed to haunt very near, <hi>Palemon</hi>
entreated <hi>Doris,</hi> that <U+017F>he would either by prayers, or any other way, to make him
follow them unto <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles,</hi> whither he under<U+017F>tood all this good company was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Doris,</hi> to plea<U+017F>e him, though much again<U+017F>t the grain of her mind, went to that
poor Shepherd when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him ready to leave them. <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto
him) will you not go with me unto my hou<U+017F>e? He went nearer to her, and after
he had looked well upon her, he an<U+017F>wered, to my hou<U+017F>e do you <U+017F>ay, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> and
<hi>Doris?</hi> Yes, replied <hi>Doris,</hi> will not <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> go with <hi>Doris?</hi> To which he an<U+017F>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not a word but <hi>Doris:</hi> and turning him<U+017F>elf about, offered to go away. <hi>Doris</hi>
then calling him by his name, and he turning towards her, <U+017F>he offered her hand and
<U+017F>aid unto him; come, come, <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> do not you love <hi>Doris?</hi> He looked <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly
upon her, and <U+017F>aid not a word; and it would have pitied any one, to <U+017F>ee how
tears trickled from his eyes, though he <U+017F>miled. <hi>Doris</hi> then made him a <U+017F>econd offer
of her hand; what <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) do you not know <hi>Doris?</hi> Then he an<U+017F>wered,
<hi>Doris;</hi> yes, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I am <hi>Doris,</hi> who entreats <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes</hi> to go with her unto <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elles.</hi>
Then going to her, and taking her under the arm, he <U+017F>aid, <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles, Doris,
Adra<U+017F>tes, Palemon,</hi> and never left <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o all the way long: but <U+017F>ometimes did
weep, and <U+017F>ometimes at the very <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant laugh, and would never an<U+017F>wer unto
any que<U+017F>tion, but only the la<U+017F>t word of it.</p>
                     <p>They had already pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> and left the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Adamas</hi> on
the right hand, when they began to di<U+017F>cover <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles;</hi> and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Hylas</hi> was
very <U+017F>orry that he could not know the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Dorindes</hi> coming into Forre<U+017F>ts; it is
a hard ca<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid he) that <U+017F>ome fooli<U+017F>h accident or other does always prevent me
in my de<U+017F>ires; what fooli<U+017F>h accident do you complain of, <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> which has
prevented you in your de<U+017F>ires? Two things, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> I do complain of,
and they are very different; the one is, that <hi>Thamires</hi> and I have talked <U+017F>o long: &amp; the
other is, that <hi>Adrastes</hi> hath made us lo<U+017F>e that time which I de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>pent in
hearing what has hapned unto you <U+017F>ince la<U+017F>t I <U+017F>aw you. If that be al, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
to content you, we <U+017F>hal remedy it when you plea<U+017F>e: the<U+017F>e promi<U+017F>es are ea<U+017F>ily made,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but often fail in performance; hold me for a per<U+017F>on very uncivil, <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
if I do not give you <U+017F>atisfaction in a thing which I may with <U+017F>o much ea<U+017F>e perform;
I believe you to be civil enough, replied <hi>Hylas,</hi> but I cannot tell whether your lei<U+017F>ure
and your will can permit it: as for matter of will, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Dorinde,</hi> it <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>tick
upon that; and as for lei<U+017F>ure, I believe, that at night when we have nothing el<U+017F>e to
do, we may have as good an opportunity as can be de<U+017F>ired. But pray, why have
you not as great a de<U+017F>ire to know the adventures of <hi>Florice,</hi> of <hi>Palinice,</hi> and <hi>Cerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi>
as well as mine? Is it becau<U+017F>e you already know them? There is a hidden mi<U+017F>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in that, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas,</hi> and the truth is, I do not know them; but I do very
much wonder, now I think on it, that I <U+017F>hould never have that de<U+017F>ire; then turning
towards them, but good (in the dayes of old) Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es, tell me, why you did not pay
that tribute which was due unto my curio<U+017F>ity and de<U+017F>ire? We do an<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>aid <hi>Florice,</hi>
that neither you nor we had any will thereunto; but yet there is a rea<U+017F>on which is
better, and which proceeds from a cau<U+017F>e more high; for Heaven did forbid us:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53527:187"/>
How, how? <U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas,</hi> have you <U+017F>uch familiar conver<U+017F>ation with Heaven? I do
not wonder now I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o retire my <U+017F>elf from you, <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>o cele<U+017F>tial: you
mu<U+017F>t not now be loved, but adored as heavenly beauties. <hi>Hylas,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea,</hi> you
now <U+017F>peak like unto your <U+017F>elf, who being one of tho<U+017F>e <hi>Gallo-Ligurians,</hi> which retain

do not de<U+017F>ire to be adored. Oh <hi>Cercinea</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) I perceive your cele<U+017F>tial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ation
with Heaven; and your intimate familiarity with Angels, has made you
<U+017F>o divine, that now there is no coming near you: you do not talk now like <hi>Cercinea,</hi>
but like a Sarronide, an Eubages, a Prophete<U+017F>s, a cele<U+017F>tial <hi>Druide.</hi> God keep me
from loving you, <U+017F>ince you are learned; for when I begin to talk unto you of my
affection, in lieu of an<U+017F>wering, you will reprove me for not <U+017F>peaking well: and God
knows how extreamly a<U+017F>hamed <U+017F>hould I be to receive correction at this age. Then
turning towards <hi>Florice,</hi> but pray tell me in good earne<U+017F>t (<U+017F>aid he) how comes it to
pa<U+017F><U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould never know the cau<U+017F>e of your coming into this Country? Becau<U+017F>e (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Florice</hi>) we would not tell it unto any, being <U+017F>o enjoyned by the Oracle,
which did forbid us to <U+017F>peak of it, until a thing come to pa<U+017F>s which is not yet hapned.
Now I do <U+017F>ee (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hylas</hi>) that heaven is better to me then I de<U+017F>erve, <U+017F>ince I am not
afflicted with any de<U+017F>ires of a thing that would have been long before the effect
would be obtained. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> why might not I have <U+017F>atisfied this de<U+017F>ire,
for I do know all their adventures, almo<U+017F>t as well as them<U+017F>elves, and heaven has not
forbidden me to tell them? Were we not <U+017F>o neer the place unto which we go, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Lycidas,</hi> I <U+017F>hould humbly entreat that you would be plea<U+017F>ed to take <U+017F>o much pains;
for I believe there is not a <U+017F>tranger upon the Banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> who hath <U+017F>o long
concealed the cau<U+017F>e of their journey, as the<U+017F>e three fair ones have: It <U+017F>eems <U+017F>aid
<hi>Hylas,</hi> that they have extreamly offended the Gods. Why? <U+017F>aid <hi>Cercinea.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
(an<U+017F>wered <hi>Hylas</hi>) the greate<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hment that heaven can lay upon a woman, is
to be <U+017F>ilent. If it be <U+017F>o (an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he) heaven has been very favourable to us, in
giving us occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>hew our <U+017F>elves more then women.</p>
                     <p>Such di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e as this beguiled the length of the way; and when they were come
to the gates of <hi>Mar<U+017F>elles, Periander, Merindor,</hi> and their companions asked <hi>Dorinde</hi>
if <U+017F>he intended to do her obey<U+017F>ance unto <hi>Ama<U+017F>is</hi> that <U+017F>ame night; and where <U+017F>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to lodge if <U+017F>he did not. To whom <hi>Dorinde</hi> an<U+017F>wered, that it was very late,
and that all the company was too weary to go <U+017F>o high as the Ca<U+017F>tle, which <U+017F>tood upon
the top of a <U+017F>teep hill; but yet <U+017F>he knew not where to lodge el<U+017F>e-where, having
no acquaintance in the place: <hi>Lycidas</hi> upon this be-thinking him<U+017F>elf; I be<U+017F>eech you
(<U+017F>aid he) give me leave to go before you into the Town, and if he whom I hope to
find in it be there, I am confident your reception will not be bad. <hi>Dorinde</hi> thanked
him; and <U+017F>itting down under a <U+017F>hade neer the High-way, <U+017F>he told him, that <U+017F>he and
the company would expect his return in that place. Upon this <hi>Lycidas</hi> with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Corilas,</hi> went into the Town, and went as fa<U+017F>t as they could unto the hou<U+017F>e
of <hi>Clindor,</hi> the dear friend of <hi>Alcippes,</hi> the father of <hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>Lycidas,</hi> This
<hi>Clindor</hi> has <U+017F>till in memory the affection which he bore unto their father, and <U+017F>ince
the death of <hi>Alcippes</hi> and <hi>Celadon,</hi> all his good will was placed upon <hi>Lycidas,</hi> as all
that was left unto him of his dear friend; and therefore as <U+017F>oon as ever he <U+017F>aw him,
he held out his arms of love to embrace him, and <U+017F>hewed as much entire affection, as
if he had been his own <U+017F>on. Father, <U+017F>aid <hi>Lycidas</hi> unto him, for <U+017F>o he called him;
if I have been backward in rendring that duty which I owe unto you, I be<U+017F>eech you
lay the blame upon the rural woods, which will hardly permit their inhabitants to
frequent great Cities, without offence unto the Laws of their <U+017F>olitary lives. Son,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Clindor,</hi> I do both excu<U+017F>e and envie you: I excu<U+017F>e you, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Alcippes</hi> did all

accompanied me hither, though I did not know whether it would be thought too

great a trouble: Son, <U+017F>aid <hi>Clindor</hi> with a <U+017F>miling countenance, tho<U+017F>e who do come

power in it as my <U+017F>elf; the trouble that will be, will be only unto them, but much
honour and contentment unto me: and then hearing who tho<U+017F>e were whom he
brought with him; I am very <U+017F>orry <U+017F>aid he, that I had no <U+017F>ooner notice: but <U+017F>ince

I would have waited upon them my <U+017F>elf.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Lycidas</hi> with <hi>Leontidas</hi> went unto the company which expected him, who
after many complements of civility, <hi>Leontidas</hi> took <hi>Dorinde</hi> by one arm, and <hi>Hylas</hi>
took her by the other; when they came to the gates, the guards asked them who
they were, and from whence they came? The three Cavaliers told them their names,
and <U+017F>atisfied their demands; and <hi>Leontidas</hi> added, that they were going to the hou<U+017F>e

becau<U+017F>e it was but according to their duty and commands received from their
<U+017F>uperiour Officers. Thus they entred, and were conducted unto the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
who received them with <U+017F>o kind a countenance, and treated them <U+017F>o nobly, as
every one admired he <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>et his hou<U+017F>e in <U+017F>uch excellent order as they

                     <p>In the mean time the <U+017F>ad <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who after he had left <hi>Dorinde</hi> and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
was retired into the thicke<U+017F>t woods, where he could lea<U+017F>t be <U+017F>een, and there
pa<U+017F>t away the re<U+017F>t of the day with his own melancholy and mortal thoughts, till at
night he came to the place where <hi>Diana, Alexis, A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> found him reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
He did <U+017F>o avoid the <U+017F>ight of every one, that he knew not what had hapned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Dorinde;</hi> for as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>aw any, he <U+017F>hunned them like a <U+017F>avage per<U+017F>on. His
<U+017F>ad melancholy retained him in this place until it was night; but when he <U+017F>aw the
canopy of heaven <U+017F>pangled with gli<U+017F>tering <U+017F>tars, and thought that none was abroad,
he went out; not with any de<U+017F>igne of diverting him<U+017F>elf, but only to re<U+017F>ent his <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
more apprehen<U+017F>ively, and that his <U+017F>orrows might the <U+017F>ooner do that which his
hand dur<U+017F>t not again<U+017F>t his life, le<U+017F>t heaven <U+017F>hould be offended if he gave him<U+017F>elf a
violent death.</p>
                     <p>This thought did in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly conduct him unto the place where <hi>Phillis</hi> delivered the
cruel me<U+017F><U+017F>age from <hi>Diana</hi> unto him: Oh mo<U+017F>t fatal place (<U+017F>aid he) and mo<U+017F>t infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for the highe<U+017F>t piece of inju<U+017F>tice that ever was committed upon the Banks of
<hi>Lignon:</hi> Oh thou mo<U+017F>t abominable and and odious piece of ground! I do wonder
Heaven does not cau<U+017F>e the earth to open, and <U+017F>wallow thee in her deep Aby<U+017F>s, and
never <U+017F>uffer thee to be <U+017F>ooting for any innocent Shepherd to tread upon again.</p>
                     <p>Then folding his arms one within another, he continued; But if heaven will needs
pur<U+017F>ue me with a perpetual hatred, as it hath done ever <U+017F>ince that cur<U+017F>ed day on
which I was born, why does it not execute and compleat its cruel de<U+017F>tinies upon me?
Should I wi<U+017F>h all places where I have re<U+017F>ented the unju<U+017F>t malignity of its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be Aby<U+017F><U+017F>es; Alas, then all places where-ever I did <U+017F>et my foot, mu<U+017F>t be
<U+017F>wallowed up into the profundity of the earth. Then coming to the place where
he fell into a <U+017F>woon, he <U+017F>topped <U+017F>hort, and looked long <U+017F>ilently upon it; at la<U+017F>t he
began again, 'Twas here (<U+017F>aid he) where my di<U+017F>a<U+017F>terous cogitations did mu<U+017F>ter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
to overwhelm me; but how comes it to pa<U+017F>s I did endure them and not die?
And is not heaven a<U+017F>hamed to <U+017F>ee it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>urmounted by the con<U+017F>tancy of a mortal?
It is not more <U+017F>trange, to <U+017F>ee how ob<U+017F>tinate the De<U+017F>tinies are in rendring me mi<U+017F>era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then it is to <U+017F>ee the in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility of my <U+017F>oul, in <U+017F>upporting their blows. But upon
good con<U+017F>ideration I needs mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ay, that heaven will either try what power it has in
tormenting, or what courage I have in <U+017F>uffering. But faire<U+017F>t <hi>Diana,</hi> mu<U+017F>t you needs
be the in<U+017F>trument of <U+017F>o many cruelties? Can your beauty ever con<U+017F>ent unto the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of him that adores you? What excu<U+017F>e can you alledge for your <U+017F>elf? You are
either the partner in this fault, or at lea<U+017F>t the cau<U+017F>e and the original; for it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
I <U+017F>hould love any but <hi>Diana,</hi> as it is for <hi>Diana</hi> to live, and not be the faire<U+017F>t
in the whole world; and as long as I live, the mo<U+017F>t loved Shepherde<U+017F>s upon earth.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53527:188"/>
But alas, alas, you look for no excu<U+017F>e where you cannot repent of the fault: or to
<U+017F>ay better, where repentance would be a thou<U+017F>and times greater <U+017F>atisfaction, then
the wrong.</p>
                     <p>Then <U+017F>tanding a while <U+017F>ilent, and the moon <U+017F>hining very clear, he went looking
and <U+017F>taring upon every thing about him, like a man that was di<U+017F>tracted, and hardly
knew what it was that he did look upon: at la<U+017F>t, the cruel di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and the
opinion which <hi>Diana</hi> had of his change, coming into his mind, he could not chu<U+017F>e
but cry out: Oh God! Oh Heavens! Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that the judgment of <hi>Diana,</hi>
which is <U+017F>o sound and quick in all other things, <U+017F>hould to my mi<U+017F>ery, be thus mi<U+017F>taken?
Can <U+017F>he think <hi>Madonthe</hi> has any power to divert me from her, and her <U+017F>ervice?
Could that Wi<U+017F>e, Prudent, and Solid Shepherde<U+017F>s believe, that tho<U+017F>e eyes which have
her<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> can look upon any other eyes but hers? Have I; Oh Faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F>s, by
any of my actions, given any te<U+017F>timony that I become a <hi>Hylas</hi> or an <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes?</hi> For
before I commit <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>in, I mu<U+017F>t needs be either one, or both; and I could not be
<U+017F>o incon<U+017F>tant unle<U+017F>s I were a fool, or a mad man.</p>
                     <p>This thought entertained him a long time, and would not let him depart from that
place, he thought to have found that contentment which he had loft: but on the
contrary, he met <U+017F>till with fre<U+017F>h cau<U+017F>es of grief; for wandering in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly from one
thought to another, he began to think upon the <U+017F>weet beginnings of his affection,
and with what di<U+017F>cretion <hi>Diana</hi> received the fir<U+017F>t buds of his love, under the notion
of a wager; with what kindne<U+017F>s <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffered that plant to take root, and how pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<U+017F>he <U+017F>aw it grow up to that grandeur which now is arrived at. And as conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants
of this thought, he <U+017F>et before his eyes the plea<U+017F>ant jars of <hi>Phillis,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
an<U+017F>wers of his Shepherde<U+017F>s; and briefly, all tho<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons which he had to
hope, that his affection would thrive, and grow fruitfull. Then did he bethink
him<U+017F>elf of that Bracelet of hair, which was intended for <hi>Phillis,</hi> and which he had
obtained of <hi>Diana,</hi> as an extraordinary favour. He guided his hand to the place
where he was wont to wear it, thinking to have the contentment of a ki<U+017F>s from it:
but not finding it, he looked upon the other arm: but not finding it on either, he
was <U+017F>urprized with <U+017F>o much grief, as not being able to endure the blow of that di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<U+017F>ter,
he fell to the ground, and <U+017F>o lay a long time without either motion or <U+017F>peech;
but at la<U+017F>t he revived, and concluded that now all hope was gone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sylvander</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner cea<U+017F>ed his complaints, but (as he thought) he heard
<U+017F>ome coming towards him; and to know who they were, and al<U+017F>o out of fear to be
<U+017F>een, le<U+017F>t by that means he <U+017F>hould be interrupted in his <U+017F>olitary thoughts, he kept
<U+017F>till clo<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ilent; then did he plainly hear <U+017F>ome coming and talking very loud,
but not <U+017F>o as he could under<U+017F>tand them at that di<U+017F>tance<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> yet <U+017F>till keeping <U+017F>ilence,
and they drawing neerer, he perceived by the help of the Moon, that they were
two men talking together: and when they were clo<U+017F>e by the place where <hi>Sylvander</hi>
<U+017F>tood, they <U+017F>topt a little; then did he hear one of them begin to <U+017F>ing, and the effect
of his <U+017F>ong was, <hi>That he had more love, then <U+017F>he had cruelty.</hi> He had no <U+017F>ooner done,
but the other began; and the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of his <U+017F>ong was, <hi>That he ought to love her for
no other end but to love her.</hi> Ah Brother, (<U+017F>aid the fir<U+017F>t, and interrupted the other)
you are in the right; for who<U+017F>oever does love for any other end but loving only, he
does abu<U+017F>e the name of love, and mo<U+017F>t unworthily pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ane that pure and Sacred
Divinity. But give me leave to tell you<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that in what you alledged before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the torments which you and I do <U+017F>uffer, you have as little rea<U+017F>on, as I have
much, to <U+017F>ay, that there is no torment in the world that is equal unto mine. Brother,
(an<U+017F>wered the other with a deep <U+017F>igh) that love which every one doth bear unto
him<U+017F>elf, is the cau<U+017F>e of that judgment: for when you <U+017F>ee me <U+017F>uffer any pain, do
you not re<U+017F>ent it more then any <U+017F>tranger would? Doubtle<U+017F>s I do (an<U+017F>wered the fir<U+017F>t)
Then <hi>Alcander,</hi> replied the other, the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on which makes you re<U+017F>ent my pain
more then another, does make you re<U+017F>ent your own more then mine: for as it is
natural to love a brother more then a <U+017F>tranger, <U+017F>o it is as natural to love ones <U+017F>elf
more then any el<U+017F>e: it is love which gives the weight unto all things which fall under
opinion. I do not know <hi>Amilcar</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) how you intend this? It is true that
I am partly in the <U+017F>ame belief, and partly not; I mean, that it is love which doth
cau<U+017F>e re<U+017F>entment of <U+017F>orrows and joyes, and that it is by it, and its ell, we do mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53527:189"/>
the greatne<U+017F>s or the littlene<U+017F>s of all things: but that every one does love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
more then <U+017F>ome others: Indeed brother, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, that if this be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of nature, then nature has failed in me: for I do prote<U+017F>t and vow, that I do
love <hi>Circinca,</hi> a thou<U+017F>and times better then I do my <U+017F>elf; and it is an ea<U+017F>ie matter to
make this evident, <U+017F>ince I do find in my <U+017F>elf towards her, all the effects which a
mo<U+017F>t extream love can produce: for fir<U+017F>t, I had rather any evil <U+017F>hould fall upon my
<U+017F>elf, then the lea<U+017F>t upon her: and I de<U+017F>ire her contentment infinitely above my own;
there is nothing, be it never <U+017F>o full of difficulty, but I would attempt it, if there was
any hopes it would conduce thereunto: If any thing that plea<U+017F>ed me, di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed her,
believe it, <hi>Amilcar,</hi> I had rather dye then receive it: and if the<U+017F>e be not infallible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that I do love another better then my <U+017F>elf, I know not what are. Brother,
replied <hi>Amilcar,</hi> I do re<U+017F>ent the very <U+017F>ame effects of affection unto <hi>Palinice,</hi> which
you do unto <hi>Circinea:</hi> but oh <hi>Alcander,</hi> you are much mi<U+017F>taken if you do conclude
thereby, that you do love <hi>Circinea</hi> better then your <U+017F>elf, or that I do love <hi>Palinice,</hi>
more then I do my <U+017F>elf. For if we will but ingeniou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F>s, it is the love of our
<U+017F>elves that makes us love them: and as the mi<U+017F>er does expo<U+017F>e his life for the pre<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Gold which he loves; <U+017F>o do we Sacrifice our <U+017F>elves to the plea<U+017F>ure of
tho<U+017F>e fair ones whom we adore: Fie, fie Brother, replied <hi>Alcander,</hi> will you offer
<U+017F>uch a wrong unto our loves, as to compare them unto a mi<U+017F>ers love of Gold? A<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
your <U+017F>elf brother (<U+017F>aid <hi>Amilcar</hi> <U+017F>oberly) there is no difference betwixt them,
only the love that we do give unto the<U+017F>e fair ones, is for a thing of greater value and
merit, and therefore it is more noble and rea<U+017F>onable: but the very truth is, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of all loves, is <U+017F>elf love: does not the mi<U+017F>ers care to pre<U+017F>erve his dearly beloved
Gold, proceed from the love of him<U+017F>elf, and not his Gold? Doubtle<U+017F>s it does; for
what cares the gold into who<U+017F>e hands it fals, <U+017F>ince where<U+017F>oever it is, it is <U+017F>till Gold
as well as in his hands. Then let us apply this rea<U+017F>on unto our <U+017F>elves, and you will
find that it is the love which you hear unto your <U+017F>elf, which makes you have all tho<U+017F>e
cares of <hi>Circinea,</hi> and all tho<U+017F>e earne<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ires of her contentment: would you wi<U+017F>h
her <U+017F>o much happine<U+017F><U+017F>e, and endeavour to procure it unto her, upon condition <U+017F>he
<U+017F>hould extreamly love <hi>Clorian,</hi> and devote her <U+017F>elf wholly unto him, without ever
caring for you? But did <U+017F>he love <hi>Clorian,</hi> replied <hi>Alcander,</hi> <U+017F>he would not be <U+017F>o
happy as you <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e her. But <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be as happy (<U+017F>aid <hi>Amiliar</hi>)
would you wi<U+017F>h her the enjoyment of all tho<U+017F>e contentments with <hi>Clorian?</hi> I <U+017F>ee
you will not an<U+017F>wer, nor have you any rea<U+017F>on; but I will an<U+017F>wer for you: it is mo<U+017F>t
certain, that you and I had rather <U+017F>ee the grim face of death, then to <U+017F>ee your <hi>Circi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>
happy with <hi>Clorian;</hi> and I to <U+017F>ee my <hi>Palinice,</hi> the happy wife of <hi>Sileines:</hi> and
therefore let us both ingeniou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, that all the happine<U+017F><U+017F>e which we do wi<U+017F>h
unto them, is but like the love of a Mi<U+017F>er to his Gold; that is, for our own
particular intere<U+017F>t: though the exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of our pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions makes us think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers continued on their walk, and for a while were <U+017F>ilent.
<hi>Sylvander</hi> who heard them, and thought them to be per<U+017F>ons of merit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding
had a good mind to be talking with them, had it not been for the <U+017F>curvy
humour, into which the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Diana</hi> had put him: but con<U+017F>idering this vexing
humour, he thought it better to be as he was, then interrupt them: and therefore,
he de<U+017F>igned to go away: but as he was going, he <U+017F>aw the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers turn back, as
men that knew not which way to go; but having found that walk, would pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away
the re<U+017F>t of the night in it. His fears to be <U+017F>een, cau<U+017F>ed him to keep clo<U+017F>e till they
were pa<U+017F>t, and afterwards to fall into the thick of the Wood. But whether he made
<U+017F>ome noi<U+017F>e, as he couched down, or whether the Moon <U+017F>hined clearer then it did
when they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by before, I know not: but <hi>Alcander</hi> <U+017F>pied him, and <U+017F>hewed him
to his brother, who <U+017F>tepping nearer, certainly (<U+017F>aid he) it is a Shepherd who is a
<U+017F>leep. <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who <U+017F>eeing him<U+017F>elf di<U+017F>covered, and who thought that they would
not go away before they made him <U+017F>peak; he thought al<U+017F>o that it was better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them: and therefore, he an<U+017F>wered, if I do <U+017F>leep, then it may be <U+017F>aid, that a
man may <U+017F>leep and not re<U+017F>t; for the mi<U+017F>erable condition wherein I am, will not
let me enjoy any: do not think <hi>Amilcar</hi> (continued he, and ro<U+017F>e up) that it is any
love which I bear unto my <U+017F>elf, makes me judge my mi<U+017F>ery unequalled; for <U+017F>hould
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53527:189"/>
I judge by pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon that which relates unto me, it would be rather by hatred
then love, <U+017F>ince I am able to <U+017F>ay, and <U+017F>ay truly, that I never wi<U+017F>hed any <U+017F>o much
harm as I do unto my <U+017F>elf. And though the mi<U+017F>ery which I endure, be as much as
any mortal man can endure, yet am I <U+017F>o much my own enemy, that my hatred can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <U+017F>atisfied, unle<U+017F>s by wi<U+017F>hing my mi<U+017F>eries multiplied above the number of all the
leaves in this Wood. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid <hi>Amilcar,</hi> that if your condition be as bad
as you <U+017F>peak it, all <U+017F>orrows mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubmit unto yours. Oh <hi>Amilcar,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
it is but too true, and did you but know my wounds, you would confe<U+017F>s it al<U+017F>o; but
becau<U+017F>e it would be <U+017F>ome kind of comfort to tell it, I will not give my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o much
contentment. It <U+017F>eems (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alcander</hi>) that the greatne<U+017F>s of your mi<U+017F>ery hath dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you into de<U+017F>pair, and you know de<U+017F>pair argues but little knowledge, and little
courage: I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid the Shepherd, that my mi<U+017F>ery is changed into de<U+017F>pair,
but I do deny that de<U+017F>pair, is alwaies from want of knowledge or courage; for were
it not a <U+017F>trange ignorance to have <U+017F>uch extream misfortunes as I have, and not to
know them? And would it not argue a great defect of courage, and re<U+017F>entment, to
<U+017F>tand in <U+017F>uch fear of death, as to wi<U+017F>h, living in <U+017F>uch mi<U+017F>ery? This may pa<U+017F>s among<U+017F>t
petty and trivial mi<U+017F>chances and mi<U+017F>eries, <U+017F>uch as are common and ordinary; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
<U+017F>uch as are grown to that height, as there is no remedy, nor no cure, it is a
folly, a madne<U+017F>s, an argument of a poor low courage, to endure the <U+017F>hame which
cannot be avoided by any way but by being no more, However replied <hi>Alcander,</hi>
it is an argument of a faint and poor courage, to want a heart that will endure the
blows of an enemy. Mo<U+017F>t true, replied the Shepherd, but there is no rea<U+017F>on to
hope for a thing which there is no hopes to obtain, and thereupon I <U+017F>ay it is, that my
mi<U+017F>ery is de<U+017F>perate; not that I do conclude thereby, that I will run a <U+017F>word into my
brea<U+017F>t to kill my <U+017F>elf, or throw my <U+017F>elf head long down a precipice: <U+017F>uch an act would
argue a defect in courage; nay wor<U+017F>e, it is a great impiety and <U+017F>in committed again<U+017F>t
the great <hi>Tautates;</hi> for man being the workman<U+017F>hip of his hands, it were a mo<U+017F>t
horrid <U+017F>in to de<U+017F>troy what he hath made; He, as the Potter with his pot, may do
what he will with us: and we were made to be as he will have us, and not to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e
of our <U+017F>elves according to our own will; if it be his plea<U+017F>ure we <U+017F>hould endure pain
and abundance of mi<U+017F>ery, we mu<U+017F>t endure, and not endeavour to cro<U+017F>s his will by
any <U+017F>udden death: but I begin to re<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ome mittigation of my <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s by this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
which I have had, and therefore, becau<U+017F>e I will not do my mi<U+017F>eries <U+017F>o much
wrong, I do conjure you <hi>Amilcar,</hi> by your love unto <hi>Palinice,</hi> and you <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
by yours unto <hi>Circinea,</hi> that you let me go and retire my <U+017F>elf into the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
parts of this wood; and in requital I will tell you (that if you <U+017F>eek for tho<U+017F>e
two fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es) where you may find them; and that is, where I have often
<U+017F>een them upon the banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> in the company of the fair <hi>Diana, Astrea,</hi> and
their companions: upon this, he <U+017F>aluted them, and went into the Wood as fa<U+017F>t as he
could, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be followed by the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trangers.</p>
                     <p>They on the other <U+017F>ide ravi<U+017F>hed to hear <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e come from a Shepherd,
they were <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, as they could not <U+017F>tir a foot after him; But having held their
eyes a while upon the place where he entred into the Wood; <hi>Alcander</hi> broke <U+017F>ilence
fir<U+017F>t: Brother, <U+017F>aid he, did you ever hear <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>hepherd? His habit indeed, <U+017F>aid <hi>Amilcar</hi>
does <U+017F>peak him Shepherd, but not his tongue: for my part <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcander,</hi> I think him to
be the good Genius of <hi>Lignon</hi> who pre<U+017F>ented him<U+017F>elf unto us in that habit, to <U+017F>hew us,
that there are <U+017F>ome who are in greater mi<U+017F>ery then we are. Perhaps, replied <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi>
I <U+017F>hould have been of the <U+017F>ame opinion, if we had been in any Country but
Forre<U+017F>ts, where I have heard there are <U+017F>o many di<U+017F>creet and well accompli<U+017F>hed
Shepherds, as the encounter <U+017F>eems not <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange unto me. If he be a Shepherd,
continued <hi>Alcander,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t like him, it mu<U+017F>t needs be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that Cities
have rea<U+017F>on to envie the<U+017F>e Woods and <U+017F>olitary places; but <U+017F>aid he, and pointed at
a paper which lay in the place where they fir<U+017F>t found <hi>Sylvander,</hi> I do <U+017F>ee a thing like
a letter, and perhaps the Moon will give us light to read it. <hi>Amilcar</hi> upon this took
up a paper which <hi>Sylvander</hi> accidentally dropt, in which were writ a copie of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
importing, <hi>That <U+017F>he, <U+017F>he only is worthy of her <U+017F>elf.</hi> It is certain, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alcander,</hi>
that he is a Shepherd, and not the Genius of this place; but it mu<U+017F>t needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that the<U+017F>e Woods are extreamly happy in having <U+017F>uch gue<U+017F>ts.</p>

But <hi>Alexis</hi> in the mean time who lay according to her cu<U+017F>tome in <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> al<U+017F>o lay, <U+017F>he was up as early as the Sun, and taking
the clothes of the fair <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> <U+017F>he dre<U+017F>t her <U+017F>elf as <U+017F>oon, and with as little noi<U+017F>e as

was half turned towards her bed-fellows, and the weather being very hot, part of

having a while contemplated, Alas (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he in a low voice, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be heard)
Ah <hi>Alexis!</hi> why art not thou metamorpho<U+017F>ed into <hi>Diana,</hi> or <hi>Diana</hi> into <hi>Alexis?</hi>
But mi<U+017F>erable wretch that thou art, why <U+017F>uch a wi<U+017F>h, <U+017F>ince <hi>Celadon</hi> then is to have

can<U+017F>t thou have any felicity with him, or any happine<U+017F>s without her? No,

<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was in a dream, and waked upon it; for turning towards <hi>Alexis,</hi> Ah <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi>
(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he with a deep <U+017F>igh) and <U+017F>aying no more, <U+017F>he fell a<U+017F>leep again. <hi>Diana</hi>
and <hi>Phillis,</hi> hearing her name <hi>Celadon,</hi> they were very attentive to hear what <U+017F>he
would <U+017F>ay farther: <hi>Alexis,</hi> though <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed at the hearing of him<U+017F>elf named, yet

<U+017F>poke no more; but perceiving that <hi>Diana</hi> ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her, <U+017F>he waked, in an opinion that
it was <hi>Alexis:</hi> Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you are very early, and her eyes being yet not well

<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, you have deceived me, for I took you for my dear Mi<U+017F>tris, Servant, <U+017F>aid
the <hi>Druide</hi> then, I am not <U+017F>o far off, but you may ea<U+017F>ily repair that mi<U+017F>take if you

<U+017F>aw how di<U+017F>dainfully <U+017F>he had repul<U+017F>ed <hi>Diana</hi>) you reject the ki<U+017F><U+017F>es of tho<U+017F>e lips, which
<U+017F>ome other perhaps would <U+017F>ooner chu<U+017F>e then yours. Certainly, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> they are
out of their wits who makes <U+017F>o bad a choi<U+017F>e. You may <U+017F>ay what you plea<U+017F>e, replied
<hi>Phillis,</hi> but I believe there are <U+017F>ome that are of my opinion, and that is <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
whom I believe you do not think to be out of his wits, unle<U+017F>s it be in one thing;
what is that? <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> in loving too much, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> for in that indeed
he is in the exce<U+017F><U+017F>e. What Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> all in one <U+017F>ong? Will you <U+017F>peak of
nothing but <hi>Sylvander, Sylvander</hi> <U+017F>till? Are you not weary with naming him <U+017F>o oft?
Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> re<U+017F>olve upon one thing; that I will never let you re<U+017F>t, until you
be reconciled unto him, and he in your favour as formerly he was wont to be: and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53527:190"/>
I believe it is the part of all your friends to do the like: for if you <U+017F>hould lo<U+017F>e that
kind Shepherd, I do not think <hi>Lignon</hi> will ever have his like: good Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <hi>Diana</hi>)
what you do think of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> is not he above him? <hi>Lycidas,</hi> (replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> after
her accu<U+017F>tomed jollity) is good for nothing but for me; and I <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry
any <U+017F>hould envy me: but <hi>Sylvander</hi> is <U+017F>uch a one, as not only you and we, who are
ordinarily with him, but al<U+017F>o all this Country, nay perhaps all the <hi>Gaules,</hi> have an
intere<U+017F>t in him. Good Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> <U+017F>hall I be payed out of the publique ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
for having a care of him, in whom <U+017F>o many have a <U+017F>hare? You ought (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>Phillis</hi>) <U+017F>ince you have all the power; and if he mi<U+017F>carry, every one will
blame you; and though he be all yours, yet ought you not to envy, that every
one <U+017F>hould receive contentment from that which you have. I am <U+017F>o far from any
envy, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> that if he be mine, I will give him unto you with all my
heart; and with a promi<U+017F>e never to ask him again. Oh mo<U+017F>t cruel woman, (cryed
out <hi>Phillis</hi>) the Gods will puni<U+017F>h you for this ingratitude, and as they u<U+017F>ually do,
in the <U+017F>ame manner that you offend. And remember this that I now foretel you,
with as much truth as if it came from the mouth of an Oracle. Good Si<U+017F>ter, replied
<hi>Diana,</hi> what is it that you do tell me? that the Gods will puni<U+017F>h me for that which
I intend to do? Is it a <U+017F>in to give you that which is mine? Though I had not given
him unto you, yet <U+017F>till he had been yours; for all that I had, was long <U+017F>ince <U+017F>o. Fie,
fie, <hi>Diana,</hi> replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> the<U+017F>e cruelties that are covered with a cloak of kindne<U+017F><U+017F>e,
are not unknown to the Gods: you cannot <U+017F>o gild them over, but they will find
them to be counterfet <U+017F>tuf, and con<U+017F>ider that I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee you weep for it; and when
that time comes, I will laugh at you, for not believing me when I was in the right.
Indeed Si<U+017F>ter, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> very <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly, you are extreamly unkind; you
<U+017F>hould rather provide for me good <U+017F>tore of handkerchiefs before hand, to dry up

out of bed, <U+017F>he turned to <hi>Phillis,</hi> and <U+017F>aid unto her, me thinks Si<U+017F>ter that though

Do not think, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that my anger is <U+017F>o great as to make me fail in that

not command you any things that are either impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible or grievous, I pray let us
find you in the <U+017F>ame place at our return, where we leave you at our going away,
and in the mean time, that you may have no excu<U+017F>e for your ab<U+017F>ence, we will take
care of your flock: <U+017F>o bidding them good morrow, they went out of the chamber,
and went talking upon <U+017F>everal <U+017F>ubjects: and <hi>Diana</hi> being in a little better opinion of
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> then <U+017F>he was, <U+017F>he began to be in her good humour again.</p>
                     <p>Being then going out of <hi>A<U+017F>treas</hi> hou<U+017F>e, <hi>Phillis</hi> who was <U+017F>ilent a while, did make

where they thought to find no Shepherds <U+017F>tirring, becau<U+017F>e it was very early; but
when they came into a long walk, they <U+017F>aw at the other end a Shepherd and a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde<U+017F><U+017F>e,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Tircis</hi> went back two or three paces, and folding his arms, <U+017F>tood looking upon her
with admiration, and <U+017F>poke not a word. At la<U+017F>t, he asked her what <U+017F>he had done
unto <hi>Sylvander?</hi> What have I done? an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he; why I have given him <U+017F>uch a
blow, that a Chirurgion will hardly <U+017F>alve up his <U+017F>ore; for I <U+017F>ee, as good a face as
<hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>ets upon it, the pain of it does reach his heart. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis,</hi> what do
you tell me of pains of heart, or of <hi>Diana?</hi> I ask you what you have done unto
<hi>Sylvander?</hi> You are very inqui<U+017F>itive, replied <hi>Laonice,</hi> and to <U+017F>atisfie you this is
enough, That I am <U+017F>o well <U+017F>atisfied in my revenge, that I will not now <U+017F>tay a minute
longer in this Country where I have received the<U+017F>e two contentments: The one is,
the jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Lycidas</hi> again<U+017F>t <hi>Phillis;</hi> and the other, of <hi>Diana</hi> again<U+017F>t <hi>Sylvander.</hi>
But replied <hi>Tircis,</hi> How can <hi>Diana</hi> be jealous of <hi>Sylvander,</hi> if <U+017F>he do not care for
him; and if <hi>Sylvander</hi> did never look upon any in the way of Love? Oh <hi>Tircis,</hi>
replied <hi>Laonice,</hi> if their love or their hatred would have been advantagious unto
you, as they are unto me, you would have ob<U+017F>erved them better then you have.
You think (<U+017F>aid <hi>Tircis</hi>) that all their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of Love did proceed from affection:
But do you not know them to be only in je<U+017F>t, and cau<U+017F>ed by a wager betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi>
and him? Ah Shepherd, <U+017F>aid <hi>Laonice</hi> and <U+017F>miled, I perceive that you are one of
tho<U+017F>e that believe all that is reported. But my good friend <hi>Tircis,</hi> if you had loved
me, as well as he loves her, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf he had never been my Judge; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, <hi>Diana</hi> loves him as well, as <hi>Phillis</hi> her <hi>Lycidas,</hi> nay better, until I did her
the good office of putting her into a little doubt. Content your <U+017F>elf with this I have
told you, and that I tell you no more, though I could very much, le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould
know how to remedie it. The per<U+017F>ons who are able to verifie the contrary, are all
ab<U+017F>ent, and will not return of a long time to tell them the truth: But tru<U+017F>t me, I
have not omitted any circum<U+017F>tance that might conduce unto my full revenge, either
in the manner, or in the time, or in the per<U+017F>ons that I have alledged. <hi>Tircis</hi> did
let her talk on a long time, and did <U+017F>uffer her to vomit up all her malice, to the end
he might gather <U+017F>omthing that might be a remedy again<U+017F>t it: But <U+017F>eeing that <U+017F>he
would not out with any thing more, he lo<U+017F>t all patience. Go, go you damned witch,
<U+017F>aid he unto her in a fury, you fiend of hell, <U+017F>ent hither upon earth to torment hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes;
thou do<U+017F>t not retain any thing of a woman but only thy habit, and thy
name; having under that <U+017F>hape the <U+017F>pirit of a Divel: Hence, hence thou horrid
Hag, get thee out of this happy Country, where <U+017F>uch malignant mon<U+017F>ters mu<U+017F>t not

to deliver me out of thy wretched hands, and from all thy wicked, malicious, and
damned devices.</p>
                     <p>Upon this he turned from her, and went a great pace, the <U+017F>ame way he came, and
left <hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>o a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at his reproofs, which her guilty con<U+017F>cience told her were

very <U+017F>orry, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> that <hi>Sylvander</hi> <U+017F>hould receive any harm, for I plainly
<U+017F>ee he is not culpable, and the fir<U+017F>t time that I <U+017F>ee him, that <U+017F>ame hand which gave
the wound, <U+017F>hall cure it.</p>
                     <p>I pray God, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that de<U+017F>pair do not drive him into <U+017F>ome de<U+017F>perate
cour<U+017F>e: No, no, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana, Sylvander</hi> is not in any <U+017F>uch danger; de<U+017F>pair will not
ea<U+017F>ily work upon <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>pirit as his. Yet let me tell you, replied <hi>Phillis,</hi> that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
of <U+017F>uch a cold con<U+017F>titution, as his, when griefs <U+017F>ei<U+017F>es upon them, are apt for
<U+017F>trange re<U+017F>olutions. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> as <U+017F>trong con<U+017F>titutions when a Fever <U+017F>ei<U+017F>es
upon them, have fits more violent then tho<U+017F>e that are weak, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o can they re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t
them better, and endure them longer. It is the <U+017F>ame with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trong <U+017F>pirits as that
of <hi>Sylvander;</hi> it is certain, they are more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of pain, but then they are more
able to endure and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t it: However Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> let not this confidence
make him endure any longer pain: I am confident, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> that we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee
him <U+017F>ometime this day, and then, he <U+017F>hall not depart without a good remedy, if he
be in any <U+017F>uch nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of it, as you think he is. But in the interim I conceive it be<U+017F>t
to take our way towards <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> and acquaint them with the mornings
adventures. Upon this they made their cour<U+017F>e towards the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> whom
they found <U+017F>till in bed.</p>
                     <p>For as <U+017F>oon as the<U+017F>e two companions were gone out of the chamber, in lieu of
dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he was talking with <hi>Alexis,</hi> and <U+017F>hewing her <U+017F>uch abundance of
good will, that the di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide</hi> was hardly able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of
favour; and the truth is, never was any lover <U+017F>o near delights without a ta<U+017F>te, as <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi>
was under the gui<U+017F>e of a woman, which he dur<U+017F>t not throw off. This con<U+017F>traint
went <U+017F>o again<U+017F>t the grain of this di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed <hi>Druide,</hi> that <U+017F>he blu<U+017F>hed <U+017F>everal times,
which <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> perceiving; Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I am afraid, that you are not well; for
I have ob<U+017F>erved your colour to change <U+017F>everal times, I be<U+017F>eech you, u<U+017F>e no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>traint,
for you cannot be in any place of the world, where you have more power
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53527:192"/>
then in this hou<U+017F>e. Servant, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis,</hi> I value not the pain, as I do the
favour which you do me, in ob<U+017F>erving the colour in my face: 'Tis true indeed, I am
not well, but it does not much trouble me, for it is only a dreg of my la<U+017F>t great <U+017F>ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
which I am often troubled with, but it will be pa<U+017F>t immediately, and I am
<U+017F>orry that you took any notice of it. Ah Mi<U+017F>tris, replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> you <U+017F>uffer no pain
which is little unto me, and you do me wrong in concealing it from me, <U+017F>ince I
might as your <U+017F>ervant have <U+017F>ought out for <U+017F>ome remedy. Servant, replied the <hi>Druide,</hi>
I perceive that you do love <hi>Alexis,</hi> more then <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erves, but never trouble your
<U+017F>elf at her pain, for my body is not in <U+017F>o much di<U+017F>order as my mind. Your mind,
<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you Mi<U+017F>tris, what is it that can be a trouble to it? Does not
all things comply even to your very wi<U+017F>hes? Have you not a Father that loves and
cheri<U+017F>hes you above all his children? Are you not <U+017F>upplied with every thing your
heart can de<U+017F>ire? Moreover, are you not e<U+017F>teemed and honoured by all that <U+017F>ee you?
What then is it that can po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly trouble your mind? You have forgot one thing,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> which would be a greater contentment unto me then all the world,
and which I de<U+017F>ire to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>e before it, which is, that <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> will love <hi>Alexis:</hi> Oh
God, an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> and embraced and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed <hi>Alexis,</hi> it is a <U+017F>in impardonable,
if Mi<U+017F>tris you do not think I love you: Yes, yes, Mi<U+017F>tris, I do love you, and love you
<U+017F>o, that I wi<U+017F>h Heaven may never love me if I do not, and puni<U+017F>h me with eternal
torments, when I have the lea<U+017F>t thought of any cea<U+017F>ing to love and honour you.
Do not <U+017F>ay that you do love me, an<U+017F>wered the <hi>Druide,</hi> but that you do love <hi>Alexis.</hi>
I do not under<U+017F>tand (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) what you mean by that; but I am <U+017F>ure that if I do
love <hi>Alexis,</hi> it is not the name; for if you had any other, my love to you will be
<U+017F>till the <U+017F>ame; and if you will know what it is that I do love, it is your per<U+017F>on, your
<U+017F>pirit, and your merit. Suppo<U+017F>e I were not a <hi>Druide,</hi> replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> would you
love me then? I would to God. an<U+017F>wered <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> that without any prejudice to
your <U+017F>elf, you were for my contentments <U+017F>ake a Shepherde<U+017F>s of <hi>Lignon,</hi> for then
I <U+017F>hould hope that the equallity which would be betwixt us, would more invite you
to accept of my affection. Suppo<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that I were a Shepherd, would
you <U+017F>till continue the <U+017F>ame good will unto me? Unto that (replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> very <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly)
I will an<U+017F>wer very freely, that it is ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to love you
any otherwi<U+017F>e then I doe. And truly it would not well become me to love a man <U+017F>o
well as I do you; and though it were permitted me, yet I think that I could not;
it is enough that I did love one, and therefore will love no more men. <hi>Alexis</hi> was
<U+017F>orry her curio<U+017F>ity had gone <U+017F>o far; but <U+017F>ince the Ice was broke, <U+017F>he would <U+017F>tep a
little farther. I knew <U+017F>ervant (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) that it was only <hi>Alexis</hi> whom
you loved, and not her per<U+017F>on; for otherwi<U+017F>e, if the Gods <U+017F>hould make me become
a Shepherd, why <U+017F>hould you then cea<U+017F>e to love me? If the Gods <U+017F>hould do <U+017F>o, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> I <U+017F>hould have an occa<U+017F>ion to complain again<U+017F>t them for depriving
me of all the happine<U+017F>s that I hoped ever to receive: and from that time, I would
bid adieu unto all delights and contentment. But why <U+017F>hould you not <U+017F>till love me,
<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> <U+017F>ince my body would be <U+017F>till my body, and my mind and <U+017F>oul, <U+017F>till the
<U+017F>ame? Alas Mi<U+017F>tris, an<U+017F>wered the Shepherde<U+017F>s, what would you have me <U+017F>ay? This
is all I am able to <U+017F>ay, that it <U+017F>hall never be <U+017F>aid, <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> did love two Shepherds.
I be<U+017F>eech you, dear Mi<U+017F>tris. no more of this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; for though I know that <U+017F>uch a
change cannot be, yet the very imagination of <U+017F>uch a thing does freeze my blood to
Ice; and indeed <U+017F>he did begin to look very pale in the face: Which <hi>Alexis</hi> <U+017F>eeing,
and thinking it not good to drive the nail to the head, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid thus unto her: Well
<U+017F>ervant, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I will not talk any longer upon this <U+017F>ubject, upon condition you
will tell me, what you dreamed this morning when you waked: with all my heart,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Astrea,</hi> if I can but remember it: but Mi<U+017F>tris, continued <U+017F>he, why do you
de<U+017F>ire it? Becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered the <hi>Druide,</hi> as you were betwixt <U+017F>leep and waking, I
heard you <U+017F>ay, as you turned towards me, in a pitifully complaining voice, ah <hi>Celadon:</hi>
Mi<U+017F>tris, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> by that word you put me in memory of part of my dream,
which otherwi<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould have forgotten; I dream't that I was in a grove <U+017F>o thick
with trees, bryers, and ru<U+017F>hes, that I tore all my clothes; and the ob<U+017F>curity of the
place did hinder me from <U+017F>eeing which way I <U+017F>hould pa<U+017F><U+017F>e; at la<U+017F>t after much <U+017F>trug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and long labour in vain to get out of this place, me thought I <U+017F>aw one, whom I
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53527:193"/>
did not know by rea<U+017F>on of the darkne<U+017F>s; coming towards me, and <U+017F>aid, holding her
hand before her face, that if I would follow her, <U+017F>he would help me out of that
thorny Labyrinth wherein I was: After I was helped out, me thought I thanked
her for her a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and went following her; and followed her, until both of us
were <U+017F>o wildered, that neither of us could get out of the Wood: At la<U+017F>t me-thought
that <U+017F>ome one coming betwixt my guide and me to part us, <U+017F>he gra<U+017F>ped my hand <U+017F>o
clo<U+017F>e, and I clung <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e unto her, that the other was forced to u<U+017F>e all the <U+017F>trength
he had to part us; and at la<U+017F>t, he pulled off the hand of her that guided me. At
the <U+017F>ame time me-thought I <U+017F>aw a little light, and therefore de<U+017F>iring to look upon
the hand which remained in mine, I found it to be a heart which panted, until he who
had <U+017F>evered me from my guide, returned with a great knife in his hand, and do what
I could, did give the heart <U+017F>uch a blow, that it made me all bloody: The horrour of
this did make me throw it away upon the ground; which I had no <U+017F>ooner done, but
I <U+017F>aw that the heart was turned into <hi>Celadon;</hi> which put me into <U+017F>uch a fright, that it
cau<U+017F>ed me to cry out as you heard me, and then I waked.</p>
                     <p>This dream, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> does certainly <U+017F>ignifie <U+017F>omthing; for though mo<U+017F>t of
them be fal<U+017F>e, and only impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of things precedent, which we have either <U+017F>een
or heard; and <U+017F>omtimes are only vapours ari<U+017F>ing from a <U+017F>urcharged <U+017F>tomack or el<U+017F>e
from the complexion, and according to the good or bad con<U+017F>titution of the Body:
yet this has none of tho<U+017F>e qualities which dreams u<U+017F>e to have; for they are full of
non-<U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and have neither head nor feet: but this is a compo<U+017F>ed <U+017F>tory, and holds a
corre<U+017F>pondency in all parts, al<U+017F>o it was in the morning, when vapours from the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
could work no effects: <U+017F>o as if you plea<U+017F>e, I can give you the interpretation
of it. I <U+017F>hould think my <U+017F>elf much obliged (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi>) if you would be plea<U+017F>ed to
take the pains.</p>
                     <p>This Wood <U+017F>o full of thorns and ob<U+017F>curity (<U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis</hi>) wherein you were, and
out of which you were <U+017F>o out of all hopes to get out, is the troubles and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
wherein you are; <U+017F>he who appeared and offered her <U+017F>elf as a guide through this
labyrinth, repre<U+017F>ents my <U+017F>elf; He which would <U+017F>ever us, is, that I <U+017F>hall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained
to return unto <hi>Carnutes</hi> by <hi>Adamas;</hi> we mu<U+017F>t both re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t as much as we can,

in lieu of <hi>Celadons;</hi> and in the knowledge of this you <U+017F>hall live more contentedly
then ever you did.</p>
                     <p>Ah Mi<U+017F>tris (<U+017F>aid <hi>Astrea</hi>) I like well the interpretation of my dream, but for that
<U+017F>ad <U+017F>eparation; and that indeed I cannot <U+017F>uffer, nor me thinks <U+017F>hould you<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Does it

as <U+017F>he thinks the time of parting to be the time of her death? As <U+017F>he utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the<U+017F>e words, tears trickled down her fair checks; and becau<U+017F>e <hi>Alexis</hi> looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, and <U+017F>pake not, <U+017F>he continued: Ah Mi<U+017F>tris, Mi<U+017F>tris, will you not afford me
one word of comfort? Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you <U+017F>hould ever con<U+017F>ent unto any <U+017F>eparation?
Judge you, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> whether I con<U+017F>ent unto it or no, <U+017F>ince your dream tells
me, that I am to leave my heart with you; and do you think I would not be where
it is? Oh Mi<U+017F>tris, replied the Shepherde<U+017F>s, this is not enough to give me <U+017F>atisfaction;
but <U+017F>wear unto me you will not, by that thing which will mo<U+017F>t inviolably oblige you

yes to you I will, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> becau<U+017F>e you were the cau<U+017F>e of our ri<U+017F>ing <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon,
and con<U+017F>equently of the encounter which we met withall, and which only could
drive that angry Shepherde<U+017F>s out of that opinion which <U+017F>he entertained; had we
mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed this occa<U+017F>ion, we had never recovered it, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he who hatched and brought
forth all the<U+017F>e traiterous devi<U+017F>es, went away as <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he had (unknown to
her <U+017F>elf) done this good office unto <hi>Sylvander.</hi> Hereupon <U+017F>he related the whole
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e betwixt <hi>Laonice</hi> and <hi>Tircis,</hi> and forgot not a <U+017F>illable of tho<U+017F>e things which
<hi>Laonice</hi> <U+017F>poke, either again<U+017F>t her, or again<U+017F>t poor <hi>Sylvander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is now, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that cholerick <hi>Diana</hi> convinced; <U+017F>he that would not give
credit unto any but <hi>Laonice;</hi> who thought that <U+017F>he only could <U+017F>peak the truth, and
that poor <U+017F>illy we were all lyers: I thank God, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> for conducting both
you and <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>o opportunely to hear her, and all her trechery; for had you been <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated,
I verily believe <hi>Diana</hi> would not have believed your reports: nay, though
<U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf had heard it without a witne<U+017F>s, it would have been a long time before
<U+017F>he would have confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed her knowledge. 'Tis true, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> and I thank
the goodne<U+017F><U+017F>e of Heaven that has <U+017F>o happily directed me to the only means that
could clear all my doubts. From hence may be ob<U+017F>erved (<U+017F>aid the <hi>Druide</hi>) that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
is never left without a helper, <U+017F>ince the poor and innocent <hi>Sylvander</hi> has
found it when his hopes were mo<U+017F>t remote. And <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> how good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is, and how <U+017F>omtimes to our con<U+017F>olation it cau<U+017F>eth future things to be foretold
by per<U+017F>ons who <U+017F>peak them in je<U+017F>t, I my <U+017F>elf have found this to be <U+017F>o in this accident;
for when I was honoured in the habit of my Mi<U+017F>tris; I told <hi>Sylvander</hi> that within
three dayes he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ee an end of the pain wherein he was, I <U+017F>poke it only to keep
him alive by infu<U+017F>ing this hope, and not that I thought it would come to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e: yet
you <U+017F>ee, I foretold the event as truly as if I had received it from the mouth of a God.
To make your predictions true, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> it is very requi<U+017F>ite and full time you ri<U+017F>e
out of your bed, that we may go unto the place where <hi>Sylvander</hi> u<U+017F>es to be, unle<U+017F>s
you will carry your bed with you into the wood, where we will go and de<U+017F>ire that
Shepherd to bring you your <U+017F>mock. Neither you nor he need to take that pains,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Astrea,</hi> pray go you unto him, and bring him hither into this chamber,
where he never yet was whil<U+017F>t I was in my bed: Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible? <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> no I a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Astrea,</hi> neither he nor any other Shepherd, and of this I dare take an
oath. Never <U+017F>wear, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you be mo<U+017F>t certainly a<U+017F><U+017F>ured: I believe
you do think <U+017F>o, but perhaps you may be deceived, and what do you know but that
there may at this time be one concealed and hid? You are plea<U+017F>ed to jear me; replied
<hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> but believe it Mi<U+017F>tris, we do keep a more re<U+017F>erved di<U+017F>tance with the Shepherds
of <hi>Lignon,</hi> then you do think we do. Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> the time was when
I dur<U+017F>t have taken <U+017F>uch an oath as that, which if I had, you know I had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>worn.
However, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> if you will plea<U+017F>e to give me a little lei<U+017F>ure, I will dre<U+017F><U+017F>e
my <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ave <hi>Sylvander</hi> a labour of coming hither.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, <hi>Alexis</hi> ro<U+017F>e up and fetched her own cloaths unto her dear Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s,
Servant, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I would have you take my cloaths; be you my Mi<U+017F>tris and
call me <U+017F>ervant; and when I take them, then I will be the Mi<U+017F>tris, and you the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
What will people <U+017F>ay, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Astrea,</hi> when they hear me call you <U+017F>o? They
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53527:194"/>
will <U+017F>ay, replied <hi>Alexis,</hi> that it were <U+017F>trange if you <U+017F>hould call me otherwi<U+017F>e, I being
in the habit of a Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, and you in a <hi>Druides,</hi> and <U+017F>o of me, if I <U+017F>hould call
you by any other name then Mi<U+017F>tris: for my part, <U+017F>aid <hi>Astrea,</hi> I had rather fail, by
obeying you, then not to do as you command; and to <U+017F>hew my obedience: Servant,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, if you do not help me to put on this Gown, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you I am <U+017F>o ignorant,
that I know not where to begin. <hi>Alexis</hi> then took <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> by one hand, did put
that into one arm of the Gown; and then getting upon the bed, did put her other
arm into the <U+017F>leeve of the Gown, and with <U+017F>o much contentment, or rather rapture,
that <U+017F>he knew not what <U+017F>he did: for this new <hi>Druide</hi> did <U+017F>o confidently believe her
to be a woman, that <U+017F>he did not hide any thing from her. At the la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he was dre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed:
and becau<U+017F>e it was <U+017F>omthing late, they left the hou<U+017F>e, and went all together to
bid <hi>Phocion</hi> good morrow, who <U+017F>eeing them di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ed in this manner, did at the fir<U+017F>t,
mi<U+017F>take them; but afterwards taking better notice of them, he was extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
at it. But the<U+017F>e fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es had <U+017F>uch a de<U+017F>ire to put <hi>Sylvander</hi> out of
his pain, that without entertaining any motions of dinner from <hi>Phocion,</hi> they all
took their leaves of him, and went unto the place where they hoped to meet <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sylvander,</hi> after he had got into the wood to avoid the company of <hi>Alcander</hi>
and his Brother, went walking and wandering up and down all the night, until it
was break of day; and he by fortune found him<U+017F>elf upon the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> where
re<U+017F>ting him<U+017F>elf, <U+017F>leep <U+017F>o <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ed upon his eyes, that the Sun was a good height, when
<U+017F>ome dogs of the neighbouring Towns running at wolves, did awake him. Before
his mind was thus tormented with the<U+017F>e turbulent perplexities, if he had heard the
barking of a dog, he would have been the fir<U+017F>t of all the Shepherds in running to
pre<U+017F>erve either his own or his friends flocks: but now, he <U+017F>tirred no more then if he
had no intere<U+017F>t in any flocks; which <U+017F>hews that the <U+017F>tronger pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion makes the <U+017F>oul
contemn the weaker. By fortune at the <U+017F>ame time an Officer who u<U+017F>ed to wait at
the Oracle of <hi>Mount-Verdune,</hi> and who knew <hi>Sylvander,</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by him, and <U+017F>eeing
him not <U+017F>tir at the cour<U+017F>e of the dogs, he did much wonder at it; and had an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that he was not well, becau<U+017F>e it was not his cu<U+017F>tom to <U+017F>it <U+017F>till upon <U+017F>uch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion.
But coming to him, and <U+017F>eeing no <U+017F>igns of any <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e in his face, becau<U+017F>e he
di<U+017F><U+017F>embled the angui<U+017F>h of his looks and mind, when he <U+017F>aw him approach: how now
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid he unto him, who would have thought you <U+017F>o backward in pur<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the common enemy to our flocks? I know not of what enemies you <U+017F>peak,
an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander</hi> <U+017F>oberly, for there are <U+017F>o many <U+017F>orts of them, that he who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to pur<U+017F>ue them all, has work enough; truly, <U+017F>aid the Officer, I know that
the Gods do intend <U+017F>ome great and mi<U+017F>erable mi<U+017F>-fortune towards us; and there is
not any more certain <U+017F>ign of a Countries ruine, then when <hi>Tautates</hi> takes from it
great and eminent per<U+017F>ons, by who<U+017F>e coun<U+017F>els and valour it was pre<U+017F>erved: and
when the re<U+017F>t are carele<U+017F><U+017F>e of its welfare and defence. And why, <U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander,</hi> do
you <U+017F>peak the<U+017F>e words? Becau<U+017F>e, an<U+017F>wered the Officer, all the victimes which we
Sacrifice, are found <U+017F>o defective, that they do a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h all the Sacrificers; <U+017F>uch mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
never hapned in my dayes; I <U+017F>ay mi<U+017F>-fortunes, becau<U+017F>e it is a pre<U+017F>age of
the wor<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>-fortunes that can befal us: and now, at this time, I <U+017F>ee that <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
who was wont to be the mo<U+017F>t careful man in all the Country, in the pre<U+017F>ervation of
his e<U+017F>tate and flock, is now grown carele<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>eems as if the publique lo<U+017F>s did no
more concern him, then if he had no <U+017F>hare in it. You ought not, replied <hi>Sylvander</hi>
then, to conclude of an augure from my actions: for fir<U+017F>t, Heaven would not have
them take notice of a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o mi<U+017F>erable as I am: and next, I am worth <U+017F>o little, that
it ought not to be con<U+017F>iderable. The Officer then an<U+017F>wered; there is an exce<U+017F>s, as
well in too much de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ing, as in too much e<U+017F>teeming ones <U+017F>elf: and <U+017F>omtimes as much
vanity and pride in the one as the other; as the Philo<U+017F>opher told him who to <U+017F>hew
how much he de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed rich and co<U+017F>tly habits, did wear an old rotten cloak full of
holes; take heed, <U+017F>aid the Philo<U+017F>opher, that your pride do not appear through the
holes of your cloak: and <U+017F>o <hi>Sylvander,</hi> take heed le<U+017F>t in <U+017F>peaking le<U+017F><U+017F>e advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly
of your <U+017F>elf then you de<U+017F>erve, you be not chargeable with the <U+017F>ame fault: all
that knows <hi>Sylvander,</hi> knows al<U+017F>o his merit, and his capacity, and what e<U+017F>teem he is
in this Country; and therefore to <U+017F>peak again<U+017F>t the opinion of every one, is either,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53527:194"/>
that he would declare him<U+017F>elf his own enemy, or el<U+017F>e would give occa<U+017F>ion to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
more: upon this, without any <U+017F>tay for the Shepherds an<U+017F>wer, he went
on his way, leaving <hi>Sylvander</hi> in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort a<U+017F>hamed of the e<U+017F>teem which he had
of him.</p>
                     <p>This thought <U+017F>tayed him a while in that place; at la<U+017F>t returning unto that which
mo<U+017F>t touched him to the quick: and con<U+017F>idering the inevitable accident which was
faln upon him that was <U+017F>o innocent, he thought that Heaven was certainly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
again<U+017F>t him: and that by this correction it would make him re-enter into the
con<U+017F>ideration of him<U+017F>elf; to the end that <U+017F>ubmitting him<U+017F>elf unto him from whom
all true con<U+017F>olations can come, he might receive that remedy which he ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
only from him. This thought cau<U+017F>ed him to fall down pre<U+017F>ently upon his knees,
and holding up his hand to Heaven, he implored aide: and at the <U+017F>ame time re<U+017F>olved
to con<U+017F>ult with the Oracle of <hi>Cleontine;</hi> in order to this de<U+017F>ign, he pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over

                     </lg>
                     <p>When the <U+017F>ad Shepherd received this cruel an<U+017F>wer, he <U+017F>tood as immoveable, but
not <U+017F>o in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible as a rock; for <U+017F>uch was his re<U+017F>entment, that after he had folded his
arms, he fell down, and for a very long time gave no <U+017F>ign of life, unle<U+017F>s by the
tears that flowed from his eyes: <U+017F>o that the <hi>Vacies</hi> and <hi>Eubages</hi> there pre<U+017F>ent, were
exceedingly moved to compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; but he an<U+017F>wered them all with <U+017F>ilence, turning
his eyes only upon him that <U+017F>poke, but in <U+017F>uch a pitiful manner, that he forced tears
from the eyes of all the company. At la<U+017F>t, a good part of the day being pa<U+017F>t, he
went from <hi>Mount-Verdune</hi> without <U+017F>peaking a word, and <U+017F>o retired him<U+017F>elf into
the great wood next the long walk, not with any other de<U+017F>ign but to be in that
place, where <hi>Phillis</hi> delivered that cruel me<U+017F><U+017F>age unto him, thinking that the <U+017F>ight
of this place would augment his grief, and <U+017F>o much the <U+017F>ooner end his mi<U+017F>erable life,
in which he hoped for no manner of content.</p>
                     <p>But by fortune, <hi>Alexis, Astrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> came thither at the <U+017F>ame
time, to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e away the heat of the day, according to their cu<U+017F>tom. <hi>Phillis</hi> was
the fir<U+017F>t who <U+017F>pied the Shepherd, and <U+017F>hewed him pre<U+017F>ently unto her companions:
<U+017F>he would have called unto him, but <hi>Diana</hi> did prevent her, <U+017F>aying, I would not
have him think that I have been jealous, for <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>pirit as his would draw no <U+017F>mall
con<U+017F>equences from <U+017F>uch a thought. What then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> would you have us
do? We mu<U+017F>t and <U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t you, have compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon his pain. True, an<U+017F>wered
the Shepherde<U+017F>s, but you mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o have compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon me; and me thinks it is
not a matter of <U+017F>uch <U+017F>mal concernment unto me, but it de<U+017F>erves very great con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
upon this, <U+017F>he turned towards <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi> who were a little retired,
and propounded unto them the difficulty which <U+017F>he found in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. It is a
hard ca<U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that one <U+017F>hould take <U+017F>o much pains to conceal truth. What
truth Madam, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> do you <U+017F>peak of? You would not have <hi>Sylvander</hi>
know that you love him, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alexis;</hi> and to hide this truth from him, you
are pumping for <U+017F>ome tricks and artifices to delude him: is it not much better to
live freely with him, as you <U+017F>ee this fair Shepherde<U+017F>s and I do? Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi>
you and <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> are both of one <U+017F>ex, and therefore allowed. But, <U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> what
do you think then of <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Lycidas?</hi> I do think Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> that if <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde</hi>
my Mother would approve of <hi>Sylvanders</hi> marriage and mine, as <hi>Artemis</hi> does
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53527:195"/>
of that between <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Lycidas,</hi> perhaps then I <U+017F>hould make no difficulty to do
as <hi>Phillis</hi> does: but knowing that this a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, why <U+017F>hould I make my
good will appear unto this Shepherd? It would not perhaps avail him any thing at
all, but perhaps bring much harm unto me; for I know that I will never chu<U+017F>e a
Husband without <hi>Belindes</hi> con<U+017F>ent, and I am mo<U+017F>t confident that <U+017F>he will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
unto a marriage betwixt <hi>Sylvander</hi> and me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexis</hi> then began to <U+017F>peak; I do not know, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, of what mind and humour
<hi>Belinde</hi> is, having never <U+017F>een her; but I do find <hi>Sylvander</hi> to be a man <U+017F>o very well
qualified, as I cannot think but if <hi>Belinde</hi> knew him, <U+017F>he would approve of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.
For a man is to be preferred before e<U+017F>tate, I mean <U+017F>uch a man as <hi>Sylvander,</hi>
who<U+017F>e qualities are <U+017F>o highly e<U+017F>timable, as <U+017F>uch another is not to be found in all <hi>Gaul.</hi>
Oh Madam, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> virtue now a dayes does get but little credit, if it be not
<U+017F>et off with riches: be<U+017F>ides this, my Parents will never con<U+017F>ent that I <U+017F>hould give my
<U+017F>elf unto a per<U+017F>on that is unknown: one who<U+017F>e fate is <U+017F>o di<U+017F>a<U+017F>terous, that he him<U+017F>elf
does not know who was either his Father, or his Mother, or his Country. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tance,
replied <hi>A<U+017F>trea,</hi> is very con<U+017F>iderable; but as we conclude that a Ro<U+017F>e
grows upon a Ro<U+017F>e-tree, <U+017F>o may we the <U+017F>ame of <hi>Sylvander;</hi> <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
perfections, who can doubt but that he is de<U+017F>cended from Excellent and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Parents? The<U+017F>e conjectures, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> are very good; but it belongs not
unto me, neither to urge them any farther, nor to deny them: but for my part, I
will lay all the fault upon <hi>Phillis.</hi> Upon me, replied <U+017F>he, I be<U+017F>eech you wherein am
I culpable? Was is not you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, which did him all the harm in
telling him? This is an excellent good rea<U+017F>on indeed, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> it was I
that did him all the harm in telling him: pray who did all the harm in putting me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and giving me a commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion for it, nay pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing me unto it? I <U+017F>ee, an<U+017F>wered
<hi>Diana,</hi> that it is an ea<U+017F>ie matter to give a commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but a very hard matter to give
prudence and di<U+017F>cretion to execute it. And good my Lady Emba<U+017F><U+017F>ador, who gave
you any in<U+017F>tructions, to run and tell <hi>Sylvander</hi> every word which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion did <U+017F>hake
from my tongue? You who<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions were calm, and judgment free and <U+017F>ound, why
did you not <U+017F>tay a little, and give me leave to con<U+017F>ider in cool blood, till the heat of
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was over? Had it not been time enough now to have delivered him <U+017F>uch a
me<U+017F><U+017F>age as might have co<U+017F>t him his life? But you were <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>ty, and all upon the
<U+017F>pur, to tell him that which <U+017F>hould have been <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly pondered, and con<U+017F>idered
upon with grave and <U+017F>erious deliberation, and after you had been many times pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
entreated, de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>olicited, nay pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed unto: I be<U+017F>eech you tell me, Suppo<U+017F>e
<hi>Sylvander</hi> had dyed upon it; did you think it would have plea<U+017F>ed me? Nay, could
you think I would not have hated you all the dayes of my life? Oh with what pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and <U+017F>olidity the<U+017F>e offices are to be performed? For could you imagine that
you would not be culpable of all the inconveniences that <U+017F>hould en<U+017F>ue upon it? And
were not you worthy to bear all the blame? <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but
laugh to hear <hi>Phillis</hi> thus charged, and to <U+017F>ee that <U+017F>he could not an<U+017F>wer unto it, and
therefore they condemned her to do what<U+017F>oever <hi>Diana</hi> de<U+017F>ired of her. I do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> a very fine Sentence; which yet, in re<U+017F>pect of my Judges, I will
obey; but unto what puni<U+017F>hment, I be<U+017F>eech you, mu<U+017F>t I be condemned? Not <U+017F>o
great as your crime, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> I will only, that when you <U+017F>ee <hi>Sylvander</hi>
next, you <U+017F>hall a<U+017F><U+017F>ure him, that all which you told unto him was only out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>allary,
and that I did never know any thing concerning it: <U+017F>o that he may think all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from your mouth, and that when I do <U+017F>peak next unto him, I may treat him as
I was wont to do, before the trechery of <hi>Laonice.</hi> I do a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
I did alwayes think you to be very <U+017F>ubtle, but never <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtle as I find you now.
No, no, <U+017F>aid <hi>Alexis,</hi> this is no <U+017F>ubtilty, but prudence; for <hi>Diana</hi> has rea<U+017F>on to de<U+017F>ire
it, and though you had not committed the fault whereof you are convicted, yet you
ought to do as <U+017F>he <U+017F>ays. Madam, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> I <U+017F>hould be more willing to do
it, were I not obliged unto it; for I am of <U+017F>uch an humour, that I had rather give
twenty gifts, then pay one debt.</p>
                     <p>Whil<U+017F>t they were thus talking, <hi>Sylvander</hi> all <U+017F>orrow, and hanging down his head,
came through the wood, till he was ju<U+017F>t upon the place where the<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es
were: and by fortune <U+017F>o near, that when he <U+017F>aw them, and would have turned
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53527:195"/>
back, <hi>Phillis</hi> in obedience to the command upon her<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> did <U+017F>peak unto him; <hi>Sylvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Sylvander,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, do you remember the time when you put me out
of all patience again<U+017F>t <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and made it your delight to make him jealous? And
becau<U+017F>e he an<U+017F>wered not, <U+017F>he continued; If you do remember, let it be a warning to
you for the future, not to offend a woman, for it will not be long before <U+017F>he be
revenged: and if you will not believe it, let me <U+017F>erve you for an example. I do not
know (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander</hi> very dejectedly) what you mean: I do mean, replied
<hi>Phillis,</hi> that all the <U+017F>tories which I told you concerning <hi>Diana,</hi> and her anger, were
things only invented by my <U+017F>elf, to be revenged of you for making <hi>Lycidas</hi> jealous of
me, when he ob<U+017F>erved the familiarity which was then betwixt you and me. How
(<U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) <hi>Diana</hi> not know any thing of all that which you told unto me?
Not at all, I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis. Diana</hi> hearing her <U+017F>elf named, and
faigning to be ignorant what the matter was, <U+017F>he went unto them, and addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing
her <U+017F>elf unto the Shepherd, I heard you name me, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him) I be<U+017F>eech
you, what <U+017F>hare have I in your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e? I am <U+017F>o confounded (<U+017F>aid <hi>Sylvander</hi>) to
hear and to <U+017F>ee what I do, as I do think my <U+017F>elf to be in a dream. <hi>Phillis</hi> then
breaking out into a loud laughter, Si<U+017F>ter, (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) you mu<U+017F>t know from
me, what this Shepherd does know but in part; upon this, <U+017F>he began to relate the
jealou<U+017F>ie of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> the pains <U+017F>he put upon him, and how <hi>Sylvander</hi> behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
towards her. To be brief, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I thought that if I were not revenged, I
<U+017F>hould never enjoy any contentment in my life. I knew how <hi>Sylvander</hi>

<hi>Madonthe,</hi> and never acquainted you with it: I thought this to be a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
for my revenge; and indeed, ask him how he likes it, and whether he will
take <U+017F>o much pains again to vex me any more. But I be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> what
<U+017F>hare have I in all this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s? You have had what <U+017F>hare I plea<U+017F>ed, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:</hi>
For I made you <U+017F>peak, even what I would, Truly Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> I am very
much obliged to you, for making me to <U+017F>peak when I never thought upon you. I
be<U+017F>eech you Si<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> to pardon me, for I mu<U+017F>t needs be revenged. Oh
Heavens! (cryed out <hi>Sylvander,</hi> recoyling a pace or two, and folding his arms
one within another) Oh ye Gods, is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>hould have no hand or
knowledg of that me<U+017F><U+017F>age which you told me from her? No, replied <hi>Phillis;</hi> <U+017F>he
knows not one <U+017F>illable of it; and that you may <U+017F>ee I <U+017F>ay truly, here <hi>Sylvander,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<U+017F>he, and gave him the bracelet which <U+017F>he took from him, take this again,
for I am contented with tho<U+017F>e tears which my theft did co<U+017F>t you. <hi>Sylvander</hi> kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down upon the ground, he took it and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed it a hundred times: and <hi>Diana</hi> the
better to colour her <U+017F>eeming ignorance: Si<U+017F>ter (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto her) what is that which

<hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> then began to <U+017F>peak; Truly <hi>Phillis,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I cannot chu<U+017F>e but admire at

courte<U+017F>ies, as it is at offences, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander,</hi> <U+017F>he may remember that it was I
who compo<U+017F>ed all differences betwixt <hi>Lycidas</hi> and her: and you al<U+017F>o may remember
that I have done the like for you, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis:</hi> pray con<U+017F>ider that I could have
kept you a long time in this torment; whereas I contented my <U+017F>elf only with two or
three dayes: and you are beholding unto me for no le<U+017F>s then your life. 'Tis true,
(an<U+017F>wered <hi>Sylvander</hi> faintly) for I cannot term that a life which I <U+017F>hould have lived:
but cruel enemy, did you but con<U+017F>ider what mi<U+017F>eries you have cau<U+017F>ed upon me, I
cannot think you would have thought upon any revenge, but rather have pitied the
poor unfortunate <hi>Sylvander,</hi> who had no hopes of any contentment, but in his
grave. Shepherd, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Phillis,</hi> you may believe, that for all my revenge, I
<U+017F>hould have been very <U+017F>orry that any ill accident <U+017F>hould have hapned unto you,
e<U+017F>pecially upon my occa<U+017F>ion. Alas, oh my enemy, replied <hi>Sylvander</hi> <U+017F>adly, you are
the occa<U+017F>ion of my greate<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>ery, which is of <U+017F>uch a nature that no remedy can
cure. Certainly your mi<U+017F>ery mu<U+017F>t be very great, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Diana,</hi> if it be beyond
all cure; and yet I will condemn <hi>Phillis</hi> to contribute all her endeavours towards it,
as thinking her obliged thereunto; and not only <U+017F>he, but all us, nay all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

me obliged to cure the mi<U+017F>eries of this Shepherd, be they of what quality they will,
I will promi<U+017F>e to cure them, provided alwayes, that you, on your part, will contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
your endeavours al<U+017F>o. <hi>Diana</hi> <U+017F>miled, and an<U+017F>wered; you mu<U+017F>t be a very good

I will do it, <U+017F>o he will tell me his di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. My di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e (an<U+017F>wered the Shepherd with

<hi>Phillis,</hi> I will cure you, if you have but the courage to tell your di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and
<hi>Diana</hi> a will to apply the remedy. When you <U+017F>ee the greatne<U+017F>s of it, (replied the

which <U+017F>he has, an<U+017F>wered he, proceeds from her ignorance of that which I do but

began to <U+017F>peak: This Oracle, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, is indeed very <U+017F>trange; but if it plea<U+017F>e
<hi>Diana,</hi> it is ab<U+017F>olutely to your advantage. To his advantage? <U+017F>aid <hi>Diana,</hi> yes, <U+017F>aid
<hi>Sylvander,</hi> to my advantage, <U+017F>o far as by my death to take me out of this mi<U+017F>ery:
No, no, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> it is clearly in favour of <hi>Sylvander</hi> if <hi>Diana</hi> will. Either I do

unto you all manner of contentment by this Oracle. As for the fir<U+017F>t ver<U+017F>e,
which tells you that your pre<U+017F>ent pain <U+017F>hall quickly cea<U+017F>e, there needs no better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
then the event which you have already found. As to the <U+017F>econd
which <U+017F>eems <U+017F>uch a fatal <U+017F>aying unto you, it is delivered in an ambigious manner, as
mo<U+017F>t Oracles are; the ambiguity re<U+017F>ts in this word, <hi>Marry,</hi> which has a double
<U+017F>ence, and may be taken two wayes: fir<U+017F>t, we u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>ay, that a husband does marry
his wife: and <U+017F>econdly, we <U+017F>ay that the <hi>Druide</hi> does marry the husband and the wife;
and it is in this la<U+017F>t <U+017F>ence it is to be under<U+017F>tood, that <hi>Paris</hi> mu<U+017F>t marry <hi>Diana:</hi> he
<U+017F>hall become a <hi>Druide</hi> like unto his Father <hi>Adamas,</hi> and it <U+017F>hall be he who <U+017F>hall marry

upon the coun<U+017F>el which you give me; <U+017F>o be it, <U+017F>aid <hi>Phillis,</hi> but furthermore, I do

<U+017F>peak one <U+017F>illable; and looked as if his eyes were dazled with too much light: this
inexce<U+017F><U+017F>ive joy did almo<U+017F>t take away from him the u<U+017F>e of rea<U+017F>on; but his <U+017F>ilence and
his raptures had more eloquence in them then he had, and better-<U+017F>poke the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of his affection then his tongue could: and had it not been for <hi>Alexis</hi> and the
Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es who helped him up, he had continued long in this amorous exta<U+017F>ie,
not knowing <U+017F>o much as what he did. <hi>Diana</hi> her <U+017F>elf was no le<U+017F>s moved, though <U+017F>he

the Shepherd and <U+017F>miled) to adore many Gods, <hi>Phillis</hi> <U+017F>hould certainly be an

I <U+017F>hould be mo<U+017F>t ungrateful indeed, replied <hi>Sylvander,</hi> if I did not acknowledg what
is due unto you; but I <U+017F>hould be much more ungrateful, did I equal my obligations
I ow unto <hi>Diana,</hi> with tho<U+017F>e I ow unto you: for tho<U+017F>e I do ow unto you, are but

And therefore <hi>Phillis,</hi> undeceive your <U+017F>elf in this: all the benefits which you have
done me, I take as coming from her; for otherwi<U+017F>e I would not e<U+017F>teem them bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.
I perceive, replied <hi>Phliis,</hi> and <U+017F>miled, that all my labour in obliging you is

that I give Heaven no thanks for the life it hath given me, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I may

Thus did <hi>Diana</hi> let <hi>Sylvander</hi> know that <U+017F>he loved him; and ever <U+017F>ince this day
<U+017F>he was not <U+017F>hie, nor made any difficulty to live with him, as <hi>A<U+017F>trea</hi> was wont to do
with <hi>Celadon,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> with <hi>Lycidas:</hi> <U+017F>o as <hi>Sylvander</hi> has <U+017F>ince oftentimes <U+017F>aid,
that he had never been happy, if he had not been fir<U+017F>t mi<U+017F>erable.</p>

that a woman can deceive a man a hundred wayes when <U+017F>he has a mind unto it, and
therefore it concerns you to keep my friend<U+017F>hip very carefully. All the company
did fall to laughing, and they walked along the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> till they came to the

                     <p>The <hi>Druide</hi> knew very well that it was the place where <U+017F>he received tho<U+017F>e cruel

<hi>Astrea</hi> did not an<U+017F>wer, but looked upon her, changed colour, and could not chu<U+017F>e

cau<U+017F>e to call this place fatall, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he was very near being drowned there: for
<U+017F>he fell into the River, and but for <U+017F>ome happy help which came in opportunely,
this Country had for ever lo<U+017F>t the faire<U+017F>t Shepherde<U+017F>s that ever lived in it. I pray

yes, replied <hi>Astrea,</hi> when the mi<U+017F>eries which are related, do not make mi<U+017F>era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

come into my memory without infinite grief: and <U+017F>ee <hi>Sylvander</hi> whether I have not
good rea<U+017F>on for it; for when I fell from that fatal place into the water, poor <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

<U+017F>o as I had no <U+017F>ooner bewailed the one, but tears began to over<U+017F>wel my eyes for the

flowed into a torrent, had they not heard a Shepherd <U+017F>inging, which diverted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strea,</hi>

this fair one (pointing at <hi>Delphire</hi>) <U+017F>o negligent in the ob<U+017F>ervance of tho<U+017F>e Laws,

this reproach is in<U+017F>upportable; and were I not in hopes that ere long our

                     <p>Be plea<U+017F>ed to know then, fair and Wi<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, that <hi>Thomantes</hi> being the
only <U+017F>on of his Parents, was brought up with abundance of tender care, by the Wi<U+017F>e
Shepherde<U+017F>s <hi>Ericanthe</hi> his Mother, and by <hi>Eleaman</hi> his Father: <U+017F>o tender was their
care over him, that they would never <U+017F>uffer him to be out of their pre<U+017F>ence, as
thinking that as <U+017F>oon as they lo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ight of him, he was lo<U+017F>t for ever. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
<hi>Eleaman</hi> and <hi>Ericanthe</hi> were the wealthie<U+017F>t in all our Town, as well in the great
abundance of flocks and pa<U+017F>tures, as in the great number of Shepherds and Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>es,
unto who<U+017F>e charge he committed the care of them, the young <hi>Thomantes</hi>
was brought up in all the qualities and exerci<U+017F>es fit for a Shepherd of his rank, in
which for his age, he did <U+017F>o profit him<U+017F>elf, that none in all our coa<U+017F>ts could equal
him. Being got out of the hands of his Nur<U+017F>e, an ancient and Wi<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F>tor was <U+017F>et
over him as his Governour; not that he was thereby excluded from the company of
tho<U+017F>e women, who waited upon his Mother; for on the contrary he was among<U+017F>t
them till the age of ten or twelve years, <U+017F>o beloved and care<U+017F><U+017F>ed by all, as well were
they that could love him mo<U+017F>t, for be<U+017F>ides his being very amiable, and had all the
good qualities that one of his age could have, he was looked upon as the darling and
delight of the Pa<U+017F>tor <hi>Eleaman,</hi> and of the <U+017F>age <hi>Ericanthe</hi> their Mi<U+017F>tris. But as it
commonly happens at that age, rather by in<U+017F>tinct then by election, to love one above
another, the young <hi>Thomantes</hi> no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw ten years of age, but he <U+017F>hewed a
great inclination to love <hi>Delphire,</hi> who was then brought up with <hi>Ericanthe,</hi> and
and not above eight or nine years old at that time. Their innocent age, and their
de<U+017F>ign without de<U+017F>ign, not being yet in<U+017F>tructed in the art of di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation, every
one took notice of the particular affection of <hi>Thomantes</hi> unto <hi>Delphire;</hi> whereof
<hi>Ericanthe</hi> was very glad, as well becau<U+017F>e that Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e was indeed very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om,

does more awake and enliven youth, nor rou<U+017F>e it up unto noble de<U+017F>igns, then love:
doing in this the office of Steel, which makes a flint to <U+017F>parkle, that is of it <U+017F>elf cold,
and without light. One may ea<U+017F>ily imagine what kind of infantine affection this was,
which they bore one to the other, for I am confident none can think it above mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of play for pins, or making pre<U+017F>ents of cheries, and telling old tales, that their
Nur<U+017F>es taught them in the Univer<U+017F>ity of the Nur<U+017F>erie: but <U+017F>o it was, that the<U+017F>e tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling

degrees the<U+017F>e childi<U+017F>h inclinations unto great affections: the Shepherd when he was
arrived at his fourteenth year, was able to call him<U+017F>elf old Lover, it being now five

a proficient as to know that it was love: but afterwards, both of them growing
every day more learned then other, they came to under<U+017F>tand the Mi<U+017F>tery; and then
confirming by their wills what they had done before by hazard, or at lea<U+017F>t by a

one could not know whether her actions proceeded from affection or from duty:
the love of <hi>Thomantes</hi> was now known unto all tho<U+017F>e in the hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Ericanthe:
Delphire</hi> her <U+017F>elf could not doubt it, before ever the Shepherd did let her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand

                     <p>It <U+017F>eems Heaven would let this young Shepherd know, that he had not been
born, but only to live in the <U+017F>ervice of this fair one; for though he had opportunity
enough to <U+017F>peak unto her, and to let her under<U+017F>tand his affection, yet he <U+017F>tayed till
the day of his birth before he would declare it by word, as if he had <U+017F>aid, that the
day whereon <U+017F>he received him for her <U+017F>ervant, <U+017F>hould be the fir<U+017F>t day that he did
rightly begin to live. It fortun'd <U+017F>o, that a little before, an Uncle unto <hi>Delphire</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which cau<U+017F>ed her, according to cu<U+017F>tom, to be in a mourning habit. <hi>Delphire</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an excellent grace in decking and dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing her <U+017F>elf more hand<U+017F>omly then any of
the young Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es in the Town, <U+017F>he appeared <U+017F>o fair and hand<U+017F>om in that
habit of <U+017F>orrow, as there was no eye which looked upon her without ravi<U+017F>hment
and admiration, as well at her beauty as her <U+017F>weet civilities: and <hi>Thomantes</hi> was not
<U+017F>o much an admirer as an adorer, but indeed both; and took <U+017F>uch delight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
her actions, as his eyes had no other objects: he could not <U+017F>atisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
with commending her; <U+017F>omtimes he doted upon her complexion; <U+017F>omtimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <U+017F>ymetry and features of her face; <U+017F>omtimes upon the vivacity of her eyes;
<U+017F>omtimes the coral of her lip; <U+017F>omtimes upon the ivory of her teeth; otherwhiles,
he was wholly taken up, with her <U+017F>tature, garb, and mind: otherwiles with the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
and whitene<U+017F><U+017F>e of her hand: otherwhiles in the advantage <U+017F>he had above all her
Companions in her dre<U+017F><U+017F>e: <U+017F>o as he concluded that there was nothing under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<U+017F>o fair, nor <U+017F>o lovely as <hi>Delphire.</hi> You make me a relation of hi<U+017F>tory <U+017F>o new,
(an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled) and <U+017F>o incredible, that for my part, I can give no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
unto it. I do know very well (replied he) from whence this incredulity comes;
it is becau<U+017F>e you cannot <U+017F>ee your <U+017F>elf: for if Heaven had done you that favour, I do
not think you <U+017F>uch an enemy to truth, as to <U+017F>ay I am not in the right. I have <U+017F>een
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53527:199"/>
my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>everal times in fountains of water, replied <U+017F>he, and in <U+017F>everall gla<U+017F><U+017F>es: but I
could never find what you out of flattery are plea<U+017F>ed to tell me. Oh <hi>Delphire,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wered
he, how imperfect are tho<U+017F>e repre<U+017F>entations, and what infinite wrong they
do unto your beauty? Do you think tho<U+017F>e dead and <U+017F>en<U+017F>le<U+017F><U+017F>e things are able to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent
you? You I <U+017F>ay, who are the very life and joy of all tho<U+017F>e that have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
to <U+017F>ee you: if you have a mind to <U+017F>ee your <U+017F>elf as you are, be plea<U+017F>ed to take a
living mirrour of my pre<U+017F>enting unto you; and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure my<U+017F>elf, that if you will
daign to ca<U+017F>t your eye upon it, you will there find in your <U+017F>elf more beauties then
any tongue can tell: what is that, <U+017F>aid the Shepherde<U+017F>s, which you call a living mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?
My heart, an<U+017F>wered he. Oh <hi>Thomantes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) how fal<U+017F>e and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
are all <U+017F>uch mirrours? For as one cannot <U+017F>ee in them what one would,
but onely what tho<U+017F>e deluding mirrours plea<U+017F>e to repre<U+017F>ent; <U+017F>o there is no
a<U+017F><U+017F>urance or credit to be given to their repre<U+017F>entations, becau<U+017F>e they are only
<U+017F>uch as the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the <U+017F>oul does bid them. I do believe (an<U+017F>wered he) that the
heart does repre<U+017F>ent nothing but what is in the <U+017F>oul, and therefore you may <U+017F>ee in
mine, <hi>Delphire</hi> in her perfect beauty, becau<U+017F>e you are <U+017F>o imprinted in my <U+017F>oul, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more perfectly repre<U+017F>ented. <hi>Thomantes</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) what a lyer you
are, and how you jear me, and would laugh at me, if I had <U+017F>o little wit as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you? There is nothing <U+017F>o <U+017F>hameful to a per<U+017F>on of honour, an<U+017F>wered he, as to
be <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed in a lie: you need not fear that <U+017F>hame (replied <U+017F>he) for you know that
none can look into your heart to convince you. Actions (an<U+017F>wered he) are they
that open the doors of a heart; and you <U+017F>ee that all mine do te<U+017F>tifie unto you, how
<hi>Thomantes</hi> does love <hi>Delphire,</hi> and that he does never look with the eyes of love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other beauty but hers; and I do make this declaration unto you upon my birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
to te<U+017F>tifie that I believe Heaven gave me life only to imploy it in loving and <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you; which I do vow to do, with <U+017F>o much affection and fidelity, that I am
forced to call my <U+017F>elf your mo<U+017F>t devoted <U+017F>ervant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thomantes</hi> added unto the<U+017F>e many other expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which (for brevities <U+017F>ake)
I omit, and which <hi>Delphire</hi> did not interrupt; becau<U+017F>e, though <U+017F>he had a quick wit,
and <U+017F>ound judgment, yet was <U+017F>he <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, that <U+017F>he could not an<U+017F>wer: for the
re<U+017F>pect which <U+017F>he bore unto him as the Son of <hi>Ericanthe,</hi> the good will which <U+017F>he
already had unto him as <hi>Thomantes,</hi> the virtues and affections which <U+017F>he found in
him, and her fears to fail in her duty, did hold her in a <U+017F>u<U+017F>pen<U+017F>e of re<U+017F>olution, and
therefore <hi>Thomantes,</hi> after a while of <U+017F>ilence in expectation of her an<U+017F>wer, and when
he <U+017F>aw <U+017F>he remained <U+017F>till mute, he continued thus: I perceive, faire<U+017F>t <hi>Delphire,</hi> that
your <U+017F>ilence does menace me; and that tho<U+017F>e hopes which the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F><U+017F>e of your
eye does promi<U+017F>e me, are not very certain: but on the contrary the augure which I
might take from that black habit which you wear, does but too truly portend my
ruine. Upon this, he changed colour, and his words did die in his mouth; and
though he did offer <U+017F>everal times to fall again into his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, yet he was <U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ed
at her returning no an<U+017F>wer, that he could not <U+017F>peak.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delphire</hi> then, to ea<U+017F>e him from any longer pain, <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto him: The words
<hi>Thomantes</hi> which I heard you utter, are very like unto tho<U+017F>e which mo<U+017F>t Shepherds
do commonly u<U+017F>e unto Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es; and I will believe they were <U+017F>poken more out
of cu<U+017F>tom, then with any de<U+017F>ign: yet the re<U+017F>pect which I do ow unto you, and the
honour which you do me in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing with me, does oblige me to e<U+017F>teem them, as
coming from <U+017F>o kind a Shepherd, whom I will alwayes e<U+017F>teem and honour as I ought,
and as he de<U+017F>erves: and becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he would not have this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e continue any
longer, or go any further at this time, <U+017F>he went away unto her Companions.</p>
                     <p>Be, oh <U+017F>age Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, plea<U+017F>ed to know, that a long time before, <hi>Filintes</hi>
who is that Shepherd whom you <U+017F>ee next unto <hi>Delphire,</hi> and who is a near kin<U+017F>man
unto <hi>Thomantes,</hi> was become a <U+017F>ervant unto that <U+017F>ame Shepherde<U+017F>s, and being old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then he, he had al<U+017F>o more boldne<U+017F>s to declare him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o. But <U+017F>ome urgent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
con<U+017F>training him to leave our Town, and to take a long voyage; it <U+017F>eems Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
would favour the de<U+017F>ign of <hi>Thomantes,</hi> in taking from him this rival, who was
no <U+017F>mal mote in his eye.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Filintes</hi> then departed, full of love and full of <U+017F>orrow, and about twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
months after, returned with the <U+017F>ame love he carried away, unle<U+017F>s perhaps en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53527:200"/>
and grown bigger as his body was. But at his departure he had an opinion
that he had <U+017F>ome advantage of <hi>Thomantes,</hi> yet found at his return, what a mortal
enemy ab<U+017F>ence is unto Love: for he found the de<U+017F>ign of his rival <U+017F>o thriven, and his
own <U+017F>o bla<U+017F>ted, as any but him<U+017F>elf, would have lo<U+017F>t all hopes. Yet his generous
courage would not <U+017F>hrink at any difficulties, and therefore re<U+017F>olved a <U+017F>econd defeat:
at his return then, he renewed his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es; added new <U+017F>upplications to his old
prayers; and <U+017F>econded his old <U+017F>ervices with new ones. Briefly, he was <U+017F>o a<U+017F><U+017F>iduous,
and did <U+017F>o importune her, that though he could not win any thing upon the re<U+017F>olved
mind of <hi>Delphire,</hi> yet he rai<U+017F>ed mo<U+017F>t extream <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions and <U+017F>trong jealou<U+017F>ies in the
<U+017F>oul of <hi>Thomantes.</hi> For though <hi>Delphire</hi> did prefer <hi>Thomantes,</hi> yet the true love of
that Shepherd, would not let him be in re<U+017F>t, knowing very well, that love works
wonders, and does miracles. And from hence did proceed <U+017F>o many di<U+017F>quiets,
and <U+017F>o many torments, which the<U+017F>e two Shepherds have cau<U+017F>ed unto each
other.</p>
                     <p>And yet, although their loves were very great, and the violence of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
did daily increa<U+017F>e; yet for all this, the friend<U+017F>hip and amity that was betwixt
them did not alter: a quality which was highly e<U+017F>timable in <hi>Filintes,</hi> who was lea<U+017F>t
loved; and who<U+017F>e humour was naturally <U+017F>plenetique: and yet who could <U+017F>ubmit
him<U+017F>elf unto the laws of rea<U+017F>on. The advantage of <hi>Thomantes</hi> was great, having the
authority of <hi>Eleaman,</hi> and principally of <hi>Ericanthe,</hi> to back him: and yet the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of <hi>Filintes</hi> was not a little, having a <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter, brought up al<U+017F>o with <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthe,</hi>
who had a very great prevalency with <hi>Delphire:</hi> and indeed, it was unto
her, to whom <hi>Filintes</hi> did commonly make his complaints. At la<U+017F>t it fell out, that
this Shepherd, after he had ob<U+017F>erved upon <U+017F>everal occa<U+017F>ions how this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e
preferred <hi>Thomantes</hi> before him, and after he had made all the complaints he could,
<U+017F>eeing that he received nothing but fre<U+017F>h te<U+017F>timonies of his being not loved, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of all hope and patience, he re<U+017F>olved to make a retreat, and draw off from
a <U+017F>iege which would di<U+017F>grace him if continued. So <U+017F>eeking for an opportunity of
<U+017F>peaking to her; at la<U+017F>t finding her in a place where none could hear, he gave her this
language: You know <hi>Delphire</hi> how I have loved you; and I <U+017F>ay you know it, for your
excellent and pregnant wit cannot chu<U+017F>e but clearly <U+017F>ee it in all my actions, ever
<U+017F>ince you can remember me: you know al<U+017F>o, that coldne<U+017F><U+017F>e, nor your di<U+017F>dains, nor
my too long ab<U+017F>ence, could ever divert my affection, nor in the lea<U+017F>t degree dimini<U+017F>h
it. But now being pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, or rather oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>corns and injuries which I
daily receive from you, I come to tell you, that finding them in<U+017F>upportable, I mu<U+017F>t
quit the name of <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>Delphire,</hi> and that which neither any time nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence,
nor your rigours could do, your <U+017F>corn, which is in<U+017F>upportable to my <U+017F>pirit,
does move me unto a ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>pleen. <hi>Delphire</hi> without the lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>quiet, and almo<U+017F>t
glad of this his re<U+017F>olution, did an<U+017F>wer him extream carele<U+017F>ly; I never thought, nor
de<U+017F>ired, <hi>Filintes,</hi> that you had any mind unto that Title which now you quit; and it
is a thing <U+017F>o very indifferent unto me, that if you think there is any one among<U+017F>t my
Companions, that de<U+017F>erves it, I <U+017F>hall advi<U+017F>e you to love and <U+017F>erve her.</p>
                     <p>This cold an<U+017F>wer, and the carele<U+017F><U+017F>e manner of giving it, did <U+017F>till more offend the
courage of <hi>Filintes,</hi> and this was the rea<U+017F>on why he went away with a lowring brow,
which <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>hewed his ill <U+017F>atisfaction. But <U+017F>pleen, being a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which
blinds the judgement, he thought that no way was better to be revenged upon <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire,</hi>
then to divert the affection of <hi>Thomantes</hi> from her. And as <U+017F>ome do hope to
accompli<U+017F>h all they de<U+017F>ire, and imagine all things <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ible will come to pa<U+017F>s, <U+017F>o he
had a conceipt, that he could per<U+017F>wade him to withdraw. In order to this de<U+017F>ign
he went unto him; and after he had taken him a<U+017F>ide, Brother, (<U+017F>aid he unto him,
for <U+017F>o <hi>Eleaman</hi> would have them call each other, though they were only Co<U+017F>ens) I
come to entreat a favour from you, you ought not to deny me, becau<U+017F>e I ask it out of
the abundance of my affection, and becau<U+017F>e it is as much to your advantage as mine.
Brother, an<U+017F>wered <hi>Thomantes,</hi> you may well think that any thing which will give you
contentment, I will certainly do with as good a will as you can de<U+017F>ire it. Then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
me, <U+017F>aid <hi>Filintes,</hi> that you will do it; for unle<U+017F>s you be obliged by your promi<U+017F>e,
you will at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>tart back, and make <U+017F>ome difficulty. I will not promi<U+017F>e any
thing, replied <hi>Thomantes,</hi> till I know what it is; and you need not fear that any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53527:200"/>
can make me <U+017F>tart from doing all I can to give you contentment. A long di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
being betwixt them hereupon; at la<U+017F>t, <hi>Filintes,</hi> <U+017F>eeing he could not oblige him
by his promi<U+017F>e, he re<U+017F>olved to tell him what the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e was; Brother, <U+017F>aid he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, I de<U+017F>ire you, as the greate<U+017F>t obligation you can put upon me, that you
would quit <hi>Delphire,</hi> or at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>eem as if you did for a time; pride has huffed her
into <U+017F>o much in<U+017F>olence, as if <U+017F>he continue a little longer, <U+017F>he will render her <U+017F>elf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>upportable;
<U+017F>he thinks all men in the world were made only for her: does <U+017F>he not
pretend that all tho<U+017F>e re<U+017F>pects and devoirs, which you and I out of our free wills do
render unto her, are due by obligation? And does <U+017F>he not demand them as a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
to draw all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>he <U+017F>ees, after our example, into her po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion? She try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umps,
and is become all <U+017F>corn, both towards you and towards me: yet would I
gladly know upon what ground <U+017F>he does it. But Brother, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, the more
<U+017F>he <U+017F>ees we withdraw from her, the neerer <U+017F>he will draw to us; it is good to love,
but not to be <U+017F>laves: I have heard <U+017F>ay, that women do alwayes make much of men,
till they be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured they love them; but then they treat them no better then <U+017F>laves:
come, come, Brother, oblige me <U+017F>o far as to retire, as I am re<U+017F>olved to do; and you
<U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee her with all her <U+017F>corn, and indifferency, brought a loop lower. <hi>Thomantes</hi>
in a <U+017F>miling manner, Brother, <U+017F>aid he unto him, I am <U+017F>orry you <U+017F>hould ask me a thing
which is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible. For I do de<U+017F>ire as much as I do my own life, to give you all
full contentment; but a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf <hi>Filintes,</hi> that let <hi>Delphire</hi> treat me which way
<U+017F>he plea<U+017F>eth, I can do no other but endure it without murmur: I have no power to
withdraw my <U+017F>elf from that <U+017F>ervitude in which <U+017F>he holds me: and for my part, I do
think, all that <U+017F>ee her, are in rea<U+017F>on obliged to <U+017F>erve and adore her: for judging
others by my <U+017F>elf, I think it to be a great deffect in judgment, not to end their dayes
in <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>weet <U+017F>ervitude. Fie, fie, <hi>Thomantes,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Filintes,</hi> are you not a<U+017F>hamed of
<U+017F>uch an unworthy re<U+017F>olution? Good Brother; an<U+017F>wered <hi>Thomantes,</hi> the <U+017F>tone is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
thrown, there is no recalling it, I am <U+017F>o re<U+017F>olved upon it, that if I <U+017F>hould find in my
<U+017F>elf the lea<U+017F>t will to the contrary, I <U+017F>hould die with <U+017F>hame: but <hi>Filintes,</hi> <U+017F>aid he,
pray tell me, what is your de<U+017F>ign? To live, <U+017F>aid he, like a man of <U+017F>pirit and courage,
and not a <U+017F>lave: I can endure any thing but <U+017F>corn; but that, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, is intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
unto me. Perhaps, <U+017F>aid <hi>Thomantes,</hi> when I am more wi<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>hall take up the
<U+017F>ame re<U+017F>olution; but as I am, there is no hopes of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus ended the di<U+017F>cours betwixt the<U+017F>e two Shepherds; but the event will make
you laugh: <hi>Filintes,</hi> <U+017F>eeing he could not divert <hi>Thomantes</hi> from his re<U+017F>olution, as if
he had quite forgot all that he had <U+017F>aid unto him, or unto <hi>Delphire,</hi> he ran as fa<U+017F>t as
ever he could unto her, and be<U+017F>eeched her with all manner of prayers and <U+017F>upplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to forget and forgive all that he had <U+017F>aid; and then he addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf unto
his Si<U+017F>ter to intercide for him and make his peace: <hi>Delphire</hi> could not chu<U+017F>e but
<U+017F>mile; well, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <hi>Filintes</hi> I am contented; upon condition that you will
not believe, you have obliged me more by your return, then by your going
away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delphire</hi> had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o, but <hi>Thomantes</hi> entred, who <U+017F>eeing this reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and hearing what <hi>Filintes</hi> <U+017F>aid, was <U+017F>o amazed that he asked <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintes,</hi>
whether what he <U+017F>aw was not a dream: no, no, <U+017F>aid <hi>Filintes,</hi> it is real; but
imagine that I do as <U+017F>laves u<U+017F>e, who endeavour to break their chains but cannot. But
when <hi>Thomantes</hi> did relate unto <hi>Delphire</hi> in private, the reque<U+017F>t which <hi>Filintes</hi> made
unto him, you may imagine whether that Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e was not ravi<U+017F>hed at two <U+017F>uch
<U+017F>uddain, and <U+017F>uch different motions.</p>
                     <p>During the time that the<U+017F>e two Shepherds lived thus, I returned from the banks
of <hi>Argent,</hi> a little <hi>Rivolet,</hi> which runs into the great River of <hi>Loire:</hi> and at the
<U+017F>ame time <hi>A<U+017F>phales,</hi> (the Shepherd whom you <U+017F>ee with <hi>Filintes,</hi> and his younger
Brother) took up an humour of courting me, rather I believe, becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>hould
not be <U+017F>aid, that he was the only one in all our Town who did not love, then for any
other end. Now <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> being almo<U+017F>t alwayes in the company of his Brother <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintes,</hi>
as his friend, or perhaps as well wi<U+017F>her unto <hi>Delphire;</hi> we were almo<U+017F>t al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
together. I ob<U+017F>erved that <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> was long before he could bring him<U+017F>elf to
any certainty, and knew not upon which of my Companions he <U+017F>hould be<U+017F>tow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
imitating a Bee which flyes upon <U+017F>everal flowers before <U+017F>he fixes upon any: for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53527:201"/>
<U+017F>omtimes he would be for <hi>Delphire,</hi> another time upon <hi>Fili<U+017F>e,</hi> one while upon <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trea,</hi>
and another upon me: But at la<U+017F>t, after he had turned and returned, <U+017F>omtimes
to one, and <U+017F>omtimes to another, he fixed upon me, or at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o.</p>
                     <p>I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, that if I had been in a mind to entertain any, <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> had not
been di<U+017F>agreeable to me; for though he be pre<U+017F>ent, yet I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay, that it was
hard to meet with a Shepherd of more taking qualities then he was owner of; agile
in all manner of exerci<U+017F>es, hand<U+017F>ome in his habit, quick and nimble in his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
kind towards Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, civil towards Shepherds, affable with his familiars, and
<U+017F>o complai<U+017F>ant towards all, as it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be weary of his company: and
withal (interrupted he) one that of all the company <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea</hi> loves lea<U+017F>t. <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea</hi>
(an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he and <U+017F>miled) is not re<U+017F>olved to love all that are amiable. Then conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; Now this Shepherd (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) though I told him freely my
mind, and that he ought not to <U+017F>pend his time about a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s from which he could
expect no contentment, yet he <U+017F>till continued ob<U+017F>tinate, and hoped, that time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
which overcomes all things, might in the end melt my re<U+017F>olution, and alter my
Will; He neglected no opportunities of te<U+017F>tifying his extream affection unto me:
and becau<U+017F>e I was at all hours in <hi>Ericanthes</hi> hou<U+017F>e, out of my amity to <hi>Delphire,</hi> he
was at all hours al<U+017F>o talking to me: for being Nephew unto the <U+017F>age Pa<U+017F>tor <hi>Eleaman,</hi>
he never <U+017F>tirred out of the hou<U+017F>e, but was continually there, in as much freedom as
in his own; <U+017F>o as I had been deaf, if I had not heard him <U+017F>ay an hundred times in a day
that he loved me; and that he de<U+017F>ired no greater happine<U+017F>s in the world, then that
I would love him: his con<U+017F>tant continuance of this, made me think that indeed he
did love me: And this opinion obtained <U+017F>o much from him again<U+017F>t my re<U+017F>olution, to
permit his continuance; but <U+017F>till after <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>erved manner, as he could not be
contented with it: He <U+017F>aid, that this permitting him to love me, did as good as <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
nothing, and would never oblige me to love him again: I told him, that this
was all I could permit; only that he <U+017F>hould keep his affection to me <U+017F>o <U+017F>ecret, and
e<U+017F>pecially this permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion which I gave him, that if any came to know it, I would hold
it for revoked: That he <U+017F>hould never de<U+017F>ire any thing from me, which might in the
lea<U+017F>t manner offend my honour; and above all, that I <U+017F>hould not be troubled with
any letters from him; and many other <U+017F>uch like articles, unto which he con<U+017F>ented,
knowing, (as I think) that the refu<U+017F>al of them would rather prejudice then advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
him. But of all the<U+017F>e, none went <U+017F>o much again<U+017F>t the grain as the la<U+017F>t, which
exempted me from receiving any letters; for (<U+017F>aid he) if it <U+017F>hould be my misfortune
to be at a di<U+017F>tance from you, how <U+017F>hould I know how to let you know how I do, or
you me? Very well, an<U+017F>wered I; for <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould receive your letters, can you
hope or think that would <U+017F>end you mine? So that as to that point, the Letters
which I receive will not avail you any thing, and as for hearing from you, truly I am
<U+017F>o little inqui<U+017F>itive, that the labour would be but lo<U+017F>t in <U+017F>ending them to me.</p>
                     <p>But replied he, do you not value the contentment that I <U+017F>hould receive in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
corre<U+017F>pondency with you in this manner? and in rendring you an accompt of
my life? I <U+017F>hall know all this, <U+017F>aid I, at your return. But in the mean time, <U+017F>aid he;
in the mean time, an<U+017F>wered I, I will be contented to know you love me <U+017F>till, as you
have promi<U+017F>ed: for have you not told me that your life <U+017F>hould be alwayes <U+017F>uch as I
plea<U+017F>ed? What then, replied he, mu<U+017F>t I never hope that you will write unto me?
No, <U+017F>aid I, and more then that, never hope that I will receive any Letters from you.
This <U+017F>everity, replied he, is too great, and I prote<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid he, half angry, that do
what you can, I will <U+017F>end you <U+017F>ome Letters: and I prote<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid I, that I will never
look in them.</p>
                     <p>The rea<U+017F>on why he was <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>t in this, was becau<U+017F>e he knew that ere long he
was to be ab<U+017F>ent from me: for his Father was to <U+017F>end him upon <U+017F>ome important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
into the Province of the Romans. And indeed within a few dayes after, he
came unto me the <U+017F>adde<U+017F>t foul that ever was <U+017F>een, and looked like a pri<U+017F>oner going to
be hanged. <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea,</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto me, as <U+017F>oon as he could <U+017F>peak unheard by any) ah
<hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea!</hi> this is the la<U+017F>t day I have to live, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e you have <U+017F>ome pity upon <hi>A<U+017F>phales:</hi>
I <U+017F>eeing his face <U+017F>o changed, and his colour quite gone, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F><U+017F>e, I had <U+017F>ome
apprehen<U+017F>ions of <U+017F>ome harm he would do him<U+017F>elf, and was <U+017F>o kind as to re<U+017F>ent his
<U+017F>adne<U+017F>s: but when I asked him, why he <U+017F>poke <U+017F>o? and under<U+017F>tood that it was only
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53527:201"/>
the journey which he was to take, I could not chu<U+017F>e but <U+017F>mile. Do you laugh,
<U+017F>aid he, at that which my heart weeps? Oh mo<U+017F>t cruel woman! if Heaven do not
revenge me upon you, I <U+017F>hall not think it ju<U+017F>t. I do not laugh at your journey, <U+017F>aid
I unto him, for <U+017F>ince it di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>eth you, it <U+017F>hall not be plea<U+017F>ing unto me; but I
laugh at the di<U+017F>pute which we had <U+017F>ome few dayes <U+017F>ince, becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>eems you fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aw
your departure: could I hope, an<U+017F>wered he, that you would never be plea<U+017F>ed
at any thing which di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>eth me, I <U+017F>hould depart the mo<U+017F>t happy man, that ever
was con<U+017F>trained to be ab<U+017F>ent from her whom he adores. If you under<U+017F>tand my
words aright (<U+017F>aid I) you may go with a<U+017F><U+017F>urance that what di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>eth you, <U+017F>hall
not be plea<U+017F>ing unto me; and how, <U+017F>aid he, would you have me under<U+017F>tand them?
My meaning is, replied I, that what<U+017F>oever di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>eth you, <U+017F>o I have no intere<U+017F>t in it,
but only for the love of you, <U+017F>hall never plea<U+017F>e me. Then, continued he, becau<U+017F>e you
have no intere<U+017F>t in my departure, and becau<U+017F>e it di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>eth me, you are al<U+017F>o <U+017F>orry
for it: would you <hi>A<U+017F>phales,</hi> <U+017F>aid I unto him, and <U+017F>miled, that I <U+017F>hould conclude as
you do? I cannot tell what I would have, an<U+017F>wered he dejectedly, unle<U+017F>s it be
death, <U+017F>ince you will not <U+017F>uffer me to write unto you in my ab<U+017F>ence.</p>
                     <p>At the lea<U+017F>t I am <U+017F>ure, replied I, that I will not receive any of your Letters. Are
you <U+017F>till in that ob<U+017F>tinate humour? (<U+017F>aid he half angry) and making a <U+017F>ign unto
him by nodding my head, that it was <U+017F>o. Then I <U+017F>wear, <U+017F>aid he, by the affection
which I bear unto you, that you <U+017F>hall receive them in <U+017F>pite of your teeth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
I a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him, no, we laid a wager of it, which he <U+017F>aid he was <U+017F>ure to win.</p>
                     <p>Our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e had continued long upon this <U+017F>ubject, and had continued longer, if
his Father, who intended he <U+017F>hould depart the next morning betimes, had not <U+017F>ent
two or three times for him: he went then to his Father, from whom he received all
in<U+017F>tructions nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for his voyage: and when he was ready to depart, he called
to him an old Shepherd, who had <U+017F>erved him from his infancy: the Shepherds name
was <hi>Alindre,</hi> a di<U+017F>creet and <U+017F>ubtle man, and one who loved <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> exceedingly:
<hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> took him into his chamber, and the door being <U+017F>hut, he acquainted him
with his affection unto me, with his <U+017F>orrows to depart from me, and the extream
contentment it would be to write unto me; and becau<U+017F>e it was a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which he
de<U+017F>ired <U+017F>hould be kept <U+017F>ecret, he had made choi<U+017F>e of him among<U+017F>t all the re<U+017F>t of his
friends, to do him the office of delivering his Letters. <hi>Alindre</hi> who de<U+017F>ired nothing
more then to plea<U+017F>e <hi>A<U+017F>phale</hi> in all things, did tell him that in this and all other
his commands, neither his affection nor fidelity <U+017F>hould fail: <hi>A<U+017F>phale</hi> upon this
embracing him; dear friend, <U+017F>aid he unto him, I ever had that belief in you; and
therefore, as the thing, which of all the world is mo<U+017F>t dear unto me; I put this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your hands, conjuring you to find a way as <U+017F>oon as I am gone, that <U+017F>he may <U+017F>ee
this letter: and be <U+017F>ure, you u<U+017F>e all your ingenuity and care in the delivery of it.
The difficulty (an<U+017F>wered <hi>Alindre</hi>) will not be great; for being <U+017F>o familiar with <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi>
as I am, I can watch my time when <U+017F>he goes to <U+017F>ee <hi>Delphire,</hi> whom they <U+017F>ay
<U+017F>he loves extreamly, and ten to one but once in a day I <U+017F>hall find a fit opportunity
to give it unto her: Oh friend (<U+017F>aid <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi>) do you think <U+017F>he will receive it <U+017F>o?
No, no, friend, I would have her take it and read it, before <U+017F>he knows that it comes
from me, otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>he is of <U+017F>o cro<U+017F><U+017F>e a humour, that <U+017F>he will not take it; for <U+017F>he
has prote<U+017F>ted and <U+017F>worn that <U+017F>he would not: and becau<U+017F>e I do infinitely de<U+017F>ire to
<U+017F>hew her that my affection has more indu<U+017F>try and ingenuity to arrive at my de<U+017F>ires,
then <U+017F>he has cruelty to hinder me; I do conjure you, my dear friend <hi>Alindres,</hi> to u<U+017F>e
all the wit and ingenuity you have in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; I know you have wit enough,
and I know you love me, <U+017F>o as if you will but make it your <U+017F>tudied bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>he is not
able to defend her <U+017F>elf again<U+017F>t your <U+017F>tratagems.</p>
                     <p>To be brief, fair Shepherde<U+017F>s, <hi>Alindres</hi> took upon him the charge of two Letters,
and promi<U+017F>ed that <U+017F>ince it was a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which he de<U+017F>ired with <U+017F>o much pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
either one or both of them <U+017F>hould be read by that cruel hearted woman.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> departed with this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance; and <hi>Alindres</hi> in the interim more de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to keep his promi<U+017F>e then perhaps <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> was; after he had long con<U+017F>ulted
with him<U+017F>elf upon the matter, he re<U+017F>olved upon this <U+017F>light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eritrea,</hi> who was a very wi<U+017F>e and di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F>s, and in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort my kin<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
did make it her particular profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion to love me above all others in the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53527:202"/>
Town; <hi>Alindres</hi> who knew very well what good wil this woman bore unto me, and
that though <U+017F>he had a very good wit, yet <U+017F>he never imployed it in <U+017F>uch trifles as are
commonly u<U+017F>ed upon <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ions, he ca<U+017F>t his eye upon her, and de<U+017F>igned to make
her give me the fir<U+017F>t Letter; and the rather, becau<U+017F>e he had a great familiarity with
her long before. He went to <U+017F>ee her therefore, <U+017F>everal times, and talked with her
upon every thing, but only that <U+017F>ubject which chiefly brought him to her hou<U+017F>e: at
la<U+017F>t, he turned and winded his an<U+017F>wers and que<U+017F>tions <U+017F>o, that he made her <U+017F>elf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
and ask of <hi>A<U+017F>phales:</hi> Ah me (<U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>eemed as if he had forgot to tell
her <U+017F>omthing) my memory it <U+017F>eems is admirable good, for I came hither purpo<U+017F>ely
upon a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e which I had quite forgotten, if you had not put me into remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of it by naming <hi>A<U+017F>phales.</hi> Then <U+017F>he pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him to tel her what it was, he
began to whi<U+017F>per as if it were a bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e of confidence and tru<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>aid thus unto
her; you know <hi>Eritrea</hi> that I am a <U+017F>ervant unto <hi>A<U+017F>phales,</hi> and <U+017F>hould be very <U+017F>orry
either to do or <U+017F>ay any thing that might di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e him: but in this which I would have
you to know, I think I do not any thing again<U+017F>t his <U+017F>ervice; nay on the contrary, I
am confident that when his Spirit is free from that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which now po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es him,
he will thank me as for the be<U+017F>t piece of <U+017F>ervice I could do him: and therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eech
you, and conjure you to keep it extreamly <U+017F>ecret, until he be grown wi<U+017F>er
then now he is. And <hi>Eritrea</hi> having promi<U+017F>ed, and <U+017F>worn that <U+017F>he would, I believe
(continued the <U+017F>ubtle <hi>Alindres</hi>) you are not ignorant of the extream affection which
he bears unto <hi>Dori<U+017F>ea,</hi> for it is <U+017F>o apparent, that any who have eyes may <U+017F>ee it. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritrea</hi>
upon this <U+017F>hrugged her <U+017F>houlders, and <U+017F>eemed to be very <U+017F>orry for it; and
then he, continued, God only knows what Lectures I have read unto him about it,
and how often I have hinted unto him the inconveniences and <U+017F>orrows that would
en<U+017F>ue upon it, as wel in relation to <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea,</hi> whom if he love as he <U+017F>ayes he does, he
ought to have <U+017F>ome care of her honour and reputation; as al<U+017F>o in relation to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
it would be unto <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>eas</hi> kindred, in which <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> own Father wil have a
<U+017F>hare in re<U+017F>pect of the ancient amity that has been betwixt their two Families: but
all the<U+017F>e arguments and remon<U+017F>trances were light, and <U+017F>erved to no u<U+017F>e but to make
him more clo<U+017F>e and retired from me ever <U+017F>ince, then from any other: and I to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
him <U+017F>eem to take no notice of it, but keeps my <U+017F>elf out of his way as much as
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I can. Now at his departure, he was not contented to <U+017F>peak his mind unto
<hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea,</hi> for I know he was with her two hours together, before he went; but al<U+017F>o
hath writ Letters unto her, and left them in the hands of a Shepherd whom I know
very wel, who promi<U+017F>ed to give them unto her; but this carele<U+017F>s and ill advi<U+017F>ed
Shepherd, in lieu of performing his promi<U+017F>e. I mean giving them unto <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea,</hi> or
burning them, or at the lea<U+017F>t keeping them <U+017F>ecret, he left them loo<U+017F>ly lying upon
his table; and ye<U+017F>terday as I went to <U+017F>ee him, upon bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which I had with him,
I <U+017F>aw them lying upon the back of his chimney, where trivial Letters u<U+017F>e to be
thrown, and God knows who <U+017F>aw them as well as I: Now knowing what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you had unto <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea,</hi> what relation of kindred there was betwixt you, I
thought good to acquaint you, to the end you might u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome means to get them
out of his hands and burn them: for I am confident the di<U+017F>cretion wherewith they
were writ was no more then that wherewith they were kept: and I believe that if
they could be <U+017F>een, there would be <U+017F>omething found which concerns the reputation
of this wi<U+017F>e woman who is in no fault.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eritrea</hi> who hearkned very attentively unto this Shepherd, who was more <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
then her <U+017F>elf: Oh <hi>Alindres,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he and <U+017F>hoak him by the hand) I am exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
obliged unto you for your care of <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea:</hi> <U+017F>he is indeed the be<U+017F>t friend I have,
and I dare <U+017F>wear <U+017F>he is innocent in this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: but all this is nothing unle<U+017F>s you
tell me more, and help me to get the<U+017F>e Letters out of that Shepherds hands; The
Shepherd, <U+017F>aid he, you know very well, his name is <hi>Atis,</hi> he who has the whole
management of <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> affairs; but I dare not venture to take them: for if ever
this lover <U+017F>hould come to know it, he would never pardon the theft. Then pau<U+017F>ing
a while, he continued: yet I have a Son who has wit enough, and may do it if he
will; for being but a boy, le<U+017F>s notice will be taken of him then of me; and though
he <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>een when he takes them, they would not <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect it out of any de<U+017F>ign:
and if you will, I will <U+017F>et him a work: <hi>Eritrea</hi> who longed extreamly to have it done,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53527:202"/>
Oh good <hi>Alindres,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, let it be done withal expepedition, le<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hould be
before you; and I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea</hi> and I will not be ungrateful: How, <U+017F>aid the
crafty <hi>Alindres,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech you <hi>Eritrea,</hi> let not me be <U+017F>o much as named in the bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s;
for if <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> <U+017F>hould ever come to know it, he would never look upon me
again with a good eye: Wel, replied <U+017F>he, I wil not tel her, but wil <U+017F>atisfie the debt
my <U+017F>elf. <hi>Alindres</hi> who had already in<U+017F>tructed his Son in the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, who though
young, yet was his Fathers own Son in <U+017F>ubtilty; he <U+017F>ent for him immediately, and in
the pre<U+017F>ence of <hi>Eritrea</hi> asked him, whether he had <U+017F>o much courage as to take the
Letters which lay in the chimney of <hi>Atis,</hi> <U+017F>o <U+017F>lily as none <U+017F>hould perceive him. Yes,
<U+017F>aid he, or any thing you command me: go then, <U+017F>aid the Father, and if you be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the fact, be <U+017F>ure you do not <U+017F>ay that I commanded you. Upon this the boy
offered to go, but <hi>Eritrea</hi> called him back, to promi<U+017F>e him <U+017F>omething in ca<U+017F>e he
brought them, purpo<U+017F>ely to encourage him the more; but he an<U+017F>wered, no <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trea,</hi>
I had rather die then play the theft upon any con<U+017F>ideration then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of my Father: then he <U+017F>eemed to go about his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; but his Father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him one of the Letters before; it was not long before he returned, but
yet mea<U+017F>ured his time ju<U+017F>t according to the di<U+017F>tance of places: Father (<U+017F>aid he, and
gave him the Letter) if there had been a dozen more I could have brought them al,
but I found only this: and what is become of the other? <U+017F>aid the Father, I know
not, an<U+017F>wered the boy, perhaps <U+017F>ome took it away: tel me truly, <U+017F>aid the Father,
did you not want courage to take it? If you wil pardon me, <U+017F>aid the boy, I wil tel
you truly; and when the promi<U+017F>e was made, when I came fir<U+017F>t into the chamber,
<U+017F>aid he, I found none in it, but as <U+017F>oon as I had taken one Letter, I put it in my hat,
and was reaching at the other, one came into the room, took it from me, and threw
it into the fire. <hi>Eritrea</hi> then<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> to excu<U+017F>e him, It is no matter my little friend, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he,
<U+017F>ince it is burned, I am as well contented as if you had brought it. Oh Shepherd,
<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, I am infinitely joyed the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s has thriven thus well, and that none has
<U+017F>een the<U+017F>e Letters. And becau<U+017F>e <hi>Alindres</hi> <U+017F>aw <U+017F>he was impatient til <U+017F>he was alone,
he bad her adieu, gave her the Letter, and conjured <U+017F>ilence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alindres</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner out of her hou<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>he came to mine; as fortune was,
the hou<U+017F>e was ful of <U+017F>trangers, who came to <U+017F>ee my Father, and therefore <U+017F>he knew
not how to give me this Letter, nor acquaint me with the good office which <U+017F>he had
done for me; but I ob<U+017F>erved that <U+017F>omthing did di<U+017F>quiet her mind, though could
not imagine what it was: at la<U+017F>t, I went to her, and took my opportunity to ask
her if <U+017F>he had any news to tell me? I am infinitely de<U+017F>irous, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, to talk
with you, and it concerns you, that it be as <U+017F>oon as conveniently you can. You may
well think (<U+017F>age Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e) that this was enough to <U+017F>well me with curio<U+017F>ity.
I rid my <U+017F>elf therefore as <U+017F>oon as I could conveniently from all the Company, and
carried her into a clo<U+017F>et; and I had no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>hut the door, but <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid unto me,
ah my dear Co<U+017F>en, how careful have I been to recover this paper, out of a place
where it could not be any advantage to you; upon this, <U+017F>he gave me the Letter, and
<U+017F>aid unto me, here dear Co<U+017F>en, read it, and when you have done, I will tell you the
whole <U+017F>tory. I who had never <U+017F>een the hand of <hi>A<U+017F>phales,</hi> could not know the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
nor ever had the lea<U+017F>t thought of the wager which I had laid with him; and
to tell you truly, I never believed that this young Spirit would ever have thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: I opened it therefore, not imagining what it was, and found in it the<U+017F>e words.</p>

I am not able to expre<U+017F><U+017F>e (oh Fair and Wi<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e) my amazement at
the reading of this Letter, which by mentioning the Wager, made me know from
whence it came. Believe it, my a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment was extream, and I believe <hi>Eritreas</hi> was
no le<U+017F><U+017F>e, when imbracing her I cryed out, oh my Co<U+017F>en! what have you done? He
who gave this Letter unto you was too <U+017F>ubtle and crafty for us: How? How? (<U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he and went back a pace) what <U+017F>ubtilty and craft do you mean? for I prote<U+017F>t Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en,
I never took more care nor pains in my life, then in getting them out of the

to get it out of the place where it was; and continuing her Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, <U+017F>he told
all the whole <U+017F>tory of what <U+017F>he had done, <U+017F>o freely and innocently, that I could not
chu<U+017F>e but laugh heartily: at which <U+017F>he began to be half angry, thinking I did her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of wrong in not believing her; and becau<U+017F>e I knew that it was out of her
good will unto me, Co<U+017F>en (<U+017F>aid I unto her) I am much obliged unto you for the
pains which you have taken: but a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, that if I have offended you, <hi>A<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phales</hi>
ought to make you <U+017F>atisfaction: for you have helped him to win a Wager
which he had laid with me; and then I told her the whole pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and con<U+017F>equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made her under<U+017F>tand the <U+017F>ubtilty of <hi>Alindres;</hi> at which <U+017F>he was <U+017F>o <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed, that

how <hi>A<U+017F>phales, Thomantes,</hi> and <hi>Filintes,</hi> behaved them<U+017F>elves towards <hi>Delphire</hi> and

and by fortune tho<U+017F>e that went to <U+017F>eek it in our Sacred Groves, did find it in that
part which was neare<U+017F>t our Town: this was the rea<U+017F>on, that not only we, but all our

what place <U+017F>oever Heaven <U+017F>ent this Sacred Mi<U+017F>leto, it brought with it alwayes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of pro<U+017F>perity.</p>
                     <p>Every one therefore prepared them<U+017F>elves, according to the cu<U+017F>tom, to honour
the day; and to perform tho<U+017F>e exerci<U+017F>es which were intended; as running, wre<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
throwing the bar, and <U+017F>hooting: the young Shepherds <U+017F>pruced up them<U+017F>elves
in all their gaiety and gallantry: <hi>Filintes</hi> de<U+017F>iring to be very fine, he begged a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of <hi>Delphire,</hi> which <U+017F>he denied with the be<U+017F>t excu<U+017F>es <U+017F>he could find: but he, who
was bold enough, and thought that the greate<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ure in love was, as in hunting,
to take what one pur<U+017F>ues by force, he put his hand about the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es neck,
and took out of her head a flower made of <U+017F>ilk, which the Si<U+017F>ter of that Shepherd
had pinned there. <hi>Delphire,</hi> who thought it better to let him take it thus before all
the company, then in private, after two or three times asking: well, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what
the <U+017F>i<U+017F>ter gave me, the Brother takes from me, but <hi>Filintes</hi> went away unto his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter
to get it fa<U+017F>tned to his hat; it chanced that <hi>Thomantes</hi> was there; who knowing
the flower, and thinking that <hi>Delphire</hi> had be<U+017F>towed it upon him with her free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent,
he fell into <U+017F>uch a jealou<U+017F>ie, that a fever <U+017F>ei<U+017F>ed upon him, and that in <U+017F>o violent
a degree, that it con<U+017F>trained him to keep his bed.</p>

but <U+017F>he kept a great bu<U+017F>tle at the door, and as if it had been again<U+017F>t her will, oh what
a noi<U+017F>e do I make (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) It is no matter, <U+017F>aid I, <U+017F>eeming to take no notice of it;
upon this, opening the door, we entred into the chamber, We found him indeed,
in a very bad condition: for be<U+017F>ides the violence of his fever, which much perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, we <U+017F>aw his face all tears, which his jealous fancy had fetched from his heart.
This <U+017F>ight, though he wiped his eyes as well as he could, might very well move my
companion: for I prote<U+017F>t it moved me to much pity, not knowing what the matter
was, yet doubting that it was again<U+017F>t her that he complained; <U+017F>o as looking upon
her, my very eyes invited her to give the Shepherd <U+017F>ome comfort. And <U+017F>he with
abundance of mode<U+017F>ty and di<U+017F>cretion, went to his bed-<U+017F>ide: Alas <hi>Thomantes!</hi> (<U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he unto him) how long mu<U+017F>t our <U+017F>orrows la<U+017F>t, in grieving at your <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s? The
Shepherd then rai<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf up, as de<U+017F>irous to thank us for the favour which we
did him in the vi<U+017F>it. I am but too well in being <U+017F>ick, an<U+017F>wered he, <U+017F>ince <U+017F>uch fair
Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es daign to have a care of me. But <hi>Thomantes</hi> (<U+017F>aid I unto him) if your
<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s continue, you will cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>mall joy for the Sacred Mi<U+017F>leto. Such an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Shepherd as <hi>Thomantes,</hi> an<U+017F>wered he, can never hinder the joyes of <U+017F>o many
fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>o free, in their favours, as they care not if
all the the world do <U+017F>ee them. <hi>Delphire</hi> till now never thought that the complaints
and <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>e of this Shepherd proceeded from the flower which <hi>Filintes</hi> took from
her, and was very glad that <U+017F>he had found it out, to the end <U+017F>he might undeceive
him: but not being willing that I <U+017F>hould under<U+017F>tand any thing of this difference, <U+017F>he
<U+017F>eemed as if <U+017F>he did not apprehend it, but turned her Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e into expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of
<hi>Ericanthes</hi> <U+017F>orrows for his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, and how much all the hou<U+017F>e was troubled at it:
and afterwards told him, how every one were preparing them<U+017F>elves for the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
and pa<U+017F>times of the day, and wanted a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tants: briefly <U+017F>he told him all that <U+017F>he
could to cheer him up, and to undeceive him in the opinion which he was in that <U+017F>he
favoured <hi>Filintes</hi> more then him; yet <U+017F>o cautiou<U+017F>ly, that I could not judge that <U+017F>he
had any intere<U+017F>t in tho<U+017F>e favours <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke of. And becau<U+017F>e I was not ignorant that
this Shepherd did love her, and knew how Lovers loved privacy, I walked up and,
down the chamber, looking upon every thing in it, and <U+017F>eemed very bu<U+017F>ie in my
own thoughts, and all purpo<U+017F>ely to give them the better opportunities of private
talk. <hi>Delphire,</hi> who was very de<U+017F>irous to undeceive him, and to lo<U+017F>e no time, le<U+017F>t
any <U+017F>hould come in to interrupt, <U+017F>he bowed her <U+017F>elf nearer him: Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>Thoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him in a low voice, and with a <U+017F>miling eye) that you <U+017F>hould be
jealous? Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <hi>Delphire</hi> (an<U+017F>wered he) that you <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o kind unto <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintes</hi>
as you are? and that I loving you as I do, <U+017F>hould not be as much in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
as he? Upon this, the Shepherde<U+017F>s could not hold from laughing: Oh Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e, <U+017F>aid he, do you laugh at my mi<U+017F>ery? What hopes can I have
ever to be happy? Truly (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) I do laugh at a thing which you your <U+017F>elf would
laugh at with me, if you knew the truth: How? replied he, do you think I can
laugh to <U+017F>ee one whom I would have to love me, love another? and that I <U+017F>hould
<U+017F>ee <hi>Filintes</hi> with my own eyes trimm'd up in your favours, and not die with de<U+017F>pair?
Oh <hi>Delphire,</hi> if you think <U+017F>o of me, you do more offend me by that thought then by
the favour which you have given him: for in your favouring of him more then me,
you do only intimate that I <U+017F>hould yeild unto him in happine<U+017F>s; but by this thought
you do as good as tell me that you have an ill opinion of my love, which is an offence
<U+017F>o unju<U+017F>t, as is not to be endured, <hi>Thomantes, Thomantes,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he unto him, never
let it trouble you, but <U+017F>et your heart at re<U+017F>t, and be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that in this I have not
offended either again<U+017F>t you, or your love unto me: that which you call a Favour, was
a theft, a violent robbery, again<U+017F>t which I could not defend my <U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o many <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
witne<U+017F><U+017F>es are of it, that I need not in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon any farther clearing of my <U+017F>elf; for
my chamber was full of Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es; from whom, if you will not
believe me, you may know the truth.</p>
                     <p>Now <U+017F>ince it is thus, as mo<U+017F>t truly it is, have I not good rea<U+017F>on to laugh: No,
no, <hi>Thomantes,</hi> as long as you behave your <U+017F>elf towards me as you do, I <U+017F>hall have
more regard of your <U+017F>atisfaction then you imagine: and if this were a place fit to
chide in, I <U+017F>hould chide you for having <U+017F>o bad an opinion of that good will which I
bore unto you: but <U+017F>ince I believe your di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure proceeded only from your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53527:204"/>
I will take it as an argument of that amity which you have promi<U+017F>ed unto me.
Oh Heavens (<U+017F>aid the Shepherd and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed her hand) how near are extream con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments
in love, and extream di<U+017F>contents, unto one another? This Declaration
re<U+017F>tores that life, which my opinion would have ravi<U+017F>hed from me. But deare<U+017F>t
<hi>Delphire,</hi> may I without offence beg one favour from you, whith would compleat
my happine<U+017F><U+017F>e? Tell me what it is, an<U+017F>wered the Shepherde<U+017F>s, and if it be a thing
which depends upon me, you <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee how much I de<U+017F>ire your <U+017F>atisfaction. I mo<U+017F>t
heartily be<U+017F>eech you, <U+017F>aid he, nay I conjure you, even by your <U+017F>elf, which is the
deare<U+017F>t thing in the world unto me, that you would get back this flower, for I am
not able to <U+017F>ee it in the hands of this ravi<U+017F>her, without a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trange alteration, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>e
you <hi>Thomantes,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, that as well for your <U+017F>atisfaction as my own, I
will do all I can, and you <U+017F>hall know it.</p>
                     <p>She left him with this a<U+017F><U+017F>urance, for many Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es came in
and hindred them from farther Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. This vi<U+017F>it had a better operation upon
this Lover, then all the Phy<U+017F>ick which <U+017F>hould have been given unto him: for the
next morning, he left his <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s in his bed, and found him<U+017F>elf in perfect health.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Delphire</hi> not forgetting the Shepherds reque<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw <hi>Filintes,</hi> but
<U+017F>he u<U+017F>ed her be<U+017F>t rethorique to procure the flower, pretending that <U+017F>he would keep
it for her <U+017F>ake who gave it: <hi>Filintes,</hi> who did not repent of the robbery which he
had committed, Do you think <hi>Delphire</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) that I value this which I have got
by lawful war, no more, then to part from it without a ran<U+017F>om; what ran<U+017F>om <U+017F>aid
<U+017F>he, do you require? Some of tho<U+017F>e knots, an<U+017F>wered he, or tho<U+017F>e ribands which
you wear. I have none to give you, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he; nor I any to re<U+017F>tore, an<U+017F>wered
he, but am very <U+017F>orry that I rob'd you of no more: what more, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, would you
have taken? Your heart, an<U+017F>wered he: as for that piece of thievery, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he,
I <U+017F>hould never have required re<U+017F>titution; but the flower which you have is much
better, and I wonder you <U+017F>hould have any <U+017F>atisfaction in retaining any thing again<U+017F>t
ones will. What? (<U+017F>aid <hi>Filintes</hi>) is it again<U+017F>t your will that I wear it? Me thinks,
an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, my de<U+017F>ires of having it again <U+017F>hould intimate as much; Then he de<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me to lend him a pair of Si<U+017F><U+017F>ers; which I did, not knowing what he would do
with them; and then he took off his hat, and cut the flower in a hundred pieces,
and threw them into the fire: then (<U+017F>aid he unto me) Here take your Si<U+017F><U+017F>ers, and I
thank you, for they have helped to revenge me again<U+017F>t the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure which was
conceived again<U+017F>t me: then he ro<U+017F>e up in an angry mood, and it was a long time
before he would <U+017F>peak unto her; but it was excellent <U+017F>port to <U+017F>ee them together:
for he could not forbear from being where <U+017F>he was, and often twit her in a <U+017F>plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
way, <U+017F>till addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing his <U+017F>peech to a third per<U+017F>on; and <hi>Delphire</hi> paid him back
again in the <U+017F>ame coyn, with <U+017F>o much delight to all that heard them; that when<U+017F>oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they two were together, every one flocked unto them to hear the quirks which
they put upon each other.</p>
                     <p>This divorce la<U+017F>ted until the day when the Mi<U+017F>leto was to be gathered: and that
day he came unto her very early, <hi>Delphire</hi> (<U+017F>aid he unto her) is the heat of your
choler now pa<U+017F>t? My choler, an<U+017F>wered <U+017F>he, never began again<U+017F>t you, but perhaps
you mean your own. It may be <U+017F>o, replied he and <U+017F>miled, for <U+017F>ince I have nothing
but what is yours, my anger is yours. If you mean it <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Delphire,</hi> I fear you
do mi<U+017F>-reckon your <U+017F>elf, for I know not who can make any thing mine, unle<U+017F><U+017F>e I
will. <hi>Delphire,</hi> replied he, there are <U+017F>ome things which we have by force: Is it not
commonly <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>uch a one has a fever; <U+017F>uch a one has the hatred of every one;
and <U+017F>uch a one has abundance of mi<U+017F>ery, and yet I am confident they would not
have them: would you have me, replied <hi>Delphire,</hi> to have your anger in that way?
Not only my anger, <U+017F>aid he, but al<U+017F>o my <U+017F>oul, my heart, my affection, and my all:
but <hi>Filintes,</hi> an<U+017F>wered <hi>Delphire,</hi> take heed you do not draw a conclu<U+017F>ion from hence,
which will put you into your <U+017F>plenatique mood again. What can you alledge, <U+017F>aid
he, which can give me any <U+017F>uch occa<U+017F>ion? God defend me, replied the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F><U+017F>e
from the thought of it; but if you will give me leave, I will tell you, that <U+017F>uch
things as are forced upon one, do al<U+017F>o make one <U+017F>trive with all their power to be rid
of them; <U+017F>o as if that which I have of yours be of this quality, con<U+017F>ider with your
<U+017F>elf what conclu<U+017F>ion may be drawn from thence. Oh mo<U+017F>t cruel and di<U+017F>dainful
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53527:204"/>
Shepherde<U+017F>s, <U+017F>aid he, can you vent nothing but arguments of your <U+017F>corn and ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of me? I was in hopes this morning to have obtained a favour from you,
that I might have flouri<U+017F>hed in it under the notion of your Shepherd, but now I find
my hopes are all bla<U+017F>ted, and that you <U+017F>corn and <U+017F>light me more then ever. You
are mi<U+017F>taken Shepherd, <U+017F>aid <hi>Delphire,</hi> I never <U+017F>corned any thing that had relation
unto you; no, I do honour both you and your family: but I was forced to an<U+017F>wer
unto your a<U+017F><U+017F>ertions which you u<U+017F>ed unto me. I <U+017F>hall quickly know, replied he, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you <U+017F>peak truth; for if you do not <U+017F>corn, I <U+017F>hould be known this day as your
Shepherd; pray give me that knot which is upon your head, in te<U+017F>timony of your
good will. I am afraid, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, le<U+017F>t you <U+017F>hould cut it in pieces, as you did the flower
which you took from me. Perhaps it might run the <U+017F>ame fortune (<U+017F>aid he) if you
would take it away from me. You need not doubt, replied <U+017F>he, but if you <U+017F>hould
ravi<U+017F>h it from me, as you did the flower, I <U+017F>hould do the <U+017F>ame. What would you
think, replied <hi>Filintes,</hi> if I <U+017F>hould not let you re<U+017F>t all this day, until I have that knot?
Upon this, he put forth his hand to take it; but the Shepherde<U+017F>s being aware of him,
recoyled, and went unto <hi>Ericanthe;</hi> but <U+017F>till he followed her, and importun'd her
for this knot. No, no, <hi>Filintes,</hi> (<U+017F>aid <hi>Delphire</hi>) you <U+017F>hall not have it, unle<U+017F>s <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthe</hi>
command me. I will not receive it, replied he, upon <hi>Ericanthes</hi> command:
no, no, ungrateful <hi>Delphire,</hi> deceive not your <U+017F>elf, I de<U+017F>ire no favours from you,
but <U+017F>uch as proceed from your free and good will: I would have them to be gifts of
Love, and not tributes of obedience; upon this, he went away in a fretting fume.
And fortune was <U+017F>o aver<U+017F>e unto him all that day, as he received no contentment
from any thing he took in hand.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>Thomantes,</hi> continuing his court<U+017F>hip of this Shepherde<U+017F>s,
without the lea<U+017F>t complaint or murmure; every action about this proud Beauty,
made <hi>Filintes</hi> jealous, who <U+017F>eeing him <U+017F>o patient, and judging of things according to
his own humour, he could not imagine any one <U+017F>hould endure the cruelties of her
whom he loved with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>ilence, unle<U+017F>s he was tyed unto it by <U+017F>ome great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
<U+017F>o as he concluded very advantagiou<U+017F>ly for his rival. This opinion did tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him <U+017F>o extreamly, that one day when he was almo<U+017F>t out of his wits, he went
unto the Shepherde<U+017F>s; and though it was long <U+017F>ince he had <U+017F>poke unto her, yet at
the very fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight he acco<U+017F>ted her with this language: re<U+017F>olve with your <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ee
one of the<U+017F>e three things come pre<U+017F>ently to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e. For either I mu<U+017F>t change, or
you mu<U+017F>t change, or I mu<U+017F>t die. The Shepherde<U+017F>s returned him this faint an<U+017F>wer: for
me to change, is a thing impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible; that you <U+017F>hould die, would grieve me; and
for you to change, is of le<U+017F>s importance unto me, and depends wholly upon your
own will. Oh Heavens (cryed he out) is all this cruelty to be endured? and yet
I mu<U+017F>t love this in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible woman. Upon this, he pulled his hat over his eyes, and
went away, more tran<U+017F>ported with choller then ever he was: But as his Spirit was
quickly hot, <U+017F>o it was quickly cool for when he was in his greate<U+017F>t fury, if <hi>Delphire</hi> did
but <U+017F>peak one word unto him, he was appea<U+017F>ed, and <U+017F>eemed as if he had no memory
of tho<U+017F>e offences and wrongs at which he was angry.</p>
                     <p>All things thus far went well with <hi>Thomantes,</hi> <U+017F>o as he might well think him<U+017F>elf
one of the happie<U+017F>t Shepherds about <hi>Lignon;</hi> and I believe <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> might have <U+017F>aid
as much, had he not been ab<U+017F>ent, for he could not have <U+017F>een any Shepherd <U+017F>o much
in my favour as him<U+017F>elf: but <U+017F>ince that jealou<U+017F>ies, and by con<U+017F>equence inquietudes
have <U+017F>o ravelled their <U+017F>ouls, as I believe they enjoy but a little re<U+017F>t, and we but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more: Thus, Wi<U+017F>e Shepherde<U+017F>s, this is the cau<U+017F>e which has brought us hither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, according to the an<U+017F>wer of the Oracle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A<U+017F>phales,</hi> as I told you, before was ab<U+017F>ent; and <hi>Thomantes</hi> was con<U+017F>trained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
by the <U+017F>ame de<U+017F>tiny to be ab<U+017F>ent from <hi>Delphire,</hi> and al<U+017F>o to go into the <U+017F>ame
Province of the Romans, where <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> was already. Perhaps I <U+017F>hould be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
in relating all the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of this Shepherd, and all his laments a little before
his departure: but <U+017F>o it was, that he gave unto this Shepherde<U+017F>s of po<U+017F><U+017F>ible a<U+017F><U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of a con<U+017F>tant, and la<U+017F>ting affection; his expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions came from him with <U+017F>uch
an empha<U+017F>is, as if his heart had been in his tongue, and tho<U+017F>e that would not believe
them, had been as incredulous, as that fal<U+017F>e Shepherd who uttered them was perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and who afterwards was quite wafted away with incon<U+017F>tancy.</p>

He departed with the prayers and <U+017F>orrows of all that he left behind him. And
becau<U+017F>e <hi>Eleaman</hi> the Wi<U+017F>e Pa<U+017F>tor would needs out of his affection <U+017F>ee him take hor<U+017F>e,
and was not ignorant of the good will which his Son bore unto this Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>e,
when he <U+017F>aw him a little gone, he turned towards her, and in a je<U+017F>ting manner <U+017F>aid,
he is gone, and none of the<U+017F>e fair Maids lament him: and becau<U+017F>e as he <U+017F>poke tho<U+017F>e
words, he had his eyes upon <hi>Delphire,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>miled; which was ob<U+017F>erved by many,
and afterwards when <hi>Filintes</hi> returned, for he accompanied <hi>Thomantes</hi> a little way,
and was told of this: Oh mo<U+017F>t cruel, hard-harted, and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible woman, <U+017F>aid he,
can Heaven <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>o much inju<U+017F>tice? Does all the <U+017F>ervices which <hi>Thomantes</hi> has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
unto you, merit no more then to laugh at him when he goes away, and when
he goes away with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>orrow to part from you? But the be<U+017F>t conceipt was, he
was really offended at the injury which he thought <U+017F>he had done unto his rival.
And to <U+017F>ee the humour of this young Shepherd: as long as <hi>Thomantes</hi> was ab<U+017F>ent,
there was not a day wherein he did not put <hi>Delphire</hi> in memory of him. And at any
time when he did her any trivial <U+017F>ervice; I wi<U+017F>h, <U+017F>aid he, that this were put upon the
<U+017F>core of <hi>Thomantes.</hi> But that which is hardly credible, is, when <hi>Thomantes</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent,
<hi>Filintes</hi> vexed him<U+017F>elf, and fainted at every <U+017F>illable which <hi>Delphire</hi> uttered:
but when he was ab<U+017F>ent, he took all well, and was as patient, as if nothing could
move him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thomantes</hi> who was ab<U+017F>ent, and longed to hear how <hi>Delphire</hi> did, was pre<U+017F>ently
acquainted how <hi>Filintes</hi> was changed in his humour. This news began to gripe him
a little at the heart: and as fortune would have it, he and <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> meeting in a
<U+017F>trange Country, they contracted (as it is u<U+017F>ual) a more intimate familiarity then
ever they had before: <U+017F>o as always one of them was receiving news how <U+017F>quares
went at home. As ill luck was, tho<U+017F>e who writ unto <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> did <U+017F>end him <U+017F>omtimes
<U+017F>uch news concerning <hi>Delphire,</hi> as they fancied: and tho<U+017F>e who gave intelligence
unto <hi>Thomantes,</hi> did write of me according to their opinions, not knowing what
great familiarity there was betwixt them. They who took all for truths, and did
believe what was written. Unto <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> was written, that <hi>Filintes</hi> had <U+017F>o gained
the heart of <hi>Delphire,</hi> as now there was no room for <hi>Thomantes.</hi> And unto <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes</hi>
they <U+017F>ent word, that <U+017F>ince his departure, <hi>Androgenes</hi> was <U+017F>o in love with me,
as that I had no eyes but to look upon him; <U+017F>o as the<U+017F>e two poor Shepherds, when
perhaps they had mo<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e to be contented, they thought they had mo<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e to
complain again<U+017F>t us. They coun<U+017F>elled and con<U+017F>ulted together; and I am <U+017F>ure not
without <U+017F>omtimes talking of our changing humours. In conclu<U+017F>ion, both of them
having ha<U+017F>ted, or rather hudled up their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, that they might the <U+017F>ooner look
homeward, we heard of their return: <hi>Ericanthe</hi> expected her Son with <U+017F>uch impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency,
that <U+017F>he went as far as the Town of <hi>Boen</hi> to meet him: <hi>Delphire</hi> that day
was not well, and therefore intended not to <U+017F>tir out of her chamber. <hi>Filintes</hi> not
being able to endure that <hi>Thomantes</hi> <U+017F>hould receive <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, he came to
pray and be<U+017F>eech her by all means, that <U+017F>he would keep <hi>Ericanthe</hi> company upon
this occa<U+017F>ion, which he a<U+017F><U+017F>ured her would be very well taken, and that for his part
he would take it for a very particular obligation; and was <U+017F>o very importunate in his
de<U+017F>ires, and <U+017F>upplications, as at la<U+017F>t, he obtained that which none el<U+017F>e could: But
when <hi>Thomantes</hi> heard from <hi>Delphire</hi> her <U+017F>elf, that the favour which he received
was by the interce<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Filintes,</hi> he grew extreamly jealous at it: and upon this
rea<U+017F>on, he <U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf ever <U+017F>ince to ob<U+017F>erve and watch the actions of <hi>Filintes</hi> and
<hi>Delphire</hi> more narrowly. And <U+017F>o much the rather, becau<U+017F>e his rival was grown ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
familiar with all the Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, which <U+017F>tung <hi>Thomantes</hi> to the heart; for he
could not imagine that this familiarity could proceed from any thing but Love, and
not out of habitude: yet at the fir<U+017F>t he <U+017F>eemed to take no notice, but di<U+017F><U+017F>embled his
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion as di<U+017F>creetly as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> al<U+017F>o, who<U+017F>e head was full of that news which was written unto <hi>Thoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
concerning the affection between <hi>Androgenes</hi> and me, he al<U+017F>o made a fair <U+017F>hew,
and <U+017F>et him<U+017F>elf to be a <U+017F>py over our actions, out of which he drew no con<U+017F>equences
to my advantage. I know not how it came to pa<U+017F>s: but I being at that time in <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthes</hi>
chamber, where there was a great number of Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es,
<hi>Androgenes</hi> de<U+017F>ired to talk with me, as it is u<U+017F>ual at <U+017F>uch a<U+017F><U+017F>emblies, for every one to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53527:205"/>
addre<U+017F>s them<U+017F>elves unto <U+017F>uch as they have familiarity withall, rather then unto <U+017F>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
but becau<U+017F>e I took notice that <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> ob<U+017F>erved us, being unwilling to give
him any occa<U+017F>ion of di<U+017F>content, I turned another way, and would not <U+017F>peak unto
him; and <U+017F>ee how one is <U+017F>omtimes deceived in their de<U+017F>ign: this action being ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>A<U+017F>phales,</hi> it made him <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect all that he <U+017F>aw not, and think that all was
true which had been written concerning <hi>Androgenes</hi> and me: and the wor<U+017F>t was;
<hi>Androgenes</hi> ob<U+017F>erving how I declined <U+017F>peaking unto him in con<U+017F>ideration of <hi>A<U+017F>pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
he never <U+017F>ought for any opportunity of <U+017F>peaking unto me during all that A<U+017F><U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
but there being a great Looking-gla<U+017F><U+017F>e upon the table, which was fixed to the
wall, this di<U+017F>creet Shepherd did ca<U+017F>t his eyes into it; and as fortune was, I looked
into it at the <U+017F>ame time: <hi>Androgenes</hi> <U+017F>hrugged his <U+017F>houlders, as if he complained of
my behaviour to him, and I not utterly to di<U+017F>oblige him, did wink upon him with
one eye, which perhaps was <U+017F>ome contentment to him: but I prote<U+017F>t, it was only
out of de<U+017F>ire to hide the odd humour of <hi>A<U+017F>phales:</hi> but as ill <U+017F>uck would have it; he
took notice of all the<U+017F>e <U+017F>igns, and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing thereby that there was <U+017F>ome clo<U+017F>e cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>pondency
betwixt us, he was <U+017F>o netled, that he went out of the hou<U+017F>e, and was not
<U+017F>een all night.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you will think it <U+017F>trange, di<U+017F>creet Shepherde<U+017F>s, that <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phales,</hi>
who at their departures had <U+017F>uch <U+017F>mall <U+017F>hares in our good will, <U+017F>hould at
their returns pretend <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olutely unto them: but you mu<U+017F>t know, that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
our affections during their ab<U+017F>ence, more then whil<U+017F>t they were continually
with us; for when they were among<U+017F>t us, and <U+017F>erved us, we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed they did it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
they <U+017F>aw no greater beauties then our <U+017F>elves: but when we heard that after
they had <U+017F>een the world, and in it many beauties <U+017F>uperior unto ours, and yet kept
them<U+017F>elves con<U+017F>tant unto us, we e<U+017F>teemed their affections at a higher rate, <U+017F>o as by
our Letters to them, they knew that their ab<U+017F>ence obtained that which their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence
had denied them.</p>
                     <p>This was the rea<U+017F>on that the lea<U+017F>t favour which we <U+017F>hewed unto others, <U+017F>eeming
unto them a taking away their dues, they could not endure we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o much as
look upon any but them. If we chanced to ca<U+017F>t the lea<U+017F>t glance of an eye upon any
one, then the<U+017F>e Shepherds; or rather the<U+017F>e Tyrants, were ready to flye in our faces,
and would oblige us to <U+017F>uch a con<U+017F>traint as was intollerable: but becau<U+017F>e <hi>Delphire</hi>
and I did not like to be bani<U+017F>hed from all the world, we continued our conver<U+017F>ation,
not only with <hi>Filintes</hi> and <hi>Androgenes,</hi> but al<U+017F>o with any others that addre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
unto us; the number of which was not <U+017F>mall; and behaved our <U+017F>elves towards
them as was fitting, le<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould give occa<U+017F>ion unto any of <U+017F>peaking ill of us; which
they did take <U+017F>o ill, that after they had called a coun<U+017F>el among<U+017F>t them two, as if they
were to govern and direct us, they re<U+017F>olved to put a face of coldne<U+017F>s, and afterwards
to <U+017F>eem as if they loved <U+017F>ome others. But not knowing whom to chu<U+017F>e for <U+017F>uch a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s,
they would only <U+017F>eem to <U+017F>tand as Neuters and be indifferent; and for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu<U+017F>ion,
they came at la<U+017F>t unto down right incivility, for <U+017F>o may their behaviours
unto us be termed, <U+017F>ince they did not only leave off addre<U+017F><U+017F>es and courting us as they
were wont; but when they met us at any time in <hi>Ericanthes</hi> chamber, or any where
el<U+017F>e, they would not <U+017F>o much as look upon us. If at any time we found them in a
place where it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for them to turn away their eyes from us, it was with
<U+017F>o much <U+017F>corn, and they rendred their <U+017F>alutes in <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>dainful manner, as was
not civil.</p>
                     <p>This <U+017F>trange way of behaviour and proceeding, cau<U+017F>ed every one to take notice
of it, and almo<U+017F>t all that heard of it, did tax them with incon<U+017F>tancy and levity: but
they on the contrary, maintained that they were the <U+017F>ame they were always wont to
be, that they had not changed, but loved us and honoured us, as much as ever they
did; that it was bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s which they were con<U+017F>trained to follow, concerning the
e<U+017F>tate which belonged to their family, which did divert them, and hinder them from
imploying all their time in tho<U+017F>e trivial <U+017F>ervices which they were wont to render. <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire</hi>
and I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, oh <U+017F>age <hi>Diana,</hi> that after we had <U+017F>everal times talked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(for our fortunes were the <U+017F>ame, and required the <U+017F>ame remedies) we re<U+017F>olved,
to take all manner of excu<U+017F>es from the<U+017F>e two wavering minds, by retiring our <U+017F>elves
from all tho<U+017F>e who might give them the lea<U+017F>t umbrage; and to do it the more
hand<U+017F>omly, we took this occa<U+017F>ion.</p>

                        <hi>Eleaman</hi> and <hi>Ericanthe</hi> took great delight in <U+017F>eeing Comedies acted by tho<U+017F>e in
their own hou<U+017F>e: and <hi>Delphire,</hi> as <U+017F>he that had the be<U+017F>t wit, had commonly one of
the be<U+017F>t parts: It hapned that <hi>Delphire</hi> in the play was to tell a Shepherd that he
was never to hope for any thing in her affection: by chance <U+017F>he <U+017F>pied <hi>Filintes</hi> very
near the Theater harkning and admiring her action; and conceiving him to be the
greate<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of jealou<U+017F>ie in <hi>Thomantes,</hi> when <U+017F>he was to <U+017F>peak unto the Shepherd
in the Comedy, <U+017F>he turned her <U+017F>elf directly to <hi>Filintes,</hi> and as if he had hore a part in
the play, and <U+017F>aid thus unto him; I do <U+017F>wear unto thee Shepherd, that I can and will
<U+017F>ooner die a hundred deaths, then love thee: cea<U+017F>e all thy hopes, trouble me no
more with thy love, for Shepherd I do hate thee.</p>
                     <p>The face of <hi>Delphire</hi> being turned towards <hi>Filintes,</hi> and her eyes and ge<U+017F>tures ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
unto him, was a cau<U+017F>e, that not only the poor Shepherd knew her meaning,
but al<U+017F>o <hi>Thomantes,</hi> and almo<U+017F>t all the Spectators, which cau<U+017F>ed all eyes to be ca<U+017F>t up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, who dur<U+017F>t not before all that company let his anger appear.</p>
                     <p>A few dayes after, when we were upon the banks of the Chri<U+017F>tal River of <hi>Lignon,</hi>
and as we were pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing away the time upon the Sands by the River <U+017F>ide; <hi>A<U+017F>phales,
Androgenes,</hi> and many other Shepherds and Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, were all about me: and
I writ upon the Sand, I LOVE: <hi>Androgenes</hi> looking over my <U+017F>houlder, and <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what I had writ upon the Sand, is it I (<U+017F>aid he, and <U+017F>miled) for whom you writ
that word? Yes, an<U+017F>wered I, and I ob<U+017F>erved that <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> blushed when I <U+017F>poke
that word: but do you under<U+017F>tand, continued I, what it <U+017F>ignifies? I do under<U+017F>tand
the word, an<U+017F>wered he, perhaps not the meaning of the writer, an<U+017F>wered I, for I
mean that the Love which I bear unto you, is like the writing which you <U+017F>ee, (and
trod upon it with my foot) and which you <U+017F>hall never <U+017F>ee again. <hi>A<U+017F>phales,</hi> and all
that heard me, fell into <U+017F>uch extream laughter, which perhaps <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed <hi>Androgenes,</hi>
as much as what I <U+017F>aid unto him.</p>
                     <p>One would think, <U+017F>age Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, that the<U+017F>e two actions of <hi>Delphire</hi> and me,
<U+017F>hould have contented the<U+017F>e two <U+017F>tubborn Lovers, if at the lea<U+017F>t, this term Lovers, be
not too good for them; but on the contrary, they <U+017F>till continued their high humours,
and when<U+017F>oever they came into company, they pre<U+017F>ently began to <U+017F>ing their inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

think we ca<U+017F>t them off by rea<U+017F>on of any new affections, we retired our <U+017F>elves at the
<U+017F>ame time from all manner of conver<U+017F>ation, not upon a <U+017F>udden, le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould be

with incon<U+017F>tancy, are incon<U+017F>tant them<U+017F>elves; we had not lived above two months in
this cold re<U+017F>traint, but as if our Ice, by a contrary operation had re-kindled fire in
their <U+017F>ouls, they come and ca<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves at our feet with all manner of <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion
and prayers; but I know not whether I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, with the <U+017F>ame importunities they
u<U+017F>ed before. <hi>Filintes,</hi> and <hi>Androgenes,</hi> were the fir<U+017F>t who oppo<U+017F>ed them at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
<U+017F>aying, that their incon<U+017F>tancy was too great and gro<U+017F>s, ever to be entertained
or endured; and that if <U+017F>uch Weather-cock minds were not puni<U+017F>hed by <U+017F>ome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
corrections, there would be no faith or loyalty among<U+017F>t Shepherds. We who<U+017F>e
humours were well enough di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed never to entertain them again, did ea<U+017F>ily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent

<hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> and <hi>Thomantes</hi> came to us, we laid their incon<U+017F>tancy before them; and they
on the contrary, to <U+017F>hew that no cau<U+017F>e is <U+017F>o bad but will find <U+017F>ome maintainers, they
u<U+017F>ed all the arguments and rea<U+017F>ons they could, to ju<U+017F>tifie them<U+017F>elves, affirming that
they were not incon<U+017F>tant, and asked what incon<U+017F>tancy was, and within what terms
and limits it was confined, when it was made a rule, or rather a Law, and then main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that they did never break that Law. This di<U+017F>pute went <U+017F>o far, that in the end,
being wearied with their importunate prayers, we all re<U+017F>olved together to addre<U+017F><U+017F>e
our <U+017F>elf unto the Oracle for a deci<U+017F>ion of the controver<U+017F>ie; by who<U+017F>e an<U+017F>wer we

our accu<U+017F>ers had ca<U+017F>t upon us; for otherwi<U+017F>e it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible any humane under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>hould come to the knowledge of the truth, which is now put into doubt: the
artifice of tho<U+017F>e who have done the wrong is great, and they have <U+017F>o gilded over
rotten rea<U+017F>ons with flouri<U+017F>hing arguments of eloquence, as it is a very hard matter
to <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>imple and pure face of truth, but by the oppo<U+017F>itions and an<U+017F>wers of tho<U+017F>e
that are oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed.</p>
                                 <p>We do <U+017F>ee, and know al<U+017F>o very well, that we who have hitherto made it our whole
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and <U+017F>tudy, to love well, and not to <U+017F>peak well, are by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of tho<U+017F>e whom we have <U+017F>erved, driven to defend our <U+017F>elves by words. It is a
very hard matter for us to <U+017F>peak well, that which we have <U+017F>o perfectly and <U+017F>o religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly
ob<U+017F>erved; in as much as none ought to meddle in that mi<U+017F>tery and trade
which they have not learned, and of which they have not made profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion: and,
oh our ju<U+017F>t Judge, is it not very hard, that we who have made it our whole profe<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to love well, and not to <U+017F>peak well, <U+017F>hould now be driven to that which is not our
profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and to u<U+017F>e words to verifie our actions, to which we referred all our elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and rethorique. This con<U+017F>ideration makes us extreamly doubt the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of
this enterpri<U+017F>e, knowing very well, that we have to do with per<U+017F>ons, who quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto us, have more <U+017F>tudied to <U+017F>peak well without loving, then love well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<U+017F>peaking: now all the arms which we are to u<U+017F>e, are only words, which being
their own, and in which they are exerci<U+017F>ed and skilful, mo<U+017F>t certainly they know
better how to u<U+017F>e them then we; and therefore have a very great advantage of us,
unle<U+017F>s our ju<U+017F>t Judge by her prudence, and <U+017F>oundne<U+017F>s of judgment, do balance the
<U+017F>incerity of our naked rea<U+017F>ons, again<U+017F>t the gilded glo<U+017F><U+017F>es, and well <U+017F>peaking of our
adver<U+017F>aries: and upon this confidence, we take the boldne<U+017F>s to pre<U+017F>ent our rea<U+017F>ons
plainly unto you, and as briefly as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly we can.</p>
                                 <p>But when all is well con<U+017F>idered, what kind of accu<U+017F>ations, (oh my friend <hi>A<U+017F>pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>)
are tho<U+017F>e which they charge upon us? Had they blamed us for loving too much;
had they accu<U+017F>ed us of being tran<U+017F>ported with too much violent affection: had they
<U+017F>aid that, we go beyond the limits of Love; had they complained that the exce<U+017F><U+017F>e of
our pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion makes us trouble<U+017F>ome, or in<U+017F>upportable in our continual addre<U+017F><U+017F>es, the<U+017F>e
accu<U+017F>ations, might perhaps have had <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hadow of likelyhood; and we <U+017F>hould
have found a hard task to di<U+017F>charge our <U+017F>elves of <U+017F>uch objections. But that they
<U+017F>hould accu<U+017F>e us that we <U+017F>hould not Love tho<U+017F>e whom none can look upon, without
adoration! Is not this, to mock us, and tho<U+017F>e (if I may <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o) that hear them?
Can they <U+017F>ay <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> does not love, who<U+017F>e affection <U+017F>urmounted <U+017F>o long an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence?
If ab<U+017F>ence be called the Death of Love, what <U+017F>hould one <U+017F>ay of that Love
which is not dead after <U+017F>o long an ab<U+017F>ence, but that certainly it is immortal? Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
then is the love of <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> unto <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea;</hi> Immortal is that of <hi>Thomantes</hi> unto
the fair <hi>Delphire,</hi> who have not only re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted ab<U+017F>ence, but al<U+017F>o the rigours of that
fair one, which perhaps had been in<U+017F>upportable unto any other: length of time,
which they <U+017F>ay ruins and rots the mo<U+017F>t la<U+017F>ting thing, never <U+017F>hook his con<U+017F>tancy; no
nor any mon<U+017F>ters of difficulties which he met with, nay even impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities, were not
able to <U+017F>top him in his de<U+017F>igned cour<U+017F>e: Oh Gods! who does not know that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes</hi>
hath loved the fair <hi>Delphire</hi> even in her Cradle? at an age when <U+017F>he was not
capable (if I may <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o) of knowing either to love, or cau<U+017F>e love? And can it be
imagined that <hi>Thomantes</hi> <U+017F>hould now fall off, and not love her, when her eyes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
all that they daign to look upon, and ca<U+017F>t their rayes on? Who can have <U+017F>een
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53527:207"/>
this <hi>Thomantes</hi> overcome all the rigours and <U+017F>corns of <hi>Delphire;</hi> abide the length of
time; <U+017F>urmount all difficulties, and believe that the <U+017F>ame <hi>Thomantes</hi> <U+017F>hould not
love her, when this fair Mon<U+017F>ter of Beauty <U+017F>eemed pliable to his will and de<U+017F>ires?
Truly the<U+017F>e accu<U+017F>ations are as far from any common <U+017F>ence, as they are from rea<U+017F>on
and truth; and there is no other an<U+017F>wer to be given unto them, but this, that there
is no di<U+017F>puting again<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e that will deny principles: and no more ought I again<U+017F>t
tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons who make the<U+017F>e oppo<U+017F>itions, who yet do fill Heaven and Earth with
their complaints again<U+017F>t us, and will by force have us confe<U+017F>s that we do not love
them.</p>
                                 <p>They will needs take upon them to know what we do, better then we our <U+017F>elves:
Love is an act of the will; and is there any <U+017F>o clear <U+017F>ighted, as can <U+017F>ee my will better
then my <U+017F>elf? But as humane nature is more apt to believe the bad then the good, <U+017F>o
<U+017F>hould we but once tell <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea,</hi> that we do not love them, oh how
pre<U+017F>ently would they believe us? But if we <U+017F>hould tell them, and tell them again, a
thou<U+017F>and and a thou<U+017F>and times that we do infinitely love them, they would pre<U+017F>ently
<U+017F>ay it was not true. Why <U+017F>hould you not believe us in the one as well as in the other?
But we (and it is no <U+017F>mall argument of that love which you deny to be in us) if you
once tell us that you do love us, we pre<U+017F>ently believe it, and never make the lea<U+017F>t
doubt of the truth; and from whence proceeds this ea<U+017F>ie faith and belief? Even from
love; from love I <U+017F>ay, which makes us believe, that truth as well as all other virtues is
in the per<U+017F>on loved, <U+017F>o con<U+017F>equently in you. But the<U+017F>e fair ones would never confe<U+017F>s
that we loved them, but alwayes denied it, and now they tax us with incon<U+017F>tancy.
This la<U+017F>t injury (my dear <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi>) is an argument for us, for from their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mu<U+017F>t be concluded, that we do love them now; for they confe<U+017F>s that we did not
love them heretofore, and by <U+017F>aying that we are incon<U+017F>tant, they <U+017F>ay, that we do
love now: in this <U+017F>ence, fair Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es, we <U+017F>hould agree with you, were it not
that Love (who forced this truth from your own mouths again<U+017F>t your wills) will not
let us confe<U+017F>s, that we did not love you before: but on the contrary, we do <U+017F>ay, and
maintain, that we did love you, and do love you, and ever <U+017F>hall love you: and that
never was affection more perfect then the affection of <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> and <hi>Thomantes.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Now the main argument they have again<U+017F>t our affection, is, that our actions have
not given <U+017F>ufficient te<U+017F>timonies, that we love them: Con<U+017F>ider, (oh mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t Judge)
con<U+017F>ider I be<U+017F>eech you, upon what a <U+017F>andy foundation this charge is built, and how
quickly it will fall to the ground: when our actions and behaviours to them were all
fire, and full of impatiencies, then they charged us that we did not love them; when we
<U+017F>aw this way would not prevail, nor per<U+017F>wade them to believe the truth of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we had recour<U+017F>e unto the contrary: we put on a garb of coldne<U+017F>s, and became
all patience; but they forgetting the judgment they had before given, do now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e
us of want of love more <U+017F>harply then before. What <U+017F>hould we do, if to our
mi<U+017F>-fortune two contraries do work the <U+017F>ame effect upon their unju<U+017F>t <U+017F>ouls: if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heat nor cold will te<U+017F>tifie our Love, what can we do? Yet the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations,
or rather contradictions, do put us unto abundance of pains: not that they who do
<U+017F>ee and weigh every thing with a <U+017F>ound judgment, can ever enter into any doubt of
us: but <U+017F>ince there are more of tho<U+017F>e who are inclined to judge ill of others, then of
tho<U+017F>e who hold an even <U+017F>cale of judgment, it mu<U+017F>t en<U+017F>ue, that the greater part of men
will blame us: and which is wor<U+017F>t of all, or which is indeed in<U+017F>upportable, the<U+017F>e fair
ones may nouri<U+017F>h a <U+017F>tini<U+017F>ter opinion of us in their <U+017F>ouls, although we never courted
any thing with more de<U+017F>ires, then to per<U+017F>wade them of the contrary: and therefore
though we know very well that we ought in all other things to yeild unto them; yet
in this, we are con<U+017F>trained to contradict them, and bring the matter unto the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of another; which we would not have to be taken as any defect of love or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect,
but rather for exce<U+017F>s, and height of affection, which tran<U+017F>ports us beyond all
rules of duty. In this exce<U+017F><U+017F>e, we have <U+017F>everal times de<U+017F>ired, that <U+017F>ince they do
charge us with incon<U+017F>tancy, they would fir<U+017F>t agree that heretofore we did love them,
and afterwards that they would pre<U+017F>cribe unto us tho<U+017F>e limits in which a Lover ought
to keep him<U+017F>elf within compa<U+017F>s of this con<U+017F>tancy, to the end one may judge, as by a
<U+017F>traight rule, whether the line be right, and come no neerer one <U+017F>ide then another;
and <U+017F>o, oh our ju<U+017F>t Judge, it may appear whether we be incon<U+017F>tant or no. The Gods
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53527:207"/>
are they who have <U+017F>ent us unto you; and the Gods are they will in<U+017F>pire you with a
<U+017F>pirit of right judgment. But in the mean time we do require and conjure the God
of Love, to take away all incredulity out of the <U+017F>ouls of the<U+017F>e fair ones, which makes
them condemn our actions, which truly if they were different from what they were
wont to be, it was not out of any alteration of will, but urgent affairs which was
the cau<U+017F>e, and which hindred us from paying the tribute of tho<U+017F>e trivial <U+017F>ervices we
were wont to render, and in which we could not imploy our time without much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
unto our e<U+017F>tates. Has not all <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons their proper actions; does not nature
teach us, that flowers are proper for the <U+017F>pring, and fruits for <U+017F>ummer; if trees
<U+017F>hould bloom all the year, they would bloom in vain; and why <U+017F>hould not the <U+017F>ame
be <U+017F>aid of us? If we <U+017F>hould be alwayes bearing tho<U+017F>e little flowers, which are proper
and natural at the beginning of Love, we <U+017F>hould not produce <U+017F>o much fruit in the
<U+017F>ummer of Love, but <U+017F>hould in a manner derogate from the Law of Nature. But
perhaps, that which induceth them to this opinion, is the more familiar conver<U+017F>ation
which we have with others, then we were wont to have; and that this conver<U+017F>ation
proceeds from <U+017F>ome Love we bear unto tho<U+017F>e we are familiar with all: truly if a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ought to be a <U+017F>alvage per<U+017F>on, and without communication, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, they
have rea<U+017F>on; but <U+017F>ince the name of Lover does not <U+017F>ignifie any Wilde Man, or
Wolf, or Tyger, or Barbarian, we <U+017F>ee no rea<U+017F>on or ground they have for their
opinions.</p>
                                 <p>All the<U+017F>e doubts, and all the<U+017F>e judgements which they have conceived of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
mu<U+017F>t receive a deci<U+017F>ion from you, <U+017F>age Shepherde<U+017F>s; we mean tho<U+017F>e doubts
and judgments which they have in di<U+017F>-advantage of our affection: for of all other
things whereof they blame and accu<U+017F>e us, as we are <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> and <hi>Thomantes,</hi> we
dare not <U+017F>o much as whi<U+017F>per the lea<U+017F>t complaint again<U+017F>t them; but will with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and re<U+017F>pect <U+017F>uffer what they plea<U+017F>e: but when they accu<U+017F>e us as we are Lovers,
then we are forced to open our mouths, not to accu<U+017F>e or complain again<U+017F>t them, but
to <U+017F>igh, as tho<U+017F>e do whom exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive pain torments above their <U+017F>trength: otherwi<U+017F>e
we could <U+017F>ay; that when they charge us with incon<U+017F>tancy, they them<U+017F>elves are the
cau<U+017F>e of our change, and <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eek out for <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>ons to excu<U+017F>e it: and <U+017F>hould
urge that <U+017F>o many <U+017F>ervices paid and received, did not de<U+017F>erve, that <hi>Filintes,</hi> during
the ab<U+017F>ence of <hi>Thomantes,</hi> <U+017F>hould be entertained in his place; nor <hi>Androgenes</hi> in the
room of <hi>A<U+017F>phales:</hi> that the favours which both tho<U+017F>e received during our ab<U+017F>ence,
would afford us ample matter and cau<U+017F>e to accu<U+017F>e them: that the news which was
writ unto us from all <U+017F>ides, was enough to make us believe it. And becau<U+017F>e they
<U+017F>ay that a woman neither can nor ought to hinder any from loving them; <U+017F>o it be
with all requi<U+017F>ite di<U+017F>cretion, re<U+017F>pect and honour: we ask your judgment, oh our
mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t Judge, upon the<U+017F>e four que<U+017F>tions; fir<U+017F>t, whether <U+017F>he who permits many to
love and <U+017F>erve her, do keep her <U+017F>elf within compa<U+017F>s of the Laws of Con<U+017F>tancy? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
if this plurality of Lovers be allowed unto women, whether may it not be as
well allowed unto men? Thirdly, whether the Laws of Con<U+017F>tancy do ordain that a
Lover <U+017F>hould flye the <U+017F>ight of all other Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es? And la<U+017F>tly, what are the
terms and limits of this Con<U+017F>tancy, <U+017F>o much talked of by all, and <U+017F>o little known unto

but a little, will never be weary of talking: doe but ob<U+017F>erve with what a torrent of
words he argues, not with rea<U+017F>ons, but with di<U+017F>-rea<U+017F>ons, if I may coyn the word.
And though upon the <U+017F>ame con<U+017F>ideration (I mean, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea,</hi> and I, do not

yet I will not, as well becau<U+017F>e that were to abu<U+017F>e the patience of our Judg,
and all that hear me; as becau<U+017F>e all their arguments are grounded upon <U+017F>uch <U+017F>imple
foundations, and glo<U+017F><U+017F>ed over with <U+017F>uch thin covers, as the fal<U+017F>ity of them are ea<U+017F>ily

it not in obedience unto the command of our ju<U+017F>t Judge.</p>
                                 <p>To begin then, What do you mean <hi>Thomantes,</hi> by all this talk of your affection?
You who <U+017F>ayes you are accu<U+017F>tomed to Love without <U+017F>peaking, as we are to <U+017F>peaking
without love? What do you mean, I <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>ince you do confe<U+017F>s that if <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea</hi> and I do
but <U+017F>ay once that we love you, you will believe us for ever? Ah Shepherd, <U+017F>ince we
have been <U+017F>o accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>peaking, what do you complain of? Why are you
not both <U+017F>atisfied? To what purpo<U+017F>e did you make addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to the Oracle, and
trouble this A<U+017F><U+017F>embly with <U+017F>o many words, <U+017F>ince we have been <U+017F>o accu<U+017F>tomed to
<U+017F>peaking it? But, oh ju<U+017F>t Judge, I perceive the <U+017F>trength and <U+017F>ubtilty of his argument;
he dares not directly <U+017F>ay, that we are accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>peaking it; but only, that we
are accu<U+017F>tomed, as much to <U+017F>ay that we love, and yet do not love, as they are to love,
and yet not <U+017F>peaking it; and becau<U+017F>e that they have not been accu<U+017F>tomed to love, it
con<U+017F>equently follows that neither have we been accu<U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>peaking it: and in
this <U+017F>ence they are in the right; for it is very hard to <U+017F>peak of a thing which they do
not know, witne<U+017F>s all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Thomantes,</hi> in which there are not more words
then contradictions. But to give them <U+017F>ome <U+017F>atisfaction, let us confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that they
cannot <U+017F>peak well upon this <U+017F>ubject, becau<U+017F>e if they loved heretofore, as they <U+017F>ay
they did, they loved without <U+017F>peaking it, and that now they do not love, they are
yet con<U+017F>trained to <U+017F>peak: well, we will allow this; and now <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
are you contented? You may be, at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ince you are allowed what you ask;
but what's all this to our difference? Nothing at all; nor is it any proof that they do
love us: for it might perhaps be available, if men, I mean men of their age, did guide
them<U+017F>elves by rea<U+017F>on, then one might infer from hence <U+017F>omthing of what they <U+017F>ay:
but for them, who do all things at hazard, out of humours, and nothing according to
the right rules of rea<U+017F>on, what can one infer from hence, but that then their humour
was <U+017F>uch and now is quite different? But, <U+017F>ay they, why <U+017F>hould they then take <U+017F>o
much paines? To which we an<U+017F>wer, who can find the rea<U+017F>on of that which has no
rea<U+017F>on? I <U+017F>ay, it was either out of ob<U+017F>tinacy, or to deceive, or out of ambition of the
name of a Lover without any effects, or out of <U+017F>ome wor<U+017F>e, or more pernitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igne.
What rea<U+017F>on can be expected from per<U+017F>ons that are unrea<U+017F>onable? But (<U+017F>ay
they) we do know, that we do love: is there any that knows our own wills and
minds better then our <U+017F>elves? Oh mo<U+017F>t, ju<U+017F>t Judge, there is no que<U+017F>tion but others
may know them better; can any judge aright who<U+017F>e Spirits are prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed with
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion? What likelyhood is there that the<U+017F>e Shepherds can give any <U+017F>ound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon a thing that concerns them<U+017F>elves. But we who are without pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and
are unconcerned in any thing which concerns them, we judge <U+017F>oundly. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
cannot tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>ee <hi>Adra<U+017F>tes,</hi> better judge of his madne<U+017F>s then him<U+017F>elf? And to

                                    </gap> the very <U+017F>ame things, in one minute? O Gods! (cry they out) that
humane nature <U+017F>hould be apter to believe the bad <U+017F>ooner then the good: certainly
they mean, the natures of men, and particularly of <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>phales:</hi> as for
our parts, we neither believe nor unbelieve, but what is fit <U+017F>o to be; and to <U+017F>hew
that it is <U+017F>o, we do confe<U+017F><U+017F>e unto you, that if you tell us you do not love us, we do
believe it; for commonly every one believes what they de<U+017F>ire. Moreover we do
know by experience, that you cannot love: when you tell us that you do love us, we
do not believe it, becau<U+017F>e we know all men are lyers, which is a mi<U+017F>tery in Love which
we are ignorant in, and cannot do it. But all your actions do belie your words. And
when you tell us any thing to your own advantage, we give no credit thereunto, for
we know that you u<U+017F>e to flatter your <U+017F>elves: when it is to your di<U+017F>advantage, we do
believe it, knowing very well that then it is true: and therefore you may <U+017F>ee that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53527:208"/>
our belief is grounded upon rea<U+017F>on, and that which you <U+017F>ay of u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                                    </gap> is untrue.</p>
                                 <p>But, oh ju<U+017F>t Judge, here is a fine piece of o<U+017F>tentation: the Love, <U+017F>ay they, which
is in us, does make us believe, that you <U+017F>peak true: and <hi>Thomantes,</hi> if you believe
<U+017F>o, why are you not a<U+017F><U+017F>ured that I do not love <hi>Filintes,</hi> nor <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea, Androgenes,</hi>
<U+017F>ince we have <U+017F>o often told you <U+017F>o? But to relate all their contradictions would be
too tedious; I will briefly an<U+017F>wer unto tho<U+017F>e objections which have weight in them;
it mu<U+017F>t needs be (<U+017F>aid they) that if we did not love you heretofore, and now you call
us incon<U+017F>tant, you do as much as <U+017F>ay, that we do love you: Shepherds, without <U+017F>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our thoughts, either of love or hatred, we called you incon<U+017F>tants; as much to <U+017F>ay
that you had changed your lives; and in that your incon<U+017F>tancy is indubitable: and
that which we do charge you withal, you do not deny before all this A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, <U+017F>o as
we are not obliged to prove a thing which is not put in doubt; and you never needed
to excu<U+017F>e the change with that <U+017F>hallow argument which you alledged, that having
u<U+017F>ed all actions of fire, and finding we did not believe them to be <U+017F>parks of Love, you
had recour<U+017F>e unto actions of Ice; for be<U+017F>ides that this argument is mo<U+017F>t ridiculous,
there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of alledging it, <U+017F>ince you do know very well in your own <U+017F>ouls,
that all the<U+017F>e flames and fires whereof you <U+017F>peak, are meerly imaginary, and only to
glo<U+017F>s over your Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. And it is no wonder at all that we <U+017F>hould not believe
them, <U+017F>ince they are but only flouri<U+017F>hes, and <U+017F>eeming<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> as if you did love us. And is
there any doubt of it, <U+017F>ince for all your Ice and cold fits, you have made addre<U+017F><U+017F>es,
and courted others before our faces. Is not the voice of the people, the voice of
God? Would you have us give our own eyes, and our own ears, the lye, and not
believe when every one <U+017F>ayes it, and when we <U+017F>ee it by your actions? We never
courted any (<U+017F>ay they) but only out of a de<U+017F>ire to per<U+017F>wade them: ah Shepherd,
you have confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed the truth without a rack; it is very true Shepherd, you did never
court any, but to per<U+017F>wade us that you did love us; but it was to per<U+017F>wade only, and
not to love us: Alas we knew this ambition in you long <U+017F>ince, and if we did not, yet
now we do; and it is better to be late wi<U+017F>e then never.</p>
                                 <p>But what a mo<U+017F>t delicate excu<U+017F>e they have to cover their changing? If our actions
and behaviours (<U+017F>ay they) were different from what they were wont to be, it was
becau<U+017F>e multitude of bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s and urgent occa<U+017F>ions did divert us: Then <hi>Thomantes,</hi>
if you any time came unto me, it <U+017F>eems it was only becau<U+017F>e you had nothing el<U+017F>e to
do, and know not how to trifle away your time any where el<U+017F>e: oh how much am I
beholding to you? Am I not infinitely indebted, and can never come off without <U+017F>ome
great recompence? But, mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t Judge, I be<U+017F>eech you look upon the<U+017F>e Fathers of
great families, who have the whole charge of all the e<U+017F>tate and hou<U+017F>e upon their
<U+017F>houlders? How? their hou<U+017F>e? Nay of all the communaltie, or rather of the
whole Republique of the <hi>Gaules:</hi> oh Heavens! how great are their imployments?
And what a <U+017F>in it were again<U+017F>t the publique good to di<U+017F>turb them, or make them
lo<U+017F>e one minute of time? Indeed, you Fathers of families without children, and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
without any bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, we do agree with you, that you could not imploy the
time which you <U+017F>pent in tho<U+017F>e trivial court<U+017F>hips, as you call them <U+017F>ince tho<U+017F>e mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nits
were <U+017F>o pretious, and u<U+017F>eful to the publique, better then you did; but did you
not imploy that time with us which you <U+017F>pent in the particular conver<U+017F>ations, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities
which you had with other Shepherde<U+017F><U+017F>es? Why did you come to us when
you had nothing el<U+017F>e to do? Why <U+017F>hould we receive you when all other company
excluded you? For had it not been <U+017F>o, we <U+017F>hould never have <U+017F>een you. If you be <U+017F>o
full of bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, let Love alone: for Love is a Deity <U+017F>o great, that it is an injury unto
him to offer that time unto him which remains after the <U+017F>ervice of the other Gods:
he requires the fir<U+017F>t offerings and the be<U+017F>t of things, and if any remain, then offer
unto the other Dieties: do you think he will be contented with the refu<U+017F>e and dregs
of devotion? And out of this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e you may gather <hi>Thomantes,</hi> that it is true,
as to others, every <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on has its proper actions, but not to Love; for in Loves Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
Trees do Bloom and bear fruit all at once. Do you not <U+017F>ee, that Love makes
the young, as wi<U+017F>e as the old; and old ones as very fools as the young? You may <U+017F>ee
that there is no di<U+017F>tinction of ages with him, but all of an age; did you never ob<U+017F>erve
that the mo<U+017F>t tender Flowers of Love, are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>weet fruits? For what are hopes but
flowers, and hopes excel all other contentments, which one can have out of Loves
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53527:209"/>
Garden. Oh <hi>Thomantes!</hi> ignorant in Love <hi>Thomantes;</hi> know that the Fruits of
Love are Flowers, and his Flowers, Fruits: for there is alwayes contentment in
hopes, and hopes are renewed by contentments; and therefore it is that the Orange-tree
is given for an Embleme of Love, becau<U+017F>e it bears his fruit and his flower to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                                 <p>You <U+017F>ee mo<U+017F>t ju<U+017F>t Judge, how little the<U+017F>e prtended Lovers do know what Love
is; and they have good rea<U+017F>on to de<U+017F>ire you would let them under<U+017F>tand what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy
is; for being <U+017F>o ignorant in Love, it is no wonder they <U+017F>hould be al<U+017F>o igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in it; andyet, as ignorant as they are, they will maintain that they for<U+017F>ooth,
have ob<U+017F>erved all the Laws of Con<U+017F>tancy to a tittle, though if they be con<U+017F>tant, it is
by chance and hazard, not out of any re<U+017F>olution or de<U+017F>ign. But if they were conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the <U+017F>evere Throne of Love, and were asked who gave them permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to
call them<U+017F>elves Lovers, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ume unto them<U+017F>elves a title <U+017F>o honourable, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lea<U+017F>t duties of a right Lover, what could they expect but a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>evere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment
for u<U+017F>urping a name <U+017F>o much above their merit?</p>
                                 <p>Now as it is ordinary for tho<U+017F>e that are guilty of any vice, to de<U+017F>ire that all others
may be of the <U+017F>ame die, to the end they them<U+017F>elves may not be upbraided, they
propound four doubts, ayming by the fir<U+017F>t, to tax us; by the <U+017F>econd to excu<U+017F>e them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves;
and by the two la<U+017F>t, to be in<U+017F>tructed in what they are very ignorant. We
<U+017F>hould return them <U+017F>uch an an<U+017F>wer, as they de<U+017F>erve, were it not unto you, our Judg,
that they addre<U+017F>s their queries, and in which we be<U+017F>eech you, to inform them; not out
of any hopes to amend them for the future, but to let every one <U+017F>ee, how far they are
out of the right way. And in as much as a great blunder is made about <U+017F>ome letters
which were written unto them, we be<U+017F>eech you, oh our Judge, to command that
tho<U+017F>e Letters may be produced; for by their own confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion they were written only
upon common fame, and not as known truths: what then? mu<U+017F>t every thing, that
is taken up in the <U+017F>treets be believed as true? Oh <hi>Thomantes!</hi> if <U+017F>uch reports may pa<U+017F>s
for truths, I could tell you <U+017F>trange tales of your new affections, unto <U+017F>everal other

was not this example <U+017F>ufficient for you to do the like. And whereas you <U+017F>ay that

and fidelity, as that they never found any failer in us, nor any remarkable fault.
For my part, I began to love <hi>Delphire</hi> before <hi>Thomantes</hi> had any eyes to look upon
her: and <hi>Androgenes</hi> <U+017F>erved <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea,</hi> when <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> by his incon<U+017F>tancy <U+017F>hewed
him<U+017F>elf weary of that glorious <U+017F>ervice. This fir<U+017F>t affection like to the elde<U+017F>t <U+017F>on, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erves
the greate<U+017F>t portion: and this la<U+017F>t of <hi>Androgenes,</hi> as a <U+017F>urvivor and a worthy
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>or de<U+017F>erves the e<U+017F>tate; and though one of us was the fir<U+017F>t, and the other the
la<U+017F>t, yet both of us have ever <U+017F>ince we began lived in <U+017F>uch great ob<U+017F>ervance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect,
that we have patiently born all tho<U+017F>e favours, which before our eyes were done
unto the<U+017F>e two incon<U+017F>tant weather-cocks. I mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s that <U+017F>pleen has <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

whether in my greate<U+017F>t fury, I expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed any action which was not all love? As <U+017F>oon
as ever <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t her eye upon me, I returned immediately unto my duty; and what
can this <U+017F>ignifie, but that my affection was <U+017F>tronger then her rigour? And <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
<U+017F>eeing <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea</hi> prefer <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> before him, he continued <U+017F>till with <U+017F>o much di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
and fidelity, as is a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trong argument that nothing could divert him from
this love and faithful <U+017F>ervice. They <U+017F>ay that the dropping of water by continuance

thought, when without rea<U+017F>on we <U+017F>aw the<U+017F>e two Weather-cocks obtain recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in lieu of tho<U+017F>e puni<U+017F>hments which they de<U+017F>erved, that we mu<U+017F>t think to fight
and <U+017F>trive before we mu<U+017F>t look to overcome, and groan a long time under pain and
travel before we tryumph: but now we mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s that two things do extreamly
a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>h us; the one is to <U+017F>ee the<U+017F>e two incon<U+017F>tants, tryumph before they travelled:
and the other is, that we cannot overcome the rigour of the<U+017F>e cruel ones, after <U+017F>o
much travail, and <U+017F>o long a combate: and nothing does <U+017F>trike us into <U+017F>o much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as the preten<U+017F>ions (not to <U+017F>ay pre<U+017F>umptions) that <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi>
have to hope, nay ask as their dues, to be loved by the<U+017F>e two fair ones; for if ever
love had any cau<U+017F>e to revenge the wrongs which are done unto him, it is again<U+017F>t
them they ought to let drive all the arrows of his ju<U+017F>tice, and make them exemplary
unto all <U+017F>uch as abu<U+017F>e the name of Lovers. I am a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed <hi>Thomantes,</hi> that after
you had <U+017F>o many favours from <hi>Delphire,</hi> the lea<U+017F>t of which was enough to fix the
heart of <hi>Mercury;</hi> that yet, as if they had never been done unto you, you <U+017F>hould
be full of mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>ts, full of reproches, and never <U+017F>atisfied: I cannot chu<U+017F>e but admire
<hi>A<U+017F>phales,</hi> that when you went away, you went and was not loved; and that when
you returned, you <U+017F>hould be in full po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>eas</hi> favour: was it not <U+017F>trange,
that meeting her eyes, and <hi>Androgenes</hi> in a gla<U+017F>s, you <U+017F>hould forget <U+017F>o many favours
received, which could not be merited by you, nor any per<U+017F>on in the world? But the
greate<U+017F>t wonder of all is, that after you both had committed <U+017F>uch high crimes, crimes
which in Love are impardonable, you <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till dare to ask and pretend unto the
<U+017F>ame favours, and the <U+017F>ame graces which you had <U+017F>o ungratefully di<U+017F>dained. I am
even ravi<U+017F>hed with admiration to <U+017F>ee you di<U+017F>pute with them, and que<U+017F>tion who is in
the wrong; but the wonder of all wonders is, that you dur<U+017F>t be <U+017F>o impudently bold
as to enquire of the Oracle, and to <U+017F>ee with what confidence you pre<U+017F>ent your <U+017F>elves
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53527:210"/>
before a Judge to demand ju<U+017F>tice. For if ju<U+017F>tice be done unto you, what le<U+017F><U+017F>e can
you expect, then to be bani<U+017F>hed from all places within the Dominions of Love; or
rather condemned unto all puni<U+017F>hments that ungrateful wretches do de<U+017F>erve. The<U+017F>e,
oh ju<U+017F>t Judge, are the faithful Lovers, who after they were even loadned with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and graces, did not only ungratefully fall off from tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervices, in which
they ought to have continued until death; but have even <U+017F>corned tho<U+017F>e whom they
ought to have adored; nay more, they came unto that height of ingratitude as to
<U+017F>candal them, and contrive infamous Libels and Songs again<U+017F>t them: can you ever
think that the<U+017F>e fair ones will ever endure to look upon you again without blu<U+017F>hes! O
ye good Gods, in what an age do we live? Mu<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>in and wrong inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
not only e<U+017F>cape puni<U+017F>hments, but pretend unto recompences, and rewards?
Fie, fie, unfaithful Lovers; leave it unto <hi>Androgenes</hi> and <hi>Filintes,</hi> to ask for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
and rewards, for it is only we, that by the Laws of Love de<U+017F>erve them: and
we do prote<U+017F>t here before all this Company, that if <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>phales</hi> be not
puni<U+017F>hed for their ingratitudes and infidelities; and if on the contrary <hi>Filintes</hi> and
<hi>Androgenes</hi> do not receive recompence and wages for their affection and fidelity,
then there is no hope that within the Dominions of Love, any wrong or crime will
ever be puni<U+017F>hed, or any benefit or virtue rewarded, <U+017F>ince the<U+017F>e highe<U+017F>t degrees of

of Love: but a ba<U+017F>tard, not legitimate, and yet almo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>eperable. We do <U+017F>ee

which by the <U+017F>ages are called Renewings of Love: but yet it is to be under<U+017F>tood, it

                                 <p>The<U+017F>e things being long debated, and <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly con<U+017F>idered by us, unto whom the

their actions <U+017F>hewed a mo<U+017F>t exact ob<U+017F>ervance of all tho<U+017F>e duties requi<U+017F>ite in real Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
And in as much as impunity of crimes, and good actions unrewarded, are
cau<U+017F>es of ruine in all E<U+017F>tates and Republiques; We do ordain, by virtue of the power
which is given unto us, that all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervices which unto this day <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phales</hi>
have rendred under the notion of Lovers and Servants, unto <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F><U+017F>ea,</hi>
and that all the pains and inquietudes, which they have <U+017F>uffered in loving
them, be taken as nul, and as if they had never been; not pretending unto any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
or gratification for the future. And on the contrary, we do ordain, that
the <U+017F>ervices which <hi>Filintis</hi> and <hi>Androgenes</hi> have rendred unto <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea,</hi>
and all the pains, patience, and inquietudes, which they have <U+017F>uffered in loving and

of right they ought. Yet notwith<U+017F>tanding, <U+017F>ince repentance does almo<U+017F>t by force
exact a pardon, We do ordain, that if <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>phales,</hi> do really repent of
their crimes, and would love and <U+017F>erve <hi>Delphire</hi> and <hi>Dori<U+017F><U+017F>ea</hi> a new, they <U+017F>hall be
obliged to receive and entertain them as new Servants and Lovers, who from this
day forward do begin to <U+017F>erve them, and to <U+017F>hew their merits. And as to the four
queries, which were put by <hi>Thomantes</hi> and <hi>A<U+017F>phales,</hi> we do <U+017F>ay by way of an<U+017F>wer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fir<U+017F>t, That a Shepherde<U+017F>s may without any offence unto con<U+017F>tancy, <U+017F>uffer and
permit, but not <U+017F>eek nor de<U+017F>ire, to be <U+017F>erved and courted by many. Unto the <U+017F>econd.
That this plurality of <U+017F>ervants not <U+017F>ought to nor de<U+017F>ired, but <U+017F>uffered only, does not
allow a Lover to have many Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es, unle<U+017F>s (which is not likely) they be <U+017F>uch as
are only <U+017F>uffered, and not de<U+017F>ired nor courted. Unto the third, That both the
he and the <U+017F>he Lover, ought to live among<U+017F>t all, but unto one only; imitating in this
fair fruit upon a tree, which is looked upon and admired by many, but ta<U+017F>ted only
by one mouth. As to the la<U+017F>t, that he does go beyond the limits of con<U+017F>tancy, that
does any thing which may offend the per<U+017F>on loved.</p>
                                 <p>And to the end that for the future, <U+017F>uch an ignominious ignorance among<U+017F>t
Shepherds, may not be upon the banks of the River <hi>Lignon.</hi> We do will and ordain,
that the afore<U+017F>aid que<U+017F>tions and re<U+017F>olutions be written by <hi>Sylvander,</hi> under the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
