            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVery Bra<U+017F>s Cut, or Print, is called a Table; and the <U+017F>aid Prints or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, are twenty four, and have their re<U+017F>pective Numbers <U+017F>et at the Foot of the Table, or Print, on the corner that is outmo<U+017F>t, and again<U+017F>t the Readers right hand. Each particular Figure is al<U+017F>o numbred, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <U+017F>et over its Head, and the <U+017F>everal parts of each Figure, are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by Letters of the Alphabet, for the ea<U+017F>ier finding. To compare therefore, the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with the Tables, I <U+017F>hall teach you by an Example or two. In Chap. 8. page 9. line 21. The word <hi>Coronalis,</hi> is marked with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi rend="sup">a</hi>; to which Letter, looking at the end of the <U+017F>aid Chapter, you find <hi rend="sup">a</hi> T. 15. f. 3. a a a. <U+25A1> intimating that you mu<U+017F>t turn to Table 15. Figure 3. and that part of the Figure which is marked a a a. which repre<U+017F>ents the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Suture of the Skull: The Mark <U+25A1> <U+017F>hews that the former Citation is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Again, in the next line of page 9. by the word <hi>Lambdoides,</hi> you find Letter <hi rend="sup">b</hi>, to which looking at the end of the <U+017F>aid Chapter, you find <hi rend="sup">b</hi> f. 4. b b. <g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> to teach you that in the 15 Table foregoing, Figure 4. and on that part of the Figure marked b b. you <U+017F>hall find the Suture of the Skull called <hi>Lambdoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:</hi> and this mark <U+25A1> after b b. <U+017F>hews again that the Citation is ended. Again, in the <U+017F>ame line, by the word <hi>Sagittalis,</hi> you find Letter <hi rend="sup">c</hi>, to which turning at the end of the Chapter, you <U+017F>hall there find <hi rend="sup">c</hi> f. 3. b b. f. 4. a a. intimating that in Figure 3. of the forenamed Table 15. and in that part of the Figure which is marked b b. Al<U+017F>o in Figure 4. of the <U+017F>ame Table, on that part which is marked a a you <U+017F>hall find the Sagittal Suture de<U+017F>cribed. The mark <U+25A1> <U+017F>hews the Citation is ended.</p>
            <p>Note that where you find not among the Directory Letters, T. for Table, that Figure belongs to the fore-mentioned Table. Al<U+017F>o you are to take notice that between two Citations, you <U+017F>hall find this mark <U+25A1>.</p>
            <p>Finally. He that would make his mo<U+017F>t advantage by the u<U+017F>e of this Book, <U+017F>hould, having been pre<U+017F>ent at <U+017F>ome Anatomical Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections of the whol Body; <U+017F>tudy the Tables fir<U+017F>t, with their Explanations on the oppo<U+017F>ite Pages; and then read the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Riolanus,</hi> and compare it all along with the Tables, which may be be<U+017F>t done, if the Tables be bound up by them<U+017F>elves, <U+017F>o as to lie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen alwaies while he is reading the re<U+017F>pective Chapters, referring to each Table.</p>

               <p>Proper Matter, taken Generally, is double; the one for Generation, the other for Nouri<U+017F>hment; the Bones are made of the Seed by con<U+017F>ent of al Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itians.

               <p>The matter of Nouri<U+017F>hment is al<U+017F>o two fold; Remote, and Neer: Remote, is Blood, by which al the Parts of our Body are nouri<U+017F>hed: Neer, is the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row<note place="margin">Nouri<U+017F>hment.</note> contained in the Cavity of the Bones, or a Marrowy Juyce <U+017F>hut up in the Spongious Bones.</p>

               <p>This <U+017F>tructure is called a Joynt, the Nature of which, is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted among<U+017F>t Anatomi<U+017F>ts; <U+017F>ome contending that the touching of two bones one with another, makes a Joynt; others, be<U+017F>ides touching, ad motion. So that it is the movable touching of two bones, which makes a Joynt.</p>
               <p>If Motion be removed from the Definition of a Joynt, <hi>Galens</hi> Doctrine may ea<U+017F>ily be defended. He con<U+017F>titutes two kinds of Articulation; <hi>Diarthro<U+017F>is,</hi>

               <p>The bones are knit together by <hi>Articulations,</hi> and <hi>Symphy<U+017F>es: Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is the knittings, or touching of two bones; the differences of which are <hi>Diarthro<U+017F>is,</hi> and <hi>Synarthro<U+017F>is;</hi> the one hath evident Motion, the other Ob<U+017F>cure, or none at al; and therefore the differences of each, are equal: but the one, for example <U+017F>ake, is called <hi>Enarthro<U+017F>is Diarthrodes,</hi> with a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t Motion; the other <hi>Enarthro<U+017F>is Synarthrodes,</hi> with an Ob<U+017F>cure Motion;<note place="margin">The common <U+017F>pecies of which are. 1, Enarthro<U+017F>is.</note> Judg the like of the other differences.</p>

                  <hi>Enarthro<U+017F>is,</hi> is when a large, and long Head, goes into a deep Cavity; which <U+017F>eeing it is common both to <hi>Diarthro<U+017F>is,</hi> and <hi>Synarthro<U+017F>is,</hi> we wil give an example of them Both.

e<U+017F>pecially in the Multitude of <hi>Epiphy<U+017F>es,</hi> and de<U+017F>ectof <hi>Apophy<U+017F>es,</hi> therefore I thought it wel worth the while, to ad the Bones of Infants, to the Bones of men grown up, that the difference between them may apear more evidently, for this compari<U+017F>on makes much to take away the differences among<U+017F>t Anatomi<U+017F>ts; and to unty the difficult knots, you <U+017F>hal find in <hi>Galens</hi> Doctrine of the Bones.</p>
               <p>That this O<U+017F>teology, was known to <hi>Galen,</hi> is manife<U+017F>t by various places in him; in which he declares the Bones of Infants, in his Book of the formation of the Child<note place="margin">Is Ancient.</note> in the Womb, he de<U+017F>cribes the Head of the Infant, In the fir<U+017F>t book <hi>De <U+017F>emine,</hi> he treats of the Teeth of Infants, but before <hi>Galen, Hippocrates,</hi> was a diligent <U+017F>tudier and ob<U+017F>erver of this O<U+017F>teology; as his divine monuments of the Nature of Children, and of their breeding Teeth witne<U+017F>s.</p>

               <p>They begin to pa<U+017F>s out of the Gums about the <U+017F>eventh Month, <U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>ooner if the Nur<U+017F>es Milk be very hot. Some few have Teeth when they are borne as, <hi>Cneus Papyrius Carbo</hi> and <hi>M. Curtius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They do not break out altogether, but by degrees, in two years <U+017F>pace; and the<note place="margin">At what time they apear.</note> upper Teeth u<U+017F>ually, come out <U+017F>ooner then the lower: fir<U+017F>t of al the Cutters, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards two Grinders, then the Dog Teeth; the breeding of which, is mo<U+017F>t pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Children.</p>
               <p>When Children have twenty Teeth, then they u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>ay, they have al their Teeth; neither indeed have they more, before they are three or four years of Age.</p>
               <p>But when Anatomi<U+017F>ts <U+017F>ay, that there is only twenty Teeth contained in the Gums, They do not tel you where the other Eight or twelve re<U+017F>ide; neither doth<note place="margin">Where the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Teethly.</note> it <U+017F>eem like a truth, that new Teeth <U+017F>hould be bred after the other are formed, and lie hid in the Gums.

               <p>Their generation is two-fold; one in the Womb, the other without the Womb;<note place="margin">Their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for in the Womb the Teeth are formed with the other parts, but are imperfect.

Birds are; but it grows hard by degrees, and is parted in the middle, into three or, four Rots.</p>
               <p>Under the<U+017F>e Teeth, in every hole, is <U+017F>ubjected the Seminal matter of another Tooth, a Membrane pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing betwen them; which whil<U+017F>t it is fermented by the formative faculty, and growing up, it expels the former. This <U+017F>econd matter thus included with a membrane, hath deceived many Anatomi<U+017F>ts, which thought the Teeth con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted of two Parts; and that other Part of the Tooth, was an <hi>Epiphy<U+017F>is</hi> of the Root: therefore <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius,</hi> and <hi>Columbus,</hi> held the Teeth in Children, ought not to be pulled out by the Roots, but tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>ly to be broken off, as thinking that a new Tooth grew up from the <U+017F>ame Root, which could never be, if the former were pulled up by the Root.

Before I <U+017F>et about my Anatomical work I thought good to premi<U+017F>e certain general Precepts, which are the foundations of Anatomy, and wil give great light to our proceeding.</p>
               <p>The Body of man is con<U+017F>idered by Anatomi<U+017F>ts as compo<U+017F>ed of many<note place="margin">How Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ts Con<U+017F>ider the Body of Man.</note> Parts, which they examine Limb by Limb, and by a diligent Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection, they divide the whol Body, into its <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Parts. They divide it fir<U+017F>t into three grand Parts, Containing, Contained, and Impelling; that is into the Parts, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and Spirits. But in the Anatomical di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of a dead Body, the Humors<note place="margin">Its Parts.</note> and Spirits, are not con<U+017F>idered, the Speculation of which belongs to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iology, only the Sollid Parts are regarded, which are either <U+017F>uch as make, or <U+017F>uch<note place="margin">Sollid Parts how many fold.</note> as contain Humors and Spirits or the in<U+017F>truments of Motion, which is the Chief Action of a living Creature, for which it was made. The <U+017F>ollid Parts are <U+017F>imilar or di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar. They are called <U+017F>imilar Parts becau<U+017F>e they are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>imple, from<note place="margin">Similar Parts what how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> which, as from a principle, the di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar Parts are compo<U+017F>ed. The <U+017F>imilar Parts according to Anatomi<U+017F>ts are Bones, Cartilages, Ligaments, Membranes, <hi>Fibres,</hi> Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Fle<U+017F>h, Fat. The<U+017F>e are found almo<U+017F>t in al Compound and di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar Parts, and the Corpulency of the Parts is formed of them. The Hairs, and Naills are excrements of the external Parts: Therefore an Anatomi<U+017F>t ought to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49866:20"/>
be wel in<U+017F>tructed what the<U+017F>e <U+017F>imilar Parts are, that when he <U+017F>earcheth out the <U+017F>tructure of the organical parts, Limb by Limb, he may know the Fundamentals of this <U+017F>tructure.</p>
               <p>1. A bone is a part of the Body, mo<U+017F>t cold and dry, Terre<U+017F>tial; and therefore<note place="margin">1. A Bone.</note> harde<U+017F>t, that <U+017F>o it may prop up the other parts of the body.</p>
               <p>2. A Cartilage, or Gri<U+017F>tle, is not <U+017F>o hard as a bone, which in Old Men <U+017F>omtimes<note place="margin">2. A Cartilage.</note> degenerates into a bone: The Cartilages are placed about the extremities of the bone, to ea<U+017F>e them in their Motion; <U+017F>ome are found <U+017F>eparated from the bones, as the Cartilages of the inferior Jaw, in the Articulation of the <hi>Claviculae,</hi> in the <hi>Sternum,</hi> in the Articulation of the <hi>Tibia</hi> to the Thigh; be<U+017F>ides the Cartilages of the <hi>Larinx,</hi> Wind-pipe, and <U+017F>uch as are placed to prop up other <U+017F>oft Parts, as the No<U+017F>trels, and Ears.</p>
               <p>3. A Ligament, or bond, is a part which binds the bones together, being of a<note place="margin">3. Ligament.</note> middle <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, between a Cartilage, and a Membrane; <U+017F>ofter than a Cartilage, harder than a Membrane.</p>
               <p>4. A Membrane, Skin, or Coat, is very <U+017F>oft, and <U+017F>ubject to dilation. It is the<note place="margin">4. Membrane.</note> covering of other parts, or the Receptacle of <U+017F>omthing; as the Stomach, Bladder of <hi>Gal:</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> being a hollow body, it receiving <U+017F>omthing, it may be called <hi>Tunica,</hi> a Coat; If it Embrace and cover a <U+017F>ollid body, it is propperly called <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. A <hi>Fibrae</hi> is like a threed <U+017F>tretched over a Membrane, or Interwoven there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,<note place="margin">5. Fibra.</note> to <U+017F>trengthen it: and becau<U+017F>e of its various Scituation, it is called <hi>Right, Oblique,</hi> and <hi>Tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e;</hi> not only to help the Membrane, but al<U+017F>o to <U+017F>trenghten it. Every <U+017F>ort of <hi>Fibres,</hi> is thought to perform a <U+017F>everal action; as the <hi>Right,</hi> to draw to; the <hi>Tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e,</hi> to retain; and the <hi>Oblique,</hi> to expel. Which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions notwith<U+017F>tanding, ab<U+017F>olutely depend upon the inbred faculty of the Part; which as it hath a violent dilation, <U+017F>o hath it a willing, and Natural contraction, and is helped in the<U+017F>e by the <hi>Fibres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>A vein,</hi> is a Membranous Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, round and hollow, allotted to contain<note place="margin">6. A Vein.</note> Blood, and di<U+017F>tribute it for the Nouri<U+017F>hment of the whol Body.</p>
               <p>7. An <hi>Artery</hi> is a Membranous Channel of the <U+017F>ame Nature, but <U+017F>omthing<note place="margin">7. Artery.</note> harder, and thicker; ordained for the containing and Di<U+017F>tributing of the Arterious blood: The original of both which, <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> thought was from the heart; but wi<U+017F>er Phy<U+017F>itians, hold the beginning of the Veins to be in the liver; but of the Arteries in the heart.</p>
               <p>8. A <hi>Nerve</hi> is a Channel made to carry animal Spirit; and becau<U+017F>e this <U+017F>pirit is<note place="margin">8. Nerve.</note> mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtil, therefore the Cavity is <U+017F>o <U+017F>mal, that it is not di<U+017F>cernable.</p>
               <p>9. The <hi>Fle<U+017F>h</hi> is the foundation of organical, and di<U+017F><U+017F>imilary Parts, where bone<note place="margin">9. Fle<U+017F>h.</note> is wanting, and makes up the chief Part of our bulk. The fle<U+017F>h is in <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, <U+017F>oft and thick; made of blood alone, compacted together, and wel concocted, if it be red; but of blood, and Seed, if it be white.</p>
               <p>A four-fold <U+017F>ort of fle<U+017F>h, is ob<U+017F>erved in the Parts; <hi>Vi<U+017F>cerous,</hi> and <hi>Mu<U+017F>culous,</hi> both of them very red; <hi>Membranous,</hi> and <hi>Glandulous,</hi> both of them white. For every <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the bowels is called Fle<U+017F>h, or <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> The thicker <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance of certain Membranes, which are the containers of <U+017F>omthing, which by dilating and contracting their bodies, they attract, retain, and expel, are al<U+017F>o called Fle<U+017F>h, or a Fle<U+017F>h-like <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. The thick, and <U+017F>pongy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the <hi>Glandulae,</hi> is called Fle<U+017F>h; but e<U+017F>pecially the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Mu<U+017F>cles de<U+017F>erves the Name of Fle<U+017F>h.</p>
               <p>10. The Fat although it appear not til the whol body be formed, and when the<note place="margin">10. Fat.</note> Child is big, and grows to the Parts; yet becau<U+017F>e in the compo<U+017F>ition of organical Parts, it often concurs to make up the bulk, it is Numbered among<U+017F>t the <U+017F>imilar Parts. Fat is the thinne<U+017F>t <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of blood, Fat, and Oyly, <U+017F>weating out through the tender Coats of the Veins, and hardning between the Membranes: It is two-fold, according to <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle;</hi> Soft, and external; Hard and internal. The one is Grea<U+017F>e, The other Suet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49866:21"/>The<U+017F>e three <U+017F>imilar Parts; <hi>Bones, Cartilages,</hi> and <hi>Ligaments,</hi> <U+017F>hal be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, as they are <U+017F>hewed in a Carca<U+017F>s, from top to Toe, after we have <U+017F>hewed the Mu<U+017F>cles; becau<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>o joyned together, that one cannot be <U+017F>hewed without another.</p>
               <p>But I de<U+017F>ire al <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>tudious in Phy<U+017F>ick, fir<U+017F>t to be wel acquainted in the O<U+017F>teology or Hi<U+017F>tory of the dry bones in the Skeleton of a Man, before they come to the in<U+017F>pection of a Carca<U+017F>s; for <U+017F>o they wil the better under<U+017F>tand the whol anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the di<U+017F><U+017F>ection, and find out the rea<U+017F>on of my other <hi>O<U+017F>teology</hi> in the bones of Carca<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>The Re<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>imilar Parts <U+017F>hal be <U+017F>hewed <U+017F>everally in the explication of the di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar Parts, <U+017F>eeing of the <U+017F>imilary Parts afore<U+017F>aid, viz. <hi>Bones, Cartilages, Ligaments, Membranes, Fibres, Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Fle<U+017F>h</hi> and <hi>Fat,</hi> the Bulk, or Material <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the di<U+017F><U+017F>imilar Parts, is made up, and therefore you <U+017F>hal hear <U+017F>imilary Parts often mentioned, in the explication of them; howbeit, in <U+017F>ome places they exi<U+017F>t apart, no waies joined, or united unto others, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titute an Organ; but are con<U+017F>idered with reference to their Particular u<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>But they concur together, and are united one with another, in organical Parts,<note place="margin">Organical Parts, what?</note> that they may perform their various Offices: for the effect of which, they are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into four orders: For in every Organ there is the principal Part by which the Action is performed: Another, without which the Action cannot be done: A third, by which the action is pre<U+017F>erved. But in every Organ, the principal Part ought to be <U+017F>imilar and proper to it, <U+017F>uch as is not found in another Organ. But this <U+017F>imilar Part cannot perform its action alone, unle<U+017F>s it be helped by others; and therefore the concour<U+017F>e and Union of <U+017F>imilary Parts is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. Wherefore, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Movable action, belongs truly, and poperly to an Organical Part; and none unle<U+017F>s it be alteration, belongs to a <U+017F>imilar Part; which out of the compo<U+017F>ition of the Organical, hath only u<U+017F>e, which notwith<U+017F>tanding, it contributes to perfect the action of the Organical.</p>
               <p>More over, organical Parts according to the dignity of their action, are divided<note place="margin">How many.</note> into <hi>Principal,</hi> and <hi>Admini<U+017F>tring.</hi> They are called principal, which <U+017F>upply the whol body with matter and faculty: Phy<U+017F>itians hold them to be three; the <hi>Liver, Heart,</hi> and <hi>Brain: Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> held but one principal Part of the body, <hi>viz.</hi> The Heart, which is King and Ruler of al others. The re<U+017F>t of the Parts Mini<U+017F>ter, and are <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient to the principal. According to the various compo<U+017F>ition of the Organical they are divided into compound, more compound, and mo<U+017F>t compound: For the Finger is compound; the Hand, or Foot, more compound; the Limbs, are mo<U+017F>t compound.</p>
               <p>But that we may <U+017F>eek out the <U+017F>tructure of eath Part exactly; we mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve<note place="margin">What is to be ob<U+017F>erved in each Part.</note> the <hi>Name, Sub<U+017F>tance, Temperature, Original, Scituation, Quantity, Number, Figure, Color, Connexion, Communion, Action,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g><U+017F>e.</hi> Connection differs from communion; for Connexion is the <U+017F>ticking of one Part to anther, of one or more Parts by which they depend; it is <U+017F>omtimes taken for the Original of the part it <U+017F>elf, and yet the Original of <U+017F>ome Parts is di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from Connexion: But communion is either univer<U+017F>al, with Parts remote and neer, which is done by Veins, Arteries, and Nerves, by intervening of which, al the Parts have community with one another; or Particular, when <U+017F>ome Particular Part communitates its <U+017F>elf to <U+017F>ome neer, or remote Parts, and <U+017F>o the Gal communicates it <U+017F>elf by the Biliar pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ages to the Liver, and the Gut <hi>Duodenum:</hi> The Reins, and Bladder have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the <hi>

               <p>SEeing my de<U+017F>ign and intent of handling Anatomy, doth not con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in a bear and<note place="margin">The nece<U+017F><U+017F>ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of it.</note> <U+017F>imple comtemplation of the Parts of the Body, but is al<U+017F>o referred to the u<U+017F>e of Medicine; before we come to the di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of the body of man, we wil de<U+017F>cribe in a few words the Legitimate and natural conformation of the Body of Man when it is alive, which is the ba<U+017F>is whereby we judg of the Sickne<U+017F><U+017F>es and imperfections of Men or Women: this was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary of Old in buying of Servants, in joyning Men and Women in Marriage that they might have Children, and in chu<U+017F>ing <U+017F>elect Men for Soldiers. And this knowledg is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary even to this day; for in <U+017F>ome <hi>Mona<U+017F>teries</hi> <U+017F>uch as de<U+017F>ire to lead a Religious life, the <hi>Phy<U+017F>itian</hi> views them Naked from the Crown of the Head, to the Sole of the foot; and notes their re<U+017F>piration, and pul<U+017F>e, and voice in <U+017F>inging. This is done in buying Slaves in divers Countries, and al<U+017F>o in buying Hor<U+017F>es; and al<U+017F>o Nur<U+017F>es are exactly viewed by Phy<U+017F>itians for the education of Children, I mean the Children of Princes.</p>

               <p>As for that which belongs to Sex, Man-kind is twofold: Male and Female. The Latin<note place="margin">1.

               <p>The <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Boby in Man ought to be fle<U+017F>hy not Fat; firm and <U+017F>ollid, not<note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>Chap. 11.</hi> Of a Tendon.</head>
               <p>A Tendon is the lea<U+017F>t Part of a Mu<U+017F>cle, by which we bend and move the bones. It is thought to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of a Nerve, and a Ligament mixed together; <U+017F>o as that a Tendon is not found, unle<U+017F>s it be in that Part of the Mu<U+017F>cle where it is affixed to the Parts moved.</p>
               <p>But a mans Eyes (if he wil beleeve them) tels him, that they are from the fir<U+017F>t for<note place="margin">Original.</note> mation, and that they are the cheife<U+017F>t Part of the Mu<U+017F>cle, and take their beginning where the Mu<U+017F>cle begins, and are di<U+017F><U+017F>eminated through its whol Body. if it be a Nervous Tendon in the beginning, <U+017F>uch it is in the end; if it be like <U+017F>mal <U+017F>trings at beginning, they are united to forme the Tendon afterwards. Such Tendons tho<U+017F>e Mu<U+017F>cles have which perform <U+017F>trong actions, in bowing and extending, and tonical motion; as in the <U+017F>uperior and inferior Limbs, and in the back to uphold the Trunk of the body. The re<U+017F>t of the Mu<U+017F>cles, as they are fibrous at the beginning, <U+017F>o they are at the end.</p>
               <p>The hard and <U+017F>tiff Tendons have much Fat about them to <U+017F>often them, that they may the ea<U+017F>ier be moved; and therefore tho<U+017F>e <hi>Fibres</hi> di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed among<U+017F>t the Fle<U+017F>h, are nothing el<U+017F>e but the Tendon divided, and the Tendon nothing el<U+017F>e but the <hi>Fibres</hi> united; and therefore a Tendon is either compact and <U+017F>olid, or el<U+017F>e divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Fibres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Al<U+017F>o Tendons are <U+017F>ollid or plain, or Membranous or round, or <U+017F>hort or long. If they are Nervous at the beginning of the Mu<U+017F>cle, <U+017F>o they are at the end. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are Nervous at the end of the Mu<U+017F>cle, though the Head of it be Fle<U+017F>hy.</p>
               <p>The hardne<U+017F>s of a Sollid, long and Membranous Tendon, its thickne<U+017F>s and Silver color is excellent: So that <hi>Fallopius</hi> affirmed, nothing was more beautiful in the Body of man, than a Tendon, and the Chry<U+017F>talline Humor of the Eye.</p>
               <p>Wherefore a Tendon, <U+017F>eeing it is a Similary Part, is bred of Seed, and is of a peculiar <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, no where to be found out of a Mu<U+017F>cle. It wel de<U+017F>erves to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the cheife<U+017F>t part of the Mu<U+017F>cle, upon which the action of the Mu<U+017F>cle depends; the other Parts work together with the Tendon in the <U+017F>ame action.</p>

               <p>2. It contains a peculiar <U+017F>ort of blood, which is not circled, as the Blood of the<note place="margin">Place.</note>

               <p>3. That it carries only Blood, and not Chyle, which is done by the Milky Veins, as al<U+017F>o the impurities of the Liver and Spleen, to the <hi>Me<U+017F>enterium,</hi> Sweet-bread,<note place="margin">Office.</note> and Guts.</p>

The blood of the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> is thick, and nouri<U+017F>heth the parts of the fir<U+017F>t Region.

               <p>The Gall Bladder communicates with the Stomach by touching the <U+017F>ame, which it heates <U+017F>o, as <U+017F>omtimes to burn the <U+017F>ame, when the Gall Is inflamed in its Bladder. Somtimes it <U+017F>ticks to the Gut Colon which pa<U+017F><U+017F>es along hard by, which it often Colers Yellow, and provokes it to expell the Excrements.</p>
               <p>This expurgation of Choler, being liable to be <U+017F>topt, does vex the body with many Inconveniences.</p>
               <p>There is <U+017F>eldom ob<U+017F>erved a third channel of Choler, which goes into the Stomach, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome Part creep from the <hi>Meatus Hepaticus</hi> unto the <hi>Pylorus.</hi>

                  <head>The Medicinal Con<U+017F>ideration.</head>
                  <p>THe Gall-Bladder is <U+017F>ubject to few Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. The mo<U+017F>t common are, when its<note place="margin">Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Gall-Bladder.</note> Cavity or its Channels are ob<U+017F>tructed. When its Cavity is ful of little <U+017F>tones, or filled with one great one, by rea<U+017F>on of thick Choler changed into a <U+017F>tony <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance. Its pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages are <U+017F>topped in the Liver, or in the Gut. Al<U+017F>o it is broken, through violeut motion in Vomiting; and <U+017F>ometime it is <U+017F>o di<U+017F>tended with Choler, when the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages are <U+017F>topped that <U+017F>hould Evacuate the <U+017F>ame, that it has been <U+017F>een as big as both a Mans Fi<U+017F>ts.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes, when it is empty of choler, it dries up, <U+017F>o that nothing therefore remaines <U+017F>aving the ductus Hepaticus. If we beleive <hi>Fernelius,</hi> there could be no other Cau<U+017F>e found of the death of <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons, than that their Gall-Bladder had no Choler in it: if <U+017F>o, the evil and venemous Quality of the <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Choler was <U+017F>o great, as to infect the heart, or to weaken and corrupt <U+017F>ome noble part.</p>
                  <p>The Symptomes of this Part are more manife<U+017F>t; which do con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in its action<note place="margin">Its Symptomes.</note> hurt, or in the undue proportion or quantity of the Excrementitious Choler. The Action of the Gall-bladder is attraction of Choler, which is either dimini<U+017F>hed, or aboli<U+017F>hed. The undue proportions or quantity of the Choler is, when either too little or too much is voided forth.</p>
                  <p>Which Symptomes cheifly appear in tho<U+017F>e Parts which Sympathi<U+017F>e with the Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder,<note place="margin">Their Signs.</note> as in the Stomach, when Choler is vomited up; in the whol body, when Choler is <U+017F>hed abroad through the Veins into the habit of the Body, and deformes the Skin; or when it takes its Cour<U+017F>e into the Guts and cau<U+017F>es a dy<U+017F>entery, or a Cholerick loo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>But the original of the<U+017F>e Symptomes is to be charged upon the Liver, being il di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed.<note place="margin">Their Original.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Democritus</hi> had good Rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>earch diligently into the <U+017F>eat and Nature of Choler, when he made di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of divers living Creatures, that he might be more able rightly to cure the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of Body and mind.</p>
                  <p>When I <U+017F>ee in an extream Yellow Jaundice, the whol Skin infected with Choler, &amp;<note place="margin">Diver<U+017F>ity of Choler proved.</note> that the Urins die cloaths Yellow, the <U+017F>tooles being in the mean time whiti<U+017F>h; And when I <U+017F>ee in another <U+017F>ort of Jaundice, both the Urins and <U+017F>tooles Yellow; This confirmes to me, that there are two <U+017F>orts of Choler, and <U+017F>everal waies for the expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of each of them.

is not <U+017F>o great nor <U+017F>o <U+017F>tubborn, as in the Yellowi<U+017F>t <U+017F>ort of Jaundice, and therefore it is to be hoped the Cure will be more <U+017F>peedy.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, that <U+017F>ame ba<U+017F>tard and impure Blood, bred of muddy Blood by a ba<U+017F>tard Liver, wil be unfit to nouri<U+017F>h the neighbouring Parts which <U+017F>erve for Cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they appear filthy, for they need to be nouri<U+017F>hed with pure Blood for their pre<U+017F>ervation<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>

                  <p>THe Pi<U+017F>s-bladder is <U+017F>ubject to an infinite number of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. In its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance<note place="margin">Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Bladder.</note> it is <U+017F>ubject to al kind of Di<U+017F>tempers, e<U+017F>pecially hot and cold: it <U+017F>uffers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, Tumors, Ulcers, and Pal<U+017F>ie both in the Neck and whol Body thereof. Of which we <U+017F>hall Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e particularly.</p>
                  <p>Its temper is perverted, when the bladder naturally cold and dry, comes to wax<note place="margin">In its Temper.</note> hot, and fils into an inflammation.</p>
                  <p>Its Scituation is changed, when that Part of the <hi>Peritoneum</hi> in which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded<note place="margin">Saituation.</note> is relaxed, whereby it <U+017F>lips a little downe; which cau<U+017F>es a difficulty in pi<U+017F><U+017F>ing, unle<U+017F>s the lower Part of the Belly be lifted up with the Hand. Somtimes by the weight of many little Stones it comes to have an hollow nook, by the <U+017F>ide of the <U+017F>treight Gut near its Neck, and then the Stones do ne<U+017F>tle in that corner, <U+017F>o that they cannot be perceived by putting in a Catheter: but the be<U+017F>t way to feel them, is by putting ones Finger into the Fundament.</p>
                  <p>Its greatne<U+017F>s or widne<U+017F>s cannot certainly be defined unle<U+017F>s it were empty; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit<note place="margin">widene<U+017F>s.</note> it is enlarged and widened according to the quantity of Urine. But if it be <U+017F>o much enlarged as to exceed the natural mea<U+017F>ure, then the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the Coates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken or too much <U+017F>lacned, the party cannot make Water, becau<U+017F>e the fle<U+017F>hy Membrane is deprived of that motion, by which the Urine ought to be expelled. And in this Ca<U+017F>e the Water cannot be voided otherwi<U+017F>e than by putting in of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter, which <U+017F>omtimes for a Month or two, mu<U+017F>t be done twice a day, until the Membrane have recovered its antient tone or contractive Vigour.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes the bladder is <U+017F>o contracted and <U+017F>traitned, by rea<U+017F>on of a painful exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration in its inner Part, and then grows thicker and as it were Cartilaginous; which hinders its di<U+017F>tention: and in this Ca<U+017F>e, the Patient mu<U+017F>t often make Water with pain.</p>

                  <p>Somtime it is drawn out of its place towards the <U+017F>ides, and is carryed this way and<note place="margin">Motion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved.</note> that way, as far as the Ligaments and Connexions of the Womb wil give leave; and it wil ri<U+017F>e directly to the Liver, Stomach and Midrif, that it may be moi<U+017F>tened and fanned; it Cau<U+017F>es Choaking and Stranglings, and rai<U+017F>es terrible and violent motions and Convul<U+017F>ions in the Body.</p>

                  <p>Although <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath written and <hi>Fernelius</hi> confirmd the <U+017F>ame, that the womb like a Globe does rowle it <U+017F>elf in the Cavity of the Belly; yet are they rather the Horns of the womb, which are receptacles of Seed Spirituous and hot or putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, which being <U+017F>welled do move them<U+017F>elves this way &amp; that way, til they have <U+017F>hed their Seed into the Cavity of the Belly: which Seed being di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed, brings very cruel pains and <U+017F>tretches the Belly, until the force of the Spirits be Evaporated: hence comes that <U+017F>ame <U+017F>welling of the Belly and <U+017F>tifling about the Midrif.</p>

And therefore he makes the retention, or over-great flux of the Cour<U+017F>es, the only general cau<U+017F>e of Womens Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>aies that Women cannot be in Health, unle<U+017F>s they play the Women, that is, void their Men<U+017F>trual Blood.

                  <p>That we may know to re<U+017F>olve this Que<U+017F>tion, three things are to be noted; The Matter, the Place, and the Expul<U+017F>ive Faculty. The Matter is Blood, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains<note place="margin">1 The <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of matter.</note> over, and above what was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to nouri<U+017F>h a woman for a months time, which was ordained to conceive Child, and to nouri<U+017F>h it being born: wherefore we mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider, whether the woman abound with blood, <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he has what to <U+017F>pare, and void forth; for if <U+017F>he want blood, by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome fore-going di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he eats little, we are not to expect that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould have her Cour<U+017F>es.</p>
                  <p>The place through which it ought to flow, is the womb, with the Hypoga<U+017F>trick<note place="margin">2 Fitne<U+017F>s of the place</note> and Spermatick Veins: for the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els do contain the <U+017F>uperfluous blood, until the due time appointed for this Purgation, and they <U+017F>end it forth either by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the womb, or by the Spermatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, into the neck thereof. But if <U+017F>o be the Womb <U+017F>hal be dry, or hard, and the Spermatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and Veins ob<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, we cannot hope to procure the Cour<U+017F>es to flow, by often blood-letting.

                  <p>The<U+017F>e three things ought therefore to concur, that a woman may have her Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, Matter, Place, and the Expul<U+017F>ive Faculty; and Medicaments ought to have a<note place="margin">Medicaments, &amp; other means to accompli<U+017F>h the Cure</note> re<U+017F>pect thereunto.

               </p>
               <p>There are two kinds of Loine Symptomes: for <U+017F>ome are in the Loines, and others <U+017F>pring from the Loines: both of them are by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> judged to be very <U+017F>tubborn and hard to deal with,</p>
               <p>In his Coicks he hath pronounced ab<U+017F>olutly and without exception, Such as have pains in their Loines are in a very bad condition. And in the <U+017F>ame Book, Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es which ari<U+017F>e from pain of the Back, are hard to cure.

                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:49866:53"/>If I <U+017F>hould recite tho<U+017F>e places, I <U+017F>hould fil twenty Leaves and upwards, wherefore I wil take in my Sailes and di<U+017F>patch al in a word.

               <p>We ought therefore to be very fearful of pains in the Loines which per<U+017F>evere in Feavers, although Blood have been often let, becau<U+017F>e in the Region of the Belly, Humors lie extreme deep, which may take their cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>uddenly to <U+017F>ome of the nobler Parts, if they be not diligently Purged forth.</p>
               <p>And therefore to cure <U+017F>uch like pains of the Loins, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was went to<note place="margin">Their Cure.</note> open the Veins of the Ham or Foot: which is confirmed by him, in his Coicks: the pains of the Loins proceed from aboundance of blood there, and blood-lettings that are cau<U+017F>ed by pains of the Loins are large and plentyful.

               <p>Bleeding at the Hemorrhoid Veins is good both for the Kidneis and for pains of the Loins; and therefore the Hemorrhoids are to be provoked.</p>

               <p>But tho<U+017F>e Symptomes which are thought to ari<U+017F>e from the Loins, do not ari<U+017F>e from the Parts which con<U+017F>titute or make up the Loins, but from the neighbouring Parts, which being <U+017F>pread upon the Loins, do cau<U+017F>e pain, and transfer their Humors into other Parts, by a quick or <U+017F>low motion, by the Veins and Arteries, <U+017F>uch as are <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Aorta,</hi> the Haemorrhoid Veins and the Me<U+017F>araicks.

                  <p>Oft-times the Lungs in one, or both the <U+017F>ides, do cleave unto the Membrane which<note place="margin">How it is cau<U+017F>ed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Author.</note> covers the Ribs: or if they do not cleave thereunto when the <U+017F>ide is fir<U+017F>t inflamed; the Membrane <hi>Pleura</hi> being <U+017F>oaked, and made <U+017F>ofter by the afflux of Humors, does <U+017F>weat out a clammy wheyi<U+017F>h Humor; <U+017F>o that the Lungs when breath is drawn in, filling the whol Che<U+017F>t, do at length <U+017F>tick unto the <U+017F>aid membrane <hi>Pleura,</hi> and there cleaving is made the fa<U+017F>ter by the heat of the Feaver.

                  <p>But if the Lungs do not cleave to the <U+017F>ide, the blood-watry Humor being <U+017F>hed into the Cavity of the Che<U+017F>t, and <U+017F>carce ever drawn back again, there is bred an <hi>Empyema;</hi> which if it be not voided of it <U+017F>elf, it mu<U+017F>t be let out by opening the <U+017F>ide; which Operation <U+017F>omtimes lucks wel.</p>

                  <p>Oftentimes the Heart does counterfeit, and make <U+017F>hew of a kind of Apoplexy, but without <U+017F>norting; neither does it leave a Pal<U+017F>ey after it, or any feebleneis of Body, or mind. If this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e return often with violence, at length it over-whelms and <U+017F>tifles the Heart, not only becau<U+017F>e the blood is <U+017F>topped from going forth, by rea<U+017F>on of the fulne<U+017F>s of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, but by the Hearts being oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by <U+017F>ome gro<U+017F>s <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the blood, forcibly crowded into the Ventricies of the Heart, <U+017F>topping the pul<U+017F>ative motion of the Heart and Arteries, and cau<U+017F>ing <U+017F>omtime that the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cannot <U+017F>peak, and bringing him finally to his Grave.</p>
                  <p>This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is as common among the Germans, as is the Apoplexy, by rea<U+017F>on of their full, and Champion-like habit of body, contracted by their dayly Fea<U+017F>tings, and liberal drinking, e<U+017F>pecially at dinner, which la<U+017F>ts til

                  </p>
                  <p>The Hi<U+017F>tory of Feavers belongs to this place, which I <U+017F>hal di<U+017F>patch in few words. The Hot Di<U+017F>temper of the Heart, is termed a Feaver. The Differences of Feavers are taken from their conjunct Cau<U+017F>e, which is three-fold; The <hi>Spirits,</hi> the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,</hi> and the Humors fixed in the <U+017F>olid parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>From the Spirits, a Feaver is termed <hi>Spirituo<U+017F>a,</hi> or Spirital; from the Humors in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, it is termed <hi>Humoralis;</hi> and from the Humors fixed in the <U+017F>olid parts, it is termed <hi>Hectica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though there be three <U+017F>orts of Spirits, Natural, Vital, Animal; yet is it the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirit alone, which being inflamed, cau<U+017F>es the Spirital Feaver. There are four<note place="margin">Humoral</note> Humors contained in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, whence comes four <U+017F>orts of Humoral Feavers; the Sanguine, the Cholerick, the Flegmatick, and the Melanchollick. But the Hectick Feaver is di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by three degreee: For the <U+017F>imple Hectick arites<note place="margin">Hectick,</note> from the fixed Humor, being only inflamed; the middle Hectick is when the <U+017F>aid Humor begins to wa<U+017F>t; and the <hi>Hectica Mara<U+017F>modes,</hi> when it is quite exhau<U+017F>t, and con<U+017F>umed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Modi</hi> of Feavers, or their manner of afflicting, is two-fold: for either the<note place="margin">In re<U+017F>pect of the manner, Continual, Intermittent.</note> Feaver is continual, or it intermits; it is putrid, or not putrid; malignant, or wel-affected. A continual Feaver never cea<U+017F>es burning, til it go wholly away. An intermitting Feaver, leaves the Patient <U+017F>ome <U+017F>pace of time free from burning.</p>
                  <p>The Cau<U+017F>e of the Continualne<U+017F>s of a Feaver, is the plenty of Morbi<U+017F>ick matter and its nearne<U+017F>s to the Heart, and the di<U+017F>tance and paucity of the <U+017F>aid matter is the Cau<U+017F>e of its Intermi<U+017F><U+017F>ion. A Putrid Feaver is cau<U+017F>ed by Putrefaction of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors:<note place="margin">Putrid, Imputrid Malignant,</note> An Imputrid Feaver is cau<U+017F>ed only by the fervency of the Spirits and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors contained in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, or fixed in the <U+017F>olid Parts. A Malignant Feaver is cau<U+017F>ed by extream Pucrefaction, or by divers Symptomes greivou<U+017F>ly afflicting the noble Parts: a Well-affected Feaver, has none of al the<U+017F>e. A great Feaver is the<note place="margin">Non-malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> <U+017F>ame with a Malignant, and a little Feaver differs not from a Well affected. Hence are al the differences of Feavers taken; a <U+017F>pirital Feaver is continual indeed, yet la<U+017F>ts but a Day, and is therefore termed <hi>Ephemera:</hi> a Sanguin Feaver is al<U+017F>o continual and threefold, Encrea<U+017F>ing, <U+017F>tanding at a <U+017F>tay, and decrea<U+017F>ing; Putrid or Imputrid: It is by <U+017F>ome termed continens to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h it <U+017F>rom the re<U+017F>t of the Humoral Feavers. Cholerick, Melancholick and Flegmatick Feavers, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49866:63"/>
when the Humors from whence they ari<U+017F>e do Putrifie in the great Veins: when they Putrifie in the little Veins, or out of the Veins, they make Intermitting Feavers. An Hectick Feaver is al<U+017F>o continual, but <U+017F>low and lingering.</p>
                  <p>The Return of intermitting Feavers is termed their fit; the more than ordinary<note place="margin">The <U+017F>it of a Feaver. Its Exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>Now the Acce<U+017F><U+017F>ions or exacerbations of Feavers are various according to the various motion of the Humor. They come every third day, by rea<U+017F>on of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion of Choler, whence al bilious intermitting Feavers are called <hi>Tertians</hi> or third day Agues; as the Quartans come every fourth day, becau<U+017F>e the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick Humor is moved upon that day; as Flegm is moved every day, whence quotidian Agues are Flegmatick.</p>

                  <p>The Proper Symptomes of the beginnings of Ague-fits, do <U+017F>hew the <U+017F>ort of Ague what it is: <U+017F>o a <U+017F>haking <U+017F>hewes a Tertian Ague, A grinding cold fit that makes a man think it would break his bones, argues a Quartan; and for the fit to begin with a mere <U+017F>imple coldne<U+017F>s, is the token of a Quotidian.</p>
                  <p>A double tertian comes every day, as the Quotidian does, but with extream <U+017F>haking; whereas the Quotidian comes only with a coldne<U+017F>s.</p>

And therefore it ari<U+017F>es, from ob<U+017F>truction of the Nerves, or from their being over-much <U+017F>oftened, or from <U+017F>ome external Cau<U+017F>e, as by anointing with Quick-<U+017F>ilver, or other Application thereof.

                  <p>I proceed to the Irregularity of the Excrements.

The Di<U+017F>proportion of this Excretion con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts either in exce<U+017F>s ot defect.

Both which Symptomes are Malignant. The former decaies the bodies <U+017F>trength, by rea<U+017F>on of the lo<U+017F>s of blood and Spirits, the latter betokens a repletion of the Head, and a Vain endeavour of oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Nature, And therefore drops of Blood coming from the No<U+017F>e, is bad in a Vaporous Feaver. both as a Cau<U+017F>e, and as a Sign.</p>

And therefore each Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid is movable, howbeit the motion is more evident in the upper Eye-lids, and is performed by help of Mu<U+017F>cles, of which we <U+017F>hal treat in our fift Book containing the Hi<U+017F>tory of Mu<U+017F>cles. From whence the Reader may fetch what does appertain to the pre<U+017F>ent occa<U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eye-lid</hi> is made up, of the Skin, a Membrane and mu<U+017F>cles.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fernelius</hi> would have al bleedings at the No<U+017F>e to be <U+017F>topped, be they what they wil, and would have a Vein opened to that end, contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi> Blood coming from the inner Parts of the No<U+017F>e may be <U+017F>topped: but it is very hard to <U+017F>top the <U+017F>ame when it comes from the Menings or Coates of the Brain.</p>
                  <p>Dropping of blood from the No<U+017F>e in burning and Malignant Feavers, is bad, both<note place="margin">Its Cure.</note> as a Cau<U+017F>e and a <U+017F>igne: becau<U+017F>e it does not ea<U+017F>e the Patient, and it <U+017F>hews a Plenitude in the brain, and that nature being weak is not able to disburthen her<U+017F>elf. In <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e, great care is to be taken of the head by Revul<U+017F>ion, and Derivation of the blood, and by cooling of the Head, for fear of Inflamation or <U+017F>ome Sleepy Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>

                  <p>The Ancients did open the inward Veins of the No<U+017F>e, which Practice is left off, becau<U+017F>e the way they did it, is to us unknown.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fernelius</hi> writes that Wormes as long as ones Finger have been found in Saddle-No<U+017F>es, being there bred<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> which at la<U+017F>t made the Patients mad and killed them: tho<U+017F>e Wormes were thought to have been ca<U+017F>t out of the brain, where as indeed they were born and bred in the Cavities of the No<U+017F>e.

                  <p>That which <hi>Fernelius</hi> has written, is worthy of con<U+017F>ideration in reference to Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Head. That in No<U+017F>e-bleedings, the blood comes out not from the brain, but out of the Veins of the No<U+017F>trils. The Veins (<U+017F>aith he) do run into the No<U+017F>e not from the inner Parts of the brain, but out of the Cavities of the Mouth and Palate, which are wide and open enough, <U+017F>o as they <U+017F>eem to be the Emi<U+017F><U+017F>aries of <U+017F>uperfluovs blood; Even as the Haernorrhoid Veins, and tho<U+017F>e which belong to the Neck of the Womb. Wherefore the brain being burthened with blood is not ea<U+017F>ed, if the blood flow not from the Cavities of <hi>Dura Mater.</hi> But I beleive it flowes out of the brain. And <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Areteus</hi> do write, that the Veins within the No<U+017F>trils, beneath the Colander-bone, may be opened by Art.</p>

                     <hi>Bronchocele</hi> is a Swelling in the Neck, near the <hi>Larynx,</hi> ari<U+017F>ing from an humor collected in that place, or from the Kernel of the <hi>Cartilago Thuroides</hi> being longer than ordinary and producing <U+017F>uperfluous fle<U+017F>h; or it is an Impo<U+017F>tum proceeding from the Tumor <hi>Atheroma</hi> or <hi>Steatoma,</hi> or it is a Drop<U+017F>ie. <hi>Bronchocele</hi> does not proceed, as many have imagined, from immoderate Clamors and Cryings out, or by drinking of melted Snow, as the fa<U+017F>hion is among the Inhabitants of the Alpes or other high Mountaines; but from thick and clammmy Flegm, which <U+017F>lides thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by bittle and little out of the Head and the external Parts thereof, down behind the Eares. Which is the Judgment of <hi>Fernelius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be que<U+017F>tioned, whether the matter be contained between the <hi>Mu<U+017F>culus latus</hi> and the Skin, or whether it lie al concealed under the <hi>Mu<U+017F>culus Latus.</hi> For if the matter be collected there, it cannot be drawn out, becau<U+017F>e it is crept in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <U+017F>paces of the Mu<U+017F>cles.</p>
                  <p>If it lie outward to the <U+017F>ight, it may be rooted out and cured.

                  <p>Into the which <U+017F>pace the matter flows by degrees, which differs according to the various temperament and Con<U+017F>titution of the Patients.</p>
                  <p>It grows by little and little, and receives nouri<U+017F>hment, not by the Veins, but by certain little Pipes which Nature creates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bronchocele</hi> differs very much from the <hi>Kings-Evil-Swellings,</hi> which ri<U+017F>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Kings-Evil</note> the Jaw and in the Neck, of a rounder <U+017F>hape, di<U+017F>tinct one from another, or clu<U+017F>tered together.

                  <p>Scirrhous Tumors have in them <U+017F>omwhat of the Nature of the Kings-Evil-Swellings, which makes them <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected.

                  <p>It is inflamed, when the Tumor called <hi>Batrachium</hi> ri<U+017F>es under the Tongue, and turnes to an Impo<U+017F>tum: out of which being opened, there flowes a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance like the white of an Egg and <U+017F>omtimes true quittor.

                  <p>That the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Tongue may grow again is confirmed by many Hi<U+017F>tories, and that the <U+017F>ame being lo<U+017F>t, a man is not wholly deprived of <U+017F>peech.</p>

                  <p>Symptomes of the Tongue, of the fir<U+017F>t kind, are two, the Marring of Speech and Ta<U+017F>ting. Speech is marred three waies, by Abolition, Imminution and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation.<note place="margin">Speech Aboli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Traulotis. P<U+017F>allotis.

                     <hi>Abolition</hi> of <hi>Speech</hi> is termed <hi>Anaudia.</hi> Depravation of <U+017F>peech is of two <U+017F>orts, <hi>Traulotis, P<U+017F>allotis</hi> or <hi>Balbuties. Traulotis</hi> is when the Patient can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pronounce <U+017F>ome one letter, and <hi>P<U+017F>allotis</hi> or <hi>P<U+017F>elli<U+017F>mos</hi> is, when he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce divers letters. <hi>I<U+017F>chnophonia, Stammering,</hi> is a <U+017F>toppage of the Tongue, <U+017F>o that the Patient cannot proceed in his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, but repeats one and the <U+017F>ame<note place="margin">Tonguetied.</note> letter often over before he can proceed. <hi>Anchyloglo<U+017F><U+017F>os</hi> and <hi>Mogilalia</hi> are when the Tongue is tied either too <U+017F>trait or too loo<U+017F>e.<note place="margin">Ta<U+017F>t Vitiated</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a threefold marring of the Ta<U+017F>t, not di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by names: for it is aboli<U+017F>hed, depraved and dimini<U+017F>hed.</p>

                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:49866:86"/>The depravation of ta<U+017F>t happens when the Tongue is filled with <U+017F>ome evil<note place="margin">Ta<U+017F>t depraved</note> Humor.

                  <p>The motion of the whole Tongue is aboli<U+017F>hed in the Pal<U+017F>ie, dimini<U+017F>hed when the<note place="margin">Pal<U+017F>ie of the Tongue.</note> half of the Tongue is Pal<U+017F>ied, without any hurt to the Ta<U+017F>t.</p>
                  <p>In a total Pal<U+017F>ie of the Tongue, there is great fear that the Patient wil fal into an Apoplexy, though <hi>Fernelius</hi> <U+017F>aw none to follow: but we mu<U+017F>t not be too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but meet the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e when it is coming.</p>
                  <p>In a total Pal<U+017F>ie of the Tongue the Patients are dumb: in a Pal<U+017F>ie of half the Tongue, they <U+017F>peak untowardly.</p>
                  <p>A <U+017F>imple affection of the Tongue, is its Color changed, which comes not only<note place="margin">Tongue di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured.</note> from the primary di<U+017F>tempers thereof, but cheifly by Sympathy with the Bowels.</p>
                  <p>There is a certain trembling or wavering of the Tongue ob<U+017F>erved in Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Brain, which is a forerunner of the Phren<U+017F>ie, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Coicks.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. 2</hi> Of the great Profit of this new O<U+017F>teologie, or Doctrine of the Bones.</head>
               <p>THere is a two-fold Doctrine of the Bones; one is demon<U+017F>trated in dried Bones,<note place="margin">The Doctrine of Bones de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trated in a dead body, is better, &amp; more nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary.</note> which have been prepared by boyling; the other is <U+017F>hewed in the Bones of the Body, whiles they remain naturally fa<U+017F>tened one unto another. Both the<U+017F>e Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are u<U+017F>eful in the Art of Healing, and for <U+017F>uch as would have a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the Body of Man.</p>
               <p>For in the dried Bones, in which commonly this Doctrine is taught, nothing is learned, <U+017F>aving the external <U+017F>hape, po<U+017F>ture, and compo<U+017F>ition or frame of one with<note place="margin">For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledg of Mans Body.</note> another: But a diligent ob<U+017F>ervation of the Bones, while they are knit and fa<U+017F>tened one unto another, is more conducing to practice. Becau<U+017F>e the fa<U+017F>tenings of the Bones one unto another by Gri<U+017F>tles and Ligaments, al<U+017F>o by the <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, or joynting, are in <U+017F>ome dried Bones quite different from what they are in <U+017F>uch as be moi<U+017F>t; for in dried Bodies you would think that <U+017F>ome Cavities are hollow, and Cup-fa<U+017F>hioned, the Cavities being empty, and bereaved of their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilages; which notwith<U+017F>tanding appear <U+017F>hallow in a fre<U+017F>h Body, the Cavities being full of Gri<U+017F>tles; and contrary-wi<U+017F>e, you would in a Skeleton <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>ome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities<note place="margin">And</note> are <U+017F>hallow, which are deep in a fre<U+017F>h Body, the hollowne<U+017F>s being encrea<U+017F>ed by a Gri<U+017F>tle brim.</p>
               <p>Moreover, The external Conformation and Quality of the Bones, is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently di<U+017F>cerned in the Bones of a Carka<U+017F>s, which lo<U+017F>es much in Bones that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by boyling: as for example, the Gri<U+017F>tly incru<U+017F>tations of the extremities, the Membrane which is about the Bones, and the Mucous, or <U+017F>limy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged between the Bones; al<U+017F>o the internal <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, or Marrow, or Marrowi<U+017F>h Juyce, are manife<U+017F>tly di<U+017F>covered in the Bones of a fre<U+017F>h Body, which are not at all in dry and withered Bones.</p>
               <p>And therefore in re<U+017F>pect to the Practice of Phy<U+017F>ick, and the Cure of vitiated<note place="margin">For the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phy<U+017F>ick</note> bones, and <U+017F>uch as are broken, or out of Joynt, it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, diligently to look into, and carefully to axamine in a dead Body, the Natural Conformation of the Bones, and their conjunction one with another. I do not di<U+017F>like the u<U+017F>e of dried Bones, to teach and demon<U+017F>trate the vulgar O<U+017F>teology, or Doctrine of bones, at<note place="margin">Than the Vulgar.</note> which we mu<U+017F>t begin, as we have done in this Treat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A bone in a living Body naturally di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, ought to be, 1. Hard, to procure the bodies <U+017F>tability. 2. It ought to be Oyly without, becau<U+017F>e it is nouri<U+017F>hed. 3. It mu<U+017F>t be covered with the Perio<U+017F>tean Membrane, that it may have <U+017F>ence; for if it lo<U+017F>e the Perio<U+017F>tium, it becomes <U+017F>encele<U+017F>s. 4. It mu<U+017F>t be white tinctured with a moderate redne<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e it is a Spermatick part, and is nouri<U+017F>hed with the dewy vapor of the blood. 5. It mu<U+017F>t be hollow, or <U+017F>pongy, that it may continue the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance of Marrow, or a Marrowy Liquor to nouri<U+017F>h it <U+017F>elf withal. 6. It mu<U+017F>t be at the ends cru<U+017F>ted with Gri<U+017F>tles 7. It mu<U+017F>t be anointed as it were with an oyly moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture, to facilitate its motion. 8. It mu<U+017F>t have a continued and even <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. And therefore you <U+017F>hal know that a Bone is mi<U+017F>affected, if it be <U+017F>oft, as <hi>Ruellius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In what the preternatural.</note> 
                  <hi>Fernelius and Hollerius</hi> have ob<U+017F>erved, that in <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons the Bones of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were by <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s become <U+017F>o <U+017F>oft and flexible, that you might bend them which way you plea<U+017F>ed, like wax. Ari<U+017F>totle in the third book of his Hi<U+017F>tory of Animals, <U+017F>aies that bones are not flexible, neither are they apt to <U+017F>plit, but only <U+017F>ubject to break. Scaliger in his commentary adds: I have <U+017F>een the thigh bone by rea<U+017F>on of the venerious di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, or by u<U+017F>e of I know not what medicaments, bowed like an horne. Geographers write that in a Country of Ethiopia, the inhabitants have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally from their birth bodies <U+017F>o flexible, that they can turne and wind them into any po<U+017F>ture. I have red in Hippocrates of a boy that was borne without bones, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principal parts of his body otherwi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>tinct. <hi>Fore<U+017F>tus</hi> <U+017F>aw a boy made after the <U+017F>ame manner in <U+017F>ome of his members.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if a bone <U+017F>hal be drie without, it declares a di<U+017F>temperature of the part: if it be white it argues want of heat, if red, inflammation; if black, rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s and bla<U+017F>ting. If a bone be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, there is <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret fault in its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, or in its perio<U+017F>tean membrane. If it be <U+017F>olid and concrete without cavities or parts<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> it renders the body heavie and <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>h, and can containe no marrow. Plinie relates that there are <U+017F>ome that lived having <U+017F>olid bones and without marrow, which are very rare and are termed Cornei. The <U+017F>igne of <U+017F>uch a Con<U+017F>titution is never to thir<U+017F>t and never to <U+017F>weat. They are called Cornei from the Cornel or Dog-tree; becau<U+017F>e the male Cornel has no pith or marrow. <hi>See Rhodiginus.</hi> Such a one the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>ian Lygdamus</hi> is reported to have been, who in the three and thirteth <hi>Olymp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which Epicurus, contradicting ari<U+017F>totle maintaines, as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible in the 8. Booke of <hi>Athenaeus</hi> his Deipno<U+017F>ophi<U+017F>ts. <hi>Aldrovondus</hi> has ob<U+017F>erved that among Fowles the E<U+017F>trich has <U+017F>olid bones, void of marrow. But in ca<U+017F>e a bone <U+017F>hould be deprived of its Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tly Cru<U+017F>t and of its perio<U+017F>tean Membrane, it is moved with difficulty, and has no feeling at all. If a bone become uneven and prominent <U+017F>o as to have bunches upon it, it is termed Exo<U+017F>to<U+017F>is, which is an effect and concomitant of the venereous pocks when it is of long <U+017F>tanding and confirmed, howbeit it may <U+017F>pring from <U+017F>ome other cau<U+017F>e. Finally being depraued and mi<U+017F>hapen, or di<U+017F>jointed, it hinders and mars the Action of the whole body or its parts; and being divided in its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, it argues <U+017F>olution of Continuity by <U+017F>ome cleft or fracture. and although a broken bone by the mediation of a Callus becomes <U+017F>oddered together one the out<U+017F>ide: Yet does it <U+017F>till remaine divided within.</p>

                  <p>A <U+017F>ure thing it is, that the bones being di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed, do drop blood, and <hi>Galen</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved as much.</p>
                  <p>The bones are likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ubject to <hi>Fracture,</hi> or breaking, and Luxation, Di<U+017F>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,<note place="margin">Fracture.</note> or disjoynting. Now a Fracture of a bone, is a Divi<U+017F>ion made in a bone by <U+017F>ome external Cau<U+017F>e, cutting, or brui<U+017F>ing the <U+017F>ame.</p>
                  <p>There are two <U+017F>orts of Fractures, a <U+017F>traight one, and an oblique, or crooked<note place="margin">Its kinds.</note> one. The former is according to the length of the bone, or overthwart.</p>
                  <p>The latter, or oblique is (if we beleeve <hi>Galen</hi>) too curiou<U+017F>ly differenced by the latter Phy<U+017F>icians which have <U+017F>ucceeded <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> for it is <U+017F>aid to be Nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa<U+017F>hioned, when the Fracture is partly <U+017F>traight, and partly circular; another <U+017F>ort is called <hi>Alphi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Another <U+017F>ort there is, which is called <hi>Apotrau<U+017F>is,</hi> or <hi>Detractio,</hi> whereby a Fragment of the bone is <U+017F>o taken away, that there remains a mark in the <U+017F>urface of the Bone.</p>
                  <p>Another <U+017F>ort of Fracture, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> mentions, which he cals <hi>Apocla<U+017F>ma,</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> terms <hi>Hapagma,</hi> when a bone is broken there where it is joyned with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bone.</p>
                  <p>Luxation, or Disjoynting, is a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e of the bone in Scituation, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved<note place="margin">Luxation.</note> out of its place.</p>
                  <p>There is a two fold Luxation, or disjoynting of a bone; the one compleat, when the Head of the bone is <U+017F>lipt out of its <U+017F>ocket, and this is called <hi>Exarthrema,</hi> a being out of Joynt.</p>
                  <p>The other is Incompleat, and termed <hi>Pararthrema,</hi> when the bone is in <U+017F>ome<note place="margin">Its <U+017F>orts,</note> mea<U+017F>ure only removed, and lengthened as it were, which is mo<U+017F>tly <U+017F>een in the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luxation of the Thigh. In an <hi>Exarthrema,</hi> the Leg <U+017F>eems <U+017F>horter than it was wont to be; in a <hi>Pararthrema</hi> it <U+017F>eems longer than u<U+017F>ual.</p>
                  <p>The Cau<U+017F>es of Luxation and Subluxation, that is to <U+017F>ay, of perfect, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect<note place="margin">Cau<U+017F>es,</note> disjoynting of any Member, are external, or internal: The External are, a blow, a violent di<U+017F>tor<U+017F>ion, or wrenching, a fall, and exten<U+017F>ion of a Member. The Internal cau<U+017F>es are, a thin Humor, which does relax the Ligaments, or a thick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor which by little and little, fils the Cavity of the Joynt, and at la<U+017F>t thru<U+017F>ts out the bone, by rea<U+017F>on of an <hi>Anchylo<U+017F>is,</hi> which is bred.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Anchylo<U+017F>is,</hi> is a fault in the Articulation of bones, whereby the Cavity of<note place="margin">Anchylo<U+017F>is.</note> a bone, which ought to receive the Head of another bone, is filled up; be it what kind of Articulation it may be, either <hi>Enarthro<U+017F>is, Arthrodia,</hi> or <hi>Gynglymos.</hi> Hereupon the bone thus di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed, either is held bowed in, or remains <U+017F>tretched out, and <U+017F>tiff.

               <p>HAving diligently con<U+017F>idered the Articulations, or joyntings of the Bones one<note place="margin">Things to be ob<U+017F>erved prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally.</note> unto another, let us now take notice what is ob<U+017F>ervable in every particular bone being fre<U+017F>h, which is not to be <U+017F>een in the Skeleton, or in dried bones. I will proceed from Head to Foot, according as I am wont to do in my Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection, and Demon<U+017F>tration of the<U+017F>e parts. Now my Demon<U+017F>tration of the bones is two-fold; the one I call <hi>O<U+017F>teotome,</hi> or Bone-Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection, in which the bones are <U+017F>eparated each from other; the other I term <hi>O<U+017F><U+017F>ifragium,</hi> in which the bones are broken, that their inner <U+017F>tructure may be di<U+017F>cerned.</p>
               <p>And in the fir<U+017F>t place, let us contemplate the two-fold Table of the Skull, or<note place="margin">Two-fold plate.</note> the double Skul-board which is thinner in Women, than it is in Men.</p>
               <p>The uppermore is thicker, and harder, and more <U+017F>moothly poli<U+017F>hed than the neather: but the lower is rough and furrowed as it were, that it might afford place for tho<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els which creep along the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> from which <U+017F>ome notable Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els ari<U+017F>e, which by the Ears do in<U+017F>inuate them<U+017F>elves between tho<U+017F>e two plates, or boards of the Skull, for to irrigate the intermediate <U+017F>pace.</p>
               <p>Now that <U+017F>ame intermediate <U+017F>pace, is a certain <U+017F>pongy Sub<U+017F>tance, which receives<note place="margin">Intermediate <U+017F>pace<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                  </note> and contains a Marrowy Juyce, <U+017F>erving for the nutriment of tho<U+017F>e bones. The which Marrowy Juyce is reddi<U+017F>h, by rea<U+017F>on of blood flowing out of the <U+017F>mal Veins <U+017F>cituate in tho<U+017F>e parts; which is wont <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now the Skull, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>de Vulneribus Capitis,</hi> is double in the<note place="margin">Why the Skull is double?</note> middle of the Head, that is to <U+017F>ay, hollow between two plates and boards, that it might contain a Marrowy Juyce to nouri<U+017F>h the bones. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adds, The whol Head, a <U+017F>mal part excepted, re<U+017F>embles a <U+017F>punge ful of <U+017F>mal Caruncles, or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bits of fle<U+017F>h, which if you pre<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>queeze with your finger, you <U+017F>hal perceive blood to drop out of them: al<U+017F>o you <U+017F>hal <U+017F>ee <U+017F>mal Veins running up and down, which abound with blood.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The rea<U+017F>on of <hi>Gallen</hi> and Sylvius is, that it is better the excrements <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>trained, and kept up for a <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on in tho<U+017F>e Cavities, than that a man <U+017F>hould be continually <U+017F>pitting, and holding his mouth evermore open. For although the Sphenoidean Cavities, are in the di<U+017F><U+017F>ections of dead bodies empty, and appear not to be ful either of flegm or <U+017F>ero<U+017F>ities: probable notwith<U+017F>tanding it is, that the <U+017F>erous humor which flowes and di<U+017F>tils out of the Choana, through the <U+017F>ive-like plate of the Sella equina, is tran<U+017F>colated into the Cavities which are beneath, and from them powred back by certaine oval and <U+017F>ufficiently wide Holes, and voided forth into the <U+017F>pungy bones of the No<U+017F>trils: neither do they deny, that a part of the <U+017F>ero<U+017F>ities, does <U+017F>weat through the poro<U+017F>ities of the inferior table or plate, into the palate. But the <U+017F>erous humor received in the <U+017F>pungy bones of the No<U+017F>trils, does by little and little <U+017F>weat out and pa<U+017F>s away, when by its quantity or quality, it provokes nature to an exctetion. For to what purpo<U+017F>e think you has Nature fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">The u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>inus Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noides.</note> tho<U+017F>e cavities?

                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:49866:126"/>The profit of this knowledge is evident in fractures. <hi>For</hi> hereby may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in how long time a broken Bone may be <U+017F>oddered together again. <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> writes in his Book <hi>de Alimentis: that the nouri<U+017F>hment of a Bone may be known by the breaking thereof. The No<U+017F>e bone requirs ten daies to grow together, the Jaw-bones and the claviculae and ribs twenty; the Cubit requirs thirty, the Tibia and Brachium forty, and the thigh-bone fifty, little more or le<U+017F>s as occa<U+017F>ien <U+017F>ervs.</hi>

               <p>And the Cubit-bone, becau<U+017F>e it is thrice as thick as the No<U+017F>e-bone, therefore it will need thrice as much nutriment, and thrice as long time to grow together.</p>

               <p>Which that it may be more effectually performed, you <U+017F>hal perce the larger bones that are ful of Marrow, in the Head with an Awle that all the <U+017F>uperfluous marrow may flow and <U+017F>oake out.</p>
               <p>You may throw away the fir<U+017F>t water and boile them in a <U+017F>econd, that all the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may be drawn forth.</p>
               <p>Then take them out while the water is hot (for if it be cold they wil be grea<U+017F>ie) and <U+017F>crape and clen<U+017F>e them with a <U+017F>mal knife.</p>
               <p>Some, while they are boyling, throw in a pound of Lime or Chalke, to make them the whiter, but this eates off the Epiphy<U+017F>ies and the Gri<U+017F>tles which do cru<U+017F>t the extremities of the Bones; which you mu<U+017F>t take heed you pul not away, when you <U+017F>crape the Bones.</p>
               <p>Then you <U+017F>hal put the Bones againe into mo<U+017F>t pure water boiling hot, and boile them for an houre, that all the marrow and fat may be <U+017F>eparate and exhau<U+017F>ted. After that ca<U+017F>t them into cold water, and take them out and wipe and rub them wel with cour<U+017F>e linnen cloaths.</p>
               <p>When the Bones are thus prepared, many lay them two or three moneths in the open aire to bleach and grow white. Others put them into a wooden ca<U+017F>e, bored ful of holes and hang them in a running brooke, or in the <U+017F>treames of a <U+017F>wift River, that the rubbing of the <U+017F>treame may whiten them.</p>
               <p>I had rather lay them under the falling of a Mil-<U+017F>tream for the <U+017F>pace of ten or twelve daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellonius in his Book de Admirandis,</hi> relates that he <U+017F>aw in the <U+017F>hoare of <hi>Bononia</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> an inumerable company of exceeding white bones of Bodies which had been drownd and ca<U+017F>t out upon the <U+017F>hore haveing been buried in the Sea <U+017F>and. He <U+017F>aw the like by the Red-<U+017F>ea, <U+017F>o that the bones <U+017F>o prepared, and <U+017F>ticking and growing together by their nerves and Ligaments, are exceeding neate, and cleane and whiter then Snow. Such as were tho<U+017F>e two Sceletons which <hi>Galen</hi> had to <U+017F>erve him in Anatomy. <hi>Bellonius</hi> ob<U+017F>erves in the <U+017F>ame place, that dead bodies are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49866:127"/>
from corruption if they be anointed with the Balme that drops out of Cedar trees; al<U+017F>o that bones moi<U+017F>tened with the <U+017F>ame juice remaine uncorrupted.</p>
               <p>The Bones accurately clen<U+017F>ed and dried, you <U+017F>hal pre<U+017F>erve in a Che<U+017F>t, or you may fa<U+017F>ten them together with bra<U+017F>s-wire, and <U+017F>o keep them <U+017F>tanding in a Ca<U+017F>e. It is needful that you have bones both waies, viz. <U+017F>ingle and united. And the truth is, as <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius</hi> has rightly ob<U+017F>erved, the Bones united <U+017F>erve more for o<U+017F>tentation than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truction.</p>
               <p>Moreover by long boileing, fir<U+017F>t in water, and then in oile, al the Bones of the<note place="margin">The manner of fa<U+017F>tening the Bones to make a Skeleton.</note> Head and of the upper jawbone are ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eparated, as I have often ob<U+017F>erved: and by this meanes you may have them <U+017F>evered one from another, that you may view and mea<U+017F>ure the <U+017F>ize and dimentions of every one. The manner of fa<U+017F>tening the bones together, depends either upon the Indu<U+017F>try of the Arti<U+017F>t; or it is done by imitation of another Sceleton neatly compo<U+017F>ed.
