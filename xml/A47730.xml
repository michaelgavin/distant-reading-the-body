         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

mu<U+017F>t it needs be to one of my capacity to have
diverted a Prince, that nothing, that was not

and to find room in a Cabinet, where nothing

               <p>And really, Sir, who dare condemn this pride

which procures you Subjects in all the rea<U+017F>ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

tho<U+017F>e many Favours your Royal Highne<U+017F>s hath

you oblige them with, is an infallible <U+017F>igne, that
you are not ignorant of their Beauties, and that
you have a perfect knowledge of their Merits.</p>
               <p>We ought not to wonder when we <U+017F>ee them

none can e<U+017F>teem them but tho<U+017F>e that know them,
and that is an advantage that Heaven doth not

of this precious advantage, and I am very

that quick, <U+017F>ubtle, and delicate Wit of

This is that Divine Quality, Sir, that gives a
Lu<U+017F>tre to all your Heroick ones, and crowns you
King of all the Wits of the age: Your Valour,
Ju<U+017F>tice, and Genero<U+017F>ity are great Virtues I mu<U+017F>t
confe<U+017F>s; That <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s and obliging entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with that agreeable Air which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
all your Actions, and Charms all tho<U+017F>e that
have the Honour to approach your Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on;
that Galantry which is <U+017F>o natural to you,
which gets you the inclinations of the Ladies,
and renders your Court, and all your diverti<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<U+017F>o Noble and Magnificent, are glorious
advantages, I mu<U+017F>t avow it. But all the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vertues and glorious advantages, would,
it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, be confined to your own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Strangers, and Po<U+017F>terity would never
<U+017F>o much as hear of them, were they not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that our Love of the Mu<U+017F>es. Had it not
been for this Honourable inclination, <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi>
never had received <U+017F>o many Elogies as he did,
and his Glory, it may be, had never reached
our Ears. It is this that makes your Vertues
commended and talkt of beyond the limits of
your Provinces, and <U+017F>hall do too, far beyond
that <U+017F>hort cour<U+017F>e of your life, that you <U+017F>pend
<U+017F>o gloriou<U+017F>ly, and that merited Eternity; it is
this that inve<U+017F>ts you with a Soveraignty over all
the <hi>Vertuo<U+017F>i</hi> in the world, and to which I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
for the happine<U+017F>s I enjoy, to <U+017F>tile my <U+017F>elf
your Subject. It is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible it is an exce<U+017F>s of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in me to reckon my <U+017F>elf among the Wits;
but when one has once obtain'd the happine<U+017F>s to
plea<U+017F>e your Royal Highne<U+017F>s, he may without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
a<U+017F><U+017F>ume that glorious Title with all its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages,

and in that condition to which your
Royal Highne<U+017F>s has been plea<U+017F>ed to advance
me; I <U+017F>hould offend your judgement, <U+017F>hould I
have a bad opinion of any thing that I call mine.
I have <U+017F>o highly e<U+017F>teemed my parts, <U+017F>ince I was
informed your Royal Highne<U+017F>s did not de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e

to your Royal plea<U+017F>ure.</p>
               <p>Since my fir<U+017F>t works have taken the boldne<U+017F>s
to pa<U+017F>s over the <hi>Alps</hi> without my Commi<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and yet had the happine<U+017F>s to plea<U+017F>e all your
Court, though I dur<U+017F>t not hope it; I imagined,
that tho<U+017F>e I <U+017F>hould my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>end over thither, and
which had no other de<U+017F>igne but that of your
Royal Highne<U+017F><U+017F>es Diverti<U+017F>ement, would not be
<U+017F>o unhappy, as to come off wor<U+017F>e then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>It is a great de<U+017F>ign without que<U+017F>tion, that I
engage upon, and I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay even a ra<U+017F>h and
incon<U+017F>iderate one, if a per<U+017F>on had not advi<U+017F>ed
me to it, that I am confident is too prudent to
coun<U+017F>el me to any <U+017F>uch undertakings: it is, Sir,
a Gentleman of your Dominions that hath the
honour both to be known and belov'd of his
Prince, that hath been plea<U+017F>ed to give him<U+017F>elf the
trouble to bring my Mu<U+017F>e into your Court, and
that hath wrote me word of the good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
it received from your Royal Highne<U+017F>s.
This generous friend of mine could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly
procure me a more glorious, advantage nor one
that I more vehemently de<U+017F>ired; but that which
hath exceeded all my hopes, and created in me
the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ant <U+017F>urprize imaginable, is that
incomparable goodne<U+017F> that he was plea<U+017F>ed to

have for me in communicating a Letter of your
Royal Highne<U+017F>s to me, in which you graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly
vouch<U+017F>afed to witne<U+017F>s, that you e<U+017F>teemed
my works, and that you <U+017F>hould be very well
<U+017F>atisfied to <U+017F>ee me make <U+017F>ome more of them for
your diverti<U+017F>ement. This Letter was a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and indi<U+017F>putable Order for me, but it was
no unplea<U+017F>ant one, and I can <U+017F>afely <U+017F>wear, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it with as great a joy as <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>It is this, Sir, that obliged me to the writing
of this piece of Gallantry, the gayety whereof
it is not impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible may not di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you. It may
be too, it may di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate for <U+017F>ome moments tho<U+017F>e
trouble<U+017F>ome thoughts, that your Politick affairs
commonly leave behind them, and <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e
cares which the conduct of great E<U+017F>tates almo<U+017F>t

               <p>If I can compa<U+017F>s <U+017F>o noble a de<U+017F>igne as this, I
<U+017F>hall get my <U+017F>elf reputation, and <U+017F>hall per<U+017F>wade
my <U+017F>elf, that your Subjects are <U+017F>omething en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to me into the bargain. It is not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tioned
but they know, that when one diverted
<hi>Ce<U+017F>ar,</hi> he obliged the Republick, and I am very
certain, that <hi>Ce<U+017F>ar</hi> had not more noble qualities
then your Royal Highne<U+017F>s; and that the <hi>Romans</hi>
had not a more tender affection, or profound
re<U+017F>pect for him, then tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>

               <p>The<U+017F>e are truths, Sir, that your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
may ea<U+017F>ily be <U+017F>atisfied of, from a forreign
Countrey. If they were told you by your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
you might <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, they <U+017F>aid <U+017F>o for their
own intere<U+017F>t, or to flatter you, and <U+017F>o receive
their prai<U+017F>es as a common homage, which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100546:12"/>
<U+017F>eldom refu<U+017F>e their Soveraigns; but when
an Elogie proceeds to you from a Province not
<U+017F>ubject to your Royal Highne<U+017F>s, you may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure
your <U+017F>elf, Sir, that he who gave you the<U+017F>e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
was confident of the truth of them.
It is from <U+017F>trangers that a Prince may learn infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly,
what Sentiments the world has of him,
and what their judgement is of his Qualities and
his Conduct.</p>
               <p>And <U+017F>ince it is <U+017F>o, Sir, your Royal Highne<U+017F>s
ought to be entirely <U+017F>atisfied; tho<U+017F>e strangers
which are not intere<U+017F><U+017F>ed in your Highne<U+017F>s, prai<U+017F>e
and ble<U+017F>s you; and I, Sir, that have made <U+017F>ome
voyages into forraign Countreys, can witne<U+017F>s the
truth of it: Whereever they <U+017F>peak of your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highne<U+017F>s, they compare you to tho<U+017F>e great
Princes from whence you drew your being. As
all the world is very well <U+017F>atisfied that no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
can <U+017F>urprize you, and that your courage ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acknowledges no dangers, or makes them
immediately cea<U+017F>e to be <U+017F>o, they compare you
to the Illu<U+017F>trious <hi>Amedees,</hi> which all the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
power of the <hi>Turks</hi> could never terrifie, and
that pre<U+017F>erved <hi>Rhodes</hi> with <U+017F>o much glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
all the force of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperor.

not I the Wit and Eloquence of the la<U+017F>t, which
I would wholly employ with all my <U+017F>oul to make
an Elogie for your Royal Highne<U+017F>s. I'd tell

this affliction had very much augmented that

               <p>The greate<U+017F>t part of the Officers of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
were not very well skil'd in any other
Virtues, then their Military ones, and Wine and
Tobacco, the Pot and Pipe was their chief em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment:
but all of them were not <U+017F>o <U+017F>canda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ly
inclin'd: <U+017F>ome few of them were more
Gentile and Courtly, and preferred a hand<U+017F>ome
obliging Lady, before all the Pots in Chri<U+017F>tendom.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Lycidas</hi> was one of the<U+017F>e civil Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and without all que<U+017F>tion, Sir, he might pa<U+017F>s
for one of the prettie<U+017F>t fellows in the Regiment;

his Cloaths were as fine, and Al-a-mode,
as they could po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be out of <hi>Paris;</hi> his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100546:14"/>
variety of Garnitures, and his good large plume
of Feathers, that quite cover'd his little empty
Noddle, made him pre<U+017F>ently be taken notice of;
all the Ladies mightily admired him, and doing
as they u<U+017F>e to do in the like occa<U+017F>ions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
taken with him, and there was not one
Lady in all the Town, that was not hatching

hand<U+017F>ome <U+017F>tranger.</p>
               <p>As he was alwaies a profe<U+017F>t Servant of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

his de<U+017F>ign, got acquaintance with a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier

               <p>This talkative ill-natured Cavalier, I forgot
to tell you what he was before, would not for all
the world but have brought <hi>Lycidas</hi> to Ma<U+017F>s, that
is the amorous rendezvous of the Town; and 'tis
very likely had not <hi>Lycidas</hi> been acquainted, that
he <U+017F>hould find good <U+017F>tore of Beauties there, he
would have been more gentile, and le<U+017F>s <U+017F>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous

Here it was a Man might <U+017F>ee at once all that

the fir<U+017F>t bout; but our Gallant goes further, and
learns what Love intrigue this and that Lady has

could never do it, there were many of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

She went indeed <U+017F>ometimes to <U+017F>ee a Play

all this onely augmented her calamity, and the<U+017F>e

pretty diverti<U+017F>ements were the greate<U+017F>t plagues

<hi>Celadon</hi> from <hi>Florimel,</hi> or <hi>Dauphire</hi> from the

<hi>Romeo</hi> compliment his <hi>Juliet.</hi> And then

blows that <U+017F>tab'd her contentment; and
in that transport of fury, that their amorous
declarations had put her; <U+017F>he threw away the
Romance, nay, and <U+017F>ometimes threw it into the
fire too, to revenge her <U+017F>elf for that injury, that
<U+017F>he fancied had been put upon her: but yet <U+017F>he

in her, without a long and a familiar acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Having now learn'd her Character, your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

trouble <U+017F>he was condemn'd to every day at
Ma<U+017F>s, where <hi>Lycidas</hi> never fail'd to meet
her.
For though <U+017F>he had the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>hare of his
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Glances, his Reverences, and all tho<U+017F>e
petty pieces of Gallantry, <U+017F>he grew <U+017F>tark mad,
and all this would not content her.</p>
               <lg>

               <p>Neverthele<U+017F>s her jealous Lady<U+017F>hip was fain to
conceal her re<U+017F>entments for ten or twelve days,
for <hi>Lycidas</hi> was <U+017F>o long without vi<U+017F>iting the
Ladies at their <U+017F>everal Hou<U+017F>es, and our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
did not this without all the rea<U+017F>on in the
world, for he knew very well (though my intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
did not inform me, how he came to
know it) how much a man expo<U+017F>es him<U+017F>elf in
company, when he is ignorant of their Intrigues,
which make the greate<U+017F>t part of the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e,
and for this rea<U+017F>on he re<U+017F>olv'd to be fully
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the <U+017F>tory of the Town, before he
engaged in company. And truly, that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Hi<U+017F>torian, that ill-natured Satyri<U+017F>t, I mean,
that I told you of before, was as good a Ma<U+017F>ter to
in<U+017F>truct him, as he could wi<U+017F>h, and one that
proved very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to him in that conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and upon this con<U+017F>ideration (for faith I
know nothing el<U+017F>e could induce him to it) he
was <U+017F>carce ever out of his company.</p>
               <p>In a fair day they both went a walking together,
to enjoy the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of the Air, and <U+017F>ee how
the
Spring had with her natural Artifice, (that you

all the Trees and Meadows with her invi<U+017F>ible
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100546:18"/>
Pencil, beyond the happy curio<U+017F>ity of all the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Angelos; they went, if I am not mi<U+017F>taken, to
a certain Garden not far out of Town, and when
they came to the Gate of it, they <U+017F>aw two
Coaches there, which made them <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect there
was company in the Garden wherupon they
enquir'd of the Coachman, who told them that
a kin<U+017F>man of our Cavaliers, had Coach'd <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>even or eight Ladies thither: Now who would
not pity this poor Gentleman among <U+017F>uch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Women, were he nine times a Man,
that's about four<U+017F>core times more than a Tailor,
he could never be enough for them: Why, a
hundred Mouths would be little enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer
them and ki<U+017F>s them, and a thou<U+017F>and hands
would not <U+017F>uffice to clip them, hug them, and
hand them; but I leave the Gentleman to the
mercy of the Ladies, and mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>ee what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are a doing. They had no <U+017F>ooner learn'd
of the Coachman, what I told you of, but they
both agreed very prudently to go <U+017F>eek out <U+017F>ome
other <U+017F>olitary place, that would be more fit and
proper for their purpo<U+017F>e, and without more adoe,
were marching back again, when the Ma<U+017F>ter of
the Fea<U+017F>t chanced to <U+017F>pie them, and running to
them to <U+017F>top them, he made u<U+017F>e of that civil
piece of violence, we commonly do in <U+017F>uch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
to engage them to come into this company.
The Femals that thought one man to <U+017F>even of
them, was mo<U+017F>t intolerable, were not very much
di<U+017F>pleas'd at the arrival of the<U+017F>e two Gentlemen;
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> that was one of the company, and knew
the Cavalier, went to meet him, pretending
<U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>he had to tell him of, but it was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100546:18"/>
for nothing el<U+017F>e but to lay hold of <hi>Lycidas</hi> fir<U+017F>t
of all; her project took, the <U+017F>tranger fell to her
<U+017F>hare, and he, being a very pretty fellow, and one
that <U+017F>poke the fine<U+017F>t things in the world, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a very happy faculty to love when he would,
or, what was all one, to make people believe
<U+017F>o.</p>
               <lg>

               </lg>
               <p>And really, Sir, this fir<U+017F>t enterview, while the
treatment was providing, <hi>Zelotide</hi> had rea<U+017F>on to
be <U+017F>atisfied with him. They walked a great many
turns of the Allie together, and <hi>Lycidas</hi> being
no <U+017F>crupulous per<U+017F>on in making his Love-Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                  <l>That though <U+017F>he <U+017F>corn'd his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion</l>
                  <l>And did his torments with contempt look on.</l>
                  <l>Yet <U+017F>he, yet onely <U+017F>he,</l>
                  <l>Should be the Empre<U+017F>s of his liberty.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>He had not quite fini<U+017F>h'd his prote<U+017F>tations,
when Dinner was <U+017F>erved up, and they were call'd
to <U+017F>it down. It was then, if ever, that <hi>Lycidas</hi>
made a good u<U+017F>e of his wit, and <U+017F>poke a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and
the plea<U+017F>ante<U+017F>t things that ever were
heard, <U+017F>o that the company was extreamly plea<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him; and <hi>Zelotide</hi> conceived all the joy
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100546:19"/>
imaginable, to <U+017F>ee a per<U+017F>on that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome
good will for, appear <U+017F>o amiable to all the world
be<U+017F>ides. But then her damn'd humour made her
reflect, and think with her <U+017F>elf, that if this <U+017F>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
took her <U+017F>o infinitely, her companions too
might be more taken with him, then <U+017F>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>And though <U+017F>he lov'd tho<U+017F>e charms <U+017F>he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cry,</l>
                  <l>Both in his Lips and Eye</l>

                  <l>What cruel mi<U+017F>eries her poor heart prov'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Her trouble was <U+017F>till augmented, and his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as <U+017F>he imagined, ju<U+017F>tified her <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions;
for the Gentleman did not, as <U+017F>he expected, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
choo<U+017F>e out the choice bits to pre<U+017F>ent her with
them, but took as much care too to plea<U+017F>ure
the re<U+017F>t, and did it with a pretty grace, that
charm'd the company, and made poor <hi>Zelotide</hi>
run de<U+017F>perate; and this was the rea<U+017F>on why they
<U+017F>ate not long at Table, for our jealous Lady being
one of the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable among them, ro<U+017F>e
up fir<U+017F>t, and obliged all the re<U+017F>t to follow her.
They walked for <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall time in the Garden,
and then all the company retired. <hi>Lycidas</hi>
mann'd <hi>Zelotide</hi> home, and by the way, beg'd
of her mo<U+017F>t vehemently, the permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to wait
upon her Lady<U+017F>hip <U+017F>ometimes, which <U+017F>he mo<U+017F>t

               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:100546:19"/>
They both parted very well <U+017F>atisfied with one
another, and thought every hour an age till
they met again. <hi>Zelotide</hi> was over joyed at her
Conque<U+017F>t, and per<U+017F>waded her <U+017F>elf, that now <U+017F>he
had triumphed over the re<U+017F>t of the Ladies; and
<hi>Lycidas</hi> was no le<U+017F>s plea<U+017F>ed to have begun his
Female-acquaintance, with the mo<U+017F>t hand<U+017F>ome
and con<U+017F>iderable Lady of the Town, and being
yet ignorant of <hi>Zelotides</hi> ill humour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<U+017F>he was no cruel Lady, he a<U+017F><U+017F>ured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf,
that her Husband being now at <hi>Paris</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <lg>
                  <l>He thought he now might own his Love,</l>

                  <l>Her Vertue and her Honour were</l>

                  <l>He thought tho<U+017F>e fooli<U+017F>h Oppo<U+017F>ites, his Love</l>
                  <l>Might well without a Miracle remove,</l>
               </lg>
               <p>In a word, Sir, he promi<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
imaginable from his new Gallantry, and
never dreamed of tho<U+017F>e troubles it would ingage
him in; on the morrow he put on the mo<U+017F>t
proper and becoming Cloaths he had, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
with impatience, the hour when he might
<U+017F>ee the Ladies; Well, at la<U+017F>t it came, though
to his thinking, mo<U+017F>t cur<U+017F>ed <U+017F>lowly; and the
Gallant goes to my Lady <hi>Zelotides,</hi> where he
found her, in his judgement, a thou<U+017F>and times
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100546:20"/>
more hand<U+017F>ome then ever <U+017F>he was before, either
at Church or the Garden; and <U+017F>he truly had
done all <U+017F>he could to <U+017F>et her <U+017F>elf off.</p>
               <p>There were two Cou<U+017F>ins of hers with her at
that time, of which the name of the one was
<hi>Melite,</hi> and the other <hi>Cleonia:</hi> both of them
young, both hand<U+017F>ome, and both of the mo<U+017F>t
plea<U+017F>ant and gay humour, that ever you met
with. The<U+017F>e three amiable per<U+017F>ons were very
familiar, and <U+017F>carce ever out of one anothers
company. <hi>Lycidas</hi> that had naturally a very brisk
wit, and made the be<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e of it he could in all
Ladies company he came into, and a pretty kind
of in<U+017F>inuation, was immediately received into
this hand<U+017F>ome Troop, and judg'd a very fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
for their amorous commerce, and one that
they might talk too without ceremony; <U+017F>o that
<hi>Zelotide</hi> would not any longer conceal her <U+017F>elf,

the merits of my Cou<U+017F>ins, and I dare a<U+017F><U+017F>ume the
vanity to tell you, that no Ladies in Town ought
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100546:20"/>
to be preferred to us, <U+017F>o that the Law we pre<U+017F>cribe
you, cannot ju<U+017F>tly <U+017F>eem too rigid and intolerable; to
<U+017F>ee no Lady, and admire or love any thing out of
Breeches, but us; you have got a very incon<U+017F>tant
mind with you, and I <U+017F>hrowdly <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect you for a fickle
per<U+017F>on, and one fit to abu<U+017F>e all the Women you meet
with: your amorous lies and pretty perjuries, I'faith
Sir, I mu<U+017F>t tell you our re<U+017F>olution; either renounce
this humour, or our <U+017F>ociety, for they are incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
there are indeed in Town, <U+017F>ome things in Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats
that will admit of your Courtly wenching
actions, but faith Sir, we <U+017F>hall not; we are too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cious
of our own worth and excellence, to come in
<U+017F>harers with per<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o much below us, and we mu<U+017F>t
have you wholly ours, or not at all. Go, Sir, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
your <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>ee whither you can endure to
keep us company upon the<U+017F>e conditions; and I dare
a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, that if you can, you will not repent of it.</p>

                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> did not forget one word of this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,

a <U+017F>urprize, as this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t needs put him

vow'd and prote<U+017F>ted, that they, though but
three of them, were worth all he had ever <U+017F>een
before, and that any one of them were enough

that you would <U+017F>ave me trouble of doing it,
and <U+017F>he would no longer keep you faithful then
I have done; I too well am acquainted with your

               <lg>
                  <l>He grew at her complaint compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate,</l>

               <p>Yet he <U+017F>till did all he could to prove, that her

<U+017F>he ought not to re<U+017F>t <U+017F>atify'd with appearances.
But <U+017F>eeing hit ob<U+017F>tinate denials the more
enraged her, he at la<U+017F>t, avow'd his infidelity,
and begged his pardon in the mo<U+017F>t moving

her, that he would never again vi<U+017F>it <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>
and promi<U+017F>ed her mo<U+017F>t faithfully, to live ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly

<hi>Zelotide</hi> had no rea<U+017F>on to believe his oaths any

               <p>And <U+017F>o <U+017F>he pardoned them, Sir, and they
went out of the Garden in very good terms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
But the unfortunate <hi>Zelotide,</hi> that thought
<U+017F>he had wrought miracles by her di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and
obliged <hi>Lycidas</hi> to a perpetual fidelity, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100546:25"/>
               <p>The Cavalier, <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s friend, and fir<U+017F>t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
was one that had no great bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s
to imploy him<U+017F>elf in, and therefore he made it
his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to <U+017F>eek it out; he was continually
running from place to place, and where ever he
came, <U+017F>etting all he met with together by the
ears; He was in a word, one of tho<U+017F>e Creatures
we call Fopps, Bu<U+017F>ie-bodies, contriving-A<U+017F><U+017F>es,
&amp;c. Fools that neither love them<U+017F>elves nor any
body el<U+017F>e; Confounded Coxcombs that would
willingly undo them<U+017F>elves, might they bury an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in their ruines.</p>
               <p>This vertuous Gentleman was very often with
a company of Ladies, that could not endure our
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> of which, the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable, was
<hi>Cephi<U+017F>a,</hi> <U+017F>ome important. Ca<U+017F>e at Law, or <U+017F>ome
conte<U+017F>t at a meeting about their preeminence
(for truly I was not certainly informed of it) had
rai<U+017F>ed an enmity between their Families, whence
this mortal hatred was tran<U+017F>mitted to our two
fair ones. The quarrel had been decided for
<U+017F>ome months before by their Friends, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and <U+017F>omething like a reconciliation was
made between them; but for all their peaceable
friends could do in it, <U+017F>omething of the old
grudge remained yet, which all the Town was
very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Our Cavalier therefore, that
was mighty great with this Troop of Ladies was
by chance in the Garden, when <hi>Lycidas</hi> led in
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> and <U+017F>eeing them alone by them<U+017F>elves,
was infinitely overjoyed at <U+017F>o happy an occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to <U+017F>earch out what intelligence was betwixt
them, which he <U+017F>hrowdly <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected: To which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100546:25"/>
purpo<U+017F>e he hid him<U+017F>elf among the Trees of a
blind Ally, not far from that in which our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
entertained his <hi>Zelotide,</hi> whence without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perceived, he heard the greate<U+017F>t part of the
Ladies complaints, and di<U+017F>covered, as faith he
well might, that <U+017F>he was pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love
with <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and that more then all this, <U+017F>he
was diveli<U+017F>h jealous of him. Never was any
per<U+017F>on more <U+017F>atisfied at the be<U+017F>t news in the
world, then he at this. He was already framing
ten thou<U+017F>and malicious de<U+017F>ignes again<U+017F>t the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pair, and promi<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf as much diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>ement,
as he could wi<U+017F>h from <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant an
adventure. He was not long, e're he di<U+017F>covered
it to <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a,</hi> and if my intelligence deceive me
not, it was on the very next morning. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Lady is as hugely plea<U+017F>ed with it, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
as well as the Cavalier, to draw no <U+017F>mall
advantage from <U+017F>o welcome a di<U+017F>covery.</p>
               <p>Having laught their Bellies full, together, and
con<U+017F>ulted what they ought to do in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture;
they at la<U+017F>t concluded, that if <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide</hi>
was <U+017F>o jealous of her own Cou<U+017F>in, <U+017F>he would
be abominably jealous of another Lady, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if that Lady were her enemy; and that
therefore, if they could per<U+017F>wade <hi>Lycidas</hi> to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>it
their company, <hi>Zelotide</hi> would even die with
de<U+017F>pite, but before her departure, <U+017F>he would
be guilty of <U+017F>ome pretty extravagancies, which
would give them matter enough to laugh at it.</p>
               <p>After the<U+017F>e grave determinations, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
engaged to bring <hi>Lycidas</hi> to give her a
vi<U+017F>it, and <U+017F>he on her part very confidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100546:26"/>
mi<U+017F>ed him, that <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing he brought him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he <U+017F>hould be made to come again.</p>
               <p>Thus were they plotting, Sir, again<U+017F>t the poor
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> that never dreamed of tho<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>eries
they de<U+017F>igned her, whil<U+017F>t <U+017F>he poor Lady enjoyed
all the happine<U+017F>s <U+017F>he could wi<U+017F>h for, for <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
forbore to <U+017F>ee <hi>Melite,</hi> and had performed
all he was bound to, at lea<U+017F>t, in her opinion he
had. But faith, Sir, to tell you the plain truth,
he was half a weary of <hi>Zelotides</hi> Tyranny, and
without que<U+017F>tion, he had not remained faithful
<U+017F>o long as he did, had not Fear more then Love
per<U+017F>waded him to't, for now he was no longer
ignorant of her Fury and Jealou<U+017F>ie, and feared
them too, no le<U+017F>s, then he loved and admired
her Beauty.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>The <U+017F>weets of Love</l>
                  <l>He <U+017F>till de<U+017F>ir'd to prove,</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But then tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>weets of Love to him would be
In<U+017F>ipid, when for them he lo<U+017F>t his liberty.</p>
               <p>He of the humour he then was, had rather
enjoy the liberty to gaze on all the Ladies
in the
world, without any other advantage, then that
of <U+017F>ub<U+017F>cribing him<U+017F>elf their <U+017F>ervant, then to be
reduced to tho<U+017F>e hard terms of <U+017F>eeing but one,
though <U+017F>he loved and favoured him, as if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth would come together. And it
was this inclination of his, that rendred <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide's</hi>
Empire <U+017F>o odious to him, but he could
not well di<U+017F>ingage him<U+017F>elf; and faith, though
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100546:26"/>
he was a Soldier, I dare <U+017F>wear he dur<U+017F>t not: He
knew Madam <hi>Zelotide</hi> and her confounded hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
well enough, to know what treatment
he mu<U+017F>t expect of her if he for<U+017F>ook her; and
it was not improbable, that her kindred that were
very con<U+017F>iderable in the Town, would very much
re<U+017F>ent his ill u<U+017F>age of the Lady, <U+017F>hould the <U+017F>ecret
ever be di<U+017F>covered, as <U+017F>he was like enough to
do it. So that he was engaged to vi<U+017F>it no other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the Town, and almo<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olved too, and
that as <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly as one of his humour could, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to give her any more rea<U+017F>on to be jealous
of him, But, faith, it was no hard matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troy
his re<U+017F>olutions; and truly our Cavalier,
though no incomparable Orator, had not much
to do to per<U+017F>wade him to go <U+017F>ee the fair <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi<U+017F>a,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> knew very well the pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>tate of the
Town, and by con<U+017F>equence could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of that aver<U+017F>ion <hi>Zelotide</hi> had for her, nor
what his Mi<U+017F>'s <U+017F>entiment would be of this vi<U+017F>it;
and truly this con<U+017F>ideration made him for <U+017F>ome
few minutes, re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the temptation, when the
Gentleman per<U+017F>waded him, but when he was
<U+017F>omething urged to it, both becau<U+017F>e he was her
neighbor, and thereupon at lea<U+017F>t ingaged to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>it
her, and for <U+017F>ome other petty rea<U+017F>ons, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>iderable

For <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> and the ill-natured Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
would not have his new pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion talked of,

               <p>On that very day that <U+017F>he had taken this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olution,
he failed not to wait upon her, and
their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e very happily chancing to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fidelity, he commended his, own to her
with all the vehemence imaginable, and <U+017F>wore

<U+017F>he was plea<U+017F>ed to forbid him the company of

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100546:28"/>
you for vi<U+017F>iting my Cou<U+017F>in, but for Heavens <U+017F>ake
take heed you give me not a more ju<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion
to complain of you upon <U+017F>ome other account.
I have perceived <U+017F>omething<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that makes me very
much <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect your unfaithfulne<U+017F>s; for Gods <U+017F>ake
do not ju<U+017F>tifie my <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions and let it not be
true, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> affects <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> You know I
hate her mo<U+017F>t mortally, and that I had rather you
<U+017F>hould wait on all the Ladies in the Town, then
that enemy of our Family. And know, Sir, it is
not without rea<U+017F>on I tell you of her.</p>
               <p>On Sunday you <U+017F>aluted her at Church with
greater re<U+017F>pect then I could have wi<U+017F>hed, and
<U+017F>he returned your reverence with an obliging
Air, and a look <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate, that it plainly
witne<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>ome intelligence betwixt you.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> I <U+017F>aw your Man and her Maid
together, in <U+017F>o familiar a conference, that I fear
the Ma<U+017F>ter and Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s were concerned in
it.</p>
               <p>On Tue<U+017F>day I was informed, though not from
you, Sir, you changed your Lodging near <hi>Cephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>a's,</hi>
and that your Landlady had <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her, and was <U+017F>till very often with her. This
Neighborhood, this Landlady, and this Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
between them, you mu<U+017F>t needs grant is
<U+017F>u<U+017F>picious.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Wedne<U+017F>day</hi> you pardoned a Soldier that
fled his Colours, at the Reque<U+017F>t of the Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of my Enemy, though you had refu<U+017F>ed
before to pardon him, when all the Town en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:100546:28"/>
On <hi>Thur<U+017F>day</hi> when her Coach was over-turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
you broke through the croud to help her,
though I am confident you were not ignorant,
that you would have very much obliged me,
had you let her die there.</p>
               <p>And ye<U+017F>terday, I was told that you took her
Taylor and Shoomaker; and faith, Sir<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> I mu<U+017F>t
tell you, people think very <U+017F>trangely of the<U+017F>e
Taylors and Shoomakers, that work both for
Men as well as Women; there are tho<U+017F>e will
<U+017F>wear they meddle with <U+017F>omething el<U+017F>e be<U+017F>ides
their Trade; and making Shooes and Cloaths is
not all they are employed in: the Taylor e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
tho<U+017F>e gentile Mechanicks, that can with
<U+017F>uch a dre<U+017F>s, joyn Breeches and Peticoats.</p>
               <p>So that there is not one day all this week, that
I have not had ju<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect you. For
to compleat the week, this morning I am very
credibly informed, that in company where you
were, you commended <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> before all the
Ladies in the Town. And now, <U+017F>weet Sir, let
me a<U+017F><U+017F>ume the confidence to demand of you,
whither one can prai<U+017F>e a Lady <U+017F>o extreamly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing her, or know her without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me; <U+017F>ince I hate her unmercifully, and it is
the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible affront I can receive of any
friend of mine, to vi<U+017F>it her.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Zelotide</hi> had ended her Bill of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Lycidas</hi> did all he could to pacify her. He
proved to her that all her <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions were very
<U+017F>lightly grounded, and at la<U+017F>t made no con<U+017F>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to <U+017F>wear to her mo<U+017F>t Religiou<U+017F>ly, that, he
never went to <U+017F>ee that Lady, nor never would
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100546:29"/>
while he breathed. <hi>Zelotide</hi> was willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, but all his Rhetorick could not ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
per<U+017F>wade her, and undoubtedly your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highne<U+017F>s will not blame her incredulity, which
was at pre<U+017F>ent mo<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>onable. The poor jealous
Lady after a trouble<U+017F>ome night, gave order next
morning to her Lacquey, to go take a fit po<U+017F>t
in a blind Allie before <hi>Cephi<U+017F>as</hi> Gate, to <U+017F>ee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being di<U+017F>covered, whether <hi>Lycidas</hi> entred
there or no.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>The little fool might then have cur'd</l>
                  <l>Tho<U+017F>e tortures <U+017F>he endur'd</l>
                  <l>And by an inn'cent lie</l>
                  <l>Her re<U+017F>t, her peace procur'd</l>
                  <l>And <U+017F>ilenc'd her di<U+017F>tracting jealou<U+017F>ie.</l>
                  <l>Thus di<U+017F>obedience might his faith expre<U+017F>s;</l>
                  <l>He'd <U+017F>erv'd her better had he obey'd her le<U+017F>s.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>She was now a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'dly her too zealous Lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey,
that <U+017F>he was abu<U+017F>ed, and-that her Lover
vi<U+017F>ited her Enemy; <U+017F>he longed to <U+017F>ee him again-to
puni<U+017F>h him for his mi<U+017F>demeanors. But <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
not coming all next day to wait upon her,
<U+017F>eeing it was fair, and fit for a walk, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed
towards the evening to turn <U+017F>cout her <U+017F>elf,
and go watch the unfaithful <hi>Lycidas;</hi> upon this
de<U+017F>igne <U+017F>he takes onely her Lacquey with her,
and under pretence of going to <U+017F>ee a Woman,
that nurs'd a Child of hers, and that lived
in the Suburbs; where <U+017F>he knew that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi<U+017F>a</hi>
and all her company commonly walked,
<U+017F>he <U+017F>tood Sentinel in the Hou<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ee whether
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100546:29"/>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> were among them. But all her trouble,
that <U+017F>he gave her <U+017F>elf, was to no purpo<U+017F>e, for <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi<U+017F>a</hi>
being <U+017F>omething indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, went not out
that evening, and <hi>Zelotide</hi> was now benighted,
when <U+017F>he returned homewards. As <U+017F>he was going
through the <U+017F>treet where <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> lived, and was
got hard by the Gate, <U+017F>he heard <hi>Lycidas</hi> his voice
not above <U+017F>ix yards from her; whereupon <U+017F>he
<U+017F>topped to hearken what he <U+017F>aid, and was not
long e're <U+017F>he heard him <U+017F>peak to the Cavalier,
and promi<U+017F>ed him to <U+017F>tay for him at <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi>'s.
Being now an Ear-witne<U+017F>s of his unfaithfulne<U+017F>s,
<U+017F>he thought on nothing, but following the dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
of her Anger and Jealou<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>he Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her Lacquey to retire, and making u<U+017F>e of the
favour of the night, <U+017F>he entred the Gate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
di<U+017F>covery, and <U+017F>o got upon the Stair-ca<U+017F>e
where <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olved to expect <hi>Lycidas; Lycidas</hi>
having left the Cavalier, entred very briskly,
and never dreaming of the Ambu<U+017F>cado that was
laid for him.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Spurr'd on by Love, away he run,</l>
                  <l>And up the Stairs he got as <U+017F>oon</l>
                  <l>In <U+017F>pite of night, as if he'd <U+017F>een the Sun.</l>

               <p>But your Royal Highne<U+017F>s may very well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
how <U+017F>urprized he was, when he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
<U+017F>topped, and perceived he was in the
Arms of a Woman; he thought at fir<U+017F>t it had

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100546:30"/>
him (for he never <U+017F>o much as thought of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotide</hi>)
and hereupon cryed out; <hi>Fair</hi> Cephi<U+017F>a,
<hi>you thought to frighten me, and thought I <U+017F>hould
not know you; but your bright Eies have betrayed
you, and their light Madam, hath <U+017F>poiled your plot

I mu<U+017F>t have <U+017F>atisfaction for this malicious

                  <l>Had but the jealous Creature let him do't,</l>

                  <l>Spite of her <U+017F>elf, he had her <U+017F>elf appeas'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But he was <U+017F>trangely a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed, when in <U+017F>tead
of that Courte<U+017F>ie, he expected, the unknown
Lady care<U+017F>s'd him with all her natural weapons,;
Tooth and Nail <U+017F>he was at it, and her Feet were
not idle neither. For anger had <U+017F>o tran<U+017F>ported
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> that at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>he had lo<U+017F>t the u<U+017F>e of her

               <p>All that ever the poor <hi>Lycidas</hi> could do in this

he had, to carry her away in his Arms, and
bear her by plain force into the <U+017F>treet; for he
very wi<U+017F>ely con<U+017F>idered, that <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi>'s Stair-ca<U+017F>e

what come of it. But he could not carry her
away <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddainly, but <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> heard the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100546:31"/>
noi<U+017F>e, though <U+017F>he knew not exactly what the
matter was, and the noi<U+017F>e cea<U+017F>ing on the <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
<U+017F>he believed that <U+017F>ome of the Hou<U+017F>hold

               <p>At la<U+017F>t <hi>Lycidas</hi> having got <hi>Zelotide</hi> into the
<U+017F>treet, and given her his hand to lead her home,
he began to <U+017F>how how imprudently <U+017F>he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
her <U+017F>elf; how that if her extravagance
had been known, <U+017F>he would have given a very

to laugh at, nay, and all the Town too, and
that hence-forward <U+017F>he ought to take a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
care of her Honour and Reputation. Take thou
then a greater care of it, replyed the poor Lady
weeping; <hi>Cruel Man! <U+017F>ince thou knowe<U+017F>t to what

enforced to confe<U+017F>s it was not <U+017F>o great as you would
plea<U+017F>e to make it. The fir<U+017F>t vi<U+017F>it I made Cephi<U+017F>a,
I was ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>itated to. You remember,
Madam, that day the Coach was overturned, I
happened to be <U+017F>o nigh the place, that civility enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me to <U+017F>uccor the Lady; and then it was, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that <hi>I</hi> was con<U+017F>trained to lead her home; on the
morrow <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent her Husband to return me thanks
for my civility, <U+017F>o that I <U+017F>hould have been the meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t
Clown in nature, had I not waited upon her.
About two or three days after, <hi>I</hi> went to acquit
my <U+017F>elf of this obligation, and there I met a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
at Cards, where they would needs make me a
Game<U+017F>ter; and then having lo<U+017F>t all my Money, not to
abu<U+017F>e you, Madam, it was that onely con<U+017F>ideration
drew me thither, as Game<U+017F>ters mo<U+017F>t commonly do all
they can to <U+017F>ave them<U+017F>elves. It is true, Madam, I
never made you acquainted with it, and I was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100546:32"/>
it might di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e you, <U+017F>hould you come to know of
it; and I cannot deny neither, <U+017F>ince you will know all,
that <U+017F>ometimes when I was at <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a's,</hi> I never
playd neither, but be plea<U+017F>ed to know then, it was
becau<U+017F>e I found no convenient company; and you
know very will, Madam, <U+017F>ince your Husbands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to Town, I cannot have the liberty to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you <U+017F>o often as I could wi<U+017F>h, <U+017F>o that not knowing
whither to go, I have <U+017F>ometimes gone thither; this
Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a's</hi> is not far from my Lodging,
<U+017F>o that I have <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome hours there, more for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tom
or convenience, then for any inclination: I have
been there <U+017F>ometimes after dinner, but faith; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
it was becau<U+017F>e I knew not how to <U+017F>pend my
time el<U+017F>ewhere, and <U+017F>ometimes a cro<U+017F>s humour of mine
hath kept me there, only out of de<U+017F>ign to vex the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and the Cavalier, for I <U+017F>aw my pre<U+017F>ence gave
re<U+017F>traint to their company, <U+017F>o that, Madam, did
you but know how I carry my <U+017F>elf there, hating
<hi>Caphi<U+017F>a</hi> as much as you can for the hear of you;
you would be very well <U+017F>atisfied at tho<U+017F>e vi<U+017F>its I
render her: <U+017F>ometimes I compliment her, but it is
after <U+017F>o mad a <U+017F>train, that neither <U+017F>he, nor I my
<U+017F>elf under<U+017F>tand a word of it: and after all the<U+017F>e
obliging fooleries for diverti<U+017F>ement, I pick a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with her, and rip up all her faults to her face;
in a word, Madam, I treat her like a per<U+017F>on that
you hate.</p>
               <p>I believe, Sir, the<U+017F>e excu<U+017F>es will not <U+017F>eem very

but <hi>Zelotide</hi> I can a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, heard them

the fear <U+017F>he conceived of lo<U+017F>ing <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and

with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, after <U+017F>uch an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when <U+017F>he might rea<U+017F>onably expect he would
have broke with her, appea<U+017F>ed her in<U+017F>tantly,
nay and made her repent too of her ra<U+017F>h pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings:
<U+017F>he promi<U+017F>ed therefore <hi>Lycidas</hi> to
love him as much as ever, upon condition he
would no more <U+017F>ee <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a. Lycidas</hi> told her,
he could not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon leave off <U+017F>eeing her, le<U+017F>t it
might occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trange reports in the
Town, and make people <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect them; but he
a<U+017F><U+017F>ured her, the next time he played there, he
would rai<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome quarrel, that he might have
<U+017F>ome pretence for his retreat thence. <hi>Zelotide</hi>
was very well <U+017F>atisfied with his de<U+017F>ign.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>So the two Lovers march'd along,</l>
                  <l>And o're and o're</l>
                  <l>They vow'd and <U+017F>wore</l>

                  <l>Would their true Love and <U+017F>weet contentment wrong.</l>
                  <l>The peace thus formally concluded was,</l>
                  <l>When <hi>Zelotide</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>The more to <U+017F>trengthen it, thought good</l>
                  <l>To Sign the Treaty with their Blood.</l>
                  <l>They now redoubled all their kindne<U+017F><U+017F>es,</l>

               <p>When <hi>Lycidas</hi> promi<U+017F>ed <hi>Zelotide</hi> to di<U+017F>ingage
him<U+017F>elfe from <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a,</hi> he really intended it. But
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100546:33"/>
he no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw that lovely Lady, but he grew
con<U+017F>cious of his di<U+017F>ability to perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>es.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>For when he <U+017F>aw the pretty Dame again,</l>
                  <l>His Faith recoil'd,</l>
                  <l>His Loyalty was ba<U+017F>ely foil'd,</l>
                  <l>Nor could he any more his word maintain,</l>
                  <l>And if he <U+017F>aw her once, he mu<U+017F>t again.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And be<U+017F>ides all this, he had not yet obtained
the fruition of his wi<U+017F>hes, and a ki<U+017F>s, and the like,
had been all he had yet received of her, <U+017F>o that
re<U+017F>olving not to lo<U+017F>e all that trouble he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ingaged in, he pur<U+017F>ued his vi<U+017F>its; the jealous
Lady was very well acquainted with them, but
when ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke of them to <hi>Lycidas,</hi> he told
her he was ju<U+017F>t upon the point to leave her, and
that he had not yet found any occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>tart a
quarrel, as he told her he would.</p>
               <p>That plotting Fop the Cavalier did not yet
know a word of what had pa<U+017F>t upon the Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>o that he <U+017F>uffered a very con<U+017F>iderable lo<U+017F>s
in it, for had he come to know <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant an
adventure, that malice of his that was <U+017F>o natural
to him, had drawn very fine advantages thence,
and that talkative humour of his, would have been
extreamly gratified in publi<U+017F>hing the <U+017F>ecret with
all the expedition imaginable. But though he
mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed of this, he hit upon one far better, and
he was continually hammering <U+017F>omething to
di<U+017F>turb the be<U+017F>t friends he had in the world,
he lighted on a mo<U+017F>t cur<U+017F>ed Intrigue that plagued
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100546:33"/>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Zelotide</hi> no le<U+017F>s, then it <U+017F>atisfied the
Author and <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One evening, that was one of the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>erene
and plea<U+017F>ant that ever had been <U+017F>een, and that
invited all the Town to walk Abroad in <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet
a <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on; all the hand<U+017F>ome Creatures in the
Town, went abroad to take the Air in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
I told you of before. <hi>Lycidas</hi> led <hi>Zelotide</hi>
thither too, where they had not taken above
three or four turns, before the Cavalier and
<hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> di<U+017F>covered them, and thinking they had
a mo<U+017F>t happy opportunity to practice a diveli<U+017F>h
project of theirs, that they had been plotting for
<U+017F>ome time before, they re<U+017F>olved to put it in pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice.
The Gentleman projector would needs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
it him<U+017F>elf, who meeting a Lacquey of a
Friend of his, gave him inductions what he had
to do, and to encourage him to perform his part
with the greater willingne<U+017F>s, gave him <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
the Lacquey was very willing to <U+017F>erve
him, and took the Letter that the Cavalier had
provided before hand, and following the orders
had been given him, he went to <U+017F>eek out <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
and having found him without any great
difficulty, he delivered him the Letter in <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide's</hi>
company, and told him a Lady that he
knew not, had commanded him to give him it.
The young Rogue <U+017F>taid not long enough to be
asked many que<U+017F>tions, but immediately di<U+017F>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
(if I can properly <U+017F>ay one di<U+017F>appears in
the night, when there is almo<U+017F>t no appearing)
The Letter produced mo<U+017F>t effectually what it
was de<U+017F>igned for. For <hi>Zelotide</hi> con<U+017F>idering how
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100546:34"/>
it was delivered; <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected <U+017F>ome new
engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thought <hi>Lycidas</hi> was got again at his
infidelity.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now for <U+017F>ome Trea<U+017F>on <hi>Lycidas</hi>

                  <l>Su<U+017F>pected was.</l>

                  <l>Reviv'd her Jealou<U+017F>ie.</l>
                  <l>Whil<U+017F>t her cur<U+017F>t humour did her <U+017F>oul in<U+017F>pire,</l>
                  <l>From the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>park, <U+017F>he'd <U+017F>trait advance a fire.</l>

                  <l>And what you would not have her <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>he wou'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>It was for this rea<U+017F>on that <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>natch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Letter out of <hi>Lycidas's</hi> hands, and was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
re<U+017F>olved to read it: the two <U+017F>pies that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance, and were a preparing
them<U+017F>elves to laugh their guts out, were not at
all deceived in their expectation. They heard
<hi>Zelotide</hi> very urgent with <hi>Lycidas</hi> to go
out of
the Garden, to <U+017F>ee for a Light to read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
while that poor Lover was di<U+017F><U+017F>wading her
to no purpo<U+017F>e. For though he was wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
whence the Billet came, he was fearful there
might be <U+017F>omething in it, that her jealou<U+017F>ie might
make <U+017F>ome ill interpretation of, and for this
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
he did all he could to keep her in the Garden,
and u<U+017F>ed all the wit he was ma<U+017F>ter of to get the
Letter from her. But his endeavors proved
<U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>sle<U+017F>s,
and <hi>Zelotide</hi> <U+017F>pying a Light in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners,
<U+017F>he forced <hi>Lycidas</hi> thither with her. The
poor Gentleman <U+017F>o hung an Ar<U+017F>e, you might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily
perceive, with what regret he went forward,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100546:34"/>
and the jealous Lady trooped along with <U+017F>uch
precipitation, that by her pace you might <U+017F>ee her
impatience. <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> and the Cavalier
followed
them undi<U+017F>covered, and took a very convenient
po<U+017F>t under a little blind window of a ground-Chamber,
whence they might ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee without
di<U+017F>covery, and hear through the Gla<U+017F>s all that pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
between the Lovers. The impatient Creature
was no <U+017F>ooner got nigh a Lamp, that gave light to
all the little hou<U+017F>e, but <U+017F>he examined the Seal of
the Letter, but not knowing it <U+017F>he at la<U+017F>t open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, but faith, drew as little <U+017F>atisfaction from
that, as <U+017F>he had from the Seal before; <U+017F>he found
nothing there but <U+017F>trange conjuring kind of
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
that <U+017F>he under<U+017F>tood not one tittle of;
and it is very probable no body el<U+017F>e. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible
to tell you what an exce<U+017F>s of grief and
de<U+017F>pite, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ented at <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange a
rencounter.
She was pre<U+017F>ently per<U+017F>waded that the<U+017F>e were
<U+017F>ome Cyphers or other that <hi>Lycidas</hi>
under<U+017F>tood,
and that without que<U+017F>tion, this Billet invited him
to <U+017F>ome A<U+017F><U+017F>ignation with <U+017F>ome new
Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s of
his. Hereupon <U+017F>he begs of him, <U+017F>he threatens
him, <U+017F>he per<U+017F>ecutes him to di<U+017F>cover this
My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tery.
But the Divel was in him if he did, for he
under<U+017F>tood no more of it, then <U+017F>he did, and all
he could do, was to <U+017F>wear he could not devi<U+017F>e
the meaning of it, that without doubt the
Lacquey and mi<U+017F>taken him for <U+017F>ome body el<U+017F>e,
and delivered the Letter to a fal<U+017F>e per<U+017F>on. All this
was true, he told her, for the Cavalier had <U+017F>crib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
over the Paper with tho<U+017F>e Arabian Pothooks,
onely to di<U+017F>tract the poor <hi>Zelotide,</hi> and expo<U+017F>e
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100546:35"/>
her ridiculous jealou<U+017F>ie and extravagance: But
<hi>Lycydas</hi> might <U+017F>wear long enough before <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
him; <U+017F>he <U+017F>till re<U+017F>ted per<U+017F>waded <U+017F>he was
betrayed again by the unfaithful <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and
took this Letter for an undoubted proof of it.
Being grown now almo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>perate, and never
hoping to get the <U+017F>ecret out of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> <U+017F>he
makes u<U+017F>e of her la<U+017F>t effects of Goodne<U+017F>s, of

that it came from his Si<U+017F>ter, about <U+017F>ome bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s

               <p>This re<U+017F>olution <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>o plau<U+017F>ible to her, that
<U+017F>he pre<U+017F>erved it for <U+017F>ome days, and while <U+017F>he was
in this mind, <U+017F>he very happily met an Officer of
the Regiment, that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>ome little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of, and that was a very intimate friend of
our <hi>Lycidas's,</hi> and if I am not very much
mi<U+017F>taken, <U+017F>he met him as <U+017F>he was coming out of
the Church one day. The Officer, being very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
to the Ladies, as all <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s his Chronies
mu<U+017F>t needs be, offered her his <U+017F>ervice to hand
her to her Coach, which <U+017F>he very willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he imagined, <U+017F>he might learn
of him the ground of the quarrel; and truly,
though my Author mentions it hot, I can ea<U+017F>ily
be per<U+017F>waded, it was as well to get a new <U+017F>ervant,
as to enquire after the old one. The Officer was
extreamly <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>ee her ignorant of what
all the Town talked of, and wherein <U+017F>he had <U+017F>o
particular a concern, and could not believe but
that it was only a piece of her Countenance, to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100546:40"/>
endeavour to per<U+017F>wade him that <U+017F>he was not the
cau<U+017F>e of it. But <U+017F>he <U+017F>poke to him <U+017F>o <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly,
and <U+017F>o earne<U+017F>tly intreated him to inform her,
that at la<U+017F>t he was per<U+017F>waded to it, both to <U+017F>erve
the Lady, and do <hi>Lycidas</hi> a kindne<U+017F>s: He a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ured
her therefore, that the Garden-adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was known all the Town over; that <hi>Cephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>a</hi>
and the Cavalier had divulged it, having fir<U+017F>t
been the eye-witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of it in the Garden; that
the Cavalier was Author of that Letter that had
made all that di<U+017F>turbance, and that talking of it
in all company he came into, <hi>Lycidas</hi> came to
hear of it, and judging him<U+017F>elf in Honour obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to demand rea<U+017F>on for the injury; and
Duel a per<U+017F>on that had expo<U+017F>ed that Lady
that he mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately affected, to the laughtter
and abu<U+017F>ive raillery of all the Town<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> he
wounded the Cavalier, though not dangerou<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was taken up at Madam <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi<U+017F>a</hi>'s,
becau<U+017F>e her Husband had very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
him<U+017F>elf in their agreement.</p>
               <p>Though this Relation very much afflicted <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotide,</hi>
when <U+017F>he heard how her extravagancies
were laughed at, and what an ill opinion the
Town might ju<U+017F>tly conceive of her Vertue, yet
<U+017F>he could not chu<U+017F>e in the mid<U+017F>t of all her <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
but re<U+017F>ent the greate<U+017F>t joy conceivable.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>She lov'd her Honour ne'r the wor<U+017F>e for this,</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>Yet Love mu<U+017F>t bear down all, what e'r it is.</l>

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:100546:40"/>
Her kind e<U+017F>teem of both of them was great,</l>
                  <l>Great as e<U+017F>teem divided well could be,</l>
                  <l>But if the one of them mu<U+017F>t needs retreat,</l>
                  <l>Poor Honour then that one mu<U+017F>t be.</l>
                  <l>Love forc'd her to't with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>weet nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity</l>
                  <l>That what e'r Honour urg'd in his defence,</l>
                  <l>Was foolery,</l>
                  <l>Scarce Sence.</l>
                  <l>Thus that <U+017F>he might her Love more truly prove,</l>
                  <l>She <U+017F>acrific'd her Honour to her Love.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>So that, Sir, you may ea<U+017F>ily imagine that <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide</hi>
was not extreamly troubled, and that <U+017F>he
could admit of <U+017F>ome Con<U+017F>olation in the mid<U+017F>t of
her afflictions; for though <U+017F>he had lo<U+017F>t her
reputation, <U+017F>he was more concerned at the lo<U+017F>s
of her Lover, whom now <U+017F>he hoped <U+017F>he might
recover. She could now no longer pre<U+017F>erve her
anger again<U+017F>t <hi>Lycidas,</hi> <U+017F>ince <U+017F>he found her <U+017F>u<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of him were unju<U+017F>t, and he was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
than <U+017F>he imagined, and had behaved
him<U+017F>elf like a Man of Honour in maintaining
the intere<U+017F>ts of his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s with <U+017F>uch vigor, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
the malice of a Rival, and the raillery of
an Enemy. And then <U+017F>he immediately was plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
how to revenge her <U+017F>elf on <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> and the
Cavalier, but <U+017F>he thought it now more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to think of Love than Revenge, and by all
means to recall her <hi>Lycidas.</hi> She would not let
<U+017F>lip <U+017F>o happy an opportunity, but humbly thank'd
the Courteous Officer for the trouble he was
plea<U+017F>ed to give him<U+017F>elf in acquainting her with
the cau<U+017F>e, and full relation of the quarrel;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100546:41"/>
again a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him, that till that moment <U+017F>he
had been kept in ignorance of what <U+017F>o much
concerned her; <U+017F>he told him, <U+017F>he acknowledged
her <U+017F>elf infinitely obliged to <hi>Lycidas</hi> for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of her Honour, and having now found by
his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, that the Officer was <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
and acquainted with all his <U+017F>ecrets, <U+017F>he
very ingeniou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed to him, that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inclination, <U+017F>he had for his friend, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by this obliging confidence drawn him into
her Intere<U+017F>t; <U+017F>he avow'd to him, that <hi>Lycidas</hi>
had never <U+017F>een her <U+017F>ince the adventure in the
Garden; that <U+017F>he was intollerably troubled at it,
and that he would oblige her eternally, would
he bring his friend along with him to honour her
with a vi<U+017F>it; that the chief rea<U+017F>on why <U+017F>he longed
to <U+017F>ee him, was to beg his pardon for her unju<U+017F>t
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pitions of him, and expre<U+017F>s her gratitude for
the zeal he u<U+017F>ed in her <U+017F>ervice.</p>
               <p>This civil obliging Officer promi<U+017F>ed her all
<U+017F>ee de<U+017F>ired of him, and <U+017F>o left her, with a firm
re<U+017F>olution to oblige <hi>Lycidas</hi> to wait upon her as
much as formerly. The Lady had mov'd him
with her pretty-taking conver<U+017F>ation, and her
Wit and Beauty plea<U+017F>ed him <U+017F>o much, and <U+017F>he
was <U+017F>o wholly amiable in his Eies, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<U+017F>he de<U+017F>erv'd to be <U+017F>erved with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tancy
in the world; that any Man of Honour
or Con<U+017F>cience ought to re<U+017F>t <U+017F>atisfied with <U+017F>uch a
happine<U+017F>s, and that his friend was too too blame
for his infidelity to <U+017F>o incomparable a Lady;
and truly it <U+017F>eems he really thought <U+017F>o, for he
kept his word mo<U+017F>t exactly; he told <hi>Lycidas</hi> of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100546:41"/>
all the di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e he had with <hi>Zelotide,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to him, that he was engaged to wait upon
her, that he ought to take tho<U+017F>e extrvagant ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of her jealou<U+017F>ie for the marks of an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
affection, and that if Love could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to <U+017F>ee her, yet fear might per<U+017F>wade
him to't, for what might he not with ju<U+017F>tice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
from a Lady as mad and de<U+017F>perate, as
amorous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycidas,</hi> <U+017F>ince his Quarrel with the Cavalier,
had not <U+017F>een <hi>Zelotide</hi> indeed, but then neither
had he <U+017F>een <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a,</hi> having learned that <U+017F>he was
an accomplice of his enemy; and <U+017F>o at that
time his Love lay fallow, and without employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For, Sir, I cannot ju<U+017F>tly count tho<U+017F>e for
vi<U+017F>its, that he made then (for it <U+017F>eems by my

of the Town then two, though I have not
learned their names nor quality) becau<U+017F>e he
could not lo<U+017F>e his liberty to any of the Ladies.
But his humour would not permit him to live

there needed not much per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion to draw him

her laughing had co<U+017F>t her dear, and that her

Nay, <U+017F>he pur<U+017F>ued her <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion <U+017F>till and told
him, that if by any fault of another nature, <U+017F>he
could expiate her pa<U+017F>t one, <U+017F>he was ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in it, and prefer his Love to her Innocence;
and that in a word, <U+017F>he would mo<U+017F>t willingly
procure his pardon at the expence of what <U+017F>he
held mo<U+017F>t dear in the world. The cunning La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
managed her bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s rood incomparably, for
the pacified <hi>Lycidas</hi> founded his happine<U+017F>s upon
her promi<U+017F>es, and truly his hopes did not abu<U+017F>e

home again, where the peace was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the great contentment of both parties.
After this formality was once over, they agreed
upon certain rules for their living together in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
intelligence, and managing their plea<U+017F>ures
for the future with prudence, the longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

being very unwilling to cla<U+017F>h with her any

<U+017F>hould be only out of policy, to avoid any new

the <U+017F>piritual and ingenious per<U+017F>ons of the Town
made her Hou<U+017F>e their Rendezvous; and then
he <U+017F>wore he had no private acquaintance with

thus the pretty Gentleman deceived the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, You <U+017F>ee all is quiet, the Cavalier
and the two Rival Ladies agree very well with

a new di<U+017F>order among them, and di<U+017F>turb their

               <p>A Con<U+017F>in of <hi>Zelotides,</hi> we called her <hi>Cleonice</hi>
in the beginning of this Hi<U+017F>tory, was to marry

kin<U+017F>man of <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi>'s (but faith, I cannot tell

but they concealed their enmity; they
faintly <U+017F>aluted, one another when they chanced

that was de<U+017F>igned for the Groom had been an

Highne<U+017F>s in Pro<U+017F>e as well as Ver<U+017F>e, for that day
to renounce both his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and apply him<U+017F>elf
to Madam <hi>Cleonice.</hi> Being <U+017F>he was the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s
of the hou<U+017F>e, and he had <U+017F>ome acquaintance

body ever <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected him of any particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with her, he thought he had taken
the le<U+017F>s dangerous re<U+017F>olution, and that by this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
means he might keep his Favour with both his
Ladies. And truly the reasonable <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> was
contented to <U+017F>ee him be<U+017F>tow his love any where
el<U+017F>e but on <hi>Zelotide,</hi> and reckoned her <U+017F>elf infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
engaged to him; but <hi>Zelotide</hi> was not of <U+017F>o
tame a humour, <U+017F>he could not endure that her
<U+017F>ervant <U+017F>hould care<U+017F>s any body be<U+017F>ides her dear
<U+017F>elf; and though <U+017F>he was overjoyed to <U+017F>ee that
<hi>Lycidas</hi> did not <U+017F>o much as look upon <hi>Cephi<U+017F>as;</hi>
<U+017F>he was not <U+017F>atisfied with that, but would have
had him ca<U+017F>t an Eye on no body el<U+017F>e: but her
prudence in this conjuncture, ma<U+017F>tered her <U+017F>oul,
and concealed her re<U+017F>entments, <U+017F>o that by her
actions none could judge of her inward motions,
though <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffered all the torments that Rage
and Jealou<U+017F>ie could inflict, while our <hi>Lycidas</hi> at
the Ball, at the Banquet, or where ever he was,
was always with Madam <hi>Cleonice,</hi> and carried
him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>o di<U+017F>creetly, that one would have <U+017F>worn
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100546:47"/>
he had not the lea<U+017F>t inclination for <hi>Zelotide</hi> or

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> came off thus a day and for <U+017F>ome
part of the night, till the Lady was brought
whither <U+017F>he would be, to her Husbands em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
(for hang it, now that dull name mu<U+017F>t be
u<U+017F>ed) where we <U+017F>hall leave them between the
Sheets to their plea<U+017F>ures, (for, for the fir<U+017F>t night
they will be <U+017F>omething <U+017F>atisfied with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the re<U+017F>t do, for you may gue<U+017F>s at the married

to leave the company to go and give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for <U+017F>omething about the hou<U+017F>e, and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas,</hi>
though he was very unwilling to part
with her, was at la<U+017F>t forced to leave her; <U+017F>o
that now he was at a lo<U+017F>s how to carry him<U+017F>elf<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
The Ladies were at play in two <U+017F>everal compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
whereof <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> was of the one, and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotide</hi>
of the other. So that for fear of di<U+017F>plea<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either of his Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es, he would not <U+017F>trike
in there: and the Men were as hot a fudling as
can be imagined, and the greater part of them
even dead drunk, with a pretty kind of Wine
they had got, that charm'd them <U+017F>o <U+017F>weetly, that
they could have been content to have died over
again, might they have <U+017F>o agreeable an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.
<hi>Lycidas</hi> was engaged there for <U+017F>ome
time, but <U+017F>taied not long among them; for this
<U+017F>port di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ed him wor<U+017F>e then the former, <U+017F>o
that at la<U+017F>t he thought it be<U+017F>t to leave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and retire into <U+017F>ome dark chamber, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<U+017F>peaking a Syllable, le<U+017F>t he might be di<U+017F><U+017F>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100546:47"/>
from his re<U+017F>olution. He was no <U+017F>ooner got
where he intended, and laid him<U+017F>elf upon a Bed,
that very happily he light upon in the dark, but
finding him<U+017F>elf exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive weary with Dancing,
he compo<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf to take a nap, where he
fell a<U+017F>leep very <U+017F>oundly, with his Cloaths on,
and had lain ruff all night, had not a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant
adventure rai<U+017F>ed him: He had not been
a<U+017F>leep much above an hour (it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible it
might be an hour and half quarter) when he
felt <U+017F>omething pull him by the Arm, and he was
not well awake, when by <U+017F>ome care<U+017F><U+017F>ing, and
amorous kind of injuries, he perceived <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides</hi>
voice; the prudent Gentleman fore<U+017F>eeing
what inconveniences might hence ari<U+017F>e, if <U+017F>he
was caught with him in the dark, told her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
civilly, <U+017F>he expo<U+017F>ed her <U+017F>elf to too great a
danger; that <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervant might ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them together, and that the pre<U+017F>ervation of
her Honour engaged her to leave him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and avoid the di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure that <U+017F>he mu<U+017F>t
of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity re<U+017F>ent, if any one <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ple them
together.</p>
               <p>Any other Lover le<U+017F>s prudent then <hi>Lycidas,</hi>
would not have troubled him<U+017F>elf to mind his
Mi<U+017F>tri<U+017F>s of her Duty in <U+017F>o happy an occa<U+017F>ion;
but, Sir, I am engaged to avow it to your
Royal Highne<U+017F>s, for I know <hi>Lycidas</hi> to be
naturally a very prudent per<U+017F>on, and one
that loves to lay his Love-Intrigues as <U+017F>ure as
can be.</p>
               <p>But how gravely <U+017F>oever he preached to the
Lady, it was ail to no purpo<U+017F>e: <hi>Zelotide</hi> told
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100546:48"/>
him that <U+017F>he had ju<U+017F>t left play, and had left all
the company mighty eager at it; that all their
Husbands and their Servants were half drunk;
that <U+017F>he thinking to find him there by him<U+017F>elf,
had <U+017F>toln up to him very <U+017F>ecretly; that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
would mind her ab<U+017F>ence, or if they did, would
think <U+017F>he was gone to Bed; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he might
without the lea<U+017F>t danger enjoy his <U+017F>weet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
for <U+017F>ome few moments.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Forgetting then his danger, up he drew,</l>

                  <l>Now his dull prudence he did <U+017F>oon reject,</l>

               <p>The Lady when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her Gallant full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>waded,
took her place very obligingly on the
Bed-<U+017F>ide next the Wall, and begun a very plea<U+017F>ant
entertainment with the too too happy <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
whereat both parties were very well <U+017F>atisfied,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100546:48"/>
and I am confident, would never have been
tired before morning, had not an unlucky acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
intervened. The Lady had not long enjoyed
what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired, before <U+017F>he heard, as well as <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas,</hi>
<U+017F>ome noi<U+017F>e upon the Stairs. This <U+017F>uddain
trouble<U+017F>ome noi<U+017F>e obliged them to keep <U+017F>ilence,
and hearken what the matter was; immediately
after they heard their Chamber door open, and
<U+017F>ome body come into them. Your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
may very well imagine what a condition
this unexpected rencounter put our two Lovers
in, they were afraid of all the world, and the
<U+017F>malle<U+017F>t fortune they could hope for, was to be
found together with <hi>Zelotides</hi> good Husband.
This, exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive fear of theirs had rendred them
immoveable, and <U+017F>o they continued till <hi>Lycidas</hi>
felt <U+017F>ome thing very gently pull him by the Hair.
He <U+017F>tirred not for all that, but <U+017F>norted mo<U+017F>t cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiou<U+017F>ly,
to per<U+017F>wade the unknown Creature, if
he could, that he was <U+017F>ound a<U+017F>leep; but whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

the Debauche's, but not finding him there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

chamber; <hi>Zelotide</hi> that was got on the other <U+017F>ide
of the Bed, dur<U+017F>t not <U+017F>o much as breath with

that which very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly augmented the<U+017F>e her

Sentiments, and unravel her Re<U+017F>entments;
But though <U+017F>he dur<U+017F>t not let her Rival

her Teeth and Nails could reach, <U+017F>he claw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

He <U+017F>aid no more, but taking her away with a

Whereupon, very wi<U+017F>ely con<U+017F>idering for

he offered to inform the company of the true

that they had not time to call for a light;
that in the dark, not <U+017F>eeing one another, they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the Stair-head to ju<U+017F>tle very furiou<U+017F>ly; And
that having no good will for one another, as all
the Town knows, they took it for an abu<U+017F>e: And
thereupon came to words about it, and from words
to blows, <U+017F>o that he lying in chamber hard by,
whither he bad retired from the Debauch, to <U+017F>leep
a little, was awaked by their noi<U+017F>e, and went out
to end the quarrel; That he had by main force
brought one of the Ladies into hit Chamber, to
keep her from her Enemy; But that the other had
pur<U+017F>ued her <U+017F>o furiou<U+017F>ly, and they both continued
<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinate in their fighting humour, that they had

treated one another ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>o as they <U+017F>aw, and had put

               <p>While <hi>Lycidas</hi> was carrying on his relation,
the Rival-Ladies came to themselves a little, and
began to fear, lea<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ubject of their quarrel
<U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>covered; but <U+017F>eeing, Sir, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniou<U+017F>ly
their common Lover had excu<U+017F>ed
them, and brought all off again, they avow'd
all he <U+017F>aid, and made a fit u<U+017F>e of his probable
excu<U+017F>es. She ju<U+017F>tled me, cryed one, and <U+017F>he ju<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

But the Ma<U+017F>ter of the Hou<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ome
other friends that Tere there, ea<U+017F>ily quieted this
<U+017F>econd emotion, and remedied the relap<U+017F>e. I hey

thou<U+017F>and times over, made him all the excu<U+017F>es

Beauties to make <hi>Lycidas</hi> <U+017F>atisfaction for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
he had received, and without more ado
reeled to their debauch again. The two Rival-Ladies
embraced one another, at the reque<U+017F>t of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100546:53"/>
the company of the Women, and were overjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <U+017F>o dangerous a conjuncture, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation
of their Honour, they laughed as hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

their quarrel, and told it ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>o as <hi>Lycidas</hi> had
done before them.</p>
               <p>The Husbands being got pretty well drunk
by this time, and the Ladies having, laughed
their laugh out, all the company went to bed,

for though I told you they went to bed
before, you mu<U+017F>t know that they poor <U+017F>ouls ro<U+017F>e

Company once again brought them together,
where we <U+017F>hall leave them, for I think we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
leave them better: On the morrow the
company parted, having fir<U+017F>t agreed, and judged
it requi<U+017F>ite, that the two reconciled Ladies, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi<U+017F>a</hi>
and <hi>Zelotide</hi> <U+017F>hould go to Town in the <U+017F>ame

had not heartily pardoned them for all the
<U+017F>cratches, together with the bites and brui<U+017F>es he
had received, would by all means per<U+017F>wade him
to go along with them, without any other <U+017F>oul
with him, but his two Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es; and the<U+017F>e good

him too, and do all they could to procure his

               <p>Our Galllant and the two Rival-Ladies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now together in the <U+017F>ame Coach, your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highne<U+017F>s may ea<U+017F>ily conjecture, after <U+017F>o plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant
an adventure; that their conver<U+017F>ation was
not unplea<U+017F>ant, and that a great many fine things
were <U+017F>poken among<U+017F>t them. <hi>Lycidas</hi> began to
make them <U+017F>ee their imprudence, and told them,
if his addre<U+017F>s had not helpt them out at a dead
lift, their extravagance might have had very
bad con<U+017F>equences; both the Ladies were of his
opinion, and rendered him their hearty thanks
for <U+017F>o high an obligation. And now they were
in <U+017F>uch a condition, that they could no longer
conceal their affairs from one another, <U+017F>o that
by the mediation of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> they were made
very good friends again, and there pa<U+017F>t between
them the fine<U+017F>t Raillery, but yet the mo<U+017F>t civil
and innocent, about their Loves, that ever was
heard. <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> told <hi>Zelotide</hi> of her jealou<U+017F>ie,
and <hi>Zelotide</hi> rally'd on <hi>Cephi<U+017F>a</hi> for being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with her leavings, and all this had <U+017F>o little
har<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s in it, and was <U+017F>o extreamly and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
that two Rivals were never yet more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <lg>
                  <l>What marvels did ingenious Love then do?</l>
                  <l>Love like the States could then admit of more,</l>

                  <l>This was a wonder never <U+017F>een before.</l>

               </lg>
               <p>Before they came to Town, they very <U+017F>olemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
covenanted, the better to <U+017F>ilence the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
Lampooners of the Town, and to cheat
their Husbands the more dexterou<U+017F>ly, to part
<hi>Lycidas</hi> betwixt them, as a good that was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
common to both of them. They moreover
fully re<U+017F>olved and agreed to do all they po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
could, to hinder any third Lady from rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
them of <U+017F>o agreeable a Trea<U+017F>ure. And that
if through any Caprichio of his<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> he <U+017F>hould fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the one more then the other, the agriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lady <U+017F>hould not make any publick di<U+017F>turb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
about it, and that all the Arms <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould
make u<U+017F>e of to retrieve the fugitive, <U+017F>hould be
care<U+017F><U+017F>es and obligations, The<U+017F>e condition thus
formerly agreed on, were <U+017F>o advantagious for
<hi>Lycidas,</hi> that he could not with rea<U+017F>on refu<U+017F>e
them, as really he did not. But a<U+017F><U+017F>ured his two
Ladies, that he was very well <U+017F>atisfied with
them, and <U+017F>wore he would never on his part
violate the Articles.</p>
               <p>For <U+017F>ome weeks the two Rivals, with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
third per<U+017F>on, the beloved <hi>Lycidas</hi> lived in
very good intelligence, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
agreed upon in the la<U+017F>t Treaty. The
Ladies were infinitely happy, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100546:55"/>
<U+017F>o too, but <hi>Lycidas</hi> began to <U+017F>urfet on their
goodne<U+017F>s, and was pre<U+017F>ently cloy'd With <U+017F>o much
<U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s. This good intelligence of theirs
plagued him mo<U+017F>t unmercifully, and at la<U+017F>t he
found by <U+017F>ad experience, that he might with
le<U+017F>s difficulty content his two Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their divi<U+017F>ion, then now he had made them
friends, The<U+017F>e two hand<U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons loved one
another with as great a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as they hated
each other formerly, they were never out of
one anothers company, and that former precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s, that he had before <U+017F>o <U+017F>crupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ly
ob<U+017F>erved, and that the ob<U+017F>ervance of <U+017F>o

               <lg>
                  <l>Thus when the one <U+017F>py'd with what gallantry,</l>
                  <l>He did his Love unto her friend addre<U+017F>s,</l>

                  <l>She never blam'd her Rivals ki<U+017F><U+017F>es</l>

upon the frontiers of <hi>picardy.</hi> How a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable

now even tired and more then <U+017F>atiated with
their amorous Delicates, your Royal Highne<U+017F>s
may ea<U+017F>ily conjecture; but the poor Ladies

the Thunders in nature could not have <U+017F>o much

multinude of Tears, and <hi>Lycidas</hi> <U+017F>hed <U+017F>ome
