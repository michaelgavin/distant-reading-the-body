         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IN relation to this Treati<U+017F>e I think my <U+017F>elf
obliged to account for two things; Fir<U+017F>t,
<hi>why</hi> I publi<U+017F>h any thing of this nature; <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
why <hi>in Engli<U+017F>h.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>fir<U+017F>t;</hi> I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s it was not
any Ambition to become an Author that put
me upon it; but another occa<U+017F>ion. The Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eller
for whom this is printed, (my particular
Friend) thinking to make a new Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
a Book intituled <hi>The Manual of the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
or Di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of the Body of Man,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Dr. <hi>Alexander Read,</hi> a Fellow of the
College of Phy<U+017F>icians, <hi>London,</hi> de<U+017F>ired me
to peru<U+017F>e it, and if in any place I ob<U+017F>erved it
erroneous, to alter it. <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nder<U+017F>tanding that
the Book had been writ many years agoe,
(that which was brought to me being the fifth
Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and that printed in 55.) I was
unwilling to meddle with it, <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting that
<pb facs="tcp:49419:3"/>
there mu<U+017F>t needs be very con<U+017F>iderable Errors in
it, <U+017F>o many new things in Anatomy having been
di<U+017F>covered <U+017F>ince that time. However at his
importunity I undertook it: and before I had
lookt over a Sheet, I <U+017F>aw I was not deceived.
For though I had re<U+017F>olved to give my <U+017F>elf no
further trouble than was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, yet I found
that if I would mend all that was ami<U+017F>s, I
mu<U+017F>t in effect write a new Book. Which I
have really done, as any one will find that will
take the pains to compare this with that writ
by Dr. <hi>Read,</hi> for he will <U+017F>ee very little of that
retained except the method, which indeed is
but little alter'd; for though it differ pretty
much from the modern, yet I think 'tis every
whit as convenient.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi><U+017F>econd,</hi> Why I <U+017F>hould write it <hi>in
Engli<U+017F>h;</hi> I have two things to alledge: Fir<U+017F>t,
The example of him that has gone before me,
who was a per<U+017F>on (as I am informed) eminent
in his time. Secondly, to avoid the injury of
a paltry Tran<U+017F>lator, if it <U+017F>hould be well accepted.
For we <U+017F>ee there is no Man that publi<U+017F>hes any
thing in the Latin tongue, that is received with
any applau<U+017F>e, but pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ome progging Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eller
or other finds out an indigent Hackney
<U+017F>cribler to render it into Engli<U+017F>h. But with
what di<U+017F>-reputation and abu<U+017F>e to the worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
every learned per<U+017F>on cannot but ob<U+017F>erve.
So that he that <U+017F>hall think to redeem the noble
<pb facs="tcp:49419:3"/>
faculty and art of Phy<U+017F>ick out of the hands of
the Mechanical Quacking Tribe by publi<U+017F>hing
every thing in a language above their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding,
will not only fail of his end, but find
him<U+017F>elf abu<U+017F>ed and di<U+017F>graced into the bargain.</p>
            <p>And now as to the Work it <U+017F>elf, the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
of it is to plea<U+017F>ure tho<U+017F>e that are entring
upon the <U+017F>tudy of Phy<U+017F>ick; for herein they may
<U+017F>ee in <U+017F>hort, what afterwards they <U+017F>hall find more
largely treated of in other Authors. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it may not be altogether unu<U+017F>efull even for
<U+017F>uch as have made <U+017F>ome proficiency in that <U+017F>tudy;
for it will <U+017F>erve at lea<U+017F>t as an Index to bring to
their remembrance what they have read more
fully el<U+017F>ewhere; and will <U+017F>ave them the labour
to make <U+017F>uch a <hi>Compendium</hi> for their own u<U+017F>e.
There is little that is new in Anatomy, but the
Reader will find a ta<U+017F>te of it here. Which he will
the rather expect to meet with, when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tands

as the peeling of an Onion. It is without bloud

                  <p>The material cau<U+017F>e of it is a vi<U+017F>cous and oleous

extremities of the Nerves which end in the
outer <U+017F>uperficies of the true Skin, where it is coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated,
and by its vi<U+017F>co<U+017F>ity <U+017F>ticketh upon it like
glue, <U+017F>o that it can hardly be <U+017F>eparated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49419:8"/>
by a knife, but ea<U+017F>ily in living creatures by

peels off in burning fevers, and the <U+017F>mall pox;
but a new one pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>ucceeds it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>u<U+017F>e</hi> of it is Fir<U+017F>t,<note place="margin">Its u<U+017F>es.</note> to defend the Skin, which
is of an exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, from external immoderate
either heat or cold. In cold weather it breaketh
the cold, that the per<U+017F>piration <U+017F>hould not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
hindred: In hot weather by its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactne<U+017F>s
it hindreth too great per<U+017F>piration.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to be a middle between the Skin<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
and the object to be felt; for when it is rubb'd
off, the true Skin cannot endure the touch of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bodies without pain.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to <U+017F>tay the ichorous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance from
i<U+017F><U+017F>uing from the Arteries; for this we <U+017F>ee when
the <hi>cuticula</hi> is rubbed off by any means.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to make the Body more beautifull;
which it does by <U+017F>moothing the a<U+017F>perities of the
true Skin, and inducing a comely colour of white
and red. Whitene<U+017F>s is natural to this part, and
the redne<U+017F>s is owing to the bloud that is affus'd to
the outward <U+017F>uperficies of the true Skin; which
being <U+017F>een through the Skarf-skin makes that flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
colour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>true skin</hi> is <U+017F>ix times thicker than the Skarf-skin:<note place="margin">2. The true skin.</note>
in Children, Women, and tho<U+017F>e which
are born in hot Countries, it is thinner; but in
Men, and in tho<U+017F>e who inhabit cold Countries,
it is thicker.</p>
                  <p>It is naturally white,<note place="margin">Its colour.</note> as other membranes;
but in living and healthfull per<U+017F>ons, and <U+017F>uch as
live in a temperate or <U+017F>omewhat cold climate,
from the afflux of the bloud towards it, it is of a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49419:9"/>
reddi<U+017F>h ro<U+017F>ie colour. But in tho<U+017F>e that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Aequinoctial Line and in exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively hot
climates it appears black in the outer <U+017F>uperficies,
becau<U+017F>e they having a <U+017F>ofter Skin, and large pores
and loo<U+017F>e, many vapours of the adu<U+017F>t humours
are rai<U+017F>ed with the <U+017F>weat; the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance
whereof, (being <U+017F>topt by the Scarf-skin, and)
by rea<U+017F>on of the exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive heat, being dried and
burned, cau<U+017F>eth that blackne<U+017F>s; for their infants
are not born black but reddi<U+017F>h.</p>
                  <p>It is made up of nervous fibres very clo<U+017F>ely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
one with another, and of a parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
that fills up the inter<U+017F>tices and inequalities
thereof. That it has <U+017F>uch a parenchyma may
appear by this, that when a Sheep-skin (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance)
has been <U+017F>ome while <U+017F>teept in water, one
may with an ivory knife or the like <U+017F>crape a great
deal of mucous <U+017F>limy matter off it, whereby it
becomes much lighter, thinner and in <U+017F>ome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure
tran<U+017F>parent, as we <U+017F>ee in Parchment.</p>
                  <p>The Skin in the Fore-head and Sides is thin,
thinner yet in the palm of the Hand, but thinne<U+017F>t
of all in the Lips and Cods. In the Head, Back,
and under the Heel it is thicke<U+017F>t. Under the
Heel the <hi>cuticula</hi> in <U+017F>ome will be as thick as a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
corn, and may more truly be called a <hi>callus</hi>
than a <hi>cuticula;</hi> and <U+017F>uch it is in the palms of the
Hands of <U+017F>uch as much handle hard things, as
Smiths, and the like. It is thinner in Children
and in Women than in Men; in tho<U+017F>e that live in
hot Countries, than tho<U+017F>e that live in cold. And
this (as <hi>Spigelius</hi> ob<U+017F>erves) is the rea<U+017F>on why
tho<U+017F>e that are born in cold Countries, when they
come under the Aequinoctial Line, are often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with fevers; becau<U+017F>e that great heat that is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49419:9"/>
there excited in the Body by the outward air, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
exhale through the too thick Skin, but being
retained induces a preternatural heat, and <U+017F>o a
fever.</p>
                  <p>The pores will appear in the Skin in the winter
time, it being bared; for where they are, the
<hi>cuticula</hi> will appear as a Goo<U+017F>es Skin.</p>
                  <p>The Skin hath an action,<note place="margin">Its action.</note> to wit, the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of
feeling.</p>
                  <p>Its u<U+017F>e is,<note place="margin">Its u<U+017F>es.</note> fir<U+017F>t, to cloath the whole Body, and
defend it from injuries. Secondly, to be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
vent or emunctory to the Body, by which all
its exhalations may fitly tran<U+017F>pire. Which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be done onely through its pores, as mo<U+017F>t
Anatomi<U+017F>ts have affirmed; or al<U+017F>o through its
very <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, as Dr. <hi>Gli<U+017F><U+017F>on</hi> has of late a<U+017F><U+017F>erted,
is a controver<U+017F>ie hardly worth the in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting on.</p>
                  <p>In the next place appears the <hi>fat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. Fat.</note> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
taken to be <U+017F>omething di<U+017F>tinct from the
<hi>membrana carno<U+017F>a</hi> that lies under it; but is indeed
onely a part of it: for in its outer part it is full
of membranous cells, which are fill'd with a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowi<U+017F>h
fat. But however having noted this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak after the manner of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Anatomi<U+017F>ts, and con<U+017F>ider it as <U+017F>eparate,
and <U+017F>o define it to be <hi>an oleous humour of the Body
elevated by the moderate heat of the parts lying under
it, and concreted betwixt the carnous membrane and
the Skin in membranous cells.</hi> Now though in Men
this fat is immediately next to the Skin, yet in
Bea<U+017F>ts the <hi>membrana carno<U+017F>a</hi> comes between, and
is indeed mu<U+017F>culous, and <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e joyned to the
Skin that by the help of it they can (many of them)
move the Skin <U+017F>o as to <U+017F>hake off flies or any thing
that offends them: but it is not <U+017F>o in Men in any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49419:10"/>
place <U+017F>ave the Fore-head, which therefore they
can move in like manner.</p>
                  <p>This Fat is properly called <hi>pinguedo,</hi> whereas
that of the Caul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is called <hi><U+017F>evum,</hi> Suet or
Tallow. And they differ in this, that <hi>pinguedo</hi> is
ea<U+017F>ily melted, but not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily congealed; but
<hi><U+017F>evum</hi> is not ea<U+017F>ily melted, but is ea<U+017F>ily congealed.
Be<U+017F>ides, <hi>pinguedo</hi> is not brittle, but <hi><U+017F>evum</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>The u<U+017F>es of it are the<U+017F>e:<note place="margin">Its u<U+017F>es.</note> Fir<U+017F>t, it defendeth the
Body from the air; <U+017F>o Apothecaries, when they
mean to pre<U+017F>erve juices, pour oyl upon them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it pre<U+017F>erveth the natural heat.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it furthereth beauty by filling up the
wrinkles of the Skin.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the Mu<U+017F>cles it filleth up the empty
places, rendreth the motion thereof more glib
and ea<U+017F>ie, (<U+017F>o it do not abound too much) and
keepeth all the parts from drine<U+017F>s, or breaking.
Hence it be<U+017F>mears the extremities of the Cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the joyntings of the greater Bones, and the
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that they may pa<U+017F>s <U+017F>afely.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in a <U+017F>pecial manner it helpeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of the Stomach; whence the Caul being
taken out, there follow <hi>flatus</hi> and belchings; and
in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>e it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to fence the Stomach

is tied above to the Midriff, below

firmly to the tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e Mu<U+017F>cles, but chiefly to
their Tendons about the <hi>Linea alba;</hi> behind to
the fle<U+017F>hly heads of the<U+017F>e Mu<U+017F>cles loo<U+017F>ely. The end

for the expul<U+017F>ion of the Ordure, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>piration.
If this connexion had not been, the
<hi>Peritonaeum</hi> would have become wrinkled, the
Mu<U+017F>cles being contracted. If it had not been
loo<U+017F>e tied to the fle<U+017F>hly parts, the contraction of
them in the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Belly had been
hindred.</p>
                  <p>Its figure is oval; its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is membranous;
the inner <U+017F>uperficies of it, which re<U+017F>pects the
Guts, is <U+017F>mooth, equal and <U+017F>lippery, bedewed
with a kind of watery humour contained in the
<hi>Abdomen:</hi> but the outer <U+017F>uperficies, whereby it
cleaves to the Mu<U+017F>cles of the lower Belly, is
rough and unequal.</p>
                  <p>As for the origine of it, <hi>Fallopius</hi> will have it
to proceed from that <U+017F>trong <hi>plexus</hi> of Nerves,

<U+017F>pring out of the <hi><U+017F>pinalis medulla,</hi> about the fir<U+017F>t

opinion <U+017F>eems the mo<U+017F>t probable; for there it
cannot be <U+017F>eparated without tearing, and is very
thick.</p>
                  <p>It is double every where, but appears <U+017F>o to be

chiefly about the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Loins, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the duplications lie the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> the <hi>Aorta</hi>
and the Kidneys. In the <hi>Hypoga<U+017F>trium</hi> two Tunicles
are al<U+017F>o apparently <U+017F>een, between which the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

placed in the duplicature of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> that
they may march the more <U+017F>afely. <hi>Above,</hi> where it
is tied to the Midriff, it has three <hi>faramina</hi> or holes;

by; the third, by which the great Artery or
<hi>Aorta,</hi> and the Nerve of the <U+017F>ixth pair may pa<U+017F>s.
<hi>Below,</hi> it has pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages for the <U+017F>trait Gut, for the

                  </p>
                  <p>But the mo<U+017F>t remarkable are its two <hi>proce<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi>
placed before near the <hi>os pubis,</hi> on each <U+017F>ide one.
They are certain oblong productions of its outer
Membrane pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the holes of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
of the oblique and tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e Mu<U+017F>cles, and
depending into the Cod, there be<U+017F>towing one
Tunicle on the Stones. There are al<U+017F>o two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>es
in Women, but they reach onely to the <hi>ingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
or Groins, and terminate in the upper part of
the Privity or the fat of <hi>mons Veneris.</hi> The inner
Membrane of the <hi>peritonaeum</hi> (in Men) reaches
but to the very holes, which it makes very <U+017F>trait;
but being either relaxed or broken, the outer
gives way, and <U+017F>o there follows a rupture, either
the Caul, or the Guts, or both de<U+017F>cending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
By the holes of the proce<U+017F><U+017F>es there de<U+017F>cend

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>peritonaeum</hi> is thicke<U+017F>t below the Navel, for

the Ancients thought to be, both to carry
venal bloud to them for their nouri<U+017F>hment, and
al<U+017F>o to receive the chyle out of them and carry it
to the Liver there to be turn'd into bloud. As to
the fir<U+017F>t u<U+017F>e, 'tis certain (by the circulation of
the bloud) that the<U+017F>e Veins carry nothing to the
Guts; but the bloud in them, is all received
from the Arteries there, to be carried back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Liver and <U+017F>o to the Heart: but as to
the latter, there are <U+017F>ome learned Anatomi<U+017F>ts

this opinion is exploded by others as learned and

them, whom I believe to be in the right. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides

It ari<U+017F>eth at the <hi>os ileum</hi> on the right <U+017F>ide,
and a<U+017F>cending by its Spine it arrives at the right
Kidney; to which parts it is annex'd by a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
connexion. From thence bending left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
it creeps under the Liver by the Gali-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(which tinges it there a little yellowi<U+017F>h) to
the bottom of the Stomach; to the whole length
whereof it is tied, only the Caul coming between,
(as al<U+017F>o to the <hi>pancreas</hi> and Loins.) Then it
comes to the lower part of the Spleen, and is knit
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49419:25"/>
to it. Then touching the left Kidney, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
firmly to it by Fibres, it comes to the left
<hi>os ileum;</hi> from which de<U+017F>cending by the left
Groin to the <hi>pelvis</hi> it embraceth the bottom of
the Bladder behind on each <U+017F>ide. Afterwards it
a<U+017F>cends upwards by the right Groin near the place
from whence it fir<U+017F>t took its ri<U+017F>e; and thence
marching back again towards the left <U+017F>ide, and
running it <U+017F>elf in betwixt the <hi>ileum</hi> and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
it reaches to the top of <hi>os <U+017F>acrum,</hi> and there

reckon it <U+017F>horter. It goeth almo<U+017F>t quite about
the <hi>abdomen</hi> next to the Mu<U+017F>cles, that it may be
the better compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by them for avoidance of

rea<U+017F>on why it <U+017F>hould pa<U+017F>s under the Stomach,
<hi>viz.</hi> That as Chymi<U+017F>ts judge no dige<U+017F>tion more
natural than that which is performed by the heat
of dung, <U+017F>o the heat of the excrements in the
<hi>colon</hi> does help the coction of the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>It hath cells which <U+017F>pring from the internal
Tunicle of it: The<U+017F>e cells are kept in their figure
by a Ligament half an inch broad, which pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth
through the upper and middle part of it all along;
this being broken or di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, the cells <U+017F>tretch
out and appear no more. Their <hi>u<U+017F>e</hi> is to hinder
the flowing of the excrements into one place,
which would compre<U+017F>s the parts adjacent; as al<U+017F>o
for the <U+017F>lower pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the <hi>faeces,</hi> that we may
not have a continual and ha<U+017F>ty need of going to
<U+017F>tool. On its out<U+017F>ide from its pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by the
Spleen to its joyning to the <hi>rectum</hi> it has a great
many fatty knots, which <U+017F>erve to moi<U+017F>ten and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricate

what this <hi>lympha</hi> which they carry, is. <hi>Bartholin</hi>

impregnated with much fus'd and volatile <U+017F>alt,
and al<U+017F>o with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ulphureous particles; which
when it is conveyed to the <hi>va<U+017F>a chylifera,</hi> makes
the chyle thinner, and apt to dilate ea<U+017F>ily in the
Heart; and when to the <hi>Veins,</hi> prepares the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
bloud (now too thick) for a quick dilatation
in the Heart.] This <hi>lympha,</hi> whatever it be,
(or be for) differs from the <hi><U+017F>erum;</hi> for if one
gather a little of it in a <U+017F>poon, and let it <U+017F>tand,
without <U+017F>etting it on the fire, it will turn to a
gelly, which the <hi><U+017F>erum</hi> will not doe. And thus

there be a commerce betwixt the<U+017F>e Glands and

that both their twigs are <U+017F>traitly tied together

one pretty notable Trunk which is in<U+017F>erted into
the <hi>Cy<U+017F>tis</hi> near its Neck, with a Valve before its
Mouth to hinder the regurgitation of the Choler.
(For in the Jaundice the Choler does not return
out of the Gall-bladder into the Bloud again, but
either for want of a convenient ferment it is not
<U+017F>eparated from the Bloud, or when the neck of

though it be evident that the Choler is brought
into the <hi>Ve<U+017F>ica</hi> by this Pipe, yet if one open the

<U+017F>hall hardly find where it is; which is no wonder,

<U+017F>eeing it is <U+017F>o difficult to find the in<U+017F>ertions of
the Ureters into the urinary Bladder, which are
va<U+017F>tly larger than this. But Dr. <hi>Gli<U+017F><U+017F>on</hi> <U+017F>ays,
that near its neck in the in<U+017F>ide, there is a little
<U+017F>pongy protuberance, into which this Trunk is

is the <U+017F>ame that we called before a Valve.</p>
                  <p>It has been taught by <U+017F>everal Anatomi<U+017F>ts,<note place="margin">Its valves.</note> that
its Neck or <hi>Meatus</hi> has <U+017F>ometimes two, <U+017F>ometimes

<U+017F>light compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of his fingers found, that the
Choler will fluctuate to and again, out of the
<hi>Cy<U+017F>tis</hi> into the <hi>Meatus,</hi> and on the contrary, as
al<U+017F>o out of the <hi>Meatus</hi> into the <hi>Ductus communis</hi>
and back again; <U+017F>o that he cannot believe there is
any thing of a Valve in the whole pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. But
one thing which he thinks has impos'd upon Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomi<U+017F>ts,
is a certain fibrous Ring (or <hi>Sphincten</hi>
as it were) which is <U+017F>eated ju<U+017F>t at the end of the
Bladder and beginning of its Neck, which makes
the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age betwixt them exceeding <U+017F>trait; but
this cannot be a Valve, becau<U+017F>e as he ob<U+017F>erves the

Without the Liver it is as wide again as the
<hi>Meatus cy<U+017F>ticus,</hi> with which it is joyned at two
inches di<U+017F>tance from the Liver, and both make
the <hi>Ductus communis choledochus.</hi> It has no Valve
in its whole progre<U+017F>s; only the <hi>Ductus communis,</hi>
where it enters the Inte<U+017F>tin, having pierced the
outer coat, pa<U+017F><U+017F>es betwixt that and the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t
about the twelfth part of an inch, and then
piercing that al<U+017F>o marches down further betwixt
it and the innermo<U+017F>t coat about half an inch, and
at la<U+017F>t opens with a round mouth into the Inte<U+017F>tin.
So that this oblique in<U+017F>ertion (as that of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reter

a Valve to hinder any thing from regurgita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

mixed with it, and that this liquor flowing into
the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> and there pre<U+017F>ently mixed with
the Bile, and the meat concocted in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach

Bloud, erred gro<U+017F>ly as to the u<U+017F>e of this part.
They thought that it attracted a more feculent
and melancholick part of the Chyle, by the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<U+017F>plenicus,</hi> which having a little elaborated,
it <U+017F>ent it out again partly by the <hi>vas breve,</hi> and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49419:49"/>
partly by the internal hemorrhoidal; but it is
certain, both that no Chyle, nor indeed Bloud
pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth by the <hi>Ramus <U+017F>plenicus</hi> to the Spleen, as
neither any thing from the Spleen by the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; but whatever they contain comes
towards the Spleen, namely into the <hi>Ramus,</hi> and
what is in it goes to the Liver. One need add
no further rea<U+017F>on to evince the errour of their
opinion; nor that of tho<U+017F>e that would make it a
<U+017F>anguifying Bowel. Dr. <hi>Gli<U+017F><U+017F>on</hi> (in <hi>lib. de He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,
cap. 45. p. 434.)</hi> thinks it to make an ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
juice or at lea<U+017F>t a vehicle for it, which
being fir<U+017F>t imbib'd by its nervous Fibres is from
them received into the Nerves, by which it is fir<U+017F>t
carried to the <hi>Glandulae renales;</hi> where being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
it is received again by the Nerves, and is
carried to the Brain and Spinal marrow, and
from thence by the Nerves again into all the parts
of the Body. We will not here enter into a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
about the nutritious juice of the Nerves;
but <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing it, certainly this <U+017F>eems an odd way
of conveying either it or its Vehicle thus to and
again by the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ort of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; not to <U+017F>ay that
<U+017F>o acid a juice as is excocted in the Spleen, one
<U+017F>hould think would be no very welcome gue<U+017F>t to
the Nerves, nor be <U+017F>uffer'd to march <U+017F>o quietly,
e<U+017F>pecially pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing again<U+017F>t the current of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<U+017F>pirits that continually flow from the Brain
and Spinal marrow. This opinion therefore we
<U+017F>hall pa<U+017F>s by as very improbable, having little el<U+017F>e
to recommend it <U+017F>ave the credit of its learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
And its true u<U+017F>e we believe to be, to make
a <U+017F>ubacid and <U+017F>alti<U+017F>h juice of the Arterial bloud
that flows plentifully into it, which pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing by the
<hi>Ramus <U+017F>plenicus</hi> to the Liver <U+017F>erves there to make
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49419:50"/>
(and further the <U+017F>eparation of) the Bile. Now
this juice is thus elaborated: There are a great
many Glands in the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Spleen
(which being boil'd ta<U+017F>ts <U+017F>omething acid.) Into
the<U+017F>e Glands is the Arterial bloud poured by the
capillary Arteries, wherewith are mixed <U+017F>ome
animal <U+017F>pirits depo<U+017F>ited into the <U+017F>ame Glandules
by the ends of the Nerves, which bridling the
<U+017F>ulphureous <U+017F>pirit of the Bloud, induce on it a
little acidity; and then being driven out of the
Glandules by the beating of the Arteries and the
pre<U+017F><U+017F>ure of the adjacent parts, it is received by
the roots of the Splenick vein, and <U+017F>o by the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<U+017F>plenicus</hi> it flows to the <hi>Porta</hi> and the Liver.
But before it enter into the roots of the Veins,
it <U+017F>eems to <U+017F>tay a little in the abovementioned
Cells, (who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is acid) that it may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<U+017F>ome more acidity by that <U+017F>tay in them: as
Wine <U+017F>tanding in a Vinegar-ve<U+017F><U+017F>el <U+017F>owrs more
and more; and as the Bile by <U+017F>taying in the Gall-bladder
gets a greater acrimony.</p>

which goes al<U+017F>o to the Stomach; whence that

it is pretty hard, but within, it is indifferent

but towards the <hi>Pelvis</hi> it is more pale. Thus the
Kidneys appear to the <U+017F>ight; but <hi>Malpighius</hi> with
his Micro<U+017F>cope hath made a far more accurate di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery

<U+017F>eems commonly plain, yet it is unequal
in Infants new born; and that in adult per<U+017F>ons
the conjunction of Globules does <U+017F>till appear
within from the diver<U+017F>ity of colour, which in
the <U+017F>everal Globules outwardly and towards the
<U+017F>ides, to which they are joined, is red, but
more pale on the inner <U+017F>ide. And as in Brutes
the<U+017F>e Globules being round outwards, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
inwards into an obtu<U+017F>e narrowne<U+017F>s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

—If one take off the Membrane from a

fre<U+017F>h and as yet <U+017F>oft Kidney, there may by a
good Micro<U+017F>cope be di<U+017F>covered certain round
and <U+017F>hort Bodies roll'd about like little worms,
not unlike tho<U+017F>e that are found in the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance
of the Kidneys being cut through the middle;
and under the outmo<U+017F>t <U+017F>uperficies one may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
wonderfull branches of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, with their
Globules hanging at them, which run towards
the <hi>Pelvis;</hi> as al<U+017F>o certain continued winding
<U+017F>paces and <U+017F>inus's running through all the outer
<U+017F>uperficies of the Kidneys, that become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>picuous
by injecting ink through the emulgent
Arteries: and moreover, innumerable <U+017F>mall
pipes which look <U+017F>omething like fibrous or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymatous
fle<U+017F>h, but are indeed membranous
and hollow; the<U+017F>e make up a great part of the
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Kidneys, and are the excretory
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Urine. Moreover he <U+017F>ays, that
if (after the Membrane is removed) one make
injection into the emulgent Artery with the
<U+017F>pirit of Wine tinged black, he may di<U+017F>cern in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
very <U+017F>mall Glandules hanging upon
forked Arteries, which by the injection are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o
coloured black; as al<U+017F>o many others in the
inter<U+017F>tices of the Urinary ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which hang
like Apples upon the Arteries, (now fill'd
with the black liquor, and branched like a
Tree.) He thinks that from the<U+017F>e Glands into
which the extremities of the Arteries end, the
roots of the Veins ari<U+017F>e, and that the Nerves
reach to them too; and that it is probable that
the excretory Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Ureter are extended
<U+017F>o far al<U+017F>o, <U+017F>eeing this is con<U+017F>tant in all Glands,
that every little Globule has be<U+017F>ides the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

<hi>Parenchyma.</hi> But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Emulgent artery,</hi>

but in the Kidney it is <U+017F>pread in divers branches
through its whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, and ends in it in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<U+017F>mall and invi<U+017F>ible Capillaries. By it much
bloud is conveyed to the Reins (for it is a great
Artery) partly to nouri<U+017F>h them and the Urinary
ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, partly that in their Glandules a good
part of the <hi>Serum</hi> may be <U+017F>eparated from it, which
being carried by the Urinary fibres to the <hi>Papillae</hi>
ouzes through them into the <hi>Pelvis.</hi>
                  </p>

the Kidney, which being united into one Trunk

remaining from the nouri<U+017F>hment of the Kidney,
now freed from a good quantity of <hi>Serum</hi> in the
Glands. For that there pa<U+017F><U+017F>es nothing by this
Vein to the Kidney is plain, as from the general
office of Veins, which always carry from the part
where their Capillaries are <U+017F>pread (excepting
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49419:54"/>
the <hi>Vena portae,</hi> which indeed has the office of an
Artery) <U+017F>o from that notable Valve that is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at its entrance into the <hi>Cava,</hi> looking towards
it from the Kidney, <U+017F>o that the Bloud may freely
pa<U+017F>s out of the Emulgent into the <hi>Cava,</hi> but not
back again. The Emulgent vein <U+017F>ometimes comes
divided out of the Kidney, as the Artery goes in;
but both the branches are pre<U+017F>ently united into
one, and always open by one orifice into the

                  <p>The action of the Reins is to <U+017F>eparate and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate

as was <U+017F>aid, is brought to them together with the
Bloud by the Emulgent arteries; which is done
in this order. After the two branches of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49419:55"/>
Emulgent artery are enter'd the Kidneys, they
are pre<U+017F>ently each of them divided into four or
five, and tho<U+017F>e again into many more, till at
la<U+017F>t they end in the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Capillaries which
terminate in the Glandules towards the outer <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies,
whereinto they infu<U+017F>e their liquor. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <U+017F>ame Glandules are in<U+017F>erted al<U+017F>o the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary
veins, and the Uinary <U+017F>iphons, each of
which imbibe thence their proper liquor. By
the Veins the Bloud returns into the larger bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Emulgent veins, from thence into the
<U+017F>ingle Trunk, and by it to the <hi>Cava,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
it to the Heart: But by the Urinary pipes
does the <hi>Serum</hi> drill to the <hi>Papillae</hi> or <hi>Carunculae</hi>
placed at the entrance into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> through
which it di<U+017F>tills into it. And this <hi>Pelvis</hi> being
the head of the Ureter, the <hi>Serum</hi> glides readily
out of it down by the Ureter into the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>But now it is very difficult to determine<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this <U+017F>eparation of the <hi>Serum</hi> in the Kidneys
be procured by any kind of efferve<U+017F>cency or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
or whether they <U+017F>erve meerly as a
<U+017F>trainer, through which it is <U+017F>queezed or tran<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
If it be <U+017F>eparated only this la<U+017F>t way, how
admirable is the configuration of the Pores, that
the <hi>Serum</hi> with all its contents <U+017F>hould pa<U+017F>s by
them without the lea<U+017F>t drop or <U+017F>tain of bloud,

have imagined that <U+017F>ome Lacteals have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erted
into the Bladder, as others have <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed

                  <p>Some have thought the Kidneys to have other

                  <p>Above each Kidney at about half an inch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
there <U+017F>tands a Gland,<note place="margin">Glandulae renales.</note> by <U+017F>ome called <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula
renalis;</hi> by others <hi>Ren <U+017F>uccenturiatus;</hi> by

names they have had given them, from the <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
u<U+017F>es the Impo<U+017F>ers have a<U+017F>cribed to them.</p>
                  <p>They are commonly but two,<note place="margin">Their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</note> and are placed
over (but towards the in<U+017F>ide of) the Kidneys,
having the fat about the Kidney coming between.
The left is nearer to the Diaphragm, <U+017F>tanding
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49419:56"/>
higher than the right, but the right is nearer to
the <hi>Vena cava.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are <U+017F>eldom of the <U+017F>hape of the Kidneys,<note place="margin">Figure and Sub<U+017F>tance.</note>
but are of not much an unlike <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. Their
figure is often three corner'd, having the <U+017F>hape of
a Satchel with its bottom upward. Sometimes
they are oval but flatti<U+017F>h.</p>
                  <p>They are bigger in Children proportionably
than in Men;<note place="margin">Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> for in the former they are near the
bigne<U+017F>s of the Kidneys; but they do not increa<U+017F>e
as other parts do, <U+017F>o that in adult per<U+017F>ons they
are not above two inches long and one broad.
Commonly the right is bigger than the left.</p>
                  <p>They are covered with a thin Membrane which
is knit very fa<U+017F>t to the outer or adipo<U+017F>e Membrane
of the Kidneys.<note place="margin">Membrane.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have a manife<U+017F>t Cavity in their larger
end,<note place="margin">Cavity.</note> in which is contained a black and feculent
humour, that tinges the <U+017F>ides of the Cavity. Into
it there are a great many little holes gaping out
of the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Gland, according to
Dr. <hi>Wharton;</hi> and it <U+017F>elf opens into a Vein, but
has a Valve placed ju<U+017F>t at the entrance, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the humour contained in the Cavity to flow
out by the Vein, but hinders its return.</p>
                  <p>They have Veins and Arteries commonly from
the Emulgents,<note place="margin">Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</note> <U+017F>ometimes from the <hi>Cava</hi> and
<hi>Aorta,</hi> and <U+017F>ometimes from the <hi>Va<U+017F>a adipo<U+017F>a.</hi>
Their Nerves come from the <U+017F>tomachick branch
of the Interco<U+017F>tals that runs to the proper Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
of the Kidneys and to the Spleen al<U+017F>o.
Lacteals they have none. <hi>Bartholin</hi> affirms they
have Lymphaticks.</p>
                  <p>There have been divers conjectures of the u<U+017F>e
of the<U+017F>e Glands,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g><U+017F>e.</note> but none generally con<U+017F>ented to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49419:56"/>
as true. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi>'s gue<U+017F>s is, that <U+017F>ome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is imbib'd from the Spleen by the Nerves
that are common to the Spleen and the<U+017F>e Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
(being both from one branch) and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ited
in their Cavity, which being not purely
excrementitious (though perhaps unprofitable
to the Nerves) is re<U+017F>tored again to the Veins.
Dr. <hi>Gli<U+017F><U+017F>on</hi> al<U+017F>o thinks they receive <U+017F>omething
from the Spleen, which being refin'd here is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib'd
again by the Nerves, by which it a<U+017F>cends to
the Brain or Spinal marrow, and de<U+017F>cends again
by them, being either it <U+017F>elf a <hi>Succus nutritius,</hi>
or el<U+017F>e a Vehicle for it. <hi>Riolanus</hi> thinks they are
of no u<U+017F>e at all in Men, but only in the <hi>Foetus</hi> in
the Womb. <hi>Ve<U+017F>lingius, Bartholin</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
think that they make a ferment or <hi>Coagulum</hi>
for the u<U+017F>e of the Kidneys to help the <U+017F>eparation
of the <hi>Serum</hi> from the Bloud. And this indeed
were a probable u<U+017F>e if there could be found out
any way whereby ought could conveniently pa<U+017F>s
from hence to the Kidneys. But the Veins that
go out of them are in<U+017F>erted either into the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
vein or the <hi>Cava,</hi> who<U+017F>e Bloud is flowing
from the Kidneys, <U+017F>o that it cannot pa<U+017F>s this way,
unle<U+017F>s one would <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e a contrary cour<U+017F>e of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in the <U+017F>ame Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, which <U+017F>eems ab<U+017F>urd.
And there are no other Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els to <U+017F>erve this turn.
<hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> conjectures that their black juice is
made of the Arterial bloud, and acquires a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
fermentative power nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the Venous
bloud, into which it is received by the <hi>Cava</hi>
from the Veins that go out of the<U+017F>e Glandules.
But this, <U+017F>ays he, is but a conjecture. And in
truth all the other opinions are no more, nor
very probable ones neither; <U+017F>o that we mu<U+017F>t
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49419:57"/>

The Arteries are two,<note place="margin">Arteries.</note> and <U+017F>pring from the

climbing over the trunk of the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> runs
obliquely to the Vein of the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ide; as al<U+017F>o the

                  <p>The Veins are al<U+017F>o two.<note place="margin">Veins.</note> The right ari<U+017F>es u<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

breaking; or rather by the continual pul<U+017F>e of the
Artery the recour<U+017F>e of the Venal bloud might
have been retarded. Now both the<U+017F>e Veins and
Arteries a little after their ri<U+017F>e meet, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>ted
both in one Membrane made of the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi>
and then run <U+017F>treight through the region

often into many branches, and by and by ino<U+017F>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
and unite again; but the Arteries go along
by one Pipe only, on each <U+017F>ide, untill within

each is divided into two branches, the le<U+017F>s where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

is great danger in him (and we <U+017F>ee it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen)
becau<U+017F>e of his going upright. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the <hi>Va<U+017F>a praeparantia.</hi> It has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
taught that there are divers ino<U+017F>culations of
the Arteries with the Veins in their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age,
whereby the Venal and Arterial bloud are
mixed; but this opinion is now exploded, for
that, granting the circulation of the Bloud, it is
impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible. For the Bloud in the Arteries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cends
towards the Te<U+017F>ticles, and that in the
Veins a<U+017F>cends from them, <U+017F>o that if the<U+017F>e two
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els <U+017F>hould open one into the other, the Bloud
in one of them mu<U+017F>t needs be driven back, or el<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>tagnating, di<U+017F>tend and break the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. But
the truth is, the Bloud both for the nouri<U+017F>hment
of the Te<U+017F>ticles and the making of Seed flows
down by the Arteries only, and that in an even
undivided cour<U+017F>e, without any of tho<U+017F>e windings
and twirlings like the Tendrels of Vines talkt <U+017F>o
much of, (as the curious <hi>de Graef</hi> by his own fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in<U+017F>pection te<U+017F>tifies:) But the Veins bring
back from the Te<U+017F>ticles what of the Bloud remains
from their nouri<U+017F>hment and making of Seed, and
the<U+017F>e indeed come out of the Te<U+017F>ticles by almo<U+017F>t
innumerable roots by which they imbibe the <U+017F>aid
Bloud, and are mo<U+017F>t admirably interwoven and
ino<U+017F>culated one with another till about four or
five fingers breadth above the Te<U+017F>ticle, which
<U+017F>pace is called <hi>Corpus pyramidale, Plexus pampini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis,</hi>
or <hi>Varico<U+017F>us;</hi> but the<U+017F>e Veins are <U+017F>o far
from preparing the Seed, as that they only bring
back what was <U+017F>uperfluous from the making of it.
And indeed the <hi>Arteries</hi> in Men do no more merit
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49419:62"/>
the name of <hi>Praeparantes</hi> in re<U+017F>pect to the Seed,
than the <hi>Gullet</hi> in re<U+017F>pect of the Chyle, or the
<hi>Ductus thoracicus chyliferus</hi> in regard to the Bloud.
But however, we continue the old names, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
only again<U+017F>t the rea<U+017F>on of them. And we
will only note two things more. Fir<U+017F>t, that
the<U+017F>e Spermatick veins have from their ri<U+017F>e to
their end <U+017F>everal Valves which open upwards,
and <U+017F>o <U+017F>uffer the Bloud to a<U+017F>cend towards the <hi>Cava,</hi>
but not to <U+017F>lide back again. Secondly, that
though the Spermatick Arteries go <U+017F>uch a direct
cour<U+017F>e in Men, as has been <U+017F>aid; yet in Brutes
they are more complicated and twi<U+017F>ted with the
Veins, but without any ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es of one into
the other.</p>

                     <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> affirms that he has oft di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
Sanguiferous ve<U+017F><U+017F>els in the inmo<U+017F>t parts of

Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> <U+017F>ays he could never ob<U+017F>erve more to go

that that too was mo<U+017F>t of it <U+017F>pent upon the Mu<U+017F>cle

Others will have branches from both the<U+017F>e Nerves

by the Nerves to other parts, <U+017F>o that any

only animal <U+017F>pirit. And whereas to <U+017F>trengthen
the former opinion 'tis u<U+017F>ually objected, That
the Seed mu<U+017F>t needs con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of a nervous juice and

for the re<U+017F>tauration of the <U+017F>ame humour (whereof
Nature is more <U+017F>olicitous than for the benefit of

Upon the Stones,<note place="margin">Epididy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midae.</note> as yet clad with the <hi>Tunica

the Te<U+017F>ticles at their ends than in the mid<U+017F>t.
<hi>De Graef</hi> defines them to be <hi>Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els making with
their various windings that Body that is fixt on the

he directs us thus. <q>Fir<U+017F>t take off the Membrane
that encompa<U+017F><U+017F>es them and knits them to the
Stones, and then there will appear many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
which with the edge of a knife may
without hurting the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els be <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from one another, that they may be drawn
out into a length like a thing folded: for they
are only folded from one <U+017F>ide to the other, and
are kept in that <U+017F>ite by the Membrane received
from the <hi>Tunica albuginea, (or Spermatick ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els.)</hi>
But when you have unravel'd half of
them you mu<U+017F>t cut another very thin Membrane,
and then you will <U+017F>ee the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els lie ju<U+017F>t like
the<U+017F>e, and may be di<U+017F><U+017F>olved like them. And
the whole being unravel'd, the thicker they
are by how much further from their origine,
which is implanted into the upper part of the
Te<U+017F>ticle by <U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even ramifications: which
having run <U+017F>o far as where they join into one

                  <p>The<U+017F>e <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae</hi> are little Cells like tho<U+017F>e in a
Pomegranate,<note place="margin">Ve<U+017F>iculae <U+017F>eminales.</note> or <U+017F>omething like a bunch of

one thin Membrane, through which <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall

They are about three fingers breadth long, and
one broad; but in <U+017F>ome places broader and <U+017F>ome
narrower, as they run in and out. They are
two, (one for each <hi>Vas deferens)</hi> divided from

in them into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rethra.</hi> They are very
anfractuous and winding, and (as was <U+017F>aid) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t
of many little Cells, that they <U+017F>hould not pour
out all the Seed contained in them, in one act of
copulation, but might retain it for <U+017F>everal. They
have no communication one with another; not
even in their very opening into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rethra;</hi> but
the Seed that is brought to the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae <U+017F>eminales</hi>
on the right <U+017F>ide by the right <hi>Vas deferens,</hi> i<U+017F><U+017F>ues
by its proper pa<U+017F><U+017F>age into the <hi>

which is brought to the left, likewi<U+017F>e. So that if by
any accident the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae</hi> on one <U+017F>ide be bur<U+017F>t or cut
(as in cutting for the Stone they mu<U+017F>t needs be) yet
tho<U+017F>e on the other being entire may <U+017F>till <U+017F>uffice
for generation. Now when the Seed is emitted
out of the<U+017F>e <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae</hi> in the act of generation, it
pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out the <U+017F>ame way it came in; which in this
ca<U+017F>e may ea<U+017F>ily be, (though it be unu<U+017F>ual there
<U+017F>hould be a contrary motion in the <U+017F>ame Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el)
for as it comes in from the <hi>Va<U+017F>a deferentia,</hi> it
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49419:69"/>
drills along gently without any force; but <hi>in Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu</hi>
when the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Yard and all the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
parts are much tumified, it is expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed or
<U+017F>quirted out of them with <U+017F>ome violence, and
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing along their neck, (which is a continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Va<U+017F>a deferentia)</hi> ouzes through a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcle
(like Quick-<U+017F>ilver through Leather) into
the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rethra,</hi> or the Duct of the Yard that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
both to the Seed and Urine. I <U+017F>ay it ouzes
from the necks of the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae</hi> through a Caruncle
into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rethra,</hi> for there is one plac'd as a
Valve before the orifice of each of them; partly
to hinder the coming of the Urine into them, partly
to hinder the involuntary effu<U+017F>ion of the Seed.</p>
                  <p>Now though naturally the little holes through
which the Seed pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out of the necks of the <hi>Ve<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae</hi>
into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rethra</hi> be almo<U+017F>t imperceptible;
yet if they be either eroded by the acrimony of
the Seed (<U+017F>uch acrimony as is contracted by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
embraces, or in Claps as we call them) or
if of them<U+017F>elves they be debilitated and <U+017F>o become
more lax (as <U+017F>ometimes happens to old or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Men that meddle too much) then there
happens a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> or continual efflux of Seed.
And <U+017F>o <hi>Ve<U+017F>alius</hi> and <hi>Spigelius</hi> have ob<U+017F>erved them

<U+017F>trong and fibrous Membrane from the Bladder,
to the beginning of who<U+017F>e neck they are joined
at the root of the Yard. In <U+017F>hape they come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>t
to an oval, <U+017F>ave that on their upper and
lower part they are a little depre<U+017F>t, and in that
end by which the <hi>Va<U+017F>a deferentia</hi> enter, they are
<U+017F>omething hollow like a Tunnel. The Sphincter
mu<U+017F>cle of the Bladder encompa<U+017F><U+017F>es them, <U+017F>o that
for <U+017F>o far as they cover the neck of the Bladder,
the Sphincter touches it not, they coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.
They have all <U+017F>orts of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which
run mo<U+017F>tly on their outer <U+017F>ide. In their inner

them<U+017F>elves have each one a <U+017F>mall one to <U+017F>top its
orifice le<U+017F>t the liquor that is contained in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tates

in the Pro<U+017F>tates of tho<U+017F>e that die (any way) <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
after having had to doe with a Female. For
in <U+017F>uch, the <U+017F>pongy part of the <hi>Pro<U+017F>tatae</hi> is very
turgid with a <U+017F>erous liquor, and in their inner
part may be found the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ame <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae,</hi> like to
<hi>Hydatides,</hi> which if you pre<U+017F>s upon, they will
di<U+017F>charge them<U+017F>elves into the above<U+017F>aid Ducts.</p>
                  <p>What the liquor they contain <U+017F>hould be,<note place="margin">Their u<U+017F>e.</note> or
what is their u<U+017F>e, there is great variety of opinions.
Some think that the Seed that flows from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ticles
is further elaborated here. But that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be; for that the <hi>Va<U+017F>a deferentia</hi> depo<U+017F>ite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them, but all into the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae <U+017F>eminales.</hi>
Others think that from the Bloud there is <U+017F>epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49419:70"/>
in them an acrimonious and <U+017F>erous humour,
which <U+017F>erves for titillation or cau<U+017F>ing the
greater plea<U+017F>ure in venery. As to this, <hi>de Graef</hi>
appeals to the ta<U+017F>t of it, which has nothing of
acrimony. Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> thinks they make a
particular kind of Seed, as the Te<U+017F>ticles do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae <U+017F>eminales</hi> a third. That
the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t make a Seed different from that made
in the Te<U+017F>ticles is grounded on a mi<U+017F>take in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Va<U+017F>a deferentia</hi> have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae,</hi> whereas they appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
open into them, and depo<U+017F>ite in them all
the Seed they contain. That the <hi>Pro<U+017F>tatae</hi> make a
peculiar <U+017F>ort, he endeavours to prove, becau<U+017F>e
gelded Animals emit <U+017F>ome Seed. But that is but
precarious; for though they emit <U+017F>omething, 'tis
not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary it <U+017F>hould be any true Seed. Or if
it be, it may well be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to proceed from
the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae <U+017F>eminales</hi> that have been full when the

denies that the <hi>Va<U+017F>a deferentia</hi> convey any thing

and therefore believes, that the humour that is
<U+017F>eparated in the <hi>Corpus glando<U+017F>um</hi> (as he calls the

that this humour <U+017F>hould be mixt with it
that it might better reach the Womb. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this humour be, it is <U+017F>queezed out partly by
the intume<U+017F>cence and erection of the <hi>Penis,</hi> and
partly by the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Sphincter of the

                  <p>The<U+017F>e Pro<U+017F>tates are often (at lea<U+017F>t partly)

and the two Nervous bodies grow into
one. Whence it is that the <hi>Penis</hi> is equally erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for if the <hi>Septum</hi> had exactly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>ht

that one part of it would have been extended,
and the other remained flaggy.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> affirms, the<U+017F>e Nervous bodies have
Glandulous fle<U+017F>h within them, which keeps the
Yard <U+017F>omething plump even when it is not erect.
But <hi>de Graef</hi> denies this, and demon<U+017F>trates that
they have no other <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance than before<U+017F>aid, thus.
Let the Yard be prepared thus: Fir<U+017F>t gently <U+017F>queez
the bloud out of it, which it always has in greater
or le<U+017F><U+017F>er plenty, and then put a little Tube into
the <U+017F>pongy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, namely in at that end that
is next to the <hi>Os pubis;</hi> and let the Cavity of the
<hi>Penis</hi> be half fill'd with water by the help of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe,
and <U+017F>hake the <hi>Penis</hi> with the water in it:
pour out that bloudy water, and fill it again with
clear, and <U+017F>o three or four times till the water is
no longer <U+017F>tain'd with bloud. Then betwixt two
Linen cloths <U+017F>queez out what water is in the
Nervous bodies, and at length blow up the <hi>Penis</hi>
<U+017F>o long till it have its natural bigne<U+017F>s; in which
po<U+017F>ture if you will keep it, you mu<U+017F>t tie it hard.
When the <hi>Penis</hi> is thus di<U+017F>tended and dried, you
may examin it as you plea<U+017F>e, and will find no
other <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance than was mentioned. <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi>
<U+017F>ays that their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is not a meer texture of
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, but is fibrous, fungous and cavernous
(<U+017F>uch as is the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Lungs) receiving

the Nervous bodies do. Its inner part is
membranous, round and hollow, and exceeding

to the other, <U+017F>ave in its fore-part, where the

Bladder and reaches to the end of the <hi>Glans,</hi>
which it <U+017F>eems to be<U+017F>tow a Membrane upon from
its own inner one, for it is plainly continued

                  <p>Its u<U+017F>e is to convey along the Seed and Urine.
And to that end there open into it <U+017F>mall pores

yea, <U+017F>ome that after they begun to emit <U+017F>uch

have not ob<U+017F>erved, that the humour is ca<U+017F>t out,

<U+017F>hould there be mixed with the Man's Seed; and
that it is not ropy and oyly like Seed, but <U+017F>erous

And indeed whatever that humour

(of which afterwards) it cannot be that

for if you pre<U+017F>s them never <U+017F>o hard, unle<U+017F>s you

We mu<U+017F>t therefore <U+017F>ub<U+017F>cribe to that new but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
opinion that <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es the<U+017F>e little Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

are truly Eggs, analogous to tho<U+017F>e of Fowl

                  <p>That the<U+017F>e <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae</hi> are analogous to the little
Eggs in the <hi>Ovarium</hi> of Fowl, <hi>de Graef</hi> evinces
by this Experiment, That if you boil them, their
liquor will have the <U+017F>ame colour, ta<U+017F>te and con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tency
with the white of Birds Eggs. And their
difference in wanting <U+017F>hells is of no moment; for
Birds Eggs had need of a <U+017F>hell, becau<U+017F>e they are
hatched without the Body, and therefore are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed
to external injuries; but the<U+017F>e of Women
being fo<U+017F>tered within their Body, have no need
of other fence than the Womb, by which they
are <U+017F>ufficiently defended.</p>
                  <p>Having compared the<U+017F>e <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae</hi> to the Eggs of
Fowls, I might here follow the method of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

but to the curious and learned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
I <U+017F>hall recommend the <U+017F>aid Authors for <U+017F>ati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and avoiding all unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary and (to

further note two things: Fir<U+017F>t, that the<U+017F>e Eggs
in Women are commonly towards the number of
twenty in each Te<U+017F>ticle or <hi>Ovarium,</hi> of which
<U+017F>ome are far le<U+017F>s than others. And <U+017F>econdly,
that the objection of the Galeni<U+017F>ts again<U+017F>t the
Ari<U+017F>totelians, <hi>(viz.</hi> that the <hi>Te<U+017F>tes</hi> of Females

obviated by this new Hypothe<U+017F>is, that
agrees to the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of the Te<U+017F>ticles <U+017F>o far as to
affirm that the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae</hi> contained in them become
(when they are impregnated by the Ma<U+017F>culine

it would more probably fall into the Cavity

from the nervo<U+017F>e-membranous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the

Betwixt the<U+017F>e Membranes there is a certain car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

with Child, together with the <U+017F>aid Membranes,
does imbibe <U+017F>o much of the nutritious humours

within <U+017F>ixteen or twenty days after a Woman is

<hi>(viz.</hi> about half a fingers breadth) and the whole

                  <p>In Virgins it is about two fingers breadth

                  <p>In Maids its Cavity is <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall that it will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

The<U+017F>e two Arteries do on each <U+017F>ide by a
notable branch ino<U+017F>culate one with the other.
And both their branches that run on one <U+017F>ide the
Womb, do ino<U+017F>culate with tho<U+017F>e of their own
<U+017F>tock on the other. Which may plainly be <U+017F>een
by blowing into the trunk of either of them on
which <U+017F>ide you will, for then the branches on the
other <U+017F>ide will be puffed up, as well as tho<U+017F>e on
that <U+017F>ide you blow.</p>
                  <p>They run along the Womb not with a <U+017F>treight
or direct cour<U+017F>e but bending and winding, that
they may be extended without danger of breaking
when the Womb is enlarged to <U+017F>o great a bulk by
the <hi>Foetus.</hi> By the<U+017F>e Arteries it is that the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Cour<U+017F>es flow, in greate<U+017F>t quantity out of tho<U+017F>e
that open into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>terus</hi> it <U+017F>elf, but in le<U+017F><U+017F>er out
of tho<U+017F>e branches that reach and open into the
<hi>Cervix</hi> or neck of the Womb, and in lea<U+017F>t (if at
all) out of the <hi>Vagina.</hi> Now whether the
Bloud be <U+017F>ent forth this way at <U+017F>uch times only
from the two great quantity of it; or whether at
<U+017F>uch <U+017F>tated <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons there is al<U+017F>o a fermentation of
the Bloud whereby the orifices of the Arteries are
unlocked, is a controver<U+017F>ie of two large con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for this place. We will only <U+017F>ay that the
latter is more probable, becau<U+017F>e when a Woman
feeds high, and <U+017F>o breeds much Bloud, they flow
never the <U+017F>ooner (though it may be in greater
quantity) and when <U+017F>he u<U+017F>es the greate<U+017F>t ab<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
and <U+017F>parene<U+017F>s of diet (if <U+017F>he be healthfull)
they will be never the longer of coming. So
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49419:85"/>
that when through <U+017F>uch efferve<U+017F>cency the Bloud
flows plentifully into the Uterine ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and the
Veins of the Womb being too few (for they are
fewer than the Arteries) to return it all back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
by the circulation, it bur<U+017F>ts forth of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities

cea<U+017F>es, which it does after three or four
days, and <U+017F>o the flux <U+017F>tops till the next period.
In Women with Child they <U+017F>eldom flow, becau<U+017F>e
then the redundant Bloud is be<U+017F>towed on the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment

the <hi>Men<U+017F>es</hi> at the u<U+017F>ual <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, that commonly

will admit the top of ones little finger, by which
the <hi>Men<U+017F>es</hi> flow. It is otherwi<U+017F>e called the Zone

                  <p>But though a Bridegroom when he finds the<U+017F>e

married a Maid; yet it will not follow on the

is al<U+017F>o wanting. For the <hi>Hymen</hi> may be corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by acrimonious fretting humours flowing
through it with the <hi>Men<U+017F>es,</hi> or from the falling

Or if a Maid be <U+017F>o indi<U+017F>creet as to become a Bride
while her Cour<U+017F>es flow or within a day after,
then both the <hi>Hymen</hi> and the inner wrinkled

that the <hi>Penis</hi> may enter glibly without any lett,

Generation both in Man and Woman; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
would, that we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>peak of the efficient
cau<U+017F>es, matter or principles from whence that
which is generated by and in them, doth proceed.
And in the fir<U+017F>t place there occurs the Man's Seed,
which is the <hi>active</hi> principle or efficient cau<U+017F>e of
the <hi>Foetus;</hi> but when we di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of the <hi>Te<U+017F>tes,</hi>
we <U+017F>hewed what the matter of it was, <hi>viz.</hi> Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
bloud and Animal <U+017F>pirits; and as to the
manner of its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ecundating the <hi>Ovum,</hi> we omit
that as being too philo<U+017F>ophical for this place.
In the next place therefore we mu<U+017F>t come to the
matter or <hi>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ive</hi> principle of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and this
is an <hi>Ovum</hi> impregnated by the Man's Seed. And
here becau<U+017F>e in Women it cannot be ob<U+017F>erved by
what degrees and in what time an <hi>Ovum</hi> in the
<hi>Ovarium</hi> or <hi>Te<U+017F>tis</hi> becomes a Conception in the
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>terus,</hi> we mu<U+017F>t be forced to gue<U+017F>s at that by the
analogy in other Creatures. To this purpo<U+017F>e
Dr. <hi>Harvey de generatione Animalium</hi> is worthy to
be read of the curious; e<U+017F>pecially concerning the
manner and order of the generation of the parts
of a Chicken in an Hens Egg, in his <hi>Exercit. 56.</hi>
But when he comes to apply this to the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of viviparous Animals, being ignorant that
there was any formal <hi>Ovum</hi> pre-exi<U+017F>ting in them,
and only then <U+017F>ecundated, he runs into great
errours and odd notions about Conception: ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49419:93"/>
an analogy betwixt the Brain's forming its
Phanta<U+017F>ms or Conceptions, (which he calls Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal)
and the Wombs forming hers, which he
calls Natural. He rightly indeed rejects the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe<U+017F>is
of the Womans having true Seed, as al<U+017F>o
the notion that the Man's Seed is any part of the
Conception: but then he gives an un<U+017F>atisfactory
account of it when he <U+017F>ays it is formed of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meval
albugineous humours that tran<U+017F>ude into
the <hi>Cornua</hi> in Brutes or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>terus</hi> in Women, after
they are impregnated or matur'd, as he <U+017F>peaks.
I <U+017F>hall not therefore rehear<U+017F>e the hi<U+017F>tory of
generation in Harts that he has given us, for an
analogical explication of that in Women; but
<U+017F>hall tran<U+017F>cribe the ob<U+017F>ervations of the curious
<hi>de Graef</hi> concerning the generation of Rabbets,

It is to be wondred at, that in <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort a <U+017F>pace

In the horns of the Womb being

that the Cells the larger they grew, came al<U+017F>o
nearer to one another, and their Inter<U+017F>tices

appear thicker and <U+017F>tronger, are yet more hard

its little Ears might be di<U+017F>covered al<U+017F>o. Its

All which in tho<U+017F>e that we di<U+017F><U+017F>ected afterwards

Membranes are originally in the <hi>Ovum</hi> while it is
in the Te<U+017F>ticle, and imbibe the moi<U+017F>ture that is

                  <p>Its <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is very like that of the Spleen,<note place="margin">Its <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance.</note>

but in Women it is circular, yet with <U+017F>ome

near the edges) and a <U+017F>pan or a quarter of a yard
over from one <U+017F>ide to the other when the <hi>Foetus</hi> is
come to maturity ready for the birth. On that

unequal, having a great many tubercles or bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings
whereby it adheres fa<U+017F>t and immediately to
the Womb. But to what part of it, is not agreed
among Anatomi<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>ome affirming it to grow to
the fore-part, <U+017F>ome to the hinder-part; <U+017F>ome to

(a<U+017F><U+017F>enting to <hi>Fallopius)</hi> <U+017F>ays, it always adheres
to one of the two corners of the Womb (that

whereinto the <hi>Foramen</hi> of the <hi>Tuba</hi> opens; <U+017F>o
that he <U+017F>ays the <U+017F>aid <hi>Foramen</hi> is as it were the

mo<U+017F>t commonly fa<U+017F>ten'd there, but not always,

to need more nouri<U+017F>hment, the extremities of the

this <hi>Placenta,</hi> that out of it, as Plants by their
Roots out of the Earth, they may draw a more
firm nutritive juice, and carry it to the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
But of this more in the <hi>33d</hi> Chapter.</p>
                  <p>It has Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els from a double origine,<note place="margin">Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</note> <U+017F>ome from

former are of four kinds, Arteries, Veins, Nerves

when we come to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e how the <hi>Foetus</hi> is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed,
as al<U+017F>o of the u<U+017F>e of the <hi>Placenta</hi> it <U+017F>elf, of
which we <U+017F>hall only ob<U+017F>erve this further here,
That after it is joined to the Womb, it <U+017F>ticks

bigger, and riper and nearer to the birth, by <U+017F>o
much the more ea<U+017F>ily will it part from the Womb,
and at length, like to ripe Fruit, after the Child
is born, it falls out of the Womb and makes part
of the After-birth.</p>
                  <p>It was an old tradition continued for many

That there are <U+017F>uch in <U+017F>ome Creatures it

doubts not but the<U+017F>e names were fir<U+017F>t given by
tho<U+017F>e that di<U+017F><U+017F>ected the<U+017F>e kind of Creatures, and
were afterwards applied in following ages to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

though it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed that this as well as

there is no appearance of it till after the Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rachus</hi> is permeable,
then pre<U+017F>ently this Membrane begins to <U+017F>hew it
<U+017F>elf, containing a very thin liquor, which is the

from its Bladder, and with which it is filled daily
more and more till the birth. It is very thin,
<U+017F>mooth, <U+017F>oft and yet den<U+017F>e. It may be known
from the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios</hi> by this, that they
have numerous Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed through them,
but this has not the lea<U+017F>t vi<U+017F>ible Vein or Artery.
It is very hard to <U+017F>eparate the <hi>Chorion</hi> from it,
becau<U+017F>e when it appears, the <hi>Chorion</hi> becomes void
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49419:103"/>
of all liquor, and <U+017F>o claps clo<U+017F>e to it. But to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the birth of the <hi>Foetus</hi> it becomes <U+017F>o turgid

                  <p>The liquor that it contains is (as has been
<U+017F>aid) the Urine of the <hi>Foetus</hi> brought hither by
the <hi>

I <U+017F>ay the <hi>Serum</hi> is <U+017F>eparated in the Kidneys and
glides down from thence into the Bladder, in
which it is found pretty plentifull when the <hi>Foetus</hi>
is five or <U+017F>ix months old. Now it flows not out
of the Bladder by its orifice, becau<U+017F>e at that time
the Sphincter is too contracted and narrow, and
if it <U+017F>hould pa<U+017F>s that way, it would mix with that

born it grow <U+017F>olid like a Ligament, like as the

but forty times as much i<U+017F><U+017F>ue therefrom, for all
the bloud of the Dam might then be drawn out
this way. Wherefore I think this experiment
makes much more again<U+017F>t his opinion than for it.
His <hi>third</hi> rea<U+017F>on is the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of it; becau<U+017F>e as
the <hi>Foetus</hi> increa<U+017F>es, it needs much aliment, and
its weak Bowels can concoct but little, it mu<U+017F>t
therefore have <U+017F>ome purera liment, and which is
already concocted (he means bloud) to nouri<U+017F>h
it, and by its commixture to help forward the
changing the aliment received by the Mouth into
bloud. <hi>An<U+017F>w.</hi> This rea<U+017F>on him<U+017F>elf invalidates
in the next Paragraph,<note n="*" place="margin">Anat. corp. hum. p. 367.</note> where he confe<U+017F><U+017F>es that
the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb is nouri<U+017F>hed in the <U+017F>ame
manner as the Chicken in an Egg, which receives
increa<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t by the <hi>inner</hi> White (as he di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>hes)

nouri<U+017F>hment in by the Mouth from the

ve<U+017F><U+017F>els enter the Yelk (to draw nouri<U+017F>hment from
thence) which, he <U+017F>ays indeed, re<U+017F>embles the
Mothers bloud, but <U+017F>eeing it has not the lea<U+017F>t
form of bloud, why would it not be more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly
<U+017F>aid that it is in<U+017F>tead of the <hi>Succus nutritius</hi>
that the <hi>Foetus</hi> in viviparous Animals receives by
the Navel-vein? And <U+017F>eeing the<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
are turned, part of them, into bloud in a
Chicken, without any of the Hens bloud to <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
them (as he <U+017F>peaks;) why <U+017F>hould not the
<U+017F>ame power be granted to the vegetative or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<U+017F>oul of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb, without any
a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from the Mothers bloud? To which I
<U+017F>hall add another Argument (out of Dr. <hi>Harvey)</hi>
taken from Cae<U+017F>arean births, when living Infants
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49419:110"/>
are cut out of the Mothers Womb, after <U+017F>he is
dead. For if it had its life and heat from the
Mothers bloud; <U+017F>urely it <U+017F>hould die a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as <U+017F>he
at lea<U+017F>t, if not <U+017F>ooner: for when death approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the <U+017F>ubordinate parts do langui<U+017F>h and grow
cold before the principal; and therefore the
Heart fails la<U+017F>t of all. Wherefore the bloud of
the <hi>Foetus</hi> would fir<U+017F>t lo<U+017F>e its heat, and become
unfit for its office if it were derived from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Womb; <U+017F>eeing her Womb is de<U+017F>titute of
all vital heat, before her Heart. But enough of
this.</p>
                  <p>But <U+017F>ome may object, If the <hi>Foetus</hi> be nouri<U+017F>hed
by none of the Mothers bloud, why <U+017F>hould her
<hi>Men<U+017F>es</hi> be <U+017F>topt all or mo<U+017F>t of the while <U+017F>he is
with Child? To which I an<U+017F>wer, that 'tis for
the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on that Nur<U+017F>es that give <U+017F>uck com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
want them al<U+017F>o; for as in Nur<U+017F>es the chyle
pa<U+017F><U+017F>es in a great proportion to the Brea<U+017F>ts,
whereby the bloud being defrauded of its due and
wonted <U+017F>hare does not encrea<U+017F>e to that degree as
to need to be le<U+017F><U+017F>ened by the flowing of the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es;</hi>
<U+017F>o in Women with Child, there is <U+017F>o great a
quantity of the <hi>Succus nutritius</hi> (which is only
chyle a little refined and impregnated with vital
<U+017F>pirit) that pa<U+017F><U+017F>es to the <hi>Placenta</hi> by the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<U+017F>trick

<U+017F>anguine, her <hi>Men<U+017F>es</hi> intermit after the fir<U+017F>t or

                  <p>I <U+017F>hall conclude therefore, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is
nouri<U+017F>hed three <U+017F>everal ways, but only by one
humour: fir<U+017F>t by appo<U+017F>ition of it whiles it is yet
an imperfect, <hi>Embryo</hi> and has not the Umbilical
ve<U+017F><U+017F>els formed; but after the<U+017F>e are perfected, it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49419:110"/>
then receives the <U+017F>ame nutritious juice by the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical
vein, the more <U+017F>pirituous and thin part
whereof it tran<U+017F>mutes into bloud, and <U+017F>ends forth
the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er part by the Umbilical artery into the
<hi>Amnios,</hi> which the <hi>Foetus</hi> <U+017F>ucks in at its Mouth,

large.</p>
                  <p>4. There are two unions of the greater Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,
that are not con<U+017F>picuous in adult per<U+017F>ons: <hi>viz.</hi>
1. The <hi>Foramen ovale,</hi> by which there is a pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
open out of the <hi>Cava</hi> into the <hi>Vena pulmonaris</hi>
ju<U+017F>t as each of them are opening the fir<U+017F>t into the
right Ventricle, and the latter into the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
of the Heart. And this <hi>Foramen</hi> ju<U+017F>t as it
opens into the <hi>Vena pulmonaris</hi> has a Valve that
hinders any thing from returning out of the <U+017F>aid
Vein into the <hi>Foramen.</hi> 2. The <hi>Canalis arterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>us,</hi>
which two fingers breadth from the <hi>ba<U+017F>is</hi> of the
Heart joins the <hi>Arteria pulmonaris</hi> to the <hi>Aorta.</hi>
It has a pretty large Cavity, and a<U+017F>cends a little
obliquely from the <U+017F>aid Artery to the <hi>Aorta,</hi> into
which it conveys the bloud that was driven into
the pulmonary Artery out of the right Ventricle
of the Heart, <U+017F>o that it never comes in the left
Ventricle; even as that bloud that is <U+017F>ent out of
the left Ventricle into the <hi>Aorta</hi> never came in
the right, (except a little that is returned from
the nutrition of the Lungs) but pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
into it out of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> by the <hi>Foramen
ovale.</hi> So that the bloud pa<U+017F><U+017F>es not through both
the Ventricles as it does after the <hi>Foetus</hi> is born,
for then it mu<U+017F>t have had its cour<U+017F>e through the
Lungs, which it cannot have, becau<U+017F>e they are
now very den<U+017F>e and lie idle and unmoved. Yea
they are <U+017F>o den<U+017F>e and heavy that if one throw
them into water they will <U+017F>ink, whereas if the
<hi>Foetus</hi> be but born and take only half a dozen
breaths, they become <U+017F>o <U+017F>pongy and light that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49419:112"/>
they will <U+017F>wim. Which (by the way) may be
of good u<U+017F>e to di<U+017F>cover whether tho<U+017F>e Infants
that are killed by Whores, and which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
affirm were <U+017F>till-born, were really <U+017F>o or no.
For if they were <U+017F>till-born the Lungs will <U+017F>ink,
but if alive, (<U+017F>o as to breath never <U+017F>o little a
while) they will <U+017F>wim.</p>
                  <p>5. The Gland <hi>Thymus</hi> is notably large, and
con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts as it were of three Glands.</p>
                  <p>In the lower Belly there are the<U+017F>e differences.</p>
                  <p>1. The Umbilical ve<U+017F><U+017F>els go out of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Stomach is narrower, yet not empty,
but pretty full of a whiti<U+017F>h liquor.</p>
                  <p>3. The Caul is hardly di<U+017F>cernible, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t

                  <p>4. The Guts are <U+017F>even times longer (or more)
than the Body.</p>
                  <p>5. In the <U+017F>mall Guts the excrements are pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous
and yellow, but in the thick <U+017F>omewhat
hard and blacki<U+017F>h, <U+017F>ometimes greeni<U+017F>h: the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>

the right Hypochondre, but extends it <U+017F>elf into
the left <U+017F>ide, and covers all the upper part of the
Stomach. It has a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age now more than in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult

7. The Spleen is <U+017F>mall.</p>
                  <p>8. The Gall-bladder is full of yellow or green
choler.</p>
                  <p>9. The Sweet-bread is very large and white.</p>
                  <p>10. The Kidneys are bigger and unequal in

of a collection of very many Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules.</p>
                  <p>11. The <hi>Renes <U+017F>uccenturiati</hi> are exceeding
large; they do not only border upon the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
as in the adult, but lie upon them, and
embrace their upper part with a large <hi>Sinus</hi> as it
were.</p>
                  <p>12. The Ureters are wide, and the Bladder
di<U+017F>tended with Urine.</p>
                  <p>13. In Females the <hi>

                  <p>It was an old opinion that Milk was made of

(invented to <U+017F>erve an Hypothe<U+017F>is;) <U+017F>o it is
generally denied that either Bloud <U+017F>ent from the
Womb, or from where<U+017F>oever, is the true matter
out of which Milk is made. For not to mention
(which yet is very con<U+017F>iderable) that it is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
that the Mother could every day endure the
lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>o much Bloud (<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e a pound and half)
as the Child <U+017F>ucks daily Milk from the Brea<U+017F>ts; I
think the argument urged by Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> may <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
any Man. <hi>Viz.</hi> 
                     <q>Nature does nothing in

<hi>(which is certain)</hi> and then make Chyle of
Bloud again, <U+017F>he goes <U+017F>o. For Chyle is a <U+017F>ort
of Milk, as appears by the opening of the Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teal
veins. If therefore that Chyle be fir<U+017F>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
into Bloud, and then return again to the
nature of Milk, Nature <U+017F>hould certainly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate
her fir<U+017F>t work.]</q> We <U+017F>hall not therefore
<U+017F>pend further time to refute <U+017F>o improbable (and
now ob<U+017F>olete) an opinion; but <U+017F>hall avow, that
Chyle is the true matter out of which Milk is
made, which is done after this manner.</p>

conveyed into the <U+017F>ubclavian Veins, where it is
mixed with the Bloud, and from whence it is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
with it through the ventricles of the

                  <p>Be<U+017F>ides this matter of the Milk <hi>(viz.</hi> Chyle)
Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> (<U+017F>uitable to his Hypothe<U+017F>is of the

<U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed that the Nerves have <U+017F>uch

after the birth it a<U+017F>cended up to the Brea<U+017F>ts.
But having in the former Book (Chap. 33.)
<U+017F>hewn that the <hi>Foetus</hi> is not nouri<U+017F>hed at all by

by the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that go in and out of its upper
part or ba<U+017F>is. Its <U+017F>ituation in Bea<U+017F>ts that feed
upon Gra<U+017F>s is near the middle of the whole Body,
reckoning from the Head to the Tail; but in Man
(and mo<U+017F>t carnivorous Animals) it is nearer the
Head; whereof the learned Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> gives an
ingenious rea<U+017F>on. <q>Seeing, <U+017F>ays he, the trajection
and di<U+017F>tribution of the Bloud depends wholly
on the <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> of the Heart, and that its liquor
is not driven of its own nature <U+017F>o readily into
the upper parts as into ve<U+017F><U+017F>els even with it, or
downwards into tho<U+017F>e under it: if the <U+017F>ituation
of the Heart had been further from the Head, it
mu<U+017F>t needs either have been made <U+017F>tronger to
ca<U+017F>t out its liquor with greater force; or el<U+017F>e
the Head would want its due proportion of
Bloud. But in Animals that have a longer
Neck, and which is extended towards their food
as it were, the Heart is <U+017F>eated as far from the
Head as from the other parts; and they find no
inconvenience from it, becau<U+017F>e they feed with
their Head for the mo<U+017F>t part hanging down,
and <U+017F>o the Bloud, as it has farther to go to
their Head than in others, <U+017F>o it goes a plainer
and often a <U+017F>teep way.</q>

den<U+017F>e in the left, but mo<U+017F>t compact and hard at
its tip; only on the left <U+017F>ide of the tip it is thin, as
con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting mo<U+017F>tly of the concour<U+017F>e of the inner and
outer Membrane. Its <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is for the
greate<U+017F>t part made up of mu<U+017F>culary Fibres <U+017F>o
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49419:129"/>
that it <U+017F>elf may truly be reputed a Mu<U+017F>cle.</p>
                  <p>Its Fibres are a few of them <U+017F>treight,<note place="margin">Fibres.</note> but far
more oblique. Both are in<U+017F>erted into a Tendon
that is <U+017F>pread over its ba<U+017F>is under the Auricles.
Part of which Tendon at the egre<U+017F>s of the <hi>Aorta</hi>
in <U+017F>ome Creatures becomes bony, as in a Stag, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
On the outer <U+017F>uperficies of the right Ventricle
there run a few <U+017F>lender Fibres <U+017F>treight upwards
and are terminated in its ba<U+017F>is. In which al<U+017F>o
terminate the oblique ones next under the<U+017F>e, a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
from the left <U+017F>ide towards the right,
<U+017F>piral-wi<U+017F>e. The Fibres that lie under the<U+017F>e, go
clean contrary. For they ari<U+017F>e every where
from the right <U+017F>ide of the Heart, whence being
carried obliquely towards the left, and having
embraced each Ventricle of the Heart, they ri<U+017F>e
to the ba<U+017F>is of the left <U+017F>ide <U+017F>piral-wi<U+017F>e as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But they run not all of them the whole
length from the ba<U+017F>is to the cone; for then
would the Heart be as broad or thick at the lower
end as the upper: but <U+017F>ome reach not above half
way, others a little further, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <U+017F>ome to
the very <hi>Apex.</hi> The Fibres of the left Ventricle
differ not from tho<U+017F>e of the right as to kind, only
they are con<U+017F>iderably <U+017F>tronger. Which they are
for this rea<U+017F>on, that whereas the right Ventricle
only promotes the circulation of the bloud
through the Lungs, the left mu<U+017F>t ca<U+017F>t it forth
with that force as that it may circulate through
the whole Body.</p>
                  <p>The curious Reader may find a mo<U+017F>t accurate

whence it is divided into its ba<U+017F>is, which is its
broader part and upper; and into its cone or

a tip or <hi>mucro.</hi>

in the cold and cowardly. In adult per<U+017F>ons it is
commonly <U+017F>ix fingers breadth long, and four
broad at the ba<U+017F>is.</p>
                  <p>Outwardly it is cover'd with a proper Coat,<note place="margin">Coat.</note>

                  <p>Great controver<U+017F>ie hath been and <U+017F>till is about
the motion of the Heart,<note place="margin">The motion of the Heart.</note> whether it depend on

ebullition, or accen<U+017F>ion of the bloud in its
Ventricles, or partly on one, partly on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Plau<U+017F>ible Arguments are produced on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<U+017F>ide, but <U+017F>uch as rather tend to <U+017F>hew the <U+017F>hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
and in<U+017F>ufficiency of the contrary opinions to
<U+017F>olve this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> than pretend to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate
any certain rea<U+017F>on of it. That the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
in<U+017F>truments of its motion are its Fibres,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49419:131"/>
none can doubt; but what <U+017F>ets the<U+017F>e Fibres on
work is all the que<U+017F>tion. That it cannot be the
Animal <U+017F>pirits conveyed by the Nerves <hi>(only)</hi>
is apparent, <hi>fir<U+017F>t,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the Heart moves in
the <hi>Embryo</hi> before either Brain or Nerve are <U+017F>o
perfectly formed, that the Animal <U+017F>pirits can be
elaborated out of the Bloud by the former, or
tran<U+017F>mitted to the Heart by the latter: yea <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are made of Arterial bloud, that mu<U+017F>t
be <U+017F>ent to the Brain by the pul<U+017F>ation of the Heart
before they can be generated. And <hi><U+017F>econdly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
tho<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>cular motions that depend on the
influx of the Animal <U+017F>pirits, are voluntary, which
this of the Heart is not, for we can neither <U+017F>top
it nor ha<U+017F>ten it at our plea<U+017F>ure. <hi>La<U+017F>tly,</hi> becau<U+017F>e
the Heart of living <hi>Foetus</hi>'s (as of young Puppies)
and of Eels, being cut out of the Body and from
all the Nerves by which any Animal <U+017F>pirits <U+017F>hould
flow into it, will continue beating as long as 'tis
warm: yea when it has ceas'd beating, if one
throw warm bloud or but warm water upon it,
it will recover <U+017F>ome kind of pul<U+017F>ation again.
Which may <U+017F>erve al<U+017F>o to convict the <U+017F>econd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of errour; for if its motion depended only
on the dilatation of the bloud, it would cea<U+017F>e
a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as the bloud flows no longer into its Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles.</p>
                  <p>And as to ebullition or accen<U+017F>ion, Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>'s
experiment, or his ob<U+017F>ervation, are a <U+017F>ufficient
confutation of their being the rea<U+017F>on of this pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ation.
His <hi>experiment</hi> is this: <q>He drew out of
the <hi>Jugular</hi> vein of a Dog about half of his bloud
away, injecting by turns into the <hi>Crural</hi> vein a
like quantity of Beer mixt with a little Wine;
and this he repeated alternatively <U+017F>o often, till
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49419:131"/>
in<U+017F>tead of bloud there flow'd out of the Vein
only a paler tincture like water wherein Fle<U+017F>h
had been wa<U+017F>h'd, or Claret diluted with very
much Water; and yet the Heart in the mean
time remitted but a little of its former pul<U+017F>ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.....</q>
His <hi>ob<U+017F>ervation,</hi> which he had from
a Phy<U+017F>ician worthy of credit, is this: <q>A Youth
about <U+017F>ixteen years old, continuing bleeding for
two days together, his friends and tho<U+017F>e that
waited on him gave him good <U+017F>tore of Broth to
keep up and recruit his Spirits; which <U+017F>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
down greedily, his bleeding was now
and then encreas'd thereby, <U+017F>o that at length
having poured forth almo<U+017F>t the whole ma<U+017F>s of
his bloud, that which now run out was dilute
and pale, neither of the nature nor colour of
bloud, but liker the Broth he had drunk <U+017F>o
much of: And this kind of flux continued a day
or two, (the Heart the mean while retaining
its pul<U+017F>ation) till at length being <U+017F>topt, the
Youth was re<U+017F>tored by degrees to entire
health,</q> and grew to a robu<U+017F>t and lu<U+017F>ty Fellow.]
This experiment and ob<U+017F>ervation I <U+017F>ay do make it
apparent, the motion of the Heart depends not
on the ebullition or accen<U+017F>ion of the bloud, for
then when in the fir<U+017F>t the Beer and Wine, in
the <U+017F>econd the Broth flow'd into its Ventricles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead
of Bloud, its motion mu<U+017F>t either have been
more notably alter'd, or rather have quite ceas'd,
the<U+017F>e liquors being <U+017F>o far di<U+017F>tant from the nature
of bloud, e<U+017F>pecially the Broth.</p>
                  <p>And la<U+017F>tly, that this motion is not cau<U+017F>ed
partly by the influx of the animal <U+017F>pirits, and
partly by the ebullition or accen<U+017F>ion of the
bloud, may be evinced by the Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49419:132"/>
again<U+017F>t each opinion apart: and yet if
a rea<U+017F>on could be given, this <U+017F>eems the mo<U+017F>t
probable. Namely, that the bloud de<U+017F>tilling
into the Ventricles of the Heart, is in them
accended and rarefied, and wanting more room
expands or bears again<U+017F>t their Sides: and then
the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Heart being mole<U+017F>ted
by that expan<U+017F>ion, calls in the Animal <U+017F>pirits
for help, which coming in in convenient plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
contract the mu<U+017F>cular Fibres that make up
the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Heart, and <U+017F>o by <U+017F>trait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
its Ventricles drive forth the bloud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in them into the Arteries. But we had
rather ingenuou<U+017F>ly confe<U+017F>s our ignorance of the
rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>o admirable an action, and profe<U+017F>s
with Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> that it is too hard for Man to
conceive of, and that it is the prerogative of
God only, who <U+017F>earcheth the <U+017F>ecrets of the

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49419:133"/>
the Pul<U+017F>e there is a con<U+017F>tant expul<U+017F>ion of Bloud
<hi>from</hi> the Heart; there mu<U+017F>t needs be a continual
influx of Bloud into the Heart out of the <hi>Cava.</hi>
And <U+017F>eeing the <hi>Cava</hi> from whence the <U+017F>upply is,
is never drawn dry, and on the other hand <U+017F>eeing
the Arteries that receive the Bloud continually
from the Heart, are not unduly <U+017F>well'd with it,
it nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily follows that this motion proceeds
<hi>circularly, viz.</hi> that the Bloud is continually dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of the Heart into the Arteries, out of
the<U+017F>e into the Veins and parts to be nouri<U+017F>hed,
then from the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Veins returns to the <hi>Cava,</hi>
and <U+017F>o at length to the Heart again. The inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which circulation is owing to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman
Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> and may be prov'd invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
by the<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons.</p>
                  <p>1. The great quantity of Bloud that is driven
out of the Heart into the Arteries at every Pul<U+017F>e.
For though the Ancients who knew not this circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
imagin'd that only a drop or two were
expelled by every <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole,</hi> which they were nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itated
to <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, to avoid the great di<U+017F>ten<U+017F>ion
that the Arteries mu<U+017F>t be liable to, if any con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
quantity i<U+017F><U+017F>ued into them; yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and demon<U+017F>trable that there mu<U+017F>t needs an
ounce or more be driven into them each time.
For (taking it for granted that there is no other
way for any liquor to pa<U+017F>s from the Stomach to
the Kidneys but through the Heart, along with
the Bloud) <U+017F>eeing if <U+017F>ome Men at <U+017F>ome times
drink three pints of Drink, they <U+017F>hall pi<U+017F>s it out
again in half an hour, yea more of <hi>Tunbridge</hi>
Waters in that <U+017F>pace; and <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>econdly, that
there is commonly as much Bloud as <hi>Serum</hi> that
flows to the Kidneys (the Bloud returning back
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49419:133"/>
by the Emulgent veins) it is clear that by the
two Emulgents (which are none of the large<U+017F>t
Arteries) there mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s in half an hours
time <U+017F>ix pounds of liquor, all which mu<U+017F>t come
from the Heart; and how much more then may
we conceive to be driven through all the other
Arteries that run through the whole Body? This
is more accurately evinced by Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>'s experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is this: <q>I cut a<U+017F>under (<U+017F>ays he)
both <hi>Cervical</hi> arteries in a large Dog, and at
the <U+017F>ame time through an hole made in the left
<U+017F>ide of his Brea<U+017F>t over again<U+017F>t the Heart, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>t
the trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> below the Heart
with my finger, to hinder any Bloud from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cending
by it; and la<U+017F>tly I took care al<U+017F>o to
<U+017F>traiten the <hi>Brachial</hi> arteries under the <hi>Axillae,</hi>
by which means almo<U+017F>t all the Bloud was driven
out of the Heart through the <hi>Cervicals</hi> (be<U+017F>ides
that which was <U+017F>ent into the <hi>Vertebrals)</hi> and
which is wonderfull to be related, within the
twentieth part of an hour the whole ma<U+017F>s i<U+017F><U+017F>ued
out; <U+017F>o that it is not to be denied but that it
all pa<U+017F>t through the Heart in that <U+017F>pace.]</q> And
though it may be granted that amid<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch wounds
and tortures the Heart does beat <U+017F>omewhat quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in <U+017F>uch a ca<U+017F>e than at other times; yet the
<U+017F>ame thing is partly evident from wounds in the
Limbs when <U+017F>ome notable Artery is cut a<U+017F>under,
for 'tis <U+017F>trange in how <U+017F>mall a time a Man will
bleed to death even at that one Artery. Yea we
may give a great gue<U+017F>s how much Bloud is <U+017F>ent
out at every Pul<U+017F>e, even from the ordinary open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one <hi>Vein</hi> in the Arm, from whence a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
quantity of Bloud will i<U+017F><U+017F>ue in a <U+017F>hort time;
how much then may we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e would flow out of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49419:134"/>
all the Veins, if they were opened at one time?
Seeing then 'tis evident that <U+017F>o great a quantity
of Bloud is expelled out of the Heart at every <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tole,</hi>
and that for all that the Arteries are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly
di<U+017F>tended nor any part <U+017F>well'd by it, neither
yet the <hi>Cava</hi> and other Veins emptied, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the Bloud that is driven into the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
flows back to the Heart by the Veins, in a
con<U+017F>tant circulation.</p>
                  <p>2. A <U+017F>econd Argument to prove it, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Valves in the Veins, which are <U+017F>o
framed that Bloud may freely flow through them
out of the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Veins into the greater, (and <U+017F>o
into the <hi>Cava)</hi> but not on the contrary out of
the greater into the le<U+017F>s. Yea if one blow into
the <hi>Cava</hi> through a Pipe, there will no wind
pa<U+017F>s into the <U+017F>maller Veins; but on the contrary,
if you blow up the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Veins, the wind will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
pa<U+017F>s to the larger and <U+017F>o to the <hi>Cava.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. And la<U+017F>tly, The <U+017F>ame thing is mo<U+017F>t clear by
the Ligature in bloud-letting. For whether you
let bloud in the Arm or Foot, you always tie the
Fillet above where you intend to make the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and then the Vein below the Ligature will
pre<U+017F>ently fill and grow tumid, but above it will
fall and almo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>appear. Which mu<U+017F>t needs be
from hence, for that the Bloud being driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Arteries towards the extreme parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
by the Veins and a<U+017F>cends upwards, which
coming to the Ligature and being <U+017F>topt there,
<U+017F>wells the Vein below the Ligature, and <U+017F>purts
out a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as the Orifice is made: but when the
Fillet is loo<U+017F>ed again, the Bloud flows no longer
out thereat, but holds on its wonted channel, the
Vein, and the Orifice clo<U+017F>es up again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:49419:134"/>
Having <U+017F>ufficiently demon<U+017F>trated the circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Bloud we will <U+017F>hew two things further,
fir<U+017F>t, how the Bloud pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out of the Arteries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Veins, and <U+017F>econdly in how long a time the
whole ma<U+017F>s of Bloud may be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to pa<U+017F>s
through the Heart in its ordinary circulation.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>fir<U+017F>t,</hi> it was the opinion of <hi>Riolanus</hi>
that the Bloud circulated only through the larger
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, by ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es or ino<U+017F>culation of the
Veins with the Arteries, and that that which run
into the <U+017F>maller, was all <U+017F>pent on the nutrition
of the parts. But it is clear that there mu<U+017F>t be
a circulation even in the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t, from the great
quantity of Bloud that will flow out of the lea<U+017F>t
Artery in the Hand or Foot, when it is cut;
which it were very ab<U+017F>urd to imagine to be all
<U+017F>pent on the nouri<U+017F>hment of the re<U+017F>pective part.
Now there are but two ways whereby the Bloud
can be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to pa<U+017F>s out of the Arteries into the
Veins, <hi>viz.</hi> either by the former opening into the
latter by ino<U+017F>culation, or el<U+017F>e by the Capillary
arteries letting out their Bloud into the pores of
the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the parts, on who<U+017F>e nutrition
part is <U+017F>pent, and the remainder imbibed by the
gaping mouths of the Capillary veins. And it
<U+017F>eems nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to admit both the<U+017F>e ways; this
<hi>latter,</hi> becau<U+017F>e if part of the Arterial bloud did
not i<U+017F><U+017F>ue into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the parts, they
could not be nouri<U+017F>hed by it, for while it is in the
ve<U+017F><U+017F>els it may add warmth indeed to the parts
through which it flows, but cannot nouri<U+017F>h them,
<U+017F>eeing even the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els them<U+017F>elves are not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed
by that <U+017F>tream of Bloud that glides along
their Cavity, but by Capillaries running through
their Coats; and if the Bloud be driven into the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49419:135"/>
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the parts, and that in a greater
quantity than <U+017F>uffices for their nouri<U+017F>hment (as
was ju<U+017F>t now <U+017F>hewn) what is <U+017F>uperfluous mu<U+017F>t
needs enter the mouths of the Capillary veins,
from which it goes forward to the larger and <U+017F>o
to the Heart: But <U+017F>eeing this way of transfu<U+017F>ing
the Blood through the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the parts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wers
not to that ha<U+017F>ty circulation of the Bloud
we above demon<U+017F>trated; it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary al<U+017F>o to
admit of the <hi>former</hi> way, namely ana<U+017F>tomo<U+017F>es, in
which the Veins are continued to the Arteries,
and that not only in their larger branches (as
that notable one of the Splenick artery with the
Splenick vein) but al<U+017F>o in their <U+017F>maller twigs in
the extreme parts.</p>
                  <p>And <hi><U+017F>econdly</hi> as to the <U+017F>pace of time in which
the whole ma<U+017F>s of Bloud may ordinarily circulate
through the Heart, it is probably much <U+017F>horter
than many have imagined. For <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing that
the Heart makes two thou<U+017F>and pul<U+017F>es an hour
(which is the lea<U+017F>t number any <U+017F>peak of, and
<U+017F>ome have told twice as many) and that at every
pul<U+017F>e there is expelled an ounce of Bloud (which
we may well <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, <U+017F>eeing the Ventricles are
wide enough to contain two ounces, and that it is
probable both that they are filled near full in the
<hi>Dia<U+017F>tole,</hi> and that they are near if not quite empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <U+017F>trong con<U+017F>triction of the Heart in the
<hi>Sy<U+017F>tole)</hi> <U+017F>eeing the whole ma<U+017F>s u<U+017F>ually exceeds
not four and twenty pound, it will be circulated
<U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even times over through the Heart in the
<U+017F>pace of an hour. And by <U+017F>o much the oftener,
by how much the Bloud comes <U+017F>hort of the <U+017F>uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed

By which quick motion the Bloud it <U+017F>elf
is kept from coagulation and putrefaction, and
the parts are cheri<U+017F>hed with vital heat, which
heat of the parts is much according to the <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s
or rapidne<U+017F>s of the circulation; <U+017F>o when we <U+017F>it
<U+017F>till and the pul<U+017F>e is <U+017F>low or rare, we grow cold,
but when upon running or any violent exerci<U+017F>e

But every time the new infu<U+017F>ed Chyle pa<U+017F><U+017F>es

than any other,<note place="margin">The colour of the bloud.</note> no rea<U+017F>on can be given but the
will of the Creatour, though <U+017F>ome attribute it to
the Heart, others to the mixture of <U+017F>alt and <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acid
juices with <U+017F>ulphureous; even as the Oyl of
Vitriol being poured upon Con<U+017F>erve of Ro<U+017F>es, or
other thing that is of a <hi>pali<U+017F>h</hi> red (if it contain
any thing of <U+017F>ulphur) makes it of a mo<U+017F>t <hi>deep</hi>
red. We will not <U+017F>pend time to <U+017F>hew in how
many re<U+017F>pects this <U+017F>imilitude falls <U+017F>hort of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rea<U+017F>on of the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> but <U+017F>hall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
our <U+017F>elves with inquiring from whence the
difference of colour ari<U+017F>es between the Venal and
Arterial bloud. Every one knows that Bloud let
out of a Vein into a Porringer, is indeed of a
florid <U+017F>carlet colour in its <U+017F>urface, but all that
coagulates is of a dark red colour from the <U+017F>uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
to the bottom, and of <U+017F>uch a colour it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
as it <U+017F>treams out of the Orifice of the
Vein. But if an Artery be cut, the <U+017F>tream then
looks of a far brighter colour, like the <U+017F>uperficies
of the Venal bloud when it is congealed in a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringer.
Now the Arterial bloud receives not
this florid colour in the Heart but in the Lungs.
For if it receiv'd it in the Heart, then might the
right Ventricle be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to give it as well as
the left: but that it does not do <U+017F>o, is clear by
this experiment of Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>'s. If you open the
<hi>Vena arterio<U+017F>a</hi> which receives the Bloud out of the
right Ventricle, the Bloud differs nothing in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
from the Venal, but its curdled part looks
every whit as black. But if one open the <hi>Arteria
veno<U+017F>a</hi> as it is entring into the left Ventricle, it has
the perfect colour of Arterial bloud; which
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49419:137"/>
<U+017F>hews, that as it ows not that colour to the left
Ventricle any more than to the right, (being
not yet arriv'd at it) <U+017F>o it mu<U+017F>t receive that alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of colour in the Lungs, in which the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
air being diffu<U+017F>ed through all the particles
of the Bloud is intimately mixed with it, and (if
you will) accends it. For if there be any <U+017F>uch
thing as a <hi>Flamma vitalis</hi> (properly <U+017F>o called) in
Animals, though the Bloud be to it in<U+017F>tead of the
Oyl or other matter whereon it feeds, yet it
oweth the continuance of its burning to the Air,
without the continued in<U+017F>piration of which the
Animal cannot live, but in<U+017F>tantly dies, even as a
Candle is pre<U+017F>ently extingui<U+017F>hed if you put it in a
clo<U+017F>e place where the air cannot come to it, or
by <U+017F>ome Engine be <U+017F>uckt from it. But this by
the bye. For I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s that (notwith<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the plau<U+017F>iblene<U+017F>s of the opinion) this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the colour of the Bloud by the Air in the
Lungs, is no <U+017F>ufficient argument to prove any
<U+017F>uch vital flame, <U+017F>eeing the Arterial bloud being
extrava<U+017F>ated, retains its florid colour, when no
doubt if there ever was any accen<U+017F>ion, the flame
is extingui<U+017F>hed. But this <U+017F>carlet colour is meerly
from the mixture of the particles of the Air with
the Bloud, from which it tran<U+017F>pires, in a great
mea<U+017F>ure, through the pores of the Skin, while
the Bloud circulates in the habit of the Body out
of the Arteries into the Veins, whence the Venous
bloud becomes <U+017F>o much darker in colour than the
Arterial. And yet the Venous bloud it <U+017F>elf
when extrava<U+017F>ated appears of a <U+017F>carlet dye in
its <U+017F>urface, which is meerly from its being expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
to the Air; for if one turn the congealed Bloud
in a Porringer up<U+017F>ide down, the bottom which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49419:138"/>
at the turning is blacki<U+017F>h, will in a little while
turn red.</p>
                  <p>Though we have confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that the Chyle does
circulate through the Body <U+017F>everal times before it
be perfectly a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated to the Bloud;<note place="margin">Whether the body be nouri<U+017F>h'd by bloud.</note> yet we do
not think that it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es into the nouri<U+017F>hment of
the parts in the form of Chyle. And therefore
when <U+017F>peaking of the nutrition of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the
Womb (Book 1. Chap. 33.) we often mentioned
a nutritious juice (which was Chyle a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd)
we did not call it <U+017F>o with re<U+017F>pect to the
<U+017F>olid parts of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> but to the Bloud it <U+017F>elf
who<U+017F>e <hi>Pabulum</hi> or nouri<U+017F>hment it is, a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as the
Umbilical vein is formed, as the Bloud is of the
Body. For as to the increa<U+017F>e of the fir<U+017F>t delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
parts of an imperfect <hi>Embryo,</hi> that is far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from ordinary nutrition.</p>
                  <p>The Bloud then con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of particles of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature, each particle pa<U+017F><U+017F>es into the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment
of that part which is of the <U+017F>ame nature.
So the <U+017F>alt and <U+017F>ulphureous particles being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mixt, are agglutinated and a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated to the
fle<U+017F>hy or mu<U+017F>culous parts; the oily and <U+017F>ulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Fat; the <U+017F>alt and tartareous to the
Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this is not done by any electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or attraction of the parts, as if they pick'd
and choos'd (with a kind of di<U+017F>cretion) <U+017F>uch
particles of the Bloud as are <U+017F>uitable to their own
nature: For the ma<U+017F>s of Bloud is equally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
carried to all the parts: But there is
that diver<U+017F>ity of figure both in the <U+017F>everal parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Bloud and in the pores of each part,
that in the circulation through the habit of the
Body <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tick in the<U+017F>e, and others in tho<U+017F>e,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49419:138"/>
where they are fa<U+017F>ten'd aud united to the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance
of the re<U+017F>pective parts; and tho<U+017F>e which through
their peculiar figure are unapt to adhere to one or
other, return again to the Veins and <U+017F>o to the
Heart, where they receive <U+017F>ome new alteration.
So that as <hi>the Life of the Fle<U+017F>h is in the Bloud</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Levit. 17. 11.)</hi> <U+017F>o has it its vital heat

upon the ba<U+017F>is of the Heart, and end in an obtu<U+017F>e
point, making an obtu<U+017F>e triangle. They are as
it were two appendages of the Heart, <U+017F>eated at
its ba<U+017F>is over the Ventricles. They are of the
<U+017F>ame fabrick and u<U+017F>e, being both Mu<U+017F>cles, and
made up of the <U+017F>ame order of Fibres, which are
carried into oppo<U+017F>ite Tendons, whereof that at
the ba<U+017F>is of the Heart is common to it and the<U+017F>e
<hi>Auriculae,</hi> and the other runs along their upper
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49419:139"/>

le<U+017F>s, but more firm. Their <U+017F>uperficies is <U+017F>mooth
when they are filled; but when empty, it is
wrinkled, and the left more than the right.
When they are cut open, there appear in their
Cavity many fle<U+017F>hy columns running from the
upper to the lower Tendon, and betwixt them
there are pretty deep Ditches or long Cavities,
but fewer in the right than the left.</p>
                  <p>They are dilated and contracted in like manner
as the Heart,<note place="margin">Their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> but at different times: for the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tole</hi>

the <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> of the <hi>Auriculae</hi> with the <hi>Dia<U+017F>tole</hi> of the
Ventricles. So that the <hi>Auriculae</hi> are a receiving
their Bloud from the Veins, while the Ventricles
are expelling theirs into the Arteries; and when
the Ventricles are relaxed and empty in their
<hi>Dia<U+017F>tole,</hi> the Auricles force their Bloud into
them by their <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They <U+017F>erve to receive the Venal bloud imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

to mea<U+017F>ure it as it were into the Ventricles.
Whither that they may expell it with the greater
force, the internal Fibres or Columns of their
cavity ari<U+017F>ing from their root where they are
joined to the ba<U+017F>is of the Heart, reach directly

                     <hi>Arteria pulmonaris</hi> and <hi>Aorta.</hi> The right is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and not exactly round but almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>emicircu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
nor reacheth down to the <hi>Mucro</hi> or tip of
the Heart; the left is narrower but rounder and
longer, reaching down to the very tip. Now
though the out<U+017F>ide of the Heart be <U+017F>mooth, yet
the<U+017F>e Ventricles are very unequal, having their
<U+017F>ides hollowed into divers inter<U+017F>tices or furrows,
and interwoven with carnous Fibres reaching this
way and that way. They are more numerous in
Men's Hearts, than in tho<U+017F>e of any other Animal;
though <U+017F>uch as are big, as Hor<U+017F>es and the like,
have them larger. The<U+017F>e Fibres or fle<U+017F>hy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
<U+017F>erve to <U+017F>traiten or con<U+017F>tringe the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and the clefts or furrows betwixt them help
their <U+017F>ides to clo<U+017F>e more exactly in their <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi>
than they could have done, had they been <U+017F>mooth.
The Fibres are more and <U+017F>tronger and the furrows
deeper in the left Ventricle than in the right, yea
they are al<U+017F>o in that <U+017F>ide of the <hi>Septum</hi> that makes
part of the left, though that <U+017F>ide that looks to the
right be well nigh <U+017F>mooth. For there was need
of greater and <U+017F>tronger con<U+017F>triction in the left
than in the right; <U+017F>eeing the right expels the
Bloud to no greater circuit than through the
Lungs, but the left to the extreame<U+017F>t parts of the
Body.</p>
                  <p>They are divided from one another by the
<hi>Septum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Septum.</note> or a partition that <U+017F>tands like a Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. It is hollow towards the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle,
and (as was ju<U+017F>t now <U+017F>aid) has <U+017F>uch like
Fibres and Clefts as the re<U+017F>t of the Cavity; but
towards the right it is convex or bunching out,
and has but very little inequality. Many have
been of opinion that it has <U+017F>ome wider pores
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49419:140"/>
through which part of the Bloud does pa<U+017F>s im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
out of the right into the left Ventricle;
but he that <U+017F>earches for them diligently will find
none, unle<U+017F>s he fir<U+017F>t make them with his Probe.
And indeed if there were any in grown per<U+017F>ons,
we may much more <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e them to be in <hi>Foetus</hi>'s
in the Womb, in whom are <U+017F>everal pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages that
after the birth are obliterated. But if the<U+017F>e were
in the <hi>Foetus,</hi> then <U+017F>hould Nature have made tho<U+017F>e
two other pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages in vain, namely the <hi>Foramen
ovale,</hi> whereby the Bloud pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out of the <hi>Cava</hi>
into the <hi>Vena pulmonaris</hi> as it is entring the left
Ventricle; and the <hi>Canalis arterio<U+017F>us,</hi> which carries
the Bloud out of the <hi>Arteria pulmonaris</hi> into the
<hi>Aorta.</hi> I <U+017F>ay if the Bloud could have pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed out
of one Ventricle into the other (without going
through the Lungs) by any pores that perforate
the <hi>Septum,</hi> the<U+017F>e other pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages had been <U+017F>uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.
And therefore we may <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, that as
in grown per<U+017F>ons they cannot be found by any
Probe or Bri<U+017F>tle, <U+017F>o they were not there even
while the <hi>Foetus</hi> was in the Womb, <U+017F>eeing there
was no occa<U+017F>ion for them.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>u<U+017F>e</hi> of the Ventricles, it may be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
partly by what has been di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed in the

it is probable that it is ab<U+017F>orbed by the

the Diaphragm, (upon which <U+017F>uch matter mu<U+017F>t

by the Kidneys out of the Emulgent arteries,

<U+017F>ometimes one, <U+017F>ometimes two twigs called <hi>Venae

Heart bring back into the <hi>Cava</hi> the Bloud that is
<U+017F>uperfluous from its nutrition. As the<U+017F>e open
into the <hi>Cava</hi> there is a Valve placed, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the Bloud to return by them into the <hi>Cava,</hi>
but hinders any to pa<U+017F>s out of the <hi>Cava</hi> into
<hi>them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before this trunk of <hi>Vena cava</hi> open into the
Ventricle it is joined to that other trunk that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cends
from the <hi>Claviculae,</hi> (though for method's
<U+017F>ake we mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ider <hi>that</hi> as a continuation of
<hi>this,</hi> by and by) and both of them di<U+017F>charge the
Bloud contained in them by one mouth into the
<U+017F>aid Ventricle. As they are going to join, there
comes a Tubercle or Protuberance betwixt them,
that hinders the one from opening into the other
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49419:141"/>
in a direct line, but makes them both go obliquely
towards the left hand as they enter the <hi>Auricula;</hi>
without which provi<U+017F>ion, that Bloud that is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cending
from the <hi>Claviculae</hi> would have faln <U+017F>o
full on that which is a<U+017F>cending by this trunk of
the <hi>Cava,</hi> we have been a de<U+017F>cribing, as mu<U+017F>t have
made it either to <U+017F>tagnate (if not regurgitate)
or however would have retarded its motion.</p>
                  <p>Now immediately below this protuberance,
out of the united trunk there goeth a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the ba<U+017F>is of the Heart to the <hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi>
in <hi>Foetus</hi>'s in the Womb, which a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as they are
born clo<U+017F>es up and becomes obliterate. The
rea<U+017F>on of this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Bloud in them is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
their Lungs having either none or but a
very ob<U+017F>cure and imperfect motion, the Bloud
does but little of it pa<U+017F>s through them, but a
good part of it through this <hi>Foramen</hi> out of the
<hi>Cava</hi> into the <hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi> ju<U+017F>t as it is entring
into the left Ventricle, into which this Bloud is
di<U+017F>charged together with that little that is retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by the <U+017F>aid <hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi> from the nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lungs. For though there be expelled
out of the right Ventricle a pretty quantity of
Bloud at every pul<U+017F>e into the <hi>Arteria pulmonalis,</hi>
yet there is but a little of it that goes to the
Lungs (though all do in adult per<U+017F>ons, that it
may be there impregnated with Air) but the
greate<U+017F>t part by a Pipe called <hi>Canalis arterio<U+017F>us</hi>
runs into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> which Pipe does degenerate
into a Ligament after the <hi>Foetus</hi> is born. So that
the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb liveth after the manner of
Fi<U+017F>h or other Creatures that have no Lungs and
but one ventricle of the Heart; for there is but
very little of its Bloud that pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth any more than
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49419:142"/>
one of its Ventricles in one circulation, that
which circulateth through one mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing the other.
But to return:</p>
                  <p>The united trunk of the <hi>Cava</hi> opens by one
large Orifice into the right ventricle of the Heart,
into which is poured all the Bloud that returns
from all the parts of the Body (except the
Lungs) in its circulation. And le<U+017F>t in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tole</hi>
or con<U+017F>triction of the Heart, the Bloud
<U+017F>hould be expelled the <U+017F>ame way that it comes in
by; at the Orifice of the <hi>Cava</hi> there grows a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
circle, which is cleft into three membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Valves, looking inwards, called <hi>Tricu<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
(or three-pointed) which permit the Bloud
to come in, but not to go out. And this office
the<U+017F>e Valves perform in this manner, (as is mo<U+017F>t
ingeniou<U+017F>ly de<U+017F>cribed by Dr. <hi>Lower.)</hi> Out of the
<U+017F>ides of the right Ventricle there grow certain
<hi>Papillae</hi> or round and long Caruncles (called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
fle<U+017F>hy Columns) from who<U+017F>e top there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
certain tendinous Fibres that are knit to the<U+017F>e
membranous Valves. Now the<U+017F>e Membranes
encompa<U+017F>s the orifice of the <hi>Cava</hi> round about, <U+017F>o
that whereas the <hi>Mucro</hi> or tip of the Heart is in
every <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> drawn up towards the ba<U+017F>is, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillae</hi>
being al<U+017F>o moved upwards do <U+017F>lacken their
Fibres (like Bridle-reins) whereby it comes to
pa<U+017F>s that the Membranes (or Valves) al<U+017F>o, to
which they are tied, hanging loo<U+017F>e are driven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(like <U+017F>ails filled with wind) by the Bloud
that is <U+017F>queezed in every <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> of the Heart, and
thereby they <U+017F>hut this inlet into the Heart <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that not a drop of liquor can flow back again
into the <hi>Auricula</hi> or <hi>Cava,</hi> but is expelled all into
the <hi>Arteria pulmonalis</hi> that is now open: But, as in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49419:142"/>
every <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> of the Heart (its tip being brought
nearer its ba<U+017F>is) the <hi>Papillae</hi> do much relax their
Fibres; <U+017F>o in the <hi>Dia<U+017F>tole</hi> the tip receding from the
ba<U+017F>is again does al<U+017F>o draw down the <hi>Papillae</hi> and
their Fibres with it: whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s that
the Membranes or Valves being al<U+017F>o drawn down
do pre<U+017F>ently un<U+017F>hut this Orifice, and open the
door as it were for more Bloud to come in, what
came in before being expelled in the la<U+017F>t <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole.</hi>
                  </p>

After its beginning, which is betwixt the fourth

it begins ju<U+017F>t to keep the middle. It <U+017F>ends forth
on each <U+017F>ide Interco<U+017F>tal branches to the Inter<U+017F>tices
of the eight lowe<U+017F>t Ribs; and at the eighth Rib
it is divided into two branches: One whereof,
being the larger, de<U+017F>cends toward the <hi>left hand</hi>
betwixt the proce<U+017F><U+017F>es of the Diaphragm, and is
in<U+017F>erted <U+017F>ometimes into the <hi>Cava</hi> above or below
the Emulgent, but oftner into the Emulgent it
<U+017F>elf: The other being the <hi>right</hi> is joined al<U+017F>o to

It was formerly held, before the circulation of
the Bloud was found out, that in an <hi>Empyema</hi> of
the <hi>Thorax,</hi> the matter was ab<U+017F>orbed by the
mouths of this Vein, and carried directly to the
Emulgent veins, where it was <U+017F>eparated with the
<hi>Serum</hi> by the Kidneys. But <U+017F>eeing the Bloud does
indeed a<U+017F>cend from the Emulgents by this Vein,
and that at its in<U+017F>ertion into them there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a Valve that hinders any thing from i<U+017F><U+017F>uing
out of the <hi>Vena <U+017F>ine pari</hi> into the Emulgent, but
permits the contrary; it is certain that if this
Vein be at any time an in<U+017F>trument to evacuate
<U+017F>uch <hi>Pus,</hi> it mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F>cend to the <hi>Cava</hi> and pa<U+017F>s

how the mouths of this Vein <U+017F>hould open <U+017F>o
wide into the cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> as to imbibe
<U+017F>limy roapy <hi>Pus,</hi> and yet not let forth the Bloud
that is more fluid; <U+017F>o that one would hardly a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
this office to it: yet when the <hi>Pus</hi> is collected
betwixt the <hi>Pleura</hi> and Interco<U+017F>tal mu<U+017F>cles and
the Tumour does not bur<U+017F>t, I <U+017F>ee not why it may
not be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed that the Interco<U+017F>tal branches of
the <hi>Vena <U+017F>ine pari</hi> do imbibe the matter out of the
Tumour, and carry it that way which was ju<U+017F>t

of the cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it floats upon
the Diaphragm, the <hi>Venae phrenicae</hi> are liker to do

when we de<U+017F>cribed tho<U+017F>e Veins. Of this <hi>Vena <U+017F>ine

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49419:145"/>
being complicated with tho<U+017F>e of the Vein do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

exactly accompany all the branches of the Wind-pipe

or impregnated with the particles of the
nitrous Air. For there is but a very little <U+017F>pent
on the nutrition of the Lungs, but the greate<U+017F>t
part of it is driven into the <U+017F>mall twigs of the

                  <p>The third ve<U+017F><U+017F>el is called <hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi> or

Fibres that a<U+017F>cend to them from the <hi>Papillae</hi> or
fle<U+017F>hy columns, <U+017F>tronger. For <U+017F>eeing the Bloud is
expelled more impetuou<U+017F>ly out of the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
than out of the right, (for the Bloud <U+017F>ent
out of the one is to circulate only through the
Lungs, but that out of the other, through the
whole Body) it was convenient that the Valves
and Fibres <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>tronger, to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

motion of the Bloud, and hindring it from
returning into this Vein again, to direct its cour<U+017F>e
into the <hi>Aorta</hi> who<U+017F>e orifice opens in the <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi>
of the Ventricle.</p>
                  <p>Ju<U+017F>t as this <hi>Vena pulmonaria</hi> is entring into the
left Ventricle, there is, in a <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb,
a Pipe called <hi>Foramen ovale</hi> that opens into it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the <hi>Cava,</hi> as was noted above. To
which we <U+017F>hall here add, that at its orifice into
this Vein there is a Valve placed, that hinders
any Bloud from returning into the <hi>Foramen</hi> out
of the Vein.</p>
                  <p>And here there is one thing worth noting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the pulmonary Artery and Vein, That
whereas in all the other Arteries and Veins
through the whole Body be<U+017F>ides, the Bloud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Arteries is of a bright <U+017F>carlet colour,
and that in the Veins of a black purple; on the
contrary, the <hi>Arteria pulmonaris</hi> containeth black
purple Bloud, and the Vein <U+017F>carlet-coloured.
The rea<U+017F>on whereof was <U+017F>hewn before, Chap. 7.
<hi>viz.</hi> That the <U+017F>carlet colour of the Bloud is wholly
owing to the mixture of Air with it in the Lungs.
And therefore that Bloud which the pulmonary
Artery brings into the Lungs out of the right
ventricle of the Heart, being the Venal bloud
that was brought thither from the circulation by
the <hi>Cava,</hi> changes not its colour till it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out
of the <U+017F>mall twigs of the <U+017F>aid Artery into tho<U+017F>e
of the pulmonary Vein, where the airy particles
in<U+017F>inuate them<U+017F>elves into it, and <U+017F>o alter its
colour.</p>
                  <p>The pulmonary Vein hath no Valve in it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that at its opening into the left Ventricle.
Of which Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> giveth this rea<U+017F>on, That the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49419:146"/>
Bloud within the <hi>Praecordia</hi> may always, becau<U+017F>e
of the <hi>Impetus</hi> of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, freely fluctuate and
regurgitate both ways, backwards and forwards.
And le<U+017F>t the left ventricle of the Heart <U+017F>hould at
any time be <U+017F>uffocated by the Bloud ru<U+017F>hing too
impetuou<U+017F>ly into it, the fle<U+017F>hy Fibres in the root
of the Vein (for both this and the <hi>Cava</hi> have
<U+017F>uch there) by the in<U+017F>tinct of Nature contracting
them<U+017F>elves invert its cour<U+017F>e, and make it flow
backward towards the Lungs.</p>

A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as the <hi>Aorta</hi> is gone out of the Heart, it

for if it had, <U+017F>eeing it openeth <U+017F>treight upward

the lower parts of the Body would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded

                  <p>In a <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb there comes a Pipe out

<hi>Canalis arterio<U+017F>us,</hi> which brings out of it the

thus of two Tunicles has many large pores,
but <U+017F>uch as admit not any thing to pa<U+017F>s from

not <U+017F>o much as to make the flame of a Candle to

the Brea<U+017F>t has been opened to let out matter in an

<hi>Pus</hi> is cough'd up, it is certainly bred in
the Lungs them<U+017F>elves; yet I am of opinion that
in an <hi>Empyema</hi> when it is thin, the<U+017F>e pores may
be <U+017F>o large as to imbibe it even out of the cavity

tapping: for of the two I think this a far
more probable way to di<U+017F>charge the matter by,
than that it <U+017F>hould be imbib'd by the mouths of
the Veins gaping (as is <U+017F>uppos'd) either in the
<U+017F>uperficies of the <hi>Pleura</hi> or Diaphragm. But to
proceed.</p>
                  <p>The Lungs are divided into the right and left
part,<note place="margin">Divi<U+017F>ion.</note> being parted by the <hi>Media<U+017F>tinum,</hi> and each
part is otherwi<U+017F>e called a <hi>Lobe.</hi> And becau<U+017F>e
they are two, that have no communication one
with the other (<U+017F>ave in one <hi>Trachea,</hi> by which
the Air comes into and goes out of them) hence
in common <U+017F>peech we <U+017F>ay <hi>Lungs</hi> in the plural.
Each of the<U+017F>e parts or Lobes is <U+017F>ubdivided into
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:49419:157"/>
two, <U+017F>ometimes three others, and tho<U+017F>e into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Figure taken from Dr. <hi>Willis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lungs hang by the <hi>A<U+017F>pera arteria</hi> that runs

their lower end to the Diaphragm.</p>
                  <p>They have all <U+017F>orts of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,<note place="margin">Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.</note> that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

them<U+017F>elves they have <hi>Bronchia</hi> or the branches of

                  <p>Their <hi>Arteries</hi> and <hi>Veins</hi> are the <hi>Arteria</hi> and

                     <note place="margin">2. Arteries and Veins.</note> that accompany all the divi<U+017F>ions

                  <p>THE <hi>Action</hi> for which the Lungs are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Nature is <hi>Re<U+017F>piration,</hi> which is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative
<hi>Dia<U+017F>tole</hi> and <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole,</hi> or dilatation and
contraction of the Brea<U+017F>t, whereby the Air is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in, and driven forth of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lungs do not dilate them<U+017F>elves by
any proper power or faculty of their own,<note place="margin">How re<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is performed.</note> being
de<U+017F>titute of in<U+017F>truments to perform <U+017F>uch an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
nor do they attract the Air by any magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
property, in in<U+017F>piration: But the Mu<U+017F>cles of
the <hi>Thorax</hi> being <U+017F>o framed, that though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
be the only and proper action of a Mu<U+017F>cle,
yet the <hi>Thorax</hi> is dilated by certain of them, as it
is contracted by others; whil<U+017F>t it is dilated, there
is greater <U+017F>pace given for expanding the Lungs,
and then the Air by its proper ela<U+017F>tick virtue
does of its own accord i<U+017F><U+017F>ue in at the <hi>Trachea,</hi>
and in<U+017F>inuates it <U+017F>elf into all its <hi>Bronchia</hi> and into
the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae,</hi> and puffs them all up; namely to
the end that its nitrous particles may every where
meet with the Bloud as it glides through all the
parts of the Lungs: And when the Brea<U+017F>t rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from that dilatation is contracted, the
Lungs, being partly compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed thereby, and
partly by the mu<U+017F>cular Fibres of the <hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae</hi> and
of the inner coat of the <hi>Trachea</hi> and <hi>Bronchia,</hi>
expell the Air out again.</p>
                  <p>The Mu<U+017F>cles that a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t the dilatation of the

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49419:161"/>
them backwards; which <U+017F>hall be de<U+017F>cribed
Book 4. Chap. 15. And be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
internal Mu<U+017F>cle, namely the Midriff, that
contributes towards it, as was <U+017F>hewed Chap. 3. of
this Book, where we treated of it. And as for
the <U+017F>traitning or concidence of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> that
it is not only a motion of re<U+017F>titution, or a ce<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the fore<U+017F>aid Mu<U+017F>cles from their action, as
evident, <U+017F>eeing <U+017F>ometimes expiration is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
more laboriou<U+017F>ly and violently than in<U+017F>pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as in coughing, hollooing, or the like.
And therefore Nature has provided peculiar and
proper Mu<U+017F>cles for that purpo<U+017F>e, de<U+017F>cribed in
the <U+017F>ame Chapter of the fourth Book; and the<U+017F>e
are a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted partly by <U+017F>ome Mu<U+017F>cles of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and partly by the mu<U+017F>cular Fibres of the
<hi>Ve<U+017F>iculae, Trachea</hi> and <hi>Bronchia,</hi> as above<U+017F>aid.</p>
                  <p>There hath been great controver<U+017F>ie among
Philo<U+017F>ophers whether re<U+017F>piration be an Animal
or Natural motion.<note place="margin">What kind of motion re<U+017F>piration is.</note> That it is <hi>natural,</hi> is thought
to be proved, both in that it is performed as well
when we are a<U+017F>leep, as awake; and al<U+017F>o that
though it be continued through a Man's whole
life, yet we are never wearied with it as we are
with animal and voluntary motions. On the
other <U+017F>ide <U+017F>ome prove it to be <hi>animal,</hi> fir<U+017F>t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
it is performed by <U+017F>uch In<U+017F>truments as <U+017F>erve
for animal motion, namely Mu<U+017F>cles; and <U+017F>econd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becau<U+017F>e at our plea<U+017F>ure we can make it quicker
or <U+017F>lower, <U+017F>tronger or weaker, or alter it how
we plea<U+017F>e. Others thinking the arguments on
either <U+017F>ide convincing, take both in, and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e
it a kind of mixt action, partly natural, and
partly <U+017F>pontaneous. But I think there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity
from the arguments alledged to grant this
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:49419:161"/>
motion to be natural, or any more than animal or
<U+017F>pontaneous. For as to the <hi>fir<U+017F>t</hi> argument, that
the motion is as well performed when we <U+017F>leep as
when we are awake, and therefore it cannot be
voluntary; if this were allowed to be of force,
we mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o grant walking and talking to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
motions, becau<U+017F>e many perform them both,
when they are a<U+017F>leep. And as to the <hi><U+017F>econd,</hi>
from our not being wearied by it, in an<U+017F>wer to it
we may di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h of animal actions, into <U+017F>uch
as are done by in<U+017F>tinct and are free, and into
<U+017F>uch as <U+017F>erve the affections of the mind: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
proceed always and without impediment,
even when we think not thereon, but may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
be directed and moderated when we
do think of them, and <U+017F>uch is re<U+017F>piration; the
latter is not performed continually, as to run,
leap, write, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the former there is a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
and continual influx of animal <U+017F>pirits into
the Mu<U+017F>cles, of cu<U+017F>tom or cour<U+017F>e; whence there
follows no wearine<U+017F>s, though they be continual:
In the latter, <U+017F>eeing by the determination that is
made in the Brain the <U+017F>pirits now flow in and
anon cea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ometimes in greater plenty and
<U+017F>ometimes in le<U+017F>s, from this mutation and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>tomedne<U+017F>s
does the wearine<U+017F>s proceed.</p>
                  <p>Re<U+017F>piration is <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to the continuance
of life,<note place="margin">The u<U+017F>e of it.</note> that after once the <hi>Foetus</hi> comes into the
open Air and begins to breath, it can hardly live
two minutes without it. But upon what account
it becomes <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary is not agreed among lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men, each party exhibiting <U+017F>uch rea<U+017F>ons of
it, as may be<U+017F>t <U+017F>uit with their hypothe<U+017F>es. Hence
<hi><U+017F>ome</hi> (and tho<U+017F>e the mo<U+017F>t) think that re<U+017F>pirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<U+017F>erves for the cooling and ventilating of the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49419:162"/>
Bloud that acquires a great heat in the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
of the Heart, and al<U+017F>o for the carrying out
fuliginous <U+017F>treams therefrom. <hi>Others,</hi> that it
<U+017F>erves for the better mixture of the particles of
the Bloud as it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es through the Lungs, as al<U+017F>o
to further its circulation. <hi>Others,</hi> that the Air
is in<U+017F>pired for the greater <U+017F>ubtilization of the
Bloud, and inkindling of the vital <U+017F>pirits, or
(to continue the metaphor) vital flame. More
opinions there are, but this la<U+017F>t is (if not the
true<U+017F>t) the mo<U+017F>t ingenious, and is very learnedly
maintained by Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> Dr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> &amp;c.

four <U+017F>quare, as the <U+017F>talks of <U+017F>ome Plants; <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
triangular, but always porous, the pores

                  <p>Hairs are commonly divided into <hi>Congeniti,</hi>

and vi<U+017F>cid juice. Whatever the matter be, it is
attracted by the white roots of the Hairs, and is
carried even to their very ends by the pores; ju<U+017F>t
as Plants receive nouri<U+017F>hment out of the Earth by
their Roots, and communicate it to their outmo<U+017F>t

has been thought to de<U+017F>til upon the Palate, the
flegm poured upon it by the <hi>Infundibulum.</hi> But
Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> denies this, appealing to the <U+017F>tructure
of the parts, and his often experiments upon
Calves heads: <q>In which, he <U+017F>ays, the wedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Bone lying under the <hi>Glandula pituitaria</hi>
is <U+017F>ometimes perforated in divers places, at
lea<U+017F>t by one large duct, which being divided
into two does on each <U+017F>ide open into the Jugular
veins: <U+017F>o that if Milk or Ink be injected through
tho<U+017F>e ducts by a Syringe, it pre<U+017F>ently pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth
through on each <U+017F>ide into the <U+017F>aid Veins; and
nothing of tincture will appear about the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
No<U+017F>trils, Mouth, <hi>Fauces</hi> or <hi>Larynx.</hi> So
that in a Calf the humour that proceeds from
the Brain, returns all again into the Veins.
And the <U+017F>ame thing he <U+017F>ays he has lately tried
in a Man's Skull, wherein though the wedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Bone be never perforated, yet Nature has
framed other ducts whereby all the <hi>Serum</hi> may
be again derived out of the Ventricles of the
Brain into the Bloud: for there are two Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els
<U+017F>eated on each <U+017F>ide the <hi>Sella Turcica</hi> (to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed

water or milk be <U+017F>quirted forcibly out of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
into either Jugular vein near the Skull,
for the liquor will by and by break out near the
<hi>Glandula pituitaria,</hi> which makes it evident,
that whatever <hi>Serum</hi> is <U+017F>eparated into the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles
of the Brain, and i<U+017F><U+017F>ues out of them

Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> grants only the former u<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>ays,
<q>that It is incredible that the humour that is

i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out by the Nerves into the No<U+017F>trils, for if

<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es it to be of very great u<U+017F>e: namely,
that when <hi>Effluvia</hi> or mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubtil particles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling

the <hi>olfactory Nerves,</hi> that their <U+017F>pecies may

                  <p>IT is generally agreed that the proper Action
of the Brain (in a large <U+017F>en<U+017F>e) is the elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
of Animal <U+017F>pirits; and that they are <U+017F>ent
from it by the Nerves into the <U+017F>everal parts of the
Body, for performing both natural and animal
actions. But what the<U+017F>e Animal <U+017F>pirits are, and
in what particular part of the Brain they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
is not agreed upon by learned Men.</p>
                  <p>Some are of opinion that the Animal <U+017F>pirits
differ in no other regard from the Vital,<note place="margin">The animal <U+017F>pirits what, and of what made.</note> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as they are conveyed by proper Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and
mini<U+017F>ter to other purpo<U+017F>es, and are of a cooler
temperament; but that there is no <U+017F>pecifical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt them. Others on the other <U+017F>ide
think they differ <hi>in <U+017F>pecie,</hi> and agree in nothing,
but only that the Vital <U+017F>pirits and Bloud are the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:49419:176"/>
matter from whence the Animal <U+017F>pirits are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
A third <U+017F>ort deny the Arterial bloud to be
the matter of the<U+017F>e Spirits, and affirm that the
Nerves ab<U+017F>orb a part of the Chyle, of which they
are made, and be<U+017F>ides, a Nutritious juice, (of

of <U+017F>everal of the<U+017F>e opinions here; but upon a due
con<U+017F>ideration of the Arguments urged for each,
we think that the Animal <U+017F>pirits are <U+017F>pecifically

the whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Brain for the place of
their confection. As to the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Falx,</hi> the
u<U+017F>e of that was <U+017F>hewn above Chap. 3. And as to
the Ventricles, <U+017F>eeing they are often almo<U+017F>t <hi>quite

a<U+017F>cribes this work to the very <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the
Brain, and is performed in this manner. The
Heart is like the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> of the Body, to
which the motion of all the humours, that have
once pa<U+017F>t it, is owing. This by its <hi>Sy<U+017F>tole</hi> impells
the Bloud, as into all other parts, <U+017F>o into the
Brain by the <U+017F>everal branches of the <hi>Carotides,</hi>
who<U+017F>e innumerable twigs run partly through the
outer <hi>Cortex</hi> or greyi<U+017F>h part of the Brain, and
partly into the inner medullar or white <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance.
The<U+017F>e twigs of Arteries <U+017F>pring partly from the
<hi>Plexus choroides</hi> and <hi>Rete mirabile,</hi> and partly
from the <hi>Carotides</hi> them<U+017F>elves immediately. The
<U+017F>uperfluous <hi>Serum</hi> of the Bloud is <U+017F>eparated by the
Glands above de<U+017F>cribed; and that which is not
elaborated into Animal <U+017F>pirit, is returned again
to the Heart, by the Veins. But tho<U+017F>e particles
that are fit and proper to be converted into them,
are extrava<U+017F>ated into the very <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the
Brain, or at lea<U+017F>t are di<U+017F>tributed through it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ible

Heart, whereby that which comes behind, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

the true cau<U+017F>e of an Apoplexy (wherein motion

                  <p>There is no le<U+017F>s controver<U+017F>ie about the Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
juice of the Nerves:<note place="margin">The <hi><U+017F>uccus nutritius</hi> of the Nerves.</note> <U+017F>ome contending for it
to that height, as to affirm that all the parts of
the Body are only nouri<U+017F>h'd by it, and not at all
by the Bloud, which by its rapid motion they <U+017F>ay
is liker to wear and carry away <U+017F>omething from
the parts through which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es, than to adhere
to them for their re<U+017F>tauration. Others are more
moderate, and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that nouri<U+017F>hment is di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<U+017F>ed
only to the <U+017F>permatick parts by the
Nerves, which the Nerves receive not from the
Bloud, but imbibing the mo<U+017F>t thin part of the
Chyle out of the Stomach and Guts do carry it up
to the Brain, from whence it is conveyed again
by the <U+017F>ame Nerves to the parts to be nouri<U+017F>h'd
by it. <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> is of opinion, that the juice
of the Nerves (which is as a Vehicle to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits)
being <U+017F>omewhat acid, does contribute or
yield a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to the nouri<U+017F>hment of the <U+017F>perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
parts, not as it is the matter of, but as it <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates
from the Bloud <U+017F>uch particles as are fit
for, their nouri<U+017F>hment. Whence it is, he <U+017F>ays,
that <U+017F>uch parts of the Body as are mo<U+017F>t exerci<U+017F>ed,
and by con<U+017F>equent into which mo<U+017F>t Animal <U+017F>pirits
flow, grow the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t, having more of <U+017F>uch
particles of the Bloud as are fit for their in<U+017F>taura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<U+017F>eparated in them. So they that are u<U+017F>ed
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:49419:178"/>
to walk, will endure it better, than others that
are not <U+017F>o u<U+017F>ed, though otherwi<U+017F>e much <U+017F>tronger.
And hence the right Arm is u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>tronger than
the left, in tho<U+017F>e that are right-handed (as we
<U+017F>ay.) But he thinks that the Nerves have no
juice in them which they did not fir<U+017F>t receive from
the Bloud. Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> is much of his opinion,
<U+017F>aving as to this la<U+017F>t particular; for he <U+017F>ays, it is
without doubt that the nervous Fibres and Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which cloath the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ory of the ta<U+017F>te, and
the Bowels that <U+017F>erve concoction, do immediately
take <U+017F>ome ta<U+017F>te of the Aliments for the <U+017F>upply of
the Brain, e<U+017F>pecially at <U+017F>uch times as the Spirits
are much wa<U+017F>ted in too long fa<U+017F>ting or over much
exerci<U+017F>e. But then that juice that may be <U+017F>uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
to be made thereof in the Brain, and to be
di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed by the Nerves into all the parts of the
Body, he believes not to be the matter of the
nouri<U+017F>hment of any part whether <U+017F>permatick or
<U+017F>anguineous: but that it is as the <hi>form</hi> only, and

a rea<U+017F>on why paralytick parts do wa<U+017F>te <U+017F>o much,
though the Bloud flow plentifully enough into
them, becau<U+017F>e the Nerves being ob<U+017F>tructed and
no Animal <U+017F>pirits (with their Vehicle) pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing
by them, the particles of the Bloud are not <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
for the <U+017F>upply of <U+017F>uch parts.] As for the
nervous juice, it mu<U+017F>t needs be very little in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
<U+017F>eeing if one make a Ligature upon the
Nerve, it will not <U+017F>well betwixt the Head and
Ligature, nor if one cut the Nerve in <U+017F>under will
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49419:178"/>
any thing de<U+017F>til out of it. So that 'tis very ab<U+017F>urd
to think that it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ufficient for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment
of all the parts of the Body, according
to the fir<U+017F>t opinion. Nor does it <U+017F>eem rea<U+017F>onable
to imagine that the Chyle <U+017F>hould a<U+017F>cend from the
Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Brain by the Nerves, whiles
this nervous juice that is contended for, with the
Animal <U+017F>pirits, is de<U+017F>cending by the <U+017F>ame; for
one cannot conceive how <U+017F>uch contrary motions
of liquors in the <U+017F>ame Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el can be at the <U+017F>ame
time. Though from the <U+017F>udden refection that
per<U+017F>ons ready to faint receive from <U+017F>pirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> it be probable that certain <hi>Effluvia</hi>
or <U+017F>ubtil and <U+017F>pirituous vapours do enter the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<U+017F>ilaments of the Mouth and Stomach, and
recruit the Animal <U+017F>pirits immediately, without
fetching that compa<U+017F>s that I believe all the Chyle
does. And as the Nerves imbibe no Chyle from
the Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> <U+017F>o receive they no more from
the Arteries, than <U+017F>ome of its mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>pirituous and
volatile particles elaborated in the Brain into
Animal <U+017F>pirits, which have indeed <U+017F>ome little
moi<U+017F>ture accompanying them as a Vehicle, but
which is neither of a <U+017F>uitable nature nor of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
quantity for the nouri<U+017F>hment even of
the <U+017F>permatick parts only. For <U+017F>eeing the Nerves
have no con<U+017F>picuous Cavity, but only impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
Pores, by which any liquor can drill along
them; <U+017F>uch liquor mu<U+017F>t needs be mo<U+017F>t thin and
watery, and therefore unfit to be a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated to
any part. And la<U+017F>tly, as to the opinion that it
<U+017F>eparates the particles of the Bloud, and <U+017F>o di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tributes

two others to the Mu<U+017F>cles of the Gullet and Neck.
But the other Fibres of this <hi>par vagum</hi> continue
united, and in<U+017F>tead of tho<U+017F>e companions they
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:49419:183"/>
have parted with, they entertain a new one,
namely a branch from the Interco<U+017F>tal or ninth pair,
whereby is made a notable <hi>Plexus</hi> (which in a
Nerve is like the jointing of a Cane, or the knot
upon the trunk of the Tree where a Bough goes
out) and out of the <U+017F>ame <hi>Plexus</hi> there <U+017F>prings a
con<U+017F>iderable branch, which being carried toward
the <hi>Larynx</hi> is divided into three twigs, of which
one goes to the <U+017F>phincter of the Gullet, a <U+017F>econd
to the upper Mu<U+017F>cles of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and the third
going under the <hi>Cartilago <U+017F>cutiformis,</hi> meets the
top of the recurring Nerve and is united to it.
Below the afore<U+017F>aid <hi>Plexus</hi> of this <hi>par vagum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Progre<U+017F>s.</note> its

<hi>Carotides,</hi> on which it be<U+017F>tows <U+017F>ome <U+017F>lips.
And at the bottom of the Neck it receives a <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
branch from the Interco<U+017F>tal, <hi>(viz.</hi> from its
fir<U+017F>t <hi>Plexus)</hi> and near thereto <U+017F>ends out another
twig into the recurrent Nerve, but only on the
left <U+017F>ide. From hence the trunk of this eighth
pair de<U+017F>cends without any notable ramification,
till it be come over again<U+017F>t the fir<U+017F>t or <U+017F>econd
Rib; where out of a <U+017F>econd <hi>Plexus</hi> (or knot)
many twigs and Fibres go towards the Heart and
its appendage, but not altogether in the <U+017F>ame
manner on both <U+017F>ides. There is one notable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
(which we cannot but note) of the two
<hi>recurring Nerves</hi> that <U+017F>pring out of the trunk of
this eighth pair, <hi>viz.</hi> that that on the right <U+017F>ide
ari<U+017F>es out of it higher and windes about the axillar
Artery; whereas that on the left <U+017F>prings much
lower therefrom, and twi<U+017F>ting about the de<U+017F>cend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> returns back from thence.
Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> <U+017F>ays that the <hi>recurring Nerve</hi> is really a
di<U+017F>tinct Nerve from the <hi>par vagum</hi> from the very
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:49419:183"/>
original, and was only included in the <U+017F>ame ca<U+017F>e
or cover for the more convenient and <U+017F>afe pa<U+017F><U+017F>age.
The branches of the <hi>par vagum</hi> do frequently
unite with others of the Interco<U+017F>tal pair about the
<hi>Praecordia.</hi> And many twigs go out of the eighth
pair into the Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence each of its
trunks de<U+017F>cending by the <U+017F>ides of the Gullet are
divided into two branches, <hi>outer</hi> and <hi>inner:</hi> The
outer unite with the outer, and the inner with
the inner, and both de<U+017F>cend to the Stomach, in
which they terminate. As for their more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
di<U+017F>tribution, we have <U+017F>poke thereof while
we treated of the parts them<U+017F>elves on which they
are be<U+017F>towed.</p>
                  <p>We are now come to the <hi>ninth</hi> or la<U+017F>t pair
(commonly not di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from that going
before) which is called the <hi>Interco<U+017F>tal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ninth pair.</note> becau<U+017F>e as
it marches down by the roots of the Ribs, betwixt
every Rib it receives a branch from the <U+017F>pinal
marrow.<note place="margin">Its ri<U+017F>e.</note> It has no proper root of its own, but
its trunk is compounded of two or three recurring
branches of the fifth and <U+017F>ixth pair, (near their
origine) as was noted when we treated of tho<U+017F>e
pairs. Being thus formed it pa<U+017F><U+017F>es out of the
Skull by its proper hole, and pre<U+017F>ently has a
<hi>Plexus</hi> near that of the <hi>par vagum,</hi> into which
two nervous proce<U+017F><U+017F>es out of the fir<U+017F>t vertebral

twig into the <U+017F>phincter of the Gullet, and into
the <hi>Plexus</hi> (afore<U+017F>aid) of the <hi>par vagum.</hi> Whence
de<U+017F>cending by the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, by that
time it arrives at its middle, it has another
greater <hi>Plexus, into which</hi> a large Nerve from a
neighbouring vertebral pair is in<U+017F>erted; and

the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> as al<U+017F>o one <U+017F>ingle one a little lower.
This <hi>Plexus cervicalis</hi> out of which <U+017F>o many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<U+017F>pring is proper to Man, being not found in
Brutes. From the Neck it de<U+017F>cends by the <hi>Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae</hi>
into the <hi>Thorax,</hi> where having arrived at the
<U+017F>econd Rib it receives three or four branches from
the vertebral Nerves next above, whereby is made
another notable <hi>Plexus</hi> (commonly called the
<hi>Interco<U+017F>tal.)</hi> From whence as its trunk pa<U+017F><U+017F>es
down by the roots of the Ribs, in every one of
their Inter<U+017F>tices and even as low as <hi>Os <U+017F>acrum,</hi>
from every jointing of the <hi>vertebrae</hi> it receives a
vertebral pair. A<U+017F><U+017F>oon as it is de<U+017F>cended out of
the cavity of the Brea<U+017F>t, and is come over again<U+017F>t
the Stomach, it <U+017F>ends forth on each <U+017F>ide a notable
branch, which tending towards the Me<U+017F>entery,
make its chief <hi>Plexus,</hi> which are in number <hi><U+017F>even,
five large</hi> ones which are <hi>upper,</hi> and <hi>two le<U+017F>s</hi> that
are <hi>lower.</hi> For each branch is pre<U+017F>ently divided
into two other, and every one forms one <hi>Plexus,</hi>
which make four; and the fifth is in the middle
of the<U+017F>e, being the large<U+017F>t, and like the Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
the Planets (as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> compares it.)
And the<U+017F>e are the <hi>five upper.</hi> The <hi>two lower</hi> are
framed of branches that <U+017F>pring from the trunk
de<U+017F>cended as far as the lower part of the Loins,

they have little <U+017F>oft Cartilages, (called <hi>Cilia</hi> in

meet the more exactly. Upon the<U+017F>e Cartilages
there grow Hairs, which having grown to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

that they never need to be cut. Tho<U+017F>e on the

                  <p>The Eyelids have two corners called <hi>Canthi.</hi>

The <hi>outer</hi> of the<U+017F>e is le<U+017F>s, and in its upper part it

affording the mo<U+017F>t of that <hi>Lympha</hi> that makes the

made up of many le<U+017F><U+017F>er, and has <U+017F>mall twigs of

glibly. <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> having reckoned eight
opinions concerning the cau<U+017F>e, origine and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of tears rejects them all, and this we have
mention'd with the re<U+017F>t: and thinks that their
matter is the more <U+017F>erous and thin particles of
the pituitous humour gathered in the Brain, and
flowing to the Eyes, upon its contraction, through
the <hi>Foramen lachrymale.</hi> Which the learned
Reader may <U+017F>ee defended in his <hi>Anat. lib. 3. cap. 15.</hi>
There is another Gland in the inner <hi>canthus</hi> or
corner, which helps the former in its office.
Dr. <hi>Briggs</hi> <U+017F>ays, there are two or three lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and has many capillary Veins and
Arteries creeping through it, which are mo<U+017F>t

From the <hi>Dura mater</hi> <U+017F>pringeth the outmo<U+017F>t coat
of the Nerve, and from this the Tunicle that is
<U+017F>pread next under the <hi>Adnata,</hi> called <hi>Sclerotioa</hi>
from its hardne<U+017F>s; but in its fore-part where it
covereth the <hi>Iris</hi> and <hi>Pupilla,</hi> it is named <hi>Cornea,</hi>
from its tran<U+017F>parency; though <U+017F>ometimes this
latter name includes the whole Tunicle, as well
behind as before.</p>
                  <p>That which lieth next under the <hi>Cornea</hi> is much
thinner than it,<note place="margin">2. Choroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> and is called <hi>Choroides,</hi> from its
re<U+017F>embling the Membrane <hi>Chorion</hi> wherein the
<hi>Foetus</hi> is included in the Womb. Its fore-part
is otherwi<U+017F>e called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>vea,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it is <U+017F>omewhat
of the colour of a Grape. This <U+017F>prings from the
<hi>Pia mater,</hi> and is <U+017F>pread from the bottom or
centre of the Eye, behind all over the Eye to the
<hi>Pupilla;</hi> to who<U+017F>e circumference when it is come,
it becomes double, making with one part the <hi>Iris,</hi>
with the other the <hi>Ligamentum ciliare.</hi> On the

<hi>Iris,</hi> it is of divers colours re<U+017F>embling the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,
from whence it borrows its name: yet in
<U+017F>ome it is more blue, in others black, in others
grey. This Tunicle is perforated before as wide
as the <hi>Pupilla</hi> (or <U+017F>ight of the Eye) to permit
the rayes of vi<U+017F>ible <U+017F>pecies to pa<U+017F>s in to the cry<U+017F>tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line

Filaments or Fibres, (like the Hairs of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids)
running like <U+017F>o many black lines from the

<hi>Retiformis</hi> (Net-like:) This <U+017F>eemeth to be the

argues, neither the cry<U+017F>talline humour, through
which the rayes pa<U+017F>s much refracted; nor the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
<hi>Choroides,</hi> are at all fit for this u<U+017F>e. For
this latter part (as ri<U+017F>ing from the <hi>Pia mater)</hi>
cannot communicate the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the rayes
to the medullar part of the Brain, which it does
not at all touch. Whereas the medullary Fibres
of the <hi>Retina</hi> have communication therewith, and
therefore can well perform that office. The
Fibres of this Tunicle are extended from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
or inner centre of the Eye, where the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Nerve enters it, as far as the <hi>Ligamentum
ciliare,</hi> (to which it affords Animal <U+017F>pirits for the
continuance of its motion.) If one take this
<hi>Tunica Retina</hi> and put it into warm water, <U+017F>haking
it a little, to wa<U+017F>h off the mucous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance that
cleaves to it, and then hold it up to the light,
the<U+017F>e Filaments will appear very numerous like
the threads of the fine<U+017F>t Lawn.</p>

                  <p>Now of the motion of the Mu<U+017F>cles there are
four differences;<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the motion of mu<U+017F>cles.</note> fir<U+017F>t, the contraction: <U+017F>econd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

kinds: for it is either a continued part of the
Bone jetting manife<U+017F>tly above its plain <U+017F>uperficies,
for the more commodious in<U+017F>ertion of the Mu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,

of the Bone which is received, flatti<U+017F>h: <U+017F>uch is the
articulation of the lower Jaw with the Temple-bone.
The third is <hi>Ginglymos;</hi> when the <U+017F>ame
Bone receiveth, and is received. This falleth
out three manner of ways. Fir<U+017F>t, when the Bone

this may be <U+017F>een in the Spondyls or <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of
the Back, where the middle Bone receiveth the
upper, and is received by the lower. The third
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:49419:244"/>
is, when the proce<U+017F>s of the Bone being long and

<hi>Frontalis,</hi> by which the outer proce<U+017F>s of the <hi>Os

Before, it is joined with the Forehead-bone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,

the upper Jaw; and below, the Bones of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of the Mouth by the wing-like Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es. It

and in the adult it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of two <hi>Laminae</hi> and a
<hi>Diploe,</hi> like the other Bones proper to the Skull.
In Infants it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of three or four. It has four

the <hi>Os lachrymale,</hi> behind with the third, and la<U+017F>t

and a Vein pa<U+017F>s from the Palate to the No<U+017F>trils.
The <hi>fifth</hi> is long, hard, and rea<U+017F>onable thick; it

                  <p>Six Bones then make up the orbit of the Eye.
The fir<U+017F>t is <hi>Frontale,</hi> which maketh the upper

                  <p>Both the Jaws have <hi>Alveoli</hi> or Sockets for the
Teeth, in number equal with the number of the
Teeth. But when in old age the Teeth fall out,
the Sockets clo<U+017F>e together, <U+017F>o that in time there
remains no print of them, but the Bone becomes

                  <p>The rudiments or principles of the Teeth are
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:49419:250"/>
bred with the other parts in the Womb, but lie
hid for <U+017F>ome months within the Jaws and Gums,

<U+017F>ome breaking through the Gums <U+017F>ooner,
others later, as every one may ob<U+017F>erve in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
But though after <U+017F>uch a term of man's
life, no new Teeth <U+017F>pring; yet they grow conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
as long as a Man lives, el<U+017F>e would they be

we <U+017F>ee that when a Tooth is lo<U+017F>t out of either Jaw,
that which is oppo<U+017F>ite to it in the other Jaw,
will grow longer than the re<U+017F>t, having none to

foremo<U+017F>t Double-teeth mo<U+017F>t change; but the re<U+017F>t
of the Double-teeth very few. Now concerning
this changing of the Teeth we mu<U+017F>t note, that the
old ones do not come out by the roots, but their
upper part only drops off, their root remaining
<U+017F>till in the Socket of the Jaw, which (being
like <U+017F>eed for the new ones) by degrees grows up
above the Gums to <U+017F>upply the place of that which
was faln off. Commonly about the twentieth
year (or upwards) there <U+017F>pring out two Double-teeth
behind the re<U+017F>t, which till then had lain
hid in their Sockets. The<U+017F>e are called Genuine

In the <hi>upper</hi> part it has a round head; the
<U+017F>lender part under this is called its Neck, and is
pretty long and oblique. The Neck is an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy<U+017F>is</hi>
or proce<U+017F>s to the Bone it <U+017F>elf, and the round
Head an <hi>Epiphy<U+017F>is</hi> or Appendix to the Neck.
This Head is received by the large Cavity or <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabulum</hi>
of the <hi>Coxendix,</hi> and is detained therein
by two <U+017F>trong Ligaments; one that encompa<U+017F><U+017F>es

four Ligaments to <U+017F>trengthen the articulation.
Secondly, a common membranous Ligament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girts
the whole articulation of the lower Jaw
with the Temple-bone. Thirdly, the Bone at
the root of the Tongue has four, by which it is
tyed to the neighbouring parts; and the Tongue
it <U+017F>elf has one <U+017F>trong one on its under-<U+017F>ide, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:49419:267"/>
called its <hi>Fraenum)</hi> which being two <U+017F>hort or
running too near its tip, hindreth its motion.
Children being <U+017F>o troubled, are <U+017F>aid to be Tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed,
and mu<U+017F>t have it cut. Fourthly, both the
Bodies and Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es of all the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the
Back are knit together by Ligaments, as al<U+017F>o are
the Ribs with the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> behind, and with the
Brea<U+017F>t-bone before. Fifthly, <U+017F>undry are to be
<U+017F>een in the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> The fir<U+017F>t tieth the <hi>Os ilium</hi>
to <hi>Os <U+017F>acrum.</hi> The <U+017F>econd knitteth the <hi>Os <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum</hi>
to the <hi>Coxendix.</hi> The third and fourth knit
the Share-bones together, one of them compa<U+017F><U+017F>ing
them circularly, and the other, which is mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous,
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ing their very <hi>Foramen.</hi> As for
the Ligaments of the Liver, Bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho<U+017F>e
were di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of when we de<U+017F>cribed tho<U+017F>e parts
in Book 1. Sixthly, in the Arm the<U+017F>e appear.
1. Five tie the <hi>Os humeri</hi> to the Shoulder-blade.
2. The Bones of the Cubit, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>lna</hi> and <hi>Radius,</hi>
are tied fir<U+017F>t one to another; <U+017F>econdly, to the
Shoulder-bone; and thirdly, to the Wri<U+017F>t by
(mo<U+017F>tly) membranous Ligaments. 3. There are
annular Ligaments at the Wri<U+017F>ts, which being
tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>e, confirm and make <U+017F>teady the Tendons
which pa<U+017F>s to the Fingers. They are two; one
in the out<U+017F>ide, for the Tendons of the extending
Mu<U+017F>cles; the other in the inner <U+017F>ide, for the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
of the contracting Mu<U+017F>cles. 4. The Bones
of the Wri<U+017F>t, back of the Hand and Fingers, have
membranous Ligaments. Seventhly, In the Leg
are the<U+017F>e. 1. The Thigh-bone is tied to the
<hi>Coxendix</hi> by two Ligaments. 2. The lower end
of it is tied to <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula</hi> by <U+017F>ix Ligaments.
3. The <hi>Tibia</hi> is joined to the <hi>Fibula</hi> by three mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
Ligaments, <hi>viz.</hi> two common and one
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:49419:268"/>
proper. 4. <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula</hi> are joined to the
<hi>Talus</hi> by three Ligaments, and there are three
other for the <U+017F>trengthening of the Tendons.
5. The <hi>Talus</hi> is tied with the other Bones of the
Foot by five Ligaments. 6. The Bones of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tep
and Toes are tied with <U+017F>uch Ligaments as
tho<U+017F>e of the Hand are.</p>

                  <p>IN the la<U+017F>t place we will <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omething of the
Nails, which though they are not <hi>truly</hi> parts
of the Body, yet for their u<U+017F>efulne<U+017F>s ought not to
be omitted.</p>
                  <p>They are of an horny tran<U+017F>parent <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance,
coming neare<U+017F>t to that of Bones, fa<U+017F>ten'd upon
the ends of the Fingers and Toes for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
They are endued with no <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, nor is
that colour which they appear to be of upon the
Fingers, owing to their proper <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, but to
the colour of the parts that lie under them;
whence they <U+017F>ometimes look ruddy, <U+017F>ometimes
pale, blue or yellow, and thereby give <U+017F>ome inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the <U+017F>tate of the Body. They grow
very firmly to the Fle<U+017F>h that lies under them; and
to fa<U+017F>ten them the better, they are tied about
their root with a Ligament, and on their <U+017F>ides
the Skin clo<U+017F>es them in. The parts that lie under
them are very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, for there are <U+017F>everal twigs
of Nerves and tendons of Mu<U+017F>cles that run to the

in pain, if the<U+017F>e <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible parts had not
been thus defended by the Nails.</p>
                  <p>They may in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>en<U+017F>e be reputed parts of the
Body, <U+017F>o as that it would not be perfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
without them: but that is but an improper
notion of a part. For if they were properly parts,
they <U+017F>hould live by the common life of the Body;
but that they do not, <U+017F>eeing <hi>they</hi> as well as the
<hi>hair</hi> continue to grow after a Man is dead: and
their growth <U+017F>eems meerly to be by appo<U+017F>ition of
