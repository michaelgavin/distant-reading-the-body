         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving had the happine<U+017F>s to be well acquainted with the Ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this Treati<U+017F>e, while I <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>iderable time in <hi>Paris,</hi> in pur<U+017F>uance of tho<U+017F>e advantages in Phy<U+017F>ick, which are now found there to be very great and extraordinary; by the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al care, and diffu<U+017F>ive munificence of the pre<U+017F>ent Active Monarch; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>omuch that the Curious and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itive of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther famous Univer<U+017F>ities, do now continually flock to <hi>Paris,</hi> for their better improvement; enjoying not only the plea<U+017F>ure of this Author's good Conver<U+017F>ation, but the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of his great Practice, in the
<pb facs="tcp:40248:3"/>
Cure of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; Finding his Principles e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed, not only by many good Ratiocinations, but <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by much Experience; And being an eye witne<U+017F>s there, how well <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s did an<U+017F>wer his Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions, I have thought it not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s to make <hi>England</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the <U+017F>ame benefit of the<U+017F>e Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervations, that <hi>France</hi> did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lately receive. And that <hi>France</hi> did indeed receive <U+017F>ome benefit by this Book, we have rea<U+017F>on enough to believe, if we can tru<U+017F>t the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the be<U+017F>t Phy<U+017F>icians there. For hardly hath Book been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with more numerous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations of Learned and Able men. The mo<U+017F>t Famous Faculty of <hi>Paris</hi> was plea<U+017F>ed to atte<U+017F>t the u<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne<U+017F>s of it, though I believe no Univer<U+017F>ity in the World is more cautious of admitting or approving
<pb facs="tcp:40248:3"/>
New Principles, or New Practice in Phy<U+017F>ick: None can keep clo<U+017F>er to the Ancient Long-experienced Method than they. The King's fir<U+017F>t and chief Phy<U+017F>ician, the chief Phy<U+017F>icians of the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> and of Madam, the <U+017F>everal Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons al<U+017F>o of the Royal Families, and mo<U+017F>t eminent ones in <hi>Paris</hi> did all agree to put their Names to it, for to te<U+017F>tifie their particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of this Book, and the great U<U+017F>efulne<U+017F>s of the<U+017F>e Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 'Twill therefore need no Rhetorick to recommend it to the Publick; the lamentable Practice, to <U+017F>ay no wor<U+017F>e, that is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly u<U+017F>ed in the Cure of this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e, by many who do acquire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves a Reputation by nothing el<U+017F>e but good <U+017F>tore of Confidence, will <U+017F>ufficiently convince tho<U+017F>e that read and under<U+017F>tand it, of what con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb facs="tcp:40248:4"/>
it may prove to the better performance of their undertakings.</p>
            <p>I know that the Author neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s, before the publick appearance of this Work, whil<U+017F>t his De<U+017F>ign was the Subject of men's ill-grounded Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, wanted not enemies in abundance to cen<U+017F>ure &amp; decry him; tho<U+017F>e who were Ma<U+017F>ters in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tery, and had long and <U+017F>weetly ta<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the plea<U+017F>ant fruits, and plentiful rewards of men's unhappine<U+017F>s and debauchery, became pre<U+017F>ently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen<U+017F>ive; thought there was Treachery in the ca<U+017F>e; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to villifie the thing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on too, as much as they were able, 'till the Pre<U+017F>s had cleared, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troyed all their Jealou<U+017F>ies.</p>
            <p>Now the <U+017F>ame exceptions may be made again<U+017F>t its appearance in Engli<U+017F>h, many may perhaps <U+017F>hrink, and fear <U+017F>ome diminution of their
<pb facs="tcp:40248:4"/>
livelihood; others may indeed plead again<U+017F>t our thus expo<U+017F>ing the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this, as well as other parts of Phy<U+017F>ick, to the <U+017F>mall under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every Good Woman or illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate pretender. The fir<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t only be pitied, for that they build their Fortunes only on the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of others; but the latter may de<U+017F>erve a more ample con<U+017F>iderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For many Sober and Learned men have been of the opinion, that our thus di<U+017F>covering all parts of Phy<U+017F>ick in the Language of every Go<U+017F><U+017F>ip, is far from being beneficial to the publick; that we hereby put edged tools into the hands of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and teach men to play too much with their own and others Healths.</p>
            <p>But if we well con<U+017F>ider what the mo<U+017F>t eminent Phy<U+017F>icians in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages did in this matter, we <U+017F>hall
<pb facs="tcp:40248:5"/>
quickly di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate <U+017F>uch groundle<U+017F>s fears, and reconcile our opinions to this Conde<U+017F>cention to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Capacities. <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Cel<U+017F>us,</hi> and others, both Greek and Latine Oracles in Phy<U+017F>ick, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways write their works in Greek and Latine, becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e were the Mother-languages of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys; and their De<U+017F>ign was really to do their Countreys good. How ea<U+017F>ily do men grant, that every Good, the more it is communicated, the better it is! And certainly that man doth effectually do more good, who makes his labours conduce to the benefit of the Generality, than he who de<U+017F>ires to be Admired only in the Clo<U+017F>ets of Contemplative men, or the Schools of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity. The Hone<U+017F>t Improvers of Husbandry, and Mechanicks, were the men Deified heretofore, and
<pb facs="tcp:40248:5"/>
that will <U+017F>till de<U+017F>erve Immortal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in all future Ages. <hi>Apollo</hi> could never procure that Favour for a man's being skill'd in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, or for the mo<U+017F>t admired Theories, that were u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s, or little beneficial.</p>
            <p>And it is for this rea<U+017F>on that I can never enough admire the truly No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble De<U+017F>igns of our Royal Society, who do not lo<U+017F>e their time in unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frivolous Knots, and unfolding intricate Riddles: They take as large a pro<U+017F>pect into Univer<U+017F>al Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Dioptricks of Man's Weak Under<U+017F>tanding will give leave; and though the Subject of their Di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition <U+017F>eems <U+017F>ometimes low and mean, yet their end is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Noble and Great, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the advantages that can be de<U+017F>ired. I know giddy heads, and frothy <U+017F>pirits do often make
<pb facs="tcp:40248:6"/>
this Royal A<U+017F><U+017F>embly the <U+017F>port of their little Wits, and the mockery of <U+017F>uch as have as little under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as them<U+017F>elves; but they may know, that long after their poor hearts are quite knaw'd with Envy, and become the proper food of Worms, this Augu<U+017F>t Society will remain the Admiration of all Wi<U+017F>e men, and the Glory of this Nation.</p>
            <p>It is not a little Ob<U+017F>ervable, that the Ingenious Members of it have unanimou<U+017F>ly cho<U+017F>en to write their Works in Engli<U+017F>h; and though they conver<U+017F>e or corre<U+017F>pond with all parts of the World, yet they chu<U+017F>e to confine a little to us their va<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>coveries, and mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Improvements of Knowledg; which <U+017F>hews, they had rather do much real good at home, than make O<U+017F>tentation of Learning and gain Reputation abroad.</p>

            <p>I <U+017F>hall not endeavour to fore-<U+017F>tall you with any Collection of the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable Remarks of this
<pb facs="tcp:40248:10"/>
Book. A very little Patience will be able to conquer them all. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I <U+017F>hall take notice to you, that he makes the Pox to be as Ancient as Fornication and Adultery; that wanton men in the days of Old were the Fathers of it, and Harlotry its Mother, when and where<U+017F>oever Bea<U+017F>tline<U+017F>s and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanne<U+017F>s have much prevailed on the practice of men. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ion and Corruption of <U+017F>o pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance as is the Seed, is here <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to degenerate into <U+017F>o high a malignancy, when the Seed of many different per<U+017F>ons do meet together in the Womb, are there cheri<U+017F>hed by the natural heat, and at length exert their acttivities in this heterogeneous Fermentation<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and we may the ea<U+017F>ier conceive the truth of this, if we con<U+017F>ider what <U+017F>trange and di<U+017F>mall effects, how
<pb facs="tcp:40248:10"/>
numerous and dreadful Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es the Womb is often the Mother of, by Corruption of the Seed in one Woman alone; how much more exalted then mu<U+017F>t the putrefaction be, and the unhappy Parent of how degenerate an Off-<U+017F>pring, when the additional <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ions of many new Corruptions do <U+017F>till con<U+017F>pire to the <U+017F>ame end, and <U+017F>till contribute to a further Advancement!</p>
            <p>Now though this and <U+017F>everal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things here, are very prettily conceived, and have my entire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of them, yet I would by no means be thought implicitely to embrace what<U+017F>oever is here e<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli<U+017F>hed, or at random defend all the delights of his thoughts, the <U+017F>cattered productions of his, or any man's wandering Fancy. Every man hath his roving, as well as lucid intervals; and though they may
<pb facs="tcp:40248:11"/>
very often be in the right, yet they may <U+017F>ometimes be in the wrong too. We have all indeed our particular Talents, and it will be certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, how we have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or advanced them. It will not be enough for us <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>hly to <U+017F>ay, we have had <U+017F>uch or <U+017F>uch a Learned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter, and carefully laid up the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure he committed to our charge, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome improvement be made of it, or at lea<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hew our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make an encrea<U+017F>e. I am very confident, nothing in all the World hath ever put <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable a <U+017F>top to the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ive career, true Science would daily make, as a blind Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, and mean <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to the dictates of per<U+017F>ons we have a good opinion of. And for this rea<U+017F>on I cannot but commend, and admire the declared de<U+017F>igns of <U+017F>ome Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men among us; who, though
<pb facs="tcp:40248:11"/>
they do not tran<U+017F>act Wonders eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Month, and <U+017F>hew them<U+017F>elves Cho<U+017F>en Sons of Nature, yet <U+017F>ure they de<U+017F>erve good words at lea<U+017F>t, and that Petulancy, with which <U+017F>ome do daily nibble at them, might methinks be well <U+017F>pared. But to return again; as I do not profe<U+017F>s my <U+017F>elf a Di<U+017F>ciple of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in all things he is plea<U+017F>ed to utter; <U+017F>o I cannot but give him his due, and commend him much for his ingenious Attempts. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercury be of <U+017F>uch ab<U+017F>olute importance to the cure of this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e, when Fermented a while in the Blood, and grown a little invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as this Author would have it; or whether the Ceremony of omi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of a Flux in <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons of Quality, and e<U+017F>pecially Women, be not the True and Latent Cau<U+017F>e of their continual Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions, I
<pb facs="tcp:40248:12"/>
leave to every man to judge by his own Di<U+017F>cretion and Experience. For my part, as I do not a<U+017F><U+017F>ent to tho<U+017F>e who violently maintain, that nothing at all can be done without Mercury; <U+017F>o I much pity the poor Spirit of tho<U+017F>e who think of it as a Hobgoblin; and are as apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive of giving or receiving the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<U+017F>tration of it, as they would be of meeting a hungry Lyon. Men ought indeed to be Wonderful Cautious, how they pre<U+017F>ume to make u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>o <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; yet he hath <U+017F>een but little into the Nature of things, or is wholly involved in a popular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, who knows not, that Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ilver, as quick as it is, may be tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Art; and may <U+017F>ometimes, by Di<U+017F>creet Ma<U+017F>ters, be very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly employed to good purpo<U+017F>e. I know 'tis very hard to <U+017F>peak of this
<pb facs="tcp:40248:12"/>
<U+017F>ubject without being mi<U+017F>taken, on without being thought to have too great a kindne<U+017F>s for it, if one doth not utterly Declare War again<U+017F>t all who magnifie its effects: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s, I am <U+017F>ure all knowing men will interpret what I have now <U+017F>aid, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably enough.</p>
            <p>There's a famous Doctor in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> one of the King's Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of Phy<U+017F>ick, but one who can never hear <U+017F>peak of Mercury, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently reckoning up twenty Mortal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es it mu<U+017F>t needs be apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce: This per<U+017F>on hath told me, when I took occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>peak of the Salivation, that he hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Flux before <U+017F>ome Doctors of his Faculty, without the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, or u<U+017F>e of Mercury; and that he mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ingredients, and gave them the Patient faithfully before their faces. The truth of it is, I had <U+017F>o
<pb facs="tcp:40248:13"/>
little Faith in the po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of rai<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Flux, or at lea<U+017F>t a <U+017F>ufficient one, without Mercury; and had <U+017F>o much conde<U+017F>cention, as rather to <U+017F>ubmit with a complacent nod, than offer to di<U+017F>pute <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable, and perhaps beloved an a<U+017F><U+017F>everation, that I had not curio<U+017F>ity enough to enquire the manner how it could be done, though I know the per<U+017F>on to be the greate<U+017F>t enemy in the World to <U+017F>uch things as Secrets. But I am apt to believe, that tho<U+017F>e Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es he <U+017F>o zealou<U+017F>ly Fathers upon Mercury, do rather ari<U+017F>e from the indi<U+017F>creet u<U+017F>e of it, and gro<U+017F>s a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<U+017F>e that is ea<U+017F>ily made of <U+017F>o Active a Medicine; when Quacks or Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants boldly take it into their hands.</p>
            <p>What<U+017F>oever is the Nature, and how dangerous or beneficial <U+017F>oever are the effects of Mercury, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Author of the<U+017F>e Ob<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:40248:13"/>

If the French are able to begin well, &amp; lead the way with Courage, our Engli<U+017F>h, I am <U+017F>ure, can not only do the <U+017F>ame, but be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry u<U+017F>eful to them, in a brave pro<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of what they undertake. Let the French with their nimble Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ies <U+017F>tart, and Invent things <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; the <U+017F>olid Judgment of an Engli<U+017F>h man is required, to bring them to a due Perfection. As par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular per<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>o particular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have their peculiar Genius &amp; Abilities; we mu<U+017F>t, and ought to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t one another with our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications. One man's head is not big enough to comprehend, or <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently contain the va<U+017F>t extent of the Great, or Infinite Curio<U+017F>ities of
<pb facs="tcp:40248:14"/>
the Little World. And the nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity of this mutual corre<U+017F>pondence, and free intelligence among men, e<U+017F>pecially of different Countreys, (whereby Envy and Jealou<U+017F>ie are not able to breed the Poy<U+017F>on, they u<U+017F>ually do upon the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>pot) puts me in mind of tho<U+017F>e Advantages a Traveller may therefore meet with in Forreign Countreys, more than the Natives them<U+017F>elves are capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to enjoy. For if he be not too raw and young, he <U+017F>hall ea<U+017F>ily gain admittance into the Clo<U+017F>ets of their mo<U+017F>t Ingenious men: all the Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they pretend to, and Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have made, will be di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by them, 'tis doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with more Ambition, of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40248:18"/>
All Nations that have <U+017F>marted under it have reciprocally endeavour'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach one another with its Origine, or at lea<U+017F>t with its Communication; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in particular hath be<U+017F>towed the Name of it on that which was e<U+017F>teemed an u<U+017F>ual enemy. Whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s that our Europeans have been plea<U+017F>ed to call it American, Spani<U+017F>h, Neapolitan, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian, and French. Good men have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it the Name of the <hi>Shameful Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e,</hi> to render it the more odious unto all, or becau<U+017F>e it hath really <U+017F>omewhat infamous in it, and is the mark as well as the fruit of Debauchery and lubricity. The Poets have given it the Name of <hi>Siphilis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e they have pretended a Shepherd of that Name was fir<U+017F>t infected with it. But it is now generally known in this part of the World under the Names of the <hi>Venereal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e,</hi> or the <hi>Pox,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on that the parts which are <U+017F>ubmitted to the influences of <hi>Venus</hi> have heretofore <U+017F>erved for its Origine, and do now more often than any others <U+017F>erve for its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; and becau<U+017F>e it very often produces <U+017F>pots and pu<U+017F>tules on the skin, which are commonly <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be like tho<U+017F>e of the Small Pox, though in good
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40248:18"/>
truth they have no <U+017F>imilitude at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But if there appears <U+017F>uch difficulty in giving it a proper Name that may be univer<U+017F>ally received, it will prove much more difficult to define it with all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary circum<U+017F>tances to a regular Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by rea<U+017F>on it is <U+017F>o obvious to remark in its form almo<U+017F>t all the kinds of Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es that Phy<U+017F>icians u<U+017F>e to <U+017F>peak of; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed becau<U+017F>e all the Accidents it produces are not able to furni<U+017F>h us with one E<U+017F><U+017F>ential Difference, they re<U+017F>embling many others which neverthele<U+017F>s have Cau<U+017F>es very different from that of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. Wherefore the Definition that you'l here meet with is properly one of tho<U+017F>e that may be called <U+017F>imply Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or a De<U+017F>cription.</p>
                  <p>The Pox is a contagious Di<U+017F>temper occa<U+017F>ioned by Contact, and by means of a Venemous Salt, proceeding from the mixture and corruption of the Seeds of divers per<U+017F>ons, received and contained in the wombs of publick Women; by which all the liquid <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances wherein it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes do thicken and corrupt the nerves, skin, and in general the fle<U+017F>h to which it adheres, become prickt, gnaw'd, and dry; la<U+017F>tly the bones and cartilages that it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40248:19"/>
penetrates, do ri<U+017F>e up, rot, and corrupt.</p>
                  <p>Some will perhaps <U+017F>ay, that it might have been more exactly defined by a more comprehen<U+017F>ive <hi>Genus</hi> than Di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <U+017F>ince the <U+017F>olution of Continuity, and a bad Conformation do accompany it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t at all times; nay and that of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction again<U+017F>t Nature, which I might have cho<U+017F>en too, may <U+017F>eem to do better, but indeed would not have determined it <U+017F>o preci<U+017F>ely. For Di<U+017F>temper is ab<U+017F>olutely E<U+017F><U+017F>ential to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, whereas divers Examples may be given, which do prove it may <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t without <U+017F>olution of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, or a bad Conformation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently they ought not to be con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but as <U+017F>eparable Accidents.</p>
                  <p>Now though this Definition be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long one, yet there is but little need of any ample explication. For though I do remark, for example, that the Pox is contagious by Contact, there is no nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity of troubling you with the proof of this Truth, becau<U+017F>e it is <U+017F>ufficiently known to Phy<U+017F>icians, and the mo<U+017F>t part of other Men; Again it may be ea<U+017F>ily remarked that the Venereal Matter is a Venemous Salt, only by making <U+017F>ome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the effects which do re<U+017F>ult
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40248:19"/>

Pox is almo<U+017F>t as ancient as the World, and that its Origine ought to be drawn from the Impurity of the fir<U+017F>t Ages, in which it was but little le<U+017F>s common than in the pre<U+017F>ent times we live in; <U+017F>ince the mo<U+017F>t ancient Phy<U+017F>icians have <U+017F>poken of all the Accidens that it produces, as well as other Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions that were then common &amp; familiar, and that they have known them as well as wee, under the Names of Heat of Urine, Gonorrheas, Virulent Ulcers, impure Buboes, dry Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tules, Tetters, Warts, and la<U+017F>tly Nodes, and rottenne<U+017F>s of the Bones.</p>
                  <p>We may al<U+017F>o conceive that the <U+017F>ettled inveterate Lepro<U+017F>ie, which they <U+017F>peak of as a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e very rare and incurable, was what we now call Lepro<U+017F>ie, and that the other <U+017F>pecies of <U+017F>imple Lepro<U+017F>ies, which they have mentioned as very common, were the different impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions that Venereal Salts made upon the skin; <U+017F>ince they were accompanied with the greate<U+017F>t part of the other Accidents of the Pox, and that they were cured by the application of Mercurial Oyntments, which we now make u<U+017F>e of to anoint and cure tho<U+017F>e that are infected with the Pox.</p>

Nay <U+017F>ome Authors <U+017F>eem to <U+017F>train them<U+017F>elves to divide things that appear indivi<U+017F>ible.

An Example of this truth may be <U+017F>een in the greate<U+017F>t part of young Students, who often employ a con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time to learn things that are either unu<U+017F>eful, or of which they are not able to give any rea<U+017F>on, whether it be that they do not under<U+017F>tand them, or that they are really inconceiveable, and tho<U+017F>e who write of them have not been able them<U+017F>elves to conceive them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But that we may not fall into the like inconvenience, and to enlighten the matter I treat of, as much as it is capable,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40248:22"/>
I <U+017F>hall con<U+017F>ider but only two Cau<U+017F>es of the Pox; to wit, that of its Generation, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the Mixture and Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Seeds of divers per<U+017F>ons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and retained in the <U+017F>ame Womb; And that of its Communication, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in the contact of impure Per<U+017F>ons.</p>
                  <p>It is <U+017F>o much the more nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to prove the po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of the former, as it is a new Opinion, that will con<U+017F>equently be pretended fal<U+017F>e by tho<U+017F>e who admit no Novelties at all: And I fear al<U+017F>o that Rea<U+017F>on and Experience do not furni<U+017F>h us with proofs clear enough, to di<U+017F>cover this truth before the eyes of Opiniators, that love rather to follow blindly what they conceive through prejudice, than take the pains to examine things, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h rightly the true from the fal<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>'Tis after this manner I rea<U+017F>on on this Subject. Philo<U+017F>ophers, and generally the Learned, do acknowledge no con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able change in Nature, that is not made by a fermentation; of which no cau<U+017F>e is found more evident than the motion and action of contrary Bodies: An Example of this truth, which may particularly <U+017F>erve for a proof of my Opinion, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved in the Generation of perfect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40248:23"/>
and principally in that of Man; for the Seeds of which he is generated do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not only the Idea and Form of all the parts, but al<U+017F>o the good and ill Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, the Temperaments, and Natural Inclinations of tho<U+017F>e from whom they are emitted; and this is <U+017F>o true, that the particles which convey the<U+017F>e powers, act one upon the other, after the Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; and that Infants of the <U+017F>ame Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are <U+017F>ometimes Male, <U+017F>ometimes Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, now like Father, another time like the Mother, and often partly like one, and partly like the other.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be true to <U+017F>ay, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent qualities which are found in the Seeds of only two per<U+017F>ons may be agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderably, as to cau<U+017F>e one to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rule the other, while<U+017F>t they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Womb, for Generation; that of a third per<U+017F>on, which is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a little afterwards, may be lookt upon as a matter extraordinary, which mu<U+017F>t hinder Generation, or at lea<U+017F>t ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it imperfect, by a more unequal mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <U+017F>tronger agitation; this <U+017F>erves to per<U+017F>wade me that Moles in Women may be as well the effects of Cuckolding, or Adultery as the production of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;

<U+017F>ince it is known be<U+017F>ides, that the be<U+017F>t Anatomi<U+017F>ts do e<U+017F>teem great quantity of Men<U+017F>trual Blood (which is notwith<U+017F>tanding another principle of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration) for one cau<U+017F>e of this confu<U+017F>ion and di<U+017F>order: To which may be added, that it is by rea<U+017F>on of this Confu<U+017F>ion that common Strumpets never conceive at all, though they often do the <U+017F>ame with tho<U+017F>e that have Children, &amp; perhaps al<U+017F>o with more advantageous circum<U+017F>tances; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the different Seeds that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, do cau<U+017F>e a more vehement and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular fermentation, as they come from abundance of per<U+017F>ons, and are filled with a great many contrary and oppo<U+017F>ite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; from which fermentation there mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equently proceed a very bad change, and further from Perfection, to which Nature doth always tend. On this <U+017F>ubject it may further be ob<U+017F>erved, that Corruption is the change, which follows fermentations that are ab<U+017F>olutely again<U+017F>t Nature; and it is ea<U+017F>ily to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how tho<U+017F>e Seeds being mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, may pa<U+017F>s from their fermentation to corruption, almo<U+017F>t at one and the <U+017F>ame time, <U+017F>ince this mixture doth render them improper for their Natural U<U+017F>e, and that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40248:24"/>
the heat and moi<U+017F>ture of the part which contains them, do quickly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e them to be corrupted. Now the mo<U+017F>t impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant thing that remains on this <U+017F>ubject, is to let you <U+017F>ee, how they can become Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous, that is to <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>ubtile, penetrant, and proper to coagulate and corrupt the Blood, as other Poi<U+017F>ons do. But as the Seed is generally acknowledged for the be<U+017F>t part of our Blood, and every body knows, that Corruption is <U+017F>o much the wor<U+017F>e, as the matters corrupted were more pure and delicate before; It <U+017F>eems that this truth is <U+017F>ufficiently proved of it <U+017F>elf, and that there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of <U+017F>earching Rea<U+017F>ons more <U+017F>trong or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain it. Neverthele<U+017F>s if we reflect on the great <U+017F>tore of Spirits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the Seed is filled, and on the quality of the Part that receives them; we <U+017F>hall then <U+017F>ee that there is no matter which can remain more Spirituous, and con<U+017F>equently more Venomous after its Corruption; becau<U+017F>e there is none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <U+017F>tor'd with Spirits, nor any more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently pre<U+017F>erved; this change being made in the Womb, which is a part Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to receive the Seed, and con<U+017F>erve all the parts of it: And what is

<U+017F>till ob<U+017F>ervable, is that in pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing from its Natural <U+017F>ubject into other <U+017F>ubjects, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <U+017F>o much the more Venemous, as it hath pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed a greater number of new Fermentations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Furthermore, we may <U+017F>ay of this Opinion, that it is one of tho<U+017F>e that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well, be proved by any other way but our Rea<U+017F>on, and that it is almo<U+017F>t im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to find <U+017F>ubjects, on which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>ure and undoubted may be made; for be<U+017F>ides that the Pox doth not always appear, and that there are but few per<U+017F>ons who may be believed ab<U+017F>olutely pure and clear from it, there mu<U+017F>t therefore remain but few indeed who can be e<U+017F>teemed proper for <U+017F>uch an Experiment.

Cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e it is by them principally gained.</p>
                  <p>But we mu<U+017F>t not imagine that this <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cau<U+017F>e is always found in Coition, as the fir<U+017F>t; it matters not after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Contact is made, provided that it permits an adhe<U+017F>ion or entrance to <U+017F>ome part of the Venereal matter; it may be made either directly or indirectly, and here's an Example of it: A Woman with Child, who in the Company of one that hath the Pox, <U+017F>hall attract into her Womb, the corrupted Seed that <U+017F>hall be there ejaculated, will catch the Pox im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, by rea<U+017F>on of the Coition and Contact that preceded; and the Infant that <U+017F>hall be in her Womb, will be al<U+017F>o infected with it, by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>ame Coition, but not by rea<U+017F>on of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, becau<U+017F>e the remotene<U+017F>s of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant hinder'd the Infection from being direct in re<U+017F>pect of it. The <U+017F>ame thing may be <U+017F>aid of Infants that are engender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of divers like Seeds, according to the ordinary cour<U+017F>e of Nature, or by way of Superfetation.</p>
                  <p>Be<U+017F>ides the Example that I ju<U+017F>t now gave, many other <U+017F>orts of Contacts may be found, which are made by other ways,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40248:26"/>
and yet fail not to cau<U+017F>e the Pox: For Example, if one <U+017F>hould happen to drink after him that hath the Pox, and by chance put the Lips to the <U+017F>ame place of the Gla<U+017F>s, where <U+017F>ome little Poi<U+017F>on of the Ulcers of his mouth, or el<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome of his <U+017F>pittle fill'd with Venereal Salts, <U+017F>hall have <U+017F>tuck; it often happens, that this either cau<U+017F>es other Ulcers, by <U+017F>uperficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhering to the parts, or el<U+017F>e without delay the univer<U+017F>al Pox; when the Salt that they contain is volatil and penetrant enough to enter into the Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, without leaving any marks of its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age; for let ever <U+017F>o little of it be once mixt with the Blood, it will work like Leaven in a great deal of Dough, or rather it ferments and corrupts as other Poi<U+017F>ons do, which are always more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious by their quality, than by their quantity.</p>
                  <p>Another Example of this nature may be drawn from tho<U+017F>e who are infected with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, for having unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lain in the <U+017F>heets, wherein one in the Pox had <U+017F>weated, or in which there might remain <U+017F>ome of the matter that run from his Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>Be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e <U+017F>orts of Contact, all others

may be <U+017F>aid to be immediate, becau<U+017F>e they are made by the application of one part again<U+017F>t another: Among them all the mo<U+017F>t ordinary is Coition, becau<U+017F>e this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e doth for the mo<U+017F>t part begin in the parts that <U+017F>erve for Generation, and its matter is not always di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ally through the Body: In this action, if a Man hath Venereal Ulcers on his Yard, <U+017F>ome part of the Poi<U+017F>on that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hes them, and which is nothing el<U+017F>e but a di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of the Salts that con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the Pox, doth almo<U+017F>t always <U+017F>tick in <U+017F>ome part of the Womb, or el<U+017F>e in the wrinkles of the neck of her Womb, that he lies with, wherein he often cau<U+017F>es o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ulcers, by adhering to the skin, or <hi>pellicules</hi> that cover tho<U+017F>e parts; on which matter it may be ob<U+017F>erved, that I have ju<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on to add this la<U+017F>t circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, by rea<U+017F>on that this matter doth not always nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily adhere in Women, either becau<U+017F>e the Membrane that covers the <hi>Vagina,</hi> is very <U+017F>mooth, poli<U+017F>hed, and cover'd with a <U+017F>limy Humour, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the Seed that is therein ejaculated doth often <U+017F>lide out at the <U+017F>ame time, and carries away with it this Virulent matter <U+017F>o much the more ea<U+017F>ily, as it hath not

had time to adhere, and as the <U+017F>cituation and form of this part do much contribute to its ea<U+017F>ier <U+017F>liding out; it is al<U+017F>o for this rea<U+017F>on that common Strumpets do <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give hurt to others, though they have none at all them<U+017F>elves; becau<U+017F>e the approaching them a little after they have enjoyed the Company of other men that are impure, doth give <U+017F>ome part of the impurity they received, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves may be exempt from any adhe<U+017F>ion, or effect of the remaining matter, by the means that I have mentioned.</p>
                  <p>It is ob<U+017F>ervable that a virulent Clap, and the univer<U+017F>al Pox are able equally to render the Seed impure; in <U+017F>o much that if that of a Man who is infected with it, be attracted and retained in the Womb of a Woman, it may cau<U+017F>e in her either a Virulent Clap by adhering particularly to the <U+017F>permatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, or el<U+017F>e the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>al Pox, by pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifices of the Arteries and Veins, that terminate in this part.

                  <p>It is al<U+017F>o ob<U+017F>erveable, that the Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40248:28"/>
of the Mouth of a little Infant that hath the Pox are able to infect the Nur<U+017F>e, by adhering to her Teats, or el<U+017F>e the air of his Re<U+017F>piration, that can ea<U+017F>ily pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate them through the pores that give pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the Milk. In like manner an infected Nur<U+017F>e can impart her Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e to the little One, by an adhe<U+017F>ion of the matter of her Ulcers, or by the u<U+017F>e of the corrupted Milk that is <U+017F>uckt from her Teats.</p>
                  <p>To ly with one that hath the Pox, and touch him naked while he <U+017F>weats, or when he hath Ulcers and Pu<U+017F>tules on his skin, is a thing that may well be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very dangerous, and chiefly for tho<U+017F>e that have their pores very open, and therefore do ea<U+017F>ily receive the impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of any thing that touches them.

                  <p n="1">1. BEfore I come to <U+017F>peak of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Pox, it is good to acquaint you, that I do not conceive any different Species of it, nor own any Sanguine, Cholerick, Phlegmatick, and Melancholick ones, as <U+017F>ome Men have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>iderately
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40248:29"/>
done; but on the contrary do always e<U+017F>teem it as the <U+017F>ame, in what degree, and what<U+017F>oever <U+017F>ubject it may be found, <U+017F>ince it is always produced by one and the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>e, that always acts after the <U+017F>ame manner, and produces different Effects according to the various di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the parts that receive its action.</p>
                  <p>This being once pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, you will ea<U+017F>ily grant, that the differences of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e can only be drawn from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ity of its degrees; that is to <U+017F>ay, from the time that its matter hath been receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the progre<U+017F>s that it hath made, and from the Accidents that it produces.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though I con<U+017F>ider the time that the Venereal matter hath been received, for one degree, from whence <U+017F>ome differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Pox may be drawn; and that <U+017F>ome Authors do think to a<U+017F>certain the Progno<U+017F>tick of it, by the con<U+017F>equences they thence draw; yet it mu<U+017F>t be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that they are of no great con<U+017F>ideration. For though it may be <U+017F>aid that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is either New or Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, according to the more or le<U+017F>s time it hath been contracted, yet one cannot judge for all that of the ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40248:29"/>
or impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of its Cure: becau<U+017F>e this <U+017F>ame matter is more or le<U+017F>s active according to its quality or quantity, or el<U+017F>e according to the particular di<U+017F>po<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Bodies, in which it enters. For 'tis certain, as I have already ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it becomes more Venemous, &amp; con<U+017F>equently more penetrant &amp; <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, when it hath had duration in the change that may be made of it from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <U+017F>ubjects; and the great quantity of it doth very much advance the di<U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is able to make, in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar per<U+017F>on. To which may be added, that it acts the more <U+017F>uddenly, when it is excited by the heat that is found in the Temperaments of Cholerick or Sanguine Bodies, which are <U+017F>o much the more di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>uffer its in<U+017F>inuation, as their pores and other pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages are naturally more open; but on the contrary it is <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o fixt, and <U+017F>hut up in the cold, or gro<U+017F>s Humours of Phlegmatick or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick per<U+017F>ons, that it can lye there a long time like fire under a<U+017F>hes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience lets us <U+017F>ee, that it can lurk 10 or 12 years, before any effects of its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be felt; whence it follows, that the Judgment of the three Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40248:30"/>
I related, do chiefly depend on the examination that ought to be made, on the progre<U+017F>s it hath already made, and the accidents it hath produced. For by the con<U+017F>ideration of the fir<U+017F>t circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, the Particular or Univer<U+017F>al Pox may be judged of: and this di<U+017F>tinction is of <U+017F>uch importance to the right pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gno<U+017F>tick of the ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, or difficulty of its Cure, that it lets us <U+017F>ee, in what degrees particular or common remedies may <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or whether the <U+017F>tronger and more general are al<U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary.</p>

Before we pa<U+017F>s further, it <U+017F>eems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper to explicate what I mean by this Difference, that I may let you <U+017F>ee how it doth not <U+017F>erve only to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the degrees of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and that it is not any way contrary to what I <U+017F>aid of it at the beginning of this Chapter.

This man came to con<U+017F>ult me upon the account of <U+017F>everal hard Pu<U+017F>tules, that grew over all his skin; Upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion I made all the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary remarks on his pa<U+017F>t Life, his Temperament, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent condition of his per<U+017F>on, his Wife and Children; and by this examination I knew it was nothing el<U+017F>e but what Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians call, the Gnawing or Corro<U+017F>ive Herpes, and I therefore propo<U+017F>ed to him the u<U+017F>e of a Bath, and other Remedies both general and particular, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <U+017F>erve for the cure of this Di<U+017F>temper. But becau<U+017F>e he was afraid he had the Pox, and people often think they have the misfortunes they are afraid of, he <U+017F>till continued in the apprehen<U+017F>ion he was in before, and came to de<U+017F>ire me <U+017F>ome few days afterwards to conduct him to <U+017F>ome famous Practitioner, to <U+017F>ee whether he

would joyn his Opinion with mine, that <U+017F>o he might be better a<U+017F><U+017F>ured what to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve of it. To this end I waited on him to a certain per<U+017F>on, whom a fair <U+017F>how of <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hone<U+017F>ty, <U+017F>tore of Riches, and a good Reputation of being an Able man, have a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly placed above the common Rank, but was guilty neverthele<U+017F>s on this occa<U+017F>ion of an action altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of tho<U+017F>e good qualities; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving lea<U+017F>ure to the Patient, or my <U+017F>elf, to relate tho<U+017F>e things that the <U+017F>ight cannot di<U+017F>cover, without making any examination at all, and only after a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate in<U+017F>pection of the<U+017F>e Pu<U+017F>tules, he told him it was a very fine <U+017F>ort of Pox, and therefore he had be<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve for a retreat of <U+017F>ix weeks.</p>
                  <p>This new way of judging of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, will <U+017F>urely very much <U+017F>urprize all tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hall make <U+017F>ome reflections on the difficulty there is of knowing them, and chiefly tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es who<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es are ab<U+017F>conded in the <U+017F>ecret internal parts, <U+017F>uch as is the univer<U+017F>al Pox; <U+017F>ince the difficulty of knowing them is <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>o great, that the mo<U+017F>t expert, profound, and mo<U+017F>t knowing Phy<U+017F>icians, do happen to be mi<U+017F>taken, in taking one for another;

But be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, it mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o be remarked by the by, that tho<U+017F>e words of <hi>Fine Pox,</hi> do <U+017F>how at the <U+017F>ame time both the ignorance, and quacking of tho<U+017F>e who make u<U+017F>e of them: But after all, this <U+017F>ame Patient was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle afterwards comforted again by one that proved more hone<U+017F>t, who after an ample knowledge of the circum<U+017F>tances I related, gave the <U+017F>ame Name to this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e that I had done before, and <U+017F>o ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ed him to tho<U+017F>e Remedies that I had propo<U+017F>ed to him, by the u<U+017F>e of which Remedies he was quite cured in a <U+017F>hort time. Moreover it may be <U+017F>aid, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t was the <U+017F>ole Motive of this treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous dealing; for there is no likelihood that the ambition of appearing a great Doctor, <U+017F>hould have been the cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince he might have appeared <U+017F>o much more by rea<U+017F>oning on the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing <U+017F>uch fine words.

the hopes of receiving equal ones again, and we two were not of Intelligence enough for that. Therefore it is much more likely, he thought with him<U+017F>elf that I de<U+017F>ired to put this per<U+017F>on under his hands, for <U+017F>ome particular con<U+017F>ideration, and <U+017F>o he might have no other thought but of embracing the occa<U+017F>ion offered.</p>

The ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s they have found in per<U+017F>wading men <U+017F>o, hath given them encouragement for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <U+017F>ort of cheating: They cau<U+017F>e Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets to be di<U+017F>tributed in mo<U+017F>t parts of the Town, and clap up papers in the mo<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>orted places, nay and <U+017F>ometimes pre<U+017F>ume to write little Pamphlets, filled with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but follies and lyes, wherein they confidently boa<U+017F>t that they are able to cure the Pox, without Mercury, without garde, or keeping their Chamber; and they have <U+017F>o much the more ea<U+017F>ily found per<U+017F>ons who will believe them, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Impo<U+017F>ture <U+017F>omewhat likely by

                  <p>The former are the impure Contacts that have preceded this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, the

                  <p n="4">4. It may with Rea<U+017F>on be <U+017F>aid, that the Ulcers which are cau<U+017F>ed by impure Contacts, do con<U+017F>titute the fir<U+017F>t degree of the Pox, becau<U+017F>e they are the effect of <U+017F>ome matter that very <U+017F>uperficially ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres; they cannot be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from ordinary Ulcers at their beginning, but by the preceding Contact, and the parts in which they happen; and they may be cured in this condition with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary De<U+017F>iccatives. But when the Salts that cau<U+017F>ed them, cannot be de<U+017F>troyed by the<U+017F>e or other means,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40248:39"/>
they then penetrate into the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that contain the blood, or el<U+017F>e mix with the Natural moi<U+017F>ture that remains in the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer'd part, and fix it in <U+017F>uch manner, that from Ulcers they degenerate into Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres; and then indeed they are much more dangerous and hard to cure, but are known by the elevation of their white <U+017F>ides, by their ob<U+017F>cure colour, and by their hardne<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>You may ea<U+017F>ily judge that Claps, or Virulent Gonorrheas, are of a yet higher degree than the Ulcers I now <U+017F>poke of; becau<U+017F>e the matter that makes them is more deeply driven into the bodies of tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>uffer them, and the parts that are infected with them are <U+017F>uch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and concealed: The Bladder, for Example, and the parts adjacent or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on it, are the fir<U+017F>t that <U+017F>uffer the Inflammation, which is <U+017F>ufficiently known by the heat and pains that are felt in urining, and <U+017F>ometimes by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Urine; the <U+017F>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts, and the Seed it <U+017F>elf are not more free from an Alteration, <U+017F>ince the lo<U+017F>s, thickne<U+017F>s, &amp; corruption of the Seed, are undoubted marks of it. La<U+017F>tly the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages through which the<U+017F>e Impurities
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40248:39"/>
are carried do not long remain free from their ill effects, but become exulcerated by the <U+017F>harp points of the Salts they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and this exulceration doth cau<U+017F>e them to <U+017F>uffer very grievous pains, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of their Urine.</p>
                  <p>While this particular Pox is but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contracted, it can be cured with a great deal of ea<U+017F>e and <U+017F>afety, by prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which we ought otherwi<U+017F>e to fear, and taking away what<U+017F>oever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by the u<U+017F>e and application of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies to this effect. But when it hath had a con<U+017F>iderable duration without nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary <U+017F>uccour, it mu<U+017F>t be then believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of a much more difficult and dangerous Cure, becau<U+017F>e all its Accidents become greater, and the further pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration if its matter, that is, the univer<U+017F>al Pox, may be then with ju<U+017F>t Rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pected. Therefore it mu<U+017F>t then be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more care and precaution, and the Progno<U+017F>tick that is made of it mu<U+017F>t be more doubtful.</p>
                  <p>We may now ob<U+017F>erve that the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Salts do often pa<U+017F>s from the parts I <U+017F>poke of into the orifices of the Veins and Arteries, and do <U+017F>ometimes penetrate more directly by the <U+017F>ubtilty &amp; keenne<U+017F>s
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40248:40"/>
of their points. Neverthele<U+017F>s what way <U+017F>oever they enter, it is always true, that they cau<U+017F>e in <U+017F>ome a great ebullition of their blood, either by the particular di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>itions they find in it, or el<U+017F>e by their own deleterious quality; during which ebullition, the Impurities do <U+017F>eparate, much after the <U+017F>ame manner as Lees do in the fermentation of Wine, and <U+017F>o are driven out after a while by the force of Nature, or, if you will <U+017F>o, by the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Expultrive into the Glandules of the Groins, where it cau<U+017F>es a Bubo, or Botch, that <U+017F>erves for a <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> of the Pox, if it be attracted and brought to perfect Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>It may be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from other Tumours, that <U+017F>ometimes happen in tho<U+017F>e parts, by the impure Contact that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded it, by the Claps, Gonorrheas, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Chancres, that often happen a little before its di<U+017F>covery, but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by its <U+017F>low advancement, its durity, and large Ba<U+017F>is.</p>
                  <p>But this penetration of the Venereal matter into the ma<U+017F>s of the blood, is not always attended with <U+017F>o happy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s as the extru<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>uch a Tumour: the Venereal Salts do <U+017F>ometimes participate
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40248:40"/>
more of fixt than volatile, and the blood is not equally hot and <U+017F>ubtile in all <U+017F>orts of men, <U+017F>o that in <U+017F>ome it pre<U+017F>ently coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates by this means, much after the <U+017F>ame manner as <U+017F>ome curious per<U+017F>ons have experimented, by <U+017F>yringing Acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours into the Veins of Brutes; and this coagulation is often the Cau<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ions I took notice of, and of their loathing all Meat, a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> of their indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as to Coition, becau<U+017F>e whil'<U+017F>t it continues, the Circulation grows very <U+017F>low, and con<U+017F>equently the Natural Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that depend on it, become inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Wherefore this time may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved for another degree of the Pox, that can neverthele<U+017F>s be clearly carried off, by the inward Sudori<U+017F>icks, which do di<U+017F><U+017F>olve and attenuate the blood, by new ebullitions, provided that Nature be al<U+017F>o a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in her other evacuations.</p>
                  <p>At the time that this coagulation of the blood cea<U+017F>es, by the <U+017F>eparation of the different particles it then contains, we may con<U+017F>ider the beginning of its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, which is performed <U+017F>o much the more gently, and by degrees, as it met before with Ob<U+017F>tacles to hinder it; whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s that this blood
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40248:41"/>
doth but only ri<U+017F>e and boil by little and little, though indeed this gentle ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fails not neverthele<U+017F>s to cau<U+017F>e Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes very much different from tho<U+017F>e I have already <U+017F>poken of, and <U+017F>uch as I <U+017F>hall remark hereafter. For whil'<U+017F>t it la<U+017F>ts, light vapours ari<U+017F>e from it, that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all over the body, and do cau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e inquietudes of mind, and body, tho<U+017F>e Itchings of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Wherefore this time may be al<U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idered as another degree of the Pox, wherein neverthele<U+017F>s it may be ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, as well as in the former, by a good u<U+017F>e of ordinary Remedies, or el<U+017F>e by a Critical Motion of <U+017F>ome other Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e <U+017F>upervening. But as the<U+017F>e means do fail <U+017F>ometimes of the de<U+017F>ired effects, it were much better in this condition to provoke a light Salivation, by which a quick, ea<U+017F>ie, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ured Cure may be hoped for.</p>
                  <p>When the fermentation encrea<U+017F>es, or that it is in its height, the Venemous <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<U+017F>ities do <U+017F>eparate from the blood, and pa<U+017F>s <hi>á travers</hi> the coats of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that contain it, after which they <U+017F>lide along, the Nerves and Membranes, and cau<U+017F>e
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40248:41"/>
tho<U+017F>e wandring pains that are felt now in one part, and now in another; <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times al<U+017F>o Nature <U+017F>trives to drive them forth through the pores; but as the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ero<U+017F>ities are heavy and full of Salts, they adhere to the skin in<U+017F>tead of going forth, and there cau<U+017F>e Ulcers when they are mixt with <U+017F>ome corrupted matter; or if on the contrary they are chiefly charged with fixt Salts, they there rai<U+017F>e pu<U+017F>tules, that are flat, <U+017F>caly, dry, and of a red drawing towards an Orange colour; or el<U+017F>e if they are fill'd with volatil Salts, they ri<U+017F>e <U+017F>omewhat higher, and produce hard Tetters and Warts upon the Yards, privities of Women, the Groin, and other places.</p>
                  <p>This degree of the Pox is not the mo<U+017F>t difficult of all to be cured, but it is known very well by experience that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Mercury among Remedies that is able to excite the <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> that can termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it.</p>
                  <p>Oftentimes after the<U+017F>e matters have been thus wandring about the body, they altogether adhere and ab<U+017F>olutely <U+017F>tay in <U+017F>ome parts, and cau<U+017F>e by this means the la<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t terrible degree of the Pox. For though their adhe<U+017F>ion doth <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40248:42"/>
happen only in the Mu<U+017F>cles and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riostium,</hi> they fail not to cau<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Accidents, becau<U+017F>e by prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gnawing, and continually drying the nervous Fibres of the<U+017F>e parts, they there produce tho<U+017F>e fixt and nocturual pains, <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons have found in<U+017F>upportable. The Cartilages, and e<U+017F>pecially the bones, are al<U+017F>o other parts that <U+017F>uffer great changes by their penetration; for they cau<U+017F>e a <U+017F>ort of fermentation in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or Juyce they contain, by the means of which Tumours are <U+017F>een to happen, that are called <hi>Nodes,</hi> and which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el<U+017F>e but an elevation of their very <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, that is at la<U+017F>t rotted and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the pre<U+017F>ence and action of the<U+017F>e Impurities.</p>
                  <p>Neverthele<U+017F>s though the Pox is very hard to cure, when its matter is thus <U+017F>topt, and <U+017F>unk into the parts I named, it may be ob<U+017F>erved that it would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways curable even in this degree, if this <U+017F>ame matter were not <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>tuck to parts that are <U+017F>till more con<U+017F>iderable. But it hath been unhappily proved in <U+017F>ome Men, that the parts which are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Noble, and tho<U+017F>e that immediately admini<U+017F>ter to the Noble ones have not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40248:42"/>
been exempt from its activity and cruel effects. Wherefore the Progno<U+017F>tick that may be made of it, is <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it always con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in judging the extraordinary difficulty, or el<U+017F>e impo<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Cure.</p>
                  <p>But be<U+017F>ides the general Con<U+017F>iderations that I have marked, for making a good Progno<U+017F>tick of the Pox in, all its degrees, there mu<U+017F>t be re<U+017F>pect had to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circum<U+017F>tances of each <U+017F>ubject, as, for example, to the Temperament, Sex, Age, Strength, and al<U+017F>o Employment of him we pretend to cure. For I have known by Experience that the inquietudes which important affairs do give <U+017F>ome men, do heat and inflame the Spirits, and thereby cau<U+017F>e the Mercury to enter into the Brain, where it finally cau<U+017F>es mo<U+017F>t deplorable Accidents.</p>

nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the under<U+017F>tanding tho<U+017F>e that more particularly relate to the Art of curing the Pox: It is now time to <U+017F>peak of its Remedies, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances that mu<U+017F>t be ob<U+017F>erved for the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing them well and without danger.

                  <p>But to the end we may avoid u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s Repetitions, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay nothing more in general of particular Poxes, nor of the Rea<U+017F>ons for which I have <U+017F>o named them, becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e things have been already <U+017F>ufficiently explicated, when I <U+017F>poke of the Differences and Signs, which may <U+017F>erve for the Knowledge and Progno<U+017F>tick of all the degrees of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.

                  <p n="2">2. The fir<U+017F>t are the Ulcers and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, which are cau<U+017F>ed by a light and <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial adhe<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ome matter, that hath not penetrated more inwardly. I add this di<U+017F>tinction, becau<U+017F>e I do not now intend to <U+017F>peak of tho<U+017F>e that are made in the Ureter, by the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of Virulent matter in Claps or Gonorrheas; nor of <U+017F>uch as are the Symptomes of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al Pox, <U+017F>ince the manner of treating them is much different, and that they do depend on other degrees.</p>
                  <p>This particular Pox is nothing el<U+017F>e in the beginning, but the ruption or dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration of the <U+017F>uperficial Fibres of the skin, or <hi>pellicules</hi> that cover the parts to which the matter doth adhere; <U+017F>o that no other Name mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equently be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it, than that of Venereal Ulcers: e<U+017F>pecially if we will not do like Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants or Impo<U+017F>tors, who make the <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t Excoriations pa<U+017F>s for Chancres of a mo<U+017F>t difficult cure, and they do not indeed cure them, but with a great deal of pains and time, becau<U+017F>e they dre<U+017F>s them with cau<U+017F>tick burning Medicines, which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40248:44"/>
make them become very painful, hard, and apt to <U+017F>uppurate, though oftentimes the gentle<U+017F>t de<U+017F>iccatives are <U+017F>ufficient to cure them in three or four days.</p>
                  <p>The<U+017F>e Ulcers may indeed happen in all parts of the body, becau<U+017F>e they are all capable of an impure Contact, but the more tender and delicate ones are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject to them, by rea<U+017F>on that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Salts do more ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>tick in their <U+017F>u<U+017F>ceptible <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that the Yards in Men, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities in Women, the Teats in Nur<U+017F>es, and the Mouth in Infants, are the parts which are mo<U+017F>t commonly infected with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which ought to be done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Cure while they are in this condition, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts principally in drying them up like other Ulcers, only regard mu<U+017F>t be had to the matter that cau<U+017F>es them, and proper De<U+017F>iccatives employed for breaking the points of the Salts they contain, and to oppo<U+017F>e their penetration, which is <U+017F>o much the rather to be feared, as it is done in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly.</p>
                  <p>The following Liquours will very well an<U+017F>wer this fir<U+017F>t re<U+017F>pect, if you wa<U+017F>h the Ulcers twice a day with them, and lay

Motions without the diminution or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of their Functions, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s are the principal Agents in the <U+017F>eparation and expul<U+017F>ion of Impurities.</p>
                  <p>If you de<U+017F>ire therefore to avoid the<U+017F>e exce<U+017F><U+017F>es, you'll find nothing more <U+017F>afe than an Infu<U+017F>ion of Senna with Salt of Tartar, in which you may al<U+017F>o di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the Syrups of Ro<U+017F>es or Peachflowers; proportionating the do<U+017F>es to the age and <U+017F>trength of the Patient you take in hand.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Diuretiks you mu<U+017F>t make u<U+017F>e of to repel by Urine, are Cry<U+017F>tal Mineral, which you may give from half a drachm to two or three, and the Spirits of Vitriol and Sulphur, from <U+017F>ix to thirty drops in Pellitory Water, or an Aperitive Pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>anne, you may prepare with the Roots of Strawberries, wild Succhory, Gra<U+017F>s and Dandelion.</p>
                  <p>Tho<U+017F>e of Par<U+017F>ly, Fennil, Sperage, and Re<U+017F>t-harrow, are much more aperitive than the former, and divers forms of Pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>annes may be prepared with them, that are u<U+017F>eful indeed to <U+017F>ome, but may have very ill effect on per<U+017F>ons extremely hot and dry, as well as Radi<U+017F>h-<U+017F>eed brui<U+017F>ed, and taken in white Wine, which is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding a mo<U+017F>t powerful Aperitive.</p>

It remains to <U+017F>ay, that the<U+017F>e Evils do not long continue under the Name of Ulcers <U+017F>imply; for it is well known that the matter which cau<U+017F>es them doth <U+017F>ometimes in<U+017F>inuate more deeply, and by this means doth make another degree of the Pox; but it more often happens, that by long continuance in the exulcerated part, it makes the Ulcers turn into Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, after the manner I <U+017F>poke of before. Wherefore it is good to ob<U+017F>erve, that you dre<U+017F>s them in this condition with E<U+017F>caroticks and Suppuratives, becau<U+017F>e you mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>ume the hardne<U+017F>s that is

is <U+017F>o much the more <U+017F>ubject to unhappy con<U+017F>equences, as the part is already affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and therefore more di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Fluxions; and therefore you will do much better to try <U+017F>ome Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Fomentations, and Catapla<U+017F>ms, that you may prepare with the Decoction and Re<U+017F>idence of Mallow-leaves, Roots of Mar<U+017F>h-Mallows, and Lin-<U+017F>eed, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the frictions of the Ointments, and application of the Pla<U+017F>ters I named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. During which, you mu<U+017F>t mundifie the Ulcers, and Chancres, as well as you can, with the Collyres or Liquours before de<U+017F>cribed; of which Liquours you may often make Injections under the Prepuce, with a little Syringe, ob<U+017F>erving to <U+017F>tretch it by little and little with your fingers, by drawing it toward the root of the Yard, as often as you dre<U+017F>s your Patient, till the Gland becomes again wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; but all this mu<U+017F>t be done ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gently, and without any violence, for otherwi<U+017F>e there will happen a <hi>Paraphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>is,</hi> which is an Accident much wor<U+017F>e than the former; for be<U+017F>ides that the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi> is <U+017F>uffocated, and cannot by any means be uncovered, this <U+017F>uffocation cau<U+017F>es <U+017F>uch a pain, as pre<U+017F>ently draws

                  <p>Some have indeed very happily cured this Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, by only bathing the Yard or Belly in cold Water, but this principally in its beginning.</p>

                  <p>Though Virulent Claps, or Heats of Urine, do never happen without Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrheas, that is to <U+017F>ay, without the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and flowing of the Seed, yet they mu<U+017F>t not be confounded indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together under the<U+017F>e two Names, as <U+017F>ome Authors have very incon<U+017F>iderately done; becau<U+017F>e this la<U+017F>t Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains <U+017F>ometimes a great while after the former, and it is <U+017F>een <U+017F>ometimes to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen alone, that is to <U+017F>ay, without Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration, and apparent Inflammation, though indeed it be actually cau<U+017F>ed by the pre<U+017F>ence of impure Salts which po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the Spermatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els.

                  <p>Some of tho<U+017F>e that abu<U+017F>e Phy<U+017F>ick and its Remedies, do <U+017F>trive to <U+017F>top the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that runs in Claps, only with a<U+017F>trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Injections; which cau<U+017F>es the matter to <U+017F>ink into the more inward parts, and <U+017F>o con<U+017F>equently there happens a greater Evil then they pretended to cure, or at lea<U+017F>t the effluxion begins again <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as they have left off the u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Remedies: in <U+017F>o much that they are compelled <U+017F>ometimes fifteen or twenty times to rea<U+017F><U+017F>ume the u<U+017F>e of them, without attaining the end they propo<U+017F>ed them<U+017F>elves. For the<U+017F>e Injections cannot
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40248:54"/>
go in Men further than the inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the common pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the Seed and Urine, nor in Women further than the neck of the Womb, or the neck of the Bladder; but this happens chiefly, becau<U+017F>e by this means they hinder the evacuation of <U+017F>uch Impurities as may <U+017F>till remain <U+017F>ometimes after the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former Medicaments, and are too often the only cau<U+017F>e of the duration of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. Now none of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, when Stiptick Remedies that are taken inwardly, are u<U+017F>ed with prudence; for they clo<U+017F>e the Spermatick Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els by little and little, which by this re<U+017F>triction or compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion do di<U+017F>charge them<U+017F>elves of their remaining Impurities; <U+017F>o that you may always make u<U+017F>e of them with good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, ob<U+017F>erving only that you give them at fir<U+017F>t in a very <U+017F>mall quantity and this a little after the Purgatives <U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before. To this we mu<U+017F>t add ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s, that it is <U+017F>ometimes needful not to make u<U+017F>e of them at all, and that Circum<U+017F>tances do <U+017F>ometimes happen wherein they are unprofitable, or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. For it is remarkable in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t part of tho<U+017F>e that are thus affected, that the matter which runs out toward
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40248:54"/>
end of their Cure, is nothing el<U+017F>e but the <hi>Virus</hi> of <U+017F>ome of the Ulcers in the pa<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; <U+017F>o con<U+017F>equently its effluxion mu<U+017F>t not be hindred by any other Remedies than <U+017F>uch as are clean<U+017F>ing and de<U+017F>iccative. Sometimes al<U+017F>o the extraordinary heat of the Bowels doth nouri<U+017F>h and continue the Inflammation and Dilatation of the ejaculatory Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; <U+017F>o that the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and lo<U+017F>s of Seed cannot be hindered but by a proper Dyet, and cooling Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.

Whereas the Genital parts do <U+017F>erve oftner than any other for the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Venereal Salts, the Groin which is very near them doth <U+017F>uffer the impure Tumours by which they are driven out, more commonly than the other Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories; after the <U+017F>ame manner as the Humours that <U+017F>erve for a <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tilence, do rather happen to <U+017F>well under the Arm-pits, becau<U+017F>e they are nearer the Brea<U+017F>t, which fir<U+017F>t received by in<U+017F>pirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the infected Air that cau<U+017F>ed this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e. But though it be ea<U+017F>y to remark that tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ort of Tumours are always made by <U+017F>ome Critical Motion, it is known neverthele<U+017F>s that the efforts, which Nature makes on this account would often prove to no purpo<U+017F>e, if <U+017F>he were not <U+017F>econded by the application &amp; action of Remedies that Phy<U+017F>ick does furni<U+017F>h us with. An Example of this truth is ob<U+017F>erved particularly in Buboes or Poulains, that often appear in the Groins, when the impure matter hath been driven thither, but yet di<U+017F>appear again <U+017F>ometimes, when it hath not been <U+017F>topt there by Attractives; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not in the <hi>Cri<U+017F>es</hi> that are made the other was I have <U+017F>poken of, by rea<U+017F>on

that they have nothing to hinder the pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age of Impurities, and becau<U+017F>e the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that run through them do at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>erve to extend and di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the Venereal Salts, which are ea<U+017F>ily dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out by this means. But it is not the <U+017F>ame when a Bubo begins to ri<U+017F>e, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Humour that there is mixed with tho<U+017F>e Salts, thickens by this mixture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it remains a long time under the skin, and can have no i<U+017F><U+017F>ue at all but by piercing it; <U+017F>o that the<U+017F>e <hi>Cri<U+017F>es</hi> can <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom become perfect, unle<U+017F>s Nature is a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted with Art.</p>
                  <p>The intention which you ought to have for to an<U+017F>wer this re<U+017F>pect, doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in augmenting the Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature, and procuring a Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This Augmentation may be made two manner of ways. The fir<U+017F>t is, by driving it from within outwardly, by the u<U+017F>e of hot Aliments, for Example, of Wine, or el<U+017F>e of Remedies of the <U+017F>ame quality, <U+017F>uch as Treacle, or Treacle-water. The <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is by attracting and dige<U+017F>ting the Tumour by Topicks.</p>
                  <p>The attraction and dige<U+017F>tion of Buboes is wont to be made ordinarily, with the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40248:61"/>
Pla<U+017F>ter <hi>Diachylum,</hi> that is compounded of <hi>Galbanum, Opoponax,</hi> and the other hot and attractive Gums. But I know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it attracts but weakly, when the Gums enter into it in a <U+017F>mall Do<U+017F>e, and that it becomes on the contrary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olvent, when too great a quantity of them enters; <U+017F>o that its application doth not hinder the Tumours from di<U+017F>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <U+017F>ometimes, and this chiefly in Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick and Phlegmatick per<U+017F>ons, who<U+017F>e Natural heat is but weak; wherefore you mu<U+017F>t prefer at lea<U+017F>t for <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>ons the following Catapla<U+017F>m, which hath for certain a much better effect.</p>
                  <p>Take eight or ten Snails with their <U+017F>hells, <U+017F>ix Lilly-roots, two ounces of fre<U+017F>h Butter, and three ounces of old Rye-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, make Catapla<U+017F>ms of it, and apply them hot, and renew them every <U+017F>ix hours; remembring to augment the Do<U+017F>e of the Leaven, when you would attract more <U+017F>trongly in robu<U+017F>t Bodies, and al<U+017F>o to dimini<U+017F>h it for tho<U+017F>e that have their skin tender and delicate, to avoid tho<U+017F>e excoriations which might otherwi<U+017F>e be feared. Moreover, this Remedy hath not only the vertue of attracting, but al<U+017F>o that of <U+017F>topping and fixing the Humour
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40248:62"/>
in the part, by contributing much to the Suppuration.</p>
                  <p>When the Tumour is rebellious, and advances not <U+017F>o much as may be wi<U+017F>hed, a great Cupping-gla<U+017F>s may be <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully applyed upon it every twelve hours, which mu<U+017F>t be left each time, till it hath made a con<U+017F>iderable attraction; after which you may take it off, and put upon the point of the Tumour a Tent of the bigne<U+017F>s of a farthing, on which you may put an Ointment made of equal parts of <hi>Ba<U+017F>ilicum,</hi> and Leaven fermented with the Spirit of Vitriol, to apply afterwards upon it the Pla<U+017F>ter, or ordinary Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla<U+017F>m.</p>
                  <p>After you <U+017F>hall have brought the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Suppuration by the<U+017F>e means, you mu<U+017F>t open the Bubo in the mo<U+017F>t eminent part of it, or a very little lower, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Longitude of the Fibres of the Groin, with Potential Cauters, and the Lancet; after which, you may make u<U+017F>e of the ordinary Suppuratives and Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dificatives, by putting at fir<U+017F>t upon it the Pla<U+017F>ter <hi>Diachylum,</hi> and afterwards that of Mucilage with Mercury; and at la<U+017F>t you may treat it like other impure Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, remembring to purge frequently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

the latter end by Stool, and by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable that there are <U+017F>ome Impo<U+017F>tors here, and other where who do make ill u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Remedies, and do make artificial Buboes appear, on tho<U+017F>e that have none really, but <U+017F>ometimes doubt of it, by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome <hi>Glandules</hi> filled with <U+017F>ero<U+017F>ities, or other edematous Tumours, which happen either during, or after <U+017F>ome particular Poxes.</p>

                  <p>The<U+017F>e Propo<U+017F>itions do not prove ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s that the Indians are better cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than we by the u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Plants; <U+017F>ince I have proved in another place that the Pox hath <U+017F>till been in all places, and at all times; And it may be further add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if God had permitted the tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e without altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its form, he would al<U+017F>o by the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>on have permitted the tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of its Remedies too, without diminution of their Vertues. Be<U+017F>ides there would have been no need, but only
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40248:64"/>
of augmenting the Do<U+017F>es, to render the Compo<U+017F>itions that were made of them more <U+017F>trong and active. But that which particularly lets us <U+017F>ee, tho<U+017F>e people are not cured but only in appearance too, by the Decoction of the<U+017F>e Simples, is, that they do de<U+017F>iccate the bodies here as much or little le<U+017F>s than they do in the <hi>Indies</hi>; and that this de<U+017F>iccation doth make the Accidents often di<U+017F>appear for the pre<U+017F>ent, &amp; leave only the appearance of a Cure; in <U+017F>o much that they do always cau<U+017F>e a new fermentation afterwards, and appear <U+017F>ome other time more terrible than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>What<U+017F>oever you plea<U+017F>e to think of it, it is certain this Opinion was at la<U+017F>t found and acknowledged to be true, and the greate<U+017F>t part of our Phy<U+017F>icians began at la<U+017F>t to di<U+017F>abu<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves; <U+017F>o that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers E<U+017F><U+017F>ays were made to di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>ome other Remedy for this Evil. Our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries prepared for this effect divers <U+017F>orts of Purgative and Vomitive Potions, Antidotes, and Cordial Confections, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters, Ointments, and generally all kinds of Compo<U+017F>itions of the Galenical Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie. The Chymi<U+017F>ts did not fail on their part to try their Elixirs, their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canums
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40248:65"/>
Magi<U+017F>teries, Quinte<U+017F><U+017F>ences and Extracts, both Emetick, Cathartick and Diaphoretick. La<U+017F>tly, after a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofs of the like nature, it was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily found out, that tho<U+017F>e who had the Pox could be cured indeed by Frictions with Mercurial Ointments, which <U+017F>erved heretofore for the pretended Lepro<U+017F>ie, of which I have <U+017F>poken before. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s <U+017F>eeing the<U+017F>e Sudorifick Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did heretofore take away the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it in <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons, they were not neglected altogether; and the e<U+017F>teem that had been made of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did <U+017F>till contribute much to the u<U+017F>e that hath been made of them <U+017F>ince, and is continued now a days, which is to give them for preparing the Bodies, on which Mercury is de<U+017F>igned to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it is not hard to under<U+017F>tand how the Accidents of the Pox can di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear for <U+017F>ome time, without de<U+017F>troying its Cau<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince it is evident enough, by what I have already <U+017F>aid in the Fir<U+017F>t Section of this Book, that it e<U+017F><U+017F>entially con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in a venomous Salt mixt with the Blood, which ferments and <U+017F>ets it a boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <U+017F>o that during this Ebullition there
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40248:65"/>
continually ari<U+017F>es out of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els that contain it many vaporous or <U+017F>erous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which produce different Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, according to their Quality, or Quantity, or Parts where they adhere. Now <U+017F>eeing the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ame Matters can be ea<U+017F>ily con<U+017F>umed by Sudorificks, Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and generally by de<U+017F>iccative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; we mu<U+017F>t not at all wonder, if their Effects do not appear for a time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the u<U+017F>e of a Decoction of the<U+017F>e Plants, and if neverthele<U+017F>s the Ferment that rai<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up tho<U+017F>e Vapours, do <U+017F>till continue mixed with the Blood, <U+017F>ince it is a Salt di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, fermented and confounded with it, that cannot be <U+017F>ufficiently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off by matters that pa<U+017F>s away <U+017F>o quickly.</p>
                  <p>I know very well it may be <U+017F>aid, that one can hardly believe how the Indians <U+017F>hould be cured only in <U+017F>how, and <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o long deceived without perceiving their errour. But ob<U+017F>erve how I conceive that may be done: Strumpets are there wonderful common, and they make u<U+017F>e of them with the Brutality that is u<U+017F>ual to <U+017F>uch as have little Religion in them; which makes this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e <U+017F>o familiar among them, that they have rea<U+017F>on to think they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40248:66"/>
contract it <U+017F>till anew again. For indeed it is not at all likely, that they <U+017F>hould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd <U+017F>o frequently to reiterate their Cures, as Hi<U+017F>tories and Relations tell us they do, if they really had any a<U+017F><U+017F>ured Remedies to de<U+017F>troy this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e in its Root.</p>
                  <p>I do not mean (as I have already <U+017F>aid) that the Univer<U+017F>al Pox can never be cured by the<U+017F>e Sudorificks, or by other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies more ordinary and common, whil<U+017F>t it is yet but in its fir<U+017F>t degree, that is to <U+017F>ay, when its Matter hath not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly united with the Blood by a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: But be<U+017F>ides that this Degree doth continue but a little while, it is not always liable to be rightly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed, and Mercury doth carry it off with <U+017F>o much promptitude and facility, that it were indeed vain to try other Remedies.</p>
                  <p>Notwith<U+017F>tanding that the<U+017F>e Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are founded both upon Rea<U+017F>on and Experience, and do prove by the<U+017F>e two means that the<U+017F>e Plants are not Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick again<U+017F>t this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; we mu<U+017F>t avow neverthele<U+017F>s that there are <U+017F>ome Occurrences, wherein they may much contribute to the Cure, <U+017F>eeing there are <U+017F>ome Bodies that mu<U+017F>t be ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely de<U+017F>iccated before the application
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40248:66"/>

Some Authors pretend that this Effect proceeds from its Sudorifick ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and others contend to prove that it is much more Diuretick: but which <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, 'tis always true that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umes the Phlegm and Sero<U+017F>ities, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them off either by Sweat or Urine. And that the<U+017F>e different motions do principally proceed from the internal di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of tho<U+017F>e that u<U+017F>e them, <U+017F>ince it is found by Experience that it doth make <U+017F>ome <U+017F>weat and others urine.

doth <U+017F>uffer the mixture, union, and amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamation of this Metal with the greate<U+017F>t part of other Metals: which gives occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion to Impo<U+017F>tors to augment its quantity with Lead and Tin; <U+017F>o that it now becomes very difficult to find any of it truly pure, unle<U+017F>s one mixes Cinnaber with the <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of Iron to draw out pure Mercury by di<U+017F>tillation. For by this means we are <U+017F>ure to have it in its purity, becau<U+017F>e the other Metals are not volatil enough to mount with it, but remain in the Retort united with the Sulphur and the Iron.</p>

                  <p>We know ea<U+017F>ily enough that Gold &amp; Lead are gro<U+017F>s and <U+017F>ulphurous, by their malleability, but the Sulphurs that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Compo<U+017F>ition of Mercury <U+017F>eem to di<U+017F>cover them<U+017F>elves chiefly by its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility, and conjunction with <U+017F>ulphurous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances. I have ob<U+017F>erved neverthele<U+017F>s that Metals which abound with this principle are more weighty than others, becau<U+017F>e their parts are more perfectly tyed and united together; <U+017F>o that they always have <U+017F>o much the le<U+017F>s weight, as they are better dige<U+017F>ted, or become more perfect, becau<U+017F>e the parts do continually <U+017F>eparate in dige<U+017F>tion, or el<U+017F>e becau<U+017F>e the greate<U+017F>t part of its Sulphurs do exhale,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40248:73"/>
and <U+017F>o leave empty <U+017F>paces in the mixed. Now <U+017F>eeing Mercury is a Metal very crude and weighty, we may for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on <U+017F>ay, that it is al<U+017F>o very <U+017F>ulphurous, as you <U+017F>ee by the things <U+017F>poken before, that its Sulphurs do render it very proper for Motion; and <U+017F>o you ought not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is Volatil, when moved or excited by any Heat, or that without Heat it is proper to penetrate, and <U+017F>ink deep into bodies, <U+017F>ince its weight, fluidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and agitation of its Sulphurs, are things <U+017F>ufficient to bear it downwards.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Notwith<U+017F>tanding you mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve that it doth not always nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily <U+017F>ink downwards, but that it may be rendered purely penetrant and volatil by its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ion; this truth appears in the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition and Application of Mercurial Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters and Ointments, in which it is held divided into imperceptible particles by the means of re<U+017F>inous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances, that they may the more properly be able to penetrate the pores of all the skin on which they are applyed.</p>
                  <p>But though this divi<U+017F>ion be very u<U+017F>eful, it is neverthele<U+017F>s very imperfect, <U+017F>eeing the gentle<U+017F>t Heat is able to melt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inous matters that held the Mercury <U+017F>o

divided, and by this means it ea<U+017F>ily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unites to appear again in its ancient form; which doth not happen, when it hath been di<U+017F><U+017F>olved with <hi>Acids</hi>; for putting the Di<U+017F><U+017F>olution over the Fire, the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture will evaporate, and the Mercury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at bottom in form of Salt, or el<U+017F>e continuing the Fire, it <U+017F>ublimates to the middle of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el; <U+017F>o that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been thus <U+017F>everal times <U+017F>ublimated, it remains at la<U+017F>t alone, or mixt with very few <hi>Acids,</hi> without lo<U+017F>ing never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s the form of Salt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I do not mean that Mercury cannot be <U+017F>ublimated by Heat without being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, but it is very certain that the Heat mu<U+017F>t be more or le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trong according as the <hi>Corpu<U+017F>cules</hi> of Mercury are gro<U+017F>s or heavy; whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s that it is divided into very <U+017F>ubtil particles in the Troches that are u<U+017F>ed for Fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it may the ea<U+017F>ier be carried of, and with the le<U+017F>s violence.</p>
                  <p>But though it lo<U+017F>es its weight when <U+017F>o divided, and its lightne<U+017F>s renders it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for precipitation, we know not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding by experience that <hi>Alkalis</hi> will precipitate it, <U+017F>ince by ca<U+017F>ting Lime-water, or the Oyl or Liquour of Tartar,

                  <p n="7">7. Furthermore I am not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand why the Red powder of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury is now-a-days called Precipitate, <U+017F>eeing it is nothing el<U+017F>e but its Di<U+017F><U+017F>oluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or the Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, which is afterwards made evaporate to <U+017F>iccity; unle<U+017F>s it be becau<U+017F>e the <hi>Acids</hi> do unite to all parts of it in the<U+017F>e <U+017F>orts of Di<U+017F><U+017F>olutions, and <U+017F>o by this means render it more fixt, heavy, and if you will too more penetrant than after the ordinary divi<U+017F>ions that are made of it with re<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous bodies. What<U+017F>oever is the Rea<U+017F>on, it is always true that this is no Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, and that the <hi>Acids</hi> thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with the Mercury, do not hinder it from being <U+017F>ublimated, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from mounting <U+017F>o high, as it would do if alone, or mixed with re<U+017F>inous Drugs; if <U+017F>o be the Mercury be not in too <U+017F>mall a quantity, or driven by too violent a Heat.</p>
                  <p>We may ea<U+017F>ily conceive, that nothing but the different quantity of <hi>Acids</hi> doth

render it more or le<U+017F>s Corro<U+017F>ive, if we make reflection on the manner of dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Sublimate; one part of Sublimate Corro<U+017F>ive is mixed with another part of crude Mercury, till the whole Ma<U+017F>s ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears greyi<U+017F>h; afterwards it is <U+017F>ublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again, and after this <U+017F>econd Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is found to be le<U+017F>s Corro<U+017F>ive than it was before; becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome part of the <hi>Acids</hi> of its Nitre and Vitriol do fly out of the Sublimatory Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, and others <U+017F>tick to the neck like mill-du<U+017F>t, but are ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>eparated from the <U+017F>ublimated Ma<U+017F>s be<U+017F>ides al<U+017F>o that tho<U+017F>e which <U+017F>till remain are more extended by the augmentation of Mercury; <U+017F>o that by thus powdring and <U+017F>ublimating it three or four times, it becomes at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>o ducified, that it may be <U+017F>afely given inwardly in a con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Do<U+017F>e, though it were at fir<U+017F>t the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t Corro<U+017F>ive and poi<U+017F>on.</p>

every <U+017F>ide, when it is divided into <U+017F>ubtil particles; that it is heavy and corro<U+017F>ive when mixed with <hi>Acids</hi>; and on the contrary very benign and volatil when <U+017F>eparated and extended by re<U+017F>inous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; that <hi>Alkalis</hi> can precipitate it, when di<U+017F><U+017F>olved and mixed with Liquours; la<U+017F>tly that the diver<U+017F>ity of bodies to which it joyns doth <U+017F>erve to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h its Actions and Effects: to which may be added al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome following Ob<U+017F>ervations, that <U+017F>erve for a proof of this truth, as well as the Applications that I intend to make of them, when I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>peak of the <hi>Cri<U+017F>es</hi> that it excites.

By what I have now <U+017F>aid, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by the la<U+017F>t three Remarks, you <U+017F>ee that the divers matters which are found to abound in bodies on which Mercury is applyed are the Cau<U+017F>es of its different productions, <U+017F>eeing you may be al<U+017F>o <U+017F>atisfied, that it is not poi<U+017F>onous in its own Nature, and that all its unhappy effects do principally proceed from the inward di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of mind and body; for when the Spirits are agitated by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, they may then <U+017F>ublimate the Mercury with Impetuo<U+017F>ity, even into the very Brain, and cau<U+017F>e by this means the mo<U+017F>t doleful Accidents that are found to follow its Application. So there may happen Accidents very dangerous too, for not having well corrected the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Inanition or Repletion of bodies ill di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed for its Reception.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40248:80"/>
Baths, Pti<U+017F>annes, and what<U+017F>oever is able to moy<U+017F>ten and cool the Body, to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the following Salivation hereby, and render the actions of Mercury the le<U+017F>s pernicious; <U+017F>ome others u<U+017F>e partly things that moi<U+017F>ten, and partly <U+017F>uch as dry; and others again make u<U+017F>e of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite different means, which I find to be all alike ridiculous, becau<U+017F>e they are u<U+017F>ed indifferently to all per<U+017F>ons, and they all differ only becau<U+017F>e each have found them practi<U+017F>ed on <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons; whereas in truth the Age, Sex, Strength, Temperament, and generally the pre<U+017F>ent di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of the <U+017F>everal Patients ought to con<U+017F>titute all the difference.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if it be by the means of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury alone that the <hi>Cri<U+017F>es</hi> of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al Pox are intended to be rai<U+017F>ed, there is no need of employing the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies both Alterative and evacuative, before the application you would make of it, but only perhaps for the opening and dilatation of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages that <U+017F>erve for Expul<U+017F>ion of Excrements, in <U+017F>uch as are of a good Temper, or el<U+017F>e to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the faults of tho<U+017F>e that are remote from this good Con<U+017F>titution. For if you <U+017F>hould offer to de<U+017F>iccate a Body that is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40248:80"/>
of a middle Age, moderate Temper, and that rightly performs all its natural Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, 'tis certain it mu<U+017F>t receive great Alteration, and this Alteration mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily remove it from the Equality and Moderation it was in before, which neverthele<U+017F>s is exactly the e<U+017F>tate in which Nature keeps its true vgour, and in which con<U+017F>equently it mu<U+017F>t be better able to <U+017F>econd the force of Remedies; whence it follows, that it comes to be le<U+017F>s proper for the Critical motions which do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the application of Mercury, in tho<U+017F>e in whom a <U+017F>ufficient quantity of acid Humours may be found, to <U+017F>top and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Mercury in the <U+017F>everal parts, for the time it ought to remain in them.</p>
                  <p>But if this Alteration can be <U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderably pernicious, even to <U+017F>uch as are in a <U+017F>tate of perfection; you will not at all wonder, if the Salivation cannot be <U+017F>afely procured in Dry, Cholerick, or Melancholick Bodies that have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared after this manner: nay, you will find on the contrary, that all the parts will receive injury from the activity of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, <U+017F>eing it is now agitated by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Heat, and finds nothing that is able to fix and detain it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:40248:81"/>It is no le<U+017F>s dangerous to make u<U+017F>e of things that cool and moi<U+017F>ten, for the preparation of tho<U+017F>e that are replete and phlegmatick; for by this means the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion is augmented, and the Humours become <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed for Fluxion, that Mercury <U+017F>oon draws them along with it in great abundance, and very often all the parts about the Throat do fill and <U+017F>well in <U+017F>uch manner, that the Patients are <U+017F>oon <U+017F>uffocated thereby.</p>
                  <p>But now <U+017F>peaking of the danger there is in making u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ame Remedies in all different Subjects, it comes into my mind, that I have read in a famous Author a certain Di<U+017F>pute that he rai<U+017F>es and re<U+017F>olves him<U+017F>elf; 'tis whether tho<U+017F>e that have the Pox ought to be bled in their Preparation; he relates <U+017F>ome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and Rea<U+017F>ons <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and at la<U+017F>t concludes in favour of Blood let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, of which he makes <U+017F>o general a Rule, that he will not except even <U+017F>uch as are Hectict: Whereupon you mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve, that this Maxim doth <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o much the more authentick, as it appears to be e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed by a Learned Doctor, and founded on the examination and compari<U+017F>on of contrary Opinions; from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40248:81"/>
whence we may conclude that the faults which are committed by <U+017F>uch as blindly ob<U+017F>erve it, are <U+017F>o much the more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>able, as they are often irreparable; <U+017F>ince there are a great many per<U+017F>ons who never dare go a <U+017F>tep further than the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas of tho<U+017F>e that taught them. But I dare <U+017F>ay, it is a <U+017F>hameful thing, &amp; di<U+017F>parages Phy<U+017F>ick very much, that the greate<U+017F>t part of tho<U+017F>e who practi<U+017F>e it, do apply them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>o little to things of <U+017F>uch moment; and that many who have by their own indu<U+017F>trry acquired <U+017F>ome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular knowledges, are <U+017F>o covetous and fearful of communicating them, that they affect to keep them <U+017F>ecret, even when they pretend to teach and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them. Let this be <U+017F>aid by the by.</p>

Neverthele<U+017F>s you mu<U+017F>t not imagin that infallible Rules can be given, for correcting exactly all the degrees of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments, and <U+017F>everal di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of all Bodies that are of different Con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:40248:82"/>In the intermediate days you may Bathe your Patient morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the coagulated Humours, and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e the Pores of the Body for a dilatation.</p>
                  <p>During all this time you may make the following Pti<U+017F>anne <U+017F>erve for his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Drink, which will open the Pores too, and al<U+017F>o the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of Urine, that <U+017F>erve for expul<U+017F>ion of Sero<U+017F>ities.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The faults which are oppo<U+017F>ite to this good Temperament of which I now <U+017F>poke, are chiefly Inanition and Siccity, or el<U+017F>e Repletion and Humidity.</p>

                  <p>You may thence judge that Purges, and chiefly <U+017F>uch as are violent are al<U+017F>o dangerous; for be<U+017F>ides that they con<U+017F>ume the little Moi<U+017F>ture which remains, they are extreme hot too; which are two Qualities ab<U+017F>olutely contrary to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention you ought to have.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40248:85"/>
to operate; it is now time to <U+017F>peak of the <U+017F>everal ways of u<U+017F>ing it, and the choice that ought to be made of them according to the degrees of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, the <U+017F>upervening Accidents, and unhappy Circum<U+017F>tances, in which per<U+017F>ons thus di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>ed do <U+017F>ometimes find them<U+017F>elves.</p>
                  <p>Mercury is u<U+017F>ually made enter into their bodies two manner of ways; either in at the Mouth, or el<U+017F>e univer<U+017F>ally by the Pores.</p>
                  <p>It is worth ob<U+017F>erving, before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further, that the fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e ways is indeed none of the be<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e the Mercury that is thus taken at the Mouth, de<U+017F>cends pre<U+017F>ently into the Stomach, whence it is <U+017F>uddenly Sublimated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Heat of this part; which cau<U+017F>es the Salivation that is rai<U+017F>ed by this means to continue but a very little time, and not to terminate completely the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>al Pox, unle<U+017F>s the Natural Heat be found <U+017F>trong enough to <U+017F>upply this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by vigorou<U+017F>ly following the Motion of Mercury.</p>
                  <p>I know well enough that <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>ons do mix Purgatives with it, which do hinder its Sublimation, by precipitating it downwards. But this cu<U+017F>tom <U+017F>eems to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40248:86"/>
have as little certainty as the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e only pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the Guts, it cannot purify at mo<U+017F>t but that which is called the <U+017F>econd Region of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for there is no likelihood at all, that it <U+017F>hould be able to penetrate into the mo<U+017F>t remote parts, to mix with all the Acid Humours that are there extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<U+017F>ated, and <U+017F>o draw them into the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I have <U+017F>poken of, by a contrary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>By this way of arguing, and by the proof that I have made in this matter, and <U+017F>een others make too; I cannot but think, <U+017F>uch as indifferently practi<U+017F>e this way of admini<U+017F>tring it, and make it pa<U+017F>s for infallible in all that have the Pox, and in all the degrees of it, ought to be e<U+017F>teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ignorant, or Impo<U+017F>tors; and Patients <U+017F>hould in all rea<U+017F>on rather rely upon the Hone<U+017F>ty and Experience of true Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who do find but too many Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions for di<U+017F>covering this truth, and are not wanting to adverti<U+017F>e ingeniou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>uch as have an unhappy inclination to run the hazard of a fal<U+017F>e palliative Cure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e they have been once fal<U+017F>ly per<U+017F>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or becau<U+017F>e they are engaged by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Motives to <U+017F>earch out Remedies

I do not mean but there may be found abundance of per<U+017F>ons, who will maintain they have been cured by taking Mercury this way. But you mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve, that among them there are many who never had the Pox but only in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; that in <U+017F>ome Nature did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Critical Motion of her own accord, near about the time they made this u<U+017F>e of Mercury; that in others <U+017F>he had been <U+017F>trongly moved to the <U+017F>ame effect, by the activity of other Remedies which have been mixed with it; la<U+017F>tly that tho<U+017F>e who have u<U+017F>ed it in the fir<U+017F>t degree of this univer<U+017F>al Pox, that is to <U+017F>ay, when its matter remains <U+017F>till in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and hath not yet cau<U+017F>ed the ebullition of the blood, and con<U+017F>equently diffu<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<U+017F>ities, might have been perfectly puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by receiving through the rough Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery <U+017F>ome part of the Mercury that is <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated from the Stomach up to the Mouth, and might by that means be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Heart, from whence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes univer<U+017F>ally <U+017F>pread through the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els by the Circulation; or el<U+017F>e by attracting through the Lacteal Veines <U+017F>ome particles of that which is precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated

For <U+017F>ome of them give the<U+017F>e things <U+017F>imply, and without any other Preparation, in the Con<U+017F>erve of Ro<U+017F>es; and pretend to make them pa<U+017F>s quickly into all parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by giving pre<U+017F>ently afterwards to their Patients as much Wine as they are able to drink; on which <U+017F>ubject you mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve, that Wine taken in good quantity is mighty Diuretick, and that Mercury thus impregnated with Salts is ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F><U+017F>olved, and carried off by Urine, which for that rea<U+017F>on then becomes very Salt and Acid, and is therefore the cau<U+017F>e that there is but a very <U+017F>mall part of them that can enter or continue in the <U+017F>angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and <U+017F>o very <U+017F>mall help can be expected from them. Others again give the<U+017F>e powders mixed with Gumme Gutta, the Re<U+017F>ine of Jalap, and other Purgatives alike violent, which truly do pre<U+017F>erve it in Motion, and do hinder it from adhering to the Stomach and Guts, but do often cau<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t terrible Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents by the fire that they enkindle in the body, and by the violence of the<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Mercurial Pla<U+017F>ters and Ointments are applyed to the <U+017F>ame places, and have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near the <U+017F>ame effect; the manner of u<U+017F>ing them doth not differ neither, only the fir<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>pread upon Leather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are applyed, whereas the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are applyed directly upon the skin, which is afterwards only covered with <U+017F>ome Linnen.</p>
                  <p>That which is particular in this matter, is that the Mercury which enters into Pla<U+017F>ters requires a longer time to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the Ma<U+017F>s, than that which is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ointments, becau<U+017F>e it is more clo<U+017F>ely confounded in the <U+017F>olidne<U+017F>s of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore you mu<U+017F>t not change them but <U+017F>eldom or not at all, and cover from the beginning all the parts that ought to be covered.</p>
                  <p>The Pla<U+017F>ter which is ordinarily made u<U+017F>e of, is that which is de<U+017F>cribed by, and called <hi>de Vigo,</hi> and is found prepared in all Shops, <U+017F>imple, double, or treble with Mercury. But for as much as it is of too

                  <p n="4">4. That which is commonly called <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morbo,</hi> or the Grey Ointment, and by the Phy<U+017F>icians Neapolitan, is found pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in Apothecaries Shops, and <U+017F>ome make the friction with it. But becau<U+017F>e the Do<U+017F>e of Mercury is very <U+017F>mall in it, and, becau<U+017F>e it is of an un<U+017F>avoury <U+017F>mell; you may prepare another, more effectual Oyntment, with four ounces of Mercury, two ounces of Turpentine, one ounce of the Oyl of Bays, two drachms of Saffron, and a pound and a half of the Ointment of Ro<U+017F>es.</p>
                  <p>You may employ about two ounces of this Ointment for the fir<U+017F>t friction, which you mu<U+017F>t make from the Ankles till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Knees, and from the Wri<U+017F>ts to the end of the Shoulder-blades.</p>
                  <p>Though this quantity of Mercury be <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>ufficient to bring Nature to a Critical Motion, neverthele<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons have been found <U+017F>o tender and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

or ea<U+017F>y to put into this Motion, that they have received a Salivation even from the, very fir<U+017F>t Friction, and in which per<U+017F>ons a <U+017F>econd would have proved very dangerous; <U+017F>o that you mu<U+017F>t ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve narrowly the Patient you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as you have thus given him Mercury, and you mu<U+017F>t diligently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what<U+017F>oever happens to him anew, to the end you may pre<U+017F>ently leave of your Frictions, <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as the <U+017F>igns of a Salivation do appear, and this to avoid Suffocation, which doth always happen, when the Humours are carried up to the Throat in too great an abundance.</p>
                  <p>In the <U+017F>econd Friction which mu<U+017F>t be made four and twenty hours after the fir<U+017F>t, you may employ up to four ounces of your Ointment, and rub the Legs and Thighs with it from the middle of the Foot to the upper part of the Hips, the Chine or Back-bone from the end of the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> to the middle of the Neck, and the Arms, from the Wri<U+017F>ts again to the Shoulder-blades, not forgetting the places where the <hi>Glandules</hi> are <U+017F>eated, which <U+017F>erve for Emonctories to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler parts.</p>
                  <p>This <U+017F>econd Friction is <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>ufficient,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:40248:90"/>
but we are often compelled to make a third too, with the <U+017F>ame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances of the quantity of Ointment, and parts whereon it is applyed, which doth almo<U+017F>t always produce the de<U+017F>ired effect, when the body is rightly prepared as it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>But you mu<U+017F>t not de<U+017F>pair, though it <U+017F>hould fail to come yet; you mu<U+017F>t then u<U+017F>e your be<U+017F>t prudence and di<U+017F>cretion, and have a care of going too fa<U+017F>t in your intention, le<U+017F>t Nature <U+017F>hould chance to <U+017F>urprize you on a <U+017F>udden. For Example, you mu<U+017F>t let it alone for a day or two, before you begin a new Friction, and you mu<U+017F>t employ but a <U+017F>mall quantity of your Ointment, if you perceive any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Commotion. Be not ob<U+017F>tinate neither in filling a body with Mercury by fifteen or twenty repeated Frictions, as <U+017F>ome Authors do unadvi<U+017F>edly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>el, becau<U+017F>e it is a thing of very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a con<U+017F>equence, and the <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> you mu<U+017F>t de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>hould rather depend on a good Preparation, than <U+017F>uch an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this Medicament.</p>
                  <p>How<U+017F>oever you'll find by Experience that a Do<U+017F>e of <U+017F>weet Sublimate will now prove wonderfully beneficial, if you give

it after a rea<U+017F>onable number of Frictions.</p>
                  <p>There remains <U+017F>omething <U+017F>till to be <U+017F>aid of the time and manner of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, becau<U+017F>e there are <U+017F>ome very u<U+017F>eful Circum<U+017F>tances which depend on them; For Example, in a Cold Sea<U+017F>on, it is needful to make choice of Noon, for the rubbing your Patients, becau<U+017F>e the Air of our Climate is then rendred a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more benign; and in hot Weather on the contrary you mu<U+017F>t prefer the Mornings and Evenings, le<U+017F>t the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Heat that is joyned with the Fire you mu<U+017F>t make <U+017F>hould weaken them too much; but in mild Weather you may indifferently make u<U+017F>e of any hour of the Day, ob<U+017F>erving only that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tribution of Aliments be then fini<U+017F>hed, that Nature may have no other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take her off from con<U+017F>piring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Mercury to rai<U+017F>e the <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> you de<U+017F>ire.</p>
                  <p>As for the manner of making this Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, 'tis nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to <U+017F>ay it mu<U+017F>t always be made before the Fire, which mu<U+017F>t be very great, but e<U+017F>pecially in Winter, and enclo<U+017F>ed with a Skreen, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch like thing, to hinder the Wind, and <U+017F>erve to reverberate the Heat, that the Mercury
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40248:91"/>
may the better penetrate through the pores, and the Patient may not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>ted with any Cold; the Friction mu<U+017F>t be repeated <U+017F>everal times on each part to facilitate this penetration.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Among the three ways of making Mercury enter through the pores, I have found by practice that the Fumigation is the wor<U+017F>t of all, and is <U+017F>o much the more dangerous, as it is commonly performed by the Smoke of Artificial Cynabre, which may prove a kind of poi<U+017F>on in its <U+017F>elf, but is thought to be corrected by the mixture of Sublimate Corro<U+017F>ive, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Ar<U+017F>enick, and other like Druggs, which are indeed poi<U+017F>ons much more pernicious.</p>
                  <p>How<U+017F>oever I grant it may be <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preferred before the others, when the Pox comes to be in the la<U+017F>t degree of all, by rea<U+017F>on that the Mercury being thus turned into Vapours, doth penetrate the bones the better. But if you de<U+017F>ire to draw the be<U+017F>t effect that can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it, make u<U+017F>e of crude Mercury reduced into Troches with Turpentin, Coals made of Willow, and <hi>Orris</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and leave all the other <hi>Formules</hi> to <U+017F>uch as Ignorance doth engage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

                  <p>To conclude, there is nothing more common than the way of giving the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation; a certain Couch is covered all round with a <U+017F>heet, and a little Stool turned up<U+017F>ide downward is put under it, &amp; upon it a Chaffendi<U+017F>h of lighted Coals, in which Troches are burnt, who<U+017F>e Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour the Patient receives all naked under the Covering, always excepting the Head, which is only kept within from time to time, when there are Ulcers in the No<U+017F>e, Mouth, or other parts of it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THere are <U+017F>ome Authors who have maintained, that Mercury ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied exteriourly on the skin, doth act on the body only by an irradiative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that the Do<U+017F>e which was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to this effect, might ea<U+017F>ily be found again entirely in the Linnen and Pla<U+017F>ters, after provocation of the <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi>;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40248:92"/>
others have endeavoured to prove on the contrary, that it penetrates the pores, that it acts on all the inward parts, and la<U+017F>tly that it goes out <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly with the Impurities of the body, that a piece of Copper may be whitened only by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it a while in the Phlegm that runs out in the Salivation. But no body ever yet took the pains to enquire, why its Motions and Actions, and the <hi>Cri<U+017F>es</hi> that re<U+017F>ult from them do appear <U+017F>o very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, though it be prepared and given in the <U+017F>ame form and manner.</p>
                  <p>Tho<U+017F>e who have made <U+017F>ome Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on this <U+017F>ubject, are contented to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire this Mineral, and con<U+017F>ider it as an <hi>Hydra</hi> with many Heads, or as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus</hi> of Phy<U+017F>ick; they have pretended that there was <U+017F>ome Analogie between it and the Mercury of A<U+017F>trologers, which produces different effects according to its different Conjunctions with other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets; without taking notice of never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s, or pre<U+017F>uming to teach us, what are tho<U+017F>e matters it u<U+017F>ually joyns with, for to act <U+017F>o differently. They have made indeed many <hi>Elogiums</hi> of its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, without offering to give any expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of its effects; La<U+017F>tly they have
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40248:93"/>
told us that no Drug in all the Medicinal matter is fit to <U+017F>erve for a Sub<U+017F>titute in its place, but have never di<U+017F>covered to us any rea<U+017F>on of its <U+017F>ingular qualities, or what's the matter that tho<U+017F>e who have employed it have only acted like blind-men in it; <U+017F>o that young Students who have turned over all manner of Books for <U+017F>ome illu<U+017F>tration of this matter, have never been able to find any <U+017F>atisfaction, but have <U+017F>till been compelled (as others have) to remain in their former ob<U+017F>curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and Patients who have been <U+017F>urpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed with Events contrary to what they were made expect, have found no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons capable of building the comfort they give them on <U+017F>ufficient or <U+017F>olid Rea<U+017F>ons.</p>
                  <p>Neverthele<U+017F>s the explication of the<U+017F>e things was not really <U+017F>o difficult; Men might have made compari<U+017F>on between the Principles of Art and tho<U+017F>e of Nature, and between things Artificial in Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, and e<U+017F>pecially in Chymi<U+017F>try, with what pa<U+017F><U+017F>es Naturally in the bodies wherein Mercury doth enter. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervations which I have made on this <U+017F>ubject, and which every body might have made as well as I, may perhaps prove <U+017F>ufficient for the Evidence of what
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40248:93"/>
was hitherto hid, being al<U+017F>o joyned with the Applications of them, per<U+017F>ons may make them<U+017F>elves. In a word, the many Experiments and Events would clearly have di<U+017F>covered the truth, if men had been but curious enough to <U+017F>eek it out.</p>
                  <p>But whether it be that the knowledge of it was not judged nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, or that no body was willing to take the pains of acquiring it, or el<U+017F>e that tho<U+017F>e who po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed the knowledge of it were not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to communicate what they knew; it is very certain that no Author hath yet undertook to teach it, and yet I cannot conceive, how the Artificial <hi>Cri<U+017F>es</hi> of the Pox can be perfectly explicated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting <U+017F>ee at the <U+017F>ame time what it is that renders them <U+017F>o different.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ways through which the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal matter doth ordinarily pa<U+017F>s in the<U+017F>e <U+017F>orts of <hi>Cri<U+017F>es,</hi> are either <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>erve for Sweat, or for pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Urine, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul<U+017F>ion of the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er Excrements, or e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>erve for the Salivation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> that is made through the fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e ways doth happen, when the Mercury finds a great many Sulphurous Vapours which do <U+017F>erve for the matter of fat, in bodies wherein it enters; for as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40248:94"/>
it doth ever mix willingly with Sulphurs, and is already di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to it by the divi<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that hath been made of it with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inous bodies, it doth ea<U+017F>ily unite with fat and vaporous matters, which render it more light, more volatil, and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more fit to follow their Motion from the Center to the Circumference. But as this <U+017F>ame Motion is in <U+017F>ome manner contrary to the penetration which Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury ought to make for <U+017F>ufficiently puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the blood; it often happens that this <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> is but imperfect, unle<U+017F>s Nature her <U+017F>elf be that way exceedingly di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some bodies are found to be <U+017F>o fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Tartarous Salt, or other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Nature of <hi>Alkalis,</hi> that the Mercury which enters into them precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates downwards by their means, and the Impurities are carried off by Siege. But as the<U+017F>e matters do not hinder the Mercury from-penetrating into all the parts, this <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> is much more certain than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, e<U+017F>pecially when the Phy<U+017F>ician helps Nature to act, by often-repeated Purges and Diureticks.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That which cau<U+017F>es the Mercury and Venereal Salts to be <U+017F>ometimes carried
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40248:94"/>
off by Urine, is that <hi>Acids</hi> are found in <U+017F>ome bodies, near in as great a Number as <hi>Alkalis</hi> is in others: The truth of this Opinion may be ea<U+017F>ily proved; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body knows that <hi>Acids</hi> taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly become Diuretick, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervations upon Mercury do <U+017F>hew, that they may be <U+017F>ublimated by Heat, when joyned with it, and that they can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated by <hi>Alkalis,</hi> even after this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation. Now you may perceive by what I have <U+017F>aid, that the property of <hi>Acids</hi> is to carry off Phlegm and Sero<U+017F>ities by way of Urine, but that they are not able to produce this effect, when joyned with Mercury, and agitated by the Natural Heat, unle<U+017F>s <hi>Alkalis</hi> do al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ufficiently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, to precipitate it downwards. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore <U+017F>eeing impure Salts are ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in watry <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances, and this <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> hath very much affinity with that which is made by Salivation, I conceive it mu<U+017F>t be more perfect than the other two, when its Evacuations continue long and large enough.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As 'tis the property of Leaven to extend it <U+017F>elf in the things that ferment, and render them hereby of a like Nature, <U+017F>o the Venereal Salts do di<U+017F><U+017F>olve in the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40248:95"/>
blood, extend them<U+017F>elves into all parts of the body, and render by this means almo<U+017F>t all the Humours <U+017F>harp and Acid. This is the rea<U+017F>on why the Salivation is the mo<U+017F>t ordinary <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> of the Pox, that is provoked by the help of Mercury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e it charges it <U+017F>elf with the<U+017F>e Acid Liquours in <U+017F>o great a mea<U+017F>ure, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is able to carry it off <U+017F>o well by the other ways I mentioned; And it is this which may be e<U+017F>teemed the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t of all to cure this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; for be<U+017F>ides that it is very <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>een to fail, when well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, the Circum<U+017F>tances which do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it make us judge the better of its goodne<U+017F>s. It is remarkable in the fir<U+017F>t place, that its Motion is from below up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and is commonly equal, moderate, and without any interruption, which <U+017F>hews that Nature acts rather of her own accord, than by the meer force of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Moreover all the Acid and impure Humours do a<U+017F>cend <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>iby with the Mercury, that this mixture is near of the <U+017F>ame quality with the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of this Mineral in the Spirit of Niter, or <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> in <U+017F>o much that being driven up by the Heat, there is made a kind of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate Corro<U+017F>ive which exulcerates all
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40248:95"/>
the parts of the Throat and Mouth, and penetrates them <U+017F>o exceedingly, that their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els are opened, and blood runs out of them for <U+017F>ome days, until the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becomes le<U+017F>s acrimonious by a <U+017F>maller quantity of <hi>Acids.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Impo<U+017F>tors who give the Salivation to <U+017F>uch as have not the Pox, make the<U+017F>e Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers pa<U+017F>s for effects of the Malignity of Venereal Salts<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> that they may the better conceal their Villanies by <U+017F>uch per<U+017F>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions. But you mu<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erve, that they do indeed happen as well to <U+017F>uch as have not the Pox, as tho<U+017F>e who really have it, becau<U+017F>e they are produced by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I lately <U+017F>poke of, or by rea<U+017F>on that there are Acid Juyces in all Men general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; in a word becau<U+017F>e the Mercury is <U+017F>oon <U+017F>ublimated, pa<U+017F><U+017F>es quickly, and doth but lightly heat the Mouth in tho<U+017F>e who have too few <hi>Acids</hi> to govern its Motion, unle<U+017F>s the other matters which I have <U+017F>poken of do train or draw it <U+017F>ome other ways: So that the Ulcers of the Mouth and Throat ought to be con<U+017F>idered as in<U+017F>eparable Accidents of this <hi>Cri<U+017F>is,</hi> what<U+017F>oever Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Moreover you may know it in its
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40248:96"/>
beginning by the agitation of the Pul<U+017F>e, the inquietudes of Mind and Body, the diminution or entire lo<U+017F>s of appetite, by the retiring of the Eyes, heat of Mouth, <U+017F>welling of the Gums and Lips, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the Tongue, <U+017F>tink of Breath, pain of Teeth, whitene<U+017F>s of the Palate, and interruption of <U+017F>leep.</p>
                  <p>When you <U+017F>hall find the <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by all the<U+017F>e Signs, you mu<U+017F>t for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear your Frictions, Fumigations, and generally all Mercurial Remedies, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Suffocation and other accidents which Mercury doth cau<U+017F>e, when given in too great a quantity. But if its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication hath been rea<U+017F>onably well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a Body rightly prepared, there will <U+017F>ucceed to the Signs I named a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual trickling of white phlegm in a long thread, which will at fir<U+017F>t run but gently, but will augment by degrees for nine days time; <U+017F>o that the more Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick per<U+017F>ons may be able thus to <U+017F>pit up to eight pounds in four and twenty hours, and others in proportion.</p>
                  <p>In the fir<U+017F>t days of the <U+017F>ublimation of Mercury, the Belly receives <U+017F>ome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion from its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and this cau<U+017F>es a Flux downwards, which la<U+017F>ts indeed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40248:96"/>
but a <U+017F>mall time, and requires no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular con<U+017F>ideration. It may be al<U+017F>o ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved in the increa<U+017F>e of the Salivation, that the Ulcers which I <U+017F>poke of do enlarge in latitude and profundity by the action of the matter that runs out of them; and that the motion of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery appears almo<U+017F>t as <U+017F>trong and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, as in burning Fevers, becau<U+017F>e im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities cannot be thus <U+017F>eperated from the Blood, without rai<U+017F>ing a great Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition in it, by the motion of Mercury, or <U+017F>trength of the natural heat. But <U+017F>eeing the<U+017F>e things do happen through an indi<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ible, nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, and are not at all contrary to what may fairly be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Action of Mercury, you need not trouble your <U+017F>elves to think of preventing or curing them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Remedies.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.

THE Method of governing <U+017F>uch as are in the <hi>Cri<U+017F>es</hi> that are rai<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mercury, doth in general con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in pre<U+017F>erving them from the violence of ill Air and bad Weather, in regulating the Quality and Quantity of Aliments and Medicaments, and if you will al<U+017F>o, in a Moderation of the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>The means of an<U+017F>wering the fir<U+017F>t point have been already given, when I <U+017F>poke of the proper <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons to treat the Pox; and it <U+017F>eems that the prudence and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Phy<U+017F>ician ought to make

Rules for the other two. Neverthele<U+017F>s <U+017F>eing it is often impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to correct perfectly in the Preparation, all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions which proceed from the diver<U+017F>e Temperaments of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons, and it is con<U+017F>equently nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to per<U+017F>i<U+017F>t until the end of the Cure, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular u<U+017F>e of things that are contrary to their pernicious Qualities; it may be expedient to do as I have here done in delivering the Method of Preparing <U+017F>uch as have this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, that is to <U+017F>ay, of <U+017F>hewing here the proper management of Nouri<U+017F>hment and Remedies for <U+017F>uch as are of an even and good Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for tho<U+017F>e that are removed from this good Mean, by great Repleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Inanition; after which you will here find <U+017F>ome general Circum<U+017F>tances it is convenient to ob<U+017F>erve, in all tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons who are treated with Mercury.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are two Rules particularly important for the Diet of one of a middle Temper; the fir<U+017F>t is, Not to give him any more Aliments than will pre<U+017F>erve his forces in good plight, that Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Superfluities may not too much abound: and the <U+017F>econd is, That you give him light Remedies for to open
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40248:99"/>
the chief pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, that Nature may not be diverted in her operations by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motions.</p>
                  <p>You will <U+017F>ufficiently an<U+017F>wer the fir<U+017F>t Rule, if you give him two new-laid Eggs at noon, and a Broth every fourth hour, all the re<U+017F>t of the day and night, which you may make with a Leg of Beef, Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and <U+017F>ome Succory.</p>
                  <p>The Pti<U+017F>anne which I have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed for preparation of Bodies of this con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, may al<U+017F>o <U+017F>erve them very well during the <hi>Cri<U+017F>is,</hi> to an<U+017F>wer the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Rule I gave you; becau<U+017F>e it is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifick and Diuretick, and may be al<U+017F>o rendred proper for gently loo<U+017F>ning the Body, by making a cold Infu<U+017F>ion of two Drachms of Senna four and twenty hours in a Quart of it, which you may make him drink every <U+017F>econd day at <U+017F>everal draughts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When you <U+017F>hall come to treat a Body that is very Hot and Dry, you mu<U+017F>t remember it would be a dangerous thing to nouri<U+017F>h him too little, or give him A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments of a Heating quality. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you mu<U+017F>t prefer Broths before new-laid Eggs, and give him one at lea<U+017F>t eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry third hour, made of a Leg of Veal,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40248:100"/>
Beef and Pullet, adding to it in Summer Sorrel, Lettice and Pur<U+017F>lain, or in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Succory. But if your Patient nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eates this kind of Nouri<U+017F>hment, you may make him a Gelly with the above-mention'd meats, French-Barley, a little of the cold Seeds and Sugar.</p>
                  <p>You may <U+017F>afely make u<U+017F>e of the moi<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cooling Pti<U+017F>anne, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed when I <U+017F>poke of the means of preparing the<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons; in a Quart of which you may infu<U+017F>e a Drachm of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and <U+017F>o much Cry<U+017F>tal Mineral to give him every fourth day.</p>
                  <p>Cly<U+017F>ters that cool and moi<U+017F>ten the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will prove very effectual, if you make them of Whey, or a Decoction of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbs, mixing with each an Ounce of Honey of Violets or white Lilies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. On the contrary, during the time you treat a Body that is extreme Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick and replete, you mu<U+017F>t not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented only with the Critical Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are commonly made by the Mouth; but you mu<U+017F>t endeavour al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways be<U+017F>ides to exhau<U+017F>t his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>ome Broths or new-laid Eggs given every <U+017F>ix hours will <U+017F>uffice for his Nouri<U+017F>hment, becau<U+017F>e you mu<U+017F>t give
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40248:100"/>
him but only ju<U+017F>t enough to keep him alive.</p>
                  <p>The Pti<U+017F>anne made of Guaiacum will al<U+017F>o <U+017F>erve to dry him the more, if you prepare it according to the Do<U+017F>e I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Chapter of the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>You may often give Cly<U+017F>ters made of common Honey, and a Decoction of the Leaves of Sage, Wormwood, Rue and Fennil.</p>
                  <p>You may prepare laxative Potions, who<U+017F>e u<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be frequent, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Sage-leaves, an Infu<U+017F>ion of Senna and Hermodactyls, and the Syrup of Ro<U+017F>es or Peach-flowers; taking care of giving them to <U+017F>uch a Do<U+017F>e, as may not be apt to divert the Salivation in its beginning, or dimini<U+017F>h it when it is in its vigour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the Examples I have given you, and by what hath been already <U+017F>aid in delivering the means of preparing Bodies for the Motions and effects of Mercury, you will ea<U+017F>ily frame different Methods, for <U+017F>uch as are in the <U+017F>everal degrees of more or le<U+017F>s; and there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of pre<U+017F>cribing any others more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on this Subject. But it is <U+017F>o much

the more nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary here to remark the following Ob<U+017F>ervations, as they ought in general to <U+017F>erve for all tho<U+017F>e who are in any <hi>Cri<U+017F>is</hi> that follows the application of this Remedy.</p>
                  <p>In all fainting and <U+017F>wooning fits you may prefer a little Wine before Cordial Liquours, or Acid Fruits, and you will find by experience that it hath a better Effect.</p>
                  <p>You mu<U+017F>t forbear Biscakes, Comfits, and generally all <U+017F>weet <U+017F>ugar'd things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e they make the Teeth black, and increa<U+017F>e the acrimony and pain which they do then <U+017F>uffer in the Throat.</p>
                  <p>After the Evacuations have been <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and you have <U+017F>topt the Flux, or hinder'd the others, you mu<U+017F>t draw your Patients by little and little, out of the great weakne<U+017F>s they then <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in, by a gradual augmentation of their nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after the <U+017F>ame manner as you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<U+017F>h'd it in their Preparation; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring always that you cannot <U+017F>uddenly change them out of Inanition into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, without endangering their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation, or putting them into <U+017F>ome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>perate and mortal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>

                  <p>It will be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to purge him in the beginning of all with a little Water of <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ia,</hi> or the Syrup of Ro<U+017F>es, and repeat this Purge <U+017F>everal times, according as he is more or le<U+017F>s replete.</p>
                  <p>You may prepare a Pti<U+017F>anne for him with a handful of French-Barley, and three or four drachms of China-root,

which you may boil in three Quarts of common Water, to the diminution of the third part, adding to it toward the end a little Licorice, &amp; after you have pa<U+017F>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ten grains of Cry<U+017F>tal Mineral, for to give him to drink or <U+017F>uck of, from time to time day and night.</p>

                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:40248:104"/>During the time of the Critical Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, you may give him every <U+017F>ix days two or three grains of the volatil Salt of Vipers, di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in a little of the Ti<U+017F>anne de<U+017F>cribed before; and you may prefer this <U+017F>ame Remedy before all the Treacle, Philo<U+017F>ophical, and Sudorifick Waters, from whence <U+017F>ome Authors do promi<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch fal<U+017F>e wonders.</p>

                        <hi>1.</hi> The Cau<U+017F>es of the Death of <U+017F>ome that are infected with the Pox, and the Cau<U+017F>es of the Accidents which <U+017F>ometimes happen after the Application of Mercury. <hi>2.</hi> What are tho<U+017F>e Accidents. <hi>3.</hi> General Remedies that <U+017F>erve to put a <U+017F>top to their Violence. <hi>4.</hi> Particular Remedies for the Cure of them.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. THough the Pox be not a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e mortal of it <U+017F>elf, and I hold it curable in all its degrees, it is true ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s that Men may dye of it (as I have <U+017F>aid before) when its matter hath corrupted or de<U+017F>troyed the parts without which there is no living; when one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it hath fallen into the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py practices of Ignorants and Impo<U+017F>tors: La<U+017F>tly when carele<U+017F>s Phy<U+017F>icians do not <U+017F>oon enough remedy the Accidents which <U+017F>ometimes happen after the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Mercury.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:40248:105"/>Not but the precepts which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are almo<U+017F>t infallible, for curing this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e <U+017F>uddenly, ea<U+017F>ily, and <U+017F>urely, and hardly can they fail in one of a thou<U+017F>and, when they are regularly ob<U+017F>erved. But there are <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>mal Circum<U+017F>tances, which it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to remove. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides that Men are nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily mortal, the true Cau<U+017F>e of their Death is often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, the time of it cannot be avoided, and the Cacochymie of bodies is now &amp; then <U+017F>o very great, that it cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly receive Correction; to which may be added that there are <U+017F>ome inward Di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itions, which can no way be known, or there is no po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of taking away. Whence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of this undertaking is not always <U+017F>o hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as we could wi<U+017F>h, and Accidents may indeed happen which could in no wi<U+017F>e be expected, to which neverthele<U+017F>s we ought to adhibite Remedies with all manner of care and exactne<U+017F>s, which are things greatly nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary in all Occa<U+017F>ions where Life and Death are concerned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now though all the<U+017F>e Cau<U+017F>es are of the <U+017F>ame con<U+017F>equence, it would be but a vain attempt to deliver the means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troying them all, <U+017F>ince that <U+017F>ome of them
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40248:106"/>
cannot be known, and others cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be removed. It may be <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omething of the ill Tempers of Bodies, and the too great quantity of Mercury which may be made enter into them, becau<U+017F>e they are the u<U+017F>ual Cau<U+017F>es of all the Accidents which follow its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and there are none but may happen by rea<U+017F>on of them. For when all the things that cool and moi<U+017F>ten have been u<U+017F>ed to no purpo<U+017F>e for quenching the Fire, and correcting the dryne<U+017F>s of an extraordinary Melancholick body, there is often found to follow a loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s accompanied with un<U+017F>ufferable gripes &amp; pains, and which <U+017F>oon leaves a con<U+017F>tipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on behind, that cau<U+017F>es an Inflammation of the Entrals, Bre<U+017F>t, Throat, and Mouth, with difficulty of Breathing, Swallowing, and Speaking; which Symptoms <U+017F>oon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a Fever, that in a <U+017F>mall time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes violent enough, to <U+017F>ublimate the Mercury up to the Brain, and thereby cau<U+017F>e Swoonings, Phren<U+017F>ies, Convul<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and very often Deafne<U+017F>s, and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, Apoplexies, and Pal<U+017F>ies, or la<U+017F>tly Death it <U+017F>elf, if care be not <U+017F>uddenly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to prevent it, by due applying fit Remedies again<U+017F>t this train of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:40248:106"/>In like manner if the Dyet, drying Decoctions, and <U+017F>trong Sudorificks have not been u<U+017F>ed <U+017F>ufficiently to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient alteration of a very Phlegmatick and replete body, or el<U+017F>e if Mercury hath been applyed in too much ha<U+017F>t, it will <U+017F>ublimate along with it all on a <U+017F>udden, <U+017F>o great a confluence of Humours that the mo<U+017F>t part of the Accidents I now reckoned up will al<U+017F>o appear, but more particularly an extraordinary Swelling of the Throat, Tongue, Cheeks, and often of all the whole Face, with con<U+017F>iderable hardne<U+017F>s, and loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of Teeth, and with an immoderate Flux of Blood from the Ulcers of the Mouth, which in a <U+017F>hort time become great, <U+017F>preading, black, <U+017F>tinking, and gangren'd, and which do at la<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e Death, if a Suffocation don't prevent their malignancy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In all the<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>erable Conjunctures the be<U+017F>t means to be u<U+017F>ed do con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in hindring the Activity of Mercury, in the diminution of its quantity by change of Bed, Linnen, and Chamber, and in the precipitation of the re<U+017F>t downwards by a<U+017F>tringent Gargari<U+017F>ms, Cly<U+017F>ters, Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomies in the Foot, and e<U+017F>pecially by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated Purges, in which you mu<U+017F>t
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40248:107"/>
be <U+017F>ure always to mix the Salt of Tartar, proportionating the re<U+017F>t of the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients to the Age, Strength, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of your Patients.</p>
                  <p>Some do make u<U+017F>e of a Golden Pill, which they cau<U+017F>e to be <U+017F>wallowed <U+017F>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al times after as many Lotions, and which always indeed carries off <U+017F>ome very little Mercury on its Superficies; but it is <U+017F>o very <U+017F>mall a quantity for <U+017F>o long a time, that no great effect can be expected from it, and its u<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t by no means hinder that of the former Remedies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. After having thus provided again<U+017F>t all the<U+017F>e Accidents in general, by the means that I have propo<U+017F>ed; 'tis time to think of <U+017F>uch as demand particular Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectives, and apply Cupping-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es with <U+017F>carifications on the nape of the neck, or on the <U+017F>houlders, for all Phren<U+017F>ies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul<U+017F>ions, Apoplexies, Deafne<U+017F>s, Blindne<U+017F>s, and in general for all Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of the Brain and Nerves.</p>
                  <p>A Gargari<U+017F>m made with a Decoction of Plantain, red Ro<U+017F>es, and Agrimony in which you mu<U+017F>t drop a little Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, will prove a<U+017F>tringent enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Blood or Phlegm that runs out of the Mouth, and deter<U+017F>ive enough to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40248:107"/>
clean<U+017F>e the Ulcers which <U+017F>hall be toucht from time to time with the Chymical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits before named.</p>
                  <p>It is ob<U+017F>ervable, that this <U+017F>ame Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>m may al<U+017F>o <U+017F>erve to <U+017F>trengthen the loo<U+017F>e Teeth, by clo<U+017F>ing of the Gums, which neverthele<U+017F>s may be much better fa<U+017F>tned by touching them with the <hi>Aqua <U+017F>ecunda.</hi>
