         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the few Grains of my Knowledge and
Care to be put into the Scale of your Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure,

Princes Coin, the which after having once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

This Tract well de<U+017F>erves the <U+017F>tudy and
practice of a young Chirurgion, who ought to read
it <U+017F>oberly, and practi<U+017F>e it constantly. Whoever

as judgment to guide his hand. I have here acted

The Tract is not like a gay Tulip, clothed and tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

Winds to breathe on it, I que<U+017F>tion not its well
<U+017F>ailing, and may be kept off from the Shelves and
Rocks of others, who make it their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to pa<U+017F>s
an unhappy Cen<U+017F>ure, although not capable to pa<U+017F>s
Examination them<U+017F>elves. By <U+017F>ome it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that this my Care and Pains may look like
Flowers pluck'd from others Gardens. The Bees
admirable Work is not to be di<U+017F>commended or
thought the wor<U+017F>e of, nor the Honey the meaner,
for its <U+017F>ucking or extracting the <U+017F>ame from the
<U+017F>weet Flowers of any mans Ground. I here have
been more plentiful in Authorities, becau<U+017F>e very
few of our younger Brethren have a will to read
many or great Volumes, while<U+017F>t greater Masters
have le<U+017F>s time or lei<U+017F>ure. To you al<U+017F>o who are of the
lower Form in Practice, this Tract doth chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
it being as a guide to direct you in your whole
cour<U+017F>e of treating Tumours both general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
from head to foot; my reque<U+017F>t to you is, if
you find any thing worthy Collection or your In<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
accept it with an amicable Hand; and if
you give it the time of a Survey, play not the part
of a Waterman, who <hi>Dum aliud proponit, aliud
<U+017F>upponit.</hi> Let every man <U+017F>tudy his Art quietly and
peaceably, that he may profe<U+017F>s it openly and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
then may be expect it to have it guarded
with the Lion and Crown, and encouraged by
Royal Charters and Princely Privileges. I hope
this Tract will meet with a Gentlemans Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who<U+017F>e Soul is drawn out to his Fingers ends,
who can pardon an imperfect Draught, and
where he meets with too deep Shadows, can with
<pb facs="tcp:43322:6"/>
a light Hand and finer Pencil le<U+017F><U+017F>en its dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.
It may be well reckoned amongst Vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
in our days, wherein the Mi<U+017F>ts of Ignorance
are very plentiful, the Evening of Knowledge
appearing but through a <U+017F>mall hole, and the dark
Clouds of Folly ob<U+017F>tructing our Light of Rea<U+017F>on;
and hence is it that the Light which we enjoy is
<U+017F>o variou<U+017F>ly refracted by the glittering Vices of
our times, and looks much disfigured by the Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es
of Humour and Fancy. If this may an<U+017F>wer expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I am happy; if it be di<U+017F>liked by <U+017F>uch who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do mea<U+017F>ure another mans actions by number,
than by either order or weight, I am not troubled,
knowing it to be a common failing of <U+017F>ome to be
tempe<U+017F>tuous in Temper, and trouble<U+017F>om either in
Judgment or De<U+017F>ire, as to hate any thing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
them<U+017F>elves perform, or yield or lend a good
look to another mans Labours, becau<U+017F>e they were
not chri<U+017F>tned by their Name, be they never <U+017F>o law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
good, advantageous, or honourable: To the<U+017F>e
and <U+017F>uch others I offer this as a Conclu<U+017F>ion; let us
all study to be quiet and peaceable, and to do our
own bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s for publick and private good, to
work with our own hands <U+017F>uch things as may gain
afair repute and good name here, and a happy
reward from Heaven hereafter; then <U+017F>hall our
pre<U+017F>ent actions <U+017F>mell like the Ro<U+017F>e, and Eternal
Bli<U+017F>s <U+017F>hall crown our end. And as I have in this
Tract <U+017F>tudied to be profitable to thee, <U+017F>o let thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
be to help others.</p>

To under<U+017F>tand the nature and e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of
a Humour, is and ought to be the work,
<U+017F>tudy, and care of a Chirurgion, as well
as a Phy<U+017F>ician; there being no di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e

confu<U+017F>ed ma<U+017F>s of Humours. It his hence
that all Tumours, Wounds, Ulcers, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tulaes,
and their differencies have their
acknowledgments and di<U+017F>tinctions; the
which is the only cau<U+017F>e which makes

to the tempering of the Blood, that
is, to the correction of tho<U+017F>e Humours
which are the occa<U+017F>ion of the<U+017F>e Tumours.
By Phy<U+017F>icians a Humour is taken for a
thin and liquid body,<note place="margin">What a hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mour is.</note> flowing and crui<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Human.</hi> Of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome are natural, <U+017F>ome
not natural. Tho<U+017F>e called natural, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
<U+017F>o ordered according to nature, for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43322:27"/>
keeping, defending, <U+017F>u<U+017F>taining, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hing
the life of man: Tho<U+017F>e counted
otherwi<U+017F>e, which act contrary to the
rules of nature, and have unnatural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
The one again being either alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
proper for life and growth of the
body; the other excrementitious more
proper for clean<U+017F>ing its <U+017F>inks and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.
As the Humour is, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<U+017F>een its Colour: for as Blood is of a
pure florid ro<U+017F>y colour, <U+017F>o doth it give
colour to the Mu<U+017F>cles: It is this that
graceth the cheeks, by affording them a
a <U+017F>hare of its redne<U+017F>s: and as it is made
of Chyle and Blood, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o doth it <U+017F>end
forth its white and red; and by how
much the red exceedeth the white, by <U+017F>o
much are the Mu<U+017F>cles more red than the
Skin. Choller is citrine and yellow, thin
and griping; and as the four Humours do
work man into a good humour, <U+017F>o this
burneth him into a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion: it gives a
lively paint of its colour in the Jaundies.
Flegm is white and wa<U+017F>hy, and <U+017F>o are
they that have too much of it, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cold and <U+017F>ubject to Oedematous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
Drop<U+017F>ies and Agues. Melancholy is
black and masketh the whole body with
an A<U+017F>hy colour; this is long and tedious
in executing its office, it being the mo<U+017F>t
heavy an d<U+017F>ad part of the blood; but at
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43322:27"/>
length bringeth forth the terrifying Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula,
Corroding Cancer, Scirrhous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
Quartane Agues and the like: and
we daily find, when it hath hatched them
up to any growth, it is very long, if
ever, before it be made to part with
them. Be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e there are two others:
one a <U+017F>erous Humour which <U+017F>erveth as a
vehicle to the blood, ordered by nature
for thinning it, that it may pa<U+017F>s to its
<U+017F>malle<U+017F>t capillary ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. Part of this is
<U+017F>ucked up by the kidneys, where having
made a <U+017F>hort <U+017F>tay it maketh its further
progre<U+017F>s into the bladder, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
whil<U+017F>t it be loaded; the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therewith filled, is let out as u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s
and unprofitable. Be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e comes
Wind taking its circuits and turns, and
in our bodies is occa<U+017F>ioned and bred by ill
dige<U+017F>tions, crudities, and wind: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
making watery Tumours, whil<U+017F>t this
maketh <U+017F>latuous Tumours. But that we

from hence is carried into the left ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

and made pure blood, <U+017F>weet of ta<U+017F>te, and

dewell together, <U+017F>o do they a<U+017F><U+017F>imulate

from choller, the fury of the gall:
Thirdly of <hi>Oedema,</hi> coming from Flegm,
the proper in<U+017F>truments of the joynts:
Fourthly of a <hi>Scirrnus,</hi> bred of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
the lumpy and terrene ma<U+017F><U+017F>e of the
re<U+017F>t. Of every of the<U+017F>e are bred various
Tumours, according to their various

and the well timing of Tumours is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

double intention; the one prohibiting
Fluxion, whil<U+017F>t the other cure is wrought
by di<U+017F>charging the matter already flown;
becau<U+017F>e removing of cau<U+017F>es do hinder

breathing of a vein is very proper; whil<U+017F>t

               <p>IN this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e we have many things
do offer them<U+017F>elves to our con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
As when there is a fulne<U+017F>s, Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is in u<U+017F>e; and here is to be let out
as much as is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary: If there be a
Plethory <hi>Quoad vires,</hi> here it is to be
repeated. And as touching the part which
is to have the lancet exerci<U+017F>ed on it,
whether from above or below, this al<U+017F>o
is to be minded and regarded; becau<U+017F>e
Derivation, which Evacuation from the
adjacent part doth not, agrees in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the cure; becau<U+017F>e this would
make the Fluxion larger, and the Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the part affected greater. And
if we will make Revul<U+017F>ion aright,<note place="margin">Note.</note> we
ought well to under<U+017F>tand the place of
Fluxion, that we may happily revell in
the oppo<U+017F>ite part: Thus if the right kidney
be hurt, we open a vein in the left arm;
in Tumours of the groin <hi>vena Popli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>
And if any may que<U+017F>tion our mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between the upper and lower parts,
<hi>Galen</hi> him<U+017F>elf giveth them this an<U+017F>wer:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43322:43"/>
All the parts above the navel, including
the Liver and Stomack, are called the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
parts; and thus have we one part
of the <hi>vena Cava</hi> called the a<U+017F>cendent
Trunk: the other below the<U+017F>e are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called the lower parts. This knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
difference between Repul<U+017F>ion, Revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion,
and Derivation is not very ea<U+017F>ily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied;
I <U+017F>hall thus endeavour to loo<U+017F>en it.
Fluxion ari<U+017F>ing from Expul<U+017F>ion <U+017F>howeth
expul<U+017F>ion: if it followeth from the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of matter, this is either to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
or evacuated; and hence ari<U+017F>eth
this twofold intention, Revultion and
Evacuation. This being out, another thing
is to be ob<U+017F>erved, the matter that <U+017F>lows
hath three places, one from whence it
floweth; the <U+017F>econd whither, and this is
to the part affected; and thirdly through
what parts, before it arrives hither. The<U+017F>e
being found out, we are to con<U+017F>ider how
to di<U+017F>charge this matter, and thereby
prevent its further <U+017F>preading; <U+017F>econdly
we are to prevent the Fluent matter,
which hath got pa<U+017F><U+017F>age into the channels,
that it flow not to the part affected,
and <U+017F>o run this al<U+017F>o into a Tumour. And
the well con<U+017F>ideration of the<U+017F>e may well
make us u<U+017F>e <U+017F>tudy, where, and when
to make this Revul<U+017F>ion; and where to
make evacuation. And in both of the<U+017F>e
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43322:44"/>
we are to ob<U+017F>erve <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Rule,<note place="margin">Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes his Rule.</note>
that all be done <hi><U+017F>ecundum rectitudinem:</hi>
and this is to be performed two waies,
as by comparing the left with the left,
and the right with the right; for with
the<U+017F>e there is held a proper con<U+017F>ent. Thus
the Liver vein hath a rectitude with
tho<U+017F>e veins which a<U+017F>cend up to the head.
Thus upon an immoderate Flux at the
right no<U+017F>tril by applying a cupping gla<U+017F>s
to the Region of the Liver, the Flux doth
<U+017F>uddenly <U+017F>top; if the left, by applying
one to the <U+017F>pleen doth work and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the <U+017F>ame effects. <hi>Galen</hi> hath al<U+017F>o
two <U+017F>pecies of Revul<U+017F>ion, the one from
the upper parts to the lower, from the
right to the left; the <U+017F>econd not <U+017F>o exact,
which we u<U+017F>e when the matter is much,
and threatens danger. <hi>Galen</hi> al<U+017F>o in di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>es
of the upper parts doth revel by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
the upper veins, as in Tumours
of the head he doth order the Cephalick
vein to be opened: and <hi>Falloppius</hi> <U+017F>aith
in a Squinancy he hath breathed the left
arm, and the Humour pre<U+017F>ently vani<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and in <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>es this is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
In Tumours of the Axillaries being
venenate, if we <U+017F>hould open the lower
veins we mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equently draw its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
inwards to the heart; and <hi>vice
ver<U+017F>a,</hi> if we <U+017F>hould open the upper veins
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43322:44"/>
in a pe<U+017F>tilential Bubo, we may well make
a free pa<U+017F><U+017F>age for the pe<U+017F>tiferous matter
to make its addre<U+017F>s to the heart, which
is not onely a great fault in the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion,
but al<U+017F>o as unhappy to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.
And thus have I <U+017F>hown <U+017F>ome of
its benefits. I now come to teach the
young Chirurgion how he is to u<U+017F>e his
Lancet,<note place="margin">How the young Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion <U+017F>hould open a vein.</note> and prepare him<U+017F>elf for this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Fir<U+017F>t let him make a pretty <U+017F>trict
bandage, a little above the elbow of that
arm which he intends to bleed; not too
<U+017F>trict, becau<U+017F>e he will very <U+017F>eldome here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
but meet with ob<U+017F>truction in bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Artery being too clo<U+017F>e girt that
it cannot di<U+017F>charge it <U+017F>elf into the vein.
And as to his Lancet, let him make his
apertion a little <U+017F>loping; or upon placing
it a little obliquely, let him get his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet
into the vein, and <U+017F>o lift it up, not
penetrating too deep, le<U+017F>t he commit tho<U+017F>e
errours which daily are acted by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Pretenders and Quackes, who oft go
<U+017F>o deep, as that they prick an Artery,
and <U+017F>o cau<U+017F>e Aneuri<U+017F>ms and pains. Let
the Orifice that you make, be neither too
great or too <U+017F>mall; the fir<U+017F>t endangering
the Divi<U+017F>ion of the vein, whil<U+017F>t the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
runs it into a Tumour. Here al<U+017F>o is
he to judg of the goodne<U+017F>s or badne<U+017F>s of
the Blood, and <U+017F>o according to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43322:45"/>
may take away more or le<U+017F>s; and
al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>idering the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e,
the <U+017F>trength of the Patient, and
the quantity and quality of the Blood.
The veins which are generally opened
are the<U+017F>e the Frontal vein, one under
the Tongue, the Cephalick, <hi>Mediana</hi>
and Ba<U+017F>ilick; but of every of tho<U+017F>e in their
order, and as nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity requireth. The
Frontel vein is mo<U+017F>t properly opened in
infirmities of the Face, and in pains of
the Head. Two veins of the Temples o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in continual Head-ach, in di<U+017F>tilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Head and Eies. The veins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Tongue in Anginaes, Apoplexies,
pains of the Teeth, the Jugulars, good
in preventing <U+017F>uffocation, Squin<U+017F>ies, A<U+017F>th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes,
Dy<U+017F>pnaea and the like. The three
in the Arm, the fir<U+017F>t being the outward
or Cephalick, this may <U+017F>afely be opened
in di<U+017F>tempers of the head, as <hi>Mania</hi> and
other hot pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions; The <U+017F>econd <hi>Mediana,</hi>
<U+017F>o called in re<U+017F>pect of its Scituation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made both of the Cephalick and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ilick
vein, in opening of this vein is
made a general evacuation of Humours;
this oft times opened in pains of the
brea<U+017F>t, and Pleuri<U+017F>ies. The third is <hi>Ba<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi>
or <hi>Hepatica,</hi> by <U+017F>ome called <hi>Axilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>

beneath the Neck, as the Bre<U+017F>ts, Sides,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43322:45"/>
Liver, Spleen, and Pleuri<U+017F>ies. And this
note of the three in all <U+017F>ickne<U+017F><U+017F>es, and
times, except in time of Pe<U+017F>tilence, That
vein is to be taken, which is mo<U+017F>t full and
large. In the Feet al<U+017F>o are three veins
<hi>I<U+017F>chiatiea, Saphaena,</hi> and <hi>vena Poplitis:</hi>
the<U+017F>e or <U+017F>ome of them are generally open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Ob<U+017F>truction of the Mon<U+017F>trues, in
bringing them down, pains, <U+017F>toppings,
<U+017F>wellings and the like. I <U+017F>hall conclude
this with the<U+017F>e directions. In an Apoplexy
open the Cephalick vein; if this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
not, open the <hi>Mediana:</hi> In a Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
open the Frontal or Cephalick vein:
In a Squin<U+017F>ey tho<U+017F>e under the Tongue: In

&amp;c. Secondly to remove the <U+017F>ubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hereof, and in the fir<U+017F>t, if Plethory,
Phlebotomy is proper; if le<U+017F>s, Pharmacy

may fir<U+017F>t be educed or <U+017F>ent forth being
contrary to the true genus of the part,
and then, if it doth <U+017F>till remain, to alter it.
The mo<U+017F>t proper way to deal with this
is by our later writers found out, which
is by di<U+017F>charging the body hereof by
purging Medicines, which do work both
quickly and <U+017F>afely, ordering the <U+017F>trength
of the Medicine according to the vigour

to Laxity and Intemperiety of the part,
and pain. This Intemperiety is therefore
fir<U+017F>t to be removed, by running it into
a better temper. And this may be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

               <p>THE knowledg of the<U+017F>e times are
very proper for our Diagno<U+017F>is,
Progno<U+017F>is, and Cure. They are four in
number, Beginning, Augment, State, and
Declination. That time mo<U+017F>t properly
called the Beginning, when a part begins
to tumefy: thus if a Tumour be made in
a recipient part, Expul<U+017F>ion and Repercu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
is the Intention; and this Repercu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion
is nothing el<U+017F>e but Illi<U+017F>ion and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul<U+017F>ion
of the Humour, which floweth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the whole body or <U+017F>ome part
thereof into the affected part. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul<U+017F>ion
is a double motion from the part
hurt, and from another part <U+017F>ending to
this hurt part. And here we are to advi<U+017F>e,
that when members are loo<U+017F>e and <U+017F>oft,
then are we to <U+017F>trengthen with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
of a contrary affect,<note place="margin">Ob<U+017F>ervat.</note> that is with
<U+017F>uch Medicines as are compact and dry.
<hi>Gal. 14. Meth. cap.</hi> 17. <U+017F>aith that pure
cold things do repel, as cold water; and
he there adds that others which are not
cold yet are re<U+017F>tringent, as <hi>Mint, Ro<U+017F>es,
Wormwood</hi> and the like, and the<U+017F>e he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43322:50"/>
<U+017F>aies do repel: the<U+017F>e for the mo<U+017F>t part
are to be u<U+017F>ed in the beginnings of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
but not alwaies in every kind
of Tumour; For experience teacheth us
that in Pe<U+017F>tilential or Venereal Buboes,<note place="margin">Ob<U+017F>ervat:</note>
if in the beginning we <U+017F>hould apply
repelling Medicines, we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>end the
peccant matter to the heart.<note place="margin">In 6 ca<U+017F>es no Repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to be applied in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:</note> In the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ix

as if it be bred by a venenate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and repelling here you <U+017F>oon do <U+017F>hut
up the doors of life. If the matter be cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
yet this doth not alwaies deny
Repul<U+017F>ion; for in a violent Fever, in which
it happeneth that the matter doth <U+017F>end
it <U+017F>elf to the membranes of the brain, in
this critical ca<U+017F>e the Fluent matter is to
be repelled, le<U+017F>t otherwi<U+017F>e the brain
becometh inflamed. And then when this
Tumour happeneth either in a Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
or Plethorick body. When the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<U+017F>loweth to the emunctories, we are
not to repel, as <hi>Galen</hi> advi<U+017F>eth 6. <hi>de

into which this Tumour hath got footing
groweth weak, as <hi>Galen</hi> al<U+017F>o hath it,
<hi>Meth. 13. cap.</hi> 7. And la<U+017F>tly when pain
and exa<U+017F>peration of the part is pre<U+017F>ent,
for then Anodynes are more proper, as
<hi>Galen</hi> citeth 6. <hi>de Comp. Medic.</hi> the<U+017F>e I
have formerly <U+017F>hown you in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies

more proper place to bring them into, I
have al<U+017F>o here given you their brief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition,
and in all other cau<U+017F>es we may
and ought to come to u<U+017F>e Repellers in
the beginning of Tumours. <hi>Avicen</hi> <U+017F>peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of repelling Medicines ordereth us
not alwaies to u<U+017F>e one <U+017F>ort or kind

and in hot ca<U+017F>es to u<U+017F>e cooling
Repellers. Now if pain ari<U+017F>eth in the

the<U+017F>e being of a <U+017F>ufficient capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

I <U+017F>hall follow <hi>Guido's</hi> method in the cure
of Inflammations;<note place="margin">Of the cure of a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
                  </note> as fir<U+017F>t by removing

it <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>o to the di<U+017F>charging of the
peccant matter: And for this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
four methods,<note place="margin">Four me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to four times by Guido.</note> according to the
four times; and whereas a Phlegmon
hath a Beginning while the Blood is now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
an Augment when in its Flux it is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43322:58"/>
made hotter, a State when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into <hi>Pus</hi> or Matter, and a Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
when the Inflammation is dige<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
re<U+017F>olved, and the Tumour dimini<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
So al<U+017F>o the four Intentions <U+017F>hall be
the<U+017F>e, fir<U+017F>t in having a re<U+017F>pect to the
order of diet, <U+017F>econdly to hinder the Flux
of Humours, thirdly to di<U+017F>charge the
Matter, and then la<U+017F>tly to correct and
amend the Symptoms. The fir<U+017F>t doth
con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in moderating the Air, and this
more properly in a long inflammation:
the <U+017F>econd is ea<U+017F>e and quiet, becau<U+017F>e too
much motion heateth the body: the
third is watching and <U+017F>leep; for as the
one doth put our bodies into action, <U+017F>o
the other doth refre<U+017F>h and cool them:
the fourth and la<U+017F>t is order of diet: a
fifth may be added, which is retention
or inanition of excrements; for hard and
dry excrements do ob<U+017F>truct, and hence
are bred <U+017F>harp and malign vapours,
which do cour<U+017F>e through the whole
body, and do render the inflammation
more dangerous; and then actions of
the mind may take a part here al<U+017F>o. The
whole cure may be performed by Diet,
Pharmacy, and Chirurgery. Diet for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
Inflammation of <U+017F>uperfluous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and their generation, and making

accompanied with many other
Tumours, bred al<U+017F>o from this Humour
as <hi>Herpes miliaris, Herpes exedens,
Pustulae</hi> and the like. There is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allowed three <U+017F>orts of Choller,<note place="margin">Natural:</note> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
unnatural, preternatural. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is that fourth part of the Blood,
which hath a hot and dry temper in it,
being of a reddi<U+017F>h yellow colour, and
bitter-<U+017F>weet in ta<U+017F>te, much like to<U+017F>ted
honey. This is one of the natural Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<U+017F>o called for a double cau<U+017F>e, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
they perfect natures work, and
are as vehicles for nutriment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation
of the body; for if man were
without blood he could not be nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if without Spirits he could not be
<U+017F>aid to live; and were it not for this
natural bilious Humour man would <U+017F>oon
<U+017F>well into a Drop<U+017F>y.<note place="margin">Second not natural.</note> A <U+017F>econd <U+017F>ort here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

yeilds no perfection to the body, its
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance being altogether unfit for this
office of nutriment, this hath in it no
bitterne<U+017F>s or <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s: of this <U+017F>ort is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43322:66"/>
that of the bladder of the Gall; and
<U+017F>hould this contain any <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s in it
it would <U+017F>oon fret the guts into pieces;
and be<U+017F>ides this, daily experience <U+017F>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it is free of all Acidity, for it dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth through the Kidneyes into the

this Que<U+017F>tion in the Phy<U+017F>ick Schools hath
been very oft times controverted.<note place="margin">Que<U+017F>t.</note> Was
not this Humour framed and ordered
for deterging the capillary ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, that

<U+017F>o the Blood hereby con<U+017F>equently there
made?<note place="margin">An<U+017F>w.</note> But this con<U+017F>equence may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
readily denied, for the Chyle does
never reach the Liver; and this may
appear different from the other, in that
it is not <U+017F>o natural.<note place="margin">Third pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural.</note> There is a third
<U+017F>ort hereof different from both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
being neither good to help the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in its nouri<U+017F>hment, nor yet <U+017F>o mild
as unnatural; which although it do not
nouri<U+017F>h the body, yet doth it not offer
any mi<U+017F>cheif to it; this is both unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and unnatural, and preternatural,
alwaies hurting the body; and <U+017F>o is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
preternatural Choller, which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>per<U+017F>e</hi> and <hi>in <U+017F>e</hi> is apparently <U+017F>o. There
is another <U+017F>ort of preternatural Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
which mixeth it <U+017F>elf with other
Humours, and doth make them wor<U+017F>e;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43322:67"/>
the one having in it Serum and Flegm,
and this is very fit and proper for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truction.
There is a <U+017F>econd <U+017F>ort doth
mix it <U+017F>elf with tough vi<U+017F>cous Flegm,<note place="margin">Its diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies.</note> and
this is called <hi>Bilis vitellina;</hi> and this
doth promote and help forwards ob<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
A third is burnt choller by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture,
and this doth make &amp; frame our
great pains and excoriations, whil<U+017F>t it
doth lodge in the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; and when it
getteth out from hence, is the mo<U+017F>t apt
Author of cancerous Tumours and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick
vlcers. And thus much of the
differencies of Choller. We now arrive
to an <hi>Ery<U+017F>ipelas,</hi> the proper <U+017F>ubject of
this Chapter, and <hi>Guido</hi> doth give that
di<U+017F>temper which adhereth to the <hi>Cutis</hi>

                  </gap> doth as well <U+017F>ignifie near.
And thus may we define it, calling it
<hi>Ery<U+017F>ipelas,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it maketh all its
neighbouring parts red: It is a hot Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
ari<U+017F>ing from the afore<U+017F>aid choller,

A true and <U+017F>imple <hi>Ery<U+017F>ipelas</hi> is bred
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43322:67"/>
of thin, <U+017F>ubtile, hot, and chollerique blood;
and this appearing in any one part of
the body doth form and fa<U+017F>hion this
di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; and becau<U+017F>e it cannot by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on
of its thinne<U+017F>s have any con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence in
the inward fle<U+017F>h, it therefore doth content
it <U+017F>elf with getting into the outward
parts of the cutis, and there it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci<U+017F>e
its terrifying Qualities. You may
know it by its hot <U+017F>igns,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> having belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it a large heat, pain, a red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or rather <U+017F>omewhat turning yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowi<U+017F>h.
But becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e <U+017F>igns are <U+017F>o
near related to tho<U+017F>e of a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Its differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from a Phlegmon.</note> I
<U+017F>hall here make a larger di<U+017F>tinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. And thus it fir<U+017F>t doth differ
from a Phlegmon, in that a Phlegmon
doth apprehend both cutis and <U+017F>ubject
fle<U+017F>h; in this onely the cutis is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Secondly, this is much hotter, for
you <U+017F>ee it appear as it were burnt up by
its bli<U+017F>ters, by how much the choller is
hotter than blood. Thirdly, here is le<U+017F>s
pain. Fourthly, its redne<U+017F>s doth oft times
change into a blackne<U+017F>s or blewne<U+017F>s.
Fifthly, it yeildeth to the touch. Sixthly,
upon the touch the redne<U+017F>s doth vani<U+017F>h.
Seventhly, here is no ten<U+017F>ion. Eightly, it
doth differ from a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> in that it
never doth move from its place; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this <U+017F>preads it <U+017F>elf and encrea<U+017F>es about
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43322:68"/>
its neighbouring parts. That which
doth proceed from yellow choller is mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t;<note place="margin">Prae<U+017F>age.</note>
it is a bad <U+017F>ign if an <hi>Ery<U+017F>ipelas</hi> turns
inwards. In Tumours, Wounds, Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and Di<U+017F>locations, it is generally
held mortal; or if it doth tend to <U+017F>uppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
it is no waies to be accounted a
good <U+017F>ign, neither may it be judged but
very very bad, if it do po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
parts of a bone being bare.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> As
touching its Cure, according to <hi>Galen</hi> in
his <hi>Arte medendi,</hi> whereas it is a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e
encrea<U+017F>ing in a great quantity of
choller, this is to be evacuated, and the
whole Cure performed by diet, Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
and Pharmacy. As to the fir<U+017F>t, we
are to ob<U+017F>erve that the Air be cold and
moi<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o naturally, or made <U+017F>o by Art;
let the Patients diet be cold and moi<U+017F>t,
and as this choller is thin, let him take
<U+017F>uch diet as is cooling and thickning; and
for his broths may very properly be
boiled the<U+017F>e herbs. <hi>Lettuce, Beets,

Chicken-broth here al<U+017F>o is very good,

<U+017F>o al<U+017F>o hath this its various companions
bred of and from the <U+017F>ame Humour;
for from Flegm are bred, <hi>Oedema, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theroma,
Steatoma, Meliceris, Nodi in
Juncturis, Ganglion, Leucophlegmatia</hi>
and the like. This Flegm is the fourth
part of the ma<U+017F>s of Blood, that is, the
colder and moi<U+017F>ter part thereof: and if
it <U+017F>o happen that this doth increa<U+017F>e in
quantity,<note place="margin">What flegm is.</note> the expul<U+017F>ive faculty being
<U+017F>tirred up by the great plenty of this
Flegm, this doth offer very fair to the
generating of an <hi>Oedema.</hi> This Flegm
is cold and moi<U+017F>t, and by <U+017F>ome called
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43322:74"/>
pituitous Blood. And of this there is two
<U+017F>orts, one Alimentary, the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious.
The fir<U+017F>t is the origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

There are of natural or excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
Flegm the<U+017F>e three <U+017F>orts: the
fir<U+017F>t being acid, <U+017F>o called from its ta<U+017F>te;
the <U+017F>econd <U+017F>alt Flegm; the third gla<U+017F><U+017F>y
Flegm, from its coldne<U+017F>s, thickne<U+017F>s, and
toughne<U+017F>s. And if Flegm doth erecede
from its nature by admixing it <U+017F>elf with
Blood, it is called <hi>Oedema Phlegmonodes;</hi>
if with Choller, <hi>Oedema Ery<U+017F>ipelatodes;</hi>
if with melancholy, <hi>Oedema Scirrhodes.</hi>
A great matter hereof is a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Flegm re<U+017F>iding in the body,
cheifly about the extreme parts, as the
hands, knees, or feet, the<U+017F>e being the
mo<U+017F>t remote from the Fountain of heat.
This Flegm is thrown forth from the
greater ve<U+017F><U+017F>els to the <U+017F>maller,<note place="margin">Its genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the which
being there deteined by the thickne<U+017F>s of
the Cutis, is collected in the mu<U+017F>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
parts, and there doth form this Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dematous
Tumour. It is a Tumour <U+017F>oft,
indolent, loo<U+017F>e, yeilding to the touch,
generated from a pituitous matter.<note place="margin">Definition.</note> It
is <U+017F>oft and loo<U+017F>e,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> and the<U+017F>e two come
from the Humour of thin Flegm; indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43322:74"/>
for it neither doth make or cau<U+017F>e
any pain, or di<U+017F><U+017F>olve unity; It gives
way to the touch, and is a white Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teme,
and without heat; white, being
mo<U+017F>t like its object Flegm; without
heat, being like the matter out of which
it is generated, which is cold and moi<U+017F>t.
A pituitous Humour redundant in the
body is the cheif cau<U+017F>e,<note place="margin">Cau<U+017F>e.</note> to the which
a cold and moi<U+017F>t air, a flegmatick diet,

dy<U+017F>cra<U+017F>y both of Head, Stomack, or Liver

that out of Fluxion of Humours <U+017F>ome
are cruel, as Chollerick fluxes, and burnt
Melancholy; and others are more kind,
as this <hi>Oedema:</hi> <U+017F>o this is a tedious and
long di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e it is cold, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
heat being herein very weak. It
is oft times <U+017F>oft, and without pain, and
<U+017F>o carrieth the le<U+017F>s danger; but if it be
hard, and with pain, it is dangerous.
As touching its cure, here ought we
fir<U+017F>t to u<U+017F>e proper means by Retracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Revul<U+017F>ion of the Matter, and
le<U+017F><U+017F>ening of it. Secondly, becau<U+017F>e it is
cold, remove its cau<U+017F>e by implanting
heat and warmth herein. Let the Air
be warm and dry, the Diet attenuating
and drying; here Wine is good becau<U+017F>e
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43322:75"/>
it doth dige<U+017F>t and warm. Let his diet
be of good and light dige<U+017F>tion, as
Chickens, Rabbets, Partridges, and the
like, to which may be added all <U+017F>orts
of <U+017F>pices. Let his <U+017F>leep be moderate;
and let him avoid all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of mind,
and venery, and ob<U+017F>erve that he keep
a good habit of his body. After this
let him u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch evacuations, as may
both attenuate, open, and di<U+017F>charge this
Flegm. Bleeding here is in no wi<U+017F>e to

Our late writers do call this <hi>Scirrhus

de<U+017F>troying <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, lodging in a Member
in that Capacity, as that it produceth
little or no pain: or it may be called a
preternatural Tumour, having no infe<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<U+017F>ymptome. It is by <U+017F>ome called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>tema

It is the onely brat of Melancholy:

an illegitimate Scirrhus; Secondly, when
Melancholy is made preternaturally by
other Humours, it doth take <U+017F>hare of
their qualities; Thirdly, when it is made
thick by too much cooling or drying
of Humours; Fourthly, when it is mixed
with Flegm, Blood, or Choler, then it
maketh <hi>Scirrhus Oedematodes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Burnt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy made four waies.</note> 
                  <hi>Scirrhus
Phlegmonodes, Scirrhus Ery<U+017F>ipelatodes.</hi>
There are four waies al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hown to the
making of burnt Melancholy. The fir<U+017F>t
is made of yellow Choler burnt, and <U+017F>o
repre<U+017F>enting a yellow <U+017F>inder, and doth
burn like it; The <U+017F>econd is made of
thick and vi<U+017F>cid Flegm; The third is made
of burnt Blood, which is very bitter;
The fourth is made of Melancholy Juice,
being both acid and corroding.<note place="margin">How a Scirrhus is made.</note> There
are two kinds of Humours which do
make this Scirrhus; the one being a
Crudity, as Flegm, thick and yet not
vi<U+017F>cid; the <U+017F>econd is vitreous matter, or
a gla<U+017F><U+017F>y <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of Flegm. And hence
may we take a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> either to be
exqui<U+017F>ite, or not exqui<U+017F>ite: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if Flegm be in a great quantity, it
<U+017F>hapeth out <hi>Scirrhus Oedematodes;</hi> if
Choler be predominant, <hi>Scirrhus Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero<U+017F>us.</hi>
Or if you plea<U+017F>e a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is
bred out of a natural melancholy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
which is cold, dry and thick,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43322:79"/>
and from glutinous Flegm;<note place="margin">Its defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and hence
it may be defined a Tumour hard and
indolent, a Tumour proceeding from a
thick and glutinous Flegm, or a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
melancholick Humour. It may be
known by the<U+017F>e Signs, it is a Tumour
without pain,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> hard to touch; if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite,
it is <U+017F>carcely perceived. Every
Scirrhus hath not pain; and this nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>arily
happeneth, becau<U+017F>e it is deprived
of <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. Melancholick Scirrhous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
are generally of a leaden colour,
but a Scirrhus ari<U+017F>ing from a Flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Humour carrieth in it the natural
colour of the Cutis. They take their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Cau<U+017F>es from the beginning of thick
and tough Humours, and collecting
them<U+017F>elves in the parts; and that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ioned
by evil Diet generating a thick
and vi<U+017F>cid Humour,<note place="margin">Cau<U+017F>es:</note> as by rea<U+017F>on of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperieties
of the Liver or Spleen, all
<U+017F>uch cau<U+017F>es may be <U+017F>aid outwardly to
generate thick juices, as a cold or dry
Air, Watchings, <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trues,
and the like. Expect to do no good
on an exqui<U+017F>ite Scirrhus; for this alwaies
is to be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected: If it happeneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Joints,<note place="margin">Pre<U+017F>age.</note> Knees, or the<U+017F>e remote
parts, be not too forward to undertake
them. If it be exqui<U+017F>ite and not turning
Cancerous, yet it is hard to cure: for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43322:79"/>
fir<U+017F>t, the Matter is dried up; and then
cold and compact, and <U+017F>o tedious; and
that which is lapidous gives no way to
Medicine.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> As to the cure, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
cau<U+017F>es are fir<U+017F>t to be removed, by
choo<U+017F>ing a thin Air, hot and moi<U+017F>t, free
from Fogs and Mi<U+017F>ts; let the Patient
<U+017F>hun thick, leguminous and cold Diet;
let his Drink be Wine to help forward
Dige<U+017F>tion, and warm the parts; and let
him get him<U+017F>elf clear of all pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions
of the mind. After this are we to take
care to remove the inward cau<U+017F>es, by
preparing the Humour with Syrup of
<hi>Apples, Buglo<U+017F>s, Fumitory, Hy<U+017F><U+017F>op, Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,

done, we are to purge this melancholick

is not to be defended; for if Chyle be

for Blood to turn into Chyle.
And <U+017F>uch as do <U+017F>tand up for the Chyle
to be the onely <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Milk,<note place="margin">How milk is made.</note>
they do offer this as their a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion, that
the Chyle doth immediatly pa<U+017F>s through

that it is there received into the Veins,

<U+017F>hould conduct this to the Lactiferous
ve<U+017F><U+017F>els is not yet arrived at. Our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<hi>Wharton's</hi> opinion is, that Milk is
peculiarly a nervous Juice, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
con<U+017F>tituted for the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the
Milk, but al<U+017F>o for carrying a double
Matter with it, as being both Chyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick,
and Spermatick; and the<U+017F>e two
do breed the greate<U+017F>t part of the Milk,
not immediatly <U+017F>ent from the Ventricle
to the Bre<U+017F>ts by the Milky ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, but
carried by or through the <hi>Ductus chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liferus</hi>
into the <hi>Subclavian,</hi> thence cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed
with the Blood through the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles
of the Heart, and <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth
through the Thoracick Arteries, and in
time of the Mother giving milk it is
refunded into the ample capacity of the
Bre<U+017F>ts, and there do <U+017F>eparate the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous
part from the Chyle, and do
reduce it through the Mammary Veins
into the Meditullium of the body. And
this he offereth as the cheif matter or
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of Milk, and the mo<U+017F>t proper
nutriment for the Infant. And <U+017F>ince we
daily <U+017F>ee the young <U+017F>ucking Babe is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed
by alluring this Milk from its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Bre<U+017F>t by her Nipple, it is very
nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that it <U+017F>hould contain in it
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43322:90"/>
<U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance as may give it <U+017F>atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

thereof doth come from the <hi>Succus ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo<U+017F>us;</hi>
<U+017F>o al<U+017F>o ought it mo<U+017F>t properly
to be derived from hence for the Infant's
nutriment: but thus much as touching
Milk. We arrive now to that which

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43322:92"/>
of this Humour; and purge

All the<U+017F>e or any of the<U+017F>e may be
u<U+017F>ed in the beginning of a Cancer, when
it is but <U+017F>mall; but if it hath arrived
at a greater bulk and largne<U+017F>s, this as
<hi>Galen</hi> directeth <hi>cap. 10. lib. ad Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>
is not to be dealt with, unle<U+017F>s by
Amputation: and this I think in no wi<U+017F>e
may be <U+017F>aid to come under the name
of an exact way of cure; becau<U+017F>e it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yeildeth the part its native Heat,
but taketh away with it the <U+017F>ound as
well as the di<U+017F>affected part. And that
we may proceed more effectually in this
operation when occa<U+017F>ion and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity
may command or oblige it, ob<U+017F>erve with
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43322:94"/>
me the<U+017F>e Rules, being as <U+017F>o many ju<U+017F>t
Guides which will hardly fail you in your
conduct: as fir<U+017F>t, that Cancer which
doth adhere to the Bre<U+017F>t or Bre<U+017F>ts is
very deplorable. Secondly, that which
doth happen in the Head, Neck or Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or al<U+017F>o in the Inguens, all the<U+017F>e
are to be pronounced incurable. <hi>Aetius
cap. 44. lib.</hi> 10. gives this for a rea<U+017F>on,
becau<U+017F>e they creep and get in <U+017F>o deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the fle<U+017F>hy parts, that they are
not to be got out thence. Thirdly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be not thus adherent, yet it
is not without great danger. Fourthly,
a wor<U+017F>e Symptome then any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
which is al<U+017F>o <U+017F>een very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
unle<U+017F>s the Tumour be wholly extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
cured, and cicatrized, it may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grow again in the <U+017F>ame place, or
in <U+017F>ome other place, and <U+017F>o bring a life
full of greif, and a certain di<U+017F><U+017F>olution
of the whole in the end. Ulcerate Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
do require Amputation by rea<U+017F>on
of the great pain and heat they do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with them. And that we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
methodically herein, I <U+017F>hall here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
what In<U+017F>truments are mo<U+017F>t proper

                  <note place="margin">Hi<U+017F>tory.</note> relating to a Maid of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

who being perplexed with a Cancer in
her Bre<U+017F>t which did equal the largne<U+017F>s

who<U+017F>e Bre<U+017F>t I amputated, the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

being a Woman of an undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of the <U+017F>ame. Having made

Draggons blood, Ma<U+017F>tich, and the like,
with convenient Buttons, Pledgets, Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters,

thus performed, by drawing through
two large Needles through the body of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43322:97"/>
the Bre<U+017F>t, armed with Silks cro<U+017F>s waies,
by the help of which I had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to elevate the Bre<U+017F>t for the better
extirpating it and its Radix. The Bre<U+017F>t
being amputated with my di<U+017F>membring
Knife, I with my Fingers expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed all
the Blood from the remote parts: after
this done I applied my Buttons made

then with convenient Bol<U+017F>trings

it being both dangerous and no waies

my fir<U+017F>t dre<U+017F><U+017F>ings, and then applied <U+017F>uch

the which being ablated, I deterged the

a perfect Cicatrice, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
did receive a perfect Cure: But
within 2 or 3 years after, whether by

is a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e compo<U+017F>ed both of a Tumour

that is the thinner part thereof, which
is turned into yellow Choler, whil<U+017F>t the

writeth of one of four years of age who
was afflicted with a Carbuncle in the
middle of his Forehead, with a red Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
accompanied, being black in the
middle, and the whole Face tumefied;
to which was applied a Cau<U+017F>tick to the
black part; and for removing the E<U+017F>char
an Unguent made of Ba<U+017F>ilicon, to which
was added <U+017F>ome Treacle, oyl of Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and the Yolk of an Egg; and to
the whole Tumour was applied a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapla<U+017F>m
of <hi>Arnoglo<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> purging and
bleeding being afterwards pre<U+017F>cribed, a
Ve<U+017F>icatory to his Neck, and a Cordial
ordered for <U+017F>upporting of his Spirits
with <hi>Confectio de Hyacinth.</hi> &amp;c. the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
abated, the Inflammation grew more
remi<U+017F>s, and every thing did <U+017F>eem mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated.
In this ca<U+017F>e the Ve<U+017F>icatory did
perform the greate<U+017F>t part of the Cure
by deriving a great part of this viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Humour. And to every Carbuncle
I think it very proper to apply it to all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43322:104"/>
the neighbouring parts, and not to u<U+017F>e

applied to the Face in its Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are more generally <U+017F>ubject to the

in a Sphacelus not the<U+017F>e onely, but the
Bones them<U+017F>elves become affected. In a
Gangrene the Skin groweth red, by
rea<U+017F>on of its companion Inflammation;
in a Sphacelus it fir<U+017F>t groweth pale,
then livid, and afterwards black. In a

to prevent its growth: in a Sphacelus
its lo<U+017F>t labour then to act or treat any
other waies than by Amputation; for
there is no hope of bringing a dead part

of them; when they lo<U+017F>e their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

affect is called <hi>Syderatio,</hi> as if they were

Cau<U+017F>es of a Gangrene are three. Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periety
of the part, when the tran<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Spirits are ob<U+017F>tructed, and
when both the Heat and Spirits of the
part are <U+017F>uffocated. Sometimes it cometh
by cold, and then is to be di<U+017F>charged
by heat; in Gun-<U+017F>hot Wounds it doth
frequently happen by rea<U+017F>on of large
Contu<U+017F>ions; it is <U+017F>ometimes al<U+017F>o bred by
the carele<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of Phy<U+017F>icians, who in
the curing of an <hi>Ery<U+017F>ipelas</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
do order and pre<U+017F>cribe cold
things, <U+017F>o being in Act and Power, that
they are made capable to de<U+017F>troy the
natural Heat; oft times by defluxion of
Humours, or venenate Pu<U+017F>tles, which
are left uncured; <U+017F>ometimes out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Drine<U+017F>s; other times ari<U+017F>ing

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43322:110"/>
in the beginning of the Nerves. And
<U+017F>ince there is a Mortification and Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of life, and De<U+017F>truction of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Heat,<note place="margin">The univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al Cau<U+017F>es both of Gangrene and Spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celus.</note> let us con<U+017F>ider which way,
and out of what univer<U+017F>al Cau<U+017F>es this
may happen. Mans innate Heat cannot
be <U+017F>upported without a radical Moi<U+017F>ture,
and its Spirits ju<U+017F>tly and in their order
implanted in all the parts of his body;
<U+017F>o that con<U+017F>equently upon hurting or
offering any injury to this radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture
its Spirits al<U+017F>o will be re<U+017F>olved,
di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated and con<U+017F>umed; and therefore
fir<U+017F>t there is an Intemperiety occa<U+017F>ioned
out of the vehement alteration of the
manife<U+017F>t Quality: Secondly out of the
occult Quality a malign and virulent
Sub<U+017F>tance is contracted in the Body:
and thirdly the Parts are thus mutually
affected with an Interception and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation
of the vital Spirits. As to the
fir<U+017F>t,<note place="margin">To the fir<U+017F>t:</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> doth ob<U+017F>erve and offer, that

<U+017F>o that nothing can alter or de<U+017F>troy

Lividne<U+017F>s and Blackne<U+017F>s. Thirdly, the

And la<U+017F>tly, there is no exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e or

thus; If it happen from a fiux of hot

al<U+017F>o, to prevent the further
growth of Inflammation, for opening
the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and making a more free
Tran<U+017F>piration: but in all <U+017F>orts or kinds
of Gangrenes this is not to be u<U+017F>ed; For
in a Cholerick and bilious Humour we
are not to attempt it, Blood being as
the bridle to check and command this
Choler.<note place="margin">6 Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</note> In the ca<U+017F>e of applying of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43322:112"/>
more powerfully, and warm the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
with Defen<U+017F>atives. The <U+017F>econd is
taken from the Age of your Patient;
for in a young body the Fle<U+017F>h and all
its parts are <U+017F>oft and tender, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are you to order and pre<U+017F>cribe mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Medicines than to tho<U+017F>e of a fuller
growth. A third ari<U+017F>eth from the Sex;
a Child being to be treated with more
mildne<U+017F>s and Gentlene<U+017F>s than one of an
elder age, and a Woman more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dealt with than a Man. The fourth
is from the Strength of the Patient; for
you may powerfully exerci<U+017F>e your ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
on <U+017F>uch as are of a good and
<U+017F>trong con<U+017F>titution, whereas you are
more <U+017F>paringly and tenderly to u<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch
per<U+017F>ons as are weak and <U+017F>ickly. The
fifth ari<U+017F>eth from the part affected; for
the Eye, Mouth, <hi>Pudenda, Anus, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebre,</hi>
and other <U+017F>uch <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible parts are
not to be dealt with, as you may deal
with an Arm or Legg. Sixthly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is to be much mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

any deep impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to <U+017F>carrify the part
lightly, and to apply <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> alone
is enough; If it be more powerful and
do threaten a Sphacelus, here is to be

As touching its Cure, in re<U+017F>pect

explained; the one, whereas he calleth it
not only a collection of a Serous Humour,
but al<U+017F>o of a feculent Blood, as when the
Head &amp; Cranium <U+017F>uffers an outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<U+017F>ion
or Colli<U+017F>ion, and the Veins by this
Colli<U+017F>ion do <U+017F>prinkle their Blood between
the Cutis and Pericrane. This Blood here
thus putrifying doth make a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>oft Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
and if a <U+017F>erous aquo<U+017F>ity were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
the which by dayly experience

<hi>Aetius lib. 6. cap.</hi> 1. will have
that a Hydrocephalos may be generated
from a Feculent or bloody Matter, the which
being changed into a thin <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance. A <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of Galens is, that a Hydrocephalos is
a collection of an aquous Humour in <U+017F>ome
part of tho<U+017F>e Bodies, which have a
forcing quality towards the Head; out of

<U+017F>pecies hereof: Fir<U+017F>t, when this Humour
getteth between the Brain and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes:
Secondly, when it lyes between
the Membranes and the Skull: A third
between the Bone and the Pericrane:
And La<U+017F>tly, when between the Pericrane
and the hairy Scalp.<note place="margin">Signs:</note> I have already
<U+017F>hown you part of its Signs; that it is
a Tumour <U+017F>oft in touch, whiti<U+017F>h in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
indolent, turgid, much like a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

it doth appear fir<U+017F>t red, and doth

but being afterwards changed into a
thin <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, it doth <U+017F>pread it <U+017F>elf
without pain. In tho<U+017F>e where it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth

they an<U+017F>wer plainly the re<U+017F>t; for here

the <U+017F>ound Eye being <U+017F>hut, if the other be

On the contrary, <U+017F>uch as have a

Art, the only piece to be admired of all
Chirurgery? And here ought we to

And having given you this as a

this Chirurgick Operation, a lively

both his Body and Head well clean<U+017F>ed,
and all other accidents which may yield
any appearance of ob<U+017F>tructing your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
you are to remove, and then
bind up the contrary Eye, and place the

to turn the Eye towards his No<U+017F>e,
thru<U+017F>ting it near half a <U+017F>trawes breadth
from the Iris into the Cornea; and
having got it <U+017F>afely in, you are to work
it unto the hollow of the Eye; and
when the Needle hath touched the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract
endeavour to pre<U+017F>s it gently with
the Cataract downwards, and this you
are to do <U+017F>o often until you <U+017F>ee the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil

with that <U+017F>trength as to keep it down,
that it may not ri<U+017F>e up again; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your Patient not to <U+017F>tir his Eye;
for if it <U+017F>ticketh below, and returns not
again, you may be confident of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Cure. Then is the Needle to be
brought up again, not to be taken out
pre<U+017F>ently. Upon which done, and your
Needle taken away, clo<U+017F>e up the Eye
with all <U+017F>peed, by applying to the Eye

Operation is made with <U+017F>afety and with
repute; for this In<U+017F>trument doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
cut and draw forth the Polypus,
the which are the three chief intentions
in this Cure. And be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
it keeps and defends all the other
parts of the No<U+017F>e in <U+017F>afety and harmle<U+017F>s.
It apprehends and draws it out without
effu<U+017F>ion of Blood, for it neither cuts nor
divides no other Veins or Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, than
<U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>pread or interwoven into
the<U+017F>e Caruncles, of which this Polypus
is made. I <U+017F>hall, after I have pre<U+017F>ented
you with its commodities, <U+017F>hew you the
exact Figure of this In<U+017F>trument; it cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43322:146"/>
danger. This In<U+017F>trument doth perform
the<U+017F>e Four Intentions, it apprehends,
cuts or <U+017F>eparates it, <U+017F>eparateth its reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
and doth induce a Cicatrice. It
hath an edge to cut, and apprehends
like Forcipes, and therefore is to be made
like a pair of cutting Forcipes: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
and draws forth like Forcipes:
it pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>eparateth the Polypus from
the Bone; and for the la<U+017F>t we only blow
up re<U+017F>trictive Pouder: And thus have I
<U+017F>hown you its Four Intentions. It cuts
inward to prevent all trouble and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and it bringeth this commodity
with it, it <U+017F>howeth to every one appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
what it hath done. In the Cure

and therefore mu<U+017F>t confidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
in <U+017F>ome place, and with ea<U+017F>e
lay its fir<U+017F>t grounds and Foundations
of a Tumour. There is held a great
difference between Strumae and Scrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae;
and by Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> in his Book <hi>De
glandulis,</hi> the one of the<U+017F>e is called by him
Wenns, the other the Kings evil: Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43322:152"/>
<U+017F>ignifying the fir<U+017F>t, and Struma
the latter: Scrophulae are <U+017F>oft, Wenns
hard: the fir<U+017F>t pale, carrying in them
the colour of the Skin, the <U+017F>econd ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a redne<U+017F>s turning to lividne<U+017F>s;
Scrophulae <U+017F>oft and not much penetrating,
Strumae immovable and deeply fixed:
the Kings-evil <U+017F>wellings generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>e
into a great bulk and magnitude;
and be<U+017F>ides their glandulous Fle<U+017F>hes they
do carry in them <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts of Juices
in their little Bags, the which do help
much forward their growth and bulk.
It is credible that the<U+017F>e concreted Juices
are as <U+017F>ome rejected Excrements thrown
from the glandulous Fle<U+017F>h in its nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for the<U+017F>e Glandules have no excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and therefore nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily they
<U+017F>hould carry their Excrements in their
Bags: And this is one rea<U+017F>on of their
growth. Secondly, the Blood effu<U+017F>ed
from hence through the Arteries is more
plentiful, than that which is reduced
through the Veins; and hence therefore
may there ari<U+017F>e another rea<U+017F>on of its
growth. Thirdly, The Nerve which
keepeth here is but <U+017F>mall, and that
makes them <U+017F>o dull; and hence is it that,
were the parts pricked with Needles,
the Patient would not much complain of
pain. Now as touching Strumaes, the<U+017F>e

And by how much the Veins are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
capacitated and enabled to convey

the<U+017F>e Strumatous Tumours le<U+017F>s capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Scrophulated. And how the<U+017F>e Tumours
are tran<U+017F>lated from one place into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I attribute chiefly to the Nerves in
their Operations, the<U+017F>e being mo<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Me<U+017F><U+017F>engers to carry to and fro. Now
if there be any matter carried to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctuory
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els or Glandules, and be
there excerned, the Struma doth <U+017F>oon
le<U+017F><U+017F>en, and <U+017F>ometimes doth wholly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h,

of Hydrargyrical Mêdicines or Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to con<U+017F>ume and wa<U+017F>te away, the<U+017F>e
having in them a very powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of making the Nerves <U+017F>pit forth
their Humidities into the Emunctuory
Glandules. And hence by <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>us</hi>
the<U+017F>e are <U+017F>aid chiefly to ari<U+017F>e in three

When you make your Section, let

Make neither Inci<U+017F>ions, nor apply any

young man about 20 years of age, who
fell into a pleuri<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>o painful that he
could not lie on either <U+017F>ide of his Bed, but
onely walk upwards. Many Remedies
were pre<U+017F>cribed in the Con<U+017F>ultation of
three phy<U+017F>icians, and the patient was let
blood above ten times; yet the Affect
per<U+017F>evered. Although the pain of the
Side <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>eemed to cea<U+017F>e, yet both
his pain returned and a Fever with it.
This Fever continued to the five and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
day, then the Side began to <U+017F>well,
and proved painful to the Touch, <U+017F>uffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
with redne<U+017F>s; it was judged a pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie
turned into an Empyema; and for
this rea<U+017F>on <U+017F>uppurating Catapla<U+017F>ms were
ordered, by which the Tumour might
encrea<U+017F>e its bulk, and the peccant Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
endeavour to di<U+017F>charge it <U+017F>elf. But
the opening of this Side being procra<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
too much, the Ab<U+017F>ce<U+017F>s broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and the Patient did <U+017F>pit out <U+017F>ome
of this Matter with ea<U+017F>e by coughing,
which appeared very laudable, and not at
all fetid; and this he did for many days
in a great quantity. After the Ab<U+017F>ce<U+017F>s
brake outwardly, it was with ea<U+017F>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into either Side, becau<U+017F>e he found
and felt a great pain in the pained Side:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:43322:166"/>
which thing is noted by <hi>Hippocrates in
Prognostic.</hi> Having pa<U+017F>t the eighth day
of its running, this purulent Excretion
cea<U+017F>ed, and he onely vomited up Flegm:
then he perceived the pain again in the
<U+017F>ame Side, <U+017F>o as it turned not to the
<U+017F>ound: then was conjectured that there
was a new Collection of Matter in the
Side, and he being prepared for the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of the <U+017F>ame, the Empyema was
opened by a Cau<U+017F>tick being laid on the
Side, and Matter for a long while came
from the Side, and at length the Patient
perfectly recovered.</p>

               <p>THE Diaphragma hath two <U+017F>orts
of Tumours belonging to it, and
either of them do bring the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in danger of death; the one long, the
other <U+017F>hort: for by the Excrements for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
here they may make a Tumour both
with or without a Fever. If without a
Fever, from the beginning pain and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of breathing, a <U+017F>mall and a hard
Pul<U+017F>e, and the<U+017F>e Excrements we are to
allow to be thin and crude, and thence do
follow a Ten<U+017F>ion of the Bowels, becau<U+017F>e
the Mu<U+017F>cles are extended to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma.
And if a Fever be joyned to
the<U+017F>e Tumours, Experience does <U+017F>atisfie, it
is not <U+017F>harp; and it ari<U+017F>eth from the too
long contention of Excrements in the
part affected. An Inflammation of the
Diaphragma beginning, there nece<U+017F><U+017F>ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
does follow a Fever; and in re<U+017F>pect of
the Affect, becau<U+017F>e the Tumour is made
of hot matters, and in relation to the part
affected by rea<U+017F>on of its near bordering
upon the Heart, there do generally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from this Inflammation, Pain, and
Difficulty of Breathing: and therefore,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:43322:167"/>

Tumour of the Diaphragma is offered to
you for cure, let your fir<U+017F>t Intention be to
di<U+017F>charge the Matter or Sub<U+017F>tance that is
lodged. And becau<U+017F>e the Origination of
this does generally ari<U+017F>e from Fluxion,
this al<U+017F>o is to be prohibited, and this is
done by di<U+017F>charging the fluent Matter.
If you take them in the beginning, they
may give <U+017F>ome hopes of Cure: but if
they be of any long continuance, they
admit of no Cure; becau<U+017F>e they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hurry the Patient into a Con<U+017F>umption,
and will not be taken hold of by the be<U+017F>t
of Medicines.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> As to the Cure, the fir<U+017F>t
Intention is to di<U+017F>charge this Matter by
well purging and clearing the Body of its
Excrements: and here <U+017F>uch things are
mo<U+017F>t proper as can di<U+017F>charge both Flegm

in which pain and difficulty of Breathing,

although they are bred of a thin

                  </gap>. And
here the large Veins which are in the
Groin may <U+017F>o <U+017F>well, and prove <U+017F>o vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous,
that they may create a Rupture
here, <U+017F>o as this proves a Chirurgical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
But before I proceed any further
in this Chapter, be plea<U+017F>ed to con<U+017F>ider
tho<U+017F>e many Errors, which are committed
by unskilful Chirurgeons, who very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
do take Venereal Buboes for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinal
Ruptures, and <U+017F>o do cut for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>tine
without either Wit or Hone<U+017F>ty, or
el<U+017F>e do prejudice to the great Vein there
ordered by Nature, and thereby bring
danger of death. But that you may the
better under<U+017F>tand the difference, con<U+017F>ider
with me, that if you perceive a <U+017F>oft Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in the <hi>Inguen,</hi> from the beginning
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43322:177"/>
you may well <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect a Dilation being
made by the Inte<U+017F>tine; a Bubo in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
being hard, e<U+017F>pecially being Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal.
It being a Rupture, if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
lie on his back, the Inte<U+017F>tine falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with ea<U+017F>e, and the Tumour does
vani<U+017F>h; and upon the Patients ri<U+017F>ing it
returns with as much ea<U+017F>e: In a Bubo
there is always a contained Tumour.
But arriving to the matter of our pre<U+017F>ent
Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, a Bubonocele does mo<U+017F>t gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
gain the name of being the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of an Inte<U+017F>tinal Rupture more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
than the name of a Rupture; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>tine
fir<U+017F>t making its fall through the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
before it enters the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and <U+017F>o
does nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily dilate it: And therefore
<hi>Paulus</hi> <U+017F>aith, that the Inte<U+017F>tinal Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Inguen</hi> does precede a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
el<U+017F>ewhere; for if the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi>
be made inten<U+017F>e in its lower part by
Wind, or any other cau<U+017F>e, and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tine
makes its turgid way thither, being
al<U+017F>o filled with Wind; or by being filled
with Excrements, and thereby forceth it
<U+017F>elf, it makes this <hi>Bubonocele;</hi> the which
by <hi>Paulus</hi> requireth a double method
of Cure, the one being to be performed
by Inci<U+017F>ion, the other by U<U+017F>tion. The
fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e by <hi>Paulus</hi> is thus perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
He cuts upon the tume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Fingers, and <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth through the
<hi>Membrana carno<U+017F>a,</hi> and then makes <U+017F>o

bare, and the Fat al<U+017F>o being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and removed. <hi>Cel<U+017F>us</hi> will have this
done with courage, and the Inci<U+017F>ion to be
made to the middle Coat, which maketh
the <hi>Vagina;</hi> afterwards he with a Probe
does depre<U+017F>s the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and <U+017F>o as
that the Inte<U+017F>tine be compelled inwards;
and having lodged his Probe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed
the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> he by Sutures
does draw the lips of the Wound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the which being done, he takes
out the Probe, and cures the remain as
you do <U+017F>imple Wounds. This is <hi>Paulus</hi>
Method, which is performed by Suture,
binding up only the <hi>Cutis,</hi> as by A<U+017F>triction.
The <U+017F>econd of his, which is performed by
U<U+017F>tion, is both cruel, painful, and terrible,
contracting the <hi>Cutis</hi> by the <U+017F>trength and
force of the Fire, and making a contracted
and hard Ciccatrice, and by this means do
depre<U+017F>s the Tumour, and will not <U+017F>uffer
the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> to lift it <U+017F>elf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
But leaving the<U+017F>e, a well made

not painful, <U+017F>ometimes it wholly vani<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and being compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed it with ea<U+017F>e
returneth into the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and with as
much ea<U+017F>e falls out again with <U+017F>ome
noi<U+017F>e, the Tumour being light, lubricous,
and round. Mo<U+017F>t times the <hi>Ileon</hi> falls
down, yet <U+017F>ometimes the other Guts
come out with it, and do fall into the
<hi>Scrotum.</hi> But this happeneth not by a
<U+017F>imple Di<U+017F>tention of the Peritoneal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s,
but it mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily bur<U+017F>t in all
great Ruptures. This oft times happens
in Children by falling, leaping, vomiting,
coughing, any vehement motion, crying,
concu<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or the like. The <hi>Duodenum</hi>
and <hi>Rectum</hi> cannot fall into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi>
this Anatomy <U+017F>ufficiently maketh good.
The <hi>Jejunum</hi> is tied by the Liver by the
Me<U+017F>eraick Veins, and the <hi>Colon</hi> knit to
the upper parts; and here is no Rupture
without divi<U+017F>ion of the<U+017F>e. The <hi>Caecum,</hi>
becau<U+017F>e it is <U+017F>lippery in the right <U+017F>ide, and
<U+017F>eparates from the re<U+017F>t, does ea<U+017F>ily fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the right <U+017F>ide of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum</hi>

left <U+017F>ide the <hi>Ileon</hi> al<U+017F>o is <U+017F>ubject to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and thus there may be a
double <hi>Enterocele,</hi> one of the <hi>Caecum,</hi>
another of the <hi>Ileon.</hi> This of the <hi>Ileon</hi> is
the mo<U+017F>t dangerous and terrible, becau<U+017F>e
by this is intercepted the di<U+017F>tribution
both of the Chyle and Nutriment, and
the <U+017F>ecretion of the Excrement, which is
the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary office of the <hi>Ileon</hi> as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pre<U+017F>ervation of Life: be<U+017F>ides this an
intolerable pain is excited, and is oft
times inflamed, whence follows a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene,
into who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ympathy of affection
are all the re<U+017F>t of its neighbouring parts
drawn. Here is al<U+017F>o made the <hi>Iliaca
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>io,</hi> after which follows vomiting both
of Chyle and Excrements, this being as
the Harbinger or Forerunner of Death.
Now as touching Dilatation according to
<hi>Avicen</hi> two things are required,<note place="margin">How the Inte<U+017F>tine is to be repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed.</note> the one
a reduction of the Inte<U+017F>tine upwards into

fir<U+017F>t is ea<U+017F>ily re<U+017F>olved, if the Inte<U+017F>tine do

the <hi>Omentum;</hi> others attributed it to
Wind and Humours; but at length it was
concluded, that it was a Fle<U+017F>hy Excre<U+017F>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and for the taking this off there was
a <U+017F>trict Bandage made, the which was
every day contracted or bound clo<U+017F>er,
untill the whole was eradicated; the
which being removed, the Patient reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

               <p>This of <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> is of a
noble and pious Martron in <hi>Germany,</hi> in
whom not onely the Navel it <U+017F>elf, but a
little above the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and <U+017F>ome
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:43322:189"/>
part of the <hi>Abomen,</hi> it hung down dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into a great Bag; in this Bag al<U+017F>o not
onely the <hi>Omentum,</hi> but <U+017F>omewhat of the
Inte<U+017F>tine was contained. Sometimes a
murmuring was there perceived; and
then pain was pre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>ometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
very vehement, otherwhile more
remi<U+017F>s, according to the quantity of
Winds then pre<U+017F>ent. She affirmed to him,
<U+017F>he got this Affect in the time of her
Childbearing. Of the re<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap<U+017F>es
of this <U+017F>ort, of the Navel or <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi>
can be <U+017F>eldom reduced into the
Belly; or if they might be, they are not
there retained without great difficulty;
they produce wonderful troubles to the
Patients that are therewith vexed, when
they by rea<U+017F>on of the weight do draw
their upper parts downwards. For this
purpo<U+017F>e he hath invented a new Bag, by
which this Extuberance may as well as
po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be drawn upwards, and <U+017F>o eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the grieved Patient may bear
the burthen with much le<U+017F>s trouble and
incommodiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s. This is to be made
of a <U+017F>trong doubled Cloth fitted to the
<hi>Thorax,</hi> <U+017F>o as that it de<U+017F>cends no lower
than the fir<U+017F>t Ba<U+017F>tard Rib, and <U+017F>o back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to the <hi>Thorax</hi> from the Region
of the <hi>Omoplates,</hi> making a Ligature on
either <U+017F>ide placed two fingers breadth,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:43322:190"/>
and perforated in <U+017F>everal places, to fit it
the better to the <hi>Thorax.</hi> To this Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is to be annexed this large one
with the Bag, <U+017F>o as it may be lifted up or
taken down, according to the will and
plea<U+017F>ure of the Patient; by the benefit of
which holes this may be done. This Figure

By <hi>Aetius Leonidas</hi> this Aqueous

As touching the Cure,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> all Cau<U+017F>es

the Patient ought to be pre<U+017F>cribed, the

If it ari<U+017F>eth from burnt Melancholy,
it hath a pricking pain, and the Tumour
is inequal, in <U+017F>ome places <U+017F>oft, in others
hard. If the Tumour be not confirmed,
cure it as you do a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> by u<U+017F>ing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollients,

Inci<U+017F>ion is the next remedy; and
this way or method is not void of danger,
the Te<U+017F>ticle being either left in or taken
out. And by the way we are to con<U+017F>ider,
that if any fle<U+017F>hy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance grows about
the Coats or Te<U+017F>ticles, this is wholly and
ab<U+017F>olutely to be taken away in this ca<U+017F>e

to be drawn out and tied, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
inci<U+017F>ed and cauterized: for to leave
any part hereof, does more repre<U+017F>ent the
ignorance of a Quack, than know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of an Arti<U+017F>t; for no Son of Art will
give the advantage of a new growth,
whenas he may well prevent any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance

Now A<U+017F>tringents do <U+017F>atisfie the<U+017F>e

the u<U+017F>e of Inci<U+017F>ion or Cau<U+017F>tick, and here
are we to be very careful in onely caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
the parts where they are thus
twined or twi<U+017F>ted together; after which
done remove the E<U+017F>char, then deterge and

be tumefied, you are to make your Inci<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Groin, and the Membrane is to
be drawn through there with the Te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and after this <U+017F>eparate the dilated
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els from the Coat either with your

tie up the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and cut them off under

               <p>WE arrive now at the Inguens,
where we may meet with the<U+017F>e
four following Tumours, <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo
Venereus, Pe<U+017F>tiferus, Phyma, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethlon;</hi>
of each of the<U+017F>e in their order.
The<U+017F>e Glandules have their proper names
as well as others, and hence is it that
they are called <hi>Bubones,</hi> by us in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
called the Popes eye, in veal and
mutton. They are held to be eight in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and very large. There is held to be a
great commerce between the Nerves
and the<U+017F>e Glandules: for it is very credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the Nerves do conveigh <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
hither, as their excrementitious
<hi><U+017F>uccus,</hi> and al<U+017F>o do <U+017F>end hither any ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veous
quality that at any time doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
them; but they do not unload them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
into the<U+017F>e as into their excretory
ports, but into their adjoyning ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; and
hence it is that they are placed at the
greater divi<U+017F>ion of the ve<U+017F><U+017F>els: neither is
it le<U+017F>s probable, that they take <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
from hence as a nutritive juice,
the which being allured by a <U+017F>imilar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of the Glandulous <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, the

Lymphaducts to pour out their <hi>Lympha</hi>
here, and by the benefit hereof the<U+017F>e
Glandules do <U+017F>eparate one and leave the
other: And this is confirmed by their
<U+017F>weetnes and delicacy, they having a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
with the nutrive Succus. And the
rea<U+017F>on they are <U+017F>o large and numerous is,
becau<U+017F>e the Crural Nerves had need to
have <U+017F>uch large Organes for di<U+017F>charging
their <U+017F>uperfluities. We come now to their
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es with the Affects; the<U+017F>e being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<U+017F>imple or not malign Tumours, or
pe<U+017F>tilential or venereal Tumours. The
Cau<U+017F>es of all which may be reduced to
two. The fir<U+017F>t being the hindrance of
the Circulation of the Blood, and hence
ari<U+017F>eth a Tumour by rea<U+017F>on of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
and impetuous afflux of the Blood
from the heart through the Arteries, and
by rea<U+017F>on of its making no reflux from
the<U+017F>e through the Veins: An evident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
we have hereof in Contu<U+017F>ions of
the Glandules and in their Ob<U+017F>tructions.

now the<U+017F>e are 2 common cau<U+017F>es. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<U+017F>pecial Tumour hath its <U+017F>pecifick cau<U+017F>es

<U+017F>imple Tumour: If from a malign quality,
there ari<U+017F>eth a Tumour being of the <U+017F>ame
nature (as malign;) and thus being either
venereal or pe<U+017F>tilential it occa<U+017F>ioneth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal

to enquire of the efficient cau<U+017F>es of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nreal
<hi>Bubo:</hi> and this poy<U+017F>on oftimes is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated

into the Inguens, as its proper Emunctuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and hence ari<U+017F>eth the<U+017F>e venereal Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes.
The cheif matter of which they are
bred is of a part of thick, cold and vi<U+017F>cid
Humours, which may wel be perceived by
the hardnes, whitenes, ilnes of pain, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the Tumour. Sometimes they ari<U+017F>e
from a hot, <U+017F>harp, &amp; cholerick Humour
with a great pain, and a conjunct heat, and
the<U+017F>e make them <U+017F>o oft to run into Ulcers,
being both virulent &amp; corroding.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> As to the
cure, never-u<U+017F>e dige<U+017F>tives, le<U+017F>t the thinner
part being re<U+017F>olved, the thicker excrement
lyes and encrea<U+017F>eth inwards; much le<U+017F>s
Repellers, for the<U+017F>e do drive the virulent
matter inward; and therefore Attractives
and Suppuratives here only do take be<U+017F>t
place. The Tumour being made ripe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
it with a potential Cautery. As
touching the cure of the whole body,
neither purge, bleed, or keep any order
of dyet. Make your orifice not very large,
but <U+017F>o as you may lodge in it a pretty
hand<U+017F>ome large Tent for di<U+017F>charge of this

peccant Matter, you may keep it open for
20 or 30 dayes according to the greater

di<U+017F>charged, we may both pre<U+017F>cribe purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
bleeding, and a good order of dyet. It
being di<U+017F>charged, clean<U+017F>e it well, fill up
with fle<U+017F>h, and <U+017F>kin it. And thus may
you cure the kinder <U+017F>ort of a Venereal

then in<U+017F>tead of Suppurating Medicines
we <U+017F>hould come to the u<U+017F>e of Cupping

having brought it thus, deterge the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer

and <U+017F>o infected the whole ma<U+017F>s of Blood,
hence were generated many crudities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tead

here they breed the<U+017F>e Tumours we call

Apertion. And to give a better light to
the well ordering and curing of both
<U+017F>orts, let us make an exact Anatomical
Inquiry about the<U+017F>e parts. The<U+017F>e He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoidal

belonging to them to feed them, this
Blood fir<U+017F>t coming from the <hi>Porta</hi> to the
<hi>Anus;</hi> for from the great Branch of the
<hi>Porta</hi> is this carried to the Spleen, and
thence through the Me<U+017F>entery is it <U+017F>ent to
the right Gut. The<U+017F>e Veins are onely
two, ari<U+017F>ing from the <hi>Cava</hi> and the <hi>Porta</hi>
for this cau<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e <U+017F>erve, as do
the other Veins of the Body, for nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the parts with Blood: and thus are
the parts of the <hi>Anus</hi> nouri<U+017F>hed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
(This was a thing unknown to the
Ancients;) and therefore it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
that the Melancholy Blood <U+017F>hould this
way be di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ed; for by this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is Melancholy be<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ed, and the

the<U+017F>e, the<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o are by nature as Scavin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to clean<U+017F>e the feculent Blood, and
make a <U+017F>ound Body; and when therefore
<U+017F>he cannot perform the<U+017F>e, we make our
<U+017F>peedy addre<U+017F>s to Phlebotomy: and the
Evacuations thus made we daily find to
yield great comfort and ea<U+017F>e to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Patient. Be<U+017F>ides, the<U+017F>e not being
kept open, a man having a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:43322:208"/>
of Melancholy Humour lodged in him,
the whole Body will hereby be le<U+017F>s ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to undergo any other Method
which may be pre<U+017F>cribed. And la<U+017F>tly, in
Malign Fevers, being lodged in the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and there putrefying the
Blood, the<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t properly ought to be
opened, being nearer related to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
part, where more good may be
expected than from the Arm. Should
the<U+017F>e be <U+017F>topped, they breed a Con<U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
