         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS to be hop'd that your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will not take it ill, that a Soldier of Fortune here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umes to appear before you; one who, with the Hero of the en<U+017F>uing Hi<U+017F>tory, has been Partaker of the Toils and Fatigues, which are in<U+017F>eparable from the Art of War;
<pb facs="tcp:109100:3"/>
and who con<U+017F>equently, has had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be an Eye-witne<U+017F>s as well of the Amorous Exploits, as Military Atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, perform'd by him in <U+017F>everal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; where either the King's Service, or the Glory of Arms, have call'd for his Pre<U+017F>ence. I have con<U+017F>ider'd with my <U+017F>elf, MADAM, for a long time, about the choice of an Eminent Per<U+017F>on, to whom I might properly Dedicate this Hi<U+017F>torical Commentary, without being able to come to a final Re<U+017F>olution, as to that Particular: And indeed, there are different Motives, which induce Authors to act on the like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ions: For <U+017F>ome do it, with a de<U+017F>ign to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>ome powerful Patrons at Court; others, by way of acknowledgment for Favours already receiv'd; others, only to get the Name of an illu<U+017F>trious Per<U+017F>onage prefixt before their Works; and la<U+017F>tly, others, purely out of a Principle of Candor and Genero<U+017F>ity, without any manner of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation.</p>
            <p>MADAM, I have rea<U+017F>on to boas<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¬Ø</g>t, even without Vanity or O<U+017F>tentation, that I am of the number of the<U+017F>e last; <U+017F>ince it is
<pb facs="tcp:109100:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not to in<U+017F>inuate my <U+017F>elf into your Favour, nor to <U+017F>ollicit you to make u<U+017F>e of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t with the King in my behalf, that I have at la<U+017F>t determin'd to make you a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent of the<U+017F>e Gallantries of the Mar<U+017F>hal <hi>de Boufflers.</hi> I do not (Thanks be to Heaven) <U+017F>tand in need of any of the<U+017F>e, or the like Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; but rather, on the contrary, am in a condition to <U+017F>light the Court-Favours, and to look upon the capricious Events of Fortune with Contempt. The true Motive, that has excited me to Dedicate this Hi<U+017F>tory to your Honour, is the di<U+017F>-intere<U+017F><U+017F>ed De<U+017F>ire I have, to give you <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort of Satisfaction, and to afford you in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure, an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Diver<U+017F>ion for a few moments, in your Retirement at St. <hi>Cyr;</hi> by the Reading of a con<U+017F>iderable number of very remarkable Adventures relating to a Hero, for whom you have a mo<U+017F>t cordial Affection, and who<U+017F>e Fortune you have taken care to advance, by cau<U+017F>ing him to be promoted to the principal Preferments in the Army, and very near, to the highe<U+017F>t pitch of military Glory. Here your Honour may ob<U+017F>erve your Darling-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, ever <U+017F>ince he was able to trail a Pike in the King's Service, till his advancement
<pb facs="tcp:109100:4"/>
to the Dignity of Mar<U+017F>hal of <hi>France,</hi> and even till his Marriage with <hi>Mademoi<U+017F>elle de Grammont;</hi> <U+017F>ometimes expos'd to the greate<U+017F>t Misfortunes that can be imagin'd; and <U+017F>ometimes appearing Triumphant, as it were the mo<U+017F>t fortunate of all Mortals; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of Accidents caus'd by the capricious Humours of the God of Love. Indeed the <U+017F>trangene<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing Events, of which we are inform'd by this not able Hi<U+017F>tory, might at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight, give occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect it to be a kind of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance made at plea<U+017F>ure, much rather than a Narrative of Matters of Fact; were it not that your Honour has divers faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>es to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert the Truth of the various Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences related in it.

            <p>However it may be taken, 'tis evident, that Truth may be di<U+017F>cover'd by certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments, which cannot be hid from the <U+017F>ight of the more judicious part of Mankind; not with <U+017F>tanding the Endeavours that <U+017F>ome Authors have us'd of late, to conceal from the publick View, <U+017F>uch precious Fragments, which give us an <hi>Idea</hi> of the good and ill Fate that attends mortal Men in this <U+017F>ublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary World.

            <p>SOME Per<U+017F>ons who e<U+017F>teem LOVE as the Sweete<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t tender of all other Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, have imagin'd it to be more e<U+017F>pecially appropriated to the Female Sex: But whoever will take the pains to look back into the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, may be <U+017F>oon convinc'd that it has extended its Conque<U+017F>ts, not only over the Fair Sex, but al<U+017F>o over the greate<U+017F>t Men in all Ages; and that even the mo<U+017F>t Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Warriours amid<U+017F>t their dangerous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpri<U+017F>es, have too often felt its effects, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109100:6"/>
been forc'd to <U+017F>ubmit to its Irre<U+017F>i<U+017F>tible Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Let us but look backwards upon tho<U+017F>e great Heroes, <hi>Alexander, Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> and <hi>Pompey;</hi> cou'd the greatne<U+017F>s of their De<U+017F>igns ever make 'em abandon their amourous Intrigues? They <U+017F>carce ever drew their Swords, but with an intent to plea<U+017F>e their Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>ses, and to make them to be <U+017F>harers in their mo<U+017F>t glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Victories. Has not Love been too often the occa<U+017F>ion of Bloody Wars, and of the De<U+017F>truction of whole Countries? Has it not undermin'd and over-thrown the Stronge<U+017F>t Towers? Why then <U+017F>hou'd it be denied that it Sympathi<U+017F>es in a mo<U+017F>t extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with <hi>Mars</hi> the God of War.

He having for <U+017F>ome time entertain'd this noble De<U+017F>ign, his Mind was wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly'd in finding out means how to make a Figure in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> which cou'd not be done without very great expence: The Mar<U+017F>hal, who was born a Gentleman in the Province of <hi>Picardie,</hi> (where Gold is a pretty <U+017F>carce Commodity) was put to a great <hi>non plus</hi> as to this Affair; when one Day walking all alone in his Garden, and mu<U+017F>ing upon his pre<U+017F>ent Circum<U+017F>tances, the <U+017F>ame Friend very <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably <U+017F>urpris'd him; and by offering him his Pur<U+017F>e and all his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, freed him from his pre<U+017F>ent trouble; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal, that by this means he might purcha<U+017F>e the Royal Regiment of Dragoons, which was then to be <U+017F>old by the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

having Care<U+017F>s'd her in a more Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate manner, than became a Brother, he left the Room.

Conformably to this Re<U+017F>olution, he pre<U+017F>s'd her very hard, not to let him <U+017F>uffer any longer, adding, that the Pains which <U+017F>he made him endure, were beyond Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, nay, that they cou'd not be imagin'd by any Per<U+017F>on but one who lov'd <U+017F>o Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately as him<U+017F>elf. <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> <U+017F>eeing what pains the Mar<U+017F>hal took to repre<U+017F>ent to her, his Love, cou'd not forbear laughing at it, when the Mar<U+017F>hal with a Smile told her, <hi>Madam,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It was not without very weighty Rea<U+017F>ons that the Mar<U+017F>hal was <U+017F>o eager, to come to the Conclu<U+017F>ion of the whole Story; for he had but a little time to <U+017F>tay at <hi>Puicerda,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiv'd Orders to March towards the <hi>Rhine</hi> Where: The Counts of <hi>Schomberg</hi> and <hi>Choi<U+017F>eul,</hi> and the Mar<U+017F>hal <hi>de Crequi;</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd to Be<U+017F>iege <hi>Rheinsfeld,</hi> a Place Situated in a Plain. The<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations caus'd no <U+017F>mall commotions in his Mind: Which was divided between the glory of Arms and the delights of Love. But at the pre<U+017F>ent, being oblig'd by his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>ses command, to retire, he did it with <U+017F>o much indifferency, that he not <U+017F>o much as afforded her one part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ki<U+017F>s, which <U+017F>he earne<U+017F>tly wi<U+017F>h'd for, as I have under<U+017F>tood <U+017F>ince. Being return'd to his Lodgings, he took a Re<U+017F>olution not to vi<U+017F>it her in two or three days, in hopes that by this device he <U+017F>hou'd bring her over the <U+017F>ooner, to grant his Reque<U+017F>t. During the time of his ab<U+017F>ence, he employ'd all his Wits in finding out <U+017F>omething or another, which might oblige her to cry for fair Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109100:28"/>
and at la<U+017F>t he obtain'd his aim, as will appear from the <U+017F>equel of the Hi<U+017F>tory.</p>
            <p>Having con<U+017F>ider'd with him<U+017F>elf that all the <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Lady's are extremely taken with the vanity of rich Cloaths, tho' they them<U+017F>elves are not very extravagant that way. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a Suit to be made, the riche<U+017F>t that cou'd be contriv'd; it was trimm'd with Amarant and Gold Colour'd Ribbands (this being the favourite Colour of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s) his Wa<U+017F>te-coat was of the <U+017F>ame Colour, fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embroider'd by a certain <hi>Moore<U+017F>s,</hi> who was very famous for that <U+017F>ort of Work in tho<U+017F>e Parts. He wore a green Feather in his Hat; his Legs being extraordinarily well <U+017F>hap'd, he put on that day a pair of black Silk Stockings, and a pair of very <U+017F>mall neat Shoe's, lin'd with Crim<U+017F>on-Velvet, which was at that time the Mode at <hi>Puicerda.</hi> Whil<U+017F>t he was dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf, he <U+017F>aid to his <hi>Valet du Chambre,</hi> who<U+017F>e Name was <hi>Champonniere,</hi> and who knew the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, <hi>See what a Man is fain to do for a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, wou'd<U+017F>t thou doe the <U+017F>ame for thine? O Yes,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>If I thought <U+017F>he de<U+017F>erv'd it. Thou art in the right on't,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur de Boufflers, he that will plea<U+017F>e the Women mu<U+017F>t take care to appear in a very fine Equipage.</hi> When he was dre<U+017F>s'd, he thought it an Age ere the appointed Hour was come, which was ten a Clock at Night. He walk'd ha<U+017F>tily up and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109100:28"/>
down his Chamber, being in a continual Study concerning his amourous Adventure. At la<U+017F>t the wi<U+017F>h'd for Hour drew near, when with all the <U+017F>peed imaginable he ha<U+017F>tn'd to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Medina</hi> by order from <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him into a certain Appartment, where he had never been before. This Room being adorn'd with very rich Tape<U+017F>try, great Cry<U+017F>tallin Looking Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, and good <U+017F>tore of Wax-tapers; <U+017F>o that any Per<U+017F>ons might view them<U+017F>elves all over from Head to Foot. The Mar<U+017F>hal being for <U+017F>ome time entertain'd by <hi>Medina,</hi> whom he did not know, tho' he had <U+017F>een her before at <hi>Paris;</hi> look'd upon the Tape<U+017F>try-work with a very di<U+017F>cerning Eye, asking her <U+017F>everal times the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divers Figures which he <U+017F>aw, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, concerning that of a certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s, repre<U+017F>ented there with a naked Sword which <U+017F>he was about to deliver to her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for him to Sheath it in her Brea<U+017F>t <hi>What extravagancy is this,</hi> cry'd the Mar<U+017F>hal, <hi>Cou'd any thing be <U+017F>o barbarous, as to run a Sword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Brea<U+017F>t, of <U+017F>o lovely a Woman? Oh! Sir,</hi> reply'd the young Lady, <hi>If you were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the whole Adventure, it wou'd not <U+017F>eem <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange to you. This unfaithful Lady having at <U+017F>everal times prov'd Treacherous in her Love; and being one day all overcome with <U+017F>hame and Confu<U+017F>ion, when he reproach'd her with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109100:29"/>
her perfidiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, at la<U+017F>t <U+017F>natch'd his Sword from his <U+017F>ide, which <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ented to him, begging of him to <U+017F>heath it in her Brea<U+017F>t, to expiate her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer incon<U+017F>tancy. But the Prince who dete<U+017F>ted <U+017F>o Villainous an Act, wou'd by no means comply with her demands. This is <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing to me Madam,</hi> reply'd the Mar<U+017F>hal, <hi>I cou'd <U+017F>carce have believ'd that a Woman cou'd be <U+017F>o Treacherous to her Lover.</hi> He wou'd have continu'd his Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, if he had not been interrupted by the coming in of <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> who appear'd to him as fair as an Angel. She had dre<U+017F>s'd her <U+017F>elf, that day <U+017F>o advantageou<U+017F>ly, that <U+017F>he quite amaz'd the Mar<U+017F>hal by her charms; he for <U+017F>ome time not being able to doe any thing but to gaze upon her. Certain Tre<U+017F><U+017F>es of Hair which hung down to her Neck, were no <U+017F>mall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to her charming Beauty. Her Gown and Petty-coat were of an Amarant and blew Colour, and her Girdle all cover'd with Diamonds of great value. Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Boufflers</hi> being at that in<U+017F>tant more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd than ever, told her very tenderly <hi>that at this moment <U+017F>he had quite <U+017F>ubdu'd his Heart; and that <U+017F>he appear'd to him <U+017F>o charming, that he cou'd not look upon her otherwi<U+017F>e than his adorable Deity. Sir,</hi> reply'd <U+017F>he; <hi>you are pleas'd to make <U+017F>port with me, 'tis you that appear more bright than a Star, and more charming than ever</hi> Adonis <hi>was.

Oh! no Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Lady, <hi>'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible you may frighten me, you had better cover it with <U+017F>omewhat or another. Medina</hi> who was unwilling to di<U+017F>turb the<U+017F>e two Lovers, retir'd out of re<U+017F>pect to her Kin<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman. The Mar<U+017F>hal being now left in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany only with his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, did <U+017F>o lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ent the vehemency of his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, in Terms <U+017F>o affectionate and obliging, confirm'd by a thou<U+017F>and Oaths and Imprecations, that he wou'd Love her as long as he liv'd; that at la<U+017F>t the fair <hi>Spaniard</hi> was vanqui<U+017F>h'd, and having ask'd him with a very tender and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Air; <hi>Will you never cea<U+017F>e to Love me? Will you never for<U+017F>ake me?</hi> She <U+017F>urren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Place which had held out <U+017F>o long again<U+017F>t the Mar<U+017F>hal's mo<U+017F>t vigourous Attacks. The Mar<U+017F>hal had no <U+017F>ooner taken po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of this <U+017F>trong Hold, but he repented of the Bargain; having found her nothing near <U+017F>o amiable as he had imagin'd before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Lady's are generally Subject to a great Infirmity; for as <U+017F>oon as they have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>s'd the Age of Eighteen or Twenty Years, they are <U+017F>eiz'd with a continual Flux, which is not fit to be touch'd nor <U+017F>o much as nam'd,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109100:30"/>
and the wor<U+017F>t is, that no Remedy can be found again<U+017F>t it: This was more than <U+017F>ufficient to put our General out of conceit with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; he being the Nice<U+017F>t Man in the World, as to Women. Indeed he was <U+017F>o di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd at this Bloody Encounter, that he cou'd <U+017F>carce conceal his di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure. The Lady was for having him renew the amourous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, but he excus'd him<U+017F>elf as well as he cou'd, telling her that on a <U+017F>udden he was <U+017F>eis'd with a mo<U+017F>t violent Head-Ach: The Lady was therefore oblig'd to expect the <U+017F>econd Rencounter the next time; which is as yet to come, for he never came near her <U+017F>ince that Day. He was neverthele<U+017F>s <U+017F>o generous, as to make her a Pre<U+017F>ent of <U+017F>ome Jewels, which he had brought along with him for that purpo<U+017F>e, as a reward of that Favour, which he had receiv'd from this fair <hi>Spaniard. Donna Olympia</hi> with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reverence Ki<U+017F>s'd her own Hands; which according to the Cu<U+017F>tom of that Country, is as much as to <U+017F>ay, I accept the Pre<U+017F>ent: Nay <U+017F>he appear'd extremely well <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd at fir<U+017F>t with it, looking upon it as a Pledge of her Lover's Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; but <U+017F>he was mo<U+017F>t gro<U+017F>ly mi<U+017F>taken in her aim, for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hal's Pas<U+017F><U+017F>ion was grown <U+017F>o cool by this time, that he wi<U+017F>h'd him<U+017F>elf at a great di<U+017F>tance from the Place where he was. <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> in the mean while began to be more and more

<U+017F>ome former Love-Intreagues in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Thus we are come to the conclu<U+017F>ion of the Hi<U+017F>tory of our two <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Lady's.</p>
            <p>'Tis now time to return to our Mar<U+017F>hal, who has not been Idle in <hi>Germany;</hi> having already found out a new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who<U+017F>e Charms have render'd him her Captive. Here you mu<U+017F>t not imagine that 'twas a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of that Country, who was <U+017F>o dexterous in engaging his Heart: no, they are very rarely <U+017F>o ingenious at Love-Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues in tho<U+017F>e Parts, being <U+017F>omewhat unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <U+017F>uch langui<U+017F>hing de<U+017F>ires, which are the con<U+017F>tant attendants of Lovers. The Beauty which Captivated him, was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Gentlewoman, whom chance had brought to the <U+017F>ame Inn where he Lodg'd. This Lady whom we will call my Lady <hi>Stone,</hi> was the Wife of a certain <hi>Iri<U+017F>h</hi> Gentleman, who being accus'd of High-Trea<U+017F>on, was forc'd to quit <hi>England,</hi> and finding no redre<U+017F>s in his Affairs, had <U+017F>ought for a Sanctuary in <hi>Germany,</hi> as his Wife was inform'd; who had undertaken this Journey, in hopes to find him out there; but not having got any farther Information concerning him, notwith<U+017F>tanding her utmo<U+017F>t endeavours, was extremely unea<U+017F>ie in the Inn where <U+017F>he Lodg'd, for fear that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd not be able to learn any news relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her ungrateful Husband, who had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109100:34"/>
left her without giving her the lea<U+017F>t notice, <U+017F>ince his departure, of the place of his Abode. The Mar<U+017F>hal, who was inform'd before hand of her Circum<U+017F>tances, <U+017F>hew'd her all the re<U+017F>pect due to a Lady of her Quality and Merits, who labour'd under great afflictions. It will not be a-mi<U+017F>s here to give you a Character of this <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Lady. She was mo<U+017F>t delicately <U+017F>hap'd, very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and affable in all her Behaviour. Her Hair was Black, her Complexion very fair, and her Skin very <U+017F>mooth; her Eyes very bright and <U+017F>parkling; <U+017F>he had the prettie<U+017F>t Mouth in the World, and <U+017F>he laugh'd mo<U+017F>t charmingly: As for her Teeth, they were none of the be<U+017F>t; this being a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect among the Lady's of this Country, who commonly <U+017F>poil 'em with eating Sweet-meats too plentifully. She had be<U+017F>ides thisa, certain Maje<U+017F>tick Air, which was <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight, tho' <U+017F>he was extremely Obliging and Courteous in Conver<U+017F>ation. Her Neck and Hands were very fair and plump, and to comprehend all in a few words, <U+017F>he appear'd <U+017F>o adoreable to our Mar<U+017F>hal, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <U+017F>trongly enamour'd with her Beauty. The fir<U+017F>t Proof he gave her of his Love, was one Morning, when he found her all in de<U+017F>pair in her Chamber; <U+017F>he had torn her Hair, and was ju<U+017F>t ready to make a way with her <U+017F>elf. If in any other Country
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109100:34"/>
but <hi>England</hi> a Woman <U+017F>hou'd commit the<U+017F>e extravagancies, <U+017F>he wou'd be thought only fit for a Mad-Hou<U+017F>e. But it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider'd that in no other place in the World the<U+017F>e violent attempts are <U+017F>o frequently put in Execution as there. I don't know what hard <U+017F>entiments they have concerning them<U+017F>elves, but this is certain, that for a <U+017F>mall di<U+017F>appointment, 'tis often known that they Hang, Poy<U+017F>on, or Pi<U+017F>tol them<U+017F>elves without any <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of thir crime. Our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral being touch'd as much with compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion as with Love, threw him<U+017F>elf ather Feet, entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to tell him the truecau<U+017F>eof that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which had in<U+017F>pir'd her with <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perate a Re<U+017F>olution, the mark's of which plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in her Countenance. The <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Lady being <U+017F>omewhat of a haughty temper, cou'd at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>carce re<U+017F>olve to di<U+017F>cover the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances of her Affairs to Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fflers,</hi> looking upon it as a thing very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming her<U+017F>elf, and as <U+017F>omewhat which cou'd not but mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly affect her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Neverthele<U+017F>s, con<U+017F>idering with her <U+017F>elf in what a generous and obliging manner <U+017F>he was treated by the Mar<U+017F>hal, <U+017F>he at la<U+017F>t determin'd to make an ingenuous Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion in the<U+017F>e Words: <hi>Is it po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,</hi> Sir, <hi>that my ill Fortune <U+017F>hou'd drive me to this point of Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in which you <U+017F>ee me at pre<U+017F>ent: My Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who <U+017F>carce de<U+017F>erves that name, having

left me without Mony, and without any pro<U+017F>pect of receiving a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from any Per<U+017F>on? I have been for <U+017F>ome time in this Inn, with my</hi> Valet du Chambre, <hi>and my waiting Woman; and be<U+017F>ides other Nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries requi<U+017F>ite for a Per<U+017F>on of my Quality; I have not wherewithal to <U+017F>atisfy my Ho<U+017F>t, whom I cannot expect to entertain me</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, <hi>I am quite beyond all Patience, to <U+017F>ee my <U+017F>elf reduc'd to this extremity, by the neglect of an ill Husband, who</hi>‚ÄîShe cou'd not proceed, the Tears which trickl'd down her Beautiful Cheeks, having quite <U+017F>topt her Speech. The Mar<U+017F>hal was <U+017F>o touch'd with compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, that immediately he offer'd her his Pur<U+017F>e, de<U+017F>iring her to make u<U+017F>e of it, as if it were her own; and to <U+017F>hew her that his Words were not bare Compliments, as 'tis the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cu<U+017F>tom of a great many, but that his Offers were real, he went immediately down to the Ho<U+017F>t, whom he ask'd how much that <hi>Engli<U+017F>h Lady</hi> who with her Servants Lodg'd in his Hou<U+017F>e, was indebted to him. The Inn-holder having brought him her Bill, he immediately pay'd him what he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; telling him, that he had receiv'd Orders from her Husband Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> to pay him his Mony, and to engage his Word for what ever <U+017F>he <U+017F>hou'd have occa<U+017F>ion for in his Hou<U+017F>e, for the future. In a few Moments after, Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Boufflers</hi> <U+017F>ent to his new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s a Pur<U+017F>e full of <hi>Lovis's d'or,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd

The Mar<U+017F>hal di<U+017F>covering in this fair Lady every day new charms, was extremely glad of this Opportunity, hoping that his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality wou'd be repaid him in another Coin, that is to <U+017F>ay, by his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es Favours. <hi>Is it po<U+017F>sible,</hi> <U+017F>aid he to him<U+017F>elf, <hi>that any Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band can be <U+017F>o unworthy, thus to abandon a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of her merit, and who is <U+017F>o Charming and Amiable in outward appearance?

Her Mouth was <U+017F>o big that it reach'd from one Ear to the other; her No<U+017F>e was very <U+017F>mall; her Fore-head very low and flat; her Eyes va<U+017F>tly large; her Hair and the grain of her Skin very cour<U+017F>e, if you touch'd her <U+017F>he felt like a Nutmeg grater; be<U+017F>ides that <U+017F>he was as Black as a Tawny-moor, and her <U+017F>hape was all awry: But notwith<U+017F>tanding all this, <U+017F>he had a mo<U+017F>t admirable Head-piece, having a ready and well refin'd Wit, and was mo<U+017F>t excellent at Repartees.

The Mar<U+017F>hal return'd as fa<U+017F>t as he was able to his Lodgings, where he did not <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o much as one Word of his Adventure, but he was forc'd to keep his Bed for <U+017F>everal Days, and <hi>Champonniere</hi> his <hi>Valet du Chambre</hi> was fain to bath his Limbs, (which were extremely batter'd) with Spirit of Wine, and <hi>Spani<U+017F>h</hi> Soap.

Indeed, reply'd <U+017F>he, <q>I might ea<U+017F>ily Conjecture this to be the true cau<U+017F>e of your indifferency; but can you imagine Sir, that without a great deal of trouble we can re<U+017F>olve to grant your Sex tho<U+017F>e Favours, which you aim at. I am apt to believe you <U+017F>ay right, Madam,</q> an<U+017F>wer'd the Mar<U+017F>hal, <q>but if a Woman meets with one whom <U+017F>he knows to be a Per<U+017F>on of Honour and Di<U+017F>cretion, what has <U+017F>he to fear?

He mu<U+017F>t needs be de<U+017F>titute both of Honour and Integrity that does it. If this be the only Scruple remaining, which troubles you, I can quickly free you from it, by a<U+017F><U+017F>uring you that as to this particular I am invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Love me therefore my Deare<U+017F>t, and

While the<U+017F>e two Lovers were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting that cruel <U+017F>eparation which was <U+017F>o near at Hand; the Husband of this fair <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Lady, having receiv'd her Letter, and fearing not without Rea<U+017F>on, that a Coronet was preparing for his Head, had made all the <U+017F>peed he cou'd to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany.</hi> The Mar<U+017F>hal was over-joy'd at the News, finding his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s to grow <U+017F>omewhat burden<U+017F>ome to his Pur<U+017F>e, be.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> was extremely well <U+017F>atisfy'd to meet his Wife, whom he believ'd to have been very faithful to him; but poor Man, he was very much mi<U+017F>taken, he mu<U+017F>t have come a little <U+017F>ooner, if he wou'd have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her from entring him in the Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old's Order. However, matters pa<U+017F>s'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em with a great deal of Love and Amity. The Mar<U+017F>hal treated the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Gentleman no otherwi<U+017F>e than his Friend, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him by <U+017F>everal Oaths that he wou'd be ready to <U+017F>erve him, whenever any Occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>hou'd pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elf. But the Lady was greatly afflicted at the Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing departure of her Lover, who was <U+017F>o complai<U+017F>ant to <U+017F>tay with her as long as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he cou'd, even <U+017F>ome time beyond his Orders, during which, they let <U+017F>lip no opportunity to <U+017F>trengthen the good Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Horns, who was not <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of what pains they took for him, or if he was, did conceal his Re<U+017F>entment. However, one Evening, after the Mar<U+017F>hal was ju<U+017F>t gone out of her Appartment, he cou'd not forbear telling her, that he thought <U+017F>he had a little too much kindne<U+017F>s for the Mar<U+017F>hal. <hi>What wou'd'<U+017F>t thou have me do my Dear,</hi> reply'd <U+017F>he, <hi>you know what va<U+017F>t

Obligations I have receiv'd from him; he has dealt <U+017F>o generou<U+017F>ly with me, that 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for me to forget it as long as I live.

At la<U+017F>t <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur Boufflers</hi> was forc'd to leave his Po<U+017F>t, and to depart conformably to the po<U+017F>itive Orders of the Count <hi>de Montal.</hi> I will not undertake here to give you a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of what pa<U+017F>s'd in the Field during the re<U+017F>t of the Campaign, this not being my pre<U+017F>ent de<U+017F>ign, but I <U+017F>hall rather follow the natural cour<U+017F>e of our Hi<U+017F>tory, which will lead us to <U+017F>ome new Love-Intreagues of our General; who being return'd after the Campaign was fini<U+017F>h'd, to <hi>Paris,</hi> <U+017F>oon provided for him<U+017F>elf a new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: This was a young Dam<U+017F>el, the Daughter of a certain rich Merchant, whom he <U+017F>aw one Morning going to Ma<U+017F>s at <hi>Clermont,</hi> where he went to hear a Sermon preach'd by a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uit, who contrary to the Cu<U+017F>tom of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, was at that time to treat of pure Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. Tho' the Mar<U+017F>hal <U+017F>eem'd to be very attentive to the Doctrine preach'd by this Je<U+017F>uit, who di<U+017F>cours'd like a very good Chri<U+017F>tian, yet Love did not cea<U+017F>e to in<U+017F>inuate it <U+017F>elf into his Heart, and to make
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109100:48"/>
him <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of its Force. <hi>Mademoi<U+017F>elle Landy</hi> was the name of this Beauty, that had charm'd him at Church: She wore that day upon her Head one of your little black Feather-Caps, that were then in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hion, which was <U+017F>o becoming to her, that tho' <U+017F>he was otherwi<U+017F>e but an indifferent Beauty, yet the Mar<U+017F>hal cou'd <U+017F>carce keep his Eyes from her. She <U+017F>oon perceiv'd it, and knowing her <U+017F>elf to be in a Place, where every thing ought to be done with a great deal of Mode<U+017F>ty, <U+017F>he pull'd her Hood <U+017F>omewhat lower over her Face. Sermon being ended, the Mar<U+017F>hal took care to go out with her, and with a very gallant Air to ask her, if <U+017F>he wou'd not allow him the Honour to wait upon her to her Hou<U+017F>e. This young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman who was very well bred, and did not want Wit, quickly perceiving by his Behaviour that he was not a Man to be de<U+017F>pis'd, accepted of his Civility; nay, <U+017F>eem'd well pleas'd to be Conducted home by <U+017F>o gallant a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>The next day, the Mar<U+017F>hal made her a Vi<U+017F>it; he found her in her Chamber, where <U+017F>he was playing very Sweetly and Charmingly upon the Lute. The <U+017F>weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of her Voice and the skill with which <U+017F>he expre<U+017F>s'd her Words to Admiration, were <U+017F>uch Powerful Charms to him, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109100:49"/>
he <U+017F>eem'd to be quite Enchanted. But he was forc'd to carry on this Love-intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with a great deal of Precaution; for her Father and Mother were Per<U+017F>ons of good Repute, who<U+017F>e chief aim was to preferr their only Daughter to <U+017F>ome good Match or another. They flatter'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves for <U+017F>ome time with the hopes that <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur de Boufflers</hi> vi<U+017F>ited their Daughter upon this account, but they were much mi<U+017F>taken, for his only bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him<U+017F>elf, and to <U+017F>pend his lei<U+017F>ure-time in amourous Adventures. <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur Landy</hi> began at la<U+017F>t to di<U+017F>cover his De<U+017F>ign, and coming one day from the Exchange, met with the Mar<U+017F>hal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> upon his Knees before his Daughter, Ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing her Hands: Upon his departure, he check'd her very <U+017F>everely, and in a Week after <U+017F>ent her to a <hi>Nunnery.</hi> The Mar<U+017F>hal having perceiv'd that he was the cau<U+017F>e that the Father had <U+017F>o unkindly treated his Daughter, gave him a Vi<U+017F>it on purpo<U+017F>e to upbraid him with his <U+017F>everity. <hi>Will you marry her Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid the Merchant briskly to <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur Boufflers, if you will, I'll give her Thirty or Forty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and Crowns, ready Mony for her Portion. No Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur Boufflers, my intent is not as yet to entangle my <U+017F>elf in Wedlock; all that I did, was only to pa<U+017F>s away <U+017F>ome Melancholy hours in admiring tho<U+017F>e perfections, which I found in

O brave Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi> reply'd Mon<U+017F>ieur <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> taking him by the Hand; <hi>I find now that you are a Man of Courage, if our Enemies <U+017F>hou'd ever come to enter</hi> France, <hi>we <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>ure not to want brave Soldiers to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t us upon all Occa<U+017F>ions.

               <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur de Boufflers,</hi> after having left the Merchant, return'd to his own Hou<U+017F>e, to reflect upon his amourous Widdow hood which indeed was <U+017F>o burden<U+017F>ome to him, that he was not able to endure it long: He wanted <U+017F>ome new Love-engagement, let it co<U+017F>t what it wou'd. Opportunity, which always was favourable to him, <U+017F>oon pre<U+017F>ented a Paramour to his view.

            <p>But let us leave the<U+017F>e two Lady's for a little while, and <U+017F>ee what is become of our Mar<U+017F>hal, who went to his Lodgings as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour'd as ever he was in Life-time: He repre<U+017F>ented to his Imagination the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Mademoi<U+017F>elle de la Fleur,</hi> which had <U+017F>uch an influence over his Spirits, that he did neither Sleep nor Eat, as he us'd to do, becau<U+017F>e he never went either to Bed or Table, without being di<U+017F>turb'd by his amourous Di<U+017F>orders: He appear'd always pen<U+017F>ive, being overwhelm'd with a thou<U+017F>and di<U+017F>tracting Cares, which almo<U+017F>t reduc'd him to the extremity of De<U+017F>pair, when he con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with him<U+017F>elf all the ob<U+017F>tacles which he was to <U+017F>urmount before he cou'd have the lea<U+017F>t hopes of obtaining his aim; for Madam <hi>Garenne</hi> his Cou<U+017F>in had peremto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily declar'd that <U+017F>he wou'd not allow of the lea<U+017F>t Intercour<U+017F>e between him and his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, from whom he as yet had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd but very <U+017F>mall encouragement;‚Äîbut that which afforded him mo<U+017F>t Con<U+017F>olation was, that he had ob<U+017F>erv'd in her whole deportment a natural inclination to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne<U+017F>s, tho' <U+017F>he feign'd in <U+017F>ome of her Actions a great deal of haughtine<U+017F>s and cruelty. This hope (the common atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

only Son to the Mar<U+017F>hal <hi>de Humieres,</hi> who was kill'd at the very beginning, in a Sally made by the Be<U+017F>ieged.

He wou'd needs put him<U+017F>elf in Mourning Apparel, which prov'd a means to in<U+017F>inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate him<U+017F>elf into the Favour of his decea<U+017F>ed Friend's Father, who was in great e<U+017F>teem at Court.</p>
            <p>Winter drawing near, <U+017F>ome of the Officers repair'd to their re<U+017F>pective Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons, the re<U+017F>t to <hi>Paris</hi> or <U+017F>ome other Prices. I cannot <U+017F>ay any thing here to our Mar<U+017F>hal's amourous Adventures, for <U+017F>ome time after, becau<U+017F>e I know that he then made a re<U+017F>olution to take <U+017F>ome re<U+017F>t, and in<U+017F>tead of pur<U+017F>uing the <U+017F>ports of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> to apply him<U+017F>elf entirely to the Art of War, and the <U+017F>tudy of <U+017F>ome other Sciences, for two or three Years; during which time, he became <U+017F>uch a Proficient in every one of 'em, that he attain'd to the highe<U+017F>t perfections, <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ing even his Ma<U+017F>ters, e<U+017F>pecially in the Mathematicks, to which his <hi>Genius</hi> was naturally inclin'd. The King having made him <U+017F>oon after, a Knight of the Order of the Holy-Gho<U+017F>t, he was all of a <U+017F>udden in<U+017F>pir'd with <U+017F>o much Devotion, that he went every day
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:109100:74"/>
to Ma<U+017F>s, and to hear Sermons, of which he never mi<U+017F>s'd one. He was wont al<U+017F>o frequently at that time, to pay his vi<U+017F>its to the Je<U+017F>uits in the Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ed Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Paris,</hi> who by that means became his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends, and they prevail'd with him to make a Vow to St. <hi>Amable,</hi> who is in great e<U+017F>teem in the City of <hi>Rion</hi> in <hi>Auvergne,</hi> both for his antiquity, and the great number of miracles which he is <U+017F>aid to have wrought. This Saint is to be <U+017F>een in the great Church of that City, and it is reported of him, that if any one does but touch, (with a true faith) a certain great Tooth which he has, it <U+017F>ecures him from ever dying of his Wounds receiv'd in the Wars, or otherwi<U+017F>e, as well as from any others, got by the biting of mad Dogs or Venomous Bea<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>The Reader may ea<U+017F>ily judge from thence, that the Mar<U+017F>hal had rais'd his mind to the highe<U+017F>t pitch of Devotion, and <U+017F>ome began to be of Opinion, that he was in a fair way of turning an ab<U+017F>olute Bigot, if Love, which is not a fit Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ort of People, and which had always the chief A<U+017F>cendant over his Heart, had not quickly made him change his Inclination, and oblig'd him to re-a<U+017F><U+017F>ume his former Liberty. Let us now <U+017F>ee him go to the Battel of <hi>Fleurus,</hi> which happen'd in the Year 1690 in the Month of <hi>June,</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:109100:74"/>
under the Command of the Duke <hi>of Luxemburg,</hi> who. was then General over the King's Forces in <hi>Flanders.</hi> No <U+017F>ooner were the Enemies beaten out of the Field, but <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur Boufflers,</hi> who had had an ample <U+017F>hare in the Victory, took his re<U+017F>t in the Arms of a new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, who po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd all his thoughts for <U+017F>ome time. This was one Mrs. <hi>Montberg</hi> the Daughter of a certain <hi>Flemmi<U+017F>h</hi> Officer, who had been kill'd in the <U+017F>ame Battel. It mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>aid to her advantage, that never was <U+017F>een a more beautiful Woman of a brown Complexion in the World, and who had a more grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full haughtine<U+017F>s in her whole Behaviour than <U+017F>he; and it was not without a great deal of trouble that the Mar<U+017F>hal cou'd find an opportunity to addre<U+017F>s his Court<U+017F>hip to her. The lo<U+017F>s of her Father, who was one of the be<U+017F>t Officers the Allies had in the whole Army, had afflicted her to that degree that <U+017F>he refus'd to admit of any Con<U+017F>olation, having by his Death been bereav'd of all, what <U+017F>he cou'd call her own, as having no other Sub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance but what depended ab<U+017F>olutely upon her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Fortune.</p>

            <p>Our fair Lady, who did not know which way to turn her <U+017F>elf, having no body to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t her, at la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olv'd to unbutton his Coat and Wa<U+017F>te-coat, and to lay her Hand upon his Stomach, which felt <U+017F>omewhat cold; and having back'd her tender Care<U+017F><U+017F>es with a douzen or more hearty and <U+017F>weet Ki<U+017F><U+017F>es, the<U+017F>e had the wi<U+017F>h'd for effect, having <U+017F>oon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd our General out of his Love-trance, <U+017F>o that now he began to open his Eyes, which were half <U+017F>hut before. <hi>Then you are return'd from the other World,</hi> cry'd his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, looking in his Face, <hi>if you were <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible how you have frighted me, you wou'd have prevented your Swooning thus: I did verily believe that you were gone to the</hi> Ely<U+017F>ian <hi>Fields, but I now perceive your Hour was not yet come.

was about to thru<U+017F>t it into his Heart. The Lady having <U+017F>natch'd the Knife out of his Hands, and perceiving it all Bloody, was <U+017F>o extremely terrify'd at the <U+017F>ight of it, that <U+017F>he actually fell into a Swoon, out of which <U+017F>he did not recover till <U+017F>ome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable time after; <U+017F>he turn'd as pale as Death, not having the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>e left her, <U+017F>o that the Mar<U+017F>hal, who was only in je<U+017F>t, had now made work enough for him<U+017F>elf in good earne<U+017F>t.

            <p>The Lady having been oblig'd to keep her Bed for <U+017F>ome time, by rea<U+017F>on of the weakne<U+017F>s it caus'd in her, enquir'd after her Gallant, who being come, <U+017F>he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him with the mo<U+017F>t tender Expre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions in the World: He who had now the Opportunity to rove about his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es Bo<U+017F>om, to play with her two lovely plump Bubbies, and whiter than the very Snow, and to advance even as far as to the little Mount of <hi>Venus,</hi> where Love keeps its Throne, did an<U+017F>wer to her obliging Expre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions in <U+017F>o Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate a manner; that <U+017F>hou'd any one have been an Eye-witne<U+017F>s to 'em,

they wou'd have believ'd him bewitch'd or turn'd Fool; and this was as I take it, the occa<U+017F>ion of a rumour then <U+017F>pread all about <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Mar<U+017F>hal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> after the Battel of <hi>Fleurus,</hi> was <U+017F>o de<U+017F>perately fall'n in Love with a certain young Lady in <hi>Brabant,</hi> that he was quite Di<U+017F>tracted; 'Tis probable that the General in one of his amourous Tran<U+017F>ports, had been the Occa<U+017F>ion of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this je<U+017F>t put upon him, it being then the common di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the Town.</p>

Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known evil Spirit did hurrye me on; I fan<U+017F>y'd that <U+017F>ome Gho<U+017F>t or another did drive me to the place where you were, and I cannot devi<U+017F>e what <U+017F>hou'd be the Original cau<U+017F>e of this Inchantment; I may very well call it <U+017F>o, for I am <U+017F>ure I was forc'd to act contrary to my own Inclination.

When this Lady went fir<U+017F>t from her Lodgings, <U+017F>he told her Gentlewomen and the re<U+017F>t of her Dome<U+017F>tick Servants, That <U+017F>he was going to <U+017F>ee one of her Acquaintance, who was in a Mona<U+017F>tery near <hi>Mons;</hi> which was the Rea<U+017F>on, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Stay with our General, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Five or <U+017F>ix Days, they were not di<U+017F>turb'd at her Ab<U+017F>ence. She had made one of her Waiting Gentlewomen, who<U+017F>e Name was <hi>Gvi<U+017F><U+017F>on,</hi> and one whom <U+017F>he had a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Re<U+017F>pect for than all the re<U+017F>t, her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; <U+017F>he waited upon her in one Corner of the Wood, with her Woman's Apparel, which <U+017F>he had there chang'd for the Man's Cloaths he had worn before. Thus our Heroine Lady return'd Home to her Lodgings, accompany'd only by this Dam<U+017F>el, leaning upon her Arm as if <U+017F>he had been the mo<U+017F>t harmle<U+017F>s Creature in the World, and as if, during her Stay, <U+017F>he had employ'd her Time in nothing el<U+017F>e but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>The <hi>Mar<U+017F>hal de Boufflers,</hi> after he had got clear from the other Officers that met him in the Wood, <U+017F>pent all that Night under mo<U+017F>t terrible Agonies, not knowing what was become of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, whom he had <U+017F>earch'd for all over the Fore<U+017F>t; but no <U+017F>ooner did the next Morning appear, but to ea<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf of the Trouble which di<U+017F>tracted his Mind, he mounted on Hor<U+017F>e-back, <U+017F>teer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cour<U+017F>e directly to the Place where he knew his <hi>Beloved</hi> lodg'd all that Time.

            <p>The<U+017F>e A<U+017F><U+017F>urances were <U+017F>ign'd by both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <U+017F>everal times over, and the poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>s, who was of a very tender Con<U+017F>titution, <U+017F>eal'd 'em with <U+017F>ome Drops of her Blood, in hopes that their mutual Promi<U+017F>es <U+017F>hou'd outla<U+017F>t their Lives.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mar<U+017F>hal,</hi> now more contented than a Prince, left his <hi>Beloved</hi> in Bed, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated his Promi<U+017F>e, to come and <U+017F>ee her often.

The Count, who was not in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, and lov'd her extremely, was ready to dye with Vexation, not imagining that <U+017F>he cou'd love any one but him<U+017F>elf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had <U+017F>o much advanc'd her Fortune; he having marry'd her not for her Portion or extraordinary Quality, but merely for her Beauty; <U+017F>he being, by Birth, the Daughter only of a Private Gentleman in <hi>Poictou.</hi>

<U+017F>ufficiently to inve<U+017F>t him with the <U+017F>ame Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; he turn'd the whole into Raillery, and an<U+017F>wer'd her in Terms full of Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; which mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly afflicted her: And the <hi>Mar<U+017F>hal,</hi> who after the Campaign was ended, return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> told her with his own Mouth, <hi>That he cou'd not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve to Marry; but that this <U+017F>hou'd not hinder him from loving her as well as if <U+017F>he were his Wife, and more; for,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>Marriage often <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>es the vehemency of Love, and <U+017F>ometimes quite extingui<U+017F>hes its Flame.</hi> But the<U+017F>e Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons were not cogent enough to make her lay a<U+017F>ide the Thoughts <U+017F>he had of Marrying him.

At la<U+017F>t, being grown impatient, at the Ab<U+017F>ence of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and con<U+017F>ulting more his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion than his Rea<U+017F>on, he re<U+017F>olv'd to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf in Woman's Apparel, on purpo<U+017F>e to give her a vi<U+017F>it.</p>

Having in this Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e met her in the Parlour of the Nunnery, he did not delay to declare his Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion to her; unto which <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wer'd with <U+017F>o much Mode<U+017F>ty, that he was extremely charm'd with it. After his Departure, his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s thought it mo<U+017F>t advi<U+017F>able not to <U+017F>peak any thing of her di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd Lover, either to her Mother, or the re<U+017F>t of the Religious Si<U+017F>ters, for fear of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <U+017F>ome Jealou<U+017F>ie into their Brains, by which means <U+017F>he might lo<U+017F>e the Advantage of entertaining him another Time. The next Day our General, being advertis'd that her Mother wou'd be abroad, had the Sati<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to vi<U+017F>it his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s in her Chamber, which was ju<U+017F>t at the Entrance of the Abby; and the re<U+017F>t of the Nuns believing it to be <U+017F>ome particular Acquaintance of her's, did not concern them<U+017F>elves any farther, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the Freedom of enjoying the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of his <hi>Beloved</hi> for the <U+017F>pace of Two Hours.

            <p>No <U+017F>ooner was he gone, but Madam <hi>Orton</hi> ask'd her Daughter, How <U+017F>he came acquainted with this Gentlewoman? <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> reply'd <U+017F>he, <hi><U+017F>he is a certain young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a very good Family of</hi> Namur, <hi>who has a great Affection for me.</hi> Si<U+017F>ter <hi>Coline</hi> <U+017F>tanding by, began to <U+017F>mile at her An<U+017F>wer, which made her Mother ask the Name of this Lady.

            <p>Our General, finding him<U+017F>elf now di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engag'd from all his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, began to lead a very regular and <U+017F>olitary cour<U+017F>e of Life, <U+017F>o that Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> having ob<U+017F>erv'd him <U+017F>o much alter'd from what he had been before, made no difficulty to <U+017F>peak in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half to <hi>Mademoi<U+017F>elle de Grammont,</hi> Daughter of the Mar<U+017F>hal of the <U+017F>ame Name, who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly commanded the King's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, had <U+017F>ignaliz'd him<U+017F>elf on <U+017F>everal Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ions. The Abbe<U+017F>s of St. <hi>Cyr</hi> did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to give her an Account of all his rare Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli<U+017F>hments, unto which the young Lady reply'd but very little, being not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <U+017F>ome of his amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigues, and believing him only to act the Hypocrite like a Je<U+017F>uit. But our General, being a great Favourite of Madam <hi>Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s, had often an opportunity to <U+017F>ee her there; and having always <U+017F>hew'd her a more than ordinary deference and re<U+017F>pect, <U+017F>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by degrees to have a better Opinion of him and his Actions. One Day being left
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:109100:106"/>
alone with her, he began to declare his Pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion to her by halves, but was <U+017F>o extremely over-aw'd by her Pre<U+017F>ence, that he was not able to proceed in his Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e; the exce<U+017F>s of his Love made him <U+017F>tammer almo<U+017F>t at every Word; which caus'd <hi>Mademoi<U+017F>elle</hi> to laugh at his Tran<U+017F>ports. He <U+017F>oon after, had a Quartan Ague for three Months, which was commonly call'd the Intervals of his Love; in<U+017F>omuch that he was oblig'd to take a good Quantity of <hi>Quinquina,</hi> or <hi>Je<U+017F>uit's Powder,</hi> which cur'd him of his Ague, but occa<U+017F>ion'd a mo<U+017F>t violent Head-ach, for which he was advis'd to have recour<U+017F>e to the Waters of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> as he did. He was ju<U+017F>t upon the point of getting a new Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s upon the Road, but having recollected him<U+017F>elf, how prejudicial <U+017F>uch an Intrigue might prove to his pre<U+017F>ent De<U+017F>ign, he thought it more advi<U+017F>eable in this juncture, to keep a <U+017F>trong guard over his Heart, which wou'd willingly have made an Elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to fortifie it <U+017F>o well, as not to fear any Attack, except from <hi>Mademoi<U+017F>elle de Grammont,</hi> unto whom all its Avenues and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>es were to be open'd.</p>
            <p>Thus he <U+017F>pent <U+017F>ome time in this Solitude, but he cou'd not hold out long, for he <U+017F>oon after, began to fix his Eyes on a young Laundre<U+017F>s, who was wont to bring his Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen

There is a va<U+017F>t difference between that <U+017F>ort of Love which is be<U+017F>tow'd upon a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and that which belongs to a Wife. An unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd Per<U+017F>on, without <U+017F>ome little Love-Exerci<U+017F>e, grows dull and good for nothing.

            <p>At the<U+017F>e words all the Ladies that were pre<U+017F>ent, bur<U+017F>t out aloud into a'laughter.

If this be true, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s it is one of the mo<U+017F>t famous Sieges that we have known of; and if you had not received Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors from the Relations of the Counte<U+017F>s your Lady, it is a great que<U+017F>tion to me, whether you would not have been oblig'd to rai<U+017F>e the Siege.</hi> The Counte<U+017F>s, who was pre<U+017F>ent during the Conte<U+017F>t, blu<U+017F>ht at this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, but this Colour (which is <U+017F>o natural to all civil Women) being a little gone, <U+017F>he did like the re<U+017F>t, who laugh'd all as heartily as they could.</p>
            <p>The Count then re<U+017F>uming the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e: <hi>To compleat your Diver<U+017F>ion, Ladies,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>I will give you an exact Hi<U+017F>tory of what pa<U+017F>t between my Spou<U+017F>e and me the fir<U+017F>t night after our Wedding.</hi> The Marchione<U+017F>s <hi>de Choi<U+017F>i</hi> a very grave Matron, told him, <hi>That the Ladies would not be again<U+017F>t it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he would be cautious in offering any thing

               <q>The Counte<U+017F>s, my Wife, was but twelve years of Age, <U+017F>aid the Count, when I marry'd her.

Our Nuptial Fea<U+017F>t was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at the Marchione<U+017F>s <hi>de Bre<U+017F>e</hi>'s, my Wife's Mother. About an hour before we were to go to Bed, I went up into the Chamber where we were to lie that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:109100:130"/>
night, to in<U+017F>pect the Nuptial Bed which was prepared for us, and after I had carefully examined every thing, with all the Circum<U+017F>pection imaginable, I returned to my Spou<U+017F>e, whom I had left in the Hall among our Gue<U+017F>ts. The hour being come, when we were to go to bed, Wax-tapers were lighted, and the Gentlemen and Ladies having taken their leave, went every one to their re<U+017F>pective Lodgings. Some of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at their departure, whi<U+017F>per'd <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I know not what, in my Spou<U+017F>es Ear, which I never have been able to learn <U+017F>ince, neither from them, nor her own Mouth. I confe<U+017F>s that this put me into <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tudy for a few moments, con<U+017F>idering with my <U+017F>elf what <U+017F>mall progre<U+017F>s I had made over the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this young Beauty, which <U+017F>eem'd to be born with a general aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion to all Men. Her early years never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele<U+017F>s gave me <U+017F>ome hopes to believe, that time, which ripens every thing, would overcome her <U+017F>tubborn Heart, and render it more flexible towards me, who omitted nothing to in<U+017F>inuate my <U+017F>elf into her good Will, but all in vain. At la<U+017F>t, my Spou<U+017F>e being undre<U+017F>t, and laid in Bed fir<U+017F>t, according to the u<U+017F>ual Cu<U+017F>tom, and I having put on my

Night-cap and Wedding Shirt, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my <hi>Valet du Chambre</hi> to withdraw, and to <U+017F>hut the door after him, which he did. When I came nearer to the Bed, I heard <U+017F>omething <U+017F>tir underneath it, which made me <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, that <U+017F>ome body was not far off ready to play me a <U+017F>curvy trick; my Wife being as much <U+017F>urprized at it, as my <U+017F>elf, I run all in a fury towards the Table where my Sword lay, which having drawn out of the Scabbard, I pu<U+017F>h d with it under the Bed, with a de<U+017F>ign to kill any one that <U+017F>hould have hid him<U+017F>elf there. I was much <U+017F>tartled to <U+017F>ee the Cavalier <hi>du Ble<U+017F>e</hi> come out from under the Bed, begging my pardon a thou<U+017F>and times for his un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable curio<U+017F>ity, and tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, <hi>That he would willingly have given</hi>

               <q>Ladies, continued the Count, I leave it to your own con<U+017F>ideration, to judge in what a condition I found my <U+017F>elf at that time.

               <q>I cry'd out, and made a hideous noi<U+017F>e like one in <hi>Bedlam.</hi> I call'd her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and times by her Name, but I might call long enough there was no body that an<U+017F>wer'd me. After I had made a <U+017F>ufficient Outcry, I ro<U+017F>e at la<U+017F>t out of my Bed, imagining that <U+017F>he might perhaps have hid her <U+017F>elf underneath it, as the Cavalier had done before, whom I had hunted from thence. The Love and tender Affection which I had for her, were motives <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>trong to hinder me from taking up my Sword to fetch her out from thence,

as I had done before to the Cavalier; be<U+017F>ides, I was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, that I ought to make u<U+017F>e of more gentle Arms again<U+017F>t a young Virgin. Wherefore, after a great many vain Reflections, which almo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tracted my Brains, I got under the Bed my <U+017F>elf, where I crawl'd up and down for a con<U+017F>iderable time, without being able to find any thing, <U+017F>o that now I began tobelieve in good earne<U+017F>t, that there mu<U+017F>t needs be Witchcraft in the ca<U+017F>e.</q> No <U+017F>ooner had the Count <U+017F>poke the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t words, but his Spou<U+017F>e, and all the re<U+017F>t of the Ladies laugh'd very heartily. The Count perceiving how overjoyed they were at the recital of this Adventure, which had co<U+017F>t him <U+017F>o much vexation, and had almo<U+017F>t put him quite be<U+017F>ides him<U+017F>elf, if he had not had courage enough to bear up again<U+017F>t that Daemon, the Enemy of his Repo<U+017F>e, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to give 'em this Le<U+017F><U+017F>on: <hi>Ladies,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>you are tho<U+017F>e familiar Spirits, which are <U+017F>ent from the other world on purpo<U+017F>e to damn and torment Mankind, and to make them dye a lingering Death.</hi> Whereupon the Ladies laugh'd as if they had been out of their Wits, and de<U+017F>ired him to proceed in his Story.

I leave it to your <U+017F>elves, Ladies, <U+017F>aid the Count, to gue<U+017F>s, how much <U+017F>urpriz'd I was to <U+017F>ee her peepout of the Hay, like a Mou<U+017F>e out of a Ne<U+017F>t of her own making, where <U+017F>he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have <U+017F>pent that whole night.

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Being once more gone to bed, I <U+017F>pent great part of the night in endeavouring to per<U+017F>wade her out of this <U+017F>avage and barbarous Humour; but after I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd the utmo<U+017F>t fatigues, I found my <U+017F>elf where I was before. Her Innocence and Youth, which were the cau<U+017F>e of her crime, were all my Comfort, in hopes that time would work out that, which was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for my Love and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion to effect. I might repre<U+017F>ent to her what I thought fit concerning the <U+017F>acred Tye of Matrimony, which had join'd us

together, and that, for the future, we were to be but one Fle<U+017F>h, according to the true Principles of Chri<U+017F>tianity: That this was the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>acred and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Knot of matrimonial and civil Society, and the only one in which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted all the Plea<U+017F>ure and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that we Mortals are capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying upon Earth.

All the<U+017F>e Reflections were in vain, and made no more impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon her Mind, than if <U+017F>he had heard a Fanatick, or Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, making an Harangue.</q> 
               <hi>Come, come, Count,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur de Boufflers, let us leave the<U+017F>e moral Reflections to the Prie<U+017F>ts: Father</hi> Bourdalou <hi>takes care to furni<U+017F>h the Ladies with 'em in his Sermons: Let us hear the end of your Story.</hi>

When you have heard all the circum<U+017F>tances of the whole matter you'll be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that <U+017F>ome things are tran<U+017F>acted in</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, <hi>which are bury'd in eternal oblivion. And if it <U+017F>o fall out <U+017F>ometimes that <U+017F>uch like things are di<U+017F>cover'd, tis owing to Providence which brings them to light to convince us of the Vanity of this World, and to make us <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of what abu<U+017F>es are daily committed among Men. At the <U+017F>ame time it mu<U+017F>t be acknowledg'd, that Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanary is the famous Theatre, where, the<U+017F>e Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Parts are di<U+017F>plaid; this occa<U+017F>ions more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

               <q>Father <hi>La Chai<U+017F>e</hi> told me, that on the 24th of <hi>April</hi> la<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>t, about a quarter of an hour after twelve a clock at night, when the whole College of Je<U+017F>uits were in Bed, there came to the Door of the Mona<U+017F>tery a Coach with <U+017F>ix Hor<U+017F>es; and a Footman coming from behind the Coach, rung the Bell at the Gate. The Porter, being in his fir<U+017F>t Sleep, did not hear him immediately, which made the Footman ring again <U+017F>o loudly, that the Porter was awaken'd at the noi<U+017F>e he made.

               <q>The Foot-man pray'd him to make all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible ha<U+017F>te he could, by rea<U+017F>on that no time was to be lo<U+017F>t.

            <p>Father <hi>La Chai<U+017F>e</hi> being by this time got out of Bed, went down to the Gate him<U+017F>elf, where the <U+017F>ame Foot-man, who had <U+017F>poke before to the Porter,

               <q>Father <hi>La Chai<U+017F>e,</hi> who could not di<U+017F>cover who<U+017F>e Equipage this was, the Foot-men being all di<U+017F>guis'd by their black Faces, like your very Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, thought it mo<U+017F>t convenient to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>e with the Rector, Praefect, and other Superiors of the Order, whether they would approve of his going along with tho<U+017F>e unknown Per<U+017F>ons.</q> 
               <q>He began to make <U+017F>erious reflections upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; his Head being fill'd with jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ies, that perhaps <U+017F>ome Per<U+017F>on of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity di<U+017F>grac'd at Court, and excited by di<U+017F>content, hatred, or revenge, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t his Per<U+017F>on, might by this means endeavour to get him into <U+017F>ome private place or another, there to <U+017F>erve him an <hi>Italian</hi> trick, without being any more to be heard of for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>All the good Fathers being got out of their Beds, and having weigh'd the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with deliberation, it was re<U+017F>olv'd,

that Father <hi>La Chai<U+017F>e,</hi> who was <U+017F>o dear to theirwhole Order, ought not to expo<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf to this hazard. The Rector be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of opinion, that <U+017F>ome body el<U+017F>e ought to be <U+017F>ent in his <U+017F>tead.

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Father <hi>La Chai<U+017F>e,</hi> who <U+017F>hews much zeal in matters relating to the Salvation of Souls, being mov'd at the<U+017F>e words; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the re<U+017F>t of the Fathers to let him perform his duty in a place whereto his Con<U+017F>cience call'd him; and <U+017F>o, in <U+017F>pite of all the di<U+017F><U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions of the Rector, Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and Father <hi>Bourdalou,</hi> who went down with him to the Gate, he re<U+017F>olv'd

to go, whatever might come of it. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore cro<U+017F>s'd him<U+017F>elf three times with the <U+017F>ign of the Cro<U+017F>s, he went into the Coach. The Coach-man, la<U+017F>hing the Hor<U+017F>es <U+017F>oundly with his Whip, drove away with a full Gallop. Father <hi>La Chai<U+017F>e,</hi> tho it was very dark, did take as much notice as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he could of all the Streets and by-lanes thro which they pa<U+017F>t; and tho he knew exactly all the places throughout that va<U+017F>t City; yet he was never able afterwards to find out any of tho<U+017F>e parts thro which he was convey'd; the Coach-man being order'd to drive round about <U+017F>ome parts of the Town, pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing and repa<U+017F><U+017F>ing <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times the <U+017F>ame Streets, the better to deceive the Father, and to prevent any di<U+017F>covery of tho<U+017F>e places thro which they went.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In the mean while Father <hi>La Chai<U+017F>e</hi> lying along the bottom of the Coach, began to make a thou<U+017F>and ominous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, accu<U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf of Imprudence to have <U+017F>o <U+017F>lightly expos'd him<U+017F>elf to the utmo<U+017F>t hazard of his Life. But as the ca<U+017F>e now <U+017F>tood, the be<U+017F>t advice he could take was, to <U+017F>et his Con<U+017F>cience at re<U+017F>t, and to prepare him<U+017F>elf for Death, in ca<U+017F>e he <U+017F>hould have occa<U+017F>ion to dye at that in<U+017F>tant. Conformably to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olution,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:109100:144"/>
he made a full Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of his Sins to Almighty God, begging par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for tho<U+017F>e that he had committed <U+017F>ince his la<U+017F>t Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and for all <U+017F>uch as might not then occur to his Memory, adding, that if he had done <U+017F>ome ill office to <U+017F>ome great Man or another with the King, who <U+017F>tir'd up by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred again<U+017F>t him, had re<U+017F>olv'd to make u<U+017F>e of this opportunity to draw him into a Snare, which <U+017F>hould co<U+017F>t him his Life; he pray'd God to forgive him, becau<U+017F>e the Station he was in, of being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>or to the greate<U+017F>t Monarch, made him again<U+017F>t his Will, often liable to the Di<U+017F>contents of the Courtiers, who laid claim to <U+017F>ome office or another, which were often be<U+017F>tow'd upon others, by his <U+017F>ollicitation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Having been thus perplex'd in his thoughts for a good half hour, he came to the place where he was to be <U+017F>et down. The Coach having <U+017F>topt, he <U+017F>aw a Foot-man coming out of a great Gate, which was all hung with black Cloath, that hid the Coat of Arms belonging to the Family, to keep it from his <U+017F>ight. The <U+017F>ame Foot-man, having in one Hand a Flamboy made of black Wax, open'd the door of the Coach, and with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand helpt our Father out, who
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:109100:145"/>
was conducted into a great and and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine Palace, all hung with black; <U+017F>everal Foot-men all with Flamboys made of black Wax in their Hands <U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Stair-foot, from whence they led him up Stairs, two <U+017F>tories high back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into a very fine Appartment. All the Dome<U+017F>tick Servants were cloathed in black, as were likewi<U+017F>e their Faces, <U+017F>hining as if they had been true Black-moors. This was contriv'd on purpo<U+017F>e to deceive Father <hi>la Chai<U+017F>e,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had <U+017F>een them a thou<U+017F>and times in his Life time, but was not able to give the lea<U+017F>t gue<U+017F>s at them under this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>e.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This Appartment was like all the re<U+017F>t, hung all over with black, and as <U+017F>oon as Father <hi>la Chai<U+017F>e</hi> was entered, all the Candles were put out at once, <U+017F>o that all upon a <U+017F>udden he was left quite in the dark, and conducted up to the other end of the Room, where a Chair was <U+017F>et for him under a Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, upon a piece of Tape<U+017F>try <U+017F>pread upon the floor. When he was <U+017F>et down, he could hear the voice of a Lady bewailing her <U+017F>elf, and imploring the mercy of a Per<U+017F>on, who as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood, was about to put her to death for her unfaithfulne<U+017F>s. <hi>Come, come, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>

The Abbot, having with one Hand, cover'd the Figure which repre<U+017F>ented the Magpye, the Mouths immediately di<U+017F>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd; <U+017F>o that nothing was <U+017F>een in the Cylinder but a Woman's Head, without a Mouth: Afterwards, having laid his Hand
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:109100:152"/>
upon one of the Eyes, that were painted on the Piece, I cou'd not <U+017F>ee any thing in the Cylinder, but one Eye.

            <p>
               <q>Ladys, <hi>reply'd the Duke</hi> du Maine, <U+017F>ince the<U+017F>e pieces of Gallantry do put you out of Humour, come let us have a touch at Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Abbot, <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>hew'd me among the re<U+017F>t, another Piece, which was no le<U+017F>s <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing than the former, and as far as I remember, I never <U+017F>aw any thing finer, and more curious in my Life time. Well, let us hear what it is, <U+017F>aid <hi>Mon<U+017F>ieur de Boufflers,</hi> but let me de<U+017F>ire you, Sir, not to offer any thing, to affront the fair Sex: I mu<U+017F>t needs tell you, that I am <U+017F>o very nice in that point, that I declare to you, I <U+017F>hall be ready to revenge their Quarrel, and even not to grudge, to employ my Sword in their ju<U+017F>t Defence, if there <U+017F>hou'd be occa<U+017F>ion for it. Wherefore Sir, <hi>added he <U+017F>miling,</hi> and you had be<U+017F>t have a care what you do. No, no, <hi>reply'd the Duke</hi> du Maine, this has no relation more to one Sex than the other; but all People are concern'd in it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Abbot <hi>Tallement</hi> <U+017F>hew'd me a large Painting, divided into three Columns: In the middle Column on the right hand, was repre<U+017F>ented, fir<U+017F>t of all, our Holy Father the Pope, as being the Chief of the Church, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him follow all the Cardinals; Arch-bi<U+017F>hops, Bi<U+017F>hops, Prelates, Abbots, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:109100:154"/>
and in general, all the re<U+017F>t of the Members of the Clergy. In the Column on the right <U+017F>ide, you might <U+017F>ee a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Portraitures, repre<U+017F>enting Temporal Princes, as Emperors, Monarchs, Kings and other Princes, follow'd by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and a multitude of Courtiers. The Column, which was on the left <U+017F>ide, was fill'd up, with the third E<U+017F>tate repre<U+017F>enting the Courts of Ju<U+017F>tice; where you might <U+017F>ee the Pictures of Lords Chief Ju<U+017F>tices and Judges, Ma<U+017F>ters of the Rolls, Coun<U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Attorneys, Sollicitors, Notaries, Tip<U+017F>taffs, Serjeants and <U+017F>uch like. So, that this whole Piece was fill'd up, with an infinite number of all <U+017F>orts of Per<U+017F>ons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the three E<U+017F>tates, every one in his Habit, according to the rank he bore in the Church, in the State or in the Courts of Judicature. The Abbot, after I had taken notice of the Medley, de<U+017F>ir'd me to put one Eye to a Hole at one end of the Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from thence to look upon the Cylinder which he had plac'd oppo<U+017F>ite to it, at the other end of it: All the<U+017F>e different Objects, having made a reflection upon the Cylinder of poli<U+017F>h'd Steel, this In<U+017F>trument did repre<U+017F>ent, no otherwi<U+017F>e, than in a Looking-gla<U+017F>s, a Death's Head, extremely well done; to put us in mind of the end of all Mortal Men, who in what <U+017F>tation <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

            <p>
               <q>I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure you, <hi><U+017F>aid Mon<U+017F>ieur</hi> Boufflers, this <U+017F>eems to me, to be one of the mo<U+017F>t curious Pieces that ever was made in the World, and I will give you my Word, that <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moi<U+017F>elle de Grammont</hi> and I, will to Morrow, do our <U+017F>elves the Honour to go and wait upon the Abbot, and take a view of all his Curio<U+017F>ities. But that which is mo<U+017F>t admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this Piece, is, <hi>added the Duke</hi> du Maine, that if you cover any part of the<U+017F>e Pictures, contain'd in the three Columns, with your Hand; the Death's Head, which is reflected in the Cylinder, appears defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and there is <U+017F>ome part or another of it wanting; to convince us, that none can be exempted from the unavoidable nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of Dying. We entreat you, <hi><U+017F>aid the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, directing their Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to the Duke</hi> du Maine, let us not talk any more of this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and frightful Subject, Death. Let us rather return to our Jollities, and divert our <U+017F>elves with <U+017F>ome Plea<U+017F>ant Story or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable at this time, when we are met together, on purpo<U+017F>e to be merry and plea<U+017F>ant. <hi>Mademoi<U+017F>elle de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> is mo<U+017F>t concern'd in the matter, and it is chiefly upon her account, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys de<U+017F>ire it. Becau<U+017F>e you will have it <U+017F>o, <hi><U+017F>aid the Duke</hi> du Maine, I will relate to you
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:109100:155"/>
another very extraordinary Story, which perhaps you will look upon, as one of the mo<U+017F>t refin'd pieces of Necromancy; the whole being altogether full of Gallantry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Abbot, continu'd he, having given us a view of all the Rarities in his Clo<U+017F>et, took me on one <U+017F>ide, whi<U+017F>pering me in the Ear.</q> 
               <hi>Pray my Lord, bring the Ladys who came along with you, into this Spacious Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have a mind to <U+017F>hew you the Ma<U+017F>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of all my Rarities; but don't you <U+017F>peak one word to 'em, you will divert your <U+017F>elf extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, provided you let 'em know nothing of the matter; becau<U+017F>e they will perhaps be unwilling to <U+017F>ee this Curio<U+017F>ity which indeed, will be very well worth your trrouble, and will undoubtedly give you more <U+017F>atisfaction, than any thing that you <U+017F>aw before.</hi> 
               <q>I went therefore, to fetch in the Ladys, and having taken the Dutche<U+017F>s <hi>de Chevreu<U+017F>e</hi> by the Hand, to lead her into a very fair and <U+017F>pacious Room, which was ju<U+017F>t by; the re<U+017F>t of the Ladys follow'd us thither. No <U+017F>ooner were we all enter'd the Room, but the Abbor, having drawn a Curtain, and open'd certain Windows; we look'd into a great Plain, which extended it <U+017F>elf beyond our Sight, and which appear'd to us, to be one of the be<U+017F>t and faire<U+017F>t Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skips in the World.</q>

For the Abbot, having drawn away the Curtain, which cover'd the Gla<U+017F>s, and told the Ladys, that they <U+017F>hou'd take notice of what they <U+017F>aw; they were very much <U+017F>urpris'd to <U+017F>ee the <U+017F>ame Dam<U+017F>el <U+017F>tark Naked in the Gla<U+017F>s, which made 'em put their hands before their Eyes, tho' at the <U+017F>ame time, they laugh'd as heartily as they cou'd. <q>Sir, <hi><U+017F>aid they,</hi> we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this, it being more than we are able to comprehend; and we know our

               <hi>You Dam<U+017F>el,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <hi>put on your Cloaths, and go from whence you come.</hi> This being done, he again took his Speaking Trumpet, and having call'd the Pea<U+017F>ant, he immediately appear'd in the Looking-gla<U+017F>s in the like manner, without any thing to cover his Nakedne<U+017F>s; at this Spectacle, the Ladys with blu<U+017F>hes in their Cheecks, run quite to the other end of the Room, tho' they cou'd not forbear laughing at the <U+017F>ame time.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For my part, <hi><U+017F>aid the Duke</hi> du Maine, I did all that lay in my Power, to make the Ladys return to the Looking-gla<U+017F>s, but cou'd not prevail upon 'em.

               <hi>Good faith! Sir,</hi> <U+017F>aid I, <hi>you are more skilful than all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians put together; I wi<U+017F>h I cou'd learn your Art, the better to divert <U+017F>ome Ladys at Court, who <U+017F>ometimes give me the Honour of a Vi<U+017F>it.</hi>

Nothing is more in e<U+017F>teem among us, than what is conceal'd from us, and it is perhaps that which makes Love reli<U+017F>h <U+017F>o well, and draws that re<U+017F>pect from you, which you pay to the fair Sex.</hi>
