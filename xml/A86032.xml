            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEfore the <U+017F>pace of five years, we have mutually communicated by written Papers <U+017F>omthing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Affect in privat meetings (which <U+017F>om of us Phy<U+017F>itians u<U+017F>e <U+017F>omtimes to have for Exerci<U+017F>e-<U+017F>ake in the works of Art) When the<U+017F> things had opened a way in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort to the deeper enquiry and <U+017F>earch after the condition and cure of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; We thought it might prove a very <U+017F>uccesful undertaking to recal tho<U+017F>e Papers once again to a Review; and (tho<U+017F>e things being called out which might be be<U+017F>t accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this u<U+017F>e) to prepare a perfect Tractate of this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>. That Care by common <U+017F>uffrage was entru<U+017F>ted to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <hi>Gli<U+017F><U+017F>on</hi> in the judgment of the re<U+017F>t had accuratly interweaved his part (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the finding out of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>) and in that had propounded many things different from the common Opinion of Phy<U+017F>itians (though perhaps the le<U+017F>s different from the truth) we altered our Re<U+017F>olution, and committed the fir<U+017F>t Stuff of the whol Work to be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

by him alone, le<U+017F>t at length the parts <U+017F>hould ari<U+017F>e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, mi<U+017F>hapen and <hi>heterogeneous</hi> to them<U+017F>elvs. He accepted the offer, but with this condition, that whil<U+017F>t he was employed in beautifying and adorning this part, the other two <U+017F>hould often hold con<U+017F>ultation with him, and confer unto the Wouf their Covenanants of free commerce by their own ob<U+017F>ervations concerning this Affect, and that tho<U+017F>e things which <U+017F>hould be delineated and <U+017F>haped by his labor and <U+017F>tudy, <U+017F>hould pre<U+017F>ently undergo the examination and judgment of the re<U+017F>t, as if they had been fa<U+017F>hioned by their hands. And <U+017F>o at the length we have brought this Work (<U+017F>uch as it is) to perfection, and have offered it to the publick view, being by no means moved therunto by an itch of writing (which is the Epidemical ill cu<U+017F>tom of this age) but by this Con<U+017F>ideration only, That becau<U+017F> we are not born for our <U+017F>elvs, we might make the<U+017F>e (<U+017F>uch as they are) common, which in <U+017F>om mea<U+017F>ure may advance the health of Infancy and tender age (in which for the pre<U+017F>ent a great part of Mankind, but for the future all Mankind is comprehended) and likewi<U+017F>e propagate an Encrea<U+017F> unto Learning: with this hope al<U+017F>o, That by this Example we may invite the Wits of other mo<U+017F>t lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men to make inqui<U+017F>ition into the E<U+017F><U+017F>ences of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es and their Cau<U+017F>es, and to examin the<U+017F>e our Labors that po<U+017F>terity may enjoy them yet more perfect. But the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cure E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and this our daring to tread in unbeaten paths (were we <U+017F>ilent) might obtain a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and mode<U+017F>tly chalenge a candid interpretation for all defects, lap<U+017F>es, and errors in the<U+017F>e our Endeavors. Finally, expect no fla<U+017F>hes of Rhetorick and Courtly-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;

exactne<U+017F>s doth delineate the condition and Idea of this evil.

this affect to be made lean, yet this doth not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in all alike, as in a right and true leanne<U+017F>s, but you may perceave the parts about the head and face to be in a thriving condition as to outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and well complexioned, even to the la<U+017F>t day of life. Finally, The Hydrocephalus is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently complicated with this affect, yet we have di<U+017F><U+017F>ected <U+017F>ome who<U+017F>e Brain hath been <U+017F>ufficiently firme, and not over-moi<U+017F>tned with this <U+017F>uperfluous humour. Some have conjectured that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is an imp or fruit of the French-pox or Scurvy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cending from the viciated Bodies of the Parents upon the Children: For we deny not but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, being infected with the Scurvy or the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Pox, may propagate and bring forth an I<U+017F><U+017F>ue, not only affected with that Pox &amp; Scurvy, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e infected with this evil, and this even hath al<U+017F>o faln under Ob<U+017F>ervation: yet for the mo<U+017F>t part this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e in the propriety of its E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, hath neither affinity nor familiarity with tho<U+017F>e affects, and be<U+017F>ides it requireth a different progre<U+017F>s of cure; we have <U+017F>ometimes likewi<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>erved a <U+017F>trumatical and <U+017F>welling Malady to be complicated with this; but we have al<U+017F>o many times beheld this to be well di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from that, and that from this.</p>
            <p>But why do we dwel <U+017F>o long upon this inqui<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <U+017F>eing that he, who wil accurately contemplate the <U+017F>igns of this affect, as in their due places they <U+017F>hal be propounded, may mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ily per<U+017F>wade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, That this is ab<U+017F>olutly a new Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and never de<U+017F>cribed by any of the Ancient or Modern Writers in their practical Books which are extant at this day, of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of Infants.</p>
            <p>But this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e became fir<U+017F>t known (as neer as

we could gather from the Relation of others after a <U+017F>edulous enquiry) about thirty years <U+017F>ince in the Counties of <hi>Dor<U+017F>et</hi> and <hi>Somer<U+017F>et,</hi> lying in the we<U+017F>tern part of <hi>England;</hi> <U+017F>ince which time the ob<U+017F>ervation of it hath been derived unto other places, as <hi>London, Oxford, Cambridge,</hi> and almo<U+017F>t all the Southern and We<U+017F>tern parts of the Kingdom: in the Nothern Counties this affect is very rarely <U+017F>een, and <U+017F>carcely yet made known among the Vulgar <U+017F>ort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>The mo<U+017F>t receaved and ordinary Name of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is, The RICKETS: But who baptiz'd it, and upon what occa<U+017F>ion, or for what rea<U+017F>on, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by chance or advice it was <U+017F>o named, is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
            </p>
            <p>However it obtained that Name, yet in <U+017F>o great a variety of places through which it hath ranged, it hath not to this day been known by any other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination.</p>
            <p>But it is an accident well worth our admiration, That this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e being new, and not long ago namele<U+017F>s, at lea<U+017F>t not known by this Name, neither <U+017F>preading <U+017F>o much in remote as in adjacent places, yet no man hitherto could be found out, who knew, or could <U+017F>hew, either the fir<U+017F>t Author of the Name, or the Patient to whom the appellation of the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e was fir<U+017F>t accommodated, or the peculier place where it was don, or the maner how it cam to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>per<U+017F>ed among the common people: for the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants having gotten a Name for the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave it with acquie<U+017F>cence as a thing done with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and deliberation, and are not at all further <U+017F>olicitous either about the Name, or the Author of the Name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:169706:7"/>
But becau<U+017F>e they which are expert in the Greek &amp; Latin tongues, may peradventure expect a Name from us, wherof <U+017F>ome kind of Rea<U+017F>on maybe given, we have made fit together divers Names to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, yet we conceave it <U+017F>omewhat unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to make a particular rehear<U+017F>al of them in this place: Neverthele<U+017F>s it may perhaps be proper and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to commemorate the Rules which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to our <U+017F>elves in the de<U+017F>ignation of the Name: The Fir<U+017F>t therefore was, That the Name <U+017F>hould comprehend <U+017F>ome notable condition of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. The Second was, That it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently di<U+017F>tinct from the Names of other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es and Symptoms. The Third was, That it <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>ufficiently familiar, ea<U+017F>ie of pronounciation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g>modated to the Memory, of no undecent length, and not <U+017F>tudiou<U+017F>ly, and laboriou<U+017F>ly compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

For we would not have any man to imagine that we here treat of <U+017F>ome Fictitious &amp; Imaginary Evil, much le<U+017F>s to expect that our Opinion <U+017F>hould be credulou<U+017F>ly embraced without examination. But this we rather aim at, That the matter of our Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e to all po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility may be known and precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the very entrance, that we may confirm tho<U+017F>e things which we <U+017F>hall propo<U+017F>e, by tho<U+017F>e things that are obvious to the Sen<U+017F>es, as occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and that the Reader being in<U+017F>tructed in the<U+017F>e, may become a competent judge of our Rea<U+017F>ons, and with the more facility be able to interpo<U+017F>e his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning each of them.

that many of us have been pre<U+017F>ent at <U+017F>everal Di<U+017F><U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Bodies which have been <U+017F>eparated by this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and that we will in this Chapter briefly and faithfully declare tho<U+017F>e things which we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto Ob<U+017F>erved by long experience and frequent Di<U+017F><U+017F>ections, namely, Tho<U+017F>e things which we have <U+017F>een with our eyes, and have handled with our hands.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Two things are here to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni<U+017F>hed: The former is, That the Reader carry in his memory, That the dead Bodies which we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened were mo<U+017F>t vehemently afflicted with this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e while<U+017F>t they were animated, for they are <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed for the mo<U+017F>t part to have yeelded to the very magnitude of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and therefore he mu<U+017F>t not expect that magnitude of the Affect or Symptoms which we here de<U+017F>cribe, in other Bodies yet living or newly be<U+017F>ieged. For every Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is moved to a Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, and then al<U+017F>o Nature being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed and unable to maintain the conflict groweth wor<U+017F>e and wor<U+017F>e. The latter is that the Reader take notice, That almo<U+017F>t all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es in proce<U+017F><U+017F>e of time, do unite unto them<U+017F>elves other affects of a different kind, and therefore that chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are for the mo<U+017F>t part complicated before death: Let him not therfore imagine that every preternatural thing that is found in dead Bodies, though de<U+017F>troyed by this affect, mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity belong to this evil; for perhaps it may rather have reference to <U+017F>ome other Di<U+017F>ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and hath a great latitude, and can be pre<U+017F>ent or ab<U+017F>ent without the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of the whole. Health con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts not in the former, but in the latter Con<U+017F>titution.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e in like manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>teth not in the E<U+017F><U+017F>ential Con<U+017F>titution:</hi> For <U+017F>o the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olution of the whole would by and by follow: But in the <hi>Accidental</hi> Con<U+017F>titution, namely <U+017F>uch an one, as in re<U+017F>pect of the whole can be pre<U+017F>ent or ab<U+017F>ent without its di<U+017F><U+017F>olution. We have <U+017F>aid (and not without rea<U+017F>on) that this Con<U+017F>titution wherein Health and Sickne<U+017F><U+017F>e are founded, is moveable and accidental in re<U+017F>pect of the whole; for even this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o in re<U+017F>pect of <U+017F>ome part may be e<U+017F><U+017F>ential: as for example, a finger being cut off, a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e ari<U+017F>eth in the defective number of the parts, which in re<U+017F>pect of the whole, is founded upon an accidental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution; for that finger may be pre<U+017F>ent or ab<U+017F>ent without the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of the whole; but in re<U+017F>pect of the lo<U+017F>t member it is founded upon an E<U+017F><U+017F>ential Con<U+017F>titution, for this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e being <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of that finger peri<U+017F>heth.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That the Con<U+017F>titution wherein the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence both of Health and Sickne<U+017F>s con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth, admits a threefold man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of divi<U+017F>ion or di<U+017F>tinction in the method of Di<U+017F>cipline.</hi> The fir<U+017F>t is <U+017F>omewhat thick, and is re<U+017F>olved into parts altogether Concrete, namely, It proceedeth <hi>Kata topous,</hi> according to the divi<U+017F>ion of the parts from head to heel.

of magnitude, number, <U+017F>ite and continuity. The third is as it were a middle manner, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath been hitherto neglected, yet we dare avouch, That it may have its u<U+017F>e, and that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible one, in the handling of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and the finding out of the cau<U+017F>es of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; and it is divided into a Con<U+017F>titution Natural, Vital, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fir<U+017F>t is proper to, and inherent in every part, ab<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely competible to it, and without any dependance upon the other parts according to the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of it <U+017F>imply:</hi> This remaineth a while after death, till it be re<U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Putrefaction, Ambu<U+017F>tion, <U+017F>imple Exiccati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Mummification, Petrification, and the like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Cau<U+017F>es. This Con<U+017F>titution in re<U+017F>pect of its <U+017F>imple E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, doth not depend upon tho<U+017F>e Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which mini<U+017F>ter an Influx, but it dependeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them both in re<U+017F>pect of its Con<U+017F>ervation, and likewi<U+017F>e of its Operation. For the vital influx cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing after death (which is as it were the <U+017F>alt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment of it) quickly peri<U+017F>heth, and as long as the creature liveth, this is variou<U+017F>ly affected by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes, and thereupon the actions are either promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or interupted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Second is the Vital Con<U+017F>titution, which is produced by that continual influx from the heart thorow the arteries into the parts of the whole Body.</hi> This al<U+017F>o it admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth degrees, and is often <U+017F>ubject to variations more or le<U+017F><U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ometimes al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eemeth to <U+017F>uffer a kind of eclips, as in a <U+017F>wouning, a <U+017F>yncope, &amp;c. yet it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>evereth from the beginning to the la<U+017F>t period of life (at lea<U+017F>t in its fountain, and in <U+017F>ome other parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Third is the Animal Con<U+017F>titution, which is derived</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:169706:15"/>
               <hi>from the Brain thorow the Nerves into the Organs of Sen<U+017F>e and Motion.</hi> This is many times totally wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in many parts, the life notwith<U+017F>tanding remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yea it might for a long time together be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in <U+017F>everal parts, or all the parts, did not re<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is ab<U+017F>olute nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary unto life, depend upon it. The<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>titutions therefore keep <U+017F>uch a connexion between them<U+017F>elves, that the <U+017F>econd doth eternally and continually pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tence of the former, and the third of the <U+017F>econd; but there is not back again <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>olute a dependance between them, becau<U+017F>e (as we have even now <U+017F>aid) the former can for <U+017F>ome time <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t without the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the <U+017F>econd commonly altogether without the third: And the<U+017F>e three Con<U+017F>titutions may in mo<U+017F>t bodies be manife<U+017F>tly perceived, yet we affirm not that they may be found in all. The Natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and the Vital are wanting to no part: but the Animal is defective in the Bones (though the teeth will admit <U+017F>ome doubt) gri<U+017F>tles, perhaps ligaments, and <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances as of the Liver, Spleen, &amp;c. we a<U+017F><U+017F>ert therefore this threefold Con<U+017F>titution to be in all tho<U+017F>e parts, to whom the Natural, Vital, and Animal Faculty is communicated. For although the<U+017F>e Faculties as to the fir<U+017F>t act may be <U+017F>aid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Soul (which relation hath indeed no relation to the Medicinal art) yet in re<U+017F>pect of the <U+017F>econd act they are nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily rooted in <U+017F>ome mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Con<U+017F>titution of the parts to which they belong. For whereas <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay that the Vital Faculty is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Heart, and the Animal from the Brain unto the other parts, that mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>o be under<U+017F>tood, as if the Faculties them<U+017F>elves in a wandring manner were tran<U+017F>ient from part to part (for the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169706:15"/>
an accident from <U+017F>ubject to <U+017F>ubject cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any under<U+017F>tanding) but that the Vital Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is derived with, and in the vital Spirit from the Heart unto the parts, or at lea<U+017F>t is excited by <U+017F>ome motion of the Heart and Arteries in the parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, and in like manner the Animal Faculty doth de<U+017F>cend in and with the Animal Spirit by the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, or is produced in the parts by <U+017F>ome motion of the Nerves in the Brain. Which way <U+017F>oever it comes to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, we mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F><U+017F>e that <U+017F>ome alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is imprinted in the part it <U+017F>elf receiving it either from the <U+017F>aid Spirits, or from their motions. Which alteration as it is here granted to be the root of the Faculty, either Vital, or Animal in the re<U+017F>pective parts, <U+017F>o is it a moveable Con<U+017F>titution, becau<U+017F>e it can be variou<U+017F>ly changed, remitted, and intended without the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of the whole; and it is the Con<U+017F>titution wherein either Health or Sickne<U+017F><U+017F>e may con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeing that when<U+017F>oever alteration is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient unto the parts wherein it ought to be, or any other wayes admini<U+017F>tred then is requi<U+017F>ite, the action will thereupon be unavoidably depraved; but if it be rightly performed, then <U+017F>ound and perfect health is <U+017F>aid to be pre<U+017F>ent from the part of that Con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Con<U+017F>idering therefore that there are two kind of Alterations be<U+017F>ides the natural and inherent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution, one from the influx of the Heart, another from the influx of the Brain in mo<U+017F>t parts; and <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <U+017F>aid alterations, as they them<U+017F>elves are more perfect or more imperfect, do render the Faculties in the re<U+017F>pective parts (at lea<U+017F>t as to the <U+017F>econd act) more perfect or imperfect, and that the actions are thereupon depraved or <U+017F>ound, it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that this threefold Con<U+017F>titution re<U+017F>ide in mo<U+017F>t of the parts,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169706:16"/>
and that the <U+017F>aid kind of alterations be medical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titutions whereon Health and Sickne<U+017F><U+017F>e may be grounded.</p>
            <p>That this Divi<U+017F>ion or Di<U+017F>tinction is not frivolous or altogether unprofitable, appeareth from hence, becau<U+017F>e the practical Phy<U+017F>itians in their Methods do rightly admoni<U+017F>h, that in ob<U+017F>cure Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es the Faculties mu<U+017F>t be accurately ob<U+017F>erved, when their actions are <U+017F>een to be depraved, which diligence may <U+017F>erve as it were for a Manuduction to guide us to the Origine of the affect; now if it be a con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t importance to note the interupted Faculties in Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, certainly it will be an exerci<U+017F>e of no le<U+017F><U+017F>e moment to take cognizance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titutions them<U+017F>elves, upon which tho<U+017F>e Faculties have an immediate and <U+017F>trict dependance.</p>
            <p>Now lea<U+017F>t any man <U+017F>hould conceive that there is almo<U+017F>t a coincidence between this third Divi<U+017F>ion and the <U+017F>econd, he may ob<U+017F>erve, if he will diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh the matter, That every member of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ion doth in <U+017F>ome manner include al the members of the next precedent, namely that the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution doth comprehend primarily indeed the <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar Con<U+017F>titution, but that <U+017F>econdarily and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the whole creature, it containeth in a <U+017F>ort the conformation and continuity; in like manner that the Vital and Animal Con<U+017F>titution do in their way <U+017F>o clearly participate of all the Members of the <U+017F>aid Divi<U+017F>ion, that to offer proofs of it were an unnece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary undertaking: Only we de<U+017F>ire the Reader to take notice (which al<U+017F>o we even now intimated) That the natural Con<U+017F>titution primarily and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally hath re<U+017F>pect unto the temperament, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon qualities, the plenty of the Spirits, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar

di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of them (which by <U+017F>ome are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the form and the whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance) but that it hath re<U+017F>pect unto the manner of the Organe and the continuity as it were <U+017F>econdarily, and in order to the whole creature, and that it can <U+017F>carce be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e hurt or vitiated by them. Yet we mu<U+017F>t not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that the natural Con<U+017F>titution is <U+017F>ometimes vitiated as it is meerly Organical, for thus it falleth out in the ob<U+017F>tructions of the natural pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages; as for example, when a <U+017F>tone is impacted or grown to hardne<U+017F><U+017F>e in the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Meter or the yard, and in the like ca<U+017F>es: but this happeneth unto it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially in as much as the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age is ordained for the u<U+017F>e and con<U+017F>ervation of the whole; but for the mo<U+017F>t part the Organical vices in the natural Con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution are of le<U+017F><U+017F>e note and con<U+017F>ideration then the <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e things may <U+017F>uffice to be <U+017F>poken in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way of this triple Con<U+017F>titution. We will now in particular <U+017F>peak a few things of them in few words.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Natural Con<U+017F>titution</hi> which is proper unto and inherent in every part, may be known by this di<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, That it is the manner of the natural Being, <U+017F>etled in the parts, competible to them, in as much as they are aptly con<U+017F>tituted by their temperament, and common quallities, by their <U+017F>ufficient portion and convenient di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of ingenerated Spirits, and by their ju<U+017F>t conformation and continuity, to a perfect performance of natural actions, together with the concurrence of the Vital (and perhaps the Animal) influx. Therefore when there is in any part a ju<U+017F>t temperament, convenient common qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, an exqui<U+017F>ite proportion, and harmonious di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169706:17"/>
of inherent Spirits. Finally, when there is a laudable conformation and unity, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding all this, the natural action is depraved, we may well conclude that it is not vitiated by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Con<U+017F>titution, but by rea<U+017F>on of the concurrent cau<U+017F>e, namely the vital or natural influx, or of both together; for the natural actions in creatures in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the union and wedlock of life, are exalted to a more eminent condition then otherwi<U+017F> they would attain unto by the natural Con<U+017F>titution alone. And from hence it comes to pa<U+017F><U+017F>e, That although the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Con<U+017F>titution in <U+017F>lain Creatures remaineth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death undepraved for a while, yet the attractive and retentive Faculty, the concoction of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the expul<U+017F>ion of the exctement do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether cea<U+017F>e: And in Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es al<U+017F>o many times the natural Con<U+017F>titution is at fir<U+017F>t untoucht, yet the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural action is vitiated meerly by the defect of the due concurrence of the vital influx: after the <U+017F>ame manner <U+017F>omttimes the natural and vital Con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being <U+017F>ound and healthful, yet <U+017F>ome natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is depraved by rea<U+017F>on of the defect of <U+017F>ome ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal influx and concurence: but this for the mo<U+017F>t part happeneth only in the Nervous, Fibrous, and Membranous parts, e<U+017F>pecially where they make a hollowne<U+017F><U+017F>e, but <U+017F>eldom or not at all in the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance of the parts: As in the Pal<U+017F>y the excrements are many times unduly retained, by rea<U+017F>on only of the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>iblne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the guts, the other con<U+017F>titutions being <U+017F>ound. Therefore in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es, when <U+017F>ome natural action is hurt, we mu<U+017F>t not pre<U+017F>ently conclude that the natural Con<U+017F>titution is fir<U+017F>t vitiated, but we mu<U+017F>t with dilligence enquire out that Con<U+017F>titution which is fir<U+017F>t vitiated, for that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169706:17"/>
is to be looked upon as the root and fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the evil; in like manner if <U+017F>ome vital action be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, we mu<U+017F>t not pre<U+017F>ently infer that the vital Con<U+017F>titution is primarily vitiated; becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the fir<U+017F>t Origin is more rightly deduced from the natural, or perhaps the animal Con<U+017F>titution: as for example, Through the inten<U+017F>ivene<U+017F><U+017F>e of cold, a finger is mortified by inflamation: in this ca<U+017F>e it is true that the influx of the vital bloud is plainly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; yet the beginning of that interception mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ought out in the natural Con<U+017F>titution of that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part <U+017F>o benumned: So al<U+017F>o in a Convul<U+017F>ion the circulation of the bloud is perhaps <U+017F>omething di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turbed and interupted; but the fir<U+017F>t depravation mu<U+017F>t be a<U+017F>cribed to the animal, not to the vital Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution. On the contrary, in a Feaver the Head is invaded, but the <U+017F>ource of the evil will peradventure be found out in the vital Con<U+017F>titution: <U+017F>o perhaps the Fle<U+017F>h is wa<U+017F>ted, and al the natural Spirits are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed; yet the root of the evil wil be found out in the vital, not in the natural Con<U+017F>titution: So that any Con<U+017F>titution of the three before named may be in <U+017F>everal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, <U+017F>ometimes the fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ometimes the <U+017F>econd, and <U+017F>ometimes the third cau<U+017F>e of vitiated actions.</p>
            <p>Not only many other parts of the body (yea <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply al the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible) which exhibit not an influx, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient as delatory parts, do naturally admit this threefold Con<U+017F>titution, but be<U+017F>ides al<U+017F>o even the Heart it <U+017F>elf, and all the arteries, and the Brain and al the nerves, <U+017F>o that the Brain (excepting the fault in its natural Con<U+017F>titution) may be cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed and helped by the vital Spirit which is tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thorow the veins and the arteries, being wel

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He<U+017F>e things being Pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, We <U+017F>hal proceed to enquir in what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution of the parts the fir<U+017F>t Root or E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this affect is lodged. Be the fir<U+017F>t Conclu<U+017F>ion therefore this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Fir<U+017F>t Root of this Affect is not in the Animal Con<U+017F>titution, or in that which dependeth upon the Influx of the Brain into the parts.</hi> Indeed we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>e that al the nerves which without the Skul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <U+017F>pinal marrow, are found to be loo<U+017F>e and weak in this affect; yet this doth not here <U+017F>eem to ari<U+017F>e from a defect of the influx of the Brain, which we thus prove, Fir<U+017F>t the loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169706:18"/>
of the nerves, which cometh primarily from the Brain, is almo<U+017F>t alwayes con<U+017F>ociated with <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolency and drow<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e; but this Symptom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth but rarely, and by accident only in this affect. Secondly, As we remember, we never knew the Pal<U+017F>y, or the Apoplexy to <U+017F>upervene or follow upon this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; but it ought nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily <U+017F>o to do, and that very often (at lea<U+017F>t in the confirmation of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e) if this loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e and weakne<U+017F>s of the nerves <U+017F>hould take beginning from a defect of the influx of the Brain. Thirdly, We have ob<U+017F>erved the Brain to be <U+017F>ufficiently firm and inculpable in many di<U+017F><U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted after death. Fourthly, For the mo<U+017F>t part tho<U+017F>e that are afflicted with this evil are ingenious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect of their age, which doth evidently atte<U+017F>t the vigour and vivacity of the Brain.</p>
            <p>The Second Conclu<U+017F>ion. <hi>The fir<U+017F>t root of this affect is not in the Vital Con<U+017F>titution, or in that which dependeth upon the Influx of the Heart into the parts.</hi> An unequal di<U+017F>tribution of bloud indeed almo<U+017F>t (if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) perpetual may be ob<U+017F>erved in this affect: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F><U+017F>e the chief rea<U+017F>on of this inequality mu<U+017F>t be a<U+017F>cribed, not to the inequa<U+017F>ity of the influx of the Heart or Arteries, but to the unequal reception and unaptne<U+017F><U+017F>e in the parts them<U+017F>elves to receive it; for the Heart and the Arteries do for their part indi<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately or equally di<U+017F>tribute the bloud with the Spirits every way into the parts. But if it <U+017F>o fal out that an Artery of <U+017F>ome part be interupted in his fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by rea<U+017F>on of the benumnedne<U+017F><U+017F>e and <U+017F>tupefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that part, or the parts adjacent, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity that the bloud mu<U+017F>t be minutely tran<U+017F>mitted thither, and <U+017F>o unequally in re<U+017F>pect of the other parts which expeditely and aptly receave the bloud.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169706:19"/>
Therefore in this ca<U+017F>e this inequality of di<U+017F>tribution doth properly and primarily depend upon a preexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tent fault without the artery pertaining to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Con<U+017F>titution of the parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But <U+017F>ome may Object, <hi>Although perhaps the afore<U+017F>aid inequality hath no dependance upon the Heart, yet it may <U+017F>o happen that a weak Pul<U+017F>e may <U+017F>uffice to di<U+017F>tribute the bloud thorow the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Circulations in the inner parts, which neverthele<U+017F>s may not be altogether <U+017F>o <U+017F>ufficient to undergo that duty thorow the greater Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the outward parts which are more remote from the Heart, the fountain of bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<U+017F>w.</hi> We An<U+017F>wer, That this Objection was formerly of <U+017F>o great importance with one of us, that he <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch an inequality of the vital influx did belong to the prime E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and did therefore endeavour to deduce the rea<U+017F>on of the fir<U+017F>t Symptoms from it. But after <U+017F>econd thoughts, the matter being more neerly and deeply examined, he was of Opinion, That this inequality of the vital in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux had no relation to the primary, but to the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. But we return to the <U+017F>olution of the Argument. And Fir<U+017F>t we grant indeed that in this affect there is an unequal di<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the bloud; and that in the internal parts and in the head it is more liberal, in the external more <U+017F>paring. Secondly we grant that the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the bloud may be kept in the inward parts, even although no Pul<U+017F>e apear in the outward parts; but this happeneth only in a vehement either weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e or oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the vital Spirits, as in a <U+017F>woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a <U+017F>trong hy<U+017F>terical paroxi<U+017F>m, or fit of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169706:19"/>
Mother, in which affect <U+017F>ome that have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for dead have been <U+017F>een to revive again. Thirdly we grant that a more liberal Circulation of the bloud may be in the internal then the external parts, yea and in <U+017F>ome one external part more then in another, as it happeneth in the inflamation of <U+017F>ome external member.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e things being granted, we affirm, that in the <hi>fir<U+017F>t Ca<U+017F>e</hi> the inequality of the di<U+017F>tribution of the bloud doth not principally depend upon the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the Pul<U+017F>ifical vertue for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the heart; and the rea<U+017F>on hereof is plain. For the heart, as we have already <U+017F>aid, doth emit the bloud indi<U+017F>criminatly or equally, and with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation from it <U+017F>elf into the Aorta or chief artery, even at <U+017F>uch time when as the Pul<U+017F>e is mo<U+017F>t weak. This artery doth exonerate or disburthen it <U+017F>elf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with al po<U+017F><U+017F>ible expedition, and from hence proceedeth the inequality of the diffu<U+017F>ion of the bloud, as the bloud is more ea<U+017F>ily impelled from on rivelet then from another. This inequality not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding mu<U+017F>t not properly and primarily be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the heart, but to the recipient parts, and to the particular tran<U+017F>mitting arteries. For any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary affect of the heart is nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily univer<U+017F>al, and communicated to al the parts of the body: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although we grant this enequality of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the bloud to be in the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, yet we exclude it from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary.</p>
            <p>Moreover in the <hi>Second Ca<U+017F>e</hi> propounded, we <U+017F>ay that there is a great di<U+017F>parity between the ca<U+017F>es of extream nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, and ordinary ca<U+017F>es. Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed do we know whether in the <U+017F>aid ca<U+017F>es the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169706:20"/>
in the inward parts, how<U+017F>oever it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, be of any moment. And for <U+017F>o much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the pre<U+017F>ent bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F><U+017F>e, we deny any <U+017F>uch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the heart in this affect, that the Pul<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould be defective in the outward parts; yea we have not ob<U+017F>erved that any one afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e hath been prone to fal into an extacy, or a <U+017F>woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which would readily happen if the origin of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e were rooted in the debility of the heart it <U+017F>elf. Be<U+017F>ides when we have <U+017F>een <U+017F>uch as were <U+017F>ick in their tender age, to endure without any lo<U+017F>s of <U+017F>trength <U+017F>ometimes a liberal eduction or flowing forth of the bloud from the opened veins of their ears, yea and <U+017F>een it <U+017F>ometimes reiterated with good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>e. Finally, When al<U+017F>o they have very wel endured purgations, with re<U+017F>pect had to their age, it doth not appear to us how the fir<U+017F>t root of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil can be a<U+017F>cribed to the weakne<U+017F>s of the vital con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Third Ca<U+017F>e</hi> it is evidently manife<U+017F>t that the fir<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of this unequal circulation of the bloud is <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of an outward part, as in an infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med member, laboring under <U+017F>ome private Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, there happeneth a more ful and impetuous Pul<U+017F>e by rea<U+017F>on of the accidental heat of the artery, infu<U+017F>ed by the immoderation of heat which is in that outward part.</p>
            <p>Therefore <U+017F>eing that the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this affect cannot be primarily rooted in the animal nor the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Con<U+017F>titution of the parts (as we have now <U+017F>hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) it followeth (which <U+017F>hal be the Third Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion) <hi>That the primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, or fir<U+017F>t root of this affect, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the proper or inherent con<U+017F>titution of the parts.</hi> But becau<U+017F>e the natural Con<U+017F>titution (as we have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169706:20"/>
<U+017F>aid above) con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth partly in the common quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the temperament, and partly in a ju<U+017F>t plenty and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the inherent Spirits, and again partly in the organical con<U+017F>truction and continuity; our next enquiry mu<U+017F>t be to find out in which of the prementioned con<U+017F>titutions it lodgeth, and whether it be rooted in one alone, or in many, or in altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Be the Fourth Conclu<U+017F>ion therefore this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This affect is not radicated in the Organical Con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the parts.</hi> For although in progre<U+017F><U+017F>e of time the Organs them<U+017F>elves are divers wayes affected in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect of their conformation, quantity, and <U+017F>ite, as it is <U+017F>ufficiently manife<U+017F>t from the encrea<U+017F>ed bulk of the head, liver, &amp;c. from the tumours of the bones unto the wre<U+017F>ts, the ankls and the extremities of the ribs; from various ob<U+017F>tructions and the extenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the outward parts; <U+017F>eing neverthele<U+017F><U+017F>e that al the<U+017F>e things depend upon a higher origin<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever al<U+017F>o we may nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily admit the<U+017F>e things in a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e confirmed, and now variou<U+017F>ly compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet in the original E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, we pre<U+017F>ume, for the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent rea<U+017F>ons they are to be rejected.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, <hi>Becau<U+017F>e the depravations afore<U+017F>aid in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical parts do not appear pre<U+017F>ently in the beginning of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, but encrea<U+017F>e afterwards by little and little:</hi> And although perhaps <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e may be <U+017F>aid from the beginning to have taken root in the body, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding they cannot as yet be immediatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cerned by the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, neither do they manife<U+017F>tly hurt any actions, and for that rea<U+017F>on they cannot apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Becau<U+017F>e the Organical vices afore<U+017F>aid are not the Cau<U+017F>es but the Effects rather of the chief Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms which from the beginning exhibit them<U+017F>elves in this</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:169706:21"/>
               <hi>affect.</hi> For the augmented figure of the head, liver, &amp;c. the <U+017F>tanding out of the bones, and the leanne<U+017F><U+017F>e of the external parts, are more rightly refered to the inequality of the nouri<U+017F>hment, then on the contrary the inequality of the nouri<U+017F>hment <U+017F>hould be a<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to them: For when one part doth exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively encrea<U+017F>e, and another is defrauded of a due &amp; decent augmentation, there is a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that a di<U+017F>proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and an unequal nouri<U+017F>hment mu<U+017F>t not only be pre<U+017F>ent in the parts, but al<U+017F>o have had a preexi<U+017F>tence in the body, whereby one part is nouri<U+017F>hed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother neglected beneath a mediocrity. But <U+017F>eeing this unequal nouri<U+017F>hment is a depraved action, and <U+017F>o a Symptom pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ome preexi<U+017F>tent Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e, and yet withal (as we have <U+017F>aid) doth precede, as a cau<U+017F>e, the organical vices afore<U+017F>aid, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t that tho<U+017F>e organical vices are not the fir<U+017F>t root of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. As for the ob<U+017F>tructions which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are for the mo<U+017F>t part conjoyned with this affect, yet neverthele<U+017F><U+017F>e there is a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on to exclude them from the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, becau<U+017F>e they neither <U+017F>pecificate the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e, neither can any rea<U+017F>on of the Symptoms be rendered from them, neither do they perpetually be<U+017F>iege <U+017F>ome certain and determinate noble part. Some man perhaps, who hath re<U+017F>pect to the exce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive magnitude of the liver, may object that in this affect that is perpetually ob<U+017F>tructed, and thereupon the <U+017F>anguification being vitiated the other things are prepo<U+017F>teriou<U+017F>ly derived; but if this <U+017F>welling of the Liver did alwayes proceed from the ob<U+017F>truction of it, then a palene<U+017F><U+017F>e of complexion, a cachexia or indige<U+017F>tion, and by the advantage of time, the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>hould nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily and perpetually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

this affect: Moreover, The Liver <U+017F>hould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be <U+017F>een to be vitiated in the colour, and at the di<U+017F><U+017F>ection hard tumors and knots <U+017F>hould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved in the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of it, e<U+017F>pecially in an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate affect, and that which killed the Patient; but <U+017F>eing the<U+017F>e things do not frequently (much le<U+017F><U+017F>e perpetually) occur in dead bodies, the augmented bulk of it mu<U+017F>t rather be refered to the irregular nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition: Moreover, we deny it not but that we have ob<U+017F>erved by Anatomy in tho<U+017F>e who have peri<U+017F>hed of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, ob<U+017F>tructions, various tumours, and knotty excre<U+017F>cencies in the Lungs, but we atte<U+017F>t withal, That we have <U+017F>een <U+017F>ome Infants, yea Boys lightly affected with this evil, in whom there was no <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of vitiated Lungs, for there was no cough, no impediment of re<U+017F>piration, which nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>arily is an individual companion of the ob<U+017F>truction of the Lungs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becau<U+017F>e a <U+017F>ufficient rea<U+017F>on of all the Symptoms proper to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, may more cleerly and ea<U+017F>ily be derived from other fountains, as we <U+017F>hal <U+017F>ee anon.</p>
            <p>And thus we have <U+017F>ufficiently proved, That this affect in re<U+017F>pect of the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of it, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts not in the Organical Con<U+017F>titution of the natural parts. The <U+017F>ame arguments wil more effectually convince (more might be produced, but we judge accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary) That this evil is not radicated in the continuity of the natural parts, <U+017F>o that there needs no more words to prove it.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Conclu<U+017F>ion. <hi>This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is primarily rooted in the <U+017F>imilary Con<U+017F>titution of the natural parts:</hi> And therefore in re<U+017F>pect of the radical E<U+017F><U+017F>ence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is a <U+017F>imilary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. And becau<U+017F>e a <U+017F>imilary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169706:22"/>
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, as <U+017F>uch, is not perpetually Simple, but <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times variou<U+017F>ly compounded (namely a Di<U+017F>temper is either Simple, or Compound, and this becomes <U+017F>uch, not only by the fir<U+017F>t qualities among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, but perhaps by hidden qualities conjoyned together; or, which is more agreeable to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, e<U+017F>pecially in the pre<U+017F>ent bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, by a kind of <U+017F>ure proportion and medification of the inherent Spirits) We judg this to be a Compound Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and we a<U+017F><U+017F>ert the <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>radical</hi> E<U+017F><U+017F>ence thereof to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in a cold and moi<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>temper, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and <hi><U+017F>tupefaction</hi> of the inherent Spirits, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the inherent con<U+017F>titution of the parts prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily affected. But before we proceed to an higher Explication of this Opinion, we wil premi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome Limitations of it.</p>
            <p>The Fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>hal be this: <hi>That in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ome parts of the Body are Primarily, and others Secondarily affected:</hi> And truly, to us the External parts <U+017F>eem <U+017F>ooner to be affected than the Brain and Bowels, as we <U+017F>hall declare more at large when we come to <U+017F>peak of the parts affected.</p>
            <p>The Second is this: <hi>That in tho<U+017F>e parts alone which are Primarily affected, do labor under a notable cold Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper with penury and <U+017F>tupefaction of <U+017F>pirits:</hi> For the Brain perhaps and the Bowels may be moderatly hot, and <U+017F>ufficiently abound with Spirits, by rea<U+017F>on of the copious vital influx; and moi<U+017F>ture may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in them by rea<U+017F>on of the affu<U+017F>ion of our over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plentiful aliment: but the other External parts are alwaies affected with a cold and moi<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>temper, and a benumedne<U+017F>s of the natural Spirit, &amp;c. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, that in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e they are prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily affected, and that they alone are the <U+017F>eat of the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:169706:22"/>
Be this the Third: <hi>All the External parts, and tho<U+017F>e fir<U+017F>t affected, do not equally labor under a cold and moi<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>temper, and with benumedne<U+017F>s of Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. For the Ligaments, Tendons, and Nerves, are in their own nature more cold, and le<U+017F>s moi<U+017F>t; the Mu<U+017F>cles, or fle<U+017F>hy parts are rather more moi<U+017F>t, and le<U+017F>s cold: the skinny parts u<U+017F>ually retain a mediocrity, yet al the <U+017F>aid parts recede more or le<U+017F>s from the natural towards a cold and moi<U+017F>t temper. And in like manner, although <U+017F>ome of the <U+017F>aid parts do require a greater plenty and activity of Spirits than others, yet al of them a ju<U+017F>t proportion, being ob<U+017F>erved to the plenty and activity re<U+017F>pectively due to each of them, are defective and de<U+017F>titute of that ju<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. The prepo<U+017F>ed Opinion is examined by Parts. Fir<U+017F>t, That this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is a cold Di<U+017F>temper. An Objection, and the An<U+017F>wer thereunto; That it is moi<U+017F>t: That it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury or paucity of the Spirits. An Objection, with the An<U+017F>wer. Finally, That this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the <U+017F>tupefaction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow let us more neerly examin the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion propo<U+017F>ed, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ert it by parts.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, That the parts fir<U+017F>t affected do labor under a cold di<U+017F>temper may be proved. Fir<U+017F>t, from the unequal and dimini<U+017F>hed nutrition of the <U+017F>aid parts; for as the inborn heat when it is augmented to a ju<U+017F>t propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth very much conduce to further the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Aliment; <U+017F>o if it be too remi<U+017F>s, it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily retardeth and le<U+017F><U+017F>eneth the <U+017F>ame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>temper is proved from the <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s and unaptne<U+017F>s to motion; and al<U+017F>o from the aver<U+017F>ation to exerci<U+017F>e, and de<U+017F>ire to re<U+017F>t. For as the activity and agility of the Body is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Heat, <U+017F>o the tardity and <U+017F>lothfulne<U+017F>s of it is in great part a<U+017F>cribed to Cold, Namely, <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ing (as before) that this <U+017F>lothfulne<U+017F>s hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169706:23"/>
upon the fault of the animal influx.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is further confirmed, becau<U+017F>e this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e many times followeth other accute Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, whereby they end not <U+017F>eldom (after the Wa<U+017F>t or Con<U+017F>umption of the Natural heat) in a cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper.</p>
            <p>Be<U+017F>ides, It al<U+017F>o receiveth Chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es which extenuate the Body, and <U+017F>uch as in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are prone to leave a cold di<U+017F>temper behind them as Pertinacious Ob<U+017F>tructions, the Scurvy, Cachexy &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>ucceedeth the importune <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Scabbedne<U+017F>s, and Impetiginous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as we have often ob<U+017F>erved, when the Scabs have newly broken out again, and the Itch is revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <U+017F>uch Boyes have been ea<U+017F>ily re<U+017F>tored to health, becau<U+017F>e by that means the Natural heat is reaugmented in the outward Members.</p>
            <p>La<U+017F>tly, Becau<U+017F>e many times it happeneth after a continual u<U+017F>e of cold, thick, and vi<U+017F>cous aliment, after <U+017F>urfeting and idlene<U+017F>s, and the like evident cau<U+017F>es, either dimini<U+017F>hing or overwhelming the Natural heat.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is yet more plainly evinced, becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e helps which excite, augment, and cheri<U+017F>h the heat in the outward parts, as various agitations, rubbings, and anointing of the Body, do contribute a large <U+017F>hare to the advancement of this Cure. The<U+017F>e things being all ca<U+017F>t together into a heap, it is <U+017F>ufficiently con<U+017F>picuous that a cold di<U+017F>temper of the Natural con<U+017F>titution of the parts fir<U+017F>t affected is contained in the primary e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> But here we meet with a <U+017F>pecious Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That a little Feaver, e<U+017F>pecially a <U+017F>low one, or <U+017F>uch
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169706:24"/>
as is erratical and wandering, is frequently conjoyned with this affect, which at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>eemeth ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with a cool di<U+017F>temper. For all Feavers by all men are accounted to be a hot di<U+017F>temper which is diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppo<U+017F>ite to the <U+017F>aid e<U+017F><U+017F>ence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We An<U+017F>wer (that we may not here interpo<U+017F>e any thing concerning the e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a Feaver) we free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, for <U+017F>o much as concerns the pre<U+017F>ent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tion, that a Feaver is a hot di<U+017F>temper; but this doth not chiefly con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the Natural con<U+017F>titution of the parts, but in the vital con<U+017F>titution, namely in the influent heat preternaturally affected. For a Feaver is not <U+017F>ome private Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, but univer<U+017F>al, and is diffu<U+017F>ed from the Heart through the Arteries in and with the vital Spirit, be it either overheated, or otherwi<U+017F>e viciated. For this preternatural heat hath only a re<U+017F>pect to that inherent as a cau<U+017F>e potent and able variou<U+017F>ly to alter it, yet indeed by degrees and little and little. For fir<U+017F>t the influent heat is manife<U+017F>tly an actual heat, but the heat of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral con<U+017F>titution is only potential: wherefore we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that a cold di<U+017F>temper in re<U+017F>pect of a natural and potential heat may con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t with a hot di<U+017F>temper in re<U+017F>pect of an actual and influent heat. For indeed an actual heat is not <U+017F>o directly aver<U+017F>e to a cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> which is <U+017F>o called by rea<U+017F>on of a defect of the potential heat, but it may (the cau<U+017F>e per<U+017F>evering) con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t for a good while with it. As for example, there is an actual heat in Simple Water, Barly Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, diver<U+017F>e Juleps and the like being made hot, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the <U+017F>ame time they are potentially cold. So that to be actually hot, and potentially hot differ not in the Degree, but in the Species, neither are they <U+017F>o directly contrary to one another, that one
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169706:24"/>
mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ently expel the other out of a <U+017F>ubject.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Secondly, The influent hot di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per doth not <U+017F>o much correct the inherent cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper, as by accident it augmenteth it, namely by a wa<U+017F>t and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation of the Natural Spirits, wherein chiefly the natural and potential heat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides: Ju<U+017F>t after the <U+017F>ame manner as the actual heat introduced by the fire dimini<U+017F>heth the poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial heat of the Wine. Whereupon any kind of Feaver <U+017F>upervening upon this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, u<U+017F>ually brings more damage than advantage to the <U+017F>ick.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We affirm, a moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper to be lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged together in the parts fir<U+017F>t affected; this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t from the laxity and <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>aid parts: and this <U+017F>ign likewi<U+017F>e doth more <U+017F>trongly confirm the <U+017F>ame thing, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>aid parts are extenuated, <U+017F>o that unle<U+017F>s there were a redundancy of moi<U+017F>ture in them, a certain rigidity and roughne<U+017F>s would a<U+017F><U+017F>ault the touch; again, a cold di<U+017F>temper doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely continue long without a moi<U+017F>t: and la<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, things helpful and hurtful atte<U+017F>t this truth, for drying things are helpful, and moi<U+017F>tning things are hurtful.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we affirm, That in the parts fir<U+017F>t affected there is a penury of natural <U+017F>pirits. This is proved by the very <U+017F>ame arguments which we produced to evince it to be a cold di<U+017F>temper.</p>
            <p>For fir<U+017F>t the unequal and imminute nutrition of the parts fir<U+017F>t affected doth not only argue a coldne<U+017F>s of temper, but withal, a want of natural <U+017F>pirits, for otherwi<U+017F>e this defect of nutrition might be ea<U+017F>ily corrected. For the cau<U+017F>e of that coldne<U+017F>s where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the defect of the <U+017F>pirit is conjoyned, or <U+017F>ome peccaut humor is not impacted, is ea<U+017F>ily ca<U+017F>hired,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169706:25"/>
and <U+017F>ooner then is wont in this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, as may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> <U+017F>een in the parts grown extream cold in the winte <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on; for example <U+017F>ake, in the handling of <U+017F>now; the parts <U+017F>o extreamly cooled provided that they be rightly handled, wil return to their pri<U+017F>tine tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g>t in few hours: but wher there is a di<U+017F>temper with the matter of it, as a ca<U+017F>e conjoynd, or where ther is a defect of the inherent <U+017F>pirits, <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>temper indeed is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon nor <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily removed. But in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent affect we cannot affirm that a conjoyned or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted matter of any note is (at the lea<U+017F>t alwi<U+017F>e) cau<U+017F>ed in the parts fir<U+017F>t affected, becau<U+017F>e they are ob<U+017F>erved to be more withered, feeble, and extreamly exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, and <U+017F>eeing this affect is very different from <hi>Cachexia</hi> and the Virgins di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; in the which for the mo<U+017F>t part, it is not the want of Spirits, but the conjoyned matter that cheri<U+017F>heth the cold di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: wherefore we may rightly infer that the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacity of this evil doth chiefly depend upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the natural Spirits. Secondly, The <U+017F>ame is proved after the <U+017F>ame manner by the <U+017F>econd argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before alleadged for the cold di<U+017F>temper, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <U+017F>loth and aver<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s to excerci<U+017F>e. For acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity hath not only a dependance upon the temper, but chiefly upon the fulne<U+017F>s of the Spirits: as may be <U+017F>een in <U+017F>trong and heathful men, who in winter time, and harde<U+017F>t fro<U+017F>t, are more prompt and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to violent exerci<U+017F>es, then in <U+017F>ummer, when the inherent Spirits are wont to be <U+017F>omwhat di<U+017F><U+017F>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Thirdly, Feavers, and long extenuating di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, as they often introduce a cold di<U+017F>temper, <U+017F>o they evidently dimini<U+017F>h and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate the inherent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. To the<U+017F>e we ad that argument which is dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the con<U+017F>titution of the Parents<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that are more <U+017F>trong and lu<U+017F>ty (experience

witne<U+017F><U+017F>eth it) and accu<U+017F>tomed to labour, <U+017F>eldom bring forth children obnoxious to this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: on the contrary, <U+017F>uch as are weak, <U+017F>ickly, idle, tender, delicate, very prone to immoderate, premature, or decriped Venery, <U+017F>uch as are troubled with a <hi>Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhea,</hi> &amp;c. for the mo<U+017F>t part beget children <U+017F>ubject to this affect: Namely, becau<U+017F>e the Seminary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are furni<U+017F>hed only with a deficiency of Spirits. We <U+017F>hould now proceed to the fourth a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion, but mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t remove a <hi>remora</hi> that cometh in the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> For <U+017F>ome may object. <hi>That the natural cold di<U+017F>temper is <U+017F>ubordinated to the want of Spirits, and not contradi<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed to it, as is here <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed. For the paucity of the Spirits <U+017F>eemeth to be the very cau<U+017F>e of the cold di<U+017F>temper, and the natural heat be it more inten<U+017F>e or more remi<U+017F>s, <U+017F>eemeth re<U+017F>pectively to follow the proportion of the natural Spirits, as being radicated in them as their fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We an<U+017F>wer.</hi> Fir<U+017F>t, That the inherent heat is indeed fir<U+017F>t grounded and <U+017F>ubjected in the inherent Spirits. Moreover as the inward heat is divided into two par s, namely, the natural, and the acquired heat; <U+017F>o the inward Spirit mu<U+017F>t be al<U+017F>o conceived to be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, the primigenial or <U+017F>eminal derived from the Parents in the <U+017F>eed, and the acquired Spirit contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from a perfect a<U+017F><U+017F>imilation of the aliment, the former Spirit is the ba<U+017F>is of the engrafted natural heat, the latter of the inward acquired heat; we mean, not that the<U+017F>e heats and Spirits are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves di<U+017F>tinct in the <U+017F>pecies<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but only in their origin and degree of perfection, which is <U+017F>ufficient to inve<U+017F>t them with a various appellation. For in nutrition the a<U+017F><U+017F>imilation of the aliment proceedeth even to a <U+017F>pecifical identity, and not an individual, although <U+017F>ometimes, al<U+017F>o it attaineth not the degree of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169706:26"/>
perfection. For which cau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>eemed <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to us to have named the implanted heat, and the implanted Spirit, without any high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er di<U+017F>tinction; and therefore we grant that the implanted heat is fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubjected and rooted in the Spirits, and that it is nothing el<U+017F>e then a certain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the <U+017F>aid Spirits, whereby they being irradiated by the vital heat do delight to indeavor to diffu<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves and to enlarge their dominions, by attracting, retaining, a<U+017F><U+017F>imilating the aliments like unto them<U+017F>elves by <U+017F>evering the excrements, and la<U+017F>tly, by di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing the things acquired in due places: we <U+017F>ay, likewi<U+017F>e that this endeavor (wherin we place the e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of heat) by rea<U+017F>on that it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ive doth <U+017F>omwhat di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate and wa<U+017F>t the implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits, which becau<U+017F>e of this effect are vulgarly called by the name of radical moi<U+017F>ture continually devoured and con<U+017F>umed by the heat. Thus far we grant the argument: But in the <U+017F>econd place we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the implanted heat doth differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g> the hot implanted temperament; for the implanted heat is only a part of the hot <hi>implanted temperament,</hi> for not only a Spirit, but <U+017F>ulphur al<U+017F>o, and <U+017F>alt, or perhaps choler, contribute their heat to the con<U+017F>titution of the whole hot implanted temperament, wherof the implanted heat is only a part. Wherefore it is fa<U+017F>ly <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ted in the propounded argument, that a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirits is the <U+017F>ole cau<U+017F>e of a hot di<U+017F>temper, and a paucity of a cold di<U+017F>temper: for a pound of the fle<U+017F>h of an infant containeth more implanted Spirits then a pound of a yongmans fle<U+017F>h: yet it is mo<U+017F>t e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the temperament of a yong man is far more hot then that of an infant: a hot temperament cannot therefore depend upon the <U+017F>ole plenty of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> nor a cold temperament upon a want of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169706:26"/>
Spirits. Moreover in many maladies a hot di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with a paucity of Spirits; as in a <hi>Hectick</hi> of the third degree; in like manner of a cold di<U+017F>temper with a competent plenty of Spirits, as in the Green <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>We <U+017F>ay thirdly, That a plenty or paucity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is not perpetually a <U+017F>ufficient cau<U+017F>e to determine the temperament either hot or cold; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, neither doth a hot, nor a cold temperament certainly and nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily demon<U+017F>trate a plenty or paucity of Spirits, as is manife<U+017F>t from the in<U+017F>tance given. So that the temperament is no <U+017F>ure <U+017F>ign of the quantity of the Spirits, nor the quantity of the Spirits a <U+017F>ure <U+017F>ign of the temperament; and therfore purpo<U+017F>eth not without ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e, the<U+017F>e things come to be con<U+017F>idered and examined as contradi<U+017F>tinct, if we wil procure a certain and inconfu<U+017F>ed knowledge of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly we an<U+017F>wer, That although it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the implanted heat is <U+017F>ubjected in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted <hi>Spirits,</hi> yet notwith<U+017F>tanding that heat is not intended nor remitted according to the <U+017F>ole plenty, or paucity of <hi>Spirits:</hi> for the <hi>Spirits</hi> how<U+017F>oever <U+017F>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently copious, yet if they be too much fixed, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and as it were frozen; they exhibit not any implanted heat worthy of con<U+017F>ideration. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the white of an egge <U+017F>welleth with copious <hi>Spirits,</hi> yet are they <U+017F>o benummed, and the inward heat is thereupon <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall, that it obtaineth not the formation of a chicken, unle<U+017F>s it be fir<U+017F>t excited by incubation, or <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch other heat; therefore we may lawfully conclude, that a con<U+017F>ideration from the want of <hi>Spirits</hi> is <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>tinct from the con<U+017F>ideration of a cold implanted temperament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the objected argument doth <U+017F>eem to in<U+017F>inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

            <p>That be<U+017F>ide the di<U+017F>temper and want of <hi>Spirits</hi> a certain benumdne<U+017F>s of them, mu<U+017F>t be added as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinct part al<U+017F>o of the e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have already propounded the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, it remaineth now that we enquire after the fir<U+017F>t Subject in which that E<U+017F><U+017F>ence is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.</p>
            <p>The heart and the brain do here <U+017F>eem rightly to be excluded, for the rea<U+017F>ons before alleadged, the repetition whereof for brevity <U+017F>ake we <U+017F>hal omit.</p>
            <p>The liver and the Lungs are not as yet exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of this fault, we wil therfore examine the<U+017F>e bowels apart, and fir<U+017F>t we demand,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Liver be the <U+017F>ubject of the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principal Argument is for the Affirmative, becau<U+017F>e this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e may <U+017F>eem to proceed from a vicious <U+017F>anguification, the Shop and Work-hou<U+017F>e whereof (at lea<U+017F>t in probability) the Liver is <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed to be, but that a viciated <U+017F>anguification is the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169706:30"/>
fir<U+017F>t origine of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e <U+017F>eems to be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t by many <U+017F>igns. Fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e for the mo<U+017F>t part followeth after many other great di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, either acute or chronical, which in great mea<U+017F>ure have beforehand weakned the <U+017F>anguifical vertue of the Liver. Secondly, Becau<U+017F>e this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e doth not only depend upon outward, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cau<U+017F>es, namely the vicious humors. And <U+017F>eing the vicious humors are generated in and with the mas of blood in the liver, the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this affect <U+017F>eemeth to be referred hither. Thirdly, The Liver is perpetually ob<U+017F>erved to be bigger than ordinary in this affect; which manife<U+017F>tly witne<U+017F><U+017F>eth the Liver to be affected. Fourthly, tho<U+017F>e internal Medicines which have a faculty to putrifie the blood are requi<U+017F>ite to the cure of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and being exhibited are found to be very profitable. 5. The mi<U+017F><U+017F>ian of blood from the veins of the ears (which is not the meane<U+017F>t help to vanqui<U+017F>h this affect) doth more than <U+017F>ufficiently argue <U+017F>ome fault to be in the blood, which <U+017F>eemeth to be a<U+017F>cribed to the con<U+017F>titution of the Liver, in as much as it doth <U+017F>anguificate. The<U+017F>e Arguments have <U+017F>o far prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon <U+017F>ome very famous Phy<U+017F>itians, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they have attributed the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e to the Liver alone.</p>
            <p>But we conceive that the<U+017F>e things may be <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently an<U+017F>wered, if we <U+017F>hall fir<U+017F>t grant what can be further or what hath already been rightly <U+017F>aid concerning this matter, and then di<U+017F><U+017F>olve tho<U+017F>e things which are inferred by bad and invalid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, Therefore we grant that the mas of blood is viciated in this affect, and that from thence is conveied a continual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

We grant al<U+017F>o for the pre<U+017F>ent that the Liver is the Officin of <U+017F>anguification: but we deny that every vicio<U+017F>ity of the blood doth depend upon the viciated <U+017F>anguification con<U+017F>titution of the Liver. For fir<U+017F>t, the blood may be corrupted by unwhol<U+017F>om ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Liver in the mean time remaining <U+017F>ound, in like manner if the fir<U+017F>t concoction in the ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle by any cau<U+017F>e what<U+017F>oever be rendred imperfect; yet it cannot be fully corrected by the <U+017F>econd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction in the Liver be that bowel never <U+017F>o <U+017F>ound. Be<U+017F>ides, although the generation of vicious blood <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>olely a<U+017F>cribed to the Liver, yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts <U+017F>hould nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily concur to the con<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that which is generated, as the Kidneyes, the Spleen, the Pancreas, the Womb &amp;c. yea, and it <U+017F>eemeth undeniable, that all the parts which the blood wa<U+017F>heth in his circulation, do variou<U+017F>ly alter it, whil<U+017F>t according to the capacity of the <U+017F>ubject they imprint their qualities in it: for they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents, and act by nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity and continually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <U+017F>u<U+017F>pention of their actions or intervenient pau<U+017F>es, unle<U+017F>s they be e<U+017F>trained by <U+017F>ome predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant power: therfore if the<U+017F>e be il affected, they give a greater or a le<U+017F>s tincture of pollution, to the blood which pa<U+017F><U+017F>es through them, as may be <U+017F>een in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion gotten by an external contact communicated to the inward parts. Moreover, <U+017F>ometimes a great pollution from the other di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed parts is in<U+017F>inuated into the blood, the liver in the interim being <U+017F>afe, as hath been <U+017F>ometimes ob<U+017F>erved in opened bodies, that have peri<U+017F>hed by a Drop<U+017F>ie, in whom the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was found to be <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>ound and whol. Moreover, We grant that the faults of the Blood do frequently derive their beginning from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravedne<U+017F>s of their <U+017F>anguifical con<U+017F>titution of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169706:31"/>
Liver, and that that depraved<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> con<U+017F>titution is an affect of the Liver. But we deny this to be the <U+017F>ame Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e whereof we now treat, becau<U+017F>e it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from it in the whol Species. For that <U+017F>ame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved con<U+017F>titution of the Liver is alike common to men of full age, to Boys, and Children; but this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is <U+017F>olely apropriated to boys and infants. Again, We grant that a vicious con<U+017F>titution of the Liver may by generating a corrupt blood be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cau<U+017F>e, and foment the augmentation of this affect: but we deny that to be the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elf, whereof we now <U+017F>peak, or any part of the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence thereof. For it is one thing to produce a common cau<U+017F>e of a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, and another thing to be of the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. We deny al<U+017F>o that to be the continent cau<U+017F>e of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, or to be a <U+017F>ufficient cau<U+017F>e of it <U+017F>elf alone, or to be alwaies a cau<U+017F>e. For the vicious con<U+017F>titution of the Liver, of what kind <U+017F>oever you will <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it, doth not produce this affect in tho<U+017F>e that are come to ripenes of yeers, nor perhaps always in yong boys: and this our an<U+017F>wer in general to the argument: we proceed now in a like method to the confirmation of it.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, Therefore we grant that this affect doth often follow other di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es be they either acute or chronical, but not <U+017F>o much becau<U+017F>e they had hurt the <U+017F>anguiffical con<U+017F>titution of the Liver, as becau<U+017F>e they had left the outward parts cold and benummed the ingrafted Spirits exhau<U+017F>ted. Although we may ea<U+017F>ily admit the viciated liver to be able to foment the evil by rea<U+017F>on of the depraved <U+017F>anguification.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We grant that this affect doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon outward cau<U+017F>es, but al<U+017F>o upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, namely the faults of the blood it <U+017F>elf; but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169706:31"/>
that all the<U+017F>e faults have their beginning from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that we flatly deny for the Rea<U+017F>ons before allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We grant that the mole or <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Liver is augmented in this affect, but we deny that to be the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, for the rea<U+017F>ons above rehear<U+017F>ed, where we reject the organical vices from the primary e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this evil. Yet we admit this and the like di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es in a <U+017F>econdary e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this affect, as we <U+017F>hal <U+017F>ee hereafter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We grant that internal Medicines can both alter and purify the blood, but in the pre<U+017F>ent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they conduce to the cure, in this regard, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becau<U+017F>e they facilitate the di<U+017F>tribution of the blood to the outward members, attenuating the thicker and cutting the vi<U+017F>cous parts thereof, and becau<U+017F>e they al<U+017F>o do impregnate the blood, with a copious and benign Spirit, whereupon it happens, that the implanted Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the parts before langui<U+017F>hing, are cheri<U+017F>hed, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and excited. In the mean time we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that general benefit which accrew to the whole body, by the purging of the blood, by <U+017F>iedge, vomit, urine, or any other ways of evacuation. Only this is it which we affirm, that the more <U+017F>pecifical part of the cure is wrought by way of alteration with the medicines afore<U+017F>aid, as we have intimated already.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, and la<U+017F>tly, We grant that the opening the veins in the ears doth <U+017F>omewhat attenuate the blood, and conduce to the renovation of it, as al<U+017F>o to the di<U+017F>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to the external parts, and the withdrawing of it from the internal parts oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with too much plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in that re<U+017F>pect very much to advance the cure<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> yet we deny that it can from thence be rightly inferred that the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is radicated in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169706:32"/>
Liver. And thus we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e we have <U+017F>atisfied the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons brought for the confirmation of this opinion. We wil now produce <U+017F>ome arguments that <U+017F>eem to per<U+017F>wade the contrary.</p>
            <p>The fir<U+017F>t is this, The fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e doth Specificate the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. But the vitiated <U+017F>anguifical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution (however it be conceived) doth not <U+017F>pecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. For <U+017F>eing that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to infants only and children; it behoveth them who adhere to the contrary opinion to de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>ome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way of the depraved <U+017F>anguifical Con<U+017F>titution of the Liver, which may be proper to the tender age alone, but no depravation of the <U+017F>anguifical Con<U+017F>titution of the Liver can be imagined, which is not al<U+017F>o common to tho<U+017F>e of ripe years. If therefore the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in that, this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e would at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ometimes be ob<U+017F>erved in tho<U+017F>e of ripe years, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding hath never been hitherto ob<U+017F>erved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <U+017F>ubject of the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is <U+017F>o long affected with that E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, as the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth. For neither can the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> Exi<U+017F>t without its E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, neither can that E<U+017F><U+017F>ence wander from one part to another: If therefore the Liver be the <U+017F>ubject of the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, then <U+017F>hould it be affected thorowout the whole progre<U+017F>s of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele<U+017F>s doth not <U+017F>eem credible, <U+017F>eeing that the Livers of tho<U+017F>e who have died of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and have been di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ected, have excepting the augmented bulk thereof, been <U+017F>een inculpable in re<U+017F>pect of the other conditions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the Liver be the <U+017F>ubject of the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily it is, that upon the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increa<U+017F>e of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hould be more grievou<U+017F>ly and evidently afflicted, and before death certainly it <U+017F>hould be marked by <U+017F>ome manife<U+017F>t <U+017F>igns. For <U+017F>eeing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169706:32"/>
that every Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is contrary to the nature of that part it be<U+017F>iegeth, and doth dayly more and more damnify and empair it: And although the beginnings of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are many times ob<U+017F>cure, yet in proce<U+017F>s of time (e<U+017F>pecially if they continue till the la<U+017F>t day of life) they imprint mo<U+017F>t evident marks in the parts primarily affected; <U+017F>o that it can <U+017F>carce be avoyded, but that upon the opening of the body they will be apparent to the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though al<U+017F>o when an enquiry is appointed into <U+017F>ome Chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, by di<U+017F><U+017F>ection of the body that peri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, the finding of it out be grown difficult by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of <U+017F>ome other intervenient Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, or otherwi<U+017F>e complicated: Yet the part fir<U+017F>t affected is ever ob<U+017F>erved to be grievou<U+017F>ly and manife<U+017F>tly hurt. Seing therefore in tho<U+017F>e whom this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> hath de<U+017F>troyed, the Liver is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes <U+017F>ound, excepting the augmented bulk, or at lea<U+017F>t not con<U+017F>iderably hurt, it will be to infer, that that bowel is not the <U+017F>ubject of the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the liver were the <U+017F>ubject of the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, it <U+017F>hould labor under a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper, and al<U+017F>o under a penury and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medne<U+017F>s of <U+017F>pirits, as is <U+017F>ufficiently manife<U+017F>t from what hath already been <U+017F>poken. But in this pre<U+017F>ent affect the liver doth not always labor under a cold di<U+017F>temper, nor with a penury and <U+017F>tupefaction of <U+017F>pirits. For in this affect the vital blood being <U+017F>paringly di<U+017F>tributed to the outward members, it mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>uperabundantly poured upon the bowels, e<U+017F>pecially the brain and the liver; and <U+017F>eeing this blood, which is circulated thorow the bowels <U+017F>o neer the heart, is made very hot and ful of <U+017F>pirit: as even now i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the fountain of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <U+017F>pirits, it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible that it <U+017F>hould permit a cold
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169706:33"/>
di<U+017F>temper, or any defect of <U+017F>pirits to be in tho<U+017F>e parts, which it watereth with <U+017F>o copious an afflux.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, In this affect we often behold the face to be wel coloured, &amp; the cheeks ruddy, which can <U+017F>carce happen in a cold di<U+017F>temper of the liver if it be of any continuance.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, From a bad habit of breeding blood in the liver; a <U+017F>ufficient rea<U+017F>on cannot be rendred of the <U+017F>ymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms proper to this affect, a <hi>Cacotrophy</hi> indeed, or a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nouri<U+017F>hment, and an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> or a defective nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment: nay many times and peradventure not unju<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a<U+017F>cribed to the fault of the liver: but an <hi>Alogotro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> or a di<U+017F>proportional nouri<U+017F>hment cannot immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be referred to that bowel, For the liver maketh the blood equally and without difference, for al the parts; neither is it liberal to our part in the di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation of it, and re<U+017F>erved to another. Moreover the debility of all the mu<U+017F>cles, the di<U+017F>like of exerci<U+017F>e, the affectation of re<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eemeth to have no corre<U+017F>pondence with the Liver, wherefore neither do we acknowledge the Liver to be the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>eat of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, This di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e in <U+017F>trong children is cured <U+017F>ometimes, only by exerci<U+017F>e, play, <U+017F>tirring, and rubbing of the body; by which means the heat is <U+017F>ummoned to the outward parts, new <U+017F>pirits are rai<U+017F>ed up, the <U+017F>tupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of them is cha<U+017F>ed away, and the aliment is with a more plentiful benignity drawn to the outward mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which benefits without doubt are more properly accommodated to the outward parts then to the Liver.</p>
            <p>And this que<U+017F>tion being thus <U+017F>olved, we proceed to the other; namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Lungs be the <U+017F>ubject of the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <U+017F>ymptoms which <U+017F>eem to per<U+017F>wade the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, are the frequent narrowne<U+017F>s of the brea<U+017F>t, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169706:33"/>
of breathing, an <hi>a<U+017F>tma,</hi> a cough, the inflamation of the Lungs, the hard <U+017F>wellings of the Lungs, the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tume in the Lungs and the Pti<U+017F>ick. Fir<U+017F>t, The nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowne<U+017F>s of the brea<U+017F>t doth not pre<U+017F>ently ari<U+017F>e from the very beginning of the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, &amp; therfore cannot be atte<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, in like manner the difficulty of breathing &amp; the <hi>a<U+017F>tma</hi> do not perpetually accompany this affect, and therefore an indication of the part fir<U+017F>t affected cannot be borrowed from them. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the cough is <U+017F>ometimes pre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>ometimes ab<U+017F>ent, and is often times variou<U+017F>ly intended and remitted, til the e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e per<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tate; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o happeneth from very many of the afore<U+017F>aid <U+017F>ymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. Fourthly, An inflammation of the Lungs doth not frequently mole<U+017F>t the patient, and when it invadeth him, it is an acute and not a chronicle di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e; as this, whereof we now <U+017F>peak, <U+017F>o that we cannot lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any certainty of the fir<U+017F>t affected part from a <U+017F>ymptom <U+017F>o unu<U+017F>ual and <U+017F>o Fugitive. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Hard <U+017F>wellings of the Lungs, little <U+017F>wellings, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tumes; yea, and bunches may precede, a<U+017F><U+017F>ociate, and follow after this affect, but the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are altogether of a different kind from that we now <U+017F>peak of; yea, and are common as well to men of ripe years as to children, and infants: moreover the <hi>Pty<U+017F>ick</hi> doth not u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perveen unle<U+017F>s after a long continuance of this affect, as being far from the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; and that it may manife<U+017F>tly appear to be very remote from the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F>teem of it, <U+017F>o that can confer little or nothing to the finding out of the part affected. Moreover, tho<U+017F>e in<U+017F>eparable and vulgar <U+017F>ymptoms of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, as the impotency of the external parts to motion, and the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of nutrition, can by no rea<U+017F>on be deduced from the affected Lungs: and therefore we cannot admit this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169706:34"/>
Bowel for the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>eat of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. And thus at length we de<U+017F>cend to point out the parts fir<U+017F>t affected.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>pecial marrow i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out of the skull doth <U+017F>eem to de<U+017F>erve the fir<U+017F>t place: The <U+017F>econd, all the Nerves produced by it; the third all the membranous and fibrous parts unto which tho<U+017F>e Nerves are carried along. And in the<U+017F>e parts we affirm the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> to be rooted, neither do we think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to joyn other parts with the<U+017F>e. For the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, and <hi>Atony</hi> of the whol Spine without the Skul, of all the Nerves ari<U+017F>ing from thence, of all the Fibers of the Univer<U+017F>al Body, and by that means an inability to motion, a <U+017F>lothfulne<U+017F>s and affectation of re<U+017F>t, which bewray them<U+017F>elves from the very beginning of this affect, do abundantly evince the<U+017F>e parts to be affected with coldne<U+017F>s, defect and benummedne<U+017F>s of Spirits, and from hence it comes to pa<U+017F>s that they are extenuated and afflicted with an incompetency of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment. For they do <U+017F>omewhat communicate their benummedne<U+017F>s to the tops of the Arteries, whereupon the Flux of blood that is de<U+017F>tributed unto them, <U+017F>uffers diminution; and becau<U+017F>e they are cold and labor under a defect of Spirits, they imperfectly concoct the affu<U+017F>ed blood, <U+017F>o that there is a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that they mu<U+017F>t be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly nouri<U+017F>hed and le<U+017F>s than the other parts, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence be extenuated. Therefore we ju<U+017F>tly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervedly a<U+017F>cribe the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> to tho<U+017F>e parts alone.</p>
            <p>Yet it may be here doubted whether the bones may not al<U+017F>o be numbred among the parts fir<U+017F>t affected, <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that certain tumors of the bones may be ob<U+017F>erved pre<U+017F>ently after the fir<U+017F>t inva<U+017F>ion of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in divers places, but e<U+017F>pecially in the appendancies of the Bones to the Wre<U+017F>ts and tops of the Ribs, where they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169706:34"/>
with the grizles of the Stern?</p>
            <p>We an<U+017F>wer, That indeed it cannot be denied, but that the <U+017F>aid tumors of the bones, both in re<U+017F>pect of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ed greatne<U+017F>s, and al<U+017F>o by rea<U+017F>on of the viciated fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure are really and truly Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and therefore we grant that the bones mu<U+017F>t be referred to the primary or <U+017F>econdary e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>: but that they do not pertain to the primary e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e is manife<U+017F>t from hence, Becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>aid tumors of the bones de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the preexi<U+017F>tence of it. For they <U+017F>pring from the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual nouri<U+017F>hment of the parts which is a Symptom of the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. But here the inequality of the nouri<U+017F>hment can depend upon the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, <U+017F>hall more fully be declared in its due place; namely, where the rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>econdary e<U+017F><U+017F>ence is to be rendred. We will only here <U+017F>hew that tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the bones are rightly deduced from the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate nouri<U+017F>hment, to wit when in re<U+017F>pect of the re<U+017F>t it is too much augmented in the <U+017F>welling parts. That is proved by this argument, Becau<U+017F>e the protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant part of the bones are altogether of the <U+017F>ame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with the other parts of the bones; whereupon it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that they come out by the <U+017F>ame way of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by which the re<U+017F>t are augmented and encrea<U+017F>. Therefore <U+017F>eeing that the other bones are augmented by nutrition, that is, by the intro<U+017F>umed aliment, and the a<U+017F><U+017F>imilation of it, certainly we mu<U+017F>t judg that the<U+017F>e bones al<U+017F>o acquire their augmentation by the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on (although without rea<U+017F>on, mea<U+017F>ure and proportion) You will <U+017F>ay, That tumors are u<U+017F>ually generated not of an alimentory or good, but a corrupt and vicious juyce. True it is indeed that this is for the mo<U+017F>t part true, but as true it is that it is only for the mo<U+017F>t part true. For
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169706:35"/>
<U+017F>ome tumors <U+017F>well from a legitimate and alimentary juyce, as caruncles or little pieces of fle<U+017F>h, knobbed <U+017F>wellings, and perhaps <U+017F>ome hard bunches, but even the<U+017F>e <U+017F>wellings do al<U+017F>o differ much from the pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>tanding out of the bones. For tho<U+017F>e tumors which we u<U+017F>e to call excre<U+017F>cences, have <U+017F>omewhat in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the habit of the part and in the whol kind be<U+017F>ide nature: but the<U+017F>e tumors do not grow without the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the part, neither do they include or contain any other preternatural thing be<U+017F>ide the <U+017F>ole magnitude di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionately encrea<U+017F>ed, and by that means the vicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted figure of the parts. For otherwi<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e <U+017F>wellings <U+017F>hould not be of the <U+017F>ame Species with the re<U+017F>t of the Bone, to which they are continued, but that is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the experience of the <U+017F>ences.</p>
            <p>If therefore it be granted that <U+017F>ome tumors (even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong tho<U+017F>e which are altogether preternatural and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t without the habit of their body) are generated of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limentary juyces, certainly much le<U+017F>s hard is it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tood that the<U+017F>e <U+017F>wellings of the bones are generated and formed of the legitimate matter of the bones, by the inherent nutritive faculty. And this is clearly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by this, becau<U+017F>e the bones according to their <U+017F>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary nature are by no means legitimately produced by an illegitimate matter, that is, an indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed and di<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable matter to the other <U+017F>imilary bones. <hi>Ex quolibet ligno non fit Mercurius,</hi> Every natural agent di<U+017F>po<U+017F>eth the matter before it can introduce the form. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary al<U+017F>o that the matter <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed be legitimate. Now the matter of the <U+017F>welling bones is manife<U+017F>tly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed; for otherwi<U+017F>e it could not actually receive the <U+017F>pecifical form of a bone. Moreover that the<U+017F>e tumors of the bones are generated by the nutritive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is likewi<U+017F>e evident, becau<U+017F> in all our body there is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169706:35"/>
not any other o<U+017F><U+017F>ifical vertue be<U+017F>ides that nutritive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty inherent in the bones them<U+017F>elves, becau<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o the<U+017F>e tumors are generated and augmented by the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umed aliment, and a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated by the bones them<U+017F>elvs: although perhaps in re<U+017F>pect of the whole Bone this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the aliment may be unequal, and a <U+017F>ufficient cau<U+017F>e of error in the nutritive faculty, whereby one part of tho<U+017F>e Bones may be too <U+017F>paringly nouri<U+017F>hed, and another part too plentifully even to a tumor.</p>

parts of this Con<U+017F>titution, to wit, the common quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Organization, and the continuity do yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be examined.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Common Qualities</hi> we under<U+017F>tand in a manner the <U+017F>ame which <U+017F>ome others have called the <hi>Modos Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> and others, <hi>Qualitates Secundas.</hi> Now we cal them <hi>Common,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they are not re<U+017F>trained to any one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Form; but in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort may expiate and range thorow all the Bodies, and for the mo<U+017F>t part affect them more or le<U+017F>s.

Fir<U+017F>t, Therefore we meet with an evident loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the <hi>Tone</hi> in this affect: But this loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s differeth both from the infirm coherence, and likewi<U+017F>e from the <hi>Paralytical</hi> re<U+017F>olution of the Parts: for the infirm co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence or weakned <U+017F>tifne<U+017F>s of the part is ea<U+017F>ily made an occa<U+017F>ion of the loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es the Part can <U+017F>carce be <U+017F>tretched forth; but a part may at the <U+017F>ame time be both loo<U+017F>e, and likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>tiff, as may be <U+017F>een in the <U+017F>trings of In<U+017F>truments, which if you wind down the pins, they become loo<U+017F>e, although in the mean time they forgo not the tenacity of their <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance. And in di<U+017F><U+017F>ected bodies we have frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved the loo<U+017F>e parts them<U+017F>elves to be <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>tiff; yea, and that <U+017F>ometimes in this affect. Wherefore this loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s is a di<U+017F>tinct quality from the vitiated <U+017F>tifne<U+017F>s of a Part. Neither doth it le<U+017F>s differ from that re<U+017F>olution of the Parts which happeneth in the <hi>Paralytical</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. For the dead Pal<U+017F>y fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the depraved Animal Con<U+017F>titution: But this loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s is rooted in the Natural Con<U+017F>titution. For here is no Pal<U+017F>y pre<U+017F>ent either in re<U+017F>pect of motion, or in re<U+017F>pect of the <U+017F>ence of the Parts: Neither is the Brayn in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily affected, as we have already demon<U+017F>trated. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that there is <U+017F>uch an exceeding loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the Parts fir<U+017F>t affected, in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is a thing <U+017F>o con<U+017F>picuous, that we judg it a <U+017F>uperfluous employment to offer proof thereof. For it is obvious to the very <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have li<U+017F>ted it among the <U+017F>igns of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For whether it be a Part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence or not a Part, if it be manife<U+017F>tly <U+017F>ubjected to the Sen<U+017F>es, it acquireth the propriety of a <U+017F>ign in re<U+017F>pect of the other Parts of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, which are removed from the Sen<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> there is not only a loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s but likewi<U+017F>e a witheredne<U+017F>s, and feeblene<U+017F>s. Now this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169706:37"/>
quality comprehendeth <U+017F>omwhat more then the meer and <U+017F>imple loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s; for it denoteth withal a certain emptine<U+017F>s of the parts, wherby they <U+017F>ink down of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves. Now <U+017F>uch an emptine<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>uch a falling down of the Parts fir<U+017F>t affected in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> are <U+017F>o obvious to the Sen<U+017F>es, that there is no need of further proof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A a <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s al<U+017F>o may be named in the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts fir<U+017F>t affected in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For <U+017F>ometimes it <U+017F>o falleth out that there is no coincidence between the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s and the afore<U+017F>aid qualities; but that it inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or excludeth <U+017F>ome other thing, as in a <U+017F>uppurated Tumor there is <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, but without any laxity of the Tone, any emptine<U+017F>s or <U+017F>ub<U+017F>idence. For in this pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed ca<U+017F>e the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s chiefly dependeth upon the manner of Termination, and the tenacity of the Part being vitiated. But in this affect there is for the mo<U+017F>t part a coincidence with the laxity and flaccidity before mentioned: So that it is needle<U+017F>s to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h it more accurately then by the name only.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There happeneth al<U+017F>o another fault in the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts fir<U+017F>t affected in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and this is an extream inward <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s. Some perhaps may wonder what the meaning of the<U+017F>e words may be, <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal lubricity.</hi> We confe<U+017F>s indeed that for want of words we have been con<U+017F>trayned to joyn this appellation. For when in nature <U+017F>uch a quality as hath a true exi<U+017F>tence hath by the over<U+017F>ight of Philo<U+017F>ophers, and al<U+017F>o the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Grammarians wanted a name, we have taken <U+017F>o much liberty to our <U+017F>elvs, as in re<U+017F>pect of the great vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which it hath with the <U+017F>uperficial lubricity of the body to give it the <U+017F>ame Name, with the di<U+017F>tinctive <hi>Epethite</hi> of Internal. In natural bodies therfore we acknowledg a twofold lubricity; one External and Superficial which indeed con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the <U+017F>moothne<U+017F>s and equality of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169706:37"/>
Parts of the Superficies, by rea<U+017F>on whereof the Subject of it doth ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>lide by other bodies which it lighteth upon without much attrition and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this lubricity, is the Superficial roughne<U+017F>s: but the<U+017F>e two qualities have no reference to this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e they are Organical, neither do they any way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts. That other lubricity whereof we began to make mention, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, profound and <U+017F>imilary <U+017F>moothne<U+017F>s, and equality of the body. By rea<U+017F>on wherof, the whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of its Subject doth ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>lide by the other intro<U+017F>ubient bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies without much attrition and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. And to this lubricity al<U+017F>o there is an Internal roughne<U+017F>s. Now that there is <U+017F>uch an internal <U+017F>imilary <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>uch a roughne<U+017F>s al<U+017F>o oppo<U+017F>ite unto it may be <U+017F>hewed almo<U+017F>t by innumerable in<U+017F>tances. For almo<U+017F>t all mucilaginous <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances are <U+017F>lippery, and that not only in re<U+017F>pect of the outward Superficies, but al<U+017F>o inwardly, and in re<U+017F>pect of the univer<U+017F>al Sub<U+017F>tance, and every particle thereof; <U+017F>o that, according to the definition of a <U+017F>imilary body, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particle, by rea<U+017F>on of this quality is made like unto the whol, and therfore this quality is internal, and <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milary, and diffu<U+017F>ed through the whol internal <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Subject. In like manner <U+017F>uch an internal roughne<U+017F>s may be ob<U+017F>erved in unripe fruits, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thorow their whole <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fle<U+017F>h. But when they have attained to a ju<U+017F>t ripene<U+017F>s then u<U+017F>ually, in the room of that roughne<U+017F>s there <U+017F>ucceedeth <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s as we have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribed. And here it mu<U+017F>t be ob<U+017F>erved, that if the<U+017F>e bodies internally <U+017F>lippery be be<U+017F>meared or daubed upon the Superficies of bodies otherwi<U+017F>e rough, they bequeath a certain degree of lubricity to them, for the time they adhere<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> in like manner being inwardly taken as the <U+017F>lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169706:38"/>
juyces, and mucilages of <hi>Althea,</hi> &amp;c. They do communicate a certain lubricity to the Internal pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the Body; yea, and not only to the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the inward cavities, but al<U+017F>o more or le<U+017F>s to the very Similary <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the parts of the Body, which al<U+017F>o the blood wa<U+017F>heth being impregnated with that <U+017F>lippery juyce.</p>
            <p>But this internal lubricity is manifold: oyly or fat, watri<U+017F>h, <U+017F>piritous, <U+017F>alti<U+017F>h, and perhaps earthy. The oyly is chiefly con<U+017F>picuous in the fat of Creatures, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <U+017F>uch as are yong, and in many expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Oyls, e<U+017F>pecially the moi<U+017F>ter and colder, and al<U+017F>o the temperate; as may be ob<U+017F>erved in the Oyls of Poppy Seeds, Pippin Seeds, the four greater Cold Seeds, Time Seed, and the Oyl of <U+017F>weet Almonds, and the like. A watri<U+017F>h lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricity is in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure found in <U+017F>imple water it <U+017F>elf, although by rea<U+017F>on of the fluidne<U+017F>s it is le<U+017F>s <U+017F>en<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; al<U+017F>o this lubricity may mo<U+017F>t evidently be taken notice of in the mucilages, &amp;c. The Spiritous perhaps doth never happen alone, but it is mo<U+017F>t frequently mixt with the wateri<U+017F>h, as in the <U+017F>perm of almo<U+017F>t all Creatures, and ripe fruits. The Salti<U+017F>h likewi<U+017F>e is rarely <U+017F>imple, although there is a man that contendeth it is to be found in <U+017F>alt of Tartar. But the compound <U+017F>alti<U+017F>h lubricity is frequently obvious, as in Soap and Salt of Tartar di<U+017F><U+017F>olved with wateri<U+017F>h and oyly <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Earthy (even mixt) is <U+017F>carce worthy of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation, unle<U+017F>s it be in re<U+017F>pect that it concurreth to the thickning of fluid bodies, as in white clayi<U+017F>h Mud, and Fullers Earth di<U+017F><U+017F>olved. But in this place we have regard chiefly to that lubricity which is wateri<U+017F>h, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that alone which can be guilty of the crime in this affect we now handle,</p>
            <p>And the<U+017F>e things may <U+017F>uffice in general of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169706:38"/>
or <U+017F>imilary lubricity. The next enquiring mu<U+017F>t be whether the fir<U+017F>t affected parts of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be affected beyond a due proportion with an internel or <U+017F>imilary lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricity. And at fir<U+017F>t indeed it <U+017F>eemeth very probable that there is <U+017F>uch an extream lubricity in the <U+017F>aid parts, becau<U+017F> moi<U+017F>ture doth <U+017F>uperabound in them, which ever favoreth the <U+017F>aid lubricity, be it conjoyned either with heat or cold. Every one knoweth that the Sperm of Creatures by how much it is moi<U+017F>ter than the creatures produced by it, by <U+017F>o much al<U+017F>o it is the more <U+017F>lippery: in like manner that the yong fle<U+017F>h of Creatures is more <U+017F>lippery than that of old. Seeing therefore that humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and lubricity of this kind are <U+017F>o inwardly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Seing al<U+017F>o that in the parts fir<U+017F>t affected there is manife<U+017F>tly an extream humidity, certainly it may ea<U+017F>ily be granted that a lubricity likewi<U+017F>e doth too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the <U+017F>aid parts. And to the production of this the benummedne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e parts have no <U+017F>mall <U+017F>hare. For the Spirits when they are in their exaltation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a kind of acrimony and <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s, as may be <U+017F>een by comparing Mu<U+017F>t with old Wine, or with Spirit of Wine or with <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> For the Spirits of Mu<U+017F>t may truly be <U+017F>aid to be benummed or <U+017F>tupified, if they be compared with the Spirits of old Wine; and by how much more they are <U+017F>tupified, <U+017F>o much more lubricity they likewi<U+017F>e contain, and al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o much the le<U+017F>s of <U+017F>harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s and acrimony. From whence it is manife<U+017F>t that that benummedne<U+017F>s and dulne<U+017F>s in the Spirits lodging in the fir<U+017F>t affected parts doth favor that extrem lubrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for that dulne<U+017F>s of the Spirits in the <U+017F>aid parts is almo<U+017F>t of the <U+017F>ame degree with the dulne<U+017F>s of the Spirits in Mu<U+017F>t. And becau<U+017F> the Spirits are defective in the parts fir<U+017F>t affected, it is evident that this lubricity is an over-watri<U+017F>h lubricity. Moreover, laxity, flaccidity,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169706:39"/>
and <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s do al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eem to con<U+017F>pire. For unripe fruit as they are hard, <U+017F>o till they wax ripe they grow <U+017F>ofter and <U+017F>ofter, and withal acquire an internal lubricity; in like manner the parts are loo<U+017F>ned by relaxant baths, and together they become more <U+017F>lippery; al<U+017F>o <U+017F>lippery things taken inwardly, as the mucilage of <hi>Althea,</hi> &amp;c. Do not only loo<U+017F>en the Parts, but they al<U+017F>o make the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages <U+017F>lippery, for which ca<U+017F>e in the pains of the <U+017F>tone they are drank with good juyces. Again, this lubricity of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, <U+017F>eemeth to be much confirmed by this, becau<U+017F>e in the di<U+017F><U+017F>ected Bodies a manife<U+017F>t lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricity is ob<U+017F>ervable by the touch; and if they be <U+017F>quee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed a mucilaginous kind of blood, inwardly be<U+017F>mearing them, is cru<U+017F>hed out with the fingers. We <U+017F>ay nothing of the skin, which for the mo<U+017F>t part is <U+017F>lippery in this affect, and is <U+017F>eldom felt to be rough to the touch: but it is worthy to be noted, that extream <U+017F>lippery Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines either outwardly applyed, or inwardly taken, do u<U+017F>ually more hurt then good in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. And thus we ab<U+017F>olve the former que<U+017F>tion, of the manner whereby the <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts is vitiated in this Affect. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now pre<U+017F>ents it <U+017F>elf to our con<U+017F>ideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Tone vitiated after that manner as hath been <U+017F>aid, be a Part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e here that what<U+017F>oever is found to be viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the Body, is either a morbifical cau<U+017F>e, or a Symptom, or the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> it <U+017F>elf; and therfore this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> either <U+017F>imple or compound, or any part of a compound, and that either primary or <U+017F>econdary.</p>
            <p>We <U+017F>ay fir<U+017F>t, That the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> above propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is not properly a cau<U+017F>e of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. And this <U+017F>carce need any proof. For the <U+017F>aid <hi>Tone</hi> is a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Con<U+017F>titution, rooted in the Parts them<U+017F>elves, and by that rea<U+017F>on it is mo<U+017F>t evidently di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169706:39"/>
morbifical cau<U+017F>e properly <U+017F>o called. For although, one Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may be the cau<U+017F>e of another, neverthele<U+017F>s even then it is not properly called a morbifical cau<U+017F>e, but a primary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and that other which it produceth, a a <U+017F>econdary affect. But every where there is a growing together of them both into one total Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wil be the primary Part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, and the latter the <U+017F>econdary part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We affirm, that the de<U+017F>cribed <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts is not a meer Symptom, for it is not under the things <U+017F>ecured and retained, neither can it be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under any depraved action, or any changed qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not vitiating the action. But that the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> is not comprehended under the things <U+017F>ecured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, nor under any depraved action, may by the <U+017F>ame labor be proved by this Rea<U+017F>on, becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e kind of Symptoms are not indeed Con<U+017F>titutions of the body; but the <U+017F>aid vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> without controver<U+017F>y is a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural changed con<U+017F>titution, as we have already mo<U+017F>t playnly demon<U+017F>trated. Secondly, That the <U+017F>aid <hi>Tone</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated after that manner, is not contained under any changed quality, not depraving the action, is <U+017F>o clear and evident, that it needs no proof. For laxity and flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity hurteth the motion of the Parts, and an extream lubricity is an impediment to the du quickning of the vital Spirits, as <U+017F>hal hereafter be made manife<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>It may be Objected, <hi>That <U+017F>ome bare changed qualities which are comprehended under the Genus of Symptoms, may al<U+017F>o vitiate an action: as the colour changed in the skin yeeldeth an unplea<U+017F>ant pro<U+017F>pect to the beholder, <U+017F>o that it begetteth deformity and defect of du comline<U+017F>s?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We an<U+017F>wer, That the changed colour of the Skin in as much as it vitiateth the beauty therof (which is the proper action of the Skin) doth in rigor (in a large

acception) fall under the Notion of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. But <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this action of the Skin is only <hi>Objecture</hi> and <hi>Ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> and <U+017F>eing that altered color doth hurt no Internal action of that individual: Phy<U+017F>itians, who in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, have re<U+017F>pect only to the Internal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that individual, do u<U+017F>ually exclude it from the Cla<U+017F><U+017F>is of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. Or if the vitiated color of a part do chance in <U+017F>ome place to deprave an internal action (which is known only to happen in the Tunicle of the Eye, called <hi>Corura)</hi> the be<U+017F>t Phy<U+017F>itians do ever reckon it for a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, although perhaps <U+017F>econdarily. But that we may return into the way from whence we have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle erred: <U+017F>eing that the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> may hurt, as we have <U+017F>aid, the internal actions, it doth not properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to that kind of Symptom, which is wont to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of a changed quality.</p>
            <p>Thirdly we <U+017F>ay, That this vitiated <hi>Tone,</hi> <U+017F>eing it is neither a Morbifical cau<U+017F>, nor a Symptom, and yet is <U+017F>omthing preternatural, mu<U+017F>t needs be the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> it <U+017F>elf. Moreover, the <U+017F>ame is clearly proved by the very definition of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For this vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Con<U+017F>titution, primarily or immediatly hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the internal action; therfore it is a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For to what the definition is competible, to that al<U+017F>o the thing defined is competible. That it is a preternatural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution is manife<U+017F>t by this, becau<U+017F>e it is inherent in the <U+017F>olid parts of the body: that it likewi<U+017F>e depraveth the Internal actions, is manife<U+017F>t from hence, becau<U+017F>e an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream laxity, lubricity, and flaccidity of the parts being granted, pre<U+017F>ently the agility is weakned, no other cau<U+017F>e approaching, and a certain <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s deadeth the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation of the vital Spirits. In agility, the matter is plain, <U+017F>eing that firm and <U+017F>tretched bodies, other things being an<U+017F>werable are more active, and <U+017F>o on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169706:40"/>
that the <U+017F>ame thing al<U+017F>o happeneth in the dulne<U+017F>s of the irritation <U+017F>hal be <U+017F>hewed in its place, for the pre<U+017F>ent we labor to prove no other thing then that the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> in this affect is a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>We <U+017F>ay fourthly, That this vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F> is not any <U+017F>imple affect, having an exi<U+017F>tence apart by it <U+017F>elf, but that it is <U+017F>o conjoyned and compounded in tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ame parts with the primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, that the whole E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> (wherof we di<U+017F>pute) may be <U+017F>aid to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es united together (in them<U+017F>elvs indeed <U+017F>imple, if they be con<U+017F>idered a<U+017F>under) and therfore that the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> is only a part of the whol Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. And this needeth no other proof, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence propo<U+017F>ed above, and the <U+017F>aid viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>Tone<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
               </hi> are both found in tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ame parts. For that is properly called a compound Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, which is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by many <U+017F>imple Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es conjoyned in the <U+017F>ame Part.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We affirm that the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> is not only a part of the whole E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, but <U+017F>uch a part as hath <U+017F>ome dependance upon the primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, and therfore that it is a <U+017F>econdary part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed to the proof of this Propo<U+017F>ition two grants or conce<U+017F><U+017F>ions are to be premi<U+017F>ed.</p>
            <p>We grant fir<U+017F>t, That the <U+017F>aid <hi>Tone</hi> may be even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vitiated in other cau<U+017F>es perhaps, and likewi<U+017F>e by other cau<U+017F>es, although that happen not in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For the inherent <hi>Tone</hi> of the Parts may be primarily loo<U+017F>ned in the Animal Con<U+017F>titution, and that <U+017F>uddenly, as may be ob<U+017F>erved in the <hi>dead Pal<U+017F>y.</hi> For the natural ten<U+017F>ity (and not the Animal only) of the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytical</hi> member is loo<U+017F>ned, and indeed <U+017F>uddenly without any con<U+017F>picuous intervention of any part of the afore<U+017F>aid primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence. After the <U+017F>ame manner in a <hi>Lipothymy</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:169706:41"/>
or defection of the mind, loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s and langui<U+017F>hing <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly attatcheth al the parts. Now we cannot in either of the<U+017F>e two cau<U+017F>es refer the cau<U+017F>e of the loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s to the cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper of the natural Con<U+017F>titution, <U+017F>eeing that cannot be <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly and <U+017F>o <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which let them con<U+017F>ider (that we may give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by the way) who wil have the<U+017F>e common qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to be always <U+017F>econd and dependent upon the fir<U+017F>t alone: yea, on the other <U+017F>ide let them in that cau<U+017F>e ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve how a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper doth afterwards by degree, follow that loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s <U+017F>uddenly introduced. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as for the flaccidity of the parts that may be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly produced by large evacuations, as a flux of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <U+017F>weatings, and the like immoderate vents, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament being not yet con<U+017F>iderably changed, although we deny not but this may ea<U+017F>ily and doth u<U+017F>ually follow. Moreover an internal lubricity may be manife<U+017F>tly <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from coldne<U+017F>s, though very difficultly from moi<U+017F>ture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We grant that in the pre<U+017F>ent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated <hi>Tone</hi> doth not in any manner depend upon the fir<U+017F>t admitted E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, nor that in every re<U+017F>pect is <U+017F>ubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate unto it. For fir<U+017F>t the qualities of the <hi>Tone</hi> here vitiated, do al<U+017F>o ow <U+017F>omwhat to common cau<U+017F>es, namely to them<U+017F>elves, and al<U+017F>o to tho<U+017F>e that are common, to the fir<U+017F>t granted E<U+017F><U+017F>ence. For extream moi<U+017F>tening things by one and the <U+017F>ame operation are apt to produce both too much moi<U+017F>ture, and al<U+017F>o loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s. In like manner from violent evacuations, a want of Spirits, and withal a witheredne<U+017F>s doth ari<U+017F>e. Al<U+017F>o from things too too <U+017F>lippery, either outwardly admini<U+017F>tred, or inwardly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, or both, an internal lubricity is augmented, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper. For there is <U+017F>o great a connexion of the whole E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, hitherto propounded
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169706:41"/>
with the common cau<U+017F>es, that there is <U+017F>carce any thing which doth augment the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, but at the <U+017F>ame time more or le<U+017F>s it hath an influence upon the vitiated <hi>Tone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e things bring granted, We <U+017F>ay notwith<U+017F>tanding that in the pre<U+017F>ent affect there is a very great dependance of the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> upon the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; for which re<U+017F>pect alone we have here referred the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> to the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence. If any li<U+017F>t to contend, <hi>That the <U+017F>aid Tone in another re<U+017F>pect may relate more clearly to the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he may imagine that the primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of every Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milary and perpetually grounded upon the fir<U+017F>t qualities alone; or becau<U+017F>e he may conceive that the qualities wherein the <hi>Tone</hi> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth are perpetually <U+017F>econdary, and that they follow the fir<U+017F>t only (as the <U+017F>hadow doth the Sun) that man may take notice that we purpo<U+017F>ely decline <U+017F>uch que<U+017F>tions, lea<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould <U+017F>traggle into an unwarrantable digre<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
            <p>It remaineth therefore only that we prove the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the vitiated <hi>Tone</hi> upon the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> to be very great, and that we <U+017F>hal do by parts. We wil begin at the laxity. We grant indeed that a laxity may be <U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>uddenly produced, and in that cau<U+017F>e a moy<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper may often follow upon it, Namely, when the laxity primarily dependeth upon the fault ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Animal or Vital Con<U+017F>titution; but in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, <U+017F>eing that neither the Animal nor the Vital Con<U+017F>titution are primarily affected, there is a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that it mu<U+017F>t flow from other cau<U+017F>es. Moreover, <U+017F>uch is the condition of laxity and ten<U+017F>ity, that they are obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to <U+017F>udden alterations. For the <U+017F>trings of a Lute may almo<U+017F>t in a moment be <U+017F>tretched and loo<U+017F>ned again; the <U+017F>ame thing likewi<U+017F>e from <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F>es befalleth the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169706:42"/>
of the Parts, But in this affect the laxity <U+017F>tealeth on by degrees and <U+017F>lowly; therfore nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary it is that it mu<U+017F>t begin, be ruled and moderated by <U+017F>ome cau<U+017F> lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urely and <U+017F>lowly augmented. Although therfore we granted even now, that the laxity doth own <U+017F>omwhat to the common cau<U+017F>es of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; yet the augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof is chiefly re<U+017F>trained and moderated by the primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For moi<U+017F>tning Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines although they loo<U+017F>en withal, yet they <U+017F>carce loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en more than they moi<U+017F>ten, becau<U+017F> for the mo<U+017F>t part they loo<U+017F>en by moi<U+017F>tning. Seing therfore that the common cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> do flow into the Tone, chiefly by the Mediation of the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>: And <U+017F>eing that neither the Animal nor the Vital Con<U+017F>titution can here <U+017F>upply the vertue of a cau<U+017F>, we may Lawfully infer that the laxity of the Tone doth chiefly depend upon the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. This is further confirmed, there is of it <U+017F>elf a certain prone<U+017F>s and tendency of the Body to be through wet, <U+017F>o that the fibers of the parts mu<U+017F>t needs be loo<U+017F>ned by it: Moreover, the defect of the Spirits and the <U+017F>tupefaction of them doth cau<U+017F> a remi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Tone by dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hing the vigor of the part. Therfore we may conclude that the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, laxity principally dependeth upon the primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. As for the flaccidity becau<U+017F>e it comprehendeth the laxity, it <U+017F>pringeth from the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>es as that doth; but in as much as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth al<U+017F>o a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>idence and a certain emptine<U+017F>s, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently dependeth upon the defect and benummedne<U+017F>s of the inherent Spirits; the plenty and vigor whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing augmented the lank and flagging member is ea<U+017F>ily rendred turgid and <U+017F>welled. In the <hi>interim</hi> we deny not but that that <U+017F>ub<U+017F>idence doth withal depend upon the extenuation and atrophy of the parts.</p>

La<U+017F>tly, How the <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s doth proceed from the<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es is <U+017F>ufficiently manife<U+017F>ted by what hath been <U+017F>aid above.</p>
            <p>That we may at the length put a period to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it may be ob<U+017F>erved for the higher confirmation of tho<U+017F>e things already <U+017F>poken that there is <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>trict de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance between the Tone and the fir<U+017F>t granted E<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence, that throughout the whol cure of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> they are intended &amp; remitted together almo<U+017F>t in equal pace. For at fir<U+017F>tthe Children that are afflictedwith this affect; do only go <U+017F>lowly &amp; lei<U+017F>urely whil<U+017F>t the Tone of the parts is yet but a little loo<U+017F>ned; but in the progre<U+017F>s they <U+017F>carce and with much ado tru<U+017F>t to their feet, then they play only <U+017F>itting or as thay are carried about.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have already propounded that part of the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in the natural con<U+017F>titution, in as much as it comprehendeth the common qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; it remaineth now that we examin the organical vices, and the faults of continuity, if any <U+017F>uch be found out. But <U+017F>eing that no proper faults of continuity do accur in this affect, and <U+017F>eing that the organical vices do depend partly upon the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence above given, and partly upon the vital con<U+017F>titution being viciated, it <U+017F>eems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary in the next place to <U+017F>earch into the<U+017F>e faults of the vital con<U+017F>titution.</p>
            <p>The vital con<U+017F>titution is aptly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed into the original, or that which maketh an influx, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipative or that which is produced by that influx.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>ubject of the original vital con<U+017F>titution are the Spirits them<U+017F>elvs excited in the blood of the Arteries.

of the heart is indeed the fir<U+017F>t &amp; principal <U+017F>ubject of his natural and inherent con<U+017F>titution; but <U+017F>eing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the Vital Spirits (as hath been <U+017F>aid) it cannot be accounted the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject of the Vital Con<U+017F>titution, which is imprinted in it by tho<U+017F>e Spirits, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no longer than the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Heart is <U+017F>hedded and be<U+017F>prinkled with the Vital Spirits.

For he <U+017F>hall feel a far more aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented heat in the blood, than in the very <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> however it be handled.

In the movable and decaying Spirits (<U+017F>uch as the Vitals which are contained in the Arteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood) for <U+017F>om Member being cut off, the Life vani<U+017F>heth almo<U+017F>t in a moment, and by Con<U+017F>equence the vital con<U+017F>titution: but the natural (as we have already in<U+017F>inuated) continueth (though not in <U+017F>uch an exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as when the Vital remaineth) for a while after death.

This is mo<U+017F>t evidently confirmed, becau<U+017F>e the Vital con<U+017F>titution is <U+017F>uddenly intended, remitted and altered in al the parts in re<U+017F>pect of the model or mea<U+017F>ure of the Vital Con<U+017F>titution, excited in the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the Heart, <U+017F>o in a <hi>Lipothymy,</hi> the heart fainting, the life of the parts pre<U+017F>ently vani<U+017F>heth, at la<U+017F>t langui<U+017F>heth; but a<U+017F><U+017F>oon as the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the heart are refre<U+017F>hed with Spirits by <U+017F>ome proper cordial applications, <U+017F>traight way we behold the vital Con<U+017F>titution to be <U+017F>uddenly in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure repaired in all the Parts. In the <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of the breath <U+017F>udden death followeth the torrent of the vital Blood from the right to the left <hi>Ventricle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intercepted.

Therefore <U+017F>eing the Vital con<U+017F>titution is tran<U+017F>ient and fugitive in any of the <U+017F>olid parts, and <U+017F>eing it dependeth upon the proportion of the vital <U+017F>pirits flowing into them from the <hi>Ventricle</hi> of the heart, we may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infer that in the <U+017F>olid parts, it is not original but participative. But in the Vital Spirits them<U+017F>elves, by who<U+017F>e function the Vital con<U+017F>titution is diffu<U+017F>ed and tran<U+017F>mitted into all the Parts, it mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal: For there is no other original <U+017F>ubject of it to be found in the Body.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169706:45"/>
there doth not occur any fault repugnant to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Vital Spirits,</hi> which properly can be a part, even of the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For the heart it <U+017F>elf, for his doth rightly perform his func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>: and if any imperfection happen in the Generation of the <hi>Vital Spirits,</hi> it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a<U+017F>cribed to the heart, but to the ineptitude of the matter, to receive the form of the <hi>Vital Spirits.</hi> As the inge<U+017F>ted aliment if it be extreamly crude, it may fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate the perfection of a laudable concoction, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach being otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ound and faultle<U+017F>s: So the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt and unprofitable blood exported to the ventricles of the Heart, may render the action therof imperfect, in re<U+017F>pect of the operation and effect, how <U+017F>ound <U+017F>oever it may be in it <U+017F>elf: In which ca<U+017F>e the a<U+017F>cription of the fault is u<U+017F>ually and truly attributed to the indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed matter, and not to the Heart. You wil reply, a Feaver is <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times complicated with this affect, and at <U+017F>uch time the heart doth unaptly Generate the <hi>Vital Spirits,</hi> But that Feaver is a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> of a different kind, and by no means either the whol or any Part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this affect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We affirm that the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Arteries in<U+017F>erted into the fir<U+017F>t affected Parts, are in <U+017F>ome degree really cooled and benummed by them, through their adjacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and contact, and for that cau<U+017F> they do unaptly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv the <hi>Vital Spirits</hi> contained in them, wherupon the Vital Con<U+017F>titution of them is rendred <U+017F>omwhat imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, before they can be effu<U+017F>ed into the Parts them<U+017F>elvs. And this fault of the little Arteries <U+017F>eemeth by very good right to be a<U+017F>cribed to the Generation of the <hi>vital Spirits.</hi> For although it be not the function of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries to propogate the <hi>Vital Spirits</hi> according to the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ignification of the word; yet for this very rea<U+017F>on,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169706:45"/>
that they are obliged to con<U+017F>erv them when they are propagated, namly by <U+017F>uch a con<U+017F>ervation as in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner includeth a certain continuate <hi>Generation</hi> of them, their faults are rightly to be referred to the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Vital Spirits.</hi> For the Vital Con<U+017F>titution is a certain tran<U+017F>ient action (as we have <U+017F>hewed before) which, while it la<U+017F>teth, is in a continual flux and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which like a flame, when the continual fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and reparation of it is <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended and <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, <U+017F>uddenly extingui<U+017F>hed. Therfore are the <hi>Arteries</hi> as a continuate Heart to all the parts of the body, unto which they tran<U+017F>mit and powr out their contained Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and what faults <U+017F>oever of the Spirits happen before the effu<U+017F>ion of them into the habit of the Parts, <U+017F>eing that they nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily belong to the Original Vital Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution, and cannot otherwi<U+017F>e be a<U+017F>cribed to the di<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Spirits, they mu<U+017F>t be referred to the very Generation of them; namely, a continuate Generation in the Arteries, wherby they are continually pre<U+017F>erved from a <U+017F>udden extinction.</p>
            <p>Moreover, This fault of the Vital Spirits is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of the Vital and Original Con<U+017F>titution, and <U+017F>eing that it is <U+017F>omwhat preternatural, fir<U+017F>t hurting the action, from whence the participative con<U+017F>titution, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in like manner depraved, and <U+017F>eing that it meerly dependeth upon the primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence afore<U+017F>aid and is complicated in the <U+017F>ame parts, it will be a part of the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We <U+017F>ay that the matter of the Vital Spirits, to wit the Blood of the Veins impregnated with his Natural <U+017F>pirits returning in his circulation from the fir<U+017F>t affected parts towards the Heart, is <U+017F>omwhat di<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by them to admit the form of the Vital Spirit. For it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that the Blood, whil<U+017F>t it pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169706:46"/>
through the parts affected with a cold di<U+017F>temper, want and benummedne<U+017F>s of inherent Spirits, mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon affected with <U+017F>ome kind of frigidity, benummed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and perhaps with a thickne<U+017F>s and vi<U+017F>cous quality beyond the u<U+017F>ual degree of Nature. For as the blood doth give a tincture of his qualities to the parts tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which it glideth; So on the contrary, the parts them<U+017F>elves bequeath al<U+017F>o as much as they can of their qualities to the flowing blood. But here likewi<U+017F>e we mu<U+017F>t grant withal that this indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition in the parts fir<U+017F>t affected (e<U+017F>pecially when it is light and <U+017F>mal) in the return to the inward parts, is very much corrected by their heat, before it ari<U+017F>eth at the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the heart, nay that it is <U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>ubdued or if any <U+017F>uch contracted fault remain, it is commonly totally aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed by the length of the journy before the return of the Blood to the left <hi>Ventricle</hi> of the heart, whil<U+017F>t it floweth down by the right, and the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Lungs, the <U+017F>ame thing al<U+017F>o may be thus confirmed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F> if that indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition <U+017F>hould continue till the return of the blood to the left Ventricle of the Heart, the whol ma<U+017F>s of blood in the Arteries would become crude and imperfect; and <U+017F>eing that this blood thus abounding with imperfect Vital Spirits <U+017F>hould be tran<U+017F>mitted from the <hi>Aorta</hi> to al the Parts, it would more or le<U+017F>s affect them al; which very rarely is ob<U+017F>erved in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For the head, &amp; many bowels, however <U+017F>om of them are found to be greater then ordinary yet they <U+017F>eem to be watered with a perfect Vital Spirit. But although, as we have <U+017F>aid, the <U+017F>light indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the Blood may be corrected, before its return to the right ventricle, yet when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted fault is great and more con<U+017F>iderable, it cannot be altogether overcome, wherupon the Lungs in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F> are commonly afflicted with the mo<U+017F>t grievous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169706:46"/>
For, when the le<U+017F>s Spiritous, and therefore the le<U+017F>s pa<U+017F><U+017F>able Blood, is continually tran<U+017F>mitted thorow the Lungs, cold and thick, or vi<U+017F>cous, in proce<U+017F>s of time it mu<U+017F>t needs more or le<U+017F>s infect and ob<U+017F>truct the weaker parts of the Lungs; from whence proceed difficulty of drawing breath, a <U+017F>tubborn cough, hard tumors, inflammations, impo<U+017F>tumes, and the <hi>Pty<U+017F>ick.</hi> Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers al<U+017F>o both <hi>Erratick</hi> and <hi>Hectick,</hi> may from hence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Origen. But <U+017F>eing that fault may be <U+017F>uddenly introduced from the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, it is credible (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have <U+017F>aid the Lungs are often infected by it) that it is for the mo<U+017F>t part overcome, before the Blood can com to the left Ventricle. And this may be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on why the Head and the adjacent parts do look <U+017F>o well and flouri<U+017F>hing, namely, becau<U+017F> neither the Natural nor the Vital Con<U+017F>titution is hurt in them, <U+017F>eing that the perfect Vital Spirits generated in the left Ventricle, and di<U+017F>tributed from thence, do excite that fre<U+017F>h color in the face; when on the contrary the Lungs do oftentimes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor under the faults afore<U+017F>aid, the viciou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the Blood not being corrected before it enter the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle and the Arterious vein.</p>
            <p>Moreover, This imperfect production of Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the right Ventricle of the Heart, by rea<U+017F>on of the crudene<U+017F>s of the affluent Blood, flowing in the Veins, totally appertaineth to the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and mu<U+017F>t be accounted a part of it: for the Vital Con<U+017F>titution is vitiated, wherupon the actions in the Lungs are depraved, and it dependeth wholy and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry re<U+017F>pect upon the primary granted E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, neither in the mean time, doth it re<U+017F>ide in the <U+017F>olid Sub<U+017F>tance of the Heart, that it <U+017F>hould therfore de<U+017F>erv the name of a a new di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Here we note by the way, That Phy<U+017F>itians in the cure
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169706:47"/>
of this affect do ever intermingle <U+017F>uch things with their remedies as have re<U+017F>pect to the benefit of the Lungs; and not without rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>eing that it is apparent by what hath been <U+017F>aid, to how much danger that Bowel is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <U+017F>ubject.

            <p>But fir<U+017F>t we mu<U+017F>t grant that the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages and circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169706:47"/>
of the Blood, thorow the fir<U+017F>t affected parts is not very difficult in this affect. For although a cold di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a want and benummedne<U+017F>s of Spirits, do <U+017F>eem very difficultly to admit a tran<U+017F>ition of the Blood thorow the parts affected, with the<U+017F>e qualities; yet indeed other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned qualities; as moy<U+017F>ture, loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, laxity, flaccidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, and internal lubricity, can at the lea<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute as much power to facilitate the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of it, as the qualities afore<U+017F>aid can oppo<U+017F>e to the interruption of it. Yea, if you valu them by a ju<U+017F>t e<U+017F>timation, perhaps they can do more, but we wil not in this place a<U+017F><U+017F>ert it, only we flatly deny the difficulty of the circulation to be greater. For, if we may compare hard bodies with <U+017F>oft, low bodies with <U+017F>traight, moi<U+017F>t with dry, <U+017F>lippery with rough, we <U+017F>hal ea<U+017F>ily perceiv that the circulation of the blood is much more quick and expedite in tho<U+017F>e, then in the<U+017F>e. And this is manife<U+017F>t in young Creatures in whom tho<U+017F>e qualities abound, in <U+017F>uch as are new born, although the Heart be very tender, the Arteries le<U+017F>s firm, the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ificative vertu, yet feeble and weak, yet the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing too and fro of the blood are readily and ea<U+017F>ily exerci<U+017F>ed; which in tho<U+017F>e that are older is not accompli<U+017F>hed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <U+017F>tronger pul<U+017F>e, and an indeavor or a kind of labor of the Heart and Arteries. Again, according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the Bodies of children are mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ible; namly, by rea<U+017F>on of their humidity, laxity, and <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s. Be<U+017F>ides, if we ob<U+017F>erv the formation of the chicken in the eg, the matter wil be yet more plain. Within few days after the incubation the Heart of the chicken is <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly and evidently <U+017F>een to beat, and to begin the circulation of the Blood: but if at the <U+017F>ame time we con<U+017F>ider the frailty of the Heart it <U+017F>elf, and how weak a coherence there is between the parts of it, til in the interim it fini<U+017F>heth the circulation of the blood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169706:48"/>
to the manner of it, <U+017F>uch as it is<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> we mu<U+017F>t ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>arily grant that in that <U+017F>hapele<U+017F>s lump, moi<U+017F>ture, and internal lubricity do expediate and facilitate that motion. Some perhaps may object that in the<U+017F>e cited ca<U+017F>es the liberty and readine<U+017F>s of the circulation of the blood, depends not <U+017F>o much upon the moi<U+017F>ture, <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s, as upon the plenty of the inherent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits. For in the <hi>Cachexia,</hi> Green <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, and the drop<U+017F>y, the fle<U+017F>h is very <U+017F>oft, moi<U+017F>t; and perhaps <U+017F>lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, when in the mean time the tran<U+017F>ition of the Blood is very difficult. We an<U+017F>wer, tho<U+017F>e Bodies that wax tender and <U+017F>oft by a paucity of inherent Spirits, are le<U+017F>s indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, and more apt to admit the circulation of the Blood then the other parts. But it is not <U+017F>imply tru that <U+017F>uch bodies which mo<U+017F>t abound with Spirits do perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obtain the mo<U+017F>t expedite and unre<U+017F>trained circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Blood: for the Blood is more ea<U+017F>ily circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in Fi<U+017F>h, then in Creatures of the Land, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t by the tender and frail Con<U+017F>titution of their Heart, and Arteries; yet they enjoy a le<U+017F>s quantity of Inherent Spirits. But becau<U+017F>e they live perpetually in the waters, therfore is their fle<U+017F>h more moi<U+017F>t and <U+017F>lippery. Whence it mo<U+017F>t evidently appeareth how effectual the inward lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricity and moi<U+017F>ture are to facilitate the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood. As for tho<U+017F>e that are invaded with the Green <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s or afflicted with a <hi>Cachexia,</hi> we grant indeed that the circulation of the Blood is difficult in them, yet not only through a defect of inherent Spirits, but by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>tubborn ob<U+017F>tructions lodging in the whol bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Wherefore it mu<U+017F>t be granted, notwith<U+017F>tanding the cold di<U+017F>temper, the penury, and <U+017F>tupefaction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which procure a difficulty to the circulation, that <U+017F>uch a Mediocrity is impo<U+017F>ed upon it, by the moi<U+017F>ture, <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, and internal <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s, that the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169706:48"/>
Blood may be reduced to a ju<U+017F>t, if not an extream faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But if the moi<U+017F>ture, <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, and inward <U+017F>lippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine<U+017F>s be <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable to effectuate an ea<U+017F>ie circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood, Truly, the di<U+017F>tribution of it through the parts fir<U+017F>t affected <U+017F>eemeth to be expected more <U+017F>wift and not more <U+017F>low. We an<U+017F>wer that the facility of the tran<U+017F>ition of the Blood is oppo<U+017F>ed to the <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s of the motion, or to the <U+017F>malne<U+017F>s of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. For a <U+017F>wift motion may be <U+017F>low, and in a <U+017F>mal Channel. But the facility is here oppo<U+017F>ed to difficulty, <U+017F>triving, and labor, which in this ca<U+017F>e, if the circulation were diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, <U+017F>hould happen to the Artery in the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood. But that the Arteries do undergo <U+017F>ome labor in expediting the circulation of the Blood into the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, <U+017F>hall anon be demon<U+017F>trated; we only affirm in this place that the facility, of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood doth not <U+017F>ufficiently argue either the <U+017F>wift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the motion, nor the widne<U+017F>s of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. For, two cau<U+017F>es do chiefly con<U+017F>pire to ha<U+017F>ten the cour<U+017F>e of the Blood through the habit of the parts. One is the aptitude of the part recipient, or that through which the blood ought to flow; and this cau<U+017F>e is meerly pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive and <U+017F>lothful: the other is the impul<U+017F>ion of the Heart and Artery, and al<U+017F>o of the Arterious Blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to <U+017F>tretch and dilate it <U+017F>elf. This cau<U+017F>e is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and full of vivacity. For upon the ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of this impul<U+017F>ion, the di<U+017F>tribution of the Blood will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently after totally cea<U+017F>e, however the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age may be otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ie, manife<U+017F>t therfore it is that this impul<U+017F>ion is the principal &amp; active cau<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>wiftnes and <U+017F>lownes, and al<U+017F>o of the quantity of the di<U+017F>tribution of the Blood. Wherfore tho<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es which do any way advance or hinder this impul<U+017F>ion, do now come to undergo a more accurate examination.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169706:49"/>
For by the<U+017F>e we <U+017F>hall know whether the de<U+017F>tribution of the Blood in the parts fir<U+017F>t affected, be really more <U+017F>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or <U+017F>low than is meet.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es do chiefly concur to excite that impul<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Fir<U+017F>t, the plenty and activity of the Vital <U+017F>pirits contained in the Blood. Secondly, the perfect <U+017F>ound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the Heart. Thirdly, The firmitude, heat, and ju<U+017F>t magnitude of the Arteries. Fourthly, An irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of the Heart and Arteries, whether extrin<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally or intrin<U+017F>ecally cau<U+017F>ed. The<U+017F>e we will run over in their order, that it may appear in what condition they are in this pre<U+017F>ent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Fir<U+017F>t, As for the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and activity of the Vital Spirits, we have already <U+017F>hewed that in this affect the imperfect Vital Spirits are frequently excited in the right Ventricle of the Heart. Seing therefore that the Blood tainted with the<U+017F>e imperfect Spirits, mu<U+017F>t be driven into the Lungs, there is a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity the de<U+017F>tribution mu<U+017F>t there become more <U+017F>paring and <U+017F>low by rea<U+017F>on of the defect of the Spirits. Again, <U+017F>eeing that the vital blood, as we have al<U+017F>o <U+017F>hewed above, is <U+017F>omwhat cooled in the Arteries, which are terminated in the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary likewi<U+017F>e that the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of it through the <U+017F>aid parts mu<U+017F>t be dimini<U+017F>hed and more dull.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The vertue of the Heart, unle<U+017F>s peradventure by accident through the complication of <U+017F>ome other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, is <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>een to be viciated in this affect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For <U+017F>o much as concerneth the Arteries, we cannot accu<U+017F>e their condition of any notable defect in reference to their <U+017F>trength. But there is a manife<U+017F>t fault both in their heat and magnitude. Fir<U+017F>t, in their heat, the Arteries in<U+017F>erted into the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily by their cold di<U+017F>temper be <U+017F>omwhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the like di<U+017F>temper. For <U+017F>eing that a di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169706:49"/>
of the parts fir<U+017F>t affected is active and permanent, it is unavoidable but they mu<U+017F>t more or le<U+017F>s introduce a like quality into the parts <U+017F>o neerly bordering to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, For natural agents are bu<U+017F>ily indu<U+017F>trious to a<U+017F><U+017F>imilate all Bodies placcd within the Sphear of their activity, but e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch as are circumambient and neerly adjacent. But if any man doubt whether that coldne<U+017F>s of the Arteries can retard and le<U+017F><U+017F>en the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Blood through the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, let him con<U+017F>ider that frigidity is of it <U+017F>elf an enemy to any kind of motion. For it is the quality of cold by its own Nature to arre<U+017F>t Violences, and impetuous oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itions, to conden<U+017F>ate, to induce <U+017F>loth, to <U+017F>uperinduce <hi>Somnolency,</hi> <U+017F>tupefaction, and immobility, and when it attaineth a more inten<U+017F>ive degree, to congeal and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the parts. Therfore it mu<U+017F>t needs ca<U+017F>t a <hi>Remora</hi> to the torrent or the Blood waving through the parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with that quality. Be<U+017F>ides, In the opening of a Vein we have often ob<U+017F>erved upon the cooling of the member that the Blood hath flowed more <U+017F>lowly and <U+017F>paringly, and if the member be warmed again, or the pul<U+017F>e be excited by rubbing or any other motion or means, that then the Blood floweth again with a more plentiful and liberal current. Moreover, the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of cold things is <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly effectual to <U+017F>top Blood pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally bur<U+017F>ting out of any part, as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hot things do provoke the ebullition of it.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, <hi>That the Pul<U+017F>e is many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuated and intended by the cold outwardly oppo<U+017F>ed; as by the handling and playing with <U+017F>now, we <U+017F>ee that not only the Pul<U+017F>e but the heat al<U+017F>o is augmented in the hands of tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>port them<U+017F>elves with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We an<U+017F>wer, Cold things of them<U+017F>elves do alwaies move the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood through the habit of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169706:50"/>
parts; but that by accident they may intend the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, if at length they provoke the pul<U+017F>es of the Arteries (as in the <U+017F>aid ca<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>now it happneth) to beat <U+017F>tronger marches. But this never comes to pa<U+017F>s in this pre<U+017F>ent affect. For (as we have already <U+017F>hewed) the circulation of the Blood in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, however it may <U+017F>uffer <hi>Immunitior</hi> or <hi>Retardation,</hi> yet it continueth <U+017F>ufficiently ea<U+017F>y and expedite, neither doth any irritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pul<U+017F> ari<U+017F>e from thence, as anon we <U+017F>hal perceiv more plainly. For <U+017F>eing it is manife<U+017F>t by what hath been <U+017F>aid, that the Arteries reaching to the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, become more cold then ordinary, or is meet, we may ea<U+017F>ily beleev that they become likewi<U+017F>e more <U+017F>len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; <U+017F>o in any cooled member we <U+017F>ee the Veins and the Arteries become more <U+017F>lender then they were wont to be; and it cannot be denyed, but that actual cold doth <U+017F>traighten the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. But it is more then probable that a Potential coldne<U+017F>s (<U+017F>uch as perhaps that may be <U+017F>aid to be which is of an inward di<U+017F>temper) doth likewi<U+017F>e make the Veins and Arteries more <U+017F>lender. So we <U+017F>ee cold Complexions, and al<U+017F>o cold and moi<U+017F>t, to have le<U+017F>s Veins and Arteries then the hot. Corpulent bodies, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, children, have narrower Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, then lean, men, or youths. Be<U+017F>ides, the very heat it <U+017F>elf is an expan<U+017F>ive quality, that it may enlarge the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and cold a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive quality, that it may re<U+017F>train and <U+017F>traiten the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els. Finally, one of us ob<U+017F>erved that upon the di<U+017F><U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Bodies peri<U+017F>hing by this affect: He hath <U+017F>omtimes found the Veins, and the Arteries, tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fir<U+017F>t affected parts to be of an undue <U+017F>lender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s: but that tho<U+017F>e Arteries called <hi>Carotides,</hi> and the <hi>Iugulary</hi> Veins were di<U+017F>proportinatly amplified; and in is credible that this might have been perpetually ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, had they that opened the bodies minded it with a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169706:50"/>
attentive contemplation. But this we peremptorily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm not, but leave it to future inquiry: in the interim <U+017F>eing that it <U+017F>ufficiently appeareth by what hath been <U+017F>aid that the circulation of the Blood, in the fir<U+017F>t affected parts is dimini<U+017F>hed, it is likewi<U+017F>e agreable to rea<U+017F>on, that the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els al<U+017F>o of tho<U+017F>e parts are <U+017F>traitned. And <U+017F>eing that the left Ventricle of the Heart, doth pour <U+017F>o great a quantity into the <hi>Aorta</hi> as may <U+017F>uffice al the parts, and <U+017F>eing that <U+017F>o many parts primarily affected do <U+017F>paringly <U+017F>ip, that blood it is very probable that it is di<U+017F>tributed with an unu<U+017F>ual liberality thorow the other parts, and namly thorow the Head and Liver, and therefore the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the<U+017F>e parts are <U+017F>omwhat dilated and amplified. Concerning the le<U+017F>ned circulation of the Blood in this affect: We ad this experiment only, a ligature being wound about the arm or thighs of a yong boy grievou<U+017F>ly tormented with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, the Veins did not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>wel beyond the ligature, neither did the habit of the part ful of Blood appear in that place <U+017F>o <U+017F>well'd and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored as it u<U+017F>ually doth in tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>ound. From whence apparent it is, that the tran<U+017F>ition of the Blood thorow tho<U+017F>e parts is more dul and le<U+017F>s plentiful, then it ought to be as a river <U+017F>topped by a dam or wal doth <U+017F>oo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later overflow the Banks, according to the various <U+017F>wiftne<U+017F>s and magnitude of the Torrent: So likewi<U+017F>e it happneth here, the retiring of the Blood thorow the Vein, to the inward parts, is intercepted by the force of the ligature, which if it were violent, would in a <U+017F>hort time fil the Veins, and the habit of the parts beyond the ligature; as we <U+017F>ee it to happen otherwi<U+017F>e in <U+017F>ound Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons; but becau<U+017F>e in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> it filleth them <U+017F>lowly, and very dully, we mu<U+017F>t conclude that the circulation of the Blood in tho<U+017F>e parts is extreamly le<U+017F><U+017F>ened and <U+017F>low, and that the Arteries in<U+017F>erted into tho<U+017F>e parts are more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169706:51"/>
cold and <U+017F>lender then they ought to be, as we have mo<U+017F>t abundantly proved, that the Arteries of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts are vitiated by a defect of ju<U+017F>t magnitude.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As for the irritation of the Heart and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries (which perhaps is the principle cau<U+017F> of many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the pul<U+017F>es) it is manife<U+017F>tly found to be weak and ineffectual in the Arteries of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts. We purpo<U+017F>e not at this time to di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cau<U+017F>es, differences and effects of irritation in the pul<U+017F>es; only we ob<U+017F>erv in general that it may be either natural or violent; and that each of them may be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>al or particular, and withal may ari<U+017F>e either from within or from without. And la<U+017F>tly, that it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ive or defective: In the handling of the pre<U+017F>ent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F> it wil <U+017F>uffice to touch upon the particular Irritation of the Arteries, and afterwards to accommodate our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>es to the pre<U+017F>ent bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. 1. Therfore, we affirm that the Arteries impel the Blood into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance or habit of the parts, by a certain labor and contention; and that the parts which receiv that Blood do make <U+017F>om re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance and oppo<U+017F>ition: that by rea<U+017F>on of this conflict the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are Irritated to make <U+017F>tronger re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tances or pul<U+017F>es; and that that Skirmi<U+017F>hing is of <U+017F>o great moment to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the pul<U+017F>e and render it more vigorous, that when it is weak, the Pul<U+017F> can <U+017F>carce be <U+017F>trong: but where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is <U+017F>omwhat more increa<U+017F>ed, yet <U+017F>o, that it doth not overcome the oppo<U+017F>ition of the Arteries, the pul<U+017F>e becomes more <U+017F>trong and lively, provided that no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment from <U+017F>om other cau<U+017F> doth intervene. This we might illu<U+017F>trate by divers in<U+017F>tances, but we wil exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it only in a few: in the winter the pul<U+017F>es are more ful, hard, <U+017F>trong and con<U+017F>tant, then in the <U+017F>ummer; but it is certain that at that time the outward parts of the body being bound up with cold, are more firm and le<U+017F>s
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169706:51"/>
pa<U+017F><U+017F>able, and therfore that they do more <U+017F>trongly then at other times re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Blood, contending to pa<U+017F>s thorow the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of them in his circulation; wherupon the Arteries, when no other intervening matter hindreth, mu<U+017F>t needs move more vigorou<U+017F>ly, and drive the Blood more forcibly, if they perform their office in perfecting the circulation of the Blood. Hereupon tho<U+017F>e Arteries are irritated, unle<U+017F>s they be totally <U+017F>uppre<U+017F>t, or by <U+017F>ome other means charmed, and by degrees yeeld <U+017F>tronger <U+017F>trokes; and withal the Spiritous Blood being pent in &amp; <U+017F>triving for more room they do wax a little more hot, and are <U+017F>omwhat enlarged, and <U+017F>omtimes having a little triumphed over the <U+017F>ubdued oppo<U+017F>ition, they drive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the blood into the parts, with a more <U+017F>wift &amp; copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous torrent then before. This is further confirmed by the heat augmented by handling <U+017F>now, for although at the fir<U+017F>t the Hands wax pre<U+017F>ently cold, yet in a <U+017F>hort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they grow hot, &amp; withal they are died &amp; colored with Blood, as the inten<U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s of the heat doth ju<U+017F>tify. For upon the fir<U+017F>t contrectation or touch of the <U+017F>now the parts are bound up, and <U+017F>trongly re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the circulation of the Blood, the Arteries al<U+017F>o in tho<U+017F>e parts are at the <U+017F>ame time contracted But, unle<U+017F>s the cold prevail to a total <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Spirits contained in tho<U+017F>e Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and to a <U+017F>tupifying of the Arteries them<U+017F>elvs, or at lea<U+017F>t a benummedne<U+017F>s, tho<U+017F>e Arteries are by degrees irritated, and the interrupted Blood more forcibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for wider room, and <U+017F>o at length by this counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppo<U+017F>ition, the Arteries wax hot and are dilated, and the pul<U+017F> being increa<U+017F>ed, they extrude the Blood more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully into the part before overcooled. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the <U+017F>ummer, when le<U+017F>s re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance is oppo<U+017F>ed again<U+017F>t the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood, the pul<U+017F>e becomes more feeble, more languid, and more <U+017F>oft. From whence it appears
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169706:52"/>
that the defect of a du irritation, proceeding from the weak re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the parts which receav the Blood from the Arteries<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> doth dimini<U+017F>h the vigor of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <U+017F>ame is yet more evidently <U+017F>een when the Pul<U+017F>e is augmented by the motion of the Body; for in any violent motion almo<U+017F>t all the Mu<U+017F>cles are <U+017F>tret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, by rea<U+017F>on wherof they <U+017F>omwhat more re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood; hereupon the Arteries are provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to contention, their heat is encrea<U+017F>ed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more nimble, <U+017F>trong and full Pul<U+017F>es are emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As the inflamation of a part doth <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly irritate the Arteries thereof, <U+017F>o it exciteth a more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Pul<U+017F>e and bau<U+017F>eth a more liberal Flux of the Blood. The <U+017F>ame may be <U+017F>aid of pain.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hither al<U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t be referred the brui<U+017F>ing of any part. For a brui<U+017F>ed part doth difficultly receive the Blood flowing to it: hereupon the Arteries provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they beat more <U+017F>trongly, and <U+017F>well the brui<U+017F>ed part re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting them into a tumor. This might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>tred by many more examples, but we conceive the<U+017F>e to be very <U+017F>ufficient and <U+017F>atisfactory.</p>
            <p>Moreover, It mu<U+017F>t be noted that the parts cau<U+017F>ed by the reception of the Blood in the Arteries, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, and yet not <U+017F>ufficient effectually to irritate the Arteries; in which ca<U+017F>e it rather remitteth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turbeth them, encrea<U+017F>eth, or facilitateth the force of the torrent of the Blood. For that oppo<U+017F>ition of it <U+017F>elf interrupteth the channel of the Blood thorow the <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance of the parts; but becau<U+017F> it doth withal irritate the Arteries to emit more lively <U+017F>trokes, it quickneth the torrent of it by accident. Wherfore we are here compelled into another involuntary digre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169706:52"/>
between the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the part that irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and that which doth not, or doth very little irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the in<U+017F>tances already alledged will <U+017F>uffice for the former, and to explain the latter we will ad a few.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, Therefore there is a re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance that totally <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>eth the torrent of the Blood. Such a one is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed by a <U+017F>trong ligature, which doth altogether inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the pul<U+017F>e in tho<U+017F>e parts beyond it, neither yet doth it irritate the Arteries on this <U+017F>ide of it, becau<U+017F>e it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh all the force of the Artery beyond the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and doth wholly break off the action thereof. The <U+017F>ame is <U+017F>een in the parts mortified with cold, or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cau<U+017F>es corrupted with an inflamation; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in <U+017F>ome hard <U+017F>wellings, contractures and <U+017F>ome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed wounds.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing down the Arteries even by the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Arteries, and this happeneth in a ligature indifferently bound. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o in the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of an Artery by <U+017F>ome tumor in the adjacent parts as in a raw <U+017F>welling; al<U+017F>o in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion from any outward cau<U+017F>e, many things which belong to the lying down on the right <U+017F>ide e<U+017F>pecially, and the left are referred hither; <U+017F>o in tumors on the right <U+017F>ide, the lying on the left <U+017F>ide is many times endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the lea<U+017F>t patience by the compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the <U+017F>ound parts by tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>welled &amp;c. and this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion however it re<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth the circulation of the Blood, yet it doth not <U+017F>eem much to irritate the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, becau<U+017F>e it doth no le<U+017F>s intercept the very pul<U+017F>ifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive force, then it dimini<U+017F>heth the action thereof. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps it may <U+017F>omtimes irritate in the Lungs by rea<U+017F>on of their vehement heat, ju<U+017F>t as it u<U+017F>eth to do in aching and inflamed parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance in part repre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169706:53"/>
circulation of the Blood, but without compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Arteries, nor yet totally <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ing them, nor very much irritating the Artery. Such an one occurreth in ob<U+017F>tructions cau<U+017F>ed by cold, <U+017F>low, thick, and moi<U+017F>t hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which although they may <U+017F>omwhat retard the free pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood, yet they provoke the Artery very little, becau<U+017F>e at the <U+017F>ame time they <U+017F>uperinduce a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain benummedne<U+017F>s in them, at lea<U+017F>t a cold di<U+017F>temper, as al<U+017F>o in the Blood which they contain. The <U+017F>ame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t may be <U+017F>aid of paralytical members, but that in the<U+017F>e a benummedne<U+017F>s is more evidently introduced in their Arteries, and the channel of the Blood is le<U+017F>s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded in them,</p>
            <p>Moreover, We affirm <U+017F>econdly that the parts fir<U+017F>t affected in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> do not <U+017F>ufficiently irritate the Arteries, by which the Blood is di<U+017F>tributed through them. For although in the<U+017F>e parts, both by rea<U+017F>on of their <U+017F>olidity, and al<U+017F>o in re<U+017F>pect of their coldne<U+017F>s, we grant <U+017F>ome kind of re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, yet it is extream feeble and <U+017F>low, and very little provoking. Fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e in tho<U+017F>e paris a moi<U+017F>t is conjoyned with the cold di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which of it <U+017F>elf tempereth and qualifieth all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of provocations. Secondly, Becau<U+017F> there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury of inherent Spirits, which otherwi<U+017F>e, where they abound, are wont to cheri<U+017F>h the vigor of the Arteries, and the blood contained in them. Thirdly, Becau<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e parts are loo<U+017F>, weak, and <U+017F>oft, and therfore more prone to receive with facility that which the Arteries <U+017F>end in, than to exa<U+017F>perate them by re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. And that the Arteries do not conveigh the Blood by any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and con<U+017F>iderable force into the<U+017F>e parts, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t by this <U+017F>ign, becau<U+017F> after the influx of the Spirits, and the Blood they <U+017F>till continue loo<U+017F>, <U+017F>oft and feeble, when on the contrary <U+017F>trong Pul<U+017F>es are wont to render
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169706:53"/>
the parts otherwi<U+017F>e weak, ful, <U+017F>woln, and <U+017F>tiff, on a <U+017F>ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Fifthly, becau<U+017F> the fir<U+017F>t affected parts have in them a <U+017F>imilary lubricity. For as the <U+017F>uperficiary or external lubricity <U+017F>uffereth any thing to pa<U+017F>s by, without attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o the Internal or <U+017F>imilary lubricity facilitates the circulation of the Blood, <U+017F>o that the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli<U+017F>hed with very <U+017F>mal oppo<U+017F>ition. We conclude therfore that the proirritation of the Arteries is in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> deficient; and therfore that the Arteries are very dully and ineffectually excited to <U+017F>trengthen the pul<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Having at the length weighed al things which we propounded concerning the cau<U+017F>es which actuate and advance the Blood in his circulation, it <U+017F>ufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the circulation of the Blood in this affect is ea<U+017F>y and expedit enough, but that it is le<U+017F><U+017F>ened and pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth dully thorow the parts fir<U+017F>t affected, both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of the <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s of the Arterious Blood contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Artery of the <U+017F>aid parts, and al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F> of the defective heat, and <U+017F>lenderne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e Arteries; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, in regard of their ineffectual irritation. And let the<U+017F>e things <U+017F>uffice concerning the two former faults belonging to the di<U+017F>tribution of the Blood in this affect, namly, the diminution and <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s therof. It remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the next place to examine the inequality of that di<U+017F>tribution.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XI. The Inequality of the Di<U+017F>tribution of the Blood in this Affect.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His inequality is to be e<U+017F>timated by a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>on of the greatnes &amp; <U+017F>wiftne<U+017F>s of the current of the Blood, made in divers parts. For if the circulation of the Blood according to a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical proportion be either equally <U+017F>mal and <U+017F>low, or equally great and <U+017F>wift, that mu<U+017F>t be judged equal by the <U+017F>cope of the pre<U+017F>ent enquiries: on the contrary, if in <U+017F>ome parts it be little and <U+017F>low, and in others great and <U+017F>wift, that mu<U+017F>t be reputed unequal and di<U+017F>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate. And this is the State of the pre<U+017F>ent di<U+017F>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition.</p>
            <p>It is manife<U+017F>t by what hath been <U+017F>aid, That the <U+017F>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood thorow the parts fir<U+017F>t affected, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly <U+017F>paring and <U+017F>low: It remaineth therfore only that we con<U+017F>ider whether it be tran<U+017F>mitted thorow the other parts with a quicker and more plentifull motion.</p>
            <p>We have already affirmed that the root of this evil is not fixed in the Heart it <U+017F>elf, and that this Bowel of it <U+017F>elf is not primarily il affected in re<U+017F>pect of the left Ventricle therof. It is credible therefore, that the Heart (unle<U+017F>s perhaps <U+017F>om other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be conjoyned or <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervene) doth rightly execute his function, and expel a <U+017F>ufficient quantity of Blood, for our turn by every <U+017F>troke into the <hi>Aorta.</hi> Seing therfore (as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169706:54"/>
proved) that the Blood is niggardly di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed from the <hi>Aorta</hi> into the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, a <U+017F>uperfluous por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it mu<U+017F>t needs be di<U+017F>tributed into other parts not <U+017F>o affected: for otherwi<U+017F>e the <hi>Aorta</hi> <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently di<U+017F>charge it <U+017F>elf, nor disburthen the Blood received from the Heart, but it would be ob<U+017F>tructed and oppre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed with the plenty therof; and this repletion upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <U+017F>light occa<U+017F>ion would fly back, even to the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, and there kindle a Feaver. And we grant indeed, for this very cau<U+017F>, among others, that in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> a Feaver is ea<U+017F>ily and frequently produced. But <U+017F>eing that the Feaver is another Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> conjoyned, and <U+017F>eparable and different from this, and <U+017F>eing that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> very often happneth without a Feaver; it mu<U+017F>t needs be granted, that by how much more <U+017F>paringly the Blood is di<U+017F>tributed to the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, by <U+017F>o much the more plentifully conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed to the other parts, at lea<U+017F>t in the ab<U+017F>ence of the Feaver. For <U+017F>eing that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood, as we <U+017F>aid even now, is extruded into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> as may <U+017F>uffice the whole Body, and <U+017F>eing al of it mu<U+017F>t be di<U+017F>tributed into <U+017F>everal parts, it mo<U+017F>t plainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the le<U+017F>s is tran<U+017F>mitted into one part, the more is di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed into another. And thus it may be perceived that the inequality of the di<U+017F>tribution of the Blood is inferred from the <U+017F>ole diminution thereof, in the fir<U+017F>t affected parts above a<U+017F><U+017F>erted, (at lea<U+017F>t probably) namly, from the <U+017F>mal and <U+017F>low current of the Blood thorow the parts fir<U+017F>t affected, there may be rightly collected à more quick and plentiful <U+017F>tream of it, into the inward parts not <U+017F>o affected. Now let us <U+017F>ee whether the other appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances relating hither are corre<U+017F>pondent to this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, It <U+017F>eemeth manife<U+017F>t by what hath been alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Head, the Brain, the Liver, and the other Bowels, are not afflicted with that cold di<U+017F>temper, nor
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169706:55"/>
that <U+017F>tupefaction and penury of inherent Spirits, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the parts primarily affected are oppre<U+017F>t. For the bowels and the <U+017F>aid parts do not receive their Nerves from the Spinal Marrow, without the Skul, but they are involved in the <U+017F>ame condition with the other parts. Moreover, tho<U+017F>e parts, as far as we can judg by the touch are (at lea<U+017F>t outwardly) moderatly hot, and as far as we can gue<U+017F>s by the <U+017F>ight they retain their native and flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hing color, be<U+017F>ides they are more ful and fle<U+017F>hly, then the fir<U+017F>t affected parts.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Children afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> have an indifferently good appetite, they do not il concoct the intro<U+017F>umed aliment, and about the Head they retain their <U+017F>en<U+017F>es very acute: they <U+017F>ee, they hear, they ta<U+017F>t, they <U+017F>mel as <U+017F>ubtily as others, and as for their wit, they many times <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s tho<U+017F>e of equal years with them; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s an impediment from <U+017F>ome other cau<U+017F>. All which things put together do abundantly witne<U+017F>s, that a cold di<U+017F>temper, nor a benummedne<U+017F>s or penury of Inherent Spirits, hath none, or at lea<U+017F>t a very <U+017F>mal predominancy in tho<U+017F>e parts. The<U+017F>e things being granted, we mu<U+017F>t likewi<U+017F>e needs grant that a more liberal di<U+017F>tribution of the Blood is di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed to the <U+017F>aid parts. For as for the heat, we have already <U+017F>hewed that that doth both am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify and <U+017F>tir up the Arteries to <U+017F>end forth a <U+017F>tronger pul<U+017F>ation; and we have al<U+017F>o noted above that the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spirits, doth not only cheri<U+017F>h the pul<U+017F>ificative force of the Arteries, and con<U+017F>erv the vigor of the Blood contained in them, but that it doth <U+017F>omwhat enliven and excitate both of them, and that by <U+017F>o much the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, by how much the le<U+017F>s the inherent Spirits are affected with a <U+017F>tupefaction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, unle<U+017F>s tho<U+017F>e parts were watered with a more liberal circulation of the Blood, they would becom more
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169706:55"/>
<U+017F>oft, loo<U+017F>, and feeble, then they are, even as the parts fir<U+017F>t affected are ob<U+017F>erved to be. For upon the defect or langui<U+017F>hing of the Pul<U+017F> in any part, the part pre<U+017F>ently becoms loo<U+017F> and weak, as it happneth to al the Parts in a <hi>Lipothymy.</hi> On the contrary, when the Pul<U+017F> beats <U+017F>trongly, the Part wherunto it belongeth, is <U+017F>een to be <U+017F>omwhat rigid and <U+017F>welled. For a ful Pul<U+017F> doth pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fil up tho<U+017F>e parts, which were before <U+017F>unk down by emptine<U+017F>s; as the <hi>Lypothymy</hi> being driven away, and the Pul<U+017F> being re<U+017F>tored, the Parts of the Body, which were before loo<U+017F> and languid, are not only wel colored, but ful of vivacity and turgid: <U+017F>eing therfore that tho<U+017F>e Parts are not affected with that <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, and weakne<U+017F>s, we mu<U+017F>t conclude that they are actuated with a full Pul<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The very augmented magnitude of the<U+017F> parts, in compari<U+017F>on of the parts primarily affected in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth witne<U+017F>s, that they are more liberally fed with their aliment, namly, the Blood, (which is reputed the common and la<U+017F>t aliment of the Parts) for otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>carce any <U+017F>ufficient rea<U+017F>on can be imagined, why, when the fir<U+017F>t affected Parts are <U+017F>o extenuated, the<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould be (e<U+017F>pecially the Brain and Liver) in <U+017F>o good a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <U+017F>o ful and <U+017F>o plump. The <U+017F>ame thing is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the lively color of the <U+017F>ame parts. For if the Pul<U+017F> langui<U+017F>h in any part, <U+017F>omwhat of the fre<U+017F>h and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable color pre<U+017F>ently retireth from that Part.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Arteries called <hi>Carotides,</hi> and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulary Veyn, which belong to the Brayn, and the parts about the Head, are ob<U+017F>erved to be very broad in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els tending to the fir<U+017F>t affected parts to be unduly <U+017F>lender; from whence we may clearly infer, That the di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation of the Blood to tho<U+017F>e Parts is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal. And here we intreat and be<U+017F>eech tho<U+017F>e who have
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169706:56"/>
an opportunity to open <U+017F>uch Bodies as this affect hath de<U+017F>troyed, that they would accurately contemplate whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <U+017F>welling Arteries in<U+017F>erted into the <U+017F>welling parts of the Bones do more liberally, and more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diou<U+017F>ly tran<U+017F>mit the Blood into tho<U+017F>e, than into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther le<U+017F>s nouri<U+017F>hed parts of the Bones, and whether the Arteries of tho<U+017F>e parts are more broad than of the<U+017F>e. Although indeed we confe<U+017F>s that this enquiry is mo<U+017F>t difficult, both becau<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>lenderne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and in regard of the ob<U+017F>curity of their in<U+017F>ertion, and al<U+017F>o in re<U+017F>pect of the hardne<U+017F>s of the Bones.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Hither al<U+017F>o belong things hurtful and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for children afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> are manife<U+017F>tly benefitted by rubbings, motion, and various agitation of the Body, by exerci<U+017F>es, <U+017F>trengthning Oyntments, and the like means which rai<U+017F>e the heat in the Members on the right-<U+017F>ide, and the other parts primarily affected, and irritate the Pul<U+017F>es and augment them after any <U+017F>ort, whereby the di<U+017F>tribution of the Blood may be more neerly reduced to <U+017F>ome equality; with the contrary things they are damnified. In like manner <U+017F>uch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which promove the di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation of the Blood to the fir<U+017F>t affected parts (as tho<U+017F>e which are moderately hot, benign and familiar to Nature, and <U+017F>o attenuant, incident, and deob<U+017F>truent that at the <U+017F>ame time they do not in the lea<U+017F>t degree wa<U+017F>t but cheri<U+017F>h and augment the Spirits) help very much towards the cure of this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>; the contraries do either produce or foment it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produced. All the<U+017F>e things being con<U+017F>idered we mu<U+017F>t conclude that the de<U+017F>tribution of the Blood in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is irregular and unequal. And thus at length we have fini<U+017F>hed the di<U+017F>quification of the faults in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tribution of the Vital Blood; we now proceed to the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169706:56"/>
examination of the faults, if any <U+017F>uch there be, of the Vital participative Con<U+017F>titution in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII. The faults of the Vital participative Con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in this Affect.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have already <U+017F>aid that the Origine of the Vital Con<U+017F>titution is grounded in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious Blood, and e<U+017F>pecially in the <U+017F>piritous part thereof: but becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>olid parts al<U+017F>o do <U+017F>omwhat truly participate the nature of Life we ju<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a<U+017F>cribe unto them the Vital participative Con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now this Con<U+017F>titution con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in Three Things.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, In a certain union of the Arterious Blood with the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the <U+017F>olid parts through which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the Vital heat excited in tho<U+017F>e parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the enlivening and exaltation of the Natural Con<U+017F>titution, and of all the Natural faculties of tho<U+017F>e parts.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, As for that union of the Arterious Blood, it mu<U+017F>t be ju<U+017F>tly reputed, the fir<U+017F>t part of the participative Life. For the <U+017F>olid parts are therfore <U+017F>aid to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the Nature of Life, or the Vital Con<U+017F>titution, becau<U+017F>e the Vital Spirits are contained in them. For
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169706:57"/>
Life cannot con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t without a Vital Spirit. Therfore when the Vital Spirit is di<U+017F>tributed in and with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious Blood to the <U+017F>olid parts through the Arteries, and the<U+017F>e parts do <U+017F>uck in that Blood into their <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that the <U+017F>aid parts are couni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Vital Spirits, and <U+017F>o they participate of the Nature of Life.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Seeing this union is not permanent but tran<U+017F>ient and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in motion, it <U+017F>eemeth to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the confluence and mutual embracement of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natural and influent Vital Spirit: but the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are requi<U+017F>ite to make this a natural concour<U+017F>e, are,</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, That it be in all re<U+017F>pects, moderate, and not impetuous.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it be in all re<U+017F>pects <U+017F>trong, and not feeble and <U+017F>tupified.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it be friendly and peaceable, not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tile and Turbulent, that it be gentle not tumultuous; that it be neither too <U+017F>lippery and <U+017F>mooth, nor too rough.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That it end not in any kind of di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation of the Spirits, but rather in the appea<U+017F>ing and apt di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition of them for their return into the Veins. More <U+017F>uch conditions might perhaps be added; but becau<U+017F>e they very little belong to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, we <U+017F>hall here <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceed any further examination of them. We only note that the mutual concour<U+017F>e and union of the Vital and natural Con<U+017F>titution by their Spirits, doth not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in this affect, with that activity, vigor and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as it u<U+017F>ually doth in <U+017F>ound Bodies. And this <U+017F>carce needeth any proof, <U+017F>eeing that it is manife<U+017F>t by what hath been <U+017F>aid above, that not only the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution of the fir<U+017F>t affected Parts doth labor under a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169706:57"/>
cold and a moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper, a defect and benummedne<U+017F>s of Spirits, but that the Vital Blood it <U+017F>elf is al<U+017F>o <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what damped and <U+017F>tupified in the tops or ends of the Arteries, before it can be conveighed into the fir<U+017F>t af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected parts, <U+017F>o that that union mu<U+017F>t needs be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without either a <U+017F>ufficient vivacity, or plea<U+017F>ure. For when the vigorous Vital Spirits do meet together with the Natural Spirits no le<U+017F>s vigorous, they are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with a kind of curteous <U+017F>trife and delightful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Whether, that we may illu<U+017F>trate this matter by an example, the natural Spirits as a Bride do here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure and in a manner repel the Vital Spirits who as it were act the part of a Bridegroom: But the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits provoked with their heat, and driven on by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the Pul<U+017F>es do more confidently invade the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits and penetrate into their confines and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whil<U+017F>t the Natural Spirits in the mean time (however as it were with mode<U+017F>t re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tances repul<U+017F>ing the a<U+017F><U+017F>ault) receive them at length not without a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain plea<U+017F>ure. For the very corporal plea<U+017F>ure is e<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli<U+017F>hed upon, and encrea<U+017F>ed by a kind of amorous <U+017F>trife, and the principal part of Life it <U+017F>elf con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in <U+017F>uch a contention about the <hi>Reciprocal</hi> union of the Spirits; for to that end the Vital Spirits are both<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> generated and de<U+017F>tributed, that at length they may pa<U+017F>s through the <U+017F>olid Natural Con<U+017F>titution of the Parts, and may profoundly imbue them with their vital power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but <U+017F>eing this peneration cannot be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endeavor and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, it mu<U+017F>t needs be, that the vigor of that contention &amp; re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, be either more or le<U+017F>s according to their copiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, vivacity, and heat of tho<U+017F>e Spirits that maintain the conflict. Therefore becau<U+017F>e in this affect, both the Natural and the Vital Spirits are more cold, fewer, and le<U+017F>s active; their
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169706:58"/>
concour<U+017F> and union mu<U+017F>t needs be dull and undelight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Moreover it mu<U+017F>t be noted in this affect (which al<U+017F>o we have <U+017F>hewed above) that the permeation of the Blood thorow the fir<U+017F>t affected parts is to ea<U+017F>y and <U+017F>lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, wherupon even for this rea<U+017F>on, that concour<U+017F> and union of the Spirits in tho<U+017F>e parts is rendred more <U+017F>lothful, and le<U+017F>s plea<U+017F>ant. Be<U+017F>ides, hot exhalations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the mo<U+017F>t part they are <U+017F>paringly rai<U+017F>ed in this affect, yet being rai<U+017F>ed, by rea<U+017F>on of the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, loo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and internal lubricity of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, parts, they evaporate <U+017F>ooner then is meet, wherupon they leave tho<U+017F>e parts cold and feeble.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As for the Vital heat communicated to the <U+017F>olid parts (which is the <U+017F>econd part of the Vital parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipative Con<U+017F>titution) that partly depends upon the afore<U+017F>aid union, or the Incorporation of the Arterious Blood, with the <U+017F>olid parts; but partly it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in a certain expan<U+017F>ive motion or endeavor (like to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan<U+017F>ive endeavor of the Arterious Blood) excited in the very <U+017F>olid parts. The fir<U+017F>t is very per<U+017F>picuous, for the Arterious Blood through the impregnation of the Vital heat, when it is receaved into the <U+017F>olid parts, mu<U+017F>t needs with their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance communicate their heat al<U+017F>o unto them. The <U+017F>econd is likewi<U+017F>e proved without difficulty, For if the Vital heat radicated in the Arterious Blood con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in a certain motion or endeavor of that Blood uniformly diffu<U+017F>ed and withal at the <U+017F>ame time <U+017F>omwhat re<U+017F>trained, it mu<U+017F>t unavoydably excite the <U+017F>ame motion in the <U+017F>olid parts thorow which it pa<U+017F><U+017F>eth, <U+017F>eing that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cau<U+017F>es do always act to the extremity of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and as much as is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible by way of a<U+017F><U+017F>imilation. If any man doubt whether the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Vital heat con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in <U+017F>uch an uniform diffu<U+017F>ive motion, moderately re<U+017F>trained and intrin<U+017F>ically advancing: let him know that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169706:58"/>
the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of heat doth in general con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in motion or a rerefactive endeavor <U+017F>omwhat interrupted, as Sr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Bacon</hi> doth mo<U+017F>t clearly demon<U+017F>trate in his <hi>Novum Organum.</hi> But this I <U+017F>ay, the Vital heat, <U+017F>eing that it containeth in it <U+017F>elf the tru nature of heat, it wil be al<U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily <U+017F>uch a rarefactive endeavor <U+017F>omwhat re<U+017F>trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But that this heat may be re<U+017F>trained to the Vital; more conditions mu<U+017F>t be added, which neverthele<U+017F>s we cannot in this place either reckon up, or accuratly <U+017F>earch into, lea<U+017F>t we <U+017F>hould run into an unrea<U+017F>onable digre<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In the <hi>interim</hi> that we may have the matter, and the manner of enquiring, whether or no in this affect the Vital heat be moderated according to nature, it <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good unto us, to propound the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, That the Vital heat may be called Natural, or according to Nature, it is requi<U+017F>it that the Origin ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be Internal; Namly, in the Arterious Blood, and that it be derived to the <U+017F>olid parts, as hath been <U+017F>aid, by the implantation and union therof; for that any thing may be called, Natural, it mu<U+017F>t needs flow from an Internal Principle, although it be likewi<U+017F>e tru that what things <U+017F>oever do moderatly cheri<U+017F>h, augment, and excite that Internal Principle, may in that re<U+017F>pect de<U+017F>erve this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is required, that that heat be moderate, not unequally, remi<U+017F>s, or inten<U+017F>ive, but communicated to the parts, in an even degree.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is required, that it be in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform, and like it <U+017F>elf in tho<U+017F>e parts, that rejoyce in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>imilary con<U+017F>titution, provided, that they be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<U+017F>tant from the fountain of heat, and after the <U+017F>ame manner affected by <U+017F>ome other concurrent and adjacent cau<U+017F>es. But in the parts further di<U+017F>tant from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169706:59"/>
of heat; yet otherwi<U+017F>e, as hath been <U+017F>aid, after the <U+017F>ame manner affected, that it may be uniformly dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed: And in like manner in the colder parts in re<U+017F>pect of the inherent con<U+017F>titution, that it may be al<U+017F>o propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably more remi<U+017F>s. La<U+017F>tly, In the parts diver<U+017F>ly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by other cau<U+017F>es, <U+017F>o that one may be much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<U+017F>ively hot then another: it is requi<U+017F>ite, that between the hotter and the colder part there be found a heat gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, and as it were uniformly more remi<U+017F>s (if you proceed gently from the hotter towards the colder part.) And even a certain uniformity may be ob<U+017F>erved in this deformity or di<U+017F>parity of heat, <U+017F>o long as it continueth within the bounds of Nature. For the parts immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intermutually touching one another, are in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural capacity, or condition: If one of them be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hot in compari<U+017F>on of the other. For <U+017F>eing that this Vital heat con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in a rarefactive endeavor <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what re<U+017F>trained, if it be very unequal and di<U+017F>proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the Parts bordering upon one another, it will happen, that that part which endeavoreth with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, doth withal endeavor to <U+017F>eparate it <U+017F>elf, from that which u<U+017F>eth no <U+017F>uch vehemence, and <U+017F>o that it wil becom a preternatural endeavor, cau<U+017F>ing pain: for pain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the <U+017F>olution of continuity, not yet made, but to be made.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That this heat may not actuate or a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t the action of any other hurtful conjoyned quality what<U+017F>oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For although in this ca<U+017F>e the conjoyned hurtful quality is chiefly peccant, and meriteth the greater part of blame, yet cannot the heat be altogether excu<U+017F>ed. For an acrimonious and malignant heat, denoteth other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to be conjoyned be<U+017F>ides the bare heat, yet the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal heat it <U+017F>elf, in as much as it exa<U+017F>perateth and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the activity of tho<U+017F>e conjoyned qualities to a more
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169706:59"/>
potent depravation and annoyance, it mu<U+017F>t be judged partly culpable of their vitious actions.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, On the part of the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance moderation is al<U+017F>o required, both in re<U+017F>pect of the appea<U+017F>ing of the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated Vital Spirit, and al<U+017F>o in regard of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Arterious Blood, and finally in re<U+017F>pect of the tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the unappea<U+017F>ed exhalations.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, A certain proportion mu<U+017F>t be ob<U+017F>erved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the expan<U+017F>ive endeavor of the Vital heat, and the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance that re<U+017F>trains it, an exce<U+017F>s therefore in either of them in it <U+017F>elf is not a fault, but if one be di<U+017F>proportionate to another, in that regard it mu<U+017F>t be reputed faulty.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, A certain harmony and order is ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both in the endeavor, and in the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. For they do not always proceed in one form and continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as it were fighting, they are <U+017F>omtimes intended, <U+017F>omtimes remitted. And indeed they are chiefly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed in the <hi>Dia<U+017F>tole</hi> of the Arteries, wher the blood not being contained in his Marrow Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, <U+017F>trugleth for more room, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>tretcheth the Arteries, til a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent portion of it falleth down, into the habit of the parts, and is there dige<U+017F>ted; for then the place doth not compel the Blood into <U+017F>uch <U+017F>traights, but after a <U+017F>hort time it de<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth from that impetuo<U+017F>ity, and among the cau<U+017F>es of the pul<U+017F>ation this motion of the Blood is not the lea<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable. Now that we may apply the<U+017F>e things to the pre<U+017F>ent bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, among<U+017F>t all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions now propo<U+017F>ed, the <U+017F>econd alone <U+017F>eemeth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>tly to be de<U+017F>ired in this affect. For the Vital heat is not here moderate, but defective and more remi<U+017F>s than the ju<U+017F>t and Natural Degree. For <U+017F>eeing that the fir<U+017F>t affected parts are be<U+017F>ieged with a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

and with a penury and benummedne<U+017F>s of Spirits, they mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily (as we have already demon<U+017F>trated) <U+017F>omewhat rebate the heat of the Arterious Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is tran<U+017F>mitted into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of them; wherupon tho<U+017F>e parts participate a more remi<U+017F>s degree of Vital heat, than is due unto them. And this <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffice concerning the communication of the Vital hear to the Parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As for the la<U+017F>t part of the participative Life, which indeed dependeth upon the two former, and which is the fir<U+017F>t in the intention, though the la<U+017F>t in the execution of Nature; we <U+017F>ay, that it is in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort the end both of the Original Vital Con<U+017F>titution, and al<U+017F>o of the di<U+017F>tribution thereof, and finally of the afore<U+017F>aid union and heat communicated to the parts. For the Vital Spirits are not excited in the Arterious Blood for their own <U+017F>akes alone, neither are they di<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into the parts, and united to them, only for their own advantage; but chiefly, that they may enliven and dignifie the inherent con<U+017F>titution of the <U+017F>olid Parts, and <U+017F>o actuate and promote their faculties. For as the heat of it <U+017F>elf is only potentially vi<U+017F>ible, unle<U+017F>s it be irradiated with light, <U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e inherent faculties of attracting, retaining, concocting, <U+017F>ecreving, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, are dead as it were and meerly potential, when they are deprived of the vivification and erogation of the Vital afflux, This is mo<U+017F>t clearly con<U+017F>picuous in a lipothymy; for upon the defect of the Vital influx, all tho<U+017F>e faculties <U+017F>uddenly fail, decay, langui<U+017F>h. But <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the faculties are e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed upon <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is both the cau<U+017F>e and <U+017F>ubject of them, it might be demanded in which Con<U+017F>titution of the parts it is grounded? We an<U+017F>wer, in re<U+017F>pect of the potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Nature they are radicated in the Natural Con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169706:61"/>
which we have before de<U+017F>cribed; but that in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Actuated and Elivened E<U+017F><U+017F>ence that they depend likewi<U+017F>e upon the Vital influx. And we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in general that the participative Vital Con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we have already a<U+017F><U+017F>erted to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in Three things, conjoyned with the Natural Con<U+017F>titution, is the total and adequate, both cau<U+017F>e and <U+017F>ubject of all tho<U+017F>e faculties. But it would be a tedious degre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with our purpo<U+017F>e, to make enquiry how tho<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>titutions can produce this or that facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty determinate in its Species. For the pre<U+017F>ent we will only run over tho<U+017F>e faults of the faculties afore<U+017F>aid which occur in this affect.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, The fa<U+017F>hioning vertue here erreth by an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual purging out of the Vital Blood in divers parts, as we have di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed above. Hereupon the Head and the Liver grow to an unmea<U+017F>urable bigne<U+017F>s; the fir<U+017F>t af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected parts are extenuated, the ends of the Bones <U+017F>tick out, and <U+017F>omtimes the Bones them<U+017F>elves, which are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>traight, wax crooked.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Concoctive faculty is weak in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> and in the fir<U+017F>t affected part by rea<U+017F>on of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent cold di<U+017F>temper, the penury and benummedne<U+017F>s of the Spirits, the brittle and <U+017F>lippery union of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <U+017F>pirits with the Natural Con<U+017F>titution, and by rea<U+017F>on of the feeble imprinted Vital heat.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Attractive, Retentive, and Expul<U+017F>ive Faculties, <U+017F>eem not to recede much from their Natural Condition; yet the Attractive is <U+017F>omwhat more <U+017F>low than ought to be; the Retentive, by rea<U+017F>on of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal lubricity is <U+017F>omwhat weaker, and the Expul<U+017F>ive is more vehement for the <U+017F>ame Cau<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>And thus at length we have di<U+017F>patched the faithful examination of the faults of the Vital Con<U+017F>titution in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169706:62"/>
this affect. The Animal Con<U+017F>titution <U+017F>hould now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the next di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition, but that <U+017F>om faults of the Natural Con<U+017F>titution; namly the Organical faults ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which have <U+017F>ome dependance upon <U+017F>ome of the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faults of the Vital Con<U+017F>titution, do challenge this place, as mo<U+017F>t proper to them<U+017F>elvs.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eing that the Organical faults in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> belong to the Inherent Con<U+017F>titution of the parts, tho<U+017F> indeed by the Law of ju<U+017F>t Method <U+017F>hould be immediatly after the <U+017F>imilary vices of the <U+017F>ame Con<U+017F>titution; but as we have noted above, the Rea<U+017F>on and Cau<U+017F> of them mu<U+017F>t be derived from the faults of the Vital Con<U+017F>titution lately mentioned, and therfore we are con<U+017F>trained to premi<U+017F>e the examination of the<U+017F>e, and to re<U+017F>erv the con<U+017F>ideration of the other for another place.</p>
            <p>The Organical faults in this affect are fitly reduced to the<U+017F>e Heads.</p>

            <p>Secondly, To the unrea<U+017F>onably augmented magnitude of <U+017F>ome parts, as the Brain, the whol Head, and the Liver.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To the tumors or lanching out of certain

Bones, as of the Bones to the Wre<U+017F>ts, to the Ankles, and the ends of the ribs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To the bowing of certain Bones, as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happneth to the Bones of the Cubit, and the Shin Bone, <U+017F>omtimes to the Bone of the Thigh and Sholder.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, To the poynted figure and narrowne<U+017F>s of the brea<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>And the<U+017F>e faults are reckoned beneath among the Symptoms and <U+017F>igns of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, not becau<U+017F>e they are indeed meer Symptoms, but becau<U+017F> they are obvious to the Sen<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>o do fitly <U+017F>upply the place of <U+017F>igns, both in re<U+017F>pect of the parts of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> more deeply retired, and al<U+017F>o in re<U+017F>pect of the hidden cau<U+017F>es therof. For what<U+017F>oever is perceived by the <U+017F>en<U+017F>, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides it <U+017F>elf repre<U+017F>enteth <U+017F>omwhat el<U+017F> to the under<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is ob<U+017F>cure, hath the formality of a <U+017F>ign. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the<U+017F>e faults are parts of the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, <U+017F>eing that they are the vitious Con<U+017F>titutions of the Organs depraving the action, and have a dependance upon the other parts of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>The common cau<U+017F> almo<U+017F>t of al the<U+017F>e recited affects <U+017F>eems to be an uneven or di<U+017F>proportionate nouri<U+017F>hment or <hi>Alogotrophy</hi> of the parts. Now this dependeth chiefly upon two cau<U+017F>es in this affect. The fir<U+017F>t is, the unequal inherent Con<U+017F>titution of the parts irregularly nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The di<U+017F>parity between the inherent Con<U+017F>titutions of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, and the Head and Bowels, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <U+017F>o wel collected by what hath been already <U+017F>aid, but that it may de<U+017F>erve a further inculcation. The la<U+017F>t ca u<U+017F>, which is indeed of equal moment, is the very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal di<U+017F>tribution of the Arterious Blood into the parts unevenly nouri<U+017F>hed. That the Blood is unequally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tributed in this affect we have already <U+017F>hewed, here we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169706:63"/>
only infer that that mu<U+017F>t needs produce an unequal nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the parts. Al Creatures the more liberally they feed the more fat and fle<U+017F>hly they are unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>om o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other impediment doth intervene; but if the du quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of aliment be <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tracted, they grow lean, and are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more extenuated. Why <U+017F>hould we not <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that the <U+017F>ame thing happeneth in the Parts of Creatures? the Blood, or at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>omwhat contained in the Blood, is acknowledged for the la<U+017F>t aliment of al the parts, wher therfore that is liberally di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed to one part, and <U+017F>paringly to another, certainly, it is no wonder if one part be exce<U+017F><U+017F>ively augmented, and another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly extenuated. But the<U+017F>e things may <U+017F>uffice in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. In particular,</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, We a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, that the fir<U+017F>t affected parts in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> do dayly wax lean and fal away. Proof of this a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ertion cannot be rea<U+017F>onably expected, <U+017F>eing that dayly experience yeeldeth an occular demon<U+017F>tration of it. But why tho<U+017F>e parts are <U+017F>o extenuated, that may require <U+017F>om rea<U+017F>ons, and we offer the<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The fir<U+017F>t is deduced from the primary e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; namly, from a cold di<U+017F>temper, a penury, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity of the inherent Spirits in the parts afore<U+017F>aid, For by this means the attractive, retentive, and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive faculty, do execute their functions in tho<U+017F>e parts, unduly and ineffectually.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd is brought from the loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, and internal <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>ame parts; for hereupon the expul<U+017F>ive faculty is too much irritated, the breathing is too ea<U+017F>y and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipative, the circulation of the Blood is to <U+017F>lippery, the retentive faculty through the weaknes of it, parteth with the aliment too <U+017F>oon, and with too much facility: and this very thing almo<U+017F>t happneth here in the<U+017F>e parts, which befalleth the Guts in a <hi>Lyentery.</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:169706:63"/>
How<U+017F>oever it be, the expen<U+017F>es exceed the incoms, and by con<U+017F>equent tho<U+017F>e parts are extenuated.</p>
            <p>The third Rea<U+017F>on ari<U+017F>eth from the unequal di<U+017F>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and indeed defective in the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, of which we have already <U+017F>uperabundantly di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We affirm, that in this affect the greatne<U+017F>s of the Head, and e<U+017F>pecially of the Liver, as al<U+017F>o of the Brain is unrea<U+017F>onably increa<U+017F>ed. Somtimes the <hi>Pal<U+017F>y</hi> in the Head is conjoyned, which neverthele<U+017F>s we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e to be of a different Species, and no part of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>: although we grant, that this affect may <U+017F>omtimes give occa<U+017F>ion to the <U+017F>upervening <hi>Hydrocephalus.</hi> Moreover, we have <U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>een, the Con<U+017F>umption being <U+017F>uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced upon this affect, and long continuing al<U+017F>o, the Face, and the parts about the Head to be <U+017F>omwhat exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate before death. But this was produced by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umption, not by this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> we now treat of. But that we may give a rea<U+017F>on of that greatne<U+017F>s unmea<U+017F>urably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ed in the Parts afore<U+017F>aid. We note,</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, That the parts belonging to the Head and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t all the Bowels, do receive the Nerves from that part of the Spinal Marrow, which is included within the Skul, and therfore that the<U+017F>e parts are not nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that unhappy condition of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts. Wherfore no rea<U+017F>on doth compel us to affirm, that the<U+017F>e augmented parts are either affected with a cold di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or a penury and dulne<U+017F>s of Spirtts, or that the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, retentive, or concoctive faculties are therupon vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, and by con<U+017F>equence that tho<U+017F>e parts are totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the fir<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of that extenuation which befal<U+017F>eth the parts fir<U+017F>t affected.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we ob<U+017F>erve that neither loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, nor flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity, nor <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, nor internal <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in tho<U+017F>e immea<U+017F>urably augmented parts, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169706:64"/>
that the<U+017F>e qualities (as it happneth to the fir<U+017F>t affected parts) do not yeeld a more irritated expul<U+017F>ion then is requi<U+017F>ite, <U+017F>o that the exportation <U+017F>hould be feared to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the importation, which we have <U+017F>hewed to befal the extenuated parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ob<U+017F>erve that the Blood in his circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by how much the more <U+017F>paringly it is di<U+017F>tributed to the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, the more liberally it doth water and nouri<U+017F>h the<U+017F>e parts. This we have already proved, and it is needle<U+017F>s to in<U+017F>ert more arguments to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e. The<U+017F>e things therfore being ob<U+017F>erved, the Rea<U+017F>on is playn, why the parts afore<U+017F>aid are unmea<U+017F>urably and irregularly augmented. For if the attractive retentitive and concoctive faculties be not weakned in them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our fir<U+017F>t annotation, and the expul<U+017F>ive be not immoderately irritated according to the <U+017F>econd, and in the interim if <U+017F>ufficient aliment be di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the third, the bulk of them mu<U+017F>t needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F> beyond proportion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We affirm that the protuberancies or <U+017F>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Bones in the Wre<U+017F>ts, Ankles, and the ends of the Ribs do vitiate the Organ in a twofold re<U+017F>pect<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> namly, in re<U+017F>pect of the greatne<U+017F>s, and al<U+017F>o of the figure. The parts vitiated in both re<U+017F>pects are obvious to the Eys, and therfore we <U+017F>hal <U+017F>uper<U+017F>ede al further proof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why are the Bones <U+017F>tretched out after that manner in tho<U+017F>e places?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly it is very hard to render a Rea<U+017F>on therof, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perhaps dare we engage our <U+017F>elves by promi<U+017F>e to give <U+017F>atisfaction in all re<U+017F>pects herein to the curious. Therfore in<U+017F>tead of an an<U+017F>wer we dedicate to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent ob<U+017F>ervations as not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, The Bones in many do agree with the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169706:64"/>
of the Bowels. For fir<U+017F>t they con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of a certain <U+017F>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary matter <U+017F>evered from the preterfluent Blood, not needing any laborious a<U+017F><U+017F>imilation, and <U+017F>eem to admit a mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ie nutrition till they arrive at the exaltation and highe<U+017F>t pitch of their encrea<U+017F>e; Moreover, they <U+017F>eem to be nouri<U+017F>hed until by age they are brought to an extream drine<U+017F>s, and they <U+017F>eem not to be obnoxious to any con<U+017F>iderable extenuation; <U+017F>o the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances of the Bowels are <U+017F>imilary being joyned together by the <U+017F>epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration almo<U+017F>t of the Blood alone, and they likewi<U+017F>e ea<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encrea<U+017F>, and are difficultly and rarely extenuated. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The Bones are nouri<U+017F>hed almo<U+017F>t after the <U+017F>ame manner, as the <hi>Parenchymata</hi> or <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels: Through the Arteries they receive the blood, through the Veins they amandate and conveigh away the <U+017F>uperfluous portion of it, and in<U+017F>tead of Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the third kind whereby the excrements are expelled, they are furni<U+017F>hed with Cels and Cavities. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may doubt of the Arteries of the Bones, becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>o hard and rigid a part may <U+017F>eem unapt to admit any pul<U+017F>ation of the Arteries within it, we grant indeed that the Bones in regard of their hardne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>tifne<U+017F>s are le<U+017F>s apt for the pul<U+017F>ation of the Arteries, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we acknowledg that they admit not within them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable ramification or branching of Arteries; but if any man will from thence infer that no Arteries are admitted into them, truly herein he mu<U+017F>t expect our ab<U+017F>olute denyal, for they are living Parts, they are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed, they grow, and they exerci<U+017F>e the Attractive, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, Concoctive, and Expul<U+017F>ive faculties. Again, they receive the Blood, which they cannot do but by the conduit Pipes of the Arteries, and this is manife<U+017F>t by the bloodine<U+017F>s of them, when the Bones of Living Creatures are either broken or any other way divided.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169706:65"/>
In yong Creatures the <U+017F>pongy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Bones, and the very Marrow is <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly perfu<U+017F>ed with Blood, and the greate<U+017F>t part of their Cavities is filled more with Blood than Marrow. In elder and greater Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures you may ob<U+017F>erve both Veins and Arteries through the Membranes enwrapping the Marrow; all which things do <U+017F>ufficiently prove that the Blood is di<U+017F>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the very Bones. But wi<U+017F>e Nature (who in the conformation of all the parts doth mo<U+017F>t equi<U+017F>itely and aptly proportion all things) fore<U+017F>eeing here that the Veins and Arteries could not conveniently be extended by a longer carnification through the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Bones by rea<U+017F>on of their hardne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>teth that va<U+017F>t number of them, <U+017F>ome being as <U+017F>mal as hairs, into al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t incon<U+017F>picuous little holes in the Bones. But if you <U+017F>oundly boyl the Bones of greater Creatures the<U+017F>e Orifices of the in<U+017F>ertion of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els may very ea<U+017F>ily be perceived in the outward <U+017F>uperficies if you remove the Skin enwrapping the Bones. But let this <U+017F>uffice concerning the Veins and Arteries of the Bones, <U+017F>eing that this matter is <U+017F>omwhat incoherent with our <U+017F>cope. As for the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the third kind, <U+017F>eing that the excrements of the Bones were not about to prove al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together improfitable, nor could commodiou<U+017F>ly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled out of the Body, Nature, in<U+017F>tead of a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el of the third kind hath made certain Recepticles (namely Cavities and Cels) into which <U+017F>he would exno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rate and ca<U+017F>t a<U+017F>ide the excrements, namely that fat part which is altogether improfitable to furni<U+017F>h the Bones with nouri<U+017F>hment. There are <U+017F>ome who <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to be the principal nouri<U+017F>hment of the Bones, but very incon<U+017F>iderately, <U+017F>eing that the Marrow, as we have <U+017F>aid, is altogether unapt for the generation and nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bones, for the bones are not only mo<U+017F>t
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169706:65"/>
hard and <U+017F>olid and naturally of a white colour, but they con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of a certain earthy and clammy <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, which conditions differ very much from Marrow. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Marrow cannot by any art be <U+017F>ublimated to the firmne<U+017F>s of a Bone. Moreover, Marrow melteth, and is di<U+017F><U+017F>olved with a moderate heat of the fire; but the Bones endure the mo<U+017F>t ardent flames of fire without any melting. Be<U+017F>ides, Boil the Bones as long as you plea<U+017F>e, they re<U+017F>olve into a gelly, not into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of, or like Marrow. Again, Bones may be worn to pouder, <U+017F>o cannot Marrow. Certain therfore it is, that the marrow is not the Aliment of the Bones but a kind of excrement, or rather <U+017F>ecrement of them, profitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and therfore to be pre<U+017F>erved in tho<U+017F>e receptacles. For the Bones being otherwi<U+017F>e dry, cold, and rough, would be unapt for motion, were they not moi<U+017F>tned and made <U+017F>lippery by the exundations and exhalations of the Marrow, and cheri<U+017F>hed by their gentle heat. All the<U+017F>e things are confirmed by this <U+017F>ingle experiment. In yong Creatures the greatne<U+017F>s of the Bones being con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, there is le<U+017F>s Marrow in the Bones, and more Blood, than in greater Creatures. In the Embrion, there are <U+017F>carce ob<U+017F>erved any <U+017F>igns or appearances of Marrow de<U+017F>tinct from the Blood. But after the birth the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is daily augmented, and it is vi<U+017F>ibly perceived to be le<U+017F>s and le<U+017F>s intermingled with the Blood; again in the maturity of years the Bones are filled almo<U+017F>t with pure and <U+017F>incere Marrow, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny con<U+017F>iderable commixture of Blood; but in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of old age it is credible that the Bones are le<U+017F>s and le<U+017F>s watered with the circulation of the Blood; and perhaps the Marrow it <U+017F>elf upon the <U+017F>u<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ion and ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of the nouri<U+017F>hment is rather augmented than dimini<U+017F>hed; in which re<U+017F>pect the propounded experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169706:66"/>
mu<U+017F>t be peradventure limitted. Thirdly, the Bones (the Teeth perhaps excepted) cannot want their nervs, at lea<U+017F>t very little, neither are they <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, then by rea<U+017F>on of the <hi>Perio<U+017F>tium,</hi> or the Fibers therof fa<U+017F>tned into the Orifices of the Bones. In like manner the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances of the Bowels <U+017F>eem to obtain that dul <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, which they po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s, rather by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes and ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, then from their own <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance.</p>
            <p>From hence we collect, that the Bones in this affect are not much otherwi<U+017F>e affected, than the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Bowels in re<U+017F>pect of nouri<U+017F>hment. We have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <U+017F>hewed that the Bones are not to be reckoned among the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, as likewi<U+017F>e neither the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymata:</hi> only we here further affirm that all the Bones univer<U+017F>ally con<U+017F>idered, are not perhaps le<U+017F>s <U+017F>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly nouri<U+017F>hed in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, than they u<U+017F>ually are in <U+017F>ound Bodies, for if they be nouri<U+017F>hed by way of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augmentation, or joyning together, as the <hi>Parenchyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> are, and with <U+017F>uch facility al<U+017F>o, if they po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Veins delated unto them, and Cells, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities to receive the Blood, if they be not in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and condition of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, and if they receive not Nerves from the <U+017F>pinal Marrow; it is very credible that they do duly receive, laudably retain, and perfectly concoct their Aliment. Moreover, If you will con<U+017F>ult experience, Children afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, a regard being had to their age, and the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their parts, weigh heavier than others for the mo<U+017F>t part, as we have <U+017F>omtimes ob<U+017F>erved, which very thing <U+017F>eemeth partly to be a<U+017F>cribed to the greatne<U+017F>s of the Bones. Although in this ca<U+017F>e we wi<U+017F>h more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, certain, and accurate ob<U+017F>ervations, which others who are befriended with opportunity may oblige the world withal: in the mean time we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e in general
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169706:66"/>
that the Bones are not illiberally nouri<U+017F>hed in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some may reply,</hi> That what hath hitherto been <U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken doth concern the nouri<U+017F>hment of the Bones in general, but that they yield not a rea<U+017F>on of the protuberances in them.</p>
            <p>We deny it not, but <U+017F>eing that the<U+017F>e faults of the Bones depend upon their unequal nouri<U+017F>hment, as we have already proved, we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed it would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to purpo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>on of their nouri<U+017F>hment in general: now we draw neerer to the afore<U+017F>aid <U+017F>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Bones. And we ob<U+017F>erve, Secondly, That tho<U+017F>e tumors of the Bones are not of a different kind in re<U+017F>pect of the other parts of the <U+017F>ame Bone, but that they are parts altogether <U+017F>imilary and of the like kind with the re<U+017F>t, and that they are not faulty in re<U+017F>pect of the <U+017F>imilary Con<U+017F>titution, but in re<U+017F>pect only of their greatne<U+017F>s and figure.</p>
            <p>From hence it followeth thirdly, that the<U+017F>e <U+017F>wellings are not produced by any illegetimate matter of the Bones, or by any other vertue than the <U+017F>ame by which and from which the other are generated.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the <U+017F>aid <U+017F>wellings are produced by an unequal nouri<U+017F>hment of the Bones, as by a more liberal nouri<U+017F>hment of the <U+017F>welling parts, and a <U+017F>paring nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hment of the other parts of the <U+017F>ame Bone. And the<U+017F>e Three la<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>ervations we have already abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved where we treated of the affected parts.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We ob<U+017F>erve the <hi>Epiphy<U+017F>es</hi> of the Bones in the Wre<U+017F>ts and Ankles, and perhaps in <U+017F>ome other places, to be more <U+017F>oft and <U+017F>pongy than in the other parts of the <U+017F>ame Bones. And peradventure they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into them<U+017F>elves greater Arteries and Veins, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed we are not yet fully a<U+017F><U+017F>ured of this. The
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169706:67"/>
tops of the Ribs are al<U+017F>o much more <U+017F>oft and <U+017F>pongy than the other parts of them. From whence we infer that tho<U+017F>e more <U+017F>oft and <U+017F>pongy parts of the Bones may more ea<U+017F>ily and freely admit the circulation of the Blood, and therefore be more plentifully nouri<U+017F>hed than the re<U+017F>t of the parts of them. You will <U+017F>ay, That <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>pongine<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e parts is ob<U+017F>erved to be as well in healthful Children as in tho<U+017F>e affected with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. We grant it, but yet it mu<U+017F>t needs be, that tho<U+017F>e parts which are of a more compacted <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, and with difficulty admit the circulation of the Blood, mu<U+017F>t be affected and ob<U+017F>tructed upon lighter cau<U+017F>es, then tho<U+017F>e parts that are more open, and more ea<U+017F>ily receive it. But the Blood in this affect is tran<U+017F>mitted to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts <U+017F>omwhat more cold, vi<U+017F>cous, and thick, then it ought to be; therfore tho<U+017F>e parts which are unapt to admit the circulation of it, tho<U+017F>e are more apt to be <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ob<U+017F>tructed, and le<U+017F>s liberally nouri<U+017F>hed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>We an<U+017F>wer, Becau<U+017F>e, as in health tho<U+017F>e parts do in a larger mea<U+017F>ure receive the Blood thorow the Arteries, <U+017F>o they remit the <U+017F>ame more plentifully thorow the veins which certainly doth pre<U+017F>erve them from that exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive augmentation unto which otherwi<U+017F>e they would grow. But in this affect the <U+017F>ame parts by rea<U+017F>on of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s thickne<U+017F>s, and vi<U+017F>co<U+017F>ity of the Blood, do perhaps more <U+017F>paringly and more <U+017F>lowly remit it, then it is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in to them; and therfore from that abundance and exce<U+017F>s of the Blood, tho<U+017F>e parts do <U+017F>omwhat increa<U+017F>e; whil<U+017F>t the other parts of the Bones by rea<U+017F>on of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowne<U+017F>s of the cavity of the Artery, are not perhaps <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently nouri<U+017F>hed with Blood, wherby to obtain an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual

nutrition and increa<U+017F>. And from hence (at lea<U+017F>t probably) we deduce the inequallity of the nutrition of the Bones in this affect. But the condition of the Blood wherby in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> it is apt to ob<U+017F>truct an<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> parts tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which it floweth, <U+017F>eems to have a peculiar re<U+017F>pect to the quality of the Bones. For in the Bowels, the Lungs excepted, the Blood doth <U+017F>eldom Generate ob<U+017F>tructions, as al<U+017F>o ne ither in the fir<U+017F>t affected Parts: However it be the Bony <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, either becau<U+017F>e it is incapable of the internal <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s, or becau<U+017F>e the nutritive juice in the mas of Blood is peculiarly apt to congeal in the parts <U+017F>o vehemently fixed: or la<U+017F>tly, becau<U+017F>e it hath in its own nature <U+017F>ome affinity with the Bones: we <U+017F>ay, the Bony <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance is ea<U+017F>ily infe<U+017F>ted with ob<U+017F>tructions in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and therupon it happneth to be unequally nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Faults of breeding Teeth</hi> are likewi<U+017F>e to be referred hither, <U+017F>eing that they al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eem to depend upon this une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual nutrition of the Bones. For if the Teeth <U+017F>hould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually nouri<U+017F>hed, they would be of a uniform <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, and would not fal out by pieces, as it here frequently happneth. For the <U+017F>imilary parts, when they are equally nouri<U+017F>hed, acquire not <U+017F>uch an interrupted and unequal con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, as to be ea<U+017F>ily broken in pieces. Wherfore <U+017F>eing the Teeth are parts naturally delighting in a <U+017F>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, were they equally nouri<U+017F>hed, they <U+017F>hould enjoy an equal and uniform con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continue firm in their gums, or would fal out whol: And there can <U+017F>carce any other rea<U+017F>on be given, why they <U+017F>hould be broken and fal out more on one <U+017F>ide, or in one part then another. We grant indeed that their aptne<U+017F>s to break, may hitherto conduce very much: but we conceive that even that aptne<U+017F>s to break, doth in great part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the unequal nutrition afore<U+017F>aid. For otherwi<U+017F>e
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169706:68"/>
the Teeth do u<U+017F>ually obtain a very firm, <U+017F>olid, &amp; coherent <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance; and the truth is, they <U+017F>eem to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t e<U+017F>pecially in this vi<U+017F>cous affect of a very matter. For the Blood for the mo<U+017F>t part is ob<U+017F>erved to be more vi<U+017F>cous and thick then ordinary, <U+017F>o that this aptne<U+017F>s to break off the Teeth, cannot be <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily a<U+017F>cribed to a defect of vi<U+017F>co<U+017F>ity in the matter, as it may much more probably to the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallity of the nutrition. We conclude therfore that the <U+017F>tanding out of the Bones, and likewi<U+017F>e the faults of the Teeth, do proceed from the unequal nutrition of the<U+017F>e parts, ari<U+017F>ing from a peculiar ob<U+017F>tructive di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the Blood, having reference e<U+017F>pecially to the Bones. Now we proceed to the crookedne<U+017F>s of the Bones in this affect.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In this affect the Bones are frequently <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what crooked, e<U+017F>pecially the Shin Bones, and the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Bones of the Legs; al<U+017F>o the Bones of the Cubit, the le<U+017F><U+017F>er of the two long Bones of the Cubits, and the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Shank-Bone, <U+017F>omtimes the Bones of the Sholder and Thigh: <U+017F>om Joynts al<U+017F>o becom crooked, <U+017F>omtimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <U+017F>omtimes outwards: the whole Spine is likewi<U+017F>e many times bended, <U+017F>omtimes it is wreathed like the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>S;</hi> namly, partly forwards, partly backwards, and <U+017F>omtimes partly to the right Hand, partly to the left.</p>
            <p>Some a<U+017F>cribe <hi>this crookedne<U+017F>s of the Bones,</hi> to the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faculty of them; for <U+017F>ay they, in the tender age of Children, the Bones them<U+017F>elves are not <U+017F>o <U+017F>tiff <U+017F>tubborn, and inflexible, as in their riper years; and therfore upon the inva<U+017F>ion of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, they are rendred in <U+017F>ome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ea<U+017F>ily flexible. Therfore they rebuke the Nur<U+017F>es, which too <U+017F>oon commit the children to their Feet, <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ing, that the Bones are made crooked by the <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed burthen of their Bodies. Others al<U+017F>o tax the Nur<U+017F>es of imprudence in <U+017F>wadling them.</p>

But we cannot yeeld our ful a<U+017F><U+017F>ent in all re<U+017F>pects to the<U+017F>e Rea<U+017F>ons. And fir<U+017F>t we flatly deny, that the Bones of Children afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> are more flexible, or le<U+017F>s <U+017F>tiff and friable then the Bones of others. For we have already proved, that the Bones in this affect do not differ in re<U+017F>pect of their <U+017F>imilary <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance from the Bones of <U+017F>ound per<U+017F>ons. Be<U+017F>ides, no man hitherto wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of credit hath atte<U+017F>ted that he hath <U+017F>een the Bones flexible in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Moreover, if we <U+017F>hould grant that in this tenderne<U+017F>s of years the Bones might perhaps be <U+017F>omwhat bended, yet they would not continu <U+017F>o bent like lead or wax, but being left to their liberty they would return again to the proper po<U+017F>ition and figure of the parts. For they con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t not of any ductile matter, and therfore by being thus bent, they would either be broken or el<U+017F>e doubtle<U+017F>s they would endeavor to reobtain their former <U+017F>ituation. As for the ignorance or negligence of Nur<U+017F>es, although we do not altogether excu<U+017F>e it, yet cannot we ju<U+017F>tly impute this crookedne<U+017F>s of the Bones to their carele<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s. We <U+017F>ee the Children of Poor People are ordered and handled with le<U+017F>s care, and <U+017F>ooner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their feet then the Children of the rich, yet the Children of Poor People are more rarely afflicted with this infirmity, then the Children of the rich. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides, we have known Nur<U+017F>es u<U+017F>e all manner of diligence as <U+017F>wadling them, and every other way laboring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this incurvation, yet al their pains, otherwi<U+017F>e prai<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, hath in this re<U+017F>pect been <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>le<U+017F>s.

            <p>Now that we may accommodate the<U+017F>e things to the pre<U+017F>ent bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, if the Bones afore<U+017F>aid be more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully nouri<U+017F>hed on one <U+017F>ide, and therfore do grow out more on that then the oppo<U+017F>ite <U+017F>ide, there is a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, that that mu<U+017F>t grow crooked: For here the overplenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nutrition of that <U+017F>ide, hath the <U+017F>ame power after the <U+017F>ame manner to bow the Bones, as the interpo<U+017F>ed wedg hath to bow the Pillar, <U+017F>ave that the wedg is fa<U+017F>tned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <U+017F>ome places of the <U+017F>ide of the Pillar, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plentiful nutrition of the <U+017F>ide of the Bone, is commonly equally made, according to the whol length therof. For the aliment received into the Bone, in what part it more liberally admitteth it, that part it ob<U+017F>tructeth: and like the wedg thru<U+017F>t into the Pillar it extendeth it into an augmented length, wherupon the Bones mu<U+017F>t needs be bowed towards that <U+017F>ide which is not lengthened in an equal degree with the other. Moreover, if the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one <U+017F>ide of the Pillar happen only in one or two places therof and not in many, as in the third figure, then

We wil ad for a higher confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this matter. An ob<U+017F>ervation rai<U+017F>ed from the cure of this crookedne<U+017F>s of the Bones. The Quacks of our Country are wont to rub dayly the hollow, not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex <U+017F>ides of the Bones, and that rubbing, <U+017F>ay they, doth very much conduce to the cure, but this doth rather hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. But it is certain that rubbing doth powerfully <U+017F>ummon the nutritive juice out of the Bloody ma<U+017F>s into the part <U+017F>o rubbed, therfore if at any time you rub that hollow part which is in<U+017F>ufficiently nouri<U+017F>hed, it is no wonder if it do good, <U+017F>eing that thereby the aliment is more plentifully allured, and the heat of the part is al<U+017F>o excited and augmented; neither on the other <U+017F>ide is the

The Joynt A B is inwardly, becau<U+017F>e that part of the Shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone A, is higher than the other part of it B. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it mu<U+017F>t needs lift up the inner and lower top of the Thigh-bone, <U+017F>o that the Thigh-bone will be bent outwardly, and the Joynt inwardly.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>ame thing likewi<U+017F>e may happen in the Ankle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, and the turning Joynts of the Back, if the Bones fa<U+017F>tned to the Joynt be higher on one <U+017F>ide than on the other. But in the Ankles, becau<U+017F>e there, be<U+017F>ides the Shin-bone, the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Bone of the Leg is al<U+017F>o fa<U+017F>tned through the Joynt, it may <U+017F>o fall out, that the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Bone below may <U+017F>tand out further than the Shin-bone, and <U+017F>o bend outwardly the Joynt of the Ankle; and on the contraty, if it happen that the Shin-bone be longer than the le<U+017F><U+017F>er bone, the Joynt mu<U+017F>t needs be inwardly bent. Although we confe<U+017F>s that <U+017F>uch an inequality of length between the Shin-bone and the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Bone in the Leg doth not <U+017F>o often happen.</p>
            <p>Moreover, We <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that the preternatural ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Spine doth rarely happen from the unequal altitude of the <U+017F>ides of the turning Joynts of the Bones, but more often from another cau<U+017F>e which we will now pro<U+017F>ecute. We have already <U+017F>aid that the Spine is <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what weak in this affect, and that Children afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> are unapt not only to motion, but al<U+017F>o to <U+017F>tand upon their feet, yea, and to rai<U+017F>e their backs by rea<U+017F>on of the weakne<U+017F>s of the Spine. Therefore
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169706:72"/>
when<U+017F>oever their Bodies are rai<U+017F>ed, they <U+017F>eek <U+017F>omewhat to re<U+017F>t upon, and they <U+017F>uffer their Spine to be bowed <U+017F>ometimes forwards, <U+017F>ometimes backwards, <U+017F>ometimes to the right hand, and <U+017F>ometimes to the left; whereby the burden of their Body may be re<U+017F>ted upon <U+017F>omthing that <U+017F>tands neer them. Hereupon it many times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the Ligaments of the turning Joynts of the Spine in that part which is mo<U+017F>t commonly bending out are loo<U+017F>ned and lengthned, and on the oppo<U+017F>ite <U+017F>ide they are contracted; <U+017F>o that intract of time the Spine cannot be erected according to the <U+017F>traight and natural Figure. And truly in this ca<U+017F>e we cannot excu<U+017F>e the Nur<U+017F>es indiligence or negligence, becau<U+017F>e they do not ob<U+017F>erve with a <U+017F>ufficient attentivene<U+017F>s, to which part the Children which they <U+017F>uckle are mo<U+017F>t prone to bend their Bodies, that by that means they may endeavor to bend them to the oppo<U+017F>ite part: In like manner al<U+017F>o when Nur<U+017F>es without due regard and care do too <U+017F>oon commit weak Children to the u<U+017F>e of their feet, it may happen, that, when the regular motion of the Mu<U+017F>cles is too weak to bear the Body, Children may <U+017F>uffer either their Knee or Ankle to be bowed to one <U+017F>ide; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ligaments of the Joynt are extended either on the inner or the outward <U+017F>ide, and by con<U+017F>equence the Ligaments on the contrary <U+017F>ide are contracted, whereupon the joynt mu<U+017F>t needs be bended ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inwàrdly or outwardly, therfore although we have denied above that the crookedne<U+017F>s of the Bones depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hereupon, yet we grant that the bending of the Joynts may happen in weak Children by the negligence of the Nur<U+017F>es. We grant moreover that the Bones which would otherwi<U+017F>e have been <U+017F>traight, may be croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by an unskilful <U+017F>wadling; yet that this cau<U+017F>e doth happen exceeding rarely in this affect we are <U+017F>omewhat

            <p>We ob<U+017F>erve that this pointedne<U+017F>s and narrowne<U+017F>s of the Brea<U+017F>t doth not appear pre<U+017F>ently at the beginning of this affect, but that it <U+017F>ucceedeth upon the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and is by degrees intended, till by the per<U+017F>everence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> it becomes evident and con<U+017F>picuous, when the Brea<U+017F>t forwards re<U+017F>embleth the Brea<U+017F>t of a Hen, or the Keel of a Ship. This viciated Figure of the Brea<U+017F>t which otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould be broad according to Nature, and not <U+017F>traightned on the <U+017F>ides, and even not pointed forwards, we reduce to four cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es. The three former whereof we confe<U+017F>s do contribute little efficacy to this matter, but the fourth alone doth almo<U+017F>t al the work.

            <p>Now it mu<U+017F>t be known that the oppo<U+017F>ite couples of the Ribs do expre<U+017F>s a

certain rude kind of circular Figure, e<U+017F>pecially the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permo<U+017F>t which chiefly fa<U+017F>hion the Brea<U+017F>t, by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spine on the hinder part, and the Stern on the fore part. Nor <U+017F>hould it trouble any man, becau<U+017F>e they will not make an exact and perfect Circle, <U+017F>eing that our demon<U+017F>tration is as effectual in a circular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure how imperfect <U+017F>oever, as in the mo<U+017F>t exqui<U+017F>ite and perfect; provided that there be a coherence among all the parts, that they be not di<U+017F>torted, that they be flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but not ea<U+017F>ily exten<U+017F>ible; which conditions are <U+017F>ufficiently con<U+017F>picuous in the Figure of the Ribs even now propo<U+017F>ed to view. Therefore if in this affect the Bone of the Stern be <U+017F>omwhat elevated forwards, that it may yield room to the augmented Bulk of the Liver, the Ribs towards the Spine mu<U+017F>t needs be drawn in nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to one another, whereupon the Brea<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably be laterally <U+017F>traightned, the latitude of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing le<U+017F><U+017F>ened.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some may <U+017F>ay,</hi> If the ri<U+017F>ing of the Bone of the Stern did conduce any thing to the pointed Figure of the Brea<U+017F>t, it would chiefly effect that about the inferior Ribs, <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this elevation of the Stern doth begin at the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer part; but it is manife<U+017F>tly known to fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e; for the narrowne<U+017F>s of the Brea<U+017F>t happeneth chiefly about the Armpits, and afterwards beneath the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Bones; but the lower Ribs <U+017F>eem to be enlarged about the <U+017F>ides rather than <U+017F>traightned.</p>
            <p>We an<U+017F>wer, That the Five lower Ribs are not arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated with the Stern, neither do they make a perfect Circle; and therefore in no wi<U+017F>e do they relate to the propounded demon<U+017F>tration; but the <U+017F>tretching of them dependeth upon another cau<U+017F>, namely, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the Hypocondriacal parts. Let it likewi<U+017F>e be noted that we a<U+017F><U+017F>ign not this for the chief cau<U+017F> of the

            <p>In this affect the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> parts is almo<U+017F>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually ob<U+017F>erved to be full and <U+017F>tretched, namely both in re<U+017F>pect of the greatne<U+017F>s of the Liver, and al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F> all the other Bowels almo<U+017F>t which are contained in the bottom of the Belly are <U+017F>ufficiently large; <U+017F>eing that as hath been <U+017F>aid, the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is not rooted in them. And la<U+017F>tly, Becau<U+017F> the Guts and the Ventricle are u<U+017F>ually more or le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>tended with wind. But now from that fulne<U+017F>s and exten<U+017F>ion of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal</hi> parts we may ju<U+017F>tly collect that in this affect the Ribs are drawn downwards a little more than is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. For the greate<U+017F>t exten<U+017F>ion is here ob<U+017F>erved in the oblick Mu<U+017F>cles that are extended beneath the <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal</hi> parts; Now the Mu<U+017F>cle obliquely di<U+017F>cending hath toothed heads fa<U+017F>tned to the <U+017F>ixth, <U+017F>eventh, eighth &amp; ninth Ribs, and the part of the broad tend on al<U+017F>o ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly a<U+017F>cending is adjoyned to the grizles of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh Ribs. Wherfore <U+017F>eing that the <U+017F>aid Mu<U+017F>cles are almo<U+017F>t pertually too much extended in this affect, they mu<U+017F>t needs in <U+017F>ome manner draw the <U+017F>aid Ribs downwards, and <U+017F>eing all the Ribs are firmly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tned together by the interco<U+017F>tal Mu<U+017F>cles, it happened that in this affect al the Ribs are <U+017F>omwhat drawn down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

Let A B be the Back-Bone. CD E the Rib. F the Bone of the Stern. We <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that every one may <U+017F>ee here in the <hi>Skeleton,</hi> that the Ribs are not conjoyned with the Spine, according to the <U+017F>traight Angle, but that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle beneath the Rib is <U+017F>omwhat le<U+017F>s then the <U+017F>traight Angle: So that if the Rib be drawn a little upwards, the Articulation of it approacheth neerer to a <U+017F>traight line. We <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o, that the circulation of the Rib, whether with the Spine or with the Stern abideth firm, and doth not draw upwards (lea<U+017F>t any man <U+017F>hould er) <U+017F>ave only the middle parts of the Rib between the <U+017F>aid Articulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We <U+017F>ay, therfore on the contrary by how much the more downwards the Rib is drawn, <U+017F>o much the more acute is the Angle with the Spine, which it then maketh: Wherfore that part of the Rib furthe<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tant from the Back-Bone A BC; (namly, D in each of the Figures) as being thrown downwards, it con<U+017F>titutes a more acute Angle with the Spine, <U+017F>o is it al<U+017F>o le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>tant from the Spine then it was before, and rendreth the broadne<U+017F>s of the Brea<U+017F>t more narrow. For the <U+017F>ides of the Brea<U+017F>t were then indeed mo<U+017F>t broad, when the Ribs are mo<U+017F>t erected upon the Spine, according to a <U+017F>traight line. For that part of the Rib D wil be then furthe<U+017F>t di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant from the Back-Bone A B, as you may <U+017F>oon perceive if you compare the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd figure with the third. For in the third Figure, the Rib is expre<U+017F>t erect in a <U+017F>traight line, with the Back-Bone, and then that part of the Rib D is <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly further di<U+017F>tant from the Back-Bone A B, then it is in the fir<U+017F>t or <U+017F>econd figure, as he that wil examin them, <U+017F>hal quickly apprehend: but in the <U+017F>econd Figure, the Rib with the Spine is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to make a more acute Angle, and in proportion that part of it D (as you may perceive) is le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>tant from the Spine than the <U+017F>ame part D in the <U+017F>ame Figure, who<U+017F>e
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169706:75"/>
Angle is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be le<U+017F>s acute; and yet that is much le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>tant from the Spine, then in the<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> third Figure, who<U+017F>e Articulation is erected to a <U+017F>traight Angle. We infer therfore, that the Ribs, when they are drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, do amplify the Brea<U+017F>t <U+017F>idewi<U+017F>e, but when they are drawn downwards, then they <U+017F>traighten the Brea<U+017F>t on the <U+017F>ides.</p>
            <p>This is further confirmed in that, becau<U+017F>e at <U+017F>uch time when the Brea<U+017F>t is dilated; namly, when the breathing is rightly performed, the Ribs are drawn a little upwards by the <U+017F>trength and force of the <hi>Interco<U+017F>tal Mu<U+017F>cles;</hi> and when the expiration is performed; namly, when the Brea<U+017F>t is contracted, the <U+017F>ame Ribs are drawn back again downwards by the help of the oblique <hi>Mu<U+017F>cles</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> Any man may ob<U+017F>erve this in him<U+017F>elf or in any other man e<U+017F>pecially in great in<U+017F>pirations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations. For in a vehement in<U+017F>piration he <U+017F>hal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive at the <U+017F>ame time to be lifted upwards, and withal to enlarge the breadth of the Brea<U+017F>t; but in a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expiration he <U+017F>hal feel the Ribs as it were bowed downwards, and at the <U+017F>ame time contracted inwards. Neither of the<U+017F>e things could happen, unle<U+017F>s the po<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ribs were <U+017F>uch, as that tho<U+017F>e beneath in re<U+017F>pect of the Spine, <U+017F>hould make an acute Angle, and being more depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, <U+017F>hould make it <U+017F>o much the more acute, and by con<U+017F>equence the Brea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hould be then mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>traightned; and on the contrary being lifted upwards, they <U+017F>hould appracch neere to a <U+017F>traight Angle, with the Spine, and <U+017F>o extend the <U+017F>ides of the Brea<U+017F>t. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therfore that the Ribs in this affect ar drawn <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what downwaads, and that the Brea<U+017F>t is contracted on the <U+017F>ides, by rea<U+017F>on of the plenitude and ten<U+017F>ity of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondrical</hi> parts; although we grant as we have intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above, that this cau<U+017F>e is not <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable, that

            <p>Be this therfore the third, The Cau<U+017F> of this vitiated Figure of the Brea<U+017F>t, <hi>Is a lateral growing of the Lungs in the Pleura,</hi> in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> e<U+017F>pecially, being confirmed it is mo<U+017F>t frequently ob<U+017F>erved to happen. Doubtle<U+017F>s <U+017F>uch an adna<U+017F>cency doth re<U+017F>train and interrupt the motion of the Ribs outwardly, wherby the Brea<U+017F>t is laterally dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For if the Rib, under which this adna<U+017F>cency lieth, <U+017F>hould endeavor forcibly to remove it <U+017F>elf, from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Brea<U+017F>t, there would be danger of pulling the Lungs that grow to it, or the <hi>Pleura</hi> it <U+017F>elf from the ribs with intollerable pain. For although the Lungs upon the ingre<U+017F>s of the ayr admit an ea<U+017F>y exten<U+017F>ion, according to al the parts therof, yet when they fal down, or are <U+017F>tuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with thick humors (which mo<U+017F>t frequently happneth in this ca<U+017F>e) they <U+017F>carce admit any notable di<U+017F>tention, without di<U+017F><U+017F>olving the unity either of <U+017F>om Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, or the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Bowels them<U+017F>elvs. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, whil<U+017F>t we con<U+017F>ider that in <U+017F>ound bodies the Lungs are very rarely laterally divided from the <hi>Pleura;</hi> and but in tho<U+017F>e parts only of the che<U+017F>t, which were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed to motion at a con<U+017F>iderable di<U+017F>tance; namely, the Back, the Stern, the <hi>Media<U+017F>tinum</hi> (that is the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes that divide the middle of the Belly) and perhaps the middle parts of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> &amp;c. We conceive that wi<U+017F>e nature did this deliberatly and with de<U+017F>ign; namly, lea<U+017F>t their connexions <U+017F>hould either offend the dilitations of the Brea<U+017F>t, or render the Lungs them<U+017F>elvs obnoxious to tho<U+017F>e kind of calamities. However it be, it is <U+017F>carce conceivable, but that preternatural growing together of the Lungs, with the <hi>Pleura</hi> more or le<U+017F>s mu<U+017F>t hinder and retard the free <U+017F>preading of the Ribs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <U+017F>ides, and therfore it conduceth a little at lea<U+017F>t to occa<U+017F>ion the narrowne<U+017F>s of the Brea<U+017F>t.</p>

Be this the fourth, The cau<U+017F> of the vitiated Figure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<U+017F>aid, is an unequal nutrition of certain parts of the Ribs in re<U+017F>pect of others. And this cau<U+017F>e we affirm to be much more effectual then the re<U+017F>t, to procure this Symptom. Which that we may demon<U+017F>trate, we a<U+017F><U+017F>ert fir<U+017F>t, that the <U+017F>even uppermo<U+017F>t Ribs do chiefly, if not <U+017F>olely, con<U+017F>titute this Figure of the Brea<U+017F>t for the five lowermo<U+017F>t, as they are not immediatly conjoyned with the Stern; So neither can they in any manner point, or elevate the Stern. Ad al<U+017F>o, that <U+017F>eing (as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <U+017F>hewed) they do not clo<U+017F>e in perfect Circles, their Figure is ea<U+017F>ily movable, that it may more or le<U+017F>s yeeld to the fulne<U+017F>s of the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> parts. But the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upper Ribs are Articulated by their Grizles, with the Bones of the Stern: from whence it may perhaps com to pa<U+017F>s, that they do <U+017F>omwhat lift up foreright tho<U+017F> bones of the Stern, which they do touch, when the five lower Ribs being deprived of the contact of the Stern, cannot effect it. Secondly, We a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, that all the Ribs, and not only the five lowermo<U+017F>t, but al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>even uppermo<U+017F>t do admit an equal nutrition in this affect, and that they are more nouri<U+017F>hed in one part then in another, &amp; therfore that they are more extended in length by that, then by the other, which is more <U+017F>paringly nouri<U+017F>hed: and indeed that they grow more on that <U+017F>ide in which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the Gri<U+017F>tles of the Stern, and that they are le<U+017F>s and more <U+017F>lowly lengthened on the other part, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Head or top, wherby they are fa<U+017F>tned to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Back. The Rea<U+017F>on is, becau<U+017F> the forepart of any Rib is more <U+017F>oft and <U+017F>pongy, then the hinder part of it, as any man may make tryal in any Creature. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therfore (as it is clear by what hath been <U+017F>aid) that the <U+017F>ofter parts of the Bones do in this affect more ea<U+017F>ily receive their aliment and augmentation, then the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169706:77"/>
and more <U+017F>olid, it followeth that the foremo<U+017F>t parts of the Ribs which are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>oft, are more lengthened than the undermo<U+017F>t. Thirdly, We a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, that in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Circular or Anulary Figure, if one part of the Ring be more lengthened than another, the other parts mu<U+017F>t needs give place to this increa<U+017F>, or el<U+017F>e that part <U+017F>o unequally lengthened, wil either outwardly hang out, or be inwardly knotted, either upwards or downwards, and be bent either one, or many of the<U+017F>e ways. This we thus demon<U+017F>trate. Let the Circle or Ring be A

But the other parts of it; namly, C D E to remain in their po<U+017F>ition, and not at al to yeeld to the <U+017F>aid lengthning. The<U+017F>e things being <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, the leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened portion of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, namely, A B mu<U+017F>t needs be either lifted up out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed inwards, either bent upwards or downwards or variou<U+017F>ly: For otherwi<U+017F>e the di<U+017F>tance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the limits of the <U+017F>tring F would not <U+017F>uffice to contain that portion of the Circle now lengthened, the figure of the Bow being changed. For tho<U+017F>e limits did only <U+017F>uffice before; therfore the Bow being lengthened, and not the <U+017F>tring, or the tops and limits of the <U+017F>tring, it cannot be, that the Bow <U+017F>hould be to the <U+017F>tring as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It mu<U+017F>t be changed therfore, the bending being made either outwards or inwards, or upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or many of the<U+017F>e ways, as may be perceived by the Figures following.

Be<U+017F>ides, we have <U+017F>uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed that the parts of the Circle do remain firm: that al<U+017F>o in this affect may be accommodated to the lateral and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermo<U+017F>t parts of the ribs For <U+017F>eing the<U+017F>e grow much le<U+017F>s then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t, certainly, they may wel be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be <U+017F>table, unle<U+017F>s, perhaps <U+017F>om may <U+017F>ay, that either the <U+017F>ides and hinder parts of the Ribs, by dilating them<U+017F>elvs, or their Joynts, with which they are fa<U+017F>tned with the turning Joynts of the Back, by <U+017F>uffering the Ribs to be bended backwards, do yeeld
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169706:78"/>
<U+017F>omwhat to that exceeding augmentation. But neither of the<U+017F>e can be rightly <U+017F>aid. For fir<U+017F>t, the latter and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parts of any Rib as they are more hard and <U+017F>olid, <U+017F>o are they likewi<U+017F>e more <U+017F>tiff and <U+017F>trong then the formo<U+017F>t; now it is ab<U+017F>urd to imagine that the weaker parts of the <U+017F>ame Rib can bend the <U+017F>tronger, or that the le<U+017F>s flexible parts will yeeld to tho<U+017F>e parts which are ea<U+017F>ily flexible. Wherfore the lateral and hinder parts of the ribs cannot be <U+017F>o bent, as that they <U+017F>hould yeeld to the formo<U+017F>t leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened parts therof. As for the Joynts of the Ribs, doubtle<U+017F><U+017F>e that Joynt, wherwith the Rib is conjoyned with the turning Joynt of the Brea<U+017F>t, can by no means <U+017F>uffer the Rib to be bent <U+017F>o much backward, as that it <U+017F>hould yeeld to the lengthning therof; and that not only becau<U+017F>e it is double; namly, in the hollowne<U+017F>s of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Joynt, and in the tran<U+017F>ver<U+017F>al proce<U+017F>s therof: and therfore very unapt to permit a backward motion. But chiefly, becau<U+017F>e it is even ten times <U+017F>tronger than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t Joynt, wherwith the <U+017F>ame rib is fa<U+017F>tened to the Bone of the Stern. Now a Joynt ten times <U+017F>tronger, and withal double, and in <U+017F>uch a manner formed double that it is altogether unapt to endure any retrograde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot by any means be imagined to yeeld back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, lea<U+017F>t the Joynt ten times weaker <U+017F>hould be bent <U+017F>omwhat forwards. We mu<U+017F>t conclude therfore, that the lateral and hinder parts of the Ribs do not yeeld to that unequal production of them, which happneth forwards, and by con<U+017F>equence, that in this re<U+017F>pect they are to be accounted firm; and therfore that unequal lengthning, mu<U+017F>t needs change the figure of them, on the forepart; and that by bending them there either upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or inwards or outwards, or diver<U+017F>e ways.</p>
            <p>This bending of the Ribs here cannot be made either upwards or downwards, becau<U+017F>e the Ribs in regard of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169706:78"/>
their latitude are unapt to be bowed either way. Ad al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e that they are firmly re<U+017F>trained by the Interco<U+017F>tal Mu<U+017F>cles in their po<U+017F>ition; <U+017F>o that without offers of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the<U+017F>e Mu<U+017F>cles, they can <U+017F>carce be bent, either upwards or downwards.</p>
            <p>That that elongation cannot, or indeed very <U+017F>carcely can bow the Rib inwards may thus be proved; becau<U+017F>e, the greatne<U+017F>s of the Liver is repugnant to <U+017F>uch a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For we have proved before, that the greatne<U+017F>s of that Bowel doth <U+017F>omwhat lift up the Bone of the Stern outwardly or forwardly. Then the very figure of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Rib doth evidently contradict the inward making of any plication, or bending. La<U+017F>tly, becau<U+017F>e that elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation doth not many ways bend the Ribs, it may from thence al<U+017F>o be inferred, that <U+017F>uch a bending would infer a compound Figure, and <U+017F>hould nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily contain <U+017F>om of the <U+017F>imple figures before rejected.</p>
            <p>Wherfore we conclude, that that unequal length of the Ribs on the forepart, mu<U+017F>t needs change their outward Figure, elevating the Bone of the Stern, and then point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forwards the Figures of the Brea<U+017F>t (otherwi<U+017F>e al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t even.) The following Scheams do lively expre<U+017F>s the manner of it.</p>

Let A be the Bone of the Stern, B the turning Joynts of the Back. C and D the two oppo<U+017F>ite Ribs, which as we have <U+017F>aid do make a kind of Ring. Therfore if the forepart of the Ribs; namly, between C and A and between D and A be lengthned, and yet the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween C B and D B are no way an<U+017F>werable to this elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the figure of the Ring mu<U+017F>t needs be outwardly changed. Therfore <U+017F>eing that the Rib is, (as we have already <U+017F>hewed) unapt to be bent either upwards or downwards, or inwards, it mu<U+017F>t needs be outwardly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, as it is expre<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>econd Figure, wher the <U+017F>tern A by rea<U+017F>on of the elongation of the part of the Rib CA and D A is repre<U+017F>ented, as if it were outwardly pointed, which is the very vitiated Figure of the Brea<U+017F>t in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>

For the Ju<U+017F>t Latitude of the brea<U+017F>t doth chiefly depend upon a du augmentation of tho<U+017F>e parts of the Ribs. For if tho<U+017F>e parts of the Ribs do grow to a ju<U+017F>t length, they mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily dilate the Brea<U+017F>t unto the Ribs almo<U+017F>t in a ju<U+017F>t proportion, that little of the narrowne<U+017F>s only being taken away, which the former cau<U+017F>es alone were able to introduce. For by how much the more tho<U+017F>e parts of the Ribs are lengthened, by <U+017F>o much the more al<U+017F>o the Lateral part of the Rib D and the part C wil be di<U+017F>tant from the Back-Bone B, and wil make the Brea<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much the broader. On the contrary when upon the increa<U+017F> of the other parts of the Body, tho<U+017F>e parts of the Ribs are but little, or not at al augmented, they mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity be laterally le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>tant from the center of the Brea<U+017F>t then is meet, and therfore the Brea<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169706:80"/>
be <U+017F>traightned towards the <U+017F>ides. For the <U+017F>ides of the rib C and D are <U+017F>o much the le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>tant from the Back-Bone, and the center of the Brea<U+017F>t, as the parts of the Ribs between C B and D B are le<U+017F>s lengthned. And let the<U+017F>e things <U+017F>uffice to have been <U+017F>poken concerning the narrowne<U+017F>s and acumination of the Brea<U+017F>t in this affect: With which we put at la<U+017F>t an end to this di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition of the Organical vices occurring in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>

Now by the due motion of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits they under<U+017F>tand the excur<U+017F>ion of them from the Brain thorow the Nerves like lightning, and again their recour<U+017F>e back to the Brain, whereby they declare unto it what is perceived by the Organs of the outward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>Others (as we have <U+017F>aid) do otherwi<U+017F>e explicate this matter. They grant indeed that the Animal con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth include the generation and de<U+017F>tribution of the Animal Spirits but they <U+017F>ay that that <U+017F>wift motion of the Flux and Reflux of the Animal Spirits like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is inconceivable in the Nerves, and if it be not unprofitable, yet certainly it is very little nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h the animal faculty. But in<U+017F>tead of this they <U+017F>ub<U+017F>titute in time of waking a certain contractive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of a moving endeavor of the very <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Brain, of the Spinal Marrow, of the Nerves ari<U+017F>ing from thence, and of the parts into which they are de<U+017F>tributed. And this motion or endeavor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth (<U+017F>ay they) a certain Ten<U+017F>ity in the afore<U+017F>aid parts, by who<U+017F>e force all the alterations imprinted in tho<U+017F>e parts by any objects, are communicated to the Brain. For as in a Harp when the <U+017F>trings are <U+017F>tretched to a ju<U+017F>t pitch, if they be <U+017F>tricken in the mo<U+017F>t gentle manner at either end, that motion in a moment, at
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169706:81"/>
lea<U+017F>t a Phy<U+017F>ical one, runneth to the other end; <U+017F>o they likewi<U+017F>e affirm that any Nerve being moved which is duly <U+017F>tretched without the Skull, that motion is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Brain it <U+017F>elf by rea<U+017F>on of the continuity and Ten<U+017F>ity of the <U+017F>aid parts, and there fixeth a certain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion conformable to the cau<U+017F> thereof. But in time of <U+017F>leep they <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the Brain, the Spinal marrow, and <U+017F>ome of the Nerves to be <U+017F>omwhat loo<U+017F>ned. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they <U+017F>ay perpetually and <U+017F>imply that the foremo<U+017F>t connexions of the Spinal Marrow with the Brain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main loo<U+017F> continually during <U+017F>leep; but they grant that the hindermo<U+017F>t connexions with the <hi>Cerebethi</hi> are <U+017F>omwhat extended, as in Night-walkers, and <U+017F>o by that means they do in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort di<U+017F>cern outward objects, but they judg not of them by common <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, but as it were reflected from the memory to the Fanta<U+017F>ie. Neither do they <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that all the inferior parts of the Spinal Marrow, and therfore the Nerves from thence proceeding <U+017F>hould be perpetually loo<U+017F>ned during <U+017F>leep: <U+017F>eeing that mo<U+017F>t Birds <U+017F>leep <U+017F>tanding upon their feet; <U+017F>eing that re<U+017F>piration in time of <U+017F>leep doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the Ten<U+017F>ity of <U+017F>ome Nerves; and la<U+017F>tly, <U+017F>eing where <U+017F>leep fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>teals in, the uppermo<U+017F>t Nerves are wholly loo<U+017F>ned before the neathermo<U+017F>t. As for Dreams they conceive that they proceed from a various and chanceable agitation and commixture of divers impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions trea<U+017F>ured up in the memory, which are now again fre<U+017F>hly perceived by rea<U+017F>on of a retained Ten<U+017F>ity in <U+017F>om parts of the Brain. But when in deep and profound <U+017F>leeps no dreams are repre<U+017F>ented, then they <U+017F>ay that the whol Brain is loo<U+017F>ned.</p>
            <p>Now whether the former opinion or this latter be mo<U+017F>t agreeable to truth, for the pre<U+017F>ent we do not much care; Neither do we here undertake to determine this
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169706:81"/>
Controver<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>eing that the Animal faculty doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e his function both waies, from the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>es, and that the <U+017F>econdary vice doth happen by this affect in the Animal Con<U+017F>titution almo<U+017F>t after the <U+017F>ame manner. For fir<U+017F>t, as for the generation of the Animal Spirits, whether the former or the latter opinion be true, it wil be all one; becau<U+017F> we find no fault in the Brain (unle<U+017F>s perhaps <U+017F>ome other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be conjoyned) wherin each opinion <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>eth the Animal Spirits to be generated. For we have <U+017F>hewed above that the Head ought not to be numbred among the fir<U+017F>t affected Parts, and that the internal and proper actions therof are not viciated in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Then <U+017F>econdly, As for the de<U+017F>tribution of the Animal Spirits, whether it be perfected backwards and forwards by that rapid and <U+017F>udden motion like lightning, or by a motion only made forwards and that too gentle and <U+017F>low, commonly the <U+017F>ame fault occurreth in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>For fir<U+017F>t, Seing that that <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed rapid motion of the Animal Spirits is cau<U+017F>ed by their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age into the fir<U+017F>t affected Parts, namely, through the Spinal Martow without the Skul, through the Nerves from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and through the parts into which tho<U+017F>e Nervs are de<U+017F>tributed; and <U+017F>eing that all the<U+017F>e parts in this affect do labor with a cold di<U+017F>temper, with a paucity and dulne<U+017F>s of inherent Spirits, the due <U+017F>wiftne<U+017F>s of that motion mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>omwhat retarded. For a cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper, as al<U+017F>o a benummedne<U+017F>s and penury of Spirits are repugnant to any motion, excepting a con<U+017F>trictive; <U+017F>ome may <U+017F>ay that the opinion propounded in the fir<U+017F>t place doth <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e a wonderful activity and <U+017F>ubtilty of the Animal Spirits, wherby they can ea<U+017F>ily overcome this repugnance. But, however it may be, <U+017F>eing that the parts react through which the Spirits have their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169706:82"/>
and labor to communicate their coldne<U+017F>s and dulne<U+017F>s to them, they mu<U+017F>t needs in <U+017F>ome degree retard that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Spirits, le<U+017F><U+017F>en their <U+017F>ubtilty, and <U+017F>omwhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept that expedite tran<U+017F>ition. Wherfore this opinion being <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed as true, the Animal Con<U+017F>titution will be viciated in this affect, in regard of the retundation of that motion of the Spirits. And that <U+017F>econdarily, <U+017F>eing that this motion is not interrupted by the primary fault of the Animal Spirits, but by the fault of the fir<U+017F>t affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Parts, as hath been <U+017F>aid in like manner in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion la<U+017F>t propo<U+017F>ed, wherin the motion of the Spirits is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be peaceable and gentle, they mu<U+017F>t needs whil<U+017F>t they are <U+017F>omwhat <U+017F>lowly tran<U+017F>mitted through the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, contract <U+017F>ome vicio<U+017F>ity from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved inherent Con<U+017F>titution of tho<U+017F>e parts, for the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>ons which we alleaged in the Que<U+017F>tion imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly preceding. It will be therfore according to this Opinion al<U+017F>o, a Secondary vice in the de<U+017F>tribution of the Animal Spirits,</p>
            <p>Again, As for the Ten<U+017F>ity of the very <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Brain, of the Spinal Marrow of the Nerves and the Nervous parts in time of waking, which is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed in the latter Opinion before propounded, there mu<U+017F>t needs be <U+017F>ome defect of a due Ten<U+017F>ity in the Spinal Marrow without the Skull, in the Nerves ari<U+017F>ing from thence, and in the parts unto which they are de<U+017F>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For fir<U+017F>t, A cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper is repugnant and adver<U+017F> to that due Ten<U+017F>itiy, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o is that dulne<U+017F>s and penury of inherent Spirits; wherwith the Parts are without controver<U+017F>ie rendred <U+017F>lothful, and le<U+017F>s apt to perform the Animal Actions; the contrary wherof hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, when the afore<U+017F>aid parts obtain their due Ten<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Secondly, It is manife<U+017F>t by what hath been <U+017F>aid, that the Tone of the<U+017F>e parts is <U+017F>omwhat viciated in this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169706:82"/>
affect, by rea<U+017F>on of their exceeding loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s, <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, weakne<U+017F>s and internal lubricity, which qualities do mo<U+017F>t evidently enfeeble the ju<U+017F>t Ten<U+017F>ity of the <U+017F>aid Parts. Although therfore that the Brain in this affect do for his part yield a due and ju<U+017F>t influx, yet it is <U+017F>carce po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, nay it is altogether impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that it <U+017F>hould communicate that Ten<U+017F>ity in a <U+017F>ufficient degree to to the Spinal Marrow without the Skull, to the Nerves from thence proceeding &amp;c. becau<U+017F>e of the di<U+017F>temper, benummedne<U+017F>s and penury of the inherent Spirirs. Thirdly, The Symptoms in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> that relate to the Animal faculty do mo<U+017F>t clearly confirm the <U+017F>ame thing. For Children afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> do from the very beginning therof (if they be compared with others of the <U+017F>ame age) move and exerci<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves very weakly, and are le<U+017F>s delighted in manly <U+017F>ports: but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the progre<U+017F>s of the affect, they are aver<U+017F> from any vehement motion, as they <U+017F>tand upon their feet, they reel, wave, and <U+017F>tagger, <U+017F>eeking after <U+017F>omwhat to <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, and can <U+017F>carce go upright; neither take they plea<U+017F>ure in any play unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>itting or lying along, or when they are carried in their Nur<U+017F>es Arms: Finally the weak Spine is <U+017F>carce <U+017F>trong enough to bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Head, the Body being <U+017F>o extreamly extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and pined away. All which things do abundantly demon<U+017F>trate that the Ten<U+017F>ity of the parts <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient to motion is le<U+017F>s rigid in this affect than is ju<U+017F>tly requi<U+017F>ite in time of waking. If therfore that due Ten<U+017F>ity in time of waking be a part of the Animal Con<U+017F>titution, which we here <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, that being viciated mu<U+017F>t with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily con<U+017F>titute a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Con<U+017F>titution; and <U+017F>eing that this fault hath no primary dependance upon the Brain it <U+017F>elf, but upon the inherent Con<U+017F>titution of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169706:83"/>
ought in all Rea<U+017F>on to be reputed a Secondary fault in re<U+017F>pect of the Animal Con<U+017F>titution.</p>
            <p>Yet here we meet with a <U+017F>cruple. Som may demand, <hi>Why the <U+017F>en<U+017F> as well as the faculty of motion is not viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in this affect?</hi> The rea<U+017F>on is plain, a far greater ten<U+017F>ity, <U+017F>trength and vigor of the Nervs is required to exerci<U+017F>e the motive then the <U+017F>en<U+017F>itive faculty. For almo<U+017F>t the gentle<U+017F>t motion of the Nervs is <U+017F>ufficient for <U+017F>en<U+017F>e; but not for motion. So you may ob<U+017F>erve in the motion of any Joynt, that the Mu<U+017F>cles which move it are very hard and <U+017F>tiff, but that hardne<U+017F>s being remitted, yet the <U+017F>en<U+017F>ation is ea<U+017F>ily performed. Nor doth that any way hinder, becau<U+017F>e that <U+017F>omtimes in the Pal<U+017F>y the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e is <U+017F>omwhat <U+017F>tupified, and the motion remaineth: for the Pal<U+017F>y is an affect very different from this; for in that the primary fault re<U+017F>ides in the very Animal Con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therfore it may <U+017F>o fal out, that both the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e and the motion may be equally affected. Be<U+017F>ides, when perhaps one Nerve doth want the du influx of the Brain, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is extended to the mu<U+017F>cles of that part doth enjoy it, it may be, that for this cau<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e may be aboli<U+017F>hed, and yet the motion may continu; although this ca<U+017F>e is not <U+017F>o frequent, and that the motion is more u<U+017F>ually taken away, the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e remaining. But we have <U+017F>aid enough concerning this matter. And thus at length we have produced tho<U+017F>e things which we have meditated of the integral E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, both primary and <U+017F>econdary of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; and that with as much per<U+017F>picuity as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <U+017F>o difficult and un<U+017F>earcht into, would bear: In the next place we <U+017F>hal addre<U+017F>s our <U+017F>elvs to the examination of the cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have largely explained above both the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. And indeed we have <U+017F>ufficiently demon<U+017F>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <U+017F>ame place, the dependance of the <U+017F>econdary upon the Primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence. It may not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be here expected, that we <U+017F>hould again purpo<U+017F>ely and in particular di<U+017F>cu<U+017F>s the cau<U+017F>es of the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence, which we have handled before. It may <U+017F>uffice that we have found out the cau<U+017F>es of the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence. Yet if any cau<U+017F>e do occur which at once<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> hath an influx as wel into the primary or <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>, we <U+017F>hal not refu<U+017F>e to take notice of it, by the way as we proceed.</p>
            <p>But omitting al diligent <U+017F>earch into the <U+017F>everal kinds of cau<U+017F>es, we purpo<U+017F>e to contract this our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to two heads. The former containeth the Infirmities and the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions of the Parents, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have <U+017F>o great an influence upon the Children, that they <U+017F>uppeditate, at lea<U+017F>t a prone<U+017F>s to this affect, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an aptitude to fal into it, if they have not actually fallen into it from their very birth. The latter compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the acce<U+017F><U+017F>ary cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; namly, tho<U+017F>e which happen to children after their birth.</p>
            <p>Concerning the cau<U+017F>es of the fir<U+017F>t kind we meet with a Que<U+017F>tion at the fir<U+017F>t entrance: <hi>How and whether this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may be <U+017F>aid to be hereditary?</hi> That we may the more <U+017F>uccesfully proceed in the determination of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169706:84"/>
this que<U+017F>tion, an hereditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> mu<U+017F>t be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into that properly, and that improperly <U+017F>o called. And indeed an hereditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> properly <U+017F>o called, is ever <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be preexi<U+017F>tent in both or one of the Parents, and from thence to be derived to the Progeny. But an hereditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> improperly <U+017F>o called, is not <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be preexi<U+017F>tent in the <U+017F>ame kind, either in both or one of the Parents; yet the <U+017F>ame fault mu<U+017F>t always nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily precede (perhaps altogether of a different kind) at lea<U+017F>t in one of them, by vertu wherof a certain di<U+017F>po<U+017F>edne<U+017F>s is imprinted in the children, wherby they are made obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to fal into this improperly hereditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Moreover, An hereditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> properly <U+017F>o called, is twofold; either in the conformation, as when a lame Per<U+017F>on begets a lame; a deaf Father, a deaf Son, or a blind a blind; or in the <U+017F>imilary Con<U+017F>titution: as when a Gowty Father begets a Gowty Child. It is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in the fir<U+017F>t kind, ther is an hereditary fault in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the fir<U+017F>t affected parts of the Conformation. But in the latter, there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> of the <U+017F>ame kind with the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> of the Parents, <U+017F>hould be actually inherent in the <hi>Embryon,</hi> from the fir<U+017F>t forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition imprinted by one or both of the Parents is <U+017F>ufficient, which as the life is lengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned may be actuated into the <U+017F>ame, by the concour<U+017F> of other intervening cau<U+017F>es. Again, an hereditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> improperly <U+017F>o called, may be likewi<U+017F>e twofold; namely, either in the Conformation, or in the <U+017F>imilary Con<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. In the formation, as when neither of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is blind, pore-blind, lame, &amp;c. yet have begotten a Son blind, pore-blind, or lame, by the very fault of the formation. For in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es, that very fault which is <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and con<U+017F>picuous in the I<U+017F><U+017F>u, flowed from <U+017F>om fault in the Parents, although perhaps of a different
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169706:84"/>
kind, and <U+017F>o it may be called, though improperly an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. In like manner in the <U+017F>imilary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution of the I<U+017F><U+017F>u, there may re<U+017F>ide an hereditary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F> improperly <U+017F>o called, as when a Melancholy, <U+017F>eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, or an intemperate Parent, begetteth a Child <U+017F>ubject to the gowt, or the <hi>Cachexia,</hi> although perhaps the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent was never troubled either with the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e things being thus premi<U+017F>ed, we approach neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the re<U+017F>olving of the Que<U+017F>tion. And fir<U+017F>t, we affirm that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is not comprehended under the former <U+017F>pecies of an hereditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, properly <U+017F>o called. For that con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the formation: but this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, is a <U+017F>imilary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, as we have before demon<U+017F>trated, and very rarely bewrayeth it <U+017F>elf from the very Birth, much le<U+017F>s from the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and formation. And for the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>ons, we al<U+017F>o affirm this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> belongeth not to the former kind of herditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es improperly <U+017F>o called. Which after a like manner con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the formation of the parts, and are begun pre<U+017F>ently after the fir<U+017F>t formation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We <U+017F>ay, that <U+017F>o it may com to pa<U+017F>s, that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may fall under the <U+017F>econd <U+017F>pecies ptopounded, of an hereditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e properly <U+017F>o called; namely, that which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the <U+017F>imilary Con<U+017F>titution. Yet we cannot affirm this as certain and undubitable, becau<U+017F> the Children which we have hitherto known to be afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, have not lived to <U+017F>uch maturity of years as to beget Children: and therefore we cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, then by probable conjecture, whether or no their progeny <U+017F>hould be infected with this affect, as it were by right of inheritance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We <U+017F>ay, that in many Children this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth directly fal under the <U+017F>econd <U+017F>pecies of an heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169706:85"/>
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> improperly <U+017F>o called. For according to the primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of it is a <U+017F>imilary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and although it hath not yet been <U+017F>o long and <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>covered unto us, that we can determin the effects of it, how they wil operate in the Progeny, yet frequently in the pre<U+017F>ent progeny we have ob<U+017F>erved certain Rudiments of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to have been derived to many from one or both of the Parents. So that although neither of the Parents were in their infancy or child-hood afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, yet <U+017F>om prone<U+017F>s and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>edne<U+017F>s to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> hath pre<U+017F>ently appeared in their little Infants, e<U+017F>pecially in tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e Parents before coition were predi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed by <U+017F>om vitio<U+017F>ity of body, or error of life, to tran<U+017F>mit this pollution to their I<U+017F><U+017F>u; but tho<U+017F>e defilements of the Parents which di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e them to propagate Children ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to this affect, we <U+017F>hal by and by reckon up, in their order; from whence al<U+017F>o a higher confirmation of this a<U+017F><U+017F>ertion may be deduced.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We <U+017F>ay, although the affects of the Parents do frequently imprint a certain propen<U+017F>ion in the I<U+017F><U+017F>ue, to fal into this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, <U+017F>o that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reputed in the <U+017F>econd acception of an hereditary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>, improperly <U+017F>o called; yet it very rarely happneth that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth actually break out before the birth of the child. One among<U+017F>t us atte<U+017F>teth, that once, and only but once, he <U+017F>aw a Child new born invaded with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. And in this Child the Back-bone, and the neck were <U+017F>o weak, that they could not <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the weight and greatne<U+017F>s of the Head, within three months after it was born, the Child dyed. Wherby it is apparent that he was grievou<U+017F>ly affected. It <U+017F>eemeth con<U+017F>picuous by what hath been <U+017F>aid, that Infants, however they may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently borrow from their Parents a di<U+017F>po<U+017F>edne<U+017F>s to this affect, are mo<U+017F>t rarely and <U+017F>eldom troubled with it
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169706:85"/>
before they are born, but if at any time they are <U+017F>o pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely afflicted, that then the affect is mo<U+017F>t vehement and grievous. Now a rea<U+017F>on of the event of both the<U+017F>e may be demanded. To the former therefore we <U+017F>ay, that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth partly con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in a cold di<U+017F>temper of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, and indeed an unequal one, as namly, being very cold in the <U+017F>aid parts, re<U+017F>pect being had to the temper of the Head, and the Bowels: and that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that unequal coldne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e parts, is of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and that al<U+017F>o in re<U+017F>pect of the very inequallity. For this contributeth much to that unequal and deficient di<U+017F>tribution of the Vital Blood to the parts fir<U+017F>t affected. Seing therfore at <U+017F>uch time when the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryon</hi> is carried in the womb, this inequallity of the temperament of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts may be much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and averted by an equal heat, wherby the womb may on every <U+017F>ide embrace, and cheri<U+017F>h the body of the <hi>Embryon,</hi> it followeth that the ge<U+017F>tation doth very much drive away this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, at lea<U+017F>t retard the inva<U+017F>ion of it. For the body of the Womb being all about equally war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with an even heat, and equally embracing and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hing al the parts of the <hi>Embryon,</hi> doth not ea<U+017F>ily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit one part to wax colder then the re<U+017F>t, and by that means to be cheri<U+017F>hed with a defective and <U+017F>paring afflux of the Vital Blood. Wherfore <U+017F>eing that that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equallity of heat and comfort, are E<U+017F><U+017F>ential parts of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and without which this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> cannot con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, it is no wonder that the womb <U+017F>trongly re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting the<U+017F>e parts of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and the inva<U+017F>ion therof, doth for the mo<U+017F>t part protract it, at lea<U+017F>t during the impregnation.</p>
            <p>As for the latter part of the que<U+017F>tion propounded, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Why Infants, who before their birth were infe<U+017F>ted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, are more grievou<U+017F>ly and dangerou<U+017F>ly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted?</hi> We <U+017F>ay, according to that <hi>Aphori<U+017F>m</hi> of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:169706:86"/>
that a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> which holdeth the lea<U+017F>t congruity with the condition of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed, is more dangerous then the contrary; as a Feaver threatneth more danger to an old man, than to a yong, and in the winter, then the <U+017F>ummer. For a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> that hath <U+017F>om corre<U+017F>pondence &amp; conformity with the condition of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a <U+017F>lighter cau<U+017F> for its introduction: but that which is contrary therunto argueth the magnitude of the cau<U+017F>, which notwith<U+017F>tanding re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and oppo<U+017F>ition, will produce his effects. In the pre<U+017F>ent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> therfore if the equal and impartial heat of the womb cannot re<U+017F>train the propen<U+017F>ity of the <hi>Embryon</hi> to this affect, but it wil fal into it, <U+017F>om vehement cau<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t needs be imprinted by the Parents, and the <U+017F>eminal Principals extreamly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Therfore there is little hope when the <hi>Embryon</hi> laboring with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is born, neither wil a prudent Phy<U+017F>itian attempt the cure without <U+017F>om Progno<U+017F>tick of imminent danger. Moreover, in<U+017F>tead of a <hi>Corallary,</hi> we <U+017F>ub<U+017F>titute another Rule, having <U+017F>om affinity with the former, although perhaps it be not yet certain and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; namly, that Children by how much the <U+017F>ooner after their birth they are invaded with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, <U+017F>o much the more difficulty <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it. And let the<U+017F>e things <U+017F>uffice concerning the Que<U+017F>tion propounded.</p>
            <p>We wil now apply our <U+017F>elvs to the divi<U+017F>ion and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up of tho<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es which on the Parents parts may produce this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Som of the<U+017F>e faults in the Parents relate to the Generation of the <U+017F>eed, wherof the <hi>Embry</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth, others have reference to the <hi>Embryon</hi> now conceived, and yet born about in the Womb. The faults of the Generation of the <U+017F>eed proceed either from the man or the woman, or from the whole Body, or from tho<U+017F>e parts onely which are dedicated
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169706:86"/>
by nature to Generation. The faults of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents depending upon the whole Body have the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t influence into the Child, becau<U+017F>e it tran<U+017F>mitteth <U+017F>uch matter to the Generation of the Seed, as is unapt for tho<U+017F>e parts dedicated to that office. We purpo<U+017F>e not here to particularize the <U+017F>everal faults of the matter of the Seed, but to in<U+017F>tance in tho<U+017F>e alone, which con<U+017F>pire to entitle the Progeny to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. The<U+017F>e we reduce to four Cla<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>The fir<U+017F>t Cla<U+017F><U+017F>is containeth a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the matter, wherof the Seed is Generated. This chiefly re<U+017F>ulteth from a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper of the Parents, unto which we al<U+017F>o refer a predominancy of il juice, e<U+017F>pecially that which is <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> and wateri<U+017F>h al<U+017F>o a <hi>Cachexia,</hi> and <hi>Drop<U+017F>y,</hi> and perhaps the Green-Sickne<U+017F>s, which <U+017F>om cal the white Feaver, not <U+017F>ufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>ubdued before conception; al which affects manife<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help to con<U+017F>titute a wateri<U+017F>h matter, both cold and moi<U+017F>t in the Genital Parts, which is not only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral le<U+017F>s apt for the Generation of the Seed, but it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly inclineth to a condition of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; a part of who<U+017F>e primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in that very cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper, as we have already proved. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we may perhaps hither reduce the Scurvy, the <hi>French Pox,</hi> &amp; the Jaundice, in which affects the Blood al<U+017F>o is polluted with filthy excrementitious humors, and corrupt exulcerations, which cannot ea<U+017F>ily be changed into laudable and fruitful Seed.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd Cla<U+017F><U+017F>is containeth containeth the penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Natural Spirits, wherby the good Seed <U+017F>hould be Generated. For a Spirituous Seed cannot flow from <U+017F>uch a kind of matter. The cau<U+017F>es which <U+017F>uppeditate that impure matter to the Parts of Generation are the dried and extenuated Bodies of the Parents, wa<U+017F>ted either by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169706:87"/>
long ab<U+017F>tinence, or by <U+017F>om vehement evacuation, as by vomits, lasks, Lienteries, Dy<U+017F>enteries, Hepatical Flur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of long continuance; by an exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive <hi>Hemorrhage</hi> from any part, by violent <U+017F>weatings, or any Chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, which wa<U+017F>teth the <U+017F>trength and is not repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before Coition e<U+017F>pecially, a Con<U+017F>umption, a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Feaver, an indige<U+017F>tion from any kind of Cau<U+017F>. La<U+017F>tly, from a defective and imperfect Concoction of the la<U+017F>t aliment, or the fault of any part. For in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es the matter which is <U+017F>eparated to the parts <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Generation, is de<U+017F>titute of a competent plenty of Natural Spirits, wherupon the Parts preparing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting the Seed cannot perfectly correct this defect, and ejaculate <U+017F>uch Seed as is <U+017F>ufficiently abounding with Spirits. Seing therfore that a con<U+017F>iderable part of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the paucity of Natural Spirits, it cannot otherwi<U+017F>e be, but that the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue propagated by <U+017F>uch a crude and almo<U+017F>t Spiritle<U+017F>s Seed, <U+017F>hould be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a certain Natural Propen<U+017F>ion to this affect, even in their fir<U+017F>t rudiments, which afterwards upon the concurrence or other cau<U+017F>es, is ea<U+017F>ily deduced into Act.</p>
            <p>The third Cla<U+017F><U+017F>is containeth the benummedne<U+017F>s or <U+017F>tupour of the matter tran<U+017F>mitted to the Generative Parts, wherof the Seed is produced. For not only the <U+017F>olid parts, but al<U+017F>o the whol Ma<U+017F>s of Blood, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors therin contained are obnoxious to that <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour. And from hence it is that Phy<U+017F>itians being to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cau<U+017F>es of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, do u<U+017F>e to <U+017F>ay, that the humors and al<U+017F>o the Blood are too fluid and moveable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly vehement; <U+017F>omtimes on the contrary that they are unapt for motion, le<U+017F>s fluxible, and unactive beneath a Mediocrity, &amp; in re<U+017F>pect of this thing al<U+017F>o a certain Mene is mo<U+017F>t whol<U+017F>om: but more things relating hither may be <U+017F>een above. We will here only pro<U+017F>ecute tho<U+017F>e faults
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169706:87"/>
of the Parents from whence this defect of vigor and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity in the matter of the Seed doth ari<U+017F>e. The<U+017F>e therfore are fir<U+017F>t the fo<U+017F>t, loo<U+017F>, and effeminate Con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either or both the Parents, indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to <U+017F>trong and Ma<U+017F>culine exerci<U+017F>es. Secondly, an overmoi<U+017F>t and full diet and epicuri<U+017F>on, obnoxious to frequent crudities. Thirdly, A delicate kind of life abandoned to ea<U+017F> and voluptuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>lothful, and rarely accu<U+017F>tomed to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, danger, and care. Hither you may al<U+017F>o refer a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal defect of manly Exerci<U+017F>e immoderate <U+017F>leep, e<U+017F>pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>oon after mate, and any kind of <U+017F>leepings what<U+017F>oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a <U+017F>edentary, <U+017F>peculative life, intent upon <U+017F>oft and queint Arts and Sciences, as Poetry, Mu<U+017F>ick, and the like, to the<U+017F>e may be further added a dayly frequenting of Comedies and other Plays, an a<U+017F><U+017F>iduous reading of Fables, and Romances, and in<U+017F>tead of manly and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Recreations, a loo<U+017F> expence of time in Carding and Dicing. Hither al<U+017F>o belong the neverfailing fruits of a la<U+017F>ting peace and plenty, <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>ecurity, indiligence and the like. All the<U+017F>e enumerated faults do manife<U+017F>tly contribute a <U+017F>hare to introduce a lazine<U+017F>s and Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natene<U+017F>s in the parts. Seing therfore that the Blood, together with the humors contained in it, doth in its circulation wa<U+017F>h all tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>tupified parts, it cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi<U+017F>e be, but that as it glideth along it mu<U+017F>t partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch alteration; and <U+017F>eing that <U+017F>ome porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tran<U+017F>ient Blood affected with this <U+017F>tupefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is tran<U+017F>mitted to the Generative Parts, with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter wherof the Seed is Generated, it is ea<U+017F>ie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that that Child which <U+017F>pringeth from <U+017F>uch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals mu<U+017F>t inwardly contract at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome propen<U+017F>ion conformable to the <U+017F>luggi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>tupour of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive matter, and that that propen<U+017F>ion, after-Birth when the pre<U+017F>ervation is taken away by the equal cheri<U+017F>hings
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169706:88"/>
of the Womb, is by divers cau<U+017F>es without difficulty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into act, wherfore <U+017F>eing that <U+017F>uch a dulne<U+017F>s is a part of the Primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, it followeth that in <U+017F>uch vitiated principals there lurketh a propen<U+017F>ity to this affect, derived from one or both of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Cla<U+017F><U+017F>is containeth the vicious Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (if any <U+017F>uch occur) of the Parents, who in their Childhood were infected with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For the<U+017F>e would tran<U+017F>mit into the Children a continuation of an hereditary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> properly <U+017F>o called. But becau<U+017F>e, as we have <U+017F>aid, it is not yet manife<U+017F>t whether the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in their infancy <U+017F>hall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get children therewith affected; be<U+017F>ides, becau<U+017F> the faults of the Parents may be conveniently referred to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of the<U+017F>e Cla<U+017F><U+017F>es afore<U+017F>aid, or to many, or indeed to all of them, it will be fruitle<U+017F>s to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t longer upon them. Therfore having reckoned up the faults of the Parents which depend upon the whol Body, in the next place we proceed to their faults which peculiarly re<U+017F>ide in the Genital Parts.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e faults are <U+017F>omtimes a cold di<U+017F>temper, <U+017F>omtimes a moi<U+017F>t, when by rea<U+017F>on of too much humidity they are loo<U+017F>ned or weakned, wherupon they ejaculate either an unfruitful deed or <U+017F>uch as is propen<U+017F>e to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, <U+017F>omtimes tho<U+017F>e parts are infe<U+017F>ted with a virulent, vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or wateri<U+017F>h <hi>Gonorrhea,</hi> and they excern a Seed not <U+017F>ufficiently elaborated; the <U+017F>ame mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>aid of the white and red Fluxes of Women. Again, <U+017F>ome things outwardly applied to tho<U+017F>e parts have reference hither; as Ointments of Hemlock and other <hi>Narcotical</hi> things, e<U+017F>pecially if they be often anointed with them, in like manner Oyntments that are incorporated with white or red Lead, Chalk of Lead, Litharge, Sugar of Saturn
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169706:88"/>
and the like, dayly and for a long time adhibited to tho<U+017F>e parts. For <U+017F>uch as the<U+017F>e blunt the activity of the inherent Spirits in tho<U+017F>e Parts, and introduce a certain dulne<U+017F>s in them, which being communicated to the Seed prepared in them di<U+017F>po<U+017F>eth the progeny to this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>At length we have fini<U+017F>hed our intended enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if not of all, yet at lea<U+017F>t of all the mo<U+017F>t principal cau<U+017F>es which happen before Conception about the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the prolificative Seed, and have any concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to produce this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, or to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therof. Now follow the faults and errors of the Mother in the time <U+017F>he beareth the Embryon in her Womb, which al<U+017F>o mu<U+017F>t be reputed among the cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> before the Birth.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, There hapneth a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper of the Womb it <U+017F>elf, which (as were we <U+017F>ilent is ea<U+017F>ily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t to every one) may mo<U+017F>t readily be communicated to the Embryon by the perpetual contact of the Womb.</p>
            <p>In the Second place, All tho<U+017F>e things offer them<U+017F>elves which <U+017F>uppeditate to the Embryon crude and impure Juyces converted by excrementions and corrupt humors in<U+017F>tead of laudable aliment. Hitherto principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the unwhol<U+017F>om and prepo<U+017F>terous diet of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, e<U+017F>pecially inclining to moi<U+017F>ture, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s and the heaping together of crudities. The <U+017F>ame things al<U+017F>o happen by the imperfection and defect of the fir<U+017F>t or <U+017F>econd Concoction, e<U+017F>pecially when they are not excerned by vomit or <U+017F>ome other evacuation of the Crudities from thence proceeding, but are at length tran<U+017F>mitted with the Mothers Blood for the aliment of the Embryon. Be<U+017F>ides, if a moi<U+017F>t and cold Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, as a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper with the matter, an ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<U+017F>tion,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169706:89"/>
a <hi>Cachexia</hi> or Drop<U+017F>y, &amp;c. do invade a woman with Child after Conception, it may thereupon ea<U+017F>ily happen, that the impure aliment al<U+017F>o, which nouri<U+017F>heth and cheri<U+017F>heth the Seeds of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, be di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ed to the <hi>Embryon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place are to be reckoned al tho<U+017F>e things that defraud the <hi>Embryon</hi> of du aliment, as any exce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ive evacuation, e<U+017F>pecially a la<U+017F>hing flux of Blood in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part; al<U+017F>o a ra<U+017F>h opening of a Vein, or <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> that exceeds in quantity. The <U+017F>uckling of another child may al<U+017F>o divert the afflux of <U+017F>ufficient aliment from the Womb towards the Brea<U+017F>ts. Hitherto likewi<U+017F>e belongeth inordinate fa<U+017F>ting, or any indige<U+017F>tion in the Mother, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inappetency after meat, or defect of concoction. Moreover, <hi>an acute Feaver hapning to a woman with Child,</hi> be<U+017F>ides other inconveniences, may al<U+017F>o defraud the Child of du aliment; <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o an Hectick Feaver. All the<U+017F>e things do not only infer to the <hi>Embryon,</hi> a dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Vital Spirits, and a defective nouri<U+017F>hment, but al<U+017F>o they cau<U+017F>e a want of natural Spirits. For the Naturall Spirits are wa<U+017F>ted and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated without due nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are al<U+017F>o de<U+017F>titute and di<U+017F>appointed of nece<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reparation. Seing therfore that a part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the defect of Natural Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <U+017F>om di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to this affect mu<U+017F>t need be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to the off-<U+017F>pring from the cau<U+017F>es afore<U+017F>aid.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have noted in the precedent Chapter, that Infants from their fir<U+017F>t Origin are <U+017F>eldom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, but by rea<U+017F>on of the Cau<U+017F>es there rehear<U+017F>ed, that they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently affected with a natural di<U+017F>po<U+017F>edne<U+017F>s, and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion to the <U+017F>ame. We <U+017F>hal now pro<U+017F>ecute tho<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es which are apt to actuate that Natural di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition after the birth, or newly and fully to produce this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For it mu<U+017F>t be known that the <U+017F>ame cau<U+017F>es which may actuat that predi<U+017F>po<U+017F>edne<U+017F>s to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, may produce this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F> a new, if they be <U+017F>ufficiently inten<U+017F>ive in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. And therfore we confe<U+017F>s that tho<U+017F>e children which are prone to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> from their Nativity are ea<U+017F>ily affected; but that other which are free from al Natural corruption fall not into the <U+017F>ame but upon more potent cau<U+017F>es; and yet tho<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es are the <U+017F>ame for their kind and differ only in the degree. We therfore thought it needle<U+017F>s to <U+017F>peak of the<U+017F>e things di<U+017F>tinctly and apart: it
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169706:90"/>
may <U+017F>uffice that we have <U+017F>poken of them inde<U+017F>criminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and together.</p>
            <p>At the very entrance a Que<U+017F>tion there is which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunes a Re<U+017F>olution; namely, Whether Contagion may be numbred among the cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and therfore whether this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in a proper and right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding be a contagious Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, indeed he that con<U+017F>idereth this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> unknown to the Ancients, how it fir<U+017F>t invaded the We<U+017F>tern Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and in few years hath been <U+017F>ince di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ed all <hi>England</hi> over, will at the fir<U+017F>t thought ea<U+017F>ily judg it to be contagious, and to have been <U+017F>pread <U+017F>o far and wide by the infection of it. But the matter will <U+017F>eem to be otherwi<U+017F>e to him that will con<U+017F>ider it more intentively, For although this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may in <U+017F>ome manner endeavor to imprint an affection like unto it <U+017F>elf in other Bodies, yet it <U+017F>carce advanceth <U+017F>o far that it can totally produce a Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F> of the <U+017F>ame kind. For perhaps it may in one <U+017F>ome <U+017F>light inclination in another Body, yea, <U+017F>omtimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may accelerate or ha<U+017F>ten the inva<U+017F>ion of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in a Body highly predi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed unto it, yet it cannot therfore de<U+017F>erve the Name of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> properly conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. For all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es con<U+017F>pire to change and a<U+017F><U+017F>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late tho<U+017F>e Bodies which are neere<U+017F>t to them<U+017F>elves, yet that is not <U+017F>ufficient to denominate Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For to con<U+017F>titute a contagious Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> properly <U+017F>o called it is further required that out of it <U+017F>elf it propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a certain Seminal fermentation of it <U+017F>elf, which <U+017F>ecretly in<U+017F>inuating it <U+017F>elf into other Bodies, may by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees introduce into tho<U+017F>e Bodies a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> of the <U+017F>ame Species. But this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> containeth no <U+017F>uch fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its e<U+017F><U+017F>ence, neither is it <U+017F>ecretly propagated by a precedent emi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Seed from it <U+017F>elf which may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> of the <U+017F>ame Species in the adjacent Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169706:90"/>
For we have already often <U+017F>aid, That the fir<U+017F>t e<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>temper, and in a dulne<U+017F>s and paucity of inherent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which affections if they endeavor to a<U+017F><U+017F>imilate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bodies that are neer them, they attempt and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it by open violence, and not by <U+017F>nares and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or a preimmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ecret little fires. In like manner if you reflect upon the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither the viciated Tone, nor the depraved Vital nor Animal Function, nor the Organical faults are found apt and fit in this affect to in<U+017F>inuate them<U+017F>elves into other Bodies, and to propagate their own Species. Finally, if we will con<U+017F>ult experience, the matter will quickly be vindicated from all doubt. For we frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ob<U+017F>erve Children either of the <U+017F>ame age, or very neer to the <U+017F>ame age, be brought up in the <U+017F>ame Hou<U+017F>e, wherof one or other of them is perhaps afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, whil<U+017F>t a third or many among<U+017F>t them do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cape it. Yea, We have known Children not only edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated under one common Roof, and delighting in the continual and mutual <U+017F>ociety of one another, but day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting at one Board and lying together in one Bed; wherof one who hath been ill affected with this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F> hath not infected any of his companions either by feeding or lying together. Which could <U+017F>carce po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly happen in a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> properly contagious. Wherfore Contagion being excluded from the Catalogue of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, we will addre<U+017F>s our <U+017F>elves to the finding out of <U+017F>uch as are more true and unque<U+017F>tionable. We divide the cau<U+017F>es which produce this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> after Birth into two Cla<U+017F><U+017F>es. The fir<U+017F>t containeth the errors which procure it in the u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ix nonnatural things. The latter comprehendeth the precedent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of divers kinds, which are wont very often to leave behind
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169706:91"/>
them <U+017F>ome Inclination to this affect.</p>
            <p>As for the former Cla<U+017F><U+017F>is concerning the abu<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ix non-Natural things, <U+017F>o far as they relate to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>, <U+017F>eing that children are <U+017F>eldom di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>ed with any vehement pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the mind, and can thereupon very difficultly fal into this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Again, in regard that the u<U+017F>e of Venery appertaineth not unto them; we wil reduce and limit the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es to the five <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent heads. To the Air, al<U+017F>o to what things <U+017F>oever extrin<U+017F>ecally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, or are applyed to the body, to meat and drink, and <U+017F>uch things as are inwardly received, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and re<U+017F>t, to the kind and manner of life, to actions and exerci<U+017F>e, to <U+017F>leep and watching; la<U+017F>tly, tho<U+017F>e things which are preternaturally retained in, or <U+017F>evered from the body.

               <head>Of the Air and <U+017F>uch things, as happen outwardly.</head>
               <p>A cold and moi<U+017F>t Air doth powerfully contribute to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For <U+017F>eing that it doth more ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>teal into the external and fir<U+017F>t affected parts in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, then into the hidden and fenced bowels, it directly helpeth to imprint in tho<U+017F>e parts that unequal; namely, that cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper. The con<U+017F>titution of this kind of Air, is chiefly predominant about the beginning of the Spring, at which time the Nur<U+017F>es ought to be cautious and circum<U+017F>pect. How they too confidently expo<U+017F>e their children, which are <U+017F>ubject to this affect, to the injuries of the Air; as al<U+017F>o when the Air is cloudy, thick, rainy, and ful of vaporous exhalations. Hereupon places neer the Sea, great Mari<U+017F>hes that are obnoxious to much rain and <U+017F>howers, and fed with a great number of Springs, are wont to be <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> very fruitful of this affect.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169706:94"/>
Alteration, they may be reduced to an agreeable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature. However it be, there is a great affinity between the Humors vitiated by Alteration, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious Humors which are retained. For there are <U+017F>o many and <U+017F>uch various ways of ca<U+017F>ting out in the Body, that <U+017F>carce any humor can be imaginably produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Alteration, which doth not properly relate to the <U+017F>ecretive and excretive faculty of <U+017F>ome Bowel, or <U+017F>ome other partt and is de<U+017F>tinated to be <U+017F>evered and evacuated from it; and therefore though the errors of the fir<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction are <U+017F>carce corrected in the <U+017F>econd or third, by Alteration, yet they may be mended by local motion, or excretion, made from <U+017F>ome part of the Body, the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable parts being <U+017F>eparated and rejected. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the ma<U+017F>s of blood being any ways preternaturally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or infected with <U+017F>ome Humor, the peccant matter which cannot be otherwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ubdued by Alteration, is quickly exterminated perhaps by excre<U+017F><U+017F>ion made from <U+017F>ome part or Bowel (unle<U+017F>s withal the <U+017F>ecretive or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul<U+017F>ive faculty thereof be hindred) therefore it mu<U+017F>t needs be of great moment for a Phy<U+017F>itian to know what Humors are particularly predominant in any Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and by what determinate ways they may be mo<U+017F>t properly <U+017F>pied out according to the intent and purpo<U+017F>e of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>For there are as many <U+017F>ubordinate <U+017F>pecies of things <U+017F>pied out, as there are di<U+017F>tinct <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances of the Bowels and other parts de<U+017F>tinated to that office in the Body. For it is credible that the Liver doth ca<U+017F>t out one thing, the Kidnies another, the Sweet-Bread another, the Spleen another, the Stomach and Guts another, the Lungs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the Brain another, the Stones, the Matrix, the Kidnies, the Kernel under the Canel Bone, the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous parts of the <hi>Larynxes,</hi> the Throat and Jaws another,

the <U+017F>carf Skin and the Skin another. For it <U+017F>eemeth <U+017F>carce admittable, that Nature <U+017F>hould build and prepare for her <U+017F>elf Organs of different kinds, and yet <U+017F>hould make u<U+017F>e of divers of them for the performance of one and the <U+017F>ame action. Therfore when the excretion of any of the <U+017F>aid parts hapneth to be re<U+017F>trained, a certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar filth will flow out from thence into the ma<U+017F>s of Blood, and <U+017F>o there wil be <U+017F>o many differences of things preternaturally retained, as there are kinds of parts in<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to particular ca<U+017F>ting out: and in like manner there wil be as many kinds of vitious excretion, either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F>s, defect or depravation, as there are divers wais tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which the excretion may be made.</p>
               <p>If any man demand, Whether the <U+017F>everal kinds of things excerned be <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>covered and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood by us: We an<U+017F>wer, that an exact knowledg is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired of that particular humor which is to be ca<U+017F>t out thorow the new Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el of the Sweet-Bread, then in the next place, what is ca<U+017F>t out by the Kidnies, the Kernel under the Canel Bone, and the glandulous parts of the <hi>Larynx:</hi> yea, perhaps it is yet <U+017F>care <U+017F>ufficiently known, what is rejected by the Spleen. For this cau<U+017F>e therefore among<U+017F>t others, it <U+017F>eemed good unto us to <U+017F>uper<U+017F>ede in this place any high and accurate di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition of things <U+017F>ecerned and retained, either in relation to the parts and ways whereunto they belong, or in order to the pre<U+017F>ent affect, and rather to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t on that fourfold divi<U+017F>ion of Humors made by <hi>Galen;</hi> namely, into Choler, Phlegm, Blood, Melancholy, adding only undue tran<U+017F>piration and <U+017F>weating. For although we may doubt, whether this divi<U+017F>ion can deduce the humors to the <U+017F>ubordinate Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, (as we have noted above) more then four parts di<U+017F>tinct in the <U+017F>pecies are evidently dedicated to the ca<U+017F>ting out of the humors; yet <U+017F>eing that this divi<U+017F>ion

of the Humors is not only approved by al Cla<U+017F><U+017F>ical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itians, but that it is likewi<U+017F>e profitable in it <U+017F>elf, and at lea<U+017F>t reduceth the Humors to certain Heads or Kinds, (however perhaps every kind may comprehend under it <U+017F>everal <U+017F>pecies) we are re<U+017F>olved for the pre<U+017F>ent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon it, and <U+017F>o much the rather, becau<U+017F>e under a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notion it very fitly conjoyneth and containeth both things altered and preternaturally contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and al<U+017F>o things to be <U+017F>pied out which are not yet excerned, and in that re<U+017F>pect it will ea<U+017F> our burden and contract our work. For whil<U+017F>t we make our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in this manner, it will be needle<U+017F>s to in<U+017F>titute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other peculiar Chapter of the Cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, namely of this altered which are preternaturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, <U+017F>eing that they are comprehended, as we have <U+017F>aid, under this Title.</p>
               <p>We reduce therfore the internal Cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F> (whether they be excrementitious humors retained, or viciated by alteration) either to Choller, or to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, or to Elegm and a Wateri<U+017F>h humor, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Tran<U+017F>piration and <U+017F>weating, for the Blood proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>o called is in this affect <U+017F>carce ob<U+017F>erved to be faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169706:96"/>
Therfore although there be not an univer<U+017F>al redundancy of the Blood in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, yet in re<U+017F>pect of the particular Plenitude of the Head it <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>uch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular emptine<U+017F>s, is perhaps profitably in<U+017F>tituted tho<U+017F>e outward and <U+017F>mal Veins of the Ears being cut. You may reply that we by this An<U+017F>wer do indeed decline the univer<U+017F>al <hi>Plethora,</hi> but that we grant a particular one of the Head, which ought no le<U+017F>s to be e<U+017F>teemed a cau<U+017F> of <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, We an<U+017F>wer, That we have at large explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this fault of the Blood, when we di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of the unequal di<U+017F>tribution of it, unto which place it properly belongeth, <U+017F>eing that it is a cau<U+017F> of the Secondary, not of the Primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; and therfore a vain and <U+017F>uperfluous repetition therof ought not in this place to be expected, We will now therfore proceed to our purpo<U+017F>ed di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition of the Humors, and likewi<U+017F>e the Tran<U+017F>piration afore<U+017F>aid.</p>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169706:96"/>
to con<U+017F>ume and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate the Natural Spirits, it may not unju<U+017F>tly be numbred among the cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For every one knows that Per<U+017F>ons of a Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick Con<U+017F>titution are lean, and of an extenuated ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit becau<U+017F> of the Rea<U+017F>ons afore<U+017F>aid. Secondly, A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly humor (whether you under<U+017F>tand the Earthy Portion of the Blood, or that <U+017F>alti<U+017F>h or tartar like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter excreted in and with the Urin, and when the Urin groweth cold, incorporating into little Sands; or that <U+017F>owr humor powred into the Ventricle perhaps by the Spleen (though not through that <U+017F>hort Veiny Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, as the Ancients beleeved) or tho<U+017F>e terrene Parts of the a<U+017F><U+017F>umed Aliment, which are evacuated by <U+017F>iege with the other Excrements) under<U+017F>tand either or any of them, if this humor aboundeth and be not purged out after a due manner, may be blamed as a cau<U+017F> of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For fir<U+017F>t, that humor which is the more Earthy part of the Blood, if it exceed a ju<U+017F>t proportion in the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood, it rendreth it unapt to nouri<U+017F>h the Parts, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tho<U+017F>e that are fir<U+017F>t affected; for the fir<U+017F>t affected parts are of a more noble texture than the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tances of the Bowels, or the bony parts; and therfore we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted how the <hi>Parenchymata</hi> of the Bowels and the Bones do ea<U+017F>ily admit nutrition, and by a way like unto dige<U+017F>tion; but tho<U+017F>e former parts do require a far more exqui<U+017F>ite <U+017F>ecretion &amp; elaborated a<U+017F><U+017F>imilation. And this is the Rea<U+017F>on that the fle<U+017F>hy parts of the Bowels are rightly imputed among the impure and gro<U+017F><U+017F>er aliments, namely, Becau<U+017F> they are nouri<U+017F>hed with a cour<U+017F> Blood, and not accurately elaborated before the Union. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Any great accumulation of Salti<U+017F>h, and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar like matter is an Enemy to Nutrition, and is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther di<U+017F><U+017F>ipative and devouring than favoring augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Thirdly, The <U+017F>owr Humor of the Ventricle is
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169706:97"/>
totally ravenous, and as it were hunger<U+017F>tarved, and perhaps where it aboundeth it ea<U+017F>ily communicateth to the Blood <U+017F>uch another Depredatory quality; Fourthly and la<U+017F>tly, The Terrene Dregs of the Belly may if they be inordinately retained, taint and infect the Chylus, and render it unapt for the nouri<U+017F>hment of the part. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally we grant, that every propounded kind of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly <U+017F>uperfluou<U+017F>ly coagumented or preternaturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, doth not primarily, properly, and directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the production of this evil; but neverthele<U+017F>s we are of opinion that indirectly, and after rhe manner propounded it may contribute <U+017F>omthing to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Flegm (whether it be taken for the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter and colder part of the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood, or for the wheyi<U+017F>h part therof, or for the <U+017F>low humor of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Guts, or for the Spettle, or for the Snot of the No<U+017F>trils or Jaws, or for that peculiar humor, which perhaps the new Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el of the Sweet-Bread doth u<U+017F>e to evacuate) however you take it, if it be retained or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the Body, it hath a direct reference to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and properly de<U+017F>erveth to be called the cau<U+017F> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For this humor is cold, mo<U+017F>t, <U+017F>low, thick, benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, little <U+017F>piritous, lo<U+017F>t, and affected with an internal <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s; all which things do exactly comply with the primary and <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> as they have been propounded. Wherfore upon a <U+017F>uperfluous accumulation of this humor, <U+017F>eing that there <U+017F>ucceedeth a con<U+017F>piracy to the production of this affect, it ought ju<U+017F>tly to be e<U+017F>teemed a proper cau<U+017F> and a Primary Agent.</p>
               <p>Be<U+017F>ides the<U+017F>e humors undue Tran<U+017F>piration, as al<U+017F>o immoderate or defective <U+017F>weating may be <U+017F>omtimes numbred among the cau<U+017F>es of this affect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:169706:97"/>
For exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive Sweating, as al<U+017F>o immoderate Tran<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, doth di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate the Spirits, and withal di<U+017F><U+017F>olveth the parts, e<U+017F>pecially the external which in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> are the fir<U+017F>t affected, and the inherent Spirits being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umed it ea<U+017F>ily leaveth a cold di<U+017F>temper behind it. For to a ju<U+017F>t excitation and con<U+017F>ervation of the heat of the parts there is required a certain due and regular <U+017F>trife of the exhalations between breathing, which if it prove deficient, the actual heat al<U+017F>o (becau<U+017F> it partly con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teth in this <U+017F>trife) becomes very feeble and languid, and the parts are ea<U+017F>ily expo<U+017F>ed to a cold di<U+017F>temper. But we have already <U+017F>poken of this matter at large. On the contrary, Sweat preternaturally re<U+017F>trained, as al<U+017F>o a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <U+017F>mal or le<U+017F>ned Tran<U+017F>piration, doth ea<U+017F>ily kindle a Feaveri<U+017F>h heat, and therfore it likewi<U+017F>e injureth the Spirits and di<U+017F><U+017F>olveth the parts, and rendreth them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ea<U+017F>ily obnoxious to a cold di<U+017F>temper.</p>
               <p>Finally, That we may comprehend all in a word, Any humor excerned above Rea<U+017F>on or Mea<U+017F>ure doth ea<U+017F>ily introduce a colliquation of the parts and a di<U+017F><U+017F>ipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inherent Spirits, and con<U+017F>equently di<U+017F>po<U+017F>eth the Body to this affect. And let this <U+017F>uffice to have been <U+017F>poken of non-Natural things, and the cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> thence ari<U+017F>ing.</p>

<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>tempers do partly agree with this Affect.

Yet it mu<U+017F>t here be noted, That great Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily changed into <U+017F>mal, as <U+017F>mal ones into great.

For <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es are more <U+017F>ubject to change into others, with whom in part they have <U+017F>ome agreement, than others: And that for other Rea<U+017F>ons be<U+017F>ide the <U+017F>aid agreement, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, if a cold and dry di<U+017F>temper <U+017F>hould happen to a Child, that would ea<U+017F>ily change into a cold and moi<U+017F>t;

both in re<U+017F>pect of the congruity of each Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> to cold, and al<U+017F>o a peculiar inclination of that tender age to moi<U+017F>ture. For by rea<U+017F>on of the coldne<U+017F>s, the dige<U+017F>tion becomes imperfect, and hereupon crudities or crude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midities are engendred, which a cold di<U+017F>temper in <U+017F>o tender an age would ea<U+017F>ily and immediatly follow. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper in regard of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s would make a <U+017F>low Pul<U+017F>e, and in regard of the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture would make it the more <U+017F>lippery, and the le<U+017F>s vi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, wherupon the Vital heat being dimini<U+017F>hed, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummedne<U+017F>s and dulne<U+017F>s by little and little would <U+017F>teal upon the Vital Spirits.

For all great quotidian Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, in proce<U+017F>s of time do extenuate the Body, wa<U+017F>t the inherent Spirits, and di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the <hi>Tone</hi> of the parts; and this attrition and attenuation of the parts doth chiefly refer to the fir<U+017F>t affected parts in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.

               <p>Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es that induce an a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment to the fir<U+017F>t affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted parts, do al<U+017F>o by a peculiar propriety con<U+017F>pire the production of this Affect. For the Natural heat of tho<U+017F>e parts is <U+017F>omwhat dulled by them, and is rendred le<U+017F>s effectual: whereupon a cold di<U+017F>temper <U+017F>tealeth in by degrees, which is al<U+017F>o (as hath been <U+017F>aid) ea<U+017F>ily waited on with a moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper, a <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, and internal <U+017F>lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perine<U+017F>s.

the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may at la<U+017F>t bud forth. The <hi>Apoplexy, Pal<U+017F>y, Lethargy,</hi> and the like effects do chiefly belong hither. Yet Children do exceeding rarely fall into this affect from the<U+017F>e <U+017F>leepy Cau<U+017F>es, and <U+017F>o rarely, that we have not yet ob<U+017F>erved this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> to own its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to <U+017F>uch affects. If any demand a Rea<U+017F>on of this rarity; we <U+017F>ay, that the Bodies of Children by rea<U+017F>on of their permeability and thinne<U+017F>s, are <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>ubjected to tho<U+017F>e affects; but if at any time they are invaded by them the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth not fir<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ault the Natural or Vital, but the Animal Con<U+017F>titution, and con<U+017F>equently procureth for the mo<U+017F>t part a deprivation of the Animal Faculty, before it interrupteth either the Natural or the Vital. But the benummedne<U+017F>s wherof we now <U+017F>peak, belongeth to the Natural Con<U+017F>titution, into which it cannot be pre<U+017F>ently transferred. Moreover, they are ea<U+017F>ily and <U+017F>pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily driven out, by rea<U+017F>on of the facility of tran<U+017F>piration in the Bodies of Children, if peradventure tho<U+017F>e affects do gently invade them: but if they rage and tyrrannize, they ea<U+017F>ily and <U+017F>peedily di<U+017F>patch and kil, as being in their own Nature mo<U+017F>t terrible and grievous Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es; and the <U+017F>ooner, becau<U+017F>e of the weakne<U+017F>s of their Con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons over whom they prevail.

            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, The yonger Children are of a colder tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament than the Elder. For the heat of the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is augmented from the time of the birth to mans e<U+017F>tate, at which time it <U+017F>tandeth at a <U+017F>tay being far more inten<U+017F>ive than that of Children, but afterwards it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth by degrees unto extream old age, and a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that extream age, it falleth into the <U+017F>ame degree as it held in the time of Child-hood; but before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of this term of extream old age the temperament of aged men is more hot than that of Children, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though yong Children may enjoy a greater plenty of Natural heat, and abound with Natural Spirits, yet there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that they therfore mu<U+017F>t be of a hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temperament, for there is required a concurrence of many things to con<U+017F>titute a hot temperament, be<U+017F>ide the inherent Spirits, and the inherent heat; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a large portion of Chollerick humors, and withal or chiefly a <U+017F>trong endeavor of the Vital faculty, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the pul<U+017F>es, and the Vital Spirits in their circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Seing therfore that the yonger Children are more cold, it is no wonder, if they be more <U+017F>ubject to cold Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es than others, <U+017F>uch as this is. As for old men, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch as are inclining to extream old age, we grant that they al<U+017F>o are more cold, and upon every light occa<U+017F>ion obnoxious to cold Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. Wherfore from hence, namely, from the coldne<U+017F>s of the temperament, we infer no difference between yonger Children &amp; the<U+017F>e
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169706:102"/>
old men, in re<U+017F>pect of an aptitude to fall into this affect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The yonger Children are more moi<U+017F>t than the elder; for to wax old, if it be taken in a <U+017F>ound <U+017F>ence, is to wax dry. For although old men after their manner may be likewi<U+017F>e obnoxious to moi<U+017F>t affects, as Cathars, Ob<U+017F>tructions, a <hi>Cachexy,</hi> a Drop<U+017F>ie, a Pal<U+017F>ie, a Lethargy, a loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s and trembling of the Nervs, and the like evils, yet really there is <U+017F>ome difference between a moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper which happeneth to Boys, and that which befalleth aged Per<U+017F>ons. For in Children an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious humidity con<U+017F>tituting the di<U+017F>temper doth not only penetrate the mo<U+017F>t retired <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the <U+017F>olid parts, but they are totally incorporated with the <U+017F>ame: But in old Men the <U+017F>olid parts, even then when it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper, doth not <U+017F>eem to part with its earthine<U+017F>s, but to be in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort compounded of that Earthy Nature, and a certain adventitious crude and moi<U+017F>t Juice, or el<U+017F>e an excrementitious drunk into the pores, or into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the parts, yet it is not <U+017F>ufficiently incorporated or united. For as <U+017F>and, being drenched in much water, retaineth al its Earthy <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance, however it be <U+017F>omwhat moi<U+017F>t; So al<U+017F>o the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of old Men, however they may be moy<U+017F>tened with crude and excrementitious humors, yet do they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ite that terrene <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, or that part which by the <hi>Chymicks</hi> is de<U+017F>igned by the name of a dead Head, which they dayly accumilate unto them<U+017F>elves from their fir<U+017F>t beginning. This di<U+017F>temper therfore of old Per<U+017F>ons is <U+017F>purious not genuine, crude and not perfectly dige<U+017F>ted into the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the parts. And therefore although we grant that old men may in their way, labor with a moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper, yet it is manife<U+017F>t withal by what hath been <U+017F>aid, how great a difference there is between this of aged per<U+017F>ons, &amp; that of Yong children. Morover, that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169706:103"/>
this moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper of old men, is le<U+017F>s Homogeneal to the pre<U+017F>ent affect, then that of children, appears plainly from hence, becau<U+017F>e it produceth not that <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s and tenderne<U+017F>s of parts in old men, as we <U+017F>ee it doth in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, neither doth it equally di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e them to a di<U+017F><U+017F>ipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or colliquation of the inherent Spirits, or any <U+017F>lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery pa<U+017F><U+017F>age either of the Blood or Exhalations, which are <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed in this Affect: But on the other <U+017F>ide, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rendreth them obnoxious to ob<U+017F>tructions, and the other evils recited before a compari<U+017F>on, therefore being made between the cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper incident to Younger Children, and that which is wont to affect old men, there re<U+017F>ulteth a pregnant rea<U+017F>on, why aged people are not <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubject to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> as Children.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Yong Children, although they Naturally abound with inherent Spirits, yet by rea<U+017F>on of the ea<U+017F>ie tran<U+017F>piration of their Bodies, &amp; becau<U+017F> of the laxity, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne<U+017F>s and incoherence of the parts, they are much more prone then Elder per<U+017F>ons to di<U+017F><U+017F>ipation and colliquation of the Inherent Spirits, and by con<U+017F>equence upon le<U+017F>s and <U+017F>lighter cau<U+017F>es they fal into a want of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Younger Children by rea<U+017F>on of that very <U+017F>ame weak con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the parts, are al<U+017F>o rendred more obnoxious to an a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment than the Elder. For to the vigor and activity of the parts, there is required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides a ju<U+017F>t plenty of Spirits, a <U+017F>trength of their coherence and con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it is not needful for us to ad any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Tone</hi> of the parts, <U+017F>eing we have <U+017F>o often in<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated the weakne<U+017F>s of it in Younger Children in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect of the Elder, and any man may ob<U+017F>erve that upon the increa<U+017F>e of years the <hi>Tone</hi> is more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, As for the diminute di<U+017F>tribution of the blood
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169706:103"/>
to the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, (which we have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be a con<U+017F>iderable part of the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>) We <U+017F>ay, that the Elder Children do u<U+017F>e more <U+017F>trong and frequent exerci<U+017F>es then the Younger, and therefore that the pul<U+017F>es of the outward parts are more <U+017F>trongly <U+017F>tirred up in them, and that a greater heat is rai<U+017F>ed and cheri<U+017F>hed in them, and by con<U+017F>equence a cold di<U+017F>temper is more potentially driven out of them.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, as for the Organical faults, namely, the augmented magnitude of the Liver Head, and their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, it is a known thing that the proportion of the parts is more <U+017F>table and confirmed in the bigger Children, and on the contrary that in the Younger they are ea<U+017F>ily moved and altered, but the augmentation cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing they are not any more afterwards altered, without <U+017F>ome unu<U+017F>ual and weighty cau<U+017F>es. So that even in this re<U+017F>pect the Younger Children are mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubject to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore conclude the parts of the Que<U+017F>tion, That Young Children, in re<U+017F>pect of their Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titutions and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions are more obnoxious to this evil then tho<U+017F>e that are Elder, and <U+017F>o much the more, the Younger they are.</p>
            <p>But we mu<U+017F>t not wave an Objection, that here we meet with, which al<U+017F>o doth very fitly conveigh an occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing to the other compari<U+017F>on; namly, of Young Children among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves. <hi>For if Young Children</hi> (as is manife<U+017F>t by what hath been <U+017F>aid) <hi>are more prone to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> by their Natural Con<U+017F>titution and di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition, and the Younger they are, the more <U+017F>ubject they are: How comes it to pa<U+017F>s, that Children rarely fal into this affect, before they are <U+017F>ix months old and <U+017F>omwhat more?</hi> For according to the Opinion delivered, Children
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169706:104"/>
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem to be principally <U+017F>ubject to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after their birth, which yet experience di<U+017F>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth; yea, rather indeed it witne<U+017F><U+017F>eth the contrary; namely, that Children before they are nine months old are <U+017F>eldom or <U+017F>carce ever afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Here therefore it wil be needful for us to declare that other compari<U+017F>on of Young Children among them<U+017F>elvs. For it cannot be, that this Affect <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o con<U+017F>tantly <U+017F>pare Children, chiefly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed unto it, and frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade tho<U+017F>e that are le<U+017F>s di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome difference did intervene, which did in a diver<U+017F>e manner relate to tho<U+017F>e ages, and which notwith<U+017F>tanding the propen<U+017F>ity of Nature doth retard the inva<U+017F>ion of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, before the fir<U+017F>t twelve months were compleatly expired, and yet afterwards, either doth not at all or not <U+017F>o potently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Children from this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Here therefore we mu<U+017F>t find the very rea<U+017F>on of the difference between the<U+017F>e ages: which that we may the <U+017F>ooner do, it wil not perhaps be impertinent to take <U+017F>pecial notice by the way of tho<U+017F>e ages, which upon the authority of experience are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved to be more frequently affected with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and likewi<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e ages which are lea<U+017F>t afflicted with it.</p>
            <p>We affirm therefore, that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invade Children pre<U+017F>ently after their birth, or before they are <U+017F>ix months old; (yea, perhaps before the ninth month) but after that time it beginneth by little and little daily to rage more and more to the period of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months, then it attaineth its pitch and exaltation, and as it were re<U+017F>teth in it, till the Child be two years and <U+017F>ix months old: So that the time of the thicke<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<U+017F>ion is that whol year, which bears date from the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth month, two years and a half being expired the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> falleth into its declination, and <U+017F>eldom invadeth the Child, for the rea<U+017F>ons already alleadged. But the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169706:104"/>
rea<U+017F>ons <hi>Why Infants newly born are rarely affected, and why from the ninth to the eighteenth month they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently affected, and why after the fir<U+017F>t eighteen months they are mo<U+017F>t frequently affected</hi> <U+017F>hall now all of them in their order be produced.</p>
            <p>The Fir<U+017F>t Rea<U+017F>ons why Children newly born are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <U+017F>eldom invaded with this affect may be the<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The Fir<U+017F>t is, Becau<U+017F> the <hi>Embryon</hi> in the Womb is by the equal heat and embracement of the Matrix <U+017F>trongly fortified again<U+017F>t this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, as we have declared above, and by con<U+017F>equence the <U+017F>ame being brought to light doth for a time retain <U+017F>om of that, muniment &amp; defence which it contracted from that equal warmth of the Womb, and therfore pre<U+017F>ently after the Birth it doth not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily fall into it.</p>
            <p>The Second is, Becau<U+017F> the Midwives and Nur<U+017F>es do handle them <U+017F>o artificially when they are new born, that their condition is not con<U+017F>iderably different from that which they po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed in the Womb. For they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap the whol Body, excepting the Head, in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Covering; wherupon the exterior and fir<U+017F>t af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected parts of the Body in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> are fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the injuries of the outward cold, and the hot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations breaking out from any part of the Body are duly and equally retained by rea<U+017F>on of that Covering which is two or three times double, and bound about with <U+017F>wathing Bands, and equally communicated to all the parts of the Body, <U+017F>o that they are cheri<U+017F>hed with an even heat as it were in a common Hypocau<U+017F>t or hot Hou<U+017F>. Seing therfore that the fir<U+017F>t part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in an unequal cold di<U+017F>temper, it is no wonder if the<U+017F>e Defences and Fortifications of the Body do avert it at lea<U+017F>t for <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hort time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:169706:105"/>
The Third Rea<U+017F>on may perhaps be the whol<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s of the Diet, for Brea<U+017F>t-Milk is the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>olubrious and agreeable nouri<U+017F>hment that tender age, e<U+017F>pecially when it is <U+017F>ucked from the Brea<U+017F>ts: for it is a <U+017F>imple and uniform Meat, full of nouri<U+017F>hment, ea<U+017F>ie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct, and friendly and farmiliar to the con<U+017F>titution of Infants. Therfore <U+017F>o long as they are conveniently nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed with it, they incur the fewer errors of diet, and are rendred the le<U+017F>s obnoxious to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Yet it mu<U+017F>t be noted, that if the Nur<U+017F>es milk be not laudable and good in it <U+017F>elf, or otherwi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>agreable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution of the Infant, then this rea<U+017F>on is of no force. Therefore if the Nur<U+017F>e be big with Child, or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly addicted to Venery, or any ways <U+017F>ickly, or given to drunkenne<U+017F>s and inordinate feeding, it is <U+017F>afer to ha<U+017F>ten the weaning of the Infant, unle<U+017F>s you are provided of a better Nur<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>The fourth and la<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on is the <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in his fir<U+017F>t inva<U+017F>ions. For it <U+017F>teal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on <U+017F>o <U+017F>lowly, that it <U+017F>carce bewrayeth any preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to an a<U+017F><U+017F>ault til <U+017F>ome months are expired, unle<U+017F>s the progre<U+017F>s of it be advanced by <U+017F>ome extraordinary and mo<U+017F>t vehement Cau<U+017F>es, as by <U+017F>ome more violent Affect preceding or coming upon it. Seing therefore that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth <U+017F>o <U+017F>lowly take Root, and <U+017F>eing that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as we have formerly <U+017F>hewed, are commonly born free from it, it <U+017F>eldom hapneth to break out evidently into act til the <U+017F>ixth, yea, indeed til the ninth month. And thus we have given the rea<U+017F>ons, why Infants newly born, notwith<U+017F>tanding the weakne<U+017F>s of their Con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are for many months priviledged from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The cau<U+017F>es why Children from the ninth to the eighteenth Month are every day more frequently infe<U+017F>ted with this affect, are the<U+017F>e,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:169706:105"/>
Fir<U+017F>t, Becau<U+017F> the fir<U+017F>t Cau<U+017F> even now propounded, driving away this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in tho<U+017F>e that are new born, doth daily remit, and before the ninth Month doth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally vani<U+017F>h. Secondly, In like manner the <U+017F>econd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul<U+017F>ive Cau<U+017F> before alledged till that age doth every day grow more effectual. For the hands of Infants, after <U+017F>ome Months, if not before, are u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>et at liberty from the pri<U+017F>on of their Blankets, and perhaps their Feet al<U+017F>o before they are <U+017F>ix months old, although at night they are <U+017F>wadled up again. In the day time ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the lea<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e outward Members are de<U+017F>titute of that common and comfortable warmth. The Nur<U+017F>es likewi<U+017F>e do many times er, when they cloath the weak and feeble Infants too <U+017F>oon. For they idly define the time of cloathing them by the number of the Months, <U+017F>eing that they <U+017F>hould rather give an e<U+017F>timation of it by the <U+017F>trength and activity of the motion of their Hands and Feet. For when the motion and exerci<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e parts doth avail more to excite and cheri<U+017F>h their heat, and to irritate their Pul<U+017F>es, than the warmth of their <U+017F>wadling cloaths, without all controver<U+017F>ie that is the time to deve<U+017F>t Infants from their <U+017F>wadling cloaths. Moreover thirdly, After the ninth Month Children u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ually are fed with other aliment be<U+017F>ides Brea<U+017F>t-Milk or other Milk, and from that variety in feeding there ea<U+017F>ily re<U+017F>ulteth <U+017F>ome errors in point of Diet. Fourthly, The <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s of the Motion of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth not hinder, but that it may break forth into act after the ninth Month. For the motion, by rea<U+017F>on of the unperceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s of it, at the end of certain months, doth exhibit <U+017F>ome effects and impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. La<U+017F>tly the evils of breeding teeth do likewi<U+017F>e contribute very much to the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e. For the Teeth begin to breed common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the <U+017F>eventh Month, and come accompanied

with divers Symptoms, which ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e tender Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to this affect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Cau<U+017F>es why this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> mo<U+017F>t frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rageth when the Child is eighteen Months old, are;</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, Becau<U+017F> the Cau<U+017F>es before cited ha<U+017F>tning this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in the yonger Children, are upon the approach of this age taken away, or at lea<U+017F>t they operate with weak and ineffectual powers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The evils of breeding Teeth, although in re<U+017F>pect of the immediate Symptoms which they produce perhaps before this time, they nouri<U+017F>h; yet for the mo<U+017F>t part they leave behind them in the fir<U+017F>t affected parts a certain di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, which privily hiding it <U+017F>elf within them, after the term of <U+017F>ome months produceth this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. But the breaking out of the Dog-teeth chiefly hath reference to this place; <U+017F>eing that the<U+017F>e break out a little before the Child is a year and an half old, and their coming forth likewi<U+017F>e is of al other the mo<U+017F>t pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hitherto belong al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e accidents which happen by rea<U+017F>on of ablactation or weaning of the Child, and at that time a great alteration befalleth Children in matter of Diet, which they endure not without palpable mole<U+017F>tation. For herupon they are angry, they cry, the commotions of their minds makes them for<U+017F>ake the nouri<U+017F>hment of their Bodies, they are hard to be plea<U+017F>ed, neither do they <U+017F>leep quietly. All which things do ea<U+017F>ily imprint in the parts fir<U+017F>t affected at lea<U+017F>t a foregoing di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition (although perhaps not till a long time after) to this affect.</p>
            <p>And <U+017F>o at length we have al<U+017F>o run through this <U+017F>econd Compari<U+017F>on, namely of yong Children among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves, and we have briefly explained the Cau<U+017F>es why
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169706:106"/>
tho<U+017F>e Children at one age are more, and at another age are le<U+017F>s expo<U+017F>ed to this evil.</p>
            <p>The Third part of the Que<U+017F>tion <U+017F>till remaineth, which as we <U+017F>aid we would re<U+017F>erve to be examined at the clo<U+017F>e of this Di<U+017F>putation; namely, Whether tho<U+017F>e that are of a greater age do <U+017F>omtimes fall (though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rarely into this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.)</p>
            <p>We <U+017F>ay fir<U+017F>t, For <U+017F>o much as concerneth that part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in a moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper, that <U+017F>ome difference mu<U+017F>t be expected to be between that di<U+017F>temper in yonger Children, and tho<U+017F>e that are bigger, in yong Men, Men, and e<U+017F>pecially in old Men, for the <U+017F>ame difference which we put before between the moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper of yong Children and old Men, may according to quantity as more or le<U+017F>s, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved between the middle Ages, and therfore the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of the yonger Children will be better concocted and more genuine than that of the elder, as it is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to collect, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> from the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As for the organical faults, we affirm that nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily there concurreth a va<U+017F>t difference between Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of this kind incident to Children, and perhaps to tho<U+017F>e of greater age, for the tumors of the Bones in the Wre<U+017F>ts and Ankles, as al<U+017F>o that narrowne<U+017F>s of the Brea<U+017F>t, likewi<U+017F>e that di<U+017F>proportionatly augmented bigne<U+017F>s of the Head and Liver, are either le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>picu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or altogether unde<U+017F>cernable, e<U+017F>pecially in tho<U+017F>e that are grown to full age. For as the years encrea<U+017F> the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and proportion of the Parts becomes more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, firm, and <U+017F>table; neither doth it ea<U+017F>ily come to pa<U+017F>s that one part doth much grow out more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by true augmentation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We <U+017F>ay that excepting the two premi<U+017F>ed
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169706:107"/>
conditions, and that in that manner as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, this affect according to the other parts of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence thereof (although indeed very rarely and upon the highe<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>es only) may happen to Boys, Young Men, Men, and old Men. For fir<U+017F>t a cold di<U+017F>temper without al controver<U+017F>ie may befal them, though not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily as Children. Secondly, A moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper may al<U+017F>o invade them, but yet only by the limitation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. Thirdly, A want of inherent Spirits, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o befal them, but then it mu<U+017F>t proceed from the mo<U+017F>t potent cau<U+017F>es. For Chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es and <U+017F>uch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ume the habit of the parts, or di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate it into ayr, or wa<U+017F>t it by long fa<U+017F>ting and an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> do nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily leave behind them a paucity of Natural Spirits. We <U+017F>ee the outward parts even in tho<U+017F>e that are grown to ful age, when they are extenuated and con<U+017F>umed by <U+017F>uch like cau<U+017F>es, to wax feeble, to langui<U+017F>h, wither, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come de<U+017F>titute of al <U+017F>ufficient Spirituo<U+017F>ity. Yet we grant that in tho<U+017F>e that are grown to full age, the evil which cau<U+017F>eth leanne<U+017F>s being overcome, the wa<U+017F>ted Spirits may <U+017F>oon be repaired by the vigor of the Pul<U+017F>es, and that the rudiments and impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may be rooted out within one or two weeks, and by con<U+017F>equence, that they are <U+017F>eldom affected with it. In the interim, if it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o fal out, that upon that con<U+017F>uming of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Spirits <U+017F>ome impediment <U+017F>hould intervene that might retard their reparation, it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F> may grow from thence in that manner as hath been <U+017F>aid. But a numbne<U+017F>s of the Inherent Spirits mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>arily follow upon a fewne<U+017F>s of them. Fourthly, The parts of the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, <U+017F>eing that they have a <U+017F>trong dependance upon the Primary faults, where the<U+017F>e per<U+017F>evere long (the Organical faults being excepted) they may <U+017F>upervene in their order. So that we do not
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169706:107"/>
doubt but this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may happen to any age after child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; the re<U+017F>trictions which we have now propounded being granted, and upon the urgency and per<U+017F>everance of great and weighty cau<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>One among<U+017F>t us affirmeth, that he had a Gentleman in cure about thirty yeers of age, who by dayly immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare u<U+017F>e of Wine and Tobacco, continued for <U+017F>ome whole years, having neglected the due receiving of his meat, fel into <U+017F>uch a weakne<U+017F>s of Stomach, that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally every morning he vomited, and loathed al kind of Meat, and if at any time he <U+017F>wallowed any with unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingne<U+017F>s, he pre<U+017F>ently vomited it up again: to appea<U+017F>e this quezine<U+017F>s of Stomach, he was at la<U+017F>t compelled to a continual u<U+017F>e of ordinary <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> but afterwards his cu<U+017F>tome was to mingle it with <U+017F>tale Beer, and a quantity of Sugar; and with this drink alone he pre<U+017F>erved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf alive for many months. In the mean time all tho<U+017F>e parts which in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> we cal the fir<U+017F>t affected, were extreamly lean, and became <U+017F>oft, loo<U+017F>e, languid and withered, <U+017F>o that he could neither turn him<U+017F>elf in his bed, nor ri<U+017F>e, nor walk, nor <U+017F>tand upright, yet he felt no pain, neither was there any privation of <U+017F>en<U+017F> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no cough, no unea<U+017F>y re<U+017F>piration, his face was well colored, and al the parts about his Head were in a good condition, and wel habited, <U+017F>o that had you judged of him by his countenance only, you could <U+017F>carce have <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected that he was <U+017F>ick. As he lay in his bed he would chat with his Companions, take Tobacco by turns, and drink that mixture of Beer and <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> afore<U+017F>aid. The event of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth not indeed belong to this place, yet we <U+017F>hal <U+017F>et it down to gratify them who are de<U+017F>irous to know it. The Phy<U+017F>itian being <U+017F>ent for, he <U+017F>trictly forbad al intemperance, and among<U+017F>t other remedies having given him one grain &amp; a half of <hi>Laudanum Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinen<U+017F>is,</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:169706:108"/>
he appea<U+017F>ed the nau<U+017F>eous infirmity, and tumult of his Stomach, which part he likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>trengthned with internal and external applications, and pre<U+017F>cribed him <U+017F>uch a diet as was mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>y of concoction. In<U+017F>tead of exerci<U+017F>e he <U+017F>olicited the heat unto the outward parts with rubbing them every morning: having fir<U+017F>t given a <U+017F>mal quantity of <U+017F>trengthning and opening Electuary, made up with a little portion of Steel, which he drank in two ounces of Wine, compo<U+017F>ed of Wormwood and Mint, a little Saffron being hung in it, to give it a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; three ounces of <U+017F>mal Beer, being tempered with it, and a quantity of Sugar to make the ta<U+017F>te of it more plea<U+017F>ant. Moreover, he purged him by fits with gentle Medicines, and in the evening comforted him with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials. Within twenty days he grew to <U+017F>uch a degree of amendment, that he could walk abroad, for the <U+017F>pace of an hour, and could without any <U+017F>triving or much weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s climb ladders without any help. But afterwards by a relaps into the like intemperance, he died in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of his Phy<U+017F>itian. But let us return from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F><U+017F>ion into the way, &amp; direct our <U+017F>peech to our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <U+017F>cope. The Affect being now confirmed, as it was upon the fir<U+017F>t coming of the Doctor; Be<U+017F>ides the faults of the Stomach, it <U+017F>eemed to include a great part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, we now treat of. For in the parts <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient to motion; namely, tho<U+017F>e that are fir<U+017F>t affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, there was a cold di<U+017F>temper, either through defect of motion, or by rea<U+017F>on of the immunite afflux and di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation of the Vital Blood. Again, the <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s, <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s, laxity, and litherne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e parts <U+017F>hewed that there was a moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper in them. Al<U+017F>o the extream leanne<U+017F>s of tho<U+017F>e parts did <U+017F>ufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trate a fewne<U+017F>s of inherent Spirits, and the unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s to motion, and affectation of re<U+017F>t and ea<U+017F> did <U+017F>tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169706:108"/>
witne<U+017F>s a numbne<U+017F>s in tho<U+017F>e parts. The ful and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hing habit of the parts about the Head, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts were extenuated, was a forcible rea<U+017F>on to prove the unequal di<U+017F>tribution of the Blood. But the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar cau<U+017F>e of this inequality in this <U+017F>ick man, might be his frequent vomiting, whereby a more plentiful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the Blood was driven to the parts about the Head the other being almo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>titute of it.</p>
            <p>Any man may perceive by what hath been <U+017F>aid, that at lea<U+017F>t the greate<U+017F>t part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> was comprehended in this mentioned Affect. From whence at length we may<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> probably infer, that it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> to happen to tho<U+017F>e of ful growth, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idered according to the propounded limitations; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it very <U+017F>eldom coms to pa<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e great cau<U+017F>es and length of time are required to the production of it. And thus at la<U+017F>t we have put an end to the <U+017F>earch upon the former Que<U+017F>tion.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is acknowledged by the common con<U+017F>ent of Phy<U+017F>itians that there are certain <hi>Country Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>es;</hi> namely, which more frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t the Inhabitants of <U+017F>ome one Region, than of another, by rea<U+017F>on of <U+017F>om Common Cau<U+017F>.

            <p>

There are four conditions required to denominate a Country Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> properly <U+017F>o called.</p>
            <p>The fir<U+017F>t condition is, <hi>That the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in that Region, unto which it is attributed, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and common, then in any other Region, unto which it is not attributed as <U+017F>uch.</hi> For a common or Country Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, is always <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to have an unequal reference to divers Regions, and to infe<U+017F>t one more (namly, that unto which it is a<U+017F>cribed) and another le<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>The Second Condition is, <hi>That the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> depends upon <U+017F>ome kind of inclemency of the place.</hi> For a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> properly common imputeth a certain crime or faultine<U+017F>s to the very place; therfore when a place is not guilty of <U+017F>om peculiar fault, <U+017F>uch an imputation is improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fal<U+017F>ly and unju<U+017F>tly a<U+017F>cribed unto it.</p>
            <p>The Third Condition is, <hi>That the inclemency and <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of the Region be <U+017F>o great, as to affect the more wary, and <U+017F>uch as ob<U+017F>erve a du Regiment of health, and <U+017F>uch an one as is apropriated to the place.</hi> For in the Regiment of health <U+017F>ome peculiar Caution is due to certain Countries. Therfore when a People neglecting <U+017F>uch a peculiar Ob<U+017F>ervation of the place, <U+017F>hal fall into <U+017F>ome Epidemical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> by an erroneous u<U+017F>e of the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural things, that it is not to be reputed a common di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>, but to be imputed to the error, want of wit, incogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy and negligence of the Inhabitants. For this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>, which we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e might have been prevented, had the Regiment of health apropriated to the place been rightly ob<U+017F>erved.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Condition is, <hi>That that vicious con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Country do either continue long, or return of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi> For the fault of a place that is fugitive, not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent nor often returning, mu<U+017F>t be accompted as <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what forregn and meerly accidental in re<U+017F>pect of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169706:110"/>
Region, and cannot properly denominate a common Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. As for example, If a pernicious and unu<U+017F>ual Air <U+017F>hould chance to be blown hither from other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and <U+017F>hould produce a common di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, which <U+017F>hould not prevail beyond <U+017F>ome months; that di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> ought not properly to be called common, but rather ca<U+017F>ual and chanceable. Wherfore the Feaver of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the Sweating-<U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s of <hi>England,</hi> although they obtained their Names chiefly from tho<U+017F>e Regions, yet are they abu<U+017F>ively termed common, becau<U+017F>e they want a durable fomentation from tho<U+017F>e places, and becau<U+017F> they either cea<U+017F> altogether, or at lea<U+017F>t are not for the pre<U+017F>ent more predominent in this or that place than in another.</p>
            <p>Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es improperly comon do indeed include the fir<U+017F>t propounded condition of <U+017F>uch as are properly <U+017F>o called, namely, becau<U+017F>e they more frequently occur in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whereunto they are attributed, then in another, (for otherwi<U+017F>e they would not de<U+017F>erve the apellation of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es improperly common) yet they want the <U+017F>econd third, and fourth. For they either lack that fomentation that is rooted in the Region, or that fomentation which they have is very weak and in con<U+017F>iderable, which al<U+017F>o may be overcom by a Regiment of diet appropriated to the place; or finally the fomentation is not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent nor durable, nor frequently returning. Now by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation we under<U+017F>tand <U+017F>omwhat that is faulty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect of health, founded likewi<U+017F>e in the condition of the Country. Therefore when <U+017F>om common and frequent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> ari<U+017F>eth from the abu<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome commodity of the Region, as if <U+017F>om Nation by rea<U+017F>on of the great plenty of fruit, and the like fruitfulne<U+017F>s of the place, or by rea<U+017F>on of a long and <U+017F>ecure peace <U+017F>hould abu<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, <U+017F>loath or the like vices and thereby incur <U+017F>om common Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, that Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is not properly to be
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169706:110"/>
called common. For the occa<U+017F>ion of that Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, which the Country did <U+017F>upply with, was laudable in it <U+017F>elf, and therfore what event <U+017F>oever <U+017F>ucceeded, the abu<U+017F>e therof ought to be imputed to the error of the inhabitants, not to any unkindne<U+017F>s or di<U+017F>courte<U+017F>ie of the Region. In like manner if the fomention of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be culpable, yet <U+017F>hall not that be founded in the very con<U+017F>titution of the Country, but in <U+017F>ome action of men, as when after the de<U+017F>olations of War the unburied Carka<U+017F><U+017F>es pollute the Air with their putrifaction, and therupon introduce an Epidemical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, this ought not to be called a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Country Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, becau<U+017F> it dependeth upon the liberty of mans will, and was not procured by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fault of the place.</p>
            <p>Somtimes al<U+017F>o a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is a<U+017F>cribed to a Nation or Place by calumny, and abu<U+017F>ively through the malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and corrupt intentions of <U+017F>ome People to traduce the Fame of their neighbor Nations. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>Neopolitans</hi> call the <hi>Venereous Evil,</hi> the <hi>French Pox,</hi> as if it were Natural and Common to the <hi>French.</hi> And on the contrary, the <hi>French</hi> to requite the Slander, term it the <hi>Neopolitan Scab.</hi> But of this enough.</p>
            <p>A Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> properly called Common, is either Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Ancient, or Adventitious and New. The Original is that which from the fir<U+017F>t Inhabitation of the place hath infe<U+017F>ted the Inhabitants: of this kind perhaps is the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in the Throat called <hi>Branchocele</hi> among tho<U+017F>e that dwell about the <hi>Alps;</hi> that burning Feaver which they call a <hi>Calenture,</hi> under the torrid <hi>Zone:</hi> the mortification of the parts under the cold <hi>Zones</hi> towards the Poles by extremity of cold.</p>
            <p>A Country Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> that is new and adventitious, is that which is brought into a Country by <U+017F>ome common Cau<U+017F>. This is threefold, for either it proceedeth from
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169706:111"/>
<U+017F>ome Original fault of the Region, prevailing by the advantage of time again<U+017F>t the health of the inhabitants, or from <U+017F>ome alteration or innovation hapning to the Region it <U+017F>elf. Or from <U+017F>ome incongruity between the Place and the complexion of the Natives.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, A new common Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> invadeth a Country by <U+017F>ome Original fault in proce<U+017F>s of time prevailing more and more. For 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that the firm and <U+017F>trong Bodies of the fir<U+017F>t Inhabitants of any place may powerfully re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the unwhol<U+017F>om influence of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for many Ages may repel the inva<U+017F>ion of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, although their po<U+017F>terity afterwards, in length of time, being by degrees changed in that peculiar Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of the complexion wherby they maintained the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, may fall at la<U+017F>t into <U+017F>ome common Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>. For the <hi>Plica</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Scurvy, are common Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es to the <hi>Sarmatians, Polanders,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Ocean, and they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e new Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and (as all men confe<U+017F>s) totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Ancients. But to this day it is not known that any notable or remarkable Change or Innovation hath hapned to tho<U+017F>e Regions before the breaking out of tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, to which you might probably a<U+017F>cribe the beginning of a new Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Wherfore we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <U+017F>ay that tho<U+017F>e new Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es did proceed from <U+017F>ome ancient and original fault of the places: and yet that they did not bewray them<U+017F>elves at fir<U+017F>t by rea<U+017F>on of a peculiar re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance made by the Natural <U+017F>trength of the Inhabitants. For to this very day <U+017F>ome Families in tho<U+017F>e places are free from tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and very cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible it is that they may <U+017F>o per<U+017F>evere, not yielding to the injuries or threatnings of the Region.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A new common Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may re<U+017F>ult from the altered or innovated con<U+017F>titution of the place. Such
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169706:111"/>
kind of innovations happen in Countries, either by Earthquakes, or Inundations of Water, or the bur<U+017F>ting forth of <U+017F>ome new pernicious Springs, or perhaps of <U+017F>ome new Mineral Exhalations from the Caveous of the Earth, or from <U+017F>ome malignant A<U+017F>pect of the Stars and the like Cau<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A new common Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may proceed from the incongruity of the Place with the complexion of the Natives. Such kind of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es chiefly happen to Nations, when they tran<U+017F>plant them<U+017F>elves from one Region to another: e<U+017F>pecially when the Con<U+017F>titutions of tho<U+017F>e Countries which they go to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s, are very different from tho<U+017F>e they for<U+017F>ook. So the Engli<U+017F>h who fir<U+017F>t inhabited <hi>Virginia</hi> were frequently afflicted with a <U+017F>welling of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> parts; who upon their return to <hi>England</hi> were cured without any difficulty, but they who continued in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> were not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily re<U+017F>tored to health.</p>
            <p>Moreover, National and common Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them<U+017F>elves. Becau<U+017F> <U+017F>ome of them totally depend upon the inclemency of the Region, and others in part only. The mortification of the parts <U+017F>eemeth to be of the fir<U+017F>t kind which befalleth men in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Tracts near the Poles. For the whol E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may be a<U+017F>cribed to the cold and <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of the Place. Of the <U+017F>econd kind the <hi>Venereous Pox</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>We<U+017F>t-Indians</hi> <U+017F>eemeth to be. For there it is conceived to be partly gotten by impure Copulation, and partly to be contracted from the In<U+017F>alubrity of the place. In like manner the Bloody Flux is predominent in <hi>Ireland,</hi> depending partly upon the con<U+017F>titution of the place, partly upon an erroneous and prepo<U+017F>terous diet. And thus much in general be <U+017F>poken of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of common Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. In the next place we mu<U+017F>t
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169706:112"/>
enquire why this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is more rife in <hi>England</hi> than in other Regions? And by the way it mu<U+017F>t be ob<U+017F>erved, <hi>Whether, and how far forth this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may be <U+017F>aid to be Natural to Engli<U+017F>h men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, it mu<U+017F>t be ob<U+017F>erved, that <hi>England</hi> is an I<U+017F>land which borroweth <U+017F>ome humidity from the adjacency of the Sea, and <U+017F>ome frigidity from the di<U+017F>tance from the <hi>Equator,</hi> then that it aboundeth with innumerable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, di<U+017F>covering their Springs almo<U+017F>t in al places. La<U+017F>tly, That it is watred with many and frequent <U+017F>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of rain more than other Regions. All which things do <U+017F>ufficiently atte<U+017F>t the frigidity and humidity of the place. Seing therfore that a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper is a part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, we may ea<U+017F>ily infer that the bodies of the Inhabitants are here more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>tempers then in other hot and dry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>If therefore you demand, <hi>Whether this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, at lea<U+017F>t con<U+017F>idered in this part of it, may rightly be <U+017F>aid to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Engli<U+017F>h men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We an<U+017F>wer,</hi> That in <U+017F>om <U+017F>ort it may (although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not properly) namely, <U+017F>o far forth as the <U+017F>ame is attributed as natural to other Regions, alike cold and moi<U+017F>t (although perhaps it may not yet be ob<U+017F>erved in them.) For tho<U+017F>e Countries are as readily di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed to imprint a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper as <hi>England</hi> it <U+017F>elf. Yet it mu<U+017F>t be ob<U+017F>erved, that a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is a common part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and that it alone doth not manife<U+017F>t the Affect, for every cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper doth not introduce this evil. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although we grant, that an exce<U+017F>s of cold and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ture may be imputed as a fault to <hi>England,</hi> yet we deny that from thence it can be rightly inferred that the whol Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is common and Natural to Engli<U+017F>h men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:169706:112"/>
Moreover, Some Countries may perhaps be found out far exceeding <hi>England</hi> both in cold and moi<U+017F>ture, as <hi>Scotland, Holland, Zealand, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the like; wherin notwith<U+017F>tanding this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> hath not been ob<U+017F>erved to appear much. Therfore if this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be not rightly imputed to the<U+017F>e Regions, wherein that common cau<U+017F>e is predominant; namely, the exce<U+017F>s of cold and moi<U+017F>ture. Certainly neither can it ju<U+017F>tly be imputed to <hi>England,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of that common Cau<U+017F>e, which is here le<U+017F>s prevalent. Again, The coldne<U+017F>s and moi<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s of this Kingdom doth not <U+017F>o far tran<U+017F>cend a a mediocrity, but that by outward and inwaad applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exerci<U+017F>es and the like; namely, a right u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ix things not Natural, they may be <U+017F>ufficiently correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ca<U+017F>hiering of that imputation, Wherefore if the<U+017F>e things be <U+017F>o, namely, if a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be only a common cau<U+017F>e of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, if other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions wherein this Affect hath not yet been ob<U+017F>erved to make any impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, are at lea<U+017F>t equally obnoxious to cold and moi<U+017F>ture: Finally, if tho<U+017F>e di<U+017F>tempers may be prevented by a Regiment of diet appropriated to the place; certainly the rea<U+017F>on drawn from the coldne<U+017F>s and moi<U+017F>ture of the Climate, which even now we produced to <U+017F>hew why Engli<U+017F>h men <U+017F>hould be more frequently invaded with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> then others, will be very weak and in<U+017F>ufficient, <U+017F>o that we can by no means place our content in that alone, and therefore we intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more by that a<U+017F><U+017F>ignation, than that <hi>England</hi> doth more di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e the Bodies of the Inhabitants to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than hotter and drier Regions do the Bodies of their Inhabitants. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o we proceed to the <U+017F>earch of the other cau<U+017F>es of the rifene<U+017F>s and frequency of this Affect.</p>
            <p>In the <U+017F>econd place we can note that <hi>England</hi> is very
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:169706:113"/>
ruitful and Child-breeding being <U+017F>ufficiently favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to Conception and Child-bearing, and not ubject to cau<U+017F>e abortions. Now from hence it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that not only <U+017F>trong and able bodied men, and <U+017F>uch as are endued with perfect health, but the weak and <U+017F>ickly per<U+017F>ons do al<U+017F>o generate; weak &amp; un<U+017F>ound women likewi<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>uch as are prone to a con<U+017F>umption, do conceive, carry their children nine months, and bring them forth in a decent and laudable manner. But it is no wonder if the I<U+017F><U+017F>ue begotten by <U+017F>uch matter, and which oweth its life almo<U+017F>t to the clemency of the place alone, <U+017F>hould be feeble and languid, and very <U+017F>ubject to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For as much as the very benignity of the Region may in this re<U+017F>pect be the occa<U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ome infirmity in the I<U+017F><U+017F>ue. For as barbarous People in time pa<U+017F>t by an inhumane experiment upon their new born infants; namely, by dipping their naked bodies in the colde<U+017F>t water, de<U+017F>troyed the weak ones with the extremity of the cold, and gave education only to the <U+017F>trong ones, who<U+017F>e vigorous Con<U+017F>titutions overcame the injury of their cruel policies, purpo<U+017F>ing by that inhumanity to have an univer<U+017F>al race of <U+017F>trong &amp; lu<U+017F>ty people. So on the contrary the very clemency of the place promi<U+017F>cou<U+017F>ly pre<U+017F>erving the langui<U+017F>hing and weak Children together with the <U+017F>trong &amp; healthful, doth mini<U+017F>ter an occa<U+017F>ion of bringing forth a mixt kind of people <U+017F>ome <U+017F>trong and <U+017F>ome weak and <U+017F>ickly. Yet lea<U+017F>t any <U+017F>hould mi<U+017F>take, we do not mean that all the Children in this Kingdom which are born of weak and <U+017F>ickly Parents are <U+017F>ubject to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For although if one or both of the Parents be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, the Children will be infirm; yet it is often <U+017F>een that when the Parents have been very <U+017F>trong and healthful, yet their Children have been very <U+017F>ubject to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Wherefore neither do we re<U+017F>t in this <U+017F>econd cau<U+017F>e, but
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169706:113"/>
another mu<U+017F>t yet be enquired out, from whence we may derive a <U+017F>ufficient rea<U+017F>on of the frequency of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
            <p>We affirm therfore in the third place, That the rifene<U+017F>s of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in <hi>England</hi> hath been much promoted, by that long and <U+017F>ecure peace, which we enjoyed before the fir<U+017F>t breaking of it. For by this the more wealthy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which were fir<U+017F>t invaded by this evil, and which doth <U+017F>til infe<U+017F>t them more than others, had addicted them<U+017F>elves to idlene<U+017F>s and a loo<U+017F>e and effeminate life, and therupon they fel into a moi<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>ofter, and degenerate Con<U+017F>titution, and <U+017F>uch as was le<U+017F>s purged and clean<U+017F>ed from excrementitious humors, and by con<U+017F>equence their Children were even procreated obnoxious to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. You wil <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> although they enjoyed peace and <U+017F>ecurity, yet they are <U+017F>eldome ob<U+017F>erved to fal under this Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We an<U+017F>wer,</hi> True it is that <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Northern parts of <hi>England</hi> are le<U+017F>s affected with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> than the Southern and the We<U+017F>tern. In the mean time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure the fir<U+017F>t impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions and rudiments of it are far more frequent in tho<U+017F>e places; yea, and in <U+017F>ome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Countries, then is commonly beleeved. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this evil be very familiar in the South and We<U+017F>t parts of this Kingdom, and very wel known among the Vulgar <U+017F>ort, yet we have many times <U+017F>een Children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with it in a <U+017F>light manner, of whom neither the Parents nor others of the <U+017F>ame family did <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect the lea<U+017F>t evil: Yea, we have known many, whom none of their friends thought to be affected, to be healed without any help of Phy<U+017F>ick by the <U+017F>ole benefit of the increa<U+017F>ed heat, or by the increa<U+017F>e of age or exerci<U+017F>es. How much ea<U+017F>ier therfore may the fir<U+017F>t rudiments of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be

concealed from them, to whom it is le<U+017F>s familiar, and among whom it <U+017F>eldom a<U+017F>cendeth to that degree, that they need to implore the Phy<U+017F>itians help. We conjecture therfore that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is more frequent then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly beleeved both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Northern parts of <hi>England;</hi> yea, and in <U+017F>ome Countries wherin the people are ignorant of it to this day: but in tho<U+017F>e pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they are <U+017F>o gently tormented with it, that they are <U+017F>eldom condemned to the hands of the Phy<U+017F>itian. For that is the cu<U+017F>tome of the Vulgar <U+017F>ort, not to <U+017F>end for the Doctor (e<U+017F>pecially to Infants and yong Children) unle<U+017F>s the vehemency of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> con<U+017F>train them. However the matter is, we <U+017F>eem not yet to have given <U+017F>atisfaction to the objection propounded, <hi>Why the South and We<U+017F>t Country men of</hi> England <hi>are more grievou<U+017F>ly &amp; frequently conflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, then the Northern People and the</hi> Scots, <hi>although both Kingdoms equally <U+017F>hared the ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing of the la<U+017F>ting peace and <U+017F>ecurity.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we grant that a higher rea<U+017F>on yet mu<U+017F>t be given for this difference. Fourthly, therefore and la<U+017F>tly, we <U+017F>ay, That the cau<U+017F>e of this difference is the affluence of all good things in the<U+017F>e Southern and We<U+017F>tern Countries of <hi>England.</hi> For this part of the Kingdom is much the more fruitful, rich and flori<U+017F>hing, and abounding with al manner of allurements to plea<U+017F>ure. Therefore it is no marvail if the cu<U+017F>toms of men do fir<U+017F>t generate here, their Spirits decay, and the <U+017F>trength of their Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve now, that this degenerate and delicate manner of living doth weaken families, is a truth <U+017F>o <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly and con<U+017F>tantly atte<U+017F>ted by Hi<U+017F>torians, that it were an impertinence to offer any proof of it. For you may ob<U+017F>erve that the mo<U+017F>t Noble and Gallant Families have been very much reproached for the<U+017F>e very cau<U+017F>es; yea, and <U+017F>ooner or latter <U+017F>omtimes totally extingui<U+017F>hed, and <U+017F>o much the <U+017F>ooner as they have the more refu<U+017F>ed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo

labors, and to innure them<U+017F>elvs to ma<U+017F>culine exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>es. Neither are families ever plunged in a greater danger of degeneration, then when they abound with al good things, and lying open to plenty and <U+017F>ecurity they are mo<U+017F>t powerfully invited to delicatne<U+017F>s, idlene<U+017F>s and effeminatene<U+017F>s, without any labor, care, and <U+017F>olici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Who was more rich, <U+017F>ecure, and effeminate, than <hi>Solomon?</hi> He left <hi>Rehoboam</hi> a degenerate Son behind him. And perhaps the family of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct for the like cau<U+017F>e. We could heap up almo<U+017F>t innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable examples to prove this, if it were needful. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, we <U+017F>ee plainly, that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth more frequently and vehemently invade the families of the wealthy, than the cottages of poor men, and therfore it ought not to <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange that it likewi<U+017F>e infe<U+017F>ted the richer and more plea<U+017F>anter parts of the Kingdom; nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the South and We<U+017F>t, before the North parts. But the<U+017F>e things <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffice to have been <U+017F>poken concerning this matter. It remaineth only that we enquire, <hi>Whether and how far the three la<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>igned cau<U+017F>es relate to the denomination of a Common Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect of them, this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may be a<U+017F>cribed to</hi> England <hi>as common and Natural?</hi>

            <p>You mu<U+017F>t know then that the<U+017F>e three cau<U+017F>es in as much as they depend upon the Region, are not properly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, neither by their own nature do they produce this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but that they are only an occa<U+017F>ion wherby this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F> may accidentally ari<U+017F>e.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are many differences of the <hi>Rachites</hi> in regard of the concour<U+017F>e of <U+017F>everal evils, and more than any man would ea<U+017F>ily imagine; <U+017F>ome wherof are of great importance, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers le<U+017F>s con<U+017F>iderable we have re<U+017F>olved here briefly to propound the chiefe<U+017F>t. For the knowledg of them is not only profitable to define the <hi>progno<U+017F>tical</hi> cau<U+017F>es, wherby the various events of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> are di<U+017F>tinctly fortold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to tho<U+017F>e differences; but it al<U+017F>o much conduceth both to the prevention and the cure of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; namly, that by a con<U+017F>ideration of them apt and fit remedies may be cho<U+017F>en.</p>
            <p>Now the<U+017F>e differences ari<U+017F>e either from the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, or from the cau<U+017F>es therof: or la<U+017F>tly, from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>es conjoyned with it. The E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many ways: Fir<U+017F>t, By rea<U+017F>on of the parts of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence either pre<U+017F>ent or ab<U+017F>ent. Secondly, In regard of the magnitude of it. Thirdly, In re<U+017F>pect of the vehemence. Fourthly, in regard of the Spirits; And fiftly in re<U+017F>pect of the times.</p>
            <p>We grant indeed, That there is a certain agreement between <U+017F>om differences comprehended under the<U+017F>e ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; yet <U+017F>eing that the formal conceptions of them are di<U+017F>tinct, it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that they de<U+017F>erve di<U+017F>tinct

con<U+017F>iderations. For although a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, even in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry re<U+017F>pect may be called greater, becau<U+017F>e it containeth many parts of the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence in the <U+017F>ame Patient yet this is a different &amp; di<U+017F>tinct con<U+017F>ideration from that of the magnitude of that Affect. For the magnitude pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly hath re<U+017F>pect unto the degree of rece<U+017F>s from the Natural State, and not to the Nature of the part of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence either pre<U+017F>ent or ab<U+017F>ent, for hereupon re<U+017F>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth more then a gradual difference. In like manner <U+017F>ome of the other differences do perhaps <U+017F>ignify the <U+017F>ame thing, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> concrete and re<U+017F>trained acception, which notwith<U+017F>tanding in an ab<U+017F>tracted and formal con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion denote a diver<U+017F>ity. But let us proceed.</p>
            <p>The fir<U+017F>t difference of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth from the pre<U+017F>ence of few or many of the parts of the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence therof. For although all the parts of the Primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence are perpetuàlly pre<U+017F>ent with the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> it <U+017F>elf, yet there is no nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that all the parts of the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence <U+017F>hould be always pre<U+017F>ent. For the<U+017F>e are after-comers to the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, and do by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees come upon it: Yea, <U+017F>ome of them may be <U+017F>o high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercepted by the intervention of re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting cau<U+017F>es that they may not at all appear. Hither you may refer that difference, which we propounded at the foot of the precedent di<U+017F>putation, and which we <U+017F>hewed might po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibly<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> though indeed very rarely, befal tho<U+017F>e that were grown to ful age. But becau<U+017F>e our purpo<U+017F>e here is only to handle the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> as it is incident to Children, we <U+017F>hall be content to pa<U+017F>s by that difference thus noted by the way. But even in Children them<U+017F>elves there <U+017F>omtimes happen <U+017F>ome parts of the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, which have a mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trict conjunction with the Primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, at lea<U+017F>t they <U+017F>ucceed them in the order of Nature. For the Primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence hath the efficacy of a cau<U+017F>e, which in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169706:116"/>
Nature doth ever go before the effect. But in order of time <U+017F>ome parts of the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence do con<U+017F>pire as it were, and concur with the Primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<U+017F>ion; and others again do come afterwards, the<U+017F>e we mu<U+017F>t here di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h. For the former <U+017F>ort are ab<U+017F>olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in<U+017F>eparable, the latter <U+017F>ort <U+017F>eparable from this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>The in<U+017F>eparable parts of the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence may be reduced to the<U+017F>e Heads. Fir<U+017F>t to the afflicted <hi>Tone</hi> of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts. Secondly, to the unequal and imperfect di<U+017F>tribution of the Vital Blood. Thirdly, to the too <U+017F>mal participation of the Vital influx in the fir<U+017F>t affected parts. Fourthly, to the Secondary faults of the Animal Con<U+017F>titution. The<U+017F>e faults are <U+017F>ufficiently unfolded above in our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the Secondary E<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; where likewi<U+017F>e becau<U+017F>e of their <U+017F>trict carriage with the Primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, any man may perceive with ea<U+017F> (though they have a ca<U+017F>ual dependance upon the Primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence) that they begin together at the <U+017F>ame time.</p>
            <p>But al the Organical faults which we have al<U+017F>o already recited, are found to be <U+017F>eparable, and <U+017F>omtimes actually <U+017F>eparate from this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For the magnitude of the Head, and the leanne<U+017F>s of the Joynts, the crookedne<U+017F>s of the Shank-bone, or the Elbow, the inflexions of the Joynts, the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of the Brea<U+017F>t, do not nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily accompany this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> pre<U+017F>ently from the beginning, but in proce<U+017F>s of time they bewray them<U+017F>elves by degrees and <U+017F>upervene upon the Affect. And although the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umption of the parts, which in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into the <U+017F>aid faults, may be <U+017F>aid to be pre<U+017F>ent in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>light degree from the begining of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, yet is it indeed only a Symptom, and not a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; neither is it able pre<U+017F>ently to produce tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,

Figure and Place. Moreover it is not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that the<U+017F>e Organical faults <U+017F>hould equally and at the <U+017F>ame time invade one that hath the <hi>Rachites,</hi> we grant indeed that the extenuation of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, when the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is of <U+017F>ome continuance, doth alwaies and nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily <U+017F>ucceed it, neither can it afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the per<U+017F>everence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be removed, that it is likewi<U+017F>e a principal part of the <U+017F>eparable parts of the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence; yea that the extenuation whil<U+017F>t it is making doth immediatly follow the <U+017F>malne<U+017F>s of nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, almo<U+017F>t no otherwi<U+017F>e than the <U+017F>malne<U+017F>s of nouri<U+017F>hment immediatly followeth the primary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in the <U+017F>aid parts; but withal we affirm that the extenuation being made which is it <U+017F>elf a <U+017F>econdary part of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> wherof we di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>, doth nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the motion and time of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and that it cannot be in the fir<U+017F>t moment of the exi<U+017F>tence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. We <U+017F>ay moreover that Phy<U+017F>itians do not acknowledg any change made in the parts expo<U+017F>ed to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>, which doth not yet appear to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and by con<U+017F>equence they affirm that extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion befalleth the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, til it be made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es which certainly doth nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>require <U+017F>ome duration of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. But the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionat magnitude of the Head, doth begin almo<U+017F>t at the <U+017F>ame time with that extenuation of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, but it may <U+017F>o fall out, if a con<U+017F>uming Phti<U+017F>ick be joyned together with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, that that magnitude of the Head may vani<U+017F>h before death, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved by one example in our <hi>Anatomical Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The Magnitude of the Head therfore is more <U+017F>eparable from this affect than the extenuation of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts, for this cannot be removed without the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be cured. The <U+017F>ticking out of the Bones

The narrowne<U+017F>s of the Brea<U+017F>t doth not appear, but after a long time when the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is confirmed, and for the mo<U+017F>t part is the forerunner of a Pty<U+017F>ick. Again, the crookedne<U+017F>s of the Bone in the Arm, and the Shank-bone, as al<U+017F>o the inflexion of the Joynts may be ab<U+017F>ent through the whol cour<U+017F> of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and may be more or le<U+017F>s pre<U+017F>ent, and indeed is the mo<U+017F>t chanceable among tho<U+017F>e things which follow this affect. We conclude therfore that the<U+017F>e Organical parts of the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence are <U+017F>eparable after that manner as we have <U+017F>aid, and as a more or fewer of them are pre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>o the Difference of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is con<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as being more or le<U+017F>s compounded.</p>
            <p>The Second Difference of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> re<U+017F>ulteth from the magnitude therof. And the magnitude is e<U+017F>timated from the greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er rece<U+017F>s from the natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. There is a va<U+017F>t difference in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in re<U+017F>pect of the magnitude. For <U+017F>ome are <U+017F>o gently affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with it that you would <U+017F>carce <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e them to be <U+017F>ick. They complain of nothing, they eat, they drink, they <U+017F>leep like tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>ound in health; only they play with more unchearfulne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>hew forth <U+017F>ome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very <U+017F>light <U+017F>igns of <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s, By the only benefit of Nature likewi<U+017F>e without any a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tances of Art they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recover, neither their Parents, Nur<U+017F>es, nor the By-<U+017F>tanders <U+017F>o much as once <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting that they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this evil. On the contrary, Others are <U+017F>o vehemently afflicted that they cannot be re<U+017F>cued from death or the danger of imunient death by the mo<U+017F>t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved remedies.</p>
            <p>The Third Difference is from the vehemence of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:169706:118"/>
affect. Now this is valued by the violent motion of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> and the re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of Nature, and al<U+017F>o by the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of the conflict of the<U+017F>e things among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves. This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, although it be otherwi<U+017F>e very great, yet is it <U+017F>low in motion unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome fewer, or <U+017F>ome other urgent affect be conjoyned with it, and <U+017F>tir up the Nature of it to a fiercer oppo<U+017F>ition, yet is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof <U+017F>omtimes more vehement, and <U+017F>omtimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dull, and thereupon it happeneth to be differenced.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Difference, is from the <U+017F>trength of the <U+017F>ick Child or Infant. This is e<U+017F>timated by the greater or le<U+017F><U+017F>er pre<U+017F>ence of tho<U+017F>e things which are according to Nature. Hither belongeth the condition of the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, the plenty of inherent Spirits, the activity and <U+017F>trength of the <hi>Tone,</hi> the vigor of the Vital and Animal Con<U+017F>titution, and the <U+017F>tructure of the Organs. For as the<U+017F>e are more or le<U+017F>s obedient to the pre<U+017F>criptions of Nature, <U+017F>o their Spirits ought to be judged more or le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trong, and according to them the evil mu<U+017F>t be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the more or le<U+017F>s dangerous. For this cau<U+017F> the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Children <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> are more dangerou<U+017F>ly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected than the elder.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Difference, is from the times of the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>. And this difference in a qualified and limited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception includeth almo<U+017F>t all the precedent; for what difference <U+017F>oever hapneth to any Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happen at <U+017F>ome time of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Phy<U+017F>itians reckon up four times of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>: The Begining, the Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, the Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and the Declination. But it mu<U+017F>t be noted that Phy<U+017F>itians are not <U+017F>o exact in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons of things as the Phylo<U+017F>ophers, for they do not re<U+017F>train the beginning of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> to that point of time wherin the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> begineth; but <U+017F>o far they extend it, till there appear <U+017F>o great an alteration
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169706:118"/>
of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, that it may be known by certain and <U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible evidences. For the indivi<U+017F>ible begining is not the time, wherin the Phy<U+017F>itians help is perfected, and why <U+017F>hould that di<U+017F>tinction of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be profitable which could not be grounded upon any alteration of it known to us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> therfore hath rightly deduced the times of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Inflamations from the under<U+017F>tandible alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them: that is, The begining from the crudity of the matter cau<U+017F>ing the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, the augmentation from the manife<U+017F>t coction therof; the <U+017F>tate from the Excretion, and the Declination he computes from the Reduction of the Reliques to the Natural <U+017F>tate; and indeed the<U+017F>e times do <U+017F>weetly agree in the general, and differ in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular from the crudity and coction of Feavers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations. But the truth is, That this di<U+017F>tinction of times hath not the like <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s in many other di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es: For in the<U+017F>e Nature doth not <U+017F>o regularly proceed from crudity to coction, <U+017F>o to expul<U+017F>ion, and at la<U+017F>t to redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; neither by the<U+017F> can we truly and <U+017F>afly know the progre<U+017F>s of the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Other alterations therfore of the<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, <U+017F>uch as are more cleer and ea<U+017F>ily known mu<U+017F>t be weighed. Yet we grant that even the<U+017F> di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es when they are directed to health, do run thorow tho<U+017F>e four <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons, the begining, the augmentation, the <U+017F>tate or con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, and the declination. But when they tend to the de<U+017F>truction of the Patent, they <U+017F>carce attain to the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, but are daily more and more augmented e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the le<U+017F>t period of life. Wherfore in the<U+017F> the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation admitteth the greate<U+017F>t latitude, neither doth it de<U+017F>erv a higher difference, or a lower <U+017F>ubdivi<U+017F>ion: but when an indifferent <U+017F>tate of a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> of the <U+017F>ame kind is made the Middle term between the begining and the end of <U+017F>uch an augmentation, than we can convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169706:119"/>
di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h. The encrea<U+017F> into an augmentation on this <U+017F>ide, or beyond, or beneath, or above the con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tence. An encrea<U+017F> of the fir<U+017F>t kind about the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance we may cal a <hi><U+017F>imple encrea<U+017F>,</hi> in regard that it differeth not from the thing it <U+017F>elf commonly received by that name, an encrea<U+017F> beyond or above the <U+017F>tate, we call an encrea<U+017F> <hi>excre<U+017F>cent, exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive, tran<U+017F>cendent</hi> and <hi>de<U+017F>perate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, Two kinds of declination may be ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. The fir<U+017F>t is legitamate when the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F> <U+017F>imply declineth towards health and recovery. The later is <U+017F>purious, when a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> remitting changeth into another of a different kind. And <U+017F>o although there are in tho<U+017F> that recover health, only four times of a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, yet in others two more differences may be di<U+017F>cerned: Yet it mu<U+017F>t be noted, that the<U+017F> <U+017F>ix times are never to be found in the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, or the <U+017F>ame patient, but where there is the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in the Species in divers <U+017F>ubjects. Let us now apply the<U+017F>e things to the pre<U+017F>ent affect. We affirm therfore that <U+017F>ix differences of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in re<U+017F>pect of the times therof. For it hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and may be called <hi>incipient:</hi> it hath an encrea<U+017F>, and may be <U+017F>aid to be <hi>confirmed;</hi> it hath a <U+017F>tate, and then it it may be termed <hi>con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tant;</hi> it hath an encrea<U+017F>e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <U+017F>tate, and may be called <hi>de<U+017F>perate:</hi> it hath a tru declination, and may be <U+017F>aid to be an affect remiting or <U+017F>imply declining; and it hath a <U+017F>purious declination, and may be called a change, as when it chancheth into <U+017F>om other di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Of al which we wil <U+017F>peak in their order.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, The <hi>Rachites</hi> is called a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> begining, when the fir<U+017F>t Rudiments and impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions thereof are, though very ob<U+017F>curely, fir<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erved, and before there hapneth any manife<U+017F>t extenuation of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is <U+017F>aid to be confirmed, when an evident and manife<U+017F>t extenuation of the fir<U+017F>t affected
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:169706:119"/>
parts becoms obvious to the Sen<U+017F>es. And here the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> perceiveth we do not di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the<U+017F> two times from crudity and coction, but from another alteration of the Body, namly, The Extenuation made in the parts fir<U+017F>t affected; for the begining of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> can no ways be di<U+017F>cerned from the encrea<U+017F> therof by crudity and cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But otherwi<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o far as the nature of the thing is capable of it, we <U+017F>hal willingly follow the example of <hi>Galen,</hi> and as he di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>heth the encrea<U+017F> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining by the manife<U+017F>t coction, <U+017F>o we al<U+017F>o put a different between the<U+017F> times in this affect from a manife<U+017F>t altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namly, the extenuation made in the <U+017F>aid parts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> advanced to its con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, is that, which having attained the highe<U+017F>t vigor and exhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is arre<U+017F>ted, and for a time is neither <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ed, or le<U+017F><U+017F>ened, but continueth at a <U+017F>tand.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> exceeding the Mediocrity of the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance is called de<U+017F>perat, namly, Becau<U+017F> in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and vehemence it <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>eth the very <U+017F>tate of the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in another Patient indifferently affected, and withal is continually encrea<U+017F>ed, neither is there any hope but that it will daily encrea<U+017F> til it hath altogether <U+017F>ubdued and di<U+017F><U+017F>olved the Patient For which cau<U+017F> this condition of a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is termed de<U+017F>perat.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is <U+017F>aid to be truly remitting or declining, when the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence therof is by little and little dimini<U+017F>hed, and when the Signs and Symptoms of it are daily mitigated.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, This di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is <U+017F>aid to be illegitimatly decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing into another di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> of a diver<U+017F> <U+017F>pecies, when the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, Signs and Symptoms therof are <U+017F>o le<U+017F><U+017F>ened, that new ones of a different kind, and perhaps more outragious appear in their <U+017F>tead. Thus the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites</hi> frequently degenerat into a Con<U+017F>umption, a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169706:120"/>
and <U+017F>omtimes perhaps into a <U+017F>low putrid Feaver; yet for the mo<U+017F>t part the <U+017F>ame di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth accompany the<U+017F> <U+017F>upervening affects to the di<U+017F><U+017F>olution of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And let this <U+017F>uffice concerning the differences of this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> deduced from the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence.</p>
            <p>This di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in like manner in re<U+017F>pect of the Cau<U+017F>es is as it were taken into pieces, or divided into parts, namly into a natural affect, and into an after-coming or new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contracted malady. Again, This di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med natural in a twofold <U+017F>en<U+017F><g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> In the fir<U+017F>t properly, As when the Sick is born actually affected with this di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. In the later improperly, when the Patient at his birth is not actually affected with it, but <U+017F>trongly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed by his native principles to fall into it. If it plea<U+017F> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <U+017F>ummon tho<U+017F>e things to his memory which were <U+017F>aid above concerning the cau<U+017F>es of this Effect on the Parents parts, he wil ea<U+017F>ily conceive the rea<U+017F>on and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of this difference, and con<U+017F>equently that wil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>e us from any further explication: Only we ad, that this difference is of great u<U+017F>e in the judicial part of cure, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in applications antidotal and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but it is not of <U+017F>o great moment in the Method of Cure. In like manner this Affect is meerly coming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when being fomented by no Natural di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, it is newly contracted after the birth<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> &amp; here al<U+017F>o it is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. For it either <U+017F>ucceedeth <U+017F>om foregoing Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; or it is immediatly produced by an erroneous u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ix non-Natural things: We have <U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of both, where we hammered out the cau<U+017F>es of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> after the birth, and thither we direct the Reader.</p>
            <p>Again, this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> admitteth <U+017F>om differences by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es wherwith it is conjoyned in the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject. It mu<U+017F>t not be expected that we <U+017F>hould give in a Catalogue of all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, wherwith this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:169706:120"/>
may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be conjoyned, we <U+017F>hal only reckon up tho<U+017F>e which ate the u<U+017F>ual Companions of this Malady<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> Som wherof have a certain dependance upon this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> and the cau<U+017F>es of it; others have not any, or at lea<U+017F>t not any worthy of a di<U+017F>tinct con<U+017F>ideration.</p>
            <p>Of the former kind are a <hi>Hydrocephalus, the faults of breeding Teeth, an A<U+017F>thma, the Pty<U+017F>ick, an Hectik fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a <U+017F>low, and erratical Feaver, and the A<U+017F>cites,</hi> which is that kind of Drop<U+017F>y when water hath gotten between the fle<U+017F>h and the Skin.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hydrocephalus</hi> hath a great corre<U+017F>pondence with this Affect, <U+017F>eing that this Affect al<U+017F>o doth for the mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e an increa<U+017F> of the Head preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally encrea<U+017F>ed, and an overplentiful afflux of the Blood unto the Brain by rea<U+017F>on of the largene<U+017F>s of the Arteries thither extended. And hereupon it ea<U+017F>ily coms to pa<U+017F>s that the Brain being oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the abundance of the Blood, mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>omtimes needs <U+017F>uffer the more <U+017F>erous por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof (as being the mo<U+017F>t permeable) to evaporate or <U+017F>weat out into the Ventricles and cavities within the <hi>Menynges,</hi> and by con<U+017F>equence to produce the Drop<U+017F>y of the Brain. But this, as we have already noted, doth always appear.</p>
            <p>The <hi>faults of breeding of Teeth</hi> al<U+017F>o are <U+017F>omtimes ju<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a<U+017F>cribed to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> going before. For it is well known that they who are affected with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> do commonly breed Teeth with extream pain, and many times the Teeth them<U+017F>elvs fal out by pieces. But we have above reduced this fault to the unequal nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the parts, and there the Reader may find further <U+017F>atisfaction. In the mean time it mu<U+017F>t be ob<U+017F>erved, that a painful breeding of Teeth may likewi<U+017F>e precede this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the force of a cau<U+017F> in reference to this <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent evil, as we have likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hewed above.</p>

Moreover, An <hi>A<U+017F>thma</hi> or difficulty of breathing doth familiarly follow upon this Affect, becau<U+017F>e the Blood is <U+017F>omwhat cooled in his circulation thorow the fir<U+017F>t affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted parts, and is rendred more thick, vi<U+017F>cous, and <U+017F>lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi<U+017F>h in motion, neither is it always perfectly corrected before its return to the right Ventricle of the Heart. Wherupon being unapt for pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, it is powred back from the right Ventricle thorow the Arterious Vein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Lungs, and for that Rea<U+017F>on doth ea<U+017F>ily introduce ob<U+017F>tructions, hard tumors, difficulty of breathing, <U+017F>omtimes inflammations, impo<U+017F>tumes, Ulcers, the Pty<U+017F>ick, the Drop<U+017F>y of the Lungs, a Hectick Feaver, or el<U+017F> a <U+017F>low erratical Feaver.</p>
            <p>An <hi>A<U+017F>cites</hi> is al<U+017F>o <U+017F>omtimes con<U+017F>ociated with this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But whether it proceeds from a copious flowing of the Blood to the Bowels of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> we dare not yet atte<U+017F>t for an undoubted truth. Yet certain it is that the flowing of the Blood to this Belly is very copious and <U+017F>ufficiently active in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For the Liver is great, and the other Bowels are ob<U+017F>erved to be rather more ful than ordinary, than pined away. Wherupon it may happen, that that watry moi<U+017F>ture from the Bowels which are oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with a fulne<U+017F>s may be carried into the hollowne<U+017F>s of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> but we affirm this with a di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful confidence, becau<U+017F>e we have not yet given our <U+017F>elvs ful <U+017F>atisfaction in this matter.</p>
            <p>Neverthele<U+017F>s the<U+017F>e recited Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es may happen to Children although the <hi>Rachites</hi> have not preceded, and may be the cau<U+017F> to introduce it. Yea, they may likewi<U+017F>e com upon this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> from other cau<U+017F>es; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by <U+017F>om errors in the Regiment of health; although in this ca<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o this Affect may be partly guilty, if it went before: And thus much of complicated Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the former kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:169706:121"/>
But of the latter kind, namely, <U+017F>uch as have little or no nependance upon this Affect, are <hi>a malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the French Pox, the Scurvy, and the Strumaticall Affect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t it is certain, That <hi>a Malignant Feaver</hi> may come upon this Affect, becau<U+017F>e for the mo<U+017F>t part it is produced by infection, from which this pre<U+017F>ent Affect leaveth not Children free, we ad only, that this Feaver doth <U+017F>eldom or never ow his Origin to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the <hi>French Pox</hi> chance to be complicated with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, it is either derived from the Nur<U+017F>es in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or from the Parents by Inheritance. For it is a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> altogether Di<U+017F>tinct from this, and hath <U+017F>carce any affinity with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Scurvy</hi> is <U+017F>omtimes conjoyned with this Affect. It is either <hi>hereditary,</hi> or perhaps in <U+017F>o tender a Con<U+017F>titution <hi>contracted by infection,</hi> or la<U+017F>tly, <hi>it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the indi<U+017F>creet and erroneous Regiment of the Infant, and chiefly from the inclemency of the Ayr and Climat where the Child is educated.</hi> For it <U+017F>carce hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any greater commerce with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, then with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of longer continuance, wherin after the <U+017F>ame manner the Blood in time contracteth for the mo<U+017F>t part this peculiar infection, yet it mu<U+017F>t be granted, that this Affect doth <U+017F>omwhat the more di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e to the <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> in regard of the want of motion and exerci<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and la<U+017F>tly, The <hi>Strumatical Affect</hi> doth <U+017F>omtimes a<U+017F><U+017F>ociate this evil. But it is credible that it ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more to other cau<U+017F>es proper unto it, then to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Although we deny not, but this may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>ter <U+017F>om occa<U+017F>ion of invading, in as much as it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the humors more vi<U+017F>cous and gro<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>Some other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es are peradventure <U+017F>omtimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with this, but becau<U+017F>e they happen exceeding

whether it be ab<U+017F>ent, it is ever demon<U+017F>tratively <U+017F>ignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant: When it is pre<U+017F>ent it certainly witne<U+017F><U+017F>eth the <U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the pre<U+017F>ent malady, and being ab<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>heweth that that <U+017F>pecies of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is not pre<U+017F>ent.</p>
            <p>But when we truly and <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly con<U+017F>ider how <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>uch Signs as the<U+017F>e occur and of what u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s con<U+017F>iderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they will prove, the knowledg of them being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trained; we are induced to think of the amplifying of the u<U+017F>ual <U+017F>ignification of the word.

We are compelled therfore that we may fully prevent, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this inconvenience to extend <U+017F>omwhat higher the <U+017F>ignification of a <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> Sign; yet <U+017F>o, as that we wil abate nothing of the Nature and certitude of the <U+017F>ignification.</p>
            <p>Therfore we define a <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> Sign to be <U+017F>omwhat appearing about the Patient, which certainly <hi>and infallibly demon<U+017F>trates the Species of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>,</hi> And in this extended <U+017F>en<U+017F> it may be divided into <hi>a Sign In<U+017F>eparable,</hi> or, <hi>proprium quarto modo, and a Sign Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable;</hi> namely, <hi>as being proper only, Modo <U+017F>ecundo;</hi> to wit, <hi>becau<U+017F> it is competible only to one kind of Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, although not always.</hi> In like manner the <hi>Paththo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnomonical Syndrome,</hi> or <hi>Concour<U+017F> of Symptoms</hi> may be divided into two kinds, re<U+017F>pectively Analogical to tho<U+017F>e
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169706:123"/>
afore<U+017F>aid. For <U+017F>omtimes it beginneth with the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> it <U+017F>elf, and doth in<U+017F>eparably a<U+017F><U+017F>ociate to the very la<U+017F>t peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. So the pricking pain of the <U+017F>ide, and acute Feaver, the difficulty of breathing, and the cough, if they be taken collectively, they are indeed a <hi>Syndrome,</hi> but <U+017F>uch an one as is always equivalent to one <U+017F>imple <hi>Pathogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical</hi> Sign of the fir<U+017F>t kind, and doth in<U+017F>eparably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a Pleuri<U+017F>ie from the fir<U+017F>t beginning to the very end. But <U+017F>omtimes the <hi>Syndrome</hi> or concour<U+017F> of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms is not compleat and perfect from the begining of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, yet afterwards it is made perfect by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the other Signs, and doth infallibly denote, the <U+017F>pecies of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For example, in the <U+017F>mal Pox upon the fir<U+017F>t begining of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, the <hi>Syndrome,</hi> is <U+017F>o incompleat, that it doth not yet certainly determine the <U+017F>pecies of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; but afterwards the Pox break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Skin very thick, and tending to matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the <hi>Syndrome</hi> is fini<U+017F>hed, and the <U+017F>pecies of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is put out of al doubt.</p>
            <p>But that a Sign proper to one Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> alone (although not in the fourth manner) whether it be <U+017F>imple and <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, or compounded of a concour<U+017F> of many together, may <U+017F>uffice, when it is pre<U+017F>ent to make a Sign truly <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thognomonical:</hi> It is manife<U+017F>t from hence, becau<U+017F>, when it is pre<U+017F>ent, it doth as certainly and infallibly denote the <U+017F>pecies of the Affect, as a Sign doth, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the fourth manner. For that which agreeth to one <U+017F>pecies only, when it is pre<U+017F>ent, doth nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily infer the pre<U+017F>ence of that <U+017F>pecies al<U+017F>o. Although therfore that a Sign proper in the <U+017F>econd manner, be not In<U+017F>eparable, and where it is ab<U+017F>ent, doth not determine the ab<U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, as a Sign doth proper in the fourth man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; yet when it is pre<U+017F>ent, it is as we have <U+017F>aid of the <U+017F>ame valu and certainty. For Phy<U+017F>itians do e<U+017F>teem the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169706:123"/>
dignity of the Sign by the certainty of the <U+017F>ignification. For to that purpo<U+017F>e they enquire out the <U+017F>igns of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F>, that they may attain to a certain knowledg therof. Therfore <U+017F>eing that Signs proper in the <U+017F>econd manner are equivalent in re<U+017F>pect of their certainty, when they pre<U+017F>ent to Signs proper in the fourth manner: we <U+017F>hall here comprehend them under the extended <U+017F>ignification of <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> Signs.</p>
            <p>You may <U+017F>ay after this manner many after appearing Signs may be reduced to the <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> and are confounded with them. Be it <U+017F>o, provided that they do infallibly denote the <U+017F>pecies of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For in this re<U+017F>pect they are worthy to be <U+017F>evered from the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appearing Signs, neither wil any confu<U+017F>ion follow hereupon in the method of the <U+017F>emeiotical art, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the valu and dignity of the Signs wil by that means be more plainly and ea<U+017F>ily ob<U+017F>erved.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Synedremontal</hi> or <hi>a<U+017F><U+017F>ident</hi> Signs we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of moment to <U+017F>ay, but wil directly proceed to the Signs them<U+017F>elvs as they are to be reduced into order. Yet no exact method mu<U+017F>t be expected from us, becau<U+017F>e for the mo<U+017F>t part the Signs flow from <U+017F>o many <U+017F>everal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that they wil <U+017F>carce <U+017F>uffer them<U+017F>elvs to be mar<U+017F>hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into any accurate order.

For if Children be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>ted within the fir<U+017F>t year of their age or therabouts, they go upon their feet later by rea<U+017F>on of that weakne<U+017F>s, and for the mo<U+017F>t part they <U+017F>peak before they walk, which among<U+017F>t us Engli<U+017F>h men, is vulgarly held to be a bad <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
               </hi> But if they be afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, after they have begun to walk, by degrees they <U+017F>tand more and more feebly upon their legs, and they often <U+017F>tagger as they are going, and <U+017F>tumble upon every <U+017F>light occa<U+017F>ion: neither are they able to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain them<U+017F>elvs long upon their legs without <U+017F>itting, or to move and play up and down with an u<U+017F>ual alacrity, til they have re<U+017F>ted.

            <p>Thirdly, A kind of <U+017F>lothfulne<U+017F>s and numbne<U+017F>s doth invade the Joynts pre<U+017F>ently after the begining of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and by little and little is increa<U+017F>ed, <U+017F>o that day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are more and more aver<U+017F>e from motion. The Yonger Children who are carried about in their Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es arms, when they are delighted and plea<U+017F>ed with any thing do not laugh <U+017F>o heartily, neither do they <U+017F>tir them<U+017F>elvs with <U+017F>o much vigor, and <U+017F>hake and brandi<U+017F>h their little Joynts, as if they were de<U+017F>irous to leap out of of their Nur<U+017F>es hands, al<U+017F>o when they are angred they do not kick <U+017F>o fiercely, neither do they cry with <U+017F>o much fiercene<U+017F>s as tho<U+017F>e who are in health. Being grown grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and committed to their feet, they run up and down with a wayward unchearfulne<U+017F>s, they are <U+017F>oon weary, and they love to play rather <U+017F>itting then <U+017F>tanding, neither when they <U+017F>it, do they erect their body with vigor, but they bend it <U+017F>omtimes forwards, <U+017F>omtimes backwards, and <U+017F>omtimes on either <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>eeking <U+017F>om props to lean upon that may gratify their <U+017F>lothfulne<U+017F>s. They are not delighted like other Children with the agitation of their bodies, or any violent motion; yea, when the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> prevaileth they are aver<U+017F> from all motion of their limbs: crying as they are at any play that is never <U+017F>o little vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and being plea<U+017F>ed again with gentle u<U+017F>age and quiet re<U+017F>t. In the interim, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>om other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or cau<U+017F> of <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s doth com between, they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in <U+017F>leeping and waking, they are ingenious, not <U+017F>tupid, but for the mo<U+017F>t part of forward wits, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>om other im pediments ari<U+017F>e, their countenances are much more compo<U+017F>ed and <U+017F>evere than their age requireth, as if they were intent and ruminating upon <U+017F>om <U+017F>erious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

The<U+017F>e Signs being taken together, unle<U+017F>s they re<U+017F>ult from <U+017F>ome evident warine<U+017F>s, or proceed from <U+017F>ome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary affect of the Brain (which indeed hapneth very <U+017F>eldom in this tenderne<U+017F>s of age) do con<U+017F>titute a <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Pothognomonical</hi> Syndrom of the fir<U+017F>t kind, &amp; where they are pre<U+017F>ent together, they certainly witne<U+017F>s the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, &amp; when they are ab<U+017F>ent together they infallibly atte<U+017F>t the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. But if at any time a weari<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s do bewray any Feaveri<U+017F>h, or any other like Signs, they may ea<U+017F>ily be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from the<U+017F>e, both becau<U+017F>e the rea<U+017F>ons of the wearine<U+017F>s have gone before, and al<U+017F>o becau<U+017F>e the Signs from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>ing do <U+017F>uddenly break out, and a<U+017F><U+017F>oon vani<U+017F>h.

Now the primary Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Brain are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by their proper Signs. And thus much of the Signs which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Animal Actions.</p>

               <p>Of how great moment the <hi>Alogotrophy,</hi> or unequal Nouri<U+017F>hment of the Parts is in this affect, we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <U+017F>hewed; we <U+017F>hall here therfore pro<U+017F>ecute tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>igns which in <U+017F>ome great mea<U+017F>ure depend upon it, and we <U+017F>hall pre<U+017F>ent them as if they were to be beheld at one View.</p>
               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, there appeareth the unu<U+017F>ual bigne<U+017F>s of the Head, and the fulne<U+017F>s and lively complexion of the Face, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the other parts of the Body. But although this Sign may pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome motion of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it <U+017F>hine out, yet is the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>cure before the appearance of it, that it is accounted in a manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceivable:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:169706:125"/>
Therfore commonly this Sign <U+017F>heweth it <U+017F>elf more or le<U+017F>s from the fir<U+017F>t beginning, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth till the departure of the affect, unle<U+017F>s (as we have noted before) the pining of tho<U+017F>e parts <U+017F>upervene from <U+017F>ome other cau<U+017F>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Fle<U+017F>hy parts, e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e which are full of Mu<U+017F>cles beneath the Head which we have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ted among the fir<U+017F>t affected, in the progre<U+017F>s of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> are dayly more and more worn away, made thin and lean. This Sign doth not pre<U+017F>ently <U+017F>hew it <U+017F>elf from the begining of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, becau<U+017F> it pre-requireth <U+017F>ome notable motion of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> before it evidently appeareth; yet in time it mo<U+017F>t certainly is expo<U+017F>ed to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, and accompanieth the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> to the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>tep be it either to life or death; excellently demon<U+017F>trating the motion and degree of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> by its encrea<U+017F>. Moreover this Sign being conjoyned with the former doth at lea<U+017F>t con<U+017F>titute a <hi>Pathognomonical</hi> Sign of the <U+017F>econd kind, that is <U+017F>uch an one as is proper to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> alone; and where they are pre<U+017F>ent together they infallibly denote the pre<U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, although upon their ab<U+017F>ence they do not equally <U+017F>ignifie the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Certain <U+017F>wellings and knotty excre<U+017F>cences, about <U+017F>ome of the joynts are ob<U+017F>erved in this affect; the<U+017F>e are chiefly con<U+017F>picuous in the Wre<U+017F>ts, and <U+017F>omwhat le<U+017F>s in the Ankles. The like Tumors al<U+017F>o are in the tops of the Ribs where they are conjoyned w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> grizles in the Brea<U+017F>t. We have noted abov in our Anatomical Ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that the<U+017F>e tumors are not <U+017F>cituated in the Parts, but in the very Bones; although this con<U+017F>ideration doth <U+017F>carce belong to them as Signs, <U+017F>eing that of them<U+017F>elves they are <U+017F>earce con<U+017F>picuous. This Sign doth al<U+017F>o <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome kind of motion of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, neither is it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169706:126"/>
emergent a <hi>Principio principiante,</hi> as the Phylo<U+017F>ophers phra<U+017F>e it, yet it offers it <U+017F>elf as an object to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es <U+017F>ooner than any con<U+017F>iderable extenuation of the parts. But where it is pre<U+017F>ent, it con<U+017F>titutes a <hi>Pathognomical</hi> Sign of the Second kind, and without di<U+017F>pute witne<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth the Species of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Some Bones wax crooked, e<U+017F>pecially the Bones called the Shank-bone, and the Fibula or the <U+017F>mall Bone in the Leg, then afterwards the greater Shank-bone, and the undermo<U+017F>t and le<U+017F><U+017F>er of the two long Bones of the Elbow, but not <U+017F>o much altogether nor <U+017F>o often; <U+017F>omtimes al<U+017F>o the Thigh-bone and the Shoulder-bone. Again, there is <U+017F>omtimes ob<U+017F>erved a certain <U+017F>hortning of the Bones and a defective growth of them in re<U+017F>pect of their longitude. This by chance was omitted above, where we gave the Rea<U+017F>on of the Organical faults. Yet this affect doth <U+017F>eem to depend upon the <U+017F>ame irregular nouri<U+017F>hment; namely <U+017F>o far forth as the nouri<U+017F>hment taken in encrca<U+017F>eth the Bones according to breadth and thickne<U+017F>s more than length. From hence it comes to pa<U+017F>s that <U+017F>ome Children long afflicted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> become Dwarfs. Hither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be referred that folding in the Wre<U+017F>ts, the Skin it may be having better nouri<U+017F>hment and more growth than the Bones of tho<U+017F>e parts, wherupon it mu<U+017F>t needs be contracted in the Wre<U+017F>ts into a folding or wrinkledne<U+017F>s. Finally, to this place al<U+017F>o may belong a certain <U+017F>ticking out of the Bones of the Head, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Bone of the forehead forwards. For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the common kind of viciated Figure and the <hi>Alogotrophy</hi> of the Bones. Yet this in the Bone of the Forehead doth evidently <U+017F>eem to depend upon the free nouri<U+017F>hment of that Bone in his circumference, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is coupled to the Bones of the fore part of the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:169706:126"/>
Head, and con<U+017F>titutes that <U+017F>eam called <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tura Coronalis,</hi> which lieth in the foremo<U+017F>t parts therof. For herupon it mu<U+017F>t needs be thru<U+017F>t forwards. And indeed in that place it is plentifully nouri<U+017F>hed without any difficulty, becau<U+017F> this Bone in Children is cartilagineous towards that Seam. And this al<U+017F>o was pretermitted above where we di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of the Organical faultine<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F> we have but lately ob<U+017F>erved it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Teeth come forth both <U+017F>lowly and with trouble, they grow loo<U+017F> upon every <U+017F>light occa<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>omtimes they wax black, and even fall out by pieces. In their <U+017F>tead new ones come again though late and with much pain. This kind of Sign, as al<U+017F>o that which we noted in the former Article, may be referred to the <hi>Synedremontal</hi> Signs, becau<U+017F> neither of the<U+017F>e is either perpetually pre<U+017F>ent, or if it be pre<U+017F>ent, it doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly confirm the pre<U+017F>ence of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
               <p>Some have imagined that the Bones in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> are transfigurable like wax; But we have never <U+017F>een it, neither have we received it from any eye witne<U+017F>s who was not of <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected credit. Wherfore we reject this Sign as altogether Fabulous.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Brea<U+017F>t in the higher progre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, becomes narrow on the <U+017F>ides, and <U+017F>ticking up foreright, <U+017F>o that it may not be unaptly compared to the Keel of a Ship inverted, or the the Brea<U+017F>t of a Hen or Capon. For on each <U+017F>ide of the middle it ri<U+017F>eth up into a point, the <U+017F>ides being as it were pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed down. If any demand whether this Sign be <U+017F>olely apropriated and peculiar to this affect; We an<U+017F>wer, That the Brea<U+017F>t may be a little encrea<U+017F>ed in an Atrophy or Phti<U+017F>ick, and le<U+017F>s than the other parts of the Body, and <U+017F>o by con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it may be narrower: but it can <U+017F>carce <U+017F>o fall out according to the change of the Figure without an
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:169706:127"/>
                  <hi>Alogotrophy,</hi> namely that which is proper to this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>. Wherfore this Sign al<U+017F>o when it is pre<U+017F>ent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the inva<U+017F>ion of it be tardy mu<U+017F>t be reputed a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thognomonical</hi> Sign of the <U+017F>econd kind, becau<U+017F> when it is pre<U+017F>ent, it certainly denoteth the Species of the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>, though not on the contrary. And thus much of the Signs which have reference to the unequal nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

This perhaps is a <hi>pathognomonical</hi> <U+017F>ign, although it be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be ob<U+017F>erved, and indeed not yet <U+017F>ufficiently <U+017F>ifted by us.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E <U+017F>hal in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in the <U+017F>ame Method we propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded above, wher we di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, who<U+017F>e Signs we now enquire after. We have above deduced five differences from the very E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. The fir<U+017F>t was <U+017F>eparable from the parts of the Secondary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence, whether they were pre<U+017F>ent or ab<U+017F>ent. But no other Signs mu<U+017F>t be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected be<U+017F>ides the very pars <hi>pre<U+017F>ent</hi> or <hi>ab<U+017F>ent,</hi> which of them<U+017F>elvs are <U+017F>ubjected to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, and therfore they are numbred among the <hi>Diagno<U+017F>tical</hi> Signs in the <U+017F>econd Cla<U+017F><U+017F>is in in the precedent Chapter.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd difference was from the magnitude of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; the <U+017F>igns of this are many and great, or few and gentle and pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>igns; namely, to be fetched from among the <hi>Diagno<U+017F>tical</hi> Signs above de<U+017F>cribed.</p>
            <p>The third difference was taken from the vehemence of the affect. This is di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by <hi>the <U+017F>low or quick encrea<U+017F> of the</hi> Diagno<U+017F>tical <hi>Signs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth was from the <U+017F>trength of the Sick; we have <U+017F>hewed the way to judg of the <U+017F>trength above: But the difference of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> ari<U+017F>ing from hence hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect unto the <hi>danger,</hi> and therfore we refer the Signs therof to the <hi>Progno<U+017F>ticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth difference was deduced from the times of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:169706:129"/>
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. In which re<U+017F>pect we have above reckoned up <U+017F>ix divers apparitions of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>: to wit, <hi>The begining, the encrea<U+017F>, the <U+017F>tate or con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, the encrea<U+017F> beyond the State, the true declination, the <U+017F>uperious declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing into another affect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It mu<U+017F>t be known that the beginning of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, be<U+017F>ides the <U+017F>igns that difference this time from the encrea<U+017F>e, doth likewi<U+017F>e require <U+017F>ome peculiar Signs of the pre<U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>: for it is a time of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>curity, wherin the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth as it were lurk and hide it <U+017F>elf, neither can an unattentive and in expert Phy<U+017F>itian ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h it from the <hi>Diagno<U+017F>tical</hi> Signs above reher<U+017F>ed. For by this time mo<U+017F>t of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agno<U+017F>tical</hi> Signs afore<U+017F>aid do not yet openly break forth; and <U+017F>uch as make a di<U+017F>covery of them<U+017F>elves, pre<U+017F>ent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>ome ob<U+017F>cure impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions to the Phy<U+017F>itians Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therfore the indication of this time requires an accurate and <hi>peculiar collection of the fir<U+017F>t appearing Signs, and a diligent con<U+017F>ideration of them;</hi> but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, be<U+017F>ides the <hi>Diagno<U+017F>tical</hi> Signs above gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, want only a difference among them<U+017F>elves, which is performed by an ea<U+017F>ie indu<U+017F>try. Wherfore in the fir<U+017F>t place we will declare the Signs of the pre<U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, being newly begun or rather beginning, and then the difference between that and the encrea<U+017F>.</p>

               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, <hi>Diligent Ob<U+017F>ervation mu<U+017F>t be employed about the three kinds of Signs a<U+017F>cribed above to the Animal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> namely, the loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s of the parts, the weakne<U+017F>s and languidne<U+017F>s, the <U+017F>lothfulne<U+017F>s and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s. For the<U+017F>e do in a remi<U+017F>s degree, and <U+017F>ubob<U+017F>curely
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:169706:129"/>
yield advantage to circum<U+017F>pection and heedfulne<U+017F>s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently a <hi>principio principiante,</hi> as they phra<U+017F>e it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The colour mu<U+017F>t be con<U+017F>idered, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Head and Face in relation to the Joynts.</hi> For if the colour or the habit be more fre<U+017F>h and lively in tho<U+017F>e than in the<U+017F>e, it pre<U+017F>enteth a <U+017F>trong <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> hath taken root. For although the Bulk of the Head which is evidently encrea<U+017F>ed, and al<U+017F>o the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of the parts affected do pre-require <U+017F>ome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable motion and duration of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> before they appear, yet from the beginning a certain difference may be ob<U+017F>erved by an accurate attention or intuition in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect of the heat and the habit of the<U+017F>e parts compared one with another.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Wre<U+017F>ts and the extremities of the Ribs mu<U+017F>t be noted.</hi> For before the end of the beginning cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rudiments of knurls or knots begin to appear in the Wre<U+017F>ts, and Excre<U+017F>cencies al<U+017F>o in the tops of the Ribs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>A kind of <U+017F>welled fulne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>tretching the Belly</hi> is con<U+017F>picuous immediately after the beginning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially in the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> parts. For the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Belly compared with the magnitude of the Brea<U+017F>t exceeds the ju<U+017F>t and due proportion.</p>
               <p>Now the<U+017F>e Signs collectively taken do a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<U+017F>trate the pre<U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> even from the very beginning. But if no <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and manife<U+017F>t extenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts do appear at the <U+017F>ame time, in that very re<U+017F>pect it is cleerly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from the encrea<U+017F> therof.</p>
               <p>The Signs of the other times are with ea<U+017F> differenced from one another by the de<U+017F>criptions of tho<U+017F>e times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready laid down; yet becau<U+017F> they may point to this place, and be di<U+017F>patched in a word, we <U+017F>hall not decline the Annotation of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:169706:130"/>
All tho<U+017F>e Signs which appeared at the beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more inten<U+017F>e and evident in the encrea<U+017F> of the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>, and many other and more grievous are daily accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated. This time, as hath been <U+017F>aid, is di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed by the manife<U+017F>t extenuation of the fir<U+017F>t affected parts; but after the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence by the continual aggravation of the Symptoms and Signs afore<U+017F>aid.</p>
               <p>In the State of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> the Signs and Symptoms are mo<U+017F>t outragious and con<U+017F>picuous. But <U+017F>o long as this time la<U+017F>teth it neither manife<U+017F>tly encrea<U+017F>eth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>eth.</p>
               <p>In the encrea<U+017F> beyond the State, the Signs and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms exceed that condition which they retained in the indifferent State, <hi>both in re<U+017F>pect of their magnitude and vehemence, and likewi<U+017F>e in re<U+017F>pect of the dejection of the Spirits, and from that time forwards they dayly grow wor<U+017F>e and wor<U+017F>e;</hi> for which con<U+017F>iderations this time is di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed, as well from the ordinary encrea<U+017F>, as from the means of the con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence.</p>
               <p>But in a true declination <hi>A kind of <U+017F>imple remi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Symptoms and Signs tending to a perfect re<U+017F>taura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health</hi> begins to di<U+017F>cover it <U+017F>elf; no other Signs of the inva<U+017F>ion of any other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> appearing.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, in a <U+017F>purious and illegitimate decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Other Signs of a new and <U+017F>ucceeding affect are involved and complicated with the Signs and Symptoms of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>:</hi> and the<U+017F>e are di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed according to the various condition therof, and mu<U+017F>t be fetched from their proper Fountains, and ought not to be expected here. Moreover, if any particular Signs of any of the<U+017F>e times do occur, which concern the event of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, they mu<U+017F>t be re<U+017F>erved among the <hi>Progno<U+017F>ticks;</hi> and thus much of the Signs of the Differences of this affect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence therof.</p>

                  <hi>Fir<U+017F>t,</hi> If the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> cannot be imputed to any weak or di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed Con<U+017F>titution of the Parents, or their manner of life, or the errors of their cu<U+017F>toms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If no debility appeared pre<U+017F>ently after the Birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> began when the Child was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove eighteen months old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the Brothers and Si<U+017F>ters were free from the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If any notorious errors were committed about the Child after the Birth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>If any Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> went before which might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion a <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition that this followed it.</hi> If there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of mo<U+017F>t or all of the<U+017F>e Signs, they do <U+017F>ufficiently
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:169706:131"/>
witne<U+017F>s that this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t not be attributed to any Natural Infection, but to the future Errors and Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities. And thus much of the differences of this Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e in re<U+017F>pect of the Cau<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>La<U+017F>tly, Som differences happen to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, wherewith they are peradventure complicated; in which ca<U+017F>e, be<U+017F>ides the <hi>Diagno<U+017F>tical</hi> <U+017F>igns already reckoned, <U+017F>ome other may be de<U+017F>ired as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly proper to the complicated Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Neverthele<U+017F>s an accurat De<U+017F>cription of them cannot be here expected, becau<U+017F> for the mo<U+017F>t part they are the <U+017F>ame which are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where artributed to tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es by practical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But becau<U+017F> <U+017F>om Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es do more frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company this than others, we wil briefly look into their Signs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir<U+017F>t therfore a</hi> Hydrocephalus <hi>or Drop<U+017F>ie in the Head being complicated with this Affect needeth <U+017F>omtimes no <U+017F>igns to make it known, but is <U+017F>ufficiently, yea abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manife<U+017F>t of it <U+017F>elf: namly, either by</hi> the exceeding mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the Head, <hi>or</hi> by the water that is outwardly contained under the Pericranium <hi>(which notwith<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e doth very rarely happen) or</hi> by <U+017F>om ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream opening and widene<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>eams in the Head, Water having gotten into them, and lifting up the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> <U+017F>o that a <U+017F>oft and wateri<U+017F>h tumor is outwardly perceivable by the touch in the <U+017F>paces between the Bones. <hi>Many times the</hi> Hydrocephalus <hi>is <U+017F>omwhat ob<U+017F>cure and requireth <U+017F>igns to di<U+017F>cover it. Fir<U+017F>t,</hi> Therfore all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward <U+017F>en<U+017F>es are more dull than otherwi<U+017F>e they u<U+017F>e to be in this effect. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The magnitude of the Head is <U+017F>omtimes greater than at other times. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The <hi>Sutures,</hi> or <U+017F>eams in the accu<U+017F>tomed places do gape more wide, and are clo<U+017F>ed again more <U+017F>lowly than they are wont to be. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Bone in the Forehead is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169706:132"/>
more outwardly <U+017F>ticking out, and in the other Bones of the Head you may ob<U+017F>erve certain inequalities and bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings out of an unu<U+017F>ual bigne<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The conjoyned evils of breeding Teeth are thus known. <hi>1.</hi> If the accu<U+017F>tomed time of breeding Teeth be either approching, or now at hand; <hi>for from hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>eth <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition of pain from thence proceeding. This time ordinarily begineth in the <U+017F>eventh month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the birth, and continueth til the Child be a year and <U+017F>ix months old, and longer, if the Teeth come <U+017F>lowly; which hapneth very commonly in this affect; and it endeth when the number of the Teeth is compleat. 2. Children to mitigat the raging pain do u<U+017F>e</hi> to put their Fingers into their Mouths, <hi>according to that old <U+017F>aying,</hi> ubi dolor ibi Digitus. <hi>3.</hi> The Gums wax white on that <U+017F>ide where the Tooth is to break out, and are <U+017F>omwhat hot in the touch. <hi>4.</hi> The Teeth that come forth <U+017F>ometimes wax black or are loo<U+017F>, or fal out by pieces. <hi>5.</hi> To the<U+017F>e you may ad watchings, the loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the Belly, Feavers and Convul<U+017F>ions, <hi>which notwith<U+017F>tanding are chanceable Symptoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An A<U+017F>thma is perceived by the very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing, <hi>when it doth not proceed from the <U+017F>tretching and fulne<U+017F>s of the lowe<U+017F>t Belly. But if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al there be a</hi> <U+017F>welling <hi>or</hi> Impo<U+017F>thum, &amp; that in either <U+017F>ide of the Lungs, they can <U+017F>carce endure to lie on the contrary <U+017F>ide; <hi>but</hi> if it be on both <U+017F>ides, then they de<U+017F>ire to lie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or with their Faces upwards. <hi>The <U+017F>ame thing for the mo<U+017F>t part hapneth</hi> in an Inflamation, with a growing together of the Lungs with the Pleura, <hi>as al<U+017F>o in a</hi> Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>ie, <hi>but</hi> then there are added, an acute Feaver, a Cough and <U+017F>pitting of Bloud, <hi>moreover in a Pluri<U+017F>ie</hi> a pricking pain in the Side. <hi>The</hi> Phti<U+017F>ick <hi>is known</hi> by a diuturnal Cough, and a roundi<U+017F>h and <U+017F>omtimes a purulent <U+017F>pittle
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169706:132"/>
                  <hi>(although indeed Children do <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>pit out, becau<U+017F> that matter which the Cough fetches up into the Mouth they <U+017F>wallow by the oe<U+017F>phagus) al<U+017F>o</hi> by a putrid Feaver conjoyned, and by a <U+017F>udden Colliquation in the parts. An A<U+017F>cites <hi>is di<U+017F>covered</hi> by the unrea<U+017F>onable bigne<U+017F>s of the Abdomen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Hectick Feaver <hi>bewrayeth it <U+017F>elf</hi> by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual heat, being <U+017F>omwhat more vehement than that in a Quotidian Ague, <hi>e<U+017F>pecially</hi> about the Arteries, and <U+017F>til encrea<U+017F>eth after the receiving of meat; <hi>al<U+017F>o</hi> by the <U+017F>wift and <U+017F>peedy con<U+017F>umption of the parts: a putrid fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is known by the urin being at the begining cude, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards more concocted, then al<U+017F>o from the extream high color of it. <hi>Moreovor,</hi> if it be an intermitting A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, it is di<U+017F>cernable by the inequality of the heat, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts being at the begining extream cold, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive hot; <hi>al<U+017F>o</hi> from the fits either con<U+017F>tant or erratical; <hi>again,</hi> by the contraction of the Pul<U+017F> upon the approach of the fit, afterwards unduly encrea<U+017F>ed. A continual Feaver is known by an inten<U+017F>ive and un-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting heat, <hi>al<U+017F>o</hi> by thir<U+017F>t, roughne<U+017F>s of the Mouth, and the altered color of the Tongue, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Venerious Pox is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed <hi>to meet in complication,</hi> if either of the Parents or the Nur<U+017F> were before infected; if any ulers appear in the Head, Mouth and No<U+017F>trils; or if any eminent and cru<U+017F>ted Wheals break out, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch as ordinary Medicins cannot <U+017F>ubdue<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> if hard tumors grow con<U+017F>picuous, or knots defiling the Bones in the Fingers with rottenne<U+017F>s, or any other parts; if unquietne<U+017F>s and bitter pains in the night-time alarum the <U+017F>ick; or if Buboes break out in the Groyn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, The</hi> Scurvy <hi>complicated with this affect hath the<U+017F>e <U+017F>igns: 1.</hi> They that labor under this affect do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently endure Purgations; but they who are only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169706:133"/>
with the <hi>Rachites</hi> do ea<U+017F>ily tolerate the <U+017F>ame. <hi>2.</hi> They are much offended with violent exerci<U+017F>es, neither can they at all endure them. <hi>But although in this affect alone, ther be a kind of <U+017F>lothfulne<U+017F>s and aver<U+017F>ation from exerci<U+017F>e, yet exerci<U+017F>e doth not <U+017F>o manife<U+017F>tly, at lea<U+017F>t not altogether <U+017F>o manife<U+017F>tly hurt them, as when the</hi> Scurvy <hi>is conjoyned with the</hi> Rachites. <hi>3.</hi> upon any concitated and vehement motion they draw not breath without much difficulty, they are vexed with diver<U+017F> pains run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through their Joynts, and the<U+017F>e they give warning of by their crying, the motion of the Pul<U+017F> is frequent and unequal, and <U+017F>omtimes they are troubled with a Falpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Heart, or threatned with a Lypothymie, which Affects ar for the mo<U+017F>t part <U+017F>oon mitigated, or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether apea<U+017F>ed by laying them down to the re<U+017F>t. <hi>4.</hi> Tumors do very commonly appear in the Gums. <hi>5.</hi> The urin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ab<U+017F>ence of the accu<U+017F>tomed Feaver is much more inten<U+017F> and encrea<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>The Strumatical Affect,</hi> if extreamly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with the <hi>Rachites,</hi> is <U+017F>ufficiently con<U+017F>picuous <hi>by Swellings obvious to the <U+017F>en<U+017F>es;</hi> yea, where many knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Excre<U+017F>cences do outwardly occur, it may be ju<U+017F>tly <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pected that the like Tumors do lurk in the Bowels. But if the knots grow inwardly only, they are <U+017F>carce di<U+017F>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by any certain <U+017F>ign; for that Rule which <U+017F>ome have ob<U+017F>erved, namly, That tho<U+017F>e who have <U+017F>hort Necks, low and narrow Forheads, with compre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Temples, and wide Cheek-bones, are <U+017F>ubject to the<U+017F>e <U+017F>trumatical Tumors and Excre<U+017F>cencies, is too uncertain and fallible; Others affirm, That Purging Medicines taken otherwi<U+017F>e in a ju<U+017F>t proportion will <U+017F>carce work with tho<U+017F>e who are thus affected; but we an<U+017F>wer from our own Experience That it is <U+017F>omtimes only, and not alwaies true. Thus much of the <U+017F>igns of the differences.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXIII. The Progno<U+017F>tical Signs in the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> of the <hi>Rachites.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in its <hi>kind is not mortal,</hi> yea <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is <U+017F>o light and gentle, as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren affected therwith have been re<U+017F>tored to health by the <U+017F>ole benefit of Age, the Vital heat being encrea<U+017F>ed and <U+017F>ummoned forth to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts by the force of frequent Exerci<U+017F>es. Yet it <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <U+017F>o vehemently prevaileth, that the iminent danger of life can <U+017F>carce, yea <U+017F>omtimes cannot be prevented by the be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t prudent applications. Wherfore it is very nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that a Phy<U+017F>itian <U+017F>hould fir<U+017F>t diligently contemplat the Progno<U+017F>tical <U+017F>igns of a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, that hemay be the better in<U+017F>tructed to for<U+017F>ee the <U+017F>everal events of it. But in general tho<U+017F>e things which abet the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, that is, all <U+017F>uch things as war again<U+017F>t Nature, require a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary con<U+017F>ideration, and as the<U+017F> are the <U+017F>tronger and they the weaker, <U+017F>o much the more grievous and pernitious is the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. But becau<U+017F> it is not obvious to every one to give an accurate Judgment of Particulars from this General Admonition, it will not be impertinent or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to in<U+017F>ert <U+017F>om particular and <U+017F>pecial Rules and Ob<U+017F>ervations hitherto belonging.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, <hi>This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> properly Natural, or that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeth before the birth, is the mo<U+017F>t dangerous, and <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if ever, end in health.</hi> For it argueth a deprivation
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:169706:134"/>
of the Seminary principles, and by con<U+017F>equence that the Spirits are very infirm; be<U+017F>ides it in<U+017F>inuateth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency in the cau<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The more early the inva<U+017F>ion is after the Birth, the more dangerous <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F> is: <hi>for the Spirits are <U+017F>o much the weaker. In like manner,</hi> The Elder Children, and <U+017F>uch as go up and down, are more ea<U+017F>ily cured then yong Infants that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not u<U+017F>e their legs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> improperly <U+017F>o called; <hi>nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which in part dependeth upon the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclination,</hi> is more dangerous than that Which is contracted by the meer error of the Nur<U+017F>e or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> proceeding from <U+017F>om other fore-going Affects, is more dangerous than that which is introduced by an erroneous Regiment of health; <hi>For it implyeth a precedent dejection of the Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Som have ob<U+017F>erved,</hi> That Infants who have had red Haird women to their Nur<U+017F>es, have been mo<U+017F>t obnoxious to this Affect. <hi>Yet we indeed <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect this rule of <U+017F>om fallability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Some affirm, <hi>That Girls are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently infe<U+017F>ted with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> than Boys, and more ea<U+017F>ily cured.</hi> The truth is, we have not yet had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny un<U+017F>u<U+017F>pected experience of this. Yet we grant that Girls are of a more cold and moi<U+017F>t tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which holdeth the greate<U+017F>t corre<U+017F>pondency with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and for that rea<U+017F>on probable it is that the Female Sex may be affected with the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cau<U+017F>es, and for the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on al<U+017F>o be the <U+017F>ooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tored.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth chiefly invade the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:169706:134"/>
               <hi>of the Gentry, e<U+017F>pecially, of tho<U+017F>e who live at ea<U+017F>, and fare deliciou<U+017F>ly; then of the poorer <U+017F>ort,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of the manifold and various errors which nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity introduceth as wel in the diet of the Parents, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of their Children; but it findeth the mo<U+017F>t diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult acce<U+017F>s unto tho<U+017F>e <hi>who are priviledged from <U+017F>uch a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aults by a mediocrity of fortune, and accu<U+017F>tomed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo <U+017F>ome pains-taking and labor,</hi> and are not de<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary means to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain life and a healthful competency to prevent indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> By how much the more the fir<U+017F>t affected parts are extenuated, <U+017F>o much the more difficult <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> is the cure of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>

            <p>As for the fir<U+017F>t, although perhaps many <U+017F>ignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this word may be found among Authors, yet that is the be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t proper which is delivered by <hi>Galen,</hi> in his book <hi>de Method.

elected and applied, what for<U+017F>aken and avoided, that this De<U+017F>cription or Definition may be the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood, let us further examin what is here <U+017F>ignified by the <hi>Indicant?</hi> what by the thing indicated? what the action of the <hi>Indicant</hi> is? of what u<U+017F>e di<U+017F>tinction is of the thing indicated into helpful or hurtful, into that which mu<U+017F>t be cho<U+017F>en, and that which mu<U+017F>t be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed?</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, Although tho<U+017F>e terms <hi>Indication, Indicant, Indicatum,</hi> or the thing Indicated may peradventure be extended to other Arts and Sciences, yet becau<U+017F> it hath hitherto been only apropriated by the Indu<U+017F>try of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itians (e<U+017F>pecially of <hi>Galen)</hi> to the Method of Practice, their definitions which we <U+017F>hall here declare, <U+017F>hall have re<U+017F>pect only to this Method, all other u<U+017F>e of them being pretermitted.</p>
            <p>The General Definition therfore of the <hi>Indicant</hi> mu<U+017F>t be derived from the mo<U+017F>t general Nature which doth indicate in our Art. The <hi>Indicant</hi> therfore may be defined in general to be a <U+017F>tate of the Body as it is fluxible or movable, or rather, as it is actually influx or motion, relatively con<U+017F>idered, namely, as it intimateth what is to be done in that particular.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, We affirm that the <hi>Indicant</hi> doth perpetually imply <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tate or condition of the Body; wherfore becau<U+017F> that which is without the Body, and doth not yet affect it, is no <U+017F>tate or condition of the Body, it can <U+017F>carce rightly be <U+017F>aid to indicate. The external cau<U+017F> therfore, which doth not yet affect the Body, is not the <hi>Indicant,</hi> although the aver<U+017F>ion of it may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be the thing indicated. Secondly, the <U+017F>tate of the Body as it is frail, or movable, or rather as it is actually in motion, is required to the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the <hi>Indicant.</hi> For as <hi>Galen</hi> mo<U+017F>t luculently proveth to <hi>Thra<U+017F>yb.</hi> If our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:169706:138"/>
were immutable and perpetual, there were no need of Medicine, but becau<U+017F> the heat doth continually feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moi<U+017F>ture, and becau<U+017F> health it <U+017F>elf in the mo<U+017F>t perfect <U+017F>tate is frail and fluxible, yea actually fluitant, and in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure is already flowed away, manife<U+017F>t it is that the Phy<U+017F>itians Art and the Practical Duty of the Phy<U+017F>itian are both exceeding requi<U+017F>ite. For if the <U+017F>tate of the Body and the alteration therof be only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idered ab<U+017F>olutely, a bare and naked <U+017F>peculation only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ulteth from thence: but if it be con<U+017F>idered in order to that which is to be done wherby the Phy<U+017F>itian may rightly execute his duty concerning that <U+017F>tate, pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it meriteth the denomination of a Practical In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is inve<U+017F>ted with the nature of an <hi>Indicant.</hi> For <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tate doth indicate, as it is frail and in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that care mu<U+017F>t be every way had of the health, and that that care mu<U+017F>t be exerci<U+017F>ed and practi<U+017F>ed with all diligence and circum<U+017F>pection. And con<U+017F>equently this very general <hi>Indicant</hi> doth point out, that which the general <U+017F>cope of the Phy<U+017F>itians <U+017F>ought after, but it mu<U+017F>t not be expected that the con<U+017F>ideration of the mo<U+017F>t ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Indicant</hi> can repre<U+017F>ent any other thing than a mo<U+017F>t general action corre<U+017F>pondant to the general <U+017F>cope. For if the Phy<U+017F>itian de<U+017F>ireth a higher pro<U+017F>ecution of the particular <U+017F>cope, he ought to de<U+017F>cend to more particular <hi>Indicants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The thing Indicated is a Medical Action required on the part of the <hi>Indicant.</hi> For the <hi>Indicant</hi> primarily and formally denoteth the action, but <U+017F>econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily and by con<U+017F>equence the in<U+017F>trument wherwith the action is perfected. Therfore by way of an appendix let us ad to the propo<U+017F>ed Definition, that <U+017F>econdarily, by con<U+017F>equence, and in a concrete acception, it inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the In<U+017F>trument wherwith that action is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>h'd.</p>

               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:169706:138"/>
Fir<U+017F>t, We <U+017F>ay, that the thing indicated is an action For the Phy<U+017F>itian u<U+017F>eth Indication to that end, that from thence he may collect what is to be done: you will <U+017F>ay perhaps, that when the cri<U+017F>is is at hand or legitimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceedeth, the thing indicated is an ab<U+017F>tinence from, or a <U+017F>u<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ion of the action, and not the action it <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>We an<U+017F>wer, That this ab<U+017F>tinence in that very regard that it is enjoyned advi<U+017F>edly and according to art, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently contained under <U+017F>ome kind of notion of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Action; and the <U+017F>ame is to be <U+017F>aid of any kind of prohibition of any action in our Art.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We <U+017F>ay that the thing indicated is a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Action, that is directing the Action to health. For the end of Medicine is health, and therfore that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which doth aim at health is rightly termed a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Action.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We <U+017F>ay, That the thing Indicated is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction requi<U+017F>ite and importing at lea<U+017F>t in re<U+017F>pect of the <hi>Indicant.</hi> For every indicated action ought not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently to be reduced to Practice, neither can it be <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <U+017F>aid to be requi<U+017F>ite, but only in reference to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant: wherfore it mu<U+017F>t be expo<U+017F>ed to a further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination before the exerci<U+017F>e of it can be re<U+017F>olved on; and if neither the Spirits do di<U+017F><U+017F>wade, nor no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-Indicant doth more potently re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, then it is <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply requi<U+017F>ite, and mu<U+017F>t be put in practice in its due time, with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible convenience. And herupon the thing indicated is rightly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed into profitable and unprofitable. The thing indicated becomes unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either by defect of Medical matter, wherwith it <U+017F>hould be accompli<U+017F>hed, or by the pre<U+017F>ence of a <U+017F>tronger Prohibent, or contra-Indicant.</p>
            <p>Again, A thing indicated and profitable is rightly
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:169706:139"/>
<U+017F>ubdivided into an <hi>Indicate, Circum<U+017F>tantiate,</hi> and <hi>non-Circum<U+017F>tantiate.</hi> The fir<U+017F>t by which is meant an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rightly cloathed with circum<U+017F>tances mu<U+017F>t be pro<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted without any delay. The <U+017F>econd mu<U+017F>t be deferred until it have perfectly acquired due circum<U+017F>tances. We <U+017F>ay fourthly, That a thing indicated in a concrete and <U+017F>econdary <U+017F>en<U+017F> doth al<U+017F>o include the In<U+017F>trument, wherby the Indicated Action is perfected. As for example, the <U+017F>tate of health doth primarily and formally indicate an act of con<U+017F>ervation, but <U+017F>econdarily and by con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it doth withal indicate the In<U+017F>trument, wherby we con<U+017F>erve it. This pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of an Indication from the Action to the In<U+017F>trument doth not <U+017F>eem to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <U+017F>ole vertue of the Indicant, but in part al<U+017F>o upon <U+017F>ome general certain and commonly received principles, as like things are con<U+017F>erved by the like, things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are cured by their contraries, and therfore we indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>triou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>aid that <U+017F>uch an In<U+017F>trument is the Indication or thing Indicated in a Secondary <U+017F>en<U+017F>, and by con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence inferred, and becau<U+017F> it includeth the Action to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the I<U+017F>trument, we termed it <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e in a concrete <U+017F>ignification.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Seing that the Practical duty of a Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath great affinity with the Indicated action; we <U+017F>hall here con<U+017F>ider wherin they unite in <U+017F>ome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wherin they differ among them<U+017F>elves. The general Duty of a Phy<U+017F>itian is to attain (as much as in him lies) the end of his Art, namely Health. And that <U+017F>ame obtaining of Health is in a manner the mo<U+017F>t general Indicated Action, yet this is di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed from the general Duty of a Phy<U+017F>itian, becau<U+017F> the Purcha<U+017F>e, and re<U+017F>tauration of Health is not alwaies attainable. Therfore although the obtaining of Health be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Indicated; yet when that is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, the Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:169706:139"/>
is di<U+017F>obliged, <U+017F>eing that no man is bound to impo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibilities, and <U+017F>o con<U+017F>equently, it is no part of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In like manner an Indicated Action is <U+017F>omtimes unprofitable for the rea<U+017F>ons before alledged, in which ca<U+017F>e it appertaineth not to the Duty of the Phy<U+017F>itian. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, An Indicated action, though when it is profitable it mu<U+017F>t be performed in its place, yet <U+017F>o long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues an apparel'd and deve<U+017F>ted of due circum<U+017F>tances, it pre<U+017F><U+017F>eth not the Duty of a Phy<U+017F>itian. For it is the part of a Phy<U+017F>itian not only to pre<U+017F>cribe things profitable in the Species, but they mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uch, regard being had to time, order, and other conditions of a ju<U+017F>t and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular admini<U+017F>tration. Finally a profitable Indicated Action being robbed in all its due circum<U+017F>tances doth truly exact the duty of a Phy<U+017F>itian. For a Phy<U+017F>itian is obliged to execute <U+017F>uch actions, and only <U+017F>uch, at lea<U+017F>t when they are con<U+017F>picuous.</p>
            <p>Be<U+017F>ides; The <U+017F>cope and intentions of the Phy<U+017F>itian having a diver<U+017F>e re<U+017F>pect to the Indicated Actions and the Duties of the Phy<U+017F>itian, and holding <U+017F>ome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with each of them, we <U+017F>hall likewi<U+017F>e here con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in what re<U+017F>pect this falleth out. But in the very entrance into this Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F> the<U+017F>e <U+017F>copes <U+017F>eem <U+017F>omtimes to be properly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hable into little notions or forms of enquiry after every Duty of a Phy<U+017F>itian, and the things them<U+017F>elves to be enquired after. The forms of enquiry are nothing el<U+017F>e but apt Que<U+017F>tions or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations, which <U+017F>ubdivide every Duty of a Phy<U+017F>itian into <U+017F>o many parts, as it containeth to be di<U+017F>tinctly <U+017F>if<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and examined. <hi>Argenterius</hi> reckons up nine Forms of this kind: Fir<U+017F>t, Whether? Secondly, What? Thirdly, With what matter? Fourthly, How much? Fifthly? Of what kind? Sixthly, After what manner? Seventhly, When? Eighthly, Where? Ninthly, In
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:169706:140"/>
what order a thing mu<U+017F>t be done? Others contract the<U+017F>e to fewer Heads, but for further <U+017F>atisfaction the under<U+017F>tanding Reader may con<U+017F>ult with the Books. The real Scopes or things them<U+017F>elves to be enquired are tho<U+017F>e very parts, into which each Duty of a Phy<U+017F>itian may be aptly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed. They are therfore <U+017F>o many in number as there are found parts in that duty to be examined. The<U+017F>e Scopes thus found out differ not really, but only in rea<U+017F>on from tho<U+017F>e that are yet to be found out, namely in re<U+017F>pect of the diver<U+017F>e relation to the intellect <U+017F>eeking, and actually under<U+017F>tanding. From hence it appeareth what affinity there is between the<U+017F>e Scopes and the Duty of a Phy<U+017F>itian, and al<U+017F>o the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated actions. For the notional Scopes or forms of Scopes, and the things them<U+017F>elves to be enquired after under tho<U+017F>e forms do both aim at the <U+017F>ame mark, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the di<U+017F>tinct invention of all the parts of a Phy<U+017F>itians Duty. But the things to be <U+017F>ought out are the parts them<U+017F>elves of the Duty aptly <U+017F>eparated and disjoyned from one another the better to facilitate the invention and examination.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Tho<U+017F>e parts of this Duty, in as much as they are found out by the force of Indication, are the very indicated Actions; <U+017F>o that the Scopes invented by the Indication, and the Indicated Actions do really <U+017F>ignifie the <U+017F>ame things. We <U+017F>ay really, becau<U+017F> the Scopes even when found out differ in rea<U+017F>on from them as they are Scopes, <U+017F>eing that be<U+017F>ides the Indicated Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they <U+017F>eem to note together an intention of pro<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the <U+017F>ame Actions, as the Scopes not yet found out do intimate an intention of enquiring into them. Thus much of Indicates or things Indicated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The action of an <hi>Indicant</hi> is <hi>Objective</hi> and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:169706:140"/>
               <hi>Indicant,</hi> as an Object be<U+017F>ides it <U+017F>elf, doth in <U+017F>om <U+017F>ort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inuate another thing to the under<U+017F>tanding. <hi>Perhaps <U+017F>om may wonder,</hi> how an Object can repre<U+017F>ent any other thing be<U+017F>ides it <U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We an<U+017F>wer,</hi> Such is the Nature of relatives, that (as <U+017F>uch) they cannot be conceived without an implicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their correlatives. For one relative in his proper con<U+017F>ideration doth at lea<U+017F>t obliquely involve the con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of another, and by that means it ea<U+017F>ily u<U+017F>hereth the under<U+017F>tanding to the knowledg of the other.</p>
            <p>Som may reply, <hi>If the force of the</hi> Indication <hi>be built upon the meer relation of the</hi> Indicant <hi>to the</hi> Indicatum, <hi>How coms it to pa<U+017F>s that the u<U+017F>e therof is re<U+017F>trained <U+017F>ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Art of Medicine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this we an<U+017F>wer,</hi> We deny not, but this in<U+017F>trument may be extended to other Arts and Sciences, as we have before in<U+017F>inuated. For in moral Philo<U+017F>ophy it is lawful to <U+017F>ay, that Vertu doth Indicate the protection of her <U+017F>elf, and Vice the <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion of it <U+017F>elf. But neither doth this kind of relation con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t only between the States of things, and the Actions therunto belonging, but al<U+017F>o be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the terms meerly <U+017F>peculative; as twice two are four, a man is not a hor<U+017F>e. But here we con<U+017F>ider the <hi>Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the efficacy of the <hi>Indicant</hi> only in order to the Method of Phy<U+017F>ick, <U+017F>o as it wil not be here needful to extend the u<U+017F>e of this in<U+017F>trument further, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did <hi>Galen,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it would contribute little to the <U+017F>cope therof. Yet we affirm, that every relation is not a <U+017F>ufficient <hi>ba<U+017F>is</hi> of an <hi>Indication,</hi> but it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>uch, as hath either an evident conformity and agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Indicant</hi> and <hi>Indicatum,</hi> wherby they may be fitly mar<U+017F>halled into a propo<U+017F>ition of undoubted truth; or a di<U+017F>parity and repugnance of them among them<U+017F>elvs
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:169706:141"/>
that <U+017F>o they may aptly be divided from one another; that is, they may be di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed into a negative propo<U+017F>ition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually certain. Now becau<U+017F>e the propo<U+017F>itions elected by this indication are certain and evident, not needing any higher proof: from thence it is manife<U+017F>t that every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding that is Ma<U+017F>ter of it <U+017F>elf, not clouded with a vail of prejudice, nor wittingly en<U+017F>nared with <U+017F>ceptical Sophi<U+017F>ms and fallacies, mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily pay an a<U+017F><U+017F>ent unto them <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon as he under<U+017F>tandeth the terms. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Scepticks them<U+017F>elvs, though in their di<U+017F>putati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they wil lie in wait to traver<U+017F>e any verity, how mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t <U+017F>oever it be, and bu<U+017F>y them<U+017F>elvs to equal the mo<U+017F>t certain principles with things extreamly doubtful, yet in performing the nece<U+017F><U+017F>aries of life, <U+017F>eing that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve hunger by food, hoard up mony, avoyd <U+017F>tripes, and do the<U+017F>e and the like things con<U+017F>tantly and without any di<U+017F>temper of mind, they plainly di<U+017F>cover that they are led by <U+017F>om bad di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of mind, or governed by a de<U+017F>ire of glory, or tickled w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a hope of victory in the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather that they doubt really of the truth of <U+017F>uch Propo<U+017F>itions. In the interim, it mu<U+017F>t be ob<U+017F>erved, that the very Indication is fallible and deceitful, where the ab<U+017F>olute nature of the <hi>Indicant</hi> or the <hi>Indicatum</hi> hath not been exactly under<U+017F>tood before. For in this art of Indications, we do not pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e only that a Phy<U+017F>itian <U+017F>hould always have learned before, and duly known what al tho<U+017F>e things are, which we cal according to Nature, as al<U+017F>o in what the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and all the parts therof con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, and to have an exact knowledg of all the cau<U+017F>es of an Affect. Yea, it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand all Medical actions, and upon occa<U+017F>ion be able to render a ready account what alteration is, what heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what cooling, &amp;c. what evacuation, purgation, and the <U+017F>ection of a vein, &amp;c. what con<U+017F>ervation, and the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:169706:141"/>
like. For the Indication doth not make manife<U+017F>t the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olute nature either of the <hi>Indicant</hi> or the <hi>Indicatum;</hi> but pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing this as already known, it repre<U+017F>enteth only a mutual relation; namly, either a <U+017F>trict connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conformity which they retain among them<U+017F>elvs, or a di<U+017F>parity and oppo<U+017F>ition, wherby they may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into an undoubted propo<U+017F>ition: but the certainty of the indicated propo<U+017F>ition cannot exceed the certainty of the knowledg of the Indicant. Therfore if at any time we <U+017F>cruple the certain knowledg of the Nature of the Indicant, it is not <U+017F>afe to tru<U+017F>t to the Indication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, til it <U+017F>hal better be confirmed by <U+017F>om other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on or experience. But this doubting mu<U+017F>t not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Nature of the Indication, but to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Indicant.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it mu<U+017F>t be con<U+017F>idered that the relation of the Indicant in the Method of practice, doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trate be<U+017F>ides the evidence <U+017F>omwhat of duty in re<U+017F>pect of the Indicated action, and that the propo<U+017F>itions formed from the Indication do either explicitly, or at lea<U+017F>t<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly in<U+017F>inuate that duty. As in this Propo<U+017F>ition, a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth Indicate the ablation of it <U+017F>elf, the ablation is decreed and re<U+017F>olved upon, as a requi<U+017F>it action on the part of the Indicant, that is a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>: as if one <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay, a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> requireth or importuneth the removal of it <U+017F>elf. Yet this duty of the action is more frequently and indeed much more elegantly expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by the Participle in <hi>dus,</hi> as a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is to be taken away: which Propo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the fulne<U+017F>s of its <U+017F>ignification hath a manife<U+017F>t coincidence with the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There remaineth <U+017F>til an objection to be an<U+017F>wered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the action of the Indicant; and this it is,</hi> If the <hi>Indication</hi> be the very action of the <hi>Indicant,</hi> how can it be called an operation of the under<U+017F>tanding? For all
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:169706:142"/>
writers refer the <hi>Indication</hi> to <U+017F>om generation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We an<U+017F>wer,</hi> The Indication is indeed an action of the Indicant, but yet an objective action, and that it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the intellective faculty, and abideth in it as in its <U+017F>ubject: Moreover, that the under<U+017F>tanding a power, both actuated, and as it were informed by its <U+017F>ubject. Wherfore although the action of Indication be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively attributed to the Indicant, yet <U+017F>ubjectively it is a<U+017F>cribed to the Soul, and e<U+017F>pecially to the intellective part therof, which is as it were the act and form of it. And from hence it wil be mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>y to reconcile <hi>Galen</hi> with him<U+017F>elf, who <U+017F>omtimes defineth Indication to be an <hi>Empha<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>omtimes a <hi>Catalep<U+017F>is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, It mu<U+017F>t be examined whether that di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an Indicated action, into an action helpful and hurtful may tend. For <U+017F>om may urge, that <hi>Galen</hi> doth perpetually affirm, that one <hi>Indicatum</hi> only can be in<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated from one Indicant; and that in his <hi>Method. Med.</hi> he doth affirm, <hi>That they vainly attempt the Method of cure, who are ignorant that one thing is Indicated from one Indicant,</hi> and that all who have written of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do <U+017F>eem to atte<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame thing,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We an<U+017F>wer,</hi> That <hi>Galen</hi> mu<U+017F>t be under<U+017F>tood of the three di<U+017F>tinct<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> kinds of Indicants, which mu<U+017F>t by no means be confounded, nor their Indicates, that is, the things indicated by them. For that which a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth properly Indicate, mu<U+017F>t not be attributed to the cau<U+017F>es or the Spirits: In like manner that which the cau<U+017F>es In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate mu<U+017F>t not be applyed to the Spirits or the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> it <U+017F>elf. Finally, that which the Spirits Indicate mu<U+017F>t nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a<U+017F>cribed to the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> nor the cau<U+017F>es. For in this re<U+017F>pect one Indicate an<U+017F>wereth to one Indicant, and he that ob<U+017F>erves not this, mu<U+017F>t unavoydably confound all

things, and in the employments of art makes an un<U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful u<U+017F>e of this in<U+017F>trument, according to the judgment of <hi>Galen.</hi> But it mu<U+017F>t be con<U+017F>idered, that in each of the<U+017F>e kinds, the <hi>Indicatum</hi> may be divided into two parts, one wherof is an advantageous action, and to be pro<U+017F>ecuted; the other is noxious and to be avoyded<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> yet each of them belongeth to one and the <U+017F>ame kind among<U+017F>t the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid three, and is as it were a middle part of the whole Indicate: For the Spirits direct to an election of <U+017F>uch things as may cheri<U+017F>h and protect them, and to an avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <U+017F>uch things as may in a further degree empair them: and both the<U+017F>e actions concur to advance and a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the compleat and final con<U+017F>ervation of them. In like manner, both in cure and re<U+017F>tauration, and al<U+017F>o in caution and prevention, there is found an action as well to be embraced, as abandoned; yet whether of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the bounds of its kind, <U+017F>o that no confu<U+017F>ion can from thence be feared. For whil<U+017F>t we cure, we make choice of tho<U+017F>e things that wil demoli<U+017F>h the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and we deliver the application of <U+017F>uch things as wil augment it. In like manner, when we pre<U+017F>erve, we take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the cau<U+017F>es, and withal we <U+017F>hun the u<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F> things that may con<U+017F>pire either the continuation, or future breeding of them. And for this Rea<U+017F>on in the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we have pre<U+017F>ented above of an Indication, we di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed the action indicated into that which ought to be pro<U+017F>ecuted, and that which ought to be waved: which very thing al<U+017F>o we were about to do, in the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of the particular Indications to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>It is now time for us to proceed to the <U+017F>econd enquiry propounded at the beginning, namely, Unto which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Intellective faculty the Indication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth. We <U+017F>ay, fir<U+017F>t, That the Indication doth in <U+017F>om <U+017F>ort include the <U+017F>imple apprehen<U+017F>ion of each term, both
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:169706:143"/>
of the Indicant and the Indicate. For he can never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tand a Propo<U+017F>ition who is ignorant of the Terms therof. Yet this knowledg is only preparatory and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed in the art of Indications, as we have already noted. We affirm <U+017F>econdly, That compo<U+017F>ition and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ion is an explicit operation of the Intellective faculty in the perception of an Indication. For the Indicant by force of his relation doth repre<U+017F>ent the Indicate to be aptly continued together into a relative propo<U+017F>ition. Now that a Propo<U+017F>ition thus con<U+017F>tituted may in its own nature be <U+017F>o manife<U+017F>t and evident, that no man can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onably doubt of the truth therof, or need any cleerer proof, is expre<U+017F>ly taught by <hi>Galen</hi>—<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>< in non-Latin alphabet ></desc>
               </gap>; and again in another place—<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>< in non-Latin alphabet ></desc>
               </gap>. Here <U+017F>om calumniate <hi>Galen,</hi> as if he had devi<U+017F>ed an art <U+017F>eparated from all experience, and quarrelling with Rea<U+017F>on; but becau<U+017F>e <hi>Galen</hi> intended nothing el<U+017F>e, than that Propo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions framed by Indication are of <U+017F>elf credit, and need not any comprobation from Rea<U+017F>on or Experience, the<U+017F> Criticks may perceiv their own ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s and retract the <U+017F>candal. <hi>Senertus</hi> indeed objecteth, that the Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot belong to the <U+017F>econd operation of the mind, becau<U+017F>e the Indicate is neither affirmed nor denied of the Indicant. But that learned man was herein mi<U+017F>taken. For although peradventure that the Indicate be neither affirmed nor denied of the Indicant directly, and by the bare Verb Sub<U+017F>tantive or Copulative <hi>(e<U+017F>t.)</hi> Yet indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and obliquely it is manife<U+017F>tly predicated of the <U+017F>ame, and after the <U+017F>ame manner as it u<U+017F>eth to be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Propo<U+017F>itions. As for example, A <U+017F>ound State is the Indicant of its own con<U+017F>ervation; a <U+017F>ickly conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the Indicant of <U+017F>om remedy, &amp;c. And if any man wil expre<U+017F>s the Indicate with his relation to the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:169706:143"/>
by the participle in <hi>dus,</hi> than the Predication will be direct. As a <U+017F>ound State is to be pre<U+017F>erved; a di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed State is to be cured, a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> mu<U+017F>t be removed, &amp;c. If the Learned <hi>Senertus</hi> can deny the<U+017F>e to be Propo<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he may with the like facility deny that an Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on belongeth to this Operation of the Under<U+017F>tanding; but if he mu<U+017F>t needs confe<U+017F>s that, there is no room left for the denial of this. Now we have <U+017F>aid that the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth belong to the <U+017F>econd Operation of the Mind, becau<U+017F> the Under<U+017F>tanding, in reference to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time, doth withal comprehend the mutual relation between the Indicant and the Indicate, and thereupon frameth a Propo<U+017F>ition, which formation and contexture of the Propo<U+017F>ition is the very Indication; and explicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <U+017F>econd Operation of the Under<U+017F>tanding. Now that the Under<U+017F>tanding doth together at one time compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Indicant and the Indicate in the Indication, is elegantly expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed by <hi>Galen</hi> in a decompounded word which he u<U+017F>eth in the definition therof, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>< in non-Latin alphabet ></desc>
               </gap>: al<U+017F>o in another definition, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>< in non-Latin alphabet ></desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>We <U+017F>ay Thirdly, That Indication <hi>may likewi<U+017F>e im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly be referred to the third operation of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding;</hi> Becau<U+017F> in the order of Nature the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanding <U+017F>eemeth fir<U+017F>t to perceive the evident relation of the Indicant to the Indicate before it can conclude of the certainty of the Propo<U+017F>ition from thence re<U+017F>ulting. Although in the order of time the Mind (as hath been <U+017F>aid) comprehendeth them together; neither is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary to form an explicit Syllogi<U+017F>m, for the truth is, The Under<U+017F>tanding can comprehend tho<U+017F>e things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at one time, which by the In<U+017F>titution of Nature are termed Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ive, as the Sun and Light, Fire and Heat, &amp;c. But in regard that this <U+017F>imultaneous comprehen<U+017F>ion
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:169706:144"/>
of an Indication doth include a certain dependance of the knowledg of the Indicate from the perceived relation of the Indicant, it <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>eth al<U+017F>o that the <U+017F>aid relation is <U+017F>ooner perceived at lea<U+017F>t in the order of Nature, and that the Indicate is later under<U+017F>tood and by an implicit brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in, for a kind of tran<U+017F>ition, in re<U+017F>pect of the order of Nature doth <U+017F>eem to be here implied from the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Indicant, as the <hi>Medius terminus,</hi> to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition con<U+017F>tituted of the Indicant and the Indicate as to the conclu<U+017F>ion; and this may be called an implicit rea<U+017F>oning.</p>
            <p>We <U+017F>ay Fourthly, <hi>That by circumlocution and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances of <U+017F>peech, an</hi> Indication <hi>may be reduced to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit rea<U+017F>oning or <U+017F>yllogi<U+017F>m, or rather, that the <U+017F>ame thing which we pur<U+017F>ue &amp; argue at by Indication is to be found out and proved by way of Syllogi<U+017F>m.</hi> For the Rea<U+017F>on of the evidance of an Indicated Propo<U+017F>ition may explicitly be applied, as the <hi>Medius terminus,</hi> to infer that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition. In the interim a Syllogi<U+017F>m <U+017F>o pieced together will be either ab<U+017F>olutly frivolous and childi<U+017F>h, or at the be<U+017F>t only explicatory. As if any one who would prove that a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> were to be removed, <U+017F>hould thus proceed: <hi>That which is contrary to Nature is to be removed; A Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is contrary to Nature, therfore a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is to be removed.</hi> The <hi>Medius terminus (that is again<U+017F>t Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)</hi> is not the rea<U+017F>on of the Relation of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> to the Ablation therof, but it is only an Expo<U+017F>ition of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Nature of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. For who<U+017F>oever under<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth what a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is, doth at the <U+017F>ame in<U+017F>tant pre<U+017F>ently conceive <U+017F>omthing not natural. And therfore <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>yl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logi<U+017F>m is only expo<U+017F>itory. Yet we do not <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e it to be alwaies unprofitable, becau<U+017F> it may <U+017F>omtimes be <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the conviction of a <U+017F>tubborn, or the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation an ignorant Di<U+017F>temper. Hither al<U+017F>o we may
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:169706:144"/>
refer the tran<U+017F>lation of an Indication from the Action to the In<U+017F>truments by vertue of general Rules: Likes are pre<U+017F>erved by their likes, Contraries cured by their contraries.</p>
            <p>We <U+017F>ay Fifthly, <hi>That a Collation of the Indications a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them<U+017F>elvs, wherby we may guide our choice by the con<U+017F>ent and di<U+017F><U+017F>ent of the Indicants to what <U+017F>imply and ab<U+017F>olutly ought to be done, doth nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily involve the third Operation of the Under<U+017F>tanding.</hi> For the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Indication <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>eth a midle term extraneous to that Indication, which being fir<U+017F>t under<U+017F>tood, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation is inferred as a conclu<U+017F>ion. For he that findeth out an external for a middle term (thereby to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert the verity of any propo<U+017F>ition) doubtle<U+017F>s he manife<U+017F>tly argues and di<U+017F>putes. Seing therfore that be<U+017F>ides the Indicant and the Indicate a third term, and the affirmation or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation therof is required to the limitation of an Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, evident it is that the third Operation of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding is requi<U+017F>it to the Invention therof. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although <U+017F>imple Indications may <U+017F>ubmini<U+017F>ter the fir<U+017F>t rudiments of Method to Practice, yet to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perfection of di<U+017F>puting the Art mu<U+017F>t likewi<U+017F>e be joyned with it.</p>
            <p>We affirm Sixthly, <hi>That the election of the Phy<U+017F>ical Matter in particular, and the apt and prudent admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tration therof, doth not only imploy every Operation of the Under<U+017F>tanding, but that it al<U+017F>o requireth experience;</hi> for without this, who can <U+017F>ufficiently under<U+017F>tand to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<U+017F>ter a do<U+017F>e of <hi>Scamony</hi> or of any other purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, or know what humors <U+017F>uch and <U+017F>uch a Plant draweth away by a peculiar propriety? Again, in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines alterant there may perhaps lurk <U+017F>om hidden qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which may be hurtful to the Patient, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out experience cannot be di<U+017F>cerned. We conclude ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

(the proper force and u<U+017F>e of Indications being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued) that to a compleat method of Medicine all the dictates of Rea<U+017F>on, and the contributions of Experience are pre-required.</p>
            <p>We now proceed to the Third Title propounded at fir<U+017F>t, namly, Into what kinds and differences Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is di<U+017F>tributed. Som differences may ea<U+017F>ily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved by what hath already been <U+017F>poken, which therfore we <U+017F>hal here omit. Now here we di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into <hi>general, <U+017F>ucceeding,</hi> and <hi><U+017F>pecifical.</hi> The general is derived from the general Indicant, the <U+017F>ucceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g> the intermediat kinds of Indicants, and the <U+017F>pecifical from the lowe<U+017F>t Species of them. We have already no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the general Indicant is the very <U+017F>tate of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy con<U+017F>idered in general, as it is frail and in motion; this <U+017F>tate indicateth that health mu<U+017F>t be intended, which is the mo<U+017F>t general phy<U+017F>ical action, and the mo<U+017F>t gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Indicate; yet this action is in <U+017F>om <U+017F>ort concrete, and equally includeth two general actions in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tract, namly Con<U+017F>ervation and Correction. For the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <U+017F>tate afore<U+017F>aid is al<U+017F>o concrete, and comprehendeth two like Con<U+017F>iderations in the ab<U+017F>tract, namly, one of the parts yet qualified according to the pre<U+017F>cript of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which require a pure Con<U+017F>ervation: The <U+017F>econd of the parts <U+017F>omwhat degenerated from their integrity, which in like manner require a pure correction. The<U+017F>e two actions are perpetually conjoyned in every work of Art. For he that con<U+017F>erveth, withal correcteth, that is, he rectifieth <U+017F>om irregularities; and he which correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, hath at the <U+017F>ame time con<U+017F>ervation for the object of his Undertakings. The complication of the<U+017F>e acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtil, that it <U+017F>eemeth to have po<U+017F>ed that mo<U+017F>t acute Phy<U+017F>itian <hi>Argenterius,</hi> who in his Book <hi>Off. Med<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
               </hi> affirmeth Con<U+017F>ervation to be that very Correction,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:169706:146"/>
which is exerci<U+017F>ed in the art of maintaining health. But his Error is twofold. Fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e he <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>eth Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Con<U+017F>ervation in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>< in non-Latin alphabet ></desc>
               </gap> to be one and the <U+017F>ame action, when indeed they are two di<U+017F>tinct actions, however they are complicated in the Exerci<U+017F>es of Art. For they are indicated (as we <U+017F>aid before) from the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Con<U+017F>iderations of the Indicant, and Con<U+017F>ervation hath re<U+017F>pect to tho<U+017F>e things which are according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but Correction reflecteth upon preter-natural faultine<U+017F>s. Moreover, They are perfected by in<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments formally di<U+017F>tinct, yea oppo<U+017F>it: For Correction even in the very art of defending health, is accompli<U+017F>ht by Contraries, but Con<U+017F>ervation by Homogeneals; as in this Art we help Emptine<U+017F>s by taking Nouri<U+017F>hment, contrary indeed to the Emptine<U+017F>s, but homogeneal to the Parts which are to be nouri<U+017F>hed: Therfore although the<U+017F>e Actions be complicated in the Execution, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are formally di<U+017F>tinct, and ought di<U+017F>tinctly to be entertain'd by the Under<U+017F>tanding. The Second Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Argenterius</hi> is, becau<U+017F>e he granteth the correction of Errors only to be the General Action of al Medicin, when as Con<U+017F>ervation is equally univer<U+017F>al and alike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci<U+017F>ed in al the works of Art.</p>
            <p>No man doubteth but we con<U+017F>erve in the <hi>Hygienal</hi> part, and that we correct. Al<U+017F>o <hi>Galen</hi> demon<U+017F>trats in his Book, whether the matters of pre<U+017F>erving health be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a Phy<U+017F>itian. You will <U+017F>ay, That <hi>Galen</hi> in that place doth prove every Medicinal Action to be correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that con<U+017F>ervation is comprehended under the latitude of correction. But <hi>Galen</hi> mu<U+017F>t not be <U+017F>o under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood, as if he intended correction to be a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation, <U+017F>eing that (as we have <U+017F>hewed before) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation and correction even in this art of pre<U+017F>erving health are actions formally different and differently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:169706:147"/>
for <hi>Galen</hi>'s meaning is, that every Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal action when it is actually admini<U+017F>tred, doth imply and comprehend correction, and in that re<U+017F>pect may be called Correction, and <U+017F>o by con<U+017F>equence Correction will be the general Action of all Medicine; yet <hi>Galen</hi> confe<U+017F><U+017F>eth Con<U+017F>ervation to be equally general. For what hinders but there may be two general ab<U+017F>tracted Actions in Phy<U+017F>ick? That doth not de<U+017F>troy, if any man have <U+017F>uch conceptions, the unity of the Art, it rather indeed confirms it. For the unity of an Art con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in <U+017F>ome community, which may be attributed to all the parts therof; and this union is to be e<U+017F>teemed <U+017F>o much the more firm, as all the parts of art are reciprocally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned among them<U+017F>elvs by more communities. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are two general Actions, and tho<U+017F>e common to all the parts of Medicine, <U+017F>o much the more firmly will tho<U+017F>e parts con<U+017F>pire the advancement of the Art. Wherfore he contradicts not <hi>Galen,</hi> that affirms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation al<U+017F>o to be a general Action of all Medicine; <U+017F>eing that the <U+017F>cope of <hi>Galen</hi> was only to <U+017F>hew the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Medical art by the community of that general Action, namely Correction; now he might as ea<U+017F>ily have <U+017F>hewed it, if the nature of the thing had required it, by the community of Con<U+017F>ervation. For in the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gienal part of the mo<U+017F>t noble circum<U+017F>tance is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation of the whol concrete action, and therupon the whol action is denominated from the more principal part, and the Art it <U+017F>elf an Art con<U+017F>ervative. Although otherwi<U+017F>e (as hath been <U+017F>aid) it al<U+017F>o includes Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> part the principal <U+017F>cope of the Medical Action is pre<U+017F>ervation, namely the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the cau<U+017F> of the imminent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>: yet this is <U+017F>o performed, and by <U+017F>uch means which the pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>pirits can allow, but in no wi<U+017F>e by <U+017F>uch things as may
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:169706:147"/>
de<U+017F>troy them. And therfore al<U+017F>o in the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> part regard is had to the Spirits, and their con<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is Indicated.</p>
            <p>Now after the <U+017F>ame manner the whole concrete <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (although as hath been <U+017F>aid, it al<U+017F>o includeth Con<U+017F>ervation) is called Pre<U+017F>ervation and Precaution from the more Noble part. Finally, In the <hi>Therapeutical</hi> part, although in like manner the whol concrete <hi>action</hi> be called <hi>Curation,</hi> and the art it <U+017F>elf a <hi>Curative Science</hi> from the principal part of the <hi>action,</hi> yet to <U+017F>peak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and truly all this <hi>action</hi> of cure may be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three ab<U+017F>tracted parts, and evidently di<U+017F>tinct; namly, into the Cure of the cau<U+017F>e, the Cure of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and the con<U+017F>ervation of the Spirits. For the Vital or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervative Indication doth evidently, and by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous grant of all Phy<U+017F>itians belong al<U+017F>o to this part of Medicine, and mu<U+017F>t be con<U+017F>ulted of in every curative <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> before it be undertaken. From whence it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t that this part likewi<U+017F>e of Medicine doth perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually con<U+017F>erve, that is, provide and fore<U+017F>ee in every Cure, lea<U+017F>t the Spirits <U+017F>hould receive more detriment than profit from the pre<U+017F>cribed remedies. Al the<U+017F>e things therfore being thorowly weighed, we conclude, That a general Indicate is a certain concrete thing, and may be properly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed into two general ab<U+017F>tracted <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which are exerci<U+017F>ed in every part of Medicine, and that in the work of art they pertually make one compleat or complicated <hi>action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, The general Indicant, namely the State of the Body, as frail and in motion may be divided, be<U+017F>ides the parts or ob<U+017F>tracted con<U+017F>iderations already propo<U+017F>ed, into three kinds, or rather three <U+017F>ucceeding kinds equally and alike concrete: namely, into a <U+017F>ound <U+017F>tate, a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>tate and a neutrality. The<U+017F>e three
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:169706:148"/>
Species are the <U+017F>ubjects of the three kinds of Method to Practice; namely the <U+017F>ound <U+017F>tate of the Hygienal part, the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>tate of the <hi>Therapeutical,</hi> and the <hi>Neutral</hi> of the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> part. The<U+017F>e three <U+017F>tates are al<U+017F>o concrete Indicants, and re<U+017F>pectively Indicate what is particularly to be done, or what the Phy<U+017F>itians Duty is in all tho<U+017F>e Arts: namely a <U+017F>ound <U+017F>tate indicateth the con<U+017F>ervation of health; a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>tate the removal of <U+017F>ome affect, and the <hi>Neutral</hi> <U+017F>tate that the cau<U+017F> of an imminent malady ought to be corrected lea<U+017F>t it break out into a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Now the<U+017F>e three Indicates are alike concrete, and each of them as we have proved above, ab<U+017F>tractively includeth both Con<U+017F>ervation and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Finally, In a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>tate the action of correcting is di<U+017F><U+017F>olved into two Species; into the correction of Cau<U+017F>, and the correction of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and <U+017F>o here may be di<U+017F>covered three kinds of ab<U+017F>tracted actions. For a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed <U+017F>tate brancheth it <U+017F>elf into three Species evidently ab<U+017F>tracted, into the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, the cau<U+017F>es of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and the Spirits or tho<U+017F>e things which remain in this <U+017F>tate according to Nature. For tho<U+017F>e things which are preternatural and indicate correction in general, are here <U+017F>eparated (as hath been <U+017F>aid) into two parts, namely into the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and the Cau<U+017F>es of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; and therfore there are three parts of this <U+017F>tate, each of which do formally and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinctly Indicate. Three kinds therfore (that we may put an end to this matter) of Indications are to be con<U+017F>idered in this <U+017F>tate; namely, from the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, the Curative; from the Cau<U+017F>es the Pre<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, and from the Spirits the Vital or Con<U+017F>ervative. To the Cau<U+017F>es we refer all impediments of cure, as al<U+017F>o vehement Symptoms, and <U+017F>uch as divert the Progre<U+017F>s of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:169706:148"/>
the Cure to them<U+017F>elvs, for in this re<U+017F>pect they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>ted with the Nature of Cau<U+017F>es. And thus much of Indications in general.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have already affirmed that the<U+017F>e Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are deduced from the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, we <U+017F>hall therfore in this place <U+017F>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run over all the parts of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, that the Reader may perceive, what every one in<U+017F>inuates to be done.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, Therfore the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper, this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in re<U+017F>pect of this part of its E<U+017F><U+017F>ence Indicateth, not only that all tho<U+017F>e things are to be avoided, which are in any wi<U+017F>e endued with a faculty to cheri<U+017F>h and augment that di<U+017F>temper; but al<U+017F>o that the aid of <U+017F>uch things ought to be implored, which may <U+017F>ubdue the <U+017F>ame; namely, hot and dry.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> partly al<U+017F>o con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in the want of inherent Spirits, therfore not only all tho<U+017F>e things are to be avoided, which can any further <U+017F>catter, and con<U+017F>ume the Spirits; but <U+017F>uch things mu<U+017F>t be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted which are vertuous to re<U+017F>tore, cheri<U+017F>h, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them. Strong di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ing remedies are therfore in this ca<U+017F>e to be declined, becau<U+017F> withal they con<U+017F>ume the Spirits: in like manner <U+017F>uch as are extreamly hot, for
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:169706:149"/>
they cau<U+017F> them to evaporate and vani<U+017F>h into air; but much more <U+017F>uch as have power to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the parts, as violent Catharticks. But the be<U+017F>t nouri<U+017F>hment mu<U+017F>t be cho<U+017F>en, and Medicines that are ea<U+017F>y of Concoction, as much as may be, and amicable and benign to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a numbne<U+017F>s or a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment of the Spirits: this numbne<U+017F>s in<U+017F>inuates a prohibition and ab<U+017F>tinence from all <U+017F>uch things as vehemently make thick and fix the Spirits or any other waies <U+017F>tupifie them, as narotical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midies, and many Minerals, which participate of the nature of Lead, as Cerus, Litharge, Sinople or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion; and all <U+017F>uch things as have power to excite the Spirits, to expel their <U+017F>tupefaction, and to render them active and agile, are to be made choice of, as exerci<U+017F>es, motions, <hi>Frictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Tone being over <U+017F>oft, loo<U+017F>, flavid, and withered, indicateth an avoidance of <U+017F>uch things as are wont to mollifie, loo<U+017F>en and weaken the parts; and that <U+017F>uch Medicines are to be outwardly applied and inwardly given, as may render them more firm and <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. The <U+017F>ame <hi>Tone</hi> as it is internally too brittle brings a <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion upon all <U+017F>uch things as abound much with an inward <U+017F>lipperine<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>eemeth to de<U+017F>ire <U+017F>ome rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, or indeed a<U+017F>triction in tho<U+017F>e things applied or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The corrupted Vital Con<U+017F>titution on the part of the Generation of the Vital Spirits is not <U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable; but on the part of the di<U+017F>tribution of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits, the inequality therof is of great importance, and indicateth a caution to be had of tho<U+017F>e things which promove the flux of the Blood towards the Head, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o of <U+017F>uch things as retard the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age therof to the fir<U+017F>t
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:169706:149"/>
affected parts, but that choice mu<U+017F>t be made of <U+017F>uch things as <U+017F>tir the Pul<U+017F>es of the Arteries in the parts fir<U+017F>t affected, and temper tho<U+017F>e that are in the Head. A <U+017F>low and diminute current of the Blood through the fir<U+017F>t af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected parts indicateth the <U+017F>ame things, namely an evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Pul<U+017F> to tho<U+017F>e parts. But an over facile and <U+017F>lippery pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of the Blood through the habit of the parts, is coincident in its indication with the <U+017F>lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perine<U+017F>s of the <hi>Tone</hi> lately recited. A defect of the Vital Con<U+017F>titution on the part of the union <U+017F>ufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vigorous and plea<U+017F>ant between the Vital and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits, indicateth an election of <U+017F>uch things as can both nouri<U+017F>h and cheri<U+017F>h the Spirits, and al<U+017F>o excite them to a greater activity, and that their contraries ought to be avoided. The Vital heat, as deficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates almo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame thing as a cold di<U+017F>temper, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that regard be had withal to the <U+017F>trength of the Heart and Arteries, and to the vigor of the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The unequal Nutrition Indicateth tho<U+017F>e things which promove the even and impartial di<U+017F>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aliment and Heat. Or indeed that which is too liberal to the parts that are nouri<U+017F>hed beyond a due mea<U+017F>ure; the extenuation of the parts requireth a fuller Nouri<U+017F>hment. The irregular magnitude of the Head, chiefly things extenuant and <U+017F>uch as are of the flux from the Head. The Tumors of the Bones indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the <U+017F>ame thing; the crookedne<U+017F>s of the Bones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <U+017F>uch things as attract the Aliment to the hollow <U+017F>ide, as moderate rubbings; but things repre<U+017F><U+017F>ing chiefly on the gibbous and bunched <U+017F>ide, as <U+017F>trong bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. The bending of the Joynts, in<U+017F>inuateth an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial erection of them, as much as is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible. The narrowne<U+017F>s of the Brea<U+017F>t pointeth to Pectorals, and <U+017F>uch
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:169706:150"/>
things as have a faculty to dilate the Brea<U+017F>t; but the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s therof indicateth <U+017F>uch things as have a dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vertue.</p>
            <p>Sevently, The imperfect di<U+017F>tribution of Animal Spirits, and <U+017F>omwhat defective in the fir<U+017F>t affected parts indicateth <hi>Cephalicals,</hi> and <U+017F>uch things as facilitate the di<U+017F>tribution, as exerci<U+017F>es, rubbings, and the like. A defect of due <U+017F>tretching in the Nerves, or Nervous and Fibrous parts, indicateth tho<U+017F>e things as <hi>Corroborate</hi> the Nerves and <U+017F>trengthen the parts. Thus much of Indications Curative, the Pre<U+017F>ervative follow.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He<U+017F>e Indications are deduced either from the Antecedent or the pre<U+017F>ent cau<U+017F>es of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Tho<U+017F>e which flow from the former kind of cau<U+017F>es concern the <hi>Prophylactical</hi> Part: here we only propound tho<U+017F>e which proceed from cau<U+017F>es that are pre<U+017F>ent and contained in the Body; namly, from common cau<U+017F>es, or <U+017F>uch as are proper to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Now although that common cau<U+017F>es do not <U+017F>eem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to attain to the production of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; yet even in this re<U+017F>pect that they are e<U+017F>teemed an impediment, and may retard the cure, they Indicate their taking away.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es are either impurities, or excrementitious
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:169706:150"/>
humors collected and impacted in the fir<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, which unle<U+017F>s they be taken away, do not only infect the nouri<U+017F>hment inward, but they <U+017F>omwhat dul, or otherwi<U+017F>e hinder the appropriate Medicines. They indicate ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an evacuation either by a gentle vomit, or by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive purgation, as occa<U+017F>ion <U+017F>hal rather per<U+017F>wade to this or that: or they are common cau<U+017F>es deeper imbited into the Parts of the Body, and the<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o require an evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. But <U+017F>eing that according to this kind of common cau<U+017F>es it is at the <U+017F>ame time driven away and almo<U+017F>t with the <U+017F>ame Medicaments, as are the cau<U+017F>es which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, we <U+017F>hal conjoyn both the kinds of them in this pre<U+017F>ent con<U+017F>ideration.</p>
            <p>The cau<U+017F>es therfore which are proper to this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, as al<U+017F>o the Common cau<U+017F>es which have a deeper pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration into the Body, may be divided into Blood and <hi>Cacochymical</hi> humors. The Blood indeed, although it be rather deficient than redundant in the fir<U+017F>t Affected parts, yet in the Head for the mo<U+017F>t part it requires a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular evacuation, which u<U+017F>ually is performed by <U+017F>cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Veins in the hollow of the Ear. Hither likewi<U+017F>e we may partly refer bli<U+017F>ters rai<U+017F>ed between the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd turning Joynt of the Neck, although the<U+017F>e perhaps may relate over and above in part to the <hi>Cacochymical</hi> humors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cachochymical</hi> humors are divided into tho<U+017F>e which <U+017F>til flow in the channel of the Veins, and into tho<U+017F>e which are impacted in certain parts of the Body. The cau<U+017F>es or humors flowing in the Veins do (primarily and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally) Indicate their evacuation. But if they be unapt for motion (as to the execution) then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <U+017F>om previous preparation. But becau<U+017F>e it happens for the mo<U+017F>t part, that not al the humors are equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt, but that <U+017F>om are <U+017F>ufficiently flexible, and others not
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:169706:151"/>
<U+017F>o, but re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Medecines, in this ca<U+017F>e they indicate a le<U+017F>s evacuation and then a preparation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The<U+017F>e humors in the chanel of the Veyns may be <U+017F>ubdivided into Feaveri<U+017F>h (namly, if there be a putrid Feaver) and not Feaveri<U+017F>h. The Feaveri<U+017F>h hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are either <U+017F>welling, or not <U+017F>welling. The <U+017F>welling, that is, tho<U+017F>e which are unquiet, or impetuou<U+017F>ly agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do Indicate a <U+017F>udden evacuation, at lea<U+017F>t a le<U+017F><U+017F>er, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s perhaps they are carried of their accord to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and more ignoble parts, as it happens in the <U+017F>mall Pox, the Meazels, and the like Affects. But if a Feaver be pre<U+017F>ent, and that acute, and yet the humors are not <U+017F>welling, they chiefly Indicate that peculiar preparation which they cal coction, that by this means they may be obedient to the Medecine to be aftergiven, and than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacution, but if the Feaver not be acute but Chronical, although the matter be not irritated, and yet <U+017F>om part of it be <U+017F>ufficiently flexible; in this ca<U+017F>e, a le<U+017F><U+017F>er evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is fir<U+017F>t indicated at any time of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the coction of the relicts, that they al<U+017F>o in their time may be evacuated.</p>
            <p>The humors contained in the Veins which are not Feaveri<U+017F>h, if they are fluxible, they fir<U+017F>t indicate evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: but becau<U+017F>e in this Affect <U+017F>low, gro<U+017F>s, and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my humors are almo<U+017F>t perpetually pre<U+017F>ent, preparation (at lea<U+017F>t wher a le<U+017F><U+017F>er evacuation hath gon before) is fir<U+017F>t Indicated; and indeed the vi<U+017F>cous humors Indicate incident, and the thick attenuant remedies. Again, when the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> is very Chronical and extended to many months; yea, perhaps to a year and upwards, it is not to be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed that the whol matter cau<U+017F>ing the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> can at once be prepared or evacuated; wherfore in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<U+017F>pect it Indicateth, that we in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon things prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and evacuant by turns. Be<U+017F>ides we mu<U+017F>t know that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:169706:151"/>
Cholerick humors require one preparation and evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Melancholy humors another, flegm another, and watry humors another. And that the preparation and purgation is Indicated variou<U+017F>ly according to the diver<U+017F>ity of the humors commixed with the Blood.</p>
            <p>The humors that are impacted in certain parts of the Body do much more require preparation before they are evacuated; according to that of <hi>Hippocrates, When you would purg a Body, you mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t make it fluxible.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therdoth a certain general purgation <U+017F>uffice to <U+017F>ubdu the<U+017F> humors, but <U+017F>uch a preparation is required, that hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar reference to that part, in which they are inherent, and therfore the humors in the Liver require one kind of preparation, tho<U+017F>e in the Lungs another, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Finally, Seing that the propounded kinds of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, after they are evacuated, may grow and breed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; they Indicate an avoyding of <U+017F>uch things which may di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e the Body to an ea<U+017F>y generation of <U+017F>uch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: And thus much of Indications Pre<U+017F>ervative, it remaineth now that we con<U+017F>ider the Vital and Con<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The due Stretching of the Parts depending upon the Influx of the Brain.</p>
            <p>All the<U+017F>e things becau<U+017F>e life con<U+017F>i<U+017F>teth in them, are called <hi>Vital Indications.</hi> But among Authors for the mo<U+017F>t part they are known by the common name of the Spirits, but this name is <U+017F>omwhat to gro<U+017F>s, <U+017F>eing that in propriety of <U+017F>peech, the Spirits are radicated in the <U+017F>aid Con<U+017F>titutions, and are faculties of them. Yet we have no de<U+017F>ign to innovate the cu<U+017F>tom of <U+017F>peech, provided that the things may be under<U+017F>tood as it is.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e Indicants <U+017F>o long as they continue firm and <U+017F>ound, they require only a general and ordinary con<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the right u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ix non-Natural things<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> but when they are all alike vitiated or obnoxious to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent hurt, they require not only a general con<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but <U+017F>uch an one likewi<U+017F>e, as is mixt with cure and pre<U+017F>ervation. Again, Where <U+017F>ome one Con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or <U+017F>om one part therof is depraved more than the re<U+017F>t or <U+017F>ubject to <U+017F>uch depravation, be<U+017F>ides the general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation, it requireth in like manner an e<U+017F>pecial one to be a<U+017F><U+017F>ociated to the peculiar Curation. La<U+017F>tly, When a Con<U+017F>titution Subject to error, or actually erroneous is fixed to <U+017F>om certain part, it doth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <U+017F>pecify that con<U+017F>ervation; namly, that re<U+017F>pect may be al<U+017F>o had of the part <U+017F>o labouring more than the re<U+017F>t.</p>
            <p>But becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>om <U+017F>ay, That the Vital Indication is the only, and that Con<U+017F>ervation is the <U+017F>imple end, and that they cannot be further <U+017F>ubdivided, becau<U+017F>e that all things, which are according to Nature are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word Spirits, and that they Indicate one Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; namly, the pre<U+017F>ervation of them<U+017F>elvs. We grant indeed that the Spirits, if (as we have already noted) they be improperly taken for their cau<U+017F>es; namly, the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:169706:153"/>
three Con<U+017F>titutions afore<U+017F>aid, may in one word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend al things which are according to Nature, but then this word mu<U+017F>t be <hi>Generical,</hi> and divi<U+017F>ible into three <U+017F>pecies; namly, the three Con<U+017F>titutions, as Spirits Natural, Vital, and Animal. We grant al<U+017F>o that the end, or that the Indicated action is one; namly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation, but by the unity of the <hi>Genus,</hi> not of the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <U+017F>pecies. For tho<U+017F>e very things which are according to Nature, however they agree in the <hi>Genus,</hi> yet in the <U+017F>pecies they may differ among them<U+017F>elvs, and require a different con<U+017F>ervation; yea, it is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that tho<U+017F> things which con<U+017F>erv the Spirits on one part may impugn them on the other; as for example: Wine given may in one re<U+017F>pect cheri<U+017F>h and <U+017F>trengthen the Vital Spirits, or rather the Vital Con<U+017F>titution, but in the interim it may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and debilitate the Animal Spirits, or the Animal Con<U+017F>titution. In like manner the Temperament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth one pre<U+017F>ervation, the Structure of the Organs another, and the Continuity another. Yea, the very different Con<U+017F>titution of the parts Indicates a various con<U+017F>ervation, neither do we after one and the <U+017F>ame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or by the <U+017F>ame actions provide for the <U+017F>pecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation of the Liver, Lungs, Brain, &amp;c. Wherfore when <U+017F>om one Con<U+017F>titution is more infirm then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or when <U+017F>om one part is weaker than another, it Indicates a proper con<U+017F>ervation peculiar and <U+017F>pecial to it <U+017F>elf, and therfore both Con<U+017F>ervation and Con<U+017F>ervants may be divided into their Species. For the Con<U+017F>ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; the Con<U+017F>ervants appropriated to the Animal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution, differ from tho<U+017F>e which are de<U+017F>tinated to the Vital or Natural: And from hence the three fir<U+017F>t kinds of Con<U+017F>ervation are to be deducted, namly, the Con<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Animal, the Vital, and the Natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titution. In like manner the Con<U+017F>ervation of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:169706:153"/>
is accompli<U+017F>hed by the u<U+017F>e of the Hepaticals, and of the Lungs by <hi>Pectorals,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, all parts of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent diver<U+017F>ity do <U+017F>ubdivide the con<U+017F>ervation into <U+017F>o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more <U+017F>pecies. Thus much of the divi<U+017F>ion of Con<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation into its <U+017F>pecies.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The <U+017F>ame Con<U+017F>ervation <U+017F>eemeth to be further divi<U+017F>ible unto its parts. For this Con<U+017F>ervation is <U+017F>omwhat complicated, and doth not only relate to <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but in <U+017F>om <U+017F>ort to contraries, to wit, Indicates both Curative and Pre<U+017F>ervative, and either permitteth or di<U+017F>alloweth tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>ame things being e<U+017F>timated with the Spirits. It <U+017F>eemeth therfore to be branched into three parts, into an election of like matters, into an election of contraries under a certain condition, and into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the <U+017F>ame under a diver<U+017F>e condition.</p>
            <p>The election of like things is the mo<U+017F>t appropriated <hi>Action</hi> to Con<U+017F>ervation, and <U+017F>eems withal to have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to two kinds of things alike; namely, <U+017F>uch as are ea<U+017F>ily a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated, and are properly nouri<U+017F>hments, and <U+017F>uch which although they cannot be a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect of their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, yet they contain within the <U+017F>ame qualities like unto the con<U+017F>titution of certain parts, in re<U+017F>pect wherof they are reputed amicable and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to Nature, and do cheri<U+017F>h and <U+017F>trengthen certain parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You wil <U+017F>ay,</hi> The<U+017F>e are indeed Alterants and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the kind of contraries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We an<U+017F>wer,</hi> That in a diver<U+017F> re<U+017F>pect they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to each kind, but in as much as they obtain qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities like unto the du Nature of the parts, although o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi<U+017F>e they alter <U+017F>om <U+017F>mal matter, yet they are to be referred to the <U+017F>imilaries. For the very nouri<U+017F>hments do in <U+017F>om degree alter, and are directly contrary to empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and con<U+017F>ervation it <U+017F>elf doth implicitly include a
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:169706:154"/>
certain correction, as we have <U+017F>hewed above. Now the<U+017F>e indeed in regard of a middle nature, which they have between <U+017F>imilaries and Alterants, are not called Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, but Strengthners, Con<U+017F>ervants, and Cordials; Again, the<U+017F>e are Indicated as Con<U+017F>ervants by the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar debility of the Spirits, and as to be elected, and not only permitted, and <U+017F>o they are e<U+017F>teemed in the Books of Practical Authors.</p>
            <p>The Permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a remedy <U+017F>omwhat contrary to Nature doth likewi<U+017F>e belong to this Indication. For <U+017F>uch is the dignity and valu of this Indication, as it <U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons both the Curative and Pre<U+017F>ervative Indicates to an examination before they are reduced into practice, and doth not only moderate and limit the quality and quantity of the remedy, but al<U+017F>o the very time of repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, yea, what<U+017F>oever appertaineth to the u<U+017F>e therof, or the manner of u<U+017F>ing it, and al this lea<U+017F>t in any wi<U+017F>e it <U+017F>hould exceed the Spirits of the Patient, or be injurious to them: nor is the excellency of it thus circum<U+017F>cribed, but it requireth more; namly, that more profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage may accrue to the things, according to Nature by impugnation of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, then hurt or detriment by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny violence offered to Nature. And under this Law and Condition. Vital Indication permitteth many things to be don, which of them<U+017F>elvs are contrary to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, yet always in favor of health, never to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Life.</p>
            <p>A prohibition of a contrary is altogether a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Action</hi> of this Indication, and by a kind of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>dictates</hi> this or that thing not to be don, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were otherwi<U+017F>e Indicated) becau<U+017F> perhaps it endangers life it <U+017F>elf, or brings more di<U+017F>advantage than benefit of health to the parts. And this is the third and la<U+017F>t force and u<U+017F>e of this Indication. We <U+017F>hall
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:169706:154"/>
now in one word apply the<U+017F>e things to the pre<U+017F>ent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>All Con<U+017F>titutions in this <hi>Affect</hi> are very weak and infirm; and this is manife<U+017F>t from the bare con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this tender age. But the Natural doth yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <U+017F>uffer by the force of the fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; and from hence al<U+017F>o the Vital is <U+017F>omwhat weakned, and indeed neither doth the Animal e<U+017F>cape wholly free, as was <U+017F>hewed above. Wherfore both a general and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o a particular regard mu<U+017F>t be had to the<U+017F>e Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titutions, as wel in the <hi>Election</hi> of Similaries, as in the permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion or prohibition of contraries.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, Therfore in this <hi>Affect</hi> you mu<U+017F>t make choice of the be<U+017F>t nouri<U+017F>hments, <U+017F>uch as are ea<U+017F>y of <hi>concoction,</hi> and as neer as you can agreable to the cu<U+017F>tom and age of the Patient, to the time of the year, &amp;c. the contraries mu<U+017F>t be abandoned, namly, <U+017F>uch things as nouri<U+017F>h little, are difficult of dige<U+017F>tion, and incongruous to the cu<U+017F>tom, age, and <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Tho<U+017F>e things mu<U+017F>t be cho<U+017F>en which cheri<U+017F>h and <U+017F>trengthen the weaker Con<U+017F>titutions, and the parts that are mo<U+017F>t <hi>Affected,</hi> and the<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be either exhibited <U+017F>everally, or they mu<U+017F>t be mingled with nouri<U+017F>hments or Medicines; but <U+017F>uch things as are neither <U+017F>erviceable to this <U+017F>cope, nor otherwi<U+017F>e In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, mu<U+017F>t be totally avoyded.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Benign and gentle evacuants, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ufficiently <hi>corrected,</hi> mu<U+017F>t be allowed in a moderate quantity, ju<U+017F>t and du interval of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ob<U+017F>erved. But the contrary things; namely, violent and fierce purgers, e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch as are apt to di<U+017F><U+017F>olv the parts, or are exhibited in an undu quantity, or too often repeated, are forbidden.</p>

Fourthly, Remedies alterant, or <U+017F>uch as prepare the humors, or <hi>correct</hi> the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> mu<U+017F>t be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <U+017F>uch al<U+017F>o as are friendly and familiar to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or <U+017F>uch as may be made <U+017F>uch by good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that is, by compo<U+017F>ition or <U+017F>ufficient <hi>correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Remedies violently alterant, extream hot, and vehemently di<U+017F>cutient, or any other which in any wi<U+017F>e re<U+017F>olv and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate the parts.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving propounded the three kinds of <U+017F>imple Indications, and deduced them into their lowe<U+017F>t <U+017F>pecies, we <U+017F>hal in the next place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider <hi>the right u<U+017F>e &amp; admini<U+017F>tration</hi> of them. The exact knowledg wherof <U+017F>eems impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without rode and experience. For it de<U+017F>cendeth unto Individuals, and comprehends not only the <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of a thing among <U+017F>o many Indicates <U+017F>imply to be don in the Species, but al<U+017F>o <hi>the invention of quantity, place, form, time, order, and matter of the remedy to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Con<U+017F>ent</hi> and <hi>Di<U+017F><U+017F>ent</hi> of Indications do contribute much to this invention. Now the <hi>Con<U+017F>ent</hi> may be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: of <hi>Coindication</hi> and <hi>Permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion</hi> may be either an <hi>Advantage</hi> or a <hi>Lo<U+017F>s</hi> to him that permitteth
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:169706:155"/>
or neither of them. A <hi>Permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion</hi> that cannot be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>without hurt;</hi> mu<U+017F>t never be allowed without the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>t circum<U+017F>pection, and <U+017F>o much the greater, as the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage may be the more to him that permitteth. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Permittent may part with <U+017F>omwhat of his private right to advance the publick good, yet in re<U+017F>pect that he is a member of the whol he is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to be a gainer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Di<U+017F><U+017F>ent of Indicants</hi> is twofold; namly, either <hi>Contradictory</hi> or <hi>Contrary.</hi> The <hi>Contradictory</hi> among the Books is called <hi>Interdiction</hi> or <hi>Prohibition,</hi> and for the mo<U+017F>t part it is appropriated to the Spirits, unto w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> in this re<U+017F>pect we mu<U+017F>t always yeeld obedience. The <hi>Contrary</hi> is called <hi>Contra-indication,</hi> and this doth not <U+017F>imply forbid, but <U+017F>o far forth as it undergoeth the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an impediment, or <U+017F>om more urgent Indicate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir<U+017F>t,</hi> Where <hi>Indicants</hi> con<U+017F>ent, either by <hi>Coindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion,</hi> <U+017F>atisfaction if it be fea<U+017F>ible mu<U+017F>t be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to al the <hi>Indicates:</hi> But if this cannot be performed Medicines of that Nature are to be preferred before the re<U+017F>t, which are corre<U+017F>pondent to mo<U+017F>t, or at lea<U+017F>t to the mo<U+017F>t urgent Scopes. But if <U+017F>uch <U+017F>imples cannot be found out, then you mu<U+017F>t in<U+017F>titute an apt compo<U+017F>ition of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>e <U+017F>imples one with another.</p>
            <p>The E<U+017F><U+017F>ential parts of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, although they are very various, yet is there not any con<U+017F>iderable di<U+017F>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among them, and nothing hindreth but in a great part they may be con<U+017F>idered together. For Medicines temperatly hot and dry, may at once cheri<U+017F>h the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Spirits, and perhaps conduce to the <U+017F>cattring of the numbne<U+017F>s in them, and withal <U+017F>omwhat fortify the <hi>Tone</hi> of the parts, and facilitate the equal di<U+017F>tribution of the Blood, and con<U+017F>equently the equality of the Nutrition: al<U+017F>o it may increa<U+017F>e vigor in the Vital and Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:169706:156"/>
proritate the Arteries in the fir<U+017F>t <hi>affected</hi> parts, and <U+017F>trengthen the Nervs: unto which Heads almo<U+017F>t al the Indicates of the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> may not unaptly be referred. Moreover, the Spirits al<U+017F>o, although they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit all extream hot things, yet they allow of the<U+017F>e as mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g>derat, and very congruous to Nature. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there is little or no particular repugnance between the<U+017F>e cau<U+017F>es and the Indicates, albeit in re<U+017F>pect of time and the order of admini<U+017F>tration <U+017F>om di<U+017F><U+017F>ent may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved, as we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee afterwards in due place.</p>
            <p>Wherfore in what re<U+017F>pect and how far the<U+017F>e agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether whil<U+017F>t we intend a cure, we do at once re<U+017F>pect not only the Spirits, but in <U+017F>om <U+017F>ort the cau<U+017F>es, by choo<U+017F>ing <U+017F>uch curative remedies, or by mingling <U+017F>uch ingredients with them, which are able both to attenuate the thick matter, to cut into the vi<U+017F>cous, to open the ob<U+017F>tructed pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, and the like. In like manner, whil<U+017F>t we are chiefly imployed either in pre<U+017F>ervation, or in the root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of cau<U+017F>es, we make choice of <U+017F>uch evacuants, or el<U+017F> we compound them with <U+017F>uch remedies, as are al<U+017F>o partly contrary to the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. And all the<U+017F>e things we do to that purpo<U+017F>e; as that (as hath been <U+017F>aid) we may be <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient to the mo<U+017F>t intentions we can.</p>
            <p>Now having found out the <hi>actions</hi> <U+017F>imply requi<U+017F>it in the Species, in the next place we <U+017F>hal enquire out their <hi>du circum<U+017F>tances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard that this is a great Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> it requireth a <hi>great quantity of the Remedy,</hi> in re<U+017F>pect of it <U+017F>elf. For a <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> unequal to the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> cannot extirpate it. It is nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary therfore that the do<U+017F>e of the Medicine be equally to the magnitude of the <hi>Affect.</hi> But in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits permit not <U+017F>o great a quantity of <hi>Remedies</hi> to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at once. Wherfore that quantity mu<U+017F>t be divided &amp; given by turns. For this is a Chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, and of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:169706:156"/>
<U+017F>low motion, neither doth it nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily require an ha<U+017F>ty Cure, and although the Spirits cannot wel endure either vehement Remedies or <U+017F>uch as are given in a large do<U+017F>e, yet they permit the u<U+017F>e of Evacuant Medicins by an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra<U+017F>is.</hi> Wherfore by turns, we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>omtimes make u<U+017F>e of Remedies Preparatory, <U+017F>omtimes Evacuant, <U+017F>omtimes Alterant, and <U+017F>omtimes <U+017F>trengthing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For <U+017F>o much as belongeth to <hi>the place of admini<U+017F>tration,</hi> the general Rule is, that the remedy ought to arive at the <U+017F>eat, and penetrate to the very Cau<U+017F>e of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. If therfore it mu<U+017F>t have a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age into the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, it mu<U+017F>t be taken at the Mouth; but if it will <U+017F>uffice to touch only the thick Guts, it mu<U+017F>t be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Fundament. If the humors be naturally ready to move upwards, expel them by vomit; if down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evacuat them by <U+017F>iege. In like manner you mu<U+017F>t humor the inclination of Nature, and root out the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es by <U+017F>pitting, by Urin, or by <U+017F>weating. Particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations mu<U+017F>t be in<U+017F>tituted in the very affected parts, or in the parts adjacent. For <U+017F>o the force of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth the more <U+017F>urely make way to the <U+017F>eat of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ea<U+017F> and the morbifical Cau<U+017F>. And for the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on external and topical Medicines mu<U+017F>t be applied to the next convenient place. Yet you mu<U+017F>t know that there is a certain Sympathy between <U+017F>om parts, in which ca<U+017F>e the remedies ar frequently admini<U+017F>tred to the part, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that con<U+017F>ent intercedeth, and neither to the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nor the adjacent part.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The form of the Medicament</hi> doth partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Rule la<U+017F>t propounded. For if the <U+017F>cope be to lenifie the Jaws or the Windpipe, we chu<U+017F>e a lic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or lapping form, that by degrees the remedy may <U+017F>lide over the affected parts, and <U+017F>tay the longer upon them. In like manner, if the Stomach be affected, we
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:169706:157"/>
often pre<U+017F>cribe Pils, Pouders or Electuaries, that they may the longer abide in the Stomach. To the Kidnies we rather de<U+017F>ign liquid things, that they may the more ea<U+017F>ily be carried down to them with the wheyi<U+017F>h part of the Blood. The forms do al<U+017F>o in <U+017F>om part depend upon the very nature of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, as in burning Feavers li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid things are for the mo<U+017F>t part convenient, dry things are <U+017F>carce admitted; on the other <U+017F>ide, in moi<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and when the Belly is over<U+017F>oluble, more <U+017F>olid forms are preferred. Finally, the forms of the Medicines do al<U+017F>o partly depend upon the nature of the Ingredients. So Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ia worketh mo<U+017F>t effectually in the form of a <hi>Bolus;</hi> Hart<U+017F>horn, Coral, and the like in the form of a Pouder; in like manner bitter things, <U+017F>uch as beget a vomiting, and <U+017F>tinking things are concealed in the form of Pills; <U+017F>omtimes al<U+017F>o they are guilded, or el<U+017F> they are enwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Wafers, and exhibited in the form of a <hi>Bolus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it mu<U+017F>t here be noted, that for the mo<U+017F>t part the form of the Remedy is not <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable, as it gives place to the more ea<U+017F>ie and commodious admini<U+017F>tration, in re<U+017F>pect of the Admi<U+017F><U+017F>ion or Reception of the Sick. For many cannot <U+017F>wallow Pills, others pre<U+017F>ently reject their Potions by vomit, &amp; others are perhaps aver<U+017F> from other forms. In this Affect, in regard that all Children almo<U+017F>t are loth to take Phy<U+017F>ick, that form is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the re<U+017F>t, which <U+017F>hall be ob<U+017F>erved to be lea<U+017F>t di<U+017F>ta<U+017F>tful to them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As for <hi>the time of action,</hi> you mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>o en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to <U+017F>it your admini<U+017F>trations, that they may as little as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible be interupted with times of eating, exerci<U+017F>e, or <U+017F>leep, for at this age the Spirits are <U+017F>carce pre<U+017F>erved <U+017F>ound and perfect, without an interpo<U+017F>ition of tho<U+017F>e things by ju<U+017F>t internals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:169706:157"/>
Remedies evacuant, opening, attenuate and incident, mu<U+017F>t be taken early in the morning upon an empty <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; and if they mu<U+017F>t be repeated the <U+017F>ame day, four of the Clock in the afternoon (upon an empty <U+017F>tomach likewi<U+017F>e) is the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable hour. Strengthning and a<U+017F>tringent Medicines, and <U+017F>uch as provoke <U+017F>leep, are to be taken rather in the evening than in the morning; but perhaps <U+017F>om of the<U+017F>e are mo<U+017F>t agreable after meals.</p>
            <p>Medicines that are mingled with the nouri<U+017F>hment, ought to be gratful to the Palat, le<U+017F>t they <U+017F>ubvert the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and hinder concoction, or cau<U+017F> a loathing of the meat, or el<U+017F> empair the Spirits.</p>
            <p>As for the order of proceeding, there occur two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules. The former is, That that mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t be don, which being premi<U+017F>ed makes way for the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and therfore that ought fir<U+017F>t to be removed which hath the con<U+017F>ideration of an impediment in re<U+017F>pect of what mu<U+017F>t follow. The later is, That we mu<U+017F>t ever give our fir<U+017F>t help to the more urgent and weighty Indicant, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>om impediment intervene.</p>
            <p>If the Que<U+017F>tion therfore be, <hi>Whether the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, or the Cau<U+017F> of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> doth fir<U+017F>t require the help of Phy<U+017F>ick?</hi> The an<U+017F>wer wil be obvious according to the fir<U+017F>t Rule: For the cau<U+017F>es are reflected upon under the notion of an impediment in re<U+017F>pect of the Cure of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>; for they cheri<U+017F>h it, and infringe the vertu<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> of the Medicins. Wherfore, before that we are intent upon the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hing of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, we premi<U+017F>e all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible endeavors to root out the Cau<U+017F>, or at lea<U+017F>t to le<U+017F><U+017F>en, abate and retund it, that it may oppo<U+017F>e no con<U+017F>iderable force to retard the rooting out of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Yet in the interim whil<U+017F>t we are bu<U+017F>ie in the removal of the Cau<U+017F>es, the E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> mu<U+017F>t not be totally neglected, as we have before admoni<U+017F>hed. Yea when we have <U+017F>o <U+017F>ubdued the Cau<U+017F>e
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:169706:158"/>
that it cannot for the pre<U+017F>ent much interupt the Cure, we may (the Cau<U+017F>es not being utterly over-come and ca<U+017F>t out) the more diligently and earne<U+017F>tly attempt the re<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ting of the affect; yet with this condition, That if the Cau<U+017F>es revert and becom new impediments, that then we are obliged pre<U+017F>ently to undertake the <U+017F>ubduing and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of them: <U+017F>o that in this Chronical Affect, <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Cau<U+017F>es, <U+017F>omtimes the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> mu<U+017F>t be re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by turns: and the Spirits do better undergo this change of action, than if we <U+017F>hould continualy make our battery again<U+017F>t the Cau<U+017F>es, till they were ab<U+017F>olutely rooted out.</p>
            <p>Moreover, When the Cau<U+017F>es of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect are unapt for motion by rea<U+017F>on of their toughne<U+017F>s, gro<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, and perhaps <U+017F>etledne<U+017F>s; they mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t be freed from this impediment and prepared before they are eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated. For according to the Rule of the great Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Quae movenda <U+017F>unt, fluida prius facere oportet.</hi> In like manner, that thickne<U+017F>s, toughne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>etledne<U+017F>s of matter, if it be pre<U+017F>ent, indicate Remedies attenuant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident and opening. But the<U+017F>e things are not <U+017F>afly taken the impurities <U+017F>till flowing back<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>into the fir<U+017F>t Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, for then perhaps they are carried along with the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines into the Veins, and more defile the Blood, or at lea<U+017F>t hinder the efficacy of the Remedies. The<U+017F>e ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have the nature of an impediment, and mu<U+017F>t be in the fir<U+017F>t place removed.</p>
            <p>La<U+017F>tly, Univer<U+017F>al Evacuants mu<U+017F>t be premi<U+017F>ed before Particular and Topical Remedies, e<U+017F>pecially where it is not permitted at once to mind both intentions. For the Univer<U+017F>al Cau<U+017F>es flowing in the Body are ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>urroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the room of Particular Evacuations, and renew the Afflux to the fir<U+017F>t affected part: but the thinner part of Particular Cau<U+017F>es and that which is mo<U+017F>t apt for
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:169706:158"/>
motion is evacuated, but the thicker perhaps is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted. Wherfore Univer<U+017F>al Cau<U+017F>es yet flowing to and fro in the Body, as con<U+017F>idered are Impediments in re<U+017F>pect of Particular Evacuation, and by con<U+017F>equence mu<U+017F>t be fir<U+017F>t expelled.</p>
            <p>The latter Rule was, <hi>That we mu<U+017F>t releeve the more urgent and weighty Indicant fir<U+017F>t, unle<U+017F>s there be an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of <U+017F>om impediment.</hi> That is termed an urgent Indicant which threatneth the mo<U+017F>t danger. Now every <U+017F>uch Indicant is <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to induce great afflictions into the Body, and not without manife<U+017F>t danger to wa<U+017F>t the Spirits. Therfore in this re<U+017F>pect, we mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>omtimes fir<U+017F>t help the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, the Cau<U+017F> being neglected: Somtimes al<U+017F>o we mu<U+017F>t neglect both the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> and the Cau<U+017F>es, and adre<U+017F>s our endeavors to the pacification of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, as in a vehement Flux of the Belly, long Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, profu<U+017F>e and immoderat Sweating, and the like. But even in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es, we mu<U+017F>t have a prudent regard both to the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> and the Cau<U+017F>es, and when the urgent Symptom is corrected, or the violence of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, then we mu<U+017F>t return to the regular Method of proceeding; for this Rule belongs not to the ordinary and legitimate order of Cure, but to the Method of Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to perfect the right admini<U+017F>tration of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, there is required an exact and accurat know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the <hi>Medical Matter</hi> whereof we <U+017F>hal di<U+017F>cour<U+017F> in the <U+017F>ub<U+017F>equent Chapters.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXIX. The Medical Matter an<U+017F>wering to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications</hi> propo<U+017F>ed, and fir<U+017F>t the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Medical Matter</hi> mu<U+017F>t be found out by Experience and <hi>Analogi<U+017F>mes,</hi> or Arguments drawn by an an<U+017F>werable nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity from the Cau<U+017F> to the Effect; although the truth is we conceive not any other Rea<U+017F>onings to be ab<U+017F>olutly excluded. It is vulgarly and not unaptly di<U+017F>tributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three kinds, The <hi>Chirurgical,</hi> the <hi>Pharmateutical,</hi> and the <hi>Diatetical:</hi> Of the<U+017F>e in their order.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chirurgical</hi> commonly received and approved in this Affect, and famous above the re<U+017F>t, are chiefly two; <hi>Scarification of the Ears,</hi> and <hi>little Fountains</hi> or <hi>I<U+017F><U+017F>ues.</hi> But our enquiry (as we <U+017F>hal <U+017F>ee anon) <U+017F>hal be extended to many more, namly of Cuppin-Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es, Leeches, Bli<U+017F>ters, Ligatures, and Swathing-bands: But the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Vein the Spirits cannot brook, as every one knows, who but ob<U+017F>erves the frailty of the age, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of the habit of the parts, and the <U+017F>malne<U+017F>s of the Veins.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scarification of the Ears</hi> <U+017F>hal lead our di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>. The <hi>Empericks</hi> who undertake the cure of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, make more of it than one would imagin. For in their practice they celerate it with great vaporing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it <U+017F>carce hope for a happy cure. But we, although we
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:169706:159"/>
di<U+017F>allow not this kind of remedy, have <U+017F>een many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully recovered without the u<U+017F>e therof. And they them<U+017F>elves who attribute mo<U+017F>t unto it, for the mo<U+017F>t part take away no con<U+017F>iderable portion of Blood. Yet <U+017F>ome affirm that they have <U+017F>een a large quantity of Blood drawn away with good event. However it be, it is credible that tho<U+017F>e Children do with mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>e en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this remedy, and obtain mo<U+017F>t profit by the u<U+017F>e of it, which are of a Sanguin complexion and wel habited, and who are affected with an <hi>Alogotrophy,</hi> rather than an <hi>Atrophy</hi> or a Con<U+017F>umption, or any other remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extenuation of the parts. Our Practitioners for mo<U+017F>t part repeat this operation two or three times in a week. They <U+017F>eldom do it with an In<U+017F>trument or <U+017F>harp Pen-knife, but mo<U+017F>t commonly with an ordinary blunt Knife, taking no notice of the pain and crying of the Child. Moreover, For the mo<U+017F>t part they perform it in the hollow of the Ear, but <U+017F>ome extend it to the inward and outward circumference of the upper part of the Ear, yea to the whol circumference. No man hitherto as we know have attempted the Scarification of the hinder <U+017F>ide of the Ear, although indeed it is not ea<U+017F>ie to give a rea<U+017F>on, why it <U+017F>hould conduce le<U+017F>s being admini<U+017F>tred there than in the hollow part.</p>
            <p>Yet it may be lawful for us to offer our conjectures why the hollow of the Ear <U+017F>hould be cho<U+017F>en before the other parts for this operation, which notwith<U+017F>tanding we will not confidently a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, although we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e we can at lea<U+017F>t probably a<U+017F><U+017F>ert it, if that be true which the mo<U+017F>t diligent Chyrurgion <hi>Fubricius Hildanus</hi> hath written in his <hi>Ob<U+017F>erv.</hi> 4. <hi>Centur.</hi> 1. <hi>de nervo quinti parts:</hi> For this conjecture is grounded upon this Ob<U+017F>ervation, and if that be ruinous this perhaps mu<U+017F>t peri<U+017F>h with it. The Conjecture is this, <hi>The di<U+017F>tribution and u<U+017F>e of the</hi>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:169706:160"/>
               <hi>Nerve and of the fifth Pair before mentioned being <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ed, Scarification in the hollow of the Ear may very conveniently both free that Nerve from any kind of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>hake off the numbne<U+017F>s, and give it vigor.</hi> For the hollow of the Ear is the next place unto it which we can come at with an in<U+017F>trument. Wherfore evacuation being here made may immediatly drive away the matter which commonly oppre<U+017F><U+017F>eth the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Nerve, and withal cau<U+017F>ing pain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ing the heat, and may drive out all <U+017F>tupidne<U+017F>s from within it, and ad vigor unto it. If this Nerve therfore (as that famous Chyrurgion affirmeth) or a part therof be di<U+017F>tributed unto the Marrow of the Back and never for<U+017F>akes the Marrow of the Back, but <U+017F>hooteth out little Branches with the Nervs of the Marrow of the Back to the ends of the very Legs and Feet; it may ea<U+017F>ily be granted, that this Nerve thus delivered from ob<U+017F>tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thus excited and having gotten vigor, may likewi<U+017F>e in <U+017F>ome manner excite the Marrow of the Back it <U+017F>elf, and all the Nerves from thence ari<U+017F>ing, which by that opinion it doth accompany to the very end of the Body, and imprint <U+017F>ome vigor in them. Wherfore Scarificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being made in that place mu<U+017F>t needs be of greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, than if it were in<U+017F>tituted in any other part of the <U+017F>ame Ear, more remote from the afore<U+017F>aid Nerve. The <U+017F>ame may almo<U+017F>t be <U+017F>aid concerning the little wound here made by a blunt Knife. For <U+017F>ome Practical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itians affirm that the excellency of this operation relats not <U+017F>o much to the quantity of the Blood to be drawn, as to the <U+017F>tirring up of pain in that part; which any man may ea<U+017F>ily reduce to the <U+017F>tirring up of the vigor of the Nerve of the Fifth Pair.</p>
            <p>But omitting this Conjecture we will propound <U+017F>ome other Con<U+017F>iderations, in re<U+017F>pect wherof this Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:169706:160"/>
may be u<U+017F>eful in this affect. Fir<U+017F>t, By this means we obtain a certain particular evacuation of the Head, which part, if any other is in this Affect oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with a particular fulne<U+017F>s. Secondly, By the very evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood we <U+017F>omwhat correct the thickne<U+017F>s and toughne<U+017F>s therof, and by con<U+017F>equence we promove the more equal di<U+017F>tribution of it, and a more regular and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Nouri<U+017F>hment of the Parts. Thirdly, By this means we in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort drive away the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment of the parts.</p>
            <p>It mu<U+017F>t be noted that this operation when it perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a particular and local evacuation, doth not <U+017F>imply de<U+017F>erve the fir<U+017F>t place in the Method of Cure, but mu<U+017F>t follow in its order, Univer<U+017F>als being premi<U+017F>ed.</p>
            <p>La<U+017F>tly, It <U+017F>eems to be ridiculous and <U+017F>uper<U+017F>titious which <U+017F>ome are bu<U+017F>ie about when they admini<U+017F>ter this Scarification; whil<U+017F>t they fa<U+017F>ten the Blood of the right Ear <U+017F>uck'd up into Wool to the left <hi>Hypochondry,</hi> and the Blood of the left to the right. Thus much of Scarification.</p>
            <p>I<U+017F><U+017F>ues in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> are much approved, and we have known <U+017F>ome Children cured only by the help of this means. For it doth not only perform all tho<U+017F>e things, which even now we a<U+017F>cribed to the Scarification of the Ears, but more particularly it is a powerful remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the <hi>Hydrocephalus,</hi> both Curative and Pre<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and very much conduceth to le<U+017F><U+017F>en the unu<U+017F>ual mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the Head, and to evacuate the <U+017F>uperfluous watrine<U+017F>s therof. And la<U+017F>tly, to repre<U+017F>s the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate encrea<U+017F> of the Bones. Al<U+017F>o it manife<U+017F>tly drieth up the too much humidity of the Spinal Marrow, exciteth heat, <U+017F>trengthens the Nerves, and expelleth the a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment.</p>
            <p>Now becau<U+017F> this kind of remedy is properly a little
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:169706:161"/>
Ulcer<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and cau<U+017F>eth <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall pain to the Child that hath it, and bringeth dayly <U+017F>ome trouble to the Nur<U+017F>, it ought not to be pre<U+017F>cribed, unle<U+017F>s the greatne<U+017F>s of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be <U+017F>uch that we de<U+017F>pair to conquer it by other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies without the concurrence of this.</p>
            <p>This little Fountain mu<U+017F>t be made between the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Third turning Joynt of the Neck. Some Burn it with actual Cauteri<U+017F>ing, but we di<U+017F>approve of this way in regard of the vehemence of the pain: Some effect it with a potential Cauteri<U+017F>ing: but neither do we like this, becau<U+017F> all Cau<U+017F>ticks are adver<U+017F> to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Infant, in<U+017F>inuating <U+017F>ome venemous quality, and at lea<U+017F>t do too much di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate the Spirits, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the parts. Therfore we allow rather of an I<U+017F><U+017F>ue made by Simple inci<U+017F>ion with a <U+017F>harp Penknife.</p>
            <p>Some make u<U+017F>e of Iron tongues contrived for this purpo<U+017F>e, wherwith they take hold of the Skin, the place of inci<U+017F>ion being fir<U+017F>t mark'd with ink, and by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate compre<U+017F><U+017F>ion they dull the <U+017F>en<U+017F> of the part, and then they thru<U+017F>t in the Pen-knife through the middle of the tongs which is pierced with a longi<U+017F>h hole, and <U+017F>o they make the inci<U+017F>ion. Having made the wound they <U+017F>top in either an Artificial or a Natural Pea<U+017F>e, putting upon it a dige<U+017F>tive Plai<U+017F>ter: upon this they wrap a Paper or a linnen cloath divers times doubled, and fa<U+017F>ten to it as it were a Buckler made of <U+017F>ome <U+017F>olid matter, unto which four <U+017F>wathing bands are <U+017F>ewed; thus much of I<U+017F><U+017F>ues. In the next place we <U+017F>hall examin <U+017F>ome other kind of Chyrurgical Operations.</p>
            <p>And fir<U+017F>t Leeches offer them<U+017F>elves. Truly we have not yet <U+017F>ufficiently tryed how beneficial the application of them may be in this Affect. But if we con<U+017F>ult Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that more hurt than advantage may be expected from this remedy. For if they are applied to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:169706:161"/>
any part of the Head, by rea<U+017F>on of their continual <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they would ea<U+017F>ily cau<U+017F> a more violent afflux of the Blood to tho<U+017F>e parts. And if they be applied to other parts, they draw the Blood from the parts which before had too little.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Cuppingla<U+017F><U+017F>es are not (we conceive) <U+017F>o dangerous as needle<U+017F>s; indeed we altogether reject tho<U+017F>e that are mini<U+017F>tred with Scarification, not only for the Rea<U+017F>ons ju<U+017F>t now deduced from the Leeches, but being moved both by fear of dejecting the Spirits by rea<U+017F>on of the pain, and al<U+017F>o in regard of the trouble<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s of the admini<U+017F>tration. Cuppin Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es without Scarification, as we began to <U+017F>ay, <U+017F>eem not refu<U+017F>able either by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, or the cau<U+017F>es of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. But the<U+017F>e are very little effectual, and we leave it to be perpended, whether the profit ari<U+017F>ing from the u<U+017F>e of them, what<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, can recompence the trouble of the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Neverthele<U+017F>s it may happen by rea<U+017F>on of the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <U+017F>ome other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, that the u<U+017F>e of them may be of <U+017F>ome moment, as in a Pleuri<U+017F>ie, a Phren<U+017F>y, and wher <U+017F>om dangerous Flux is iminent again<U+017F>t <U+017F>om princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part; in which ca<U+017F>e, tho<U+017F>e perhaps that are adhibited with Scarification, may be admitted in great and <U+017F>trong Children. But then you mu<U+017F>t apply them to the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Joynts of the Neck, the Shoulders, the Hanches, to the inner parts of the Thighs, to the <U+017F>oals of the Feet, and to other places as the peculiar complicated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <U+017F>hall require.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it mu<U+017F>t be noted, that in an age <U+017F>o tender, you mu<U+017F>t make u<U+017F>e of very <U+017F>mal <hi>Cuppin-gla<U+017F><U+017F>es,</hi> and that they mu<U+017F>t be applyed with a le<U+017F>s flame then they are wont to be in others of mans e<U+017F>tate, and that the <U+017F>carifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, if at all it be admitted, mu<U+017F>t be don with a gentle hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:169706:162"/>
Thirdly, As for Bli<U+017F>ters, although hitherto we have not had <U+017F>ufficient trial of them, and although we bani<U+017F>h from this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> both <U+017F>eptical applications, becau<U+017F> they di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the parts, and al<U+017F>o cau<U+017F>tical, becau<U+017F>e they pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate deeper and produce a cru<U+017F>ted <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, yet we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that tho<U+017F>e <hi>Pyrotical</hi> remedies which only rai<U+017F>e Bli<U+017F>ters in the Skin may be <U+017F>omtimes profitably admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>You wil <U+017F>ay that Cantharides wherwith they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made are extream hot, and be<U+017F>ides <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected to be of a venemous quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We an<U+017F>wer,</hi> That we may not here in<U+017F>ert any thing of the qualities of Cantharides, we grant that which is a<U+017F><U+017F>erted. But becau<U+017F> they are admini<U+017F>tred only to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward little Skin, and only to a little part therof not much extended, and becau<U+017F> as <U+017F>oon as the bli<U+017F>ters are rai<U+017F>ed they are removed, the exce<U+017F>s of their heat and their poy<U+017F>on <U+017F>carce penetrates deeper into the Body, than the bottom of the <hi>Epidermis,</hi> and therfore this remedy may be applyed without any notable harm or danger. But then you may demand what profit can ari<U+017F>e from hence? We affirm, that it doth effectually correct a cold and moi<U+017F>t di<U+017F>temper, and potently di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment of the Marrow of the Back, the Brain, Nervs, and the Nervous parts, and withal that they make all the parts more firm and <U+017F>teady, and <U+017F>tir up a <U+017F>tronger Pul<U+017F>e in the external parts; al which things are of no <U+017F>mal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the cure of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>One among<U+017F>t us affirmeth, that among other things he pre<U+017F>cribed this remedy to a Child of two years old who was troubled with the <hi>Rachites,</hi> and was al<U+017F>o fallen into a continual and malignant Feaver, and grown al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t frantick. Hereupon the Child found pre<U+017F>ent and manife<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>, and after a few days was delivered from his
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:169706:162"/>
Feaver. Afterwards having purged him twice or thrice with an infu<U+017F>ion of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> &amp;c. Beyond the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that <U+017F>aw it, he al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ubdued this <hi>Affect</hi> almo<U+017F>t without any other remedies. But as you can <U+017F>carce find any commodity without a di<U+017F>commodity: <U+017F>o neither is this remedy exempted from al inconveniences. For it is unplea<U+017F>ing, ful of pain and mole<U+017F>tation to Children: Moreover, for a time it interrupteth their exerci<U+017F>e and pa<U+017F>time, in re<U+017F>pect of which things, unle<U+017F>s perhaps <U+017F>om other complicated <hi>affect</hi> do point at an interdiction of exerci<U+017F>e, it may do much more prejudice than advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Again, the force of it <U+017F>uddenly wa<U+017F>teth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by degrees is con<U+017F>umed, which doth not in all re<U+017F>pects keep touch with a Chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Finally, an I<U+017F><U+017F>u which is proper to Chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, may very wel <U+017F>upply its place in this <hi>affect.</hi> Wherfore we <U+017F>carce admit the application of bli<U+017F>ters in the cure of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>om acute Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F> be complicated, which may require this kind of Remedy, as it fals out in the Cau<U+017F>e propounded.</p>
            <p>Now wher this admini<U+017F>tration is requi<U+017F>it, it is mo<U+017F>t commodiou<U+017F>ly performed upon the turning Joynts of the Neck, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>om I<U+017F><U+017F>u have prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed the place; in which ca<U+017F>e you mu<U+017F>t admini<U+017F>ter them either behind the Ears, or four Fingers below the I<U+017F><U+017F>u. We deny not but it may be fitted to <U+017F>everal other places in re<U+017F>pect of the complication of other Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es. But we here de<U+017F>ign the place which a peculiar reference to the pre<U+017F>ent Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Ligatures al<U+017F>o may be referred to this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and indeed we grant, that <U+017F>omtimes they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unu<U+017F>eful in this <hi>affect;</hi> namly, if they be very moderate, and adhibited by ju<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tances, and unto convenient places; but you mu<U+017F>t beware that they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the growth of that part, wherunto they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed;

which is don if they be <U+017F>ufficiently loo<U+017F>e, and made of <U+017F>oft wool, if in the Day time, or for <U+017F>om part of the Day they are tyed up, and unbound at night, if they be fitted to the Thighs and Legs upon the Knee, and to the Arms upon the Elbow.</p>
            <p>Yet Ligatures do here <U+017F>eem to conduce much to the <U+017F>toppage of the Blood from flowing to the Head, and that it ought to be fa<U+017F>tned to the outward parts that are extenuated: be<U+017F>ides, this Remedy is good to retard the over <U+017F>lippery return of the Blood in tho<U+017F>e parts, unto which the Ligature is applyed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Hitherto al<U+017F>o belong the <hi>Fa<U+017F>ciation</hi> or <U+017F>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of certain parts, for this hath an affinity with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures.

But you mu<U+017F>t be careful that the over<U+017F>traightne<U+017F>s of them hinder not their growth.</p>

            <p>It is divided into remedies <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External,</hi> and each of them into <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Compound.</hi> Again the Internal may be <U+017F>ubdivided into <U+017F>uch <hi>as clen<U+017F> the fir<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>agss,</hi> as <hi>Medicines Preparatory.</hi> Into <hi>Electively e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuant,</hi> and <U+017F>uch as are <hi>Specifically alterant</hi> and <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuant,</hi> and finally into tho<U+017F>e that <hi>correct the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</hi>

In which ca<U+017F>es they may not only be injected before any preparation, but al<U+017F>o before a Vomit, yea or a Lenitive Purgation. The<U+017F>e are frequently compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of benign and gentle Purgers, <U+017F>omtimes al<U+017F>o of <U+017F>uch as have only a faculty to make the waies <U+017F>lippery, and to expel wind, but never of Cathartical ingredients that are violent they are to be injected warm or lukewarm, and after a long ab<U+017F>tinence from meat.

               <head>The u<U+017F>e of vomiting remedies, and <U+017F>ome examples of them.</head>
               <p>Emedical Remedies or Vomits, do chiefly perform three things. Fir<U+017F>t they evacuate crude or corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and all manner of impurities contained in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and that by a <U+017F>horter and more expedite way, than if they were conveyed through the involutions and labyrinths of the Guts. Secondly, By an agitation and commotion rai<U+017F>ed in all the parts, e<U+017F>pecially the Bowels, they loo<U+017F>en the gro<U+017F>s and vi<U+017F>cous humors adhering unto them, or impacted in them, and frequently expel them, e<U+017F>pecially tho<U+017F>e which are collected in the Stomach and Guts; in which re<U+017F>pect they are profitable again<U+017F>t tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Chollick and very conducible to unlock Ob<U+017F>tructions. Thirdly, They mo<U+017F>t effectually irritate the expul<U+017F>ive faculty of all the parts of the Body, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pecially of the Bowels, and by this means many times upon a <U+017F>ingle application they compel forth the hidden and unappearing cau<U+017F>es and fomentations of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, and e<U+017F>pecially of intermitting Feavers. For by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <U+017F>training to vomit, the Guts are al<U+017F>o in<U+017F>timulated to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:169706:166"/>
ca<U+017F>t out by <U+017F>iege. The Liver powreth away the Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler by the Biliary Pore; the <U+017F>weet-Bread voideth his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar excrement by the new Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el into the Guts; the Spleen al<U+017F>o perhaps unburdens in a plentiful manner his excrement into the Stomach by Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els not yet through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known: The Kidneys exern through the <hi>Ureters,</hi> the Lungs by a <U+017F>trong Cough eject their Flegm through the Windpipe: The Brain emptieth it <U+017F>elf of <U+017F>alt, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri<U+017F>h Rhewms, and matter by the Palate, the No<U+017F>trils and the Eyes. Finally the whol Body for the mo<U+017F>t part is rendred more prone to a <hi>Diaphore<U+017F>is</hi> either by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t <U+017F>weating, or el<U+017F>e by an occult and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Tran<U+017F>piration. In the mean time it mu<U+017F>t be noted that not all gentle Vomits, nor indeed the more vehement, if they be given in too <U+017F>mal a do<U+017F>e wil pre<U+017F>ently and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform all the<U+017F>e things, yet in their operations they effect more or le<U+017F>s according to the <U+017F>trength or quantity of the Medicine, and indeed if the <U+017F>tronger be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tred in a full do<U+017F>e they effectually attain to the three marks propounded.</p>
               <p>It is obvious, by what hath been <U+017F>aid, to the con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any Reader, that <U+017F>trong Vomits pre<U+017F>cribed in a full quantity are not competible to Children affected with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, neither can their tender <U+017F>trength o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome and <U+017F>ubdue <U+017F>o great tumults in the Body, and <U+017F>uch an Univer<U+017F>al evacuation <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly wrought, Wherfore this kind of remedy ought not to be pre<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Children without diligent precaution and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>pection, and both the <U+017F>trength, quantity, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Medicine are duly to be prepondred. To this end therfore we <U+017F>hall <U+017F>et down <U+017F>ome Cautious in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of unexperienced Practicers.</p>
               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, A Vomit is not to be provoked in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, unle<U+017F>s the humors tend upwards of their own accord, but
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:169706:167"/>
then indeed they may be expelled by vomiting remedies without difficulty.</p>
               <p>Seeondly, Not unle<U+017F>s Children are naturally or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomarily apt to vomit, and do ea<U+017F>ily endure it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In Bloud-<U+017F>pitting, the Pti<U+017F>ick and Con<U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, in any flowing of Bloud at the No<U+017F>e, or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal opening of the Veins, and the like ca<U+017F>es, ab<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence mu<U+017F>t he enjoyned from this remedy.</p>

               <p>It is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary therfore that the Vomits here pre<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, be either in their own nature gentle, or corrected if they be vehement and admini<U+017F>tred in a le<U+017F><U+017F>ened do<U+017F>e.</p>

               <p>To this we an<U+017F>wer, Indeed where Nature contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth little or no a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, it cannot be denied; but in <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es we totally prohibit the admini<U+017F>tration of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting remedies; but pre<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing both a fitne<U+017F>s of the Body and Humors to this evacuation (as is required in the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd Caution) even gentle vomits may expel <U+017F>uch humors as are <U+017F>eated in the fir<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages.

            <head>CHAP. XXXI. Remedies Preparatory, and their <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g><U+017F>e.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He<U+017F>e Remedies partly relate to the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Humors, partly to the waies tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which they are to be expelled, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages them<U+017F>elvs, wherin they are contained. Now it mu<U+017F>t be known, That the Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which is perfected by Vomits, doth lea<U+017F>t of any pre-requir any preparation; but that which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<U+017F>hed by <hi>Catharticks</hi> or Medicins Purging, doth mo<U+017F>t of all exact it.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, The Humors in general to be prepared are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flegmatick, namly cold, which mu<U+017F>t be qualified and tempered with hot, thick, and mu<U+017F>t be attenuated; vi<U+017F>cous, and mu<U+017F>t be cut and opened; or Cholerick, namly <U+017F>harp, bitter, burning, corro<U+017F>ive, which are to be mitigated with lenifying and a<U+017F>waging Medicins; or Melancholly, namly earthy, feculent, tartarous, which by a benignity of application mu<U+017F>t be rendred fluxible; or la<U+017F>tly <U+017F>erous and wateri<U+017F>h, which mu<U+017F>t be di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed and as it were manuducted either to the Urinary pa<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as by pi<U+017F><U+017F>ing, or to the Belly as by <U+017F>iege, or to the parts near the Skin that they may with the more facility evaporate by Sweating.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The waies, thorow which the Evacuation mu<U+017F>t be effected, ought al<U+017F>o to be made fit and prepared,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:169706:169"/>
and not only the common, but al<U+017F>o the <U+017F>pecial, by which the <hi>peccant</hi> matter in particular is conveyed to tho<U+017F>e common Channels. For there is one preparation of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Kidnies (which is chiefly expedited by Medicins of a <U+017F>lippery and loo<U+017F>ning faculty) another of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Liver, which is don by opening, clen<U+017F>ing, and <U+017F>omewhat a<U+017F>tringent Medicaments: A third of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Lungs, which is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wrought by Lenient and Maturant Remedies, <U+017F>omtimes perhaps according to the nature of the matter Medicins incident or atenuant being admini<U+017F>tred, or on the contrary, Admini<U+017F>trations making thick, and <U+017F>uch as have a vertue to arre<U+017F>t and avert the flux.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Tho<U+017F>e parts wherein the vicious humors principally flow or are lodged, require the admixture of Medicaments peculiarly apropriated unto them. And as this or that part is more or le<U+017F>s affected, <U+017F>omtimes choice mu<U+017F>t be made of <hi>Cephalicals,</hi> <U+017F>omtimes <hi>Hepati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals,</hi> and <U+017F>omtimes <hi>Pectoral</hi> Preparations.</p>
            <p>Moreover, (that we may comprehend together mo<U+017F>t if not all of the qualities of Preparatory Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies required in this Affect) we <U+017F>ay, That the<U+017F>e Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies pre<U+017F>cribed by Art ought to be moderatly hot (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s there be a Feaver pre<U+017F>ent) al<U+017F>o attenuant, incident and opening; in like manner, that by a peculiar right they mu<U+017F>t have re<U+017F>pect to the Liver, the Lungs and the Head, which parts for the mo<U+017F>t part are commonly in this Affect oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with a plenitude of humors: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, That there are <U+017F>ome things <U+017F>pecifically apropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Affect<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and if <U+017F>uch things are not in Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s which are rege<U+017F>tred in the number of things prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, and dedicated to the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, than at lea<U+017F>t other <U+017F>pecificals ought to be mingled with the Preparatory Medicines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:169706:170"/>
The<U+017F>e things being premi<U+017F>ed, we judged it expedient to <U+017F>et down <U+017F>uch Simple and Compound Medicines as are u<U+017F>ually <U+017F>old in the Shops, and al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome examples of decompounded Preparatory Remedies.

Moreover, In regard that the<U+017F>e remedies with their heat and drine<U+017F>s obtain withal a manife<U+017F>t friability and thinne<U+017F>s of parts, it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that they cut through all vi<U+017F>cous matter, they attenuate all gro<U+017F>s and thick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and procure a certain equality of all the juyces that have their circulation in the Sanguinary Ma<U+017F>s, and an even di<U+017F>tribution (con<U+017F>ideration being had of the di<U+017F>tance from the fountain of heat) both of heat and Blood.

their heat and drine<U+017F>s being conjoyned with a notable friability and thinne<U+017F>s of the parts they contribute very much to the equal di<U+017F>tribution of the Blood, as al<U+017F>o to <U+017F>ubdue many other parts of the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.

            <head>CHAP. XXXIV. Remedies that correct the Symptoms.</head>
            <p>SOme Symptoms <U+017F>upervening upon this Affect, do <U+017F>omtimes anticipate the legitamat Method of Cure, and require a particular manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Of this <U+017F>ort are the flux of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lask, wherwith <U+017F>omwhat of a Lientery is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently joyned; profu<U+017F>e Sweats, laborious and painful breeding Teeth, and the Toothach.</p>
            <p>The flux of the Belly doth very much follow this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; which if it per<U+017F>evere for any long time, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very violent, and ea<U+017F>ily watereth the Spirits, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umeth the <U+017F>olid parts, manife<U+017F>tly puts on the nature of a cau<U+017F>, and as a cau<U+017F> indicates its own correction. A Bloody-flux rarely hapneth with this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. But a Lask with exulcerations in the Guts, or complicated with a Lientery is very u<U+017F>eful. For in re<U+017F>pect of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the parts <U+017F>ub<U+017F>ervient to dige<U+017F>tion, a <hi>Lask,</hi> or a <hi>Lyentery</hi> may ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>upervene, but not a <hi>Bloudy-flux.</hi> Yet there is a frequent concurrence of other cau<U+017F>es; as of the indige<U+017F>ted nouri<U+017F>hment vicious either in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or quality; <U+017F>om feaver, watchings, worms, painful breeding Teeth, &amp;c. al which things do likewi<U+017F>e ea<U+017F>ily occa<U+017F>ion a <hi>Lask,</hi> or <hi>Lyentery</hi> rather than a <hi>Bloudy-flux.</hi> As for the Cure, it is partly perfected by Purgations, partly by a<U+017F>tringent Remedies; partly by <U+017F>uch as open, and partly by <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>trengthen the parts.</p>

The<U+017F>e Purgers are mo<U+017F>t proper which leave behind an evident binding after evacuation; as <hi>Rhubarb, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Tamarinds, Myrobalans,</hi> &amp;c. out of which for the mo<U+017F>t part we frame a <hi>Bolus</hi> or Potions, becau<U+017F> they are mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>wallowed under tho<U+017F>e forms.

If the Child be troubled with a violent flux, you may give it <U+017F>om binding Con<U+017F>erves, imagin Con<U+017F>erve of Sloes, and mix it with <U+017F>uch things as the Child delights to eat, but in <U+017F>o doing be <U+017F>ure you plea<U+017F> its Palat.</p>
            <p>Somtimes a profu<U+017F>e and exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive <U+017F>weating find a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s for the Phy<U+017F>itian in this affect: for it very much wa<U+017F>ts the Spirits and retards the cure of the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>.</p>
            <p>Yet caution mu<U+017F>t be u<U+017F>ed not to re<U+017F>train it ra<U+017F>hly, if perhaps there be a Feaver, or if any feaveri<U+017F>h fit, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderat heat hath gon before: For in the<U+017F>e ca<U+017F>es it may be upon a critical time, or at lea<U+017F>t it may bring more advantage to the Body by the mitigation of the Feaver, than damage by the lo<U+017F>s of the Spirits. For we know not whether any thing doth more potently or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more <U+017F>weetly expel the feaveri<U+017F>h heat tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g> <U+017F>weating.</p>
            <p>In the interim when it floweth inordinately and cau<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>ly, it argueth that the Body is oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with ob<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, with crude juyces and unprofitable <U+017F>uperfluities, which whil<U+017F>t Nature <U+017F>triveth to ma<U+017F>ter, and to <U+017F>ubdu, by that very labor, (the openne<U+017F>s of the pores withal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring) it is evaporated by <U+017F>weat, and indeed an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable one, very laborious and <U+017F>uch as wa<U+017F>teth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which therfore as <U+017F>oon as po<U+017F><U+017F>ible mu<U+017F>t be corrected This <hi>Hippocrates</hi> meant, where he advi<U+017F>eth, <hi>That that <U+017F>weat which floweth away without cau<U+017F>e, requireth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> For what can more commodiou<U+017F>ly dimini<U+017F>h and di<U+017F><U+017F>ipate the<U+017F>e <U+017F>uperfluities? Again, this motion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <U+017F>weating, wherfore it meriteth the preheminence among the remedies oppo<U+017F>ed to this Sympton, and <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it clears the way for Medicines aperient, and <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>trengthen the skin, and move forward conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, (which perfect the la<U+017F>t part of the cure) it ought in al right to be premi<U+017F>ed before them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:169706:180"/>
Purgative Medicines hitherto belonging, are tho<U+017F>e that are ob<U+017F>erved to be friendly, and agreable to Nature, and withal <U+017F>uch as open ob<U+017F>tructions, and <U+017F>trengthen the Bowels: al which things whither any Simple can perform <U+017F>o wel as Rubarb, we very much doubt. Yet al tho<U+017F>e Simpl and Compound Medicaments propo<U+017F>ed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in the Chapter of Remedies Electively evacuant, may, according to the Condition of the Patient, and the Prudence of the Phy<U+017F>itian, be tran<U+017F>planted hither. Som very much commend Beer in this ca<U+017F>e medicated with Rubarb.</p>
            <p>Take Rubarb cut into any <U+017F>mal peeces, two Drams; Rai<U+017F>ins <U+017F>toned and <U+017F>lit, one ounce; <U+017F>mal Bear, two pound; put them into a Gla<U+017F>s or <U+017F>tone flagon <U+017F>topt with the be<U+017F>t Cork; <U+017F>et it in a very cold place, and <U+017F>tir it very often, but before you u<U+017F>e it let it <U+017F>ettle again, a whol day, then draw out the liquor for your ordinary drink. When the flagon is empty fil it again with beer but put not in a new quantity of Rhubarb.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The mo<U+017F>t noble Aperients which both help concoction, and repre<U+017F>s unprofitable <U+017F>weating, are <hi>French Wine,</hi> and <hi>Rhenni<U+017F>h Wine.</hi> But if there be any fear of their heat in this tender age, they may be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ro<U+017F>ted Apples, Borage, or red Ro<U+017F>e-water, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a little Sugar and grated Nutmeg, let them be al<U+017F>o taken in a le<U+017F><U+017F>er quantity and only at meals.</p>
            <p>They are likewi<U+017F>e the mo<U+017F>t effectual Aperients, which do not only help concoction, but al<U+017F>o <U+017F>trengthen the <hi>Tone</hi> of al the parts, e<U+017F>pecially of the Bowels. Among which we chiefly commend things made with <U+017F>teel, as wine made with <U+017F>teel, and the Electuary before named, and the like. Now although <U+017F>teel doth indeed effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform tho<U+017F>e things which we have <U+017F>aid; yet becau<U+017F>e it doth not in all re<U+017F>pects an<U+017F>wer to <U+017F>om other <U+017F>copes of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:169706:181"/>
great moment in this affect, but doth more hurt <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in one particular, than it doth good in another; we thought it expedient to <U+017F>ubjoyn the<U+017F>e following Cautions concerning the u<U+017F>e therof.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, Seing that Steel is an enemy to the Lungs, and doth ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>tir a cruel flux of flegmatick matter in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Bodies, therfore you mu<U+017F>t totally ab<U+017F>tain from the u<U+017F>e therof, where there is any Cathar, Cough, ob<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lungs, and much more, if there be any Inflamation, Pleuri<U+017F>ie, Blood-<U+017F>pitting, or a prone<U+017F>s of di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition to any of the<U+017F>e affects.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becau<U+017F> Steel contributes little or nothing to the operation of the Blood: but on the contrary (however it may attenuat the tough and flegmatick part thereof) doth rather expedit the <U+017F>eparation therof from the other ma<U+017F>s of Blood by rea<U+017F>on of the tart quality that is predominent in it, it cannot be admitted but with circum<U+017F>pection, e<U+017F>pecially that inequality of the Blood being <U+017F>o importunat and urgent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Seing that the attenuating, cutting and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening faculty in Steel is conjoyned with an apparent and extream drine<U+017F>s and binding, and therfore perhaps doth more compact tho<U+017F>e humors, than di<U+017F><U+017F>olve and <U+017F>catter them; the u<U+017F>e therof ought to be refrained, at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected in any con<U+017F>iderable <hi>Alogotrophy</hi> of the parts. For the fear is le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould bind too clo<U+017F>e and con<U+017F>olidate the <U+017F>hort parts of the Bones &amp; tho<U+017F>e that are too <U+017F>cantily nouri<U+017F>hed; wherby afterwards they may becom le<U+017F>s prompt and apt to grow in length: but the parts <U+017F>ticking out (as al<U+017F>o the convex <U+017F>ides of the Bones) which are liberally nouri<U+017F>hed it cannot di<U+017F><U+017F>olve, and then there may be a jealou<U+017F>ie that it will too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them and make them <U+017F>tubborn; namly by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream thickning and hardning of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:169706:181"/>
Fourthly, In all acute Feavers the u<U+017F>e of Steel is hurtful, becau<U+017F>e it over-dryeth and bindeth the Parts, yea, for that very regard that it re<U+017F>traineth Sweating, and makes the humors more fierce and <U+017F>harp.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e Cautions being rightly ob<U+017F>erved, we admit the u<U+017F>e of Steel in this Affect, but becau<U+017F> Mountebanks and Quacks cannot di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h between the u<U+017F>e and the abu<U+017F>e, we would not per<U+017F>wade any to make tryal of this noble Medicine without the advi<U+017F>e and coun<U+017F>el of <U+017F>ome prudent and knowing Phy<U+017F>itian, becau<U+017F> if it be not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>pectly admini<U+017F>tred, the danger is very great. Some other Aperients of le<U+017F>s note may <U+017F>erve this <U+017F>cope; as the Roots of Succhory or Borrage, or Con<U+017F>erve of their Flowers; the Roots of Gra<U+017F>s, Sparagus, Fernbrake, Madder; the Leaves of Ceterach, Spleenwort, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denhair, &amp;c.

            <p>The painful breeding and the aching of the Teeth are the familiar Symptoms of the Rachites; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F> they breed Feavers, unquietne<U+017F>s, watchings, and other evils, they al<U+017F>o de<U+017F>erve a peculiar mitigation; if the Tooth therfore as it is working through the Gum puts the Child to very much pain, you mu<U+017F>t without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay (unle<U+017F>s it were done before) appoint <U+017F>ome univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al evacuation: as a Vomit, which is thought to be a potent remedy again<U+017F>t the Toothach. Now that may be moved by the only tickling of the Throat, putting
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:169706:182"/>
in a Feather, or the Nur<U+017F>es Finger into the Childs mouth; or el<U+017F>e with rubbing the Tooth that is breaking forth with a Tobacco Leaf wrapped about the Nur<U+017F>es Finger, and a little moi<U+017F>tned with Beer; or la<U+017F>tly, by giving <U+017F>ome vomiting draught above de<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. But this remedy is forbidden reiteration in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it too much may weaken the Stomach. The day following (the pain per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting or returning) <U+017F>ome Cathartick Potion or Bolus among tho<U+017F>e above reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed, or like unto tho<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be admini<U+017F>tred. After this univer<U+017F>al Evacuation you mu<U+017F>t de<U+017F>cend to Topical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midies. Nur<U+017F>es are wont to rub the Gums with Corral poli<U+017F>hed for that purpo<U+017F>e. But the Phy<U+017F>itians do rather commend the Root of Mar<U+017F>h Mallows, which do mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and loo<U+017F>en the Gums that they may obtain the more ea<U+017F>ie pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. Others report it for a great <U+017F>ecret to rub the aching Tooth with the Root of the <U+017F>harpe<U+017F>t Sorrel. Others very much commend the rubbing of that Gum where the Tooth is coming out with a Cocks Comb newley cut off, or with the hot Blood di<U+017F>tilling from that Wound. We have had no experience of tho<U+017F>e things which they u<U+017F>e to in<U+017F>till into the Ears; in like manner, neither the Plai<U+017F>ters of Ma<U+017F>tich, Olibanum, or red Lead, which in tho<U+017F>e of full growth are ob<U+017F>erved to <U+017F>top the Rhewm. Others apply <U+017F>mall Epi<U+017F>pa<U+017F>tick Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters behind the Ears, which perhaps compel back the matter that breeds the pain in the Teeth. But neither do we interpo<U+017F>e our judgment concerning the<U+017F>e things. Only when Univer<U+017F>als are unavailable, we have recour<U+017F> to Hypnotical Remedies, which indeed by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication profit little, but being taken inwards they are very helpful, e<U+017F>pecially being rightly prepared and duly corrected. Therfore when want of re<U+017F>t and watchings beget mole<U+017F>tation, thus we proceed.</p>
            <p>

               <head>The Manner, <hi>or</hi> Kinds of Exerci<U+017F>e.</head>
               <p>All kinds of Exerci<U+017F>e, unto which Children are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomed, may be u<U+017F>eful in their time and <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on. But becau<U+017F> Children who are mole<U+017F>ted with the <hi>Rachites</hi> are <U+017F>omwhat aver<U+017F> from motion and by rea<U+017F>on of their weakne<U+017F>s of Spirit, and unaccu<U+017F>tomedne<U+017F>s of Exerci<U+017F>e do <U+017F>carce after the beginning of the cure, or indeed not at all endure violent motions; therfore they mu<U+017F>t begin perpetually with gentle Exerci<U+017F>es, and afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by degrees to <U+017F>tronger; in like manner at fir<U+017F>t they mu<U+017F>t continue but a <U+017F>hort time, but afterwards a longer <U+017F>pace without any intermi<U+017F><U+017F>ion.</p>
               <p>We therfore di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h Exerci<U+017F>es into gentle, and vehement or Ma<U+017F>culine. The gentle we refer fir<U+017F>t to the manner of lying down. Secondly, To the agitation of the Body in the Cradle. Thirdly, To the carrying them about in the Nur<U+017F>es Arms. Fourthly, To <U+017F>eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary pa<U+017F>times.</p>
               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, Lying upon the Back among all the po<U+017F>tures of the Body doth chiefly recede from Exerci<U+017F>e, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t only allowable in the extream weakne<U+017F>s of the Spirits, as in accute Feavers when the Spirits are <U+017F>pent, likewi<U+017F>e in many ca<U+017F>es of the Che<U+017F>t and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal parts, as frequently in an inflamation of the Liver, Spleen, Lungues, in a Pleuri<U+017F>ie, in the growing of the Lungues with the Pleura, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>thume, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:169706:183"/>
The lying upon one <U+017F>ide either right or left cometh neere<U+017F>t to the Supine Po<U+017F>ition, and participates very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Nature of Exerci<U+017F>e. Wherfore it is al<U+017F>o allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wable in any great weakne<U+017F>s of the Spirits, at lea<U+017F>t in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of altering the po<U+017F>ture of the Body, as al<U+017F>o when a profound <U+017F>leep is not expected. Moreover, it is <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what profitable to <U+017F>trong Bodies in the time of the fir<U+017F>t or <U+017F>econd <U+017F>leep, after ju<U+017F>t internals <U+017F>till changing <U+017F>ides. But afterwards perhaps it is not <U+017F>o agreable unto, nor beneficial for them, e<U+017F>pecially when the Body is fully refre<U+017F>hed with <U+017F>leep. For then that po<U+017F>ture is be<U+017F>t which draweth neere<U+017F>t to the Nature of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>The Simple Lateral Po<U+017F>ition containeth <U+017F>omwhat more of Exerci<U+017F>e, and is inconvenient for weak Bodies and <U+017F>uch as are not u<U+017F>ed to it in the time of profound <U+017F>leep: but otherwi<U+017F>e it may be made familiar, if for a while they will accu<U+017F>tom them<U+017F>elvs unto it. It is at all times good for <U+017F>trong Bodies, provided that a due care be had to alter and vary it.</p>
               <p>The lying on one <U+017F>ide towards the Belly is laborious and trouble<U+017F>om, and not to be continued long by <U+017F>trong and robu<U+017F>tious Bodies that are not u<U+017F>ed to it. But the mole<U+017F>tation being overcome by cu<U+017F>tom, it is more ea<U+017F>ily tolerated: and becau<U+017F> it ea<U+017F>eth the pains in the Head, helpeth the Concoction of the Stomach, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigateth the pains of the Chollick, and loo<U+017F>neth a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tive Body, it may be <U+017F>omtimes u<U+017F>eful when Nature is throughly <U+017F>atisfied with <U+017F>leep, and in this affect it may <U+017F>upply the place of Exerci<U+017F>e. For it <U+017F>omtimes hapneth in this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, that Children for <U+017F>ome time are not without di<U+017F>advantage tru<U+017F>ted to their own Feet, yea many times they gain more by re<U+017F>t than walking up and down. For walking rather confirmeth than cureth the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:169706:184"/>
bended Joynts; but lying down, when the parts are well <U+017F>wathed, conduceth not a little to their erection. Then again, lying down helpeth very much to <U+017F>tretch and lengthen the <U+017F>hort parts, as may be perceived by the growth of the parts in length after a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Lying down, in regard of the common Coverings of the whol Body, advanceth an equal di<U+017F>per<U+017F>ion of the heat through all the parts. La<U+017F>tly, lying down, if you ob<U+017F>erve a right way of placing and making the Bed, may contribute very much to correct the crookning of the Back-bone and the whol Body, for when they lie upon the gibbous and bunched Side, a little bag made for the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e may be laid under the parts <U+017F>ticking out, and <U+017F>o made fit that the gibbous parts may in a manner <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the weight of the whol Body, and <U+017F>o they may be compelled as it were to <U+017F>traightne<U+017F>s. But when Children roul to the other <U+017F>ide, the bed <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o made, that if the little Pillow or Bay be taken away the hollow part <U+017F>hould <U+017F>carce touch the bed unle<U+017F>s he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him<U+017F>elf to a <U+017F>traight line, that by his weight it may be depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed to a <U+017F>traightne<U+017F>s.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That kind of exerci<U+017F>e which is performed <hi>by the rocking of the Cradle <U+017F>omwhat emulates this lying down.</hi> The Cradles are <U+017F>u<U+017F>tained upon two Arches, or two parts of a Circle: now the more they have of a Circle, the more effectually they exerci<U+017F>e the Infant. This motion in time of <U+017F>leep mu<U+017F>t be intermitted, or at lea<U+017F>t remitted; but whil<U+017F>t the Child waketh it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>omtimes intended, and <U+017F>omtimes remitted. It is mo<U+017F>t profitable for weak Infants that can <U+017F>carce <U+017F>tand upon their Feet, or are otherwi<U+017F>e hindred from waking.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The bearing them about in the Nur<U+017F>es Arms is almo<U+017F>t agreable to the <U+017F>ame Children; and under the <U+017F>ame conditions:</hi> in like manner the rejoycing
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:169706:184"/>
of the Child whil<U+017F>t the Nur<U+017F> <U+017F>ingeth, either as it <U+017F>its in her Lap, or is held up in her Hands, as al<U+017F>o the to<U+017F><U+017F>ing of it up and down, and waving of it to and fro, and if the Child be <U+017F>trong by holding it gently up by the Hands, if it be weak, under the Arms, yet <U+017F>o that the Thighs and the whol Body may hang down. Al<U+017F>o the drawing of the Children backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon a Bed or a Table between two Nur<U+017F>es, the one holding it by a Hand, the other by a Foot. The two la<U+017F>t motions <U+017F>eem to contribute <U+017F>omwhat to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the crooked or bended Back-bone, e<U+017F>pecially if the Hand which is laid upon the depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed Shoulder, and the Foot which is belonging to the elevated Hip be drawn with more <U+017F>trength and vehemence than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand or foot. To the <U+017F>ame end al<U+017F>o tendeth the lifting up of the Child, taking him by his Feet only, <U+017F>o that the trunk of his Body and his Head may for a time hang down in an inverted po<U+017F>ture; although indeed this action may al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eem in <U+017F>ome manner to relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the growing to of the Liver, if any <U+017F>uch at that time be: as al<U+017F>o that convolution of the Body, whereby the Head being lowermo<U+017F>t the Feet are lifted up; and then again the Head being lifted up the whol Body is inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Hitherto al<U+017F>o may be referred that rouling of the Child, which <U+017F>om u<U+017F>e, upon a Bed or Table, the Body being laterally declined: which we more approve if it be not rouled quite round about, but only backwards and forwards, laying a little hard Cu<U+017F>hion underneath, wheron the gibbous part may re<U+017F>t, &amp; <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the weight of the Body. This exerci<U+017F>e being rightly practi<U+017F>ed doth help much to <U+017F>traighten the Body.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Sedentery Games and pa<U+017F>times</hi> are the lea<U+017F>t profitable among all exerci<U+017F>es for Children that have the <hi>Rachites,</hi> and indeed they are only allowable to <U+017F>till
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:169706:185"/>
and quiet them. But the more beneficial wil be to tempt them to a frequent u<U+017F>e of their Feet by playing <U+017F>ome little Ball or Cat before them that they may be often kicking them. But if the Body of the Child be croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ports mu<U+017F>t be invented as may allure him to move his Body to the contrary <U+017F>ide. When therfore one Shoulder is higher than another hold up <U+017F>om Gewgaw or Rattle before the Child that he may <U+017F>tretch out the Hand belonging to the lowe<U+017F>t Shoulder to reach after the offered object. But a thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>uch like inventions may be found out, and we leave them to the Nur<U+017F>es in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<U+017F>try.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ma<U+017F>culine Exerci<U+017F>es of greater note</hi> we reduce to the<U+017F>e three Titles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1 To</hi> Going. <hi>2 To</hi> an Artificial hanging of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>3 To</hi> Friction, rubbing, and contrectation of the Hypocondries and the Abdomen.</p>
               <p>Fir<U+017F>t, <hi>O<U+017F>tentation</hi> or <hi>waking</hi> may be numbred among<U+017F>t the more noble Exerci<U+017F>es. For Children that are big and <U+017F>trong, and u<U+017F>ed to run up and down every day, do by walking and <U+017F>tirring about, the more ea<U+017F>ily rid away this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>. But this kind of Exerci<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be refu<U+017F>ed unto them who<U+017F>e Joynts are not knit and confirmed, and who<U+017F>e Ankles, Knees &amp; Back are <U+017F>o weak that they cannot <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain the Body. For when Children by the negligence of their Nur<U+017F>es are too <U+017F>oon committed to their Feet, it ea<U+017F>ily coms to pa<U+017F>s, that they <U+017F>uffer tho<U+017F>e Joynts to be bended either inwards or outwards, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or forwards, and con<U+017F>equently they are the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of that deformity which befalleth the Bodies of mo<U+017F>t men and women. Moreover, tho<U+017F>e Children which have already contracted <U+017F>uch a bending in their joynts, either by the natural weakne<U+017F>s and loo<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the Ligaments, or by the bad u<U+017F>age or indiligence of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:169706:185"/>
their Nur<U+017F>es, mu<U+017F>t be tru<U+017F>ted to exerci<U+017F>e their Legs, till <U+017F>ome <U+017F>plents or other in<U+017F>truments be provided, which may be able to erect the bended Joynts and to keep them in an erected po<U+017F>ture. The driving of Children up and down in their Coaches or Chariots is much to the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e, provided that they be <U+017F>o contrived that there be no danger of <U+017F>tumbling or overthrowing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The artificial <U+017F>u<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ion of the Body is performed by the help of an In<U+017F>trument cunningly made with <U+017F>wathing Bands, fir<U+017F>t cro<U+017F><U+017F>ing the Brea<U+017F>t and coming under the Armpits, then about the Head and under the Chin, and then receiving the hands by two handles, <U+017F>o that it is a plea<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>ee the Child hanging pendulous in the Air, and moved to and fro by the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators. This kind of Exerci<U+017F>e is thought to be many waies conducible in this Affect, for it helpeth to re<U+017F>tore the crooked Bones, to erect the bended Joynts, and to lengthen the <U+017F>hort Stature of the Body. Moreover, it exciteth the vital Heat, and withal allureth a plentiful di<U+017F>tribution of the Nouri<U+017F>hment to the external and fir<U+017F>t affected parts: and in the mean time it is rather a plea<U+017F>ure than a trouble to the Child. Some that the parts may the more be <U+017F>tretched, hang Leaden Shoos upon the Feet, and fa<U+017F>ten weights to the Body, that the parts may the more ea<U+017F>ily be extended to an equal length. But this exerci<U+017F>e is only proper for tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>trong.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Friction or rubbing may in <U+017F>ome manner be likewi<U+017F>e referred to Ma<U+017F>culine Exerci<U+017F>es: nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in re<U+017F>pect of any active motion in the Child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>ite to the admini<U+017F>tration therof (for it is performed by an action of the Nur<U+017F> rather than of the Child) but in re<U+017F>pect of a like force and efficacy which it hath in the curing of this Affect. Now Friction <U+017F>eemeth to be

twofold, as partly belonging to the kind of Exerci<U+017F>e, and partly to tho<U+017F>e things which are outwardly to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, for which cau<U+017F> we have re<U+017F>erved it unto this place, that it might be the la<U+017F>t in the number of the Exerci<U+017F>es, and immediately precede the external applications. This mu<U+017F>t be done (at lea<U+017F>t in the Winter time) by a warm fire, the Child being in all re<U+017F>pects well fortified from the injuries of the weather, and the violences of the cold Ayr. Some Nur<U+017F>es admini<U+017F>ter this Friction with a hot hand, others with Linnen Cloathes dried and heated; others with woolen Cloathes; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again with a little Bru<U+017F>h, and indeed <U+017F>ome do mo<U+017F>t commend the Bru<U+017F>h, and prefer it before the other waies, but becau<U+017F> there <U+017F>eemeth to be <U+017F>o little difference in all the waies, we approve them all, and leave the choice to the Nur<U+017F>es wi<U+017F>dom. But let them begin this Friction at the Back Bone, the Child being laid upon his Belly, and let them <U+017F>tir their Hands now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, now downwards, now on each <U+017F>ide, then to the Thighs, Hips, Legs, Ankles, the Soals of the Feet, and all the parts of the Body, tho<U+017F>e excepted where there is a <U+017F>ticking out of the Bones, and there let them rub the hollow part of them. This action mu<U+017F>t not be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued beyond a moderate ruddine<U+017F>s rai<U+017F>ed in the parts, le<U+017F>t the Natural heat <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>cattred, rather than che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>hed. This kind of exerci<U+017F>e is mo<U+017F>t agreable to weak Children; and <U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>carce able to <U+017F>tand or go. For it <U+017F>upplieth the defect of running up and down, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth the Natural heat, <U+017F>ummoneth the Vital, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth the Nouri<U+017F>hment to the affected parts. Yet we grant that Friction doth not <U+017F>o powerfully <U+017F>ummon the heat and nouri<U+017F>hment to the Fle<U+017F>h of the Mu<U+017F>cles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps it doth more to the Skin, as exerci<U+017F>e doth properly <U+017F>o called, and con<U+017F>equently that it mu<U+017F>t
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:169706:186"/>
yield in dignity and nature to true exerci<U+017F>es. To Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction al<U+017F>o belongeth that contrectation of the Belly, or of the Abdomen and the Hypochondries, <U+017F>omtimes lifting up the Bowels, <U+017F>omtimes depre<U+017F><U+017F>ing them, <U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times removing them towards the right, <U+017F>omtimes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left hand, and <U+017F>omtimes thru<U+017F>ting in the tops of the Fingers under the Ba<U+017F>tard Ribs. And Phy<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hope, and not without rea<U+017F>on, that by this action they may deliver the Liver from any preternatural gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing with the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> if any <U+017F>uch <U+017F>hould chance to be. And here we note by the way that <U+017F>uch growing of that Bowel may ea<U+017F>ily happen in this affect by rea<U+017F>on of the greatne<U+017F>s of the Liver and the <U+017F>tretching of the Hypochondriacal parts, wherupon the Peritoneum and the Membrane of the Liver are are mo<U+017F>t neerly and <U+017F>trictly conjoyned, and being conjoyned may remain long in the <U+017F>ame Po<U+017F>ition, and <U+017F>o by the help of time they may ea<U+017F>ily grow together. This growing together in as much as it dependeth (as we have <U+017F>aid) upon the <U+017F>tretching of the Hypochondries, and the bigne<U+017F>s of the Liver, it may not incongruou<U+017F>ly be referred to the <U+017F>econdary E<U+017F><U+017F>ence of this Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>, namely, to the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical parts viciated, among which it de<U+017F>erves to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, although above we chanced to omit it in its proper place, and therfore we thought good to mention it here. Thus much of Exerci<U+017F>es, now follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Applications.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He<U+017F>e remedies (as we have <U+017F>aid) do not only prerequire Friction, but for the mo<U+017F>t part they are admini<U+017F>tred with a gentle Friction.</p>
            <p>Now they are either General, or Univer<U+017F>al, re<U+017F>pecting all parts alike, or Particular, and dedicated to certain Regions of the Body. The matter of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>als is almo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame with that which we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded above in the Chapterof <hi>Specifical Alterant Remedies:</hi> but the matter of the particulars mu<U+017F>t be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed according to the variety of the Regions of the Body unto which they are applied. The forms of either kind <U+017F>eem to be common, and they are five in number, Liquors, Oyls, Liniments, Oyntments, Play<U+017F>ters: although Plai<U+017F>ters are dedicated rather to certain parts, and never are at once applied to the whol Body.</p>
            <p>Liquors that have been commended by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this Affect are almo<U+017F>t all kinds of Wine; but e<U+017F>pecially Muskadine. But <U+017F>ome do prefer the Prui<U+017F>ian Beer, which indeed may help much to <U+017F>trengthen and con<U+017F>olidate the Parts, but very little or nothing at all to effect the equation of the Blood, or an equal di<U+017F>tributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. The <U+017F>ame judgment is al<U+017F>o to be made of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligant, as al<U+017F>o of red Wine. Some in<U+017F>tead of Wine u<U+017F>e ordinary <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> which is beleeved to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

            <p>Take the Roots of Royal O<U+017F>mond, the Leaves of Sage, the Flowers of Marigolds, the Leaves of Bay-tree, Pauls Betony, Hart<U+017F>tongue, of each half an handful; Ro<U+017F>emary, red Ro<U+017F>es dried, of each one pugil; boyl them in Fountain Water, and ordinary Aqua vitae, of each a pound, to the con<U+017F>umption of the third part; <U+017F>train it and keep for your u<U+017F>e. <hi>Or</hi>

            <p>Take the roots of the male Fernbrake one ounce, the leaves of royal O<U+017F>mond, Clary, Bay tree, Sage, Pauls Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, of each half a handful, infu<U+017F>e them in <U+017F>ome Wine, and keep the <U+017F>trained liquor for your u<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>But the<U+017F>e Liquors are <U+017F>eldom or never admini<U+017F>tred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but mu<U+017F>t be mixt with equal parts of <hi>Oyls, Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> or <hi>Ointments;</hi> and indeed they mu<U+017F>t be u<U+017F>ed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a warm fire, and rubbed on with a hot hand til they be dry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Compound Oyls</hi> <U+017F>uch as are approved in this Affect are very few, and tho<U+017F>e ineffectual: but there are many <hi>Simple Oyls,</hi> as Oyl of Earth-worms, Chamamile, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rygold flowers, Pauls Betony, Neats-foot Oyl, unto which you may al<U+017F>o ad Oyl of Foxes, Oyl of Whelps, Oyl of Swallows, provided that the<U+017F>e la<U+017F>t be prepared Simply by them<U+017F>elves without any commixture of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hot ingredients.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Take the leaves of Brooklime, Chamomile, Watercre<U+017F><U+017F>es, garden Scurvygra<U+017F>s, Pauls Betony, Motherwort, Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair, Hart<U+017F>tongue, Ceterach, Bayleavs, the tops of Mint, red Sage, Ro<U+017F>emary, Ivy-berries, of each half a handful: the Roots of royal O<U+017F>mund four ounces, Mu<U+017F>cadale half a pound, May Butuer three pound: cut the Leaves, brui<U+017F> the Berries, and boil them all to the con<U+017F>umption of the Wine, <U+017F>train it whil<U+017F>t it is hot, and <U+017F>eparating the pure <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance from the <U+017F>etlings, make an Ointment according to art. <hi>Or,</hi>

            <p>To the<U+017F>e general external Remedies <U+017F>om particular ones relating to <U+017F>om certain parts of the Body may be <U+017F>ub-joyned: as if the region of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> e<U+017F>pecially the Hypocondria, be <U+017F>tretched, hard and <U+017F>welled, and this <U+017F>tretching hardne<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>welling would not yeild to a Purgation though rightly admini<U+017F>tred, then you mu<U+017F>t proceed to Local Remedies: As,</p>
