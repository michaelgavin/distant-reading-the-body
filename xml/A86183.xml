         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Â¶</p>
               <p>Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, therefore, have their origine, not from one fountain, particularly from the Head (from whence the <note place="margin">3.</note> Schools wildly imagine all <hi>Catarrhs</hi> to drop down) but from a <U+017F>ingle <hi>Idiopathy,</hi> or proper indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of every part, <U+017F>uperinduced upon the <hi>topicall</hi> or dome<U+017F>tick <hi>Ferments.</hi> Thus, to example, <hi>Wounds,</hi> long after their <U+017F>anation, break <note place="margin">4.</note> forth again, and frequently introduce durable <hi>

Thus <hi>Coughs, Pleuri<U+017F>ies, Spittings of blood,</hi> and <hi>Eri<U+017F>ypelous tumors,</hi> or inflammations, have their <U+017F>et vici<U+017F><U+017F>itudes, and, after con<U+017F>iderable intermi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions, reinvade.

For this is proper to the Lungs, in this re<U+017F>pect, that they continually <U+017F>uck in crude Aer, and being neer to the heart oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed, lavi<U+017F>hly expend their own <U+017F>trength, and by rea<U+017F>on of that exhau<U+017F>tion, decay much the <U+017F>ooner.

               <p>In the fir<U+017F>t place I di<U+017F><U+017F>ent from the Schools, becau<U+017F>e I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well know this kind of vitio<U+017F>ity in nature to belong to <note place="margin">7.</note> the parts <hi>containing,</hi> and not to the humors <hi>contained.</hi> For excrementitious humors of this kind contained, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain productions, which are begotten by the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall pre<U+017F>ident of the particular parts, depraved by <U+017F>ome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious inquination precedent.</p>
               <p>In the <U+017F>econd, I di<U+017F><U+017F>ent from them al<U+017F>o in this point, <note place="margin">8.</note> that I <U+017F>tand a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that this evill is <hi>topicall</hi> and <hi>primary,</hi> and not communicated by <hi>Deuteropathy</hi> or <hi>con<U+017F>ent</hi> with the head. For the Coughs of old men, which for the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity di<U+017F>courage all hopes of re<U+017F>tauration, ari<U+017F>e from this root; that in the lowe<U+017F>t and <U+017F>malle<U+017F>t branches of the <hi>Re<U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Artery,</hi> or pipe of the Lungs, there doth con<U+017F>tantly re<U+017F>ide <U+017F>uch a quantity of excrement, generated in the Lungs, which doth not onely ob<U+017F>truct the tubes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duicts: but al<U+017F>o, by the contagion of its pre<U+017F>ence, deprave and dimini<U+017F>h the <hi>Local Ferment;</hi> whereupon there is hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced a new <U+017F>ource or <U+017F>upply of excrements, as the

plentifull maintainance of Coughs, which in men once entered the calamitous confines of old age, are hardly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by remedies known to vulgar heads: in regard <U+017F>uch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies neither <hi>arrive</hi> at the <hi>part affected,</hi> nor, in troth, are they endowed with any <hi>re<U+017F>tauratory faculty.</hi> The<U+017F>e kinds of excrementitious humors, therefore, are no other but <hi>topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call defects</hi> of the parts mi<U+017F>affected: and every particular part hath its particular debility, whether innate or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ite, from a diminution of its <hi>vegetative Ferment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it is evident, that the various <U+017F>treams of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">9.</note> flowing from the various parts of the body, are all derived from this one fountain. Â¶</p>
               <p>On the<U+017F>e firm grounds I apprehend, fir<U+017F>t, <hi>That all repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Purgations, in the<U+017F>e affections, are fru<U+017F>traneous and hurtfull:</hi> in re<U+017F>pect, they levell their power onely again<U+017F>t the productions, or <hi>Effects,</hi> and not again<U+017F>t the <hi>Cau<U+017F>es;</hi> and chiefly becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch vi<U+017F>cid excrements, <U+017F>eated remotely from the <U+017F>tomack, are too <U+017F>tubborn and refractory to yield to the laxative operation of <hi>Purgers.</hi> You may pleas to adde, that although <hi>Laxatives</hi> may <U+017F>eem to have afforded ea<U+017F>e and relief, for a day or two after their u<U+017F>e; in<U+017F>omuch as the ma<U+017F><U+017F>e of crude and inconfected blood in the mezara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick veins being voided by <U+017F>tool, there mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the more <U+017F>paring di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ation of blood through the body, and penury of nouri<U+017F>hment in the Lungs, and by con<U+017F>equence a le<U+017F><U+017F>e quantity of excrement be rejected: yet do they, by <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tracting from the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary aliment of the whole, and by leaving behind them an evill tincture in the in<U+017F>truments of common dige<U+017F>tion, every day more and more infringe the univer<U+017F>all oeconomy of the body, and impugne the con<U+017F>erving vigour of nature.</p>
