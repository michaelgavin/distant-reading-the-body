         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE ri<U+017F>e of the following Tract,
intimated near the beginning
of it, was not <U+017F>uch a fictitious thing
as the Reader may imagine. But <hi>tho'</hi>
I really receiv'd a Vi<U+017F>it from a Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
known to me, but by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
purpo<U+017F>ely to propo<U+017F>e to me
his Objections again<U+017F>t the Corpu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Phylo<U+017F>ophy, and he had a long
conference with me about them; <hi>yet,</hi>
becau<U+017F>e the Hi<U+017F>torical pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of that
interview, cannot be circum<U+017F>tanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
related in few words, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e
the Reader will willingly allow me,
to imploy this Preface in giving him
Adverti<U+017F>ements about the <U+017F>cope and
de<U+017F>ign of the Treati<U+017F>e it u<U+017F>hers in.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>hall therefore adverti<U+017F>e him,
that he will be much mi<U+017F>taken, if he
<U+017F>hall expect, as I perceive <U+017F>everal
have done already, to find in this
Book a Collection of Receits of Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
<pb facs="tcp:49353:3"/>
Remedies. For a moderate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Title Page will enable
him manife<U+017F>tly to di<U+017F>cern, that the
following Paper in its own nature,
and in the direct and immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign
of it, is a Speculative di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e;
<U+017F>ince it tends but to <U+017F>how, that, in
ca<U+017F>e there be Specifick Medicines (as
'tis probable there are <U+017F>ome) their
experienced vertues are reconcilcable
to the principles of the Corpu<U+017F>cular,
or (as many call it) the new Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophy;
and at lea<U+017F>t do not <U+017F>ubvert
them; if the<U+017F>e Effects and Operations
be not clearly explicable by them.
And as this is the, avowed <U+017F>cope of
the following E<U+017F><U+017F>ay, <U+017F>o I cho<U+017F>e to
treat of it le<U+017F>s like a Phy<U+017F>ician than a
Naturali<U+017F>t. For Phy<U+017F>icks being a
Science, who<U+017F>e large extent invites
and warrants its Cultivaters, to <U+017F>earch
into the nature and <hi>Phaenomina</hi> of
things corporeal indefinitely; it mu<U+017F>t
often happen, that the Medicinal Art
and this Science will be conver<U+017F>ant
about the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ubject, tho' in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ways, and with differing <U+017F>copes.
<pb facs="tcp:49353:3"/>
For there are divers hurtful or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
accidents and changes of the
humane Body, whereof the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>t
takes notice, but as they are
Phaenomina or changes produc'd by
Natural cau<U+017F>es in the Body of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
whil<U+017F>t the Phy<U+017F>ician con<U+017F>iders
them as Symptoms of Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, or
Effects of Medicines, the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
his Speculations to the di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of truth, and the other his Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the recovery of health. But
becau<U+017F>e I el<U+017F>e where particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ider
the Cognation and di<U+017F>tinction,
between the Di<U+017F>cipline that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali<U+017F>t,
and that which the Phy<U+017F>ici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
cultivates, I <U+017F>hall for bear to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
them in this place; but rather
acknowledge, that I <U+017F>carce doubt but
that I might have inrich'd the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <U+017F>ome choice parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
if I would have perus'd and
borrow'd from the learned writings
of the famous Dr. <hi>Willis:</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides
that I had not his Books at hand,
I was unwilling to be prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd or
bya<U+017F>s'd by his notions, and I pre<U+017F>um'd
<pb facs="tcp:49353:4"/>
the Per<U+017F>on I wrote to would not be
unwilling to <U+017F>ee, what, without
their help, the con<U+017F>ideration of the
thing I treated of <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ted to me.
About this I <U+017F>hall now proceed to
ob<U+017F>erve, that <hi>tho'</hi> the direct <U+017F>cope
of the following di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, being to
explicate the Phaenomena of <U+017F>ome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which from their u<U+017F>e, are call'd
Medicinal, and declare how po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly
they may produce the Effects a<U+017F>crib'd
to them, the en<U+017F>uing di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e is for
the main of a Speculative nature;
<hi>yet</hi> the con<U+017F>equences that may be
drawn from it, and the applications
that in this indu<U+017F>trious Age are like
to be made of <U+017F>ome things that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
may probably render it practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
For I have more than once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd,
that divers con<U+017F>iderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and <U+017F>ome not unpromising
methods too, have either remain'd
unthought of, both by many Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Phy<U+017F>icians, and divers of their
modern Antagoni<U+017F>ts too, or if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by others, have been rejected
or <U+017F>lighted, barely upon this <U+017F>uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition,
<pb facs="tcp:49353:4"/>
that no rational account can
be given of their way of working, or
how they <U+017F>hould do good, and 'tis
<U+017F>aid to be unworthy of a rational
Phy<U+017F>ician; to make u<U+017F>e of a Remedy,
of who<U+017F>e manner of operating he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give a rea<U+017F>on. How prejudicial
it may be to many Patients, that
Phy<U+017F>icians be prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd with a bad
opinion of an u<U+017F>eful Remedy, may be
gue<U+017F>s'd by him that <U+017F>hall con<U+017F>ider,
what multitudes of Teeming Women,
that probably might have been <U+017F>av'd
by the skilful u<U+017F>e of Phlebotomy, have
been <U+017F>uffer'd to dye for want of it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a di<U+017F>like of that Remedy that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians
for many Ages thought to be
grounded upon no le<U+017F>s authority than
a po<U+017F>itive Aphori<U+017F>m of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
And therefore if, to remove the <U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
objection newly mention'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
that whole kind of Remedies
call'd Specificks, the following Tract
has been <U+017F>o happy as to <U+017F>how, that
'tis at lea<U+017F>t po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that Medicines
<U+017F>aid to be <hi>Specifick,</hi> may perform
their operations by ways, which tho'
<pb facs="tcp:49353:5"/>
not explicable by the vulgar Doctrine
of the Schools, are intelligible, and
reconcileable, to the clear Principles
of the Mechanical Phylo<U+017F>ophy: If, I
<U+017F>ay, this have been done by the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
propos'd in this Treati<U+017F>e, it may
conduce <U+017F>omewhat to inlarge the
minds of many Phy<U+017F>icians, and invite
them to make u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>everal Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
of which they did not think,
or again<U+017F>t which they were preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd.
And <U+017F>ince Specificks, where
they can be had, are wont to be free
from any immoderate manife<U+017F>t qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and for the mo<U+017F>t part to work
more benignly, as well as more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
<hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> than other
Medicines; I think that to bring them
into due reque<U+017F>t, and invite Phy<U+017F>ici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to <U+017F>earch for new ones, as well as
imploy tho<U+017F>e already known, may
tend much to <U+017F>horten many Cures,
and make them more ea<U+017F>y and more
<U+017F>afe.</p>

For the<U+017F>e Qualities do not only,

I find three <U+017F>orts of Qualities men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in the Books of phy<U+017F>icians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of <hi>Specifick Vertues.</hi>
For by <hi><U+017F>ome</hi> a Medicine is <U+017F>aid to have
a Specifick Faculty, becau<U+017F>e it is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
and peculiarly friendly to this
or that particular Part of the Body, as
the Heart, the Brain, the Eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By
others it is <U+017F>aid, by a Specifick Power,
to attract and evacuate <U+017F>ome deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Humour, as Choler, Phlegm,
<hi>&amp;c</hi> But the mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>ual account, upon
which a Medicine is <U+017F>aid to be <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,</hi>
is that it has the vertue to cure,
by <U+017F>ome hidden property, this or
that particular di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, as a Pleuri<U+017F>y,
an <hi>A<U+017F>thma,</hi> the colick, the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>y,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this being the principal
and mo<U+017F>t common <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, in which the
word <hi>Specifick</hi> is employ'd by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians,
I <U+017F>hall ordinarily make u<U+017F>e of
it, in that <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, in the following di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,

<U+017F>hall require.</p>
               <p>But before I de<U+017F>cend to particular
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49353:10"/>
con<U+017F>idertions 'twill not be ami<U+017F>s to

<U+017F>en<U+017F>e in this Paper, I <U+017F>hall employ
the Term <hi>Specifick Medicine,</hi> e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the la<U+017F>t of the three foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd

               <p>I do not then by a <hi>Specifick</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand
a Medicine, that will cure the
di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e it is good for Infallibly, and in
all Per<U+017F>ons that take it, for I confe<U+017F>s
I never yet met with any <U+017F>uch reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Nor do I by <hi>Specifick</hi> under<U+017F>tand
a Medicine that, almo<U+017F>t like a <hi>Charm,</hi>
works only by <U+017F>ome latent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable

a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of any known Quality, as
Purgative, Diuretick, Sudorific, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to be found in other Medicines:
But by <hi>Specifick</hi> I mean, in this di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,
<U+017F>uch a medicine as very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, 
if not mo<U+017F>t commonly, does very
con<U+017F>iderably, and better than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Medicines, relieve the Patient,
whether by quite curing, or much

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49353:11"/>
if it have any manife<U+017F>t Quality that is
friendly, yet the good it does is
greater, than can rea<U+017F>onably be a<U+017F>crib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the degree it has of that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>t
Quality, as hot, cold, bitter, <U+017F>udo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two grand Que<U+017F>tions,
that may be propos'd about the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
vertues a<U+017F>crib'd to Medicines,
The fir<U+017F>t is, whether there be really
any <U+017F>uch, and the <U+017F>econd whether,
if there be, the Mechanical <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<U+017F>is</hi>
can be accommodated to
them.</p>
               <p>The former of the<U+017F>e Que<U+017F>tions
may admit of a double <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, for
it may be propos'd with re<U+017F>pect,
either to the pre<U+017F>ent mea<U+017F>ure of our
knowledge, or to tho<U+017F>e further attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that, in future times, men may
arrive at.</p>
               <p>In the latter of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>en<U+017F>es, (to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
fir<U+017F>t the con<U+017F>ideration of that)
I <U+017F>hall not pre<U+017F>ume to maintain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
re<U+017F>triction, either part of the
Que<U+017F>tion. For I do not only hope,
but am apt to think, that in time
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49353:11"/>
the Indu<U+017F>try and Sagacity of men
will be able to di<U+017F>cover Intelligible
cau<U+017F>es of mo<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e Qualities, that
now pa<U+017F>s for <hi>Occult,</hi> and among them
of many of the Specifick vertues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>crib'd
to Medicines. And yet, on the
other <U+017F>ide, I much fear that men will
not be <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful, in tracing out the
true and immediate cau<U+017F>es of tho<U+017F>e
good effects of <U+017F>ome remedies, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon <U+017F>uch fine and uncommon
Textures, and <U+017F>uch latent and odly
guided Motions, as fall not under
our Sen<U+017F>es, thÃ´ perhaps a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted
by In<U+017F>truments. Which conjecture
will appear the le<U+017F>s improbable, if we
con<U+017F>ider tho<U+017F>e admirable <hi>Idio<U+017F>yncra<U+017F>iae,</hi>
or Peculiarities of Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Books of eminent Writers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us many in<U+017F>tances, to who<U+017F>e num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I could, upon my own Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
add <U+017F>everal, if I thought it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
And, thÃ´ I am not ignorant that
<U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e may be plau<U+017F>ibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for, as that of <U+017F>ome mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<U+017F>ion
to chee<U+017F>e, or to cats; yet I
do not think that the like expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49353:12"/>
can be extended to <U+017F>ome
others, that might be nam'd, if it
were here pertinent to di<U+017F>cu<U+017F>s that
throughly.</p>
               <p>As to the former <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, of the
Que<U+017F>tion lately propounded, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s
my <U+017F>elf very amiable to the
Affirmative, as far as I can judge by
tho<U+017F>e writings of Phy<U+017F>icians I have
had occa<U+017F>ion to peru<U+017F>e. Which limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
I add, becau<U+017F>e I would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
from the knowledge of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
per<U+017F>ons, who in <U+017F>o learned and
inqui<U+017F>itive an Age, may be arriv'd at
far greater attainments than tho<U+017F>e
Phy<U+017F>icians have done, that have
entertain'd the Publick about the
Occult and Specifick Qualities of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
               <p>I know there have been, and <U+017F>till
are, Dogmatical Phy<U+017F>itians, that upon
the Principles, as they pretend, of the
School-Philo<U+017F>ophy, reject all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal
vertues that they think not
reducible to manife<U+017F>t Qualities. But
of <U+017F>uch <hi>Galen</hi> <U+017F>omewhere ju<U+017F>tly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
that they either deny matters
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49353:12"/>
of fact, or a<U+017F><U+017F>ign very incompetent
cau<U+017F>es o the effects they pretend to
explain. And, for my part, I am <U+017F>o far
from believing the<U+017F>e men capable of
giving <U+017F>ufficient rea<U+017F>ons of the more
hidden Properties of Medicins, that
I am not apt to think them able, by
their Principles, to give clear and
particular explications, even of the
more ea<U+017F>y and familiar vertues of <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>I am therefore di<U+017F>pos'd to think
that, in the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e formerly deliver'd of
the Term <hi>Specifick Medicines,</hi> there are
<U+017F>ome Remedies that de<U+017F>erve that
name.</p>
               <p>To this opinion I have been led by
<U+017F>everal Rea<U+017F>ons<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> And fir<U+017F>t (to begin
with the lea<U+017F>t weighty) it has the <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of many learned Phy<U+017F>icians,
both Ancient and Modern, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
that of <hi>Galen</hi> him<U+017F>elf in <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places of his Works. And I
remember that, treating of a Specifick
Remedy again<U+017F>t the biting of a mad
Dog, which vertue he a<U+017F>cribes to an
occult Quality, or, as he <U+017F>peaks, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49353:13"/>
the Propriety of the
whole Sub<U+017F>tance;<note place="margin">Galen. <hi>de Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl. Medicam. Fac.</hi> Lib. 11.</note> he
takes occa<U+017F>ion to promi<U+017F>e,
that he would write a Book of things
that operate upon that account.
Which Book, if it had <U+017F>cap'd with his
other Works (for he el<U+017F>ewhere cites
it as having written it) would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
have furni<U+017F>h'd us with <U+017F>everal
things to <U+017F>trengthen our opinion.
And thÃ´ in Matters Philo<U+017F>ophical I
am little <U+017F>way'd by mere Authority,
yet the concurrent <U+017F>uffrage, of many
eminent Phy<U+017F>icians, may in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover<U+017F>y
be the more con<U+017F>iderable,
becau<U+017F>e mo<U+017F>t of them, being noted
Practitioners, had opportunity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
whether or no any Remedies
de<U+017F>erv'd the name of Specificks: And
their Te<U+017F>timony is, in our ca<U+017F>e, the
more to be regarded, becau<U+017F>e Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
e<U+017F>pecially famous ones, are not
wont to be willing to acknowledge,
that there are Effects, which fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cogni<U+017F>ance of their art, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they cannot give the cau<U+017F>es.</p>
               <p>My next Inducement, to admit
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49353:13"/>
Specificks, is founded upon Parity of
Rea<U+017F>on: For 'tis manife<U+017F>t, that there
are divere formidable Maladies, that
are produc'd by incon<U+017F>iderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Poy<U+017F>ons, that have not been
di<U+017F>cover'd to produce <U+017F>uch great and
di<U+017F>mal Effects by any Manife<U+017F>t Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whether fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>econd, or third, as
Medical Authors (I doubt not over
accurately) di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h them.</p>
               <p>On this occa<U+017F>ion I <U+017F>hall add a very
odd Accident, about which I was
advis'd with by an expert oculi<U+017F>t, very
<U+017F>oon after it happen'd: The Ca<U+017F>e was
this. A man lying <U+017F>omewhat long
in Bed in the morning, and chancing,
as he lay upon his Back, to ca<U+017F>t up
his Eyes to the Te<U+017F>ter, <U+017F>aw a great
Spider, that <U+017F>tood <U+017F>till ju<U+017F>t over his
Face: Wherefore having reproach'd
his Wife, who happen'd to be in the
Room, with gro<U+017F>s negligence, <U+017F>he
took a Broom, and <U+017F>truck it upon the
upper part of the Te<U+017F>ter, to beat
down the Spider; but the Animal
held <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t with his Feet that <U+017F>he
mi<U+017F>s'd her aim, and he, whether frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49353:14"/>
or irritated by this rude <U+017F>hake,
let fall upon the Man, that was <U+017F>tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at it to <U+017F>ee what would happen, a
drop of Liquor that lighted directly
upon one of his open Eyes. But
finding no heat nor <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ue,
but rather a very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
he made nothing of it, but
ro<U+017F>e and put on his cloth's. But
pre<U+017F>ently after, happening to rub with
his finger the other Eye, he was <U+017F>adly
<U+017F>urpriz'd to find him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>uddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted,
and calling for a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, he
found that the Eye, which the Spider
had let fall <U+017F>omething on, thÃ´ no
change were noted in it by the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanders,
was totally depriv'd of <U+017F>ight.
Upon which <U+017F>core he repair'd to the
above mention'd Oculi<U+017F>ts: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he afterwards recover'd his <U+017F>ight
or no, I cannot tell; all the endeavours
the Oculi<U+017F>t arid I imploy'd to find out
his Lodging (to which it <U+017F>eems he had
left a wrong direction) having been
Fruitle<U+017F>s. This brought into my
mind, that I had <U+017F>ometimes wonder'd
to <U+017F>ee how much more quickly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49353:14"/>
will kill Flyes, than the cutting
off their Heads, or running them quite
through with Pins or Needles will do.</p>
               <p>But to return to what I was <U+017F>aying,
of the great Mi<U+017F>chief done to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Bodies, by very <U+017F>mall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Poy<U+017F>on; methinks one may
thence argue that it <U+017F>eems not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that Appropriated Medicines,
e<U+017F>pecially when admini<U+017F>tred in
greater quantity, may produce very
notable changes in the Humane Body
to the advantage of it. But on this
occa<U+017F>ion I expect to be told, that 'tis
much more ea<U+017F>y to do harm,
than good, and I confe<U+017F>s 'tis <U+017F>o
in the general, but yet, in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ca<U+017F>e before us, I con<U+017F>ider that
<U+017F>ome Poy<U+017F>ons, that produce <U+017F>uch
dreadful Symptoms in the Body, are
frequently cur'd by their appropriated
Antidotes, which therefore mu<U+017F>t have
a Sanative Power great enough, with
the help but of the ordinary Concour<U+017F>e
of Nature, to <U+017F>urmount the efficacy
of the venemous Matter. To which
I <U+017F>hall add this more familiar in<U+017F>tance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49353:15"/>
that <hi>as</hi> Perfumes do often enough
produce various, and <U+017F>ometimes
frightful, Symptoms in many Hi<U+017F>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Women; <hi><U+017F>o</hi> the fumes of the
burnt Feathers of Patridges, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> do frequently cure the
Fit in as little time as the <U+017F>weet
<U+017F>mell procur'd it. And I have often
found the <U+017F>mell of <U+017F>trong Spirit of
Harts-horn, or Sal-Armoniac, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<U+017F>uch Women in far le<U+017F>s time, than
the fragrant odours imploy'd to make
them <U+017F>i<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>The Third and Principal Inducement
I had, to think there are Specifick
Remedies, is from Experience. I
might urge, on this occa<U+017F>ion, the Te<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Galen,</hi> who tells us more
than once, that he him<U+017F>elf therefore
confided, in the A<U+017F>hes of burnt Craw-Fi<U+017F>hes,
for the cure of the biting of a
Mad Dog, becau<U+017F>e never any of tho<U+017F>e
that took it dy'd. And to annex
that upon the by, for the u<U+017F>efulne<U+017F>s
of it, he adds, that thÃ´
the effect of the<U+017F>e a<U+017F>hes
be admirable,<note place="margin">Galen. <hi>de <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl. Med. Fac. lib.</hi> 11.</note> even when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49353:15"/>
given alone, yet their vertue may
be increa<U+017F>ed, by adding to ten parts
of burnt Craw Fi<U+017F>hes five of <hi>Gentian</hi>
and one of Frank-incen<U+017F>e. And the
great vertue of the<U+017F>e burnt Shell-fi<U+017F>hes
I find to have been taken notice of
<U+017F>ome ages before <hi>Galen; Dio<U+017F>corides</hi>
much commending them again<U+017F>t the
<U+017F>ame Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e that the <hi>Pergamenian</hi>
does.</p>
               <p>I <U+017F>hall in this place purpo<U+017F>ely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to mention <U+017F>uch Medicines, as,
thÃ´ by divers learned Phy<U+017F>icians
commended as Specificks, are yet by
others much que<U+017F>tion'd, if not flatly
deny'd to be <U+017F>o. Since it may be
more proper, and may perhaps <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
to mention two or three, who<U+017F>e
efficacy is more notorious.</p>
               <p>'Tis known, by almo<U+017F>t daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
in <hi>Italy</hi> and divers other hot
Countreys, that thÃ´ the <U+017F>tings of
Scorpions oftentimes produce very
acute Pains, and formidable Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
yet the Mi<U+017F>chief is ea<U+017F>ily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy'd,
either by pre<U+017F>ently cru<U+017F>hing
the Body of the Scorpion upon the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49353:16"/>
Hurt, or by anointing the part
affected with Oyl of Scorpions, (for
that rea<U+017F>on to be almo<U+017F>t every where
found,) which being made by <U+017F>uffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
tho<U+017F>e In<U+017F>ects in common Oyl,
and keeping it long in the Sun, the
Liquor does not at all appear to have
any manife<U+017F>t Quality, to which
its <U+017F>anative Efficacy may be a<U+017F>crib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The Bitings of tho<U+017F>e Serpents,
which for the noi<U+017F>e they are wont to
make, with a kind of empty Bladders
in their Tails, the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> call Rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>nakes,
are counted much more poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onous
and dangerous than the <U+017F>tings
of Scorpions. Of which I remember
a learned Eye witne<U+017F>s, that liv'd
divers years in <hi>Virginia,</hi> where they
much abound, related to me a very
<U+017F>trange In<U+017F>tance, which I cannot now
<U+017F>tay to <U+017F>et down. And yet the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>h</hi>
Planters, when they have the mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to be bitten by the<U+017F>e Serpents,
are wont to cure them<U+017F>elves very
happily by the u<U+017F>e of that plant, which
from its effects, and the place it grows
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49353:16"/>
in, is well known by the name of
<hi>Virginian Snakeweed,</hi> [<hi>or Serpentaria
Virginiana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Peruvian Bark,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call'd here in <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uits
Powder,</hi> is a Specifick again<U+017F>t
Agues, particularly Quartans, divers
learned Phy<U+017F>icians not only grant but
a<U+017F><U+017F>ert. And I remember the ju<U+017F>tly
famous Dt. <hi>Willis</hi> gave me this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of it in private di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, (not
without taking notice that <U+017F>ome
decry'd it,) <hi>'Tis the noble<U+017F>t Medicine we</hi>
(meaning the <hi>Phy<U+017F>icians</hi>) <hi>know.</hi> But
thÃ´ I will not di<U+017F>pute, whether it be <U+017F>o
certain and <U+017F>afe a Specifick for Agues,
as 'tis believ'd by, divers eminent
Doctors, yet I think it can <U+017F>carce be
deny'd, to be a Specifick Medicine
to <U+017F>top the fits of Agues, (in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Specifick Remedies</hi> formerly
deliver'd) <U+017F>ince it does that far more
effectually, than the generality of
Phy<U+017F>icians, for many ages, were wont
to do, with their other Antifebrile Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
               <p>I might here tell you, that I have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49353:17"/>
my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>een a <U+017F>tone, who<U+017F>e efficacy
in <U+017F>topping Hemorrhagies invited my
Wonder; and another, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
extraordinary things in more
than one Di<U+017F>temper thÃ´ I could not
perceive that either of them did the<U+017F>e
things by any manife<U+017F>t Quality. And
I might here add <U+017F>ome other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
that may be borrow'd from
Experience, in favour of our opinion,
but that 'tis like they will be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
alledg'd hereafter in <U+017F>ome places
of the remaining Part of our Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
               <p>I know tho<U+017F>e, that have rejected
Specifick Medicines, have confidently
urg'd three plau<U+017F>ible Arguments
again<U+017F>t them. For <hi><U+017F>ome</hi> Phy<U+017F>icians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there are any Effects of Medicines
<U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable, as to make them
de<U+017F>erve the name of <hi>Specifick. Others</hi>
would probably allow that Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
favours our opinion, if they did
not think the way of a <hi>Specifick</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
operating mu<U+017F>t be inexplicable,
and con<U+017F>equently ought not be
admitted by Phy<U+017F>icians. And <hi>others</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49353:17"/>
again (being of Sentiments very
differing from the<U+017F>e) will allow them
to be very efficacious, but endeavour
to derive their whole Efficacy from
Manife<U+017F>t Qualities, as heat, cold, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
of Parts, faculty of making large
Evacuations by Vomit, Siege, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the<U+017F>e objections will be more
opportunely con<U+017F>ider'd in due places,
Only there is one Argument, that
may be objected by the deniers of
Specifick remedies, which I confe<U+017F>s
is <U+017F>o <U+017F>pecious, as to de<U+017F>erve to be
particularly examin'd in this place,
le<U+017F>t it <U+017F>hould, if unremov'd, beget too
<U+017F>trong a prejudice again<U+017F>t a great part
of the en<U+017F>uing Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. For it may
be <U+017F>aid, that a Medicine taken in at
the Mouth mu<U+017F>t, in the Stomach and
Guts, be at le<U+017F>t very much chang'd by
Dige<U+017F>tion, and the Aliments it meets
with there, and a good Part of it
will be pro<U+017F>crib'd among excrements.
That alter it has pa<U+017F>s'd out of the
Stomach, it mu<U+017F>t meet with divers
<U+017F>trainers of differing Textures, which
will probably <U+017F>top all or mo<U+017F>t of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49353:18"/>
Medicinal Corpu<U+017F>cles that would
pervade them. And that if any <U+017F>hal
be <U+017F>o lucky, or <U+017F>o penetrating, as to
<U+017F>urmount all the<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>tacles, they will
probably either be a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated unto
the Sub<U+017F>tance of the Body, or quite
chang'd by the parts they will be
fain to combine with there. Or, if
yet any <U+017F>hould be able <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinately
to retain their pri<U+017F>tine Nature, they
will in all likely hood be too few to
have any con<U+017F>iderable operation
upon the Body. But to this plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible
objection I have <U+017F>everal
things to oppo<U+017F>e by way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer.</p>
               <p>1. And fir<U+017F>t I may repre<U+017F>ent, that
divers Specifick Medicines, as <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>ome Oyntments, Plai<U+017F>ters, Poultis's
Amulets, <hi>Pericarpia, &amp;c.</hi> Being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
apply'd, their Corpu<U+017F>cles can
get into the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood without
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through the Stomach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently
are not concern'd in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
objection.</p>
               <p>2. Again<U+017F>t mo<U+017F>t of the <hi>Galenical</hi>
Phy<U+017F>icians, that are wont to urge
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49353:18"/>
the formerly propos'd objection, I
<U+017F>ee not why one may not argue <hi>ad
hominem</hi> by putting them in mind,
that the <U+017F>ame Difficulties for the
main, or others not inferior, may be
alledged again<U+017F>t a common opinion of
their own. For <U+017F>ince they believe
that Purgatives, Cordials, Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
be<U+017F>ides Cephalicks, Hepaticks,
and <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>orts of Medicines, do
contemperate, and <U+017F>weeten the Blood,
and u<U+017F>efully affect the newly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<U+017F>table Parts; and <U+017F>ince the<U+017F>e
Medicines act not by naked Qualities
but by <U+017F>mall Particles, of their own
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, if they can give us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
account of the ingre<U+017F>s of
the<U+017F>e Particles in con<U+017F>iderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
into the Rece<U+017F><U+017F>es of the Body,
without being, di<U+017F>poyl'd of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
virtues, they will at the <U+017F>ame
time in<U+017F>truct us, how to an<U+017F>wer
the objection they urge again<U+017F>t
us.</p>
               <p>3. And in regard the generality of
Phy<U+017F>icians hold, that Milk, and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
were materially in the Ma<U+017F>s
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49353:19"/>
of Blood, and are <U+017F>eparated from it by
the Brea<U+017F>ts, and Kidneys; I think
one may by experience <U+017F>hew she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity
of their ratiocination again<U+017F>t
Specificks. For 'tis obvious to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve,
and I have <U+017F>everal times done it

with <U+017F>o little lo<U+017F>s of its redne<U+017F>s,
that <U+017F>trangers are wont to be <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
and frighted at it, as thinking
this unknown fruit had made them
void bloody Urine, if not blood ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Eye-witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, and among them by a
famous Phy<U+017F>ician. As for Milk, the

that haying occa<U+017F>ion to make <U+017F>ome

That when the Cows, in that Di<U+017F>trict,

he would never eat out of the <U+017F>ame

fits, and perhaps will complain of
<U+017F>uffocation, and be put into convul<U+017F>ive
Motions, by the fragrant Odours of
Musk, or Civet; though if all the
<hi>Effluvia,</hi> that cau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e Symptomes,
were reduc'd into one aggregate, this
would not probably amount to a
hundredth, nor perhaps to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>andth,

part of a grain. And I have
oftentimes <U+017F>peedily <U+017F>uppre<U+017F>s'd <U+017F>uch
fits, by the odour of the volatile Salts
Harts-horn, Sal Armoniac, or the like,
or of de<U+017F>till'd Spirits abounding with
<U+017F>uch Salts; though perhaps all the
Particles, that actually relieved the

Symptoms, if pack'd together,
would not have equal'd, either in
bigne<U+017F>s or in weight, the tenth, not
to <U+017F>ay the fifteenth, or the hundredth,
part of a grain of mu<U+017F>tard-<U+017F>eed. And
as for inward remedies, 'tis vulgarly
known, that in the infu<U+017F>ion of <hi>Crocus
Metallorum,</hi> Corpu<U+017F>cles that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

any thing but <U+017F>mall Beer Whereupon

By which means the patient, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

whereof nature <U+017F>eems to affect the

This I de<U+017F>ire may be here taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of once for all that, retaining the
Scope of the following di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e <U+017F>till

<U+017F>o I ob<U+017F>erv'd <U+017F>oon after the beginning
of this Paper that there were three

<U+017F>ix or <U+017F>even that now occur to
my thoughts. For having fir<U+017F>t given
you this important caution, that the
Specifick Remedy do's not commonly
(though <U+017F>ometimes it may) relieve the
patient by this or that <U+017F>ingle way of
operating, but by a concurrence of two
or more, that as it were joyn their
forces to produce the de<U+017F>ired effect.</p>

                  <p>And fir<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ometimes the Specifick
Medicine may cure by di<U+017F>cu<U+017F><U+017F>ing, or
re<U+017F>olving the morbifick matter, and
thereby making it fit for expul<U+017F>ion by
the greater common <U+017F>hores of the Body,
and the Pores of the skin.</p>
                  <p>'Tis known that many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es,
and tho<U+017F>e oftentimes <U+017F>tubborn and
Chronical, proceed from certain tough
or vi<U+017F>cous Humours, that ob<U+017F>truct
the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages wereby the blood <U+017F>hould
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49353:26"/>
circulate, or other u<U+017F>efull Liquors be
tran<U+017F>mitted. And the<U+017F>e peccant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
are oftentimes <U+017F>o vi<U+017F>cid and
ob<U+017F>tinate, that ordinary Remedies
will do little or no good upon them.
And yet a Specifick may, by the <U+017F>mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,
and congruous Figure of <U+017F>ome of
its Corpu<U+017F>cles, get through the Pores
into the Rece<U+017F><U+017F>es of this <U+017F>tubborn mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and by their <hi><U+017F>olidity, Figure,</hi> and
<hi>Agitation,</hi> promoted by the heat of the
patients Body, may di<U+017F><U+017F>olve and ruine
the texture of the Morbifick matter,
and render it capable of being pro<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by nature, by Urine, Sweat, or <U+017F>ome
other commodious and innocent Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation.
Thus the blood, or <U+017F>ome other
Liquor of the Body, being (to u<U+017F>e the
Chymi<U+017F>ts Phra<U+017F>e) impregnated with
the friendly and operative Particles of
the Remedy, becomes an appropriated
<hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> in referrence to the Pecant
matter: impregnated with Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack
becomes a <hi>Men<U+017F>truum,</hi> that by
degrees will di<U+017F><U+017F>olve both Copper and
Iron, as compact bodies as they are.
I <U+017F>aid <hi>appropriated Men<U+017F>truum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49353:26"/>
there is no <U+017F>ufficient rea<U+017F>on to
<U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, that the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> works
by any manife<U+017F>t quality, as Heat
Moi<U+017F>ture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or even by Acidity
it <U+017F>elf: But rather by virtue of the
fitne<U+017F>s, which the <U+017F>hape, bulk, <U+017F>oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilty,
and other Mechanical affections
of its particles, concur to give it, to
disjoyn the parts of a body of <U+017F>uch a
determinate Texture. For as I have
in another Paper amply <U+017F>hewn, there
are far more <hi>Men<U+017F>truums</hi> of di<U+017F>tinct
<U+017F>orts than are commonly taken notice
of, and the operations of the<U+017F>e can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<U+017F>afely be mea<U+017F>ured by the <U+017F>trength
of their manife<U+017F>t qualities, <U+017F>ince it
may <U+017F>everal times happen, that a
<hi>Men<U+017F>truum,</hi> le<U+017F>s acid or le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trongly
ta<U+017F>ted, may di<U+017F><U+017F>olve this or that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which another <hi>Men<U+017F>truum,</hi> that
<U+017F>eems far <U+017F>tronger, will not work on.
Thus cold water will di<U+017F><U+017F>olve the
white of an Egg, which pure <U+017F>pirit of
wine will be <U+017F>o far from di<U+017F><U+017F>olving,
that it will coagulate it; [and <U+017F>o
will <U+017F>pirit of Salt and Oyl of Vitriol it
<U+017F>elf.] Thus dephlegm'd <U+017F>pirit of Urine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49353:27"/>
will readily di<U+017F><U+017F>olve minute filings of
Copper, which <U+017F>pirit of Vinegar will
but <U+017F>lowly work upon; and yet this
Liquor will <U+017F>peedily di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Crabs
Eyes, which <U+017F>pirit of Urine will leave
entire. Thus Quick<U+017F>ilver, that is
in<U+017F>ipid, will in the cold di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Gold,
which <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> it <U+017F>elf, though a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted

bear a<U+017F>under the parts of
Iron, though Quick<U+017F>ilver will not <U+017F>o
much as adhere to its <U+017F>urface. And
thus in fine (not to accumulate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances)
common Oyl, that is <U+017F>o
<U+017F>mooth upon the Tongue, and
will not di<U+017F><U+017F>olve <U+017F>o much as an

having more than once prepar'd it,
which, though <U+017F>o weak that one may

                  <p>And now, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

with the blood, or other
Vehicle they impregnate, may
act upon the morbifick matters they
meet with in the body, after the
manner of <hi>Men<U+017F>truum;</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing
this I <U+017F>ay, we may hence illu<U+017F>trate
<U+017F>everal things that have reference to
the operation of <U+017F>pecifick Medicines.</p>
                  <p>1. And we may hence derive a
Gue<U+017F>s, why an appropriated Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
will perform things, which will
not be done by another, who<U+017F>e ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife<U+017F>t
qualities <U+017F>eem to be the <U+017F>ame for
kind, and much <U+017F>tronger in degree.
For <hi>Men<U+017F>truums</hi> do not always act
according to the degree of their Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
or the like <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible quality,
but according to the congruity of their
Corpu<U+017F>cles to the pores of the body
they are to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve; and al<U+017F>o often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
according to a fitne<U+017F>s that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon other Mechanical Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49353:28"/>
of the acting Liquor. And
therefore Phy<U+017F>icians, as well as others,
may ea<U+017F>ily mi<U+017F>take in their Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<hi>Ã  majori ad minus, &amp; Ã  mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nori
ad majus.</hi> For the con<U+017F>equence
is not good to argue either thus,
Water, which is <U+017F>o <U+017F>trengthle<U+017F>s Liquor,
will di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Gum Arabic, therefore
highly rectified <U+017F>pirit of Wine, which
is a much more <U+017F>ubtil and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teing
Liquor, will doe the <U+017F>ame thing
more powerfully; for Experience
<U+017F>hews, it will not di<U+017F><U+017F>olve it at all:
or thus, <U+017F>trong Oyl of Vitriol is more
corro<U+017F>ive in ta<U+017F>te, and will di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve
many bodies that <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi>
will not, therefore it will al<U+017F>o di<U+017F><U+017F>olve
Silver as well as <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> the
contrary of which is true. Nay 'tis
not a good inference to argue thus,
<hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> is di<U+017F><U+017F>olves Silver by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of its acid Spirits, therefore the
more it abounds with the<U+017F>e, the more
potently it will di<U+017F><U+017F>olve that Metal,
whereas I have el<U+017F>ewhere prov'd by
Experience, that if <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> be
made exceeding <U+017F>trong, it will not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49353:28"/>
work upon Silver, but it will readily
do it if it be weakned by the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a fit quantity of Common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>To this I <U+017F>hall add, that the di<U+017F><U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of a Body may depend, as well
upon the peculiar texture of the
body it <U+017F>elf, as the manife<U+017F>t <U+017F>trength
of the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2ly. The foregoing Doctrine may
<U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t a Rea<U+017F>on, why a Medicine
that does wonders in one di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, may
do little or nothing in another, that
<U+017F>ome may think to be a kin to it, and
perhaps too, more ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>uperable by
it. For the pre<U+017F>um'd cognation may
not be <U+017F>o great, but that <U+017F>ome di<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of texture in the morbifick
matters, may make one of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to be wrought upon by the <U+017F>ame
<hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> that di<U+017F><U+017F>oloves the other.
And though pure Spirit of Wine will
ea<U+017F>ily enough di<U+017F><U+017F>olve <hi>Gummi Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
and al<U+017F>o the little portion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inous
matter that are harbour'd in
the Pores and <U+017F>mall cavities of the
Wood; yet the <U+017F>ame <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49353:29"/>
not work upon the Wood it <U+017F>elf of the
Tree that affords tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>oluble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances.</p>
                  <p>3. This may keep it from being
thought <U+017F>trange, that Specifick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>ometimes fail of their
u<U+017F>ual Effects. For, <hi>as</hi> the Bodies of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Patients, may differ very
much, either according to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Con<U+017F>titution, or to that which they
acquire by the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e that di<U+017F>tempers
them, or on both tho<U+017F>e accounts; <hi>So</hi>
it ought not to <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange, that in
<U+017F>ome <U+017F>ick Per<U+017F>ons among many, the
congruity between the agent ct pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<U+017F>hould be alter'd, either by <U+017F>ome
con<U+017F>iderable change in the Texture
of the Morbifick matter, or by <U+017F>ome
notable alteration that the Corpu<U+017F>cles
of the Medicine receive in their pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
through the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of <U+017F>ome incongruous Particles
of the Blood or other Vehicle. Thus
Spirit of Salt will, as I have try'd,
di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Copper, as Spirit of Niter
does: which notwith<U+017F>tanding, thÃ´ this
la<U+017F>t nam'd Liquor will di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49353:29"/>
yet if you mix with it Spirit of
Salt, which by the like operation of
both upon Copper, <U+017F>eems to be ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to it, the Spirit of Niter will no
more be able to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Silver, as it
could before.</p>
                  <p>4thly. Our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> may al<U+017F>o
hint to us an an<U+017F>wer to one of the main
and mo<U+017F>t plau<U+017F>ible objections of the
deniers of Specifick Medicines. For
<U+017F>ome of them ask in a Scornful way,
how 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that a Medicine
<U+017F>hould rove up and down in the Ma<U+017F>s
of Blood, and neglecting all other
things, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ingle out, and fa<U+017F>ten
upon the Morbifick matter men wi<U+017F>h
it <U+017F>hould pro<U+017F>cribe. For if the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
acts by impregnating the Blood,
or <U+017F>ome other Liquor of the Body,
and turning it into a kind of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truum,</hi>
'tis very po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, both that
the <U+017F>trainers through which the
Corpu<U+017F>cles mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s, may keep back
the inconvenient parts of the vehicle,
and (which is in our ca<U+017F>e more con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable)
the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> may be either
appropriated to the peccant Humour,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49353:30"/>
as has been formerly declar'd, or el<U+017F>e
may at lea<U+017F>t be qualify'd, to re<U+017F>olve
that more ea<U+017F>ily than any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance
it meets with in the Body. As
if you take <U+017F>ome Bone-a<U+017F>hes, and
<hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> and Saw-du<U+017F>t, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Sea-Salt, and Filings of Gold,
and blend all the<U+017F>e together, if upon
one half of this mixture you pour
common Water, it will not meddle
with any other of the Ingredients ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Sea-Salt, which it will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
di<U+017F><U+017F>olve: &amp; if upon the other half
of the <U+017F>ame mixture, you put a <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
quantity of Quick-<U+017F>ilver, and rub
them together, this Metalline Liquor
will neglect all the re<U+017F>t of the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and the Sea Salt it <U+017F>elf, and fa<U+017F>ten
upon the Gold. And tho<U+017F>e that work
in the Spani<U+017F>h Gold mines inform us,
that when they have well ground
<U+017F>ome Ore, that contains Gold and
Copper, be<U+017F>ides Heterogeneous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
well heated Quick-<U+017F>ilver will
take up the Gold much <U+017F>ooner and
better than it will the Copper, <U+017F>carce
meddling with the latter, as long
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49353:30"/>
as there remains any not de<U+017F>picable
quantity of the former, to be wrought
upon by it. And as for the <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed
difficulty, that the Medicine <U+017F>hould
Ferret out, if I may <U+017F>o <U+017F>peak, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick
matter, in what ve<U+017F><U+017F>el <U+017F>oever
of the Body it lies, this objection
might have been con<U+017F>iderable, before
the di<U+017F>covery of the Bloods circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But 'tis not <U+017F>o now that we know,
that things that once get into the
Ma<U+017F>s of Blood, are pre<U+017F>ently whirl'd
about with it, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
by it even to <U+017F>mall ve<U+017F><U+017F>els
lying in the remote<U+017F>t Parts of the
Body.</p>
                  <p>5thly. And this prompts me to
take notice, that our <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> may
help us to an<U+017F>wer tho<U+017F>e many learned
Phy<U+017F>icians, that either reject, or at
lea<U+017F>t de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e, mo<U+017F>t External remedies,
e<U+017F>pecially <hi>Pericarpia, Amulets,</hi> and
<hi>Appen<U+017F>a,</hi> upon a <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition, both
that they neither can furni<U+017F>h the Body
they do but externally touch, with
any <U+017F>tore of Medicinal Particles; and
which is chiefly in this place to be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49353:31"/>
con<U+017F>ider'd, that being but external re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
they mu<U+017F>t be very unable to
do good in Internal di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, e<U+017F>pecially
<U+017F>uch as are <U+017F>eated in Parts, remote
from tho<U+017F>e which the Medicine is
apply'd to. But as to the former part
of the objection, 'twill not be difficult
to an<U+017F>wer it to him that has read
what I have el<U+017F>ewhere written of the
<U+017F>ubtility, numerou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s and efficacy

                  <p>Sometimes a Specifick Medicine may
mortify the over Acid, or other immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Particles that infe<U+017F>t the Ma<U+017F>s
of Blood, and de<U+017F>troy their coagulatory or

                  <p>ThÃ´ I am not of their opinion, who
of late are wont to impute almo<U+017F>t all
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es to acidity, abounding in the
Blood and other Liquors of the Body,
by who<U+017F>e intervention the <U+017F>table parts
al<U+017F>o are offended; yet I readily grant
that a con<U+017F>iderable number of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tempers
are, at lea<U+017F>t in great part,
produc'd either by Acids them<U+017F>elves,
or by their bad effects or Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Agreeably to which Doctrine we
may very probably conceive, that <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Maladies may be either quite
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49353:32"/>
cur'd, or much le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd, by a Specifick
Remedy that abounds in Corpu<U+017F>cles
fitted to mortify Acids. This mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
may be effected by more
than one way, and of the<U+017F>e wayes the
chief that now occur to my thoughts,
are two.</p>
                  <p>For there are <U+017F>ome Bodies, that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
or di<U+017F>able Acids by a <hi>po<U+017F>itive
Ho<U+017F>tility,</hi> if I may <U+017F>o term it; that is,
by <U+017F>uch a contrariety as is di<U+017F>cernable
by the Ta<U+017F>t, and more by the vi<U+017F>ible
conflict, and manife<U+017F>t Tumult, that is
produc'd, when they come to invade
an Acid. Of this <U+017F>ort of mortifiers
of Acids, are the mo<U+017F>t part of tho<U+017F>e
that are call'd <hi>Alcali<U+017F>ate Salts.</hi> Whether
<hi>fixt,</hi> as the Lixivial Salts of Plants,
or <hi>volatile,</hi> as the Spirits and a<U+017F>cending
Salts of Urine, Blood, Harts-horn,
Soot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As may be exemplify'd,
when any of the<U+017F>e comes to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> Spirit of Salt,
Oyl of Vitriol, or the like Acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
by which by the way we may
<U+017F>ee, that tho<U+017F>e Galeni<U+017F>ts mi<U+017F>take, who
a<U+017F>cribe the vertues of Spirit of Harts-horn,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49353:33"/>
and of Urine, only to their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
of Parts, Briskne<U+017F>s of Motion, and
the like affections, that they might
not <U+017F>eem beholding to the Chymi<U+017F>ts
for <U+017F>o u<U+017F>eful a notion, as that of
the contrariety of Acids and Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
                  <p>The other principal way, by which
Acids may be mortifi'd, or di<U+017F>abled
to bite, is by <hi>Sheathing</hi> them, if I
may <U+017F>o expre<U+017F>s it. For <hi>as</hi> a knife may
be di<U+017F>abled to cut, either by filing
off or otherwi<U+017F>e blunting its Edge,
or el<U+017F>e by covering the Blade with
a <U+017F>heath fit for it, or by <U+017F>ticking it into
a Loaf of Bread, or the like Body fit
to receive and detain the whole Blade;
<U+017F>o an Acid Corpu<U+017F>cle may lo<U+017F>e its
power of cutting or pricking, either
by having its Figure <U+017F>poil'd by the
action of a <U+017F>trong and manife<U+017F>t Alcaly,
or el<U+017F>e by being as it were <U+017F>heath'd
in a Porous Body, thÃ´ perhaps en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with no Ta<U+017F>t, or any other
manife<U+017F>t Quality, by which one would
think it contrary to the Acid it di<U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
as a file is to the edge of a knife.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49353:33"/>
Of this way of mortifying Acids,
Chymical operations afford us many
in<U+017F>tances, as when <hi>Menium</hi> de<U+017F>troyes
the Acidity of Spirit of Vinegar, as
I have found Chalk will do that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
Fortis</hi> it <U+017F>elf; and <hi>Lapis Calamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
very much le<U+017F><U+017F>ens, as well as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the Acidity of Spirit of Salt,
and even of Spirit of Niter. And I
the rather mention this Mineral,
both becau<U+017F>e its Qualities are le<U+017F>s
known to Phy<U+017F>icians, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Chymi<U+017F>ts, and becau<U+017F>e it
<U+017F>upplies me with an Argument to
prove that Acids may be, thÃ´ I do
not think they alwayes <hi>are,</hi> rather
<U+017F>heath'd in, than de<U+017F>troy'd by the
Bodies that <U+017F>ilently mortify them.
For, as <hi>Glauber</hi> has truly enough ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved,
Acid Spirits (as I have try'd
in <U+017F>ome) may by force of fire be
driven in Di<U+017F>tillation out of the
<hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> very much
dephlegm'd, and <U+017F>tronger than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>I know it may be here objected,
that the Mortification of Acids is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49353:34"/>
by a manife<U+017F>t Quality, and
therefore makes nothing for the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of Specifick Medicines. But
to this I an<U+017F>wer.</p>
                  <p>1. That the power of mortifying
Acids, e<U+017F>pecially by <U+017F>heathing them,
or if you plea<U+017F>e, by Ab<U+017F>orption of
them, is none of tho<U+017F>e Qualities,
whether Fir<U+017F>t, Second or Third, that
the former Phy<U+017F>icians took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in Medicines; thÃ´ the <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the<U+017F>e Qualities to cure di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
has been, and <U+017F>till is, us'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as a ground of denying the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
vertues of remedies.</p>
                  <p>2. That I have often look'd upon
it as an happy mi<U+017F>take, and of ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equence,
that <U+017F>o many learned mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Phy<U+017F>icians take it for granted,
that if a Medicine be endow'd with a
manife<U+017F>t Quality, as Acid or Alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ate,
the <hi>good</hi> it does, (and the like
for the mo<U+017F>t part may be <U+017F>aid of the
<hi>Harm</hi>) may <U+017F>afely be ab<U+017F>crib'd to that
Quality, that is to its being of an
Acid, or el<U+017F>e of an Alcali<U+017F>ate nature;
whereas in my poor Judgment, there
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49353:34"/>
being a con<U+017F>iderable di<U+017F>parity, as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Tryals have a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me, between
Acid and Acid, as likewi<U+017F>e between
Alcaly aud Alcaly, 'tis fit to di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>h
betwixt an Acid for in<U+017F>tance, as
meerly <U+017F>uch, and the peculiar modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
that may belong to that Acid.
Thus, thÃ´ all Acid <hi>Men<U+017F>truums</hi> that I
know of, if they be well dephlegm'd,
will di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Copper, yet <hi>Aqua Regis</hi>
that will di<U+017F><U+017F>olve not only that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
but the much more clo<U+017F>ely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
body of Gold, will not at all
di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Silver; as on the other <U+017F>ide
<hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> as corro<U+017F>ive a <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi>
as it is, will not of it <U+017F>elf di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Gold,
but if you give it a new Modification,
by adding to it common Spirit of Salt,
which it <U+017F>elf I have often found
(whatever Chymi<U+017F>ts think or have
written to the contrary) will leave
it entire, the <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will ea<U+017F>ily
di<U+017F><U+017F>olve that Metal. Nay a different
Modification may not only make a
<hi>Di<U+017F>parity</hi> between Acid, but that which
according to the receiv'd way of
Judging, ought to be call'd a <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety:</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49353:35"/>
for Spirit of Salt will precipitate
Silver, which <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> has di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd,
and Spirit of Niter, thÃ´ one of
the Acide<U+017F>t <hi>Men<U+017F>truums</hi> we have, will
not only precipitate an Antimonical
powder out of that odd <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, that
Chymi<U+017F>ts call <hi>Butter of Antimony,</hi>
but will do it with a wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
tumult, and efferve<U+017F>ence; and
yet this Butter of Antimony is <U+017F>o
highly Acid, that a little quantity
of it, put into a con<U+017F>iderable one of
Water, makes it <U+017F>o <U+017F>our, that many
Chymi<U+017F>ts call it <hi>Acetum Philo<U+017F>opho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
And now to apply the<U+017F>e things
to the lately propos'd objection, I
de<U+017F>ire it may be remembred, that
near the beginning of this Letter I
plainly intimated to you, that I did
not deny, but that a Specifick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
may <U+017F>ometimes be accompany'd
with, or even in part operate by a
manife<U+017F>t quality, but that yet I thought
the good effect was not due, barely
to the kind or degree of the manife<U+017F>t
Quality, but to <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>uperadded
which gave it a Specifick vertue,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49353:35"/>
again<U+017F>t this or that particular Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.
And <U+017F>uitably to this it may be <U+017F>aid,
that, as there are <U+017F>everal kinds of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
and of Alcalies too, 'tis not every
Acid that will be mortifi'd by every
Alcaly; and have its Effects de<U+017F>troy'd
by it, which may be illu<U+017F>trated by this,
that, <hi>thÃ´</hi> when Copper is di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in
<hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, by the help
of meer Chalk skilfully apply'd to
make the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> let go the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles
of the Metal, <hi>yet</hi> if upon <U+017F>uch
a high colour'd <U+017F>olution of Copper,
you <U+017F>hall pour (as to convince <U+017F>ome
ingenious men, I have purpo<U+017F>ely done
a due quantity of Spirit of Urine, or
the like volatile Alcaly, thÃ´ there
will pre<U+017F>ently en<U+017F>ue a great conflict
and manife<U+017F>t ebullition, with noi<U+017F>e
and <U+017F>tore of Bubbles, yet between
the<U+017F>e Ho<U+017F>tile Salts, a multitude of the
Acid Corpu<U+017F>cles of the <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi>
will not be <U+017F>o mortified, as to let go the
Metal, but the <U+017F>olution varying its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
will have and keep a deeper one
than before.</p>
                  <p>And when I con<U+017F>ider the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49353:36"/>
that a Skilful Ob<U+017F>erver may find,
between Vinegar, Alum, Cry<U+017F>tals of
Tartar, Juice of Lemmons, Juice of
Barbaries, the e<U+017F><U+017F>ential Salts (as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ts
call them) of tho<U+017F>e Plants that
are <U+017F>our in Ta<U+017F>t, to omit divers other
Acids, I am apt to think, that di<U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
nature may have, in a di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>ed
Body, produc'd Acids of <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts
which are not particularly known to
us, and that <U+017F>ome of the<U+017F>e may be of
<U+017F>uch a nature, that none of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Alcalies, as <U+017F>uch, is able to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
them, and which yet may be
mortify'd, at lea<U+017F>t by the way of
Sheathing, by <U+017F>ome appropriated or
peculiarly modify'd Corpu<U+017F>cles of a
Specifick Remedy which may be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<U+017F>trated
by what is el<U+017F>ewhere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd,
that, thÃ´ neither Spirit of
Vinegar, nor Spirit of Salt, nor Oyl
of Vitriol it <U+017F>elf, would, as far as I
have try'd, di<U+017F><U+017F>olve a <U+017F>tone taken
out of a mans Body, yet Spirit
of Niter, (which does not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olve

found di<U+017F><U+017F>oluble in Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol)

will readily work upon it,
and thereby lo<U+017F>e, its Corro<U+017F>ive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>Before I leave this Subject, 'twill
not be ami<U+017F>s to intimare a couple of
things, that perhaps you will not think
impertinent to it.</p>
                  <p>One of the<U+017F>e is, that, whereas I
not long ago di<U+017F>tinctly nam'd Acids
them<U+017F>elves and their Productions, I
did it (not out of Inadvertence, but)
becau<U+017F>e I think Preternatural Acids do
not only di<U+017F>affect the Body while<U+017F>t
they continue <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly Acid, but may
in divers ca<U+017F>es be the cau<U+017F>es of <U+017F>ome
Di<U+017F>tempers, whereof mo<U+017F>t men would
think them more likely to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
For, <hi>thÃ´</hi> Acids be reputed to
have an Inci<U+017F>ive and Re<U+017F>olutive ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and therefore <hi>Oxymel</hi> and <U+017F>ome
other Acetous Medicines are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to cut tough Phlegm, and
Spirit of Vitriol is us'd for the <U+017F>ame
purpo<U+017F>e, and to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve coagulated
Blood; <hi>Yet,</hi> as I am willing to grant
this vertue unto Acids in <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>es,
<U+017F>o there are others wherein I much
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49353:37"/>
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, that ob<U+017F>tructions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equently
the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es that u<U+017F>ually
attend ob<U+017F>tinate ones, may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion'd
by Acids, as they coagulate
<U+017F>ome Fluids in the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood,
that are di<U+017F>pos'd to be thicken'd by
them, and by that con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence made
unfit to pa<U+017F>s with the re<U+017F>t of the
circulating Blood, through the <U+017F>mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and <U+017F>trainers of the Body,
where upon that account they make
ob<U+017F>tructions. This I <U+017F>hall exemplify
by the coagulation that I have made
by <U+017F>ome Acid Salts, as Spirit of Salt,
of the White of an Egg, e<U+017F>pecially if
by beating reduc'd to an Aqueous
Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence. And the like coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may ea<U+017F>ily be effected in Milk,
which may not only be <U+017F>peedily
curdl'd with Spirit of Salt, but, as
is known by Bodies not Chymically
prepar'd, as Rennet and Juice of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
And Experiments purpo<U+017F>ely
made have <U+017F>hown, that, if <U+017F>ome
Acids be convey'd immediately into

even that Liquor, whil<U+017F>t it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49353:37"/>
in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the yet living
Animals.</p>
                  <p>The other thing I lately told you,
I was to ob<U+017F>erve, is, that, <hi>thÃ´</hi> Acid
Corpu<U+017F>cles are tho<U+017F>e, that modern
Phy<U+017F>icians and Chymi<U+017F>ts are wont
to take notice of as hurtful, both in the
Blood and <U+017F>table Parts of the Body,
except the Stomach, and perhaps
<U+017F>ome few neighbouring Parts, as the
Spleen and <hi>Pancres.</hi> And, <hi>thÃ´</hi> <U+017F>ome
ingenious men proceed <U+017F>o far, as to
impute almo<U+017F>t all Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es to the bad
Effects of <hi>Acids,</hi> yet I am very incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to think, that divers maladies
and ttouble<U+017F>om Symptoms proceed
from Corpu<U+017F>cles, that, whether they
be of a Saline nature or not, are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from Acids properly <U+017F>o call'd. For
I con<U+017F>ider, that there may be many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
which may as 'twere re<U+017F>ult from
the combination of Acids with other
Saline Particles, that much alter their
nature, as I have el<U+017F>ewhere noted, that
Spirit of Salt will, with Spirit of
Urine, compo<U+017F>e a kind of Sal-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac;
and Spirit of Niter with Salt of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49353:38"/>
Tartar di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd in common Water,
will concoagulate with it into Salt
<hi>Petre</hi> (or a Body exceeding like it,)
and the <U+017F>ame Spirit of Niter or <hi>Aqua
Fortis</hi> with Spirit of Urine, or of Blood,
or the like, will afford a very fu<U+017F>ible
Salt, differing enough from what
either of the Ingredients was before
their conjunction. And 'tis vulgarly
known, that Oyl of Vitriol, and Oyl
of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> do by their
coalition produce <hi>Tartarum Vitriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
in which the Acidity of the
former, and the Alcali<U+017F>atene<U+017F>s of the
latter, are very much infring'd, a
third Body being by re<U+017F>ultancy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
that differs much both from
the former and the latter <hi>Oyl,</hi> or rather
<hi>Saline Liquor.</hi> And when, be<U+017F>ides
In<U+017F>tances of this nature, I con<U+017F>ider
how many differing <U+017F>orts of Corpu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<U+017F>o fruitful a Principle as <hi>nature</hi>
may have form'd, that, without being
Acid, may yet have notable and
hurtful Effects upon the Blood, or
<U+017F>ome particular <U+017F>olid part of the Body.
It <U+017F>eems probable to me, that there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49353:38"/>
may be other Qualities requir'd, to
mortify or di<U+017F>able the<U+017F>e Morbifick
Corpu<U+017F>cles, than a contrariety to
Acid Salts, and con<U+017F>equently, that a
Medicine that affords Corpu<U+017F>cles
peculiarly fitted to correct or ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
this particular <U+017F>ort of hurtful
ones, may de<U+017F>erve the name of a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I further con<U+017F>ider, that,
as in the Body there may be divers
coagulations made by Saline Corpu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
manife<U+017F>tly Acid; <U+017F>o there may
be others produc'd by Corpu<U+017F>cles,
Whether Saline in ta<U+017F>t or no, that are
not manife<U+017F>tly Acid, but perhaps
rather of a contrary nature, which
ob<U+017F>ervation, being wont to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
by Phy<U+017F>icians, and yet in my
opinion of no <U+017F>mall importance, may
de<U+017F>erve to be a little the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
made out. I have <U+017F>ometimes
for curio<U+017F>ity made a Liquor, that
was not in Ta<U+017F>t either Acid or Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;
to which having put a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
proportion of a di<U+017F>till'd Liquor,
which it <U+017F>elf was not in ta<U+017F>t ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49353:39"/>
Acid, or Urinous, or lixiviate,
it would in a very <U+017F>hort time, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in not many minutes, be coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
into <U+017F>o con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent a Body,
that, thÃ´ the wide mouth'd Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el
were held with the Orifice down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
nothing would fall out of it.</p>
                  <p>I have taught in another (unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>h'd
Paper, that if upon a certain
<U+017F>olution (which I there <U+017F>how how to
make) one drop <U+017F>ome Spirit of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
or anorhet Volatile Alcaly, there
will pre<U+017F>ently be produc'd a Gelly,

                  <p>The like Gelly, but more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>parent,
I have more than once
made, without the help of any

                  <p>I have al<U+017F>o, to convince <U+017F>ome
<hi>virtuo<U+017F>i,</hi> <U+017F>howed them <U+017F>omewhat to

prepar'd without the help of Urine,

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49353:39"/>
almo<U+017F>t in a trice) that would

                  <p>And to <U+017F>hew you, that 'tis not
requi<U+017F>ite that a Liquor be <U+017F>trongly,
or <U+017F>o much as <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly Acid, to
coagulate an Animal Sub<U+017F>tance, as I
lately noted, that the Spirit of Salt

                  <p>Sometimes the Specifick Medicine

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49353:40"/>
of a contrary Quality, yet I thought
fit to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omething of it apart:
Becau<U+017F>e I have ob<U+017F>erved that <U+017F>ome
Acids and Alcalies may be put together
without cau<U+017F>ing Precipitation by their
contrariety; and on the other <U+017F>ide,
that divers Precipitations may be
produc'd where there do's not appear
any Ho<U+017F>tility, though I know divers
ingenious men, who think this Effect
it <U+017F>elf a <U+017F>ufficient Argument, that the
ho<U+017F>tility of Acids and Alcalies mu<U+017F>t
be the cau<U+017F>e of it. But that <U+017F>hould
not be taken for granted, but prov'd
by collateral Experiments, that do
not <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the Truth of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<U+017F>is</hi>
it <U+017F>elf. But to proceed to our
Exampls, I know (and el<U+017F>ewhere
mention) <U+017F>everal Urinous Spirits,
that I could mix with Acid <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi>
without making any manife<U+017F>t Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
or Precipitation; And on the
other<U+017F>ide, Acids and Alcalies, that
will make a manife<U+017F>t Conflict by
their mutual creation, and yet if they
be mingled in a ju<U+017F>t proportion, will
have for the con<U+017F>equent of their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49353:40"/>
Mixture, Coalition in<U+017F>tead of Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation;
as may be exemplified in
certain Mixtures of Spirit of Sal-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac
(made with Salt of Tartar,
or Pot-A<U+017F>hes) and Spirit of Nitre or
<hi>Aqua Fortis;</hi> and al<U+017F>o when Spirit of
Urine and Spirit of Salt, being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
in a certain proportion, convene
into Corpu<U+017F>cles for the making of
Sal-Armoniac, which the Phlegm of
tho<U+017F>e Liquors will keep <U+017F>wimming.
But that which makes mo<U+017F>t for my
pre<U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>e, is, that there may
be Precipitations, where, whatever
may be <U+017F>uppos'd, it does not appear
that there is any Tumult or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
as when Silver being di<U+017F><U+017F>olved
in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi>
diluted with 30 or 40 parts of di<U+017F>till'd
Water, or of Rain Water, if clean
Plates of Copper be immer<U+017F>'d in the
Solution, the Metal will be very
<U+017F>lowly Precipitated out of it, in the
form not of a <hi>Calx,</hi> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of
Metalline, and Saline Parts incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
together, but, at lea<U+017F>t at the

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49353:41"/>
Scales of Silver, almo<U+017F>t like the
white and glittering Scales of <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>mal Fi<U+017F>hes. There is al<U+017F>o a way, by
which I have brought di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd Gold
to <U+017F>ettle about a Body, <U+017F>u<U+017F>pended in
the Solution, in the form of a fine and
high-colour'd <hi>Calx</hi> of pure Gold. But
you may ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>ee an In<U+017F>tance of <U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Precipitation, if you do but rub
a little either <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Dantzick</hi>
Vitriol, upon the well whetted blade
of a knife wetted with Water or Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
for you will have the Steel, almo<U+017F>t
in a trice, overlaid with a reddi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance,
which by its colour and other
<U+017F>igns appears manife<U+017F>tly to be Cupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And here I <U+017F>hall adverti<U+017F>e you,
that 'tis not only, as is wont to be
<U+017F>uppos'd, out of Solutions made with
Acids, that bodies may be thus Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated,
for upon <U+017F>earch I have found
that there are in nature Precipitants,
that are capable of <U+017F>ilently Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
<U+017F>ome Bodies di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinous
<hi>Men<U+017F>truums,</hi> or others not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid.
I know it may be <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, and
that not without colour of Rea<U+017F>on,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49353:41"/>
that <U+017F>uch Precipitations may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
by producing Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Corpu<U+017F>cles in the Blood, that
may be too-heavy or gro<U+017F>s to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated.
And I look upon this as a
<U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, for who<U+017F>e Re<U+017F>olution
'twere fit to con<U+017F>ult Experience.
But in the mean time one may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent.</p>
                  <p>1. That, thÃ´ <U+017F>ome Inconvenience
may happen from the Bulk of the
precipitated Corpu<U+017F>cles, yet that may
be much inferiour to the danger
threatned by the over-active &amp; ho<U+017F>tile
Particles, that produc'd or fomented
the di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>2. That, 'tis not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that all
concretions <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of Corpu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<U+017F>o bulky, as to be too big to be
thrown out of the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood, for
we <U+017F>ee that <U+017F>tony matter, which, as
the Chymical <hi>Analy<U+017F>is</hi> of it <U+017F>hews, is
of a very compounded nature, may
be carryed to all Parts of the Body.
And I remember I knew a Lady, who
a while before <U+017F>he told me the Story,
had a <U+017F>tone taken out of the lower
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49353:42"/>
part of her Tongue. And Phy<U+017F>icians,
that pre<U+017F>cribe great quantities of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Waters impregnated with <hi>Iron,</hi>
<U+017F>uch as I found tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> to be,
and with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> <U+017F>uch as <U+017F>ome of the
<hi>Bath</hi> Waters are, are wont to build
their expectations of Curing with
them, upon a <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition, that they are
carryed into the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood, and
con<U+017F>equently to the innermo<U+017F>t parts
of the Body.</p>
                  <p>3. That yet 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be made of matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Blood, by Medicines
that do not get into the Ma<U+017F>s of it.
As Phy<U+017F>icians give Steel in Sub<U+017F>tance
<U+017F>ometimes crude, as well as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
prepar'd, to mortify the Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Blood, though the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Corpu<U+017F>cles do not, for ought
we know, pa<U+017F>s into the Ma<U+017F>s of it,
but are wrought upon by the matter,
that in its circulation is thrown out
of it into the Stomach &amp; Guts, where
their operation on it is probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from the blackne<U+017F>s, that Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beates
are wont give the excrements
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49353:42"/>
of the lower Belly; and if they will
have it, that prepar'd Steel, for in<U+017F>tance,
calcin'd with Sulphur, gets through
the Pores of the Bowels, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of the capillary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, into
the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood it <U+017F>elf, 'twill be
obvious to demand, why nature <U+017F>hould
not be able to expel Precipitate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles
at the <U+017F>ame pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, at which

by agitation through this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
<U+017F>tinking Water, (which did not

appear turbid to the Eye) in <U+017F>o very
<U+017F>mall a proportion, Precipitated out of
it a very little and light Feculency,
which being <U+017F>eparated, the re<U+017F>t of the
Liquor was quite freed from all <U+017F>tink;
nor did I ob<U+017F>erve that the Feculency
it <U+017F>elf had any. And, which is very
notable, all this was done in a very few
minutes, by a Precipitant, who<U+017F>e Ta<U+017F>t
was not at all either Bitter, or Acid, or
Urinous, or Lixivial. All which are
Circum<U+017F>tances, that may afford good

                  <p>Sometimes the Specifick Remedy
may work, by peculiarly <U+017F>trenthening,
and cheri<U+017F>hing the Heart, and by that

                  <p>This Ob<U+017F>ervation can <U+017F>carce be
made good, without entring into the
Controver<U+017F>y, which for its difficulty
and importance, has perplex'd divers
Modern Phy<U+017F>icians; whether there
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49353:44"/>
be any Medicines, that have a Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
with the Head, Heart, Liver <hi>&amp;c</hi>
and thereby de<U+017F>erve the name of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalic,
Cordial,</hi> or <hi>Hepatic &amp;c.</hi> Or,
to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>omewhat more clearly,
whether there be any Medicines, that
in a peculiar manner do good to this
or that particular internal part of the
Body. In this di<U+017F>pute the Affirmative
part has been held, but I doubt upon
<U+017F>lender grounds of rea<U+017F>on, in mo<U+017F>t of
the Phy<U+017F>ick Schools for <U+017F>everal Ages.
But in our times, many do not only
maintain the Negative, but deride the
Opinion they have for<U+017F>aken. For <U+017F>ome
of them object in a Triumphant Style,
that tis ridiculous to fancy <U+017F>uch a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,
betwixt a dead Medicine, and
the Parts of a living body. As that the
Phy<U+017F>ician may <U+017F>end the Drug, as
'twere of an Errand, to find out one
in the dark, among a multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and do it good offices.</p>
                  <p>But notwith<U+017F>tanding this, I think
it very po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that a Medicine may
<U+017F>o far re<U+017F>pect a particular Part, as,
though not to be beneficial to that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49353:45"/>
only, yet to be friendly to that, in a
peculiar manner or degree. And this
I conceive it may be, upon one or
more of the Accounts, that I <U+017F>hall
briefly mention.</p>
                  <p>And Fir<U+017F>t, when I con<U+017F>ider that the
<U+017F>table Parts of the Body, as the Heart,
Brain, Liver, Kidneys <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have
each its particular <U+017F>tructure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it differs from others, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the fluid Parts al<U+017F>o, as Blood,
Gall, Lympha <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
Textures, it <U+017F>eems not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
to me, that the Corpu<U+017F>cles of a
Medicine di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd in the Stomach,
and carryed too and fro by the Liquors
of the Body, may according to the
determinate <U+017F>hape, <U+017F>ize, <U+017F>tiffne<U+017F>s or
flexility, motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be much more
fit to be detain'd by one part of the
Body, as the Brain, the Heart <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
than by the re<U+017F>t; and <U+017F>o, by lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it <U+017F>elf in its Pores, or a<U+017F><U+017F>ociating
with its Fibres, may <U+017F>upply it with
<U+017F>uch congruous Particle, as it either
does want, or in ca<U+017F>e it do not, may
by their congruity be of advantage to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49353:45"/>
it, by re-e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing or <U+017F>trengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Tone of it. And by this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration,
the Part may be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Ho<U+017F>tilities of Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
Matters, which Phy<U+017F>icians
u<U+017F>ually ob<U+017F>erve to be wont, by the
more <hi>Vigorous</hi> Parts, to be thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Weakned</hi> or <hi>Di<U+017F>temper'd</hi> ones;
as is manife<U+017F>t in per<U+017F>ons that are much
<U+017F>ubject to the <hi>Gout,</hi> in whom often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
peccant humors are very apt,
upon <U+017F>everal occa<U+017F>ions, to be thrown
off by the nobler Parts, if they be ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<U+017F>t,
upon the frequently debilitated
Joints; on which <U+017F>core the Gout, if
it be well managed, is, not irrational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wont to be thought conducive to
long life. And on this occa<U+017F>ion I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that I formerly knew a
Learned Phy<U+017F>ician, who, though a
great Traveller, and, as <U+017F>uch, accu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd
to great varieties in point of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
had <U+017F>uch a peculiar indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition
in his Jaw, that though he could mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
drink Wines of <U+017F>everal <U+017F>orts
without inconvenience, yet the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
even of a very little Brandy, would
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49353:46"/>
<U+017F>oon after give him the Tooth Ach,
of which odd di<U+017F>temper he has <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
complain'd to me. But this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the by: For I mu<U+017F>t now proceed
to illu<U+017F>trate and make probable, what
I was <U+017F>aying of the po<U+017F><U+017F>ible fitne<U+017F>s of
<U+017F>ome Medicinal Corpu<U+017F>cles, to a<U+017F><U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
them<U+017F>elves with tho<U+017F>e of the
Part they are to befriend, by ob<U+017F>erv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what happens in Nutrition, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in that of <U+017F>ucking-children. For
in the<U+017F>e, one <U+017F>ingle Aliment, namely
Milk, does afford, be<U+017F>ides various
excrements, <U+017F>uch as the gro<U+017F><U+017F>er <hi>faeces</hi>
of the Guts, and the more fluid ones
of the Bladder, the Mouth, the No<U+017F>e,
the pores of the Skin <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a great
number of Corpu<U+017F>cles, that are not
only detain'd, but a<U+017F><U+017F>imilated by Parts
of differing Structures, as the Brain,
the Heart, the Bones <hi>&amp;c.</hi> <U+017F>ince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
the<U+017F>e parts could never be <U+017F>o
plentifully nouri<U+017F>hed by them, as day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to increa<U+017F>e in all their Dimen<U+017F>ions.
And tis con<U+017F>iderable, that <U+017F>ome Parts,
which in Babes are Cartilaginous, do
in proce<U+017F>s of time become Boney,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49353:46"/>
which change <U+017F>eems not probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to the bare ex<U+017F>iccation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by Native heat, increa<U+017F>ing with
the Per<U+017F>ons Age.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the friendly Corpu<U+017F>cles
of a Specifick Medicine, may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirm the good e<U+017F>tate of a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Part, but, which makes mo<U+017F>t
for our pre<U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>e, they may
very much conduce to re<U+017F>tore it to a
<U+017F>ound condition, when it is di<U+017F>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
and this they may do upon
two or three Accounts.</p>
                  <p>For in the fir<U+017F>t place, tho<U+017F>e friendly
Particles may di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e the Ob<U+017F>tructing
or other Morbifick matter, to be
more ea<U+017F>ily and <U+017F>afely expell'd. And
this they may do, not barely <hi>as</hi> they
impregnate the whole Ma<U+017F>s of Blood,
and <U+017F>o may be carried by it, as well
to many other Parts, as to that we
now con<U+017F>ider; but <hi>as</hi> by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Texture, Motion <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they
may in a peculiar manner re<U+017F>pect that
peculiar Modification, which the
Peccant matter may have acquir'd by
being produc'd or harbour'd in that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49353:47"/>
determinate part: And that the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
Structure of an affected Part
may much diver<U+017F>ifie the condition of
a Morbifick matter, I argue from
this, among other things, that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians
are wont to teach (though I
have found the Ob<U+017F>ervation rather to
hold commonly than unre<U+017F>ervedly)
that in tho<U+017F>e that are <U+017F>ubject to this
Stone, the Petre<U+017F>cent matter, when
it is bred in the Kidneys is reddi<U+017F>h
or yellowi<U+017F>h, but when in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
white, or of a light gray; and
that the Stones that are generated in
the fir<U+017F>t nam'd Parts, are more friable,
or at lea<U+017F>t of a <U+017F>lighter Texture, than
tho<U+017F>e that have their Original in the
Bladder, <U+017F>ome of which are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hard, e<U+017F>pecially in compari<U+017F>on of
large ones, that I have had out of the
Bladder or Gall of lu<U+017F>ty Animals.
The aptne<U+017F>s then that the Corpu<U+017F>cles
of the Specifick may give the Blood,
or other Liquor that conveys them,
to act as an appropriated <hi>Men<U+017F>truum,</hi>
upon the peculiarly modified Matter
that ob<U+017F>tructs, or otherwi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>affects,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49353:47"/>
the Liver, for In<U+017F>tance, may enable
the Remedy, to be very helpful to
that Part, by preparing the mole<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Matter for expul<U+017F>ion. But it may
al<U+017F>o <U+017F>uccour the <U+017F>ame Part in another
way.</p>
                  <p>For in the <U+017F>econd place, it may <U+017F>o
work upon the Fibres, and <U+017F>table
portion of the Part affected, as both
to enable it, and excite it to free its
<U+017F>elf from its Enemy. For <hi>it</hi> may give
firmne<U+017F>s and <U+017F>trength to the Fibres of
the part; <hi>it</hi> may al<U+017F>o contemperate,
or correct the immoderate heat, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> of it: <hi>It</hi> may mortify the
Acid, or other incongruous Particles,
that are lodg'd in the minute Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of the <U+017F>table Parts, end perhaps,
even in the Pores of the Fibres: <hi>It</hi>
may appea<U+017F>e its Convul<U+017F>ions, Cramps,
or other inordinate motions, that
hinder it from daily executing its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Functions; <hi>it</hi> may relax or wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Pores, according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of the work to be perform'd.
And having thus, by means of its
friendly Corpu<U+017F>cles, prepar'd the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49353:48"/>
matter to be expell'd, and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed
the part to expell it, <hi>it</hi> may then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o
excite the Part to do its office, by
irritating the Fibres, or motive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
or <U+017F>timulating them to disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the Part of the Matter that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
it, as a very <U+017F>mall Do<U+017F>e of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides</hi>
is known by this way of
irritation, to be capable of making
the Bladder forcibly, though not <U+017F>afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
di<U+017F>charge it <U+017F>elf of Urine, and
with that oftentimes expel the Sand
and Gravel, or le<U+017F><U+017F>er Stones, and the
Excrementitious Slime that mole<U+017F>ted
it before.</p>
                  <p>And this In<U+017F>tance may be of u<U+017F>e to
us, in an<U+017F>wering that which we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
noted to be <U+017F>o confidently urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Rejecters of Specifick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.
For here we have a Medicine,
though a dangerous one, who<U+017F>e Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles
have <U+017F>uch a peculiar refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Bladder, and Urinary
Organs, that though being gotten into
the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood, they are carried
by it indi<U+017F>criminately to other parts
of the Body, as well as to the<U+017F>e; yet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49353:48"/>
oftentimes, without manife<U+017F>tly di<U+017F>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the re<U+017F>t, they exceedingly ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
the Bladder, and determine it
to the excretion of what it contains.
And whereas it may be objected,
that the <hi>fir<U+017F>t</hi> of the three ways, by
which we noted, that a particular
Part may be <U+017F>uccour'd by a Specifick,
<U+017F>eems contrary to the <hi><U+017F>econd;</hi> the
former tending to corroborate the
Part, and the later to relax and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
it: I an<U+017F>wer two things, <hi>one,</hi>
that <U+017F>ince the Part may be <U+017F>ometimes
in a Natural, and <U+017F>ometimes in a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
<U+017F>tate, in the <hi>former,</hi> a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
may de<U+017F>erve the name of
<hi>Friendly</hi> or <hi>Appropriated,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it
keeps it <U+017F>ound, which is mo<U+017F>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
done by <U+017F>trengthening it; and
in the <hi>later</hi> it may merit the Title of
a <hi>Specifick,</hi> becau<U+017F>e it helps to re<U+017F>tore
it to a <U+017F>tate of <U+017F>oundne<U+017F>s: And the
<hi>other,</hi> that though to effect this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
'tis often very expedient, if
not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that the Medicine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
an Evacuation of <U+017F>ome matter
that offends it; yet that Evacuation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49353:49"/>
it<U+017F>elf is often much promoted and
facilitated, by <U+017F>tengthening the Part
<U+017F>o, as to enable it to disburthen it <U+017F>elf.
And the <U+017F>ame Medicine may contain,
and communicate to the Blood, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles
of <U+017F>uch differing <U+017F>hapes, <U+017F>izes,
motions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as may at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ively
relieve the Part by both the<U+017F>e
ways; as Phy<U+017F>icians ob<U+017F>erve that
Rhubarb does, not only by its finer
and Laxative Parts, purge the Liver
of Choler, but by its more earthy
A<U+017F>tringent Corpu<U+017F>cles <U+017F>trengthen the
Tone of that Part: [What farther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Illu<U+017F>tration of this matter
will be met with in due place.] On
this occa<U+017F>ion, 'twill not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to add, that in <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>es, this
very Corroboration of a Di<U+017F>temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

there being <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of <U+017F>uch a

<U+017F>peak, almo<U+017F>t always in <hi>Fieri,</hi> that
is, they could not continue to <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t

its debility, and the con<U+017F>equences of

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49353:49"/>
time to time fre<U+017F>h recruits of peccant
matter, to foment the Malady: And
in <U+017F>uch Di<U+017F>tempers, if the Structure
and Tone of the Part be re-e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the operation of the Specifick
Medicine, its acquir'd vigour will
enable it to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Ingre<U+017F>s of new
<U+017F>upplies of peccant Matter, and to
turn them off into the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood,
to be thence di<U+017F>charg'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                  <p>We have not in this Paper given
any Example of the peculiar re<U+017F>pect

di<U+017F>affected Part, that one would
think <U+017F>o incredible, as that a heavy

<U+017F>hould manife<U+017F>tly contribute to the
Cure of a broken Bone in one of the
Limbs, as the Leg or the Hands. And
yet, not to urge the Te<U+017F>timony of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49353:50"/>
Chymical Writers, I remember a
<hi>German</hi> Phy<U+017F>ician, that was Famous
for notable Cures, related Wonders
to me of the efficacy of that Stone
growing in his Country, which from
its effect they call <hi>O<U+017F>teocolla,</hi> e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if it be improv'd by a Skilful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
which he communicated to
me, but I had not opportunity to
make Tryal of it. But without Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the judicious and long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
Chirurgeon <hi>Fabricius Hilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
much commends upon his own
Ob<U+017F>ervation a <U+017F>ingle Dram of it fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Powder'd, for the breeding of a
<hi>Callus</hi> to <U+017F>oder together the Parts of
a broken Bone: In<U+017F>omuch that he gives
a caution to u<U+017F>e it but <U+017F>paringly in
young and vigorous Patients, le<U+017F>t it
breed too great a <hi>Callus,</hi> of which he
gives a notable In<U+017F>tance. And the

                  <p>Sometimes a Specifick Medicine may do
its work, by producing in the Ma<U+017F>s

modern Phy<U+017F>itians, may di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that many, if not mo<U+017F>t, of their
Pre<U+017F>criptions are founded upon a <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition,
that a great Part of the
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es incident to Mans Body, and
the recovery from them, depends
mainly upon the vitiated Con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Blood, and the re<U+017F>toring
it to a <U+017F>ound Condition.</p>
                  <p>This advantageous change of the

1. That which I <U+017F>hall fir<U+017F>t name,
is, by furni<U+017F>hing the Blood with <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>ort of active Corpu<U+017F>cles, that it
needs to <hi>ferment</hi> it, or excite <hi>an
u<U+017F>eful Commotion or Agitation</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>I will not here examine, whether
the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood, contain'd within
the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of a living man, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a <hi>Fermentation</hi> properly and
<U+017F>trictly <U+017F>o call'd; and therefore I
employ'd al<U+017F>o the word <hi>Commotion,</hi>
which will be ea<U+017F>ily admitted, if the
other be di<U+017F>liked. But in regard <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi>
is a Term that hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
obtain'd, I <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>cruple to
make u<U+017F>e of it, after what I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
about it.</p>
                  <p>But becau<U+017F>e many modern Phy<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>ince the Learned <hi>Dr.
Willis</hi>'s Notions came to be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<U+017F>t,
have looked upon Feavers and
Agues to con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in, or be produc'd
by vitious Fermentations of the
Blood; I thought fit to add to
the <hi>Fermentation</hi> I am about to <U+017F>peak
of, the di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing Epithets of
<hi>u<U+017F>eful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:49353:51"/>
This premis'd, it <U+017F>eems not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
to me, that, as there is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
a vitious Fermentation of
the Blood, <U+017F>o there may be <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a want of Fermentation, or a
certain Sluggi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s, upon who<U+017F>e
account, <hi>either</hi> the brisk inte<U+017F>tine
Agitation, that it ought to have as
a warm Fluid of <U+017F>uch a Nature as
'tis wont to be in <U+017F>ound Per<U+017F>ons,
or a due quickne<U+017F>s of Circulation
through the Heart is wanting: To
which Sluggi<U+017F>h State of the Blood,
if it be ob<U+017F>tinate and la<U+017F>ting<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> <U+017F>everal
Di<U+017F>tempers are wont to be con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
Now, <hi>although</hi> there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Medicines, <U+017F>uch as Spices,
Brandy, and other Spirituous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
di<U+017F>till'd from fermented vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
that are u<U+017F>ually, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<U+017F>uccesfully enough, employ'd
to correct this dull Indi<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of
the Blood; Yet in regard they are
wont to be very hot, being
u<U+017F>ually pitch'd upon by tho<U+017F>e that
pre<U+017F>cribe them becau<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>o;
there are <U+017F>everal con<U+017F>titutions of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49353:52"/>
Patients, and divers other Circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/><U+017F>tances,
wherein they are not <U+017F>afe,
but may do more harm by their
immoderate Heat, than good by
their Spirituo<U+017F>ity, Be<U+017F>ides, that the
Sluggi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s of the Blood may <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
proceed from Cau<U+017F>es, that
this <U+017F>ort of hot Medicines will not
correct. I remember, that having
for Tryals <U+017F>ake moderately dry'd
a parcel of Human Blood, a <hi>Vinous
Spirit</hi> Total inflammable would not,
at lea<U+017F>t in many hours that my
Experiment la<U+017F>ted, make a Solution
of it, or draw a red Tincture from
it, though it were well pulveris'd:
Whereas a well rectified <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>rinous
Spirit</hi> grew red upon it in le<U+017F>s than
the tenth, or perhaps the twentieth,
part of that Time.</p>
                  <p>Now a Specifick Medicine may
abound in Corpu<U+017F>cles of <U+017F>uch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that without dangerou<U+017F>ly, or
incommodiou<U+017F>ly heating the Blood,
they may di<U+017F>able tho<U+017F>e Corpu<U+017F>cles,
they meet with in the Blood, that make
that Liquor vi<U+017F>cous, or roapy, or di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49353:52"/>
and al<U+017F>o by enlivening the Ma<U+017F>s
of Blood, if I may <U+017F>o <U+017F>peak, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it into a more brisk and kindly
Agitation, may make it fit to throw
off tho<U+017F>e Heterogeneous Parts, or
recrements, that were blended with
it before, and to permeate, as freely
as it ought, the <hi>Vi<U+017F>cera,</hi> who<U+017F>e Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els and Pores would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<U+017F>carce, and but very <U+017F>paring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
admit it.</p>
                  <p>That a Specifick may perform this,
you will perhaps the more ea<U+017F>ily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
if you con<U+017F>ider, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Phy<U+017F>itians teach, that
there are <U+017F>everal <hi>Cordials,</hi> which they
<U+017F>tyle <U+017F>ome of them <hi>Temperate,</hi> and
divers of them <hi>Cold,</hi> (as in effect
'tis not u<U+017F>ually ob<U+017F>erv'd, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderably,
if at all <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly, heat the
Body;) as Pearls, and <U+017F>ome of them,
being gratefully Acid, <U+017F>hould rather
cool it, as Wood-<U+017F>orrel (<hi>Alleluja</hi>) and
Goats-Rue (<hi>Galega.</hi>) And 'tis very
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that the Corpu<U+017F>cles, that
make the Blood thick, and Sluggi<U+017F>h,
may not be of a Cold Nature, but of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49353:53"/>
a Hot, and therefore may have their
Effects rather befriended than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troy'd
by divers Hot Remedies:
As, if the white of an Egg be by
beating reduc'd to Water, (which is
not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to the Experiment, but
<U+017F>hews it better) if you put to it a
certain Proportion of well dephleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd
Spirit of Wine, in<U+017F>tead of de<U+017F>troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the vi<U+017F>co<U+017F>ity of the Liquor, it
will curdle a good part of it, and
thereby produce a Body far more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from Thinne<U+017F>s and Fluidity.</p>
                  <p>And I remember, I once for Tryal
<U+017F>ake made a vegetable Liquor, which,
from <U+017F>omewhat Sluggi<U+017F>h that it was
before, did pre<U+017F>ently by the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a little Spirit of Wine, grow
<U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ingly vi<U+017F>cous, and roapy.</p>
                  <p>2. Another way, by which a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
may befriend the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood,
is, by imparting to it a dilatation or
tenuity that it wants. This Second
way is of much affinity to the Fir<U+017F>t,
but yet is not the <U+017F>ame: Becau<U+017F>e in
that, the thing mainly con<U+017F>idered
was, the Fermentation or Agitation
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49353:53"/>
of the Blood; Whereas this mainly
re<U+017F>pects the Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of it, which
is a thing of no mean importance to
health. For if the Blood be too thick,
as oftentimes it is, it cannot pa<U+017F>s
<U+017F>o freely and readily, as it ought,
through the Capillary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, which
thereby come to be by little and little
ob<U+017F>tructed, and the Circulation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniently
retarded; Whence 'tis
ea<U+017F>y to fore<U+017F>ee, that divers mi<U+017F>chiefs
mu<U+017F>t in time ari<U+017F>e. And on the other
<U+017F>ide, if the Blood be too thin, e<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if it be over much agitated too,
tis apt to make its way out of the
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, and produce Hemorrhagies, in
ca<U+017F>e it flow out of the Body, or other
bad Effects that u<U+017F>ually attend the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trava<U+017F>ation
of the Blood. Which Liquor,
when it is out of its proper Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,
in <U+017F>o warm a place as a Living Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Body, is very Subject to Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and thereby apt to produce
Impo<U+017F>thumes and <U+017F>everal mi<U+017F>chievous
Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>Now a Specifick Medicine may
remedy this faulty Con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49353:54"/>
Blood, by furni<U+017F>hing it with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles,
fitted by their figure, bulk,
motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to di<U+017F>able tho<U+017F>e peccant
ones that make the Blood gro<U+017F>s, or
el<U+017F>e to cut, or divide the Parts of the
Blood it <U+017F>elf, and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e them to
be more fluid: Or el<U+017F>e they may
produce in it <U+017F>uch Pores, as may, as
it were invite the <U+017F>ubtil Aetherial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that abounds in the Atmo<U+017F>phaere,
to in<U+017F>inuate it <U+017F>elf into the Ma<U+017F>s of
Blood, and rarifie it. And on the other
<U+017F>ide, when the Blood is too thin, as
not only <U+017F>ome Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, but <U+017F>ome
Medicines, e<U+017F>pecially Aloes, are
wont to make it; A Specifick Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
may reduce it to a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tence,
<hi>either,</hi> by furni<U+017F>hing it with
Corpu<U+017F>cles, apt to Combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
with the active ones, that did
too much Attenuate the Blood; <hi>Or,</hi>
by helping Nature to expel tho<U+017F>e
over-bu<U+017F>y Particles, by in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
Tran<U+017F>piration, or <U+017F>ome other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<U+017F>turbing
way.</p>
                  <p>3: There is yet another way, by
which a Specifick Remedy may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49353:54"/>
to rectifie the State of the Blood
And that is, by <U+017F>o working on
the Heart, as to make it advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly
regulate the Tran<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of
that Liquor through it.</p>
                  <p>That a Specifick Medicine may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
befriend this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Part, and con<U+017F>equently the
Heart, is granted by the Generality
of Phy<U+017F>itians, who are wont to reckon
up many Cordials, (of which yet I
fear, but few de<U+017F>erve that name.)
But, <U+017F>ince 'tis el<U+017F>ewhere in this Paper
<U+017F>hewn, that <U+017F>ome Medicines may
particularly re<U+017F>pect a determinate
Part of the Body, and con<U+017F>equently
the Heart; One may be allowed
to <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, that the Corpu<U+017F>cles of a
Specifick may <hi>either</hi> di<U+017F><U+017F>olve <U+017F>ome
Particles they meet with in the Heart,
by which that Noble <hi>Vi<U+017F>cus</hi> is by
Irritation, or otherwi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>turb'd in
the Regularity of its Dilatations, and
Contractions; <hi>Or,</hi> <U+017F>o Corroborate
the Fibres, or Motive Organs of it,
as to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e it to moderate the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the Blood that pa<U+017F><U+017F>es
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49353:55"/>
through it, in the mo<U+017F>t advantageous
way. And that the Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the
Heart, even when men have no <U+017F>en<U+017F>e
of it in the Part it <U+017F>elf, may be of
moment as to health and <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s,
will appear credible, if we reflect on
two thing. <hi>One,</hi> that a living Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Body is not a meer Aggregate of
Fle<U+017F>h, Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But an exqui<U+017F>itely
contriv'd, and very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Engine;
Who<U+017F>e Parts are ea<U+017F>ily <U+017F>et a work by
proper, though very Minute, Agents;
And may, by their Action upon one
another, perform far greater things,
than could be expected from the bare
Energy of the Agents, that fir<U+017F>t put
them into Motion. The <hi>Second,</hi>
(which <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es the fir<U+017F>t,) that the
Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the Heart, being,
though perhaps in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly, chang'd,
it may produce a notable Alteration
in the Motions of the Blood, and
its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age through the Heart, in
point of quantity, celerity, or
both.</p>
                  <p>How much this change in the
Circulation may in many Ca<U+017F>es con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49353:55"/>
to <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s or recovery may
partly appear by the Effects of vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or durable pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions of the mind.
As 'tis ob<U+017F>erv'd, that in a deep <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
which does in a manner <U+017F>traiten
the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of the Heart, the Blood
being too <U+017F>paringly di<U+017F>pens'd, the
enlivening Spirits are not generated
plentifully enough; And (be<U+017F>ides
other bad Effects of this State of the
Heart) the Blood is <U+017F>o di<U+017F>pirited, as
(in the<U+017F>e Parts of <hi>Europe</hi>) to di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e
the Body to the Scurvy, which does
either produce or irritate divers
other Maladies. We <U+017F>ee al<U+017F>o, that the
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>hame does oftentimes
<U+017F>uddenly alter the Motion of the Blood,
and make it <U+017F>well the little Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els
that lye under the <hi>Cuticula</hi> of the
Face, and <U+017F>ometimes other Parts;
as is very manife<U+017F>t in young Maids,
and other Per<U+017F>ons of a Delicate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
the white Part of who<U+017F>e
Faces in blu<U+017F>hing turns Red. The
like Effect I have <U+017F>een produc'd by a
great and <U+017F>udden Joy. And though
Grief, which is the oppo<U+017F>ite Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49353:56"/>
to it, has been u<U+017F>ually taken notice
of, as a thing that deads the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to meat; Yet <U+017F>o much does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon a well moderated Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion
of the Blood, that it has
been ob<U+017F>erv'd in divers Per<U+017F>ons, and
I have known an eminent In<U+017F>tance of
it, that great Joy has very much
le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd Hunger: Of which Effect
<hi>Mr. Des Cartes</hi> ingeniou<U+017F>ly attempts
to derive the cau<U+017F>e, from the vary'd
Dilatation and Motions of the Heart.
And it <U+017F>eems not ab<U+017F>ur'd to conceive,
that <U+017F>uch like Motions may be caus'd
by the Corpu<U+017F>cles of a Specifick
Medicine; Which by affecting the
Fibres of the Heart, after the like
manner that Joy is wont to do, may
produce in it <U+017F>uch friendly Dilatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Contractions, as are wont
to flow from the agreeable Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions.
In favour of which conjecture, I <U+017F>hall
take notice that a Lady of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
has complain'd to me,
that the <U+017F>mell of perfum'd Gloves
is wont to make the Blood fly to her
Face, and continue there for a great
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49353:56"/>
while, giving it <U+017F>uch a colour as if
<U+017F>hame, or joy had cover'd it with
blu<U+017F>hes. And the like <U+017F>he <U+017F>ays <U+017F>he

this being thus rectified, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorated

Specifick Medicine that produces

                  <p>Sometimes a Specifick Remedy may

                  <p>This I take to be one of the mo<U+017F>t

                  <p>This way of working of a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick

one or two of tho<U+017F>e formerly di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd

in <U+017F>ome things, as may be gather'd
by the <U+017F>equel of Â§ this di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e
Â§ <U+017F>ometimes when a certain kind of

lodg'd it <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>table part, as
the Liver, Spleen, Kidneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The

any <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible luctation or conflict,
which u<U+017F>ually happens when Acids
are mortify'd by Sapid Alkalies, be
<U+017F>o qualifi'd, as <hi>both</hi> to make Coaliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

little Concretions, which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the minute Parts of the
Acid, either in Bulk, Figure, Solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Stifne<U+017F>s, Motion, or in two or

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49353:58"/>
than the Acid was before 'twas
<U+017F>o corrected. Of this we may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed
with a notable Illu<U+017F>tration, by
what I have el<U+017F>ewhere taken notice
of about <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> it <U+017F>elf; for as
corro<U+017F>ive a <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> as that is, yet
by dige<U+017F>ting it, and perhaps, di<U+017F>til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it too, with an equal, or rather
double weight of Ardent Spirit, I
found the highly Acid Liquor would
be <U+017F>o chang'd, as not to retain any
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible corro<U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s; and exchange
its piercing Stink and great Acidity,
for a not only inoffen<U+017F>ive, but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant
Scent, and a grateful and po<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<U+017F>weeti<U+017F>h Ta<U+017F>t. Which brings
into my mind the practice of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ident
of the Famous <hi>London</hi> Colledge,
who (as him<U+017F>elf told me) was wont
to relieve a Patient of very great Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in Nephritick Torments, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her a good Do<U+017F>e of an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirit. (But this upon the by.) I
have el<U+017F>ewhere given an account of
the effects of Spirit of Wine, upon <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Acid <hi>Men<U+017F>truums,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I mingl'd and dige<U+017F>ted it; by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49353:58"/>
which it may appear, that it does not
work upon them uniformly, as they
are all of them Acids; but differingly
enough, according to the Nature and
Proportion of the Acid Corpu<U+017F>cles,
with which the vinous Spirits are
brought to be a<U+017F><U+017F>ociated.</p>
                  <p>And, to <U+017F>hew that this change
and contemperation of the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truum</hi>
by the Spirit of Wine, is
produc'd rather by a peculiar fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of the convening Corpu<U+017F>cles of
both, than by the contrariety or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tility,
that the vinous Spirit, which
<U+017F>ome Moderns will have to be an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly,
has to the <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> as an Acid;
I <U+017F>hall add, that pure Spirit of Wine
being mixt in a due proportion with
<hi>Highly rectifi'd</hi> Spirit of Urine;
which is reckon'd by Chymi<U+017F>ts among
volatile Alcalies, and of which a
drop or two is <U+017F>o fiery upon the
tongue; as to be ready to burn it,
or to bli<U+017F>ter it; this Vinous Spirit I
<U+017F>ay, will very much take off the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tick
penetrancy of the urinous one,
and compo<U+017F>e with it a Salt much
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49353:59"/>
more moderate than the Spirit was,
and which being <U+017F>ublim'd, or (which
is better but harder to be done,<note place="margin">N. B.</note>)
reduc'd into a Liquor, affords
a mixture of no little u<U+017F>e in fome Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

finely powder'd, and, when the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is <U+017F>ufficiently impregnated with
the Particles of the Gla<U+017F>s, be ab<U+017F>tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from it, there will emerge from
the Antimonial and Acetous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles,
a multitude of minute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions,
of which many grains may
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49353:59"/>
be given without ordinarily provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
either Vomits or Stools: Which
correction may hint, that 'tis not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary
that all Mortifications u<U+017F>efully
made by Medicines, <U+017F>hould be of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
<U+017F>ince here we <U+017F>ee, that Acids
them<U+017F>elves prove Correctors. And
perhaps it may be by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>uch kind
of Combinations, that <U+017F>ome Poi<U+017F>ons
(for I do not think they all work
one way, or peculiarly a<U+017F><U+017F>ault the
heart) may be <U+017F>ubdued. And I have
<U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, that it may as
probably be upon this account, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any that has been offer'd, that a
man <U+017F>tung with a Scorpion may be
cur'd, by cru<U+017F>hing the <hi>Animal</hi> that
<U+017F>tung him upon the hurt, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>crib'd
by many Phy<U+017F>icians, and as
an acquaintance of mine told me,
he try'd upon him<U+017F>elf (as another
Virtuo<U+017F>o did on a Souldier) with
good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s: And when I con<U+017F>ider
what a multitude and variety of
figures may fit the Corpu<U+017F>cles that
are endowed with them, to make
Coalitions very different from both
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49353:60"/>
the component parts; I can <U+017F>carce
think it very improbable, that in a
Patients Body there may be made,
between the Corpu<U+017F>cles of the Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
matter, and tho<U+017F>e of a Medicine,
<U+017F>uch u<U+017F>eful combinations as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
re<U+017F>ulting Concretions, innocent,
if not al<U+017F>o beneficial.</p>
                  <p>If I had leizure, and thought it
fit, I could ea<U+017F>ily add a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of in<U+017F>tances, about <U+017F>uch changes
of Colours, Odours, Ta<U+017F>ts, and other
qualities, as are produc'd by the
coalle<U+017F>cence of the <U+017F>mall parts of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Bodies, and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the
natural con<U+017F>equent of <U+017F>uch Coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
but having done that <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
in other Papers, it will be here
more proper to intimate to you, that
when a particle of peccant matter
comes to be a<U+017F><U+017F>ociated with one of a
Specifick Medicine, that combination
may alter it for the better, not only
by changing its bigne<U+017F>s and figure,
but al<U+017F>o by encrea<U+017F>ing, or le<U+017F><U+017F>ening
its <U+017F>tifne<U+017F>s, and its <U+017F>olidity, and giving
a new modification to its motion; as

a little attention to the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>equences
of the Coalitions of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
may ea<U+017F>ily induce you to grant.</p>
                  <p>And I <U+017F>hall add (as it were <hi>ex
abundanti</hi>) that the <U+017F>mall Concretions,
made by the union of <U+017F>ome Morbifick
with <U+017F>ome Medicinal Corpu<U+017F>cles, may
not only become innocent, but <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
al<U+017F>o beneficial, which may be
illu<U+017F>trated by what happens by a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
preparation, to common <U+017F>ubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate;
for though this be a <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance
<U+017F>o highly corro<U+017F>ive and mi<U+017F>chievous,
that a few grains of it may <U+017F>uffice to
kill a man; yet by making a Coale<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of it with le<U+017F>s than its weight
of Quick<U+017F>ilver, which is a Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ipid
as well as modorous, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<U+017F>ive
<U+017F>ublimate will be <U+017F>o alter'd
and tam'd, as to be turn'd into what
Chymi<U+017F>ts call, becau<U+017F>e 'tis freed from
<U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s, <hi>Mercurius Dulcis;</hi> which
if it be skilfully prepar'd and given,
though in the quantity of many
grains, is not only for the mo<U+017F>t part
an innocent thing, but a very good
Medicine, and that perhaps in more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49353:61"/>
ca<U+017F>es than Phy<U+017F>icians generally know
it to be good in.</p>
                  <p>The newly mention'd account
may hint to us a probable Argument,
to <U+017F>how, that, notwith<U+017F>tanding all
the dige<U+017F>tions and changes that a
Specifick Medicine may receive in
its way, it may prove a <U+017F>alutary one,
when it arrives at the Part it <U+017F>hould
relieve. For, tho' the Corpu<U+017F>cles of
the Medicine <U+017F>hould in their way to
the Part affected be con<U+017F>iderably
chang'd, yet 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that the<U+017F>e
alter'd Corpu<U+017F>cles may, by that very
alteration, be made Medicinal; <U+017F>ince
they may be qualifi'd, (even by tho<U+017F>e
changes) when they arrive at the
Part affected, to combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
<U+017F>trictly with <U+017F>ome Corpu<U+017F>cles,
whether Morbifick or others, that
they find already there; and may
with them compo<U+017F>e new Concretions
that may acquire a new Nature very
friendly to the Patient. Something A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogical
to this we may ob<U+017F>erve in
<hi>A<U+017F>paragus,</hi> which being eaten, afford
<U+017F>tore of Particles, that mixing with
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49353:61"/>
tho<U+017F>e they meet with in the Kidneys
or the Bladder, produce a new O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
very differing, both from that
of meer Urine, and from that of the
Plant it <U+017F>elf. And <U+017F>o if good Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
be taken at the Mouth, 'tis
known that arriving at the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
and Bladder, it will mingle
its minute Parts with tho<U+017F>e it meets
with there; whence will emerge
Corpu<U+017F>cles, that will impregnate the
Urine with a very differing Odour,
from that which belongs to either of
the Liquors, <U+017F>ince it oftentimes has a
fragrancy <U+017F>omewhat like the <U+017F>mell of
Violets.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude this Paper, 'tis
like it will be thought fit that I
<U+017F>hould take notice of a difficulty, that
I know maybe objected, if not again<U+017F>t
the pa<U+017F>t di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, yet again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of it to an<U+017F>wer the de<U+017F>ign I
propo<U+017F>e to my <U+017F>elf in writing it. For
it may be <U+017F>aid, that, whereas my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Explications <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e all
along, that the <hi>Specifick Remedies</hi> are
taken in at the Mouth; 'tis known
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49353:62"/>
that divers of the A<U+017F><U+017F>erters of <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks</hi>
reckon among them, <U+017F>ome that
are not by <U+017F>wallowing taken into the
Body, but only outwardly apply'd, or
perhaps do but barely touch it; as
may be ob<U+017F>erv'd in Amulets, Rings,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> On occa<U+017F>ion of this con<U+017F>iderable
difficulty, I have, if I mi<U+017F>remember
not, repre<U+017F>ented divers things in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tract. But however it may be
fit in this place, briefly to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
by way of An<U+017F>werto it. We
may then take notice, that the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with which many Phy<U+017F>icians
reject, and <U+017F>ome of them deride, <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Specificks,</hi> if I may <U+017F>o call them,
<U+017F>eems to be built upon the<U+017F>e two
things: The <hi>One,</hi> that the <hi>Medicine</hi>
cannot in part, as 'tis certain it do's
not in the Ma<U+017F>s, get into the Body;
and the <hi>other,</hi> that, in ca<U+017F>e a <hi>Specifick</hi>
<U+017F>hould have <U+017F>ome part of it <U+017F>ubtil
enough to gain admittance, that Part
mu<U+017F>t be too <U+017F>mall and incon<U+017F>iderable,
to be able to produce in the Body any
<U+017F>uch notable change, as is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to
the expul<U+017F>ion of Peccant Humours,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49353:62"/>
and the conquering of a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>As to the former of the<U+017F>e
Grounds, I largely enough <U+017F>how in
another Paper,<note n="*" place="margin">The Paper here mean't is the E<U+017F><U+017F>ay of the Poro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ity of bodys.</note> that

the Skin, and invade the Internal
Parts of the Body, and <U+017F>tay there
longer, and perhaps too operate
more, than the Phy<U+017F>ician de<U+017F>ired.
And when once the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the<U+017F>e
Externally apply'd Remedies have
gain'd admittance at the Pores of the
Skin, 'tis not very difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
how they may proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For underneath the <hi>Cuticula</hi> or
Scarf Skin, and clo<U+017F>e to it, there are
<U+017F>o great a multitude of Capillary Ve<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>els,
that you can <U+017F>carce thru<U+017F>t a
<U+017F>mall Pin into any Part, but that the
point of it will meet and tear <U+017F>ome of
the<U+017F>e little Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els; as will appear
by a <U+017F>mall drop of Blood, that will
be made to i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out at the new made
hole, as <U+017F>mall as it is. To which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance,
if it were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, I could
add divers others of the multitude and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49353:63"/>
<U+017F>preading of the Capillary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els,
that lie clo<U+017F>e beneath the Skin, and
for the mo<U+017F>t part carry Blood, tho'
<U+017F>ome of them may contain other
Juices, and di<U+017F>charge their recrements
by Sweat, or in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Tran<U+017F>pirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at the Cutaneous Outlets. Now
the<U+017F>e Capillary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, as <U+017F>mall as
they are, having their Cavities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
continu'd with tho<U+017F>e of le<U+017F>s
<U+017F>lender ones, and by their interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with tho<U+017F>e of the greater, which
are branches of the greate<U+017F>t of all; the
Corpu<U+017F>cles of the Medicine, once
got into the Capillary Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, may
have an ea<U+017F>y pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, by means of
the Liquors they contain, into
the<U+017F>e greater branches of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Veins, and <U+017F>o, by vertue of the
Circulation, come to be quickly
mingled with the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood,
and by it may be ea<U+017F>ily convey'd to
all the Parts of the Body: As it has

                  <p>As for the <U+017F>econd Ground on
which Specifick Remedies are reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that, tho' they could get entrance

have any con<U+017F>iderable effect upon an
Internal Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e: To remove this
difficulty, I <U+017F>hall briefly ob<U+017F>erve;</p>
                  <p>1. That the number of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<U+017F>cles,
that may pa<U+017F>s from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Medicine into the Body, may
be far greater, and therefore make
them more con<U+017F>iderable, than mo<U+017F>t
men are apt to think. This may be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49353:64"/>
rendred probable, by the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of Odorous, and con<U+017F>equent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sen<U+017F>ible, Expirations, that are
continually emitted for a very long
time together, by Ambergreece,
Musk, Civet, and much more by
skilfully made Compo<U+017F>itions of them.
And that al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ubtil <hi>Effluvia,</hi> even
without the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of Heat, may
quickly penetrate Membrans <U+017F>o plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
as to act on <U+017F>table Bodies
contain'd in them, I have intimated
a little above, and have experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
made appear to divers curious
men.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Corpu<U+017F>cles of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
may retain their Nature, and not
loo<U+017F>e their power of operating, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding
their being, as it were,
<U+017F>train'd through the Skin; as may be
argued from the Mercury, that we
not long <U+017F>ince mention'd to have been
found in the form of Quick-<U+017F>ilver, in
the Bodies of <U+017F>ome men, that had
been too frequently anonited with
Mercury, mix'd up with unctuous
things into an Ointment: By which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49353:65"/>
the Patient may be as long and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
Salivated, as if he had <U+017F>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
a <hi>Bolus</hi> or Pills with Mercury.</p>
                  <p>And <U+017F>o I have divers times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd,
as I doubt not but others have
oftner done, that a little <hi>Opium,</hi> mix'd
up with other Ingredients for Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ters,
did by outward application take
off the Acute Pains of inward Parts,
tho' moderately remote from the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter.</p>
                  <p>3. And that the Corpu<U+017F>cles of a
Specifick may on divers occa<U+017F>ions act
more powerfully, by getting in at the
Pores of the Skin, than if the Remedy
that afforded them had been taken in
at the Mouth: Becau<U+017F>e if it had, the
Particles might be divided, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
on other accounts, (as by dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
compo<U+017F>ition with tho<U+017F>e of the
Chyle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) much alter'd, by the
Ferment or the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
by their Filtration through the
Guts, and their long and winding pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
through them and the Lymphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,
before they arrive at the Heart,
to be mingled with the Blood;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49353:65"/>
whereas the Corpu<U+017F>cles of the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Specifick, pre<U+017F>ently after they are
pa<U+017F>t the Skin, get into the Capillary
Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of the Blood that lie under it,
and by their means are <U+017F>peedily mix'd
with the Circulating Ma<U+017F>s of that
Liquor, and <U+017F>o e<U+017F>cape the formerly
mention'd alterations, that other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
are <U+017F>ubject to before they are
admitted into the Ma<U+017F>s of Blood. By
which it may appear, that tho<U+017F>e Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians
are much mi<U+017F>taken, that think
a Topical Medicine can at be<U+017F>t relieve
but the Part 'tis apply'd to, becau<U+017F>e
its Corpu<U+017F>cles cannot be <U+017F>uppos'd to
reach beyond that Part of the Body,
that lies very near the Medicine they
i<U+017F><U+017F>ue from. But, tho' this rea<U+017F>oning
might be excu<U+017F>able enough, if not
allowable, before the Circulation of
the Blood was di<U+017F>cover'd, yet, now
'tis known how great an intercour<U+017F>e
that Liquor maintains between
di<U+017F>tant Parts of the Body, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable.</p>
                  <p>And on this occa<U+017F>ion, I <U+017F>hall add
an adverti<U+017F>ement, that I remember
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49353:66"/>
not I have met with in Authors;
which is, that Body's outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
may prove Specificks for <U+017F>ome
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es or Di<U+017F>tempers, that one
would not think them very good for,
by the bare knowledge of their effects
when taken in at the mouth. Thus
Camphire <U+017F>wallow'd, is, in the do<U+017F>e of
a very few grains, a great heater of
the Blood, and is in <U+017F>ome Country's,
perhaps not altogether without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
extoll'd by Phy<U+017F>icians in <U+017F>ome
kinds of ill condition'd Fevers: but
outwardly it is apply'd to take off
tho<U+017F>e Redne<U+017F><U+017F>es of the Face, that are
thought to proceed from Heat of
Blood; and 'tis us'd in Ointments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t
Burns. So Spirit of Wine, that
is <U+017F>o hot when drunk, is a very good
remedy to take out the fire, as they
<U+017F>peak, in Burns, e<U+017F>pecially if the Part
be early moi<U+017F>tend with it. Bread,
that is counted <U+017F>o moderate and well
temper'd and Aliment, when eaten, if
it be chew'd and outwardly apply'd,
hath con<U+017F>iderable vertues in <U+017F>everal
external affections. And I know an
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49353:66"/>
ancient and experienc'd Phy<U+017F>ician,
that u<U+017F>es to purge. Children, that
will not ea<U+017F>ily be brought to <U+017F>wallow
Medicines, by applying <U+017F>omething to
their Navels, that do's not offend
them by Colour, Smell, or Griping:
And this him<U+017F>elf more than once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s'd
to me, is but an ordinary Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that mo<U+017F>t men, and I among
others, have frequently taken unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
which he freely nam'd to me,
but which I have not yet had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to make Tryal of.</p>
                  <p>That what we have been <U+017F>aying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the po<U+017F><U+017F>ible efficacy of external
Specificks, may appear the le<U+017F>s im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
'twill be fit to take notice of
<U+017F>oms ob<U+017F>ervations, that comport very
well with our Doctrine. And though
the In<U+017F>tances to be brought will not
be all of them of remedies that de<U+017F>erve
the name of Specificks; yet, be<U+017F>ides
that <U+017F>ome of them may perhaps have
a Title to it, they will all conduce
to <U+017F>how, that Simples or Druggs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
apply'd, may have con<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
operations again<U+017F>t Internal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tempers
of the Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49353:67"/>
'Twere ea<U+017F>y for me to mention a
great many external Specificks out of
Phy<U+017F>icians Books. But I purpo<U+017F>ely
forbear it, becau<U+017F>e to <U+017F>peak freely, I
<U+017F>u<U+017F>pect that mo<U+017F>t of tho<U+017F>e Remedies,
though greatly extoll'd, have been
but little examin'd, by the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of them. And it may <U+017F>uffice for
my pre<U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>e to alledge a few
In<U+017F>tances that have been recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me, either by my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
or that of <U+017F>ome Friends.
Only there is one ob<U+017F>ervation that is
<U+017F>o <U+017F>olemnly and expre<U+017F>ly deliver'd by
<hi>Galen,</hi> upon his own knowledge, &amp; <U+017F>o
well back'd, by other eminent Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
that I <U+017F>hall let it lead the way.
This memorable <U+017F>tory, that is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Galen,</hi> is of a <hi>Piony</hi> Root,
which having been worn as ah <hi>Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>um</hi>
about a Boy, that had been Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptick
for divers months, kept him
from his Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e as long as he wore
it about him; but when by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
he ceas'd to do <U+017F>o, the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e
invaded him again, and yet by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Remedy again, he was the <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49353:67"/>
time freed from it, which <hi>Galen</hi>
ob<U+017F>erving, did for curio<U+017F>ity make the
Root be laid a<U+017F>ide, but finding the
<hi>Fits</hi> to return, he imploy'd it again
with the former <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>I liv'd in the <U+017F>ame hou<U+017F>e with a
learned and Judicious Per<U+017F>on, that
was <U+017F>ubject to be Paralytick, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
frequently tortur'd by violent
Cramps, was ordinarily and <U+017F>peedily
reliev'd by wearing or handling the
Tooth of a true Hippopotamus or
River-Hor<U+017F>e. And he affirm'd to me,
that upon leaving off, the u<U+017F>e of it,
for any con<U+017F>iderable time, either out
of curio<U+017F>ity, or to accommodate <U+017F>ome
Friend, the Fits would return with
violence upon him. I remember al<U+017F>o,
that having my <U+017F>elf been for <U+017F>ome
years frequently <U+017F>ubject to Cramps,
and complaining of it to a Phy<U+017F>ician
that had been a Traveller into cold
Country's, he told me, that he had
brought home with him <U+017F>ome Rings
made of the true Elks hoof, from a
place where the<U+017F>e <hi>Animals</hi> are u<U+017F>ually
imploy'd, and that with the<U+017F>e he had
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49353:68"/>
cur'd many of the Cramp, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
pre<U+017F>ented me one to make
tryal of, which I the more willingly
accepted, becau<U+017F>e he confe<U+017F>s'd to me,
that divers Rings that were <U+017F>old for
<U+017F>uch as his, and look'd like them,
were either counterfeit or of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy.
And tho' I did not find that
if the Cramp <U+017F>eiz'd me in the calf of
the Leg, the Ring would much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, yet when the Fits were but
moderate, and in other Parts, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the hands, I found my <U+017F>elf ea<U+017F>'d,
<U+017F>o often, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon, that I was at
fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>urpriz'd at it, and us'd to have
the remedy laid every night by my
Bed-<U+017F>ide, to have it ready when occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<U+017F>hould require. And that which
I thought <U+017F>ome what <U+017F>trange, was, that
<U+017F>everal times, when the Cramp <U+017F>eiz'd
my Foot or my Toes, the Pain was
quickly remov'd, tho' I apply'd the
Ring but to my Finger: which made
me much regret the lo<U+017F>s of it.</p>
                  <p>An eminent Phy<U+017F>ician <U+017F>peaking to
me one day of a Patient of his, that
was <U+017F>ubject to a nocturnal <hi>Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentia
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49353:68"/>
Urinae,</hi> that was very inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
as well as <U+017F>hameful; I told him
of an Empyrical Remedy, which is
mention'd in another Paper, who<U+017F>e
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s I neither would warrant, nor
did altogether di<U+017F>pair of, and which
at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>afe, tho' it <U+017F>hould not
prove effectual. This was only a <U+017F>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, (belonging to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Kingdom) that was to be worn
in a <U+017F>ine Sar<U+017F>anet Bag between the
Shift and the Skin, for which a good
while after the Phy<U+017F>ician gave me
great thanks, telling me, that he
was <U+017F>urpriz'd at the effect of it, and
that he ob<U+017F>erv'd that when the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
had worn it <U+017F>o long, that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the vertue began to decay, that
is in my <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, that the <hi>Effluvia</hi> were
almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>pent, the Patient found need
to take a fre<U+017F>h Remedy, to continue
the benefit <U+017F>he had found by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>I do not affirm or expect, that the
three fornam'd <hi>Appen<U+017F>a,</hi> nor the
other Remedy's I am about to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will always <U+017F>ucceed. And I

rea<U+017F>ons of the want of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

pre<U+017F>ent argument, it <U+017F>uffices that
they do <hi><U+017F>ometimes</hi> <U+017F>ucceed, <U+017F>ince that

told the Courteour, that if he could
animate her to <U+017F>uffer a Remedy he
would propo<U+017F>e, and would a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him
to procure it, he hop'd to remove
this Tumour without weakning her,
or putting her to pain. Soon after,
all Parties being agreed, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ired
conveniency procur'd, the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
was brought into a Room, where
there was yet in Bed the Body of a
man that had dy'd of a lingring Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e.
This mans Hand the Doctor
took, and laid it upon his Patients
Tumour, keeping it there till <U+017F>he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
complain'd or confe<U+017F>s'd that <U+017F>he
felt the coldne<U+017F>s of it penetrate to the
innermo<U+017F>t Parts of her Tumour. This
application was afterwards repeated
more than once, whil<U+017F>t the Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
without <U+017F>melling: And by
this cour<U+017F>e the Tumour was di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd,
and the Patient <U+017F>o reliev'd,
that her Father, by way of gratitude,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49353:70"/>
knowing how much the Phy<U+017F>ician
was a lover of curio<U+017F>ities, made him a
pre<U+017F>ent of that Clock.</p>
                  <p>The Learned Doctor a<U+017F>crib'd this
odd Remedy to <hi>Helmont,</hi> who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to be thank'd for having menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
and recommended a Medicine,
that was unlikely to be good, be<U+017F>ides
that it was not in u<U+017F>e. But the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it <U+017F>eems to me to have been
for the main very much ancienter
than our Age: <U+017F>ince there is mention
made of one very like it by <U+017F>o Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
an Author as <hi>Pliny;</hi> tho' <U+017F>ince his
time till <hi>Helmonts</hi> it hath been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
forgotten or disbeliev'd, <U+017F>ave
that one Phy<U+017F>ician (<hi>Franci<U+017F>cus Ulmus</hi>)
who, tho' no ill Ob<U+017F>erver, has not
had the Fortune to be Famous, takes
notice of a ca<U+017F>e very like that of our
Courtiers Daughter, affirming, that
by that one Remedy, after others
had been fruitle<U+017F>ly imploy'd, he
knew a Noble Virgin to have been
perfectly cur'd.</p>
                  <p>I was one Summer, to my great
<U+017F>urprize obnoxious to frequent Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49353:70"/>
at the No<U+017F>e; for which I <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
us'd one Remedy, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another, for the mo<U+017F>t part
with good, but not <U+017F>till with quick
<U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. But falling once unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into a Fit, who<U+017F>e violence <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
alarm'd me, I re<U+017F>olv'd to try
an unu<U+017F>ual Remedy: And having ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily
obtain'd of my Si<U+017F>ter, in who<U+017F>e
hou<U+017F>e this Accident happen'd, <U+017F>ome
true Mo<U+017F>s of a dead Mans Scull, which
had been <U+017F>ent her, by a great Per<U+017F>on,
for a pre<U+017F>ent out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which
Country, I found it le<U+017F>s rare and
more e<U+017F>teem'd than el<U+017F>ewhere: I was
going to imploy it after the u<U+017F>ual
manner, which is to put it up into
the Patients No<U+017F>trils, but before I
did it, I had the curio<U+017F>ity to try,
notwith<U+017F>tanding the briskne<U+017F>s of my
Haemorrhagy, whether the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
would produce its effect by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only held in my Hand, and
therefore covering a piece of the
Mo<U+017F>s with my Fi<U+017F>t, that the warmth
might a little actuate the Medicine, I
found, to the wonder of the by-<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49353:71"/>
that the Blood <U+017F>peedily <U+017F>topp'd,
nor thanks be to God have I been
troubled with a Haemorrhagy for
<U+017F>ome years from that very time. But
this is far le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trange than what was
affirm'd to have happen'd to one of
the Eminente<U+017F>t Members of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Society. This Learned Gentleman,
who was of a very Sanguine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
found him<U+017F>elf much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the u<U+017F>e of the Mo<U+017F>s of a human
Scull, [pieces of which I have <U+017F>een
<U+017F>ticking to the Roots of the Vegetable,
when it was genuine] which had <U+017F>o
<U+017F>trange an operation upon him, that
<U+017F>ometimes when he was let Blood, if
for curio<U+017F>ities <U+017F>ake he held a quantity
of this Mo<U+017F>s in his Hand, the Efflux
of the Blood would cea<U+017F>e, till he laid
it by again; which was not only
<U+017F>olemnly averr'd to me by him<U+017F>elf,
but confirm'd to me by his Ingenious
Phy<U+017F>ician, with both whom I had a
particular Acquaintance; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi<U+017F>e
I <U+017F>hould have thought <U+017F>carce
credible, unle<U+017F>s imagination, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
very <U+017F>trong in that Gentleman,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49353:71"/>
contributed to the <U+017F>trange effect of
the Remedy.</p>
                  <p>The hitherto mention'd External
Specificks are afforded by Vegetables
and Animals, which being Bodies of
a <U+017F>lighter Texture, may be <U+017F>uppos'd
to have their Parts more Effluviable:
And therefore I <U+017F>hall now add two or
three examples afforded by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Kingdom, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of
Bodies that never were living, and
which are for the mo<U+017F>t part very clo<U+017F>e
and compact, are generally thought
to have their Parts indi<U+017F>pos'd to
emit <hi>Effluvia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I knew a Per<U+017F>on of great Learning,
and by Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion a Phy<U+017F>ician, who
enjoy'd a Health good enough, <U+017F>ave
that u<U+017F>ually after a few hours <U+017F>leep,
he wak'd in the Night with great
Terrors, follow'd for a long time
with <U+017F>uch violent Palpitations of the
Heart, as were very trouble<U+017F>om, and
<U+017F>ometimes frightful to him. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this Di<U+017F>temper, he try'd all
that his Art <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ted to him, but
without <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, Whereupon he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49353:72"/>
of it to <U+017F>everal of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and mentioning it one day
among a Company of Merchants,
whereof <U+017F>ome frequented very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Country's; one of them told
him, he would ea<U+017F>ily relieve him, by
a Remedy that had been found effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
both upon him<U+017F>elf and others.
This he told him was, to take divers
flat and <U+017F>mooth Cornelian Stones,
<U+017F>uch as they bring from the <hi>Ea<U+017F>t-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
to cut Rings out of, and to <U+017F>ow
eight or ten of them to a piece of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
or Flannel, to be hung about his
Neck, <U+017F>o as that the Stones may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
touch the Skin over again<U+017F>t
the Heart, and the Mouth of the
Stomach. This Remedy the Phy<U+017F>ician
procur'd, and in no long time, found
the great benefit of it, in<U+017F>omuch that
he thought he might now <U+017F>ecurely
leave off the u<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e Stones,
which he did once or twice out of
curio<U+017F>ity, as well as for his ea<U+017F>e, but
finding the Di<U+017F>temper to return each
time, within very few Weeks after
he had laid a<U+017F>ide his Remedy, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olv'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49353:72"/>
to keep it always on, as he had
long <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully done, when he told
me the <U+017F>tory. And to convince me,
pre<U+017F>ented me with <U+017F>ome of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelians,
that he had, for fear of
wanting them, procur'd in greater
number than he needed at once. But
<U+017F>ince I have not yet had occa<U+017F>ion to
make tryal of them, I <U+017F>hall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the Remedy will always
<U+017F>ucceed, but only (which is enough
for my pre<U+017F>ent purpo<U+017F>e) that 'tis at
lea<U+017F>t po<U+017F><U+017F>ible that <U+017F>uch an External
Remedy may be very effectual.</p>
                  <p>I afterwards thought (which I
here note, to add to the probability
of what I have been relating) that
pos;<U+017F>ibly tho<U+017F>e that fir<U+017F>t made u<U+017F>e of
the foremention'd Remedy, may have
had a hint from what <hi>Galen</hi> <U+017F>aith of
the Ja<U+017F>per: Which Stone we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
to be various in point of Colour,
and I have <U+017F>een in the green mixtures
of Red almo<U+017F>t as deep as that of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelians.
Of this Stone <hi>Galen</hi> relates
that <U+017F>ome made Rings, in which
were graven a Dragon having Beams
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49353:73"/>
i<U+017F><U+017F>uing from him, and commended it
as very friendly to the Stomach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apply'd to the Mouth of it. And
tho' he omitted (and found he <U+017F>afely
might do it) the Sculpture, he yet
approves the Stones upon his own
frequent experience, applying them
almo<U+017F>t as our Merchant

affirm'd to our Author, that by wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the <hi>Principal</hi> ways, by which I

I am far from denying, that

of divers Phy<U+017F>icians and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ts,
that maintain that there are
Specifick Medicines, bccau<U+017F>e they
proceed upon Principles, (<U+017F>uch as
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tantial Forms, real Qualities, <hi>Ideas,</hi>

                  <p>As <hi>Fir<U+017F>t,</hi> that I did not pretend
that a Specifick Medicine, or Nature
by a Specifick, does commonly effect
the cure by <hi>one</hi> of the particular ways
that I propos'd, exclu<U+017F>ively to the
re<U+017F>t; <U+017F>ince I rather think that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49353:75"/>
two, and <U+017F>ometimes more, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
to the effect. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that I
propos'd to my <U+017F>elf, to explicate the
ways of working of Specifick Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
only in general. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
that I did not a<U+017F><U+017F>ert, that the ways
I pitch'd upon were the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
ones, by which the Medicine
<hi>does</hi> act, but only propounded them,
as ways by which it <hi>may</hi> act: So that
without being Dogmatical, I offer
you my Explications, but as <hi>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,</hi>
and perhaps not <hi>improbable;</hi> and that
may <U+017F>uffice for the occa<U+017F>ion and <U+017F>cope
of this Letter; in which I pre<U+017F>ume,
you remember I aim'd but at <U+017F>hewing

what has been <U+017F>aid about

not improper ri<U+017F>e to invite you, and

Scope.</p>
                  <p>This <U+017F>ort of <U+017F>imple, or but lightly
Compounded, Remedies, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to prefer before tho<U+017F>e pompous
compo<U+017F>itions, wherein men <U+017F>eem to
have hop'd to <U+017F>urmount di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es by
the multitude of the Ingredients,
upon the following Rea<U+017F>ons. In all
which I de<U+017F>ire the advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>crib'd
to <U+017F>imple Medicines, above
others may be under<U+017F>tood, not in an
ab<U+017F>olute and indefinite <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, but, as
they <U+017F>peak <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> which I
here give you notice of once for
all</p>
                  <p>And the fir<U+017F>t advantage that I <U+017F>hall
mention, is, That it is much le<U+017F>s
difficult, to fore<U+017F>ee the operation of a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49353:78"/>
<U+017F>imple, than of a very compounded
Medicine. So that Phy<U+017F>icians may
proceed more <U+017F>ecurely, in imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the former than the latter <U+017F>ort
of Remedies. And indeed, if I do
not greatly mi<U+017F>take, we often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ume
too much of our own Abilities
when we believe that we know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, what the Qualities and
Effects of a Mixture of many Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
of differing Natures, will be:
Since many Bodies, by Compo<U+017F>ition,
and the change of Texture con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
thereupon, do receive great
and unexpected Alterations in their
Qualities. Several manife<U+017F>t In<U+017F>tances
of this Truth may be met with in
our Hi<U+017F>tory of Colours; In divers
of who<U+017F>e Experiments, the Colour
produc'd upon the Mixture of Bodies,
is quite different from that of any
of the Ingredients. As, when a blew
Solution of Copper made in Spirit
of Urine, does with Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
which is al<U+017F>o blew, produce a
fair Green. And even <U+017F>ince I began
to write this Section, a Tryal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49353:79"/>
made has afforded me a new
In<U+017F>tance of the <U+017F>ame import.</p>
                  <p>For having put together <U+017F>ome
Tincture of Iron, made with good
Spirit of Vinegar, and a Volatile
Tincture of Sulphur, (which I el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<U+017F>how how to make) from a
Confu<U+017F>ion of the<U+017F>e two very red Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
there emerg'd in a trice, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dark and almo<U+017F>t Inky Mixture,
that retain'd nothing at all of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>The like notable changes I have
<U+017F>everal times produc'd by Mixtures,
in divers other Qualities of Bodies
than their Colours, as in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
Ta<U+017F>ts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why <U+017F>uch
Alterations may not be al<U+017F>o effected
by Composition, in <U+017F>ome of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal
Qualities of Bodies, I do not
yet <U+017F>ee. Quick-<U+017F>ilver it <U+017F>elf inwardly
taken, does u<U+017F>ually cau<U+017F>e, either no
manife<U+017F>t evacuation, or one that is
made at the mouth: But if it be
di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd in Spirit of Niter, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
with Sea-Salt, this white
Precipitate being edulcorated, if it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49353:79"/>
be warily given in a ju<U+017F>t Do<U+017F>e,
doth (as far as I can yet learn) <U+017F>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fail of working, and yet <U+017F>eldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
work by Salivation, but by
Siege. On the other <U+017F>ide Gla<U+017F>s of
Antimony (made <hi>per <U+017F>e</hi>) whereof a
very few Grains given in <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance,
are wont to work violently upwards
and downwards, being di<U+017F><U+017F>olved in
Spirit of Vinegar, (which is not
ea<U+017F>ily and quickly done) will not
u<U+017F>ually either Vomit or Purge, <hi>tho</hi>
the <hi>Men<U+017F>truum</hi> be drawn from it, and
tho it be given in a larger Do<U+017F>e,
than that of the uncompounded Gla<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>And tho if Crude Antimony be
flux'd with Niter and Tartar, as in
the ordinary way of making <hi>Crocus
Metallorum,</hi> there is produc'd, as
is vulgarly known, a Medicine <U+017F>o
Emetick and Cathartick, that an
Ounce or le<U+017F>s of the Wine wherein
it has been infus'd, without <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly
loo<U+017F>ing its weight, is wont to work
<U+017F>trongly enough both upwards and
downwards: <hi>Yet</hi> I have known <U+017F>ome
that would without <U+017F>cruple, take
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49353:80"/>
<U+017F>everal Grains of Crude Antimony
in <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, and one particularly
that continued the u<U+017F>e of it long,
without being vomited or purg'd by
it. And Tryals purpo<U+017F>ely made have
inform'd me, that if, in<U+017F>tead of
Salt-Peter and Tartar, Antimony be
prepar'd with well dry'd Sea-Salt,
and a little Salt of Tartar, tho both,
the<U+017F>e amount not to above half the
weight of the Niter and Tartar vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
us'd, yet the Antimony well
flux'd with the<U+017F>e (for about an hour)
is thereby <U+017F>o alter'd and corrected,
that it affords an u<U+017F>eful Medicine, of
which one may give from 12 or 15
Grains to half a Dram, or more in
<U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance, without ordinarily work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either by Vomit or Siege, but
u<U+017F>ually by Sweat, and <U+017F>ometimes by
Urine. Whence we may gather,
that Antimony may be either made
a more dangerous, or a more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Medicine, than of it <U+017F>elf it is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Ingredients 'tis a<U+017F><U+017F>oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
with, tho the<U+017F>e be in them<U+017F>elves
Innocent, and perhaps of kin to one
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49353:80"/>
another. And even Chymi<U+017F>ts, as
well as other pre<U+017F>cribers of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
may be found, tho le<U+017F>s fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
to add to a Simple, <U+017F>uch
things as rather deprave, than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it. As one of their great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
(a happy Practitioner) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
that Flower of Sulphur, by
being <U+017F>ublim'd, (as by many it is)
from Calcin'd Vitriol, and one or
two other things, under pretence of
purifying and <U+017F>ubtillizing it, does
really acquire a hurtful Corro<U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s.
And if I had here the Leizure, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances
enough might be brought to
<U+017F>how, that Chymi<U+017F>ts <U+017F>ometimes mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takingly
produce by their additions
to a Medicine, other Qualities, if
not al<U+017F>o wor<U+017F>e, than they de<U+017F>ign'd or
expected.</p>

                  <p>ANother Advantage of Simpler
Medicines, is, that <hi>caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi>
they are more <U+017F>afe than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
ones, e<U+017F>pecially if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
be valetudinary per<U+017F>ons. 'Tis
too much the cu<U+017F>tom, both of many
Herbari<U+017F>ts, and <U+017F>everal other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
on the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> to give
us rather <hi>Encomiums</hi> than impartial
Accounts of the Simples they treat
of; enumerating and magnifying all
the vertues they have, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more than they have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking notice of their ill Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
upon who<U+017F>e account neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s
they may be inconvenient, if
not hurtful and dangerous, to <U+017F>ome
Con<U+017F>titutions, and in divers Ca<U+017F>es.
We know that divers Perfumes, as
Musk and Amber, tho very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and refre<U+017F>hing to mo<U+017F>t Mens Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
are yet very hurtful to many
Women, and e<U+017F>pecially to tho<U+017F>e that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49353:81"/>
are Hy<U+017F>terical. And I have known
the <U+017F>mell of Musk very much di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect
an eminent Per<U+017F>on, though
otherwi<U+017F>e of a robu<U+017F>t Con<U+017F>titution.
I have al<U+017F>o known <U+017F>everal Per<U+017F>ons,
not all of them of the <U+017F>ame Sex,
very much offended by the <U+017F>mell of
Ro<U+017F>es, which yet is very moderate, as
well as to mo<U+017F>t Per<U+017F>ons, whether Men
or Women, very grateful. I know a
very great Per<U+017F>on to whom Honey,
whether inwardly taken, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
apply'd, is almo<U+017F>t as hurtful
as Poy<U+017F>on, having <U+017F>everal times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<U+017F>trange and frightful Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
even when the Patient knew
not that any Honey had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
and con<U+017F>equently could not
be thus oddly di<U+017F>temper'd by the
force of Imagination. I think I have
el<U+017F>ewhere taken notice of the harm,
that both I and others, <U+017F>ubject to
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Eyes, have receiv'd,
even by the moderate u<U+017F>e of Par<U+017F>ley.</p>
                  <p>On this occa<U+017F>ion I <U+017F>hall add what
occurr'd to me long after I had dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
what I <U+017F>aid of Par<U+017F>ley, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49353:82"/>
Worm-wood, tho for many u<U+017F>es, an
excellent Plant, has been found by
many <U+017F>o apt to di<U+017F>affect the head,
and <U+017F>o unfriendly to the Eyes, that
I have for <U+017F>ome years forborn it my
<U+017F>elf for fear of the head-ach, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd
others of it that are <U+017F>ubject
to weak Eyes. But I know a very
Learned Man, who<U+017F>e Elegant Pen
has made him de<U+017F>ervedly be taken
notice of by many, who, tho he have
naturally very good Eyes, found
upon an Ob<U+017F>tinate Tryal, that his
Curio<U+017F>ity <U+017F>educed him to make of
the plentiful u<U+017F>e of Worm-wood-Wine
and Beer, that within le<U+017F>s
than three Weeks, his <U+017F>ight was by
degrees brought to be <U+017F>o weak, that
he could not read a Gazet without
Spectacles; but by totally leaving off
Worm-wood, he quickly recover'd
the vigour of his <U+017F>ight, without the
u<U+017F>e of any of the helps that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
which is Phy<U+017F>ick, would
have plentifully <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ted to him.
this Relation I had from him<U+017F>elf
<U+017F>oon after the thing happen'd, on
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49353:82"/>
occa<U+017F>ion of what I told him about
Par<U+017F>ley, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And to <U+017F>peak more generally, I
doubt not, but if Men were not <U+017F>o
prepo<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd with the Prai<U+017F>es that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
give to Simples, that they
overlook the Inconveniencies they
may on divers occa<U+017F>ions produce,
we <U+017F>hould find in many Medicines
bad Qualities, that are not yet
taken notice of. And I have more
than once hit, but too well, in
the Progno<U+017F>ticks I made of the
Hurt, <U+017F>ome Patients would receive
by the u<U+017F>e of applauded Medicines,
prescribe them, even by con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Learn'd Men, when upon
their Authority my warnings were
neglected, and the u<U+017F>e of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
unhappily per<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I once <U+017F>aw in the hands of
a learned and curious Traveller into
the Ea<U+017F>tern Parts of the World, an
Arabick Manu<U+017F>cript about the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
MÃ¨dica,</hi> which made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
the lo<U+017F>s of the mo<U+017F>t part
of the little skill I once had in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49353:83"/>
that Language. For be<U+017F>ides that
it was written in a delicate
hand, and the Letters in fit Places,
curiou<U+017F>ly adorn'd with Gold and
Azure, the Method <U+017F>eem'd to be more
accurate than any thing I had <U+017F>een
on that Subject. And that which
pleas'd me not a little, was, that
the Author had been <U+017F>o wary, that
after the columns wherein he taught,
be<U+017F>ides many other things, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
Do<U+017F>es, &amp;c. of every Drug he
treated of, he had a di<U+017F>tinct column
for the bad Qualities of it, and the
con<U+017F>titutions and Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es wherein
the u<U+017F>e of it may be dangerous or
inconvenient. I think it therefore
not unrea<U+017F>onable to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect, that,
where a great many Ingredients are
blended into one Medicine, one or
other of them may have other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
be<U+017F>ides that de<U+017F>ign'd by the
Phy<U+017F>ician; it may awaken <U+017F>ome
<U+017F>leeping Ferment, and, if not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a new Di<U+017F>temper, may excite
and actuate <U+017F>ome other ho<U+017F>tile mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that lay quiet in the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49353:83"/>
and perhaps would have been
little by little <U+017F>ubdu'd by nature, if
it had not been un<U+017F>ea<U+017F>onably rous'd
and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted by <U+017F>ome Ingredient,
that perhaps was needle<U+017F>ly put into
the Medicine. I have had <U+017F>o many
unwelcome Proofs of this in my <U+017F>elf,
that it engages me to be the more
careful to caution others again<U+017F>t the
like Inconvenience.</p>

his Stomach; when there are
many things heap'd together in a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49353:84"/>
moderate Do<U+017F>e of one compounded
Medicine, the<U+017F>e Ingredients that are
either <U+017F>uperfluous, or at lea<U+017F>t are
le<U+017F>s efficacious, mu<U+017F>t nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily take
up a con<U+017F>iderable part of that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Do<U+017F>e, and con<U+017F>equently leave
much the le<U+017F>s of the more appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or u<U+017F>eful Ingredients.</p>
                  <p>To <U+017F>ay, that all the Ingredients
that are thru<U+017F>t into a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition,
are proper and conduce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <U+017F>ame purpo<U+017F>e, I doubt is not
always true. And however is not
a <U+017F>ufficient An<U+017F>wer, <U+017F>ince it does not
avoid the Inconvenience I have been
objecting.</p>
                  <p>If a Baker, being to make the
be<U+017F>t Bread he can, e<U+017F>pecially for a
Per<U+017F>on of a weak Stomach, <U+017F>hould
to Wheaten Flower add the Meal of
Rye, of Barley, and of Oats; tho'
all the<U+017F>e Ingredients be good and
nouri<U+017F>hing, and each of them is by
many us'd to make Bread, yet none
will take him for a skilful Baker,
and few would prefer this compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Bread, to that more <U+017F>imple one
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49353:84"/>
made of Wheat alone. And <U+017F>o to
make good Gun-Powder a skilful
man would not to Salt-Peter, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tone,
and Charcole add Wax, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>in,
and Camphire, though the<U+017F>e be
very inflammable Sub<U+017F>tances as well
as Sulphur. And thus if one would
make an <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> whereof but one
<U+017F>mall cup were to be given for the
quick recovery of fainting Per<U+017F>ons,
he would not with Spirit of Wine,
or good Brandy, mix Mead or Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and <U+017F>trong Bear or Ale, tho'
each of the<U+017F>e be it <U+017F>elf a Spirituous
Liquor.</p>
                  <p>Gum Arabick (whereof I prefer that
which is tran<U+017F>parent and colourle<U+017F>s)
is pre<U+017F>crib'd in <U+017F>everal compo<U+017F>itions,
as a Drug proper to mitigate the
<U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of Urine. But by the
quantity of the other Ingredients that
'tis mix'd and clog'd with, no more
than a <U+017F>mall proportion of it u<U+017F>ually
comes to be given in one Do<U+017F>e. But
when I have had the Curio<U+017F>ity,
leaving out all the other things, to
give about a dram, or perhaps more
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49353:85"/>
of it at one time, reduc'd by long
Pounding (for the be<U+017F>t is very tough)
to fine Powder, in a large draught of
<U+017F>mall Ale or Beer, or <U+017F>ome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Vehicle, I found very con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Effects of it. And I remember
that a Gentleman of great note, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bid me farewel, becau<U+017F>e of a long
and troublesome Journey, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to Mineral Waters, which he
intended to drink for many weeks,
to ea<U+017F>e him of a very painful <U+017F>harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of Urine; I that knew it was
not venereal nor from the Stone of
the Bladder (for when tho<U+017F>e Cau<U+017F>es of
the Strangury, the Medicine is not
near <U+017F>o powerful) I de<U+017F>ir'd him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he went to make u<U+017F>e of this
Powder, once, or (if there <U+017F>hould be
need) twice a day. Which when
he had done, it <U+017F>o reliev'd, him that he
thought him<U+017F>elf quite cur'd, and
forbore his intended Journey not
only that Year, but the next. For
the Chin-cough, as they call it in
Children, who<U+017F>e odd Symptoms do
u<U+017F>ually fright the Parents and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49353:85"/>
and oftentimes fru<U+017F>trate the
Endeavours of Phy<U+017F>icians, skilful in
curing other Coughs, I have not
known any magi<U+017F>terial compo<U+017F>ition
<U+017F>o effectual, as the <U+017F>imple Juice of
Pulegium (by many call'd Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royal)
<U+017F>weetn'd a little with SugarCandy,
and given long enough from
time to time, in the quantity of a
Childs Spoonful. (This Plant may
be al<U+017F>o made to afford a Syrup, that
will keep, and is u<U+017F>eful in Coughs,
but which I doubt, is not <U+017F>o effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
as the Simple Juice.) There
are many and obvious experiments
of the great efficay of <U+017F>o <U+017F>imple a
Remedy as A<U+017F><U+017F>es Milk; (which yet
in <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>es, I think inferiour to
Goats Milk,) if it be given in a <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
quantity, and for a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
time, there are al<U+017F>o many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances
of dangerous and <U+017F>tubborn
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, that have been cur'd even
by Common Cows Milk, when it
has been very plentifully taken, and
for a long continuance of time, and
perhaps it is no le<U+017F>s remarkable, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49353:86"/>
in a far le<U+017F>s time now and then, not
extending to very many daies,
Fluxes, as <hi>Dyarrhaeas,</hi> and tho more
<U+017F>eldom even Dy<U+017F>enterical ones, are
happily and ea<U+017F>ily cur'd, as I have
<U+017F>ometimes known by the bare u<U+017F>e
of <U+017F>o <U+017F>light a Remedy as Milk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
whil<U+017F>t it is gently boyling, an

by little put, till at la<U+017F>t there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
but as much Liquor as the
Milk alone amounted to at fir<U+017F>t.
This <U+017F>imple Alimentous Medicine
being liberally taken (for it <U+017F>hould
be us'd in<U+017F>tead of all other Drinks
whil<U+017F>t the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e continues) has
been very frequently found to cure
Fluxes, not all of one <U+017F>ort, in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
it <U+017F>elf, where that kind of Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea<U+017F>e
is Endemical. And, <hi>tho</hi> I have
formerly in another Paper recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the u<U+017F>e of <hi>Paronychia foliis

Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e the <hi>Kings-Evil, yet</hi> I
pre<U+017F>ume you will allow me, by the
mention of a Tryal that was <U+017F>ince
made with it, to give a notable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49353:86"/>
of the Utility of giving
an Alterative Simple, if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
in con<U+017F>iderable quantity. A
Phy<U+017F>ician that I knew, was <U+017F>ent for
to a Scrophulous Patient, in who<U+017F>e
Throat there was a Tumour, <U+017F>o big
and <U+017F>o unluckily <U+017F>eated, that much
compre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the <hi>A<U+017F>ophagus</hi> it rendr'd
Deglutition exceeding difficult: So
that being likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>o hard and <U+017F>tub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
that tho the Phy<U+017F>ician was
al<U+017F>o a famous Chyrurgion, he could
neither di<U+017F>cu<U+017F>s it, or bring it to
Suppuration; The Patient, tho rich,
was in imminent danger of being
<U+017F>tarv'd. In this Strait the Phy<U+017F>ician
remembring the Character I had
given of <hi>Paronychia,</hi> or <hi>Whitlom</hi>
Gra<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ent about the Country to
to get all that could be procur'd: And
at fir<U+017F>t gave a little of it in form of
Infu<U+017F>ion, in <U+017F>uch liquid Aliments as
the Patient was able, with much
ado, little by little to get down.
And having by this means, after
<U+017F>ome time, made the Deglutition
le<U+017F>s difficult, he gave the Remedy
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49353:87"/>
more and more plentifully, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bue
the whole ma<U+017F>s of Blood and
Juices of the Body with the Vertue
of the Herb, whereby the Tumour
was at length re<U+017F>olv'd, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<U+017F>ecur'd, <U+017F>o much to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>icians
Reputation as well as Profit,
that, as he <U+017F>aid, he thought Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
oblig'd him to give me a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<U+017F>tantial
Account of his Succe<U+017F>s;
as he very civilly did in a long Letter
whereof I have given you the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tance.</p>
                  <p>And tho I might here entertain
you with the Vertues of <U+017F>ome other
Simple Remedies, plentifully given,
yet for brevity <U+017F>ake I <U+017F>hall rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve
in general, That I doubt not
but <U+017F>everal Simple Medicines (I
<U+017F>peak of alterative not evacuating
ones, would be found far more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
than they are commonly
thought, if they were given in a
much larger Do<U+017F>e, and continued
for a competent time. And proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<U+017F>o many Phy<U+017F>icians (e<U+017F>pecially
of the Old School,) would not be <U+017F>o
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49353:87"/>
forward to reject either Specifick or
<U+017F>imple Remedies, as having found
<U+017F>ome of them not to an<U+017F>wer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation;
if they would allow them
as fair a Tryal, as they give to their
own Pre<U+017F>criptions, <U+017F>uch as the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeats
of the Shops, the Spaw, or
Tunbridge Waters, the Decoctions
of <hi>Guajacum,</hi> &amp;c. which they often
give with divers intermediate helps
for a Month or <U+017F>ix Weeks, and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for two Months together,
without expecting that in a few
weeks, much le<U+017F>s in a very few
days, they <U+017F>hould perform the
cure.</p>

                  <p>THE Fourth thing that may
recommend the u<U+017F>e of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Medicines, is, That <hi>caeteris
paribus</hi> they are more ea<U+017F>y to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
then Compounded ones. This
A<U+017F><U+017F>ertion needs little proof. And
where <U+017F>everal Simples are requir'd,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49353:88"/>
one or more of them may oftentimes
be difficult to be got; and all of them
will <U+017F>till be trouble<U+017F>ome to be fetcht,
and to be made up into a Compo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How u<U+017F>eful the knowledge of
Parable Remedys may be, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to <U+017F>how in a di<U+017F>tinct Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
and therefore <U+017F>hall not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
of it here, but only add this
one Ob<U+017F>ervation, that <U+017F>ome Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
are <U+017F>o parable, that without
re<U+017F>orting for them to Apothecarys
<U+017F>hops (which are not every where
at hand, nor always furni<U+017F>hed with
them) we may find them in tho<U+017F>e
of other Trades-men. Thus among
Ma<U+017F>ons and Bricklayers we mo<U+017F>t
commonly meet with Quicklime;
who<U+017F>e bare Infu<U+017F>ion in common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
[about a pound of the former,
as 'tis more or le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trong, to about
three or four Quarts of the latter,]
is of it <U+017F>elf a good Medicine in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Ca<U+017F>es, and as Experience has
per<U+017F>waded me, may be made the
<hi>Ba<U+017F>is</hi> of <U+017F>everal good Remedys, both
Inward and Outward. Among the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49353:88"/>
latter of which may be reckon'd an
Oyntment, that I u<U+017F>ually kept by me
for Burns, and made only by beating
up <U+017F>trong Lime-Water with as much
good Lin-<U+017F>eed Oyl, as could be
made throughly to incorporate with
it into a very white Unguent.</p>
                  <p>And I <U+017F>hall add concerning Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eed
Oyl, (<U+017F>ince I have mention'd
it) which is to be had in the <U+017F>hops
of Varni<U+017F>hers and Painters; that
of it <U+017F>elf, being exhibited in a
large Do<U+017F>e, as of <U+017F>everal Ounces
at a time, I have known it an<U+017F>wer
the Commendations given it by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Phy<U+017F>icians, for breaking of
Pleuritical <hi>Empyemas</hi> Simple Oyl of
Turpentine al<U+017F>o, that may be u<U+017F>ual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had in the <U+017F>hops of the <U+017F>ame
Trades-men, is in reality a noble
Remedy in divers Affections, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Inward, in which Chymi<U+017F>ts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it, but Outward too. And
I have had great thanks, both from
Phy<U+017F>icians and Chyrugeons, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
the u<U+017F>e of it to them in
Wounds, and particularly, where
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49353:89"/>
one would expect little from it in
the <U+017F>tanching of Blood, if it be <U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onably
apply'd very hot to the
wounded Parts, where it al<U+017F>o much
promotes a good Dige<U+017F>tion. And I
am confirm'd in the good Opinion
I have long had of this Oyl, by the
Information that's given me, That
very experienced Chyrurgeon has
lately been <U+017F>o charitable, as to publi<U+017F>h
a little Book, con<U+017F>iderable for the
u<U+017F>eful Ob<U+017F>ervations it contains, of
notable Cures done by him in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical
Ca<U+017F>es, chiefly with Oyl of
Turpentine. And I <U+017F>hall add, that
a Chyrurgeon to a great Monarch,
and one of the skilfulle<U+017F>t men I ever
met with of his Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, confe<U+017F>s'd
to me, that in an admir'd Cure that
he had then lately done of a de<U+017F>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Gangrene, in an eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on,
very aged and almo<U+017F>t bed-rid,
the Medicine he a<U+017F>crib'd mo<U+017F>t to,
was the Oyl we were <U+017F>peaking of.
And, becau<U+017F>e both he and others
make much and good u<U+017F>e of Spirit
of Wine in Gangrens, which yet is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49353:89"/>
thought to be unmingleable with
Oyl of Turpentine, becau<U+017F>e if it be
<U+017F>haken with it, it will quickly <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
again from it; I thought it
might do Practitioners <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ervice,
to make for them a Mixture of Oyl
of Turpentine and Spirit of Wine,
that might probably be more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant
than the former, and le<U+017F>s fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
than the latter, which of it
<U+017F>elf does not <U+017F>tay long enough upon
the Parts 'tis apply'd to. Which
Mixture I ea<U+017F>ily made, by dige<U+017F>ting
for a while, and <U+017F>trongly <U+017F>haking
from time to time, about equal
parts by gue<U+017F>s of good Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
and throughly dephlegm'd
Spirit of Wine, till this Liquor, by
imbibing or di<U+017F><U+017F>olving great <U+017F>tore
of the Oleaginous Parts, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a Yellow Colour, for which
rea<U+017F>on I call it the Tincture of Oyl
of Turpentine.</p>
                  <p>And, <U+017F>ince my <U+017F>ubject has led me
into the <U+017F>hops of Colour-<U+017F>ellers, I
will before I leave them, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of one Simple that is wont to
be found there, which if it were
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49353:90"/>
not very offen<U+017F>ive to the Ta<U+017F>t, and
<U+017F>omewhat di<U+017F>agreeable to the <U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
would be perhaps preferable
for its Antinephritick Vertue, to
the mo<U+017F>t pompous Compo<U+017F>itions
of the <U+017F>hops, and <U+017F>ome of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<hi>Arcana</hi> of the (vulgar) Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F>ts.
I procur'd it, not without
<U+017F>ome difficulty, from a Spagyri<U+017F>t,
very well vers'd in the School of
<hi>Paracel<U+017F>us</hi> and <hi>Helmont;</hi> who, tho
a <U+017F>paring Commender of Remedyes,
extoll'd this as the be<U+017F>t he had ever
met with, to cure the Stone where
it was not too big to pa<U+017F>s, and to
prevent the increa<U+017F>e of it where it
was. I have known it us'd in
Cly<U+017F>ters, with very good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s in
a Fit of that Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. But Inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I had no occa<U+017F>ion to try it but
upon my <U+017F>elf. And judging it inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
enough, (as indeed I found
it rather Anodyne than Driving,
I took it now and then, mix'd with
Oyl of <U+017F>weet Almonds chiefly to allay
the Ta<U+017F>t, for otherwi<U+017F>e I had long
found that alone, in<U+017F>ufficient) as a
Pre<U+017F>ervative from Grave. And,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49353:90"/>
thanks be to God, I divers times
thought it more manife<U+017F>tly effectual
to that purpo<U+017F>e, by le<U+017F><U+017F>ening either
the bulk of the Grains, or the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the Sand, or both, than any
of the Remedyes I had taken for
prevention in <U+017F>everal years before.
And yet I <U+017F>carce took a quarter of
the Do<U+017F>e, pre<U+017F>crib'd by the Spagyri<U+017F>t
that communicated the Medicine
to me; which in <U+017F>hort is (for I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ume
you would gladly know it)
to take from time to time, by it <U+017F>elf
or in <U+017F>ome convenient Vehicle two
or three ounces of the expre<U+017F>s'd Oyl
of Walnuts, which, if the great
<U+017F>talene<U+017F>s of it he requires be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary,

of Artificers, becau<U+017F>e he would have
it at lea<U+017F>t a year old, and judg'd it
the elder the better.</p>
                  <p>Before I quite leave the Shops of
Trades-Men, I <U+017F>hall take notice of
one Medicine more, that <U+017F>eems to
have been fir<U+017F>t lodg'd there, and from
thence tran<U+017F>lated into the Shops of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49353:91"/>
Apothecaries. The Medicine I mean
is Ca<U+017F>tile or el<U+017F>e Venetian Soap, (for
either is often imploy'd in <U+017F>tead of
the other) which being a Body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with Alcali<U+017F>ite Salts and
Oleaginous Parts well combin'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
me to make <U+017F>ome Experiments
with it, as a Sub<U+017F>tance that may be
applicable to good u<U+017F>es, not only
Mechanical but Medical. Of <U+017F>ome of
tho former <U+017F>ort I el<U+017F>ewhere make
mention. And as to its Medicinal
vertues, I take notice in another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of its Efficacy again<U+017F>t the Jaundi<U+017F>e;
for which I have <U+017F>ince been inform'd,
that, as nau<U+017F>eous a Medicine as it is,
'tis in great reque<U+017F>t among <U+017F>ome
Skilful Men in <hi>Holland.</hi> And <U+017F>ome
fre<U+017F>h, but not <U+017F>ufficient, experience
has recommended it to me again<U+017F>t
the Stone. But that vertue of it
which I as yet mo<U+017F>t prize it for, and
now intend to communicate to you,
you will be<U+017F>t gather from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Story. Having had <U+017F>ome deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with a con<U+017F>iderable Merchant
(of <hi>Cork,</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi>) he <U+017F>adly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49353:91"/>
to me, that he was afflicted
with a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of making Bloody
Water to that degree, that he fear'd
he mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>oon quit his Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already unable to ride about his
bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>carce able to walk a
foot the length of a Street, without
<U+017F>tooping to make red Water. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I told him I had a Medicine,
that, if he could dige<U+017F>t the unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>antne<U+017F>s
of it, would, I thought, by
the ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing of God, do good even in
his ca<U+017F>e. And it was only to <U+017F>crape
with a Knife as much Ca<U+017F>tile Soap
into a Spoon, as it would convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold without being pre<U+017F>s'd, <hi>i. e.</hi> neat
a dram, and having fill'd the vacant
part with <U+017F>mall Ale, or <U+017F>ome other,
convenient Drink, to facilicate the
<U+017F>wallowing <U+017F>o nau<U+017F>eous a Remedy,
wa<U+017F>h it down with a <U+017F>omewhat large
Draught of the <U+017F>ame Liquor, or other
fit Vehicle, repeating the Do<U+017F>e twice
or thrice a day, if need requir'd.
The manife<U+017F>t relief he found by this
<U+017F>eemingly de<U+017F>picable Medicine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(if I mi<U+017F>remember not) two or
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49353:92"/>
three days, invited him to continue
the u<U+017F>e of it a while longer, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to return me <U+017F>olemn thanks
for it; declaring that now for four
years together he had liv'd quite
free from his Di<U+017F>temper, without
<U+017F>crupling to ride Journeys on Hor<U+017F>e
Back, as his occasions requir'd. To
which he added, that in regard I had
not confin'd him to <U+017F>ecre<U+017F>y, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>um'd
I intended the Medicine <U+017F>hould
do as much good as might be, and
therefore <U+017F>crupled not to give it to
<U+017F>everal others, who were likewi<U+017F>e
happily cur'd by the u<U+017F>e of the <U+017F>ame
Remedy. Which Account was
therefore the more welcom to me,
becau<U+017F>e in the place were I liv'd, I
had not opportunity to make fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tryals of its Efficacy. And on
this occa<U+017F>ion I <U+017F>hall beg leave to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verti<U+017F>e
you once for all, in reference
to the Remedies deliver'd by me,

                  <p>THE la<U+017F>t thing in order, but not
in importance, that induces
me to wi<U+017F>h, that Phy<U+017F>icians would
imploy Simpler Medicines as much
as conveniently may be, is, that 'tis
one of the likelie<U+017F>t ways, (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
little le<U+017F>s than ab<U+017F>olutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary)
to promote the Practical
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49353:93"/>
knowledge of the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi>
For, whil<U+017F>t in one Receipt<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Ingredients are mingl'd, if
not confounded, 'tis almo<U+017F>t impo<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to know with any certainty,
to which of the Simples the good or
bad Effect of the Remedy is to be
attributed, or whether it be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by a Power, re<U+017F>ulting from the
particular Quality's of all of them,
united into one Temperament, and by
its means acting conjointly, and, as
the School men <U+017F>peak <hi>per modum unius.</hi>
So that by this way of heaping up
or blending Simples into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
Remedy, I <U+017F>ee not how in
many Ages Men will be able to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the true qualities good and
bad, of the particular Bodies, that
are compris'd under the name of the
<hi>Materia Medica;</hi> whereas, when a
Phy<U+017F>ician often imploys a Simple, and
ob<U+017F>erves the Effect of it, the relief
or prejudice of the Patient, may
very probably, if not with medical
certainty, be a<U+017F>crib'd to the good
or bad Qualities of that particular
Remedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:49353:94"/>
And this difficulty of di<U+017F>cerning,
what Ingredient it is of a very
compounded Medicine, that helps
or hurts the Patient, is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
to tho<U+017F>e that affect to write
Bills, wherein <U+017F>omething is pre<U+017F>crib'd,
which tho, becau<U+017F>e it goes under
one name, pa<U+017F><U+017F>es but for one Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
is yet a very compounded
Body; as is evident, in tho<U+017F>e many
pompous Receipts wherein Treacle,
(that alone con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of above <U+017F>ixty
<U+017F>everal Simples) Methridate, and
divers other famous ancient compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itions;
that each of them con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts
of good <U+017F>tore of Ingredients. I had
once thoughts of drawing up a di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
of the Difficulties of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal
Art; and had divers mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
by me for <U+017F>uch a work, which
afterwards I laid a<U+017F>ide, for fear it
<U+017F>hould be mi<U+017F>imploy'd to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of worthy Phy<U+017F>icians. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the difficulties that occurr'd to
me, I <U+017F>hall on this occa<U+017F>ion mention
one, which was; That 'tis a harder
work than mo<U+017F>t men think, to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49353:94"/>
fully the nature, or the good
and bad quality's in reference to
Phy<U+017F>ick, of this or that <U+017F>ingle Plant,
or other Simple, that has a place in
the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi> For be<U+017F>ides
the great difference that there may
be in Plants of the <U+017F>ame denomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to the Climate,
Soil, the goodne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>eeds that
produce it, the culture, or the want
of it, the time of the year, the <U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onablene<U+017F>s
or intemperatene<U+017F>s of

tho<U+017F>e that are not made u<U+017F>e of, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

all the<U+017F>e, I <U+017F>ay, the unheeded
Textures of parts that are thought
of an uniform nature, and the length
of time during which they have
been kept, without being <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected
to be <U+017F>uperannuated, and indeed
without being <U+017F>o, may <U+017F>o much
vary the nature of a Plant, that I
have <U+017F>ometimes almo<U+017F>t in a trice

<U+017F>hewn the curious a notable di<U+017F>pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the parts of the <U+017F>ame fre<U+017F>h Leaf
of a common Plant: And (NB.)
I have found by Tryal purpo<U+017F>ely
made, that <U+017F>ome <U+017F>eeds of common
u<U+017F>e in Phy<U+017F>ick (and not putrefy'd)
will, being di<U+017F>till'd at one time of
the year, afford an Acid Spirit or
Liquor; but at another time of the
year, tho de<U+017F>till'd the <U+017F>ame way
without any addition, afford not
an Acid, but a kind of urinous Spirit,
that contains a volatile Salt, which
in Smell, Ta<U+017F>t, and divers Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I found to be of great affinity
to the volatile Salt of Urine, or that
of Hart<U+017F>horn. And indeed <U+017F>o many
things may be pertinently and u<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
propos'd to be inquir'd into,
about this or that particular Plant
made u<U+017F>e of by Phy<U+017F>icians, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they would be le<U+017F>s inclin'd to
compound numbers of them in one

to many of the Remedy's that are
afforded us by the Chymi<U+017F>ts Art.
For without now entering into the

Oyls, and Salts, that are obtain'd

And that <U+017F>uch <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed
Principles, OF Medicines of a <U+017F>impler

its <U+017F>implicity, it may in many Ca<U+017F>es
be imploy'd as a <hi>Men<U+017F>truum,</hi> and by
being combin'd with an Ingredient
or two, be made to afford divers
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49353:96"/>
Medicines, which tho but little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
are not of little vertue.
For I have found it readily enough
to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve Camphire, Ma<U+017F>tick, and
<U+017F>ome other Gums, of which Bal<U+017F>oms
may be made, and others may be
obtain'd by the help of the <U+017F>ame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
even from divers Mineral and
Metalline Bodies. I <hi>will not in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t</hi> on
<U+017F>o known a Medicine as the common
Terebinthinate Bal<U+017F>om of Sulphur;
tho this be a Remedy, with as
much as 'tis peculiarly extoll'd for
Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of the Lungs, (wherein
yet its heat requires that it be very
warily given to Patients of <U+017F>ome

not confin'd to the Di<U+017F>tempers of
tho<U+017F>e parts; <U+017F>ince both I and <U+017F>ome

in trouble<U+017F>ome Haemorroidal Pains
and Tumors: and (NB.) <U+017F>ome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
inclines me to think its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
may not be much greater in
Pulmonick than in Paralytick Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers:
in which (la<U+017F>t) it may be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49353:97"/>
us'd, not only Outwardly, but

more <U+017F>paring, than many of them
are, in the number of the Ingredients
they imploy to compo<U+017F>e one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.
For mo<U+017F>t of the Arguments,
upon which I grounded my Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

are applicable to Chymical ones, as

                  <p>Fir<U+017F>t That in many ca<U+017F>es, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

Since one Body dexterou<U+017F>ly
expos'd to differing Operations, may
acquire as various, or as con<U+017F>iderable,
Qualities, as would accrew to it by
the addition of <U+017F>uch other Bodies,
as an ordinary Chymi<U+017F>t would in
probability a<U+017F><U+017F>ociate with it. Thus,
not to mention Quick-<U+017F>ilver, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
alone, whether prepar'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

I pre<U+017F>ume you will allow me to

or <hi>Remedy</hi> in the <U+017F>trict and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olute
<U+017F>en<U+017F>e, but in a comparative
one, that excludes compo<U+017F>itions of
more than two or three, or at the
utmo<U+017F>t a very few, Ingredients.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Without bringing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or <U+017F>o much as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderabe
number, of Ingredients, one

ones, if judiciou<U+017F>ly cho<U+017F>en and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

more efficacious Remedies, than
the admirers of pompuous Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es
would expect, or perhaps be able to
make tho<U+017F>e Proce<U+017F><U+017F>es vye with.
The violently Emetick and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
vertue of Gla<U+017F>s of Antimony
made <hi>per <U+017F>e,</hi> may be, as I el<U+017F>ewhere
<U+017F>how, more powerfully corrected by
mere di<U+017F>till'd Vinegar, than by many
famous Stomachick and Cordial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixirs,
and other Elaborate Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And <U+017F>ometimes a <U+017F>eemingly
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49353:99"/>
improper addition may not only
correct, but give new and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vertues to a Drug. Thus, though
<hi>Sublimatum corro<U+017F>ivum</hi> be a mercurial
concrete, <U+017F>o fretting, that a very few
Grains of it may be able to kill a
man; yet by adding and carefully
uniting to it about an equal weight
of running Mercury, there is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
when they are well united by
Sublimations, a Compound that
is <U+017F>o free from being corro<U+017F>ive, that
Chymi<U+017F>ts call it <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi>
which though <U+017F>ome unwary Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
as well Galeni<U+017F>ts as Chymi<U+017F>ts,
have too often by their mi<U+017F>imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, di<U+017F>credited, yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<U+017F>hows that in Skilful hands it
may be u<U+017F>efully imployed, not only
in <U+017F>ome venereal affections, but in
divers other Di<U+017F>tempers. And I
<U+017F>hall now add, that being carefully
prepar'd, and well given, it may
not only be freed from corro<U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s,
but much allay the Sharpne<U+017F>s
both of <U+017F>ome emptying Medicines,
&amp; of <U+017F>ome peccant humors. To coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49353:99"/>
the latter part of which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ervation,
I <U+017F>hall acquaint you with
one u<U+017F>e of it, that perhaps you have
not yet made. I remember, I had an
opportunity to ob<U+017F>erve the Efficacy
of <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> in a <U+017F>tubborn
<hi>di<U+017F>entery,</hi> that had baffled the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of an eminent Phy<U+017F>ician. But
though a reflection on the vertue, I
knew this Medicine to have, of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
Sharp humors, and re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting
Putrefaction, may ju<U+017F>tly increa<U+017F>e my
favourable opinion of it; yet not
thinking my Experience competent,
I imparted it to an ancient and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Chyrurgeon, that was the chief
of tho<U+017F>e that belong'd to a famous
and judicious General of an Army;
who thereupon frankly confe<U+017F>s'd to
me, that this was his great <hi>Arcanum,</hi>
wherewith he had cur'd many <U+017F>cores,
or rather hundreds of Souldiers
in this generals Army. Only, where
as my way is to give from 8, or 10,
to 12, or at mo<U+017F>t 15 Grains of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius
dulcis</hi> for a Do<U+017F>e, made up
with <U+017F>ome little <hi>Rhubarb, &amp;c.</hi> Or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49353:100"/>
Ingredient that would make it
work, once, twice, or thrice with
another Patient, (for the di<U+017F>entery
it <U+017F>elf helps to carry off the Medicine)
he, both to di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e it, and to
make it more ea<U+017F>ily takeable, made
it up with Sugar and Mucilage of
Cum-dragon into Lozenges, whereof
one might contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
near a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to half a dram of the <hi>Mercurius
dulcis,</hi> of which he order'd the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to take one at a time, without
hindering their March; only bidding
them have a great care, that nothing
<U+017F>hould <U+017F>tick between their Teeth, or
in their Throats.</p>
                  <p>3. But the efficacy of this <U+017F>imple
preparation of <hi>Mercury,</hi> is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to that more <U+017F>imple, although
more tedious, preparation of Gold,
which was made the <U+017F>ame way in
two differing Countries, by two
dexterous Phy<U+017F>icians, both of them
of my acquaintance. For though I
had long been prejudic'd (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Per<U+017F>ons of great note, that I was
particularly acquainted with both
before they fell de<U+017F>perately <U+017F>ick, and
after their <U+017F>trange Recovery, that I
could not but change my former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or a very favourable one of <hi><U+017F>ome</hi>
preparations of <hi>Gold;</hi> and I <U+017F>hould

he paid, by a great <U+017F>tore of the Noble
Metal that afforded it, if it could
have been made in great quantity,
or without a great deal of pains and

becau<U+017F>e by the kindne<U+017F>s of the

<U+017F>aw, the preparation of it, that
to bring home what has been <U+017F>aid,

you, that there is no Ingredient a<U+017F><U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
to the <hi>Gold,</hi> <U+017F>ave one, that comes
from above, and is reputed one of

which one may take two or three
Ounces altogether unprepar'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

yet the Do<U+017F>e of this almo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>ipid
Medicine, that was given to an old
Courtier, even in a violent Apoplexy,
wherein other Remedies had by
skil'ful men been us'd in vain, was
but <U+017F>ix or eight drops.</p>
                  <p>In another very ancient and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent
per<U+017F>on the Do<U+017F>e was greater,
becau<U+017F>e the Tincture was more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe
and diluted; but the effect was
as <U+017F>udden, tho the Patient was not
bled, and tho there was not in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the<U+017F>e two ca<U+017F>es, any notably
<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, evacuation made. [Both

by three Phy<U+017F>icians, whereof
one told me with great grief, that
he would not out-live the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and yet upon the taking of a

pre<U+017F>ently reliev'd, and from that
time found a <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible amendment
towards a recovery, which he now
injoys; tho he were then reputed to
be about, if not above four<U+017F>core
years old. Some other odd effects
of this. Remedy I could tell you of:
But it has already much <U+017F>well'd this
Section, and yet I thought it not

that the true <hi>Sulphureous parts</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

obtain'd, and requir'd <U+017F>o much

trouble<U+017F>ome a work. And in
effect I found, upon various Tryals,
the con<U+017F>tituent Parts of that Metal
to be much more <U+017F>trictly united than
the generality even of Chymi<U+017F>ts ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
For the extraordinary effects

in mortifying <U+017F>harp humours

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49353:105"/>
Particular, which 'tis like you have

who, be<U+017F>ides a va<U+017F>t practice o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi<U+017F>e,
was Chyrurgeon to a

among<U+017F>t all the Medicines he has try'd
to <U+017F>top Bleeding, and prevent Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in Amputations, that which
he oftene<U+017F>t us'd, and mo<U+017F>t rely'd on,
is a <U+017F>olution of <hi>Saccharum Saturni</hi> in
Plantain Water (or for a need in
pure common Water:) for having
di<U+017F><U+017F>olv'd <U+2125>j. of the former in about a
Pint or pound of the latter; as <U+017F>oon
as ever the Limb or other part is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

drench'd in this Liquor, as hot as
the Patient can well endure; and
having bound them carefully on, he
makes, no ha<U+017F>t to take them off, but
allows the Medicine time enough to
perform its operation: To counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

that I could here mention divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Experiments, as well upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,

this to defraud.</p>
                  <p>What has been above noted about
Metals, may be extended to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals:
namely, that when there is
need to compound them, it may of
tentimes be <U+017F>ufficient to a<U+017F><U+017F>ociate
them with one or two, or at mo<U+017F>t a

<U+017F>hall not <U+017F>cruple to take notice of

Medicinal vertues, which yet are
very great, e<U+017F>pecially in <hi>A<U+017F>thmas</hi> and
<hi>Coughs,</hi> in which I do not remember
that I ever gave it without benefit

in the hands of Phy<U+017F>icians, that
were willing to try it for me, e<U+017F>pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in tho<U+017F>e of a Per<U+017F>on, who though
well furni<U+017F>h'd with choice Remedies
of his own, often came to me for a
<U+017F>upply of this Spirituous and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
Tincture, with which he
a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me he did notable things in
<hi>A<U+017F>thmatical</hi> ca<U+017F>es; and particularly in
one that was very ob<U+017F>tinate, and had
la<U+017F>ted many years. But not having
had quite <U+017F>o many opportunities as
I wi<U+017F>hed of giving it my <U+017F>elf, I <U+017F>hall
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49353:106"/>
be glad, that further Tryal may be
made of it by <U+017F>o skilful an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trer
as you. And therefore le<U+017F>t you
<U+017F>hould not have the Book lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to at hand, I <U+017F>hall here repeat,
that our Medicine is made of Flowers
of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> exactly mix't with an
equal weight of finely powder'd <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Armoniac,</hi>
and <U+017F>omewhat more than
an equal weight of good <hi>Quick-lime,</hi>
<U+017F>eparately reduc'd to a Suttle Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
For the<U+017F>e three Ingredients be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diligently and nimbly mix'd,
and put into a Retort, to be plac'd
in a <U+017F>and Furnace, and fitted with
a large receiver very well luted to
it. This Mixture, I <U+017F>ay, being duly
di<U+017F>till'd in <U+017F>uch ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, will afford a
Blood red and <U+017F>moaking <U+017F>pirit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Sulphureous both in <U+017F>mell
and oven Mechanical Operations.
And in this Di<U+017F>tillation the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
Parts <U+017F>ometimes came over ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>tore of <U+017F>aline

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49353:107"/>
remember that having for curio<U+017F>ity's
<U+017F>ake added to the Fluid Tincture
a due proportion of an Ardent Spirit
(<U+017F>uch as that of Wine) exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegm'd,
I had a Mixture (whether
in the form of a Coagulum or not)
which afforded me <U+017F>ome odd <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
not here to be mention'd, and
which we <U+017F>ubled with a gentle fire to
unite them into a compo<U+017F>ition that
may for di<U+017F>tinction <U+017F>ake be call'd <hi>Sa trium

<hi>Urinous</hi> Particles, <hi>Vinous</hi> ones, (and
perhaps <U+017F>ome of <hi>Soot</hi>) and <hi>Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>

and the la<U+017F>t to the <hi>Mineral</hi>

(that would pre<U+017F>ently gild <hi>Silver,</hi>)
and the Spirit that may be made to
accompany it, may have in Phy<U+017F>ick,
I had not occa<U+017F>ion to try. But yet I

the frequent u<U+017F>e of <U+017F>imple Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
that oftentimes it happens
that a <hi>Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e,</hi> or a <hi>morbi<U+017F>ick Matter,</hi> is
not the effect of a <U+017F>ingle Cau<U+017F>e, but is
produc'd by the concurrence of two,
or perhaps more, Cau<U+017F>es, which
producing <U+017F>everal <U+017F>ymptoms, 'tis not
probable that one Simple Drag will

This Objection I confe<U+017F>s is

I acknowledg it to be <U+017F>o weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

to imploy in them a Medicine con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of more Ingredients than one or

Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, whereof each may proceed
from differring cau<U+017F>es, and that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy

When 'tis produc'd by one of tho<U+017F>e

4. But the main thing that
I intended, by way of an<U+017F>wer to the
fore<U+017F>een Objection, was, that in a
<U+017F>imple Medince nature her <U+017F>elf does
oftentimes <U+017F>o well play the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,
as to render the compo<U+017F>itions
made in his <U+017F>hop unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. For,
tho we are wont to look upon this or
that Plant or Mineral, as an entire
and <U+017F>imple Body, yet we may much
mi<U+017F>take, if we look upon it as a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous
one. In <U+017F>everal Plants
that are organical Bodies, this Truth
is manife<U+017F>t; as for in<U+017F>tance, in <hi>Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
the <hi>Succulent</hi> part is <U+017F>oure and
cooling, but the <hi>Yellow Rind</hi> con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
bitter and hot: and <U+017F>o in
<hi>Lemons</hi> the <hi>Pulp,</hi> the <hi>Yellow</hi> part of
the <hi>Rind,</hi> and the <hi><U+017F>eeds</hi> have their
differing Qualities and Medicinal
vertues. And even in <U+017F>uch vegetable
Sub<U+017F>tances as are Homogeneous as to
<U+017F>en<U+017F>e, there may be Parts, who<U+017F>e opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be not only differing, but
contrary; as is manife<U+017F>t in the Root,

by barely being expos'd for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent

an Acid Salt, two kinds of Sulphur,
a Terre<U+017F>trial Sub<U+017F>tance, and at lea<U+017F>t

Phlegm, a <U+017F>wiming Oyl and a <U+017F>ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

very like that of Urine, a Phlegme,
an Acid Spirit, another Spirit too
which I have el<U+017F>ewhere given the

whereof one will <U+017F>ink in Water, and

Salt, upon which the newly

(and but once) the opportunity of
making a Tryal, whereof I <U+017F>hall
now give you a brief Account, of
the vertue of a <U+017F>tone taken out of the
Head of an enormou<U+017F>ly great <hi>African</hi>
Serpent; which <U+017F>tone was affirm'd to
the Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or of it, Governour of

to be highly available again<U+017F>t
the Bitings of all venemous Animals.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49353:115"/>
The <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance of the Experiment (to
give it you in <U+017F>hort) was this, I caus'd
a young Cat to be bitten by a fierce
and highly irritated Viper, which <U+017F>o
inrag'd the Cat, that in revenge he
endeavour'd to bite off her Head,
which he took in his Mouth, and
did not let go, till, as the Spectators
concluded, <U+017F>he had bit him again,
at, lea<U+017F>t by the tongue; <U+017F>oon after
which venemous Hurt, the Cats
Head <U+017F>well'd very much, and tho he
<U+017F>oon grew <U+017F>o weak, that he was not
able to <U+017F>tand on his Legs, but lay along
on the ground, yet he <U+017F>eem'd to be
grown quite mad, for he foam'd at
the Mouth, and <U+017F>napt at the end of
a Wand, or <U+017F>uch like things, that
were but held near him; and,
which was more, in his rage bit one
of his own Legs, that lay not far
from his Mouth, much to the <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<U+017F>e
of the Spectators. But, <hi>tho</hi> in
this de<U+017F>perate condition it <U+017F>eem'd in
vain to attempt any thing for his
Re<U+017F>cue, becau<U+017F>e one could make him
take nothing, and every one was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49353:115"/>
to come near him; <hi>yet</hi> having
mix'd a little of the powder'd <U+017F>tone
with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ponfuls of fair Water,
it was by the help of the neck of a
gla<U+017F>s Retort, that we imploy'd in
<U+017F>tead of a funnel, pour'd by degrees
upon the Cats Mouth; which lying
open, tho he endeavour'd to <U+017F>hake
it off, yet <U+017F>ome of it was concluded
to have got in; and within one
hour or two after, if not le<U+017F>s, he did,
to the no <U+017F>mall wonder of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tanders,
get upon his Legs again,
and not only <U+017F>eem'd to have much of
the Tumidne<U+017F>s of his Head, but
readily enough took the Medicine I
caus'd to be given him; and would
probably have <U+017F>cap'd very well, if,
whil<U+017F>t I was at dinner with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<U+017F>ome unruly People had not

this place to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t on a Te<U+017F>timony
already alledg'd, tho its Credibility,
as well as that of the thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by it, may be much favour'd
by what has been related, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Vertues of Stones outwardly
apply'd, in the latter part of the Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e
about Specificks: For this
Rea<U+017F>on, I <U+017F>ay, I <U+017F>hall add a couple
of other remarkable In<U+017F>tances, of the
Efficacy of even Dry and Solid Bodies,
tho but externally apply'd in Di<U+017F>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es
attended with <U+017F>everal, and divers
of them uncommon Symptoms,
whereof, whatever many think of
the harmle<U+017F>sne<U+017F>s of our Engli<U+017F>h Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
I have here known <U+017F>everal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances,
in Men as well as Brutes.
And yet in the<U+017F>e dangerous Ca<U+017F>es,
many that come from <hi>Ea<U+017F>t India</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
the great Efficacy of <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e
Stony Concretions, that are <U+017F>aid to
be found in the Heads of a certain
kind of Serpents about <hi>Goa,</hi> and <U+017F>ome

curing the Bitings of Vipers, and <hi>tho</hi>
I do not wonder at their diffidence,
becau<U+017F>e in effect many of the <U+017F>tones
brought from <hi>India</hi> are but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit;
and of tho<U+017F>e that were really
taken out of Serpents, <U+017F>everal, for a
Rea<U+017F>on I mu<U+017F>t not <U+017F>tay to mention,
are in<U+017F>ignificant; (and <U+017F>uch perhaps
were tho<U+017F>e that the learned and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Redy</hi> made his Tryals with) <hi>yet</hi>
there are others, who<U+017F>e vertues are
not well to be deny'd. For, not to
build on vulgar Traditions, which
are but too often deceitful, one of
the eminente<U+017F>t Doctors of the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
Colledge</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me, that he had,
with one of the<U+017F>e <U+017F>tones, done, tho
contrary to his expectation; a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Cure, which he related to me
at large. And one of our chief
Engli<U+017F>h Chyrurgeons affirm'd to me,
that he had done the like upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
per<U+017F>on; both of the<U+017F>e Cures
being perform'd by the bare appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Stone, to the Place bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Viper or Adder. And a very
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49353:118"/>
intelligent per<U+017F>on, who had the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of a con<U+017F>iderable Company
of Traders in <hi>Ea<U+017F>t India,</hi> where he
long liv'd, a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd me that he had
with this Stone cur'd <U+017F>everal per<U+017F>ons
of the Hurts of venemous Animals,
But, this Te<U+017F>timony is much le<U+017F>s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iderable,
as to the number of Cures,
than that of a great Traveller into
the Southern parts of the <U+017F>ame <hi>India,</hi>
who, tho he were bred by a famous
Carte<U+017F>ian Philo<U+017F>pher, and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enough to di<U+017F>credit vulgar Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
about the Countreys he had
long liv'd in; yet being for tho<U+017F>e Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons
ask'd by me, what I might <U+017F>afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe of the Stones I <U+017F>peak of,
<U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly affirm'd to me, that he had

becau<U+017F>e, finding it excellent, He was

ca<U+017F>es. And this <U+017F>ame Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of my own, made with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49353:119"/>
Stone of this kind, upon the
Bodies of Brutes, much inclines me
to give credit to. But, becau<U+017F>e
this Stone is afforded by an <hi>Animal,</hi>
I <U+017F>hall add the vertues of another,
that properly belongs to the <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Kingdom; in a Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e
Symptoms, tho not <U+017F>o various, are
<U+017F>ometimes dangerous, and too often
mortal.</p>
                  <p>To <U+017F>hew you then, that in <U+017F>pite
of great Clo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s and Hardne<U+017F>s, a
<U+017F>imple Remedy outwardly apply'd,
may be a very effectual one, I <U+017F>hall
inform you, that tho the Solid I am
<U+017F>peaking of pa<U+017F>t for a <hi>Blood<U+017F>tone,</hi> yet
by its colour and <U+017F>ome other vi<U+017F>ible
qualities, I <U+017F>hould rather have taken
it for an <hi>Agat.</hi> It was but about the
bigne<U+017F>s of a <U+017F>mall Nutmeg, and had
in it a Perforation, by which a
<U+017F>tiring pa<U+017F>t through it, to fa<U+017F>ten it to
the Part affected. This Stone had
been long kept in the Family that
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd it, when I <U+017F>aw it, being for
its rare vertues left by one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But, to omit the reports that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49353:119"/>
went of it, the notable ca<U+017F>e, that
makes it pertinent for me to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it here, was this. An ingenious
Gentleman, that was a man of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and when I <U+017F>aw him, was in the
Flower of his Age, and of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
<U+017F>o highly Sanguine, as is not
u<U+017F>ually to be met with, was from
time to time <U+017F>ubject to Hemorrhages
at the No<U+017F>e; <U+017F>o profu<U+017F>e and <U+017F>o diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be re<U+017F>train'd, that his Phy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
tho a Per<U+017F>on famous and very
well skill'd in his Art, told me he
often fear'd he <U+017F>hould loo<U+017F>e his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and that he would be carry'd
away by this unbridled Di<U+017F>temper<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
But when good method and variety
of Remedies had been try'd, without
the de<U+017F>ir'd <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, this Stone was at
length obtain'd from an ancient Kin<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of the Gentlemans, to tye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Neck, <U+017F>o as to touch his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Skin. This when he did in the
Fits, it would <U+017F>top the Bleeding;
and if he wore it for <U+017F>ome con<U+017F>idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time together, he all that while
continu'd well, as both his learned
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49353:120"/>
Phy<U+017F>ician and him<U+017F>elf inform'd me.
And, becau<U+017F>e I was apt to a<U+017F>cribe
<U+017F>omewhat of this effect to imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
on, the Patient told me, that a while
before one of the chief Women in
the City, (whom he nam'd to me)
fell into <U+017F>o violent a Bleedings, that,
tho' it brought her into a Swoon,
yet that it <U+017F>elf, which is <U+017F>omewhat
<U+017F>trange, did not hinder her to Bleed
on, till the Stone, having been ty'd
about her Neck, made her cea<U+017F>e to
do <U+017F>o, tho' <U+017F>he knew nothing of its
having been apply'd to her. And this
it <U+017F>elf is le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trange than what the
Gentleman affirm'd to me of the
Power of this <hi>Gem,</hi> as it may de<U+017F>erv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
be called. For his complexion
inclining him, as was above intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to breed great <U+017F>tore of Blood, his
Doctor thought fit to order him, for
prevention, to breath a Vein, from
time to time, which when he was
about to do, he was obliged to lay
a<U+017F>ide the Stone for a while, becau<U+017F>e,
whil<U+017F>t he kept it on, the Blood would
not i<U+017F><U+017F>ue out, at lea<U+017F>t with the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ite
Freedom.</p>

                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:49353:120"/>
But how far have I already pa<U+017F>t
beyond the de<U+017F>igned Limits of this
little Tract! wherein I at fir<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but to lay before you the
five chief advantages I had ob<U+017F>erv'd,
mere <U+017F>imple Remedies to have of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
compounded ones; and briefly
to propo<U+017F>e the main grounds, on
which I a<U+017F>crib'd tho<U+017F>e advantages to
<U+017F>uch Remedies. But tho' the better
to keep this writing from being
prolix, I de<U+017F>ign'd that it <U+017F>hould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t
chiefly of <U+017F>uch particulars, as I
could be<U+017F>t <U+017F>pare from other Papers;
And <hi>tho'</hi> for that rea<U+017F>on I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ely
omitted many parable, and
other but little Compounded or Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
Medicines: Yet I now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that, <U+017F>o many new particulars
having offer'd them<U+017F>elves on <U+017F>everal
occa<U+017F>ions, whil<U+017F>t I was writing, my
Pen has <U+017F>lipt into the mention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more Receipts, and Hi<U+017F>torical
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, than were at fir<U+017F>t intended.
But believing the <U+017F>ubject to be very
u<U+017F>eful, and not de<U+017F>pairing but that
the things deliver'd on it may not
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49353:121"/>
be altogether u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s; I dare hope
you will pardon <U+017F>uch faults, as only
my de<U+017F>ire of making the Parts of this

Methodical or well proportion'd,
drew me unawares into. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
were the cau<U+017F>e of my Prolixity,
the bulk which I <U+017F>ee this Paper has
already <U+017F>well'd to, admoni<U+017F>hes me,
