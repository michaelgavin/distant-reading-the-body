            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was on a day, that as Time rode by in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
of the Sun, I re<U+017F>olved to go in Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to <hi>Parna<U+017F><U+017F>us;</hi> and borrowing <U+017F>ome few
idle hours of that old bald-pated U<U+017F>urer to bear my
expences, I weaved me a Hermits Gown of Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
for clock, and took for a Staff a Sun-beam,
and <U+017F>o accoutred I went to do my devoire to the nine
Patrone<U+017F><U+017F>es of Poe<U+017F>ie. Where after a long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
peregrination I arrived; but no <U+017F>ooner arrived
than I beheld to my a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, the Widowed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
that once had embraced the Ca<U+017F>talian Springs
<U+017F>weet off <U+017F>pring, de<U+017F>titute of its murmuring <U+017F>ociety,
and of the delight it once took in its moi<U+017F>t ki<U+017F><U+017F>es, and
pro<U+017F>titute to a new black complexion'd Lover; the
bubling womb whence that progeny was extracted,
being turned to a Grave, where Oblivion lay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed;
that trea<U+017F>ury of liquid Pearls that u<U+017F>ed of
yore to enrich old Poets Brains, wherewith they <U+017F>o
oft be<U+017F>pangled their Poems, being quite exhau<U+017F>ted.
Some <U+017F>aid it was thence conveyed into little Ci<U+017F>terns,
and <U+017F>o conducted thorough <U+017F>lender pipes into a va<U+017F>t
Conduit. Others <U+017F>aid the thir<U+017F>ty throats of Lovers,
parch't with Beauties Raies had <U+017F>will'd it up. I as
an impartial Judge imputed it to both. Next I
looked round to <U+017F>ee if I could e<U+017F>py the Mu<U+017F>es; but
Time it <U+017F>eemed had long ago ravi<U+017F>hed tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>weet
<pb facs="tcp:52129:4"/>
Virgins from that <U+017F>olitary place. Some <U+017F>aid they
were dead and Coffin'd up in Poets Souls. Others
<U+017F>aid, they <U+017F>erved as Handmaids to fond Lovers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramors.
I as an unintere<U+017F><U+017F>ed Umpire imputed it to
neither, but judged they were fled to heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
their Bankrupted <U+017F>tores. Thus grieved to <U+017F>ee
my journey fru<U+017F>trate, I re<U+017F>olved however to Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
my eyes with the <U+017F>ight of that forked moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that once had been the plea<U+017F>ant Throne where
the nine Virgin Queens were wont to <U+017F>it, Crowned
with Lawrel, on a green Carpet wrought with <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re's</hi>

it, I <U+017F>aw nothing but the Plain who<U+017F>e <U+017F>houlders had
once born that huge pile of earth; when <U+017F>truck into
a tran<U+017F>port with admiration at this mon<U+017F>trous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Time, I was told by the <U+017F>tanders by, that

to <U+017F>cal Heaven, and plunder it of its choice<U+017F>t

their minds. The<U+017F>e words were as an alarum to
my murmuring thoughts, which now began to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
again<U+017F>t my repo<U+017F>e; whom whil<U+017F>t I <U+017F>trove to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea<U+017F>e,
I heard from a confu<U+017F>ed Ma<U+017F>s of Rocks and
Stones, the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>oul-entrancing-melody that ever
was begotten of the Airs fluid womb; <U+017F>uch as would
have compelled a Stoick to <U+017F>leep his mind in tho<U+017F>e
<U+017F>oft plea<U+017F>ures, who<U+017F>e every tone <U+017F>ounded like a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pason,

Empyreal Orb re<U+017F>ound the Eulogies they <U+017F>ing in
prai<U+017F>e of their immortal <U+017F>olace. No <U+017F>ooner were
the<U+017F>e Airs convey'd into the Labyrinth of my ear, but
I felt my <U+017F>elf confounded with <U+017F>udden ravi<U+017F>hment;
when demanding of the Auditory, whether Melody
it <U+017F>elf lay interred under that Chaos? Reply was
made, that they were onely <U+017F>ome few Reliques of tho<U+017F>e
ravi<U+017F>hing <U+017F>trains <hi>Apollo</hi> u<U+017F>ed to charm <U+017F>ouls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
when playing on his Viol he made the Air dance
her rarest mea<U+017F>ures, in thou<U+017F>ands of <U+017F>weet forms,
after his nimbly quavering fingers, who<U+017F>e melody
made the very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s <U+017F>tones become Epicures, who
loath to part with their delight, hoorded up its Silver
<U+017F>ound in their obdurate, trea<U+017F>uries. Scarce had my
mind lent attendance to the cadence of their <U+017F>peech,
ere I was <U+017F>natcht I knew not how, I knew not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Whil<U+017F>t I lay exta<U+017F>ied with this harmony, I
<U+017F>aw in a Vi<U+017F>ion, a young Mu<U+017F>e in tattered habit, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in her hand the pourtraiture of a man, drawn by
the Pencil of Nature <U+017F>o exqui<U+017F>itely, that it <U+017F>eemed
the perfect Character of a Divine Idea, for no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
fancy could devi<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch an excellent draught.
His looks were the En<U+017F>igns of <U+017F>ome eminence in
him, more than humane; <U+017F>o that he <U+017F>eemed the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the whole worlds excellencies: The Princely
Air of his countenance <U+017F>eeming as a refracting
medium of the beams of an illustrious Soul; that he
almost confirmed in me, that before doubted Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>m,

               <hi>That Angels are united to bodies.</hi> As I
was feeding my admiration with this admirable
<U+017F>ight, I heard a voice proclame in my ears, Copy
out this repre<U+017F>entation. Fain would I have made
my own inability the excu<U+017F>e of my neglect, and made
an<U+017F>wer, that <U+017F>uch <U+017F>uperlative excellencies did tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
my comprehen<U+017F>ion, much more my expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions;

Who is it that thus by endeavours cruelly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
rips up my wounds, fondly thinking thereby to

from Vertue, which makes the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or inflexible
under all adver<U+017F>ity, like the rock that remains unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
though a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted with the impetuous rage of the
hoi<U+017F>terous Winds and roaring <U+017F>urges of the troubled

up her re<U+017F>idence, hath always a <hi>Halcion</hi> <U+017F>erenity
within, whatever the tempe<U+017F>tuous changes and <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of Fortune may be without; <U+017F>uch a one is placed in

only as a lofty mountain, on which he may overtop
the mi<U+017F>ty region where Fortune minteth and <hi>Contrives</hi>
her various accidents, but as wings, that tran<U+017F>port his
Spirit above the Stars, by which means he over-rules,

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52129:12"/>
a greater influence on his own felicity, than all the
Con<U+017F>tellations in the Heavens. And though there are
none have a Charter of Exemption from the enmities
of cro<U+017F>s mi<U+017F>chances, yet can they not infringe a wi<U+017F>e
mans happine<U+017F>s, <U+017F>ince it depends not either on For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
incon<U+017F>tant <U+017F>miles, or the uncertain di<U+017F>po<U+017F>itions
of men, but on the con<U+017F>tant and certain exerci<U+017F>e of
Vertue, which <U+017F>ad misfortunes can no more impede,
than the air can oppo<U+017F>e the lights penetration. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
will <U+017F>hine through the thicke<U+017F>t clouds of adver<U+017F>ity,
nay, its lu<U+017F>tre will then mo<U+017F>t appear; that ru<U+017F>t which
with too much ea<U+017F>e is apt to contract, is <U+017F>coured off
by the filing of adver<U+017F>e fortune, like the fire that lies
hid in the bo<U+017F>om of a <U+017F>lint, content with its own

dwelling, nor appeareth to the view of others, unle<U+017F>s
rou<U+017F>ed by the Steels rude <hi>knocks.</hi> Hence Calamities
<U+017F>hould be the exerci<U+017F>e, not the overthrow of Vertue,
and therefore to be overcome with every infelicity ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
rather too much of a Feminine Spirit, whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath not indulged with that Heroical power of

Know you then in the City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> there dwelt a
Nobleman, by name <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> who as he was equal
to any, both for de<U+017F>cent, being derived of an ancient
and honourable Family, as al<U+017F>o for Wi<U+017F>dom and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<U+017F>o he did excel all in the place where he lived
for liberality; He was both magnificently expen<U+017F>ive
in his gifts and pre<U+017F>ents, to tho<U+017F>e whom Birth and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had made his equals and <U+017F>uperiours, and almo<U+017F>t
prodigally liberal, <hi>in his <U+017F>upplying the nece<U+017F>sities</hi> too of
his inferiours, and in neither exceeding the bounds of
mediocrity. But e<U+017F>pecially when publick occa<U+017F>ions
required it, he was a Pre<U+017F>ident to all, admired at by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52129:13"/>
mo<U+017F>t, and envyed at by <U+017F>ome, who<U+017F>e malice, though
it made them repine and carp at his actions, yet it
could not <U+017F>tir the <U+017F>pirits of others any farther than to
retort tho<U+017F>e malicious detractings with the greater di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace

which they with <U+017F>uch peevi<U+017F>h violence ca<U+017F>t, thinking to
wound his Honour, flew back with the greater reproach
upon them<U+017F>elves. Now as <hi>Corinth</hi> did reap the fruits
of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his magnificence, <U+017F>o the City did repay
him with re<U+017F>pect and honour; And as Fortune had
heaped <U+017F>uch favours upon him as made him <U+017F>eem her
darling, <U+017F>o Heavens ble<U+017F>t him with a Son and a

<U+017F>uch, that as their Parents were an Honour to them,
<U+017F>o they were to their Parents, and both were happy
in each other. But e<U+017F>pecially <U+017F>uch was the <hi>ravi<U+017F>hing</hi>
beauty of <hi>Florinda,</hi> as that it did attract the eyes and
hearts of all; All her Vertues, and Graces, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments,
were as <U+017F>o many nets to inthrall each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.
Among the re<U+017F>t, it was my unhappy fortune
at a fea<U+017F>t, to view that beauty, which had captivated
<U+017F>o many; As <U+017F>oon as ever <U+017F>he came, I felt my <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o
<U+017F>trangely tran<U+017F>ported, as if my <U+017F>oul had been <hi><U+017F>natched
ont of my eyes,</hi> the <U+017F>parkling glances that came from
her eyes were as <U+017F>o many <hi>Charms</hi> that <hi>inchanted</hi> me
into a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate Feaver. The changing my colour
<U+017F>ufficiently di<U+017F>covered the convul<U+017F>ions of my mind,
one while blu<U+017F>hing, <U+017F>eating le<U+017F>t my <U+017F>tollen views
<U+017F>hould betray my di<U+017F>temper, and then de<U+017F>pairing
thoughts would cau<U+017F>e a palene<U+017F>s to over-<U+017F>pread my
countenance. Thus I continued one while blaming
my eyes for giving entrance to tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ires that had
wholly <U+017F>tollen away my heart, then my mind for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
tho<U+017F>e thoughts which fed tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>ires, and
cau<U+017F>ed that torment. No <hi>delights</hi> could give me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52129:14"/>
whil<U+017F>t that <hi>delightful</hi> object was pre<U+017F>ent.
A faint qualm made me nau<U+017F>eat the rarities which were
provided, onely my eyes fed upon <hi>Florinda</hi>'s rare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which the more they fed, the more I pined,
and remained the le<U+017F>s <U+017F>atisfied; and tho<U+017F>e melodious
Con<U+017F>orts of Mu<U+017F>ick made the greater di<U+017F>cord in tho<U+017F>e
pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, which had <U+017F>o furiou<U+017F>ly agitated my <U+017F>pirits, and
at the be<U+017F>t bred a melancholy, which as fuell did but
foment the flames. The variety of company did
but abridge the freedom of conver<U+017F>ing with my
thoughts.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Florinda</hi> tyrannize over my affections, till
at length Night, which puts no difference between the
rare<U+017F>t Beauty and the greate<U+017F>t deformity, and cau<U+017F>es all
things to return to that Chaos, out of which they
were created, cau<U+017F>ed her to withdraw, and <U+017F>o <U+017F>eparated
us. But alas, though the<U+017F>e beauteous rays which had <U+017F>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
my heart, were Eclip<U+017F>ed by Nights black veil, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could re<U+017F>train the Eyes of my thoughts from view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Picture which my fancy had limned in my mind.
But as the Moon is the cau<U+017F>e of the various e<U+017F>tuations
of the Sea, <U+017F>o her Idea cau<U+017F>ed <U+017F>uch Ebbings and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as would not permit the lea<U+017F>t repo<U+017F>e,
which I termed an amorous Lunacy. Thus for a time
I <U+017F>trove to retain my pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion a pri<U+017F>oner within my brea<U+017F>t,
till a convenient opportunity tendring it <U+017F>elf, being
not able to endure the torment, I di<U+017F>clo<U+017F>ed the <U+017F>ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of my affections to her, which were no <U+017F>ooner di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
but I perceived alterations in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
mode<U+017F>ty and di<U+017F>dain <U+017F>eemed to contend for <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority;</hi>
the former by rendring her the more amiable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea<U+017F>ed
my <U+017F>lames, and the latter my de<U+017F>pair; <U+017F>o that I
<U+017F>tood like a pri<U+017F>oner at the Bar, expecting the <U+017F>entence
to be pa<U+017F>t upon him. But <hi>Florinda</hi> which had by her
Eyes di<U+017F>played the thoughts of her mind, did more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52129:14"/>
them by her expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, telling me how di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
<U+017F>uch di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es were to her; and that <U+017F>he could
not but look upon them as tryals of her <hi>levity,</hi> and that
<U+017F>he was none of tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e over-fond Credulity
made them yield to the allurements of men, who<U+017F>e
hearts and tongues <U+017F>eldom concurr, but fir<U+017F>t with fal<U+017F>e
per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions en<U+017F>nare, and after de<U+017F>ert them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ca<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch a blot of contempt upon them, as no tears
nor repentance can wipe away. That <U+017F>he rather
thought my words proceeded from an in<U+017F>olent de<U+017F>ire of
tyrannizing over her, than from any <U+017F>incerity in me, as
I pretended. But my words could not be <U+017F>o di<U+017F>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
to her, as hers were to me; my looks had been an
invincible Argument of my integrity, if <U+017F>he had view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with an Eye le<U+017F>s Cruel than Charitable; for
my <U+017F>pirits which before, <U+017F>ear had cau<U+017F>ed to retire to my
heart, were now ready to take wing, but that they
were recalled by the <U+017F>udden arrival of the waiting wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which gave me occa<U+017F>ion to take leave of her, with
whom it was death to part. Home I went, fraught
with a thou<U+017F>and perplexing agonies, fluttering about my
ears like birds of prey, devouring all tho<U+017F>e Cates of
con<U+017F>olation that Hope would <U+017F>et before me. Neither day
nor night could give any ea<U+017F>e to my torments; <U+017F>leep it
<U+017F>elf, that gives re<U+017F>t to the tyred labourer, made me but
the more re<U+017F>tle<U+017F>s, by torturing my imaginations with
the mo<U+017F>t extravagant <hi>Chymaeraes,</hi> that could be fancyed.
Frequent <U+017F>olicitations I made, which were not more
frequent, than vain. Till at length the<U+017F>e <U+017F>torms were
over-blown, by one <U+017F>weet bla<U+017F>t, from her more <hi><U+017F>weet</hi>
mouth, which was <U+017F>o much the more <U+017F>weet, becau<U+017F>e it
a<U+017F><U+017F>ured me, not onely that <U+017F>he was convinced of the
honor and integrity of my preten<U+017F>ions, but al<U+017F>o, of the
reality of her affections to me. Heavens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my body, cannot be contained within the angu<U+017F>t limits
of expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. My <U+017F>elf was too narrow to contain my
<U+017F>elf. I could almo<U+017F>t have imagined I had been in a
dream, but that <U+017F>uch dreams to me were unu<U+017F>ual.
Exce<U+017F>s of contentment <U+017F>topped the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of our
<U+017F>peech, but ki<U+017F><U+017F>es and embraces were the language of
our hearts, wherein we both <U+017F>trove to be mo<U+017F>t eloquent,
and each word or <U+017F>entence from either <U+017F>trugling for
birth, was <U+017F>mothered with a ki<U+017F>s, and became abortive.
Mutual promi<U+017F>es and engagements were made each to
other. Nothing we wanted to the con<U+017F>ummation of
our joys, but the joyning of us in Marriage, who were
in<U+017F>eparably linked in affection; but, alas, this joy was
too great to la<U+017F>t long, the fates had otherwi<U+017F>e decreed;
and who can divert its <U+017F>tream, or break the Iron Chains
of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity? for thus it happened. Some two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day appointed, wherein a happy Hymen <U+017F>hould
Crown our de<U+017F>ires with <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, and our love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
with honor, the Kings birth-day was to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
with the greate<U+017F>t <U+017F>olemnity imaginable, <U+017F>uch
as befitted the dignity of the Prince, and the love of
the Subjects. All the Gallants of the City did re<U+017F>ort
to the Court at that time, to be both Actors and Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who appeared like <U+017F>o many radiant Stars in that
Sphere, receiving from, and adding lu<U+017F>tre to it. And
to avoid <U+017F>ingularity, I al<U+017F>o went, to wait upon <hi>Florinda,</hi>
not imagining the Kings birth-day <U+017F>hould be the death
of all my joy and happine<U+017F>s. Nothing but Tiltings and
Turnaments, Maskings and Dancings, Mu<U+017F>ick, and all
delights that the heart of men could either de<U+017F>ire or
devi<U+017F>e, the Court did abound in; <U+017F>o that it <U+017F>eemed an
earthly Paradi<U+017F>e. And that which added the greate<U+017F>t
glory to the day, was the dazling train of beauties that
did attend upon the Queen, who<U+017F>e glory made every

Eye greedy to gaze upon them, among<U+017F>t whom was
<hi>Florinda,</hi> who appeared like <hi>Diana</hi> among<U+017F>t her
Nymphs. Never did Eye vowed to <hi>Cupids</hi> <U+017F>ervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a more lovely face. A <hi>Tin<U+017F>ell</hi> veil did <U+017F>hrowd
her locks, and <U+017F>trove to cover what it could not hide.
Her <U+017F>parkling Eyes darted flames of love into each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
heart, and <U+017F>eemed to be like two Cry<U+017F>tall
thrones, where <hi>Cnpid</hi> <U+017F>ate triumphant; neither was the
King him<U+017F>elf able to with<U+017F>tand the<U+017F>e beautiful a<U+017F><U+017F>aults,
but of a King became her Subject; and though the
Queen had beauty enough to have quencht any <U+017F>uch
di<U+017F>loyal flames, yet when the King compared her with
<hi>Florinda,</hi> <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed but for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oyl of <hi>Florinda</hi>'s beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Great enquiry he made after her, who and what
<U+017F>he was; and though every one was able to <U+017F>atisfie him
in that, yet none was able to give contentment but
<hi>Florinda,</hi> whom the next day he <U+017F>ent for to the Court, by
a Gentleman of his own Bed-chamber. Accordingly
<U+017F>he went, little thinking her loyalty to her Prince <U+017F>hould
contradict her fidelity to her Lover. All <U+017F>he feared was,
le<U+017F>t this unexpected accident might cau<U+017F>e me to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect
her con<U+017F>tancy. But Kings as they cannot brook Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors
in rule and power, <U+017F>o neither will they admit
of Rivals in affection. So it was wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h King <hi>Aca<U+017F>tus,</hi>
who hearing not onely how we affected each other,
but al<U+017F>o how deeply we were contracted, it did at fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>tartle him, and cau<U+017F>e his love to degenerate into jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie.
But remembring the <U+017F>word he bare was <U+017F>harp
enough to cut in <U+017F>under <U+017F>uch Gordian Knots, and
thereby able to make him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ole Monarch of her,
who ruled over <U+017F>o many hearts, he <U+017F>entenced me to
bani<U+017F>hment, the better to <U+017F>ecure her to his po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion,
who already po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed his heart. But all the while
this tempe<U+017F>t was gathering over my head, did I remain
ignorant, till an Officer from the King, came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52129:16"/>
me with his Maje<U+017F>ties command, how that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pain of death I mu<U+017F>t not be <U+017F>een within any part of
his dominions after ten days. He had no <U+017F>ooner deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

which was in <hi>Medu<U+017F>ae's</hi> head to metamorphi<U+017F>e all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
into <U+017F>tone, had been in him; So did I remain
more like a lively <U+017F>tatue, than a living man. At length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
my <U+017F>elf, I told him that I would obey the Kings
command, but I knew not the rea<U+017F>on of that <U+017F>entence;
He an<U+017F>wered, neither did he, but the Kings will. I was
no <U+017F>ooner parted from him, but with all <U+017F>peed po<U+017F><U+017F>ible,
I went to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> hou<U+017F>e, thinking to acquaint <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi>
with the Kings Decree, and the hope of having
her partaker with me in my exile, did for a while ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea<U+017F>e

what degree of <U+017F>orrow was I <hi>tran<U+017F>ported?</hi> my bani<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from my Country, was wor<U+017F>e than death; but
to be exil'd from her, was wor<U+017F>e than ten thou<U+017F>and
deaths. However, before my departure, I re<U+017F>olved to
take my la<U+017F>t farewell of her; and to that end, with a
heart <U+017F>wollen with grief, I went to the Court, but
when I came there, <U+017F>ooner might any one have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a rape upon <hi>Danae,</hi> when <U+017F>he was inclo<U+017F>ed

When I <U+017F>aw her, how did I at once ble<U+017F>s and cur<U+017F>e my

to <U+017F>ee her in that <hi><U+017F>orrowful</hi> condition, more unhappy

            <p>Thus for a while, not being able to part, we tarried,

beheld at once a <U+017F>pectacle of pity and revenge, a young
Knight be<U+017F>et with four armed men, threatning him with
the cruelle<U+017F>t of death, both in words and looks. His
youth, beauty and valour would have moved any that

<hi>Periander</hi> leaving them weltering in their gore,
turned to <hi>Athalus,</hi> for <U+017F>o was the young Knight named,
thinking to revive his dying Spirits, and to acquaint
him with the death of his enemies. But <hi>Athalus</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

which was not far di<U+017F>tant from them, <U+017F>o that <hi>Periander</hi>
accerting of the invitation, they in a <U+017F>hort time there

The Pillars on which the Gate was hung, were made
of pure<U+017F>t Marble, on the top of which were ingraven
Gilded Griffons, who<U+017F>e Wings <U+017F>pread with the <U+017F>hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

often would he extoll <hi>Matilda,</hi> but then when he

though I was both innocent and ignorant. All my

His Hair hung in waving Curles upon his

Youth, not willing to lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a guide; but the Youth
not knowing what he was, bent his Bow, and was

him to forbear, and told him he was one in di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, and
that he was dragged by Villains into this wood, whence
he knew not how to return. The Youth told him that
he was as unacquainted as him<U+017F>elf in tho<U+017F>e de<U+017F>erts, and
therefore could not direct him, but he would lead him
to his Cave, where there dwelt an old Hermite that
would and could a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him. So following his Convoy,
in a <U+017F>hort time he arrived at the Hermits Cell, who<U+017F>e

tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e earthly Souls are involved in the Worlds

carved his Man<U+017F>ion out of a Rock, with <U+017F>uch curio<U+017F>ity, as
would have puzled the greate<U+017F>t Arti<U+017F>ts to have imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Underneath there crept a little Rivulet, which
with its bubling <U+017F>treams bedewed the Rock with Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tal

<U+017F>eemed to bid him welcome. But entring in, he <U+017F>aw
the Hermit apparalled in a Gown of Grey, kneeling

Gravity was written in his looks, Devotion in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tures,
and Age in both, for his <U+017F>nowy Hairs, and <U+017F>haking

<U+017F>ighing Heart, and <U+017F>orrowful Countenance are better

would <U+017F>ay, which cannot, I hope, but be <U+017F>atisfactory.
The Hermit an<U+017F>wered him, that he knew no errour he
had commited that needed an Apology, except it were
for making a groundle<U+017F>s Apology, and that if he had
committed any offence, it was only again<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf,
offence being grounded upon injury, and it was him<U+017F>elf
alone that he had injured, by deferting the healing of
his wounds by his di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e. With that the tears de<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
in <U+017F>howres upon <hi>Perianders</hi> cheeks. Ah <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalus,</hi>

            <p>This <U+017F>udden <hi><U+017F>orrowful Rapture</hi> of <U+017F>orrow, filled the
Hermit with as much Amazement, as <hi>Periander</hi> was

<U+017F>o the <U+017F>adne<U+017F><U+017F>e bred Pity; <U+017F>o that he wept, as if
the heat of <hi>Perianders</hi> pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had thawed his frozen
Age into Tears. At length his compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<hi>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was not converted, but</hi> encrea<U+017F>ed to a de<U+017F>ire
of knowing the cau<U+017F>e of his <U+017F>orrow. Alas (<U+017F>aid he)
what can I do that am thus informed by the Ears one
way, and by the Eyes another? you tell me Sacrifice
mu<U+017F>t give place to Mercy, and yet you Sacrifice your
<U+017F>elf to Cruelty; for what greater Cruelty can there be
than to be Unmerciful to tho<U+017F>e over whom Fortune
hath exerci<U+017F>ed her greate<U+017F>t cruelty? do you not <U+017F>ee
how the Bloud trickles down in Streams, and your

Armour <U+017F>eems to weep in tears of Bloud for your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
to your <U+017F>elf, and your Wounds like <U+017F>o many
mouths intreating for mercy? And with that the
Hermit was going to dre<U+017F>s <hi>Perianders</hi> wounds, but
he would not permit him, until he had gone and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<hi>Athalus</hi>'s body into the Cave, where after
they had chafed his Limbs, the Hermit took down a
little gla<U+017F>s, within who<U+017F>e tran<U+017F>parent wall there was
inclo<U+017F>ed a Spirit of <U+017F>uch a reviving Vertue, as it was
able to recal the <hi>revolted</hi> <U+017F>en<U+017F>es.</p>
            <p>After they had <hi>transfu<U+017F>ed</hi> <U+017F>ome few drops thereof
into him, his <hi>panting Brea<U+017F>t</hi> faintly began to beat, his
<hi>unclouded</hi> eyes that had been Eclip<U+017F>ed with a veil of
darkne<U+017F>s, began weakly to <U+017F>truggle with the <hi>over-daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
light. <hi>Periander</hi> <U+017F>eeing this, began to faint with
joy, but he was quickly revived with <hi>Athalus</hi> his fir<U+017F>t
<U+017F>aluting the light. Oh, <U+017F>aid he, where am I? with
him, <U+017F>aid <hi>Periander,</hi> who is ha<U+017F>tening to dye with you,
<U+017F>ince it is wor<U+017F>e than Death to Live, while you are

<U+017F>ince it is the wor<U+017F>t of deaths to dye while you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.
But <hi>Athalus</hi> who had hardly <U+017F>o much life in
him as to perceive he had life, and yet <U+017F>o much as to
di<U+017F>cern that he was inclo<U+017F>ed within a dark place,
which had only <U+017F>o much light in it, as to let them <U+017F>ee
they were in darkne<U+017F>s, (for <U+017F>o the Hermit had made

<hi>Athalus</hi> his wounds, and cau<U+017F>e relap<U+017F>e,) and
finding that it was not inroll'd in the Records of his
memory, how he came there, he more and more grew
to a per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion that the former conceipt, that he was
alive, was but a deceit, that he and <hi>Periander</hi> were
but Gho<U+017F>ts, and remembring how that with his life
he had lo<U+017F>t <hi>Matilda,</hi> more precious to him than ten
thou<U+017F>and lives, he began to faint again, as though he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52129:25"/>
would dye to avoid Death, <hi>and his <U+017F>ences <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible
of in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility, grew weary of being <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible,</hi> and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
them<U+017F>elves fled as voluntary exiles from
their proper habitation. But the Hermit continuing
his charitable office, recovered him from the confines
of Death. But yet <U+017F>o <U+017F>trongly was he confirmed in
that apprehen<U+017F>ion, that he imagined the Cave either
his Tomb, or el<U+017F>e a dark entrance into that Region of
darkne<U+017F>s, the Hermit to be Charon, and the River to
be the Stygian lake; the Gloomine<U+017F>s of the fir<U+017F>t, the
Gravity of the <U+017F>econd, and the whi<U+017F>pering Con<U+017F>pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the la<U+017F>t, <U+017F>eeming to combine together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him.</p>
            <p>And as the Fancy is not only capable to receive
and apprehend tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>pecies, which the external Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es,
as its Organs, convey into it from external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but al<U+017F>o to create Phanta<U+017F>mes within it <U+017F>elf,
which never had a being in Natnre, <U+017F>o did <hi>Athalus</hi> his
fancy repre<U+017F>ent to his eyes Legions of Gho<U+017F>ts, doomed
to their eternal habitations.</p>
            <p>But though his thoughts were thus filled with
<U+017F>hadows, yet were they not able to crowd <hi>Matilda</hi>
thence, but remembring how that in lo<U+017F>ing his life he
lo<U+017F>t her, and in lo<U+017F>ing her, he lo<U+017F>t the life of his life,
and which only made Life precious, and Death mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erable;
he fell to a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate lamenting his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till he was convinced by <hi>Perianders</hi> per<U+017F>ua<U+017F>ions,
and a more liberal acce<U+017F>s of light. And then the very
joy of his <U+017F>udden redemption from that Hell <hi>that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured</hi>
his mind, was <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>torative, that it was

fear is the mother of <U+017F>uper<U+017F>tition, as is apparent in him
who never thinks him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ecure, if the lea<U+017F>t more of

that fear, which his thoughts, ever mu<U+017F>ing upon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightful
matters, doth repre<U+017F>ent unto him, hath the
lea<U+017F>t po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of event. And therefore ever <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that each dream was an Oracle, and the Screech of a
Night Raven, an Omen and pre<U+017F>age of <U+017F>ome future
di<U+017F>mall event. This over-fond and contemptible fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne<U+017F>s
rendered him not only odious, but de<U+017F>picable
to his people, which he daily more and more percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<U+017F>lighting the former, re<U+017F>olved to countermine the

would not love him, they <U+017F>hould fear him, and their
dread of him <U+017F>hould counterpoi<U+017F>e their hatted. In the
one, as in all things el<U+017F>e, <U+017F>hewing him<U+017F>elf tyrannical,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52129:26"/>
in the other, as in nothing el<U+017F>e, truly Royal; there
being nothing more aver<U+017F>e to a generous and noble <U+017F>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
e<U+017F>pecially if refined by honor and advancement, than
to be <U+017F>lighted; and this he ab<U+017F>olutely determined to
free him<U+017F>elf from, by puni<U+017F>hing all in whom there was
the appearance of a crime, and where there was none,
excellency became a fault, by being oppo<U+017F>ite to him,
into whom to have di<U+017F>tilled any Vertue, had been to
have de<U+017F>troyed the very con<U+017F>titution and temperament
of his nature.</p>
            <p>And thus a more <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible <U+017F>ervitude came in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly
upon that people, which <hi>Hiarbas</hi> King of <hi>Caonia,</hi> his
Son-in-law, by the marriage with <hi>Melana,</hi> daughter to
<hi>Formo<U+017F>a,</hi> a man both ambitious and politick, and a
continued enemy to <hi>Agis</hi> having intelligence of, and
by means of his Spies, diving into the temper and
<U+017F>pirits of that people, who though they were lovers of
loyalty and fidelity, yet haters of tyranny, and were
not able to brook <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ervil <U+017F>ubjection, re<U+017F>olved
now to improve his opportunity, and at once both to
free him<U+017F>elf of jealou<U+017F>ies and fears, and <U+017F>ubvert the
whole Kingdom of <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>aly,</hi> by diverting the <U+017F>tream
of the affections of the people, from the King, and of
the King from the people, and converting it into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the working of his de<U+017F>igns: And to that end, he had

divi<U+017F>ions, by condemning the King to the
people, and emblazoning and pourtraying his vices,
and their <U+017F>lavery, the more to encrea<U+017F>e their hatred and
contempt towards him, and de<U+017F>ire of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iberty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agis,</hi> though he had many enemies, yet he wanted
not <U+017F>ome friends, who acquainted him with the<U+017F>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminings.
The lea<U+017F>t whi<U+017F>per of any danger, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm
loud enough, to arou<U+017F>e him out of any <U+017F>ecurity, if
it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him, ever to have been guilty of that,
a thing <U+017F>o di<U+017F>agreeing to his temper. And therefore he
intercepts <hi>Hiarbas</hi> de<U+017F>igns, by <U+017F>ending an Emba<U+017F><U+017F>ador
to denounce War again<U+017F>t him, and to tell him, that
he would <U+017F>ave him the labor of <U+017F>o long a March into
his Kingdom, for he would vi<U+017F>it him ere long in his
own. Though umbrages and light fanta<U+017F>tick jealou<U+017F>ies
created by cowardly timorous fancies, are too narrow a
Ba<U+017F>is, to found a quarrel upon, yet a preventive War is
both ju<U+017F>t and honorable, and no way di<U+017F><U+017F>onant from all
principles of Policy.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he had <U+017F>carce di<U+017F>patched his Emba<U+017F><U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,

for that day, he brought forth, and to the admiration

Fortune he thus unhappily fell into his hands. But
<hi>Agis</hi> not being able to <U+017F>urvive the lo<U+017F>s of his Kingdom,
and having his heart broken with extremity of grief, he

And as a Tower, who<U+017F>e parts may be <U+017F>ound and <U+017F>trong,

can be other right pretended, but what is carved out by

And that he might for ever remove away all grounds

what is there that can de<U+017F>ervedly merit the title of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ert,
that is not mo<U+017F>t tran<U+017F>cendently in her? yet fearing

            <p>And thus did this Politicke man improve his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,

one day as he ran <U+017F>o far in the pur<U+017F>ute of a Deer, that he
knew not which way to return, but wandring to and

was no le<U+017F>s a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed at the beauty of the youth, than
amazed to <U+017F>ee him in <U+017F>uch an unfrequented place; for
during thirty years that I <U+017F>pent in this <U+017F>olitary place,
I never beheld the face of any here before him, whom
after my mean manner, I have entertained, for <U+017F>ome
years, not being able to direct him to the Fore<U+017F>ters

            <p>This <U+017F>tory told with <U+017F>o much gravity and deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<U+017F>o moved <hi>Periander</hi> to compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, as that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved

there by all means endeavor his re<U+017F>tauration, which
however if he could not effect, yet, he would render
him<U+017F>elf renowned for his high Attempt, and therefore
ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed his Fortune, which though hitherto had been
adver<U+017F>e to him, yet now had pre<U+017F>ented him with <U+017F>uch
an happy occa<U+017F>ion, and <U+017F>o fit a place for a Theatre,
whereon to Act the Heroick Exploits which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
tran<U+017F>acted within his thoughts. Neither was
<hi>Athalus</hi> le<U+017F>s de<U+017F>irous of acting a part in that honorable
enterpri<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o much of his <U+017F>pirits had not <U+017F>teamed forth,
from tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>treams of bloud, as to enfeeble both his

any action that required valour for its perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
as ever, but the weakne<U+017F>s of his body would not
permit him to undertake any thing proportionable to
the greatne<U+017F>s of his mind. For though the care and
diligence of the Hermit had brought him from a de<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
of life, yet not out of danger of death, <U+017F>hould he
be too negligent of him<U+017F>elf; <U+017F>o that with a <U+017F>eeming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing

when nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>hould require, a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t them with Forces
from thence. And though it was the wound uncured
in his body that was the pretence, it was chiefly the

which nothing could heal but a Sympathetick Plai<U+017F>ter,

return, if he will ever find ea<U+017F>e, which accordingly he
determined to do.</p>

The Hermit an<U+017F>wered, that as his de<U+017F>erts were

            <p>Thus after <U+017F>ome ceremonies pa<U+017F>t between them, they

            <p>The<U+017F>e three noble Con<U+017F>orts having travelled for
<U+017F>ome few days together, came at length to a parting
way, which might properly be <U+017F>o called, for it was
the means of parting <hi>Athalus</hi> from the other two, whom

            <p>Travelling along one <U+017F>corching day, the Sun darted
his rayes with <U+017F>uch vehement violence as that they
were forced to betake them<U+017F>elves to a neer adjoyning
<U+017F>hady Grove for protection, where the <U+017F>preading
boughs <U+017F>o embraced each other, as if they had combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together to exclude the Suns proud beams from
entring there; where being invited by the plea<U+017F>ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
of the place, and their own weari<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre<U+017F>h

pulled their bits out of their mouths, turned them
to feed upon the Gra<U+017F>s, which there grew in great

murmurings of the <U+017F>weet bubling <U+017F>treams, and the

But long they had not yielded to <U+017F>leeps plea<U+017F>ing

<U+017F>udden <U+017F>hriek, which pierced and rent the air with
<U+017F>uch a dividing <U+017F>hrilne<U+017F>s, as plainly appeared it came
from a heart pierced, <hi>rent and divided</hi> with <U+017F>orrow; and
withall <U+017F>o <U+017F>mall and clear, as they knew it came from

pre<U+017F>ently followed by a train of doleful groans<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
which pur<U+017F>ued it with hue and cry as a Thief for <U+017F>tealing
her joyes from her. They no <U+017F>ooner heard it, but
they aro<U+017F>e and guided their <U+017F>teps by the mournful
noi<U+017F>e, till they came to a place where they <U+017F>aw a

upon her elbow; Nature had painted her Face with

Sighs and Tears, and all made apparent, that <U+017F>orrow
had tuned her heart to <U+017F>o high a Key, that the <U+017F>trings
were near cracking. Loath they were to interrupt her,
and yet de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>erve her. At length they heard
her fetch a groan, and that <U+017F>econded by a <U+017F>igh, and
both u<U+017F>hered in the<U+017F>e words. Hard-hearted enemies!

And that if it lay in his power, no way el<U+017F>e to avail him,

a man (as I mu<U+017F>t needs <U+017F>ay) of incomparable worth;
though as I then thought, too unde<U+017F>erving for my

then the tears gu<U+017F>hed forth, but proceeding) the wealth
and honor of the re<U+017F>t <U+017F>o eclip<U+017F>ed his merits, and dazled

for her menial <U+017F>ervant, than a <U+017F>ervant in affection. But
I di<U+017F>liked him not <U+017F>o much as my Daughter liked him,

Oh what a thing were Woman, <U+017F>hould her vi<U+017F>age al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Never was any <hi>Chamelion</hi> or <hi>Proteus</hi> more <U+017F>ubject to
various mutabilities. But why do I blame the whole
Sex for the unfaithfulne<U+017F>s of one, and why do I blame
her for my own unworthine<U+017F>s? ah it was not her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<U+017F>tancy

Then once more I bid farewell to all my hopes, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well

my tongue falters, and my heart fails to <U+017F>peak the re<U+017F>t,
and then the tears began to glide down his Cheeks in
<U+017F>uch a liberal manner, that <hi>Periander</hi> could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear

Scarce had he concluded his lamentable relation of a

<hi>Pandion</hi> hath long been in love with a Nun, who by

whom came <U+017F>ixty Gentlemen and Squires, bearing two

to <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> <U+017F>ignifying that the power of his <U+017F>word
was inve<U+017F>ted with <U+017F>overaign authority; and the other
naked, as <hi>Pandions</hi> Lieutenant, betokening that as he
was unju<U+017F>tly <U+017F>tripped from his power by the <U+017F>word, <U+017F>o
he would defend his ju<U+017F>t right, naked, from any fal<U+017F>e
deluding glo<U+017F><U+017F>es, with the <U+017F>word.</p>
            <p>After them followed two Heralds clothed with the
Apparel of their Office, and carrying two Coates of
Arms, the one belonging to <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> being his Coat,
quartered with the Arms of the two Kingdoms of <hi>The<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aly</hi>
and <hi>Caonia,</hi> and the other <hi>Pandions</hi> Arms, quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

young Pages, in Vermilion Sattin, richly embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with Gold.</p>
            <p>The Lord Con<U+017F>table having <U+017F>urrounded the Camp,
and viewed it every where, he cau<U+017F>ed the Kings Heralds
to make this proclamation, in the name of King <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi>
that if Fortune <U+017F>hould incline to his adver<U+017F>e party,
and his Knights <U+017F>hould be conquered, he pronounced
freedom for any hardy Knight (excepting tho<U+017F>e appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to guard his per<U+017F>on) that out of loyalty to their
King, and to defend his ju<U+017F>t Authority, and to merit
honor, would hazard his per<U+017F>on again<U+017F>t the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
to encounter them, at the holding of the Kings
golden Rod, and if he overcame, he <U+017F>hould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
according to his high merits. The <U+017F>ame,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52129:63"/>
               <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> was al<U+017F>o proclamed by <hi>Pandions</hi>
Herald.</p>
            <p>Then entred the Combatants into the Li<U+017F>ts, where
after the <U+017F>ounding of the Trumpets, and other warlike
noi<U+017F>es, that were the terrible preludes to a more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and ill-agreeing Mu<U+017F>ick, of breaking of Lances,
cla<U+017F>hing of Armour, neighing of hor<U+017F>es, and re<U+017F>ound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of blows that pre<U+017F>ently followed. The <hi>Hiarbian</hi>
Knights, as <U+017F>corning that their valour <U+017F>hould be tryed
by condemned Rebels, who were rather de<U+017F>perate than
couragious, gave them <U+017F>o fierce a rancounter, as if they
meant at once to <U+017F>wallow them up with an over-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tyde of valour. But this torrent of fury was <U+017F>oon
<U+017F>topped by a more violent Cataract of rage from the
<hi>Pandionians,</hi> who fought for their lives, but the other
onely for their honors, <U+017F>o that the <U+017F>hivered Lances
<U+017F>lew in pieces, <U+017F>ome one way, and <U+017F>ome another, as if
they had <U+017F>led to avoid the madne<U+017F>s of their guiders.
But the place was <U+017F>oon <U+017F>upplyed by the mercile<U+017F>s
<U+017F>words, wherewith they <U+017F>o minced each other, <U+017F>teeping
their fle<U+017F>h in one anothers blood, as if each had been
an infernal Cook <U+017F>ent from Hell, to dre<U+017F>s a Breakfa<U+017F>t
for <hi>Pluto.</hi> So that terror it <U+017F>elf grew more terrible, by
being dre<U+017F><U+017F>ed in a terrible garb. The glittering of
<U+017F>words, the <U+017F>hining of gilded Armor, that at fir<U+017F>t
made terror it <U+017F>elf delightful, being now totally defiled
and defaced with blood, du<U+017F>t, wounds, and fractured
bones, inclo<U+017F>ed with mangled fle<U+017F>h, and that again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with broken Armor.</p>
            <p>In fine fortune had long been dubious and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
whom to be<U+017F>tow the victory on, till at length
<hi>Zethus</hi> and <hi>Alcanor</hi> the two principal <hi>Hiarbian</hi> Knights,
being too confident of their valour, that had rendred
them triumphant, over <U+017F>o many victorious Champions,
too frequently ingaged them<U+017F>elves, in the mid<U+017F>t of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52129:64"/>
their enemies, and never retreated without <U+017F>ome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
markes of their Antagoni<U+017F>ts re<U+017F>olute fury, untill at
la<U+017F>t their lives <U+017F>treamed out with their blood; which
the other three perceiving, as if with them, they had
lo<U+017F>t their valour and all <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of honor, <U+017F>eeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves
exceeded both in number and re<U+017F>olution, they
retyred, endeavoring to <U+017F>ave their lives, though with
the irreparable lo<U+017F>s of their honor. King <hi>Hiarbas</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erving
this, waved his golden rod, whereupon came
<U+017F>everal Knights, ru<U+017F>hing into the Li<U+017F>ts, contending
which <U+017F>hould be foremo<U+017F>t; but <hi>Danpion</hi> watching his
opportunity came in <U+017F>oone<U+017F>t, <U+017F>o that by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Lord High Con<U+017F>table, he had the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and the Combat was allotted him, with the<U+017F>e
conditions, That he was to fight with them <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and not at once, and that if he conquered he
<U+017F>hould not be ingaged to incounter with any more than
one fre<U+017F>h Knight, that would undertake to defend
<hi>Pandions</hi> intere<U+017F>t. Then entering the Li<U+017F>ts, apparell'd
in sky-coloured Armour, where the firmament <U+017F>eemed

peep through, and <U+017F>teal a view of the Earth, <U+017F>o to the

The Trumpets being <U+017F>ounded, <hi>Scodius</hi> came forth, but
in <U+017F>uch a bloudy po<U+017F>ture, and <U+017F>o deformed with wounds,

a man or a mon<U+017F>ter, but ere they had exchanged many
blows, <hi>Danpion</hi> perceiving him<U+017F>elf much to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
him, di<U+017F>daining to conquer a conquered man,
referred the victory to his hor<U+017F>e, who enraged with
<U+017F>ome blows he received, fell into his Career, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-turned
both <hi>Scodius</hi> and his hor<U+017F>e, and with his

            <p>The <U+017F>econd, which was <hi>Gentius,</hi> appeared in the

better aim at his blind <U+017F>ide, <U+017F>o that having a dexterous
and <U+017F>teady hand to direct his hor<U+017F>e, and his hor<U+017F>e as
nimble to ob<U+017F>erve the motions of his hand, he ere <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>

had he not begged it of <hi>Danpions</hi> hand.</p>
            <p>The third that came was <hi>Ma<U+017F><U+017F>urius,</hi> who encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>Danpion,</hi> with another manner of violence than
his predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors, his confidence and re<U+017F>olution being
chiefly augmented by the prophecy of a blind A<U+017F>trolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
who <U+017F>ome few days before had told him, that he
<U+017F>hould dye by an intemperate <U+017F>atisfying of an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
thir<U+017F>t, and therefore fearle<U+017F>s of <hi>Danpions</hi> <U+017F>word,
he boldly and fiercely charged him, confiding in that
prediction: but his own ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s <U+017F>oon unridled the
meaning, for <hi>Danpion</hi> gave <U+017F>uch a wound overthwart
his mouth, from whence <U+017F>uch an inundation of blood
<U+017F>treamed down his throat, that having two mouthes,

            <p>Then came <hi>Hypenor,</hi> who a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted <hi>Danpion</hi> with

his great worth had made him ambitious of having <U+017F>uch

lu<U+017F>tre of their merits, that had dazled him, and
obtruded an erroneous e<U+017F>timation of him, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
his over-peircing judgement would not entertain.
And <U+017F>ince your Maje<U+017F>ty is plea<U+017F>ed (<U+017F>aid he) to term me
a Phoenix, although its not my happine<U+017F>s to merit it by

the rays of your commands <U+017F>hall enkindle, and I
<U+017F>hould account <U+017F>uch an immolation, as the greate<U+017F>t fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
the heavens could be<U+017F>tow, it being the onely way

command (an<U+017F>wered the King) to remain with me, be
for an exploration of your obedience, which you <U+017F>o
highly profe<U+017F>s. Let me be <U+017F>tigmatized with an eternal

in Court or Kingdom, without <hi>Danpions</hi> con<U+017F>ent and

For one morning when <hi>Octavia</hi> had re<U+017F>olved to

Many per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ions you may conceive were <U+017F>uperfluous
to me, who de<U+017F>ired nothing more than this happy
means of relea<U+017F>ment. Therefore thus attended, I

Palace, untill I perceived a place where I thought an

time and place <U+017F>eemed to invite to contemplation,
and <U+017F>o commanding him to wait untill I came, I wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
out; but when I thought my <U+017F>elf out of his fight,
I ran to a Town adjacent, whence the next day I went
to range the wide univer<U+017F>e in <U+017F>earch of my dear <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
and hearing of his abode in <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>alia,</hi> hither I
fled on the wings of Love, and by the means of <U+017F>ome
Ladies in the court, who have <U+017F>hewed extraordinary
favour to me, I got to be an attendant to the Prince<U+017F>s
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> who is <U+017F>o male affected to the Male
<U+017F>ex, that <U+017F>he will not admit any to have a view of
her, not retain any of her Ladies of Honour, whom <U+017F>he

now I am chained with as great a bondage as before,
though not <U+017F>o dangerous and di<U+017F>honourable. And as
for my happy meeting with the Crown of my joyes
<hi>Periander,</hi> it was this evening, that walking out to

               <hi>Amphigenia</hi> that had attended to this Song with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, admiring whence the Mu<U+017F>ick
came, for by rea<U+017F>on of the thickne<U+017F>s of the hangings,
and largene<U+017F>s of the room, the Lutes <U+017F>weet Airs were
not <U+017F>o cleerly conveyed to her ear: But directing her

behind which <hi>Danpion</hi> <U+017F>at; where calling for <hi>Florinda,</hi>
demanded of her, if <U+017F>he knew whence tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>trains
<U+017F>hould come. Who replyed, that it mu<U+017F>t be <U+017F>ome
Angel that was turned inamorate, and fled to her

            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> hearing <hi>Amphigenia</hi> make <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trict inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ha<U+017F>ted thence, le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be di<U+017F>covered; but
now the flames of Love burned with more vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
than before; <U+017F>o that the torment had been in<U+017F>uppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
had it not been fanned and cooled with hope,
which began to breath upon him with <U+017F>ome gentle
gu<U+017F>ts. For having <U+017F>uch a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, where undi<U+017F>covered
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52129:77"/>
to any, he might have re<U+017F>ort to her Chamber, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved
to per<U+017F>onate <U+017F>ome Intelligence, till he might
have free admittance to her pre<U+017F>ence, which in time he
thought he might be able to effect, by rea<U+017F>on of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda's</hi>
intimacy with her, who by her in<U+017F>inuations,
would confirm in <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s apprehen<U+017F>ions what he
<U+017F>hould do, not to be delu<U+017F>ions, but realities. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
the next night after, when he thought the time
of night might invite fair <hi>Amphigenia</hi> to refre<U+017F>h her <U+017F>elf
with <U+017F>weet <U+017F>lumber, he took his Lute (as before) and
<U+017F>oftly <U+017F>tole to her Chamber. But as he went, his mind
was filled with di<U+017F>tracting thoughts, How well (did he
<U+017F>ay) doth this blind pa<U+017F><U+017F>age re<U+017F><U+017F>emble tho<U+017F>e blinder
paths I thus tread to my happine<U+017F>s! The<U+017F>e dark wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and craggy turnings, that this Vault abounds in,
methinks light<U+017F>omly repre<U+017F>ents the inex<U+017F>ucerable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and inextricable intricacies, I am forced to
pa<U+017F>s thorough, and mu<U+017F>t be involved in, ere I can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at any glimmerings of hope. But my comfort is,
that, as this conducts to an <hi>Elyzium,</hi> <U+017F>uch a one, as
the Gods would exchange theirs for, <U+017F>uch a one as the
Antick Poets in<U+017F>pired with a prophetick as well as
Poetick fury did but typifie in their fictions; <U+017F>o the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
windings of my unhappy love, when my Cloudy
fortune <U+017F>hall unmask her dusky face, will at length
be unwound, and come to a bottom, where they'l
centre in an <hi>Elyzium</hi> of happine<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>Being come to the end of the Cave, he perceived
<hi>Amphigenia</hi> fa<U+017F>t a<U+017F>leep, her Wax Taper burning by
her. As <U+017F>he lay his eyes carved <U+017F>uch ravi<U+017F>hing <U+017F>weets,
as tran<U+017F>ported with the violence of <U+017F>o many Darts, he
thought he had attained the Zenith of his felicity. The
Pillow ble<U+017F>t with a ki<U+017F>s from her Cheeks, as pregnant
with delight, <U+017F>welled on either <U+017F>ide. Her eyes Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed
in <U+017F>leeps dark veil, <U+017F>hewed lifes triumph in the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52129:78"/>
Map of death. Her hand contended with the Lawn
for whitene<U+017F>s, and being partly covered with it looked
like a Lilly through pure<U+017F>t Cry<U+017F>tall. A lock that had
<U+017F>tollen from its <U+017F>weet pri<U+017F>on, folded in cloudy curls lay
dallying with her breath, <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>triving to get a
ki<U+017F>s, and then repul<U+017F>ed flew back, <U+017F>ometimes obtaining
its de<U+017F>ired bli<U+017F>s, and then as rapt with joy, retreats in
wanton caperings. Her body that lay arayed, or rather
di<U+017F>arayed in a thin Smock, wrought with blew <U+017F>ilk and
<U+017F>ilver, ob<U+017F>cured not her skin, but rather made it appear
the lovelier, if lovelier it could be. Her brea<U+017F>ts at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
di<U+017F>played, were of <U+017F>o pure a whitene<U+017F>s, as if ones
eye through the tran<U+017F>parent skin, had viewed the milky
trea<U+017F>ures they inclo<U+017F>ed. Her Violet veins that <U+017F>treamed
in branched Rivers, <U+017F>eemed like Azure paths in a milky
heaven. This confluence of delights, put <hi>Danpion</hi>
be<U+017F>ides him<U+017F>elf for a while, but recollecting his
thoughts, he took his Lute, and tuning it in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ort
with his Soul, in a Love rapture <U+017F>ang this Song.</p>

This Letter <U+017F>he gave unto one of her principal
Pages, commanding that with all diligence, care, and

But now to acquaint you with the raging fury, that
even di<U+017F>tracted <hi>Danpion,</hi> when <hi>Florinda</hi> told him of
<hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s hatred, and what <U+017F>he had done to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen<U+017F>e
her Father again<U+017F>t him; I had need to dip my

<hi>Hercules,</hi> when he had put on <hi>Deianira</hi>'s invenomed

he was unhappy, but fallen from <U+017F>o high a pitch of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine<U+017F>s,
and that through his ra<U+017F>h folly, and that not
onely he had incen<U+017F>ed the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of his heart, but the
Ma<U+017F>ter of his life, and by one incon<U+017F>iderate action at
once cut off all hopes of ever attaining that happine<U+017F>s
he promi<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf, both in his Throne, and in his
Bed.</p>
            <p>But this tempe<U+017F>t la<U+017F>ted not long, for though he had
not <hi>Socrates</hi> his compo<U+017F>ure of <U+017F>pirit, under all fortunes
to remain the <U+017F>ame; yet he had <U+017F>uch a power over his
Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as they <U+017F>eldom raged beyond <U+017F>uppre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, or
could claim <U+017F>uch a predominancy, but he would make
them <U+017F>ubmit to his Rea<U+017F>on, as now appeared. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ulting
with his thoughts, how he <U+017F>hould prevent this

<hi>Florinda</hi> would prove his friend, but yet <U+017F>eem his

            <p>The King, when he had received the Letter, and
read the Contents, Heavens! how did he lift up his

he) what dares not man attempt? Faithle<U+017F>s <hi>Danpion!</hi>
is this the requital for my unparallel'd goodne<U+017F>s to
thee? is this thy gratitude? how am I abu<U+017F>ed through
fond credulity? is it not enough that I have a publike
adver<U+017F>ary, that daily incroaches upon my honor, and
<U+017F>eeks to u<U+017F>urp my Royal Power and Dignity, but I
mu<U+017F>t have a private Pioner to undermine them all? but
no matter, Ile make him know, that Kings have thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts
to hurl at tho<U+017F>e that dare to mount the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
of Maje<U+017F>ty, and take the reigns of Soveraignty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their pre<U+017F>umptuous hands, And <U+017F>ince he dare to
Arouze my anger, he <U+017F>hall <U+017F>oon find its Lion-like
roarings <U+017F>hall awake him, out of his dream of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
dignity, and then hee'l wi<U+017F>h his ambitious thoughts
had flown at lower di<U+017F>tance.</p>
            <p>Thus the King <U+017F>tormed for a while, but recovering
him<U+017F>elf, he began to con<U+017F>ider, that it was not <U+017F>afe to

ready to be beleagured with a potent Army;
and therefore he had more need endeavour union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
his men, and by that means, to fortifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
again<U+017F>t his common enemy, than to dimini<U+017F>h his
<U+017F>trength, by augmenting and fomenting more divi<U+017F>ions,
which he feared would follow, if he <U+017F>hould on the
<U+017F>udden totally degrade him, and confer his honor on
another.</p>
            <p>And therefore to avoid this <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi>
he re<U+017F>olves to couch his re<U+017F>olutions underneath his <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
thoughts, and <U+017F>end for <hi>Danpion</hi> from the Palace,
and put him upon <U+017F>omething that could not be effected
without the lo<U+017F>s of his honor or life, or both. And
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52129:84"/>
this way he counted the more <U+017F>ecure, remembring,
that <U+017F>uch Court Minions, that like Stars of the greate<U+017F>t

            <p>To pro<U+017F>ecute his intents, he <U+017F>ends for <hi>Danpion,</hi> who
in obedience to his <U+017F>ummons, marches from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and as he thought from all his honors, hopes and
preferments, but being of an unconquerable <U+017F>pirit,
bears it with as much magnanimity as he was able, and
comes to the Kings Camp; but above and beyond all
his hopes and expectations, the King looks upon him
with a <U+017F>mooth brow, and tells him, he had found him
to be a man of an impavid <U+017F>pirit, and greedy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,
and therefore he had <U+017F>ent for him, to perform
a piece of <U+017F>ervice, the very attempt whereof would
redound to his great honor, but the execution of it,
would not only crown him with immortal fame, but
be highly advantageous to the Kingdom; <hi>Danpion</hi> <U+017F>ee-<U+017F>uch
an unexpected event, began in his thoughts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ult
over this re<U+017F>ult of Fortune, and thus replyed,
Great Sir (<U+017F>aid he) I were unworthy of either life, or
honor, <U+017F>hould I refu<U+017F>e, at your commands, to part with
either, <U+017F>ince to your exceeding munificence I owe
more than both; neither can all I were able to do,
could I accompli<U+017F>h more than <hi>Hercules,</hi> return <U+017F>uch

and fetch <hi>Atlas</hi> thence, to conquer the Rebels
your enemies, though your valour needs it not, yet
were it your commands, I would do it, or dye in the

            <p>Then (<U+017F>aid <hi>Hiarbas)</hi> I am informed that <hi>Pandion</hi> hath

            <p>
               <hi>Pandion</hi> being come with his Army in ken of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
draws them up into a Battalia, intending to

a brave Oration, to incourage them to fight, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
in per<U+017F>on marches before them into the field.
Where, as if the very fight of their enemies had been a

what <U+017F>he had writ, to be truth.</p>
            <p>She told him every circum<U+017F>tance of it, and how that
<hi>Florinda</hi> was come to her re<U+017F>cue, before he had fled

            <p>With that a Lady was pre<U+017F>ently di<U+017F>patched as a

de<U+017F>ired a few minutes conference with her in <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genias</hi>

<hi>Florinda</hi> obeys the <U+017F>ummons, and accompanies the

<U+017F>u<U+017F>pition: if his Maje<U+017F>ty would deign to honour their

that the King would plea<U+017F>e to counterfeit him<U+017F>elf
<U+017F>uddenly <U+017F>eized upon with a malignant di<U+017F>temper, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52129:88"/>
for a time retire him<U+017F>elf in his Chamber, and admit
none of his greate<U+017F>t favourites to wait upon him,
nor vi<U+017F>it him, but only the prince<U+017F>s his Daughter, and
her <U+017F>elf, that <U+017F>o there might be no grounds of <U+017F>u<U+017F>pici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for <hi>Danpion;</hi> and in conclu<U+017F>ion to feign him<U+017F>elf

that <U+017F>he had <U+017F>uch an influence upon him, by rea<U+017F>on
of more than ordinary affection that <hi>Danpion</hi> bare to
her, as in his pre<U+017F>ence to make him confe<U+017F>s to her,
if he had any thoughts tending to <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s di<U+017F>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or of di<U+017F>loyalty to the King.</p>
            <p>This advice was accepted of, both by <hi>Hiarbas</hi> and
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> and accordingly put in execution; So
that <U+017F>uddenly the ears of all were filled with the <U+017F>ad
news that the King was fallen dangerou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>ick. The

            <p>In fine, <hi>Danpion</hi> was <U+017F>ecretly informed that the King

skeu at <hi>Troilus</hi> and wi<U+017F>h that he was her Husband;

if he chanced to look awry, <U+017F>he thought pre<U+017F>ently it

Yes at fir<U+017F>t word, for by that ugly word No, <U+017F>he had
lo<U+017F>t many a well favoured <U+017F>uter, that would have had
her otherwi<U+017F>e. But hey, the joy there was when their
Father came and told them, that the<U+017F>e young men
were come to be their Husbands, and bid them be
kind to them; that is a very unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary command,
thought they. <hi>Phyllis</hi> <U+017F>he felt her heart wamble, and
pant, and keep <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tir in her, that <U+017F>he could not
re<U+017F>t in a place, but mu<U+017F>t needs hop up and down the

con<U+017F>ented, before <U+017F>he knew whether he would have her
or no. <hi>Arethu<U+017F>a</hi> was <U+017F>o netled, that <U+017F>he flung to and

that as his tother arm hung without a <U+017F>leeve, <U+017F>o this

with a champion, he flings away his Bill, and
falls down on his knees, ju<U+017F>t as the other had made
a <U+017F>hift to <U+017F>cramble upon his knees, and asks forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s,

With that the other fellow inraged, gives

had been a combat between the<U+017F>e one handed men on

who before he would fully pardon them, laid this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

the fellow that had <U+017F>o rudely affronted him, what was

one fine Somers-day, as you <U+017F>hou'd ha' <U+017F>een a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

of finding what I <U+017F>ought, I found what I <U+017F>ought
not, as well as <U+017F>ought not what I found; for <U+017F>tragling
up and down ju<U+017F>t like a <U+017F>tray'd <U+017F>heep after my <U+017F>port,
I hapned to e<U+017F>py in <hi>Thyr<U+017F>is</hi> Garden, a Bu<U+017F>h made of
Cupids Arrows, where <hi>Venus</hi> Doves had built their
ne<U+017F>ts, and poor I, ingrant of loves matters, thinking
cunningly to have catcht them ere they were aware,
as we do other birds, was cunningly caught my <U+017F>elf,
with the lime twigs of beauty; <U+017F>o that though I now
de<U+017F>ire what I found, yet I found not what I de<U+017F>ired:
and who d'ye think I found? why it was 'eene <hi>Phyllis,</hi>
amiable <hi>Phyllis,</hi> dainty fine <hi>Phyllis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phyllis</hi> with face fairer than any new wa<U+017F>hed Lamb,
with eyes black as Berry, and lips as red as Coral;
this <hi>Phyllis,</hi> I no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>aw her, but as if her look;
had bewitched me, I could not for my life re<U+017F>train my
eyes from <U+017F>tragling after her, but I mu<U+017F>t be looking at
her, though to my co<U+017F>t, I found, that every look (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought)
conveyed a piece of my heart, to her til at length
<U+017F>he monopoliz'd it all to her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>o that I minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but thinking of her, and neglecting my Sheep,
would walk all alone and talk of her, ne're caring what
a murrain became of my flock, for now I my <U+017F>elf was
become one of <hi>Cupids</hi> flock, and <hi>Phyllis</hi> eyes were the

<U+017F>heephooks wherewith he caught me, her mouth the
Tar-box, and her comforting words the Tar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he kept me from pining away with the Love-rot;
the pond where he daily wa<U+017F>ht my fleece was made of
tears, for indeed when I was by my <U+017F>elf, I could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but whine, as oft as I thought of <hi>Phyllis;</hi> and as
he daily wa<U+017F>hed me, <U+017F>o he daily fleeced me, that I
was become 'een nothing but skin and bone, that I
looked ju<U+017F>t like a Skillet (as Doctors call a man, after
they have picked his bones) <U+017F>o that when I came
among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t of my companions, they amazed got
about me like Birds about an Owl, and made je<U+017F>ts of
me, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>aid, I lookt as I had got the Murrain, and
would rub Tar over my face; others <U+017F>aid my bones
lookt like a <U+017F>et of keiles, and would to<U+017F>s their bowles at
me; and indeed I did look mo<U+017F>t piteou<U+017F>ly, for I have
often <U+017F>een my face in a Spring, but for all that, I in the
end obtained <hi>Phyllis</hi>'s love, and was to have been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to her, ju<U+017F>t as you came to the hou<U+017F>e, but a<U+017F><U+017F>oon
as you came, the ca<U+017F>e was altered, <hi>Phyllis</hi> looks coy
(for<U+017F>ooth) as though I were not good enough for an
husband for her, and <U+017F>he lookt for another-gates hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
than I, and the like. Whereupon (dy' <U+017F>ee) I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after you, who and what you were, and whether
you came to marry <hi>Phyllis</hi> or not, and among<U+017F>t my
neighbors, at length I heard, that you came to <U+017F>teal
away <hi>Thyr<U+017F>i<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> daughters privately, and no body know
of it, but the old man, who had con<U+017F>ented, and
brought you to his hou<U+017F>e for that purpo<U+017F>e, and the
young Maids, be <U+017F>ure you would not long <U+017F>tay for their

pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, that none of we dur<U+017F>t <U+017F>peak to them, the
Gentlewomen were grown <U+017F>o proud, whereupon (dy'

and my Fathers elde<U+017F>t Son and all, that I re<U+017F>olved to try

a touch with you, for I would have you to know, that
though you now were too hard for me, yet I could
make my party good with e're a young man of my

then the fellow began to puff, and look bigger
than ordnary, and with that <U+017F>welling made an end of
his <U+017F>tory.</p>
            <p>But by this time they had gotten to <hi>Battu<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> hou<U+017F>e,
where (as their fellows had told them) they found him

them<U+017F>elves to <hi>Battus,</hi> and reque<U+017F>ted him to conduct

and was de<U+017F>cending to take his re<U+017F>t on <hi>Theti<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi>

the two friends <hi>Danpion</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> (now no more
<hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>The<U+017F>tylus)</hi> agreed upon time and place,
where again they might have recour<U+017F>e to inform each

in both parties; and <U+017F>o they parted, <hi>Periander</hi> betaking
him<U+017F>elf to <hi>Pandions</hi> Ca<U+017F>tle, and <hi>Danpion</hi> to the Kings
Court, whither by that time the torches of the night
were enkindled in the heavens, he arrived. But <U+017F>carce
had he alighted off his hor<U+017F>e, ere winged Fame had
carried tidings of it to the ears of mo<U+017F>t, and by rea<U+017F>on
of his eminency it was not long, before it was known
to all, <U+017F>o that the King having notice of it, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<U+017F>ends for him to come to his pre<U+017F>ence, to give
an account of his ab<U+017F>ence, for there wanted not in the
Court, tho<U+017F>e malitious and yet ambitious <U+017F>pirits, that
repining at <hi>Danpions</hi> <U+017F>upereminent glories, took all
advantages again<U+017F>t him, and in particular this of his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52129:106"/>
withdrawing from the Court to beget <U+017F>u<U+017F>pitious
thoughts of him in the King, that <U+017F>o by degrees they
might bring him to his Occident, who<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ence thus
in the Meridian favour, totally ob<U+017F>cured their lu<U+017F>tre,
and in who<U+017F>e ab<U+017F>ence only their dim Star-light could
appear. And knowing him to be too potent with the
King, and too <U+017F>trongly fixed in his bo<U+017F>om, to remove
by apparent violence, and impetuo<U+017F>ity, they therefore
imitating tho<U+017F>e that when they cannot take a Fort by
<U+017F>torm, <U+017F>eek to undermine it, <U+017F>ought privately to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate
and reproach him with treachery an infidelity,
to which this pre<U+017F>ent ab<U+017F>ence of his <U+017F>eemed to add no
<U+017F>mall confirmation.</p>
            <p>But all the<U+017F>e obtrectations proved in the end but like
Dogs barkings at the Moon, who <U+017F>lackens her pace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the more, nor wraps her face in a Cloud never the
<U+017F>ooner, for all his Cholerick yelpings. So <hi>Danpion</hi>
<U+017F>oon obtained his former favour, when he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the King, that the occa<U+017F>ion of his ab<U+017F>ence was
only an accidental lo<U+017F>s of his way, as he rode out on an

            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> having continued <U+017F>ome time in the Court,

retyredne<U+017F>s, and what not? is it not <hi>Amphigenia?
Amphigenia,</hi> the model of heaven, the Paragon of
Beauty, the glory of Nature, the worlds ornament,
the pride of <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>alia,</hi> and the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of my heart?

Can my dim-<U+017F>ighted <U+017F>oul then think to

with Angelical Beauty, and that thought <U+017F>ubverts all
hopes of fruition. Her body though framed by Nature,

of a marvellous Architecture, yet is but a temporary
Cell, where her immaculate Soul, for the freer and

divine enthu<U+017F>ia<U+017F>ms and in<U+017F>pirations. Shall I then to

re<U+017F>t, my heart and all? no my immaterial Soul will not
admit of commixture with the mo<U+017F>t refined earth,
and therefore it is not her corporal part alone, though
moulded into an Angelical form, that doth rapt my
heart with a tran<U+017F>porting affection; but her Soul, her
vertuous Soul, who<U+017F>e beams <U+017F>hining through her eyes,
as through a Cry<U+017F>tal medium, reflect round her face,
and exhale my affections; but alas! that's too much
wedded to Virginity, and taken up with the ravi<U+017F>hing

the governance and direction of my intellectuals. And
if my di<U+017F>courteous Stars have not de<U+017F>tined me to that
happine<U+017F>s, to be linked in matrimonial union, with
<U+017F>uch a <U+017F>uperexcellent Beauty, and to have our hearts
di<U+017F><U+017F>olved into one, with the ardent flames of pure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
I mu<U+017F>t frame a content, and make my Soul

The<U+017F>e doleful expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>o dolefully by a
Lady beleagured with extremity of mi<U+017F>ery, would have
<U+017F>crued tears from a Rock, and made an Adamant turn
<hi>Niobe,</hi> but yet took no impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion upon the Ma<U+017F>ter, but

But no <U+017F>ooner had he tacked about to be gone,

relation of this <U+017F>ad Ladies misfortune; but truly, when
I heard the <U+017F>tory fir<U+017F>t related by the Knight (that (as I
told you) lately came from <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and heard her <U+017F>elf

<U+017F>pent this lamentable night, in Weeping, Sighing, Sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
Groaning, Praying, till the bright morning had

wrapping up her face in a Vermilion-mantle, <U+017F>ilently

            <p>When <hi>Lacon</hi> (for <U+017F>o was the Ru<U+017F>tick named) awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by his own loud <U+017F>noring, called to mind his new

<U+017F>weetly apparelled her Face, in a Vermilion ve<U+017F>ture, as

            <p>No <U+017F>ooner did <hi>Lacon</hi> behold his new Sweet-hearts
<U+017F>weet-heart-attracting feature, but her Eyes, that

her, as if he was <U+017F>ucking the <U+017F>weet contained in tho<U+017F>e
Vermilion Hives of Beauty.</p>
            <p>Much of the day being <U+017F>pent in this manner, <hi>Lacon</hi>
Wooing, and <hi>Glycera</hi> Weeping, he <U+017F>labbering her
Cheeks with his frothy Lips, and <U+017F>he bedewing his with
her Pearly Tears, at length he re<U+017F>olved to con<U+017F>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
his joyes with Marriage, and compels her to go
with him to <hi>Venus</hi>-Temple, to <U+017F>acrifize a pair of Turtle-Doves,
thereby to procure the Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es Benediction.
But all the way as <U+017F>he went, <U+017F>uch a Mart of Beauties
met in her <U+017F>weet Countenance, as purcha<U+017F>ed her as

her Eyes inviting all eyes to behold, and her

adore her; <U+017F>o that few there were, who<U+017F>e Sex rendred

            <p>Her beautious Face, wherein <U+017F>hined the Perfection

of his Oppo<U+017F>ers fall, and do homage to his rage,
and their <U+017F>ouls, which, to what their bodies had done,
would not con<U+017F>ent, he <U+017F>ent to <hi>Tartarus,</hi> there to endure
an eternal Va<U+017F><U+017F>alage under <hi>Pluto:</hi> But yet having no
other Bulwark than his Buckler, to fortifie him<U+017F>elf
again<U+017F>t the incur<U+017F>ions of his Enemies, he at la<U+017F>t received
a Wound, out of which <U+017F>uch plenty of Blood effu<U+017F>ed,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52129:126"/>
that he was forced to <U+017F>urrender up him<U+017F>elf, and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to the mercy of his Opponents, and by that means,
he e<U+017F>caped from among<U+017F>t them.</p>
            <p>But now the quarrel grew as hot among<U+017F>t them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
which <U+017F>hould bear away the Prize; every man
accounting the lo<U+017F>s of his blood a cheap price, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<U+017F>e
<U+017F>o rich a Trea<U+017F>ure; thus there grew no end of
their di<U+017F>orders, till at length <U+017F>ome Officers from the
King came, and with the Point of the Sword of Ju<U+017F>tice,
put a full point and Period to the rude <U+017F>cufflings of this
Rabble.</p>
            <p>But when enquiry was made after <hi>Glycera,</hi> no newes
could be heard of her; for taking her opportunity, when
her bloody Suters were all pleading their Intere<U+017F>ts,
with the Swords <U+017F>harp-peircing Rhetorick, <U+017F>he e<U+017F>caped
away in the Crowd, and fled to a Wood not farr di<U+017F>tant,
where <U+017F>he <U+017F>pent all that night in bewailing her <U+017F>orrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
e<U+017F>tate; where her Soul would quaff in huge draughts
of woe, which, as not able to concoct, <U+017F>he would pour
out again in Tears; Tears, that fell like melted Stars
from the Heaven of her Beauty.</p>
            <p>Thus did <U+017F>he give up her <U+017F>elf to the dominion of an
unrea<U+017F>onable Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which yet her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion per<U+017F>waded
her was rea<U+017F>onable. Sometimes grief would permit
her thus to lament her Woes: Oh Me! of all women
di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>t! Mu<U+017F>t I be <U+017F>he in whom mi<U+017F>eries combine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

but Ah! No <U+017F>hore, no limits, no centre,
no circumference to my <U+017F>orrows: No <U+017F>hore to the Seas
of my Tears, no limits to the Wind of my <U+017F>ighs, no
centre to my deep-rooted griefs, nor no circumference
to the infinity of my mi<U+017F>eries: But I am become For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes

<U+017F>orrowes; Hells Butt, where my Innocency is the
White, at which they <U+017F>hoot their invenomed Arrowes,
Winged with Malice, and Piled with De<U+017F>truction; and
Heavens Tennis ball, when if with the vehemency of
the blow, my Soul chance to bound upwards towards
a Heaven of hope (for grief is ever at the lowe<U+017F>t, when
it is at the highe<U+017F>t; and extremity of mi<U+017F>ery, is ever
the dawning of mercy;) I <U+017F>ay, if it chance to bound,
<U+017F>ome di<U+017F>mal Accident takes me at the re-bound, and
to<U+017F><U+017F>es me into a Hell of calamities: Come then Death,
come quickly, bend thy Bow, and <U+017F>end thy <U+017F>harp-piled
Arrowes into this Pile of Du<U+017F>t, that entombs my Soul.
But then her Brea<U+017F>ts would be brim-full with a raging
pang, which would <U+017F>truggle for birth; but in <U+017F>triving to
vent all, it could vent nothing, but only <U+017F>top the pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>age
of her <U+017F>peech; till at length her breath would be
delivered of a Groan, which capring thorow the Bowes
and Leaves, would be re-bounded to her Ears by Eccho;
which <hi>Glycera</hi> hearing, the better to pa<U+017F>s away the
mournful hours of the night, began thus to entertain
a Dialogue with her; which becau<U+017F>e the Knight thought

O that Heaven would relea<U+017F>e me of my Bargain. Bare

I <U+017F>hould Ply it <U+017F>till, what Medicine will Heaven apply

Why is it that <U+017F>uch a redolent Balm as Innocencye,
which a<U+017F>cends to Heaven, as a perpetual Sacrifice,

Heaven make to his de<U+017F>ire? Ire. What An<U+017F>wer will
Heaven return, if the Innocent pray? Ray. A Ray
of Love, or Light, or both? Both. Which of the
Powers <U+017F>ublime can affect a Mortal? All. When
a beam of Love <U+017F>hines from Heaven into a Mortal, what
part doth it comfort? Fort. The Fort or Life, where

How long will <U+017F>uch Divine con<U+017F>olations <U+017F>tay? Ay.

if he permitted that to the unrevenged; and with
that <hi>Glycera</hi> having given him a Character of him, as

Steed, and <U+017F>o rides out into the Fore<U+017F>t in pur<U+017F>ute of
this wretch, but ere he had gone a quarter of a mile, he
found him dead upon the ground, having broke his
neck with the fall from the Rock. When <hi>Polienus</hi> <U+017F>aw
this, he was glad that heavens vengeance had found him
out, but <U+017F>orry that any one had been the executioner
be<U+017F>ides him<U+017F>elf, but however he goes home to his

<U+017F>o that <hi>Polienus</hi> who before beheld her only with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion,

the object of his thoughts, the <U+017F>ubject of his di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e,

cover his affection with the veil of <U+017F>ilence, but love,
though its chiefe<U+017F>t re<U+017F>idence is in the heart, yet it will
oft peep forth at the Ca<U+017F>ements of the eyes, and like
the Bee, though its dwelling is in the Hive of the heart,
yet it mu<U+017F>t come forth to feed it <U+017F>elf with the heavenly

Garden of Beauty; <U+017F>o <hi>Polienus</hi> though he endeavoured
to conceal his griefs, yet his eyes would di<U+017F>clo<U+017F>e what
his heart inclo<U+017F>ed, for if ever he was in her pre<U+017F>ence,
her beauties attracted both his eyes and heart, and the
radiant beams that glanc'd from hers would <U+017F>eem to

            <p>
               <hi>Polienus</hi> thus ob<U+017F>erving daily how love did degree it
<U+017F>elf into his heart, and a crowd of inevitable inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences

make his Rea<U+017F>on do homage to it what he could. For
you mu<U+017F>t know, this <hi>Polienus</hi> was one of prime quality,
having both a great wit, and a greater fortune, <U+017F>o that

he was never a hater, <U+017F>o neither ever any great admirer
of the female <U+017F>ex, but looked on them as piles of well
complexioned du<U+017F>t, that like <hi>Sodoms</hi> Apples with the
lea<U+017F>t touch of Times finger would moulder to nothing,
or as Natures painted Gallipots, where you may meet

thus incapacitate him to <U+017F>atisfie <U+017F>o great a debt as the

Thus long did heaven give intermi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to <hi>Glycera</hi>'s

have routed the main Battel, and begin to erect Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of joyes, and to lead Captive all our former <U+017F>ad
Accidents, at the Chariot of our triumphing fortune;
<U+017F>o it was with <hi>Glycera,</hi> joy began to triumph in her
Eyes, and her heart bid Adieu to all di<U+017F>content, and
the <U+017F>udden delight <U+017F>he took in tho<U+017F>e rich Excellencies,
wherewith Nature had endued <hi>Polienus,</hi> elevated her
mind to <U+017F>o high a pitch of contentment, that <U+017F>he almo<U+017F>t
thought <U+017F>ome heavenly Apparition had imparadized her
thoughts in a golden repre<U+017F>entation of <hi>Elizium:</hi> but
the<U+017F>e towring joyes did but lead her to a precipice of
mi<U+017F>ery, that <U+017F>o her fall might be the greater; for before
the marriage-day, the King had intelligence of it.</p>
            <p>The multitude may be well compared to a Fore<U+017F>t,
that Ecchoes all things <U+017F>poke or done, to their Kings
ears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loritus</hi> hearing this, re<U+017F>olved that his revenge <U+017F>hould
be of an equal Latitude with his threatning, and though
<hi>Amoro<U+017F>ia</hi> upon her knees entreated for his Pardon, yet
he <U+017F>hook her off, and told her, That the heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves,
though more powerful, yet are not more ju<U+017F>t
and re<U+017F>olute to execute their Decrees, than he was.
And accordingly, he <U+017F>ends a Party of Hor<U+017F>e in the
night, who being let into the Ca<U+017F>tle by <U+017F>ome Loyal
Per<U+017F>ons, but treacherous <U+017F>ervants to <hi>Polienus,</hi> they <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
both him and <hi>Glycera</hi> in theis beds, who little
dreamt of <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ad interception of their happine<U+017F>s, or
that their new-coyn'd joyes <U+017F>hould thus prove Dro<U+017F>s,
and not pa<U+017F>s current.</p>
            <p>Thus doth a black <U+017F>hadow of mi<U+017F>ery attend a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hine

Cloud, or a Rock to <U+017F>hip-wrack our hopes and
contents upon.</p>
            <p>Thus many times when we think to be conducted by
the glimmering glories of this World, through a night
of <U+017F>orrows, to <U+017F>ome Haven, where our deluded thoughts
per<U+017F>wade us Bli<U+017F>s re<U+017F>ides, they indeed prove but an
<hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> that lights us through the invious Paths,
and Mi<U+017F>ts of airy delu<U+017F>ions, to a precipice of mi<U+017F>ery,
where they leave us.</p>
            <p>So it was with <hi>Polienus</hi> and <hi>Glycera,</hi> Hope, the bright
Harbinger of the dawning day of Comfort, had ri<U+017F>en

frozen, by the cold bla<U+017F>ts of De<U+017F>pair, that nipt their
<U+017F>pringing happine<U+017F>s in the Bud: for that night they
were conveyed to <hi>Gortyna,</hi> a Town of great re<U+017F>ort in
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> being the Centre of it, and <U+017F>tands near the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Lethaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning, <hi>Polienus</hi> was adjudged to be
thrown off a high Rock, but whether or no executed,
the Knight could not re<U+017F>olve; but <hi>Glycera</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to <hi>Kolax</hi> his hou<U+017F>e, one who was much favoured
of the King, not for his merit, but for his flattery, being
a man of a <U+017F>ervile leaden <U+017F>pirit, and one that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
bow, and comply with the Kings humour, and
receive any Form, or Impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion he would <U+017F>tamp upon
him; and thus by this counterfeit Coyn, gilded over
with fair pretences, did he purcha<U+017F>e his Kings favour,
and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s his ea<U+017F>ie nature; <U+017F>o that if any thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

the Per<U+017F>on Elected, and for that rea<U+017F>on, <hi>Glycera</hi> became
his Pri<U+017F>oner.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Glycera,</hi> under all the<U+017F>e inquietudes, behaved her
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52129:136"/>

her <U+017F>oul had more Antidote in it, than misfortune had
Poy<U+017F>on; as if her con<U+017F>tant <U+017F>uffering Fortunes incon<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

               <hi>Glycera</hi> perceiving both vi<U+017F>ible and audible effects of

when <U+017F>he perceived her <U+017F>elf re<U+017F>tored to her <U+017F>elf, <U+017F>he

find in his heart to leave me? I can and will
leave thee with all my heart (<U+017F>aid <hi>Periander)</hi> I mean, all

thee, I cannot, <U+017F>ince I can find nothing there but thee.
Oh but <hi>Periander</hi> <U+017F>hall not go (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) <hi>Periander</hi> will

            <p>And will you then be gone (<U+017F>aid <hi>Florinda</hi> weeping)
what <U+017F>hall become of me the while, think you? Live in

as interrupted her <U+017F>peech, yet fain <U+017F>he would

the more difficult, <U+017F>o that grief made <U+017F>o large a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<U+017F>is,
as if it would have put a period to her life, in the

(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) <hi>Periander</hi> had thought I had loved him too
dearly, ever to take any repo<U+017F>e in his ab<U+017F>ence. But
though he can part from me, and exchange a <U+017F>potle<U+017F>s
affection, for a little blood-<U+017F>tained honor, though he
can in<U+017F>atiably carow<U+017F>e my tears, yet I could not <U+017F>ee a tear
drop from his eyes, but 'twould corrode my <U+017F>oul, nor
can I part from him, and retain my <U+017F>elf, for affection
hath <U+017F>o glewed him to my heart, as the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>eparation
would rend it in pieces.</p>
            <p>But he di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ing to her, how much it did import
his honor, and of what evil con<U+017F>equence to <hi>Danpions</hi>
affairs his negligence in that re<U+017F>pect would be, <U+017F>he
hung on his neck, and ki<U+017F><U+017F>ed his cheeks, and all the
while bathed her ki<U+017F><U+017F>es and his cheeks in tears. Oh
(<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) do not, do not go, if we mu<U+017F>t part now, we
mu<U+017F>t part for ever. But with that, as if every letter in
the word, <hi>Ever,</hi> had been a thunderbolt <U+017F>hot from the
<U+017F>ulphurous clouds of love mixt with <U+017F>orrow in her heart,
her <U+017F>en<U+017F>es were on a <U+017F>udden overwhelmed with extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and <U+017F>he falls down into a <U+017F>woun. <hi>Periander</hi> <U+017F>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, was forc't to take an abrupt leave of <hi>Danpion,</hi>
who<U+017F>e dear affection each to other would el<U+017F>e have
compelled them to be more copious in their parting
ceremonies, and takes <hi>Florinda</hi> in his arms, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
her to a hou<U+017F>e neer adjoyning, where we leave
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> being thus unhappily deprived of his friends,
and with them of his hopes of ever attaining either his
Love, or his Kingdom, began mo<U+017F>t pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his condition. For <hi>Periander</hi> that had <U+017F>o far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52129:139"/>
him on <hi>Pandions</hi> <U+017F>ide, and <hi>Florinda</hi> by who<U+017F>e
means he had accompli<U+017F>hed many projects in <hi>Hiarba</hi>'s
Court, and who had defended him <U+017F>o often from <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
and <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, were now both
gone, <U+017F>o that he <U+017F>eemed at once to have lo<U+017F>t both his
<U+017F>word and buckler, and left alone to manage his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igns,
and bear the brunt of all.</p>
            <p>In this condition he returned to his Chamber, and
there gave vent to his <U+017F>orrows, and in the mid<U+017F>t of all
his <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s, he <U+017F>ets down this re<U+017F>olution with him<U+017F>elf,
that <U+017F>ince all his hopes were fled with <hi>Periander</hi> and
<hi>Florinda,</hi> he would quench that Ve<U+017F>tal fire of cha<U+017F>t
love that flamed in his heart, which could only be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at the beams of <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s beauty, and with the
<U+017F>moke of that extingui<U+017F>hed flame, <U+017F>mother his grief,
and deface that image of <U+017F>orrow deciphered in his de-dejected
countenance, and <U+017F>treight apply him<U+017F>elf
to <hi>Hiarbas</hi> will, and comply with his humors, by that
means not onely to enter into, but to interr him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
alive during his dying life in his affection.</p>
            <p>But humane determinations are but as gli<U+017F>tering Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
where <U+017F>ome bright reflections may plea<U+017F>e the fancy
for a while, but <U+017F>oon vani<U+017F>h into Air with the lea<U+017F>t bla<U+017F>t
of a divine decree; every beam of a Planet comes laden
with transformations, which though it cannot have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
commerce with the immaterial <U+017F>oul, yet it will
bribe the Organs, and by that means unhinge the doors
of re<U+017F>olution that exclude incon<U+017F>tancy from the
mind.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Danpion,</hi> however for a time he flattered his <U+017F>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
with the thoughts of blotting out the Characters
of love with black oblivion, yet at length he found
love to be of <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>trange invincible unre<U+017F>i<U+017F>table force,
that the more he endeavoured to conquer its rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the more it rebelled and conquered his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52129:140"/>
<U+017F>o that in de<U+017F>pight of his rea<U+017F>on, he was led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
by his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Fla<U+017F>hes of beauty may dazle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
eyes, but where they light to purpo<U+017F>e, they
melt the <U+017F>teelie<U+017F>t hearts, and make them receive impre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions
of love, which cannot <U+017F>oon be obliterated: which
<hi>Danpions</hi> experience could confirm, for the more he
endeavoured to extingui<U+017F>h the flames of affection with
the cold bla<U+017F>ts of de<U+017F>pair, the more ardent they grew,
and the le<U+017F>s tolerable; <U+017F>o that at length with con<U+017F>tant
pining, not onely the colour, but the figure of his face
began to be altered; which many ob<U+017F>erved, as al<U+017F>o
how he affected <U+017F>olitarine<U+017F>s, to walk and talk alone,
<U+017F>ometimes breathing forth his complaints in the Groves
and Gardens, <U+017F>ometimes inwardly <U+017F>ighing, and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as if his heart held a dialogue with <U+017F>orrow. And
when he was in company, his thoughts ran <U+017F>o much of
<hi>Amphigenia,</hi> as all the jollity and recreation the
Court did abound in, <U+017F>eemed to him but unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
Parenthe<U+017F>es, and tedious digre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, to that <U+017F>weet
<U+017F>ubject that his <U+017F>oul <U+017F>ilently di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>ed of. And when
he was in <hi>Hiarbas</hi> pre<U+017F>ence, though his policy would
compell him to throw off tho<U+017F>e mourning weeds
wherein grief had attired his countenance, le<U+017F>t he
<U+017F>hould lay a foundation for <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion in <hi>Hiarbas</hi>
thoughts, yet the countenance holds <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ympathy
with the mind, that it is very difficult, <U+017F>o to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
a contrary affection, that a judicious eye in every
lineament of the face may not read the di<U+017F><U+017F>imulation;
<U+017F>o that <hi>Hiarbas</hi> could not but by every action di<U+017F>cern
the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, wherewith he was affected, his dull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
looks, his impertinent di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, his frequent
<U+017F>obbing, abrupt <U+017F>ighing, and the very tone of his

            <p>This <U+017F>uddain alteration in <hi>Danpions</hi> countenance

(which he conjectured could not be ordinary, <U+017F>ince
the effect was <U+017F>o <U+017F>uperlative and extraordinary) he on a

what the cau<U+017F>e was of his extremity of grief, whether

whether he had committed any traiterous fact, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
di<U+017F>covery, the latter of which he chiefly hoped

            <p>Now what inundation of mi<U+017F>ery could overwhelm

to bid defiance to the turbulent waves of Fortune?
That that did mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>trongly invade his brea<U+017F>t, was the
remembrance of the lo<U+017F>s of <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s favour; and
that indeed compelled him to let his <U+017F>orrow di<U+017F><U+017F>olve in
drops, and to indulge him<U+017F>elf to melting pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions.

Thus <U+017F>ubtilly did <U+017F>orrow in<U+017F>inuate it <U+017F>elf into his

then a deep fetcht <U+017F>igh would tell him roundly in his
ear, tho<U+017F>e plea<U+017F>ing dreams were but delu<U+017F>ions; then
grief would change the former <hi>Phrygian</hi> harmony, in

<U+017F>trains and doleful airs, where every note <U+017F>ounds
like a groan, and every quaver like the trembling <U+017F>igh
of one that weeps; And then a flowing Sea of <U+017F>orrow
would <U+017F>upply his eyes with tears, which <U+017F>oftly trickling

cur<U+017F>ing <hi>Ba<U+017F>canius</hi> and his Pages treachery, but then
<hi>Amphigenia</hi> would fill his thoughts, and make him
break off abruptly, as he broke out pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately. At
length e<U+017F>pying a Lute that hung behind the hangings in
a corner of the chamber, he took it down; and made it
di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e his griefs in <U+017F>uch melting accents, as every

<U+017F>ometimes it would <U+017F>eem even to <U+017F>teal his very

But he making no other commentary on it, than that

The Keeper perceiving a dim light in his Chamber,

            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> hearing this unexpected tidings, fixed his

and on the <U+017F>udden writhes the <U+017F>word out of his hand,
and redeems him<U+017F>elf, giving him blowes for his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>om.
Extremity is Vertues Opportunity, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> having relea<U+017F>ed him<U+017F>elf, runs to a near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
Wood, where he <U+017F>pends that night in <U+017F>ighing

lamenting <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s cruelty. His Mind float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a tempe<U+017F>tuous Sea of thoughts, would be wreck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<U+017F>omtimes upon Rocks of in<U+017F>uperable difficulties,
<U+017F>omtimes overwhelmed in a Gulf of de<U+017F>pair: Then his
Tongue, the <U+017F>ervant of his Mind, to give <U+017F>ome little
ea<U+017F>e, would vent <U+017F>ome <U+017F>treams, out of the over-flowings
of his thoughts. Words are airy <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ors to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>tate
comforts: Flitting Shadows, and vani<U+017F>hing

give ea<U+017F>e, though they give no <U+017F>uccour.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Danpion,</hi> with the wind of his words, would a
little di<U+017F>per<U+017F>e the Clouds of grief in his mind. Somtimes
he would inveigh again<U+017F>t Envy, calling it the putrid
Blain of a corrupt mind, or the very Impo<U+017F>thume of all
vitious humours; which bur<U+017F>ting with its own venom,
<U+017F>ends forth an infectious gore, called Slaunder: Slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that ba<U+017F>e canker of Renown, filthy vapour of an
ulcerous mind, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>team ob<U+017F>cures Vertues bright

the accur<U+017F>ed <U+017F>pawn of a helli<U+017F>h mind.</p>
            <p>But then his Hate to Envy, would bring to his mind
the contrary oppo<U+017F>ite, a Love to Vertue; and both the<U+017F>e
would be as alarms, to awaken the thoughts of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia,</hi>
the Object of the fir<U+017F>t, and the Subject of the
latter; And then he would condemn his too too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous
eyes, for their pre<U+017F>umptuous beholding of
that miracle of beauty; but more his remembrance, for
retaining that Soul-captivating Species, her Idea; but
mo<U+017F>t of all, his Heart, for <U+017F>urrendring up its Cittadel to
the tyranny of love.</p>
            <p>And then he would call out, Ah! Why did I love?
Alas! alas! Why did I love? Thus to be made a
<U+017F>lave to Beauty; but how could I chu<U+017F>e but love? love?
nay adore <U+017F>o Divine a Form? Rather why do I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?
<U+017F>ince it is remembrance that is the life of my
grief, and that that renews my woes; but how can I
chu<U+017F>e but remember <U+017F>uch a heavenly <U+017F>hape, in whom
all unparalleld Excellencies meet like parallels in their
proper Centre; who<U+017F>e every beam glanced from her
eyes, writ a compleat <U+017F>tory in my mind, of Beauties
Perfection, and Loves Prerogative? But ah! Why did
I then give liberty to my eyes to <U+017F>ee that model of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52129:147"/>
perfections? <U+017F>ince the eyes are the Cry<U+017F>tal doors
of the mind, at which all Objects enter that enthrall
the affections; but alas! who could but gaze, and gaze
him<U+017F>elf to admiration, and admire him<U+017F>elf into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<U+017F>ie,
to behold one, in who<U+017F>e Eye lay the diapazon of
beauties vi<U+017F>ible harmony, which with their motions,
like the Spheres, would <U+017F>trike Entrancing Raptures into
all cha<U+017F>t hearts; and where thou<U+017F>ands of Stars lay
couched under a <U+017F>able Veil, re<U+017F>embling nights Canopy,
who<U+017F>e rapting influence, would compel all eyes to <U+017F>ee,
all thoughts to remember, and all hearts to love and

            <p>Thus his thoughts flying from one oppo<U+017F>ite to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
would <U+017F>till centre on <hi>Amphigenia;</hi> like the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,

and thus he con<U+017F>umed the night, untill about the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

while<U+017F>t it <U+017F>eems to <U+017F>tand as a Neuter, between night

both; when remembring, that though his e<U+017F>cape had
freed him from pre<U+017F>ent mi<U+017F>ery, yet not from future ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
he therefore re<U+017F>olved to flee to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> after his

But then <hi>Danpion</hi> began to enquire of <hi>Athalus,</hi> about
the event of his love to <hi>Matilda</hi> (for <hi>Periander,</hi> as they

came along from the Hermitage, had told him the
whole <U+017F>tory) and whether that excellent Lady, that
beautified the Coach with her Beauty, were not <U+017F>he:
To whom <hi>Athalus</hi> replyed, that that indeed was the
Lady, that was the Pole-<U+017F>tar of all his endeavours,
through who<U+017F>e favour he breathed, through who<U+017F>e

            <p>
               <hi>Danpion</hi> having performed his <U+017F>alutations to her, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalus</hi>

that both of us, but e<U+017F>pecially my <U+017F>elf, had ta<U+017F>ted the

who being men not only of murderous, but mercenary
<U+017F>pirits, and never would refu<U+017F>e to dive into a Sea of
wickedne<U+017F>s, to find that Pearl called Gain, and ever
thought it the greate<U+017F>t piece of folly in the world, for
men to recede from their own Intere<U+017F>t, through a
childi<U+017F>h dread of impiety, and to be affrighted from
the beaten rode of Vice, if it leads to a Mine of wealth,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52129:149"/>
with the fooli<U+017F>h Bug-bear terrors that haunt that path;
and therefore they'd no le<U+017F>s deride at tho<U+017F>e, that not

<U+017F>ail where ever tho<U+017F>e gu<U+017F>ts of popular breath entituled

The<U+017F>e men being thus a fit matter for him to <U+017F>uperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any form upon, he transforms their former <U+017F>hapes,
and makes them become of lovers to Vice, pretended
lovers of Vertue; and therefore de<U+017F>irous of ju<U+017F>tice, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not only becau<U+017F>e it was ju<U+017F>tly ranked in the catalogue of
Vertues, but becau<U+017F>e it was the de<U+017F>troyer of Vice, and
the cheri<U+017F>her and protector of Vertue</p>
            <p>And this he did to ob<U+017F>cure his own malice, and their
revenge, from the popular view; that <U+017F>o his actions ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

            <p>Having thus by policy and <U+017F>ubtilty, plundered me
of my e<U+017F>tate, the next thing he had to do was to po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>e<U+017F>s
him<U+017F>elf of <hi>Arrite<U+017F>ia,</hi> without whom all the other
i<U+017F><U+017F>ues of his brain would prove abortive; and to that
end he invites both the <U+017F>i<U+017F>ters <hi>Arrite<U+017F>ia</hi> and <hi>Matilda,</hi>
(to intercept all jealou<U+017F>ies in them or their Father, that
might intercept his plot) to a mo<U+017F>t magnificent fea<U+017F>t,
where (as was reported) luxury and exce<U+017F>s <U+017F>eemed to
ride in triumph in every di<U+017F>h, as though the <U+017F>torehou<U+017F>es
of the elements had been ran<U+017F>acked to furni<U+017F>h his
Table; as if he had been rather to have courted his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tri<U+017F><U+017F>es
appetite, than her affection; <U+017F>o that his Table
<U+017F>eemed the Scene of Prodigality, whereon was acted
the Tragedy of Temperance and true Liberalty; the

            <p>But the Fea<U+017F>t being concluded, <hi>Plivio</hi> had another
play to act, to which this <U+017F>erved but for a Prologue;
and that was to <U+017F>eize upon <hi>Arrite<U+017F>ia;</hi> that <U+017F>ince (as the
Philo<U+017F>opher <U+017F>aith) every one is the framer of his own
fate, he re<U+017F>olved that none <U+017F>hould accu<U+017F>e his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
for his infelicity, but he would purcha<U+017F>e that by
compul<U+017F>ion, to which milder means he <U+017F>aw would
prove ineffectual. For (my Lord) you mu<U+017F>t know <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite<U+017F>ia</hi>
was a Lady in whom appeared all the delicate
attractives of beauty, and external demon<U+017F>trations of
internal Vertue; <U+017F>o that as the former would <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
excu<U+017F>e a Stoick <U+017F>hould he become an amori<U+017F>t:
excu<U+017F>e? nay accu<U+017F>e him of a ba<U+017F>e ignorance of worth,
<U+017F>hould he not admire her perfections; <U+017F>o the influence
of the latter, might have created goodne<U+017F>s in the wor<U+017F>t
of men, and rendered him inexcu<U+017F>able in who<U+017F>e brea<U+017F>t
was the lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>park of an impure fire. Now no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if a vertuous <U+017F>oul en<U+017F>hrined in <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet a body, by
a reflex act viewing its own internal beauty, be like
<hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us</hi> gazing on his picture limned by the Sun-beams
in a Fountain, enamoured with its own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies;
and <U+017F>o was <hi>Arrite<U+017F>ia,</hi> yet not <U+017F>o as to ob<U+017F>cure
her worth, with being void of humility, but rather
made Humility a means to di<U+017F>cover the worthine<U+017F>s of
her worth, and <U+017F>o her Vertues as they became more
per<U+017F>picuous, <U+017F>o more delectable; <U+017F>o that if her humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was apt to entice hope, her dazling worth would
again <U+017F>tupi<U+017F>ie and confound it. But as none can ca<U+017F>t
up their eyes at the Sun, with more confidence, and le<U+017F>s
dazling, than the blind; <U+017F>o none are le<U+017F>s ravi<U+017F>hed with
true worth, than tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e ignorance of it, makes
them lea<U+017F>t admire it.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Plivio,</hi> though none had le<U+017F>s grounds for hope,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52129:150"/>
yet none had greater confidence than he; not becau<U+017F>e
he <U+017F>o far excelled others, as that his tran<U+017F>cending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erts
<U+017F>hould excite her to pitch upon him, but becau<U+017F>e
his worth being <U+017F>hort of many, made him le<U+017F>s able to
di<U+017F>cern of anothers, and begat conceits of him<U+017F>elf
above what his de<U+017F>erts could challenge, and <U+017F>uch
thoughts in any will <U+017F>oon augment hope to a pre<U+017F>ump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but this did but create the more di<U+017F>e<U+017F>teemes of
him in <hi>Arrite<U+017F>ia</hi>'s thoughts, who by the light of her
own worth was able to <U+017F>ee his worthle<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, and where
di<U+017F>e<U+017F>teem once gets entrance, its hard to crowd out
di<U+017F>affection, they being in<U+017F>eparably linked together, as
love and contempt are irreconcileably <U+017F>eparated; <U+017F>o
that <hi>Arrite<U+017F>ia</hi> thus <U+017F>lighting his per<U+017F>on would much
more contemn his importunings, that <U+017F>he let all his
words dye in their own <U+017F>ounds, his mo<U+017F>t pathetick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F><U+017F>ions
taking no more impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion on her, than puffs
of Air upon an Adamant.</p>
            <p>Her mind was a Paradi<U+017F>e, where <U+017F>warmed Angels of
high thoughts, <U+017F>uch thoughts as each de<U+017F>erved a

            <p>And <U+017F>o it was with <hi>Plivio,</hi> he was reaping the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>t

how, or when, or which way, or whither they e<U+017F>caped,

fre<U+017F>h remembrance of his death was a little withered
(as nothing ever continues verdant, though farr be it

beauteous image of her <U+017F>elf there inclo<U+017F>ed; and how
pure a flame was <U+017F>hot from her eyes into my heart, and
in a broken manner (for <U+017F>uch is the language of Lovers,
the commotions of their hearts di<U+017F>turbing their <U+017F>peech)
I <U+017F>ay brokenly I begged of her to love me, if not for

            <p>In fine, I left nothing un<U+017F>aid that Love could dictate
(and Love did dictate as much as can be within the

I battered down all tho<U+017F>e rea<U+017F>ons that fortified her
heart again<U+017F>t me; and forced her to blu<U+017F>h forth a dumb
con<U+017F>ent, when methoughts I <U+017F>aw her former thoughts

<U+017F>o that I became o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And before <U+017F>he would <U+017F>urrender up her heart to my
po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>he compelled me by many Vows to <U+017F>wear,
not to deface her <U+017F>potle<U+017F>s Vertue, but that cha<U+017F>tity

tho<U+017F>e that are founded on Valour and Deeds of Arms,
therefore <U+017F>he engaged me to travel with her thorough
<hi>Greece</hi> to hunt for fame with heroick exploits. And
remembring that there was no better way to eternize

require as well <hi>Argus</hi>'s eyes as
<hi>Briarcus</hi> hands. And therefore as a Prince would
proclame him<U+017F>elf guilty of no great prudence, who<U+017F>e
confidence on anothers judgement <U+017F>hould create in
him a diffidence of his own, and by that means make

For by that means, viewing his rea<U+017F>ons thorough

But to digre<U+017F>s from this digre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. <hi>Pandion</hi> and
<hi>Athalus</hi> (as I <U+017F>aid) fell into con<U+017F>ultation about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging
this cau<U+017F>e in which they were embarqued, and
how to <U+017F>teer it <U+017F>afely to the Port of Soveraignty. Now
in all determinable ca<U+017F>es, controverted by a Councel,
the<U+017F>e three points are chiefly to be in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted on.</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, The Ju<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s of the cau<U+017F>e: for who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to return crowned with a Lawrel, that at once
fightt again<U+017F>t the powers of heaven and earth?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The facility of accompli<U+017F>hing; and
therein is to be con<U+017F>idered the in<U+017F>trumental cau<U+017F>es: for
never was any <U+017F>o in league with Heaven, as to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
<U+017F>upernatural a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. None could free him
from the imputation of madne<U+017F>s, that would endeavor
to effect an enterprize without endeavors; that were
to create not to get victories.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The honor and profit: <U+017F>ince man acting as a
rational creature by voluntary election, not by in<U+017F>tinct
of Nature, or compul<U+017F>ive impul<U+017F>e of Sen<U+017F>e, always
propounds <U+017F>ome thing to him<U+017F>elf, which appearing
under the notion of good, is called the final cau<U+017F>e,
which though la<U+017F>t in execution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is fir<U+017F>t in intention;
therefore much more in the management of the highe<U+017F>t
affairs, man is entru<U+017F>ted with on earth, they ought to
u<U+017F>e the greate<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>on; and Rea<U+017F>on never excites the
will to proceed to election of any thing for its object,
that contains not real worth to render it eligible, or is
at lea<U+017F>t gilded over with an amability.</p>
            <p>Now the<U+017F>e three things were chiefly con<U+017F>idered in
their deliberation.</p>
            <p>And as to the fir<U+017F>t, namely, The ju<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s of the
Cau<U+017F>e; that was affirmed to be as apparent as the Sun<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
by whom all things are apparent; it being the pro<U+017F>ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a per<U+017F>ecuted right, and <U+017F>uch a right, that had
been founded upon an indubitate <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ion for many
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52129:155"/>
generations, proclamed by the voyce of heaven the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and confirmed by the Law of Nature and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And to that Objection that <hi>Hiarbas</hi> his right, both by
Conque<U+017F>t, and by <hi>Agis</hi> his re<U+017F>ignation, had <U+017F>wallowed
up <hi>Danpion</hi>'s, Reply was made: To the fir<U+017F>t Part of
the Objection, That Nature was an impartial Legi<U+017F>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and Univer<U+017F>als were equally <U+017F>hared among Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
and Individuals: Now if it was an Univer<U+017F>al Rule,
That Might could purcha<U+017F>e Right, then it was as ju<U+017F>t
for <hi>Danpion</hi> to regain the Kingdom by force, as <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
by force to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s it. If the longe<U+017F>t <U+017F>word is a fit
tool to carve Crowns for one, it is for another. If the
Trophies of Conque<U+017F>t can afford materials for a
Throne for one, they can for another. But the Sword
u<U+017F>ing no other Arguments, than tho<U+017F>e of Victory and
Succe<U+017F>s, cannot be a fit way to con<U+017F>titute, nor a fit Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to determine Right: And though it may plead
Cu<U+017F>tom and Example, yet <U+017F>uch Pleas are only valid
with tho<U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e ignorance of the Original and true

anothers, unle<U+017F>s he <U+017F>quares his by the rules of ju<U+017F>tice:
And though (it is true) in the <U+017F>tate of War, that all
men are in, before the in<U+017F>titution of Common-wealths,
(every man by nature being as a little World, <U+017F>o a little
Republick) a Right procured by the Sword is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<U+017F>t,
becau<U+017F>e unju<U+017F>tice is the wrongful detaining of
anothers Propriety; now one man having as much
right to all things as another, there can be no Propriety,
until a coercive Power is e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed, that mu<U+017F>t divide
this va<U+017F>t Common into Inclo<U+017F>ures; yet after Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52129:155"/>
are in<U+017F>tituted, to invade anothers right, is not
to procure a Propriety, but a Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion; for Propriety is
a Right to enjoy and improve any thing transferred by
mutual voluntary compact, under a coercive Power,
that can render the Contract valid, by compelling the
mutual performance: Now a Covenant being an act
of the Will, and the Will having only <U+017F>ome good for
its Object, and no greater evil, than to abandon means
of <U+017F>elf-pre<U+017F>ervation (which is the end and u<U+017F>e of all
things we <U+017F>eek to enjoy) therefore none can be <U+017F>uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
voluntarily to renounce his right of enjoyment of
that, the lo<U+017F>s whereof tends to his de<U+017F>truction; becau<U+017F>e
he therein cannot be thought to aim at any good to
him<U+017F>elf.</p>
            <p>Again, a Covenant being a voluntary act, mu<U+017F>t be
free from all coercion: For though the Elicit actions
of the Will are not <U+017F>ubject to compul<U+017F>ion, yet the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
actions are <U+017F>omtimes forced to rebel again<U+017F>t its
commands and dictates: Now a Covenant being a
voluntary transferring of Right, that is, not a conferring
a Right upon another that he had not before, becau<U+017F>e
Nature equally <U+017F>hares all things, among all per<U+017F>ons,
but a deve<U+017F>ting ones <U+017F>elf of a liberty of interrupting
anothers Original Right, in the thing alienated, or a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<U+017F>tanding out of the way, that another may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
his Original Right derived to him by Nature: As
<hi>Alexander,</hi> when he eclip<U+017F>ed the Sun, by his interpo<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between it and <hi>Diogines</hi>'s little Hermitage, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his <U+017F>tation at the <hi>Cynicks</hi> reque<U+017F>t: But an enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
purcha<U+017F>ed by force, doth not by a reciprical tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of <U+017F>ome good, move the Will of any one by
compact, voluntarily to renounce his Right, or liberty
of impeding anothers u<U+017F>e of his own Right Original,
and to remove him<U+017F>elf away the main ob<U+017F>tacle, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thru<U+017F>ts <U+017F>uch a one away by force; as if <hi>Diogines</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:52129:156"/>
<U+017F>hould have crowded <hi>Alexander</hi> from between him
and the Suns Rayes.</p>
            <p>And therefore a Right <U+017F>o procured, is only a pre<U+017F>ent
fruition, that is Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion, until a <U+017F>tronger <U+017F>natches the
Prey. Hence, no one can inve<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf with a right
of Soveraignety only by force, a power of governing
<U+017F>o procured, being not a Soveraignty, but a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
For all Soveraigntie, or Power of governing
others, is Originally derived from a certain number of
Per<U+017F>ons, covenanting one with another, to <U+017F>urrender
up their natural right of Self-gubernation, to one or
more Per<U+017F>ons, who repre<U+017F>enting the whole, <U+017F>o united
by mutual compact, may u<U+017F>e the power and <U+017F>trength
of them all for the <U+017F>afety, and benefit, and weal of the
Publick.</p>
            <p>Therefore a Power attained by violence, is not a
Power to rule, but tyrannize; the multitude having
never <U+017F>o much as implicitly transferred over their right,
and con<U+017F>equently not obliged to obedience, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than as their Non-obedience may turn to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truction:
And in that re<U+017F>pect, the right of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being equally <U+017F>hared among all Per<U+017F>ons, by nature,
the di<U+017F>proportion only remains in this, Thar <U+017F>uch a
one hath the longe<U+017F>t Sword.</p>
            <p>But concerning the <U+017F>econd part of the Objection,
<hi>viz:</hi> That <hi>Agis</hi> had transferred over his right to <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
by Re<U+017F>ignation, this was the <U+017F>olution:</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t, though it is true, Covenants entred into by
force are Obligatory, from the Law of Nature that
commands Self-pre<U+017F>ervation, and con<U+017F>equently an
Election of tho<U+017F>e means that tend thereunto; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if an extorted re<U+017F>ignation be a means to procure
<U+017F>uch a good, as a freedom from that evil that is the
Object of fear, it cannot but be binding, where there
is no other Law (as in the conditihn of meer Nature)
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52129:156"/>
forbiddeth the performance; but <U+017F>uch Covenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acts of men, con<U+017F>idered as in the condition of War,
are therefore obliging no longer, than until there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eth
a new and ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of fear, and then he is much
obliged by the <U+017F>ame Law, that for Self-con<U+017F>ervation
commanded him to re<U+017F>ign up <U+017F>uch a Right, becau<U+017F>e
the re<U+017F>ervation of it was incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with his pre<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
to re-inve<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf with that right he relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<U+017F>hed,
if it be the only means for his <U+017F>afety, as before
he was to re<U+017F>ign it up.</p>
            <p>But it was alleged, That there was a ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e of
fear, though not in <hi>Agis,</hi> yet in <hi>Danpion</hi> his Heir, or
Repre<U+017F>entative, who had the <U+017F>entence of Death pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed
upon him, and therefore might ju<U+017F>tly <U+017F>eek to re-gain
the Kingdom, not only as his lawful inheritance, but
to pre<U+017F>erve him<U+017F>elf from the inva<U+017F>ions of <hi>Hiarbas,</hi>
there being nothing more rea<U+017F>onable than Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, the over-powring tho<U+017F>e Per<U+017F>ons that <U+017F>eek
ones de<U+017F>truction.</p>
            <p>But <U+017F>econdly, The people of <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>alia</hi> had given
the <U+017F>overaignty to tho<U+017F>e that were lineally de<U+017F>cended
of <hi>Agis</hi>'s Ance<U+017F>tors, and therefore were bound by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to obey them, as their lawful Soveraigns:
Con<U+017F>equently <hi>Agis,</hi> though he might di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e of the
Government during his life, yet not of the Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ion;
becau<U+017F>e he derived no <U+017F>uch authority from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Soveraigntie, the Multitude, in the fir<U+017F>t in<U+017F>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore the transferring of the right of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
from his Po<U+017F>terity to a <U+017F>tranger, was the giving
away anothers Propriety, or an a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting of one, in the
inva<U+017F>ion of another.</p>
            <p>Hence, <hi>Hiarbas</hi> was but a temporary King, to whom
the entire exerci<U+017F>e of Power was committed for a time;
which once expired, his Power mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o expire with
it: after which, his Government was but an unju<U+017F>t U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urpation,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52129:157"/>
or a wrongful detaining of anothers Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd thing they con<U+017F>ulted about, was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
of accompli<U+017F>hing: For Policy forbids any man
to ingage in a War, though for a ju<U+017F>t and lawful reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his own; unle<U+017F>s he can produce pregnant and
demon<U+017F>trative a<U+017F><U+017F>urances, that he <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>econded
with <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s. But they did not doubt of <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, for
the<U+017F>e Rea<U+017F>ons:</p>
            <p>Fir<U+017F>t becau<U+017F>e, the <U+017F>ooner any thing comes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
the <U+017F>ooner it declines to corruption and di<U+017F><U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
<U+017F>o the <U+017F>ooner any arrives at the height of power,
the nearer he is to his declen<U+017F>ion. And this was <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
ca<U+017F>e, being on a <U+017F>udden rebounded, by a <U+017F>trange
fortune, into the throne, from the ground of a hopele<U+017F>s
irre<U+017F>olution.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As in Nature, <U+017F>o in Government, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is permanent that is violent. For though for a
time a Tyrant <hi>(i.e.</hi> an unju<U+017F>t U<U+017F>urper, or po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>or of
anothers Power, to whom the right of <U+017F>overaignty in
Propriety belongs) though for <U+017F>ome time he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derprop
his <U+017F>tate with the Sword and Policy; yet in the
end, Divine Ju<U+017F>tice <U+017F>naps the Sword in <U+017F>under, infatuates
his Council, and makes his own the <U+017F>ubaltern cau<U+017F>es of
his down-fall.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Hiarbas,</hi> as he came to his Government by a
Politick violence, <U+017F>o he upheld it by the <U+017F>ame; and
therefore they feared not, but that fal<U+017F>e pretended right,
in<U+017F>cribed by the Sword-point, on the leaf of a Laurel,
would be di<U+017F><U+017F>ipated, like the Prophecies of that <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill,</hi>
that u<U+017F>ed Leaves for her Paper, by the bla<U+017F>ts of
Heavens Vengeance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That Government that is erected on the
Ba<U+017F>is of a Faction, cannot <U+017F>tand; becau<U+017F>e the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being too narrow for the Fabrick, and it having no
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52129:157"/>
Internal Principle of <U+017F>tability, mu<U+017F>t be upheld by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Props, and con<U+017F>equently <U+017F>ubject to di<U+017F><U+017F>olution,
upon the lea<U+017F>t failing of that force, by which it was
con<U+017F>tituted.</p>
            <p>But as the former was mo<U+017F>t apparently true in <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
his Government, <U+017F>o al<U+017F>o the latter; <hi>viz:</hi> That that
force that was the Architect of his <U+017F>overaignty, daily
declined thorow inte<U+017F>tine di<U+017F>order. The<U+017F>e, and many
other Rea<U+017F>ons that were then given, encouraged them
in their high enterprize.</p>
            <p>But as for the third thing, <hi>viz:</hi> the Honour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
that would redound, if their atchivements were
crowned with <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, that was <U+017F>o con<U+017F>picuous, as it
required no great con<U+017F>ideration. So that in Fine, this was
the re<U+017F>ult of the con<U+017F>ultation, That <hi>Athalus</hi> <U+017F>hould
march with his men to the Court, and pretend to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from <hi>Pandion,</hi> through an opinion of the merit
of <hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s Cau<U+017F>e; that <U+017F>ince <hi>Danpion</hi> was exiled
from thence, and none to nouri<U+017F>h Faction in the Court
or Kingdom, <hi>Athalus</hi> by that means might ingratiate
him<U+017F>elf with the King, and breed emulation among the
Nobles, and di<U+017F><U+017F>entions among the Commonalty; that
<U+017F>o by that means, they might fit all things in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s
again<U+017F>t the fir<U+017F>t acce<U+017F>s of a <U+017F>miling fortune. And
as for <hi>Danpion,</hi> it was thought not <U+017F>afe for him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru<U+017F>t
him<U+017F>elf in any part of the Kingdom, unle<U+017F>s di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>ed;
it was therefore re<U+017F>olved, that he <U+017F>hould attire
him<U+017F>elf in the habit of a Lady, and go to the Court as
a companion of <hi>Matilda</hi>'s, and <U+017F>o make that mask a
<U+017F>tep at once to reach the prize of his Ambition and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>The<U+017F>e things thus agreed on, <hi>Danpion</hi> arrayes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf
in a white <U+017F>ilken Robe, that taught from his <U+017F>houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to the ground, the train whereof <U+017F>trayed a pretty
di<U+017F>tance from his heels, and before was bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ned with
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52129:158"/>
rich Jewels, from his neck, to his knees, and there left
open to di<U+017F>cover the pure whitene<U+017F>s of his skin: His
leggs and feet were impri<U+017F>oned within the gilded La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth
of rich Buskins, which were fa<U+017F>tned under his
knee, with a mo<U+017F>t precious Jewel, where the ends of
all the Knots did centre and unite: His hair being
very long, after the <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>alian</hi> manner, hung loo<U+017F>ely,
and carele<U+017F>ly upon his <U+017F>houlders, having no other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
upon his head, than a lawn Veil ca<U+017F>t over his head,
face, and <U+017F>houlder, on the top of which, he wore a
Coronet of Gold, <U+017F>et with Diamonds, the antient Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of Virgin-Prince<U+017F><U+017F>es in <U+017F>ome parts of <hi>Greece.</hi> Thus
arrayed, he <U+017F>teps up into the Chariot, and <U+017F>its on the
right hand of <hi>Matilda,</hi> and accompanies her to the
Court, under the name of <hi>Celania;</hi> where in a <U+017F>hort
time they arrived, and were received by <hi>Hiarbas</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
notice given by a Herauld from <hi>Athalus,</hi> what they
were, and what the intents of their coming) with all
po<U+017F><U+017F>ible demon<U+017F>trations of Honour; not neglecting any
ceremonies or complements that appertain to State, but
manife<U+017F>ting all things that might expre<U+017F>s the greatne<U+017F>s
of a Princes mind, who <U+017F>corns to be overcome in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>ie.</p>
            <p>And as for the two Ladies, <hi>Celania</hi> and <hi>Matilda,</hi>
with the four Virgins that were the Attendants, they
were conducted by a chief Gentleman-U<U+017F>her, thorow
the outward Court, to a <U+017F>tately Gallery, that led into
a mo<U+017F>t beautiful Garden; where they were received by
a Lady of Honour, and thence led to the Prince<U+017F>s <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia;</hi>
who in her Chamber was <U+017F>et in a Chair of
State, under a mo<U+017F>t rich Canopy of cloth of gold, with
many young beautiful Ladies, clad in Crim<U+017F>on Damask,
attending on her.</p>
            <p>Among<U+017F>t whom, her mo<U+017F>t tran<U+017F>cendent beauty made
her <U+017F>hine, with as much <U+017F>uperiority, as the Sun doth over
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52129:158"/>
the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Luminaries; <U+017F>o excellent and incomparable
were the Graces that <U+017F>at en<U+017F>hrined in her lively Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
as <U+017F>he <U+017F>eemed as a perfect mirror of all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Maje<U+017F>ty; <U+017F>uch a miraculous compo<U+017F>ition of all
tho<U+017F>e Excellencies, that can at once both enravi<U+017F>h with
delight, and tran<U+017F>port with admiration: She <U+017F>eemed
(as indeed <U+017F>he was) a fitter <U+017F>ubject for the pen of
Angels, who<U+017F>e va<U+017F>t capacities render them more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to comprehend, as their being conver<U+017F>ant with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Glories, to de<U+017F>cribe the <U+017F>ublimity of her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
than any Mortal what<U+017F>oever; becau<U+017F>e, though
he had an under<U+017F>tanding as va<U+017F>t as the Creation, that he
could put a Girdle upon Nature, and might, like the
Bee, here and there extract the choyce<U+017F>t Flowers, that
grow in her Garden, to fill his invention with <U+017F>imili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
yet being cooped within the Univer<U+017F>e, he can
no more de<U+017F>cribe the perfection of her beauties, than a
Picture of the Sun can imitate its Splendor.</p>
            <p>In this <U+017F>tately po<U+017F>ture <U+017F>he <U+017F>ate, until the Ladies were
conducted into her pre<U+017F>ence, and then <U+017F>he aro<U+017F>e and

pourtray them, but mu<U+017F>t be va<U+017F>t debtors to her Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And that that added no <U+017F>mal lu<U+017F>tre to her Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
was her Magnanimity under this misfortune, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
rather that her heart <U+017F>hould break within, than her

Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, while<U+017F>t her outward e<U+017F>tate was a <U+017F>ervant

being at the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al of one, whom a double Antipathy,
both as a man, and an enemy made infinitely hateful;
yet by foyling it with her Vertue, <U+017F>he made <U+017F>erve, but
as an Ornament to the beauty of her Vertues: So that
the Clouds of <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s in her Countenance, made the
brighter reflections of the beams of a <U+017F>tately Maje<U+017F>ty.</p>
            <p>While<U+017F>t <hi>Pandion</hi> was taken up with the Pro<U+017F>pect of

gently did allay the <U+017F>urges of a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
them into a <U+017F>mooth Sea of contentment: For

            <p>But as he was farther <U+017F>peaking, he was interrupted

the ran<U+017F>acking and plundring of many Lords

(which was the King and him<U+017F>elf) in a <U+017F>ingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;

Realm, but the Realms immediate Heir, he could not
but judge ju<U+017F>t and honourable, upon which grounds
he hoped it would be <U+017F>o e<U+017F>teemed and accepted.</p>
            <p>The Herauld having his Me<U+017F><U+017F>age given him, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in the Apparel of his Office, attended by a

            <p>The King hearing it, replyed, That it was not the
cu<U+017F>tom of Kings to de<U+017F>cend to a private Duell with a
Subject, much le<U+017F>s with a Rebel; but if it was, that
his Cau<U+017F>e was not <U+017F>o unju<U+017F>t, that he feared <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, nor

to favour the ra<U+017F>h and fooli<U+017F>h: And were his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
never <U+017F>o low, he would have him know, that
Kings in their lowe<U+017F>t e<U+017F>tate, are highly con<U+017F>iderable,
and one grain of Maje<U+017F>ty will weigh down many
light pretences; though may be not in the Ballance of
popular judgment, yet in theirs who poize the Univer<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>And for his Kingdom and Daughter, though by
he did not know what blind fortune he had attained
<U+017F>ome part of the fir<U+017F>t, and by a ba<U+017F>e inferior Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with Traytors, <U+017F>uch as him<U+017F>elf, he had in<U+017F>nared

his pre<U+017F>umption, nor encourage his per<U+017F>everance, <U+017F>ince
the one will but add Unpardonablene<U+017F>s, and the
other an impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of recovery to his horrid Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
Therefore (<U+017F>aid he) I <U+017F>hall not <U+017F>eek to ran<U+017F>om

let him re<U+017F>ign both to my Protection, and him<U+017F>elf
to my Mercy. With this an<U+017F>wer the Herauld return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

de<U+017F>ired no other; the end of his Me<U+017F><U+017F>age being onely

the Room where <hi>Danpion</hi> was, intending to relea<U+017F>e him

but as <U+017F>oon as he <U+017F>eeth him, as if <hi>Danpion</hi>'s beauty had
turned him into Marble, he <U+017F>tands <U+017F>till, as if he grew to

the ground, and fixes his eye <U+017F>tedfa<U+017F>tly upon him, as if
he would inoculate his <U+017F>oul into him; at length, like one

not onely the lowe<U+017F>t conde<U+017F>cen<U+017F>ions, but the highe<U+017F>t

though in huge di<U+017F>proportion to your civilities;
<U+017F>o neither am I <U+017F>o happy, as not to be able to accu<U+017F>e my

of my misfortunes. Sir (<U+017F>aid the other) your
Noble thoughts are too much bu<U+017F>ied in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of goodne<U+017F>s, ever to admit of <U+017F>uch diver<U+017F>ions,
as the remembrance of <U+017F>o mean a Per<U+017F>on as my <U+017F>elf,
who have nothing in me that may merit regard, but
that I once <U+017F>erved your Highne<U+017F>s in the quality of a

expo<U+017F>ed you to the malice and tyranny of your
Enemy <hi>Hiarbas. Danpion</hi> hearing this, fell upon his
neck, and embraced him, and even wept with joy, the
tears trickling down, like rain in Sun-<U+017F>hine. After
<U+017F>ome mutual te<U+017F>timony of great endearments that pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed

asked him pardon for his trayterous adhering to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
but the rea<U+017F>on of it (he <U+017F>aid) was partly through
fear, being terrified with the lo<U+017F>s of all that nature and

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:52129:167"/>
of di<U+017F>covery; and partly for gain, being bribed
with liberal gifts, and great honors, above what he
knew how to manage, being made Commander of
the Ca<U+017F>tle where <hi>Pandion</hi> chiefly had his re<U+017F>idence;
all which he the more freely accepted, becau<U+017F>e he then

            <p>This <U+017F>aid, they fell into di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e about <hi>Danpions</hi>

            <p>Long had they not been <U+017F>eparated, ere <hi>Danpion</hi>

The<U+017F>e and the like words did <hi>Danpion</hi> utter; and thus
did he <U+017F>acrifize him<U+017F>elf to an unexpre<U+017F><U+017F>ible pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, who
in all things el<U+017F>e <U+017F>hewed him<U+017F>elf commander of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted

who perceiving that <hi>Hiarbas</hi> was re<U+017F>olute in his

what his wi<U+017F>dom had re<U+017F>olved upon, thought it

from whom he could challenge no protection, and
therefore he again <U+017F>ends an Envoy with certain Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>als
to the King. The <U+017F>um of which was this, That if
the King regarded either his own or his Daughters
<U+017F>afety or honor, he <U+017F>hould retreat with his men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e
he mu<U+017F>t not hope for any other entertainment for
him<U+017F>elf or her, than what a mortal enemy would be<U+017F>tow
on the mo<U+017F>t hateful per<U+017F>on. And to let them <U+017F>ee that
his performance <U+017F>hould be of an equal extent with his
threatnings, before the me<U+017F><U+017F>enger could deliver his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
receive an an<U+017F>wer, and return, <hi>Pandion</hi> had cau<U+017F>ed
a Scaffold to be erected, whereon pre<U+017F>ently appeared
a mo<U+017F>t excellent Lady, lead between two executioners,
whom both by her Garments, and the Maje<U+017F>ty that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled
her deportments, <hi>Hiarbas</hi> knew to be his
Daughter, for there <U+017F>eemed in her (as well as he could
perceive at <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>tance) the <U+017F>ame delicate loveline<U+017F>s,
lovely excellency, Maje<U+017F>tick <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s, as were the
ingredients of <U+017F>o divine a compo<U+017F>ition as <hi>Amphigenia</hi>'s
Beauty; and if the <U+017F>ame perfections, then <U+017F>ure the
<U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on, <U+017F>ince none could boa<U+017F>t of an equality with
her, in whom appeared all the excellencies, not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Nature had, but wherewith <U+017F>he could beautifie a
body. A lamentable <U+017F>ight it was to <U+017F>ee, the Diamond
of the World <U+017F>et in an endle<U+017F>s Ring of mi<U+017F>eries; to <U+017F>ee

the Theatre of Love and Beauty; to <U+017F>ee her to whom
all hearts do homage, to bow to an injurious fortune.
And that that did extort pity from the cruelle<U+017F>t heart,
was the manner of her ge<U+017F>tures, wherewith <U+017F>he <U+017F>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Antedate her mi<U+017F>ery, and make mi<U+017F>ery it <U+017F>elf
more mi<U+017F>erable, at lea<U+017F>t more lamentable; for her eyes
were fixt on Heaven, as if <U+017F>he meant to dart her Soul

thither, and prevent her enemies cruelty; her tongue
not profu<U+017F>e of words, her <U+017F>orrow <U+017F>eeming to feed it <U+017F>elf
with inward contemplation; yet tho<U+017F>e few wherein <U+017F>he
embodied her thoughts, were guarded with <U+017F>uch a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating
force, as would have compelled a Tyrants heart,
to pitty her <U+017F>orrow; but they were no <U+017F>ooner Midwived
by her tongue, than <U+017F>wadled up in Air, and <U+017F>o bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Heaven, that few ears could boa<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves to
be the Nur<U+017F>eries of <U+017F>uch Divine off-<U+017F>prings of a Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Soul. Her hands were cla<U+017F>ped and folded each in

arms not extended at their length, but <U+017F>omething bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<U+017F>eemed to embrace <U+017F>orrow, not as an unju<U+017F>t effect

            <p>In fine, in all her ge<U+017F>tures, there was <U+017F>uch a Maje<U+017F>tick
humility, conquering <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, unconquered Piety,

of what a great mind could do, depre<U+017F><U+017F>ed under the
lowe<U+017F>t fortune. But though the beholders, yea the actors
were <U+017F>o acted by pity, as to pour forth their <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of
her condition in tears, and (as it were) by a repentance
to wa<U+017F>h way the crime before Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, yet at length
as if the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion had bani<U+017F>hed away all
thoughts of the crime, not the act, when they <U+017F>aw

Fla<U+017F>hes flew from his eyes, as if he meant to <U+017F>et the

in his Trea<U+017F>ons, <U+017F>o he might be exemplary in his

            <p>
               <hi>Pandion</hi> amazed at this <U+017F>udden turn of the wheel of

him<U+017F>elf in a Throne on purpo<U+017F>e prepared, with a
Crown on his head, the Scepter in his hand, and the
Sword born before him.</p>
            <p>The King thus forced to act over a Pageant-like

and to add <U+017F>olemnity to cruelty, <U+017F>its in the Throne,
with a heavy but imperious look, that the Beams of
Maje<U+017F>ty <U+017F>eemed to unite and centre in his contracted

and <U+017F>et it on <hi>Pandions</hi> head.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he had unju<U+017F>tly u<U+017F>urped the power of
admini<U+017F>tration of Ju<U+017F>tice, to the general endamage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Fourth, That he had u<U+017F>urped the Royal Throne,
from the lawful inheritor; this was no <U+017F>ooner with a

was compelled to ari<U+017F>e out of the Throne.</p>
            <p>La<U+017F>tly, It was proclaimed, that as he was by univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>al

by great acclamations of the people, that
cryed, <hi>God <U+017F>ave King</hi> Pandion.</p>
            <p>Thus was this great Prince, one not unde<U+017F>erving

Ju<U+017F>tice, Prudence, and Temperance, which are the

one who never before was unfortunate, unle<U+017F>s in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too great a courter of Fortune; thus (I <U+017F>ay) was
this <U+017F>o brave, <U+017F>o great a Prince on the <U+017F>udden thrown
from the top of the highe<U+017F>t pinacle of honor and <U+017F>ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,

            <p>
               <hi>Pandion</hi> having <U+017F>at a while in great <U+017F>tate, ari<U+017F>es out

Lords and Commanders, and guarded with <U+017F>ouldiers,
<hi>Hiarbas</hi>'s General all the while bearing the <U+017F>word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; where having pau<U+017F>ed a while on this <U+017F>udden,
and no le<U+017F>s <U+017F>trange, than <U+017F>udden mutation, the thoughts

            <p>In fine, to <U+017F>ee him who late thundered from a
Throne, who<U+017F>e voice was power, and who<U+017F>e looks

con<U+017F>idering that the manyfold exactions and impo<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
laid upon the people by <hi>Hiarbas</hi> to maintain his
Army, had provoked them again<U+017F>t both him<U+017F>elf and
