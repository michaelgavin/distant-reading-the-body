            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS I have long had an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of pre<U+017F>enting <U+017F>ome E<U+017F><U+017F>ay to Your Grace's Patronage, I was likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that no Performance (which was entirely my own) could, without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>umption, a<U+017F>pire to that Honour: But this Addre<U+017F>s comes Arm'd with a double Apology; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fix'd Reputation of the
<pb facs="tcp:56010:3"/>Work in the Original, but on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Tran<U+017F>lation it <U+017F>elf, being half perform'd by a Per<U+017F>on of Quality and Judgement. By who<U+017F>e untimely Death we were deny'd the Happine<U+017F>s of his far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Progre<U+017F>s, and I was prevail'd with to think that the World would rather di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>e with my cour<U+017F>e fini<U+017F>hing of the Piece, than lo<U+017F>e the part which he had <U+017F>o well begun.

               <p>It was a young Lady, <U+017F>itting upon a Rock, of <U+017F>o rare and perfect a Beauty, as one would have taken her for a Godde<U+017F>s, and though her pre<U+017F>ent mi<U+017F>ery oppre<U+017F>t her with extreame<U+017F>t grief, yet in the greatne<U+017F>s of her affliction, they might ea<U+017F>ily perceive the greatne<U+017F>s of her Courage: A Laurel crown'd her Head, and a Quiver in a Scarf hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her back; <U+017F>he re<U+017F>ted her left Arm upon her Bow, and let her Hand carele<U+017F>ly hang down upon her right Thigh; <U+017F>he leaned on her other Arm, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Cheek upon her hand, and fixing her eyes upon a young Gentleman that lay not far di<U+017F>tant from her; he was covered in his wounds, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56010:9"/>now began to rai<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf a little, as if awaking out of a deep <U+017F>leep, almo<U+017F>t of Death if <U+017F>elf; yet <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>tock of Beauty <U+017F>hined in his Face, and the Blood that rained down <U+017F>o <U+017F>etoff the whitene<U+017F>s of his Skin, as made him <U+017F>hew mo<U+017F>t lovely; the pain he felt, <U+017F>eemed to weigh down his Eye-lids, and the Beauty of the Lady, to attract and open them.</p>
               <p>He had no <U+017F>ooner recollected his Spirits, and <U+017F>carce breath'd, but with a langui<U+017F>hing voice he pronounced the<U+017F>e words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sweete<U+017F>t, Is it true that I yet behold you Living, or (peri<U+017F>hing in the execution) have you encrea<U+017F>ed the number of the dead? can you not, not even in Death be ravi<U+017F>hed from me, but will your <U+017F>hadow be yet a loooker on, and <U+017F>harer in my Fortunes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is from you reply'd the Maid that I expect my Fortune, Life or Death; this you here <U+017F>ee (<U+017F>hewing him a Steeletto in her lap) hath yet not done its office, hindered by the happy <U+017F>igns of your recovery.</p>
               <p>This <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he leaped from the Rock, and the Thieves upon the Mountains <U+017F>urprized with fear and a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment ran to hide them<U+017F>elves behind the Bu<U+017F>hes: For <U+017F>he appeared more Divine when <U+017F>he was upon her Feet; her Arrows in her Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cla<U+017F>hing as <U+017F>he <U+017F>tepped, her Robe (that was Cloth of Gold) glittering in the Sun, and her Hair that <U+017F>lowedunder her Coronet (like the Prie<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Bacchus</hi>) reaching almo<U+017F>t to the ground.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56010:9"/>others conceived her to be a Votare<U+017F>s to <U+017F>ome God, that in<U+017F>pired with divine fury had made <U+017F>o great a <U+017F>laughter.</p>
               <p>This while the Maid running to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ca<U+017F>t her<U+017F>elf upon his Body, wept, ki<U+017F>t him, wiped his wounds, and imbraced him <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>ely as if <U+017F>he could hardly be a<U+017F><U+017F>ured <U+017F>he had him in her Arms.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ob<U+017F>erving this, pre<U+017F>ently alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Opinions; What, <U+017F>aid they, are the<U+017F>e the actions of a Godde<U+017F>s? do Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es ki<U+017F>s dead Men? and with <U+017F>o much commi<U+017F>eration! So en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging one another, they marched on, and found the Lady dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing the young mans wounds, and coming clo<U+017F>e behind her, did not dare to attempt any thing, not <U+017F>o much as to <U+017F>peak to her; but the noi<U+017F>e they had made, and their <U+017F>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows ca<U+017F>t before her Eyes, moved her to turn her Head; and when <U+017F>he had <U+017F>een them, <U+017F>he again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined her Face; and applyed her <U+017F>elf to bind up her friends wounds, not <U+017F>o much as the lea<U+017F>t daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the unu<U+017F>ual A<U+017F>pect, and colour of the<U+017F>e ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> So powerful is <U+017F>incere affection, as it de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>es all other plea<U+017F>ing or di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ing things, and tran<U+017F>ports our whole care and thoughts to the object we love deare<U+017F>t: But when the Thieves pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed on, and <U+017F>tood in front before her, and <U+017F>eemed as if they would attempt <U+017F>omething, <U+017F>he lifted up her Eyes again, and <U+017F>eeing them <U+017F>o black and ugly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you be</hi> (<U+017F>he <U+017F>aid) <hi>the<U+017F>e dead mens Spirits, you

               <p>But they (neither under<U+017F>tanding her words nor meaning) left her with the wounded Gentleman, not putting any <U+017F>urer guard upon them then their own weakne<U+017F>s; and ha<U+017F>ting to the Ship, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laded her, every man carrying out as much Gold, Silver, Precious Stones and Silks, as they were able to bear, neglecting other Commodities (tho' rich and various) and when they had every one as much as <U+017F>atisfied their Avarice, they lay'd it down upon the <U+017F>hoar, making it up into packs, and dividing it, not by rea<U+017F>on, or after the ju<U+017F>t value of the things, but equalling them by weight, re<U+017F>erving for the la<U+017F>t, to re<U+017F>olve what to do with the young Gentleman and the Lady.</p>
               <p>Mean while there appears upon the Mountains a <U+017F>econd Company, two riding before them as their Captains; the<U+017F>e were no <U+017F>ooner perceived by the former, but without preparing for the fight, or daring to take with them any part of of the <U+017F>poil, le<U+017F>t it might give occa<U+017F>ion to the Enemy to pur<U+017F>ue; the fear that <U+017F>trook their hearts, made them take their heels with the greate<U+017F>t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56010:10"/>that was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, for they were but Ten, and tho<U+017F>e they <U+017F>aw coming were twice that number. Thus the Lady was twice taken, and yet not Pri<U+017F>oner. Now the<U+017F>e others, though they had an extream longing to be at the pillage, and had already devoured it in their hopes, yet the Apprehen<U+017F>ion, that troubled their Spirits, not knowing the cau<U+017F>e of the<U+017F>e events, retained them for a while; for they imagined the fir<U+017F>t Thieves had made that horrible Slaughter; and ob<U+017F>erving the Lady in all the dangers that threatned her, to be no more afraid than if there had been no <U+017F>uch thing, careful only of the young man's wounds, that <U+017F>eemed to pain her more, than if they had been her own; they remained mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amazed, as well at the genero<U+017F>ity of her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and rarene<U+017F>s of her Beauty, as at the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <U+017F>hape and exact <U+017F>tature of the wounded young man; who began to re<U+017F>ume his natural Colour: After they had long con<U+017F>idered, their Captain <U+017F>tept forth, and took her by the hand, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to ri<U+017F>e and go with him; but <U+017F>he that under<U+017F>tood not his Language, and yet doubted what he meant, drew the young Gentleman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long (nor would he part with her) and <U+017F>etting her Steeletto to her Brea<U+017F>t, threatned to kill her <U+017F>elf, if they might not go together: The Captain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding her more by action and <U+017F>igns, than by her words, and hoping if the young Gentleman recovered, he would <U+017F>erve him in de<U+017F>igns of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Nature; made his Page alight, and he al<U+017F>o

               <p>But the Cau<U+017F>e of their taking <hi>Thyamis,</hi> was this, he had at <hi>Memphis</hi> a Brother named <hi>Peto<U+017F>iris,</hi> who having by his plots di<U+017F>po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed his Brother of the Dignity of Chief Prie<U+017F>t, again<U+017F>t the Laws and In<U+017F>titutions of the Countrey, (for he was his younger Brother) and hearing that he was the Captain of the<U+017F>e Thieves, he feared <hi>Thyamis</hi> would take time to cha<U+017F>e him out of his u<U+017F>urped Honour, and di<U+017F>cover his perfidiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s: al<U+017F>o he de<U+017F>ired to take away the ill opinion that many had conceived of him, that he had killed his Brother, becau<U+017F>e it appeared not where he was; therefore <U+017F>ending Me<U+017F><U+017F>engers to the Villages of the Thieves, he propo<U+017F>ed a great Sum of Money, and <U+017F>o many Ca<U+017F>tles to any one that would take him alive; <U+017F>o as the<U+017F>e Thieves charmed with the hope of <U+017F>uch a Profit, even in the heat of Blood and War, did not forget their Promi<U+017F>e, but after he was di<U+017F>covered, took him alive, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny died for it: Being thus <U+017F>eized of <hi>Thyamis,</hi> they rowed to Land, putting him in Irons, and appointing half of their Troops to guard him, who vexing at his Fortune, upbraided them of

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56010:32"/>could penetrate to the bottom, the violence of it being repell'd and broke with a thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>everal Turnings. At this <hi>Theagenes</hi> began to breath a little, and thought long till he <U+017F>hould come to the I<U+017F>land, which he had already pre<U+017F>ented to his Thoughts, and taken up his Marriage-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Cave, not imagining the Complaints he <U+017F>hould make, nor the Tears he <U+017F>hould there <U+017F>hed.</p>
               <p>Thus they rowed towards the I<U+017F>land, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves playing the Watermen; for he that rowed them the day before, at the fir<U+017F>t Alarum and Cry of the Enemy, had fallen overboard.

Would you heve me tell you how the Moon excells the Stars? <U+017F>aid I: But <U+017F>ome commended the Young <hi>The<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>alian,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Charicles,</hi> and gave him the <U+017F>econd place; yes, and the third too, I replyed; but the Crown and Eye of all the Pomp was really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be your Daughter: this plea<U+017F>ed <hi>Charicles</hi> at the Heart, and I by <U+017F>peaking the truth, did prepare way to my Aim, being only to make the man confident in me; who <U+017F>miling, told me, he was then going to her and that if it plea<U+017F>ed me I <U+017F>hould go along with him to vi<U+017F>it her, and know if the great pre<U+017F>es and tumult of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had not troubled her, I was glad of the of fer, yet I <U+017F>eemed to neglect <U+017F>ome other bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to attend him.</p>
               <p>When we were come to the Lodgings where <U+017F>he had retired her <U+017F>elf, we entred her Chamber, and found her langui<U+017F>hing upon her Bed, not able to re<U+017F>t, Love bathing in the Moi<U+017F>ture of her Eyes, <U+017F>he imbracing her Father as <U+017F>he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>tomed, and he asking her how <U+017F>he did? <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid, her Head aked; and that <U+017F>he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly take a little re<U+017F>t.

               <p>Next Morning, coming to <hi>Chariclea</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I found others of her Friends weeping, but <hi>Charicles</hi> mo<U+017F>t bitterly: I asked him, what the Matter was?

               <p>Now being alone with her, I began to play my part, as a Mountebank upon a Stage; I put the Incen<U+017F>e in the Fire, and made as if I muttered certain Prayers betwixt my Lips; I

               <p>Then I began to take <U+017F>tate upon me, looking <U+017F>uper<U+017F>iliou<U+017F>ly, and walking gravely; There was

               <p>O Gods! I cried, what do you <U+017F>ay? mu<U+017F>t then my Daughter peri<U+017F>h? Is there no hope of her Recovery?</p>

I intreating him if he under<U+017F>tood the Nature of her Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e, to let me know it: There is no Child, <U+017F>aid he, but may know it is a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the Mind, and evidently the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e that we call Love; do you not <U+017F>ee that her Eyes are <U+017F>welled, her Countenance di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>ed, Her Colour pale; yet <U+017F>he complained not of any Pain in her Heart; add that her mind wanders; what falls into her thoughts <U+017F>he <U+017F>peaks, and cau<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s cares do trouble her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e.

I was hardly out of the Gate, but I perceiv'd <hi>Charicles,</hi> hanging down his Head, as oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ed with extreme grief: This is a <U+017F>trange humour, worthy <hi>Charicles,</hi> (<U+017F>aid I) to appear in this <U+017F>ort afflicted, when you ought to <U+017F>ill your heart with Joy, and offer Sacrifice and Thank<U+017F>giving in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Gods having now granted your long fuit, and ble<U+017F><U+017F>ed the <U+017F>ecrets of my knowledge and endeavours to her, incliming her mind to a de<U+017F>ire of Marriage: Lord, why <U+017F>hould you weep, I prote<U+017F>t I cannot imagine the rea<U+017F>on.

               <p>Then he demanding what were be<U+017F>t to be done to win his Daughter; If haply, <U+017F>aid I, you have yet any Jewels or rich Embroideries, or <U+017F>ome Ring of a great value, let <hi>Alcamenes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent them to her, as Marriage-gifts, and this will charm her to be his; then you mu<U+017F>t make other preparations for the <U+017F>olemnity, and make no delay, but conclude the Marriage, whil<U+017F>t yet the power of my Art is working, and makes impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in her Soul.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56010:83"/>but he ran with joy to put them in Act, and did as I entreated him, without any procra<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as afterwards I under<U+017F>tood, carrying to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> as Nuptial gifts from <hi>Alcamenes,</hi> not only rich Ve<U+017F>tures, but al<U+017F>o the precious Jewels <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi> had put in her Cradle, when <U+017F>he was expo<U+017F>ed.</p>
               <p>But I went pre<U+017F>ently to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and asked him where his <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>alians</hi> were, that did a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t at the ceremony of the Proce<U+017F><U+017F>ion: He told me, the Ladies were gone <U+017F>oftly before, to make the ea<U+017F>ier Journeys; and how the young men burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <U+017F>o great a de<U+017F>ire to <U+017F>ee their Friends at home, as be hardly had power to <U+017F>tay them any longer: Under<U+017F>tanding that, I in<U+017F>tructed him what he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>ay to them, and what they <U+017F>hould do, commanding him he <U+017F>hould ob<U+017F>erve when I would give the <U+017F>ign, and then take heed not to lo<U+017F>e the time and occa<U+017F>ion offered: <U+017F>o I left him.</p>
               <p>And going to the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make my Prayer to the God, that he would plea<U+017F>e, by his Oracle, to direct me what cour<U+017F>e I would take to convey away the two young Lovers; but the God was <U+017F>wifter than a thought, for the Heavenly powers do favour <U+017F>uch as re<U+017F>ign their will to theirs, though not implored; often preventing mens Petitions with their bounty; as at this time <hi>Apollo</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated my demand, with his reply, making me know his plea<U+017F>ure and direction; for as I
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56010:84"/>was ha<U+017F>ting towards the Prophete<U+017F>s, troubled in my mind how I might execute my de<U+017F>ign, a voice <U+017F>tayed me as I pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed, <U+017F>aying, Do you go <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t, and hear not how the<U+017F>e Strangers call you? They were a company of Merchants, that to the <U+017F>ound of Flutes and Hoboys, were doing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and celebrating a Fea<U+017F>t in Honour of <hi>Hercules.</hi>

               <p>I <U+017F>tayed when I perceived them, for I <U+017F>hould have offended the Sacred My<U+017F>teries of Religion, to have pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed by them without re<U+017F>pect, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Voice having invited me, after I had put Frankincen<U+017F>e in a Thurible, and incen<U+017F>ed the Altar, offering a little Water, it <U+017F>eem'd they thought me very <U+017F>umptuous in my oblations, and intreated me to take part of their Banquet; I obeyed them <U+017F>o far, and when I was <U+017F>et down upon a Couch, which the <U+017F>trangers had <U+017F>trew'd with Myrrh and Bays, and had ta<U+017F>ted <U+017F>uch things as I u<U+017F>ed to eat: Noble Gentlemen, <U+017F>aid I, you have done me the Honour to fea<U+017F>t me <U+017F>o, as I cannot de<U+017F>ire any greater dainties, I now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long to know your E<U+017F>tate and Fortunes, therefore now it is time, if you plea<U+017F>e, to tell me who, and of what Country you are, for it would be rude, and an Incivility in me, having <U+017F>at with you at the Fea<U+017F>t of a Sacrifice, and imitated Friend<U+017F>hip by you, by the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <U+017F>acred repa<U+017F>t, if we <U+017F>hould part without having a more particular knowledge one of the other.

Is that your re<U+017F>olution, <U+017F>aid I? They told me it was: You <U+017F>hall have me your Companion, I reply'd, if you will give me leave, for I mu<U+017F>t make a Voyage into <hi>Sicily,</hi> about my affairs, and you know tho<U+017F>e that Sail for <hi>Africa,</hi> mu<U+017F>t pa<U+017F>s by this I<U+017F>land. If you plea<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid they) we <U+017F>hall be happy in your Company, for we <U+017F>hall make

I de<U+017F>ired (I <U+017F>aid to them) if you will but give me one day to prepare my <U+017F>elf, and before I go, to give <U+017F>ome order for my bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s here: You <U+017F>hall have all to morrow, they reply'd, provided you come a-board us <U+017F>oon at night, for the night is very <U+017F>erviceable to us, <U+017F>mall breaths of Wind ri<U+017F>ing from the Earth, and wafting away a Ship, without moving of great Waves.</p>
               <p>I promi<U+017F>ed not to fail, fir<U+017F>t taking their Faith by Oath, they <U+017F>hould not loo<U+017F>e to Sea before the time appointed; and <U+017F>o I left them Dancing to their Mu<U+017F>ick, that play'd quick <U+017F>trains like Jiggs, which they footed in the <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>yrian</hi> garb; <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with little Skips capering in the Air, <U+017F>ometimes bending their Knees to the Earth, and skrewing their whole Bodies, as if they had been po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with <U+017F>ome prophetick Spirit. And coming to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> I found her with the Jewels yet in her lap, that <hi>Charicles</hi> had pre<U+017F>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her: Then I went to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and having advertis'd them both what they <U+017F>hould do; I retir'd to my Lodging, attending with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the i<U+017F><U+017F>ue of my project.</p>
               <p>The next day this happen'd. When Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night drown'd all the Town in Sleep: A Troop of Young Gentlemen Armed, be<U+017F>ieg'd the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Chariclea. Theagenes</hi> was Captain of

Finally, they made <U+017F>uch a noi<U+017F>e, as the Mountain <hi>Parna<U+017F><U+017F>us</hi> echo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and replyed to the cla<U+017F>hing of their Iron: And thus marching out of the Town, they did ride upon the Spurr, to the Mountains of the <hi>Locrians</hi> and <hi>Oetians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclen,</hi> doing as I advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed them, left the <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>alians,</hi> and came <U+017F>ecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where I expected them: Where falling at my Feet, they trembling cry'd, Save us, Father; Father, Save us: <hi>Chariclea</hi> blu<U+017F>hing, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Face to the Earth, as a<U+017F>ham'd of her new Act: But <hi>Theagenes,</hi> to his other Supplications, added, Save O <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> two Poor Strangers
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56010:86"/>thy Suppliants, exiled from their Country, depriv'd of their Friends: Only to purcha<U+017F>e thee for all; pre<U+017F>erve two Poor Creatures, now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the power of Fortune; the Captives of cha<U+017F>t Love bani<U+017F>hed, but voluntarily ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed, and with joy repo<U+017F>ing in you all their hope of <U+017F>afety. The<U+017F>e words, <hi>Knemon,</hi> <U+017F>o touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me at the heart with pity, as I wept upon them with my Soul more than with my Eyes, <U+017F>o as they perceived not my <U+017F>orrow, yet I ea<U+017F>ed my Spirits; I did rai<U+017F>e and comfort them the be<U+017F>t I could: To conclude, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring them of a happy I<U+017F><U+017F>ue, and that I had au<U+017F>picated this bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, by the Commandment of the Gods. I will now go, <U+017F>aid I, and di<U+017F>patch the re<U+017F>t: Do you expect me in his place, taking a <U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al regard, you be not ob<U+017F>erv'd by any. Then I was going away; But <hi>Chariclea</hi> caught me by a part of my Robe and <U+017F>tayed me: O Father, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, this beginning were inju<U+017F>tice, rather a betraying, if you <U+017F>hould go and leave me alone with <hi>Theagenes,</hi> not con<U+017F>idering how unfaithful a Guard a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is, having the cau<U+017F>er of his flames in his own power. Therefore I will not <U+017F>eave you, till for this pre<U+017F>ent, and the time to come, you <U+017F>hall oblige <hi>Theagenes</hi> by vow; not to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune me, for any favour in that kind, before I do recover my Country and Parents. Or if Heaven be not <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ed, yet till <U+017F>uch time as with my con<U+017F>ent, he <U+017F>hall receive me for his

Admiring the vertues of the Maid, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>olved it <U+017F>hould be done accordingly: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Altar of a Table, taking Fire from the Chimny, <hi>Theagenes</hi> made his vow, profe<U+017F><U+017F>ing we had done him wrong, to cut off, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of an Oath, the voluntary intregrity of his Soul, and that he could not commend an Act done for fear, though of the Gods: Yet he did <U+017F>wear by <hi>Apollo</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> by <hi>Diana,</hi> by <hi>Venus</hi> her <U+017F>elf and Love, to do nothing that <U+017F>hould di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e <hi>Chariclea.</hi> Thus calling the Gods to Witne<U+017F>s; they accorded the<U+017F>e, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles betwixt them.</p>
               <p>I holding on my cour<U+017F>e to <hi>Charicles,</hi> found his Hou<U+017F>e full of Tears and Tumult: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<U+017F>much as the Servants of <hi>Chariclea</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready brought him news of the carrying away of his Daughter, and Citizens came in from all parts of the Town, and flocked about de<U+017F>pairing <hi>Charicles.</hi> In <U+017F>umm, the ignorance of what was done, and the want of Coun<U+017F>el in what was to be done, confu<U+017F>ed them all: I therefore thundering among<U+017F>t them with a loud voice; O mi<U+017F>erable Men (<U+017F>aid I) how long will you <U+017F>tand like <U+017F>tupid things, mute and dull, as if you were deprived of your Judgment with your Fortune? What will you not Arm and pur<U+017F>ue your Enemies? Will you not take and puni<U+017F>h them who have done you <U+017F>uch an injury? But <hi>Charicles</hi> replied, it were perhaps <U+017F>uperfluous and vain to <U+017F>truggle longer with the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters, for I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56010:87"/>am a<U+017F><U+017F>ured the Divine wrath inflicts this puni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon me; when coming once at a forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hour into the Sanctuary of our Temple, I <U+017F>aw what was not lawful for Man to behold. Then the God foretold me, for my pre<U+017F>umption I <U+017F>hould be deprived of that was deare<U+017F>t to my Eyes: yet let not this hinder you to fight (as they <U+017F>ay) with the Gods them<U+017F>elves, if we knew whither we <U+017F>hould go, and who hath been <U+017F>o cruel to us: It was (<U+017F>aid I) even the <hi>The<U+017F><U+017F>alian</hi> whom you <U+017F>o much admired, and would needs make me acquainted with him; it was <hi>Theagenes</hi> and his youthful company; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may find <U+017F>ome of them yet in Town, for <U+017F>ure they cannot be all departed; therefore ri<U+017F>e and call a Council of the people. It was done <U+017F>o as I appointed, and the Captains <U+017F>ent their Men to proclaim, by <U+017F>ound of Trumpet, that the Town<U+017F>men <U+017F>hould a<U+017F><U+017F>emble: immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the people came in, and they held a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, by night, upon the Theatre.</p>

               <p>But I (having heard the Pylot <U+017F>ay we <U+017F>hould winter in that I<U+017F>land) went along by the Sea-Coa<U+017F>t, to enquire out <U+017F>ome poor Lodging for us, not being willing to remain in the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, but avoiding it, for the trouble of the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as an inconvenient Lodging; and <U+017F>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Town, as un<U+017F>afe, for concealing the flight of the two young Lovers. I had not gone far, but I <U+017F>aw an old Fi<U+017F>herman <U+017F>itting before his door, mending his Broken Nets; and approaching him, I <U+017F>aid; Save you, hone<U+017F>t man, I pray you tell me if there be a Lodging to be taken hereabouts? It was about yonder Promontory, replied he, that I ca<U+017F>t this Net ye<U+017F>terday, upon a Rock covered with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <U+017F>o tore it as you <U+017F>ee; I do not ask you that, <U+017F>aid I, but you <U+017F>hall do an office of humanity if you will receive me into your hou<U+017F>e, or <U+017F>hew me <U+017F>ome other place, where I may lodge. It was not I, <U+017F>aid the good man, I was not in the Boat, Heaven forbid <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> <U+017F>hould mi<U+017F>take <U+017F>o gro<U+017F>sly, or that Age had <U+017F>o much infeebled his Brain: It was the fault of my Boys, that, ignorant of the places where the Water covered the Rocks, ca<U+017F>t their Nets where they <U+017F>hould not.</p>

               <p>At length perceiving he was <U+017F>omewhat deaf, I began to <U+017F>peak more loud.

The Gods con<U+017F>erve you al<U+017F>o, he then replied, if it plea<U+017F>e you to take <U+017F>uch poor entertainment as I am able to give you, you <U+017F>hall be welcome to me, unle<U+017F>s you be <U+017F>ome of tho<U+017F>e that look for Hou<U+017F>es furni<U+017F>hed with fair Beds, or have many followers: After I had told him we were but three, my two Children and my <U+017F>elf; It is a good number, replied he, you <U+017F>hall find but one more with us, for I have two Children yet at home, (their elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are married men, and hou<U+017F>e-keepers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves) and the fourth is the Nur<U+017F>e of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for their Mother is lately dead; therefore, Sir, make no delay, and doubt not but we will receive you joyfully and chearfully, I having known as <U+017F>oon as I heard you <U+017F>peak, you were a Gentleman, by your fa<U+017F>hion.</p>
               <p>I did <U+017F>o, and immediately coming with <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> the good man <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained us with a very good will, and gave us the better and warmer part of his Hou<U+017F>e: And indeed at the beginning we pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the Winter contentedly, remaining all the day long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, never parting but at the hour of Bed-time. <hi>Chariclea</hi> did lie with the Nur<U+017F>e, <hi>Theagenes</hi> and I in a room by our <U+017F>elves; and in another little

               <p>But once unhappy, and ever unhappy (as they <U+017F>ay.)

               <p>The Gods, <U+017F>aid I, be as good to you as you have <U+017F>hewed your <U+017F>elf true to us. But <hi>Tyrrhenus,</hi> how came you to di<U+017F>cover this Plot?

               <p>When I had heard this news, I retired very <U+017F>ad, and agitated in my fancy many ways and means of <U+017F>a<U+017F>ety, till accidently meeting the Merchant, and he moving me in his old Suit, I took hold of the occa<U+017F>ion, and concealing what I plea<U+017F>ed of the Adverti<U+017F>ements given me by <hi>Tyrrhenus.</hi> I only told him, I had notice given

But that which mo<U+017F>t moved him to <U+017F>peed his Voyage, was to gain <U+017F>ome Road or Port; becau<U+017F>e afar off he de<U+017F>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Pirate's Galley, that came full in his Poop; for, <U+017F>aid he, From the time we loo<U+017F>ed from the <hi>Promontory</hi> of <hi>Candy,</hi> he hath always followed our Track and con<U+017F>tantly <U+017F>ailed, as if he were bound for the <U+017F>ame place; and I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erved he made the <U+017F>ame turns with us; having many times (the better to di<U+017F>cover him) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ly declined my Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el from her cour<U+017F>e: Some
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56010:107"/>were moved at the<U+017F>e words, encouraging their fellows to prepare for their defence; and <U+017F>ome there were neglected them, <U+017F>aying, It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for the le<U+017F><U+017F>er Bottoms to follow the cour<U+017F>e of a great Ship, as believing it to be guided by a more Experimented Pilot: the Day pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed on in this di<U+017F>pute; and it was about the hour the Labourer returns weary with his Travel, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving newly loo<U+017F>ed his Oxen; and now the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiled Wind began to langui<U+017F>h, and dimini<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by little and little, in the end it had no force at all, <U+017F>o as the breath it <U+017F>pent upon our Sails, <U+017F>erved only to <U+017F>hufle them together, not at all to blow us on: briefly it <U+017F>etled into a Calm as if it had <U+017F>et with the Sun, or to <U+017F>peak more properly, as if it would accommodate it <U+017F>elf to their de<U+017F>ign that cha<U+017F>ed us, becau<U+017F>e our Sails being more large than theirs, and by con<U+017F>equence requiring the more Wind. But as <U+017F>oon as this tranquillity of the Heavens had <U+017F>moothed the Seas, the Galley was come up to us <U+017F>ooner than I can <U+017F>peak it; for (as I believe) all that were within her put their Hands to the Oars; their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el al<U+017F>o being light and nimble of it <U+017F>elf; when they were very near us, a <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthian</hi> Pa<U+017F><U+017F>enger in our Ship cryed to us, Friends we are all undone, this is a Pirate, I know the Galley of <hi>Trachinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the report of this News, a <U+017F>udden fear <U+017F>eiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our whole Ship, and in a Calm we had a Tempe<U+017F>t, ri<U+017F>ing in tumult, Crys, Tears, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56010:107"/>running up and down, <U+017F>ome running under the Hatches, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>tanding upon the Decks, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the re<U+017F>t to endure the Fight, and there were <U+017F>ome would have got into the Long-boat and fled, till by their two long delay the Fight <U+017F>urprized them within the Ship, forceing them to remain, and to take in their Hands what they could find to defend them<U+017F>elves. <hi>Theage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> full of Courage burned with de<U+017F>ire of the Battel, but <hi>Chariclea</hi> and I with our Imbraces hindred him from attempting any thing, <U+017F>he vowing Death <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>eparate him from her, but the <U+017F>ame Sword <U+017F>hould give her the like wounds, and make her an equal <U+017F>harer in his Misfortune. But I (after I under<U+017F>tood our Enemy was <hi>Trachinus</hi>) prepared <U+017F>ome Sleights might afterwards do us good <U+017F>ervice, which fell out as I expected.</p>
               <p>For the Pirates approaching circled about our Ship, to make tryal if it were po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to take her without Blood; therefore they did attacque us, but <U+017F>till rowing about us, they would neither <U+017F>uffer us to go forward nor backward. Briefly it <U+017F>eemed as if they had Be<U+017F>ieged us, and would compel us to render our <U+017F>elves upon compo<U+017F>ition. O poor unfortunate Men, <U+017F>aid they, what Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s hath <U+017F>eized your Spirits? and why are you <U+017F>o deprived of Judgment, as thus to precipitate your <U+017F>elves into the danger of an evitable Death, by attempting to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t invincible Forces, to which yours are nothing? it is yet in your choice
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56010:108"/>to be dealt humanly withal, we permit you all that will to take your Long-boat and <U+017F>ave your <U+017F>elves. The<U+017F>e were their Propo<U+017F>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but tho<U+017F>e of our Ship <U+017F>o long as they fought only in words, and <U+017F>aw no Blood, were daring and re<U+017F>olute, and <U+017F>aid they would <U+017F>tand to it to the la<U+017F>t Man.</p>
               <p>But after one of the bolder Pirates had boarded us, putting all he met to the Sword, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us that the Ceremonies of War were Death and Slaughter, the re<U+017F>t of his Company imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately leaping after him; then the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> began to repent their Courage, and falling at his Feet, be<U+017F>eeched him to <U+017F>hew mercy to them, and they were ready to obey all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: and although the Pirates were now fle<U+017F>ht, and began to plea<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves in Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (for the <U+017F>ight of Blood doth irritate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Spirit) neverthele<U+017F>s by the Command of <hi>Trachinus,</hi> beyond all Expectation, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the Supplicants, and made a Peace under <U+017F>uch conditions as were more cruel than the War it <U+017F>elf; for he ordained they <U+017F>hould depart the Ship with no more but the Cloths they had on, making it Death to him that <U+017F>hould do otherwi<U+017F>e. But it <U+017F>eems there is nothing more precious to a Man than Life, which was the cau<U+017F>e the<U+017F>e <hi>Phoenician</hi> Merchants having now lo<U+017F>t the hope of all the Riches in the Ship, as if they had lo<U+017F>t nothing, but rather gain'd, and made an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Voyage, did <U+017F>trive who <U+017F>hould fir<U+017F>t get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>But as we al<U+017F>o (obeying the decree) were about to pa<U+017F>s into the Boat, <hi>Trachinus</hi> took <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea</hi> by the Hand, and <U+017F>aid, Fair one, this War concerns not you, but Was undertaken for your <U+017F>ake, and <U+017F>ince the Day you left the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory</hi> of <hi>Zacynthus,</hi> I have <U+017F>till followed you, adventuring thus far upon the Sea, and facing danger for your Love; therefore let not any fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehen<U+017F>ion <U+017F>eize you, but confirm your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and know with the Empire you already are po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ed of in my Soul, you <U+017F>hall be the Lady of all the Wealth you <U+017F>ee, thus he <U+017F>aid; but <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> full of di<U+017F>cretion, and knowing by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructions I had given her how to apply her <U+017F>elf to the time mo<U+017F>t excellently well, pre<U+017F>ently cleared her look from all the marks of Sorrow that now incompa<U+017F><U+017F>ed her, and Painting upon her Face an appearance of joy, made this reply; I render thanks to the Gods that have put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your mind to u<U+017F>e us favourably, but if you will have me be confident, plea<U+017F>e to make me this fir<U+017F>t demon<U+017F>tration of your Love, <U+017F>ave this my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my Father, and command them not from the Ship; for if I be once <U+017F>eparated from them the World hath nothing can per<U+017F>wade to retain Life.

               <p>Now while the<U+017F>e things were <U+017F>aid and done, the Sun being in his Circuit come full We<U+017F>t, that <U+017F>pace which is betwixt the Day and Night grew very Dark and Foul, and on a <U+017F>uddain the Sea began to be troubled; it may be the Sea<U+017F>on cau<U+017F>ed the pre<U+017F>ent change, or perhaps it was by the Plea<U+017F>ure of <U+017F>ome De<U+017F>tiny afar off, the murmur of the de<U+017F>cending Wind; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently a violent and horrid Tempe<U+017F>t breaking in upon us, the Hearts of the Pirates were fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in their fear, who having for<U+017F>aken their own Galley and put them<U+017F>elves into the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ship to Pillage her, were there <U+017F>urpized with a Tempe<U+017F>t, not knowing how to govern <U+017F>o great a Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, every one doing <U+017F>ome Office of a Mariner in that which came next to his Hands, without any knowledge at all: <U+017F>ome vainly upon their own genious undertaking one Art of Navigation; others another; <U+017F>ome confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>edly <U+017F>truck the Sails; <U+017F>ome unskilfully di<U+017F>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the Cordages; One A<U+017F>s took upon him

               <p>But that which principally ca<U+017F>t us into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame<U+017F>t danger, was not the violence of the Tempe<U+017F>t (for the Waves were not yet at the height of their fury) but it was the ignorance of him that took upon him to be Pylot, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>ted the Storm <U+017F>o long as there was any Day light, but when it grew black Night, gave over his Charge; and when they were now ready to <U+017F>ink, at fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome of the Pyrates did endeavour to have recovered their own Galley, but were beat off from their de<U+017F>ign by the Tempe<U+017F>t: <hi>Trachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> al<U+017F>o <U+017F>taying them and making a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trance, that if they could <U+017F>ave the Ship and Riches in her, they <U+017F>hould have Wealth enough to purcha<U+017F>e a Thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>uch Galleys; and <U+017F>peaking tho<U+017F>e words, he cut the Cables that held them together, telling them that whil<U+017F>t they kept their own Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el they drew another Tempe<U+017F>t after them, and that in doing <U+017F>o he provided for their <U+017F>ecurity, <U+017F>ince where<U+017F>oever they <U+017F>hould arrive it would draw <U+017F>u<U+017F>pition upon them, and inquiry would be made after the Per<U+017F>ons that Sailed in the Empty bottom.</p>
               <p>This he <U+017F>aid appeared to them to be rea<U+017F>on, and they approved his Council, out of two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pects, being already <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the one; for they were no <U+017F>ooner <U+017F>evered from the <hi>Brigantine,</hi> but they felt the Sea did not to<U+017F>s them <U+017F>o much as before, yet were they not quite out of the

               <p>As they Landed they carryed from the Ship great Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els of <hi>Tyrian</hi> Wine, and divers other things, <U+017F>aying they would Sacrifice to <hi>Neptune,</hi> and render Thanks for their deliverance; <U+017F>ome were al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ent to the Neighbour Towns, and a great deal of Money given them to buy Bea<U+017F>ts, with command they <U+017F>hould give what Price <U+017F>oever was demanded; and it was not long before we <U+017F>aw them return, driving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them a Flock of Sheep and a Herd of Swine; and having brought them in, they kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Pile, and prepared us a Fea<U+017F>t of the Roafted Victims. Then <hi>Trachinus</hi> taking me

               <p>I approved his words, and feigned my <U+017F>elf to be overjoyed, rendring great thanks to the Gods that had done me the Divine favour to make my Daughters Ma<U+017F>ter willing to take her for his Wife; then retiring my <U+017F>elf a little to <U+017F>tudy what was to be done, I in<U+017F>tantly returned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eeching him what was thus happily begun might be accompli<U+017F>hed a little more honourably, appointing the Ship to the Maid for her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Chamber, and forbidding his Men to enter or any way to di<U+017F>turb her, that <U+017F>o <U+017F>he might have lei<U+017F>ure to apparel her <U+017F>elf like a Bride, with as much Ornament and care as the time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56010:111"/>for it would be <U+017F>aid, It is a poor and mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming thing, that a Maid de<U+017F>cended of a Rich and Noble Family, and which is more that mu<U+017F>t be the Wife of <hi>Trachinus,</hi> <U+017F>hould not at lea<U+017F>t, upon the Day of the Solemization of her Nuptials, be dre<U+017F>t in the Riche<U+017F>t Robes and Jewels <U+017F>he then had, <U+017F>ince Fortune and the place had deprived us of a more glorious Habit.</p>
               <p>At the<U+017F>e words <hi>Trachinus</hi> was tran<U+017F>ported with joy, and promi<U+017F>ed he would do it willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and immediately commanded that all things whereof they had need, being exported out of the Ship, no per<U+017F>on <U+017F>hould dare to approach it any more: They obeying the charge he gave them carryed to Land Tables, Cups, Tape<U+017F>tries, Carpets, Works of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> and many other Moveables and Uten<U+017F>ils, that might be <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable at a Fea<U+017F>t.

               <p>But I taking <hi>Theagenes</hi> with me, when we came to <hi>Chariclea</hi> we found her Weeping; O Daughter, Mi<U+017F>ery is now your acquaintance, not a Stranger to you, and will you yet take on, or is it not for the<U+017F>e old di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters that you weep but for <U+017F>ome new?

               <p>There he beheld <hi>Chariclea</hi> wearing upon her Herd a Crown of Lawrel, Apparelled in a refulgent Robe of Cloth of Gold (for <U+017F>he had put on the Sacred Habit that <U+017F>he brought from <hi>Delphos,</hi> that it might either <U+017F>erve to adorn her Victory or Funeral,) and <U+017F>eeing the Cabbin where <U+017F>he was, accommodated to the form of a Nuptial Chamber, the <U+017F>ight (as it was likely) <U+017F>et him all on fire, Love and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>y augmenting his amorous torment <U+017F>o, that when he returned to us, one might read in his Eyes the rage imprinted in his Soul, and it was evident his thoughts laboured with <U+017F>ome
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56010:113"/>furious de<U+017F>ign, and he was <U+017F>carcely <U+017F>et down again at the Table, but Choler <U+017F>parking in his Eyes, he <U+017F>aid, Why have not I the reward of my merit for being the fir<U+017F>t that boarded the Ship? becau<U+017F>e (<U+017F>aid <hi>Trachnus</hi>) you have not demanded it, and that yet we have not divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <U+017F>poils.

What (<U+017F>aid <hi>Pelorus</hi>) will you break the Law of Piracy, that gives his choice of the prey to him that fir<U+017F>t boards a Ship, and for all his Fellows runs the hazard of his Life? Friend (<U+017F>aid <hi>Trachinus</hi>) I violate not that Law, but I ground my <U+017F>elf upon the Authority of one more powerful, that commands us to obey the wills of our Captains without contradiction, the Maid has wounded me to the Heart with her bright Eyes, and to heal my wound I am forced to marry her; and, Sir, I hope it is a rea<U+017F>on I <U+017F>hould be preferred before you, and if you will not obey this Law, I will make you pre<U+017F>ently repent it with a blow of this Cup I hold in my Hand: Then <hi>Pelorus</hi> looking upon his Companions, You <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid he, what recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence our Labours are to expect; thus you <U+017F>hall one day <U+017F>ee your merits fru<U+017F>trated of the reward of your virtue, and be, as I am, Slaves to this tyrannical Law.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Nau<U+017F>icles,</hi> what do you imagine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56010:113"/>of the<U+017F>e Pirates? after <hi>Nau<U+017F>icles</hi> had <U+017F>poke the<U+017F>e words you would have compared them to a calm <U+017F>ea <U+017F>well'd with the <U+017F>udden Tempe<U+017F>t, <U+017F>uch a Blind and Bruti<U+017F>h motion in an in<U+017F>tant put them into <U+017F>o wild a tumult, inflamed with Wrath and Wine, as if <U+017F>ome fury had po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t them; <U+017F>ome rank'd them<U+017F>elves upon the part of <hi>Trachinus,</hi> and cryed the Captain ought to be obeyed; others <U+017F>ided with <hi>Pelorus,</hi> <U+017F>aying, the Law of Piracy ought to <U+017F>tand. In the end <hi>Trachinus</hi> lifted his Hand to <U+017F>trike <hi>Pelorus</hi> with the Cup he held; but <hi>Pelorus</hi> that was prepared before, broke the effect of his fury and <U+017F>truck a Ponyard to his Heart, <U+017F>o as he fell down mortally wounded, but a cruel War kindled and continued among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, inter-murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another without giving any quarter; <U+017F>ome as revenging the Death of their Captain; others as defending <hi>Pelorus</hi> in his ju<U+017F>t quarrel. The crys of Men, and <U+017F>ounds of Levers, Stones, Cups, Tables, the Wounders and the Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed made one fearful groan; but I retiring a great way off, <U+017F>tood upon the ri<U+017F>e of a Hill, and thence beheld this furious <U+017F>pectacle; yet neither <hi>Theagenes</hi> nor <hi>Chariclea</hi> were exempted from the danger, but following what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, he with his Sword in his Hand joyn'd him<U+017F>elf to one of the Factions at the beginning, and fought as if <U+017F>ome fury had tran<U+017F>ported him, and <U+017F>he after <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw the Fight begun <U+017F>hot from the Ship, loo<U+017F>ing her Arrows with a con<U+017F>tant

Neither did <U+017F>he only gall the one <U+017F>ide of the Battel, but both indifferently, none of the Pirates <U+017F>eeing her, yet <U+017F>he clearly beholding them by the light of the great Fire of the Pile yet burning, <U+017F>o as they could not imagine whence their Death came; but thought it to be <U+017F>ome Plague from Heaven. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the War con<U+017F>umed them all, and only <hi>Theagenes</hi> remained fighting <U+017F>ingle with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorus,</hi> an able and re<U+017F>olute Man, and one that had been fle<U+017F>h'd and bred up in Murders.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Chariclea</hi>'s Shooting could no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er avail her <hi>Theagenes,</hi> grieving <U+017F>he could not a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t him, but the fear <U+017F>he had to mi<U+017F>s her Aim did hold her Hand; ina<U+017F>much as they fought <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e, the Eye could hardly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h them. In the end <hi>Pelorus</hi> was forced to give ground before him, for when <hi>Chariclea</hi> <U+017F>aw her Arrows could do him no more <U+017F>ervice, <U+017F>he <U+017F>ent her words to his Succour, crying to him; Now my be<U+017F>t Friend <U+017F>hew your Courage. At the hearing of the<U+017F>e words his <U+017F>trength redoubled, to which <hi>Pelorus</hi> was not able to make re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance longer, s if the voice of his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s had infu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed new vigour into him, letting him know the reward of his Victory was yet living. For now re<U+017F>uming the heat of his fir<U+017F>t Spirit, tho broken and weigh'd down with many Wounds, he made a blow at <hi>Pelorus</hi> with his Sword full at
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56010:114"/>his Head, which he hoped to cleave a <U+017F>under, as a<U+017F><U+017F>uredly he had done, if the Pirate had not declined his Neck; yet he e<U+017F>caped not, for the Sword de<U+017F>cending, took away the top of his Shoulder, and falling right upon the Elbow joynt of his Sword-hand, cut it quite off; then <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> fled to <U+017F>ave his Life, <hi>Theagenes</hi> following him.</p>
               <p>What the <U+017F>equel was I cannot tell you, but that I <U+017F>aw not when <hi>Theagenes</hi> returned; for remaining upon the ri<U+017F>e of the Hill, I dared not to <U+017F>tirr in a place full of Enemies by Night, when my Friends could not know me; but <hi>Chariclea</hi> was more bold, and if <U+017F>eems more quick <U+017F>ight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for with the fir<U+017F>t dawning of the light, I perceived <hi>Theagenes</hi> lying <U+017F>tretched out upon the Earth like a Dead Man, and <U+017F>aw her <U+017F>itting and Weeping over him, with evident demon<U+017F>trations that <U+017F>he intended to kill her<U+017F>elf, but that <U+017F>ome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hope of his revival re<U+017F>trained her as yet, and held her Life in equal <U+017F>u<U+017F>pence with his. But I, unfortunate Man, had not <U+017F>o much as time to <U+017F>peak to them to <U+017F>weeten their Calamities with my words, or to apply remedy to his wounds, <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t did the evils at Land (without a breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <U+017F>pace) <U+017F>ucceed to tho<U+017F>e at Sea.</p>
               <p>For, at the fir<U+017F>t Spring of the Morning, as I was de<U+017F>cending from the Hill where I had pitched for that Night, I <U+017F>aw a Troop of <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Theives, running from the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that lyeth along that Coa<U+017F>t, who pre<U+017F>ently
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56010:115"/><U+017F>eized upon my poor Children, taking them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and all the Riches they could carry out of the Ship. I <U+017F>pake afar off to them, and in vain bad them farewel that could not hear me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring their Fortunes and my own; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being able to defend them, or holding it good to go and mix with them, I re<U+017F>erved my <U+017F>elf to hope to <U+017F>uccour them <U+017F>ome other way. And indeed it was not in my power to do them pre<U+017F>ent <U+017F>ervice, being left far behind, my Age like a heavy burden not <U+017F>uffering me to march <U+017F>o quick a pace as tho<U+017F>e <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> that mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and de<U+017F>cended by <U+017F>trange Paths, and through Wild places. Now by the Mercy of the Gods, and your favour, worthy <hi>Nau<U+017F>icles,</hi> I have found my Daughter then lo<U+017F>t, having contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing to her recovery but my abundant Sighs, Tears, and Lamentations.</p>
               <p>Speaking the<U+017F>e words he wept, all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were forced to do the like, changing their Fea<U+017F>t into a Sorrow, intermixed with joy, (for Wine intenerates the Eyes and makes them apt to Tears) and they were not able to contain their flux of pity, till <hi>Nau<U+017F>icles</hi> <U+017F>pake thus to confort <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris.</hi> Father (<U+017F>aid he) cha<U+017F>e away the<U+017F>e <U+017F>ad conceptions and fill your Heart with Joy, <U+017F>ince you have now recovered your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that only one Night remains to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e it <U+017F>elf betwixt you, and the contentment you <U+017F>hall receive in beholding your Son, for to Morrow Morning we will Ride to <hi>Mitranes,</hi>

But <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris</hi> looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout for <hi>Chariclea</hi> and not finding her in the multitude, was greatly perplexed, till at length a certain Woman advertized him, that <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her enter the Sanctuary of the Temple.

Then after he had <U+017F>hed <U+017F>ome Tears, and humbly conjured the Gods to change the rigour of her de<U+017F>tiny into better Fortune, he <U+017F>oftly awaked <hi>Chariclea</hi> and returned to his Lodgings with her. Being now in the Hou<U+017F>e <U+017F>he retired to the Chamber of <hi>Nau<U+017F>icles</hi>'s Daughter, lying with her, but not taking any re<U+017F>t, care not permitting her to clo<U+017F>e her Eyes.</p>

In the fir<U+017F>t place <U+017F>he digg'd a pit in the Earth, then made a fire on each <U+017F>ide thereof; placing the body of her Son between the two plains; then taking a Pitcher from off a three-legg'd Stool that <U+017F>tood by, <U+017F>he pour'd Honey into the Pit, Milk out of a <U+017F>econd, and <U+017F>o out of a third, as if <U+017F>he had been doing Sacrifice: Then taking a piece of Dough, form'd in the likene<U+017F>s of a Man, crown'd with Lawrel and Bdellium, <U+017F>he ca<U+017F>t it into the Pit. After this,

Then bowing her<U+017F>elf to the Body of her Sons, whi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering in his Ear, <U+017F>he awaked him, and by the force of her charms, made him to <U+017F>tand upright. <hi>Charilea,</hi> who had hitherto look'd on with <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient fear, was now a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>ht; wherefore <U+017F>he wak'd <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris</hi> to be likewi<U+017F>e Spectator of what was done.

The que<U+017F>tion which <U+017F>he ask'd of him was, If her Son, who was yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <U+017F>hould return <U+017F>afe home? To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer'd nothing, only nodding his head, gave her doubtful conjecture of his <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fell flat upon his Face. She turn'd the Body with the Face upward, and again repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her que<U+017F>tion, but with much greater violence, uttering many Incantations, and leaping up and down with the Sword in her hand, turning <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Fire, and then to the Pit; <U+017F>he once more awaken'd him, and <U+017F>etting him upright, urg'd him to an<U+017F>wer her in plain word, &amp; not in doubtful <U+017F>igns.

While he was thus <U+017F>peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the dead per<U+017F>on made an<U+017F>wer, with a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and dreadful tone: At fir<U+017F>t I <U+017F>pared you, Mother, (<U+017F>aid he) and <U+017F>uffer'd your tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing again<U+017F>t humane Nature and the Laws of De<U+017F>tiny; and by Charms and Witchcraft di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turbing tho<U+017F>e things which <U+017F>hould re<U+017F>t invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: For even the Dead retain a Reverence towards their Parents, as much as is po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for them; but <U+017F>ince you exceed all bounds, being not content with the wicked action you began, nor <U+017F>atisfy'd with rai<U+017F>ing me up to give you <U+017F>igns, but al<U+017F>o force me, a dead Body, to <U+017F>peak; neglecting my Seputure, and keepin me from the man<U+017F>ion of departed Souls; hear tho<U+017F>e things which at fir<U+017F>t I was afraid to acquaint you withal: Neither you Son <U+017F>hall return alive, nor <U+017F>hall your <U+017F>elf e<U+017F>cape that Death, by the Sword, which is due to your crimes; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that life in <U+017F>ort time, which you have <U+017F>pent in wicked practices: Fora<U+017F>much as you have not only done the<U+017F>e things alone, but made

But that which is more grievous, is, that a Virgin has been Spectator of all that has been done, and heard what was <U+017F>aid: A Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and Lover, that has wander'd through Countrys, in <U+017F>earch of her Betroth'd; with whom, after infinite Labours and Dangers, <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall arrive at the outmo<U+017F>t parts of the Earth, and live in Royal State.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56010:130"/>and late Service. The Town<U+017F>inen, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were terrify'd with expectation of great numbers, when they found their Enemies were few, drew up the Archers and Hor<U+017F>e that were left to defend the Town, with the re<U+017F>t of the Citizens, arm'd as the <U+017F>udden chance could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>h them, prepar'd forthwith to fet upon the Enemy. A Per<U+017F>on of Age and Eminency di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uaded them fromtheir attemyt, <U+017F>aying, That though <hi>Oroondates,</hi> the Deputy, were ab<U+017F>ent, yet it was meet fir<U+017F>t to con<U+017F>ult with <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> his Wife; by which means the Souldiers who were left, would more willingly engage. They approved his Council, and accordingly went to the Palace, where Deputies re<U+017F>ide in the Kings ab<U+017F>ence. <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> be<U+017F>ide the Charms of her per<U+017F>on and <U+017F>tature, had great managemment in affairs; <U+017F>uch as became her Royal Blood, and the Si<U+017F>ter of a King: Yet for Luxury and di<U+017F><U+017F>olute Life, de<U+017F>erv'd no little blame. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t other things, <U+017F>he was partly the cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Thyamis</hi>'s Bani<U+017F>hment from <hi>Memphis</hi> For when <hi>Cala<U+017F>tris,</hi> for tho<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>chiefs which were fore-told about his Sons, was withdrawn from the City, <U+017F>o long, that he was <U+017F>uppos'd to be dead, <hi>Thyamis,</hi> as his elde<U+017F>t Son, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inve<U+017F>ted in his place of High Prie<U+017F>t: <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> immediately fixt her Eyes on him in the Temple, where, be<U+017F>ide his youth and comely per<U+017F>onage, he appear'd more charming with the <U+017F>plendid habit of his Office. She forbore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56010:130"/>not from immode<U+017F>t glances and <U+017F>igns, which <hi>Thyamis</hi> took little notice of, being of a cha<U+017F>te temper. But his Brother <hi>Peti<U+017F>oris,</hi> who had already envy'd his Dignity, and ob<U+017F>erv'd the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> took occa<U+017F>ion from thence to form a <U+017F>nare for his Brother. Therefore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing him<U+017F>elf to <hi>Oroondates,</hi> did not only tell him the Inclination of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> but fal<U+017F>ly added, That <hi>Thyamis</hi> was contracted to her. He ea<U+017F>ily believ'd, being already jealous of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> but as yet have her no di<U+017F>turbance, having no clear proof of his <U+017F>urmize; as al<U+017F>o out of re<U+017F>pect to the Blood Royal, his <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion was to be <U+017F>uppre<U+017F>t and conceal'd: Yet he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore not to threaten <hi>Thyamis</hi> with Death, till he was expell'd the City, and <hi>Peti<U+017F>oris</hi> made Prie<U+017F>t in his <U+017F>tead. The<U+017F>e things were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tran<U+017F>acted. When now the people were throng'd about the Palace, and told her the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Enemy, which <U+017F>he already knew, and de<U+017F>ired her Commands on the Souldiers; <U+017F>he an<U+017F>wered, That whereas they knew not as yet the numbers of the Enemy, nor who they were, nor for what cau<U+017F>e they arrived, That it were expedient fir<U+017F>t to go up to the Wall to take a view of the Enemy, and re<U+017F>olve as they <U+017F>aw oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion. They approv'd her coun<U+017F>el, and went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the Battlements. There, when a Rich Pavillion was placed for <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> and <U+017F>he he <U+017F>elf richly adorn'd, was <U+017F>eated thereon, with her Guards in Golden Armour about her;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56010:131"/>holding out her Mace, for an Emblem of Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Treaty, <U+017F>he commanded the chiefs of the Enemy to approach the Walls. <hi>Thyamis</hi> and <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who were elected by the Army to go forth, plac'd them<U+017F>elves under the Walls, cover'd in Armour all but their Heads. The Herald utter'd the<U+017F>e words: <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> Wife of <hi>Oroondates,</hi> the Governour; and Si<U+017F>ter to the King; demands of you, who you are? With what intention, or for what cau<U+017F>e you are come hither with your Army? They rely'd, That their Troops were <hi>Be<U+017F><U+017F>ians.</hi> Of him<U+017F>elf, <hi>Thyamis</hi> gave thhis account; That he had <U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tain'd injury from his Brother, as al<U+017F>o from <hi>Oroondates;</hi> That he was by Treachery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the Prie<U+017F>thood, and that the <hi>Be<U+017F><U+017F>ians</hi> were come to re<U+017F>tore him: That if he were re-<U+017F>etled in his right, the <hi>Be<U+017F><U+017F>ians</hi> <U+017F>hould return peaceably, without doing them any damage; otherwife his Cau<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould be decided by the Sword.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> for her own <U+017F>ake <U+017F>hould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and take this opportunity of revenging her<U+017F>elf on <hi>Peti<U+017F>oris,</hi> who had practis'd again<U+017F>t, and fal<U+017F>ly accus'd her to <hi>Oroondates;</hi> and on the <U+017F>ame pretence compa<U+017F>s'd his Bani<U+017F>hment from that City. The <hi>Memphians</hi> were much concern'd when they knew <hi>Thyamis,</hi> and were hitherto ignorant in the cau<U+017F>e of his Bani<U+017F>hment, and believ'd what he affirm'd. <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> above all, was <U+017F>eiz'd with a Tempe<U+017F>t of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56010:131"/>Thoughts. Her Rage being renew'd with this Remembrance of her former injuries from <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oris,</hi> <U+017F>he con<U+017F>ider'd which way to revenge her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf upon him. One while <U+017F>urveying <hi>Thyamis,</hi> and then <hi>Theagenes,</hi> <U+017F>he was divided in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ire, and <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ively had a pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for each: For the one a former flame, and for the other a more violent, though kindled that moment; in<U+017F>omuch that her concern was perceiv'd by her Sarvants. But when <U+017F>he came to her <U+017F>elf, like one from a <U+017F>woon; Excellent per<U+017F>ons (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) what madne<U+017F>s has po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t you, who have not only expos'd all the <hi>Be<U+017F><U+017F>ians,</hi> but your own beautiful <U+017F>elves, in behalf of Robbers; for you are not able, if we <U+017F>hould engage, to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain our fir<U+017F>t On<U+017F>et. The Kings affairs are not yet reduc'd to that di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, though the Deputy be ab<U+017F>ent, but that you mu<U+017F>t needs be encompa<U+017F>s'd by the remainder of his Souldiers in the City. But I <U+017F>ee no rea<U+017F>on why the Publick <U+017F>hould be concerned in this difference; <U+017F>ince therefore the quarrel is private, let the deci<U+017F>ion be <U+017F>o too; <U+017F>o that the Gods and Right mu<U+017F>t determine the event. It therefore <U+017F>eems ju<U+017F>t to me, that the <hi>Memphians</hi> and your Forces <U+017F>hould lie <U+017F>till, and not engage in a needle<U+017F>s War. This Judgment of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> was applauded with the <U+017F>houts of her people. They not only <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected <hi>Peri<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> of Inju<U+017F>tice, which they de<U+017F>ired to <U+017F>ee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed; but al<U+017F>o every one rejoyc'd to have his own Danger laid on another per<U+017F>ons head. But
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56010:132"/>the <hi>Be<U+017F><U+017F>ian</hi> Army were not <U+017F>o well contented with the propo<U+017F>al, nor were willing to expo<U+017F>e their General to danger, till <hi>Thyamis</hi> with tears obtain'd their con<U+017F>ent; alledging that <hi>Peti<U+017F>oris</hi> was weaker, and not experienc'd in Arms, <U+017F>o that he having been ver<U+017F>ed therein, <U+017F>hould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him on advantage. Nor is it unlikely that <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> propos'd the <U+017F>ingle Combat, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion, what <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired; it being mo<U+017F>t probable that <hi>Thyamis</hi> would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. This re<U+017F>olve was no <U+017F>ooner mention'd that put in Action. <hi>Thyamis</hi> chearfully fitting on the re<U+017F>t of his Armour which was wanting; <hi>Theagenes</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting, and bracing his Helmet on, adorn'd with a mo<U+017F>t graceful Cre<U+017F>t and Plume. <hi>Peti<U+017F>oris</hi> in the mean time was thru<U+017F>t out of the Town, much entreating them that he might decline the Fight. As <U+017F>oon as <hi>Thyamis</hi> beheld him, Do you not <U+017F>ee, <U+017F>aid he to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> how the guilty <hi>Peti<U+017F>oris</hi> trembles? I perceive it, replyed he: But how have you re<U+017F>olv'd in this Encounter? The Enemy with whom you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage is your Brother. You <U+017F>ay true, reply'd he; I therefore determine, by the Gods will, to conquer, but not kill him: Providence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that former rage <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o far revine in me, as to make me, for wrongs that are pa<U+017F>t, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue my hands in a Brothers Blood. You <U+017F>peak like a Man of Honour, reply'd <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and vers'd in the Laws of Nature. But what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands have you for me? There is little danger
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56010:132"/>in this Encounter (reply'd <hi>Thyamis;</hi>) yet <U+017F>ince all Events are in the hands of Fortune, if I Conquer, you <U+017F>hall enter this City, and live with me in full command of my fortunes; but if otherwi<U+017F>e it <U+017F>hall happen, you <U+017F>hall be chief over the<U+017F>e <hi>Be<U+017F><U+017F>ians,</hi> that highly e<U+017F>teem you, till Providence <U+017F>hall better compo<U+017F>e your Affairs. This being agreed on, they embrac'd each other with mutual Tears and Ki<U+017F><U+017F>es. <hi>Theagenes</hi> fat down in the habit in which he was, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve the Combate; thereby (though unwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) affording a full view of him<U+017F>elf to <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> who fea<U+017F>ted her wanton Eyes on his amiable Per<U+017F>on. <hi>Thyamis</hi> made up to <hi>Peti<U+017F>oris,</hi> who would not abide the fir<U+017F>t on<U+017F>et, but whil<U+017F>t he approacht, made toward the Gate, to <U+017F>helter him<U+017F>elf in the City: But to no purpo<U+017F>e, being again forced out by the Citizens; the per<U+017F>ons likewi<U+017F>e upon the Walls giving charge that none <U+017F>hould receive him. He therefore ran round the Walls, and at lengthh with part of his Arms thrown away. <hi>Theagenes</hi> follow'd to <U+017F>ee the event, but without Weapons, to give no <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting <hi>Thyamis;</hi> having ca<U+017F>t down his Spear and Buckler in the place where he <U+017F>at in <U+017F>ight of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace.</hi> Thus <hi>Peti<U+017F>oris</hi> twice <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the City; but making the third round, <hi>Thyamis</hi> poi<U+017F>ing his Spear, and calling to him to <U+017F>tand, unle<U+017F>s he would receive a <U+017F>candalous wound in his Back: The whole City <U+017F>itting <U+017F>pectators, as it were in a Theatre. The Deity,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56010:133"/>or Fortune, that governs humane affairs, as in <U+017F>ome labour'd Tragedy, where new events ari<U+017F>e, had not only plac'd <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris</hi> a Spectator at the Duel of his Sons, but al<U+017F>o made him one in cha<U+017F>e. Who although he had <U+017F>uffered <U+017F>o many di<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, and bani<U+017F>h'd him<U+017F>elf into remote Countrys to avoid <U+017F>o cruel a <U+017F>pectacle, yet, by the power of fate, is compell'd to <U+017F>ee what the Gods foretold to him by their Oracles, He therefore, from a great di<U+017F>tance, beholding the cour<U+017F>e, perceived by what had been revealed to him, that the two Combatants were his Sons. Wherefore, with greater <U+017F>peed than old Age would well permit, he ha<U+017F>tned towards them, to prevent, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, their actual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Approaching <U+017F>o near as to bear up with them; What madne<U+017F>s is this, O my Children, he often cryed out? But they not yet knowing their Fathers countenance, he being di<U+017F>guis'd in Beggars habit; their whole mind being taken up with the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in hand, neglected him, as one of the Spectators, or <U+017F>ome per<U+017F>on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tracted. But tho<U+017F>e who were on the Walls ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd that he took no care of him<U+017F>elf, but came between the Combatauts, while others laught at him, as a frantick man. When therefore the old man was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that he was unknown through the meanne<U+017F>s of his Garb, he threw off his outward poor Di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>e; di<U+017F>covering his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hair, not yet unwreath'd; the Burden which he carry'd on his back, with the Bow,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56010:133"/>being ca<U+017F>t away, he renew'd his Prayers, and with Tears uttered the<U+017F>e words; O Sons, (<U+017F>aid he) behold <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> behold your Father, and de<U+017F>i<U+017F>t from this fury, which, with ill fate, you have begun; and pay ju<U+017F>t reverence to the pre<U+017F>ence of your aged Father.</p>
               <p>At this they relented, and not only fell, but threw them<U+017F>elves headlong at his Feet, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Knees, they look'd up to his Face, to a<U+017F><U+017F>ure them<U+017F>elves if it were he, and that they were not deceived by <U+017F>ome Spectre. As <U+017F>oon as they were confirm'd, they were <U+017F>eiz'd with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and contrary affections. They were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd to <U+017F>ee their Father alive, beyond their hopes or expectation, and were no le<U+017F>s troubled for the manner in which he apprehended them; and, above all, were <U+017F>ollicitous of the event in this accident. While the per<U+017F>ons from the Walls were beholding this Scene, and almo<U+017F>t a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>ht, through Ignorance of the matter, <U+017F>o that they <U+017F>tood mute and motionle<U+017F>s as Statues, behold another turn in the Scene aro<U+017F>e: <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> following the <U+017F>teps of <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> while from afar off <U+017F>he knew <hi>Theagenes</hi> (for Lovers have <U+017F>harp <U+017F>ight) tran<U+017F>ported with the view, with a clo<U+017F>e Embrace, hanging on his Neck, had no breath left to <U+017F>peak to him. But he, as it is likely, by her poor Dre<U+017F>s and Face, di<U+017F>dained her, thinking her <U+017F>ome Vagabond among the Crowd of Spectators, put her from him; and at la<U+017F>t, when <U+017F>he not de<U+017F>it, and vex'd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56010:134"/>to be hinder'd from the Scene of <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> pu<U+017F>h'd her away: She, with a low voice, cry'd, O <hi>Pythius,</hi> have you forgot this Taper? <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> <U+017F>truck with that word, as with a Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt, by the <U+017F>igns agreed on between them, knew the Torch, and tran<U+017F>ported with the <U+017F>ight of <hi>Chariclea,</hi> her Beauty now <U+017F>hining out, as through a Cloud, he threw him<U+017F>elf upon her Neck. The whole Battlements (where <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> <U+017F>at, who <U+017F>urvey'd <hi>Chariclea</hi> not without Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou<U+017F>ie) were <U+017F>urpriz'd at this Scene of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful repre<U+017F>entation. The dire conte<U+017F>t between the Brothers is taken off, and the Battel, which was expected to the of bloody con<U+017F>equence, concludes in a happy agreement. The Father, who had beheld his Sons arm'd again<U+017F>t each other, in<U+017F>omuch that his Eyes were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t made witne<U+017F><U+017F>es of his Childrens unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death, is now Arbiter of Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. he that could avoid not their nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary de<U+017F>tiny, makes now no le<U+017F>s advantage of Fortune. The Children recover their Parent after ten years lo<U+017F>s, and he that was the cau<U+017F>e of their bloody <U+017F>trife for the Prie<U+017F>thood, is now him<U+017F>elf Crown'd by the Rivals, and led along in the Sacred Robes. But the <U+017F>hining parts in the Comedy were <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> mo<U+017F>t beautiful figures; who, beyond all hopes, had now recovered each other; and above all the re<U+017F>t, drew the eyes of the City upon them. The Inhabitants i<U+017F><U+017F>ued through the Gates, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56010:134"/>filled the Plain with their numbers; the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <U+017F>ort repairing to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and the elder thronging to <hi>Thyamis;</hi> the Virgins that were Marriagable, went over to <hi>chariclea:</hi> So that a kind of Religious Proce<U+017F><U+017F>ion was immediately con<U+017F>tituted. <hi>Thyamis</hi> in the mean time di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing the <hi>Be<U+017F><U+017F>ians,</hi> with thanks for the kindne<U+017F>s that they <U+017F>hewed him; he likewi<U+017F>e divided Pre<U+017F>ents among<U+017F>t them, an hundred Oxen and a thou<U+017F>and Sheep, with promi<U+017F>e of ten Drachms apiece, in little time to be <U+017F>ent after them.</p>
               <p>He then put his Neck under his aged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Arms to <U+017F>upport him, langui<U+017F>hing with years, and at pre<U+017F>ent with exce<U+017F>s of Joy. <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oris</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide did the <U+017F>ame. Thus was the old Man carry'd to the Temple of <hi>I<U+017F>is,</hi> <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Applau<U+017F>e and Congratulations; Pipes and Sacred Flutes re<U+017F>ounding all the way, that <U+017F>et the younger <U+017F>ort a Dancing. <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o performed her part, following the Pomp with her Train, and putting much Gold into the Temple of <hi>I<U+017F>is,</hi> for an Example to the re<U+017F>t of the City. In the mean time, while <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> led <hi>Chariclea</hi> by the hand, officiou<U+017F>ly keeping off the pre<U+017F>s from her, he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tred no <U+017F>mall Jealou<U+017F>ie to <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace. Cala<U+017F>iris</hi> went into the inward part of the Temple, where falling pro<U+017F>trate before the Images, he almo<U+017F>t expir'd in the adoration. But being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the <U+017F>tanders by, as <U+017F>oon as he could <U+017F>tand upright, and had paid his Reverence to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56010:135"/>the Godde<U+017F>s, he took the Wreath from his Brow and plac'd it on the Head of <hi>Thymis;</hi> telling the Multitude, That he was old, that the En<U+017F>igns of Prie<U+017F>thood were due to his elde<U+017F>t Son, who al<U+017F>o was qualify'd to <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain that Office. When the people had with <U+017F>houts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proy'd his plea<U+017F>ure, he, with his two Sons and <hi>Theagenes,</hi> repair'd to that part of the Temple which is a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd to the Prie<U+017F>thood: The re<U+017F>t departed every one to his hou<U+017F>e. <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e went away, but not without delays, and turning back again, as it were, to perform ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Godde<U+017F>s. All the while ca<U+017F>ting her Eyes towards <hi>Theagenes,</hi> as long as <U+017F>he could have <U+017F>ight of him. After <U+017F>he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Palace, <U+017F>he betook her to her Apartment, where <U+017F>he threw her<U+017F>elf upon her Bed, without uttering one word. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man la<U+017F>civious in her temper, but now with the <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>ing beauty of <hi>Theagenes,</hi> inflam'd to a degree beyond what <U+017F>he had yet been <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of. She therefore continued waking all night, turning from one <U+017F>ide to the other, <U+017F>ighing deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <U+017F>ometimes ri<U+017F>ing up, and then throwing her <U+017F>elf down upon her Bed again. She often ha<U+017F>tily call'd her Attendants to her, then <U+017F>ent them away again without any Commands for them. In fine, this pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion had di<U+017F>tracted her, but for an old Woman, <hi>Cybele</hi> by name, the keeper of her Cabinet, and former Servant of her Love-intrigues. She gue<U+017F>s'd the affair, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56010:135"/>came into the Chamber, as it were a Torch, adding fire to her flame. Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, what frenzy is this? What new pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ports you? What Per<U+017F>ons A<U+017F>pect has di<U+017F>turb'd my Charge? Who is <U+017F>o vain and hardy, as not to be taken with that Beauty, and not account <U+017F>uch an enjoyment the greate<U+017F>t happine<U+017F>s? tell me, my dear Daughter; for there is none <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinate, as not to be vanqui<U+017F>h'd by my Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems. You have already had good proof thereof. The<U+017F>e words, and many more to this purpo<U+017F>e uttered <U+017F>he, embracing the Feet of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ace,</hi> and reply'd <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> after a little pau<U+017F>e. I have now receiv'd a deeper wound than ever; I have often found your skill <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful in the<U+017F>e affairs, but know not now what it can do. The War which was this day almo<U+017F>t begun before our Wall, prov'd unbloody to others, but to me the beginning of a more fatal War, wherein I am wounded to the very Soul; in unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>hewing me the youth that accompany'd <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amis</hi> during the Combat. You know, Mother, whom I <U+017F>peak of; for with the <U+017F>plendour of his Beauty he <U+017F>oon clouded all the re<U+017F>t, di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering no mean Birth, nor Aver<U+017F>ion to Love. This your Judgment cannot be ignorant of: Wherefore, <U+017F>ince you know my grief, 'tis high time to <U+017F>et all your Engines to work; to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all your Art and Indu<U+017F>try if you would have your Daughter to <U+017F>urvive. For of what
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56010:136"/>u<U+017F>e is Life, without enjoyment of the per<U+017F>on whom I affect. I know the youth (reply'd the old Woman;) He that is full Brea<U+017F>ted, his Neck erect, his Eyes <U+017F>parkling, and at once di<U+017F>play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love and Severity; with fair and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd Hair, his Cheeks ju<U+017F>t budding with youthful down; to whom a certain Dam<U+017F>el, not di<U+017F>agreeable, but exce<U+017F><U+017F>ive impudent, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, and ca<U+017F>t her Arms about him: Is not this your Man, Lady? The very <U+017F>ame, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And you have well brought into my mind that dome<U+017F>tick Creature, who yet is far hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than I, in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>uch a Lover. At this the Old Woman <U+017F>miling, reply'd, Be of good heart, and lay a<U+017F>ide care, Madam; It is but for a day that <U+017F>he is held beautiful by the <U+017F>tranger; but when I bring it about that he <U+017F>hall enjoy your Beauty, that <U+017F>ordid Harlot <U+017F>hall be de<U+017F>pis'd. Do <U+017F>o, my dear <hi>Cybele,</hi> and you will at once ea<U+017F>e me of a double grief, Love and Jealou<U+017F>ie. Leave that to my care (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) in the mean time it is your part to compo<U+017F>e your <U+017F>elf with good hopes, and not to de<U+017F>pair of my work before I begin. Having thus <U+017F>aid, <U+017F>he went away, taking the light with her, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fa<U+017F>t the Door. <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> no <U+017F>ooner perceiv'd day-light, but <U+017F>he call'd one of her Eunuchs, together with her Woman, to whom <U+017F>he gave little Cakes, and <U+017F>ent them to do Sacrifice at the Temple. When they came to the Gates, and told the Door-keeper their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, That
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56010:136"/>they were come to do Sacrifice for <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> who had that night been troubled in Dreams; the Officer forbad their entrance, acquainting them, That the Temple was at pre<U+017F>ent full of Sorrow: That the High Prie<U+017F>t <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> the la<U+017F>t evening, enlarging his Soul in chearfulne<U+017F>s, and after the Banquet made long <U+017F>upplications to the Godde<U+017F>s: Then telling his Sons, That hitherto they had <U+017F>een their Father; and giving them <U+017F>trict Charge concerning the two <hi>Grecian</hi> <U+017F>trangers, he betook him<U+017F>elf to his Bed. After this, whether his pores were too much dilated through exce<U+017F>s of joy, or worn out with Age, or by the fix'd decree of the Gods, about Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow he expired, in pre<U+017F>ence of his Sons, who watched him. We have now <U+017F>ent Me<U+017F><U+017F>engers to a<U+017F><U+017F>emble the Prie<U+017F>thood of the City, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form tho<U+017F>e Funeral Rites, which, according to our Cu<U+017F>tom, are due to him. You mu<U+017F>t there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore depart; for it is not lawful for any Per<U+017F>on to enter the Temple, or do Sacrifice for the<U+017F>e <U+017F>even days but only the Prie<U+017F>ts. What then mu<U+017F>t become of the two <U+017F>trangers, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cybele,</hi> during this time?</p>
               <p>Our new Prelate <hi>Thyamis,</hi> (<U+017F>aid the Officer) has commanded a Lodging to be prepar'd for them without the Temple; and behold where they are now in obedience, going forth out of the Temple. <hi>Cybele</hi> having got this lucky op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, thus again be<U+017F>peaks the Officer; O Friend, belov'd of the Gods, it is in your power

You know how <U+017F>he favours <hi>Grecians,</hi> and u<U+017F>es ho<U+017F>pitality to <U+017F>trangers; Tell them therefore, that by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Thyamis,</hi> an apartment is provided for them in the Palace.

He has given charge in the fir<U+017F>t place concerning you, and order'd you a dwelling, to which per<U+017F>ons of the fir<U+017F>t Rank are pround to be receiv'd, and therefore well may <U+017F>trangers be <U+017F>o, who <U+017F>eem of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fortune.

But the fate that govern'd them, after it had allow'd them one days refre<U+017F>hment, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow'd it with misfortune; making them Pri<U+017F>oners to their Enemy, though under ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Ho<U+017F>pitality.

                  <hi>Theagenes</hi> comparing what was now <U+017F>poken by <hi>Cybele,</hi> with what had happen'd the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the immode<U+017F>t ge<U+017F>tures of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> was about to an<U+017F>wer, when <hi>Chariclea</hi> <U+017F>aid to him in his ear, be <U+017F>ue in your di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e to remember your Si<U+017F>ter.

This is the po<U+017F>ture of our Affairs. But to you
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56010:138"/>we return our ju<U+017F>t Thanks for your Courteous Ho<U+017F>pitality; however, you will yet lay a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obligation upon us, if you cau<U+017F>e us to live re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd and private, not introducing us into the Court, or acquaintance with <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace;</hi> for <U+017F>uch familiarities, you know, are mo<U+017F>t fitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t Equals. <hi>Cybele</hi> could no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but by the chearfulne<U+017F>s of her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, di<U+017F>cover'd her joy to hear they were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; that therefore <hi>Chriclea</hi> would be no Ob<U+017F>tacle to <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi>'s De<U+017F>ires. O lovely Youth (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) you will not <U+017F>peak this of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> when you know her humour; She carries her<U+017F>elf equally to all fortunes, and with particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to dignity in di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s: Being her<U+017F>elf a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ian</hi> by Birth, <U+017F>he naturally admires the People and Manners of <hi>Greece.</hi> Wherefore the People and Manners fo <hi>Greece.</hi> Wherefore take heart, and a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf of all manly Offices about her, while <hi>Chariclea</hi> <U+017F>hall be her Intimate and Companion. But it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary that you tell me your Names. Which when <U+017F>he had heard, <U+017F>he de<U+017F>ired them to wait her return; and <U+017F>o ha<U+017F>tned to <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> leaving Orders with the Door-keeper, That none <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>uffer'd to go in to them, nor the Strangers to go out. Not if your own Son <hi>Achemenes</hi> come (<U+017F>aid the per<U+017F>on?) Not even he, reply'd the other: Lock the door, and <U+017F>ay I have taken the Key with me. Even thus it happen'd; <hi>Cybele</hi> was no <U+017F>ooner depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but left opportunity to <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea</hi> to bewail their misfortunes, which they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56010:139"/>did in almo<U+017F>t the <U+017F>ame words. O <hi>Theagenes,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he; O <hi>Chariclea,</hi> he an<U+017F>wer'd, with an equal <U+017F>igh. What fortune has be<U+017F>et us, <U+017F>aid he! In what po<U+017F>ture are our affairs, an<U+017F>wer'd <U+017F>he! Thus reply'd they to each, ki<U+017F><U+017F>ing and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally embracing after every Sentence: At la<U+017F>t calling to mind <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> they broke out into a joint Complaint: Chiefly <hi>Chariclea,</hi> as having for a longer time been obliged to his Ho<U+017F>pitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: O good <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, how am I in thee depriv'd of a Daughters name. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who begot me I never Knew, the Father that adopted me I for<U+017F>ook; and la<U+017F>tly, this that receiv'd, cheri<U+017F>h'd, and pre<U+017F>erv'd me, is now a dead Corp<U+017F>e, to which I am not permitted <U+017F>o much as to pay Funeral Rites. Yet, my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tainer and Pre<U+017F>erver, nay, I will add Father; where-ever I am confin'd, I will make ju<U+017F>t Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations with my Tears, and pay the<U+017F>e Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: Herewith <U+017F>he pluck'd off her Hair, and threw it on the floor. <hi>Theagenes</hi> entreated her to <U+017F>pare her <U+017F>elf and be pacify'd; yet <U+017F>he went on with her Complaint. To what purpo<U+017F>e <U+017F>hould I now live, what hope is left? My Guide in this <U+017F>trange Land, the Staff of my Pilgrimage, my leader to my Native Soil; he that performed the Office of Parent; my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>er in Di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, the Repeller of my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, the Anchor of my Hopes, <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> is gone. While <U+017F>he utter'd the<U+017F>e Lamentations, <hi>Theagenes</hi> wept apart, adn re<U+017F>train'd as much
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56010:139"/>as he could his grief, in pity to his Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s. By this time <hi>Achemenes</hi> arriv'd, and finding the Door lock'd, ask'd the Door-keeper the rea<U+017F>on: When he knew 'twas by his Mothers Order, he went to the Door, where he heard <hi>Chariclea</hi> lamenting, and look'd through the chinks into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Again he enquires of the Door-keeper; who <U+017F>aid, She <U+017F>uppos'd they were two <U+017F>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers brought in thither by his Mother. He then <U+017F>toop'd down again, to try if he could know them. <hi>Chariclea</hi> he knew not, yet was taken with her Beauty; which he thought how great it was when not di<U+017F>guis'd with Grief. From Admiration he falls into Love. As for <hi>Theagenes,</hi> he could but gue<U+017F>s at him. While he was thus intent, <hi>Cybele</hi> returns, having told all to her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s concerning the young Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; commending that good fortune that had better crown'd her de<U+017F>ires, than the wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Councils could have done; to plant the per<U+017F>on <U+017F>he lov'd in the <U+017F>ame hou<U+017F>e with her. Having thus enflam'd <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> with de<U+017F>ire of <U+017F>eeing <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> <U+017F>he yet with-held her, being di<U+017F>order'd with want of Sleep, till <U+017F>he had re<U+017F>ted, and would appear with better Advantage.</p>
               <p>Leaving her thus <U+017F>atisfy'd, and in good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the event, and re<U+017F>olv'd on what method to take with the Strangers, <U+017F>he return'd. What is it, Son, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, that you <U+017F>o curiou<U+017F>ly enquire after? What Strangers are tho<U+017F>e with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (<U+017F>aid he) and from whence? I may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56010:140"/>you, <U+017F>aid <hi>Cybele,</hi> nor mu<U+017F>t you tell what you know, nor conver<U+017F>er with the Strangers. He obey'd his Mother, <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting <hi>Theagenes</hi> to be re<U+017F>erv'd for <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi>'s <U+017F>ervice; but is not this the per<U+017F>on (<U+017F>aid he within him<U+017F>elf as he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) who was re<U+017F>cued from me by the <hi>Be<U+017F><U+017F>ians,</hi> when he was deliver'd to me by <hi>Mitranes,</hi> to conduct him to <hi>Oroondates,</hi> who was to <U+017F>end him to our great King? In which attempt my Life was in danger, and I only e<U+017F>caped of tho<U+017F>e that guarded him? Do my Eyes deceive me? I have heard al<U+017F>o that <hi>Thyamis</hi> is arriv'd, and has fought in <U+017F>ingle Duel with his Brother for the Prie<U+017F>thood. It is certainly the <U+017F>ame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on. But at pre<U+017F>ent I mu<U+017F>t conceal the di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and ob<U+017F>erve <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi>'s proceedings with the Strangers. The<U+017F>e were his private <U+017F>entiments. <hi>Cybele</hi> in the mean time entring in upon them, perceiv'd what had pa<U+017F>t: For although at the operning of the Doors they endeavour'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves, yet they could not conceal their Grief from the <U+017F>ubtle old Lady; their Cheeks being <U+017F>till moi<U+017F>t with Tears. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Cry'd out, O my dear Children, why do you thus take on? When you ought to rejoice, and congratulate your good fortune: The mo<U+017F>t excellent <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> contrives all things for your <U+017F>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and has con<U+017F>ented that to morrow you <U+017F>hall be brought into her Pre<U+017F>ence: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you mu<U+017F>t put away the<U+017F>e Childi<U+017F>h Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taions; it is meet for you to compo<U+017F>e your

Only be rul'd by me in what manner you are to approach her (<U+017F>ince <U+017F>he has <U+017F>o commanded) and what mea<U+017F>ures you mu<U+017F>t take in what <U+017F>he <U+017F>hall command.

               <p>While <hi>Theagenes</hi> <U+017F>tood <U+017F>ilent, as conjecturing the flagitious meaning, the Eunuchs entred, bringing in Golden Chargers, the Remains of the Royal Banquet, that exceeded in Co<U+017F>t and Delicacy: When they had <U+017F>et them on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <U+017F>aying, That their Lady, in honour to the <U+017F>trangers, had <U+017F>o commanded, they departed: Yet, to omit no part of their Office, they fir<U+017F>t ta<U+017F>ted of every Di<U+017F>h.

When they told him after what menner <U+017F>he was to be acco<U+017F>ted; how he ought to adore her at his entrance, he an<U+017F>wered nothing. But going in, and finding her <U+017F>eated on a Tribunal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd in a Purple Robe, Embroider'd with Gold, Bracelets on her Arms, and a Rich <hi>Tiara</hi> on her Head, the Guards <U+017F>landing round, and the Nobles <U+017F>eated on each <U+017F>ide, his mind was not moved in the lea<U+017F>t; but as forgetting what was agreed on between him<U+017F>elf and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> his Spirit was the more exalted again<U+017F>t the Pride of this <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Pageant.

                  <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> towards him; <U+017F>etting before his Eyes not only tho<U+017F>e Beauties which appear'd in her, but likewi<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e that were conceal'd: Then <U+017F>he extoll'd her humour, that was affable and obliging, and the e<U+017F>teem that <U+017F>he had for Youths of noble Expectation. In <U+017F>hort, <U+017F>he made try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al by all <U+017F>he <U+017F>aid how he <U+017F>tood affected to the Delights of <hi>Venus. Theagenes</hi> acknowleg'd her Bourity towards him, her love to the <hi>Grecian</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>toms; and on all accounts return'd her Thanks and Prai<U+017F>e: But for the drift of her wiles he <U+017F>eem'd to take no notice. The Old Lady therefore was <U+017F>tung, to think that he under<U+017F>tood her intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but de<U+017F>pis'd and repell'd her attempts. She knew <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> would bear no longer delays, but exact performance of her promi<U+017F>e; <U+017F>he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put her off with pretences, <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Youth was timorous, and <U+017F>ometimes that ill Accidents had happen'd. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fifth and <U+017F>ixth days were pa<U+017F>t, in which <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> had again call'd <hi>Chariclea</hi> to her, and, to gratifie <hi>Theagenes,</hi> treated her with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable courte<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>he was forced to <U+017F>peak more plainly with <hi>Theagenes;</hi> to tell him her Ladies pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, a<U+017F><U+017F>uring him of ten thou<U+017F>and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages if he a<U+017F><U+017F>ented. Why are you (<U+017F>aid <U+017F>he) <U+017F>o aver<U+017F>e to Love? A Youth <U+017F>o beautiful, in the <U+017F>pring of his Age, belov'd by an equal Beauty, yet e<U+017F>teems not the good fortune: E<U+017F>pecially when no danger attends, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being ab<U+017F>ent, and I (who have bred her,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56010:142"/>and know all her <U+017F>ecrets) having the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the affair. On your own part, there can be no impediment, having neither Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s nor Wife. Though many have de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ed even the<U+017F>e con<U+017F>iderations, and thought they did not therein wrong their Dome<U+017F>tick concerns; but took the opportunity at once of making their fortune, and enjoying their plea<U+017F>ure. La<U+017F>tly, <U+017F>he mingled Threats with Arguments; <U+017F>aying, That the mo<U+017F>t obliging Women conceive the greate<U+017F>t di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>ure, when di<U+017F>appointed, and <U+017F>everely revenge the neglect. Think with your <U+017F>elf, That this Lady is a <hi>Per<U+017F>ian,</hi> and of Princely Blood, as you have acknowledg'd; with what Power <U+017F>he is ve<U+017F>ted; <U+017F>o that at her plea<U+017F>ure <U+017F>he may reward her Favourites with greate<U+017F>t Honours, and puni<U+017F>h tho<U+017F>e that di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige her. For your part, you are a <U+017F>tranger here, de<U+017F>erted, and have none to <U+017F>uccour you. Take pity both on your <U+017F>elf and her. She is worthy of your Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>ince you were Author of her pain, and it is for you <U+017F>he langui<U+017F>hes. At lea<U+017F>t, fear a Lovers Rage, and beware of that Revenge which follows Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. I have known many of your temper, who have repented too late.</p>
               <p>I have greater Experience in the<U+017F>e matters than you: The<U+017F>e hairs are grown grey in the Employment; but <U+017F>o ob<U+017F>tinate and incorrigible a Youth I never yet met withal.

The<U+017F>e things are to be wi<U+017F>h'd for by happy per<U+017F>ons, not by the De<U+017F>titute, and Strangers.

If <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> de<U+017F>pair, there will be, at lea<U+017F>t, this advantage in it, that we <U+017F>hall no more be troubled with her <U+017F>ollicitations.

I would, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, to no other per<U+017F>on di<U+017F>cover my Ladies <U+017F>ufferings; but <U+017F>ince her life is at <U+017F>take, and I know her fury will return upon my head, I am compell'd to <U+017F>peak: If po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly you can contrive any help for her that brought thee into the light, and nur<U+017F>ed thee with the<U+017F>e Brea<U+017F>ts.

               <p>The Old Lady imagining <hi>Theagenes</hi> to have con<U+017F>ented, ran to <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace;</hi> and being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring him after Supper, <U+017F>he accordingly did <U+017F>o: Commanding the Attendants to leave their Lady to her Re<U+017F>t, and clear her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <U+017F>he brought <hi>Theagenes</hi> into her Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

Seeing her Son di<U+017F>turb'd, <U+017F>he demanded the rea<U+017F>on.

The Stranger calls his Si<U+017F>ter his Spou<U+017F>e only to break off the Marriage with me: though if he <U+017F>hould Embrace, Ki<U+017F>s her, or Sleep with her, I <U+017F>hall never believe but <U+017F>he is his Si<U+017F>ter.

                  <hi>Begoas</hi> therefore, according to Command, went with the Letters <U+017F>igned with the Deputies own Seal, that at <hi>Memphis</hi> they might give him the better Credit, and more ea<U+017F>ily deliver the Strangers to him. <hi>Oroondates</hi> in the mean time <U+017F>et forward again<U+017F>t <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Achemenes</hi> to follow him; who knew
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56010:151"/>(thoughh no mention was made thereof) that he was kept in Cu<U+017F>tody till the truth of what he had informed were known. The<U+017F>e things pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed at <hi>Memphis.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Thyamis</hi> (while <hi>Achemenes</hi> was upon his way to <hi>Oroon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>) having in full power receiv'd the Office of High-Prie<U+017F>thood, an Office of fir<U+017F>t Rank in the City, and perform'd all Rites belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Funeral of <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> to the outmo<U+017F>t terms of the con<U+017F>tituted time, he then called to mind <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea:</hi> for now it was permitted to him, by the Pontificial Law, to conver<U+017F>e with Strangers. Therefore, upon enquiry, finding that they were carry'd to the Deputies Palace, he forthwith demanded them of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> alledging that they belong'd to him upon many accounts; That his Father <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> on his Death-bed, committed them to his care: Giving her thanks that <U+017F>he <U+017F>o courteou<U+017F>ly treated the Strangers, during his Confinement to the Temple: But however, that he was obliged to remand the Pledges left to his Tru<U+017F>t. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, reply'd <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> that while you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my Humanity, you condemn me at the <U+017F>ame time of Inho<U+017F>pitality, in <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing me not able or willing to provide for the Strangers. Not <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Thyamis,</hi> I know they may live here in greater plenty than with me, provided they are <U+017F>o contentel. But <U+017F>ince they are of Noble Race, and have run through changes of Fortune, and <U+017F>till are wanderets, nothing can
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56010:152"/>be <U+017F>o de<U+017F>irable to them as to recover their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Country. In which, that I might be a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting to them, my Father left me his charge, be<U+017F>ide many other obligations of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip between us.</p>
               <p>You do well, <U+017F>aid <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> to urge your Right, by which you will <U+017F>ooner prevail with me, than by force. Have you then dominion over them, <U+017F>aid <hi>Thyamis?</hi> By what means? By right of War, reply'd <U+017F>he, which made them my Captives, and con<U+017F>equently my Slaves. When therefore <hi>Thyamis</hi> under<U+017F>tood that <U+017F>he <U+017F>pake of <hi>Mitranes;</hi> O <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, it is not now War but Peace; as that brings into bondage, this <U+017F>hould <U+017F>et at liberty: Be<U+017F>ides, War and Peace <U+017F>hould be judg'd not by the Name, but Rea<U+017F>on and Con<U+017F>titution. How can it be Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable or Profitale to you to detain the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> could no longer contain; but that happen'd to her which is u<U+017F>ual for Lovers, while they think their <U+017F>entiments conceal'd, they have Mode<U+017F>ty; but when di<U+017F>cover'd, they lo<U+017F>e all <U+017F>ence of <U+017F>hame. She therefore <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Thyamis</hi> perceiv'd her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, made no account of his Prie<U+017F>tly Dignity, but ca<U+017F>ting off the Mode<U+017F>ty of her Sex, told him, That what he had done again<U+017F>t <hi>Mitranes</hi> <U+017F>hould not pa<U+017F>s unpuni<U+017F>hed; for the time <U+017F>hould come when <hi>Oroondates</hi> would call his Murderers to account. For the pre<U+017F>ent I will not di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s my
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56010:152"/>Va<U+017F><U+017F>als, though in little time they <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>ent to the King my Brother. Wherefore leave your idle rea<U+017F>onings of Rights or Wrong, with them that have Authority, and depart willingly from our Palace, le<U+017F>t you be compell'd by force. <hi>Thyamis</hi> therefore went forth, calling the Gods to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and affirming that the<U+017F>e things could come to no good i<U+017F><U+017F>ue; re<U+017F>olving to acquaint th Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty herewith, and call in their a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ace</hi> retir'd to her Chamber, calling <hi>Cybele</hi> to her, to take coun<U+017F>el of what was to be done. She had now <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of <hi>Achemenes</hi> his ab<U+017F>ence; and when <U+017F>he ask'd <hi>Cybele</hi> about it, <U+017F>he fram'd divers excu<U+017F>es, affirming any thing rather than own his departure to <hi>Oroondates.</hi> Yet <U+017F>he did not altogether impo<U+017F>e upon her, the length of time creating mi<U+017F>tru<U+017F>t. What <U+017F>hall we do, <hi>Cybele,</hi> <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he? Or how <U+017F>hall we work our <U+017F>elves out from the <U+017F>treights that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compa<U+017F>s us? My de<U+017F>ire is not le<U+017F><U+017F>en'd but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd by denial. The Youth grows more ob<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and intractable than ever. He has hitherto fram'd delays, but now he flatly denies me. And that which more troubles me, is lest he <U+017F>hould likewi<U+017F>e apprehend what I <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect of <hi>Achemenes.</hi> For <hi>Achemenes</hi> much di<U+017F>turbs me, being gone to <hi>Oroondates,</hi> to per<U+017F>wade him of what he knows or conjectures; if I could but <U+017F>ee <hi>Oroondates,</hi> one tender Word or Tear from me would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. But I am afraid, le<U+017F>t before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <hi>Theagenes,</hi> or can <U+017F>ee <hi>Oroondates,</hi> he <U+017F>hould
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56010:153"/>determine concerning me. Wherefore, <hi>Cybele,</hi> turn every Stone, try all your Art with the young man, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>ee our affairs are brought to the la<U+017F>t exigence: For you mu<U+017F>t imagine that when I de<U+017F>pair for my <U+017F>elf, I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>pave no other per<U+017F>on. Therefore take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of your Sons endeavour, for I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how you can be ignorant thereof. As for my Son, Madam, or my fidelity to you, you <U+017F>hall find that you cen<U+017F>ure fal<U+017F>ly. Wherefore, <U+017F>ince you <U+017F>o negligently pur<U+017F>ue your Love, you mu<U+017F>t not lay the blame on others: For you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecri<U+017F>e not the Authority of a Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s with him, but the <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of a Slave. Which method perhaps was di<U+017F>creet at fir<U+017F>t, but <U+017F>ince he is ob<U+017F>tinate, you <U+017F>hould make him feel your power, and con<U+017F>train him, by Torments, to obey your plea<U+017F>ure. It is the manner of Youths to de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e when they are Courted, but to <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit on Compul<U+017F>ion: Wherefore, he will do that by Puni<U+017F>hment, which he refus'd on En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties. You <U+017F>eem to <U+017F>peak rightly, <U+017F>aid, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ace,</hi> but how can I endure to <U+017F>ee him cha<U+017F>tiz'd. You are too tender, replyed <hi>Cybele,</hi> as though he would not by light cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ement be made to embrace Plea<U+017F>ure; and for your part of the <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, you will be rewarded with your outmo<U+017F>t Wi<U+017F>hes; but if you cannot beat the <U+017F>pectacle, deliver him to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> to be <U+017F>courg'd as for <U+017F>ome fault, which you may hear though not <U+017F>ee; and if you find him change his mind, you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56010:153"/>may at plea<U+017F>ure put an end to his Cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> <U+017F>uffer'd her <U+017F>elf to be per<U+017F>waded; for Love, when de<U+017F>pis'd, <U+017F>pares not the Object, but turns Kindne<U+017F>s into Revenge. Calling therefore the Chief Eunuch to her, <U+017F>he gave him Orders accordingly. He being by Nature envious, and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>t with inveteracy again<U+017F>t <hi>Theagenes,</hi> for what he had <U+017F>een and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, immediately threw him into Bonds, and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with Stripes and Hunger. The place was dark where he kept him, and though he knew the cau<U+017F>e, he di<U+017F><U+017F>embled, often asking <hi>Theagenes</hi> the rea<U+017F>on; who gave him no an<U+017F>wer wherefore he daily renew'd his Puni<U+017F>hment, and more <U+017F>everely than <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> intended. Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and <U+017F>uffering none to come to him be<U+017F>ide <hi>Cybele,</hi> who perpetually vi<U+017F>ited him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to commi<U+017F>erate his condition, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their former acquaintance, but indeed to find if he were to be wrought upon by the Tortures. He <U+017F>hew'd him<U+017F>elf more a Man, more re<U+017F>olute than ever, yielding his Body to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hment, triumphing in his Misfortune, that gave proof of his Love to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> and <U+017F>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That all was well with him if <U+017F>he did but know his Con<U+017F>tancy; continually calling her his Light, his Life, and Soul. When <hi>Cybele</hi> perceiv'd this, (contrary to the will of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi>) <U+017F>he gave command to have his torments encrea<U+017F>ed. Nei ther thus did <U+017F>he hope for <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, but la<U+017F>t means
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56010:154"/>were to be try'd when affairs were de<U+017F>perate; <U+017F>he expected that <hi>Oroondates,</hi> when he <U+017F>hould hear of it, would take Revenge on <hi>Achemenes.</hi> She fear'd le<U+017F>t <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> when her pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion was di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, would lay violent hands on her <U+017F>elf, and that con<U+017F>equently it were impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for her to e<U+017F>cape; wherefore, if things came to the wor<U+017F>t, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olv'd to involve all together in the <U+017F>ame fate.</p>
               <p>Returning therefore to <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> We lo<U+017F>e our labour, Madam, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, he is <U+017F>till more re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ob<U+017F>tinate, having always <hi>Chariclea</hi> in his Mouth, and <U+017F>olacing his <U+017F>ufferings with her Name. Let us therefore ca<U+017F>t forth our la<U+017F>t An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and remove this Ob<U+017F>tacle to our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: If he <U+017F>hall once know that <U+017F>he is dead, he will of cour<U+017F>e admit your kindne<U+017F>s, de<U+017F>pair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his former Love.</p>

For though the power be in your own hands, yet the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Laws forbid to put any to Death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Judgment of the Magi<U+017F>trates. You mu<U+017F>t therefore contrive to lay <U+017F>ome Crime to her Charge: Yet if you think fitting (for I would run any hazzard for your <U+017F>ake) I will attempt her Life by Poy<U+017F>on. <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> approv'd hereof, and commanded her to do it.

                  <hi>Chariclea</hi> was fill'd with horrour, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to lift her up; <U+017F>he likewi<U+017F>e call'd the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of them that were pre<U+017F>ent; for the mi<U+017F>chief <U+017F>eem'd <U+017F>wifter than an Arrow, the Poy<U+017F>on being of <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong a Tincture, as to de<U+017F>troy the younge<U+017F>t and <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t Con<U+017F>tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but in a feeble and old Body it di<U+017F>pers'd it <U+017F>elf in a mimute through all the Vitals.

                  <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> was enrag'd hereat, and commanded her to be <U+017F>truck: Carry, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, this Victim, bound as <U+017F>he is, to let her Lover <U+017F>ee how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>he returns his Con<U+017F>tancy; command <hi>Euphrates</hi> to load her all over with Chains, and leave them together, till the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tracy <U+017F>hall be a<U+017F><U+017F>embled to morrow for her Condemnation. By this time the Maid that <U+017F>erv'd the Wine was brought in: She was an <hi>Ionian</hi> Slave, and the <U+017F>ame that by <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> was appointed to wait on <hi>Chariclea.</hi> Whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <U+017F>he was mov'd with kindne<U+017F>s to her, or by Divine Impul<U+017F>ion, <U+017F>he <U+017F>igh'd and wept mo<U+017F>t bitterly. O wretched Creature, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, and void of all Crime! The <U+017F>tanders-by being in wonder hereat, and urging her to <U+017F>peak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <U+017F>he confe<U+017F><U+017F>ed that <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf gave the Poy<U+017F>on to <hi>Cybele,</hi> having receiv'd it fir<U+017F>t from her, to admini<U+017F>ter it to <hi>Chariclea:</hi> That, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was through concern at <U+017F>o unwonted a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56010:156"/>Practice, or whether mi<U+017F>taking the Signs of <hi>Cybele,</hi> ordering to mini<U+017F>ter fir<U+017F>t to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> <U+017F>he changed the Cups, and gave the Poy<U+017F>on to the Old Lady. She was therefore led to <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> as thinking <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould plea<U+017F>e her in clearing <hi>Chariclea.</hi> But when <U+017F>he had given her this account, <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> commanded her al<U+017F>o to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Cu<U+017F>tody, as an Accomplice in the fact, and to be kept for the next days Se<U+017F><U+017F>ion. She al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ummon'd the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Magi<U+017F>trates, by Me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>engers, to be ready. When therefore they were <U+017F>at, early in the morning, <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> gave in her Accu<U+017F>ation, telling all that had pa<U+017F>t, condoling al<U+017F>o with Tears, the lo<U+017F>s of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on that bred her, who was dearer to her than her life; appealing to the Judges with how much courte<U+017F>ie <U+017F>he had treated the <U+017F>tranger, who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn had done her <U+017F>uch Injury. <hi>Chariclea</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer'd nothing to the Charge, but confe<U+017F>t the Crime, affirming that <U+017F>he gave the Poy<U+017F>on, adding al<U+017F>o that <U+017F>he would likewi<U+017F>e have taken off <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> had <U+017F>he not been prevented. For having told her re<U+017F>olutions over-night to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and conferr'd with him, <U+017F>he re<U+017F>olv'd to undergo any manner of Death, to depart from a life <U+017F>o full of trouble, of implacable Fortune, and endle<U+017F>s Wanderings; <U+017F>he there bid him her la<U+017F>t farewel. The Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and Jewels, with the re<U+017F>t that were expos'd with her, which <U+017F>he always <U+017F>ecretly pre<U+017F>erv'd, <U+017F>he now placed next to her Body, carrying; as it were, with her the Rites of her Funeral,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56010:156"/>She therefore own'd every Crime that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, and more than were charg'd. For which rea<U+017F>on the Judges hardly forbore from inflicting the outmo<U+017F>t Tortures, after the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ian</hi> manner; yet moved with her Youth and Beauty, they only <U+017F>entenc'd her to die by Fire. She was therefore <U+017F>eiz'd by the Guards, and hurry'd forth beyond the Walls, the Beadle continually crying out, That it was for Poy<U+017F>on that <U+017F>he <U+017F>uffer'd; a va<U+017F>t multitude from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty following them. Some of them had <U+017F>een her led to Tryal, others, by rea<U+017F>on of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour <U+017F>pread all over the City, came to have a view of her. <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> was al<U+017F>o pre<U+017F>ent, and <U+017F>at a Spectator on the Wall: For it would have troubled her not to have beheld <hi>Chariclea</hi> <U+017F>uffer. When therefore the Officers had rai<U+017F>ed a great Pile, and <U+017F>et Fire thereunto, <hi>Chariclea</hi> begg'd re<U+017F>pite from tho<U+017F>e that led her, <U+017F>aying, That <U+017F>he would of her own accord a<U+017F>cend the Pile. O Sun and Earth (<U+017F>he cryed out) O powers above, and you that below take Vengeance on wicked Souls, you are witne<U+017F><U+017F>es that I am Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of all that is laid to my Charge. But that I my <U+017F>elf willingly <U+017F>ubmit to Death, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable troubles which I <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain. Receive me therefore with favour. However, take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> for who<U+017F>e crimes I <U+017F>uffer; <U+017F>he is an Adultre<U+017F>s, and does this to deprive me of my Husband. When <U+017F>he had thus <U+017F>poken, the people thouted, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>aying, That <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be re<U+017F>erv'd
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56010:157"/>for another Tryal, others endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cue her; in the mean time <U+017F>he a<U+017F>cended the Pile, where for a long while <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood unhurt, the Fire rather circling about, than approaching her, <U+017F>erving only to make her Beauty more con<U+017F>picuous, and adorning the Pile, as it were a Nuptial Bed. She pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed from one part to another, admiring at what happen'd, and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death, but in vain, for the flame <U+017F>till turn'd off from her. The Officers, in the mean time, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing on their part; <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> al<U+017F>o beckning to them from the Wall to do their duty; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they heap'd on more combu<U+017F>tible matter. Neither could they thus prevail. The Citizens were troubled, thinking there was <U+017F>ome Divine A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, and cry'd out, That <U+017F>he was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Several approaching to the Pile took off the Torturers, <hi>Thyamis</hi> beginning, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the people thereunto, (for the clamour had now brought him abroad.) Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore de<U+017F>irous to deliver <hi>Chariclea,</hi> they dur<U+017F>t not them<U+017F>elves approach the Fire, but call'd to her to come out; for that there could be no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for her to leave the Fire, who had continu'd therein without hurt. She hearing this, and judging her<U+017F>elf to be pre<U+017F>erv'd by Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, would not be Ingrateful, and refu<U+017F>e their favour: She therefore leapt down from the Pile. As the Multitude for Joy and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <U+017F>houted out, <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> not able to bear it, ran down from the Walls through a little Gate,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56010:157"/>and with a <U+017F>trong Guard of <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> laid hands on <hi>Chariclea.</hi> Then looking <U+017F>ternly upon the People, Are you not a<U+017F>ham'd, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cue from puni<U+017F>hment a Woman that is a Witch and Poy<U+017F>oner by her own Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion? While you give her aid, you do violence to the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Laws; to the Judges, Deputy, and King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf. You are mi<U+017F>taken, in imputing her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to the Gods: Will you not come to your <U+017F>ences, and find that this is the effect of her Witchcraft, in which <U+017F>he has <U+017F>uch command, as even to re<U+017F>train the power of Fire. A<U+017F><U+017F>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therefore to morrow in Common Council, and you <U+017F>hall not only hear her Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but al<U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e of her Accomplices, whom I have in Cu<U+017F>tody.</p>
               <p>Herewithal <U+017F>he led her away, her<U+017F>elf going next to her, and commanding the Guards to keep off the Crowd. But the People were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, part of them had thoughts of re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, part of them having <U+017F>till <U+017F>ome <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion of her Witchcraft, and the re<U+017F>t fearing the Power of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace. Chariclea</hi> therefore is once more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and loaded with more Irons; re<U+017F>erved for a <U+017F>econd Sentence and Execution: But <U+017F>till ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing her fortune, in <U+017F>eeing <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> and conferring with him about what had pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed. For <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> had <U+017F>o order'd it, out of Malice, that the young pair might behold each others mi<U+017F>ery, and be mutually afflicted with each others <U+017F>ufferings: For <U+017F>he knew that the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56010:158"/>torment of the per<U+017F>on belov'd, more affected the Lover than the party that <U+017F>uffer'd. But it was by them e<U+017F>teem'd as an Advantage, to <U+017F>ee each others Con<U+017F>tancy. It was <U+017F>ome relief to conver<U+017F>e together, and comfort one another with the con<U+017F>ideration, that what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd was upon the account of Truth and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>After they had till midnight di<U+017F>cours'd, in <U+017F>uch a manner as was proper for Lovers that were never more to talk together; they at la<U+017F>t talk'd of the Miracle that happen'd about the Fire. <hi>Theagenes</hi> imputed it to the kindne<U+017F>s of the Gods, who <U+017F>hewed their Indignation again<U+017F>t the unju<U+017F>t Decree of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace;</hi> but <hi>Chariclea</hi> was doubtful. That Accident, <U+017F>aid <U+017F>he, <U+017F>eems to have come by Divine Providence, but to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd only for greater Misfortunes, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Gods, unle<U+017F>s they have <U+017F>ecretly decreed to give relief at the greate<U+017F>t Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theagenes</hi> advis'd her to think more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Divine Powers: Be propitious to us, O ye Deities, <U+017F>aid he! Was it a Dream or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which now comes into my mind? it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the la<U+017F>t night but one; I know not how I came to forget it, but it now returns to my Memory. The Dream was a Ver<U+017F>e which <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<U+017F>iris</hi> <U+017F>eem'd to expound. The words were the<U+017F>e:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56010:158"/>
                  <q>
                     <l>Thee from the Flame <hi>Pantarbe</hi>'s Pow'r <U+017F>hall guard</l>
                     <l>Strange Force! but nothing to the Gods is hard.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theagenes</hi> now <U+017F>eem'd in<U+017F>pir'd, and leap'd forth as far as his Chains would permit, crying, Be merciful to us, ye Gods. For I further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member another Oracle deliver'd to me by a like Prophet (whether it were <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> or <U+017F>ome God is his form) containing the<U+017F>e Words:
<q>
                     <l>You with the Nymph <U+017F>hall <hi>Aethiop</hi> reach, and be</l>
                     <l>To morrow from <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi>'s Bondage free.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That which concerns me herein, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand; for tho<U+017F>e Man<U+017F>ions of the Dead under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, <U+017F>eem, proper to the Land of <hi>Aethiopia:</hi> By the Maid, I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, <hi>Pro<U+017F>erpine</hi> is meant, with whom I <U+017F>hall inhabit; and my freedom from Chains, my departure from this Body. But what can the Rhime contain concerning you, which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts of Contradictions? for wherea <hi>Pantarbe</hi> <U+017F>ignifies <hi>fearing all things,</hi> yet it commands not to fear the Flame. Then, <U+017F>aid <hi>Chariclea,</hi> continuance of calamities, my <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> makes per<U+017F>ons hope thhe wor<U+017F>t in all things; for people u<U+017F>ually accommodate their Minds to their Fortune: But I have better hopes of this Prophecy than you. What if I am the Nymph with whom you are to arrive into <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> after you have e<U+017F>caped from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56010:159"/>the Bonds of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace?</hi> But how that <U+017F>hall be, is neither manife<U+017F>t nor credible to us, but to the Gods it may be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible: Let them take care of that who gave the Prophecy. That part which related to me you have already <U+017F>een accompli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my wonderful pre<U+017F>ervation. And though at that time I knew not that I carry'd my <U+017F>afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard about me, yet I now under<U+017F>tand that I did. Tho<U+017F>e precious things that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with me in my Infancy, I have always accu<U+017F>tom'd to carry conceal'd about me, to <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities when brought to the la<U+017F>t dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; but if Death <U+017F>hould overtake me, to an<U+017F>wer the Charge of my Funeral. Among<U+017F>t the<U+017F>e, <hi>Theagenes,</hi> there are Bracelets of great value, with <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Stones, with a certain Ring given by my Father to my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which is the Stone call'd <hi>Pantarbe,</hi> <U+017F>et in a Square, with Sacred Letters about it. It <U+017F>eems to have <U+017F>ome Divine Virtue in it, by which it repell'd the power of the Flames, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erving tho<U+017F>e that carry it, from any hurt. I conjecture, and know <U+017F>o much, by what was <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>ted by the Divine <hi>Cala<U+017F>iris,</hi> who told me, That the <U+017F>ame was expre<U+017F><U+017F>ed in the Writings that were found with me. This <U+017F>eems proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <U+017F>aid <hi>Theagenes,</hi> by the Deliverance that you have had; but what <hi>Pantarbe</hi> <U+017F>hall defend us from to morrows danger? For though it <U+017F>hould <U+017F>till defend from the Fire, it cannot give Immortality; and <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi>'s Malice will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56010:159"/><U+017F>ome more violent means to de<U+017F>troy us. And would to Heaven that the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ort of Death, and in the <U+017F>ame hour, would di<U+017F>patch us both! I <U+017F>hould think this Death but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea<U+017F>e from all our <U+017F>ufferings. Take heart, <U+017F>aid <hi>Chariclea,</hi> we have another <hi>Pantarbe</hi> promis'd in the Oracle.</p>
               <p>While they were employ'd in the<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, each affirming, That the others mi<U+017F>ery more afflicted them than their own: obliging them<U+017F>elves, by mutual Oaths, to pre<U+017F>erve their Loves and Vertue to Death. It being now in the very dead of night, <hi>Bagoas,</hi> with his fifty Hor<U+017F>e, arriv'd at <hi>Memphis.</hi> When they had waken'd the Sentinels, and had given account of them<U+017F>elves, they were immediately receiv'd into the Deputies Palace. <hi>Bagoas</hi> left this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany without, to guard the Hou<U+017F>e, to be ready for his Defence, if any Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance were made. He him<U+017F>elf, in the mean time, went a private way, ea<U+017F>ily forcing the Doors, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Silence, to the place where <hi>Euphrates</hi> was, the Moon not being yet quite <U+017F>et; finding him therefore in Bed, he awaken'd him, who in di<U+017F>order cry'd out, Who are you? It is I, <U+017F>aid <hi>Bagoas,</hi> command a light to be brought in. He therefore order'd the Boy that waited on him, to bring in a Taper, <U+017F>o as to di<U+017F>turb none of the re<U+017F>t. When this was done, and the Boy departed, What Mi<U+017F>chief, <U+017F>aid <hi>Euphrates,</hi> has occa<U+017F>ion'd this untimely and unexpected Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val?
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56010:160"/>There needs not many words, <U+017F>aid <hi>Bagoas,</hi> read the<U+017F>e Letters, but before take notice of the Seal, and know that <hi>Oroondates</hi> <U+017F>ent them; and that it is as much as your Life is worth, not to perform what they import.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Euphrates</hi> had run over the Letters; As for <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, <U+017F>he will be <U+017F>orry, having ye<U+017F>terday fallen into a Fever, which <U+017F>till conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues <U+017F>o violent, that there is <U+017F>mall hope of her Life. But for my part, I would not deliver the<U+017F>e Letters to her, though <U+017F>he her<U+017F>elf ask'd for them; for I know <U+017F>he would de<U+017F>troy both her <U+017F>elf and us, before <U+017F>he would <U+017F>end away the young Pair. Know however, that you are come in good time to take them away, and mu<U+017F>t therein u<U+017F>e your utmo<U+017F>t endeavour. Take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion on them, they having <U+017F>uffer'd a hundred Tortures, unwillingly inflicted by me, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd by <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace.</hi> They <U+017F>eem however of Noble Birth, and for the Experience that I have had of them, of Vertuous Cover<U+017F>ation. Having <U+017F>aid this, he brought him to the Pri<U+017F>on, where <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goas</hi> no <U+017F>ooner beheld them, though wa<U+017F>ted with Watchings and Torture, yet he was a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed at their Stature and Beauty. But they <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing that <hi>Bagoas</hi> was come at that <U+017F>ilent time of the Night, to lead them to a Clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tine Execution, were a little troubled. But <U+017F>oon recovering a chearful countenance, they made it appear how little they were concern'd. <hi>Euphrates</hi> now coming up, and knocking out
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56010:160"/>the Wooden Peg with which their Irons were joyned, Take your Sacrifice, <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace,</hi> he cry'd out: She thinks in night and darkne<U+017F>s to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her horrid Crime, but the Eye of Ju<U+017F>tice is <U+017F>harp in di<U+017F>covering and bringing to Light the Deeds of Darkne<U+017F>s. Do you execute what you are commanded, and whether Fire, Sword, or Water is determin'd again<U+017F>t us, let us only have the <U+017F>ame Death. <hi>Chariclea</hi> de<U+017F>ired the <U+017F>ame. The Eunuchs weeping, led them forth in their Chains. When they were come out of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties hou<U+017F>e, <hi>Euphrates</hi> <U+017F>tarid there. But <hi>Bagoas,</hi> with his fifty Hor<U+017F>e, having taken off their Bonds, and left only what might <U+017F>ecure, but not burden them; mounting them on <U+017F>everal Hor<U+017F>es, and putting them in the middle of the Guards, made towards <hi>Thebes</hi> as fa<U+017F>t as he could. When they had travell'd all the re<U+017F>t of the night, and till nine the next morning, without any <U+017F>top, the Sun then growing hot, they could proceed no farther, being <U+017F>pent al<U+017F>o for want of Sleep, <hi>Chariclea</hi> e<U+017F>pecially; they determin'd therefore to take up <U+017F>omewhere to re<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves, and refre<U+017F>h their Hor<U+017F>es. There was a certain Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley at the foot of a Promontory of the <hi>Nile,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>urrounded with the Water, which made an Eddy: There was much Gra<U+017F>s and Herbage on the place, as being always well Water'd, every where <U+017F>haded with Sycamore Trees, and <U+017F>uch others as grow on the Banks of the <hi>Nile:</hi> The <hi>Bagoas,</hi> with his Company, took up,

They thought it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s for per<U+017F>ons that were pre<U+017F>ently to die; but he per<U+017F>waded them there was no <U+017F>uch thing intended; That they carry'd them not to Death, but to <hi>Oroondates.</hi> But now the Heat of the day decrea<U+017F>ing, the Sun being no longer over their Heads, but faln We<U+017F>tward, and beating on their <U+017F>ides, while <hi>Bagoas</hi> was going to take Hor<U+017F>e again, a certain Hor<U+017F>e-man in a <U+017F>weat, and out of breath with hard Riding, came up, and took him a<U+017F>ide to <U+017F>peak with him: He fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eyes upon the ground, as it were, full of thought concerning what had been told him: Take Comfort, Strangers, <U+017F>aid he, your Enemy <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> is dead by her own hand, under<U+017F>tanding that you were taken away, preventing a nece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ary, by a voluntary Fate: For <U+017F>he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have e<U+017F>caped puni<U+017F>hment from <hi>Oroondates,</hi> or the King; and if <U+017F>he had not been put to Death, at lea<U+017F>t mu<U+017F>t have led the remainder of her Life in Di<U+017F>grace. <hi>Euphrates</hi> <U+017F>ends me this Intelligence. Wherefore be of good Hope, for I am well a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd that you have done no body wrong, and <U+017F>he that injur'd you is Dead. Thus <U+017F>pake <hi>Bagoas</hi> in imperfect <hi>Greek;</hi> adding al<U+017F>o, That he him<U+017F>elf was glad, having <U+017F>uffer'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tyranny of <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace:</hi> Wherefore he the more encourag'd his Pri<U+017F>oners: For he hop'd that <hi>Oroondates</hi> would be pleas'd with his <U+017F>ervice, if he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56010:161"/>carry'd them <U+017F>afe to him; the Youth being likely to grace his Retinue, and the Virgin, <U+017F>o matchle<U+017F>s Beauty, would probably be made his Wife, <U+017F>ince <hi>Ar<U+017F>ace</hi> was dead. <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea</hi> rejoyced at the News, highly prai<U+017F>ing the Ju<U+017F>tice of the Gods; nor did they think they could after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be much di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s'd, what<U+017F>oever Fortune <U+017F>hould befal them, <U+017F>ince their mo<U+017F>t inveterante Enemy was gone. When now the Evening drew on, with a cool breeze, inviting them to <U+017F>et forward, they mounted again, and rode all that night and part of the next morning, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, to overtake <hi>Oroondates,</hi> before he went from <hi>Thebes.</hi> But they met with a Souldier from the Army, who told them <hi>Oroondates</hi> was gone from thence, having <U+017F>ent him to draw out all the Garri<U+017F>ons, and ha<U+017F>ten with them to <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ene,</hi> all things being in di<U+017F>order, and fearing le<U+017F>t the City <U+017F>hould be taken. For the Deputy coming too late, the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> had marched their Army thither with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>peed, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the news of their approach: <hi>Bagoas</hi> therefore turn'd off from his intended Journey, and took the next Road to <hi>Syene.</hi> But approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Town, they happen'd upon a Party of <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> who were <U+017F>ent as Spies to <U+017F>ecure the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>es for the Army.</p>
               <p>But by rea<U+017F>on of the night, and their unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Country, (for they were order'd to plant an Ambu<U+017F>cade in every place which they found convenient) they po<U+017F>ted
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56010:162"/>them<U+017F>elves among<U+017F>t certain Bu<U+017F>hes by the River <U+017F>ide, partly for <U+017F>afeguard, and partly for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment from their Enemies: And here they <U+017F>tood upon their Watch. Therefore at break of day, when they perceiv'd <hi>Bagoas,</hi> with his Hor<U+017F>e-men to pa<U+017F>s by them, and were a<U+017F><U+017F>ured there were no more to follow, they i<U+017F><U+017F>ued from their Covert, with loud <U+017F>houts. <hi>Bagoas</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and his company, <U+017F>urprized with the noi<U+017F>e, knowing them, by their colour, to be <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> and <U+017F>eeing their number too great to be encountred, (for there were in all a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and <U+017F>ent out for Scouts) he fled, without once looking them in the face; yet no <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t at fir<U+017F>t as he could have done, but <U+017F>o as to pre<U+017F>erve his Order. The others pur<U+017F>u'd, <U+017F>ending out two hundred of their <hi>Troglodytae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Troglodytae</hi> are a people of <hi>Aethiop</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Pa<U+017F>tures, and Borderers on <hi>Arabia,</hi> who have wonderful <U+017F>wiftne<U+017F>s both by Nature and Exerci<U+017F>e from their Childhood. They are not us'd to heavy Arms, they therefore u<U+017F>e Slings in fight to wound the Enemy at di<U+017F>tance, and tru<U+017F>t to their heels when they find them<U+017F>elves over-power'd. They know 'tis impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for the Enemy to overtaken them, till they can hide them<U+017F>elves in Rocks and Caves. The<U+017F>e there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pur<U+017F>ued on foot, di<U+017F>charging their Slings, but not being able to <U+017F>tand again<U+017F>t the Hor<U+017F>e, return'd to their own Party. But by fre<U+017F>h num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers i<U+017F><U+017F>uing out upon then, the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> are <U+017F>cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,

                  <hi>Bagoas</hi> him<U+017F>elf thrown from his Hor<U+017F>e; and taken. <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea</hi> partly thinking it unworthy not to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t <hi>Bagoas,</hi> (who had us'd Civility to them, and to whom they were likely to have been farther obliged) leapt down to <U+017F>uccour him, but to no purpo<U+017F>e, not being Arm'd. This is my Dream, <U+017F>aid <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> and the<U+017F>e the <hi>Aethiops,</hi> into who<U+017F>e Country I was to be carry'd. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold it better to <U+017F>ubmit our <U+017F>elves to them, rather than experience a doubtful fortune with <hi>Oroondates. Chariclea</hi> under<U+017F>tood the re<U+017F>t, the Accident now leading her, as it were, by the Hand, judging them rather to be Friends than Enemies. Yet <U+017F>he told not her <U+017F>entiments to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> only <U+017F>aid that <U+017F>he was contented to do <U+017F>o. When therefore the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> came up, and knew <hi>Bagoas,</hi> by his Face, to be an Eunuch, and the Per<U+017F>ons that were unarm'd, of mo<U+017F>t beautiful frame, they asked them, Who they were, both by an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> and <hi>Per<U+017F>ian,</hi> as not doubting but that they under<U+017F>tood the one or other Language. Wherefore <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who had <hi>Aegyptian</hi> enough to an<U+017F>wer <U+017F>hort Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tions, told them, They were chief Servants to the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Deputy, but them<U+017F>elves <hi>Grecians,</hi> taken Pri<U+017F>oners by the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians,</hi> but now, they hoped with better fortune, put into the hands of <hi>Aethiopians.</hi> They therefore re<U+017F>olv'd to <U+017F>pare them, and carry them Captive to their King, as the fir<U+017F>t Booty of the War, and the mo<U+017F>t emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56010:163"/>Ornaments of the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Court. For the Eunuchs are the Eyes, and Ears of the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Court, as having neither Children nor Kindred, on whom to place their Affection, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wholly devoted to the Intere<U+017F>t of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter, on whom they depend. But for the young Pair, they reckon'd that they would be no <U+017F>mall Grace to their Kings Palace.

                  <hi>SYene</hi> was now almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>urrounded in Siege, as it were in a Net, by the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> numbers. For <hi>Oroondates</hi> hearing of the Enemies approach, left <hi>Cataractae,</hi> and went with his Forces to <hi>Syene,</hi> which he enter'd, <U+017F>hutting up the Gates, and planting Slings and Engines on the Walls, conjecturing that which afterwards happen'd. While therefore the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian</hi> King, at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance, was inform'd by his Spies that <hi>Oroondates</hi> was making to the Town, he ha<U+017F>ten'd his March to prevent him, but however came too late. He then planted his Army round the City, and <U+017F>o with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56010:164"/>any Engagement, fat as it had been in a Theatre. He brought with him <U+017F>ix hundred thou<U+017F>and men, and Cattel, with which he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd all the ground about <hi>Syene.</hi> The Spies finding him there, brought their Captives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. He was not only delighted with their Beauty, but with the good Omen of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Pri<U+017F>oners in Chains <U+017F>et before him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! <U+017F>aid he, the Gods at our fir<U+017F>t Arrival <U+017F>end us Slaves in Bonds. The<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fir<U+017F>t fruits of our War, <U+017F>hall be kept in Cu<U+017F>tody till our return, then to be offer'd to our Gods in our Triumphal Sacrifices, according to the Ancient Laws of our Country. Having therefore rewarded the Spies, he gave the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oners into the clo<U+017F>e cu<U+017F>tody of per<U+017F>ons that could <U+017F>peak their Language; giving them great Charge to treat them with Re<U+017F>pect and Care; to <U+017F>upply them with the be<U+017F>t Provi<U+017F>ion, and above all, to pre<U+017F>erve them from all Contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becau<U+017F>e they were re<U+017F>erved for Victims: La<U+017F>tly, That their Bonds of Iron <U+017F>hould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and Fetters of Gold put upon them: For Gold among<U+017F>t the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> is made u<U+017F>e of for all things that Iron is among<U+017F>t other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>This was done as he commanded. When therefore the former were taken off, and the Golden Chains put on, <hi>Theagenes</hi> <U+017F>miling, <U+017F>aid, What means this <U+017F>plendid Change? Fortune flatters us, in rendring us rich by our Captivity,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56010:164"/><U+017F>ince we are only Captives of greater Price. <hi>Chariclea</hi> al<U+017F>o <U+017F>miled, and de<U+017F>ired him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive better hopes of what the Gods fore-told. <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> now attacking the City, and thinking to carry it at fir<U+017F>t on<U+017F>et, found him<U+017F>elf deceived, the Be<U+017F>ieged <U+017F>o manfully re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting his Forces, and beating them off; adding al<U+017F>o Scoffs and Contumelies. He was therefore enraged that they <U+017F>o much as offer'd to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, and did not <U+017F>urrender them<U+017F>elves on the fir<U+017F>t Attack: He re<U+017F>olved to lo<U+017F>e no time, or make <U+017F>uch a Siege, whereby <U+017F>ome might be taken, and <U+017F>ome e<U+017F>cape; but at once to overthrow the whole City by an inevitable De<U+017F>truction.</p>
               <p>He thus order'd the Word: He made a Ditch about the Ground that lay next to the Walls, (yet at <U+017F>uch di<U+017F>tance that the Slings and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows from the Town could not reach it) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ten Men to every ten Yards, to be dug of a <U+017F>ufficient breadth and depth; <U+017F>ome therefore broke the Earth, while others receiv'd the Mold, which they piled up on that <U+017F>ide of the Trench that was next his Camp, which <U+017F>erv'd as a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Fortre<U+017F>s to the Town: None from thence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to mole<U+017F>t the Work, not daring to <U+017F>ally forth again<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch Numbers; and their Slings not throwing <U+017F>o far, as the di<U+017F>tant <U+017F>pace reach'd between the two Walls. Having pre<U+017F>ently fini<U+017F>h'd this affair, by multitude of hands, he began another Project. When this Round Ditch was compleated, he left part of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56010:165"/>ca<U+017F>ting up a Bank, and from thence made another Trench, that turned off to the River <hi>Nile,</hi> (which Trench he banked up on both <U+017F>ides) when therefore he had joined the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aid Banks to tho<U+017F>e of the River, breaking down the Fence, as it were, by opening a Sluce, he let the Stream into his Trench, which by the de<U+017F>cent from the River to that lower Channel, made <U+017F>uch a dreadful noi<U+017F>e, that it was heard at a va<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tance. When the Citizens heard and <U+017F>aw into what di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s they were brought by this Inundation, which pre<U+017F>ently over-ran the Plain between the Walls, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, preventing their E<U+017F>cape, and that it was equally dangerous to tarry, they <U+017F>et them<U+017F>elves to do all that was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for per<U+017F>ons in <U+017F>uch exigence. In the fir<U+017F>t place, as the Wood-work of their Gates began to give way, the <U+017F>topt up the Chinks with Straw and Pitch, <U+017F>etting props and weights again<U+017F>t them; they al<U+017F>o ran up Buttre<U+017F><U+017F>es to <U+017F>upport their Wall. One brought Earth, another Stones, a third Straw, and whatever they could get together; no Hands were unemploy'd, Women, Children, and Old Age <U+017F>et them<U+017F>elves to the work: for <U+017F>o general and pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing a Calamity excu<U+017F>ed none. But to the more Youthful, Orders were given to make a <U+017F>ubterranean Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the Enemies Bulwark.</p>
               <p>The Work was performed after this manner. They fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>unk a Pit, five yards deep perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, then by the help of Torches, they dug
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56010:165"/><U+017F>trait before them, a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to the Enemies Banks; tho<U+017F>e that were behind <U+017F>till in order receiving the Earth from them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which was convey'd into the City-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and there laid on a heap. This they did, with de<U+017F>ign that when the Water <U+017F>hould fall into this Cavern, it <U+017F>hould force it <U+017F>elf a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age out another way. But they were prevented, for the <hi>Nile</hi> fell <U+017F>o plentifully into the Upper Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, that the <U+017F>pace between the two Walls was now a <U+017F>tanding Lake, <U+017F>o that <hi>Syene,</hi> an inland Town, was now turn'd into an I<U+017F>land, quite <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Water. The Wall <U+017F>u<U+017F>tain'd the weight thereof for one whole day, but when it was <U+017F>welled higher, and al<U+017F>o had <U+017F>unk underneath the foundation, the ground being <U+017F>oft and <U+017F>pungy, it then in <U+017F>everal place began to yield, and threaten a Delugen on the City.</p>
               <p>The next Evening, a Part that was between two Towers, fell down; yet not <U+017F>o as to lye below the Flood, but <U+017F>o as pre<U+017F>ently to threaten an Inundation: Upon which a great Cry was <U+017F>et up among<U+017F>t the Inhabitants, that reach'd to the Enemies Camp; and with hands lift up towards Heaven, be<U+017F>eech'd the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of the Gods. They be<U+017F>ought <hi>Oroondates</hi> to <U+017F>end Me<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>engers to beg Peace with <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes.</hi> He was forced to <U+017F>ubmit, but being <U+017F>hut in with the Waters, no Me<U+017F><U+017F>engers could pa<U+017F>s: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fa<U+017F>ten'd Petitionary Letters to Stones, which he threw from Slings, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56010:166"/>for the di<U+017F>tance prov'd too great to permit their coming home; he then try'd by way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, while the Archers and Slingers vved with each other, but <U+017F>till in vain: In the la<U+017F>t place, they <U+017F>tretch'd forth their hands towards the Enemies Bulwark in <U+017F>uppliant manner, to <U+017F>ignifie what they intended by their <U+017F>hootings; and <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put them behind their Backs, to <U+017F>hew that they were willing to receive their Chairs. <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> under<U+017F>tood their Signals, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Acceptance: For the <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion of an Enemy commands Clemency from generous Minds. But he fir<U+017F>t thought fit to make tryal of what they meant, in order whereunto he <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ten Boats, which fell down to his Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ide, from the breach of the <hi>Nile;</hi> into the<U+017F>e he put Archers and armed men, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as the thought fit, and <U+017F>ent them over to the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians.</hi> They therefore told them, That if they had any Hope or Confidence left, they <U+017F>hould prepare for Fight. It was a new Spectacle on an inland Soil, to <U+017F>ee Boats row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Wall to Wall, over cultivated Grounds. It was yet a greater wonder to <U+017F>ee a Naval Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <U+017F>torming a Town, and Land Souldiers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with them. They therefore that were in the Town, <U+017F>eeing Ships, with Armed Men, approaching that part of their Wall which was broken down, were <U+017F>eiz'd with terrour, (as people in great di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s and extremity are always <U+017F>u<U+017F>picious.) They hurl'd Stones from the Walls,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56010:166"/>and <U+017F>hot Arrows into the Boats, that came for their pre<U+017F>ervation. Thus Men that de<U+017F>pair of Life, yet reckon it as an advantage, for a while to delay their Fate. Yet they <U+017F>o order'd their bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, as not to wound, but only to keep them off. The <hi>Aethiopians</hi> likewi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>charg'd their Arrows, not knowing the intentions of the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians;</hi> by which means <U+017F>everal of the wounded fell down headlong from the Wall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water. The War therefore grew hot, till a certain Illu<U+017F>trious Per<U+017F>on of <hi>Syene</hi> coming between, intercepted tho<U+017F>e that were on the Wall, by <U+017F>peaking on this manner: O frantick Men, <U+017F>aid he, and grown <U+017F>tupid with Calamity, do we repel tho<U+017F>e per<U+017F>ons who<U+017F>e Aid we <U+017F>o lately begg'd, and make War with them at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tant of their coming to relieve us, beyond our expectation? If they come with a friendly mind, declaring matter of Peace, they are our Pre<U+017F>ervers: if with ho<U+017F>tile intentions, you will ea<U+017F>ily vanqui<U+017F>h them, though they were arrived to the very Wall. But to what purpo<U+017F>e (if we regard our <U+017F>afety) <U+017F>hould we de<U+017F>troy the<U+017F>e, when we are environ'd with <U+017F>uch a Sea, and va<U+017F>t num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers behind? Why do we not therefore receive them, and know for what purpo<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>ent? His Judgment was approved by all, the Deputy him<U+017F>elf applauding it; they then <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated them<U+017F>elves, and cea<U+017F>ed from any further Action.</p>

               <p>When the pa<U+017F><U+017F>age for the Ship-men was clear, and the Town<U+017F>men, by White Flags, <U+017F>ignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they <U+017F>hould have free Landing; the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> went nearer, and from their Ve<U+017F><U+017F>els, as it were <U+017F>o many Pulpits in a Theatre, they <U+017F>poke in this manner; O <hi>Per<U+017F>ians,</hi> and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans of <hi>Syene,,</hi> know that <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> King of the Ea<U+017F>tern and We<U+017F>tern <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent al<U+017F>o yours; as he knows how to Conquer, he likewi<U+017F>e under<U+017F>tands how to <U+017F>hew Mercy: That is the part of Courage, but this of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The one he accounts the Vertue of a Souldier, the other peculiar only to him<U+017F>elf. Whereas therefore he has your Lives in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, either to give, or take them away; but <U+017F>ince you are <U+017F>uppliant, he offers you delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, without the ruine of War. Moreover, he does not impo<U+017F>e the terms of freedom upon you, but leaves you your <U+017F>elves to choo<U+017F>e them: For he governs not the Fortunes of Men by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny, but Clemency. To this Me<U+017F><U+017F>age the <hi>Syeneans</hi> an<U+017F>wer'd, That they would deliver Them<U+017F>elves, Wives and Children, into his Power, to deal with them as he plea<U+017F>ed: That they wold likewi<U+017F>e deliver the City into his hands, if they <U+017F>urviv'd, which in that extremity was uncertain, unle<U+017F>s their De<U+017F>truction was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes. Oroondates</hi> offer'd to <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render <hi>Philae</hi> and the <hi>Smaragdan</hi> Mines, which were the occa<U+017F>ion of the War, but de<U+017F>ired that he would exact no more from him, nor require
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56010:167"/>him to re<U+017F>ign up him<U+017F>elf or his Souldiers. But if <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> were pleas'd indeed to exerci<U+017F>e Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, That he would <U+017F>uffer tho<U+017F>e that made no re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance to depart to <hi>Elephantina;</hi> for that is were the <U+017F>ame thing for him to die now, as to be afterwards put to death, by his King, for giving up his Army: Nay, it would be much wor<U+017F>e, <U+017F>ince the pre<U+017F>ent would be only a <U+017F>ingle, and u<U+017F>ual <U+017F>ort of Death, but the other with the <U+017F>evere<U+017F>t kind of Torment.</p>
               <p>When the Legates heard this, they turn'd their Prows, and related all to <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes.</hi> He <U+017F>miling, and much reproving the folly of <hi>Oroon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t upon Terms, who yet depended on another per<U+017F>ons plea<U+017F>ure, whether he <U+017F>hould live or die: Yet, <U+017F>aid he, it is not ju<U+017F>t, for the offence of one man, to <U+017F>uffer <U+017F>o populous a City to be de<U+017F>troy'd. Wherefore he permitted tho<U+017F>e that were with <hi>Oroondates</hi> to depart, though they <U+017F>carce forbore from Re<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered <U+017F>ome of his own Men to damm up the breach in the Bank of <hi>Nile,</hi> and to others to break down part of what he rai<U+017F>ed. That by means of the Inlet of <hi>Nile</hi> being <U+017F>topped, and pa<U+017F><U+017F>age made for the Water that was taken in, to go away, <hi>Syene</hi> might be the <U+017F>ooner made dry. They therefore <U+017F>etting clo<U+017F>e to the work, fini<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by the next day.</p>
               <p>Nor did they that were within the Town <U+017F>pare their pains, not de<U+017F>pairing of pre<U+017F>servation, though beyond hope. They therefore made
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56010:168"/>Suffs under ground, to receive and carry off the Water. Others brought props to the Walls, which they ea<U+017F>ily did, heaping the Stones which from the ruines fell into the Town. But after they thought them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>afe enough on this account, yet they were not without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen<U+017F>ion; in the middle of the night, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain part of the Bulwark, which the <hi>Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the Evening had begun to dig down, (whether it were that that part was more loo<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heaped up, <U+017F>o as to let Water <U+017F>ink into the Foundation, or whether it broke the <U+017F>ides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almo<U+017F>t dug through, when the Work-men were gone, or whether it happen'd by Divine Will) beyond all expectation, if fell down, with <U+017F>o great a noi<U+017F>e, that both Armies were a<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>hed, both <hi>Aethiopian</hi> and <hi>Syeneans</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Town-walls to be tumbled down at once: But the<U+017F>e being <U+017F>ecure, continu'd in their Tents, remaining <U+017F>atisfy'd to know what it <U+017F>hould be, when day-light was return'd. But the Citizens ran every where to their Walls, and as every one <U+017F>aw his own part entire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the ruine was on <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>ide; till the breaking day di<U+017F>pell'd their fears, when they <U+017F>aw where the Breach was, and that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed away. But now the <hi>Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> diverted the Flood, making Cataracts, which they propt with Timber, lining them al<U+017F>o with Mud and Straw, which the multitude of hands ea<U+017F>ily brought together. Thus the Waters pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56010:168"/>away entirely, yet was there no pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to each other, for the depth of Mud which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, which, thought it <U+017F>eem'd dry and cru<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, yet it continued moi<U+017F>t at bottom, <U+017F>o that neither Men nor Hor<U+017F>e could pa<U+017F>s, without being foundred therein.</p>
               <p>Thus the time pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed for two or three days; The Town<U+017F>men, by <U+017F>etting open their Gates, and the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> by laying down their Arms, mutually declaring Peace. This Truce was more remarkable, becau<U+017F>e it was without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Parties, and neither of them <U+017F>et any Watch. They that were in Town gave them<U+017F>elves to Pa<U+017F>times, for it happen'd then to be the Fe<U+017F>tival of <hi>Nile,</hi> which is accounted the greate<U+017F>t of any among the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> which is celebrated at the entrance of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sol<U+017F>tice, when the River fir<U+017F>t begins to <U+017F>well; and for that rea<U+017F>on this Solemnity is held by them in greate<U+017F>t Honour. The <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e <hi>Nilus</hi> to be a God, and the mo<U+017F>t Supream, his Stream vying with the Coele<U+017F>tial River, becau<U+017F>e it waters their Fields without Rain, or A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance from Heaven; it <U+017F>elf <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the want of <U+017F>howers with its yearly overflow. The<U+017F>e are Vulgar Traditions. But a likelier rea<U+017F>on of giving him this Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is their reckoning the Copulation of hot and moi<U+017F>t, the cau<U+017F>e not of generation, but pre<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Man; and that the <hi>Nile</hi> <U+017F>upplies the Moi<U+017F>t, and their Earth the Dry. Yet the<U+017F>e are
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56010:169"/>al<U+017F>o Vulgar Conceptions: But the mo<U+017F>t skilful in My<U+017F>teries, <U+017F>ay that <hi>I<U+017F>is</hi> <U+017F>ignifies the Earth, and <hi>O<U+017F>yris</hi> the <hi>Nile,</hi> changing the names for the things. That therefore the Godde<U+017F>s burns with De<U+017F>ire of him, and always rejoyces at his return; and he being retired, laments again, as <U+017F>truck with bla<U+017F>ting Lightning. This fiction their Divines have framed, as I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e they would not have their My<U+017F>teries pryed into by profane per<U+017F>ons.</p>
               <p>Let this <U+017F>uffice for the pre<U+017F>ent; for our of Reverence we al<U+017F>o forbear to mention their deeper My<U+017F>teries. We will therefore return to the Tran<U+017F>actions of <hi>Syene.</hi> This Fe<U+017F>tival Day being ri<U+017F>en, the Natives apply'd them<U+017F>elves to the killing of Sacrifices; though their Bodies were over-labour'd with their Di<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es, yet their Minds were never the le<U+017F>s active for the <U+017F>ervice of their God. But <hi>Oroondates</hi> watching his opportunity, in the dead of the Night, when the Town<U+017F>men, after their Banquets, were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in Sleep, by <U+017F>tealth led out his Army, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an hour before given the charge of that Gate, through which he meant to pa<U+017F>s, to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ian</hi> Centries. Command was given to the Officers to leave all their Hor<U+017F>es behind them, that they might be no incumbrance, nor by their Noi<U+017F>e di<U+017F>cover what was done; but every man to take his Armour, and a Board or Plank along with them.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:56010:169"/>
               <p>After they were thus a<U+017F><U+017F>embled at the Gate, they ca<U+017F>t down the Planks which each had brought, placing them along in <U+017F>uch Order that the one touched the other, the la<U+017F>t <U+017F>till handing them to tho<U+017F>e that went before; by which means, as with a Bridge, they pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed <U+017F>afely over the Slime. Coming to dry ground, (the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting no <U+017F>uch thing, nor keeping any Watch) they marched with all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible <U+017F>peed by them, towards <hi>Elephantina.</hi> And without any ob<U+017F>tacle, were received into the Town, by rea<U+017F>on of two <hi>Per<U+017F>ians,</hi> that (as it was agreed between them) <U+017F>at upon the Walls, to expect their coming at that time of the night, who accordingly <U+017F>et open the Gates for their Entrance. At the break of Day, the people of <hi>Syene</hi> perceiv'd the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> were fled, every one mi<U+017F><U+017F>ing him that lodged in his Hou<U+017F>e: They were further inform'd by conferring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and la<U+017F>tly, by the Bridge of Boards, which they found laid over the Ooze. Once more therefore they were <U+017F>eized with Terrour and Con<U+017F>ternation, that they <U+017F>hewed <U+017F>o little Faith to <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> after having <U+017F>o much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced his Clemency, in permitting the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ians</hi> to e<U+017F>cape. They therefore re<U+017F>olved with one Voice, to go out of the City, and <U+017F>urrender them<U+017F>elves to the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> with Oaths of their Ignorance, if po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly they might obtain Mercy. Being therefore all gather'd together, of both Sex, and all Ages, with Boughs in their

Nor had he put them into a readine<U+017F>s before he was inform'd that the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> were on their way toward him. <hi>Oroondates</hi> having drawn the greate<U+017F>t part of his Forces to <hi>Elephantina,</hi> was forced him<U+017F>elf with a few to take into <hi>Syene,</hi> as we have already <U+017F>hewn, where he receiv'd Mercy of <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes;</hi> yet was he <U+017F>o full of guile, as to withdraw to his fore<U+017F>aid Army, placing all his hopes in Celerity, and thinking to come upon <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> unprovided.</p>
               <p>When the two Armies were now in <U+017F>ight of each other, the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Pride was <U+017F>hewn, dazling
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56010:171"/>the whole Field with Golden and Silver Arms, for the Sun then ri<U+017F>ing full upon the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians,</hi> reflected from them, like Lightning, to a great di<U+017F>tance. The <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> made up the Right Wing, their Armed Men going before, and the Archers bringing up the Rear, that being eas'd from the Incumbrance of Armour, they might more dextrou<U+017F>ly <U+017F>hoot their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, protected by the Armed Body. He pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his <hi>Aegyptian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Companies on the Left Wing, adding al<U+017F>o Archers and Slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, whom he commanded to make Excur<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gall the Enemies Flank. He him<U+017F>elf came with the Main Body, <U+017F>plendidly <U+017F>eated on a Chariot, with Guards on each <U+017F>ide for his <U+017F>ecurity, his Bard Hor<U+017F>e being ranked before him, in which he put his greate<U+017F>t tru<U+017F>t; in his po<U+017F>ture he adventured to begin the Battel. For this Party was mo<U+017F>t Warlike, and like a Wall or Bulwark, planted before the re<U+017F>t of his Army.</p>
               <p>The manner in which they were Armed was thus: A cho<U+017F>en per<U+017F>on, of great Strength and Stature, put on a Helmet, with a Face made to it, exactly re<U+017F>embling that of a Man: This covered the Head all down to the Shoulders, places only being left open for the Eyes: His Right Hand held a Weapon bigger than a Spear, while their Left was free to manage the Reins; a Sword hanging by his <U+017F>ide; not only his Brea<U+017F>t, but his whole Body was covered with Armour,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56010:171"/>joined with Scales of Iron and Bra<U+017F>s, in form of a quadrangle; one being laid waving over the other; which thus by degrees went to their extremity, the Plates being firmly riveted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet framed <U+017F>o as to <U+017F>it without any Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to the Body, and every where plying to it: Every joint thereof turning on Wire, and extending or contracting with the motion of the Per<U+017F>on. Thus was it wrought from the Head to the Knee, a vacancy being only left for the in<U+017F>ide of their Thighs, that <U+017F>at next to their Hor<U+017F>e. Such is the Fabrick thereof, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels all manner of Darts or Spears. From the Foot there was an Iron Boot, that at the Knee joined curiou<U+017F>ly with the Armour. In the <U+017F>ame manner they al<U+017F>o Armed their Hor<U+017F>es, <U+017F>ecuring their Legs, while their Head to their Cre<U+017F>t is entirely Armed, a Covering of Iron Plates thrown over his Back, falling down on each <U+017F>ide to his Flank, yet <U+017F>o loo<U+017F>e as not to incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his going, while it gave him protection. The Man being thus equipp'd, and, as it were, ca<U+017F>t in Armour, is lifted up upon his Hor<U+017F>e, not being able, by rea<U+017F>on of the weight, to mount him<U+017F>elf. When the Fight is begun, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Reins to his Hor<U+017F>e, and clapping Spurs to them, he ru<U+017F>heth upon the Enemy, as it were a Tempe<U+017F>t.</p>
               <p>The Pike, near to the part where a long Steel Blade comes out, is fa<U+017F>ten'd to the Hor<U+017F>es Neck, by which means it is <U+017F>upported; it is al<U+017F>o hung
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56010:172"/>at the other end by Thongs to the Hor<U+017F>es Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in <U+017F>uch manner as not to hinder, but a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Hand of the Per<U+017F>on that directs it: So that by the Hor<U+017F>es motion, the force is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed; by which means two or three at a time are often born upon the Poin.</p>
               <p>The Deputy being thus provided, and his Forces drawn up in this manner, left the River on his Back, being much le<U+017F>s in number than the Enemy, which <U+017F>erved him for a Wall, to keep him from being <U+017F>urrounded. <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide thus order'd his Battel: Again<U+017F>t the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> in the Right Wing, he placed his Souldiers from <hi>Meroe,</hi> skilful in <U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fight; as al<U+017F>o the <hi>Troglodytae,</hi> with tho<U+017F>e of the Neighbouring Country, from which Cinnamon is brought, in light Arms, and <U+017F>wift of foot, to engage the Adver<U+017F>aries Left Wing. But under<U+017F>tanding the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> middle Ranks to be their chief <U+017F>trength, he oppo<U+017F>ed to them him<U+017F>elf, with Elephants bearing Towers, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them the <hi>Blemmii</hi> and <hi>Seri,</hi> with In<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions what to do when they were engaged.</p>
               <p>When Signals on both <U+017F>ides were given, by the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> with Trumpets, by the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> with Hammers and Kettle-drums. <hi>Oroondates</hi> encouraging his Party, led them on. <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> commanded his Men to advance flowly at fir<U+017F>t, that the Elephants might keep up with them, and al<U+017F>o that the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Hor<U+017F>e in the middle might be di<U+017F>order'd, before the whole Bodies
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56010:172"/>were join'd. When they were now within the Ca<U+017F>t of a Dart, and the <hi>Blemmi</hi> perceiv'd the Bard Hor<U+017F>e of the Enemy to come on fiercely, they ob<U+017F>erv'd what had been commanded by <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> the <hi>Seri</hi> being left to guard the Elephants, they made up <U+017F>peedily before the re<U+017F>t, again<U+017F>t the Bard Hor<U+017F>e, who thought them di<U+017F>tracted, being <U+017F>o few in number, to <U+017F>et upon a Party <U+017F>o well Armed. The <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>purred up fa<U+017F>ter, to take advantage of their na<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s, not doubting to di<U+017F>patch them at the fir<U+017F>t Encounter.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Blemmi,</hi> when they were come hand to hand, as it were at one <U+017F>ign, <U+017F>unk down all together, <U+017F>etting one Knee to the ground, and putting their Heads and Backs under the Hor<U+017F>es Bellies, receiv'd no harm, but from their treading <U+017F>ometimes upon them. But they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd what was beyond all expectation, <U+017F>tab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Bard Hor<U+017F>e up into their Bellies, which part alone was unarm'd: Wherefore not a few were ca<U+017F>t off by their Hor<U+017F>es, enraged with their wounds, whom the <hi>Blemmi</hi> <U+017F>tabb'd (as they lay on the ground) on the in<U+017F>ide of their Thighs. For the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Cataphract is <U+017F>o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with Armour, that he cannot <U+017F>tir, when once di<U+017F>imounted. Tho<U+017F>e that kept their Saddles were carry'd directly upon the <hi>Seri,</hi> who on their approach, retreated behind their Elephants, who<U+017F>e va<U+017F>t Bodies <U+017F>erved them for a Bulwark. By this means there was great
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56010:173"/>Slaughter made of the Hor<U+017F>e, in<U+017F>ormuch that they were almo<U+017F>t utterly cut off: For the Hor<U+017F>es frighten'd with the <U+017F>ight of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, leaped and <U+017F>tarted, <U+017F>ome flying out one way, and <U+017F>ome another, putting their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into di<U+017F>order. They that <U+017F>at upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants (<U+017F>ix Archers being allotted to each Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereof each Bea<U+017F>t carry'd two) <U+017F>hot <U+017F>o fa<U+017F>t from thence, that their Arrows <U+017F>eem'd a Cloud, and <U+017F>o exactly aim'd, that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally wounded the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> in the Eyes, who accordingly ran confu<U+017F>edly one among<U+017F>t ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All that were born forward again<U+017F>t their wills by the mettle of their Steeds, came direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Elephants.</p>
               <p>They were therefore thus con<U+017F>umed, being partly trodden down by the Elephants, partly cut down by the <hi>Seri,</hi> making Excur<U+017F>ions from behind their Elephants, as it were from an Ambu<U+017F>cade. The few that e<U+017F>caped, went off without any memorable performance, and not the lea<U+017F>t hurt done to the Elephants. Tho<U+017F>e Bea<U+017F>ts are clad in Iron when they go to War, be<U+017F>ide the natural hardne<U+017F>s of their Skin, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with a tough Scur<U+017F>f or Scale, too firm for any Spear to pierce.</p>
               <p>All being at length put to Rout, the Deputy him<U+017F>elf fied at la<U+017F>t mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>hamefully on a <hi>Ny<U+017F>aean</hi> Hor<U+017F>e, leaving his Chariot behind him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tho<U+017F>e that were of his Left Wing were yet ignorant hereof, and <U+017F>tood <U+017F>toutly to their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56010:173"/>work, though receiving more Wounds than they gave; <U+017F>u<U+017F>taining all difficulties: For the Troops from the Cinnamon Region, with whom they encountred, pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed them very hard, and reduced them to the la<U+017F>t Di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s; flying off when<U+017F>oever the others came on, far out-<U+017F>tripping them; yet <U+017F>hooting back, and wounding as they <U+017F>led: But as the others Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, came furiou<U+017F>ly again upon them, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Flanks with Slings and little Darts, all which were notwith<U+017F>tanding Mortal, the Piles being dipped in Serpents Blood. They bear a round Cover on their Heads, <U+017F>tuck through with Arrows, the <U+017F>haft end whereof is placed next their Heads, the Pile, even to the Feathers, coming out above. Thus every one marches clattering to fight, expo<U+017F>ing a naked Body to the Foe: Crowned, as it were, with Arrows, which have no Iron on their Points, nor have any need of it: By rea<U+017F>on that they are made of a Dragons Back-bone, an ell in length, the natural hardne<U+017F>s whereof being harpen'd at one end, <U+017F>erves for a point, from whence the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <U+017F>uch kind of Arrows, Bones. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> notwith<U+017F>tanding <U+017F>tood along time to it, joining their Shields together, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>taining <U+017F>howers of Darts, though they were impatient of War, yet now either glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Wherefore having obtain'd what I came down for, I return an adorer of Equity.

Accordingly it happen'd; for before <U+017F>he was return'd to her Palace, a Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger overtook her with the <U+017F>ame tydings. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Officers therefore ha<U+017F>ten the preparations for the Sacrifices, permitting only Male Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons to be pre<U+017F>ent: for the Wor<U+017F>hip belonging to the Sun and Moon, the mo<U+017F>t pure and cha<U+017F>t Deities, they excluded Women from the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, le<U+017F>t any Pollution <U+017F>hould happen therein.

The people therefore were too impatient to wait till the day was come, but the Evening before came over the River of <hi>A<U+017F>tabora,</hi> <U+017F>ome by the Bridge; tho<U+017F>e that lived

               <p>The city <hi>Meroe</hi> is a Triangular I<U+017F>land, made by the Confluence of the <hi>Nile,</hi> the <hi>A<U+017F>tabora</hi> and <hi>Ala<U+017F>obus:</hi> This inland Spot being miles in length, in Breadth, is furni<U+017F>h'd with Animals of va<U+017F>t bulk, the Elephants being bred there: And as it bears <U+017F>ome Plants naturally, is by Improvement <U+017F>upply'd with others: For be<U+017F>ides Palm-trees of prodigious Tallne<U+017F>s, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>o bears Corn of <U+017F>uch height, that a Man on Hor<U+017F>e-back, and <U+017F>ometimes on Camels, is hid in pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing through: It is withal <U+017F>o fertile, that the Grain which is <U+017F>own comes up three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold.</p>
               <p>The people being thus tran<U+017F>ported over the re<U+017F>pective Rivers, they all met, and joint'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations to <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> as it were to <U+017F>ome Deity; but the<U+017F>e however at a di<U+017F>tance: The Gymno<U+017F>ophi<U+017F>ts were admitted neare<U+017F>t to him, <U+017F>o as to join Hands, and <U+017F>alute him, before the Sacred ground. After them <U+017F>tood <hi>Per<U+017F>ina,</hi> in the Entrance to the Temple. After they had here fini<U+017F>h'd Adorations and Prai<U+017F>e, they turn'd off to the Publick Sacrifices, placing them<U+017F>elves in Tabernacles that were before prepared. The<U+017F>e were compo<U+017F>ed of four Canes, newly cut down, each Cane being cut four <U+017F>quare, <U+017F>erv'd for a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56010:182"/>Pillar; the Covering was made of <U+017F>everal Boughts, the faire<U+017F>t being Branches of the Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree. In another Tabernacle was placed the Images of their Gods, with Pictures of famous Per<U+017F>ons, of <hi>Memnon, Per<U+017F>eus,</hi> and <hi>Andromeda;</hi> <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed, by them, the Authors of their Royal Line. In Seats below <U+017F>at the Gymno<U+017F>ophi<U+017F>ts, with the Images of their Gods likewi<U+017F>e over their Heads: Before them Bands of Souldiers, with Shields, to keep off the Pre<U+017F>s of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and pre<U+017F>erve room for the Solemnities. <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> in few words, told the company his Service perform'd for the Commonwealth, and commanded the Sacrifices to begin. Three Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars were erected, two of them appertaining to the Sun and Moon, the third to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> <U+017F>et at di<U+017F>tance, to whom they offered all manner of living Creatures. Upon the Suns Altar were Sacrificed young Hor<U+017F>es: A yoak of Oxen to the Moon, as being <U+017F>erviceable in Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry. In the mean time there was a voice heard among the Crowd, Let the u<U+017F>ual Sacrifice of the Country, for our common <U+017F>afety, be fir<U+017F>t made; and after that, the fir<U+017F>t fruits of the War be offer'd. <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pis</hi> under<U+017F>tanding them to mean humane Sacrifices, as was u<U+017F>ual of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives taken in Foreign Wars, <U+017F>igned to them with his hand, that they <U+017F>hould in<U+017F>tantly have their De<U+017F>ire: Withal commanding the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pri<U+017F>oners to be brought forth: Among them came <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> guarded, but not

The re<U+017F>t were pen<U+017F>ive, only the<U+017F>e <U+017F>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with chearful Countenance: <hi>Chariclea</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing con<U+017F>tantly on <hi>Per<U+017F>ina,</hi> <U+017F>o that <U+017F>he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd thereat, and <U+017F>aid, O Sir, What a Virgin have you commanded to be Sacrific'd? I never <U+017F>aw <U+017F>o great Beauty and Re<U+017F>olution. Her Age and Form extremely move me; if our Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had liv'd, <U+017F>he would have been now of her years: I wi<U+017F>h to the Gods you could find <U+017F>ome means for her Delivery. I <U+017F>hould be pleas'd to have her an Attendant at my Table. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the unhappy Creature is a <hi>Grecian,</hi> for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there <U+017F>uch a Beauty in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> She is a <hi>Greek,</hi> an<U+017F>wer'd he, by Father and Mother, whom <U+017F>he promis'd to produce in this pre<U+017F>ence, but how that can be po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, I do not imagine: But that <U+017F>he <U+017F>hould be deliver'd from this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I am <U+017F>ure is ab<U+017F>olutely impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, though I my <U+017F>elf could wi<U+017F>h it, and am touch'd with Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for her. Our Laws exact a Man to be Sacrificed to the Sun, and a Virgin to the Moon; and <U+017F>he being fir<U+017F>t taken, the people will not otherwi<U+017F>e be <U+017F>atisfy'd: One help only remains, which is, if <U+017F>he prove not a pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, for <U+017F>uch the Sacrifice requires; and if <U+017F>o, <U+017F>he is uncapable of your Reception. Let her be <U+017F>o found, <U+017F>aid <hi>Per<U+017F>ina,</hi> rather than Die; nor can <U+017F>he be much blamed, after <U+017F>uch Exile and Travels, e<U+017F>pecially having Beauty, that could <U+017F>carce e<U+017F>cape Force and Rape. <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Fire to be brought, by the Prie<U+017F>ts, from
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56010:183"/>the Temple, on which the Captives were to tred. Bars of Gold were heated over this Fire, and had this Virtue, That every uncha<U+017F>te or perjured per<U+017F>on were burned with treading on them, but <U+017F>uch as were otherwi<U+017F>e, receiv'd no harm. The Corrupted Per<U+017F>ons they appointed to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and other Gods. After <hi>Theagenes</hi> had trod there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was found Cha<U+017F>te, which was with wonder beheld, he being of <U+017F>uch Youth and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; wherefore he was <U+017F>et apart, to be offer'd to the Sun. Then, <U+017F>aid he to <hi>Chariclea</hi> a<U+017F>ide, is Death the Reward of Cha<U+017F>tity in <hi>Aethiopia?</hi> But wherefore do you not now di<U+017F>cover your <U+017F>elf? What other time do you expect? or will you <U+017F>tay till the Knife has pierc'd our Throats? Therefore declare your <U+017F>elf: When you are known, 'tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible I may be <U+017F>aved for your <U+017F>ake; at lea<U+017F>t you will be <U+017F>afe your <U+017F>elf, which will be my <U+017F>atisfaction in Death.</p>
               <p>She told him her Time was now at hand; and <U+017F>o, without command, put on her holy ve<U+017F>tment, which <U+017F>he brought with her from <hi>Delphi,</hi> wrought with Gold, and <U+017F>et with Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; then with her hair di<U+017F>hevell'd, and, as it were, in<U+017F>pired with Divine fury, <U+017F>he leap'd upon the Coals, where <U+017F>he <U+017F>tood a long time without hurt, the Fire only giving addition to her Beauty; <U+017F>o that in that Holy Attire, <U+017F>he <U+017F>eems to the Beholders rather a Godde<U+017F>s than Mortal Woman: So that the mo<U+017F>t Super<U+017F>titious among<U+017F>t them heartily wi<U+017F>hed her Deliverance.

                  <hi>Per<U+017F>ina,</hi> above all others, was troubled, and <U+017F>aid to <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> How unhappy is this wretch that boa<U+017F>ts of a Cha<U+017F>tity that is <U+017F>o fatal to her!

Then turning to the Gymno<U+017F>ophi<U+017F>ts, he asked them, Why they did not begin? The Gods forbid, (an<U+017F>wer'd <hi>Sy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathres,</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> that the people might not under<U+017F>tand him) for we have too much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan'd our Eyes and Ears with what is already done. As for our parts, we will retire into the Temple, being of opinion that the<U+017F>e humance Sacrifices are abomination to the Gods; we could al<U+017F>o wi<U+017F>h no Blood of any other Creature to be <U+017F>hed on <U+017F>uch account, as knowing that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and bloodle<U+017F>s Offerings are mo<U+017F>t grateful to the Divine Powers. However, your pre<U+017F>ence, Sir, is nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, <U+017F>ince the cu<U+017F>tomes of the Country exact it, and your people will not otherwi<U+017F>e be <U+017F>atisfy'd.

And whether the Infant that was expos'd be not Dead, while he that found her, took advantage of his good Fortune; to impo<U+017F>e on our de<U+017F>ire of having a Child, by propo<U+017F>ing a Changeling in<U+017F>tead; and Colouring the Cheat with this Fa<U+017F>cia.</p>
               <p>Your fir<U+017F>t doubt I can clear, an<U+017F>wer'd <hi>Sy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathres:</hi> I was the Per<U+017F>on that found the expo<U+017F>ed Child, bred her for <U+017F>ome time, and carry'd her with me to <hi>Aegypt;</hi> when on Emba<U+017F><U+017F>y you <U+017F>ent me thither. You know well, that our order dare not <U+017F>peak untruth: I likewi<U+017F>e know the <hi>Fa<U+017F>cia</hi> to be the <U+017F>ame by the Royal Characters, and impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to be counterfeited; even you your <U+017F>elf may know <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi>'s Hand-writing therein: But there were other Te<U+017F>timonals found with this, and by me deliver'd to the Per<U+017F>on to whom I gave her, the Man a <hi>Greek,</hi> and of <U+017F>eeming Hone<U+017F>ty. They are al<U+017F>o pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd, <U+017F>aid <hi>Chariclea,</hi> and produc'd the Bracelets. <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi> was now more a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hed: <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> asking her if <U+017F>he knew them?

Then was <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> more anxious than before: Then <U+017F>aid <hi>Chariclea,</hi> the<U+017F>e Signals were my Mothers, but this, Sir, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly your own; giving him the Ring with the

Be<U+017F>ide I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <U+017F>ame Lu<U+017F>tre of her Eyes, the <U+017F>ame Fair Lineaments, Complexion, and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd Beauty. You <U+017F>peak well, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> and rather like a Patron, than Judge of her Cau<U+017F>e; but take heed, lea<U+017F>t in favouring her, you bring que<U+017F>tion of Scandal upon my Wife: It being impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible, that we being both <hi>Aethiops,</hi> <U+017F>hould have a Fair Child. We call him the be<U+017F>t Judge an<U+017F>wer'd <hi>Sy<U+017F>imathres,</hi> who is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Equity: But how do we <U+017F>eem more, to Patronize the Maid than you? For your Cen<U+017F>ure we are not concern'd, who<U+017F>e bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is more to approve our <U+017F>elves to the Gods than to Men: So that is enough for us to <U+017F>atisfy our own Con<U+017F>ciences. As to your Doubt concerning her Colour, the <hi>Fa<U+017F>cia</hi> it <U+017F>elf an<U+017F>wers it: That <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi> conceiv'd a Daughter of this Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; by looking on the Picture of <hi>Andromeda,</hi> in your Bedchamber: If you doubt the likene<U+017F>s, the Picture is here at hand, compare them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you will <U+017F>ee no difference between the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Painted Virgin.</p>

               <p>When they were <U+017F>et together, the Beholders were <U+017F>urpriz'd at the Re<U+017F>emblance, which rais'd a great noi<U+017F>e; tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>tood nearer, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that were at more di<U+017F>tance: So that <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> him<U+017F>elf could no longer doubt, but <U+017F>tood Speechle<U+017F>s with Joy and Admiration. At la<U+017F>t there is one thing yet wanting: O <hi>Sy<U+017F>imathres,</hi> <U+017F>aid he, there was a certain Speck or Mole above my Daughters Right Elbow: which was found al<U+017F>o on <hi>Chariclea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi> could no longer contain her <U+017F>elf, but leaping from the Throne, threw her Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Neck, weeping for Joy, and almo<U+017F>t ready to faint away. The <U+017F>ame Parental Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <U+017F>eiz'd <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> though with more manly Government, yet he al<U+017F>o embraced her, and not without Tears. After this, waving his Hand, he <U+017F>ilenced the buzzing among<U+017F>t the Croud. O you that are pre<U+017F>ent, <U+017F>aid he, you have <U+017F>een and heard me this day prov'd a Father beyond all expectation. Yet <U+017F>uch is my regard to you, that waving the care of Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ion and Paternal Joy, I am for your <U+017F>akes ready to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her up to the Gods in Sacrifice: For though I <U+017F>ee you al<U+017F>o concern'd for the Misfortune of <U+017F>o fair a Virgin, yet whether you will or no, I mu<U+017F>t perform the Cu<U+017F>tom of our Country, and prefer the publick Intere<U+017F>t to private Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Having thus <U+017F>poken, he took <hi>Chariclea</hi> by the Hand, as to lead her to the Altar; at which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56010:187"/>the whole multitude <U+017F>et up a Cry, not <U+017F>uffering him to lead her one <U+017F>tep forward, but calling out <U+017F>ave the Maid, <U+017F>ave her whom the Gods would have pre<U+017F>erv'd: We return you our thanks, our Laws are <U+017F>atisfy'd. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you our King, do you acknowledge your <U+017F>elf a Father. There is no man than will lay Hands on her; you that are Father of your Country, be Father of your own Hou<U+017F>e: The<U+017F>e and many more <U+017F>uch Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions were utter'd; downright re<U+017F>i<U+017F>ting his Propo<U+017F>al, and <U+017F>aying, the Gods would be <U+017F>atisfy'd with other Offerings. <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> <U+017F>uffer'd him<U+017F>elf to be overcome, and took plea<U+017F>ure in the Violence.</p>
               <p>Standing therefore next to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> deare<U+017F>t, <U+017F>aid he, that you are our Daughter, the proofs are <U+017F>ufficient; but who is this Youth, who was taken Pri<U+017F>oner with you, and is now <U+017F>et before the Altar? or how could you call him Brother, when you were together brought into my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence at <hi>Syene?</hi> For how <U+017F>hall he be found our Son? For <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi> has but once been deliver'd, and that only of your <U+017F>elf. <hi>Chariclea</hi> blu<U+017F>hing and ca<U+017F>ting her Eyes on the ground, I feign'd him indeed to be my Brother in that Exigence, but who he is, he him<U+017F>elf will better inform you. Do you therefore take place by your Mother on the Tribunal; filling her with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er joy, than when <U+017F>he fir<U+017F>t Bore you; entertain her with the Hi<U+017F>tory of your Affairs, while I take care for the Sacrifices, and choo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ome

                  <hi>Chariclea</hi> could <U+017F>care forbear crying out at the mention hereof, but governing her Affection; once more attempted him in the<U+017F>e words:</p>
               <p>O Sir, there is no need to <U+017F>eek for another of my Sex, <U+017F>ince the people have excu<U+017F>ed me: But if you mu<U+017F>t, there mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o another Youth be found, or if that be not done, no other Maid, for I my <U+017F>elf mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o die: For the Gods have determin'd me to Live and Die with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> not yet under<U+017F>tanding her, <U+017F>aid, I commend this Humanity in you Daughter, towards a <hi>Grecian</hi> and Stranger, the Companion of your Exile; but it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to exempt him from Sacrifice without Violation of our Religion, neither will the people di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>e therewith.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> came down from his Throne to meet him, embracing him with paternal Courte<U+017F>ie, and <U+017F>aying; you come in good time, my Son, to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t our Triumphant Rites, and al<U+017F>o your

Accordingly he beckon'd to have him brought in pre<U+017F>ence.</p>
               <p>He therefore cam forward, and was of that <U+017F>tature, that when he <U+017F>tooped to <U+017F>alute <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<U+017F>pes</hi> Knees, he <U+017F>till <U+017F>eem'd tall as any of the re<U+017F>t.

After <hi>Merae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> were admitted the Emba<U+017F><U+017F>adours from the <hi>Seri,</hi> bringing two Ve<U+017F>tments, made by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ects of their Country, the one of <hi>Tyrian</hi> Dye, the other Snowy White. Having tender'd their pre<U+017F>ents, they were rewarded by the King, with Relea<U+017F>e of certain Pri<U+017F>oners in his cu<U+017F>tody.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arabian</hi> Legates came next, with Spices and Perfumes, the product of their Country, in <U+017F>uch quantities, that they perfum'd all the Air around. After them, the <hi>Trogloditae,</hi> with Gold, and Griffins with Golden Bridles. Then the <hi>Blemmi,</hi> with Arrows made of Dragons Bones, and made up in circular form: And the<U+017F>e, O King, <U+017F>aid they, we pre<U+017F>ent you with le<U+017F>s co<U+017F>tly than others Offering, but of Service to you again<U+017F>t the <hi>Per<U+017F>ians</hi> on the Rivers Bank.

When they reque<U+017F>ted abatement of Tribute, he relea<U+017F>ed it to them for ten years <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ively.</p>
               <p>When the<U+017F>e had thus made their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (mo<U+017F>t of them being remunerated by the King with richer gifts than what they brought) in the la<U+017F>t place came the <hi>Axiomati,</hi> who indeed paid no Tribute, but were in League with him. They al<U+017F>o brought Pre<U+017F>ents; among<U+017F>t others,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56010:189"/>an Animal of <U+017F>trange Form and Nature, of the <U+017F>ize of a Camel, but of <U+017F>potted Skin, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Scales. His hinder parts and Belly like a Lion, his fore Legs and Shoulders exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Members; a long Neck, and waxing very <U+017F>lender, from <U+017F>o large a Body: His Head re<U+017F>embling a Camel, in bigne<U+017F>s twice exceeding the <hi>Lybian</hi> O<U+017F>trich, horribly rowling his Eyes, that <U+017F>eem'd as if en<U+017F>lam'd with Red Lead. His Gate was <U+017F>till more <U+017F>trange, being like no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals, but moving the two Legs on his Right Side together, and then tho<U+017F>e on his Left, carrying forward fir<U+017F>t the one Side of his Body and then the other. Of temper <U+017F>o tame and gentle by u<U+017F>e, that his ma<U+017F>ter led him up and down, with a <U+017F>mall Cord in his Hand. When this Creature appear'd, the multitude were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd, and gave him from his Various Shape, the name of <hi>Camelopardalis.</hi> He was the occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a great Di<U+017F>order which thus happen'd.</p>
               <p>There were a Yoak of Bulls placed before the Altar of the Moon, four White Hor<U+017F>es at the Altar of the Sun, ready for the Sacrifice.

They could not however break through the pre<U+017F>s, the Souldiers joining in a Ring, and with their Shields ob<U+017F>tructing their pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. They were at once the occa<U+017F>ion of great Laughter and Terrour; the per<U+017F>ons at

The Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was <U+017F>o great, that <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> open'd the Curtain to look out. At this time <hi>Theagenes,</hi> whether out of his Natural Vigour, or In<U+017F>piration from the Gods, <U+017F>eeing his Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers di<U+017F>pers'd with the fright, <U+017F>tarted up from the Altar where he kneel'd, and <U+017F>natching from thence a cleft <U+017F>tick, leap'd on the Back of one of the Hor<U+017F>es that were left, and u<U+017F>ing his Main for a Bridge, forc'd him on, and turn'd the Bull that had broke loo<U+017F>e. The Spectators at fir<U+017F>t though that he intended to make his e<U+017F>cape, and <U+017F>et up a cry that they <U+017F>hould not <U+017F>uffer him to pa<U+017F>s. But they <U+017F>oon perceived he had no <U+017F>uch intention: For pur<U+017F>uing the Bull, and catching hold of his Tail, he drove him before him, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trou<U+017F>ly avoiding his <U+017F>hort Turns. With this management he <U+017F>o brake his Mettle, that he now <U+017F>uffer'd him to ride <U+017F>ide by <U+017F>ide to him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>omuch that the Sweat of each Bea<U+017F>t mingled with the other.</p>
               <p>They ran with their Heads <U+017F>o even together, that the people, at di<U+017F>tance, took the Hor<U+017F>e and Bull for one Creature, and applauded <hi>Theagenes</hi> as the Author of a Miracle. Thus were all the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude employ'd. <hi>Chariclea</hi> in the mean time look'd on with horrour, not knowing what he intended and fear'd more for his danger than for her own Life when lately at Stake. <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi> perceiv'd her
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56010:190"/>concern, and <U+017F>aid to her, You are troubled, Daughter, for this Stranger; I confe<U+017F>s I cannot my <U+017F>elf help pitying his Youth, but Yet I hope he will e<U+017F>cape this hazard, and be pre<U+017F>erv'd <U+017F>afe for the Sacrifice. How ab<U+017F>urd is it (an<U+017F>wer'd <hi>Chariclea</hi>) to wi<U+017F>h him to e<U+017F>cape Death, that he may Dye!

               <p>As <U+017F>he was now going to reveal the whole matter, <U+017F>he was once more hindred by a new <U+017F>hout among<U+017F>t the people. <hi>Theagenes</hi> having now fronted the Bull, quitted his Hor<U+017F>e, leaped on the Bulls Neck, and cla<U+017F>ping his Arms round the roots of his Horns, his Hands fa<U+017F>ten'd in his Fore-head Ta<U+017F><U+017F>ock, his Face lying between the Horns, the re<U+017F>t of his Body hanging with all its weight, down over the Bea<U+017F>ts right Shoulder, in<U+017F>omuch that he was often trod upon; yet he <U+017F>o incumbred his pa<U+017F><U+017F>age by this means, and tired him, that directly over again<U+017F>t the place where <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> <U+017F>ate, he tumbled down on his Head, but <U+017F>o

The Kings Servants, therefore, as they were order'd, <U+017F>ome led <hi>Theagenes</hi> to the King, others fa<U+017F>tning Ropes to the Bulls Head, led him with the Hor<U+017F>es once more to the Alar. <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> beginning <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e with <hi>Theagenes,</hi> the people who were pleas'd with his Per<U+017F>on from the fir<U+017F>t mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute they <U+017F>aw him, but not <U+017F>tupify'd at his Strength and Courage, in the la<U+017F>t place envying the Honour given to <hi>Meraebus</hi> his <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Wre<U+017F>tler, with one Cry, demanded that he who had received the Elephant, <U+017F>hould engage in <U+017F>ingle Combat with him that conquer'd the Bull.

               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56010:191"/>
               <p>When he was come up before the Council, <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> <U+017F>poke to <hi>Theagenes</hi> in <hi>Greek;</hi> It is the peoples de<U+017F>ires that you undertake this Combat: Let is be <U+017F>o, <U+017F>aid <hi>Theagenes,</hi> But after what manner?

What you mean by mentioning <hi>Chariclea,</hi> <U+017F>aid <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<U+017F>pes,</hi> I know not; but you mu<U+017F>t Wre<U+017F>tle, and not fight with Swords; for we may not <U+017F>uffer any Blood to be <U+017F>hed before that of Sacrifice. He under<U+017F>tanding <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi>'s meaning, that he fear'd le<U+017F>t he <U+017F>hould be kill'd before he dy'd in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; You do well, <U+017F>aid he, to re<U+017F>erve me for the Gods. With the<U+017F>e words he put him<U+017F>elf in pu<U+017F>ture: fixing his Feet firmly to the ground, his whole Body put in the be<U+017F>t order: Thus he impatiently waited the a<U+017F><U+017F>ault of his Adver<U+017F>ary.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aethiop</hi> <U+017F>eeing this, with a look of Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion and Indignation mixt together, ran furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<U+017F>ly upon him, hitting <hi>Theagenes</hi> on the Neck with his Elbow, as heavily as if he had <U+017F>truck him with a Leaver; then drawing back, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out aloud at his own performance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who was vers'd from his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in Exerci<U+017F>es, knew that <U+017F>uch robu<U+017F>tuous Strength, wanot directly to be engag'd, but deluded by Art, expos'd the other <U+017F>ide of his Neck for a <U+017F>econd blow, which the <hi>Barbarian</hi> repeated,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56010:192"/>and then withdrew as before: He therefore now de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>ing him, and coming on the third time more carele<U+017F>sly, <hi>Theagenes</hi> <U+017F>lipping under his Elbow, and cla<U+017F>ping his Arms round his wa<U+017F>t, which he was <U+017F>carce able to embrance, ca<U+017F>t him quite over his Shoulders, and pitcht him all on a Heap, with his Head fir<U+017F>t to the ground, to the hazard of his Neck. The people now Shou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted louder than before; nor could <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger contain him<U+017F>elf, but leaping down from his Throne, cry'd; O hard nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of Law, what a Noble Youth are we compell'd to de<U+017F>troy. Then calling him to him, <U+017F>aid, it only now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that thou be Crown'd for the Sacrifice. This Famous though un<U+017F>erviceable Victory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erves a Crown: That I <U+017F>hould <U+017F>et you free is not in my Power, but as much as I can do in favour of you, I will; <U+017F>o that if you have any reque<U+017F>t to make to me before you Die, propo<U+017F>e it. With the<U+017F>e words, he put a Golden wreath on his Head, be<U+017F>et with Diamonds. Grant me therefore, <U+017F>aid <hi>Theagenes,</hi> what I <U+017F>hall reque<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince you have promis'd it. If I may not e<U+017F>cape being <U+017F>acrific'd, at lea<U+017F>t let me be Kill'd, by the Hand of your new found Daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> was <U+017F>tung at this motion, reflecting on <hi>Chariclea</hi>'s reque<U+017F>t, which was like this, yet thought it not worth his while, nicely to <U+017F>earch the matter: Tho<U+017F>e things, O Stranger, <U+017F>aid he, which were in my Power, I commanded you to ask, and promis'd that I would grant: The
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56010:192"/>Law exacts, That the Slayer of the Sacrifice, be a Wife and no Virgin. But <U+017F>he has a Husband, an<U+017F>wer'd <hi>Theagenes:</hi> You rave, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> and the<U+017F>e are words of a per<U+017F>on under Con<U+017F>terna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Death. The Fire has prov'd her free from Man: Unle<U+017F>s you call <hi>Meraebus</hi> here her Husband, nor can I gue<U+017F>s how you could come to <U+017F>urnize <U+017F>o much, neither is he yet her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but in Intention only: Neither <U+017F>hall he ever be, <U+017F>aid <hi>Theagenes,</hi> if I know any thing of <hi>Chariclea</hi>'s mind; or as Divine Sacrifice, can fore-<U+017F>hew any future event. But Sacrifices, <U+017F>aid <hi>Meraebus,</hi> can give no Divination till they are Slain, and their Intrals laid open. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O Father, you have rightly Spoken, that the Stranger raves with apprehen<U+017F>ion of Death. Therefore if you plea<U+017F>e, let <U+017F>ome body take him to the Altar. <hi>Theagenes</hi> was accordingly led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: But <hi>Chariclea,</hi> who was a little relieved at his Victory, and conceiv'd better hopes; when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him led again to the Altar, relaps'd into Sorrow. <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi> comforted her, <U+017F>aying, it was yet po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to be re<U+017F>cu'd, if <U+017F>he would plainly and fully declare, what <U+017F>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to know. <hi>Chariclea</hi> found there was no longer time for delay, and therefore freely began, to tell the principal parts of her Story. <hi>Hyda<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi> in the mean time, ask'd by his Officers, if there were any of the Emba<U+017F><U+017F>adours yet unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer'd?

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56010:193"/>mention'd in the Letters, who is in <U+017F>earch of his Daughter: When they <U+017F>hew'd him the Old man, O Stranger, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> I will do all that <hi>Oroondates</hi> has d e<U+017F>ired: Ten Virgin Captives only we brought away, and whereas one of them is known not to be her, do you <U+017F>urvey the other Nine; and if you find her, take her. The Old Man fell down to embrace his feet, and <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the Virgins, as they were brought before him, found not her among<U+017F>t them; therefore he <U+017F>orrowfully <U+017F>aid, None of the<U+017F>e, O King, is <U+017F>he.

               <p>When the Old Man had bent his brows, and wept a while, he lifted up his Eyes, <U+017F>urveying the Company around, and of a <U+017F>udden ran forth as if he had been mad. When he was come up to the Altar, taking off his Cloak, and twi<U+017F>ting it like a Rope, he ca<U+017F>t it about <hi>Theagenes</hi> his Neck, and cry'd out in all their hearing, I have found thee, O my Enemy, I have gotten thee, thou mi<U+017F>chievous and accur<U+017F>ed Man! The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers would have taken him off, but he would not quit his hold, till he had leave to bring him before <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> and the Council; to whom he addre<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf in this manner, O King, <U+017F>aid he, this Man is the Robber that has taken away my Daughter even from the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and now, like a pious per<U+017F>on, he kneels before

No man could longer contain him<U+017F>elf: <hi>Sy<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathres</hi> kept <U+017F>ilence along time, notwith<U+017F>tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he knew the whole My<U+017F>tery, till it were bolted our by little and little: Then coming forth, he Embraced <hi>Charicles,</hi> and <U+017F>aid, your Adoptive Daughter, whom I once deliver'd to you, is well, found, and prov'd to be Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King, which you your <U+017F>elf, al<U+017F>o well know. <hi>Chariclea</hi> al<U+017F>o ran forth from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, like one di<U+017F>tracted, without regard to her quality, or years, and falling at <hi>Charicles</hi> his Feet, <U+017F>aid, O Father, no le<U+017F>s dear to me, than my natural Parent, take what revenge you plea<U+017F>e upon me, notwith<U+017F>tanding, all the excu<U+017F>e that I have of the Gods, Commands for what I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi> al<U+017F>o turning to <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes,</hi> <U+017F>aid, a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elf, Sir, that it is <U+017F>o, This young <hi>Grecian</hi> is your Daughters Husband. The people were overjoy'd at the Di<U+017F>covery, though they imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, under<U+017F>tood it, or rather were Divinely
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56010:195"/>in<U+017F>pired, with the knowledge thereof. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries were reconcil'd to attend this Wonder; Sorrow being joyn'd with Mirth, and Tears with Smiles: The cruel Slaughter, which was every moment expected, turn'd into a Holy and Bloodle<U+017F>s Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>O Wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t of Men, <U+017F>aid <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> to <hi>Sy<U+017F>imathres,</hi> in<U+017F>truct us what we are to do? to decline the Sacrifice of the Gods, is Sacrilege, and to Kill the Innocent, and <U+017F>uch as they favour, Impious.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Sy<U+017F>imathres</hi> (not in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as before) but in <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood of all, thus expre<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf. O King, <U+017F>aid he, Darkne<U+017F>s is <U+017F>ometimes thrown over the mo<U+017F>t de<U+017F>cerning Under<U+017F>tandings, to produce the greater joy. You ought long <U+017F>ince, to have been <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, That the Gods would not permit this Sacrifice, re<U+017F>olving to make your Daughter <hi>Chariclea,</hi> happy in all her de<U+017F>ires; accordingly they have hither brought her Fo<U+017F>ter-father, from the mid<U+017F>t of <hi>Greece:</hi> They have likewi<U+017F>e <U+017F>ent Frights and Di<U+017F>order to di<U+017F>turb the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as <U+017F>ignifying, that more agreeable Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <U+017F>hould be made: They have la<U+017F>tly <U+017F>hewn you, a Bridegroom for your Daughter; this <hi>Grecian</hi> Youth, whom they have with Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles deliver'd. Wherefore let us obey their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure, and no more offend them with humane Victims, who<U+017F>e be<U+017F>t Sacrifices, are Prayers and Obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sy<U+017F>imathres</hi> having <U+017F>aid this with an audible
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56010:195"/>voice, <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> took <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea</hi> by the Hand, <U+017F>aying, you who are pre<U+017F>ent, and <U+017F>ee that the<U+017F>e things are come to pa<U+017F>s, by the direction of the Divine Powers, who<U+017F>e will it is impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, <U+017F>ince you al<U+017F>o <U+017F>eem to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Choice, bear Witne<U+017F>s to the Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which I here rati<U+017F>ie; which we will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm by Holy Rites, and <U+017F>o let us fall to Wor<U+017F>hiping our Gods.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hyda<U+017F>pes</hi> then approach'd the Altars, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to begin the Solemnities, <U+017F>aid, O Sun our Lord, and Moon our Patrone<U+017F>s: Since <hi>Theage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> are by your good Will, declared Husband and Wife, I doubt not, but you will accept their Offerings, and <U+017F>uffer then to do Sacrifice in our Steads. Having thus <U+017F>aid, he took the Mitres, the En<U+017F>igns of Prie<U+017F>thood, from his own and <hi>Per<U+017F>ina</hi>'s Head, placing them on <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea.</hi> When this was done, <hi>Charicles</hi> call'd to mind, the Oracle deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to him at <hi>Delphi,</hi> was now compleated, which foretold concerning this Young Pair, that they <U+017F>hould arrive at a Soil parch'd with Heat;</p>
